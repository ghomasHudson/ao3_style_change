'It's fine, I understand,' Aria interrupted once more, 'It's probably best that they aren't anyway.'
'How sweet of you to visit Dudders,' the woman said, as he followed them into a small sitting room, he heard the door close behind them
"There is no plan." The words kept running through his head. It just wasn't Aria. Normally she would be fighting. The DA would be up and running again and she'd be teaching the first-years how to defend themselves.
Draco watched Aria nod her confirmation, 'If someone could make sure -'
'The bonding plans are coming along fine,' Aria said, though Draco knew better to think she had finished. something though Draco did not know what bothered her. 'It's just - I'm not - I can't -'
'She's a natural,' his mother commented when Aria took Teddy away for asleep, 'aren't you worried that she'll ask to - look after him after Hogwarts.'
'I just feel like ... I'm not being told things,' Aria admitted, for that was what actually brought her here. 'And I ... don't like that.'
Every fiber of his being was enraged. His wings spread of their own accord, hands became taloned, Draco lifted himself into the air and slammed straight into Cygnus.
Aria's step faltered, she had a deep look of thoughtfulness upon her face. 'Not everything about us has to be complementary, it makes sense that yours is a husky. They can be quite independent and rise to a challenge. A Patronus is a reflection of one's self, Draco. You can tell a lot about a person from it.'
Manor this time, in order to celebrate our engagement properly.
'FUCK!' Draco hissed.
Aria laughed childishly again, beaming at him, as he gathered her his arms. Her eyes sparkled with delight, as he led her in a slow dance, and not once did she purposely step on his feet.
'Yes .. very nice Mr Malfoy ..'
The second part had been spoken louder. Someone was listening in. Aria gathered that much. She opened the door and let Draco into her room.
'Do?' Dudley said, looking startled, 'Who said I did anything?'
'It wasn't- you were .. are experiencing is magical bond withdrawal.'
"Then we'll go through a secret passway, get you to Sirius's. He's gone crazy with worry." Ron said tugging at her wrist. Neville starting to walk down the corridor a few steps.
The holidays had arrived and Draco had grown impatient of waiting for a reply. Which is how he had come to be heading down the same street he had been appeared in during the summer. He had waited a couple of days after the day he had known the funeral to be, but Draco was not going to wait any longer. He should have done this, to begin with ... go after her - the first moment he had got the chance to. He had known her well enough to realise that she wouldn't return his letters with one of her own. He should have realised that he would have to speak with her one on one to explain ... everything.
Hermione gave her a knowing look, 'We're talking about Draco Malfoy. As in the same Draco Malfoy, that always raised to a challenge when you issued one - he wasn't going to back down because of an aeroplane.'
'The way it looks, not really, it's always been messy Malfoy! It's naturally messy!'
'I never said that,' Draco said, 'Just seemed like something Granger would say.' Aria smiled, shaking her head lightly, 'So what have you been doing?' Draco repeated as he rubbed the dirt from Aria's face.
"What makes you think he calls me anything?" Aria retorted. Draco was smart. Aria knew it would be a matter of time that he would figure out that Voldemort was hissing in a particular way, in regards to her.
'No,' Aria shook her head, 'I'm fine, don't apologise. I'm fine, honestly.'
Had she missed something in those few moments Draco had apologised or something, for her best friends to sit there calmly? She must have done. That or this was a rather weird dream.
'Congratulations.' Narcissa said cupping Aria's face with her hands moments after Aria and Draco had broken apart.
'My time is my own,' Aria added, 'If I tell you I'm busy - I'm busy. I'm not changing my plans for you!'
'I won't lie ...' Aria replied honestly, 'I never thought highly of them, what with Voldemort and his followers ...' Aria gestured to an empty table, and they made their way to it. 'Slytherin has always had a ... reputation ... then I learned that not all Slytherins were the same...' Aria slid into a seat, and Alana took the chair next to her. 'and the hard way, so I won't be judgemental of you because of your House if you won't be judgemental of me.'
'So are you going to ask her?'
Aria Potter guessed it had been three days since she had fallen into Voldemort's filthy hands. She wasn't exactly sure where she was, because, for the second time in her life, she had been thwarted by a portkey. Once she got out of here, she was going to make sure that portkeys could never be used again. Her magic snapped around her, for all the good it did, bound by dark magic to a chair. Aria calmed herself, exhausting herself or her magic would do her no good, only Voldemort or one of his supporters could release her.
'Yes - no - maybe - I dunno, I'm just ...' she sighed, 'It's confusing.'
'Girl who is at -' the question fell short as the woman looked him over, then turned towards Dudley, 'oh, Dudders, is this a friend of yours? What am I saying, of course, he must be ... well, girl what are you standing in the way for, let the poor young man through.'
'I've heard so much about how your activities ... though a little unorthodox ... is bringing the whole of Hogwarts together. We have accomplished so much since the defeat of the Voldemort ... but we as a community still have so far to go. We have a lot to learn but with each step we take, will strive to do better to put our differences aside so that we can learn to be better people.'
'That she might,' his father said, 'but I agree with Draco - we've done all we can.'
She sighed heavily, tilting her head back so that she faced the ceiling of the aeroplane. Dudley and Emily had fallen asleep some time ago.
'Mr Malfoy.' she greeted with her hand outstretched to shake his own, Draco noticed a glint of gold coming from her wrist, sure enough, it was a bracelet, the same bracelet Draco had made the moment he realised his son would inherit his Veela traits. There was no doubt now Draco had seen it for himself, the girl before him was his sons' compatible match.
'Professor Neumann will take the position of Defence Against the Dart Arts - I'm sure you'll all make him feel welcome -'
"What do you know of Horcruxes?"
'What things exactly?'
Aria clamped up and turned away from him so that she now faced the vanity unit. Draco took that as a sign that she didn't want to talk about it, taking the towel in his hands, looped the end of her hair into and began to dry it.
Draco raised an eyebrow ... Aria knew this look well, he was rather intrigued.
This was going to be so much fun if the look on Malfoy's face was anything to go by. If she could just get Malfoy to call the whole thing off - or his father to get Narcissa to call it off, her life would be able to go back to normal.
His grandmother gave a hefty sigh, 'Celena, I'll think you'll find.'
'Now - now you mention it - something odd did happen -' Aria mumbled, 'I woke from a nightmare - and Dudley and Draco were in the room- it had been Draco that had woken me up - and - I - I felt - safe!'
'It's alright for you,' Draco said as another person tutted they passed. 'You remained neutral -'
'They finally announced the eight-year accommodation,' Hermione said, 'Looks like as they are so many of us returning, they can't fit us into the dorms - so they built one for us, and we'll be sharing it with the other eight-years, they're calling it Memoriam Cornu.'
'You realised our magic was compatible, from something as simple like that?' Aria said stunned.
He felt a nudge at his side, Draco turned, 'What?'
Ron's jaw dropped for a few seconds, 'Then - wow - true compatibility - for Malfoy's Patronus to be your favourite animal.'
'Aria, what do you know of compatible magic?'
'Well I didn't want him to ruin this for you,' Dudley said, he turned his head away, 'we - I treated you like crap. I just wanted you to have a nice time - for once.'
This had to be the oddest reunion Draco had ever come across. He knew that he had another aunt - he didn't know that his other aunt looked exactly like Bellatrix. His hand had stretched towards his wand in the first few moments of meeting her, but no one else had moved towards theirs. There was also the added fact that he had sensed Aria's magic from the woman - but upon a second glance he realised that it was not his aunt Aria's magic was wrapping around, but the baby boy that she held within her arms.
'No, I didn't help him, nor have I seen it before.'
'Yes,' his mother replied, 'our family solicitor informed me after your father had been released,' then his mother turned cold and there was a harsh venomous quality to the tone of her voice, 'And you let those people you call family round on her - call her a whore - let her think she was beneath them - that - that -' his mother took a breath, her face paled, 'that she would not see Draco whilst transformed! That she would not see his wings!'
'If the Sorting Hat considered sorting you into a different house - and you're to state which one.' Aria said.
"The coins aren't for you," came Sirius's voice from the doorway. "The coins are meant for us. For The Order."
Aria had heard through the excited murmurs of Voldemort's Death Eaters that she really should learn the names of, that Snape had suffered at the hands of Voldemort himself. Though she knew it could not have been about Voldemort's major plan. The only way he agreed to let Aria roam the halls of Hogwarts was on the execution of Albus Dumbledore. It was why Aria was failing at producing a Patronus.
'Did you ever wonder why - your sentence in Azkaban was so short? Why Draco and I were never sentenced?' His mother stated. 'She spoke up for us Lucius, all of us - defended us when no one else would - defended your honour - when it was I she owed the life-debt. Aria Potter cleared us - saved our family name, when she was not asked to -'
'Sit down, love,' he gestured to the table, 'And I'll tell you.'
"She's being watched," Neville replied. "She's never on her own. Draco or Ophelia are usually with her. And when they are on patrol I never see Aria."
'He must be -' Fleur said, 'there is no mistaking what you are wearing. And only Veela give bracelets like that - see each rune engraved into it - protection charms - and both your family crests to honour each one as the magic itself is honoured.'
I know snape doesn’t have a daughter. It’s an essential plot of this story and that’s all I have to say on the matter!
Prongs stood tall and proud, bowing his antlered head. Aria caught Draco's smirk of triumph at knowing better. Git! Aria thought.
'Aria,' Dudley said, 'I think I left our paperwork in the kitchen.'
Damn it! Of course, they had been paying attention, but still, it had been worth a try.
'There's a difference?' Neville said.
'But it didn't sound like he had much of a choice ... thinking back on it.'
........
'And it seems to be going well,' Draco said.
'Hows Fleur?' Aria found herself asking, as Ron helped himself. 'How is everything with the baby?'
Draco did not miss the hidden meaning behind what Aria had been really saying, she was advising him not to speak until she had got back. But something was going on, for Dudley kept eyeing the door Aria went through - Draco presumed to led to the kitchen. Her aunt too had been eyeing the door
'Don't get what Draco?' Aria replied though she did not look up from the book she held in her hands.
'You're right.' Draco said.
Here we go. Not even through the barrier and it had already started.
Draco once again closed his eyes, and silence greeted the room once more. Aria gave him that, the quiet and privacy of his own memories. The Patronus Charm brought of feelings and emotions that were personal - far too personal in Aria's case. If Draco wanted to share what memory he had used or thought of, then she would allow him to do so on his own accord.
At least the whispers and mindless chatter had subsided a little, or at least Aria wasn't hearing it, neither had Hermione or Ginny. Aria wondered if Draco had said something, but thought better of it. That would be completely out of character and as much as he had sworn a magical oath, she doubted it would be something he would do. Perhaps then the other students had just got bored because Aria had not risen to it.
"Dumbledore is dead. The Order is no longer safe, especially if I go there, they - The Order will be compromised."
'I got lucky,' Aria said, 'I got to choose the place I called home - and those who I call my family.'
'Well seeing as we couldn't use a Dementor,' Aria said, 'We had to settle for a Boggart instead - and no I'm not going to teach you like that. Don't even think of asking.'
As soon as they walked to the end of the seventh-floor corridor, Aria smiled, it seemed that Draco had not taken her friend's advice for long, and sure enough, Draco was walking up the staircase towards them. Aria giggled the moment he caught sight of them. Since Draco had shielded her with his wings, she felt giddy.
'Thanks for this Fleur,' Aria said, 'I really appreciate you going over all of this with me.'
'She attacked me-' Aria huffed, then smirked. 'Well tried and failed. Was boasting about setting the marquee on fire ... so wasn't hard to catch her off guard and bring her here.'
Draco took her hand and led them inside, with no furniture in place, the house looked empty and felt cold.
The months until school seemed to go somehow slower than the time before it. Dora seemed to be in a similar antsy mindset as she waited as well. Dora had told Draco the night after he meets Harry Potter that Dora was going to train to become an Auror starting in the fall. Draco had, of course, felt proud of his sister but also scared for her; being an Auror is dangerous. Dora had decided though that only fun could happen until we both went to our respective training.
"Yes, I am."
"Kids!" Mum says sternly while Dad chuckles "Draco lets get your wand."
"You are too slow brother dear" Dora teases
happened. The boys were his age and unnecessarily mean. The boys were from a pureblood elitist family and did
"I'm Harry Potter"
"Name's Ted Tonks, its nice to meet you, Harry"
"Ah-ha!" exclaims Ollivander emerging once again holding a wand box in triumph " Try this once my boy"
Dora snorts and with a mockingly soft voice says, "aw poor Dray"
After two hours, Draco had an eagle owl named Athena, a cauldron, his books, sweets, a journal, and a sketch pad.
Ollivander takes the wand out of its box and hands it over to him. Draco takes the wand and swishes it a few times.
head.
They walked to the sitting room as she tried to formulate a response that the young man, no boy really would understand. She cast her gaze down and breathed slowly trying to gather her nerve.
"Harry!" Draco greeted surprised but still smiling
Draco talked with Harry for the rest of Draco's fitting time. Draco was just about to step off the stool when the shop door chimed once again and this time it was a family member. Draco's dad walked in searching the room with his dark eyes. When grey eyes meet brown his Dad smiled at him softly and walked towards him.
His Dad huffs tension draining from his features and being replaced by humor, "The one time you decide to wake up early, Dragon, the one time"
"Nice to meet you," Draco said smiling kindly
After paying for his wand went back outside to see his family but when he got there he saw his Dad was no longer there.
"3, 2, 1" His Dad announces
"Can we go now?" He asked turning to his parents and sister with an excited smile
"Andromeda! Dora! He's down here" His Dad called upstairs not looking away from Draco
Draco blinks at the boy in surprise "I don't think so. Dad told me it was an old artifact from the founders themselves."
Harry, Ron, and Draco talked for the rest of the train ride. Ron seemed to try and make up for the uncomfortable conversations about his family he had initiated. For the most part, they were left alone except when the trolley came and later a bushy-haired girl looking for someone's toad.
After reading the note she had tears running down her face and looked down at the bundle, gently picked it up, and moved the cloth to see a small face. The face although round like any baby's face was somehow also quite pointed and much thinner than her own child at this age. A small tuft of soft white silvery blonde hair was atop it's- no
In elegant cursive was written
"Oh," Ron started sounding confused "I wasn't sure if you were because you don't have the same last name"
Draco smiled brightly sitting down in the offered spot and saw the red-headed boy looking back at him
"Yes" the boy confirms
After a few moments, Madam Malkin comes over and drapes a huge robe over my head and starts pinning it to fit. A few minutes into it the door chime announcing another customer.
"Here you go dear," Mum handed him a plate of eggs and toast, "when you finish we are going to shop for supplies"
Harry, Draco, and Ron talk with each other for a few minutes when a ghost pops out of the wall. Surprised shouts call throughout the room and Draco shrieks. grabbing onto Harry's arm. Harry smiles at him reassuringly, reaching across himself with the arm not being clutched in Draco's hand, placing his hand on Draco's.
"I am here for a wand" Draco responded feeling a little silly for having to answer that question in a
"Yeah my sister went to Hogwarts, she graduated last year."
"Harry Potter"
Draco was not liking this, he had found a seat when his family had hugged(and cried) while telling him goodbyes and telling him to write but then
After she left nervously excited conversations slowly started in a small room. Draco had heard of Professor McGonagall before. Dora liked her even though she was
Draco ate his breakfast, listening to the conversations between his family occasionally putting in his input. He tried to eat fast but when he did his mother looked at him fondly and said 'Diagon Alley will still be there even if you take a little longer to eat'. Draco took that for the 'slow down' that it was. Twenty minutes after getting his breakfast he was finally finished. With a bounce in his step, he got up from his chair and brought the plate to the sink.
"Yeah, we are but I got both last names," Draco replies feeling uncomfortable
"Shut up!" Ron yells at the boy and Harry, who while Nott had been speaking had gotten angrier and angrier, glared at him.
"Understandable, My sister says she was too"
"I'm fine," Draco said shakily, smiling at the boy to try and convince him of the words; based on the look both Ron and Harry gave him it didn't work.
Draco and his family walk through the station ignoring the odd and dirty looks of the muggles and even some wizards(pureblood assholes) send their way. Draco acts like he can't see them while talking animatedly with Dora.
"Hello, are you excited for school?" Draco asks
robes. Draco sat there staring at him for a minute thinking 'holy shit I have been talking to Harry Potter' on repeat when he snapped out of it. Draco looked at Harry and saw how uncomfortable the boy looked and smiled at him.
The whole Great Hall erupted in cheers. Ron grumbled about his siblings tricking him while Harry looked nervous.
Narcissa Malfoy was not a stupid woman. When she cast the spell and it confirmed her fears that, the worst thing to happen in a war, she was pregnant. It wasn't that the child scared her but of what the war and side its parents chose would do that did. She knew her husband, Lucius,  was a cruel man and would not shelter the child from himself and his choices. Standing in her room, terrified and alone, she came to a decision one that she would both be proud of and regret; she was going to hide the child away.  She thought of many options from running away with her child to giving it to a muggle orphanage but knew that wouldn't work. if she ran away Lucius would search for her and an orphan would such a cruel fate as well as tempting to take the child back. She after an hour of heartbreaking thoughts a decision making came up with a plan and who to go to.
"Your sister?"
"Thank you" The boy sighed in relief still smiling at him
"It doesn't matter. Plenty of people are like that too, you'll be fine"  Draco comforted and the boy smiled at him
"Come along first years" McGonagall waved them forward
A couple of students later, he heard "Draco Black-Tonks!" called McGonagall. Draco sat for a second frozen in fear, Ron pushed him forward though and he snapped out of it. Shakily Draco walked to the hat and sat on the stool gripping it so tight his hands started to hurt. The hat was placed on his head and he heard the hat speak, whether in his head or not he wasn't sure.
"No," Draco snorts "I'm pretty sure that would be a nightmare"
Walking towards them the boy sneers at Ron and Draco introducing himself "Theodore Nott," the boy points to the two large boys behind him "Crabbe and Goyle"
Harry turns them around and ignores Nott's stuttering responses.
"Ah! Nymphadora's brother?" Ollivander asks walking into the maze of shelves once again
The light changes as he goes from the artificial light of King's Cross to the magic light of Platform 9 3/4. Dora, Mum, and Dad come through seconds later smiling brightly at him.
"What sorts us?" Harry smiles at him patiently
"Ok, stand on the stool next to this gentleman please," Madam Malkin says gesturing in Draco's direction
"Are you ok?" Draco asked concerned that he was judging the 'not all wizards' part
"Muggle"
"What is?" Draco asked
Draco always found it entertaining how much Dora hated her first name. Everyone that Draco had ever met of his sister's friends called her Tonks. No one used her full name, except for Mum because Mum gives zero fucks and always says "Nymphadora I named you. I can and will call you by your
Harry glares harder and says "I can do that myself, thanks" spitting the words at the boy
By the time finally came to head to King's Cross, Draco was told more information about his family's time at Hogwarts then he thought he still didn't know. His Dad went to grab the portkey as his Mum fussed over his trunk. Dad walks back into the room holding an old goblet out to his family when close. Draco puts a hand on the goblet and prepares for it to activate.
Regulus, bless him, seemed to notice her distress and put a comforting hand on her back.
"Little Dragon?" His Mum asks sounding hopeful
Behind Dora, Mum and Dad walked towards their children. Mum looked unimpressed while Dad looked amused.
fairy wing core. You will be a great wizard Mr. Black-Tonks and one that is a terrific protector." Olivander explained
"Mother is traveling for a few weeks," Regulus waved her in "What is it you wish to ask me?"
"Draco, sir. My name is Draco Black-Tonks."
"Ok. Bye Harry, see you at school" Draco says walking with his Dad to the door with a hand waving goodbye
Dad lets go of Draco and Mum kisses his check.
"I won't" Draco promises
"Yes, but also nervous"
"Why?" Regulus asked but did not sound as if she would not help
The next couple minutes felt much too long with the clock ticking by the seconds. Draco started taping his feet waiting for his sister and Mum. Only about five minutes which felt like an hour did his mother make an appearance.
"Hello, dear. I have something to ask of you if you may let me in. Is your mother around?" Narcissa responded, all grace and soft
Draco normally was not opposed to mornings but when you are woken up by a pale of ice water being splashed on you, well you become cranky.
"Wake up Little Dragon!" His sister yelled laughter laced through her voice "It is time for school shopping!"
On a sunny day in June, a doorbell rings in the Black-Tonks household. Little Nymphadora runs to the door and swings it open seeing no one but when she looks down for a package perhaps she sees a bundle with a note on top with her mother’s name.
"Are you ok Cissa?" he asked his normally aloof, posh voice going soft and caring.
"What do you need me to do? I am too young to take care of the child if that is what you are asking" He looked confused and terrified at her
The boy obeys and the seamstress starts tailoring his robes. They are all silent for a moment until Draco breaks it.
"yeah" Ron starts, chuckling "All the first years with no training'
"Another Weasley!" the ghost comments
"Morning Mum" Draco hugged back, squeezing her tight
The noise was silenced when an old battered brown hat started to sing:
"I am plenty of fun!"
Draco got up at these words, he had been looking forward to school ever since Dora had explained it to him. He was still wet and he decided as much as he loves his sister she deserves payback.
"I just- I don't know anyone magic. I grew up without it" The boy said sounding sad and
"we would blow up the Great Hall" Draco chuckles
Draco was about to give up and just spend his train ride in the walkway of the train when he spotted a compartment that was not full. Inside was two boys one a gangly redhead and the other a black haired bespeckled one. He hurried to the compartment, opening the door, and recognized one of the boys, it was Harry Potter.
"Ron Weasley"
Draco lit up but was dimmed when the hat continued
Draco took several deep breaths and then walked towards the door. The old shop looked cluttered and dusty once inside. The shelves were behind a desk and perpendicular to the door with wand boxes haphazardly shoved within them.  Draco walked carefully up to the desk feeling as though creeping through a library and not wanting to ruin the quiet. The desk itself was cluttered with several wand boxes and strung with papers. Hidden beneath a couple of papers was a bell, the kind at restaurants that you ring to grab someone's attention, and Draco reached out and pressed the small thing.
"You weren't in bed when Dora went to wake you up" His Dad explains
the hat stated,
first name.
"Let us start the sorting" McGonagall called silencing the room
Just as Draco was about to protest once again, the hat called out, for everyone to hear
"What's left?" Draco asks
Between Platforms 9 and 10 his Mum and Dad smile and tell him to run through first. Draco has of course been to the platform when dropping Dora off but for some unknown reason now that it is his turn to be going on the train his nerves are present. Taking a breath Draco runs towards the wall flinching slightly when his body expects to hit a wall.
"Good morning, Draco" Dad smiled sat at the table, newspaper in hand
"Don't be absurd. Knowledge of the wizarding world does not determine your house. Also, my sister was a Hufflepuff" Draco responded to the boy and Ron nodded in agreement
"Race you!" Dora challenges and starts to run
“Oh, good,” Regulus breathed out in obvious relief “ I will help you”
"Got your wand?" Mum asked
"I will be ok. I- I am pregnant, Regulus. I can not force a child into this war especially not with Lucius as a father." she spoke trying to make her voice not tremble
Breakfast is heavenly large fluffy pancakes with whip cream, strawberries, and honey. Draco eats as his family tells him more about Hogwarts. His Dad tells him all about potions and how he thinks like himself Draco would be good at the subject. Dad loves baking and when he went to Hogwarts he found that they were similar while his Mum thinks that sentiment is insane but his Dad refuses to relent.
Draco startled back at the sound. A second later, a man with crazy grey hair appeared from within the shelves and seemed to glide instead of walk to the desk.  Draco gaped at the man for a minute still in shock.
She gaped at him as his soaked pajamas got her clothes wet as well.
"Sure!" Harry answered moving over slightly to make room for him
Once to the bathroom, he locks the door laughing as he hears Dora cursing at him through the door "Love you too Dora"
"He had to stop at the bank. Nymphadora and I have to go grab a few things. Will you be ok on your own in there?" Mum asks pointing to Madam Malkin's
Draco gets on the train to Hogwarts and meets more people
"So your family are all wizards?"
Nott continues speaking, looking towards Draco and Ron, not giving anyone time to respond "Ah redhead and poor," he pretends to think  "A Weasley. Boy, you would think there were enough of those already and the half-blood," he sneers at him more disgusted with his blood status than the wealth of the Weasley's "well you shouldn't even be here."
like Draco one bit. So here he was walking down the train trying not to scream or cry while attempting to find a new compartment but, because the universe loved him, everywhere was full.
Andromeda Black-Tonks appears from the kitchen and walks to the door thanking her daughter on the way.
his suspicions were confirmed when Harry smiled and greeted the man with an enthusiastic "Hagrid!"
"Bye" Harry responds smiling
"Hi Dragon" Dad greets ruffling Dracos hair
Draco had never talked of it again. Draco knew that his Mum's side of the family was cruel and mean to her. She used to bitterly call it
Hagrid leads the first years to the lake and separates the students into the many boats onshore. Hagrid puts, to his delight, Draco with Harry, Ron, and a chubby blonde boy named Neville. Harry looks around marveling at everything and Draco can't help but watch the boy and his reactions. Draco looks for himself at the castle that will be his home for the next seven years and can't help but smile. The castle is truly a marvel, his family was right when they called Hogwarts beautiful.
“Bellatrix?” Regulus hissed
The bushy-haired girl had not seemed impressed with the three of them as far as Draco could tell. Ron was trying to show Harry and Draco a spell his brothers had taught him when she came in and asked about a toad.
The hat responds
The morning of the train Draco woke up on his own with no Dora Dad or Mum shaking him awake. He looked at the alarm clock and saw a large 8:15 blinking at him in the early morning light. He was so excited he had woken himself up at eight in the morning instead of the planned nine. Stretching, Draco headed towards the bathroom. After a shower and brushing his teeth he went downstairs hoping to get a little extra time with Dora or his parents. When he got downstairs however all the lights were off and it seemed that no one was awake. Walking to the kitchen Draco looked at the time and saw that no one was in it, no Mum making breakfast or Dad reading the paper. Draco thought maybe they wanted to sleep in so he walked to the living room and curled up on his dad's chair to read until they came down.
"You got a head start!"
"Hello, I am Professor McGonagall" The witch greeted, "We ask for you to wait here until we are ready for you. When we are you will go through the doors and get sorted. The sorting is important as while you are here your Hogwarts house will be your friends and family. Welcome to Hogwarts"
"Well no, but my Mum and Dad are"
Mum reminds him of the number of robes that he needs and sends him on his way.
. Draco was pushed and almost trampled more than once. He was stopped from falling by Harry catching his shoulders and both Harry and Ron had to be moved out of people's path by Draco. Safe to say the first trail of being a student at Hogwarts was not being trampled on the way to the school itself.
When the ghost leaves a boy off to the side speaks "So it is true, Harry Potter is at Hogwarts"
"Well, let's see," Dad starts checking the list "a wand and robes. Not too much left"
Draco recognized the last name, it was the name of a large pureblood family.
Draco responded immediately, Dora had told him of them they were mean and hated people like him
"Amazing," Ollivander whispered amazed
Dad blinks at him looking blank for a moment, the face he does when confused or surprised before he smiles warmly at the dark-haired boy.
"Go and get your wand. We will wait for you here" Dad encouraged
Mum grabbed his hand and brought him to the fireplace, Dad and Dora following behind us. At the fireplace, his Mum reminded him to be clear when speaking and ruffled his hair.
"What?" Draco asked "I'm sorry I wasn't listening"
Draco's dad read both wizard and muggle newspapers but tended to switch based on what came first on any given day.
“Mom! A package has come for you!” She yells heading back to her blocks to build a tower
"I didn't cheat"
The way she said it suggested that in her childhood it was something she was told quite often. His mother didn't like to talk about her side of the family or her childhood.
Hagrid takes them through the grounds, the entrance hall, and into a small room they were told was just off from the Great Hall. Waiting for them in the room was a severe-looking witch. the witch was dressed in emerald green robes with square glasses perched on her nose and long black hair pulled into such a tight bun that it pulled her face up slightly.
"Hi" the three of them respond, Draco still feeling jumpy
so yes I did put him in Slytherin. I was debating Ravenclaw or Slytherin but I choose Slytherin. I am under the impression that being raised right would not affect the fact that Draco is a Slytherin. Slytherin does not equal a bad person after all. Also, I think it would add some  ~ drama ~
Draco turned to point out that he was right, it was an artifact but his sentence died on his lips when he saw how fascinated Harry looked and turned back to the hat.
Draco asks
“No!” Narcissa nearly sobbed in horror “Andromeda and Ted was who I meant”
"Draco Black-Tonks," Draco responded smiling at the boy
The Tonks family goes out to Diagon Alley for Draco's supplies and Draco and Harry meet.
"Hello, dear. Hogwarts too?" Madam Malkin asks the boy
Walking into the house Narcissa replied, " I need you to help me find a way to get away from my husband for a time."
"Tonks? ah the trouble-making Hufflepuff is your sister" the ghost asks, Draco nods in response
"What- Dad?" Draco startles still completely confused
Getting off the train, was a
"Dora!" Draco sputtered angrily at his older sister
"Draco, its time to go home. Dora and your Mum will meet us there" Dad states
"Ron Weasley." The boy, Ron, introduced
"Harry, my boy!" Hagrid responds in a booming voice just as enthusiastic as Harry
"You are a dirty rotten cheater" Draco huffs
"Wheres Mum?" Draco looked around the kitchen for his dark-haired mother
"Come on, Little Dragon. We need to find you a set" His Mum says eyes suspiciously wet
The Great Hall was incredible, Draco thought it was something he might never get used to seeing. The ceiling looked as though it didn't exist with the sky and stars visible and candles floating in the air. Draco heard the girl from the train, Hermione talks about 'Hogwarts: A History' and how the ceiling was spelled to look like the sky.
He shakes his leg so hard that the quills on his desk vibrate. After spending a dozen or so minutes feeling as if he isn’t quite himself, isn’t quite in his body but rather levitating out his door and out the Ministry altogether, he takes the picture frame that used to house him and his friends and tosses it facedown into his desk drawer. Watching picture-Harry shift from foot to foot and look so profoundly uncomfortable and
"Good game!" Stella shouts over to them, extracting herself from the pile of bodies.
Harry goes down in a pile of limbs - not all of which are his.
“Then...why?”
Hermione carries on the conversation she and Draco were having outside. "Do you have young relatives...?"
Draco’s fingers twitch in his pocket out of habit, but of course he leaves it when he needs it the most. “I’m working, Potter.”
The rain has ended, and the night is so, so quiet without it.
Harry half-laughs with relief. “That’s an understatement. Don’t worry, okay? He wasn’t mad at me about that.”
The two teams meet in the middle, like in the beginning, and congratulate each other - no feelings lost at all. Malfoy pats Harry on the back and says, "Nicely played. It seems you've stayed in shape."
“Eight.”
Draco turns back, so he’s facing the open stretch of stars once again. When he quiets his breath, he fancies he can feel a slight movement beneath him: the slow rise and fall of Glyder Fawr’s slumber.
Ron suddenly looks even more serious than he did earlier - if that's even possible. "I wish. We need you back in the office. We're having an emergency staff meeting in an hour, and it's a big one this time. Robards'll seriously be pissed if you skip."
But resentment is familiar, and it enfolds Draco’s heart easily.
"But-yes. I specialize in jazz piano, and that's what I play at the club."
“Yeah,” he breathes.
“Hm?”
Harry has never been a very religious person. Wizards aren’t really religious in general - though they celebrate Christmas - and Harry got enough of a taste from his time with the devout Aunt Marge in his youth to turn him off from it. But now, as he’s sprinting through the halls of the Ministry toward the apparition point, he feels himself praying, hoping, wanting to believe that his suspicions aren’t correct. That the twisting feeling in his gut is wrong for the first time in his life.
Neither men hesitate; it's like seeing that flash of gold ignites something old inside of them, some kind of muscle memory or instinct that they'd forgotten about until now. They push their brooms forward faster and faster and faster, until they're neck and neck. The Snitch flutters ahead of them still, but the gap between it and them grows smaller and smaller, until Harry's fingertips are brushing against its smooth metal body.
His Dad has always been a baker and taught both Dora and him how to as well but Draco unlike Dora liked and was good at the hobby. Dora talked about the pranks and trouble she made, while most she had told to him before it was nice to listen to her once again. Mum rolled her eyes at Dad and Dora telling Draco not to cause trouble. She talked about dances and her meeting Dad.
"We should get you a cat!" Dora exclaims
With a heavy heart, Narcissa set out to her cousins. A man who similar to her had lost faith in the Death Eater cause but still followed. When she knocked on the door of the old house she was meet by a familiar face, Regulus Black. The boy was quite similar to his older Gryffindor brother with his dark hair and grey eyes but unlike him, Regulus was stern and serious.
A while later Draco and the other two boys got into their school robes and sat back down. They resumed talking and joking around until the train's loud whistle blew. When the train stopped and announced their arrival at Hogwarts, Draco was practically bouncing with excitement and the only thing he could think was 'This year was going to be tons of fun'.
"I can only have one pet and I just got an owl, Dora" Draco chuckles at his sister
"That is what I was trying to tell him" Ron jumped in
"You are no fun Dray"
Draco smiles sheepishly "Sorry, I woke up early"
By the end of the summer, Draco was feeling quite done with his family but also filled with nerves and excitement for school and making new friends. Draco never really had friends, he had Dora and his parents but he didn't have anyone out of his family that he was close to. Dora had promised to go to the platform with their parents and not embarrass him
"Oh, so no tests?" Harry asks sounding hopeful
"Nice to meet you too Draco" Harry replied smiling back
"Diagon Alley!" he spoke and the world became a green haze
Draco nodded at her and headed over, stepping on the step stool to the left.
Dora grumbled hearing her full name and agrees to grab the ingredients.
Up the wall, a huge split appears showing out into the alley and Ollivander takes the wand from him quickly. Draco stares at the split in dumbfounded shock until another wand is thrust into his hand.
"I'll be fine" Draco reassured
If looks could kill Nott would have holes drilled through his skull from both Ron and Harry. Draco felt, unforgivingly, like he was going to cry. Draco had started shaking and he clenched his fists hoping to stop the shaking, it didn't work.
(See the end of the chapter for
When she opens the door she sees the bundle and takes the note tested on top.
CRACK
"Oh, um I think-" Draco started but was cut off by Ron
badly.
"Oh" the boy sounded so disappointed
Regulus stared at her for a few moments looking so much like a lost child that Narcissa wanted to walk away and leave him alone but she knew he was her best choice at the moment. She could go to Severus but no one was ever sure what side he was on or like her was in between, Regulus was like her and she knew she could trust him with this.
Smirking he walked towards her as she was jumping around singing Hogwarts school song and hugged her tightly.
Harry walked forward looking nervous, when he sat down he gripped the stool. After a few minutes the hat called out "GRYFFINDOR!" and the entire table with red and gold coloring erupted into cheers. People screamed and hollered and Draco thought he heard someone yelling "WE GOT POTTER! WE GOT POTTER!" Draco just sighed, he wasn't going to be in the same house as his friend. Maybe Ron would get the same house as him? but more than likely not as Weasleys normally get Gryffindor.
The door chimes again as they leave the store with Dad offering an arm for Draco to take. Draco takes his arm and prepares for the squeeze and pull feel of apparating. With a soft POP, the world goes blurry.
I am so glad people seem to like this story! I will try to keep doing speedy updates. My plan is to update one chapter each week as the chapters will be getting longer.
Harry bought everything on the trolley leaving Ron and Draco to gape at him but Harry was kind and seemed to have always intended to share.
“Ok. But who will you leave the child with?” Regulus asked
"Potter? oh we haven't had one of you guys in awhile" the ghost says ominously, not commenting on his popularity
Draco didn't often feel out of place in his family but when people pointed this fact out it always made him squirm a bit, he knew he was different but didn't need a reminder. His Mum always said that it made sense he got both last names as he was such a mix of both sides of the family, Tonks, and Black. His Mum had dark hair and soft grey eyes while his Dad had blonde hair and dark eyes but Draco had white silvery blonde hair and molten silver-grey eyes. Dora had dark eyes and brown hair(when it wasn't violently pink). He was white and silver to his sister's gold and bronze.
"It doesn't matter because neither of you should be running." Mum chided
"Fred and George says it will hurt a lot" Ron interrupts
"Not many witch or wizards have two cores in their wand Mr. Black-Tonks but you do. This is a 10 inch Hawthorn wood wand with Unicorn tail hair
"Let's make some breakfast. Nymphadora could you grab ingredients to make pancakes from the pantry?"
The world goes blurry as the portkey starts to travel them. Draco feels the telltale feeling of free falling and stomach-dropping. Suddenly the world returns to clear and bright as Draco looks around he sees the portkey entrance point as a short wizard yells 'Tonks House Arrived'.
"Yeah, I'm here. Just being lovingly suffocated by Dad bear." Draco jokes
The ghost smiles and waves moving on to another group yelling about 'Seeing them in Hufflepuff'.
Shopping with his family Draco found was often both full of fun and pain. Diagon Alley has always been a happy place for Draco and his family. Dora, Dad, and himself would make jokes until Mum wanted to duck tape our mouths shut. Draco and Dora would run around causing to much trouble and eating too much candy.
"Tonks? Like Nymphadora?" Ron questioned stumbling over his sister's first name
"You too Mr. Tonks" Harry smiles seemingly pleased with the minimal reaction his name brought
Caught up in his book Draco didn't notice the panic going on upstairs about twenty minutes later until the book was taken from his hand. The abrupt absence of the book from his hands startled Draco into looking up. When he does he sees his Dad looking frazzled and new relief with panic slowly draining from his eyes.
"You are a little shit brother." Dora scoffed fondly "Now get ready so we can go, Mum is making breakfast"
Draco looks up to think it might be his parents or Dora done with their errands but instead, a boy walks into the stop. The boy is around his age with messy black hair and bright green eyes with circular glasses. The boy looks around the room seeming completely lost until Madam Malkin stops with Draco and greets him.
"Hello, " She consulted the note once again "Draco Regulus Black-Tonks. Welcome home little dragon."
"Are you Madam Malkin?" Draco asked the women
"Morning Little Dragon" his mother smiled and hugged him
It had been the hardest thing she had ever had to do.
'You OK Aria, because your head has been dropping since we sat down?'
His father looked quite the opposite, but he does not say anything on the matter.
Draco shook his head, the simple touch had been what Aria wanted, it hadn't taken Aria much to get things the way she wanted them - Draco certainly wasn't going to argue nor was his father. His mother had tried, but Aria had not fallen for any cunning tactics to try and change her mind. As Draco turned back towards the window - something orange ... something bright - caught his attention and Draco was on his feet rushing out of the door. Draco sprinted through the Manor halls and out into the gardens...
'Ready for what exactly?' Draco clarified.
"There are other memories I wish for you to see, my dear."
'But-' Draco added once Aria had given him her undivided attention, 'I ask that you trust me, for you're not knowing what is it until - well you'll see.'
'Just how many Malfoys will I be meeting over Christmas?'
Aria shocked her head. "He bullied and kept the tokens of his victims. That's why Dumbledore wanted us to see that particular memory. The Dark Lord wouldn't contain his soul in any old thing. It would be meaningful."
"Drop the pretenses and let me in Potter," Draco murmured, nodding towards the door. "I came to see how you were, you looked ill throughout dinner and you didn't eat much."
Aria blinked at him, and something about her bemused expression made Draco add without thinking, 'I want to bond with you! Not break up!'
'And then there was the announcement of our engagement,' Aria said, 'I didn't get a choice in it - I never had a chance to tell everyone before it went out -'
'Same reason I chose to return as Quidditch Captain, I guess - we were plain crazy.' Aria said.
Dudley grabbed what was clearly Potter's bag, placed it in the car, then did the same with Draco's looked around before he whispered, and even though the Muggle looked terrified, his voice had a threatening sound to it, 'Aria has told me a lot about you - so I'm going to make this clear only once - Aria has had enough shit to deal with, so if you in anyway wreck this holiday for her - or if you upset my cousin in any way, I'll kick your arse.'
'I'm fine.'
For the first time in ages, Malfoy smirked. Though this time she could tell that he was slightly impressed.
'Wow.'
Draco entered upon her shout, she had bathed he could from the way her hair was dripping wet. She also looked like she had been getting ready to settle in for the night, as she was wearing one of the long dressing gowns his mother had left for her.
Hermione frowned, Aria could see slight disapproval in Ron's choice of words, but she understood, and if it meant her best friend had finally got gest that compatible magic wasn't making the decisions for her, she would damn well take it.
She crossed the room once more, picking up the bag she had brought with her, she had meant to be staying the night ... Aria was grateful that this had happened because staying in the house Hermione had been tortured in was completely different from being there for a few hours ... no matter if the Manor felt like Draco's magic. Aria reached around and unzipped the silver ball dress, letting it fall to the floor, and pulled off her high-heels, she rummaged for the Muggle clothing she had packed and began to change into them hastily, she changed over her shoes, and shoved the dress into her bag and was about to leave the room when she noticed how ridiculous she looked - her hair still tied up into an elegant knot and make-up still applied. Aria crossed the room once more, and sat on the dresser-stool, she removed the make-up first. She removed the contact-lenses replacing them with her glasses, and just pulled out the elegant hair-knot when the knock upon the door came. The person had not waited for her to call out, the door opened ... and Aria's mouth fell shut as she caught sight of Narcissa Malfoy.
.........
Mrs Weasley let her after a few moments, 'Oh what a lovely bracelet,' she gave a thoughtful look, 'Bill has one - similar, not so feminine, but definitely like it.' she shook her head, as though she's had lost her original trail of thought. Which she had done, and Aria knew that, by what Mrs Weasley asked her next. 'Now, family dinner at seven on Friday, Ron and Hermione will have returned, and should be up for a get together by then, you'll be there, won't you?'
Draco opened his eyes, eyebrows arched up into a questioning look, 'What do you think I'm trying to do?'
'Maybe ... not sure,' Draco said offhandedly, they were sitting in the armchairs of the eight-year common room again, 'Has anyone interesting entered it?'
'Girl, who is at the door?'
'Do you need us to get you anything?' Ginny asked.
"Whoever said I couldn't cast them." Aria raised her eyebrows. "Doesn't know me very well. Now, do you want to take down the dark evil wizard terrorizing your families or not?"
'But each rune has a specific meaning ... yes?' Aria asked.
"Surely -"
Aria glanced over her book to give him a pointed look.
'What the hell is he doing here?'
Aria seemed hesitant, and with all the Muggles walking around it wasn't like she could just use magic. She glanced once more time to double-check, but it was apparent Dudley and Emily would not be returning any time soon. Wordlessly Aria handed him the bottle from her bag and turned her back was to him. Draco dried his hands on his towel and sat down on the sunbed. Aria, he noticed was trembling and her fisted-hand gripped at the towel underneath her.
'Right well, you know the drill.'
Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Seamus tried to defend those they could. Ron was no teacher, he was no leader and he certainly wasn't Aria. Not for the first time having been forced into returning to Hogwarts Ron wished that Hermione was there. There was no doubt in his mind that she would work out what was going on. Especially why Draco Malfoy was so protective of Aria now, he was always with her. His mother has told him that Aria would have protection of some sort. Goyle and Crabbe had been no match. Ron was certain they could take on the other Slytherins guarding Aria, even if they were Draco Malfoy and Snape's daughter at Aria's side.
'Draco!' Aria called, though, her voice sounded distant it was urgent. 'Draco!'
Aria sensed Voldemort was not exactly pleased.
'I know.' Aria said, pocketing the wand. Back when she first heard them, she hadn't known just how big of a deal the actual words had meant. Things were different now, she understood a lot more.
'What the hell do you think?'
Aria didn't even hesitate, she didn't even need to stop and think of the answer, 'Yes.'
'You can go back now,' Aria said, and she waited for them all to return to their respective houses, 'I think that one was a little too easy - so I'll think we'll actually start this off with - if you love Quidditch jump into the white square.'
'Oh mine was really good, Gran's like a different person - can't stop telling me how proud she is.' Neville said.
'And I'm grateful,' Aria said, placing a hand on his shoulder, 'but please be careful what you say. Though I doubt Draco would try to hurt you.' she shook her head, she did not want to think of the look upon Draco Malfoy's face the night Dumbledore died. He couldn't kill then, and she doubted he was a killer now.
'You wait until you find a compatible match you like ... you wait.'
New Year's Eve brought another family gathering and Draco was less than impressed. Aria looked radiant in her midnight blue dress, but he hardly had any time with her to himself; Cygnus, however, had taken up any chance he could get to talk to her.
'Mrs - Narcissa,' Aria changed the way she was about to address Draco's mother, very quickly when she noticed the disappointment Mrs Malfoy's look gave her. 'Draco said that - he believed that -'
Aria winked at him as the classroom door opened breaking up the murmured gasp at her words.
'Dammit, Aria.' Draco hissed. He dropped his quill and pulled out the bracelet he had once given her from his bag, and looked at it, hoping for some inspiration. Why couldn't she just have stopped when he called out after her, he would have gone after her if Weasley and Granger had not blocked his way. There was so much he wanted to tell her, and he was never going to have the chance to ... she meant so much to him now.
Aria took a breath, they had been attempting the Patronus Charm for the last two nights now, and Draco was already beginning to get frustrated with it. How had Remus kept his cool with her when she had demanded to try again and again until she got it right, she will never know. But Aria understood Draco's frustration, but it wasn't like he was going to get it on his first try and Remus had told her not everyone could produce a Patronus.
'Hey, he looks oddly like Malfoy.' Ron said.
'I have conditions,' Aria replied quickly, a little too quickly. Malfoy courting her might be the best way out of this, but that didn't mean she would let them run or change anything about her or her life. 'If I agree to this. Ma - your son,' she stopped herself from calling him Malfoy before it was too late to disrespected them within their own home. Though she could not bring herself to call him by his first name. 'Is not - not to insult my friends. I don't want to hear it, any of it. One word, one insult and I call this off.' Aria said as firmly as she could manage. 'I don't care what I have to give you instead Mrs Malfoy, but I can promise you I won't be marrying - courting or in any way shape or form, be in a relationship with your son.'
"They probably felt the defenses would be weakest then, My Lord," Aria replied truthfully, after all it would have been exactly what she would have done.
'It is the same in some species,' Fleur said.
She did relax as he applied more lotion on her back. She moved her head for him so it could apply some to the back of her neck. And he relished the momentary bliss as his hands swept across her skin - only to frown when he caught sight of what looked like scratches near the base of her back. As her two piece suit had moved to reveal them. Draco then realised that they were not mere scratches but scars.
Eternal love ... pure eternal love. The runes on her bracelet were not just that of protection but of the promises of everything he wanted to give her. Her heartfelt like it was going to burst and despite the embarrassment, Draco had caused her to feel, she couldn't find it within herself to be angry with him. Aria gulped as her eyes searched for the place Draco had been sitting in across the hall, until - she spotted him, Draco had been watching her, had been watching her reaction. Aria forgot everything, she forgot the hundreds of people were in the hall, she didn't listen to the whispers going on around her. Aria got to her feet, they carried her without thinking, without stopping ... the Slytherin table was steps away, Draco Malfoy looking at her ... several more steps and stormy grey eyes met hers, she sat in the empty place next to him. Aria did the only thing she could think of, she kissed him. The catcalls brought her attention back to reality and she tried to hide her face in her hands, Draco chuckled deeply as he pulled her hands away from her face.
'Homenum Revelio!'
'That's not going to make being in public any easier,' Blaise said, 'or being back at Hogwarts.'
'No,' Aria replied, shaking her head, 'It doesn't. One of my best friends is Muggle-born and she's the best in our year.'
'See you.'
'Quite all right,' his mother said sweetly, sparing a glance in his father's direction, stopping him from contradicting her, 'we've not been waiting long - no harm is done - a simple warming charm has kept the food warm, be sure to help yourself to as much as you want, Aria.'
'Remember I told you my school got attacked,' Dudley nodded, 'it's always the same thing D, night after night. I can see the Great Hall - where we would usually have our meals - just only it's full of bodies D, dead bodies. The lives I should have saved.'
Hermione bit her lip, 'It must have been an accident.'
Aria sat up and wrapped her covers around her more tightly, she couldn't stop herself from shivering. She had only been back at number four Privet Drive for a few days, but away from Hogwarts for over a week, Aria had not wanted to return to Privet Drive but she had after-all said she would help out, it didn't mean she liked being stuck back in her old bedroom - even if Dudley had finally cleared out all his old broken toys. Aria shivered once more, Epsilon stuck her head up from her basket, her grey head tilted to its side almost in a questioning manner.
Aria spun around, though she knew no harm would come to her, she was slightly surprised to hear the voice. Mrs Malfoy looked as elegant as she always did, Aria raised an eyebrow questionably, for Mrs Malfoy had come alone.
Thank you for sending the documentation I needed,
Her wand had been returned to her. But it had been restricted. Aria had been told she was only allowed to cast the basic of magic, meaning she could defend herself but only with the disarming charm or the shield charm or minor jinxes. Aria got so good at the shielding charm she was able to cast in non-verbally perfectly within a matter of days.
'You're getting really good at that!'
'I'll go. But only for a few days. D said the funeral was the Thursday, the week before Christmas.'
'How do you know that the compatible magic is not clouding your judgment!'
"Well, at least we know it works," Draco said also breathing heavily.
Draco bit back a groan. OK, he took it back, she had no sense at all.
'You'll let me know if you need anything though?'
'Like I'm going to fall asleep on this death trap!'
'I do not exactly fancy finding out that you've collapsed, Aria.' Draco said firmly, he then tilted his head towards the dummy, 'Reckon I stand a chance at winning this?'
Draco nodded his acknowledgment, he didn't trust himself to reply without sneering or insulting Granger like he used to, but like Granger, he would be civil... for Aria.
'He'll get over it,' came a voice from beside her, Aria turned to find Pansy Parkinson looking in the same direction, Aria had been. 'He's just feeling a bit ... wounded -'
Aria blinked, of course, Voldemort would be mad at him, no wonder Snape had been tortured, if he had kept this a secret, Aria never even knew that Snape had a daughter, Aria turned to Draco silently. This was their chance and only chance before Hogwarts. If Snape was truly on her side. Even though Dumbledore could no longer be saved, other lives could.
'I can't ...' Aria interrupted, 'I'm babysitting.'
The morning of departure, Draco had yet to find Aria, a bit of panic set in for he had not been able to sense her magic either. When Aria failed to not turn up for breakfast, Draco went in search of her. When he found her, Aria was standing by the lake, staring at the Hogwarts as though she was trying to absorb every detail she could so she could commit it to memory.
'Yes, I did,' Aria replied.
'Alana,' Aria said calmly, 'my current state has nothing to do with the amount I've taken on. I just haven't been sleeping well, that's all.'
Draco closed his mouth, the portrait had swung open, Aria walked in with Weasley and Granger naturally by her side. Longbottom had joined them, along with Finnigan and Thomas. It didn't take him long to figure out what they were talking about.
Hermione's hand covered her mouth, Ron blinked in surprise.
An Army more like. Aria thought. "I helped some younger students learn some spells when our last professor would not teach us, My Lord."
"The young masters, Goyle, and Crabbe will join Draco as added protection, I'm sure other Slytherins hoping to win my favour will join them. Headmaster Snape will be reporting on your progress. Miss Snape will be joining you within the Slytherin dorms. I only do this for your safety. Protection is necessary under the circumstances, your safety is very important to me, precious one. " he said.
'Yes, Kreacher.'
Dinner, fortunately, passed without further mishaps, mostly because it had been spent in silence. More than once his hand hovered towards his wand beneath his robes, waiting for the attack or outburst that never came. Even his mother glanced several times between Potter and his father, no doubt thinking along the same lines as himself.
'I just don't feel like eating.' Aria found herself being somewhat honest with Mrs Weasley. It was rather strange though, she hadn't had this problem while she had been with Draco at the Manor, Aria had no problems there when she thought about it. She rubbed at her forehead willing the headache to go away.
Aria was - startled by the question. Hermione and Ginny had been next on her list. Ginny had pretty much asked the same questions Ron had. But she had not been expecting the question Hermione asked. It was not as though she had to think of the answer, Aria knew that already.
Of course, Aria's godson - no wonder her magic was protecting him.
Aria's eyes found his in the mirror, a hint of understanding in her eyes. She had realised that he had been willing to earn her trust back, to earn her forgiveness. Draco paused his task for a few moments and took from his robe pocket and pulled out her bracelet, for he had been meaning to return it to her since she had returned to her own home.
Andromeda had felt awkward going to Malfoy Manor, so Draco had instead ended up in a humble house. His mother and aunt were currently drinking tea watching in slight amusement at Aria's antics. Who was sprawled out on the floor playing with her godson, with a pile of baby toys surrounding them? The only reason Draco had joined them was that his father had gone also. Draco was sure that it was the last place his father wanted to be, but he supposed it was better than being in a small room at Saint Mungo's with the Weasleys.
Draco sighed, as Emily shared a look with Dudley. Potter looked rather pale, and as though she was about to be sick.
'Until the other competitors turn up, there is no way to tell that,' Aria said seriously, making Draco feel disappointed. 'But I have every faith that you are more than up to the challenge.'
"He was already immortal at the time, with seven pieces of his soul hidden safe, somewhere. And only he knows where those pieces are."
'It wasn't me! I didn't do this!'
Aria ran a hand through her hair, re-framing from replying, apart from Neville and Luna, occasionally Ginny, she hadn't had much support from her peers. Draco had the best excuse, for Aria had not told him when the sessions were being held but mostly because she always planned them for when he was on patrol. Ron and Hermione missed them mostly because they were too busy avoiding Goyle, so they could actually spend time together.
'Yes I found something that worked,' Aria said, 'now though, I think of my friends.'
'There was no need for that.' Granger said, 'you gave us quite a fright and Aria could have hexed him.'
'So how -?'
'I'm not happy with you right now.'
It had been a week since she actually learned from Draco exactly what spells she could cast via her wand. It was more than she actually thought she would have been allowed. More than Voldemort had told her. The reason behind that had been who had restricted her wand in the first place.
'Well, it's nice to meet you, Aria...'
It had taken her a while to sort through the books, to no avail but Aria did find a book on old laws and wizarding customs. The book made her really grateful that she lived in the times she did. Women only allowed to inherit if no male heir. A woman often had an arranged marriage, and not always with their consent. The more Aria read the more she was put off by it all. One thing, however, did catch her attention ... women at one point weren't even allowed to own a wand. Which made her remember something else she had been yearning to get an answer to, and she knew the perfect person to ask.
Mrs Weasley's look softened, 'Don't be, I - we trust you, and your judgment, but with everything after the war. And it took you a while to go to a Healer about those awful nightmares, which you also struggled to tell us about - Aria, you had been staying in Ginny's room with her, when we found that out - to hear that you had been suffering and feeling like that. I just - we just worry about you.' she sighed once more and added honestly, 'I don't like the idea of them, taking advantage of your kind nature.'
"She could be spying," Ginny said thoughtfully. "It's not like we can rely on Snape now. We know he's apart of the Death Eaters. Maybe that's why Aria needs to be there. With the Slytherins. Why she chose not to run for it. Aria does do everything for a reason."
'Don't apologise Miss Reyes.' Aria said.
Maybe winning wasn't all that important. Because it did not compare to the warmth and affection Aria's eyes held, nor did it compare with the way that her magic filled the air so intensely that caused people to turn their heads. Had people forgotten just how powerful Aria was? Aria soon noticed the stares, for a blush graced her cheeks, the warmth of her magic faltered from the air.
Malfoy and skiing turned out to be funnier than Malfoy on an aeroplane. Admittedly she herself had not fared any better but watching Draco make a fool of himself just made her day. Considering their environment, he had been a bit cagey with her since they had landed. Aria supposed she should have told him about the plane, not to have done so may have been slightly mean, but he should have told her about the announcement. Malfoy clearly was pouting, though he had not spoken to her about her little stunt. They decided to hire out everything that would need whilst skiing, though more expensive it saved room on the packing side of things, and with a tour of Europe and ten days in America, well it was just smarter to hire out what they needed for skiing.
Aria turned her head... well, this was awkward ... she should have suspected that Draco might turn up, but all the Malfoys. Their entrance was not as confident as it once would have been - the Malfoys walked around like they owned the place - but the steps into the room Aria had been placed in, were slow - hesitant, as though they thought they'd be cursed at any second.
'Excuse me.'
Aria pressed on, giving out the next set of instructions, 'If you're an only child - make your way over.' Then she called forth those with siblings and got them to state how many they had.
'Now,' Aria commanded Celena to listen to her, 'if you think I will let you drag me here, just to let yourself be fooled into thinking that you are better than me. Then I hardly think you know me very well. I am not one to back down from a challenge and there is more than one way to see that you suffer.'
'Aria! Aria!' Draco called out her name, reaching out, the moment he touched her shoulder Potter abruptly woke up. Scrambling herself into a sitting position, she somehow had landed up sitting as though she was in his embrace. Draco spotted her glasses on the bedside table and placed them within her trembling hands.
'Hey, you.'
Lips pressed onto his own lips lightly and lingered for a few moments causing Draco to pout slightly at the chaste kiss he had received. The owner of said lips that had kissed him, giggled, her green eyes sparkling, a soft happy smile upon her face.
There were an exchange of looks, no-one really knew what to say to Aria's statement - she had never really explained what she had seen properly in Snape's memories, just the necessary facts. But Snape had a small part to play - just like she had, in Dumbledore's thought-out plan. Just another betrayal. What did that matter when the fate of lives had been at state? Nothing! The greater good ... was there such a thing?
'Wine?' his mother asked, changing the subject. Pouring some into Potter's glass before she could even answer, 'Oh you've had your nails done.'
Aria walked into the room and settled down a tray, which had several cups on it, three of which had been filled with black coffee. He sipped at the black coffee, though Aria had also provided them all with sugar and milk. The cups of tea or coffee were drunk in awkward silence, once they had Miss Dursley said.
'Oh I am,' Aria joked, 'I want to be showered with flower petals ... in front of a lot of people. Oh, a diamond ring that has encrusted emeralds and diamonds in the band ... I want snow, lots and lots of snow -'
Aria was by now, far accustomed to the whispers and chatter in corridors that followed her. Usually, she would settle for ignoring rumours and mindless chatter, but it seemed that after the war, the other students of Hogwarts no longer cared about keeping their thoughts to themselves ... well not that they usually did, it was just more on a subtle scale and she'd hear them second-hand, mostly from Ginny and Hermione.
'Aria's always had manners.' he told their auntie.
Aria turned at the sound of her cousins' voice, letting out a sigh, 'You could say that.'
'You know -' Aria said softly as they danced together, 'If you keep doing things like this ... I'm going to have no choice but to forgive you.'
'Yes, very Slytherin-like. I should have realised. Well, that makes it easier.'
Draco looked thoughtful and then he cursed. "Fucking Merlin! He's punishing me for refusing his mark on my return."
'Another letter?'
'Dragon!' Aria squealed, as Draco kissed the base of her neck.
Aria stumbled out of the fireplace, trying to gain her balance before she toppled over, but her hands were full as in one hand was a cage containing his own falcon, and the other her cat. Draco had to reach out to steady her.
'He's not bothered you, though, has he?'
'Miss Potter,' Cygnus said, 'Will you be signing up for the Duelling Tournament?'
The question should have been so easy to answer ... but she realised now, that there was more behind the comment that brought her here.
'Magic is just weird,' Dudley said, 'I still don't understand it or anything you just said.'
'You look beautiful,' Draco said his voice thick with awe, 'Well, if you are feeling better, care to join me for a dance.'
'Yeah well no one has cared enough to ...' Aria trailed off looking at him in a studious manner.
'But that is beside the point. We were talking about Malfoy, and you. What's so great about Malfoy anyway? What do you even like about him? To make you be able to stand being in his presence?'
Aria began to tremble as soon as she stepped out of the school carriages. This had been the thing she was most nervous about in returning to Hogwarts. She had no time to stop at the sight of the Great Hall doors, but hands had taken hers - hands she knew without even looking to belong to Ron and Hermione - she squeezed them to return her thanks, and together they crossed the Great Hall.
Aria watched opened mouthed as a form was flown backward across the room, slamming against the wall with a thud. The sound of the thud magnified due to the silence of the classroom. Her feet carried her across the room to the person, her heart was racing and fast-paced breathing.
"You refused!" Aria exclaimed. "Are you insane?"
Footsteps approached, Snape had turned up, looking as unimpressed as ever. Seamus was with him.
'I see the new wand you been so busy making is working?' Hermione said, indicating to the offending wand that was still pointing at them.
"What I don't understand is why Aria couldn't just tell us this to our faces!" Seamus said.
Normally Aria avoided any talk of leaving Hogwarts, for it had been her first home, but after the war, things had changed. Some things about Hogwarts had not changed at all, like the very fact Ron had peered over her shoulder to see what she was doing.
This had been a very bad idea - coming here, agreeing to this stupid ... engagement ... Aria's hands curled into fists at her sides.
It seemed Kingsley could summon up the words, and Aria was not the only person who was listening to every word being said. Aria, Ron, Hermione, along with the members of the DA, had been asked to sit in rows of seats very close to where Kingsley stood, and Aria had a feeling there was a point to this request, but Dumbledore's Army sat in the row of seats behind the last remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, and Aria was trapped between Neville and Hermione that she had no choice to follow Neville into her seat or be trampled on or cause a scene, and that was the last thing Aria had wanted to do.
'Is that why - why you didn't protest to your mother's - arrangement?' she turned her head, she looked sad, how was it possible for one person to go through so many emotions at once? Draco braced himself - if she had finally worked out the meaning behind the bracelet or was told about it, then she knew what he was, knew that the debt could not be paid this way - but the hex he braced himself for never came.
Ah, Granger had got to her point it seemed; a threat.
Draco squeezed Potter's shoulder, 'If you need anything, just knock.' He felt reluctant to leave her in such a state. 'I'll be awake, I haven't been able to get to sleep.' she looked as though she was about to protest and Draco interrupted her before she could, and said as sincerely as he could, so she would know he actually meant it; 'I mean it, Aria, if you need anything, just knock.'
'Well, I suppose being engaged to Aria Potter had to have some advantages.'
Draco Malfoy had no idea what he was getting himself into ... compatible magic they may have - that didn't mean Aria was going to let him get away with anything.
The candles had been lit, Draco glanced at the small dining table he had set up in the Manor just for himself and Aria, it was imperative that the meal went well. He was concerned as tomorrow they would be heading back to Hogwarts and with himself and Aria being in separate places of the castle, Draco thought that Aria may suffer from bonding withdrawal. The sooner they bonded, the better things would be for her. It felt so strange putting someone else's needs before his own but in a good way. Draco ran a hand through his hair, what was Aria doing to him, admittedly most of it had been his own fault, swearing an oath, promising to behave around Aria's friends. Things had gone from there.
Mrs Weasley gave her a tentative glance, her hand reached up to Aria's forehead, stopping Aria's fingers from massaging her temple, she pressed her hand against Aria's head. 'Well, you don't feel like you're burning up. Perhaps you should lay down just in case ...'
'Are we going out?' Draco asked.
"He said that you helped form a study group."
Draco pulled, Goyle into the center box, and they were joined by several others.
Yours, sincerely,
'No, no magical withdrawal, we've been spending quite a lot of time together that ... well, it's been kept at bay.' Aria said.
'Nothing like that, Draco,' Aria rolled her eyes, though he wasn't looking at her. 'I swear, just relax a little, you're too tense.'
.....
Draco eyed the small brown-haired and hazel-eyed girl. Great the news had even spread to the first-years. But he was surprised this one actually knew who he was, knew his name, he had hardly known anyone older than him, other than those who had been in Slytherin, and that was only thanks to his father's connections. But he remembered this girl, this was the same girl that had crossed the Great Hall during Aria's question about not knowing magic before Hogwarts.
Draco finished drinking and watched Potter sit next to him on the edge of the bed, sipping from his own glass.
Draco placed all three packages in the trolley.
"Running a bookshop," Draco said evenly. He sat back and crossed his arms, daring Potter to try again.
Potter glared. "That would be the least you deserve."
"But sir—"
They drew their coats tightly around themselves and headed inside. Draco flinched—he'd forgotten how beige this place was—and told Harry to order something for him.
"Pardon?"
They met in the middle, in the back. Draco fetched his wand, and Potter brought his out. "I usually just cast some charms to clean up a bit. Put all the books back, straighten the cushions, clean all the dishes and the coffee pot. That sort of thing."
"I don't think so," Draco said. "I don't want to get involved in Muggle affairs."
"Where are your pyjamas?" Potter asked.
"That sofa doesn't encourage sleep." Only two more days until Draco had the bed again.
"You should've mentioned it to me first," Draco said, though he felt silly. It wasn't as though Potter had a lot to do here. Draco just didn't want him out of sight for too long.
"How would somebody have got them? You know I'm not the attacker here. For fuck's sake, I'm protecting Potter. He deserves to know."
Draco didn't handle the heat well. Each day blended into the next, and it didn't help that every morning when he awoke, the pain in his back had spread.
"No, of course not. I want to see how you live."
He leant forwards to kiss Potter, who responded with a soft, surprised moan and pulled Draco to him.
Whitby finally turned his gaze away from the sky to look at him. "I hope you'll forgive my saying so, but for a dying man, you're really not doing much to make the most of your remaining time."
Draco looked out at the crowded pub. The sconces on the wall were fuzzy and seemed to dance. It was almost like magic. These Muggles just didn't know. They weren't half-bad, though. Not all of them. Jeremy was all right.
"You're back already," he said. Potter was standing at the front counter with a sack of takeaway containers, watching him.
"You are unbelievably selfish. You think it's easy for me here? I haven't stolen away to have secret meetings with mates. I've been bloody honest with you about everything since we got here!" Well, almost everything. He pressed his fingers to his temples. "God, my head is killing me. This is all your fault."
Before Draco could respond, Jeremy approached their table, dragging a chair and carrying an ale.
Despite his best efforts, he'd gotten to know a number of them. But this turned out to be useful when he opened a bookshop a year ago. He had a guaranteed pool of customers right from the start. Not that there were other bookshops in Cartmel.
Mornings were sweet and placid, and there was everything good about them. Nights were the exact opposite.
Hands that had touched Potter.
. God, but of course he did. "You're the only one."
A strangled cry echoed.
Nonetheless, he cast spells to smooth out the wrinkles in his clothes. Just in case.
Barclay shrugged. "I think they're interviewing people. Former Aurors, I reckon. But people don't need to come here very often, either. At least, that's what Robards told me."
The entire room was pitch black. People shouted at each other.
That they were friendly only made it even more unbearable. It felt as though there were fifty Snitches fluttering around Draco's chest. Increasingly, he didn't know how to act or what to say, and Potter responded to his clumsiness with kindness or a light barb and a smile.
"We missed you this evening," Potter whispered after switching off the lamp on the bedside table that night.
There was a debriefing session in Auror Headquarters with everyone who had responded to the break-in attempt.
"What about it?" Draco's heart pounded.
Draco remembered the day Potter started hanging back to chat very well. It was
"Am I dead yet?" he asked.
"Eating will make you more tolerable. And if Pierce knows where we are, then… I don't know. We've got to keep living our lives, though. We'll figure something out."
"You sold out all your friends. That doesn't mean you're innocent."
shop?" he hissed.
Another deep breath sent a jolt of desire straight to Harry's groin, and he pulled Draco closer, letting a hand drift down his back. He nearly gasped in surprise when he felt Draco's hands begin to trace a similar path down his own back, stopping just below the waistband of his jumper. Like he was considering.
"What?" Harry said, slightly dizzy, and he stilled himself. "What's wrong?"
Draco picked at his food, which was no longer hot. The noise level in the pub grew louder as more people filed in, and almost all the tables were full.
They looked up. Heavy grey clouds had hung in the sky all day, and they were even darker now. In the fading daylight, they looked more ominous.
Harry blushed. It really was difficult to maintain a private life in a tiny village. "We talked." He took a large bite of his toast.
A weak spear of sunlight poked through the clouds, highlighting the dormant grasses and shrubs that dotted the countryside.
"We don't have any," Draco said, and he knew immediately that it was the wrong thing to say.
"Hmm." Draco had only a vague idea what Harry was talking about, but it didn't sound pleasant. He couldn't imagine being confined to the Manor.
To Potter's face, smiling at him.
Cooking wasn't such a horrible task after all. It wasn't Draco's activity of choice, but he had to admit it was a useful skill to have, and food actually tasted better knowing he had made it.
Right. Bad move. They all took an oath of confidentiality, but undercover assignments were supposed to maintain a modicum of secrecy.
In the kitchen, he chose the largest cup he could find in the cupboard and added several heaping spoonfuls of coffee grounds. It was a lot, but this was going to be dull work.
"Now you trust me." Potter had stolen the map whilst Draco slept and hadn't given it back.
"Suddenly. Mind you, he was no spring chicken, but the man was reportedly in good health."
"Are you still angry about the crosswords?"
"Two pair. That's really good," Bill said to Potter.
"Oh, I beg to differ," Pierce said. "I need to make you suffer just as much as Lucy did before she died."
"I know," Draco said. "I will."
He opened his eyes, crusty and swollen from last night's pity party. His temple hurt where his glasses had pressed into his face as he slept. He groaned and pushed himself up. It was bloody cold. And no wonder - the fire had gone out.
It was so tempting. Draco tore his eyes away from their hands and looked into Potter's face. He looked so earnest, so full of hope and longing. He'd never looked as attractive as he did in that moment. Desperation looked good on him. Draco felt his resolve fading away. His heart pounded.
"That jumper looks nice. Red is a nice colour on you."
Harry couldn't help the smile that crept up his face. "Mrs. Wilder."
"Maybe you don't know me very well then. And what are
In the silence that followed, he wished for the earth to open up and swallow him whole. When he opened his eyes, there was no gaping chasm. Only Potter. Always Potter.
Potter.
"Found out about that, did you? Yeah, I did."
restaurants?"
Potter looked at Draco for a moment. "Get the door," he whispered.
Harry threw his arms around Draco's neck. "I know," he whispered. "I'm sorry I've made it so difficult. I'm supposed to be comforting you and -"
"I dunno."
"You could have Splinched yourself," Harry said. He sounded angry, but he knelt beside Draco and touched his aching arm tenderly. "Can you move your arm? Rotate it?"
Having someone watch elevated the experience, and Draco found it difficult to keep quiet. He bit his lip as he added two, then three fingers. And when Harry wrapped a hand around his cock, he nearly collapsed onto the bed.
Draco thought about the report Potter would eventually submit to Robards once this was all over and decided he'd better not push his luck.
"But the bakery's going to close soon!"
Then Potter finally came home, slightly inebriated and in good spirits, and it didn't take much to coax Draco from his bad mood.
"I - no, there can't." Draco grappled for words, drumming his fingers on the chair back. "But I can't stop thinking about you," he blurted. That hadn't come out the way he'd intended.
"I wouldn't be here if I were doing fine."
"I have no idea. I haven't been with anyone since before the war, actually."
"I'm fine," he mumbled.
"Perhaps you should've stayed home."
Draco tried not to let it bother him. He had gotten rather used to having something to look forward to after the ordeal of taking his potions though, and he was, if anything, a man of routine.
It was hot outside that evening, and the streets were lined with all sorts of tiny wildflowers that liked to bloom during summer and thrill tourists.
"You're welcome to leave."
Draco shifted to get a better angle and slipped his fingers into the waistband of Harry's pyjamas.
It was an especially chilly day in September when Draco left his cottage and walked past a large patch of purple asters into the wooded area behind his home. He arrived at a clearing and stopped, pulling his coat around him.
It was a perfect day to be out walking in the countryside.
"What's wrong?"
"I need your help," Barclay said in a quiet voice.
Harry nodded and returned to the puzzle.
Harry frowned. "I don't know. That seems odd. Why wouldn't he have come after me already? It's been almost two months. Hallowe'en is on Monday."
"Is it too late to change my mind?"
"Erm, I'm not sure," Potter said. "How are you feeling?"
Draco groaned, then finally rolled onto his back and yawned.
"Well, that's no proper way to start a marriage. You need photos, and friends, and a grand party. Tell me you had a party."
They broke apart, and everyone linked hands with people on either side and began dancing in a left-moving circle. They danced right when the caller shouted at them to move right.
"I told you," Draco tried again, "my back—"
Well, if Potter insisted.
He waited for a long time.
"All right," Jeremy said. "I'll make it simple this time. And I won't even touch my cards, so you can't accuse me of cheating."
In the evening, as all the regulars bade farewell, Potter loomed behind, as usual. He leaned on the counter. "So, what do you feel like having?"
Draco's breathing had just returned to normal when the door opened again, and in sauntered Harry Potter.
He opened the window, and they glided in one after the other. All eight of them. Harry snatched the letters away and yelled, warning them never to come back. Tears streaked his face by the time they had all finally gone. If there was one thing about Draco that had always irritated Harry, it was this. He had always thought it was profoundly unfair that Draco's friends and family should never know what had happened to him. Harry had scowled as he watched Draco cast
The Muggle leading them, a fit bloke named Mark, chose a particularly breathtaking path, treating them all to a picturesque display of fiery brilliance at almost every turn through the forest.
Draco tripped over a root. He reached for Potter's arm and missed, crashing to his knees instead.
"Stay on the sofa then."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You haven't been out of the wizarding world that long. You said to bring you something nice. Here it is."
Rosemary. And you can help. It'll be fun."
"Goodnight, Potter," Robards said, and he waved as Harry left, quietly shutting the door behind him.
But the cases he and Barclay handled were never risky enough to mandate security measures, so they never bothered.
They continued to watch each other. This was mad. How could Potter still make him feel so...
"You're shaking," Harry said. He rubbed Draco's back in light circles. "Are you all right?"
Not when he kissed Draco.
Realisation struck at last. "It's an inside job. It's someone at the Ministry?"
Naomi was the wife of the pub owner. Draco waved to her. She grinned and said something to Potter.
It didn't really matter.
The door swung open.
"I suppose you want to know what I'll be doing there."
He was in no rush to go home yet, so he grabbed a stack of budget reports from Barclay's desk.
"You're dying," whispered Potter.
"I'll get breakfast," Harry said, ruffling Draco's hair. He got out of bed, put on last night's clothes, and made his way to the kitchen.
He sighed. Perhaps he could take Potter up on his offer, just this once. Just to wipe that look off his face. What could it hurt?
"Oof! Watch it!" Draco lost his balance, or perhaps he tripped on something. Either way, he crashed into Potter, who steadied him. There were worse fates.
"Have you thought about it?"
At meal times, Potter was prone to rambling about work, or his boring friends and the tasteless activities they found entertaining. It was easy for Draco to tune him out. A nod here and there was often good enough to convince Potter he was listening.
He looked over his shoulder and saw Potter had caught up with him.
Harry swallowed the lump in his throat and said, "Let's put this together sometime, yeah?"
"Your tea is cold," Potter said.
Except for the day when, without thinking, he began asking questions in return.
Draco wondered if this was it. If this was the end of the routine he and Potter had established. That he'd come to look forward to - and apparently Potter had, as well. There was no other bookshop for Potter to haunt though, so where could he be?
Draco reached to cradle Harry's head with a hand. "Listen to me," he said softly. "I'll understand if you want to stop this - stop seeing me. If you want to spare yourself from having to be with me when it happens. I could never hold it against you."
Whitby looked apologetic. "Yes. It seems even the potions you've been taking these last few months are no longer sufficient."
Draco narrowed his eyes. "I thought this was just a spot of fun for you."
The silence stretched out for a long time. Finally, Potter said, "There was a time when you'd laugh at me if I struggled with something."
"True," Potter said.
"That's why you need to listen to me!" And Draco set the access book on the desk, flipping to the pages where Pierce's entries were logged.
Harry watched Draco pull out his keys to lock the bookshop. The air was lush with the smell of sunshine and greenery. It was an especially nice evening, but he was looking rather worn out lately. His Healer had made some adjustments to his potions, and they weren't sitting terribly well with him. Draco had assured Harry there was always an adjustment period and not to worry.
Harry smiled. "My grandparents owned Hillside Cottage, a long time ago."
"Oh. Is everything all right?"
Draco pushed his trousers and pants off and neatly placed his shirt at the end of the bed. Harry threw his clothes onto the floor with everything else.
"Yeah," Harry said. He reached under the covers for Draco's hand and placed it on his erection. "I'm feeling much better today."
"No spells! Is that clear?" Perry's voice shouted.
"Because it's here," Draco murmured.
Draco waved a hand. "Aurors have secured it by now."
The muffled noises were no longer muffled, and he heard Harry cry out in what was unmistakably pain.
"See you tomorrow." It wasn't even a question.
Harry paced the short length of the cubicle whilst Draco sat and watched.
It was difficult now to believe that had once been a reality.
The rain continued for the next three days, but it suited Draco's mood. The turmoil outside mirrored how he felt inside. His mind was in shambles. Everything in his life revolved around Potter, and all of it was a disaster.
Draco froze. He'd almost forgotten about that.
He was a regular.
There was blissful silence for much of the morning. Draco sat behind the counter and read, occasionally nodding or waving at the handful of customers that came in and out. It was a pleasant, normal day, and when Potter walked in mid-afternoon, it was still a pleasant, normal day, because he was no longer a poisonous intrusion in Draco's life.
Draco's home was barren. It was completely devoid of any sort of personal touches. There were no photos, trinkets, or keepsakes of any sort. There was no artwork on the plain-coloured walls. A single blue rug lay in the middle of the living room. All the furniture was black.
"Here. Turn. Now!"
"Nobody's responsible!" Potter yelled, throwing his hands up in the air. "It was an accident!"
Draco smirked—he was going to enjoy witnessing Potter's pleasure. He got to his knees and positioned himself over Potter's cock, then slowly lowered himself, never daring to break eye contact.
Draco watched them disappear, then remembered himself and took out Potter's case file, setting it on the floor. With a wave of his wand, he cast, "
"Bring me some!" Barclay called after him.
Mrs. Wilder had invited him to her house for Christmas, as she had done the last three years. She promised a celebration that would knock his socks off. Draco thanked her and said he had plans. He wondered if she had invited Potter as well. Then he wondered what Potter was up to for the holidays. Perhaps he was stuck in a tiny cottage on the opposite end of the village, wishing everybody could just leave him alone so he could die in peace, without burdening anybody.
When he wasn't with Draco, pretending time didn't exist, he worked on his book, or wrote in his journal. And now that it was warm again, he began spending more time in his garden. He'd forgotten nearly everything from Herbology, and his knowledge concerning non-magical plants didn't amount to much either. Still, gardening seemed to be an integral part of owning a cottage, and Mrs. Wilder had encouraged him to give it a go when he'd first moved in.
Harry tried reassuring him by squeezing his hand every so often, but it became less effective as they approached the cottage.
"Wait, why are we still dancing?"
Draco took a moment to stand in the centre of the Atrium, relishing the fact that nobody could see him.
"Mine's 'Henry Singer'."
"That would be nice."
"Yes, today," Potter said. "I'm tired of doing all the work around here."
"I wonder what's happening at the bookshop," Harry said.
"Husband," Draco spat. "And yes. What do you need?" His mind raced. What the hell had Potter done?
Auditing secure files was slightly more involved than auditing departmental budget records. And apparently, it couldn't be left to anyone other than an Auror, due to the contents of the records.
"You have no idea," Draco said.
"Are we finished here?" he asked.
Draco wrinkled his nose at the worn-looking grey shirt and black shorts he wore. He waited until Potter shut the door and got out of bed to put clothes on.
Robards' frown deepened. "You must also show that you're capable of conducting yourself professionally with your peers and superiors."
Harry flashed him a wide smile. "It's a camera. I thought we could take some photos together."
Harry's eyes were wide and reflected the moonlight as he stared at Draco.
Draco shrugged. "I don't know. Fifteen minutes."
It was agony.
"Oh, sure." He sat up and scooted out of the way.
"I hope you like burgers," Potter said.
Rutherford stared at him with disdain for a long moment before pulling out his wand and Summoning a box from one shelf. It landed neatly on his desk, and he lifted a stack of parchment from it.
"There's this place up in the Lake District that, erm—well, Lawrence and I used it as our meeting point." Potter paused and frowned at his plate before continuing. "I'll write down the coordinates for you. But there's an abandoned shack about fifty paces west of a fallen tree. We can meet there, if there's an emergency."
There was just one thing left to do.
"It's fine."
Without thinking, he stood and shuffled to the counter, then flipped the book open to his bookmark.
Draco jerked his head. "Let's just go sit."
"I'm protecting you." Draco coughed as he scrambled to his feet, clutching his stomach.
"Yeah, but we're almost finished," said Harry, waving a piece at him like a carrot.
"He's not so bad once you get to know him."
Draco frowned.
"Sounds good."
Still, as spring neared its end, Harry's joy and satisfaction became overshadowed with a swell of unease each time he stood up and brushed the sweat from his brow. He faced the sun one warm June afternoon, shielding his eyes as he surveyed the primrose cuttings he had just planted. Draco liked to complain about how poorly named his cottage was, since there was no primrose to be found anywhere near it. Harry always rolled his eyes and smiled, but he'd decided to try propagating some from the small patch that lived in a shady corner of his own garden. With any luck, he'd be able to re-plant the grown cuttings around Draco's cottage next year.
Harry ran a hand through his hair. "How? Do you have any idea who?"
"Yeah. Well, they never sold it. The deed was in my vault at Gringotts. I'd been asking Hermione to visit mine every now and then, whenever I needed money. One day, she found the deed under a pile of galleons."
"If you ask me, you could use a spot of fun," Potter continued.
"This one doesn't taste bad. It's just like drinking water, I promise. Let me go and get you some for the next month."
"That's right."
"No, you don't."
Like Potter.
"I'd better go," said Draco. He wound his scarf around his neck and grabbed his coat.
"No."
"Let me kill Potter," Pierce said, "and I'll make sure you get promotions and recognition."
"Hmm? Oh, I dunno," Potter said. "Humour me. I'm having fun."
"I like to stay on top of things," Draco said dismissively. "What's with the interrogation?"
, his brain teased.
"When you go out, where do you go?" It was Thursday, and a steady rain fell outside.
"God, she was serious?"
"I'd like to watch, if you don't mind."
"Thank you, then," he said.
Perhaps Draco had been looking at this all wrong. He could help himself and save Robards a lot of trouble.
Draco couldn't help noticing how Potter did indeed seem to take his time to enjoy his ice cream, and he wondered whether he realised what he was doing to Draco. It was just one more thing to add to his list of grievances against Muggle clothes—they didn't conceal erections well.
Draco frowned. "Did you just want to continue our one-to-ones so that you could ridicule me?"
"I know plenty of things," Draco said.
The cold hardly seemed to matter with how tightly they clung to each other. Harry's tongue found its way into Draco's mouth, and a small moan escaped Draco. He wished they were home so he could take Harry to bed.
"Very astute, Potter." Draco rolled his eyes. He softened his voice and added, "Can I come inside?"
"Don't you think it might help business if you made them more available to your customers?"
"Except I value my privacy." Draco yanked his jumper over his head and began putting his socks and shoes on.
Perhaps not.
He realised that if he accompanied Harry with these Muggles on their walk, Draco could better protect him if something happened.
"Sorry, what?"
Pansy chose to stand in solidarity with all their friends, which meant ostracising Draco from her life. One moment, they were exchanging letters and meeting for coffee or dessert somewhere. The next, his letters went unanswered, and she stopped showing up at their meeting spots. Almost all the Malfoys' friends had cut them off over the years.
Harry opened his eyes. His mind went back to the bookshop, when he'd pinned Draco against the shelves, wishing he could see Draco come undone. Well, Harry certainly was now. He didn't think he'd ever seen a more beautiful image than the one before him. Draco's face was a mixture of concentration and lust. Fine blond hair stood out in various directions, illuminated by the fire light.
"All right, everyone. Let's get started!" the quizmaster announced.
"And that's what you do? You walk with these—these people?"
Yes. He decided they had. He'd just take his journal and head over and hurry into the little nook in the back where he always sat.
"Orion."
"I mean it's not here. What else can that mean? Just give me a half-hour, I left it in the bookshop."
"We didn't help organise it. We just attended it."
They ate in silence. Draco tried to eat as quickly as possible so he could retreat to the bedroom, but several questions flitted through his mind, and his curiosity got the better of him.
Jennings waved him away. "Well, go on, off you fuck."
He ran all the way back to the shop. Whitby would have killed him.
The degree to which it irritated him was, in fact, quite alarming. He sat at the counter and stewed all day. And when Potter strode in mid-afternoon that Friday, Draco called him over with a sharp, "Potter."
"I know it's nice." Draco drummed his fingertips on the counter.
Again.
Draco felt his mouth clench. He took several deep breaths, but they did nothing to calm him. He thought about his poisoned blood pumping through every part of his body. "How long do I have," he said flatly.
Potter loosened his grip on Draco's hand and began rubbing in the dips between his knuckles. "In a way, I guess, yeah. And I still think we should make the most of the time you have left."
"Are you sure it's Pierce?"
Potter fell asleep quickly, but Draco lay awake late into the night. His mind was preoccupied with thoughts of work, and Potter's case, and what would happen once Potter's case was closed. He and Potter never broached the topic, but Draco knew they would have to soon. He cared too much.
"And they haven't found someone to replace him yet?"
"Sir—"
Draco glanced at himself in the window again. He looked understated and elegant, exactly as one should on a first date.
Draco was helping a customer at the counter.
"Of course, yeah." Potter shifted his bag higher up his shoulder. "Well, let's head out together at least then?"
He tossed his quill down and followed Barclay towards the lifts.
"But I've only worked on one high-profile case, and—"
"B-But that was an accident!" Harry said. "You can't blame me for that. You can't blame anyone!"
That sounded bad. "I'm going to need more information than that."
"I've just got word that there's been another death involving the Brixham case. Jennings, MacDonald, you were both involved originally." He beckoned them with his hand. "My office."
He didn't think it would escalate beyond a few words. And he certainly didn't think anyone so old and frail-looking could be so strong.
"I won't," Potter said. "Come on, let's have dinner."
"Of course you do," Potter muttered.
Draco was too weak-willed and too far gone to push him away any longer. He threw his arms around Potter and pulled him close, crushing their mouths together.
"Really."
He grabbed Draco's arm and pulled him back into the lift, and the grilles closed.
"It wasn't quite like that," Draco muttered. He spilled a small amount of milk into his tea and stirred.
"Who cares?"
"Every day until I die."
"We can't do magic outside the home, remember?"
But then he remembered.
"Good night," Potter said.
The bonfire raged in front of them, flames stretching to the sky. It was a clear night, and stars winked at them from overhead.
In the centre of the room stood three tall, burly wizards. Draco's heart froze when he realised they were dressed as Death Eaters.
"You expect me to trust your gut feeling?"
"My life's been turned upside down as well."
"Or what?" Rutherford demanded.
Whitby laughed and launched into the usual battery of questions to assess Draco's health. He cast spells to take Draco's weight, temperature, and assess various levels of who knew what. Draco didn't really care; he just shut his eyes and let the man work.
As though Harry wasn't going to come right back with takeaway.
"How about another time? I'm just - you're right, I'm not feeling well. I just want to lie down right now."
"Yes, it's terrible. I've really got to be off now."
Draco grabbed a handful of custard creams and a glass of lemonade, then made a beeline for the nearest empty table.
"Fuck off. I have nothing to prove to someone like you."
Hard to say.
Draco gripped the rounded edges of his chair and clenched his jaw. He would have felt more comfortable if Robards had yelled at him to get out of his office. He stared at the maroon carpet. It was tragic how badly it clashed against the scarlet robes Aurors were required to wear.
Draco blinked a few times. Crossed his arms. Pursed his mouth. "All right. Yeah."
She grunted in acknowledgement. "You'll know soon enough, at least." Harry watched her pick up another piece of toast. "What have you got planned for today then?"
"We're not going to get caught unless you tell someone." Draco shoved his wand back into the glove box and jammed his seatbelt into the buckle.
Maybe it was something about the light, or the fact that he'd worn Harry's favourite midnight blue jumper, but Draco looked positively radiant. Better than he had in weeks, if Harry thought about it. It was difficult to tear his focus away, and at the end of the meal, he couldn't even remember what either of them had eaten.
yesterday. My partner
But he knew he couldn't stay here. He couldn't even go into the fucking kitchen.
The damn jigsaw puzzle greeted him first. He couldn't believe how close they had been to finishing. His heart hurt to look at it, and so he averted his eyes.
"No. Fuck you. I'd sooner stop taking all these potions and just die already. I'm not moving here."
He relayed all the information he had to Potter and mentioned Pierce and Morrell were investigating the case.
"Friendly place," said Potter, who looked like he was struggling not to laugh. Draco hated him for looking so relaxed. So healthy. Like he'd really taken care of himself over the last three years.
"Who cares? It's not as though we've got to go anywhere tomorrow."
"No."
The kettle was ready. Draco added several spoonfuls of coffee to the mug, filled it to the brim with hot water, and stirred in an obscene amount of sugar. He walked carefully back to Robards' office, trying not to spill a drop. His mind changed with every step he took.
He sulked behind Potter as they made their way up and down all the aisles.
A murmur of agreement rose from the group. Draco scowled at them all and sat back down.
For the moment, all the tension from the last two days had vanished, and Draco thought he would sleep well that night.
Barclay shrugged. "That's being investigated. In the meantime, Robards wants all the files marked 'Confidential' and 'Highly Confidential' audited as a precaution. You know, to make sure nobody's tampered with them, in case the Records Keeper was murdered."
Thankfully, Robards appeared at his cubicle.
It didn't completely block the curse, but Harry suffered considerably less. Draco watched in horror as he writhed on the sofa, gritting his teeth from the pain. Too late, he realised his mistake.
That shouldn't have hurt as much as it did.
told me!"
A voice jarred him from his thoughts. "Mr. Malfoy." A different voice. A different Healer. He sat up and saw a short, stocky man standing beside him. Was this good or bad?
He launched himself out of bed and flung the window open to take several chest-clearing breaths of cold air.
A wiry man with dark hair and leathery skin gaped at him, and Draco remembered he only had a towel wrapped around his waist.
Even whilst at work, he had a hard time focussing on anything.
That evening, bags shrunken and stuffed into their pockets, Draco and Harry joined the rest of the residents for the Bonfire Night celebration in front of the village hall. It was cold, and everyone was bundled up in jackets, caps, and scarves.
"I love when people make my job easy. Follow me."
Best to keep things simple and civil. Professional. Nobody could accuse him of anything. And if Robards asked his reason for leaving, Draco would just say 'personal reasons'. Robards couldn't really probe further.
Draco blinked and yawned. It was nearly dark. They'd been here for an entire day, and they hadn't killed each other.
"The log entry for the tip Lawrence got—there was nothing. No information that could be used to trace it."
Potter had his legs crossed, and something was propped on his knee.
Potter shrugged. "They could've died."
with me."
Everything was just as it had been. Of course. It was just that they had settled into doing so many things without even thinking about them. And now it all stood out to him. How comfortably they had lived together.
"You're sexy when you're reading."
"Well, somebody did."
Draco said nothing, and Harry continued.
It was agony wondering if each time was the last. It hurt to watch. But Harry was always glad to be there for him. It was the least he could do.
"What now?" Jennings said.
With a last look over his shoulder, he vanished with a pop.
And there it was, at the far end of Level Six and down a winding corridor—Rutherford's office.
Draco had considered trying to find and spy on him. Kick him out, perhaps. This was
"You were right, it's not got anything to do with the case you and Lawrence were working on."
"Sorry." Draco cocked his head, as though he were thinking. "Erm - fine then. I guess, let's go."
He always had his curtains drawn closed in London, but here, like at the Manor, he kept them drawn aside to let starlight flood the room. He held his hands up and stared at them.
"Don't look at me like that. I have hands, you know. They've served me perfectly well."
"I'll kill myself sleeping on that thing." Draco lifted his own bag onto the bed and turned it over. Clothes and books spilled out and mixed with Potter's.
"Well?" Potter watched Draco as though he were a bug in a box. "What are you doing here?" His gaze was stony.
"He said he's not making any assumptions," Barclay said. "That's why it's being investigated."
"I don't care about your personal life," Robards said. "Get in my office. I have an assignment for you."
"It's just a feeling."
He'd walked right into that one, hadn't he? He ran a hand through his hair. "I don't - I don't know."
He chanced a glance at Potter, who looked at him with as much dread as Draco felt.
After finishing dinner, Draco didn't feel like going home yet, so he wandered through the streets. It was a warm August evening, and he couldn't wait for summer to end.
There was a long moment of silence.
"No," Harry said. "Not like that."
"How charming." Draco set the kettle down and tried to imagine life if he hadn't agreed to this assignment.
Potter gave a sad smile. "We used to be partners, you know."
This was going to take a while.
"What? No, Potter -" Draco tried to pull his hand away.
He had his book open, but his eyes kept shifting over the top to steal glances at Potter, who was idly rubbing Draco's ankles and watching Midsomer Murders.
"I want to die."
Draco held his breath whilst waiting for Robards to think.
Harry barely waited for Draco to unfold his arms before taking one long stride over to envelop him. He turned his face into Draco's hair and inhaled, and a faint scent of peaches flooded his senses. It was so subtle, and Harry felt inordinately delighted that nobody else would know what sort of shampoo Draco used unless they were
"I didn't do anything. It's all your fault."
"I haven't said anything to anyone. I value my privacy too, you know."
The subject of where, when, and how often Potter wanked weighed heavily on Draco's mind over the next two weeks.
Whitby sighed. "Probably no more than five years. But once you start taking potions to manage the infection, we'll have a much better idea. It could be longer."
Potter scowled at him. "You know, most Muggles are all right. They're not much different from you and me."
Robards hated when people left his door open.
"I'm Healer Whitby," he said, extending a hand.
"There you are." His partner, Barclay, sat down in the cubicle next to Draco. "I was looking for you."
"I thought so as well."
Draco dipped a chip in curry sauce and bit into it. "It's over, actually. Forgot to tell you."
"I'll never understand why you don't just make your own coffee," he said, buttering a slice of toast.
"Sure," he croaked.
Harry lay on his side, wide awake and watching him.
Potter per se, but he certainly no longer loathed him. It was fair to say that he enjoyed their chats at the end of the day. Potter was easy to talk to, and it was a nice break in the monotony.
But instinctively, he knew. He knew when Draco would come around, tap him on the shoulder, and Harry would turn around to watch him say, "I'm closing the shop. It's time to leave."
doing out here anyway?"
He found Potter sat at the table in the kitchen, writing something.
"Hey, Malfoy, we need more pastries," a voice interrupted. A small mercy.
"Let me guess," Draco said, "I'm dying."
"Should be in Lawrence's desk. You going to break into his, too?"
Draco bristled. "Since I
"David!"
." He was getting a little irritated at having to constantly remind Draco to use his given name.
Mercifully, Potter responded by pressing two fingers deep inside him. Draco moaned and began rocking back and forth against them, which had the added benefits of rubbing their cocks together and making Potter squirm. Draco could get used to seeing him like this.
Draco was restless in the empty cottage, though. He had learnt how to manipulate the telly now, so he spent the afternoon clicking through all the channels. Despite the variety in programming, nothing held his interest.
"All the more reason to ask me."
Well, except it seemed to matter now, at least. Wouldn't it be something if he just fell over dead in this tiny room? While he tried not to yell out from the pain, Draco tried to distract himself by imagining who might find his body. But the pain vanished before he could decide who the lucky person might be. The tightness in his chest, which had been a new and persistent presence recently, lessened, and he could breathe a little easier.
Potter crossed his arms. "I thought there was and could never be any 'us'."
"I don't want one. I was only curious. That's the point of a hypothetical question." Perhaps Barclay was friendly with an Unspeakable. Now and then, he surprised Draco.
"Draco." As he leaned his arms on the counter, he realised he had nothing to say. Not that it mattered. His mouth had gone completely dry. Up close, the delicate cable knit of Draco's jumper caught his eye.
"Sure," Harry said, grinning widely.
Potter curled up to him and wedged a leg between his. "Well, I did."
"Just give me the fucking file," Draco said through gritted teeth.
"How did you manage to avoid overnight look-outs?" Potter asked when he sat down with two steaming mugs of tea. He pushed one across the table.
"Hardly. You were here yesterday."
"I'm sorry," Draco whispered, but it was too late. Potter was gone.
Draco stepped lightly alongside Harry through the forest and took in their surroundings as if seeing them for the first time. Colours seemed brighter, and the air seemed fresher. Even the cold grey sky had a sombre beauty about it that was easy to appreciate in the absence of constant threat.
Draco focussed on cutting his asparagus into even pieces whilst he thought. Despite what Potter's gut said, the would-be killer probably was related to their case. The simplest explanations were often the best.
"I'm sure the Muggles won't think twice about me paying with this."
Potter glowered at him from across the room. His short hair looked a mess, as always, and the wrinkled, scarlet robes did him no favours. At least he looked just as displeased to be here as Draco did. It was a minor comfort. He wondered if they were doomed to stay here in this tiny room.
"I'm not sure."
Everything about Kilmington was different now.
Draco silently wished that nothing disastrous would happen, then sighed and got in the car. Potter took his place in the driver's seat. As they drove away, Draco watched the shabby little house disappear in the wing mirror.
"Go. Find a vial and meet us in the interview room," Robards said to Jennings, and he dashed away.
"Well, I reckon it's good for once that you don't get on with anyone."
Draco moaned and tried to draw his legs up. Harry firmly pressed them back down on the bed and took the length of his cock into his mouth, running his tongue in lazy circles around the head, the sounds from Draco making his head spin.
"You seem remarkably calm for having just learnt a colleague wants to murder you," Draco said.
They linked arms and knelt to grab Pierce's arms. With a last shared look, they Apparated.
"Here! Come on!"
"Every single time?"
Draco pushed back onto Harry's cock, moaning at the exquisite sensation of being filled so completely.
Rain continued to pour outside, but the cottage was cosy and warm, and the air was heavy with the heady smell of sex. Draco felt drunk from the intimacy, which reminded him that this was probably a bad idea.
"How should I know?" He scanned the menu items and frowned at the Muggles staring at them from behind the counter. "I'm going to sit down. Just pick something for me."
"I'm with a -" he sneered at Potter, "- customer, Carter. Give me a minute."
Potter ran a hand through his short, messy hair. He let out an exasperated sigh. "Fine. Let's swap every week between the sofa and the bed."
"What?" Draco jogged to catch up to him.
He spent the evening glaring at the crossword and drinking tea.
A single, resounding crack quietened the room. Draco snapped back to attention and saw that the wizards dressed as Death Eaters had Apparated. All the Aurors and Unspeakables stood still, staring at where they'd once been.
"Heavens!" She threw her arms up. "We've got to do something. Every wedding deserves a celebration."
"I know." Harry reached out to cup his cheek.
"Excuse you, but you're not the only person involved here." Potter had some nerve. Yet part of Draco had been hoping for this. A terrible, selfish part of him.
Draco flashed him a mischievous grin. He rolled onto his stomach and got to his hands and knees, then squeezed a good amount of lube onto his fingers. He glanced over his shoulder, smirking at how raptly Harry stared at him, then reached behind to touch himself. It was awkward at first, but Harry began rubbing his legs, and it was easy to let go after that.
They made their way to the front. Draco took his time fiddling with the till one last time, hoping Potter would leave. Except he just stood there, watching Draco with a stupid grin on his face. Merlin, what was wrong with him?
"I think you need concrete evidence," Harry said.
"Yeah, all right. Let me go to the loo first." And Potter finally let go.
"I've got an anonymous tip I need to look into."
Potter shrugged. "Can't explain it."
"Let me rephrase: what more do you
"Where?"
"Diagon Alley?"
Draco had Apparated directly from the cottage to the Ministry and so hadn't dressed properly for the late October weather. He certainly hadn't expected he'd be Apparating to their secret location up in the fells of the Lake District. It was much different from the last time he'd come here, and he scrambled to find the tiny shack as wind whipped around him.
"God."
"What are the odds Robards would let us move here permanently?" Harry asked.
"Lucy?" Draco asked.
No, sod it.
They had a job to do, a role to fulfil. Kissing, whilst not explicitly noted as a requirement of the assignment, was easy to imagine as being necessary. There was no reason to dwell on it or make wild assumptions about its meaning. It was simply work.
"I'll do that next time," Potter said.
Best to just get it over with now.
Unless someone had taken him.
Harry wasn't so sure about that. Unless he explicitly asked, Draco didn't exactly volunteer information about how he was feeling. So Harry had taken to asking him, much more often now, how he felt each day. And while Draco frowned or rolled his eyes, he always answered.
"You must also successfully lead three high-profile cases to completion—"
"I don't have a clue what you're talking about." And Draco didn't. Everyone loved Harry.
He couldn't take it any more.
"How about you just trust that I'm doing what I need to?"
And they stayed.
"I believe you both could use some time to recuperate."
? What would his parents say? He glanced at Potter, who looked confused. But didn't he always?
Draco wanted nothing more than to take Potter in his arms. It was strange, how overwhelming the feeling was. He gripped his hands tightly. "I'm not doing great. But things haven't gotten any worse for months." Draco looked down at Potter, who looked to be in agony. "I don't know when anything will happen. Or even what, specifically. It's unpredictable. And I couldn’t bear the thought of putting anybody I cared about through that kind of pain."
Draco strode to him and snatched his hand and Side-Along Apparated them both home.
Draco crossed his arms. Every week, their conversations went in circles and ended up nowhere. Meanwhile, he'd been passed over for nearly every prestigious assignment that came through, and after six years, he still hadn't been promoted beyond the most junior rank of Auror.
"I believe a promotion is in order, in fact."
"Are you sure?"
"Sorry," he said when he stepped out. Potter was lying on the bed already, and he was scribbling in Draco's book of crosswords.
Draco ignored him and went into the bathroom, slamming the door shut. He took his time and, when he finally came out, let out a sigh of relief to see that Potter had gone.
"A biography of my grandparents," he said.
If Potter remembered anything about the night they'd shared the bed, he didn't bring it up. Neither did Draco. He didn't even thank Potter for letting him sleep there. Best to just avoid the subject entirely.
It was going to take them forever, and Draco was not sorry when he checked his watch and saw that it was nearly five o'clock. He yawned and bid Barclay a sleepy farewell.
He made a cup of tea and took it and the case file to bed. But Potter was right—nothing about it seemed suspicious.
The fiddler and the accordion player picked up their instruments. "Hope you can waltz, boys!" one of them called, and they began playing.
They weren't even going to be in London?
Harry shut his mouth. "Mmhmm."
Draco ignored him and tried several spells to unlock the door. They didn't work either. He shoved his wand in his pocket and leant back against the wall, crossing his arms.
"I'm worried," he said.
"I'll stay for now, thanks."
"I'll see you next weekend," he said, and Apparated back to his flat. He immediately went into the kitchen and piled Ginger Newts onto a plate.
Draco's stomach churned—he loathed travelling by Portkey—but he forced his eyes open and looked up to see Potter scowling at him.
to me?"
"Yeah, well, it makes him look charitable. It only makes you look even more pitiful."
"Intense," Harry finished. There was a lot of come on his stomach and chest, and he couldn't help smiling. He liked it. "Come here," he said, pulling Draco to him.
“Then why don’t you just let it
Luna explains. “I found it at the bottom of a lake during a hiking trip. Touch it.”
His blond eyebrows jump up and he chuckles. "A classic reaction. I think celebration in my family has always been more formal and subdued.” He thinks for a moment before adding, “Actually, if my father were still with us, I think he would also faint at this point.”
“You’re a good guy. I never once stopped believing that. And, the truth is, I’ve been asking after you from time to time. Hermione’s been keeping me in the loop. It sounds like you’ve been having a tough time.”
After swallowing her water, she continues, "What I suggest is a combination of both Wizarding and Muggle outreach. Of course, Muggles can't yet protect themselves from magical forces, but Wizards can. What's stopping a collaboration between the two communities? Our histories are marked with so much strife already - I think more teamwork and mutual understanding, especially from the Wizarding side, is long overdue."
“What is that?” Harry asks.
Harry knocks on the door. From beyond, he hears the pattering of feet.
When he wakes, the world is still steeped in darkness. It isn’t a nightmare that has woken him, but something else, for once. Voices, outside, toward the back of the cottage. Draco turns his back to the sound, trying to chase his lost fatigue, but the conversation comes through, clear as the night sky.
Only stumbling a little bit on the way there, Harry somehow makes it out the bathroom, through the labyrinth of his bedroom, and onto his bed without bumping into and breaking anything. In fact, the main reason that his bedroom is comprised of only his bed and a set of drawers now when it used to contain several bookshelves, a couch, and a glass coffee table is because he once fell into and shattered the coffee table while drunk. Harry had never seen Kreacher so disappointed in his master. In fact, he didn’t even know that house elves could
Ash's eyes are glittering when ze speaks, bowing zir head slightly. "Of course. We would be glad to help."
A long sip later, he finally responds, "Hm?"
Draco turns back around to face the cake. The candles burn bright, their flames, a rainbow of different colors. Now blue, now green, now red. Slowly, the wax beads, and snakes down, threatening to fall into the icing.
Lucas’ eyebrows are still furrowed, but he doesn’t argue anymore.
He snaps the notebook shut and slides it back into his bag. "Thank you so much. You have no idea how much that will help me."
“Holy shit.”
"Obviously," Ron answers for his daughter after scoffing, "they'll have to prove their skill, right?"
Harry realizes,
“Then I’ll whip up a pie.”
Hermione and Ron collectively let out a breath of relief. “We just found out this week,” Ron explains. “You’re the first person we’ve told.”
"Are you still planning on coming?"
“I guess I am.”
An instant blush - however that's possible, Harry doesn't know - fills his cheeks with warmth. "Well." What should he even say? Will whatever he says next get to Draco somehow? Does Draco want them to be friends? Something more?
“Why not?”
, Harry thinks to himself as he sips his wine, watching the whole exchange.
They move the party into the sitting room and onto their objectively hideous floral print couch that Harry snagged from a Muggle yard sale half as a joke, and which Draco keeps around out of spite. And because it’s surprisingly comfortable.
If she's surprised, she doesn't show it. All she does is lean forward a little bit more from her position behind Luna's empty chair, which is directly opposite of Harry's and Hermione's. "Oh? Do you know Draco personally, then?"
Before the questions come, Harry steps in for the first time since dinner began to explain. "He was teaching at Hogwarts. I saw him while I was there." Draco looks at him from the corner of his eye, but he neither looks particularly pleased or displeased at him.
As Harry nears his office, he notices the door is ajar. Strange, he thinks to himself. Although he didn't care much in the past, lately he's been trying to at least shut the door when he leaves, just so no one can see inside at how messy his desk is.
Harry almost snorts, but opts to give a shaky nod, grab the files, and duck out of the room instead. 'Good work.' He could laugh if it weren't so depressing. Harry hasn't done anything useful in this department in years - practically since he first joined. Maybe the most he's ever contributed to the force was the one time someone brought in a broken Muggle coffee machine and he fixed it for them.
“You’re awake anyways.”
Muggle London is busier than Harry remembers it. There are more tourists now, and they all move in huge crowds - clustering in front of hotels and restaurants with furry winter coats and cameras in hand. Malfoy leads Harry around them, down streets, and across intersections.
He is not crying now, and neither is his mother. When they speak to each other, their words are slow and careful, but clear and unwavering.
But then he realizes that he actually has to walk outside if he gets one and promptly drops the idea.
“The Death Eaters. They c-contacted me. Offered a p-position.”
“Listen, Draco.”
“To your marital bliss!” Weasley had toasted, sloshing his drink. The other men raised their glasses, and Harry did, too, his face pale in the firelight.
What seems to be those three people - a woman with her black hair in a short, sleek bob, a bearded man who Harry notices only ever dresses in Muggle formal attire, and another man with long blonde hair tied in a low ponytail and a pair of square glasses sitting low on his face - sit up straight and nod. If Harry recalls correctly, they're the most newbie team in the department. In fact, he's pretty sure he's seen at least one or two of their faces at the Ministry-wide trainee graduation ceremony last Spring.
Lucius Malfoy is still alive. It’s a little known fact because the media has lost interest in him, and they’ve lost interest in him because he’s been Kissed. Harry feels uneasy and unsure of what is safe to say about him - everything seems like a landmine.
Kreacher has dinner waiting for him when he gets back, but even though the aroma of chicken curry, his favorite food, would usually get him salivating before even reaching the kitchen, Harry feels nothing. He bites into his food and tastes nothing. He vaguely registers Kreacher off the side, eyeing him with concern and asking him questions - is it not to Master's liking? Would Master like a glass of water? Milk? Juice? - but he doesn't care enough to respond with more than grunts. After dinner, as he sinks into the squished couch he bought at a Muggle yard sale a few years ago and fires up the television, he feels nothing.
This one's a bit short, and I apologize about that. The next one is gonna have a little surprise though, so stay tuned  :)
There's another round of greetings, and Harry's head aches and throbs.
“Sorry, I remembered I had left some readings in there.” Suddenly, Malfoy’s standing in the doorway of his bedroom, a pyramid of scrolls stacked in his arms. “I have to have all of these prepared by tomorrow.”
There is much to be done, tomorrow. And the day after, and the day after that. But one of the hardest parts of the process is already over with, and Harry knows that Draco, as he does in the face of all challenges - cooking, Dragon Handling, loving Harry - will learn quickly, excel, and still manage to teach Harry a thing or two.
Harry takes a seat on the couch right behind Draco, and begins massaging his shoulders. “What happened?”
Harry takes the hint and complies. "Uh. Yeah. I think you're right. We should. 'Night Draco, get back safely." And with that, the pair turn to leave. Harry spots the rest of their group plus Belle and Ava standing and chatting at the door, but most of them - namely Hermione and Ginny - keep glancing over at them with expressions a mixture of amusement and slight horror. Harry thinks his face must look the same.
The only thing that spurs Harry to actually go to work and not mope around at home is the thought that Hermione might invite herself over again at any point and give her a piece of her mind for their conversation last night. No - it wasn't a conversation, it was a full blown argument. Probably one of the worst ones they've had in several years. Harry half expects a Howler from Ginny to drop in on his head at any moment; she and Hermione seem to have formed some kind of pact a while back, whenever Harry's being an ass to one of them, they tell each other and the other one comes and knocks some sense into Harry. It's a pretty good system, Harry begrudgingly acknowledges.
In half and hour, they've transferred Edwards to Robards' office and are finally getting an explanation out of him.
Harry feels his consciousness losing grip of the situation; it slips faster and faster until the scene in the room with Malfoy spins out of control and shatters completely with a bright flash of light.
Malfoy smiles. “It was a fantastic success, of course. Your choice of music went over very well.” Then, he reaches into a pocket in his coat, pulls out a handful of notes, and holds them out to the girl. “Here.”
The scene downstairs is....chaotic, to say the least.
“Let’s walk. There is something I have yet to show you.”
"Yeah?"
“Do you-” Malfoy hesitates for a moment. “Do you have any plans for Christmas?”
But suddenly, a desperate scream comes all the way from the other side of the playing field - from their fort, Harry quickly realizes with horror. "Don't retreat! Don't retreat! Wands taken!"
"I don't want coffee," Barclay grumbled. "I've had too much of the stuff lately. If you really want to make yourself useful, you'd stay late."
Potter shook his head and ran a hand through his hair. "You can't cook. I don't believe it."
"I apologise, sir," Draco said through gritted teeth. "Good day."
He stepped into Potter's home and began taking off his shoes and jacket as he surreptitiously took in how the Chosen One lived. It was almost the complete opposite of Draco's home. Personal mementos and photographs covered every available surface. Rich colors, plush seating, rugs, and blankets occupied the rest. It looked warm. Lived-in.
The afternoon passed in the blink of an eye and not quickly enough. Draco fidgeted in his chair, reading the same page in his book a dozen times. Three of his regulars asked if he was feeling well. When he went to refill the pastry tray at Mrs. Wilder's bakery across the street, she gave him an odd smile.
"Yes, I remember that part, thank you. Now tell me what's
"Reckon we should take him in?" Harry asked.
It was a long moment before either of them moved, but eventually, Harry lowered Draco's legs onto the bed and leant forwards to cover his body and kiss him.
"I think there's only one bedroom." Potter stepped inside and opened another door. "And one bathroom."
"Over tea."
Potter drank deeply from his pint of ale and looked around. "It's pretty nice here."
