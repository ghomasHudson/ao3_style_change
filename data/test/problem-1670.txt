“Yeah, me, too,” Harry said, but it was an automatic reaction that had nothing to do with the confused thoughts swirling in his head.
He took Draco in his mouth and felt himself harden even more, if possible, at the moan that followed. He wanted Draco liked he’d never wanted anyone or anything before, and suddenly, it was too much to bear not to be able to see Draco’s face as he fell apart. Reluctantly, he removed his mouth from Draco’s prick and slid up his body, feeling Draco’s legs fall around him—it was such an intimate position that Harry began trembling and couldn’t stop.
the children,” Harry amended, thinking of Teddy; of Rose and Hugo; of Victoire, Nickie, and Lou; of Roxy and Fred; of Molly and Lu Two. “All our families and friends, and even the Cormac McLaggens of the world.”
He wasted no time lowering his mouth to one pointed hipbone and circled his tongue around it. Malfoy arched up, somehow looking very aristocratic about it. His cock rubbed against Harry’s jaw, the tip sliding wetly over his skin as Harry lapped at his hipbone, and then further down. He trailed his tongue down, traced the crease where his leg met, then slid his hands beneath Draco’s knees to pull them over his shoulders. Thus, better positioned, he licked all around Draco’s balls, felt himself smiling smugly at the sounds Draco was making—desperate, wanton sounds that went straight to Harry’s groin.
“Think about sex,” Draco suggested, to raised eyebrows and infuriated tail flicks. He ignored them. “It reminds you what it feels like to be human.”
? Well, I suppose you somehow managed to prevent the irreversible part, too. Good job, Wonder Boy. If only you’d just not done it in the first place.”
Harry grimaced. If that happened, then there would just be more promotional material made, which would likely end up equating to more
“Doing what?” Harry managed, around a gasp. He squeezed his eyes shut, certain he would die if he opened them and this wasn’t real.
“In the meantime,” said Neville, leaning around Hannah, “we can at least measure the magical energy around the country and see if it’s on the mend. If we’ve successfully tethered it, it’ll be happy just hanging about until it finds a child it wants to bind to."
“It’s to light your way,” said Eloise. “We are the Order of the Golden Cup because we bring light to the world. A lantern is given to every fourth year on their initiation. Tonight is yours. Use the lantern to bring light to the lives of others."
Malfoy, on the other hand, would always be a twat. There had to be some constants in life, after all.
“Good, thanks,” said Draco. “Tamp it down as much as you can. In the meantime, we’ve got to show that we can solve this once and for all. If we can’t, we’ll likely get sent back to Britain and they’ll reverse everything we’ve done. As much as I’d like to go home, we can’t go under those circumstances. Potter, Mother, and I have been effectively blackmailed and if we turn up without a solution in hand, things will go even more to shit.”
Hermione was the first to ask about it, of course. “Why do you need oxygen underwater?” she called out through her Bubblehead Charm. The words came out warbly, but English.
I always thought. But I believe I did get the last laugh when she broke her hip last summer sitting down upon a chair she’d Transfigured from a feather duster just as her spell failed.”
Harry heard an exasperated sigh from the painting behind the desk, and withheld a smirk. He set his cauldron on the worktable carefully, so as not to jostle his kneazle. “He usually comes in about now.”
Andromeda eyed them flatly as she leaned against the kitchen counter. Teddy was mowing through a bowl of Frosted Niffler Nuggets, watching the men in question curiously. Saint Bartholomew, Tonks’ orphaned Kneazle, stared disdainfully at them from the kitchen table while a heavy, grey rain beyond the window set the soundtrack for Harry’s morning.
“I knew it,” he muttered, in Miguela’s pretty voice. “It’s rather harder to concentrate on an assignment when you’re panicking about your
They landed on another island, amid beautiful, broken ruins. Luna set about explaining the game to everyone, although Hermione seemed more interested in making sketchings of some old engravings on a nearby stone. Harry narrowed his eyes. She could at least make an
In answer, he kneels up and reaches behind himself, sliding his slick fingers up and down his cleft, circling his hole. Malfoy inhales sharply, unable to see exactly what his fingers are doing but all too aware of what’s happening. Harry leans forward, bracing one hand by Malfoy’s shoulder as he works his arse with the other. When he’s good and slicked up, he presses a finger inside, biting his lip at the sensation of intrusion and
Draco detoured to the whiskey cabinet and poured himself two fingers, as if he owned the place. Harry would be perfectly happy if he did. He poured a second for Harry and then brought them both over to the table. He sat, stared at the manor floorplan on the board, and then sipped his whiskey.
“You barely had one before,” Ron said, “so I don’t know. But I imagine that now that it includes Malfoy, I will, yes. I really shouldn’t have to put up with this, Harry. I really shouldn’t.”
This felt like a sacred place. The cool stone and the susurration of voices made it feel like it was important that they were here. It felt like Draco’s decision was the right one. He was scared, but he was resolved.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Because both of those can continue past the caster’s death and they can bind to a specific magical signature—which I’m almost certain was true since He was able to call one of us at a time, when he wanted to.”
your trousers. I don’t want to hear anything at all from your mother about me not keeping you presentable.”
His pale neck was flushed red, his pulse pounding in his carotid in time with their frenetic thrusts. Draco’s fingers dug into Harry’s hips, holding them together.
Neville sat down next to Harry, looking exhausted. He’d still not made it to their dorm room when Harry fell asleep last night. His tie was done very nicely this morning, though. “Hey, Harry,” he said.
His face crumpled again, but he manfully managed to restrain himself to a couple of snotty sniffs and hiccoughing breaths.
“That is why we demanded assistance under the Treaty of Paris clause MG-31,” Jones said. “We need all the help we can get or it’s going to be a bloodbath, and your Ministry is loath to aid any nation—even its own,” she added with a curl to her lip, “—without
"What are you doing now?", he asked and once he spoke the sentence, he wondered even more what was wrong with him. What did he care what Malfoy did, where he was, who he was togther with or what he smelled like. Malfoy seemed as surprised as Harry was himself.
Pansy sat on her armchair and held her hand in front of her mouth so she won't explode with laughter.
Getting back downstairs, Hermione had already bewitched the kitchen utensils to cook Harry's favourite food, while Ron prepared a stack of DVDs to watch. Harry smiled. He loved his friends so much, it was unbelievable. Harry wanted to help Hermione, but she insisted that he sat down and relaxed.
Draco sighed, clapped his hand on his forehead and stood up. He stuffed the wand in his pocket and and walked back to the castle. He searched for the two of them and in the Great Hall he found them with Longbottom and Finnegan.
afraid of him and Malfoy. But every time Harry talked to someone there, whether he knew them or not, they seemed nice to him and not out of fear. But his intoxication could mislead him, who knew?
that she was totally fine with this. But Ron? Ron made this whole thing his business and got offended, like Harry did this just to hurt him or something.
The touch of Potter's lips was firm and warm, their pressure light but undeniably there. A tentative brush of tongue was followed by Draco's lips moving against Potter's and Draco lost his ability to breathe.
"After you." Theo said, putting the newspaper on the table between them, "Around three in the morning maybe."
"But first if we but a new table.", Draco laughed and kissed Potter. How could he ever say No to this cute boy? Potter smiled.
Ron laughed too and left. Harry let his head fall back down into the pillow and groaned. What the bloody hell had happened to him?
Harry, Neville, Seamus and Dean agreed. The three girls stayed while the boys sat down on the bench in front of the shop. Ron made choking noises.
As they were only two and Teddy that evening, Harry and Ron have decided to eat on the sofa. Harry sat down his godson on his lap and fed him. When Teddy was done, Harry put him back down on the carpet where the boy played with Harry's Gryffindor scarf and Harry started to eat himself. They watched a game show that was on and enjoyed their food as the sun went down.
"Yeah well how could I if I have to figure out what you're thinking all the time because you never show any emotion?" Harry snapped.
Harry rolled around in bed. He knew it was time to get up, but he just couldn't make himself move. Hermione had been in his room three times already, saying they wanted to have breakfast. Harry had told her to start without him. Now his stomach was rumbling and he decided to get over himself and got up.
He was annoyed by their constant complaints and made his way back to his room to check if Malfoy was there.
"Could it be possible that you're under the influence of a spell or something?", Hermione suggested and Harry shook his head.
"Yeah, mate. He's given you enough trouble the last years, why not leave it alone now?" Ron furrowed his brow.
, but good, as good as a boy can look. His pointy chin, his pale skin, his silvery hair and his metallic grey eyes. Harry pushed the thought away.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, but his lips twitched into a smile as well. Harry shifted awkwardly on the spot, he felt really weird standing here just above the room where all of the terrible things have happened, and talked to Draco Malfoy like the past seven years have never happened. Malfoy must have noticed what was going on inside Harry's head, because he got up again.
Draco hugged his mother tightly when they stepped back in front of the fireplace. Since the end of the war, the Ministry of Magic had banned Draco from apparating, so he was bound to use the Floo Network every time he wanted to get somewhere he couldn't get by foot.
Hermione looked sad. “Harry, I know you said you were ‘emigrating’ but you know that doesn’t have to be true. We
“Quite a bit was going on ‘on Earth,’” said Millicent primly, “while you were up in your spaceship. Potter, Draco, and I have gone on television and performed magic for Muggles all over the world, completely breaking the Statute of Secrecy, and your mother has been exposed as a prolific reddit poster of alien encounters—she gave an interview yesterday.”
Harry rolls his neck to look up at Kreacher. He’s relatively comfortable here, in the wreckage of his own home. The couch will be a loss, but house elves are a dab hand at structural magic, so the second storey should be salvageable.
He waits until ten, hoping that it will have given Draco time to kick the mystery man out of the flat and that Druella will be gone to her Rotary Club meeting or whatever it is she does, and then just like last night, he slips past the doorman and up the elevator to the twenty-second floor.
He kissed all down Draco’s throat, and Draco threw his head back to let him. “Come…” he painted. “Come back with me.”
“Sometimes I go over to Gryffindor afterwards and eat some of theirs, too,” he admitted. They both turned, but Ron still wasn’t there. It was unheard of for him to miss dinner. Come to think of it, the other eighth year boys were missing, too. No doubt something to do with that mysterious project Ron got so twitchy about. Harry tried not to be jealous.
It hits too close to home, and it makes him pathetic, too, to witness it. Is this what he looks like? Do others see him in this pathetic, lonely way yet not know the cause of it?
Harry nodded, processing this information and sorting it into the newly formed categories in his mind. He recalled previous potions from class and committed their bases’ behaviours to memory. Now that he knew to look for it, the pattern was there all along.
Ron comes home. He always does. He’s got a special sort of domestic magic, made for warm hearths and big families, and a keen intuition when someone he loves needs him.
The sadness he’d felt in San Francisco was even more profound caught from this objective perspective. The cameras didn’t have their own emotions; they just recorded what was there, and while there were some funny scenes, such as Harry tipping his head at Hermione’s sex toy purchases and smirking at the camera, they in no way overshadowed the deep, penetrating instability that was woven through Harry and Malfoy. It was like watching someone else’s life fall apart and it
“A headache, probably,” Ron says. “That’s what I always get when Malfoy or Bones shows up at my office.”
Potter winced again. “I’d hoped you wouldn’t find me in time, at least. Forgot about the Deluminator, to be fair.”
This was news to Harry. He swallowed. “I guess it’s a good thing Voldemort never saw your tapestry, huh? He probably would have figured you and your Mum out.”
“That’s quite a logical leap, Draco,” said Snape. “After all, I am just an oil painting—one in a very small and gaudy frame at that, in Atlantis.”
She trotted in, mewed inquisitively. “I know you’re a squib,” he said, and her green eyes narrowed, but he continued, “But have you been
“Woah! Do you think she got hit with a spell?” asked Scorpius. “Or does she just have three babies?”
He passed the mobile to Pansy, who squinted down at the glass picture and then scrunched her eyebrows. Draco peered over her shoulder and felt his expression follow a similar path.
“This is a very old legend,” said Professor Orkney. “I assume these are the calculations you and Professor Sprout worked on last night?”
“It’s good that you’re gay then,” Harry muttered before his mind caught up to his mouth. His eyes shot to Draco’s, horrified, but Draco was definitely not looking at him. Was, in fact, avoiding looking at him. Harry could read him, could see right through all his Slytherinity. He was hiding something.
Draco’s hand was on Harry’s chest, pulling them flush together. He began mouthing at Harry’s jaw, down his neck. He nipped at the delicate skin there as he thrust with the rhythm of the water, tortuously slowly.
Dune gave him a ruddy-cheeked smile as he stalked over to collect his Snitch. Harry gave the next one to Hermione, and made sure to stare directly into the cameras as he did so, so that Ron would know that Harry knew exactly what he was doing. Then he gave one to Titus, because he was still a good-looking fuck, even if he did go a bit wild on the margaritas. The last two went to Socorro and Zeph, leaving just Ruby and Michael Corner without Snitches. Michael was a nice bloke, but Harry really didn’t get any fuck-me vibes from him, and Ruby was…Merlin, was Ruby gorgeous, but Harry could tell when someone wasn’t interested in him. Harry gave them an apologetic smile and they were good sports about it.
The Queen’s lips firmed. “You will find,” she said slowly, “declaring war on Atlantis to be a grave mistake.”
Potter nodded sagely. He glanced at his wristwatch and sighed. “Bugger it all, I’ve got to run or I’ll be late to the Ministry.” He grabbed an extra finger sandwich and stood. “Coming, Malfoy?”
The man reads and then nods. “I went to school in London. I know you,” he says, with only a slight accent. His eyes flick to Harry’s forehead before he adds, “You used to be able to talk. I downloaded your victory speech from MagiUpload before it was shut down.”
From his peripheral, he caught Potter rolling his eyes. They both continued to ignore the pointed looks they were getting from people who hadn’t managed to score seats on the bench.
“I don’t need to look,” Snape said. “One cat is like any other. It will swish its tail in a burner and end up setting the entire school on fire, my portrait included!”
Draco snorted. Then they were to the front of the line, and Theo’s face broke into, if possible, an even wider grin. “Draco!” he said, hugging him. “I’m getting married in seven months!”
Inside, there were about two litres of pure, crystal clear water. No aqua fortis at all. “Holy shit.”
Addolgar gave him a patient look, and then an impatient one. He sighed. “Harry, what do you think happens when hydrocarbon gases like methane from rotting Muggle waste mix with plastics, like polypropylene, which is liable to chain degradation in heat and UV radiation, like the kind that comes from the Sun?”
“I didn’t know you had a school trip planned today, Harry,” she said. “Hi, Dudley. Anyone need a carry-out juice?”
been here; he’d cleared out a number of potions and books. He just hadn’t cared about returning the marking. Harry glanced down at the parchment on top. Padma Patil. How long had she been waiting to find out she got an O on that DADA assignment?
And for Harry, it wasn’t quite the same, but there were similarities. Harry knew how to focus, too. He knew how to obsess.
“We’ve got to go,” he told them, but didn’t hear the words come out of his mouth. He said it again, over-enunciating the words and the children’s eyes tracked his mouth as they nodded.
Harry started. Luna continued to stare at him, waiting. Did he? Here he was taking up a belated interest in extracurricular reading, but did he really think he could solve the wizarding world’s problem again, or even be the one to make a breakthrough on it? Especially with research?
“This is what I meant, about the shibboleth,” said Petunia. “That joke…it’s a shibboleth of sorts. Everyone who laughed when you said it live on telly felt like they were part of a single group; and when they all saw it actually work,
, and Harry’d noticed Malfoy instead. And now, it seemed, Hermione noticed someone else, too. Which was probably for the best since Ron would come closer to being
, his mind contributed. “But you can’t blame me for being attracted to you. You were attracted to me, too, once.”
“Oh,” said Harry. He shrugged. “Well, I’ll make it then while you tell me what to do. Do you want a Pad Thai Dog or a Khao Soi Dog? You’re not allergic to eggs or nuts, right?”
He looked around, gauging their comprehension. “This isn’t a platitude. In Hufflepuff, we are a single unit, made up of many parts. We are individuals working towards the benefit of the group as a whole. Everything you say, everything you do outside of the Sett – our common room – should support and enhance House Hufflepuff. You should never say or do anything to embarrass, disparage, or otherwise harm or hinder your fellows. All grievances among housemates are to be resolved in-house, behind barrel doors, before a group of your peers at least six strong. Public disagreements are absolutely not okay. Any disagreement you may have with your fellows can be said before all of them at a time and place that does not harm the image of our house or cause undue embarrassment.”
“Oh! Right! Yeah, I brought about twenty people back with me. The ones who would come, anyway. Some of them were already…they were already gone. Brainwashed or Stockholm Syndrome or just…just too scared to try to leave.”
Harry nodded absently, still feeling somewhat dazed that his separation spell had worked on a cauldron full of
“Wanted to run,” he said quietly. He peered into Harry’s lead cauldron. The vitriol was green and oily and had a terrible smell.
“Salt, sulphur, and mercury are all required for transformation,” Snape said. “As they represent the path Divinity took when it created the world. Have you got each of these?”
And with that, McGonagall snatched the Hat from his head. Harry stumbled down from the dais as if he were weightless. He floated over to the Hufflepuff table and took a seat next to Hannah Abbott in a daze. And then, his face split into a grin. It wasn’t Gryffindor, but it also wasn’t Slytherin. He breathed a sigh of relief, and helped himself to some pudding, which tasted a little weird. He suddenly had an appetite again, and since Ron wasn’t at this table, there was food left.
Harry had stumbled on this room on the way back from his Potioneers’ Guild examination, exhausted and elated that he was within weeks of calling himself Potions
Luna pondered this. “Yes, but we have twenty-eight teaching staff, so really we do need one more Slytherin. Although, with Fleur and Flora Fortescue having gone to Beauxbatons, and Dudley being a Muggle, I suppose we could argue it’s still—technically—fair.”
“Do you know,” Luna said conspiratorially, “I’ve not seen a single nargle in the Sett since we arrived? I believe Hufflepuff may be the only house in the entire school not infected.”
“Thank you, Madam Pince, it’s a pleasure to see you again,” he replied, the words coming automatically to his lips.
had made him turn around, walk all the way across the street, and look in the Magical Menagerie’s front window when he’d previously had no desire whatsoever for another pet, ever, in his life. He’s already got the Wolpertingers in the back garden, and they frequently eat through the veg garden, which is quite enough to be dealing with as it is.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re as subtle as the portable swamp Weasley put on Granger’s side of the bed after that row they had last month.”
And so this would have to be done only by those they could absolutely trust. This would have to be their silent victory; they’d save the world, and no one would ever know it. And there was only one House loyal enough for that.
She returned a moment later with her mobile, tapping rapidly on the screen. “The owners left a list of helpful things for tourists on the icebox. I put the list in my mobile so we could get directions. There’s a few pubs nearby.”
He flicked his wand at the lights and burrowed under the covers. Hermione could coach Mrs Black through the emotional meltdown of the
He groans, pulling his cap lower over his face and leaning his back against the window as much as possible. Bugger it all; he’s still got to do hair approvals.
Draco had snuggled up close to Harry and that was basically the most amazing thing that could’ve happened, and so Harry’s night was made.
Kurzschluss initiated an introductory roundtable—a waste of a good hour and a half as they listened to self-important person after self-important person stand and recount their name, history, and assorted accolades (whether real or embellished). When it came to Potter’s turn, he stood, said:
Something was definitely not right. Now that his hearing had been repaired and the students safely returned to their parents, he could spare a few moments for the feeling of dread that had been settling in his stomach all day.
There was a cacophony of groans. Someone flung a pillow at Draco’s head, but there was so little power behind it that it fell three feet short.
It’s been years since he’s been in the same room as Malfoy without wanting to be fucked. So what that it’s not exactly a natural urge? So what if it’s magic making him? It’s not going to go away; he might as well enjoy it.
“Where on earth did you get half a dog with half a Demiguise?” said Malfoy, who was also paying close attention to the smear of blood on Harry’s chest.
“You got a new house-elf?” Draco said, fully alert now. “Mother, we can’t export an elf back to England. There’s an embargo!”
“How could you possibly know this?” Potter finally asked, making Draco pale in horror at his lack of respect for a sitting monarch.
, and Malfoy obliged him, sliding his finger in and out, in and out, in the most insidiously slow way, rubbing over Harry’s prostate. Malfoy was watching his face, his eyes flickering as he took in each of Harry’s responses and reacting to them. When Harry’s back arched, Malfoy pressed harder; when his chest heaved, he rubbed harder. Harry wasn’t even sure when he’d managed to get three fingers inside him, but he was delirious from the pleasure of it.
But he was not a Supreme Mugwump, nor a Minister of Magic, nor someone who could even have lunch with his mother in Diagon Alley. So Draco had not been consulted.
“Several batches of Felix Felicis in hopes I will be lucky enough to lose sentience before the end of the world.”
“Avada Kedavra,” Harry whispers and green light flashes and he falls apart as a vision of Draco the first time he knew he loved him flashes through his mind. Draco letting him kiss him. Draco kissing him first. Draco sliding his hand around his waist and locking their fingers together in the staff room while they held each other quietly, no silencing spells because the Department would’ve all noticed that. Draco’s panted breaths as he undresses Harry for the first time. Draco’s unhooding and Harry discovering the Unspeakable he’s been falling for is the same wizard he’d been falling for in eighth year, having pub nights with after work and neither of them had ever known they were both apprenticing. Draco keying him to his wards. Draco leaving clothes in Harry’s wardrobe. Draco the morning Harry lost him, his soft smile, his ‘Hey, Potter’, his familiarity with Harry’s body and comfort with Harry seeing his own. Harry’s body is an agony, a too-full, claustrophobic cage of much too much. He thinks he might be screaming but he can’t be sure.
Snape snorted. McGonagall’s expression was pained. “Mr Potter, perhaps you might prepare a contingency plan in the event that, well.”
. It’s all over the news in the Muggle world. They’re showing montages on televisions worldwide. They must act, and it’ll happen soon because people will need time to forget about it before the summer when they plan their holidays. No one wants to remember a beach covered in bags and used syringes.
Narcissa called them all over and explained the ward to them. It was exactly like reverse osmosis: the ward would create a semipermeable magical membrane about twenty yards out from the lowtide shoreline; what made it different from normal, Muggle osmosis was that instead of drawing ions and particles through the membrane to equalise the density of the water, it drew in large inorganic objects—plastics—by creating an false density in the outer ocean. In short the ward made the ocean think that it was already full of plastic rubbish and the rubbish floating on it needed to be moved to the other side of the ward membrane.
Draco frowned, annoyed with himself. He’d been fucking around, distracted by teaching classes and reading all of Granger’s (extensive) backlist to his son. How had that woman managed to put out thirty-four novel-length middle-grade books in two years?
Draco didn’t respond at all, but it seemed to Harry that his shoulders stiffened some. Which part provoked it, Harry couldn’t say. It couldn’t have been the last bit;
Next was Socorro, who’d built a Muggle aeroplane. “I like flying,” he said, when Harry approached. “Any kind of flying. Brooms, carpets, hang gliders…anything, really. I thought once I’d be a Muggle pilot, but they’re very careful with references and I didn’t have any legitimate school history. Beauxbatons doesn’t integrate with Muggles.”
“Okay, well I’ve got the first batch tomorrow,” Dudley said. “Portkeys are issued and we’ll head out in groups of three, as usual. Oh—hey, Draco.”
“There isn’t a wand movement, Potter, because none of the original ancient cultures needed a wand to focus their magic, they only—”
Harry breathes in slowly, retracts his hand even more slowly. He holds his palm up again, entreating Malfoy to wait. When Malfoy nods, he runs over to the coffee table, grabs his wand, and then returns to write in the air,
“Cloning,” Potter whispered, and Draco knew the literal meaning of the word, but not the emotion behind it when Potter used it.
Draco shared a look with Harry. Narcissa’s friendship with the Royal Family wasn’t new, but her exuberant demeanour was. The Healers at St Mungo’s suggested it was a coping mechanism for PTSD. After Lucius’ unexpected death in Azkaban only six months after the war, she’d rekindled a number of friendships, including those with the Muggleborn Sophie Rhys-Jones and the Pure-blood (but regrettably foreign, if Lucius were consulted) Duchess of Gloucester, Birgitte Eva van Deurs Henriksen. The happy-go-lucky personality came shortly after the late Lord Malfoy’s death and showed no signs of reversing, to no one’s disappointment.
The two headlines could’ve been written by the same person. The similarity made his stomach drop straight to the floor. The only difference was this paper was the
“Fuck, Harry, do you have a death wish?” she says, pressing her hands to his throat. She’s looking around wildly, curses flying over their heads. A blasting curse hits the table guarding them and she flinches as the impact reverberates like thunder against the Protego infused into it.
Draco pulled himself up on his elbows and somehow managed to look in control of the situation despite the utter disarray of his hair and body. “Why aren’t you naked?”
Or was it just as hard to forget it and move on? Sometimes Harry, when he woke up screaming and terrified from nightmares of Snatchers and huge snakes, would wonder if he could ever move on completely. And he wondered if Malfoy was able to ignore all that, if he didn’t have nightmares. Or maybe he did, but he refused to acknowledge that they were significant. Maybe he was still able to live his life anyway.
Somehow, he makes it through dinner, but when he finally begs off, stepping out into the chilled evening air, he doesn’t want to go home. He doesn’t know where he does want to go, but home isn’t it. He feels...riled. Antsy. So he goes to a club in Soho that he and Ron used to frequent before he and Hermione finally both decided to stop sleeping around and settle down with each other. It’s weird going in without Ron, but he gets a few appreciative looks, and that always helps.
“What happened?” he whispers again, just as helpless as before. The rest of her family are all healthy, bright white and sparkling as healthy Wolpertingers do. Her babies are snuggled close and warm and—
Harry shrugged. “Sort of looked like it. It’s all computer animated, though, and the details seemed to be missing. Like a Barbie.”
Draco rolls his head towards Harry and blinks sleepily at him. He yawns and doesn’t even bother to cover his mouth. Harry likes the way it makes his face scrunch; it’s heart-stopping to know that Draco wouldn’t let just anyone see his face scrunch like that.
“Muggle governments already know about us,” Harry reminded him. “We have a liaison with the Prime Minister, remember?”
Harry returned to his chair by the fire, pulling his feet up on the cushion so he could wrap his arms around his legs. Draco was still puttering around, trying to look busy. Those people were usually better at being convincing about it. Draco wasn’t at all. Not right now.
“Something I was forcefully reminded of last time I minded her. She and Albus ended up subscribing to a year of
“You’re getting yourself worked up because you’re freaked out, mate,” Dudley said as they reached St James Park. “I’m fairly sure Shoggoths don’t actually exist.”
“I believe you loved me before,” Harry says, out loud, because he needs to remind himself right now. Sometimes he has to say this more than once. Lately, not as much.
this morning,” said Professor Sprout quietly as she passed. They all straightened immediately, and she hummed in approval. “Good,” she said. “It wouldn’t do to be tired today."
Hermione waved him off. “Honestly, Harry, you didn’t miss much, and they were humiliating. The first month, we had to switch wands for the entire month. The second, we had to perform this absolutely barbaric vow of loyalty to one another’s families and we had to sit down with one another’s families and go through our net worths with them! With a Gringotts representative there to witness!” By the end, Hermione’s voice had gone shrill with anger.
She bought it. He hated that she bought it. Hated that no one could see what’d really happened, and that he couldn’t tell them either. He felt like he was going to explode with the weight of it.
Halfway through, McGonagall removed her glasses, closed her eyes, and began rubbing the bridge of her nose. She didn’t stop rubbing it until Potter finished the story, at which point she rubbed her temples instead.
But would they? Would Queen Sostrate convince Muggle emissaries and heads of state to release that information, for the good of the public?
He’d already turned the corner when Harry’d parsed out the insults and remembered to yell out, “Thanks, Malfoy!” but
They’d only just selected last night which texts they’d use this year—after a lesson-planning session that ate into dinner and resulted in Harry having to order takeaway for him and Al. Dudley refused to eat takeaway, which was fine with them. Harry had never seen a child put away as much Chana Masala as Albus could.
They strolled into Defence a few minutes before class started. Malfoy was there they arrived, which was not unusual. Next to him sat Neville, which was. It wasn’t until that moment that Harry realised Neville hadn’t answered his question about where he was last night. Were he and Malfoy…?
He turned his head, closing his eyes and biting down on Malfoy’s pillow to keep from making a sound. Then, suddenly, he felt wet heat engulfing his cock and the surge of white-hot pleasure that came with it. He pulled himself up on his elbows to watch as Malfoy sucked at his cock while he fucked Harry with three slick fingers.
He shifted, getting more comfortable in his spot on the floor, leaning against the wall. Should he look in the mirror? Where did Dumbledore get off on still trying to control him? He was twenty-two years old, for Merlin’s sake. He’d already done his dark lord thing, and he’d passed a Potions apprenticeship with a very bored and ornery Severus Snape. He’d more than proved himself.
“I’m just so happy to be a man. Even when I don’t have an erection, thus why I made the penis soft.”
He fished Draco’s gneiss from his pocket and levitated it to his cauldron, wrapping a protective spell around it to prevent acid from touching it just yet. The flame was still orange, not quite cool enough for his purposes. He lowered the heat again until it was a sulky, red smoulder. He released the levitation spell on the stone and it sunk below the surface, untouched.
Potter cracked one sleepy, green eye open and Draco immediately regretted his whole life. Why had he done that? He should’ve just let Potter sleep instead of forcing him to wake up and look at Draco with those unnatural eyes when Draco was really quite close to imploding like a poorly done Vanish.
“All you think about is my cock,” Malfoy continues, teasing it at Harry’s hole. “I see you, don’t think I don’t see you. You’ve been
“It’s not that, it’s,” he paused, trying to think of a delicate way to put it. “Miles was just maybe not the best person to send for a pair of swim trunks.”
Malfoy nodded. His lip remained caught. Harry stared at his mouth, paying only half a mind to the words coming out of his own. “Hermione and I did a bit of that last Christmas. She had a book on it and we were trying to…keep our minds off Ron.”
“It is magic,” she said. “When they made us, we were meant to correct their race’s defects so they might integrate with us and live on this earth, instead of aboard their starships, as they had done for thousands of years.
“What will you name them?” Narcissa asks then. She pauses delicately. “I do hope not Narcius, darling,” she adds to Draco.
Madam Pomfrey came round twice more with two different potions, and by the third, Harry was feeling almost human again. He crawled off the pouf and up into the chair to curl up with Draco. Harry rested his head on Draco’s shoulder, having every intent of going back to sleep right there.
Harry shook his head a fraction, and made a show of shovelling peas into his mouth before Ron noticed their side conversation. “Not without NEWTs.”
, and that makes it hard for us to see the long game, like some Asian cultures do. Our politicians would douse their wives in mustard gas because it smells nice, without even bothering to worry about to what comes next because it’s only what happens
Potter grimaced. “What a disaster. I was at Dudley’s watching the Man U match on his telly when my Aunt Petunia rang and asked him what he wanted for his birthday. His birthday’s in
“Second, every sample was off by a few tenths or more of a point on the pH scale from what it should be. All of the water is trending more acidic than in should be. And finally, the algae levels in the Great Lakes, Gulf, and Chesapeake Bay are off the charts.”
Ron studied the label, shrugged, and took another sip. “Yeah, shit,” he agreed. Rosie rolled her eyes but he didn’t see her. “I wonder how you make beer. I bet I could do it.”
Harry hopes for the same, but he refuses to say anything. He doesn’t want to sway Draco’s decision and have Draco end up being resentful of him for the rest of their lives. It’s not as bad as it would be if Draco does return and ends up getting killed, but it has to be Draco’s decision.
Draco flopped back down on the table. Harry moved closer, thinking of all the ways he could occupy himself while his water began to boil.
“I know,” Draco said, leaning back, one arm slung around the banquette behind Millicent’s shoulders. Harry very determinedly did not stare at it. “I’m a constant wonder.”
Draco gave her a look. He knew full well she was just as grateful to be free of a relationship in general as he was to be free of one with a woman.
Harry blinked. He would’ve thought Lucius, if anyone. But—Narcissa? Snape really hadn’t done well with male companionship, had he? Harry supposed he could get that; wizards were dicks sometimes. Malfoy a prime example.
Draco stripped the rest of his clothes off and tossed them on top of his robes on the chair. His floor was cozy-warm from well-cast Warming Charms, and he let out a relieved sigh as he padded across his bedroom to the bathroom. The house-elves had taken a survey of his preferences upon his hire, and the shower taps were already installed with the scents and water pressure he liked, which was a great luxury, even for him. The Manor’s plumbing was old and he had to set it every time he took a bath at home.
Harry thought of the few, straggled dates he’d had over the years and how absolutely horridly they’d all gone. He thought maybe he was...dysfunctional. Other wizards—and witches, when he’d still be trying for that and a family—seemed to agree. He thought maybe if he just found a good witch who would be open to his sexual inadequacy, they could have a family together and be pretty happy. He just wanted to be a dad so desperately, but there wasn’t anything to be done there since he couldn’t, in fact, get off while penetrating anyone without…outside help.
Harry asks. If it’s a flash mob, how are people being alerted to the fact that a message is even there before it gets demolished? Harry’s head whirls with dozens of different trains of thought, his instincts pinging him that something is not right.
The barrel door opened. Harry couldn’t be arsed to turn his head to see who else would be coming in, but he didn’t have to. Madam Pomfrey’s distinguished ‘Tsk tsks!’ were recognisable enough.
“He gave the prize money to Scorpius. Well, he got some house-elves and baby stuff first, but then he put the rest in Scorpius’ trust.”
“Done,” says Harry, who considers this to be a very good deal indeed. He arcs his arm out, gesturing somewhere across the room where his knapsack and the portfolios inside it are. “See my oeuvre.”
He settled into his dinner feeling as though his body weighed a tonne. He took a bite, chewed, stared out the window, which was mostly blocked by the giant, flickering jack-o-lantern in it. There wasn’t much to see; the orange glow refracted off the glass prettily, but didn’t allow for much vision. With the fire in the hearth going as well, his rooms almost felt cozy tonight.
“How are… things?” Harry asked, after a moment. At their last lunch together, Hermione had broke down crying, having just received another passive aggressive “joke” from Ron — this time an ad in the
The Queen cocked her head, listening carefully to Penelope’s words. Her Greek was solid, Draco could tell, but her Ancient Greek less so.
There was no question that this was not a coincidence. Harry was (nearly) a Potions Master; Potions Masters didn’t
Draco immediately shifted closer to Potter, his chosen bodyguard (because Potter always managed to live and if they were being attacked, Draco was certainly getting behind him), and put his hand on his wand.
He sort of hated Malfoy, but right then, he felt like maybe they were thinking the same thing. If they could both appreciate this weird-arse fish, then maybe they weren’t so different after all.
“Fifty-thousand online and ready,” Dudley said, his voice voice carrying over the rushing river and Draco’s thoughts.
“Maybe someone out there can help,” Hermione added. “You never do know what hidden skills people have.”
Madam Pomfrey rushed around their privacy curtain then, before Harry could fully process this, coming to an abrupt stop before their beds.
wearing the same black swim trunks as he had in Australia. Harry wasn’t even sure he was wearing something
Harry had to admit he had not. Petunia stood and retrieved her laptop computer from her bedroom, brought it back to the kitchen table. She opened it, waited for it to wake up, and typed a few words. Then, she turned the computer to face Harry, Malfoy, and Millicent.
Malfoy’s body stiffened. He turned sideways in his chair to face Harry fully. “For Longbottom’s theory?” he asked. Harry nodded. “Have you found anything?”
“From my discussions with Her Majesty,” Severus spoke up, “we believe we’ve determined they’re from the…
And perhaps, because magic is illogical and petty and poetic, she will be reborn again and she will teach him something about love again, and she will die again. He will watch her die because he has always watched her die.
Frankly, Harry was surprised he hadn’t, but he’d never been one to look a gift thestral in the mouth. “Well, I’m glad you’re here,” he said.
Malfoy shrugs. They stare at each other for a moment past comfortable. Harry busies himself with some paperwork he’s been putting off since Christmas. Finally, it’s close enough to six that they can walk out without looking too conspicuous—not that it matters much for Malfoy since he’s never fucking coming back, the stupid selfish fuck.
“Into a lot of things,” Ruby said, giving Harry a significant look. “Sometimes all at once.” He looked back at the tall blond, and Harry, feeling annoyed, made an excuse and swam off. So maybe Ruby wasn’t the right bloke for him. Or rather, maybe he wasn’t the right bloke for Ruby. Well, that was quite all right with Harry.
An Erumpent trundled down the stairs, or no, it was just Teddy, who skidded into the kitchen on his stocking feet. His eyes lit up when he saw the box of Niffler Nuggets, but Harry pointedly put it back in the cabinet and pointed to a chair.
The barman brings over their food, saving Harry from coming up with a reply. Somehow they manage to make it through dinner and two beers each, though Harry is seriously wondering what in Merlin’s saggy bollocks he was thinking inviting Malfoy to dinner. It’s not like they’ve never eaten dinner together before, not even like they haven’t spent weeks on end together undercover in a tiny hut, not even like they weren’t once trapped in a room that threatened to broil them alive, not even like they weren’t once magically bound to each other and had to reveal their deepest secrets to unlock the curse, not even like Harry didn’t once have to give Malfoy mouth-to-mouth after he nearly drowned in the Thames…but Malfoy won’t let him talk about that one.
“Healer, help!” he calls and a Mediwitch rushes into the room, wand out. “Something’s wrong!” Harry says. “She’s in pain or something.”
Harry unshrunk his bronze cauldron and set a low fire burning beneath. Hermione, who’d finished just before him, eyed him as he adjusted the flame height with a scowl. The burner at this desk was emotional, and it didn’t care for Wednesdays. He’d never noticed that before last week.
There was just…something. Just a little twinge of annoyance at Malfoy not even letting Harry be a professor without barging in to do it, too. This was Harry’s life; he’d made a home here at Hogwarts. He’d made a name for himself as an expert in Muggle relations and not as just the Boy-Who-Lived. He liked his job and his life, and…what if Malfoy ruined it?
Mr Lao studied his face for a moment longer, then nodded. “I never thought I’d see one of these, you know. And now that I have, I wish I hadn’t. I think we’ll all need chocolate tonight.”
Harry started practising with him; they’d sit against the wall next to one another with their shoulders just brushing, and Harry would match the rhythm of his breathing to Malfoy’s as he meditated. Everything would go quiet and still. Harry would forget the world and his boggart, and know nothing but the solid planes of Malfoy’s biceps. He’d fall deep into it, and then, just as he was starting to feel his Animagus emerge from his core, Malfoy would jerk, already half up from the floor.
He caught movement from the corner of his eye and glanced at Millicent to find her giving him a pointed look. He shrugged, helpless, sliding his eyes back to Draco. He couldn't look away, because no matter how long he closed his eyes, he couldn't help
Harry couldn’t stand the sound of his name coming from Malfoy’s mouth. Not after this. He shook his head furiously and dove for the en suite, slamming the door behind him. Malfoy banged on the door, calling his name, but Harry threw up a Silencing charm. He stared at his reflection in the mirror, seeing his bloodless skin and the dried tear tracks from his orgasm, and, if he looked hard enough, Harry thought he could see inside himself, to that piece of him that’d wanted so hard to trust Malfoy enough to let him be the one.
Now that they were in a fantasy league together, Boot thought he and Harry were mates. This assumption was incorrect. Yet he took the seat next to Harry at dinner that Malfoy had been occupying of late, and that was just not on.
“Good morning, Harry,” he said. “It’s going to be a beautiful Saturday today. Quidditch try-outs are this afternoon and while eighth years can’t play for their teams, I’m excited to see my brother and your friend Ginny try out for the Slytherin team. Say, are you still dating her? Only I think Blaise Zabini has been chatting her up lately and I’m pretty sure it’s working.”
Then he makes Harry tea, which is almost worse. The house is cold and dark and smells like burnt wood and wool, but Kreacher doesn’t say a word.
Although, even Hermione would have to admit, as Mrs Weasley brought out the pudding, that there was something different about Lavender—something strong and Gryffindor that she’d lacked all through school. And she sat with Ron on her left, as if she wouldn’t let him forget that that half of her face was covered in four long, red slashes.
She was tall, very thin, and very pale, with black eyes and very straight black hair, cut in a chic lob against her sharp shoulders. In sharp contrast to Kyle, she was wearing all black—soft-looking suede flats and a sleeveless black knee-length dress with a wide-belted waist.
He pushes her back onto the couch and crawls on top of her. She arches against him, the sharp jut of her pelvic bone rubbing against his cock and it feels amazing. She tries to pull his hoodie off, but he doesn’t let her, doesn’t want her to see the thick scar running across his throat, and she doesn’t try too hard. Harry flips her onto her stomach and trails kisses down her spine, letting the increasing volume of her moans guide his actions. She presses her bum up in invitation. Harry summons a rubber from his wallet and hopes she’s got her eyes closed.
Unspoken in there was the fact that Lee’s grandparents, who’d raised him, had died shortly after the war, leaving him an inheritance and an empty, desolate house in the Lake District—but no family to share it with.
Harry couldn’t look away. He catalogued every single detail of the moment—the overwhelming, sweet, woody smell of the chicory root from his potions kit by the door; the humidity and the coolness of the dungeon air making them flushed and gleaming and shivery; the curl of hair at Draco’s collar from his sweat; the distant sound of water somewhere above them; the heat of Draco’s mouth, and the chill that followed it when he slid it down to the tip before taking all of Harry in again. It still wasn't enough. He could spend the rest of his life like this and it wouldn’t come close to being enough.
“This is the best part, though,” Ron continued, and somehow, he’d procured a travel-size tin of biscuits and was now eating one. “The best part is that while you, Malfoy, and Mrs Malfoy have been gone, you’ve missed three votes. One passed. The other two were close. Andromeda’s been sitting the Black seat, though, and that helps.”
“Brill,” said Harry. He couldn’t promise the same, but Hermione was too distracted to notice. Pansy wasn’t, though. They left for the Apparition point outside the gates.
Hermione swiped to the next page in her newspaper. “Makes tea and coffee. Stick a pod in, put a cup underneath, press the button.”
Harry grabbed the girls directly after and dragged them outside to the shed, amid Mr Weasley’s muggle miscellanea. “What happened?”
Harry bows twice more and leaves the stage as quickly as he entered it. Malfoy has just sold ten-thousand overpriced dressing gowns for Harry. The little shit.
“I never told you how much I needed you,” Draco said, in between panted breaths. “I should’ve told you. I shouldn’t have let you think I hated you.”
His heart was tired. It had been thirteen years since Voldemort. Harry was thirty years old, and he’d spent the last nine years of his life living, pretty much, like a Muggle. He’d gone to University, read Chemistry, taken a Muggle job in a Muggle lab, and devoted himself to a fascination with the chemical of life.
Harry laughed, but it was deprecating. Well, it was worth a shot, he supposed. “Alright, Malfoy,” he said. “You win.”
For his part, Draco did not understand the relief that flooded him. It was stronger than anything he’d ever experienced. Stronger than after the battle, stronger than after his sentencing. Stronger than the day he left the Manor for the first time after his house arrest was up. The closest thing he could compare it to was Scorpius’s birth, even though that wasn’t relief at all. That was something different.
Peterson waved a hand dismissively. “That’s England for you. They socialise everything from healthcare to magical knowledge.”
“My name is Severus Snape. I was one of three Potions Masters in the British Isles at the time of my death, and the most published and cited in recorded history—but I have nothing on the Potions Masters of Atlantis. I wondered if your island had portraits that I might visit. Portraits with libraries—if I might impose on you to study some of your works.”
“Well, if they made us, they’ve obviously been around our planet a long time, and I’d bet my last Galleon they’ve been checking in on us for just as long.” She waved her free hand at the alien. “Look at it. It’s blinking but it forgets sometimes. It doesn’t need to, but it does it for appearances. And it’s trying to cross its legs. That’s a human thing—cultural. It’s been around us a long, long time.”
was, and he explained it happily, and in detail, without blushing, even as Hermione’s eyes became progressively wider. He didn’t even falter when she took out quill and diary to make notes.
There was something else she wasn’t telling them, wasn’t telling Malfoy, specifically. Harry could see it in the silent communication she shared with her husband and the way her right hand brushed too casually against her left side more than once.
“I guess not,” he said, laughing. It was true; he wasn't the hero in this story, and Harry found that he liked it. He squeezed Draco tighter and let his eyes once again roam over the brand new heather. “The others should see this, too. They helped do it.”
Harry picked up one with the unlikely name of Zwei and marvelled at the perfect design. There was a nice little handle and a lovely little curve right at the perfect spot for hitting his prostate.
, which caused Hermione to purse her lips “–but it was kind of useless. It did say that tethering magic’s usually only used on little things. That’s what this is, right? Tethering magic?”
Swimming away was a perfectly reasonable course of action when confronted by a shark, Harry was forced to admit. If one weren’t on a date with him, that is. Harry was not impressed with their lack of...sense of adventure, but at least they weren’t pissing on him. Something bumped into him and he whirled around, coming face to face with a huge humpbacked fish. It was blue, with a funny-looking face and it stared at Harry as if to convey that he was in the way and would he please move. Harry reached out, tentatively, to touch it.
When filming was finally done for the evening, Harry let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. Barcelona was a beautiful city and he’d enjoyed his time here, but he was ready to move on.
Harry clenched his fists. He hated being mocked. “Thanks. It’s really better for fumes, I’ve found. Plus, the stable temperature provided by the windowless, draught-free dungeon climate is ideal for brewing sensitive potions.”
She was his favourite Slytherin, being the lead DADA instructor. On a base level, Harry felt they were very compatible. If only she weren’t shagging Dudley (gag) and Harry weren’t shagging…well, actually he didn’t have much of a preference, but he hadn’t shagged anyone since Justin Finch-Fletchley had broken it off with him. ‘Too dramatic,’ Justin had said. Fucking Hufflepuffs.
Then on Wednesday in Slughorn’s, Harry’s Cold Cure came out bloody perfect, and when he looked back at Malfoy to share his excitement, Malfoy smiled at him, and it was such a soft, familiar sort of look that Harry had to turn back around before he lost himself in it.
, and laid it out flat on the grass. Inside, there were two straps holding back a MacBook and some notepads, a pair of trainers and gym shorts, and an empty Lara Bar wrapper. Harry pushed the shoes, shorts, and wrapper to the side and pointed his wand at the now empty side of the briefcase. He twirled his wand and said the words just as Hermione had taught him during their year on the lam, and smiled when it immediately expanded in size to a six-foot deep, four-foot wide container beneath the normal-sized opening.
Malfoy craned his neck to see into Harry’s cauldron. He looked back, expression muted. When their eyes met again, Harry knew. Even without any outward expression—he could
Or rather, Lee got the call. He was the only one of them who’d been out and about enough to distribute his mobile number to anyone of significance. And that evening, the person of significance was the Editor of the
“Transfigurations is a very worthy field to pursue,” she said to Malfoy. “Very like Potions. Perhaps that says something of you, that you excel in both.”
Why had he never said anything to Draco before? Last night had come so… easily, almost. Was it just being on another continent that made all one’s worries feel far away? Was it the Bubblehead Charm? Was it an emotional response to the Chieftess’s story?
Abruptly, Lucius stood. He walked around to his desk, bent down and retrieved a small wooden box. He brought the box back, sat down and passed it to Draco.
Harry shook his head. “No, no, in this case, morality is irrelevant. It’s only a matter of time until he really understands what he saw and then he’ll be scarred for life. Let’s do it now before my conscience closes in.”
But then, here she was with him, walking away from her failed marriage instead of trying not to ‘give up’ on it. Harry knew first hand how hard it was to stay in a relationship when one’s partner was the wrong gender, and that made it all the harder to watch their marriage dissolve, like salt into water. Pretending as if nothing meaningful had ever been there, when they all knew there had been. There always was.
“Draco,” she greets. She reaches into her purse and pulls out a small, beautifully wrapped box. “Best wishes,” she says, handing it to him. Harry stares at her, aghast. Even Hermione’s got the stupid wanker a going-away present.
“And that gives you the right to feel me up in a barrel without so much as an array of cocktails to give me an excuse the next morning?” he asked indignantly.
“So as for the Snitches. The free Snitch went to Socorro because I really liked his sand sculpture. I’ve got three left.” He gave the next one to Malfoy because—well, Malfoy. Then the third one went to Hermione because—well, Hermione. His final choice came down to Zeph, Titus, and Dune. Zeph was right out since Harry was pretty sure he remembered him snogging another man at the parade. Titus or Dune? Harry liked them both, really. Dune had those lovely freckles and Titus loved London like Harry did. In the end, he gave the Snitch to Titus because Dune’s fairytale sandcastle made him uncomfortable. He didn’t want to be anyone’s hero anymore.
painting in Potter’s rooms, of all undignified landscapes in the whole fucking castle. Draco, I am deeply disappointed in you. At least as disappointed as I was during your sixth year and no less disappointed than I was in every single class I had Potter in. God and Merlin, why have you fucking forsaken me—?”
Harry looked out at his assembled dates. Malfoy was in the front, Harry’s free Snitch fluttering in his hand. He looked stunned and yet still pleased. It made Harry’s heart do somersaults to know that he put that look on Malfoy’s face just by delivering a little Snitch to him this afternoon. He was safe from elimination this time; his letter had resonated with Harry the most.
Millicent rolled her eyes at them, eyeing their joined hands with disdain. “There’s no reason to be afraid. What are you two? Ravenclaws?”
Malfoy was already back to his book, staring intently at the animated daguerreotype of a witch morphing into a bat and back again. His bottom lip was caught beneath his two crooked canines, and it was, perhaps, the most sensual thing Harry had ever seen.
When he did, he grinned. “It’s brilliant” he said. “Really brilliant. Now you just have to do it and we can go out around the grounds in our forms and chase things and—”
Outside, there was a large clap of thunder and many of the guests screamed in surprise. Harry and Draco continued to stare at one another, with doubtlessly silly looks on their faces. Hermione’s voice rang out through
“I thought a dramatic entrance might help,” Queen Sostrate said by way of greeting. She furrowed her brows at Millicent, and then seemed to peer right through the Disillusionment on the alien—her eyes went wide, and she nodded at Millicent.
“Hello, Potter,” drawls Malfoy from his perch. He’s sitting stiffly, as Lavender’s pulling his hair one way and Pansy the other while Dean crouches before him, painting shimmery white speckles over his naked chest. “My favourite twat in a hat.”
“I’m trying,” Harry said, voice as tense as his shoulders. Draco made a pained noise, and stepped back. He couldn’t get a good grip on the cork; the gloves were too stiff. “I’m going to have to take off this glove. I can’t grab the top to pull it out.”
Hermione went on: “It says that the Clean Water Act was supposed to curb this, but that Muggles are violating it regularly without reprimand. The water’s full of ammonia, cyanide, and chlorine! No wonder everything’s dying!”
They all went through the spell a few times until Narcissa was satisfied, and then Kaylen the house-elf passed out croissants, currant scones, and pears. They sat on the line dividing the United States and Canada to eat. Kaylen came round with Portkeys for all of them. They were made of compasses and had an official MACUSA seal on the back.
, he remembered. Draco knew what he was doing. Draco wasn’t fucking with him. It wasn’t a game. Hufflepuffs didn’t do that. He
Ron nodded. “Megan Jones I think. She’s trying to date Wayne Hopkins, if you can believe Ernie, which I suppose you can since he was a Hufflepuff.”
For a moment, he thought he smelled eucalyptus in the air, but no…that was just a memory from long ago. Their magic had once sloshed together between them, but now it was no longer theirs.
Harry was still frowning down at the sort of peach tint to his arm. Bugger, he was going to have to drink lemon juice to counteract it.
Draco was both, and finally Harry was beginning to understand his sorting. Piece by piece it came to him. And now there was this new piece that said Draco believed in saving the world because his people were in it. And Harry was one of those people now.
Slytherins might not be cowards, but it appeared that they didn’t bounce back from abject terror quite as quickly as Gryffindors.
Hermione’s lips quirked. “As you say.” He scowled again, and very definitely did not think of how he hadn’t protested at all when
he thought. His brow furrowed as he tried to understand what the loss of a best mate would mean to his life. The Weasleys were ignorant of this sudden bout of inner hysteria, and as happy as they could be, short one member. He and Hermione, fresh off a portkey from Australia, sat at one end of the Burrow dinner table and felt distinctly
Peterson looked around, reminding Harry distinctly of Zacharias Smith at his douchiest. “Do you see any Muggles here? They
“He’s still a Master,” Harry said. “He doesn’t forget everything when he dies, does he?” He turned to Professor Snape, smirking. “You didn’t forget, did you?”
A beat passes, and then Draco smiles at him. That little secret smile he saves for Harry because the rest of the world gets his Bitch Battalion sneer instead. Harry’s breath leaves his lungs in a great whoosh, leaving his legs wobbly and his head dazed. God, he loves that smile. He takes two decisive steps forwards and bends to wrap his arms around Draco’s thighs, ignoring his squawking at the paint all over his robes. He lifts Draco up and carries him up the stairs to the bedroom he hasn’t slept in in six weeks.
Then Javier said that the lighting had been all wrong and they’d had to re-shoot the whole thing, which was bloody humiliating since everyone still had to act surprised and Michael and Ruby had to pretend like they didn’t know they were getting dumped.
Healer Gaelan nods once, shoots a shaky Patronus into the corridor behind them, and a dozen Mediwizards and Mediwitches rush in. Harry gives Gaelan a final warning glance, and then returns to his post beside Draco, to stoically suffer the systematic crushing of each of his metacarpals.
He took a moment to wonder who the fuck had their son before he remembered he would be sleeping with Albus Potter and the Demiguise-dog. Ginny was not in the room, though Luna was. At least someone was with the boys.
“We’re taking a Portkey this time,” Draco said. “Remember? You took one to see Granny at Christmas.”
“Perhaps,” Lucius agreed. His eyes tracked Draco’s face, searching for something. “If she is, it’s all Draco’s doing. He has always been our saving grace.”
When the decision came, it was almost freeing, in a way. He was terrified of undertaking a Potions apprenticeship, but it felt…right. He would be defined by this moment, he thought, where he abdicated the part of him that was rubbish at Potions, and became only the part of him that was great.
Harry heard a bubbly shuffling from the stainless steel worktable on the side of the room. He looked over and saw Seabiscuit staring dourly at him from his tank. He tapped his little tail on the glass in the direction of his fish flakes. Fuck, Harry’d forgotten to feed him this morning. He should’ve put a mobile alert on for
There’s nothing wrong with being afraid of something; maybe there’s something wrong with letting it control your life. And anyway, he’ll never tell Draco, but he thinks that’s all too generalised to be true. Harry has fears just like anyone else, and there are times he’s sure they were actual phobias. He doesn’t really think that being terrified of Voldemort or war in general or even being expelled from Hogwarts was a bad thing. It’s the
“Cluedo,” Draco repeated slowly. His quill remained erect in his hand, the owl waiting ungraciously on the open window sill. A well-placed containment spell kept the rain pouring down outside from blowing into the house.
“Well, we showed them the alien, too,” added Millicent, gesturing to the still-floating creature—it was rather more bruised than it had been before.
Harry settled casually into Malfoy’s side as the game started, pointedly ignoring Gin’s grin and Dudley’s suspiciously unsurprised smirk.
Addolgar Rees caught him outside of Transfigurations. “Walk with me, Harry,” he said. “I’ve been reading that book you ordered, the one on Muggle chemicals.”
Draco lifted one of his hands from the bed and held his palm out, shaking only a bit. “Give me some,” he panted. Harry poured oil into his hands and watched, engrossed, as he slicked up all his long fingers. “Come here.”
“Aqua fortis,” said Harry, and nodded once, more to convince himself than to convince Snape or Draco. It was the best base for separating and refining, and that was precisely what they wanted to do: separate out the diseased, cloudy areas, and refine the stone into one of pure ‘health’, without, somehow, discarding the cloudy bits. Which meant they would first have to make it a stone of pure disease, and
“I can and I will,” said Malfoy, no longer uncomfortable whatsoever. “Do remember that I come from Slytherin, where it’s perfectly acceptable to hex a housemate so long as it’s done behind closed doors, and not for the consumption of non-housemates to see or hear of.”
“I don’t think anyone’s ever tried it,” Su Li said, “but… theoretically, I suppose… well really I don’t see why not,” she continued, gathering steam. “Now that I think about it, it’s perfectly reasonable. Muggles are entirely the same as us genetically. It’s been long believed that it’s exposure to magic at the embryo stage that creates a magical core in a child. It’s late, but children under eleven are still developing – a sudden, heavy exposure to magic might yet be able to create a core.”
“Ahhh, Professor Potter, Professor Malfoy, have you come to discuss Hogwarts's policy regarding conduct in the workplace for romantically involved staff?” she asked.
“I doubt the Americans are going to go for an enhanced Obliviation resolution,” Daphne said. She waved her article in the air pointedly.
“About ten metres per second for a European Swallow,” Luna says. “I’ve never studied an African one. Let me just make a note for my next trip to Johannesburg…”
“Potter.” Draco kicked his shin a bit. Harry scowled. “You had a look on your face I haven’t seen since summer holidays after third year.”
Astoria glanced at the alien on the table, back to Draco. Shakily, she lifted her cup to him. He nodded. Then she put her head in her hand and didn’t move again for the rest of the meeting.
Neither of them made mention of the fact that they were likely to end up there without their magic. Not that it would make much of a difference in gaol.
Draco seemed to like this even less. He sneered at Harry and then turned, pasting a smile on his face. “Hello, Kyle.”
“Don’t be daft, Malfoy. You’re so good, she and Dumbledore’s portrait are probably up in her office right now, rubbing their hands together like evil villains and cackling over getting your Transfig talent in their clutches.”
“Of course it is,” Draco said, huffing. He crossed his arms. “So you’re telling me that you came to see me every month because you liked our enemyship and then when you realised you wanted to rut against me, you decided to stop coming ‘round.”
Malfoy throws his head back, gasping for breath. His chest is flushed; the white speckles from the show glimmer, making his skin look ethereal and almost translucent. Harry traces his fingers over as many as he can reach and delights in the way Malfoy’s muscles clench in their wake.
Jones froze. “Are you on the terrorist watch list? We had you all checked when your Ministry gave us your names, but if you’ve hacked the system—”
“No, she was really into a conversation with Luna about tombstone rubbings and spirits being trapped in art.”
That doesn’t mean that he actually expected it to happen, though. When it starts to feel amazing again, it catches him by surprise, so the loud, slutty whine he makes can’t be held against him.
Harry smirked. “Dunno. Floo your mum? You could try the Tesco for formula. Anyway, love you man—it’s been real, but I gotta go. I’ve a date with Hermione in the morning.”
“It changes the wizard enough to override his original form,” Snape insisted. “How then, is he able to transform into his Animagus while under the effect of the potion in the first place?”
She looked at him funny. “Well no one really likes their boggart, do they? But they do typically like Christmas presents.”
He, Ron, and Hermione managed a few hours together at Hogsmeade that weekend, but all of them were a little distracted by the current goings-on in the outside world. Even Ron, who tried to pretend like he wasn’t scared, was affected by the generally dampened atmosphere hanging over the wizarding world.
“Obviously,” said Snape, which made Draco start snickering again. Snape gave him a confused look, but was unwilling to ask why that so amused his godson.
“Draco, do speak to the house-elves on the way back,” Delta said, rolling her eyes. “Perhaps you can consult with them on the construction of their impenetrable wards.”
him. Miles had set his camera aside and was now performing a gentle Summoning charm on Hermione. She resisted for a moment, but then leaned up to give Harry a peck on the cheek before walking off to join the other wizards, head high.
“We can do the stitching in a number of patterns as well,” said Coddler, and with a few more taps demonstrated several masculine-looking stitch patterns for the embroidery.
“Good, good. Excellent,” Luna said, noting this down. She wrote dozens more words than Harry’d said. He tried to peer over at her notebook, but she snatched it away. She looked up at him. “And what else?”
Hermione landed first, and Harry settled just in time to see her lurch to the side as her crate settled on the uneven surface of several shore rocks. He held tight to her hand, barely keeping her from falling all the way down and scraping her hands on the rocks.
But then his descent stopped and he looped back up and Harry fell in love for the final time that night because this wizard had just dived off a fucking bridge and mounted his broom a metre from the water. He corkscrewed up, robes trailing behind him like a banner of masculinity. His long pale hair streamed out and Harry had to shift his legs to try to get his dick to lay properly again.
“I have believed in magic since I was ten,” Petunia said. “When my sister first changed a flower into a butterfly.”
Potter ran through the story with a minimum of detail, and even Severus looked horrified at the end.
Harry pursed his lips, frowning as he did as directed. The clues were straight-forward, on par with the maths Teddy was already doing with ease.
The office was bright and airy, with a whole wall of windows looking out onto the Forbidden Forest. That nostalgic ache Harry felt in Hogsmeade only intensified now. This was the room in which Harry had fallen in love with Draco.
Harry snorted, unable to prevent the laugh that burst forth. He had no desire whatsoever to send Draco to Antarctica, but…well, maybe there was something in that suggestion. Something completely different from what Ron intended. Harry diverted back to the Quidditch shop. There was, in fact, something Harry could get him, something that he wouldn’t be able to get on his own, something that would hopefully show Harry had no intentions of caging him.
Harry pushed back from the wooden worktable, tapped some flakes into Seabiscuit’s tank. Sometimes, he reckoned Seabiscuit would’ve been better off if he’d left him in the sea, tangled in all that kelp and practically buried under—
Then the trembling lessened, and finally subsided. He took a deep breath, feeling suddenly exhausted, probably mentally. Draco was standing in front of him, frowning severely.
“It’s only twenty per cent mica schist,” Harry said, instead of answering. He’d had to do something to distract him, since sleep wouldn’t come; thinking about Draco’s stupid rock had been the method. “Another thirty-five per cent feldspar, seventeen per cent marble, twelve of basalt, eleven of biotite, and two of other bits and bobs. Only three per cent quartz. But I looked at Draco’s, and it was at least sixty, sixty-five per cent mica. Which means, he was able to transfigure a stone to a non-majority mineral, and when it reverted, it went to mica instead of feldspar.”
Harry scowls, suddenly annoyed that she’d figured this out ages ago when it only hit him while having sex with a woman. Ron stammers out a hopeful, ‘Are you
the stone to remove any surface impurities and set it inside his cauldron for safekeeping. “Professor?” he called.
“Fuck, that’s a lot. Well, um, math…”  He searched around and found a spare notebook and biro. “Okay, so it would take one oyster 750,000,000 days to clean the Chesapeake Bay, which I’m guessing is too long. So to clean it up in, say, a month, we’d need… 25,000,000 oysters.”
Potter’s aunt looked on, horrified. The Grangers senior were pressed back in their chairs, as if trying to escape the conversation. Weasley had his head in one hand and Millicent and Dudley looked deeply uncomfortable.
Malfoy hesitated for so long that Harry knew he’d lost him. He began to pull away, but Malfoy made a strangled sound in his throat and dove forward, pressing his mouth against Harry’s. Harry kissed him back, pouring everything he had into it. Somehow he managed to walk them backwards until Malfoy was lying back on his desk and Harry was kissing his mouth and jaw and the delicate space behind his ear.
“Just look at it,” Dudley said, gesturing towards the mobile Pansy still held in her hand. “It was in the sky, just hovering there. As big as the Quidditch Pitch, just sitting there, no more than a thousand or so feet up. Black as night—so black, I’d swear it actually devoured the light around it. And it was so utterly silent. Not a hum. It wasn’t natural, nothing any human—magical or Muggle—made. I’d swear on my life.”
Hermione made a disgusted face. “Oh, it’s absolutely vile,” she said. “It’s a set of wizarding wedding traditions, and they’re wretched and barbaric and should be outlawed, but unfortunately they’re required to make a magical marriage legal in Britain…” She trailed off, no doubt running through ways to have such laws overturned, but then she shook her head and muttered, “No, I’m done with that,” she added to herself.
“Baby Malfoy,” Draco says, scowling. He then turns around to scowl more directly. “I carry, I claim as heir. You want an heir, you can damn well carry one.”
“It translated to something like ‘Welcome to Istanbul. Stay as long as you want, and be sure to see the Republic Monument.’ The next week, Taksim Square was bombed and two Turkish Aurors killed in the explosion.”
He breathes in, feels his eyes sting as he breathes out but he’s too drunk to know why. The part of him that’s still sane knows this is important, but the rest of him just feels a great, pathetic sort of yearning. He presses his lips to Draco’s neck and Draco tips his head back. The neediness intensifies, overwhelming and painful and Harry isn’t sure why but he makes a small sound and kisses harder, running his hands up Draco’s arms and then swinging one leg over to straddle him. Harry leans down, bringing their mouths together and he kisses Draco with everything he’s got. His fingers curl in soft, familiar hair. His thighs tighten around familiar hips. His nose brushes against familiar skin. Draco wraps his arms around him, pulling him in and Harry could cry from this contact. He’s been so alone, and he could’ve had this.
Draco curled his lip at the following display. The strange surge of something he’d been feeling evaporated. Merlin, if he never had to see Millicent snog Dudley again, it would be too soon.
Malfoy seems content to stay where he is, which Harry can’t have. He thrusts his hips up, encouraging.
Narcissa came in, wrapped tight in her dressing gown, a faint smile on her face, until Millicent and Potter stepped out behind him, the alien between them. She shrieked, her hand flying to her mouth. Lucius came running in, catching her before she stumbled backwards.
“Hear from your cousin yet?” Harry asked stiltedly. He was having a beastly time trying to figure out how to talk to Malfoy, or if he should even bother. On the one hand, he sort of hated Malfoy; but on the other, he didn’t at all. And really, he wasn’t sure if he was trying to talk to Malfoy because they were housemates now and Hufflepuffs liked all their housemates or because he found Malfoy rather fit these days and was in that mental place where one couldn’t stop oneself from trying to make conversation, in the vain hope that it will lead to snogging and perhaps a quick arse-grab.
Harry scowled at his swollen wrist. It wasn’t fair that he was being refused a quick healing because she wanted to lecture. “It was an accident. My apprenticeship involves conducting experimental potions. Explosions aren’t unusual. I took standard precautions.”
“My hands have moved down to his hips, and I’m struggling to divest him of his trousers without letting him move away from me for even a second. We slide out of those and our pants, and then it’s just skin. Hot, damp, affecting; our breaths humid and fast between us. I’m too undone to take everything in; my system is overloaded with sensation.
said Malfoy. He paused, thinking. He smiled, as though he were trying hard not to but couldn’t help himself.
Teddy ignored him. He came and stood right next to them, making the both of them look awkwardly at him from the side while still hugging, and in Draco’s case, with a hand still on Harry’s crotch. Teddy cleared his throat and Draco removed his hand.
Draco nodded, chugged the remainder of Harry’s beer, and summoned two more from the icebox. “This beer is shit,” he added without emotion.
The door opened. Draco came in carrying Severia. “Harry,” Draco bit out. “It’s six in the fucking morning. What the fuck are you—”
“But the other Nations are suffering, too, Malfoy,” said Hermione. We can’t fix one area and not the other. It’s not right.”
Harry, lost and confused at this turn of events, stumbled to his normal desk with Ron. They dropped their bags on the table and started rooting for their inkwells, but it had so happened that Harry’s favourite green one had tipped over in his bag, so he had to share Ron’s purple one, all the while doing his best to siphon off a load of green ink from the Advanced Transfig essay that was due to McGonagall later that day.
“But that death could come from a failing marriage,” Hermione adds. “Domestic violence is real even in the magical world.”
“I thought you were going to send me home,” she whispered, though they were both wearing magical microphones and couldn’t escape being recorded.
“I’ll leave you two to whatever it is you’re not talking about in front of me,” Dudley said, after a moment. Then he wiggled his eyebrows suggestively and walked out of the room, barely fitting through the doorway where Malfoy was standing.
Though he’d been distracted for most of the discussion, the only conclusion the group had come to was that they should either alert the ICW or not. The vote was split.
But he couldn’t. Not now, at any rate. Now, they needed to lie low and figure out their next move. Before the ICW caught up with them. No doubt the Ministry, bumbling as it was, wasn’t far behind, either.
Harry lifts his head enough to say, “She’s here,” before lowering his mouth again. Draco nearly breaks his nose for the second time when he bucks up, panicked. Harry manages to push his hips back down and adds, “Be still. I locked and silenced the door. Auror grade spells.”
If Draco had died and Harry had never known, he would have drowned right there with him, and been nothing but a Dementor shell that went through the motions of all his days without any fears or dreams to feed on.
He Vanished the wellingtons and put his gloves back on, looping his arm through Draco’s. They stood there, watching the sun fight through the grey December morning. Harry snuggled in closer, and Draco tipped his head to lean against Harry’s.
But there was nothing saying he couldn’t sleep down there. He got up, opened his luggage again, and stepped inside.
“The art one, obviously,” Harry said. “Do you really think Mrs Black would give a single fuck about aerospace or Native American history?”
Malfoy smirked. Harry hated him because eight years had done nothing but make him more attractive than ever. His hair was longer than Harry’d ever seen him let it get—down to his shoulders and wispy. His chin was still pointy enough to cause questions at the airport, and his eyes still looked permanently narrowed, but Merlin, those shoulders—that scrawny waist, those slim hips. Harry was not a man with a type, but he hated that Malfoy was fit and attractive anyway.
Translators scurried to relay this question, but already reporters were reading messages from their mobiles:
managed to keep his cool around Draco. It’s not like he’s Mister Suave or anything. He’s just… relatively happy with himself on most days, and brave or stupid enough to put himself out, lay himself bare, for a chance at something he wants.
“Didn’t think you liked him,” Millicent said. “You just stare at him with this dour look whenever we’re in staff meetings. Frankly, I’m surprised you didn’t try to kill one another in Atlantis, while you were safe from British legal reach.”
“It would be great,” Hermione insisted. “There’s a void in the market, and we can fill it, Harry. Wizards and witches don’t even know they need wedding planners, but remember what a spectacle the Montague-Kilgore wedding was last summer? The
Harry took care of a few last minute adjustments to the decor, checked that the food was being properly warming-charmed, decided to go up and knock on the door to Padma’s room and make sure she’d really shown up (she had), and finally found himself free of obligations. It was then that Draco came back down the stairs, looking exasperated.
“You had to bring Professor Sprout into it,” Addolgar Rees said witheringly, as he passed Harry to enter the barrel. “It isn’t fair to use our dedication and loyalty to get what you want."
“If you’d rather go to New Orleans, it’s entirely up to you,” says Luna, shrugging. “Only, I thought you wanted to remain
Snape sneered. “Potter, do you know what will happen if you let that sulphuric acid remain heated too long? It will—”
“Something common, something worthless…” said Harry. He trailed off, thinking, but was coming up with nothing. What was worthless? Voldemort. The Chudley Cannons. Life without Draco.
Draco returns with the tea. Harry’s fingers shake as he lifts his from the saucer and takes a sip, just to be polite. It’s full of whiskey, so he takes another. Draco sits down heavily on the couch next to him, the heat from his body radiating outwards in all directions like a sun flare. The tea and whiskey is not enough to keep his hands occupied; they keep aching to reach over and touch Draco somewhere, anywhere. This shouldn’t feel unusual. It shouldn’t feel awkward. They’ve touched innumerable times and Harry knows precisely the feel of Draco’s forearms, how thick the blond hair is on them, the direction it lays. He knows the places Draco has sun freckles and the shape of his feet.
“We should go back in,” said Harry, forcing himself to take a step backwards. “You’ve still got to do that human transfiguration on me, and I’d rather be in my rooms for that.”
Harry hates the thought that he might’ve somehow threaded Draco so completely into his life that he won’t ever know how to have it when Draco’s string unravels. He doesn’t think this is the answer Luna’s looking for. Surely it can’t be healthy to choose to continue to live only for one person. He’s supposed to be a self-sustaining entity, isn’t he? Capable of surviving alone?
It was just Draco’s luck that after narrowly escaping prison, and both his parents somehow also escaping prison, his life would turn around so spectacularly—seven years of travel with his son, studying everything he could find on the only subject that had ever held his interest for more than a month, landing a job that was practically made for him and getting to prove all those bitter do-gooders wrong—only for someone to decide it was a great time for Atlantis to resurface in one stupid explosion. And apparently half of all magical people now preferred Muggles over their own culture, too.
“If I may,” Malfoy said in his crisp tones, and they all looked to him for whatever great insight he had—he was the fucking Cultures and Casting or some other posh shit teacher after all—but what he said was, “What the actual fuck is this? It can’t be real.”
The adults were left in the esteemed company of Saint Bartholomew, who was presently cleaning his arse atop Andromeda’s couch.
His mind healer looks at him for several moments, processing the Muggle terminology, and staring blankly at him while she does. Finally, Luna blinks. She notes down several things on her pad and then smiles at him. “Draco likes danger as much as you do,” she says. “He just doesn’t want you to die from it.”
Potter met him back in the dungeons an hour later. He pressed a toastie into Draco’s hands while he shoved another in his own mouth. Their footsteps echoed as they took the corridor to the room the alien was tied up in. Draco’s breath ghosted in front of his face; he’d forgotten how cold the dungeons got in December.
them, they’re all going to wake up from their lucid dreaming and realise that magical people make really excellent human sacrifices to the Old Gods.”
He considered this. “Maybe. Probably. I just know that I don’t want to be an Auror because everyone expects me to, and I want to know what it’s like to really love magic like you do. I think maybe I could learn to love Potions. My boggart says I’m afraid of being like I am, so maybe what I’d really love is something I never would’ve guessed before. I have to know. I can’t stay the same.”
“Nope,” said Sephora. “Said he had an errand to run with that super cute heir of his. He’ll be out all morning.”
by Zadie Smith before Hermione forced it on them, and they were both notoriously slow readers. Like all their Muggle literature choices for their upper years, the hope was that it would help to illustrate merging cultures—the good and the bad—in a way magical children could understand.
Sometime during the evening, Draco swallows his pride and puts on the glasses. Harry doesn’t comment on it. He likes it too much to risk their removal. It’s hot this time of year, Draco’s got his shirt off again, and the way his spine bends as he leans over to read the black file in his hand makes Harry burn. He doesn’t comment on that, either.
Harry shrugged, feeling uncomfortable. “Hermione’s been dying for another girl to be friends with for so long, I think she latched onto the first one who shared an interest with her. No one in Gryffindor really…gets her.”
. Felhunters were the reason Harry picked that class, and he’s wanted a pet Manticore ever since, but of course he’s not that big an idiot.
Kyle shifted from one foot to the other. “I’ll go in at first light and start working on everyone I can. I’ve built a few favours up since I moved to the Non-Magical Political Liaison Department.”
Finally, Teddy and Rosie were on the train, and Hermione returned to Harry’s side to wave her off. Harry smiled and waved at both of the kids, but his eyes kept flicking back to Draco’s back and his own waving and his secret calls of encouragement that only Teddy and goblins could understand.
Draco ordered Floo-delivery curry for them and they settled into the comfy couches around Harry’s living room to eat, while Draco and Millicent complained of the interiour of Grimmauld Place.
“I wish I had a portrait of Professor Flitwick to carry around,” Luna said. “He’s rather handsome, isn’t he? But he isn’t dead, so it wouldn’t work anyway. It’s okay, since he’s very easy to find when I have questions about my projects.”
Harry laughed, which was totally the wrong response in a time like this but he couldn’t help it. Absurdity led to absurdity.
Nott shrugged. “Oh, fine, I’m sure. You know Draco. Complains about everything.” Nott hesitated, but then added, “They put him with a junior Auror. He’s back on the kiddie investigations.”
if something happened. He could have died from some, some…” She waved a hand about, searching for a word, “fume. It’s a blessing Malfoy was up early to check on a Transfiguration project…”
Lucius’s ten years of house arrest had been increased to fifteen, broken up by his forty hours per week of community service for the Ministry. The same sentence length as Narcissa’s, but Lucius got to walk through London every week. He got to stop at Gringotts during his break, or even have lunch at one of the cafés in Diagon.
“You have a choice now,” Harry says, surprised at the levelness of his own voice. “It isn’t a perfect choice, I’ll grant, but it is a choice. We can choose to enter this bond together, willingly, even though neither of us will ever know if it’s fully—fully
“Woah, that sucks! I really like those gals, too. Whenever I go out to LA to visit my sister, Taylor, I always try to catch a few waves with the ones over there. The Pacific Nation, I think. They’re real cool. So what are you gonna do to save them?”
“So. You’ve fifteen Snitches here in this bag. Everyone who gets one will get a chance to win your heart. The nine who don’t are going home at the first Portkey tomorrow morning, never to have the chance to know your tender soul. How do you
“I will tell you a story,” said Queen Sostrate, watching the house-elf pour three goblets of honey-water and place figs and cheese on golden plates.
Draco rolled his eyes, and turned towards the living room, but stopped when the floo flared to life. There was a startled yelp and a clanging sound that sent Harry’s heart into overdrive, as memories of a cauldron full of Fiendfyre roared through his mind. He turned at once, already calling his magic forth, and flipped his hand, sending a spell to stop the gravy cauldron before it tipped over; Hermione’s travel bag had knocked it swinging.
, Harry writes, and everything in Malfoy’s expression changes, shutters down like shop windows before a hurricane.
“Brought you a cheese and chutney sandwich,” Ron said. She beamed at him. It was her favourite kind.
Half the palace had been blown away in some explosion, the rest of it on fire. The Muggles filming it were somehow floating in the air, for the shot was an aerial view. The beautiful fountain in the centre of the promenade leading to the palace was cracked, water pouring all over the cobbles.
“Fuck you,” Draco says before bending to kiss Harry. They wobble on the steps briefly, not because Draco’s heavy but because he makes Harry’s legs weak. Harry groans into the kiss and takes them the rest of the way up. He didn’t come
“Exactly,” said Harry. “If the Golden Cup all worked together, we could probably do one landfill per night. Go in, sort the chemicals into better stuff – we’d have to research that, but my first thought is carbon for the soil, lots of water, some oxygen, depends on what we find in the samples. Then we could use a basic rotting spell, like the ones from Potions class, just on a larger scale, to decompose all the organic matter in their trash. It would fertilise the ground, and the water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide released would help the plants grow. We could transplant some trees from the forest and try to get some more daffodils and things growing. That could keep us stabilised until we figured out what the worst chemicals are and how to get them from the soil and water; that’s not as easy as just picking one rubbish dump and sorting it out.”
Harry writes, which, okay, it’s melodramatic, but in case no one’s noticed yet, he’s a jobless, partnerless, voiceless, sanityless bloke who’s been dead at least once before. He’s entitled at this point.
“This is part of apprenticeship, Potter. Withstanding the effects of potions one does not find entirely comfortable. It’s imperative that a Potions Master is intimately familiar with every potion he brews.”
And then, he understood it, understood the last part as he’d come to understand the four steps before it. The crow was Harry and Harry was the crow, and he did shrink, and did change. It took ten minutes at least, but he’d done it now, and he knew it would be instantaneous next time.
That was certainly a question to be considered, Harry thought. What went through a man’s mind to pull such a high-handed political stunt?
Harry sipped his sugared tea. Beneath the table, Draco’s fingers brushed his wrist and he looked over, found Draco smiling back at him.
“Good morning, Dudley,” Malfoy said. He gave Harry a pointed look, swept past him into the Great Hall.
“You didn’t say you were changing his portrait!” Harry said, covering his mouth. The idea of Snape having an official portrait in Harry’s rooms was kind of grim, but also kind of hilarious.
There were bodies. Everywhere. Bodies in the red of the guards’ uniforms, bodies in the brightly-coloured linens of the city folk, bodies of the strange Atlantean house-elves, bodies of Salukis and Pomeranians, and near the Queen’s demolished garden, one black Cane Corso, lying limp by the succulents.
“Hello?” he called, rushing in from the Floo Parlour. “Teddy? Ready for your first day of Hogwarts, champ?”
But Draco had grown exponentially since those early years of studying ancient magic. He knew Atlantean spell-casting as well as he knew modern casting now. They could do this.
But now there were other things that made life worth living—Albus, of course. Always Albus. Gin, who was probably the best ex-wife in existence. Hermione and Ron, who would always be his first and best friends. The Weasleys. The knowledge that something as amazing as Hogwarts even existed. His rekindled relationship with Dudley—saving Dudley from these things. His students.
“I’ve never seen that in my Muggle Studies texts!” said Hannah. “How could they leave something like that out? It’s horrible! They bury it? Even… even the bad things? What about plastics and chlorine bleach?”
Harry had not realized that. He makes a face, then throws one arm over his eyes as he struggles to catch his breath. Merlin fuck, that had been hot. “We all have our idiosyncrasies,” he says.
He decides to give himself the month to think things through, not make a hasty decision, and so answers (sort of) an ad he sees for a bedsit sublet near to the Embassy. It’s already furnished and moving in entails picking up his Bottomless Bag from his hotel room, checking out, and Apparating to an alley nearby. The landlord gives him a key and an odd look, his eyes noting the scars on Harry’s face, not just the lightning bolt one.
He sent those zooming out to the students, and when no one immediately started groaning, got the worrying sensation that his first class was going well. That could only mean one thing—it could (likely would) get worse.
Harry paused, then quickly continued to his desk, dropping the biscuits on a spare piece of parchment and setting his tea on a well-ringed patch of wood. “Who?”
When he finished his last set of 100 stirs, he set his rod aside and took a moment to just look at his potion and feel calm. It was perfect. Better—it was
In this half-state, he gets a feeling that something is coming— a blackened, rushing sort of feeling that makes him shudder momentarily before he shakes it off and goes back to running his fingers over the bones in Draco’s back. Draco curls up into it, presses his face further into his pillow. They have only been dating for six weeks now, but it feels like this is it; it feels like if this were to end, then so would Harry. How is it that he’s known Draco nearly his whole life, and he’s wanted him so fucking much for six years, and he never even kissed him before six weeks ago?
Hermione grinned. “I know.” She shifted her briefcase to the other hand with a huff. “To be honest, it was more because I had court the next morning and didn’t want to get into an all night giggle fest. It’s been ages since I’ve had a decent sleep. Ron’s been on assignment more often than not, and when he’s home, we—” She broke off abruptly, smiling at him in apology. “Sorry. Ignore me. I’m just a little tired right now.”
“It was like one long Malfoy game,” Hermione agreed. She shrugged. “But I got a little holiday out of it when I most needed it, Lee finally met someone he connects with, and you finally got that chance with Malfoy you’ve been gagging for for years.”
Harry fought not to drag him in and kiss him for all he was worth. He swallowed, his throat heavy and thick. “Goodnight, Draco.”
“Harry,” said Hermione, always his wingwoman, even if she was sometimes an entire conversation too late. “Did you re-brew the Heart Helper? You were struggling with it last week.”
. He’s a lazy sort of exerciser, so he only does it when he’s forced to because it’s part of his workday. When all he has to do is sit at home in front of his telly, well, that’s all he does. He could do some push-ups in front of the couch between games like Draco used to, but he doesn’t give enough fucks to bother. He’s always been able to stay in shape with just his on-the-job training, and the discipline to go further is, quite frankly, beyond Harry’s capability right now.
To his surprise, Demelza seems to get it. She sighs and stands, stretching her arms over her head and yawning. “I told Dawlish it was a bad idea to put two explosive Aurors together, but no one else was willing to work with you.
. He heard an agonised keening sound and distantly understood that it came from him. Draco was his love, and he’d sort of said he loved Harry, too, and there would never be anyone—
“I’ve just put the kettle on,” said Mrs Granger, her voice slightly accented, though Draco couldn’t place it. “Come in and make yourselves at home.”
Hermione grinned. “Excellent. We’ve got a hundred and twenty RSVP’d already. I negotiated the party tent vendor down to seventy Galleons per hour, so that saved us about two hundred Galleons. They’ll arrive at three that afternoon and start setting up in the courtyard in front of Fortescue’s where the tables usually are in summer. I even got them to throw in the area-of-effect warming charms for all the tents.”
“Lucky for those of you in the back who forgot the assignment then, eh?” said Orkney. “You can leave your articles on my desk or bring them in with you on Wednesday, with your essay.”
. The event that ruined everything, including and especially Harry himself. He missed the cavilling, the ease that came with their banter. He missed the way he was almost certain Draco’s body was reacting as Harry’s own was, tingly and unbearably
they finished, and coming up with a solution for it. He knew better than that. Lucius and Narcissa had certainly taught him better.
In addition to the other complexes he had, like being unable to stop thinking about Malfoy even though
before I go under, and then when I move into visualisation, feel how it feels for me. But for Merlin’s sake, don’t run off because mine feels restless, too. You might take my mind with you.”
Not a single fourth year hesitated. They all stepped in front of their sponsors and knelt down. Alick swished his wand and a golden cup popped into being in the air. It looked uncomfortably like the horcrux. Harry tensed, but Eloise squeezed his hand and he felt okay again. The horcrux was gone; it would never return. This was a different cup.
He pulled away, lifting himself on his hands to take in Draco’s face. Draco looked back at him, and without a word, spread his hips even further, lifted them enticingly.
“Hermione tried to,” Potter insisted. “But she wasn’t confident in it, and she didn’t want to use it at all. She said it could be dangerous. And we’re not entirely sure Petunia’s thing was due to the spell because Dudley was fine. He’s worried she’s starting to lose her faculties a bit, but I don’t agree. I think it was the spell.”
Draco sighs heavily and then comes to sit down on the chair across from him. He props his elbows on his knees and stares at Harry. “What’s going on, Harry?”
On Saturday evening, just as the sun was beginning to set, they started for Hogsmeade, and their reservation at Lemur Wine, the new fusion restaurant in Hogsmeade. It was a very odd place to put a postmodern restaurant, but they had a free Floo valet, and people were coming in from all over, so it seemed to be doing well regardless. Their group turned out to be much bigger than expected – Anthony had had to write back twice to increase their reservation, and by the second time, they were up to twenty-seven and had to get two tables. Hufflepuffs rolled deep.
They were all three hesitating. Millicent had the alien under a Disillusionment, tied to her own body.
Seeing the smouldering, broken wooden beams, the crumbled stone and stucco facades, felt like a personal attack. This was Draco’s childhood. This was his fairytale. And they’d destroyed it. He sneered up at the sky, for all the good it would do them.
Malfoy shrugs off the jacket. Marietta swoops in to adjust the waistcoat, popping open the bottom two buttons so that his midriff shows when he moves. She tugs lightly on his trousers so that the top of a patch of white-gold hair peeks out.
“Having to refresh warming charms on a cloak that should have them built in is a waste of magical energy, and as a Hufflepuff, I resent the inefficiency.”
“I know,” Malfoy said. “I’ve been thinking about it for a few days. But the spell’s got another requirement to it—we need Muggles to trust us, or they won’t be able to be conduits. The magic will skip right over them.”
Draco stopped as he came around the couch, and catalogued the scene with efficiency. His eyes lingered briefly on Harry’s bare chest.
Malfoy hands him the note. It does indeed say, ‘...assures me their the style...’. Harry scowls and tosses the note onto the floor. Fucking Hermione. Was it really necessary to take it that far? He only mixes up those words when he’s in a hurry. He
“For people like us, I know,” she said. “But this isn’t some book about your life, Harry. Other stories happen that we’re just players in. It’s okay.”
Draco slowly unscrewed this lid, dipped his fingers in. He spread his legs further still, ran his hand down his body and below his bollocks. Harry watched in awe, equal parts turned on and watchful. It’d been so long since he’d done anything like this, a reminder wouldn’t go amiss.
“The feel of my body overwhelms him and he can’t stay away from my mouth, can’t stop fitting his to mine, couldn’t stop kissing me even if the window were to crack and all the water came rushing in. He falls to his elbows and slides his fingers into my hair.
Malfoy’s smile is sudden and devastatingly real. The cloak drops to the floor and he falls forward on the bed, hands braced on either side of Harry’s face. He dips his head and kisses Harry again, softly this time, lingeringly.
Nah, they wouldn’t let him come back; he’d have to get a job and a flat and do it without any Muggle skills or certifications or money.
He heard Draco sigh from somewhere above and to his right, and then he was moving in front of him, coming around to slide down the wall next to Harry. He rolled his head over to regard him, grey eyes deathly blue in the reflected light. “I’m afraid to ask,” he murmured. “I was sure you’d pass, but you look so angry that I’m beginning to worry.”
Harry, on the other hand, is very much moved by it. He grabs the front of Healer Gaelan’s robes, jerks him forward, and hisses, “You will begin the extraction
Harry wasn’t sure if he was grateful or angry that the solution had been so simple. Provided Harry made it out of this in relatively one piece, he and Dudley were really going to have to revamp the Muggle Immersion curriculum. And probably actually change the class name to Non-Magical Immersion, because Muggle really did sound rather derogatory.
The soft smile Professor Sprout gave the Hufflepuff table that night kept Harry warm all through the rest of January. Then in February, more news came out. Scientists wanted to study the children, but it turned out there really was safety in numbers. Their parents banded together and caused such an uproar in the media that no one could forget the Hampshire Hoverers, and they couldn’t be whisked away quite so quietly.
. How did Ginny even stay on a broom if women had to spend so much effort just staying upright? “I have a… a…”
Harry slashes his wand and a bright blue hex whips towards Ron, catching him on the shoulder. Ron grunts as his blood drips black down his bicep, but doesn’t slow. “Not enough,” Ron says, and knocks him back, his head ringing. “You got me where I needed to be for Hermione. I’ll get you there, too, mate. Stop—holding—back!” And then he swings out in an arch and a wall of flame soars right to Harry; he slides to the side but not quick enough.
Because he had weak points. Points that could be pressed and manipulated. And those points were the people he loved. Harry wouldn’t let their lives get ruined because he was being blackmailed. He would suck it up and do it, complaining the whole time.
Harry gasped, feeling water slosh through his lungs; fuck he loved water. It was so erotic, so sensual. It reminded him of fucking Draco in his apprentice rooms at Hogwarts. Draco’s hands came around Harry’s waist and he pulled their floating bodies together, pressing his erection against Harry’s bum.
She narrowed her eyes, but did resume her seat in the tartan armchair. The tartan armchair that most certainly had once been Harry’s favourite stool. “I’m always available to students, Potter. It is my job as Headmistress.”
Another customer came in, and he turned to help him. Harry moved his chair around to face Millicent and Malfoy.
There’d been another Obliviation – an Obliviator who’d decided to protest, make a statement. He’d Obliviated a family of four who happened upon some flickering wards near the Blarney Stone in Ireland and the MUS had had him arrested for it. Currently, he was awaiting trial before the UMN.
Harry nodded quickly. That he could do. Another tug came at his core and he could feel himself starting to unravel like a ball of yarn around a cat.
“There’s tonnes of tribes,” Harry said. “We’ll have to go all over the sodding country, which is probably as big as Russia, to meet with them all.”
Malfoy starts making breathy little whines and his thighs are trembling beneath the silk. He’s close. Very close. And Merlin, how is Harry ever going to dress the bloody ponce again after this?
They shut the door after them, and Harry busied himself with a few small tasks—he hid the chocolate, damped the fire, and drained the last of his brandy.
that, Harry?” Demelza asks, all the dark humour now missing from her voice. She leans forward, bracing her elbows on her knees and looking up at him through heavy lashes. “You could’ve been killed.”
McGonagall pursed her lips. “I’d not forgotten Ms Bones. Thank you. Remember that you will be competing with the entirety of the seventh year class for positions. As your circumstances are somewhat different from other students, we’ve decided that in addition to NEWTs studies, extra help would not go amiss.”
“What is that?! What is that?!” she kept yelling, her finger waving towards the unconscious being on her floor.
Harry feels a little swept away for a moment. This has to be the nicest request for friendship he’s ever received; actually it’s the
Harry climbed out of the trunk into his bedroom at the Airbnb and changed into some fresh clothes, brushed his teeth, and was about to go downstairs when he heard voices. Voices that belonged to people other than Hermione and Lee. Malfoy and the others were already there.
“No!” Draco says, slamming his fist on the coffee table. The bag of takeaway shakes from the force. “It wasn’t fake but it doesn’t
“Any high-level charm not taught as part of the standard Hogwarts curricula will be considered for extra points.”
And he kind of liked this place. It was lively and strange. People liked him as soon as he opened his mouth with a non-rhotic R. Mrs Black also seemed keen to stay near the portrait of Hugo Black, though for the life of him, Harry could not understand why.
Harry’s stomach flipped. Before he could say anything else, Malfoy continued: “I was reading about magical tethers. Pansy says the Ravenclaws have determined the most likely construction of the ritual diagram the druids used when they first chained magic to the land. Granger said–”
Harry did not beam at him because that would be overstepping. Instead he said, “Brill. See you then, mate.”
“That you’re wasting your time,” Snape replied, just as bored. “Potter—do remember to have that essay to me by tomorrow night. That is, if you plan on passing your first term.”
Malfoy’s breathing was evening out. He sat very straight, but still managed to look lax and carefree in a way that would’ve made Harry just look slumpy if he’d tried to imitate it. The steam from Harry’s water-filled cauldron was curling the tips of his hair again. That day in Slughorn’s class felt like it’d happened years ago, or maybe seconds ago.
“The sea isn’t ours,” he said. “It doesn’t belong to land-humans. It belongs to the Mers, and the fish, and the oysters, and the seahorses, squids, sharks, and lobsters that live there. We have no right to fuck it up, and I won’t let anyone—Muggle or Magical—reverse the work we’ve done to clean up their environment. The Mers’ environment is still shit, with all the rubbish floating in their favourite spots, but the deep waters are cleaning up, even way at the bottom. And our oysters will help, too.
“Oh, good. I’d worried you might decide to have it completely silent since you’ve ignored all my memos on the subject. At this late stage, we’ll have to pay a premium if you want a band,” Luna says. She’s eyeing the ceiling again, and Harry really hopes she’s not looking for a way to squeeze in an extra potion diffuser.
“Healer Thomas says you’re staying the night for observation, so get comfy.” Demelza pauses again, making a show of collecting up his AIR, seemingly uninterested in saying whatever else was on her mind. Gryffindor, though, so she huffs and finally adds: “Dawlish said to tell you he’ll be by at five. I’ll see you, Harry. I’m going home.”
Harry shook his head, still chuckling. “You’re just such an arsehole, Malfoy. It’s hilarious. When it’s not directed at me or my friends, anyway.”
Draco shrugged, wobbling Harry’s head in the process. “The flood,” he said, finally. “When everything changes, and we have a chance to build something new.”
Harry perked up, and it annoyed him that he did so. Malfoy swanned through Hogwarts as if his entire family hadn’t just been on the losing side of a war, while Harry spent half his waking moments, and a full third of his sleeping ones, wondering just what the fuck he was doing with his life. “Why are you so
“It’s all about opposites, Professor,” said Harry. “They create the Azoth. Every Alchemy needs an Azoth.”
Harry looked away, down. There was a long crack in the marble floor by the sink. “It was a greyhound.”
Harry stared. “But surely we can just teach him what seven means again. Just like we did a few years ago when we were teaching him numbers the first time.”
Scorpius attempted to sneak into Albus’s room, but Malfoy watched him narrow-eyed the whole time. His backside was covered in mud.
“I was thinking about this book I read on legendary potions that summer. There was once a time when the word
Millicent strapped the alien into the single bunk by itself on the other side of the tent, and Harry and Malfoy added a dozen more warding,
Harry rolled his eyes. Fucking wanker. They couldn’t even have a bit of British small talk without Malfoy saying things that were not exactly insults, but because they came from Malfoy, were insults.
And then the world closes in. Truth, reality, and every potential thread of fate fall together. What does it matter if it’s real?
Harry managed to get his cup in the right spot after a terrifying moment of coffee pouring onto the countertops—there were no tea pods—and joined Hermione with a half cup of coffee as black and tarry as Voldemort’s soul. Just how he liked it, if he couldn’t have tea.
Draco’s face takes on a dark expression, but he doesn’t say what he’s thinking. Harry doesn’t have to ask. He’s already heard the sad and stomach-turning story of Granny Black. The whole damned family was doomed; Sirius never had a chance.
This seems to amuse Malfoy, but all he says is, “Veelas require lots of sex and entire wardrobes designed just for them.”
The murmuring of welcoming and reconnecting voices was a low, poignant hum bouncing against the walls of the den. It was warm and soft and it seemed to Harry that all their voices speaking at once created an odd, uplifting sort of harmony. It felt like there was magic in it, like it was changing something in the world.
Rolling his eyes, Harry finished off his punch. He moved to get another glass, but Malfoy stopped him with a hand on his forearm. “Care for a real drink?” He waved a silver flask at Harry. It gleamed in the candlelight and made Harry think of the mercurial silver of a decent Cold Cure Potion.
,” Harry burst out. “And I want you to want me in return...either because I turn you on, or because I...turn your
Determinedly, he pulled his eyes back up to Draco’s face. One would think they would have realised they could turn their faces enough to lay their chins on one another’s shoulders instead of staring right at one another, but Draco hadn’t, and Harry wasn’t stupid enough to give up this position, so he didn’t.
Ron exhaled in a rush, slipped the box back in his jeans pocket. “Good. Okay. Brilliant. I—I just wanted to make sure. I felt like I couldn’t do it, until you gave me an idiot check. I trust your opinion, you know? Even if you’re rubbish at women.”
“Are you any good at Transfigurations?” Malfoy asked. He sipped his water again, as if this was the dullest thing that’d ever happened to him.
Harry and Malfoy gave one another bewildered looks. Harry shrugged. He had a feeling he was missing out on some grand joke, but whatever would convince them.
Hermione’s offered to remove them a dozen times but Marietta's learned that she can Charm them to say something different—even if she can’t Charm them away entirely—and she really doesn’t like to admit to Hermione that she can’t figure it out.
“You owe me so much, Harry Potter,” she bit out, but before he could say, ‘Don’t I fucking know it,’ she twisted on the crate and pulled them up to Annapolis.
Potions Master in Britain, I was perfectly suited to deal with a situation involving water and Merpeople, both of which are, on occasion, used in potions.”
Draco nodded. “Yes, but they’re being quite difficult,” he said. “They’re willing to speak to their state congress people, apparently friends of theirs, but only on the condition that we invite them to the family holiday party this Yule – and their three daughters’ families as well.”
Harry attempts to think of something he would’ve normally said in this situation if he didn’t have a stomach virus. “Give it time,” he decides on. “Malfoy has yet to let us down with being a dick.”
Potter glanced at him, grimacing. “She knows the stakes.” He tilted his head, his hands working at the buttons on his jeans. “But I’m still hopeful. Ready?”
the Obliviation, Professor Potter,” Gemma said. He could hear unvoiced the ‘duh’ underneath. “But the Obliviation could’ve jostled something in their brains and woken them up, as I said.”
Hermione was standing, leant over her seat-back and glaring at all of them. “We’ve tested this spell to the greatest extent possible, but in
“Potter,” Millicent said, flatly. “We need to talk to the Headmistress, tell her we’re going on the run so she can take care of our students and classes, and then get the fuck out of here. Stop asking stupid questions and
;’ and in his check-in meeting with McGonagall regarding the state of his career aspirations, she said,
Harry perked up. “Oh, maybe I can give him the one she gave me. Two is always better than one, right? I was going to chuck it in the fire, but I always felt guilty every time I was about to do it.”
“So pleased to be working with you, Harry!” Dennis said. “Luna’s a great producer. We’re going to have so much fun!”
Draco chanced a glance at Potter; his mouth was gaping open, his full lips a picture of astonishment. Draco, for once, could not blame him. He was maintaining an even expression through Narcissa’s hard-learned lessons alone. In his chest, his heart stuttered over a handful of beats before finding its rhythm again; the sensation was uncomfortable and worrying.
Harry sat on the sofa and Malfoy took the seat next to him, leaving Millicent to prowl agitatedly around the room with the invisible alien propped up against the fireplace.
Harry waved his hand at him, though it came out more like flopping. “You can see New York anytime. I want to see you now.”
“Great,” said Millicent, shoving another chip in her mouth. It took Harry a moment to realise this was the first time he’d seen her eat carbs in years. “What’s the spell you keep talking about, then?”
Draco closed his eyes and hoped he would be able to sleep soon. This day was crazy enough as it was. Seeing his mother, being in the dining room again, walking around in the burning sun, seeing Potter, calling a truce. A
"Right, yes." Nott said and pointed at a black wooden door at the end of the small beige corridor, "Draco's room is over there."
Their lips met with bruising force, Harry's tongue slipping through Draco's lips, as they brought themselves as close as possible, their chests' pushing against each other, hands roaming each other's bodies.
"Let's go back to Draco's room and I'll see if they're still arguing.", she said and closed the album.
The evening went on and on. Harry had decided he couldn't sit around and sulk all day. He was stronger than this, after all, and this was neither the time nor the place to be sulky. Before dinnertime, Harry and Ron went upstairs to Ron's old room that the Weasley's have kept exactly as it had always been and it made Harry - and Ron as well - feel very at home. He smiled as he flunked himself on the bed he was going to sleep in that night, and Ron sat down on his own.
Draco didn't feel much like eating, not to mention being around people. He could already imagine the look on the Gryffindors faces when they would see him. So Draco sat back down on the floor and leaned against his bed. What was he supposed to do now?
They opened presents - Harry and Ron only got small ones, but they were just as thankful. Mr Granger anticipated playing Wizards Chess, but he wasn't very enthusiastic about the whole concept - just like his daughter. Harry didn't want to think he was bored. He loved the Granges and he knew he should be happy for Hermione and Ron, but barely anyone talked to him that evening.
Mr Weasley laughed. "That's how she is. Well, say Ron hello from me and tell him his mother wants him to answer to her letter."
When the singing ended and everyone laughed and clapped again, Harry wanted to get off the stage as quickly as possible, but Hermione grabbed his arm.
During dinner, Malfoy wanted to 100% confuse Harry and trick him with these smouldering eyes, so he would come to the lake. But it was not going to work.
Secretly, he had already been planning on going to buy clothes and he knew exactly who to take with him: Seamus Finnegan - a fellow gay person and a stylish one at that. Harry knew the perfect Muggle places to go to when you needed to buy something classy.
"Of course. But taking the shower after I came up too, would be even cleverer.", he answered smirking and winked. Draco smirked too.
He wrapped ine arm around Potter's waist and pulled him closer. Draco pulled him down to lie next to him before he covered them both with the blanket. Potter didn't resist in the slightest, just stared at Draco with a silly, bemused expression.
"There are so many things I would like to tell that abnormally disgusting little rat!" Ron almost shouted.
He stepped into the shower behind Draco and put his arms around Draco's waist. His back was pressed against Harry's stomach and he missed Draco's neck.
Harry was a bit startled. He didn't expect that he should go in and search for clothes. And quite frankly he'd rather have Nott do that, because if Harry went in without Malfoy's permission he could get into a lot of trouble.
"This is a nightmare, Hermione!" Harry said after the feast, "I can't live with him. Not for a minute and especially not for a whole year!"
Minerva gasped shocked at first, but then she smiled and tilted her head. Potter lay in his hospital bed, dressed in a white gown. By his side was Draco Malfoy, his arm around Potter's waist. Minerva had known it, she had known this was going to happen. The two boys were sleeping, so Minerva pulled the curtain close again.
When Draco thought he had everything, he remembered the box. He shoved aside the remaining underwear, lifted the double floor and pulled out the black box. Draco opened it, just to check. Everything was there. He smiled and closed his closet. In that moment, someone knocked on the door.
Neville was shocked. He gasped and clapped his hands. Harry felt his cheeks redden. He was really happy he had someone to talk to about this, someone who wasn't going to tell anyone and especially someone who was this excited to hear about it.
Something was wrong. If it was the kiss or that Harry realized he might be falling for Malfoy. Maybe not exactly
Since they had said that, Draco sat on the floor in their - his- room and cried. Some time around dinner he had stopped crying and went over to punching the wall with his fists. When they had started bleeding and he had suspected the bones to be broken, he had cried a little more.
"Oh, I'm sorry, Draco. Today is the last day I'll see them. We can spend the whole holidays together.", he said and walked closer to Draco, but Draco took a step back.
"What?", Potter asked. Draco didn't answer. He stared at his knees until Potter lifted his chin so Draco looked at him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and decided they should eat. He had brought fruit and vegetables and a single piece of bread for Harry. Harry missed the good food - pudding and chicken and everything not vegetable-y. But doing Malfoy - and perhaps himself - a favor, Harry ate the carrots and apples and everything else. He couldn't get the enchanted bedside table out of his mind. What was Malfoy hiding? And why didn't he just put it where the box was and Harry could never find it? Harry thought about asking Malfoy about the box, but he decided it would only annoy Malfoy.
"Hermione, it was really sweet at the beginning but now you're starting to annoy me. Stop being worried about me so damn much, I can handle myself. In case you didn't notice, no one wants me dead anymore. So I'm fine," Harry said and noticed how his voice was getting loud, leaving the others just as shocked.
Draco nodded. Harry kissed him on the forehead and his hand twitched. He wanted to touch the Dark Mark, he wanted to know what it felt like. But Harry wasn't sure if he could, if Draco would want him to. Harry thought the issue was less that Harry saw the Mark rather than Draco himself seeing it and being reminded of it. Before Harry could voice his concerns, Draco lifted his hand from Harry's chest, grabbed Harry's wrist and put his hand on the Dark Mark. This was such a huge step and Harry almost couldn't believe it. He slowly and carefully traced his finger over the faded snake and felt that there was nothing there - no burn in his scar, no tingling sensation under his fingertips, no anger. All Harry felt was Draco.
Draco grinned as good as he could and they went downstairs. His mother had made lunch for them and Draco was pleased to have something in his stomach again, the day before he hadn't eaten anything at all.
Draco got dressed and checked his watch again. He nodded to himself and took a deep breath. He was ready. Theo even gave him a hug before he left.
"Cookies! I'm so hungry! Can I have one?", he asked and Neville nodded in reply. Hermione shook her head laughing.
Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed. They lay beneath the covers, facing each other, their noses almost touching.
The day, though lazy as it was, rushed past the three friends like a lighting. In the evening, they watched TV for a long time, and were flicking through the channels. As Hermione fell asleep, Harry suggested they should all go to bed and Ron agreed. He woke Hermione softly and wished Harry a good night. Harry smiled and slumped upstairs tiredly.
He rolled his eyes and tried to make them clear that he didn't want to talk to them, but they stopped him anyways.
"I caught them kissing when I got back to get my book.", Ron told Hermione, who clapped her hands on her cheeks.
It was time for Harry and Draco to exchange their vows. Harry was so nervous his hands were trembling and all he could hear was his heart hammering against his ribcage. He took Draco's free hand and smiled.
"I know mother has gone crazy in the war and I can't understand how she thought being in contact with Potter was acceptable. I would never disgrace you or our family. When the Daily Prophet reaches out to me, I will tell them the whole truth: how I hate Potter as much as ever and I don't want anything to do with him if I don't have to. But maybe I might find out something valuable you would want to know."
of all people was the one making Harry hard. And Harry was the one making Malfoy hard. What a twisted world. Harry guessed this would be another thing Malfoy could do when he was sad - kiss him.
They lay in bed, it was late at night. Draco was more satisfied with himself than he had been in a long time.
He took in every single thing of the boy - more man than boy now - he hasn't seen in so long. Draco registered Potter's glasses - the same glasses he'd had for eight years - and how tanned his skin was, he must have been outside a lot lately. Draco couldn't spend too much time in the sun because, even with a spell, his skin was easily getting sunburned. When Potter smiled, his white teeth were flashing at Draco, and his eyes seemed even greener.
But could you blame Draco for not being able to sleep? His mother was two floors beneath him, probably being checked through by healers every fre minutes to see if she was still alive. Of course she was still alive, otherwise someone would have filled Draco in already.
Neville and Ron looked at each other and then decided it would be better to follow him before he would hurt himself. So they followed Malfoy, who leaned with one shoulder against the wall while he walked so he wouldn't fall.
"I don't think you understand what a very highly regarded family we are in our circles, and I will not accept you or your mother to bring such shame on us. I wish to hear from you soon, otherwise I would have to break out of here. Don't you dare not answer me!
Harry felt happy when he saw Ron smiling at that. The pub was pretty crowded. Harry immediately got recognized and the man on the stage announced that Harry Potter had just entered the party. Harry felt Hermione grabbing his hand as everyone turned to look at them. Being the hero on every party wasn't as much fun as everyone thought it might be.
Harry walked with Teddy on his arm and Malfoy by his side back into the house and introduced the two.
Draco grinned. Harry was one slimy git. But it worked. Draco saw his mother blushing slightly and the corner of her lips twitched.
"Really brave for a little girl that is sitting in a wagon full of Slytherins." Draco went on and the Slytherins laughed evil.
"Dad says it was a hell of a mess." Ron said, "Lucius would have gotten twenty years at Azkaban, but apparently his heart suddenly stopped beating."
Draco thought this was the most awkward situation he had ever been in. These idiots. He stopped in the common room and asked himself if he wanted to do his homework here. But when other students or Potter would come as well, Draco's perfectly silent study atmosphere would be disturbed. So Draco left the common room, walked down to the main building and upstairs into the library. He sat down at a quiet table and spread out his books and paper.
As much as Draco would have loved to annoy Potter with what he'd just said, he was more interested in why Potter was worried about him. Potter cleared his throat.
Draco watched Potter sipping at his Butterbeer. Potter seemed lost, he kept looking around all the time and was unfocused. Draco got the feeling Potter wasn't enjoying being here with him and would rather do something with Weasel and Granger.
"Yeah. Some minutes later, we entered the Entrance Hall and I suspect you remember the rest." Potter nodded smiling and kissed Draco.
"Harry, I... sorry. I didn't know. I just thought... Who else then?", Hermione asked more carefully. Harry sighed.
Theo suddenly appeared by Draco's side and pushed him hard in the back. "Go!" He said into Draco's ear, "Get him!"
Harry smiled and snuggled against Malfoy's chest. Harry heard Malfoy's heart beating, a very comforting sound mixed with the sound of Malfoy's slow breathing.
"Thanks for helping me with him." Harry said when he made dinner and Ron cuddled with the red-haired boy on the couch.
"Oh, yes. Good idea to use the war and you being the glorious hero as an excuse for what you had just said. Brilliant, Harry. Truly brilliant.", she said, her eyes still narrowed.
When they finished dinner, the friends left the Great Hall. On their way through the giant doors, Malfoy came over to them and walked with the group.
Potter could do amazing things with his tongue: he could not only melt Draco's bones with it, but also make little pulses of pleasure spread from his lips directly toward his quickly hardening cock.
At night, he couldn't get the question out of his head. Why wasn't Draco Malfoy in Azkaban? He had been a Death Eater, Harry had seen his mark. Maybe because he had still been underage? Who knew.
Mrs Weasley wasn't impressed by the suggestion, but her children were. They made teams over the pudding and after dinner, they all ran outside to get their brooms.
Potter kicked them all the way off under the bedclothes, not wanting anything to get between him and Draco, who sighed at the feel of Potter's skin against his.
"I'm not one of those who can easily hide." Luna and Neville sang as they stepped out from behind the same tent.
"Hey. Just for one minute forget about your father," Harry said softly and he really hoped Malfoy could.
Harry searched with his fingers for his glasses on the bedside table. When he had finally found them, he put them on and everything came back to view. Everything, including a blonde head next to him. Harry crawled as quick as he could to the end of his bed, the person next to him woke up, they looked at each other and started screaming. Malfoy jumped up from the bed, so did Harry. Neither of them stopped screaming.
Draco felt tears shooting up in his eyes. What was going on? Why was he such a crybaby? Potter noticed and lifted his shirt, revealing his muscular body and another big scar on his stomach.
"I know a potion that will solve your problem. If you're not too proud to let me help you, then I'll do it.", Harry suggested.
Before the feast began, Headmistress McGonagall got up to say a few words, as unusual to Ron's disappointment because he was starving.
"I thought I was going to fail Potions," Draco told Potter and after he had said it he didn't know why he had told Potter.
"We have to collect little pieces so we can add them all together and have a clear picture of the night before because this-", Harry pointed at the dark bruise on his neck, "-and this-", he held up Malfoy's pale wrist, "-don't come from nothing."
Draco looked at him, then at his hands, which were laying on his chest. Draco felt Potter's palms getting warm and he felt his magic flooding through him. He eyed the other boy carefully. Potter bit his lip concentrated. Draco smiled.
"During the holidays he is going to be with me but while I'm at Hogwarts he will stay at the Burrow."
"I'm fine, I'm fine," Harry said, "Don't you turn into Hermione." Malfoy snorted and shook his head.
"He's my son! He's my son!", he repeated ruefully and hammered against the wall. Harry cleared his throat and the man stopped moving.
"Draco." He said quietly and rolled to the side so they could look at each other. "You know we need to talk about this someday."
Several people backed away from the scene, watching from a safe distance. Harry's face reddened with anger. He wouldn't let anyone talk to him or Draco like that.
their Golden Boy and if they try to ruin his happiness, they are the bad guys." Hermione said with a shrug.
"Mate, I know you don't like Malfoy, but that look... you're not going to kill him, are you?", Ron asked.
Harry lay his arm around Draco's shoulder. Draco looked at Harry for a second and then he lay his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry smiled happily and hummed a slow song. Draco looked up.
Good that Potter was left-handed and Draco right-handed, so they could hold hands while they were eating and no one noticed.
When he finished, Draco threw his clothes into the self-emptying bin and left the bathroom with his wand in his hand. He hurried to his room where he put on some fresh clothes and then went onto the balcony.
Harry knew exactly that Malfoy thought these sweaters were ugly and he hated it when Harry wore them, but Harry appreciated the lie. When Ron opened his present from Hermione, he almost broke into tears, what was very uncommon for him. He hugged her and plastered kisses all over her face. Hermione grinned and shoved him away. Draco and Harry have decided beforehand not to buy each other things, but neither of them held their promise.
"I mean, apart from this.", said Malfoy and pointed with his finger between himself and Harry, "I mean with all the Tournament stuff and else."
Malfoy nodded and sipped at his tea before he got up too. He followed Harry wordlessly to the staircase to the roof. Harry peeked upstairs and as he was assured that the rain had stopped, he climbed the steps, Malfoy following.
Harry remembered this as well and added: "I had a Tequila and at first I didn't know what to say to you. I thought maybe you'd leave as soon as you spotted me. But you didn't."
Carefully, Harry adjusted Draco in his lap, so their groins rubbed together perfectly, their chests and stomach pressed together.
“My mother was one of the first to show it,” Sostrate said. “They killed her for it, thinking it some defect in her blood. My father, the King, hid me in the caves below the island before they could learn of my own magic, while he negotiated with the Creators—that he would personally execute any non-standard humans in his kingdom, so long as they let him carry out the law himself, as King.
Draco shrugged, and turned his gaze to the agenda McGonagall was passing out. Across the room, Neville, Luna, and Hermione were all bunched up on a cosy-looking couch, with Millicent skulking about by the fire. He was really here, wasn’t he?
“Wanted to see the world,” he said. But then he smiled at Harry and Harry knew there was something else to it. He blinked, watching Malfoy closely. He didn’t laugh at Hermione’s bug even once.
“After Mr Potter is sorted, he will join his new house for the remainder of dinner. We will thence go in alphabetical order until each and every seventh and eighth year student has been re-sorted.”
“I need to know for educational reasons,” Hermione protested. “Ron and I still have to manage to get Rosie to seventeen alive, after all. And somehow we’ve got to cooperate on that.”
“Oh, shut the fuck up, Malfoy,” Harry said softly. He smiled, to show he didn’t mean it. And that he desperately wanted this conversation to be over. “Look—just don’t worry about this. Let’s go back and do something productive with the rest of the night. I found a manuscript on early Alchemy that I think you’ll be interested in. It suppositions that transfigurations was the final step in creating a stone.”
Down in the common room, the lights were, for once, all turned down so low that Harry could barely make out the faces of the students already waiting. He could tell right away that the third years and younger had been sent to bed. The fifth and sixth year prefects held lanterns that jostled light gently around the room and their faces as they moved. As the eighth year boys reached the group of assembled Hufflepuffs, the barrel door opened and Justin Finch-Fletchley and Wayne Hopkins, the only two Hufflepuff eighth years now in Ravenclaw, streamed in, each with their own lantern and their cloaks trailing after them. Behind them came three more seventh year former Hufflepuffs in Slytherin robes and two in Gryffindor ones.
pose. She shook her head a fraction. “I don’t know, Harry. Do you think you had a proper chance to learn to love different aspects of magic? You’ve always had to judge magic on how valuable it could be to you in a fight, not how much you liked doing it. But there’s so much more to magic than Defence. So many more amazing, transcending aspects to it…things you’d never get a chance to study without devoting years of your life to them. And you didn’t have that chance. You could only learn what you needed to learn. I don’t know what you might’ve liked if you’d had the chance. I don’t think you know, either.”
“Oh, that’s no problem,” Harry said. He hopped up. His spaghetti bowl disappeared, leaving Severia mid-lick against air. “Let’s go find him. He’s probably skulking near Hufflepuff. He likes to stalk the first years from frame to frame when they leave the Den after dinner for the library.”
Harry’s reached a steady place—a level sort of misery that gives him the gift of clear vision, of a detached sort of intellectual curiosity. He’s both outside his body watching, and inside feeling every sharp cut. As an Unspeakable, he’s interested. Had his mother felt anything like this as she made the decision to stay, to put her body before Harry’s?
know, Harry wonders. But Ron is probably more worried about the odds of it being untrue if Hermione believes it. “What?” says Hermione. “It’s obvious. It’s been obvious for years.”
“They’ve got one on every corner,” he said, gesturing to the three-tailed Starbucks. “Which one are we supposed to turn at again?”
Draco had received only five years of house arrest, given his youth. He’d fucked off for the next seven after realising that five years wasn’t long enough for the people of Britain to let him walk through Diagon Alley unmolested. Twelve had just about done it.
“White,” Dean says. “Tried black and grey but they were both shit. He’s thrilling in white, though. Like a fucking Veela.”
“It’s just, your marriage sounds like mine and Astoria’s. I needed an heir, she needed a quick escape from the terrible match her father was planning for her. We faked a love match to have Scorpius. After providing an heir, pure-blood witches can more easily divorce and choose their own partners.”
Draco had to admit that was true. And in all his readings on Atlantis, both as a child and an adult, he’d never made a connection between the ‘font of power’ that kept Atlantis going and had contributed so much to its success—and this actual water fountain—or river, rather.
talk about last night. We will go back to how things were last week, when neither of us had taken leave of our senses.”
“It’s a different sort of decaying,” Harry said. “There’s different types of radioactive decay, but you could think of that kind like this—suppose you had a pureblood family—an element. It’s a pretty stable family. Christmas dinners with relatively no fighting, everyone’s got little heirs, no one’s causing a scandal. But then, one of the heirs, a proton, goes off and marries a muggleborn, and the heir is disinherited. The pureblood family tries to be a new element, an element that never needed that heir, but it did have that heir once, and it knows that someone’s missing.
Malfoy shrugged. “We only use glass goblets for guests at home, or copper if the occasion calls for it. Much more polite than silver or gold, which can hide a number of nasty things.”
And Padma was friends with Francine Fortescue, so there would likely be even more press after this. Everything had to go perfectly. Hermione was feeling much the same, if her franticly wide eyes were anything to go by.
“Am I not…?” Malfoy trailed off, uncertainly. It was the first time Harry’d ever seen him look as though his self-esteem wasn’t a hundred and ten per cent.
It doesn’t matter how many lighting effects there are. It doesn’t matter if they’re electric- or spell-made. Nor how elaborate his show set design is or how fit the other models are or how many Thestrals are flying around; Harry always knows where Draco Malfoy’s going to be. It’s like a seventh sense (the sixth being how to avoid dying), or maybe it used to be, during those ageless, innocent years when Harry thought he was just pining and not overwhelmed by magic. He gets a feeling whenever he’s about to walk through a door and Malfoy’s on the other side. He just
If Hermione were alive, she would have something to say about it. She always did when she was. Harry is one-hundred-and-eighteen years old now and while he’s in good shape and health for a wizard his age, his heart feels old. He thinks maybe he’d still have a good thirty years ahead of him if he’d had Draco around but he hopes that he doesn’t.
“I need a scotch,” McGonagall said, sitting quickly at Yaxley’s Corbeille. “Poppy, will he be alright?”
in her mouth and a hard look in Harry’s direction. Much like her original namesake (Harry’d named her Ms Granger when he found her in Knockturn Alley on top of a ruined copy of
“Oh yes,” said Professor Sprout, eyes twinkling. “We had the most outstanding thunderstorm last night. I’ve never seen anything of the like."
They still hadn’t decided who would be the one to offer his life, but Draco already knew the answer. He couldn’t let Potter die. And Potter would make sure Scorpius was loved and taken care of. He would understand how important that was. It would have to be Draco.
Harry begins to rise from the couch. The Floo flares again. Another man steps out after him and immediately presses his chest against Draco’s back. Draco lets his head fall back onto the man’s shoulder and Harry feels the distinct urge to vomit. Oh god, what has he walked into? Harry stands there, frozen, unable to look away, nowhere to go. He watches as Draco turns in the man’s arms, as his expression becomes intent as it always does on a hard case, as they—
McGonagall’s lips twitched. “Be that as it may, Malfoy, you must know that the transfiguration wouldn’t hold.” She passed the rock back to him. “I’m surprised it lasted as long as it did, to be frank. Notice the central segment of the cross-section; it’s reverting to mica again.”
Harry watched him look around the house. Only a year ago Malfoy would have despised everything in here, including the people. But now he looked genuinely happy. Mrs Weasley came back into the room with several floating cups of tea. They all thanked her and took each a cup. Harry really loved Christmas.
"Yes." Harry said and wiped the tears off his face, "Yes, I'm okay. You know, I thought I would have a normal year when the Triwizard Tournament came around. And as if it wasn't hard enough that I had to fight dragons and risk my life involuntary, everyone hated me and I saw him- I saw Voldemort coming back and-"
It was almost two in the morning and they were still sitting at their table in the pub and talked. Harry figured they had a lot of catching up to do for the last years hating each other.
"You know what, I wasn't sure if I should tell you, but now I don't care. I had horrible dreams about you for the last few weeks and I couldn't sleep thinking about you and Voldemort!"
"Just because I'm not saying anything doesn't mean I don't have anything to say. I can't really be rude right now so I just think my part and keep it to myself."
Ron and Hermione were amazing enough to have planned the whole day for Harry. After breakfast they played a few games of Wizards Chess - Harry won twice but he thought they just let him win. Afterwards - around noon - they disapparated to a restaurant on Diagon Alley where Neville and Luna were already waiting. To Harry's relief the restaurant was almost empty and Neville and Ron said they would make sure no one would bother Harry. The five of them sat down on a big round table. A nice witch came to take their orders.
