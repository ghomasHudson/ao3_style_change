Harry’s murmur of pleasure was drowned out by the thumping at the door. “Hurry up! I need to pee.”
“Pick Uncle Ron,” Albus pushed, “he’s the best after Charlie.” He was tucked tightly on the front of Charlie’s broom hovering a few feet in front of Scorpius.
Harry flushed,
Harry let the bedroom door close with the softest of clicks, he padded barefoot across the carpet lit by nothing but the soft glow of a single bedside lamp.
“What’s with that?” he nodded to the boys, “Aren’t they supposed to be at The Burrow.”
It was after eleven before Draco made it home, flooing into the downstairs fireplace to hopefully not wake the rest of the house. Harry was only just awake, somewhere between dozing and snoozing on the sofa, a blanket-wrapped bundle of kid across his lap, with only the fuzzy orange light from the street lamp outside creeping through the edge of the curtains to light the room.
“Aren’t we?” Harry cocked an infuriating eyebrow. “Draco!” he shouted, “I can’t believe you’ve never seen a microwave.”
Draco stretched out on the blanket and chewed on an apple slice, “This is nothing like the first time you brought me here. Second date, remember?”
“Usemywords,” Albus said, in a rush.
“But they're grown-ups, mum can't give them into trouble.”
“Bad habit,” Harry corrected. “Now get going or you’re gonna be late.” Draco dropped a kiss on the crown of Lily’s head as he headed for the door. “Six,” Harry reminded him.
“He needs to hear–”
“It’s a hand job, a blowie if you’re lucky, you don’t need to be picky.”
The memory flashed away to be replaced with Harry bent over the kitchen table, the morning after their third date, coffee brewing on the stovetop and toast getting cold on the table, screaming Draco’s name for the first time.
“I'm hungry.”
“Sorry,” Draco murmured, “habit.”
“Just don't. Don't say anything.” Harry says with a sigh, taking a seat in the slightly too long grass behind the broom sheds. “You wouldn't anyway, you barely say anything these days.” He pulls out a packet of Benson and Hedges and holds one between his lips as he tips the green bic lighter from the packet. He offers the packet to Malfoy, more out of politeness than anything else, but isn't that surprised when he takes one. He drops the packet on the grass between them and fiddles with the lighter. It's more surprising that Malfoy produces his own lighter from somewhere in his robes, Harry thinks. He catches the tail end of a smile as Malfoy turns away cupping the end of his fag waiting for the flame to catch.
“And how will you stop it happening again?”
Harry lets out a low chuckle, then takes a drag from his fag. Tipping his head back to the sky he blows a stream of smoke from his nostrils. “Not just that. Sometimes I have a wank too if it’s a particularly nice day.”
Arthur looked between Hugo asleep on his shoulder and the shed door, torn. Hugo won out – the grandkids always did. “On you go Harry, you can give him the tour.”
“It’s Scorp,” Draco countered, sitting up to get out of bed himself.
Yves hadn’t even had time to let the door shut following Draco’s exit before Potter was on his tail. As he strode down the street, Potter fell in step beside him, “Never really been one for euphemisms,” Potter said. Draco didn’t acknowledge him, but Potter continued regardless, “So when someone says they want to ‘do it again sometime,’ I kinda want to take them up on it. Especially when that someone is someone I’m actually growing to like, dramatic exits aside. So how about it? Brunch? Drinks? Both and then back to mine for a fuck?” Potter bashed Draco with his shoulder, “What’d you say? How’s that sound?”
“Reservation? You really are spoiling us.”
Harry tucked the bunch of tulips under his arm as he juggled the wine, take-away, and his front door key. “Draco?”
“Good?”
Malfoy snorts lightly, “Hardly, they’ve got me on Bruise Removal paste.”
“You’re on.”
“Hear what?” Draco said, slipping his dark teal blazer over his shoulders.
Lily’s grabby hands reached for Draco’s apple slice, he distracted her with a strawberry which she squished till the juice ran through her fingers, “I did, so help me Salazar.”
“Nah,” Harry shook his head, “not sure why you punished Scorpius though?”
“Doing what?”
“They probably won’t notice-” Draco whipped round to face Harry, “Potter! We’re at your ex-in-laws, we’re not sneaking away,” he hissed.
The boys ran out of the room as Harry flopped down on the sofa next to Draco. “Sorry.”
He shook his head.
“See,” Pansy said smugly, “a friend from work. Shame the same can’t be said about you two.”
Draco emptied his Bloody Mary, “Perfectly adequate,” he conceded.
Draco narrated over images of their date.
“Nu uh,” James shook his head, himself sitting in front of Bill, “you can pick anyone.”
“You’re right,” he agreed, “but don’t let that stop you.” He took Harry’s wrist and pulled his hand lower, gasping as Harry moved his kisses up his neck and along his jawline.
“Uh huh, Potter,” Draco dropped a kiss on his forehead as he reached across the bath for the shampoo bottle. He poured a dollop of the lemon-scented shampoo into his palm and began to lather it into Harry’s hair.
“Scorpius going too?”
“He hadn’t even finished his first glass of wine before I sucked him off in the toilet. Perfectly able to consent, if that’s what you were worried about.”
He pointedly ignored the gesture and the questions, “If it’s not your current fuck-of-the-month, which particular gang of reprobates have you invited to ruin an otherwise perfectly civil brunch?”
“Exactly, no kids.”
“‘jamas,” Scorpius said quietly.
“Okay, off you go,” Harry said, pointing to the chest of drawers. As Scorpius crossed the room with the ball of light floating behind him, Harry stripped the bed with a couple of wand swipes and Accio-ed a dry set of linens from the airing cupboard. He’d magic-ed the sheets on and was plumping the pillows by hand when Scorpius came back in mismatched pyjamas: fire-breathing dragons chased their tails on his legs, and he wore one of James’ old Cannons’ t-shirts on top. “Good choice,” Harry complimented as he helped Scorpius into bed and tucked the duvet under his chin. “Now, how about a story?”
“Don’t
“So what if I don’t?” He picked up the menu and pretended to read, despite having ordered the same Eggs Benedict every single Sunday for the past three years.
The warning was sharp.
“You called her Hermione.”
“She said Sc’pus isn’t my real brother so he can’t stay at Grandma and Grandpa’s with us.”
Harry thought very hard about flicking the Vs.
“Too weird, right?”
Malfoy picks up the packet of fags and takes one for himself before tossing another to land in Harry’s lap. “Heard the weather forecast for tomorrow is just as good.”
“Where did you get to last night?” Pansy asked, eyes sharp over her Bellini, “Or perhaps the more prudent question is who did you get to last night?”
Albus was still asleep when they got back to the boys' shared bedroom. The two of them had lasted less than a week in their own rooms; after finding the pair of them asleep in the same room four mornings in a row, their dads relented and moved them both into what had been Albus’ room. Instead of the harsh electric light overhead, Harry conjured a small golden nightlight that floated by Scorpius’ head. “Do you want to help with changing the sheets or go get some clean pyjamas?”
“Yes.”
Harry shuffled her around until she was sitting more comfortably in his lap, “You still stayed, though.”
“And what are you going to do to make it better?” Harry prompted.
Blind hope was no use; Draco dropped his head back onto the pillow as Harry disentangled himself and got out of bed.
Draco smirks, “Your loss,” he spreads his legs showing the bulge in his crotch.
“Pick Ron,” James urged, “Hurry up! I wanna play!” The grass grew a little faster under the shadow of his broom, daisies blooming like bubbles popping on the top of a boiling cauldron.
“Well we can’t all be on call for our outstanding coordination of DMLE support, can we?” teased Harry.
Draco responds by silently running his knuckle up the length of his semi. He gives his cock a squeeze through his trousers and lets out a little gasp.
“Nu-uh, you're not allowed to jump on the bed cos you'll break your neck. Mum says so.”
“I am not, Potter. Now if you don’t mind I have work to do.”
“Don’t tell me you don’t remember, you absolute slag.”
Harry woke with a jolt as water splashed on his face; he’d fallen asleep in the bath. “Was only resting my eyes,” he claimed.
“No.” He snaps and pulls forward another rack of phials.
“Didn’t mean to,” James murmured.
“No need, we’re repaying the favour next Saturday. See how you feel about it after a night with seven of them. Now, get a move on or we’re gonna be late. Reservation’s for seven-thirty.”
“What’s got your knickers in a twist? Or were they not twisted enough? Was Mr Mysterious a little disappointing?” She waggled her pinkie suggestively. “Or did he do a runner before daybreak?”
It wasn’t Dragonpox, thankfully. First signs of accidental magic, unfortunate recipient of a weak attempt at a bat bogey hex, or just a very powerful sneeze; none of the healers at St Mungos’ could pinpoint the exact cause of the sparks but the one thing they were certain of – after every scan, test, and diagnostic spell possible – was that Lily didn’t have Dragonpox. She went home, cried out and clinging to Draco’s chest; Harry and Ginny by her side.
“No way, Draco, You were brilliant, truly. Couldn’t‘ve done it without you. So good.” Pink flashes up Draco’s neck and settles in full flush across his cheeks as he turns back to his workspace. “Are you embarrassed?”
“That's it. We're going out.” Ron accios his and Hermione's coats from the coat rack. The thump of the headboard against the wall coming from the floor above them gets faster, “I can’t listen to that for a minute longer.”
“‘s fine,” Harry said, pulling on his joggers, “I’ll get him.” Walking round the bed he stopped at Draco’s side and gave him a quick peck on the forehead. “We can finish this in the morning.”
Draco’s job would’ve had Lucius rolling in his grave, had he yet had one. Middle management in the public sector was no job for a Malfoy (but then again, neither was being shacked up with a man and five kids at age 30 – even if said man was the Saviour of the Wizarding World and only one of the kids came from a Malfoy's loins, thank you very much). The DMLE Support Coordinator handled all the administration that wasn’t important enough for the Aurors: filing, rostering Obliviators, knowing who was Muggle-savvy enough to come up with a Muggle-worthy excuse when that department were
“I know where the chocolate frogs are.”
“You do. You’re lying and doing a pretty piss-poor job of it while you're at it.”
Draco stretches his legs out, as he stubs his fag out on the ground, “Alright for some.”
Harry opened the door with a swing of his hip. “Hey love, I got wine and take-away from that Thai place you like and…” he trailed off when he saw the pair of four year olds standing in the corner. Draco sat primly on the sofa reading, “...and these.” He held out the crumpled tulips.
Della grabs the rest of hers, and then Ron and Della are cleaning together at the sink.

He grimaces again. “Uh,” he starts, flicks his eyes back through the rings again.
"Right," says Harry, eyebrows pushed under his fringe. "Ten years,
“Who’s your extra, Longbottom?” Draco asks, pouring coffee into mugs steadily.
Hermione’s still holding court in the living room, surrounded by her course mates and their own friends from Hogwarts. Without Harry noticing it’s as if all of the most important people have gravitated into this sitting room. It’s bursting at the seams.

He frowns. Thinks of the ring, in all its shining silver pompousness, dropped and the curled right into Draco’s fist.
Hermione’s face twists up in further apology, but Harry just shrugs and walks into the kitchen proper.
He’s worried that saying
"You've named the shop Curiosity's Curios, Harry. You can't blame me for trying to adhere to tradition."
Harry laughs, again. “Why would I be scared?”
“I can’t believe I’m doing this.” Ron’s looking down at the little box, maroon velvet, and Harry’s heart squeezes, and it’s not even just for whatever he’s feeling about him and Draco. He’s suddenly feeling so much happiness and love for his best friends that he wants to shout as loud as he can in this noisy fucking house.
Draco gapes, and then glowers, before slumping back in his seat, seemingly content not to press further.
“That was threatening.”

Draco’s face crumples, and his eyes seem to brim with unshed tears.
His thoughts are caught though, because Hermione’s got an arm each and is dragging them out of the bedroom, with a quick featherlight and not unsubstantial strength.
Draco’s voice hardens. “We’re
“What? Banal, even? Capable of nothing hurtful or damaging? Harry, look where we are.” He gestures. Harry doesn’t know if he means

Wandering around Hermione’s house is starting to feel like he’s back in that white train station again, waiting for the inevitable.
“Sorry, all, to interrupt your evening.” A few mumbles here and there from those who’re a bit annoyed, and Ron ignores them. “I just needed to get something out before you all get so trashed that I have to carry you out to the curb.”
Hermione looks at Draco once the smoke has dissipated. “How did she find all that out so fast?”
to be the case.”
Harry pauses. The man looks horrified that he’s lost – something. “What?” He’s kinder with his words this time, at risk of escalating the horror.
She nods. “Yep. You know, a message or something.”
Harry whimpers. And then he can’t take it anymore and stumbles through to the bathroom, grabbing onto the chest of drawers and the clothes chair as he goes. He stumbles blindly into the open closet door – “
’.” He sighs. “What nonsense.”
“Well,” Draco deposits the cups on the kitchen table and takes Harry’s wand out of his hands, quickly vanishing the lot. He seems to have sobered up quite completely, regardless of the amount of Elven wine he’d had – back when there was an engagement and Harry was in good cheer. “I said that the auror’s would show up around 1am. Seeing as it was 12, I lose.”
Harry
Draco laughs. “You think that’s a
Her eyebrows furrow. “Pardon?”
They’d spent a while talking before succumbing to the drink and the exhaustion. Sipping the prune-juice back and forth, smoke rising out of their mouths to the ceiling like they were puffing on cigarettes. Discussing a lot of nothing.
’ kind of movement, and sits down in the empty seat between a red and sheepish Neville and worried looking Ron, but accepts the easy slide of the mug across the table. Harry’s concerned as she picks it up, wonders whether she’ll question the apparent lack of friction on the wood, but doesn’t. Good sport.
work crap shifts at their crap jobs, or are studying until the early hours to make up for being on a 7pm to 10pm bender on a Wednesday.
The joggers land on the ground from where Draco didn’t catch them – too busy squeezing his face into the t-shirt in his hands.

But that’s their Saturday. They hunker down on the couch, play the wireless, read their respective books or sports magazines, and they wallow away the night until they find it late enough to justify sex.
Harry can’t keep himself from vocalising, very,
Draco gets up eventually, with Harry's hand in his own helping him. They walk into Harry's shop, and they settle down so that Draco can write a few letters of greeting to his loved ones. Hes sure that within the hour the stacks of cups and saucers and clocks and trinkets and
“You need to leave.”
thing?”
Harry tidies his plate as the rest of them talk and plan. Sounds of eating and scraping at plates continue under the noise of conversation. Ron groans “bloody good, Harry.” He leans back in his chair and out his torso presses – just enough for his stomach to make a loud hollow noise when he slaps at it.
“Okay, okay. Thank you both.” Draco says. “Shouldn’t we be making our merry way to a pub to watch our nearest and dearest destroy themselves?”
She smiles. “Wonderful.” Then she seems to run her eyes over Harry’s clothes and his unruly hair, still slightly wet at the ends. “What’re you looking for?”
All that progress, gone.”
know about who we are?”
Draco manages to look simultaneously like his heart has broken and also that he’s happy he’s been proven right. “Exactly.”
August turns into September, which turns into Hermione’s birthday, which turns into a two-week belated party at their own home. The floo has been deactivated for the evening at risk of one of Hermione’s muggle friends watching someone stumble drunk out of green fire. Instead, the front door is swung right open and being kept that way with the help of a trusty troll’s foot umbrella stand.
“Niamh, Ron.”
. As he’s turning around the fifth or so ring, he looks up at the woman. “What are you trying on?”
“How many for breakfast?” Harry asks over his shoulder. A flick of his wand gets coffee brewing.
Harry rolls his eyes, and turns away, leaves the store without a final word. He’s sure he can hear her cackle to herself before the heavy security door shuts with a ring behind him.
Since Draco’s distracted, Harry doesn’t bother to bring up whatever was bothering him earlier. Whatever he’d lost. Instead, Harry walks over and chucks Hermione out of the way of the hob, flicking his own wand instead. The hob gives an uproarious lurch and flames burst from the front two burners.
Another
” He says, pleadingly.
Draco is looking at Harry. Harry sighs in relief. Makes him feel better. That this isn’t one of those moments when Draco doesn’t want to talk about something. It’s good. But Draco’s looking at Harry like he’s confused and concerned and needs to know something. Right now.
Harry and Draco immediately follow, hugging everyone they meet along the way. Harry’s face gets pressed right up against Seamus’s stomach – the man had jumped right into Harry’s arms yelling about absolutely nothing as loudly as possible. Draco is sobbing like a baby into Hermione’s hair when Harry looks over, Ron covering the both off them in his big arms and so many more tears.
Draco mumbles “
any. Rings, or anything like that. He used to have one, it was a family thing, and then he…” Harry shrugs, “well, he chucked it, actually.”
Blaise, who is now very sedated, puts down his coffee from where it had taken up permanent residence at his lips. “I feel as though I’ve celebrated enough for you two to get engaged four times.”
The morning of the 1
Which shortens to 1 meter when Harry crosses the distance. "What you got there?"
“I just love her so much, you know?”
“Mornin’” Harry says, flatly.
It’s organised chaos, is how it ends up.
“I rather think,” Luna starts, “that when riddles seem too difficult, such that they plague us, looking back can be the best cause for an answer.”
“Mr. Potter!” rings out loudly from the front hall, and Harry and Draco groan in frustration.
Ron, who’d looked dead to the world on the table, yells as he wakes up.
And then it’s Ginny’s voice which says: “For fucks sakes, Blaise, can you pull your head out of your arse? Stop being such a wanker, for five fucking seconds?”
He hears Draco drop to the ground in front of him, and forces his eyes open. There he is, white blonde hair misplaced and his clean day robes hazardously arranged. Draco looks anxious, his bottom lip red and ruined between his teeth, his eyes roving over Harry’s face.
She passes the parchment to Draco, and Harry doesn’t bother to read over his shoulder.
There’s a conversation happening behind the door that he can hear, maybe a few raised voices, and he’s almost certain one of those voices sounds
“Who in their right minds would be able to sleep through that?” Blaise groans. It sounds muffled which – ahh. It is. His face is pressed right into the kitchen table. Ginny has a foot out and keeps kicking Blaise’s chair in an un-even tempo.
The shop-keep speaks. “I think these ones can get engravings on the inside.”
It’s 11pm on the 31
that I don’t love you.”
Hermione yells “I need a drink! I’m fucking engaged!” and then Draco and Harry get their ass into gear, stumbling down to the kitchen and throwing a few spells around to get conjured flutes of the sparkling Elven wine stacked on top of each other, and then everyone in the house is downing glass after glass of the stuff. One of the muggles yells out “holy hell!” when they see the stack, and Harry has to quickly grab onto the floating trays.
Harry laughs, a little hysterically. “That’s
Draco leans in closer, his hot, quick, exhalations cresting over Harry’s face, and his glasses fog up a little. “I’m not scared of marrying you.” Draco says.
They float back to their bedroom at around 4am, silence in their path. And the conversation is put on hold.
Harry blanches. Whips his head to Draco. Whips back to Ron. He’s dizzy.
He grabs down a bottle, steals a couple of dirty flutes off the table and directs them at Draco, who
“Harry,” Draco says, a little more urgently. “I swear, it’s absolutely nothing.
Draco scoffs, and a leg flings out and hit Harry’s shin. Harry kicks back and ignores Draco’s prompt to involve himself. “That’s basically the
But Harry pressed the heel of one hand right into an eye and in the spotty darkness of his vision can see Mirrors that show someone’s truest desires, and a ruby Stones that make you immortal; an enchanted Goblet, and a Vanishing cabinet. A wand, a stone, a cloak. He sees six segments of a mad man’s soul and the seventh that marked his own death. What part of his life hasn’t been coloured by powerful magical objects, harmless or not?
Blaise looks pensive for a second, and then turns to face Harry a little easier. “I think you two should do the honourable thing and tell us if you ever have plans to do such spontaneity. I expect I will not want to go through the same drinking without warning, thank you very much.”
Harry’s lips twitch. He leans back against the kitchen table, exhausted, drops his head back between his shoulder blades. Draco hops up and sits on the table next to him, softly presses his lips to Harry’s shoulder.
A voice cuts through the gentle hum on the room, and forces Draco’s wide open again. Pansy. “What the fuck are you two doing?”
“Oh,” Rolf says, picking up a teacup, “it was some runic code. Something to do with Pandora.”
“Do you even have a ring?”
Blaise nods. Pulls himself taller, towering over Harry. “I’m not… sure.” He seems to be judging his words carefully. “What one is supposed to do.”
Draco has his forehead pressed to Luna’s shoulder from behind. Luna is patting his head and murmuring nonsensical words into his ear.
“Well,” Draco says, self-importantly, “I am more Black than you’ll ever be.”
, he rebukes, and sips at the coffee Draco made for him, with a kind little splash of milk for a late morning mug.
The house groans again when Draco and Harry get to the bottom of the stairs, before suddenly ceasing, sighing out and settling down. Harry gives the wall nearest him a pat, and Draco immediately leans all of his weight on his own.
I heard someone in this painting
Harry furrows his eyebrows. “Luna?”
He sighs out loud, thoughts pushed to the back of the mind where they belong, and makes very confident cuts through the red apple. Small segments. Cuts another one. Gets lazy and gives up at the eighths, placing the knife down on the edge of the sink. Chucks the fruit hurriedly in a bowl and walks lightly down the short hall and to his bedroom.
As no one has bothered to serve themselves, Rolf stands and hand delivers a cup and saucer to everyone else, then pours a clear golden tea into ceramic. Harry is slightly concerned at the small red dots floating in it, but picks up the cup and drinks a sip anyway. His eyes bulge a little when he realises that the small dots are a type of chilli, but it’s honestly quite soothing, so he keeps at it with little aerating sips. Draco looks over at Harry when his sips are getting a little too loud, but Harry just smirks back. Draco kicks out his foot and lightly knocks it against Harry’s in retribution, but turns back around to talk with Luna and Rolf further.
Draco’s eyes start twitching.
“With the ring.”
Harry legs it down too, and is just in time to see Draco throw floo powder into the grate, and then hastens across the obstacle course that is Luna’s living room and grabs Draco’s arm, pulling him away from the green flames.
“Hi.”
She blinks, and then her skin darkens into a flush. She squeaks out “excuse me?”
At one point when almost everyone has scraped their plates clean and are on their second and third and fourth cups of a seemingly never-ending supply, Della stands up to help clear the plates and the cutlery (the great initiative of a muggleborn), to which Niamh straightens up fast to help. It’s when Ron is handing over a stack of plates from his end of the table that Niamh suddenly shouts “oh!”
Harry feels his breathing get quicker, but suddenly Draco’s got his hand grasped right under his chin. Then Draco’s head is resting on his shoulder. Harry drops his head onto Draco’s and feels a little better. Feels all that bubbly love and anxiety and anticipation settle down a little at how close Draco is.
They’ve made their way through pleasant conversation with their friends and sometimes their co-workers and so many people they don’t know because Harry didn’t care if people bought people.
think Harry. Freezes just the slightest amount, but Draco doesn’t miss it. The leg grip loosens, and suddenly Draco has launched himself up into a sitting position to stare right in Harry’s face, eyes narrowed in question. Harry avoids his gaze.
“Including?”
A laugh, slightly disbelieving. “See?”
He laughs. “Yes,” he says, in answer to whatever question had been muddled through the chipping paint and warped conservation charm over the years, and trundles back up to the attic to bring another down.
“Two separate occasions. Come on,” she looks around the table, points her fork at everyone. Harry thinks he sees a speck of egg fly off it and onto his own plate, but just shrugs. At the lack of enthusiasm, Pansy repeats “come on! It’s not a true milestone if it hasn’t been celebrated!”
charm is gone and the whole room is converging on the two in the middle.
Draco shrugs. “Haven’t the foggiest. Lovegood eccentricities.”
. It’s when you start snogging at the stove, and then your boyfriend getting nuts over a ring that alarm bells start to go off.”
At one point, when the party has devolved as Ron’s prophetic wisdom said it would, Draco has Harry pressed up against a wall, and they’re kissing like mad.
She smiles with one half of her mouth, a little sympathetically. “Well, you don’t seem to be too confident with it. Do you think he’d do it? Propose?”
Her mouth drops, but she seems to catch it before she starts to gape like a fish. “Oh.” She flicks a glance at her colleague by the till. “Well.” A glance down at the rings with their ostentatious gems. “We
They’re both sober, are Hermione and Ron, so that’s why it’s not surprising when suddenly Hermione quietly slaps a hand to her mouth, eyes bulging up at Ron. Ron looks at her, unable to keep in a grin, and nods.
for breakfast.”
The box and the ring are tight in one of his hands, but she suddenly leans back to grab at it, rip the ring out of the box and forces it into Ron’s hand. “Sorry, sorry. Yes. Hermione.” Their faces are close together, and neither can stop themselves from grinning. Hermione’s talking, but it’s impossible to make out over the noise of the room. “Hermione, will you marry me.” Thank Merlin Ron’s
Harry was shocked, he stood there in the corridor watching as Draco began to walk away from him.
We stand like that for a while, Harry burning his tongue on his hot chocolate, me trying to recover from the sheer embarrassment of having to be woken up by Potter because of a stupid nightmare. I keep expecting him to ask me about it, but he gets back in to bed and finishes his chocolate. Just before we both go back to sleep, his voice emerges out of the darkness, which is much more welcome than Voldemort’s, I can tell you that.
Harry started and glanced at Blaise. Draco, gay?
He turned back to the wheel until they gt to the train station.
“Merlin’s beard Draco! Calm down I was only saying thank you and trust me I meant it” He turns away and bends over, reaching for his pyjamas. “aren’t you going to shower?”
, Harry thought with relief,
‘What..’ He looks at me and shakes his head slightly, ‘I’m so sorry Harry.’
‘I’ll see you in our room’ Draco called over his shoulder as he vanished up the staircase to the astronomy tower.
‘But this Pagani fellow
“I told you, after the war ended I didn’t want to live” he began, but Draco interrupts softly;
Harry leads him in past the trunk, and in to the front room.

to the idea. “You will now follow me in to the great Hall”
he stood up and began to excuse himself, but before he could even say Thanks! Draco got his arms around Harry and swiftly pulled his shirt up from the hem.
“Tea?”
He didn’t think he was ready for this. It was all too soon. Too soon after Narcissa died; too soon after he left St. Mungo’s with a discharge slip and a stress ball clutched so hard it burst;
“What?”
Harry watched as he brushed the powdery rosin away with a soft cloth and strapped it in to the case. Again the love and care was evident in not only Draco’s playing but in the softness with which he handled the violin, as though it was a young child he cared for.
‘Thanks, er, what is it?’ I ask cautiously.
Oh. Oh shit.
“Sorry you didn’t want to room with me.” Draco said, quietly.
Finally, Draco stood before him, twisting his hands together and began to speak,
He hadn’t expected to be so drawn in to the music as much as he had been. The lilting tune and brilliance of the violinist had captured him from the moment the needle touched the vinyl, with the sweeping melodies and the theme coming back in triumphant orchestral unity. I wonder how many pieces there are, he pondered, surely there must be more, I wonder how much Draco has heard? Who did Narcissa, or more likely Lucius, consider appropriate for their little prince?
“No!”
The first week flew by with barely a hitch. Harry sat with Draco, Blaise and Pansy for lunches and dinners, keenly aware of Ron staring daggers and Hermione taking small concerned looks over her shoulder.
Then he lifted the bow high above his head and began.
“They’re not even that bad, quit fussing” Harry batted his hands away, and smiled weakly.
Harry is leaning over me, hair framing his face, no glasses and desperation written across his face. I have the strangest urge to kiss him.
“Stay”
'This is your godfather's isn't it' He asked softly, watching the fondness in Harry's eyes as he lowered the needle.
Ron’s smile doesn’t waver and he leans his head in agreement. “Just give me a couple of minutes, alright?”
clang echoes like it's heralding Draco's imminent demise.
Regardless of the blip, everyone sorts themselves out quite quickly. Ron is carrying a bag which is clinking like it’s stuffed full of Elven wine, and Hermione is leaning against his side near the kitchen table as Ron and Draco talk gently about whatever nonsense is happening with the Diagon Alley Business Association.
. “I thought you were going to say something like that.”
He startles, and looks at Harry. “What?” Still a little blank.
Blaise turns away, unashamed of their actions. Harry snorts around a sip of coffee and has to cough a few times remembering the drunk rambling in the howler that was broadcast around the burrow.
Ron flushes. “… and we fell asleep?”
He realises as he’s walking that he didn’t put all of that washing on he’d sent to the laundry. He groans, and gets a look from a woman sat opposite him on the Tube, which he ignores.
It's an ugly little hole in the wall, Draco thinks. Peeling paint, done the muggle way, and dirty windows that probably wouldn't let in the mere amounts of light that this area of Diagon is privy to. Especially with the amount of crap blocking Dracos view inside.
been more annoyed than normal. You’re not usually this much of a shit.” Draco shuffles forward and grabs Harry’s chin so that Harry can’t look away. Harry feels suddenly very on the spot and very overwhelmed, and looks at Draco’s thin lips so he’s not looking at Draco’s bright grey eyes. He’s very bad at secret keeping when he’s drunk. This is going to become a disaster.
Draco follows, “Harry thinks it misses Kreacher”, and then just dumps the cloud of empties onto the table with a great
“Huh?” Draco looks bewildered, face relaxing next when he remembers his earlier words, and then straight back into bewildered when he realises that Harry’s avoiding the question. “I don’t know. We had those plans, didn’t we?”
you two are up. Granger was trying to break your
“Remember-”
It allows Harry to wander further in and lean up against the fridge in effortless silence. He gets the milk out when the tea has been brewing for the requisite five minutes. Watches Draco
“Yet.”
Harry looks pointedly at Blaise. “Uhuh.”
. You’re predictable.”
Harry shuts his eyes and breathes once or twice. Draco lands his lips gently on his face, navigating the glasses just so, and then Harry can’t say no. Because he definitely loves this man an awful lot, and will definitely attend a pub event where his two closest friends are celebrating getting married, and the rest of the bunch are going to stare daggers at Harry and/or Draco the entire night if they don’t bring the correct amount of cheer.
“You need a plan,” Draco is opining here, he knows. “Tell your girlfriend you’re cheating on her; tell everyone you’ve quit your job.” Every word hammers the nail that’ll break Draco’s heart, and save his mind. “Stop using me.”
“Don’t be stupid,” Draco said. “Was it too much?”
“Indeed, not something I’d expected to hear. Certainly wouldn’t want to hear it again.” He held out his hand to help Lily toddle over the blanket to Harry, “No matter how pleasant the outcome.” She threw herself in Harry’s lap with a giggle.
Draco slid his hands down to Harry’s shoulders and rubbed at the tight knots. “Hey, we’ll deal with it tomorrow; right now I’ve got a naked boyfriend, a locked door, and five otherwise occupied children.” He trailed a trio of kisses up Harry’s neck as his hand made its way down his chest; the cuff of his shirt getting wet as he pinched a nipple.
L’Oliveto was a quiet restaurant tucked away on Cordy Alley far from the hustle and bustle of Diagon; “It doesn’t even do chips,” Harry whispered, gleefully conspiratorial, across the linen clothed table. Draco raised his glass in cheers, over his elegantly scripted menu.
“Mm hmm,” Draco agreed, not taking his eyes off the game; the snitch looping around the homemade goal hoops at the far end of the field.
“Yeah,” Harry confirmed, “but Muggle, we’ll probably go out to Brent Cross; the boys want to get something for Arthur’s birthday.”
Pansy continued unabated, “The correct way to fuck and run, Harry, is to thank your host and say 'This was great, we should do it again some time.' Or are you too ashamed to be seen sleeping with a Death–“
“Can I try it, plea-ea-ea-se?” Teddy begged. Harry shook his head, no, and took another bite of his sandwich. “Draco, please, please?”
“No,” she points at him with the spatula, “you don't get to play that dumb. You like Draco, right?”
Potter spluttered, water dripping from his mouth, the uncouth oaf. At least he had the decency to use his napkin rather than his sleeve. He righted himself with another sip of water and then, clear as day, bold as brass, said, “Fuckin’ fantastic, Parkinson. Thanks for asking.”
They made it through a platter of
Draco nodded, “Yeah. I know. And you know you are-”
With a glower at Pansy, the utter cow, he waved their waiter over, “Eggs Benedict and another one of these for me,” he points to the nearly empty Bloody Mary, “and don’t be shy with the Reyka.” He nods to Pansy, “She’ll have a plain egg white omelette.” He tunes out while the others shamble about the menu, only coming back to the group once the waiter has left and from the corner of his eye he saw Pansy fix her sights on Potter.
“So they probably won’t notice if we slip away.”
“Is it what you do?” Draco counters. “Skive off and smoke behind the broom sheds?”
Harry put the wine, take-away, and crumpled flowers on the coffee table next to Draco’s book and crouched down to Albus’ level. “Why’d you do that, Al?”
“Ronald!”
“Well, I wanted to let you know that we’ve closed the Buckner case. It was your analysis of the Armadillo bile that nailed it. There’s just the one registered breeder feeding them fluxweed. Who’d’ve ever even thought to check for that? It was great, really was.”
, same difference.”
“Oh,” Harry saw the long, lean,
“We never have time, if we start that now, we’ll never eat and I want something that isn’t pasta or shaped like a dinosaur. I want to have a whole meal without having to hold peace talks or accio peas from nostrils or have food on three separate plates because it just can’t touch! I want dessert to myself. I want wine. Wine, Draco!”
, questioning.
He leaves his shoes with the rest of the mess. Wanders down the hall. Stops in the alcove at the bottom to the kitchen. Watches Draco where he leans against the counter with his crossed arms and his tapping feet. Gets vertigo when the tapping increases and increases. Harry blanches and looks away.
Draco laughs, squeezes the arm around Harry. “Ron. Aurors came about an hour back and told us to vanish it all.”
Harry winces, thinks of the state of the house if there are people asleep in all the bedrooms over all the floors.
Thank Merlin he has his wallet, tucked within his coat pocket, bank card and a good pinch of Muggle bank notes stuffed in. At least he can hail a taxi at the end of all this to make it to the pub. But there’s not a hell of a lot he can think to do right now before that point.
“Huh?”
Harry laughs again, but presses skip on the song.
Harry feels like he can feel a hammer slowly descending onto his heart. He nods.
She rolls her eyes. She starts to pack all the rings back into their little slots in the velvet.
Another grind. Harry’s panting as this continues, Draco’s lips everywhere and his hips unceasing and then suddenly he can’t take it.
(Neville) “Woah, Blaise, I think…”
thing. It was meant to come out when you were ready for marriage.”
Thankfully, because as soon as Draco sighs out in violent relief the house reminds them of the urgency of the situation. The mirror rattles dangerously – pipes in the walls groan.
“Thought I’d better be safe.” And he grins.
He pats out at Draco’s backside as the man passes, and Draco smiles back, a little gratefully.
He screams, the sound reverberating in the hot car. “Stop. Stop. Shut up. I can’t stand this anymore.” The heat from his voice makes him
“I’m not the one who’s emotionally stunted.”
He grabs Draco’s hand.
“In here!” comes called from another doorway Harry knows leads to a kitchen. Draco and Luna get caught a quiet little conversation, and Harry does a loop, looks at a couple of new pictures he doesn’t recognise. Luna and Rolf with masses of young wizarding children from across the globe – set on beaches or fields or mountain tops.
Narrowed grey eyes. “Why? Oh, maybe because you’re rushing into it quicker than you rushed out of auror training.”
Draco doesn’t look away, so Harry has to, turning to face Luna, who’s now standing in the doorway to the hall. He finally notices the significant number of boxes that are splayed across the room, and wonders hoe Draco and he even managed to make their way through unscathed from hitting any.
“Yes,” is the simultaneous response that he receives. Like it was bloody rehearsed.
That sounds much more like an exclamation than a question now.
A wincing beep screams out from the speaker, and then a thud as the locking mechanism on the door gives way. He pushes it open and is greeted by the rundown entry way, walking through to the stairs, giving the elevator a sceptical pass.
He’s not… completely familiar with the area. It’s definitely some commercial district, nowhere close to the Leaky, but he thinks he can recognise a couple of the taller buildings, and knows that he could probably find his way if he needed to. He pats the pockets of his pants and realises that he’s left his brick of a phone back at Grimmauld, which isn’t the end of the world, given that he has his… wand…
“Well,” she says, and then gestures at his entire person. “You come in here looking like you’d rather be anywhere else, and then you
He’s gone white as a sheet now. “That stuff cost. So much money.”

Draco, ex-convict, is unfortunately used to this reaction to his presence. He doesn't waste his precious sanity on worrying about it anymore, but at this point he's feeling a little fragile all in all. So when his panic attack picks right up from where it started, and his head starts to get a little woozy from the lack of oxygen and the continued expelling of blood from his nostrils, he doesn't blame himself much.
(See the end of the chapter for
of August is early. Saturdays are a vibrant addendum to their monotonous weeks, and Harry pushes Draco out of bed come 8am. Draco barely complains. They’re used to these early Saturday mornings, regardless of whatever excellent nonsense occurred the night before.
At that point Draco seems to realise what the time is and then politely (loudly) says “what in Merlin’s name are you all still doing here at 12:30? Do you not have your own lives? Your own homes?”
“You don’t.” Draco’s hands are rubbing up and down the sides of Harry’s arms. Harry’s neck is getting a little sore looking up. “You think you do. You think: ‘wow, Draco and I have lived together for two years and we haven’t killed each other yet. It’s time to get married’.”
“Morning Ronald” Draco says, faux cheerily, and then busies himself with
Draco hasn’t left his side all night, but they haven’t yet fallen off into the back room to talk further. They also haven’t skived off early, unfortunately.
Draco pauses, but then asks “in Paris?”
Harry winces, and pulls himself away slightly from where he was leaning closer.
“I bought this,” he flashes the box, which is suddenly in his hands, “about two years ago on a whim. Just got my first real paycheck, and should have put it straight into my vault and not looked back, but then you’d just shown up at the door in the middle of a rant because some… professor or something had been rude enough to make you storm out of class.” One of Hermione’s course mates cackles here, probably at the memory.
customers browsing, some looking up every couple of seconds to see if they can catch the eye of a shop-keeper. His nostrils flare whilst keeping in a huff of laughter.
“What?” Harry asks, shocked. “You weren’t going to tell me about the ring?”
But they talked about something every now and then. Things that mattered. Visions of futures for the two of them; things they’d talked about before, but images that felt so much closer, so much more tangible, when escaping through lips set below the remnants of their red-rimmed eyes.
'What's that Draco?' he asked, pointing at the thing under his bed. 'Looks interesting?'
“What is it Potter” She tried to look stern but the creases in her forehead betrayed her concern.
Harry in turn watched Draco. He had never shown much interest in classical music, but perhaps that was because in all the records that Harry had been able to salvage from the boxes left in Sirius' childhood room there was nothing like it. Classic rock yes, classical music no. The music was enticing and exciting, full of layers and intricacies and despite himself Harry felt his ears being drawn to the music and marveling at the virtuosity of the violinist.
“I mean, I’m a crappy person” He stared at Harry like he'd gone mad, but Harry was right, he knew. 'I don’t deserve the love of anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. I practically told them to
Draco’s POV
? What an idiot.
“Which bed?” Harry repeated.
We reach the Great Hall at the same time as Pansy and Zabini, meaning of course Hermione and Ron are there as well. Ron’s ears are burning red signalling some kind of offense (presumably committed by Zabini) as he rapidly whispers his grievances into Hermione’s sympathetic ear. Zabini on the other hand is the picture of complacency, his dress immaculate as he greets Draco formally. Pansy smiles cautiously at me and then at Hermione as Ron leads her off to the safe retreat of the all-Gryffindor table.
As the door closes, I hear him groan and slide further into the voluptuous folds of his duvet. I hop in and out of the shower, brush my teeth and leave the bathroom in time to see Draco sitting, eyes shut, on the edge of his bed. His hair is piled in an uncontrollably curly bush on his head, falling over his eyes and so wildly different to the carefully slicked down hair of his youth. I realise that I’m staring when he coughs, shakes his head and suddenly gets up - full of life.
Nice. Cool.' Harry began to panic, whatever he thought would happen, it wasn't that.
Well shit.
“Well I think its jolly unfair of you to cut yourself off from the absolute
‘If I don’t hear an apology cross those crusty lips in the next forty eight hours, Merlin help me!’
music suddenly becomes more imprtant
‘Sorry, just your face at the thought of actually contacting the devil’ he snickered again but composed himself at the hurt expression on Harry’s face. ‘He didn’t actually sell his soul to the devil, people just wanted a way to explain his ridiculous talent. But you never know, he could have been a wizard.’
'Yeah, so sorry, its a potions detention' Draco said with exaggerated regret, 'blasted boy needs to learn not to explode cauldrons, its really delaying the whole potion making process'
The voice changes and its my mothers, no my fathers, no wait…im being shaken side to side, pitching forward and backwards like a ship in a storm and then…
to hide and wait for it all to end, yes; eager to kill Dumbledore? No. 'Ron doesn’t know
“You’ve fallen out with Ron and Hermione, haven’t you?” He asked quietly as though afraid to upset Harry again.
'What? It was just a conversation between new friends' Draco shrugged nonchalantly, smirking.
Harry sat on the stairs and stared.
“why are you being so nice to me? Not that I don’t appreciate it, I just don’t feel I deserve it.”
‘we’re going to be sharing a room Ma-Draco, you don’t need to disappear every time one of us needs to change, and besides,’ he grins, ‘I’m not looking.’
“Fine. Sorry”
“No, I haven’t!” Harry croaked, sniffing and examined the damage done by the coffee. “I mean not that much.”
Harry thought savagely
He can’t see me, but I shrug anyway and slide down into my own bed. It was definitely something, but I also know, he definitely doesn’t trust me just yet. I have so many questions as to why he’s been so receptive to my attempts at friendship and I really don’t want to mess it up now.
The piece that Draco plays is Paganini caprice no.9 - all Paganini caprices are technically difficult but this one is around first/second year music conservatoire level meaning Draco is extremely good for his age/stage.
“I’d ask you to ride shotgun, but I don’t think I can handle that much,” He remarks with a sideways grin, a touch of his more familiar self.
Harry stood at the bottom, bewildered and alone and wondered how they had got there quite so fast. Still, as he made his way to the Great Hall, if he gave Draco some space it would all be ok he was sure of it. What with Ron and Draco and Neville it was proving to be a very confusing day for Harry.
“Um, so which bed do you want?”
“How could you think that? Of course…” Draco was the one to trail off this time, he stopped himself as though he was about to reveal something deep and well hidden. “Anyway, I daresay we’ll…we’ll rub along.”
Blaise and Pansy laughed, but Draco just watched the table.
Harry glanced at him and saw that once more; the normally ice-cold Malfoy blushed red and avoided his eye.
‘No!’

They can all see the thestrals now. Everyone. Even the tiny first years, coming back to re-do first year, because the Carrows’ made life a living
He’s prattling on about some project or other, catching Harry's eye every now and again in the rearview mirror. “…you’ll find that out when you get there!” He finishes brightly and flashes an off-kilter smile over his shoulder.
For some reason I’m annoyed, and I realise that I don’t want
‘Oh dear,’ He made a mocking sad face, ‘Is our charms genius having a little trouble with his essay? Does he need big clever Draco to sort it out?’

Memories of Narcissa’s long fair hair brushing my face as she whispered the promise of life; of Hermione and Ron kissing on the stair and the feeling that no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t be happy for them. The overwhelming sense of numbness, nothing as he watched the Weasleys mourn.
“They just don’t really understand, you know? They don’t get that my whole life there’s been this duty I must do for humanity, and once I found out I would die at the end, I didn’t really think about what would go after? I just assumed I’d die, and I’d fulfil my use. So, when I didn’t have anything to do, I just didn’t see the point in living anymore you know?” It was a clumsy explanation, filled with
“Not what I was going to say, actually” he smirks and the old flicker of annoyance sparks in Harry's chest.
“Got any chocolate frogs?” Harry ask, an attempt at nonchalance.
The trunk was sat in the doorway. Harry Potter watched it from the sofa as though wary of attack. It had his whole life, in there one way or another. It was steeped in memories and emotions; good times, bad times, glory and despair. It had been his most prized possession for years. And now it was getting another outing.
The girls now all done, Professor began on the boys, with “Blaise Zabini and Neville Longbottom.” Neville’s brave attempt at a handshake fell flat, and Harry couldn’t help but worry for him.
“You know”
“Oh, well, er I mean, you seem to have the one alongside the window?”
'Well? Where is he then?' She demanded with a toss of her head 'He better not be in detention, I swear that boy learns nothing'
“Thanks”
Their new-found friendship is tested amongst plans and concealment. Harry is left thoroughly confused.
“neither of you know how limp I feel. Like a marionette with no puppeteer. Dumbledore left me with nothing after I’d fulfilled my role; all my life he’d trained me,
of space” Ron watched the top of Harry's head as he in turn watched the pavement “Mate.”
“Oh, hm, yes, sure” I turn away and curse, once again, I can feel the heat rising in my cheeks.
“Merlin’s beard Pansy, give it a rest?” Blaise scoffed and helped himself to pie from the suddenly full plates. “anyway, you know he’s gay.”
‘what’s that?’ I ask after about ten minutes of being ignored. Bleary eyed, clocks me and stuffs the map away out of sight.
“What do you mean?”
‘Hey scarface’ Draco said, plonking himself down in the seat opposite, placing his violin on the floor and scattering sheets of music all over the table.
Scorpius pulled Beaky tighter under his arm as Harry sat on the floor and leaned back against the edge of the bed, “A long time ago, in a land far away, there was a kingdom ruled by a foolish king…”
“Sorry,” Harry said leaning back into Draco’s fingers as they scratched lightly at his scalp, “I shouldn’t have left you to deal with…” he waved his hand vaguely at everything behind the closed bathroom door, “...that.”
“Uh uh, no way,” Harry clucked. “We are going out for dinner before any of that.”
“You noticed.”
Ron looked over at Draco with a questioning head tilt, he returned with a nod and Ron swung his leg over his broom then flew over to Scorpius. “Hey,” he said slowing to a halt, “can I play with you?” He leaned in closer. “I hear you’re the best keeper we’ve got.”
“Seriously, it was so weird, ‘Mione.” Harry snatches a slice of pepper from the frying pan, narrowly missing the slap of her spatula. “He just changed so quickly, one minute it's perfectly normal and then he just throws me out of the lab.”
“Yeah, hyperventilated screaming for me. Didn’t even settle when we were both here. Seems you got him down though.”
Albus turned around and stared directly into his dad’s eyes. “I punched Rose,” he said with no remorse.
“Levicorpus!”
“It’s a teeny tiny bit of magic, come on. I can’t go to Hogwarts not knowing Levicorpus. Everyone knows it.”
“Yes, I have,” contended Draco with a curl of his lip, “I heated your tea in it this morning.”
“Sorry, we only had two on call, and they were down in Tintagel tidying up after some pixies; they’re getting all riled up with the Merlin-crazed muggles wandering unchecked through their land. Scorp and Albus?”
“He doesn't mean you, you don't seem like a cunt,” The Weaselette said to the waiter. He didn't seem particularly convinced as he placed the dishes on the table and made a sharp get-away.
Draco waved his hand towards the corner where the boys had stood, “That?”
They sit in companionable silence, leaning against the cool stone of the broom shed wall; Malfoy shreds blades of grass into confetti between draws, Harry digs divots into the soft earth with the toe of his trainer. “So,” Harry says eventually, not looking up, “is this what you do? Sit out here, hiding from the world?”
“She didn’t say sorry!”
As Harry pushed forward, Draco tried to lie back on the worktop knocking a basket of calculators, three rubber ducks, and a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle to the floor. Harry straightened up and looked at the mess on the floor. “This is weird, right?”
Harry leaned back into the stream. “Mmm hmm, made it as far as lunchtime before I caved and had Gin take him.”
“This is good,” finished Draco. He turned in Harry’s arms and twisted his arms around his neck. He leaned in for a kiss, Harry’s mouth opening easily under his soft lips. Harry slid his hands down to Draco’s arse walking him back two paces and hoisting him up the couple of necessary inches to sit on the worktop. Draco wound his legs around Harry’s waist and with a tug pulled their crotches together.
“Like you aren't the same,” Harry scoffs.
“No buts. I didn’t know any magic until I went to Hogwarts, and I turned out just fine. Now, you can sit down and have a sausage roll, or you can go and play football with the boys.”
“Leave him be, Parkinson,” Potter all but growled, “clearly your beef’s with me.”
“Well go and tell them, then.”
“There was a slight incident,” Draco said, closing his book and setting it on the coffee table. “Albus, please tell your father what happened.”
“No, I’m up,” Draco said, pulling back the covers on Harry’s side of the bed.
“I loathe you,” Draco hissed across the table.
“Yeah mate, he probably tossed off as soon as you were out the door.”
Draco almost succeeded in fighting back a smile, “Perfectly adequate.”
, but they know it started when a 'War Hero' hadn't done his homework so skipped double Transfiguration to have a smoke behind the broom sheds and a 'War Criminal' chose the same spot to lick his wounds away from the taunts, hexes, and jinxes.
Malfoy opens his eyes and he’s staring directly at Harry, it’s all it takes for Harry’s orgasm to tear down his spine and for him to come all over his hand.
“At Brent Cross, we know,” Harry nodded to the bundle on his lap.
“‘s fine, you’ve had them all day-“
“Stop it, Pansy.” Draco slammed his fork to his plate with a clatter.
Harry smiled.
Draco pulled a fourth rubber duck from under his back. “I think so.” He squeezed the duck and it gave a long slow wheeze.
“Mm hmm,” acknowledged Draco.
“Gonna say sorry to Rosie.”
“Perfectly adequate,” Pansy mocked. “You’re going to sit next to the man you've been lusting over for nigh on a decade and tell him he gives ‘perfectly adequate’ blow jobs?”
He stretched his arm over the empty chair next to him.
Harry can’t focus, darting between Malfoy’s bottom lip where he’s biting down on it and the pale hand rubbing the growing bulge in his crotch. “You’re not…”
“We’re waiting on our other guests.”
“Bed and bath time for five says it’s Scorpius,” Draco wagered, snagging another piece of apple.
“Didn’t mean to,” James murmured.
“I see,” Harry said.
“Perfectly adequate.”
Harry paused in his scooping of broccoli off the tablecloth and back onto Lily’s plate.
“Nah, leaving him here to hold the fort, he’s gonna run some laps of the kitchen with scissors then play with matches; got him a new box just for the occasion,” Harry deadpanned. “Of course he’s coming! Where else would he be‽”
“Fuck off, Potter.” He elbowed him gently in his side, then turned serious again. “You sure? He’s not...mine.”
“Was just doing my job, Potter.”
Harry reached for a baby wipe but Lily was quicker, smearing the strawberry that hadn’t made it into her mouth on her dad’s knee. He waved it away with a quick wandless Tergeo. “So,” said Harry, with a lazy grin, “which one do you reckon he’s trying to float?”
“I think they're jumping on the bed.”
“Sorry,” Draco said in almost a whisper so as not to wake the kid, “busy day, Obliviator emergency. Accidental magic at a muggle shopping centre.”
As he took another sip of his Bloody Mary, Potter and the Weaselette appeared at the table. The She-Weasel plonked herself down in the chair next to Pansy with a Wotcher.
” He pulled off his boxers and dropped them next to his joggers in a pile on the floor. “Don’t you have an early shift in the morning?” he asked, climbing into bed and crawling on top of Draco. Draco spread his legs to let Harry slide easily between them; he trailed a row of kisses along Draco’s collarbone, deliberately letting his stubble tickle one of Draco’s many sensitive spots.
Harry let out a little laugh, “Vividly. Thought you were going to turn tail and never speak to me again.”
“Since when do we share brunch? This better not be another one of your fuck-of-the-months. They’re not welcome to Saturday afternoon tea and they’re sure as shit not welcome to Sunday brunch. Thanks Yves,” he took a sip of the Bloody Mary that had just been served. “Have some fucking decorum, Parks.”
Harry shut him up with a quick hard kiss. “I know. I also know they both hate tom kha, so you know what that means?” he asked as he got up and grabbed for the bag of take-away. “They’ll be sharing your pad thai."
“Was what too much?”
“Really?” Harry asks, almost in disbelief.
“I appreciate the audacity, Ted, I really do, but if Harry says no, what makes you think I’m going to say yes?”
She blew him a kiss, “I was curious as to how much alcohol he needed to admit to it. How was he, Draco? Is the The Chosen One any good at sucking cock?”
“Can’t lie,” Draco confessed, “it was a distinct possibility. Not planning a repeat are you, Potter?”
“Same as usual?”
“And just how drunk did you need to get him?”
“Sorry,” he mouthed, “I should’ve realised. Is he okay?”
‘unavailable’, keeping a couple Legilimens on call, making sure the teabags didn’t run out in the staff kitchen, more filing; the important stuff. As glamorous as it wasn’t, Draco was good at it and, Merlin forfend, he enjoyed it — but he’d be damned if he’d ever admit that.
Pansy gave a slight shake of her head, “Hush now, I’ll get back to you in a minute, Harry. Draco,” she turned full force to face him, “perfectly adequate?” One raised eyebrow disappeared under her fringe.
Harry misses what causes Malfoy’s eyes to roll back but from the accompanying whine he knew it must’ve been good. “Fuck it,” he concedes working his hand under his waistband and into his boxers. He’s already half hard and falls quickly into his usual rhythm. He tries to focus on the clouds, tries not to take a peek at Malfoy but he can’t. He snatches glances, but when he hears Malfoy’s breathless little pants crescendo, he can’t tear himself away and lets his gaze linger while Malfoy comes: eyes closed, lips parted, and a damp patch spreading across his trousers.
They both pulled their mobiles from their pockets, eleven missed calls and nine voicemails between them. Dinner was over.
“Hi,” Harry replied softly, as he pulled off his joggers, “thought you were asleep.”
“So Harry, I can call you, Harry, yes?” she asked, sharply saccharine. “We’re all dying to know, how good a fuck is our dear Draco?”
They both froze for a second, hoping that they hadn’t heard what they definitely had.
“Six,” he promised.
“Did he reciprocate, Harry?”
“Arthur!” Harry shouted across the lawn, “Would you mind showing Draco your microwaves? He’s never even seen one before, can you believe that‽”
him.” It wasn't a question.
“Can’t, door’s locked.”
Over by the shed, Harry shuffled a step closer to Draco, letting his arm slide comfortably around his waist. “Seems everyone’s busy.”
to be, doesn’t mean I
“Your dad’s sleeping,” Harry said softly, “but I’m here. Can I help you get cleaned up?”
“I’ll see you at six?” Harry asked as Draco buzzed around the kitchen eating breakfast, packing lunch, catching the cereal Lily was adamant belonged on the floor, and throwing a cleaning spell at the dishes in the sink for good measure. The microwave beeped and he opened the door, sending James’ Ready Brek to the table with a Leviosa; Albus grabbed a spoonful of it before the bowl hit the table. Behind them the hands of the clock on the wall started spinning wildly; Draco rested a hand on James’ shoulder and the hands slowed back to normal.
“You do make a valid point, love,” Draco agreed. “Remind me to send the Weasel a thank you note.”
“Better you than me.”
The mid-morning Sunday sun shone a fraction too brightly against Coquin’s immaculately white starched tablecloths for Draco’s taste. Sunday brunch at Coquin was the staple of any self-respecting gentleman – just as much as Saturday nights at Indigo were, and how the former hadn’t made allowances for its most lucrative clientele, Draco simply couldn’t tell. After all, the hungover beau monde are always the best tippers, and he should know he was here every week. The maître d’ – Yves, who was always just the right side of attentive – led him through the restaurant to where Pansy, the wench, was seated in the sun-filled conservatory. He ordered a Bloody Mary and an Americano, please and thank you, as he took his seat across the table.
Scorpius nodded slowly and took Harry's proffered hand. In the bathroom, Harry made quick work of filling this bath while Scorpius undressed. In minutes he was clean, dry, and wrapped in a fluffy towel. “Do you need to go to the toilet?” Harry asked.
Draco and Harry get roomed together, and although they're not too keen, maybe it'll work out fine?
“Let me finish what I was saying outside.” Draco put a hand gently on Harry's arm and he could feel it burn where he touched him. Harry couldn’t remember the last time someone touched him, not with real any real emotion
“HARRY, COME O-” she stops abruptly as I wrench the door open. “uh, Malfoy, sorry I didn’t realise, er…”
‘Don’t be, I’m just glad you’re awake Draco’. He puffs his cheeks as he slumps back down on his own bed. ‘You were screaming blue murder for about ten minutes and then you just stopped. You started whispering and rocking back and forth.’
“Neither of you have any idea what it’s like to be used
“Calm down, I’m eating!” Harry berated him, with a grin as Draco looked over at Harry for the hundreth time. Harry relaxed, biting in to his own frog.
“He’s been to hell and back Pans,” Zabini cast a sideways look at Harry, “give him a break”
. The thestrals seem delighted at their new-found fame, snickering and lipping the various treats out of various hands, but all Harry can think about is the fact that, when he could see them? He was one of few. He had relied on
Harry knows he was only joking, but for some reason he really couldn't lift his shirt up.

“We sent you loads of owls, Harry. And you never replied. Not once.” Hermione is more sad than angry.
“Eighth years!” Professor McGonagall looked down from on high as she addressed the motley crew of eighth year returnees. “As you may well have noticed, there are so few of you this year, that I have taken the decision to merge the houses for your final year. This means you will be placed in to rooms of two this year.” Her last few words were swallowed by a sudden outbreak of muttering.
‘Do you want to talk about it, Ma-Draco?’ His voice falters and I feel myself cringe at the way he’s tiptoeing around the subject. After all he just had to wake an old deatheater up from a fucking nasty nightmare, in the middle of the night, god knows I’d be scared.
Something under Draco's bed caught his eye, it was rounded and a dark blue colour covered in stickers from different countries, conventions, fragile stickers that muggles used on their post and wizard stickers twinkling and moving around.
Finally it's chapter 4!!
‘Fuck sakes Potter!’ Draco’s words are slurred as he raises his head. ‘what’s with the open window? Its September? Do you want me to freeze to death?’ he slides out of bed and promptly slams the window shut. I’m reminded of Pansy as he slinks back in to bed and buries his head under the duvet.
‘can I, I mean…would it be ok…ok if I sat with you again?’ I stumble over my words, cursing my complete lack of eloquence in the face of the three impeccably turned out pure-bloods in front of me.
Draco was laughing uncontrollably, shaking his head and wiping the tears out of his eyes.
“I asked you not to” He forced out.
Instead he hugs Harry. Draco Malfoy. Hard. Not a cursory sorry-for-that hug but a real I’m-here-for-you hug. And honestly? That was what he really needed. He pulls away and looks Harry in the eye.
“You’re right” It’s practically a whisper. “You’re right, I didn’t need four months.”
“oh, yeah true!” In his eagerness to start a conversation Harry had missed their trunks and uniform laid out next to the beds already. The fake cheerfulness in his voice made him cringe, and he shook his head as through trying to shake something off. Draco flopped down face first on to his bed, eyes shut.
”, but he only feels like he can stand it and that his heart isn’t going to beat out of his chest when Draco grabs his hand. Tucks it against his chest. Drops his head onto Harry’s shoulder.
Harry looks away, removes a hand from Draco’s waist to rub at his eyes. “Yeah, I guess. We were going there anyway, it felt. I don’t know. Right?”
“That is
“That’s not true.” Neville says, eyes lost on something in the distance. “I remember feeling pretty content with Ron’s 21

“Figure out what’s happening here? You-” but Harry’s stopped in the middle of his words, that were pretty much forced out of him without his control, by Draco’s wordless
Draco’s not even stopping to appreciate the waving portrait of his great, great uncle riding a horse in dressage or all of their shoes at the front door. He’s just slipping his off and leaving them right there. Almost
Harry stops wide eyed as Draco snatches the phone out of hand. “I thought-”
So, they complete their rounds – visit Teddy, collect their groceries from the market down the road from Andromeda’s, trail through the surrounding suburbs from the market and point out houses they both like. It’s slightly bittersweet. They have their paused conversation hanging over head, and Harry is getting very close to getting a knife and cutting it out of the air so it hits them. He’s just worried that doing so might cause too much of a break. He doesn’t want to go without these mornings. He says nothing.

“You keep
“You wouldn’t.”
She sends her eyes to the ceiling. “Pretty much everyone I talked to.”
He nods.
And then Draco decides to rub it in further by singing along.
"He doesn't," Draco counters, rising up on his knees. "What he does have is the strange Potter-nurtured ability to turn up when is most inconvenient!"
Luna smiles gently. “Well, if Daddy were to pass on, then I’m sure you’d come out on top of that bet Draco.”
, but by God right at this point Harry thinks he can taste it all, their future, their tentative little chance at the future right on the tips of their tongues, right where he’s wrapping his around Draco’s, right where Draco’s is pushing further and further into Harry’s.
Harry glares in mock annoyance. He takes the piece of paper out of her hands – it has what must be her writing. Large, bubbly numbers and letters, in an order that has no meaning to him.
