“Right. Yeah…” Draco took his wand out of his pocket and summoned a wine glass from the kitchen. He grabbed the bottle of wine on the coffee table and poured it into his glass.
believe you. That’s… That’s what I wanted to say,” Harry said with an earnestness that even he was surprised by.
“No, no, you’re right,” Hermione said to Harry. “We’re going out for drinks next weekend with Neville and Luna, right? You should invite him.”
“Alright, I’ll go get us some crisps. Do you want a beer?”
“Squib,” Harry corrected. “His parents were book collectors who travelled a lot. He moved here from the States three years ago,” he continued, gesturing for Malfoy to follow him. “Anyway, yeah, I think we have that one.”
Draco Malfoy appeared at the doorway.
“Three years of Auror training… You’d think some of those courses would be dedicated to teaching those arseholes to be decent to other human beings.”
“He’s still asleep in my room. Said he loved his new room but didn’t want to sleep in it until it was completely finished,” Harry said, laughing.
Harry laughed, shaking his head. “Maybe you should have resigned with me, mate.”
“Oh, come on, mate. You know ‘Mione and I want to give you all the space you need.”
“There’s a reason it took us almost two weeks just to paint the walls,” Draco quipped without looking back, but he could hear Potter groan as soon as he said it.
“Doing what?”
Harry felt a tug in his chest. He really did miss talking to Ron and Hermione. For a reason he couldn’t quite place, though, he was dreading the thought of responding.
Malfoy looked up and saw that it was Harry. He looked at Harry in bewilderment, and then proceeded to glance around the bookshop as if checking if he was in the right place.
“I heard you.” Draco took a deep breath. “Fine. Grab my arm.”
Malfoy’s hair was still combed back, but there were a few blonde strands that fell out of place. He was wearing the same outfit that Harry distinctly remembered from when Malfoy stopped by at the bookshop the day before. Now uncharacteristically wrinkled. And, on his neck, something speckled and shiny gleamed.
“Quite a bit. She really wants us to be friends.”
Harry got up and was ready to go to the kitchen when Malfoy added, “I can get it.”
“And if they don’t?”
“I’m sorry. Did I make it weird?”
In which Draco realizes that he's in too deep, and Harry is NOT making things any easier.
“Wanna sleep in my room tonight?”
With furrowed brows, he nodded. “Oh...Thanks!”
He groaned and flopped back onto her bed.
Hermione put a hand on his shoulder. “Ron…”
“Anything for Teddy,” Malfoy said behind him.
“So…” Hermione started.
He couldn’t take his eyes off him. Potter looked different. His hair was longer and curlier, as if he had stopped attempting to brush it or have it cut. He had also grown a stubble. He wasn’t even skinny and lanky anymore. The hoodie he was wearing would’ve been baggy on him three years ago, but he’s put on some muscle since then. Not being on the run anymore and three years of non-stop Auror training would do that to you, Draco supposed.
“That’s good. You’d be good together,” his mom said nonchalantly as she opened up her book again.
Narrowing his eyes, he cocked his head to the side. “
Potter, shirtless and wearing a rather fitted pair of exercise shorts, was doing press-ups with Teddy sitting on his back and laughing.
Most of Sirius’ belongings must have been at Harry’s grandparents’ house from when Sirius had run away from Grimmauld Place or the flat he had lived in with Remus before he was sent to Azkaban. Harry realized he didn’t know where either of those places were.
Her face dropped, and she put her hands on her hips. Harry remembered liking her so much because she seemed like an older, kookier, Muggle version of Andromeda sometimes. “Oh, well that explains things... Well, I’m sorry to hear, kid! But, you know what they say, plenty of fish in the sea and all...Bet you're here for your new girl, eh?”
“I’m still sorry for recommending you that group though,” Andromeda added. “I completely forgot that I heard about that particular one from Draco a few weeks back. Was it really that awkward?”
“And then the wanker - who was completely plastered at that point, mind you - has the
“No, no, it’s alright. You don’t have to-”
There was officially nothing left to do with Teddy’s room. The kid loved it. But here Malfoy was, still coming over like he usually did.
Malfoy’s grin grew. He reached over to Harry’s face, brushing biscuit crumbs off his mouth.
“You really were waiting up for me, weren’t you?”
“Good. That’s...good.” Harry let out a breath, and it felt like he’s been holding it since the evening before.
Malfoy shrugged. “If you can’t be in there alone, I can help.” He stood up, already taking his jacket off.
Harry wanted to say
Harry had found himself feeling relieved at the idea of not having to report to missions for next month before the guilt rushed in. He was the saviour of the wizarding world that everyone put on a pedestal, and here he was, thrilled at the idea of not being expected to protect and save anyone.
“This is the thanks I get for bringing you lunch?”
“You’re being dramatic,” Hermione said to Ron, rolling her eyes. “Malfoy and I aren’t even friends, really.”
A tiny part of Draco knew that ditching Astoria at the club and shagging the first bloke that caught his eye was not the answer to this, but it didn’t matter.
“And I don’t know about the specifics of what you’re talking about… But holding yourself accountable for your mistakes and vowing not to repeat them doesn’t mean you have to torture yourself with them” Draco said. “No one can heal that way.”
“Does that bother you?” Harry asked, a small quiver in voice. “That I’m-”
Draco wanted to punch himself in the face. “Oh, shut up. I was simply wondering what you were doing with all that pent up energy if you aren’t using magic anymore.”
She scrunched up her nose. “I’m sorry. I couldn’t put off checking up on you ‘til the morning. Also, I was a bit concerned. You were gone from eight in the morning to midnight. You’ve never spent that much time out of the house unless it’s for work,” she said with an accusing look on her face.
, then! Not like you left out a pretty fucking important detail, huh?”
-  im
Draco frowned, but let it go, figuring he must just be having a stressful workday.
Losing track of his breathing, it started to shorten. Harry clasped his hands together, shaking and nails scratching at skin, and tried to focus on breathing again. He’s done this before. It’ll pass. Another 10 minutes, he figured miserably as the tightness all over his chest pressed on.
Potter cleared his throat. “Hey, do you want to watch a couple of movies? Today’s sort of been emotionally exhausting, and I feel like if I don’t put something on you’re gonna do whatever it is you and get me to talk more. Also, Ted’s collection is great,” he insisted, standing and walking to a large shelf of tapes next to the telly.
Potter pressed a button and brought the mobile to his ear. “Andromeda? ... What? ...Oh. Oh, no.”
Draco’s heart started speeding up, and with panicked eyes, his head whipped to Astoria who had already opened the box and taken one of the chocolate cupcakes out.
“It’s
It helped that as Harry looked up at him, he saw the Malfoy he had gotten used to. Clothes neat and pressed and hair slicked back.
She winced. “Okay, no, wrong term. Definitely
“Oh, please, you love your job,” Ron pointed out.
we finally finished arranging all the other-”
-thank you so much for the kudos and comments. they motivate to write even when all i want to is just vividly imagine scenes i wanna write lmao
“Thanks, I made sure of it,” Harry said. “Have you eaten? Andromeda left me a week’s worth of food in my fridge again when she picked Teddy up yesterday.”
After his first day of Auror training, Harry found himself repeating the same words in his head.
An older woman - probably the facilitator, Harry figured - craned her neck to take a look at him. She shot him an encouraging smile and waved him over. “Don’t be shy, love. We were just about to begin."
“Yeah?”
“C’mon, let’s get to work then.”
“Well!” Ron exclaims, throwing his hands up. “That explains
“One thing you can taste?”
From where she was curled up on the sofa, she started kicking him lightly. “I’ve caught you and Ginny making out in every room of this house, so you’re not one to talk!”
“Are you alright?”
“Don’t be. I deserved it.”
“You’re a headache.” Malfoy rolled his eyes and turned to the telly, but Harry could see him holding back a grin. “Come on then, let’s finish the blasted movie.”
you forgot that the group you gave me was the same group Draco Malfoy is in?!” Harry was sitting on Andromeda Tonks’ kitchen table the next morning, trying not to be upset at the lack of concern she was showing at the utter strangeness of the situation. “When are you ever even talking to him?!”
ty for reading! im almost done with the next chapter and it will be up before the weekend!
“Fair.”
Harry sighed. “Okay, yes, I do. I always just forget which coat or trouser pockets I leave it in and end up fixating on it too much to get rid of it whenever I do find it.”
Harry grimaced, rubbing his forehead. “Go to your grandmother first, and I’ll tell you when you’re ready for bed.”
“Well, I have to get going,” Potter finally said, mounting the motorbike and starting the engine.
Draco perked up, his brow furrowing at the worry in Potter’s voice. Was something wrong with Andromeda?
“It doesn’t bother me, if that’s what you’re thinking.”
“I know,” he muttered. He took one last look at Malfoy’s face and left.
“I know, but it must be a perk to have free boarding at the castle with your
When Draco downed his drink in one go, his mother peered over her book again. “Are you alright? Have you even had dinner yet?”
Harry sighed. “Don’t.”
A look of realization dawned on Potter’s face. “Merlin. Never mind. Sorry. That was a rather stupid thing to ask.”
Smiling, Malfoy nodded. “Four things you hear?”
“I… I don’t know what to say.”
“Well, maybe if you didn’t keep injuring yourself…” He couldn’t help it. As he spread the paste down Potter’s arms, he met his gaze again. Potter was smiling at him, eyes bright and crinkled at the corners.
Harry tore his eyes away, choking on his tea. He thumped a fist against his chest as he coughed violently.
Then, there was a loud thud as his hand slipped and he fell hard on his shoulder, rolling onto his back.
Hearing his heart pounding in his ears and forcing his arse to stay glued to the chair before he could stand up and bolt out of the room, Harry made a mental note not to listen to Andromeda Tonks again.
“The past few weeks have been pretty fun,” Potter said, his other hand tracing a constellation on the carpet.
Draco nodded, already refilling his glass. “Yes and yes. I just really like this bottle,” he lied.
“Well,
“Wow... Well, you’re a bit of a git, but some of our teachers were too, so you might just fit right in.”
Beaming at her, he squeezed back. “Thanks, ‘Mione.”
“Right. Sorry,” Malfoy mumbled. “This is Astoria. She’s commissioning a painting from Andromeda, so we figured we’d stop by after our shift. Astoria, this is-”
“Shut up, Potter.”
“She would have told me…”
Draco got up and walked over to open it. There were different labelled vials and jars filled with various liquids, powders, and gels sitting on the shelves. After going through a few, he settled for a jar of paste-like substance that he used at the hospital for injuries like this.
“You’ll just...know.”
“Fair.”
“Oh… Okay then. Thanks,” Harry said, slowly nodding. He got up and started leading Malfoy to and up the stairs. “Why are you doing this?”
“Yeah?”
Harry’s eyes shot up. “Huh?”
“Well. I did this time.”
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, obviously caught off guard. His mouth opened and closed a few times as if searching for things to say. Then, his face relaxed, and he smiled. “Well. The feeling is mutual.”
She still looked unconvinced. “... You two are getting along quite a bit, then?”
“Yeah,” he mumbled, only half listening now as he murmured an
“Yeah,” he said. “It also calms me down on bad days…And being in good shape when I’m expected to keep up with a four-year-old all day helps too.”
“Yes, Draco, I am aware of who Harry Potter is.” She hopped off the stool to shake Harry’s hand. “Nice to meet you, Harry. I’ve heard a lot about you from this one,” she said, tilting her head towards Malfoy.
"It changed when I took Teddy here for the first time. He was just a few months old then, but the way he crawled down the halls and filled the rooms with his first laughs made me realize that I could actually have happy memories here. I also figured that you’d prefer that I have the house and turn into something good rather than some stranger who wants to buy it just for the novelty of owning a famous ancestral home."
“We did a brilliant job.” Potter raised his bottle of beer toward Draco, and Draco clinked it together with his.
Effortlessly, Harry turned around to catch one of the bottles in his hand and the bag of crisps in the other as Malfoy fumbled with the other bottle before it fell on the sofa’s cushion.
“Well, up until a few months ago, I was -” Draco cut himself off. “You’re changing the subject.”
Maybe it was the guilt of being absent from their lives most of the year. Maybe it was that they reminded him too much of a time he wanted to forget. Maybe it was just that he he had been this weird recluse for too long and regularly being around his two best friends, who were busy with and thriving at their careers, made him anxious.
He could feel Teddy nod against his shoulder.
“Hello?”
“Accio crisps and beer!”
That was a lie. He remembered that night. He had felt like death, but when he had dropped by the bookshop after his shift to cancel, the way Potter’s eyes had lit up at the sight of Draco just wasn’t something he had enough willpower to walk away from.
“Why are you looking at me like that?”
“I-...I’m glad that all’s good,” Ron said, rubbing the back of his head as he stood on the front porch with Harry as he was about to leave.
“Mhmm. Promised Astoria I’d get breakfast with her early tomorrow before her shift starts.”
“I would, but Andromeda’s dropping Teddy off first thing in the morning. She's meeting with a client, so I can't ask her to come later.”
“Wake Teddy up in a bit, okay?” Harry called over his shoulder cheekily as he walked out of the room, deciding that he’ll be a lot more convincing once he’s cooked food for Malfoy again.
“Come on, Malfoy. Let’s go see if your nephew is already high on all that sugar you just offered him.”
Harry put his hands in his pockets and smiled. “Come on, I’ll walk you out.”
Harry expected the facilitator to speak up, but instead, he heard Malfoy’s voice from across the circle.
“Oh…” Malfoy picked up a scarf from a pile and started to play with the tassels, looking unsure of what to do. “Well… Yeah. I am.”
,” Malfoy repeated.
ridiculously behind when it comes to shit like that. How do
A few dragon stories in, Teddy’s bedroom door opened, and Andromeda stepped in. “Teddy, dear, time for bed. Come, you need to have a bath.”
He shrugged. “I knew the basics growing up because my aunt and uncle would make me cook in the mornings. But I only learned how to cook food that isn’t breakfast from Molly. I was going back and forth the Burrow and Andromeda’s during the first few months after the war ended. When I decided to really live on my own, Molly said she wouldn’t let me unless she was sure I wasn’t going to live off fast food takeaway and microwave meals.”
“Okay, dear, goodnight,” she said, looking up at him and smiling.
“She’s having it the night before her birthday since that’ll be a Friday.” Draco peered at him, noticing him wince a little at that. “Are you sure you’ll be okay? I know it’s more than a month from now, but... She invited a ton of people. It’ll be...a lot.”
Malfoy looked like how he usually did. He was wearing an expensive set of emerald robes with silver trimmings. His hair was slicked back and looked almost stiff. However, on his face, instead of the sneer Harry had gotten used to the past seven years, were soft, scared eyes and a mouth slightly open, as if he was trying to say something but was too afraid to.
has this not come up before!?”
Sirius?”
- yes when i said slow burn i meant Slowwww Burn
“No buts, mister,” she said firmly, hands now on her hips.
Harry opened his mouth, an excuse ready on his tongue:
“I...Er...Yeah,” was all Harry could manage.
Draco figured that Potter must have been a little tipsy too if he was admitting that. “You’re the last person who owes the wizarding world anything.”
Harry smiled, suddenly remembering the first time Ron had tried to call him when Harry was staying at the Dursleys.
“It will happen while you’re there soon enough. I hope I’m there to see you lose it.”
“This is the first one I’ve found without any witches or wizards who ended up recognizing me, Potter. It’s also the only one that doesn’t have any wizarding neighborhoods or shops nearby. Trust me, you’re not going to find another one you can go to anytime soon,” Draco insisted. “There are sessions on Sunday mornings as well, I think I’ll go to those instead. You can keep going to this one.”
Draco grew red. “W-what?”
“Y-yeah, yeah. Like you said. I’m clumsy,” he said, laughing a little but keeping his head down, eyes fixed on his food as they started to eat.
Their friendship was new and strange. He was his nephew’s godfather. Fancying him sounded like too much trouble for Draco.
“Okay, now
“I mean,” Potter continued, “A part of me will always worry that I’ll go on a date with a witch, shag them, and see Rita Skeeter writing about it two days later because she’s got an ‘inside source.’”
Draco laughed, before stepping into the house. “Fine.”
Teddy released Draco and turned to his godfather again. “Are you friends now?”
“I’m building a castle!”
He jumped out of bed and started pacing back and forth the room. Harry had always felt like he had barely got to live his life. How much more his parents? It wasn’t fair.
tw: panic attacks, mentions of abuse, mentions of homophobia
“Alright, darling, but that’s your last glass. You need to be up early tomorrow.”
Harry shrugged and went back to eating his eggs. “Just curious.”
“I...We should talk?” Harry said as soon as Ron shut the door.
He beamed, appreciating how much effort Malfoy was putting into convincing him he would be good at it. “I guess… I just have some stuff to sort out before I can even consider asking her. Like my job at the bookshop, how much I’ll get to see Teddy, and…” Harry trailed off, suddenly feeling like he backed himself up into a corner.
“Is it a gift?”
Harry nodded. “Yeah. I understand.”
Malfoy’s mouth twitched into a smirk. “Feeling better, then?”
It felt like being at the Weasley’s dinner table or at the Great Hall during breakfast before a Quidditch game again.
“But yeah. We’re okay,” Ron made a point of saying, probably sensing Harry’s anxiety.
He fought the urge to slam the door in their faces.
“But anyway, it’s not like my love life is exactly my priority now,” Potter said, shaking his head.
Harry’s eyes darted back to Malfoy’s face again in an instant. “I...Yeah.”
“You literally went mental once trying to prove to us that he was a Death Eater!” Ron’s hands were waving around now, fingers tensed and curled in a claw-like position. “Guess what, Harry? You were right! And now you’re telling me you
“But thank you,” Potter added. He raised his wounded hand. “Not just for this, but also for… I don’t know. Whatever it is you’re doing that makes me want to actually talk about this rubbish. Merlin knows how you do it, but… Thanks.”
He and Andromeda had gotten close. They used to just talk in brief, polite exchanges whenever one of them would drop Teddy off, but in the past year, Andromeda had managed to get past his walls.
“Okay, okay,” Ron mumbled, pressing his fingers to his temples as if that would make it easier for his brain to absorb everything Hermione had said.
“I don’t want you to get hurt.”
They walked down a narrow hallway behind the counter until they were led to a cramped room with a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf on every wall.
“That’s true. Make sure you aren’t dead or anything. With that bloody bike and all.”
He didn’t know if it was from fear or euphoria.
“He always liked the wall of photos in the living room. So, I think he’ll like this too.”
His breathing was staying at a normal pace for once, but every inhale hurt and his throat felt too dry and full.
“Ye- Wait, what?” His head snapped up.
“I always thought that too, but… I thought I knew with Ginny. Obviously, that didn’t work out.”
“Well, alright then.” He gave Harry an encouraging pat on the shoulder before leaving the room and shutting the door behind him.
It was hard to see that the Malfoy who had made his life so much harder during the war was the same person who had just spent his night off cleaning up a room with him and making him believe things were going to be okay. Harry now realized how ridiculous it was that he was so pained about his dad and Sirius being complete tossers at the age of 15.
“It’s nothing. Just don’t be an idiot and forget your wand again,” Draco quipped, hoping Potter couldn’t see how red he was. “Hey, can I ask you something?”
Potter laughed. “Good.”
Harry grabbed another bundle of photos that was hiding underneath the junk. It was more memories that Sirius had captured. Many of them were in Hogwarts. He lingered on a photo of Remus in a brown cardigan, smiling begrudgingly at the camera as he was trying to study. Harry remembered wearing a similar cardigan for the first D.A. meeting. He remembered what his thought process had been back then: if he looked like Remus, he could teach almost as well as him.
Draco walked up the steps, wondering where Potter was. He had told Draco yesterday when they were watching a movie that he should come over because Teddy always asked for him now. Smiling at the thought of his nephew eagerly looking for him, he hastened his pace.
She sighed. “He was...
Harry rolled his eyes, but he could feel his tension easing away. He tended to forget that the war was further into his past than it felt and that forgiveness and perspective were vital aspects of people’s healing that he hasn’t gotten the hang of yet.
“Yeah. I’ve been feeling better lately. A lot better.”
Well, if anything, it made sense to him why Malfoy, out of anything else, out of
Feeling guilty but unsure of what to do in this situation, Harry just kept quiet, trying to get Ron to look at him.
on tumblr. message me if u wanna talk abt the fic!! or if u wanna pressure me to update!! god knows i need it
This resolve only lasted until he found himself getting two orders of takeaway from a Chinese restaurant instead of one and Apparating to Thornton’s Books. The moment Potter had seen him, he had immediately put up the Lunch Break sign on the window and grinned so wide that Draco’s heart felt like combusting.
Malfoy smiled sadly and shook his head. “Yeah, I… I get that. I still hate the person that I lost. But now, being angry at him feels strange. What am I supposed to do with this rage and bitterness now?”
Her name was a mouthful, but calling her anything else didn’t feel right. Her last name was what he used to call Tonks. He didn’t want to call her ‘Dromeda either; that’s what Ted used to call her.
She rolled her eyes fondly. “You were always a difficult customer, kid. Can’t you just point to something for once?”
It was Harry’s third meeting. He hadn’t planned on going today, but the moment Andromeda had picked Teddy up from his place and he was left with an empty house again, he felt the strong urge to go.
“Oh, shut up,” Harry mumbled, trying to keep his hand from trembling in Malfoy’s and thankful that Malfoy was too preoccupied with healing him to notice the effect he was having on Harry.
They continued to eat in comfortable silence, only breaking it to ask the other to pass the sauce or a paper napkin and to fight over the last dumpling. Draco would try to steal a few glances from time to time, but Potter would always meet his gaze, beaming at him, before Draco could look away.
of us had to have some semblance of discipline,” Draco replied, wiping sauce from his mouth with a paper napkin. “Besides, this is actually...not terrible.”
anyway here's 12k words of ur favorite magical boys healing and being in love <3
know about that?”
Draco stopped as he spotted Potter’s bike, realizing he had arrived at the store. He pushed the door open.
“I don’t mean to sound condescending,” Draco hastily added. “I just wanted to make sure because a lot of my patients who grew up in the wizarding world and are old enough to remember the war get them. A lot of them don’t really know what it is, so it makes it harder for them to deal with it.”
Malfoy furrowed his brow, turning the sink off and drying his hands on a towel before turning to Harry. “Go ahead.”
He rubbed his eyes. “I know, I know. I’m sorry.” He walked over to her bed, sitting down.
Draco rolled his eyes, realizing that Andromeda was worrying about him too much again. It’s not that Draco didn’t have any friends. He’s met many new people since he started working at the hospital. It’s just that he just preferred being alone nowadays. “Andro-”
“That’s great, dear,” she cooed. “I didn’t catch you this morning. Did you fall asleep studying your books at Astoria’s again?”
A younger girl that Draco recognized from the reception desk entered the room with a parcel in her hands. “Draco Malfoy?”
He even did all he could to make the place feel smaller and homier. The living room used to take up the entire first floor. With Hermione and Ginny’s help, he had managed to build a kitchen and dining room on the floor as well. The old kitchen and dining room on the ground floor had been converted to makeshift garages where he could work on the bike and park it when he couldn’t leave it outside.
Harry turned to him. “Really?”
Harry huffed in amusement, relieved. “I am?”
“Yeah. I didn’t really know her while we were at Hogwarts, but she also comes from a family of bigots who hate her for trying to be a decent person, so we bonded over that… Are all genuine friendships just based on shared trauma?”
“Different from when I was a Pureblood supremacist who was part of a genocide? I’d hope so.”
Draco stopped laughing immediately, coughing in an attempt to not choke on his food right then and there. Suddenly it felt like his eyes had not seen anything before this: Potter’s broad shoulders. A toned chest, his brown skin speckled with hair. The deep contour of the muscles on his abdomen, so defined he might as well have been flexing. A trail of hair running down his torso and disappearing into his trousers...
“You’re doing whatever it is you do that makes me tell you things I’ve never even said aloud to myself before.”
“That’s not true. I really did believe everything they told me to believe.”
“What do you mean?”
After scanning the paper, she looked up. “This is impressive stuff, Draco.”
“You believe McGonagall’s offer still stands?” Harry wondered out loud.
Astoria put down her makeup, finally turning to him. “Well, if you don’t want to go for it, then there really is just one other option is there?”
Obviously taken aback by Ron’s interest, Malfoy nodded slowly. “Er, I suppose?”
“I can’t finish this. I just can’t. That
“We see enough of each other at work.” Which was right, but he knew his mother had a point. He’d seen Potter five times this week. In between pretending that they were going to work on Teddy’s room and going to support group meetings together, they haven’t really been apart that much since the first time he came over.
There was sauce dripping down from the corner of Potter’s lip. Draco couldn’t help but let his eyes follow the movement of Potter’s tongue as it darted out his mouth to lick it off. He watched Potter’s throat as he swallowed.
“Front page for seven days straight, huh?” Harry asked, breaking the silence. “How many ways could they paraphrase ‘Draco Malfoy is Gay,’ exactly?”
He had heard some things when he and Malfoy both worked at the Ministry, of course. But he had thought that it was petty office gossip. “I… I haven’t read the Daily Prophet in almost four years.”
Andromeda shook his head. “It was an anonymous donation. I think only Kingsley knew. Draco didn’t even want me to know, but I stumbled upon the papers when I was helping Narcissa clean up. ”
” she exclaimed, waving her arms in frustration. “Thought the promotion would mean I get more independence, but I can’t even get funding for the educational reforms and subsidies without sucking up to rich names who think they’re heroes for not being one of the families who were murdering people four years ago. Now, I have to plan a bloody fundraiser so that they can get drunk enough to care a bit more.”
Harry sat on the bed next to him, looking around the room. “I think Sirius would like this room being Teddy’s now.”
“Hey, don’t...” Malfoy whispered.
There was nothing about the day that had been particularly difficult or alarming. It was just one orientation after the other. But, somehow, a nagging feeling that he couldn’t quite shake still clung to him.
Draco tried to play it cool, miserably aware of how fast his heart was beating. “Fancy having a personal Healer, do you?”
He used a towel to wipe off the grease and dirt from his arms. Feeling just how much sweat and grime was clinging to his skin, he wondered if he had time to shower before Malfoy arrived to help him finish Teddy’s room.
- thank you so much for the comments and kudos!!! they rly mean the world to me and always push me to write. im trying to be better at replying faster i swear ksjdfks
he thought to himself.
Knowing Andromeda was safe filled Draco with relief. He hadn’t expected to get along with her. She was almost twice his age after all. But Draco never really had any family that he liked. “Who’s watching Teddy?”
“What? No, that’s-”
Harry smiled and got out of his seat to scoop Teddy up. “Hey kiddo.”
of letters threatening that he’d murder me if he ever got out. As if he ever could. I even learned new slurs I haven’t heard before. His vocabulary was a lot more colorful than I thought,” Malfoy said, letting out a bitter laugh.
“He loves you too. I wasn’t just being polite when I said he talks about you a lot.”
Harry turned to him just to see that Malfoy was already facing him, beaming with a soft look in his eye.
“Ron, do you really think Andromeda and Harry would let
He nodded slowly. "…Yeah. I, er... I wrote her a few weeks after I quit my Auror post. But after she said I was more than welcomed to have the position if I wanted it, I just never wrote her back.”
“Oh, Merlin, no. There was just a dragon pox outbreak in a nearby town that week,” he replied before sipping at his drink and looking Potter in the eye as he relaxed. “I usually don’t even have to work the full eight hours most days because I’m technically just the Potions apprentice. I just stay a little longer if there’s anything the kids’ need.”
“Oh, she’s a magizoologist! She’s sort of been everywhere, but the past year she’s been working on a project in Sweden at the dragon sanctuary. Romania’s next on her-”
Harry closed his eyes, scanning himself for an ounce of regret. He couldn’t find any.
“It doesn’t. Of course not. But that doesn’t mean he isn’t worthy or capable of redemption,” she said. “You know he’s an apprentice at St. Mungos now? That’s why he went back to get his N.E.W.T.s. He specializes in helping Muggle-born kids who get injured from their own magic acting up in dangerous ways before they turn 11. Treating them, orienting the parents and helping them understand, helping the kids cope with their new lives…”
Glancing at a clock on the wall, he wondered where Malfoy was. It was pretty early in the morning. The only reason Harry was awake was because he had been woken by a nightmare he couldn't even remember again. Still, Malfoy was usually on time.
Thinking about what magical abilities Andromeda must have had to convince him to talk to a bunch of strangers about his dead parents, Harry let himself in.
“That’s it? You’re miserable, so instead of talking to your best friends or to me you just disappear? You didn’t even stop by or reach out to us at all at Christmas.”
Malfoy looked up at him. “What?”
“How long?”
“I believe Harry,” Hermione suddenly said, breaking her silence almost in a whisper. Her brows were furrowed, and she started fumbling with the label of the wine bottle, picking at it in the edges.
“That makes sense,” Potter replied. “Wizarding medicine
Draco snorted, but as he did, he knew it was half-hearted. He couldn't ignore that tiny part of him he has been trying to stifle. The part of him that kept thinking that maybe it was possible.
“I’m done for, I think.” Draco leaned against the doorframe of Astoria’s bedroom as she sat in front of her dressing table.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “I thought that just meant that you both met up once a month and wrote each other."
“You should talk to them tomorrow.”
“Can’t believe you don’t know how to use chopsticks,” Potter said as he handed Draco a plastic fork and spoon as they sat on opposite sides of the table in the bookshop’s tiny break room. “How
“So. This is where you keep that...
Astoria raised her eyebrows, obviously feigning surprise. “They are?!”
“I wish I could, but I promised mother I’d spend time with her tomorrow. I guess I haven’t been home that much.”
Harry tried not to run away at the thought of having Ron, Hermione, and Malfoy at the same dinner table. But, he figured that if these were all people he wanted in his life, it was going to have to happen sooner later.
Harry continued to look through the pile. “I thought so. I was so sure of it for a few months. But I’ve changed a lot in the past year, and so has she. I still love her, but I can’t imagine going back to loving her
It felt like there was just an unspoken agreement hanging in the air between them to just keep doing what they were doing, to keep seeing each other as much as they had been. Harry wasn’t about to complain.
Standing up, Harry clapped his hands. “Anyway, I’m going to make us lunch.”
This girl, however, was undoubtedly a Muggle. She had entered the store talking on her mobile and was wearing a jumper with a university logo on it.
Malfoy groaned. “Okay,
Astoria, who was sitting on the other side of the brewing table Draco was working on, shrieked in joy and threw her arms up. “
“Yeah, yeah… I guess."
So, coming out a year after his father was sent to Azkaban wasn’t as hard of a decision as he had always thought it would be. With most of wizarding society already hating him, he had figured that this would make little difference to his life. Draco had shrugged off every insulting headline and intrusive candid photo that made its way to the pages of the Daily Prophet each time he was seen with a new bloke. It hasn’t mattered to him in a long time.
“Is this okay?” Potter asked.
take a good look at Malfoy for the first time today.
“You know, you used to never get this flustered when I teased you about boys,” she said, leaning over and propping herself up on her elbows. “When you told me you two started hanging out and that you just had a tiny crush on him, I believed you. But now…This dreamy look when you space out...Spending practically whole weeks with the bloke...”
Potter sighed and picked up the shard. Carefully, this time. He rubbed his thumb against the surface before putting back into his pocket. “Nothing. Nevermind.”
“I never knew him, but I’m sure he would.”
"I don't think she meant to. She was musing on how two people from the same class - me and Longbottom - were going to be part of the faculty together. Then, she mentioned you saying you were interested."
Hermione made a noise of protest, but Harry cut her off.
“Bit ironic, isn’t it?” Draco had meant it to be teasing, but as soon as he said it he was immediately scared that it sounded the tiniest bit bitter.
A beat.
Before Draco could decide whether or not to leave the room while he could, the facilitator spoke up. “So, I think we can begin now.”
“Are you coming over tomorrow?” Potter asked.
like Potter. The man had the same glasses and green eyes, the same dark brown skin, the same unkempt hair. Still, it was hard to tell. It had been so long.
Draco smiled. “Yeah. The first months were tough because none of the staff or patients really trusted me… Which is definitely more than fair. But I earned their trust eventually and did quite a good job bonding with the patients, especially the Muggle-born kids… To be honest, it felt selfish at first… Like I was just doing it because of all the guilt. Soon enough, though, I accepted the fact I really do just like helping them and being skilled in something important and good.”
“Yes it was. When he was a child. Before Hogwarts. Before your father and Remus,” she replied. Harry knew she left out Peter on purpose. “I was like that too, then I met Ted and my other friends. We were lucky, Harry. We met good people who helped us grow into ourselves rather than just the people our family was making us become.”
Harry smiled to himself. Maybe it wasn’t so hard to see why he liked being around Malfoy.
Knees and shoulders touching, they sat in silence, admiring their work.
Malfoy nodded, taking out his wand.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “What, not good enough for the Boy Who Lived?”
She looked baffled for a moment, then her eyebrows went up as she realized what he meant. “Oh. Well... It’s not
It must have only lasted a second, but Draco could suddenly feel nothing else but that touch.
There was Astoria and Malfoy egging Andromeda on to tell more embarrassing baby stories of Harry that she had heard from Remus. (
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shrugged. “Some of the kids showed symptoms of it, and I didn’t understand. So, I read some Muggle textbooks about it and worked with some of the few Muggle-born Healers at work. Before that, St. Mungo’s never had a protocol for attacks that some patients get, which was stupid.”
- talk to me abt the fic (or yell at me to update lmao) @ ginnywcasleys on tumblr!
Ron groaned. “...
One look at her still eyes was enough for Harry to be sure she wasn’t actually reading anything.
“I don’t know…” Potter looked away as he brought his glass to his mouth.
His chest suddenly feeling too tight and his throat feeling too dry, he was at a loss for words.
“Before we end, are there any first-timers who would like to share? We always set aside time for any newcomers,” the facilitator asked, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. She was gesturing around the circle, but Draco knew she meant for Potter to speak up. He was the only newcomer today.
Potter’s shoulders relaxed. “Ugh, I know. I really just don’t think I can write her if I don’t know whether I can actually follow through this time. Especially with whatever’s going on with my magic. I can’t disappoint another person.”
When he opened it, Malfoy was waiting for him outside instead of waking Teddy.
Talking over each other, Harry said, “What does that even mean?” as Ron clapped his hands together, muttering, “Oh, sure, babe, that clears things up.”
Harry took the remote and paused the movie. “What?”
Steps creaked behind him, and he turned around. It was Hermione, her coat back on and looking at him apologetically. “I need to make sure he’s okay…”
“Oh, alright,” Potter said, looking disappointed. Or maybe Draco just wanted him to be disappointed and read it that way. He wasn’t sure. “Well, I’ll see you.”
“Why do you keep it then?”
“Why not?”
“The shard… Er… It’s from a mirror that Sirius gave me. I haven’t worn this coat in a while and forgot it was in the pocket. Haven’t thought about it in months. So, when I felt it and accidentally cut myself on it on the way here, I...I sort of…”
Nonetheless, the sadness was there, and he carried it with him every day with the rest of the tangled up emotions he was left with.
She sat up straight, looking him in the eye. “Just because you weren’t meant to end up together doesn’t mean it wasn’t true love at one point. You knew with her, and you’ll know again the next time you’ve got someone worth keeping and loving. Whether it’s with her again or someone else. It’ll just be better this time because you’ll be loving whoever that is as
They took two steps back to look at the wall.
“Ugh, I take everything back. You’re not
Draco looked at Potter.
“One more-!” Malfoy spun around glaring at him. “You say this
Teddy scrunched up his face. “I don’t know yet... But I still have lots of blocks! And I want to make a second castle! Will you help me?”
we might as well attempt to get along.”
Potter shrugged. “I know… It’s just hard to remember that.”
“Oh, no… I spent the night at Andromeda’s to stay with Teddy because she had to keep her nephew company at the Muggle hospital. Minor accident. Everyone’s alright, she said.”
He glared at her. “Why do I tell you things?”
“That’s the thing, though,” Harry replied, looking at the floor. “I feel guilty letting a new person into my life when I’ve been a terrible friend to the people who are already in it. Saying I want space because all this grief is catching up to me is one thing. But saying it and then making space for new people when I can’t even let the friends I already had back into my life is… I feel like I’m being hypocritical.”
The reflection of the warm fluorescent light of the living room in Potter’s green eyes looked like golden specks. The contour of his cheekbones and jaw were more prominent than they had ever been when they were teenagers. His eyelashes were long and dark, brushing against the lens of his glasses.
“Oh, I forgot to ask,” Potter started, mouth half-full of chow mein and finally meeting his eye. “Did you and Andromeda decide on the date for her party? I need to…er...you know, prepare to be around a huge group of wizards for the first time in a while.”
Harry laughed as Astoria was roped into describing every dragon she saw during her visits to her sister.
He tried to raise his arm again, successfully this time, but his face still crumpled up in pain. “A little.”
“Mhmm.”
“Fuck!” Harry dropped his head to the table, burying his face in his arms. “Fuck fuck fuck.”
“Last time I saw you boys together in the same room…”
“Potter.”
“So, you’re turning Sirius’ room into Teddy’s room? That’s a great idea.”
.” It came out muffled as he murmured it into his sleeves.
Malfoy shrugged. “I overheard. The flashbacks. I get them too. All the time. Sometimes it’s when I’m using a particular spell or even when I’m just doing nothing. They’re terrible, aren’t they? Makes me want to avoid most of the places I’ve been in my life just because they might trigger them again. Sometimes you think they’re getting less intense and they start happening further apart, but out of nowhere, they get more vivid again. Bloody nightmare.”
Potions
As soon as Potter said that and smiled at him, the sort of smile no one would deny was kind and light and
“There’s one more person you need to let back into your life.”
Draco gave her a look before returning his attention to the patient chart. He heard her groan.
(See the end of the chapter for
time for lunch.”
Potter scrunched up his nose, and Draco realized he was holding his hand too tight.
"He’s not sick or anything, don’t worry,” Malfoy said, closing his book and putting it aside. “He was just really tired when he got here. Andromeda said she just lost track of time and let him stay up way too late last night."
Harry rolled his eyes. “Oh, fuck you!” he called after him as Ron walked out of the kitchen, chuckling.
He turned around and saw the silver nameplate with
And he did, but he still pointedly avoided Hermione’s gaze.
are my best mates.”
It was chaos. Harry loved it.
“I’m touched.” Draco felt less tense now that Potter was starting to sound like himself again. He released his grasp on Potter’s hand. As their hands brushed when he pulled back, Draco felt something stir in his chest. It was probably nothing.
“Ah, no, not really. Just a bunch of pictures to hang up. M’sorry for still making you come over.”
Harry, sitting across from Hermione at the kitchen table of her and Ron’s new place, poked his friend with his fork. “Hey, ‘Mione…”
Like his weird fascination with how attractive Bill and Charlie were in his teenage years. Or the way his 14-year-old self couldn’t get over how handsome Cedric Diggory was. He probably even had a tiny crush on the barista of the coffee shop he had frequented for the first few months he worked at the Ministry - the place hadn’t been on his way to work and the coffee was terrible.
Potter downed his drink, shaking his head. “No, you just… caught me off guard. But, you’re right. Christ, how do you do that?”
” he asked in a short exhale, eyes still fixed on his. The green lights going off in his head start to fade. He focused on the grey eyes in front of him.
A picture frame on the end table caught Harry’s eye. It was a picture of the three of them with Ginny after her first professional Quidditch game. He remembered how he had felt watching her zoom through the pitch on her broom, her ponytail whipping behind her and the crowd going wild with her name in their mouths. He definitely had been in love with her then. “Yeah.”
, he wanted to add.
“The tone of surprise hurts,” Draco retorted, but he found himself smiling at the comment.
Potter frowned. “...You what? You didn’t tell me that. Why’d you come over anyway?”
“Probably my fault. She’s always worrying about me wanting to be alone all the time.”
Before he could protest, there was a loud
Harry could tell that Malfoy was already screening dozens of excuses in his head. "Asking was just a formality, by the way. Hermione is sort of demanding you be there. So that they can, you know. Make an effort to be friends with you too."
She beamed at him, her eyes lighting up. “Darling, you’re home.”
“Your father knew?”
“Sod off. I just didn’t hear you coming in.”
He had decorated it the way he wanted to: something more modern and sleek after years of living in a manor crowded with ancient artifacts and tacky heirlooms. He had brought a string of one-night-stands home, feeling more thrilled by the thought that there was no one else home to judge who he fucked than by the meaningless sex itself. Draco had even taken pleasure in doing mundane things alone like laundry and cooking, sort of as a quiet celebration of his normalcy.
“And the...The white wall behind you. And the crayon mark Teddy made,” he said, more clearly now. “I see… The rim of my glasses. And the railing of the staircase. That’s five.”
find somebody to be gross with.”
It was the first time he had mentioned his friends, and Draco didn’t know what to say. Andromeda had told him Potter wasn’t really seeing them as much anymore. Even Potter had mentioned it in the meetings. “Can hardly imagine Weasley handling a baby.”
“This alright?” he breathed out as he buried himself deep into the man beneath him, who was gasping and looking up at him through lidded eyes.
“Not as much now, but yeah. I mean, all the flashbacks and anxiety… Obviously, it’s because we all went through fucked up shit. But it’s also because I’m terrified of who I had to be as a kid. And terrified because people still see me that way. Sometimes, I still feel like every bloody decision I make that doesn’t align perfectly with who the world still expects to be can mean life or death like it did during the war.
“It’s actually a lot cleaner than I anticipated,” Malfoy said, taking a swig out of his beer that Harry hadn’t noticed he had brought with him.
obvious. I just haven’t seen your face light up like that when you talk about someone since Ginny. And you have been so relaxed and happy lately. I know it’s not all Draco, it’s also you putting in the work. But between yesterday and everything you just told us, it just sort of...clicked?”
Draco made his way to the living room and plopped down on the sofa, placing his wand on the coffee table. He thought of turning on the telly because there must be no way either him or Potter could hold a conversation for more than five minutes before it got awkward. Then, he realized he couldn’t even remember how to turn the thing on.
“Just shag the bloke already. Merlin.”
girlfriends.”
Harry leaned against the counter next to sink, chewing as he watched Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyes were narrowed in concentration, a few small creases appearing on his forehead, and his bottom lip was curled between his teeth. Harry wondered if Malfoy was aware that he bit his lip when he was focusing on something. He also wondered why he couldn’t look away.
Potter turned around, confusion on his face, as Draco walked up to him. “I haven’t heard that in years.”
Maybe it was just that Harry hadn’t really made any new friends in the past few years. That was it, right?
,” Potter started.
“Hey, look,” Malfoy said, breaking the silence. He reached over to hand Harry a worn-out photo. “For a minute, I thought it was you and Weasley.”
Raising her eyebrows, she leaned back on her counter and crossed her arms. “Yes. He’s my cousin, remember? That means I knew him even back when he was still an infuriating little twat going around during family dinners, bragging about how he would
She trailed off. Draco knew what she had meant to say, but they don’t really talk about the trials much.
“That’s true… When was this?”
lost many people,” he continued. “But it’s been years. My parents died when I was a baby. So, I was raised in an abusive home without an actual family. In my teens, I met new people I could call family. They took care of me. A couple of them were my parents’ best friends… But they… Er… I also lost them… Most of them within a few years of me even knowing they existed.
“Potter isn’t even sure he’s going to try for the job next year,” Draco said, feeling the burn in his cheeks as he returned his attention to the potion he was starting. “And even if he was, he is
Harry heard his fridge and cupboard open and close, and within seconds, a bag of crisps and two bottles of beer came zooming to them.
The last person I lost died around four years ago. So, it’s strange doing this, seeking support and everything, now. I lived a pretty hectic life. For a long time, a lot of people depended on me to be someone I was never ready to be. So, I became that person. It was only last year when I decided that… That I felt like I could step back. For the first time, I felt like I could take some time for myself without the world - or, er, the people around me, I mean - going up in flames.
Harry put down the box. “Yeah. Andromeda came over to drop Teddy off, and she ended up helping me out a bit with the stuff I got for the room.”
“Yeah, yeah,” waving her hand in dismissal of Draco’s attempt to be modest. “I just forget how advanced the things you deal with are. I mean, the older trainee Healers told me your apprenticeship was supposed to just involve following a bunch of instructions from pages Healers tell you to look up. And you’re here creating your own potions and improving the ones they’ve been using for years. That’s bloody impressive.”
Harry wanted to tell Ron that it was okay. That he has been pretty terrible at being a friend lately. But Ron sounded tired, and he knew that Ron would stay on the line for hours convincing Harry that he did nothing wrong. So, Harry didn’t argue. “Anyway, I should really go now. I have work tomorrow.”
Besides, in Muggle groups, no one would recognize him.
“Do you want to split it? I was about to take a lunch break. We could eat it in the break room.”
when Lucius had caught him looking at a bloke a certain way for a few seconds too long.
“Tell you what?”
Malfoy turned the doorknob and stepped in, Harry following closely behind him. He stopped, looking around the room. “Oh, wow.”
“Draco?”
“I, er....” Harry gave up before even saying anything. This was all too strange, and he hated it.
guilty about sitting this one out.
There was a clatter.
“Brilliant!” Harry matched his enthusiasm, which wasn’t hard. Teddy’s joy was always some degree of contagious no matter what he was talking about. “How tall is it going to be? Dragons can fly pretty high.”
It was both, Harry decided.
Harry was about to stand up to take the tape out of the player when Malfoy pointed to the big cans of paint at the corner of the room and asked, “What are those for?”
“Yeah,” Draco mumbled, turning around and walking towards the door.
“Psh… He deserves it.”
He sipped his wine as he thought about how this shouldn’t be such a big deal. Maybe he was just overthinking it.
Ron nodded. “That’s her home number. Writing her is a nightmare now. She always loses our letters.”
“Ah, so she’s been giving you the same ‘you two have so much more in common than you think and should be friends’ spiel as well?”
Draco looked around Andromeda’s house as he hung up his coat. He’d been here many times before, but it suddenly felt different with Potter there.
Shrugging, she looked back and forth between the boys. “I mean, we were already okay. We just haven’t really been actually talking about this.”
Harry shook his head. “I’m… I’m sorry, Gin. I just...Everything is still so overwhelming. I’m just so bloody terrified of everything that could remind me of all of it.”
Harry felt his anxiety ebb away as he tried not to laugh, handing the gift to Ron anyway. “They’re apology flowers! Besides, you two keep forgetting to replace the dead plant on your coffee table.”
"So, how was it?"
Potter turned back to him with a tape in his hand. “Muggle films. They’re like… stories but -”
As he watched Potter grin and slowly get back up on his feet, the tiny bit of hope Draco now had - hope that maybe Potter could feel the same way - felt like subtle discomfort. Like a whisper at the back of his head begging him to stop this delusion. Like a slow, quiet ache.
“Right.”
The four-year-old nodded, tears streaming down his cheeks, before burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck.
” Harry snickered. “This was almost worse than when we were deciding what kind of blue to paint the walls.”
“He is!” Harry insisted, chuckling at the disgust on their faces. “Still a bit uptight, yeah, but he’s funny. And interesting. And he’s really good with Teddy.”
“Shut up.”
Then, watching hurt flash in Ron’s eyes, he realized: Ron was doing the math in his head, and now knows that Harry started spending time with Malfoy before he even returned any of Ron’s letters.
“You two would be good friends,” she clarified, her eyes not leaving the pages of her book. “And it would be good for Teddy.”
“I’ll be back, yeah?”
This has been the new norm that they had settled into for the past three weeks. He had never thought that he and Potter could ever be mates before, and now here he was, spending his weekends - and sometimes even weekday nights, straight from work - helping him remodel a room and getting lost in banters and quips and teasing.
Teddy’s eyes widened before he rushed out of the room.
Harry scanned the books that were eye-level to him, his fingers brushing the spines. He stopped at a thick, leather-bound book with the title embossed on it in gold. He slid the book out, heavy in his hands, and turned around to give it to Malfoy.
“I wouldn’t stay up until midnight multiple times talking about my deepest fears and desires with a bloke if I thought he was ‘just fit.’ You are definitely in too deep, my friend.”
else, would be the one to finally open Harry’s eyes to a truth that had been there all his life.
But, skin crawling and pulse still rising, he sat back down anyway.
“That’s fair.”
The shelves were now filled with storybooks, photo albums, and toys. On the desk were his coloring books, crayons, and a framed picture of Teddy and Andromeda laughing. The curtains of the bay window were hung up, patterned with cartoon dragons in different colors.
Hermione, who was sitting cross-legged next to Harry on the sofa, groaned. “I know you’re joking, but don’t give him any ideas. I don’t like the thought of working at the Ministry without either of you.”
Ron put down his glass of water with a thud. “
“Oh... Well, McGonagall wouldn’t let them touch you if she thought you were doing a great job, Malfoy.”
Draco felt a lurch in his stomach. “It does.”
The idea of spending more time with Potter should sound excruciating to him, but so far, it has felt… good. And he found himself thinking that he actually did want to keep doing it.
Draco turned back to Potter and crouched down to help.
“Don’t you have work early tomorrow?”
After the meeting, as Draco was exiting the building, he saw Potter a few yards away from him standing next to a motorbike. He felt weird, having heard all that from him today. He would bet that Potter wouldn’t have said all that with Draco in the room if he hadn’t been desperate for support and recovery.
“Ted, you’re awake. Are you okay?”
After staying like that for a while, Teddy’s hair slowly turned back to its usual turquoise. Harry relaxed and stood up to change.
Malfoy then coughed and dropped Harry’s hand. “Sorry, I’m just… A bit sleepy, I think.”
Before he could change his mind, he handed it to Malfoy.
Harry just stared at him, unnerved at how Malfoy had just stood there casually, describing the past eight months of Harry’s life with startling accuracy like it was no big deal. “It’s… It’s nothing, Malfoy.”
“Are you sure?” he asked, a concerned look on his face.
Potter straightened, eyes now alert. He pulled out a small, rectangular contraption with buttons on it. It was a mobile phone. Draco recognized it as soon as he got a clear view. More and more of his Muggle-born and Half-Blood patients were starting to have them.
“Are you alright?” he repeated.
“I was looking for this old Potions book,”  Malfoy said, straightening. “But now that I’m here…” he murmured, gesturing to the shelves and shelves of Muggle books.
He looked at the room dreamily. “That way he won’t have to carry his stuff back and forth!”
They sat there, not saying anything for a few minutes. Harry traced the wood grain pattern of the kitchen table, hyperaware of the relentless thrumming of his nerves. Hermione had gotten her book back from him, but it just laid open before her. He knew she was stealing apprehensive glances at him every seven seconds.
- talk to me abt the fic or just hp in general/yell at me to update when it's been too long/etc etc on tumblr! im @ginnywcasleys :)
Harry tried. But his eyes kept drifting off to the side to fixate on a blank spot in the wall, little bits of memories sparking in his brain again.
“He also told me about the good things you did. He said…He said you were like the heroes in the storybooks Aunt ‘Mione gave me,” he said, struggling more than usual with some of the r sounds of the words he said now that he was drifting off.
Potter smirked. “He’s actually good with Teddy. Didn’t even drop him the first time all of Teddy’s nails turned into claws.”
Which is why Draco Malfoy had been going to these meetings for a few weeks now. It was hard to participate at first because how exactly was he supposed to talk to Muggles about experiencing abuse for 10 years to the point that he was coerced to be a pawn in a magical genocide? Then, he realized many of the people in the group were grieving people who weren’t particularly saints either. That many of them were also angry or conflicted.
She shook her head and finished the last of her wine before standing up. She ruffled his hair as she passed him. “Alright, darling. Like I said, just be careful.”
“I mean I’m not happy about it. But if he’s your friend now...Then fine. As long as he doesn’t fucking try anything.” He turns to Hermione. “And as long as you’re not saying it’s okay just because you feel like you owe him for his help. Which is the
“You don’t carry your wand with you anymore. You ride that death trap of a bike everywhere instead of Apparating. You’re out of breath from cleaning and moving furniture around because you did all this without magic,” Malfoy listed off, gesturing around the room to punctuate his last point.
“My dear aunt here wouldn’t let us leave before force-feeding us, so…”
“What? Didn’t you just come from -” The sentence died in Harry’s mouth as he turned around to
Draco snorted. “Ah, well, I don’t think we ever figured out how to properly greet each other.”
He and his team had finally found the last of the Death Eaters who had managed to flee back in 1998. Dolohov.
“Yeah, pretty much.”
“Yeah, definitely.”
“Oh. Thanks.”
Malfoy chuckled, leaning against the counter. “Ouch.”
“It’s alright. You’re doing better than Malfoy. In the past month, he’s probably already told Teddy about each time I got in trouble back in school,” Harry said, starting to gather the loose blocks on the floor.
“I… Sorry,” Draco murmured, as he looked down at his glass. It was only now that he realized how much he’d been sipping it since they had started talking. His drink was gone.
Still, he was better. Sort of.

“Malfoy.”
“What do you mean?”
Before Andromeda could reply, they saw Teddy’s head peeking out from the kitchen doorway. “You said Uncle Dwaco?” the boy asked, yawning and still clutching the stuffed puppy he slept with every night.
Ron looked guilty. “Yes. We were sort of waiting to tell you. Sorry”
Draco Malfoy didn’t have a good childhood. In the public, Lucius had been a doting father who was proud of his son. It was never like that whenever his family was behind closed doors or beyond everyone else’s earshot.
“Right.”
“So, who is it?”
“Okay.”
“Oh, er, sort of…”
“You told him
, Astoria had said earlier at the club as she slipped him a condom.
He walked into the room to see Malfoy doing the dishes. Harry leaned against the entryway of the kitchen, just watching him. His blond hair was slightly disheveled, a few strands falling to his face. The sleeves of his button-down shirt were rolled up to his elbows, and the topmost buttons were unfastened. Harry swallowed hard.
“Oh, er… I don’t know....”
Harry grinned. “Oh, yeah, definitely.”
“Harry… I’m glad you called.”
Harry shook his head before hopping off the table, trying to gauge whether or not she was joking. “You’re killing me, Andromeda.”
“Mother? I’m home!” Draco called out as he closed the door behind him.
” Malfoy grabbed his face with both hands gently, keeping his head still. And there they were. Those grey eyes. Soft, brown lashes. Worried crease in the brow. “Hey…You’re
Potter laughed, his eyes gleaming in the moonlight.

“Including me,” she muttered, looking up at Harry. “So, what now?”
“...”
“If you say so.” Draco took a sip, and his throat instantly felt like it was on fire, but the burn felt good.
Ron gave him a small smile. “I know, mate. And we believe you. I mean, you
He knew that he could no longer pretend that he didn’t know what this feeling was. And he felt like screaming or crying or laughing or
Harry sighed, looking down at the hem of his shirt that he started to fumble with. “I’m trying to.”
Harry rubbed the heel of his palm against his forehead, closing his eyes for a bit. “Look, he’s Teddy’s uncle. We were bound to cross paths and be in each other’s lives eventually! Besides, he’s been...He’s actually been really good for him.”
Harry followed Malfoy’s gaze to see the edges of his nails bleeding slightly. It was only then that he realized he’d been picking at the skin around it. “Oh. Yeah, I just-”
“And you’re not getting attacks anymore?”
Draco traced the edges of the card.
“Why?”

Draco was about to ask what, exactly, were microwave meals, but decided he was more interested in the fond look on Potter’s face. “D’you miss them? The Weasleys?”
“Well, I am following the man who bullied students and the man who collected them like trophies. The bar isn’t set that high.”
“I would have come over for less,” Malfoy says, already crouching down to take the first frame out of the box.
He didn’t know if it was because, lately, he had been getting less comfortable with the silence he had been subjecting himself to for the past year or so. Or because he had taken another look at Ron’s letter again and panicked. Maybe it was both.
He wanted to play dumb, but his mother’s knowing stare was too much. “It’s not like that.”
Andromeda laughed, enjoying the bewilderment on Harry’s face too much for his liking.
“Can’t make any promises, Potter."
As if sensing being watched, Malfoy turned to him.
“You’re a great person to have around, you know that?” Potter suddenly asked, out of nowhere.
Harry frowned. “Reckon it’ll be a problem? I know McGonagall and the other teachers can be old school sometimes, but there’s no way-”
Harry nodded.
Which is why she had managed to convince him to go to a Muggle grief support group. She had told him that Ted, her Muggle-born husband, used to go some throughout the years because of the friends they lost in the First War.
Harry fiddled with the cuffs of his jumper, feeling paralyzed by how much sense she was making. “...You practiced that speech, didn’t you?”
Draco kissed her on the cheek. “Were you waiting up for me?” He pulled up a stool and sat next to her.
"It's not nothing. That was...Er…It’s really cool of you,” Harry managed, not knowing how else to convey how in awe he is of every new thing he has learned about him these past few months without giving too much away.
“Does it still hurt?” Draco asked, scooting closer to him. Their knees were touching now, but he found that he didn’t really mind.
Draco looked at Potter questioningly, but Potter ignored him and sat on Teddy’s other side.
“That mirror…” Potter continued. “It could have saved him, you know.”
“Oh, no, don’t worry, dear. I’m having a horrid migraine. I just drank what was left of the potion you made for me yesterday. I was waiting until it took effect before I went back to bed.”
He grabbed it and returned to Potter’s side, sitting back on his heels and unscrewing the lid off the jar. He dipped his fingers in to get a dollop of the paste and brought it to Potter’s shoulder, slowly spreading it throughout that area.
right now, though. One 22-year-old with war trauma at a time, please."
Malfoy was the first one to notice Harry. He looked up from the glass of wine he was drinking and smiled at the sight of him.
Sighing, Ron slumped back into his seat. “I know, I know.” He squints at Harry. “But one step out of line from him and you’re not allowed to hold me back while I hex him.”
“I never really gave you two an actual, full apology,” he continued. “And this is...what, a year late? But saying it now is as good as I can do at this point. So, I’m sorry. I'm sorry that I just disappeared, and that you didn't hear from me for months. I just...I spiraled into a terrible episode and the sick comfort I felt when I was alone and away from the rest of the world just got out of hand…”
Snorting, Harry shook his head. “It’s fine. It’s about time anyway. I’ll see if she wants to meet up before then.”
The first time it had happened was when Draco was eight. He had asked his father what
Bringing his knees to his chest and burying his face in his hands, he tried to steady his breathing. He felt like there was a pit in his chest. He took deeper breaths, as if whatever that emptiness was could be filled that way.
“Oh… Okay. Yeah, thanks.”
Draco set a giggling Teddy down. “Hey, I got you Chocolate Frogs. They’re on the coffee table. Why don’t you go have some?”
Ron and Hermione come over at a less-than-ideal time. Harry has some explaining to do.
When he entered, he saw Malfoy in mid-conversation with Andromeda, who was transferring food onto a platter, and a petite girl with dark brown hair in twin braids. She looked familiar, but he wasn’t sure where he knew her from yet.
They walked down the hallway to open the door that had a small silver nameplate with ‘Sirius” engraved on it in cursive. Harry felt for the light switch and turned it on.
Harry nodded slowly. He didn’t want to be too honest about how much he wanted it, but at this point, it must be obvious to Malfoy.
“What?” Harry asked, still looking at him through the reflection of the mirror.
“It’s called grief, sweetheart,” Andromeda had told him matter-of-factly. “You’re finally letting yourself mourn.”
After Teddy had calmed down and finished asking all his questions (
“Don’t worry, mate. It's the first battle simulation session. It’s normal to freak out a little, yeah? Those flashbacks will be gone in no time. Swear.”
Potter’s eyes snapped up from the spot on the floor he seemed to be focusing on. “Wha-”
“No, no, you’re good,” she said, suddenly preoccupied with a book lying in front of her.
Astoria helped him, holding open the bag Teddy kept the blocks in for Harry. “Ah, sounds like him. Such a tosser. Love him, though.”
Teddy’s head whipped to Harry. “WHAT?!”
Potter shook his head and closed his eyes tight. “It’s… It’s nothing. I just don’t think I can go in there. I tried, but… Not tonight.”
When Ron, who was still in his pyjamas, opened the door, the first thing he said was, “Really?
Harry had expected Astoria to look like all the Slytherins he knew from school. Malfoy may have changed, but he still dressed the way he - and all his friends - did back in Hogwarts whenever they were out of uniform: Dark or neutral monochrome outfits. A rotation of plain button-downs and turtlenecks tucked in with an expensive belt. Always with a blazer on. Hair perfectly in place at all times. Shoes? Leather and shined.
She opened her eyes and set down the cupcake. “Maybe I just have crap mates, but none of them have ever sent me pastries in cutesy packaging in the middle of the workday. Actually, now that I think of it, none of my exes have either. Or
Draco chuckled as he started unstoppering some of the ingredient bottles for the potion. “That’s true.”
Harry poked him hard on the shoulder. "That’s not true. Hermione doesn't. And Ron, well,...he wants to try."
It had happened so often that each instance had blurred together for Draco. He no longer knew which beating happened at a certain time. He couldn’t even remember when his father had first used the Cruciatus Curse on him. What he could remember, though, was the pain and the fear. Too vividly, at that.
Draco shook his head. “You spoil that kid so much.”
As he moved faster, his thrusts became more erratic and desperate.
Hermione put her hands up defensively. “Well,
“You owe me alcohol from Andromeda’s pantry?”
“C’mon, Potter, look at me.”
Harry was hoping it wasn’t obvious how much blood was rushing to his cheeks. “Likewise.”
He looked at his grandmother, his brows drawn together. “But…”
Most of the pictures he had seen of his parents together were from after he was born. They looked barely seventeen in this photo and were wearing their Hogwarts robes. Harry liked the thought of them being another typical, nauseating pair of lovesick kids in school.
Harry nodded, his eyes lingering on Malfoy’s exposed collarbone for a beat too long. “Why aren’t you just using magic?”
“Er, yeah, hi Tina,” Harry chuckled out awkwardly at the counter of the flower shop he used to frequent when he was dating Ginny. It was the only one open this early.
“Oh. Okay.” Draco shoulders sagged in relief. “What do I do, Astoria?”
Feeling like a teenager being chastised, Draco grumbled as he nodded.
He could hear Potter muttering a retort under his breath.
“Oh, er… Level eight as well,” Malfoy said.
But he still liked his solitude. He still only ever saw his friends once a month at the most, which was usually when Hermione and Ron would force him out Grimmauld Place. Whenever Ron managed to drag him to the Weasleys for someone’s birthday, he still felt welcomed like family, but it was also too overwhelming.
Smiling, Harry could feel more tension leave his body. “Yeah? It’s not just that, though. The bloke actually is legitimately fun to be around.”
He had been older than Fred’s age when he died for over a year already. In three years, he’ll be older than Tonks. Then it will just keep happening. He’ll get older and older, then he’ll surpass Sirius. Then Remus. Is this what milestones are supposed to feel like when you survive a war?
Harry laughed, getting down on one knee. “Hey Teddy,” he murmured, giving him a proper hug. “What are you up to?” he asked as he pulled away.
don't have a problem with them.
She nodded. “Oh, without a doubt. You’re- ...Your friendship is good for him. I can see it.”
There was a lull for a few moments. Harry expected Hermione to be the first to say something, but Ron finally spoke up.
“Here you go,” Harry said cheerily as he handed a copy of
“Oh, god.” Hermione must have noticed the shake in his words, because she immediately left her seat and crouched in front of Harry, putting her hands on his knees. “Hey, come on. Of course not.”
,” Andromeda scolded as she started carrying the food out of the room. “Come on, let’s eat. Harry, go get Teddy, will you? And make sure he washes his hands.”
“It was alright,” Draco replied, walking over to sit on the couch. “I mostly spent my time in the Potions room. A lot of kids I was assigned to got discharged yesterday. I wrote to their parents during my break, and they said the kids were doing well.”
She scooted closer to him, linking their arms together like she always did when she was comforting him. Harry rested his cheek on top of her head, once again realizing just how much he had been missing his friends all these months.
Malfoy frowned at him. “What?”
“There’s a bunch of healing stuff over there,” Potter said, motioning his head to the direction of a cupboard on the other side of the room. “‘Mione whipped them up for the injury I got on my last mission a year ago. Some of them are still good. I think.”
She nodded. “It does. But, I’ve grown quite a bit close to Draco. Got along with him more than I did with Narcissa when I first visited them all those months ago.”
- "THEY KISSED AND EVERYTHING IS PERFECT AND HAPPY NOW" um....uh... well! let's see! like i said we a lot of chapters left!
Draco opened his eyes and found himself in a narrow alley between buildings. He looked around to make sure no one had seen him before stepping onto the sidewalk and making his way to the bookshop.
Harry carefully placed the photo in the box of items he was keeping. “The thought comforted me for a few years after the war. But now that we’ve broken up… Yeah, it’s weird.”
Potter, luckily, seemed to buy it.
Harry followed his gaze to see a cluster of posters that featured Muggle women posing seductively in bikinis. He laughed, shaking his head. “Not the most child-friendly decor, I suppose.”
is boyfriend behaviour.”
It was simply just that Draco had realized that Potter was an attractive bloke. And that he was kind and funny. And that he made the people around him feel good. These shouldn’t be earth-shattering truths. Almost everyone who knew Harry Potter would describe him as that. Knowing all these things now shouldn’t be counted as having feelings for him, right?
“Because I
But even as he felt the pleasure start to mercilessly build up, legs shaking and moans escaping his mouth, his thoughts were still too entangled in visions of green eyes and brown skin and a sweet, lopsided grin.
Then, they locked eyes. And Draco wasn’t unsure anymore.The shock on the man’s face and the polite half-nod that Draco recognized from those awkward hallway encounters at the Ministry? Definitely Potter.
Astoria glared at him through the reflection of her mirror as she held her makeup brush away from her face. “Draco, it is
Harry felt his chest get heavy as she said that, but he nodded anyway. Looking at her fight back tears, he could feel a knot in his throat as all the guilt and shame he had been repressing started engulfing him. Harry hated this. He hated that he was looking at the girl he loved with the knowledge that he couldn’t keep pretending this was still a relationship.
Malfoy.”
“If that’s true, he must be a pretty great bloke because you’re a brilliant godfather.”
Before he could finish the sentence, the customer stepped out from the bookshelves and started making his way to the counter. He didn’t know what Draco Malfoy was doing here, but he found himself feeling grateful anyway.
Relief flooded Harry as he shot up, yanking his arm from Hermione’s grip. “Let’s go.”
Hermione rolled her eyes. “My first day of work, he apologized to me for, you know, being a racist prick to me for seven bloody years. Of course, I just told him to leave me alone, but...Well, he sort of started to really show up whenever I needed him to in the few months we worked together at the Ministry.”
“What does she do?”
“No, Harry, stay. Please. We don’t have to talk about that. I- I was wrong. I’m sorry, it was dumb.” She looked up at him, a sympathetic expression on her face that made it obvious she didn’t believe what she was saying at all.
“Yeah...J-just move.”
Draco snorted.
“That’s obviously not going to work, Potter. Let me…” Draco offered, already pulling his wand out.
“Is that weird?”
He closed his eyes tight and tried to shut out the thoughts. It worked for the first few minutes, but they were too much. They sounded like they were being yelled into his ear. His own voice in his head.
“Yeah, yeah we did.”
Snapping out of his thoughts, Draco cleared his throat. “Sorry. I was just trying to remember a spell." He grabbed his wand and tapped Potter’s palm thrice, whispering the incantation for a numbing charm. “Better?”
Malfoy chuckled. “I’m guessing that’s happened before?”
When Potter managed to slide the wardrobe against the corner like Draco had asked him to, he wiped the sweat on his forehead with the back of his hand. “Better?”
Harry got up, grabbing the box of framed pictures he had next to him. “Oh, no. It’s fine,” he said, giving Malfoy a small, sort of apologetic smile. As if to say,
Harry couldn’t help but snort, earning him a trademark Draco Malfoy sneer. “I can’t imagine you liking that.”
“And it’s not like you’ll be alone while Andromeda entertains everyone. You’ll have Weasley and Granger.”
He walked up to the building, glancing at his watch between strides as if that would make him any less late. Just as he was about to jog up the stairs leading up to the entrance, he looked up and noticed Harry Potter sitting on the topmost step.
“You know, just because I said I believed you were a good person now, doesn’t mean you’re any less irritating.”
Malfoy looked up from his book. "Oh, you're back. Er, yeah."
“Food’s ready!” Ron called from the dining room.
At the center was the biggest portrait. It was him with his parents. Teddy must have only been a few days old then. He was being cradled in Tonks’ arms as Remus planted a kiss on the top of his head. His hair was pink like his mother’s.
she had added.
“I think that you’re capable of trusting people more than you’re aware of... And that more people are deserving of that trust than you believe.”
“He’s
Hermione grabbed him by the arm before he could leave.
“That’s true,” a young woman whose name Harry knew was Fatima piped up with a kind, empathetic expression. “For the first time since my boyfriend died, I’ve been spending time with our mutual friends. It’s a part of my life I thought was off-limits now, but every time I laugh with them, it feels like transforming that particular trace of him into something beautiful.”
And that isolation… There’s been ups and downs. I expected that. But I didn’t really expect to be confronted with all the grief I’d been suppressing. I wasn’t even aware I was suppressing any grief at all. I thought I
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Not a lot of career opportunities for a former pureblood supremacist and the son of a convicted criminal.”
Malfoy walked into the room, looking around. “Well, I know the first thing I want to clean out.”
“We keep finding ourselves like this,” Potter said with a huff of amusement.
Then, he stopped, his eyes locking on one person in particular: a familiar blond-haired boy he thought he would never see again.
tall!” he exclaimed, raising his hand level to his own height.
“What about it?” It came out in a snap, and he immediately felt guilty. But it didn’t seem to faze her.
Malfoy laughed. “Sounds like her. But I’m good. Came from dinner with mother.”
Potter smirked. The kind of lopsided, teasing  grin that used to aggravate Draco. “Well, I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were
He shut his eyes tight.
“Okay,
“Do you hate me?"
Malfoy nodded. “Of course.”
Draco is having A Crisis about a certain crush that was definitely more complicated than all the ones he has had before. Harry feels strange about his new friendship with Draco, but slowly realizes it's actually what he needs to take the baby steps towards healing.
Harry always had dreams of his parents that felt like false memories. Them holding him after his birth. His first birthday. His parents guiding him as he took his first steps. He knew none of them were real; there was no way he could remember any of that. Still, no detail ever came up that was enough to keep him from pretending they actually happened. Until now.
“They were alright,” Draco said, grinning. “But… Er… Sure. Yeah. Why not?”
Astoria faced Harry. “I said something wrong, didn't I?”
“And you. I’ll have you.”
“You don’t have to do this,” Potter whispered, his eyes gazing into the distance now.
“Is it that obvious?” Harry said suddenly as he looked up at her, surprising himself as it tumbled out of his mouth.
Hermione leaned over and grabbed his hand. “We love you, Harry. I mean, we’re a family. So, of course, we were angry. But we were mostly scared. And sad.”
“It’s fine, mother. It’s just a little crush. Nothing more.” Draco didn’t know just how deep his feelings ran. But he knew he was lying when he said it.
“Just need to fill the walls with pictures and the wardrobe with his clothes…” Potter said, taking a swig from his bottle. “Oh, and toys and books…”
Draco felt awkward. He knew that Potter probably wanted him to get up and leave him alone. But, for some reason, he felt like he couldn’t just do that.
Malfoy gave him a small smile. “You’ve always been so dramatic, Potter.”
ALSO the world is still fuckn crazy right now i know but i still hope you all find some semblance of peace/joy/comfort/celebration/etc etc in your lives this last stretch of 2020. ty for keeping me company this year by reading this fic that i started bc i was going insane in quarantine lmao. next update will probably be sometime in january (no i cant believe it's going to be 2021 already either jesus christ) but until then, be kind to yourselves and happy holidays ily all <3
one of the reasons I’m choosing Hogwarts.”
Ron no longer looked angry. His expression was mostly blank, but Harry caught the look in his eye. He knew Ron was back to just being worried again, pushing all that bitterness down. Harry tried not to drown in the guilt of it too much before he’d even be able to speak. Which was hard.
“Aw, really?” she cooed, placing a hand over her heart. “You know, I was pretty surprised when he befriended me in the first place. He never really opens up to anyone else. Well, until you obviously.”
“No. Nothing happened.” He wished he knew if that was a lie or not.
“Your pasts are so entangled already,” his mother continued, brushing hair away from his face. “And with Teddy and my sister in the picture, so are your lives now. So, you can’t just...choose to never see him again if you get hurt this time.”
Harry dropped the letter and spun his chair around. Teddy was standing in the doorway of his study.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The person you fancy… It’s Draco, isn’t it?”
“Ah, yeah...Thanks.”
He looked over to the counter where Malfoy was seasoning the tray of cut-up vegetables like Harry had asked him to. Harry let himself watch Malfoy work, just for a few moments while he could.
Potter raised his eyebrows. “Is that a compliment?”
Draco froze halfway into bringing a forkful of pasta to his mouth again. He put it down, keeping his eyes on his plate. “Oh, you know, I just...didn’t realize how tired I was.”
“How is it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before Draco could retort, there was a knock on the door.
The lift doors opened again, revealing a group of Ministry workers waiting outside. He felt uncomfortable as he noticed many of their faces light up at the sight of him.
Still gripping his hand, Astoria shook her head. “No. Really.
As he reached the second floor and heard Teddy’s giggle down the hall, he realized he'd only ever seen the bedrooms on the fourth floor. He didn’t know what any of these other rooms were. Judging by the dust collecting on some of the doorknobs, most of them were unused.
Malfoy nodded. “Yeah, yeah. Stupid clerical stuff for the Wizengamot.”
Teddy has been loving sleeping in the same room as his godfather whenever he stayed over, and Potter was more than happy to oblige. But they both knew that he couldn’t baby and share a room with Teddy forever.
“‘Arry?”
Harry frowned. “Oh, no. Did I leave something out?”
to start the fire of his cauldron.
"That's great. You need your friends. I'm getting quite tired of being the one spending time with you all the time,” Malfoy said with an exaggerated sneer.
Draco did. Bracing himself up with his hands on the mattress at either side of the man’s head, he started to roll his hips in a slow, even rhythm. He could feel him tighten around him, and Draco bowed his head, whispering curses between them.
“Good,” Potter said, placing his empty glass on the coffee table. He flexed his hand and cringed ever so slightly as he did so.
Harry stood up and rushed out after him. By the time he reached the ground floor, though, Ron was gone, and the front door was open. “
Harry walked up to the door after parking his bike, running his hands through his unruly curls as an attempt to get rid of his helmet hair. He really didn’t have any reason to be here other than the fact that one of the customers he had at the shop today had a kid that talked like Teddy and made Harry miss him despite only seeing him a day ago.
Draco didn’t know what Potter had been up to since then. Last he saw him was barely a year into his training. To his knowledge, no one has really seen Potter since the Dolohov arrest. So, what was he doing in the same bereavement support group as Draco?
“Well, you’re obviously colorblind if you thought those two shades were identical,” Malfoy countered.
The furniture was refurbished and shining like they were new, all moved to the right places. The bed was clean and soft, with thick blue sheets and comforters neatly made. One of the walls was covered in floating shelves, still empty but ready for Teddy’s books and toys. Light blue was painted all over the walls, making the room look like the sky on a nice summer’s day. The floor was covered in a carpet that was a darker shade of blue, almost like the night, and had a constellation pattern.
“And the fact you haven’t been using magic for a while now?”
Before he could get an answer, she had already walked away and Teddy, who was carrying an assortment of dragon stuffed toys and figurines in his arms, had spotted him.
“Alright, mate. I’ll write you soon. Or Hermione will text you with that bloody mobile of hers.”
“...Well, fuck.”
so what do u do when the dude u have crush on ghosts u after try to kiss him? :/
“Is that why you’ve kept me around for this long?” Malfoy asked, chuckling and walking over to sit on the bed.
“This makes everything make sense now,” Draco said before thinking, gesturing around the room with his other hand as he repeated the motion of his wand. The Auror program explained why Potter was in good shape. But seeing him shirtless for the first time days ago had made Draco wonder how he was still
“Okay,” he mumbled. “It
He was right. Harry would have never moved into the place if any part of it still reminded him too much of Sirius’ terrible parents. The place was now brighter and cleaner than it had ever been. Hermione had transformed all the furniture into more modern-looking pieces. All the dark wallpaper had been replaced with white paint. He had torn down the walls with portraits of Sirius’ relatives on them because the permanent sticking charms wouldn’t budge.
Potter laughed. “They’re masterpieces!”
Draco laughed nervously. “Yeah? I- I suppose… I haven’t noticed.”
Draco looked at him. “You’re going to get him a duplicate of everything he already owns at Andromeda’s, aren’t you?”
Potter nudged him playfully with his elbow. “You too, Malfoy.”
“Are you thinking of, er…” Malfoy cleared his throat, looking away. “Do you reckon you two are ever getting back together?”
- harry and draco rly level up the bickering when they're around ppl huh
Astoria was different. She was wearing denim overalls with a cropped pink t-shirt underneath and a flannel wrapped around her waist. Strands of her brown hair were sticking out and getting loose from her twin braids. She wore sparkly orange nail polish, which was chipped at the edges.
Draco climbed the steps, and it was only when he sat next to him that Potter realized he was there.
Draco laughed, making sure there was no hint of jealousy in his expression as he did. “Merlin, can you imagine what dating someone from the wizarding world would mean for you?”
“That’s why I’m leaving.”
Harry smirked, using a throw pillow to block her feet. “I know, I know.”
Lucius Malfoy had gotten a life sentence to Azkaban immediately after the war. But moments ago were the trials of Draco Malfoy and Narcissa Malfoy. The shock on the Wizengamot’s faces when Harry had started to testify in their defense was etched in his mind as he splashed cold water onto his face.
“You go ahead.”
“It’s… It’s alright. I can hardly call it a loss, right? Besides, I’ve made some friends at work. Like Astoria Greengrass from school.”
Malfoy shrugged. “I don’t know. It’s sort of...relaxing?”
“Well, maybe if you didn’t get on top of me-”
“That’s good. There’s one more thing, though…” he trailed off, gesturing to something behind Harry.
“Thanks.” Draco could feel a flurry in his chest that he didn’t quite understand at the moment. “Still, though. I can’t really blame everyone for still hating me.”
Hermione grimaced. “Now that’s pushing it.”
“So, er... Are we all okay?”
Ron was glaring at him, his mouth agape and his fingers tightening around the neck of the wine bottle he was holding. Hermione took it from him, probably concerned he was going to throw it if she didn’t, and looked at Harry with a less hostile, but still distressed, expression.
“S’that what you always feel like?” Ron had a concerned look on his face.
“That still doesn’t excuse the things Malfoy did,” Harry insisted, but the way Malfoy looked the night Dumbledore died started to flood his head as he said it. The terror on his face, the temptation when Dumbledore offered to welcome him to their side, the pain in his eyes. Harry was getting less and less convinced by the words he was telling Andromeda.
“What part of what I’m saying isn’t fair? You could barely even look him in the eye when we worked on the same floor as him. Suddenly, what, you’re best mates?”
“He will.”
Malfoy looked up at him, looking slightly startled. “Hah. Yeah. Andromeda and I had a bit of wine after she got Teddy ready for bed. She looked sleepy, so I offered. She just went up, actually.”
“Crap!”
Harry had actually been excited about this mission. The idea of taking down the last of them had felt like closure, especially because it was the man who killed Lupin. But when it was time to capture him, when he found himself across Dolohov, Harry had felt like he was frozen to the floor, arms unable to move. The next thing he remembered was waking up to the hospital ceiling.
Harry's worrying over Draco is driving him mad on top of missing him terribly. He's just not sure what to do about it.
dumb.”
It was strange that seeing him in that meeting weeks ago was so bizarre when Draco had already known that the people who lived in this house tied their lives together. The idea that maybe their worlds were always meant to collide again had never really crossed his mind before. It was hard to ignore it now, though.
“Oh, sure,” Draco replied as he watched Potter jog up the stairs.
Draco smiled. “I’ll take that as a compliment. I had some selfish motives, though. I was getting those attacks too. So, I wanted to figure out what was going on with me.”
-yes im ignoring the movies where just abt everyone seems to know wandless magic. i like the idea of it being this extremely difficult thing that takes years to master and that not a lot of people can do. but more on that next chapter!
“You’re killing me, ‘Mione. Spit it out. I want you to.”
He turned back to Malfoy and saw that his eyes were a tad bit glassy as he continued to watch the colors of Teddy’s hair change in their photo.
“I… I think so. For now, at least.”
“Y-yeah…” Harry managed. The pressure on his chest was easing up, but his heartbeat was still too fast for his liking and it still felt like he was chasing after a full breath.
Potter held out his hand, palm-up, and Draco took it, examining the dark scar. It looked more faded now, but without the right potions on hand, it was still bound to hurt.
“Yeah?”
Harry shook his head. “S’not your fault. I should have told them we were friends. I was just scared of what they’d say if I told them it was easier being with-” he cut himself off, looking away. “I just...Yeah.”
“Hmm?”
“Yes,” she stated with a sense of finality and a pointed look at Ron. “He’s Harry’s friend. And Teddy’s uncle. We can at least try, can’t we?”
“Okay, no.”
Malfoy sighed. “I’m sorry about that.”
Draco eyed her glass. “Did you really have to chase it down with
-did harry rly need to caress draco's face tenderly like that? no that's not how wandless magic works. he's just gay and drunk
), which had him up a bit past his bedtime, he was starting to get sleepy. He snuggled up to Harry’s chest and hummed contentedly. “Tell me more, okay?”
Potter followed and closed the door behind him. He took off his coat and hung it on the rack by the door. “I’ll just go check if Teddy’s asleep first before getting us something to drink.”
Potter smiled, but it faded away in moments. “Really, though. I don’t know if it’s just because I’m scared of the wizarding world in general right now. But unless I end up with Ginny again, which I doubt, I can’t imagine being with anyone who knows who I am.”
Teddy turned to look at Draco, beaming. “I like surprises.”
Draco jolted awake to find that Teddy was sitting on his lap and holding his face in his tiny hands.
But before he could say it, there were descending footsteps on the staircase behind him. His head whipped around to see Malfoy.
Potter laughed, and Draco couldn’t help but smile at the sound. He liked making him laugh.
“Why wouldn’t you? I thought I was straight until
Potter smiled, still looking surprised.  “So, until when will you be at St. Mungo’s?”
Andromeda patted him on the leg, looking apologetic, but Harry could tell she was also holding back a laugh. It was hard not to miss Tonks when Andromeda had the same sparkle in her eyes when she was amused.
But Harry figured that was too much. And too real. And that it wasn’t even something he’d say aloud to himself. So, instead, he rolled his eyes, and said, “Sort of.”
“Being a complete sap,” Potter said, his face looking smug.
Teddy’s lips were quivering, and there were tears forming in his eyes. His hair was the same brown as the color Tonks’ hair used to shift to whenever she was upset.
Before he could follow that train of thought, there was a thud of a closing door from down the hall.
His parents never got anywhere close to their 22nd birthdays. But Harry turned 22 a few weeks ago. He was officially older than his parents ever got to be.
“So, you got stuck washing the dishes,” he finally managed to say.
Most of the time, it wasn’t so bad. Draco knew how to treat him like any other friend. But, sometimes, he would blush too hard when Potter was close. Sometimes, Potter would tease him about zoning out so much, because that was the excuse Draco used when he was caught staring. Sometimes, when he touched Potter, a friendly pat on the shoulder or an accidental graze of a hand, Draco would find himself lingering for a few seconds before he could stop himself.
Malfoy glanced at Harry’s hand. With blood rushing to his face, Harry realized he was still holding the other boy by the arm.
“It’s fine.” Potter put his hands over his shoulders to grab the back of his shirt before pulling it off. “I wanted to change before working on the room again anyway.”
Draco just grunted in response, thinking of the night before in Andromeda’s kitchen. He remembered brushing crumbs off Potter’s lip before he could stop himself. He remembered the alarms ringing in his brain as he did it. Most of all, he remembered the stunned, soft expression of Potter’s face as it had happened. And the way he had looked like he could also hear the rest of the world slowly humming to silence in the span of those few seconds.
Harry shrugged as he tossed a bunch of worn out and unusable shirts into the rubbish box. “Why not? This friendship seems to be based on oversharing anyway,” he said, chuckling.
“Right,” she repeated.
Draco wanted to feel angry at his mother. Wanted to ask why she was ruining a good thing. But he also knew that her concerns were valid. She was right. When it came to Draco’s dating life, she usually was.
Harry rolled his eyes. “What are you doing here?”
“I do! But everyone other than Kingsley is just a personified
“And it’s near Hogsmeade…”
Harry nodded, thinking about how excited he was to visit Ron and Hermione after this meeting. It was starting to feel normal again after seeing them a few times the past month, but he still felt proud and warm about it. “Yeah, exactly.”
to a customer along with her change.
Harry couldn’t place how she did this when he was never close to being this transparent with his best friends anymore. Maybe it was because he never really got to know her until after the war, so she never reminded him of his life back then. Whatever it was, he liked her company and trusted her.
She gave him a dismissive wave of the hand. “It’s fine, Ron. I obviously don’t completely trust him yet, but I do think he’s changed. And I trust Harry and Andromeda.”
Draco was staring at his drink, but he could hear the shock in his voice. “Yeah. As the Potions teacher. I also meet up with Slughorn quite a bit during the holidays for theory work to prepare for it as well. McGonagall actually helped me get the St. Mungo’s job. The main work I do there is brew potions for the Healers. But I also had to choose extra work to specialize in, so I chose to help out Muggle-born kids. ”
How had he not figured this out sooner?
Harry rolled his eyes. "Yeah, yeah, I know. I'll get there. We're talking about
With his head still reeling from what Teddy had said - or from how
“Oh, alright,” Harry said, relieved. “Did she fall asleep while watching cartoons with him and woke up to find him still awake at midnight?”
"Yeah, speaking of..."Do you want to come have a few drinks with us this weekend?."
- thank you so much for the comments and kudos!!!!!! i truly appreciate it
“So, what’s the painting for? The one you commissioned from Andromeda,” Harry asked her as they sat on the floor, sorting the blocks by color at Teddy’s request. Teddy was behind them, rummaging through his trunk and trying to choose which dragon should live in the castle they had just finished building before making a new one.
“When he grows up, I’ll tell him this is your idea of babysitting him.”
Then, a part of Hermione and Malfoy’s conversation pierced through.
yours?”
He cut himself off as he saw the picture Harry had in his hands
“What? No, I was going to show you a few new movies I got.”
She smiled at him hesitantly - the way most people he didn’t talk to at work did - and left the room.
“Well, there you go,” the man said. “When my wife died, I isolated everyone in my life. Then I met a friend in a group like this one who helped me process all those feelings of grief and trauma. It eventually helped me let my walls down again... So, you’re not being hypocritical. Your instincts are just leading you to people who can best help you heal at the moment. Whether you know it or not, you’re choosing to form bonds with people who can change you for the better and help you get ready to make space for the people you’ve been meaning to let into your life again.”
As soon as the bookshop door closed, Malfoy started laughing. “Even in the Muggle world, everyone flirts with you,” he said, picking up the receipt with the phone number on it.
When Harry took note of how fast his heart was still beating, he had a suspicion it was for a different reason this time.
Swatting her hand away, he sighs. “If I accept the offer, I’ll just be stuck in this room eight hours a day. No more talking to patients and helping the Muggle-born kids that end up here. I want something more hands on. I want to teach.”
Malfoy raised a brow. “Stop what?”
Potter nodded slowly. “Yeah.”
“Oh, what’s it called? We have a lot of non-Muggle stuff in the backroom. The owner, Mr. Thornton, has this personal collection of rare books that he wants to get rid of.”
He was about to get up and suggest that they should go help Ron because they had cooked so much food earlier, but Hermione spoke again.
Draco gulped down the remainder of his drink before standing up. “I’m going to bed.”
People really do change. And grow. Maybe it was about time he gave the ones around him a true, genuine chance to get to know the person he was now. And trust that they’ve also changed enough to not see him as the savior he was at seventeen, even if they were there to experience that part of his life more intimately than anyone else.
” Harry and Ron sputtered in unison.
“I don’t have- ”
“Do you get shifts like that often?”
Before he was aware of what he was about to do, Draco yelled “Oi, Potter!” from where he was standing.
Absentmindedly forming the base of the new castle, Harry watched as Astoria patiently answered all of Teddy’s questions. She even threw in a few stories here and there, her hands waving around as she seemed to get caught up in what she was saying as well. Teddy laughed and gasped, his hair switching colors more rapidly at his excitement.
“So, yeah,” he mumbled as he finished telling them about finishing Teddy’s room the day before. “I was playing with him in it before his grandmother came to pick him up this morning, and it just feels so much lighter. I mean, it already did once I first threw all the rubbish away and started working on it. But now that it’s really, officially, his, it’s just a lot clearer just how much he can transform it into something...good. And happy.”
He pulled it out of his pocket and studied it. It glinted in the sunlight that slanted into the room from the window. Harry thought of all the junk in the room he had gotten rid of and how it made him feel lighter.
Astoria started laughing, crossing her arms and shaking her head.
“That’s not fair-”
She snickered, shaking her head. “I have something in the back, I’ll go get it. Just promise me you won’t be riding that blasted bike of yours. Don’t want you coming back here in ten minutes after dropping one of my potted flowers in the middle of traffic again.”
“You literally lived in a mansion, Malfoy.”
Jasmine, the facilitator, nodded encouragingly. “It can be anything. How you’re feeling, whether you’ve been seeing your friends… Anything,” she prompted.
“Besides, being around him - this new Malfoy - just made me realize that I… That I stand a chance in outrunning the war.”
He looked up and glanced at the calendar on his bedside table.
A silence followed, but it wasn’t awkward like Draco expected. It felt comfortable. Like they were just sitting and taking in the fact that they understood each other. Draco looked at Potter, who looked the most at peace Draco has ever seen him, and figured he felt it too.
“I... I won’t.”
His throat finally clear, Harry just shrugged and fiddled with the string of his teabag. “What do you mean?”
Lately, Harry’s dreams have been different too. His nightmares of running across Hogwarts as he felt bodies of students brushing his feet or of jets of green light hurtling towards him were replaced with what seemed like false memories. He couldn’t remember specifics; most of them were arbitrary, fleeting moments of different people. His parents. Sirius. Lupin. Dumbledore. Fred. Tonks.
“No, no, really. I did. I can't blame everything on the trauma, can’t I? Yes, that's why I stayed away. But I'm still a bloody adult, with adult relationships and decisions. And the choices I made hurt you both. And I won't do that again.
“That’s wonderful, Harry,” Jasmine said. “Reclaiming spaces we associate with the ones we’ve lost often does make healing easier. Whether it’s a literal space like a room you can’t go into or a part of your life you think you can’t experience anymore because of the thought of loss.”
“I’m sure Harry will love the help,” Andromeda insisted, looking pointedly at Potter.
Ron rolled his eyes and made a face that Harry knew said
They had spent the whole afternoon working on the last part of the room: the window seat they had built for the huge bay window. It was white to match the windows, and the cushions were in varying shades of purple. Draco couldn’t wait to see what it would like in the sunlight.
Harry took a deep breath and nodded, feeling a lot lighter than he had this morning.
“Oh. Right,” Harry murmured, remembering that Yaxley had managed to grab Hermione’s arm when they Apparated from the Ministry after stealing the locket from Umbridge. Each of the Death Eaters must have been stationed here at least once while he, Ron, and Hermione were on the run. In case they came back.
Some of the tension leaving Harry’s shoulders, he chuckled. “Yeah? You’re one to talk.”
“What the-” Draco hastily took the mirror shard out of Potter’s hands and placed it on the step below them. “What
So, I can’t emphasize how
“You're staring. Did you want to say something?” Malfoy asked as he continued to scrub at a dirty pot, glancing at Harry.
“Yeah, I do,” he whispered, his eyes returning to the photograph. “I just didn’t expect that you’d have-”
Harry took a breath. “I feel like this goes without saying seeing as I've been spending practically every day with you this past month. But I should say it anyway. I really appreciate your company. I really like being with you, being your friend. And it’s strangely helped me like myself more than I ever have. And
and Andromeda was gone.
He groaned, burying his face in his hands. Draco wasn’t sure how long he could keep this up.
“I… I don’t know. I’m too scared of the answer to really think about that. But I hope not.”
Draco turned around and saw that he was leaning against the huge wooden wardrobe and panting. “I said to the left.
Harry let out a deep breath and nodded. “Yeah.”
Draco nodded. “Well, I think you’ve got in you, for what that’s worth.”
“Fine. It’s just...” She leaned forward on her folded arms on the table. “It’s him, isn’t it?”
Astoria looked at him sympathetically. “I don’t know the answer to that, Draco.”
Ron looked at her incredulously. “You can’t be serious.
you I could cook. And all of those times you rejected my food... ” Potter let out an exaggerated sigh.
“Let me see.”
Malfoy shrugged. “It’s alright. He’s gone. It doesn’t matter anymore.”
“I was… I was actually with Potter.”
“Turned into
“Anyway,” Ron starts, getting up from the table. “I’m going to go have a shower as I try to wrap my head around this whole Trying to Be Friends With Malfoy thing. You staying for long?”
Potter made a face at him as he tried to dab at his shirt with a paper towel.
“I...I’m sorry that I assumed it was a girl.”
“Two months ago?” Ron asked, suddenly straightening in the seat he was slouching in for the past hour.
He no longer felt paralyzed at loud, sudden sounds, and he no longer had trouble breathing whenever he found himself too deep into his memories of the war. Yet, there was still a heavy weight he was carrying every day in his chest that wouldn’t go away and his wand had been stored away in a cupboard since he resigned as if magic itself was the direct cause of all this pain.
“Alright, kid. Come on,” he whispered as he carried him out the study and up the stairs.
Malfoy looked at the photo, speechless and thumb rubbing against the edges of the silver frame. In the picture was Malfoy asleep on the couch with Teddy on his chest dozing off as well. He was running his hand through his nephew’s locks in his sleep, Teddy’s hair shifting with every stroke. Blue. Pink Green. Blue. Pink. Green.
“Thanks,” Potter murmured, looking up at him.
Potter looked up at him curiously, smirking slightly. “Merlin, I don’t know when I’ll start getting used to you doing that.”
The oven timer went off, and his friends stopped rambling. Ron got up. “Finally! I’ll go set the table and prepare the food.”
“Well, you still deserve to hear from me from time to time.”
“I told you. I’ve started talking to Narcissa again after Lucius passed away,” she said, nonchalantly.
“How about you, Harry? Anything you’d like to share?”
fit when Potter had quit a year ago.
She nodded, still underlining and crossing out phrases on the scroll she was looking at. “Yeah, why?”
Still, he hadn’t predicted that cutting off that world, even for just barely three months, would have led him to find anything beyond complete isolation terrifying. All he ever did nowadays was stay at home and get lost in the days that started to blur together. He could no longer bring himself to interact with anything that reminded him of the war and who he had to be as a teenager, including everyone he loved.
- ur kudos and comments are super motivating and they rly push me to write even on days when i dont feel like it so thank you so much? :')
Draco didn’t really mind. He just knew that if he was going to keep hiding his feelings, which is definitely the plan, he had to pretend he did.
“Oh, er...Before you head home…” He pulled out a piece of paper with a phone number on it and handed it to Harry.
Astoria was bright and bubbly. Her quips were fast, her laugh was loud, and she moved as if she’d rather be dancing at all times. It was an infectious sort of energy that Harry liked to find in people.
“Since the last case I worked on. Dolohov. I got him cornered, but when it was time to stun and arrest him, I just froze. Ever since, the idea of trying to do magic has just felt so... exhausting to me. Like, I
She shrugged. “He didn’t want me to say. And I wasn’t about to. I mean, for the longest time thought he was just trying to get on my good side before I realized there was really nothing in it for him...”
Draco is starting to pick up on signs that Harry might fancy him but tries to ignore it, the gang gets back together for a night of drinks and celebrations, and Harry says more that he planned to.
- finally an update!
“Yeah.”
“That’s true.”
“Hmm?”
Draco felt a sinking feeling in his stomach. Of course he knew it.
“What?”
Potter huffed in amusement. “You were starving and still wanted us to keep working?”
being nice to you.”
Potter snickered. “Guess I am feeling a bit dizzy.”
Ron slapped him on the back as he walked past him. “Alright. Well, have some breakfast at least. Or take a nap before you leave. You look fucking terrible.”
“Has she… Has she mentioned Malfoy? I haven’t seen him around lately and… she worked him with him so...”
His eyes flickered to Malfoy’s lips for a couple of seconds. He hoped Malfoy didn’t notice.
Draco rolled his eyes. “This is why I
But now, in hindsight, he was realizing more and more how wrong he was. As he drank his tea and waited for the oven to preheat, he thought back to all the signs his mind just didn’t pick up.
Draco looked away from Potter. He's only ever said it out loud to a few people: McGonagall, his mother, his supervisors at the hospital, Astoria. The thought that he, someone who was on the wrong side of the war, could be a teacher in charge of young people’s education did sound ridiculous. But it was real. And saying it out loud made it even more real, which was terrifying.
Harry shook his head in disbelief at how much Andromeda thought she needed to help a couple of 22-year-olds make friends.
He hadn’t thought he would have, considering all the memories from the day he fled Privet Drive. But, by the time Mr. Weasley had fixed it, removed the sidecar, and - at Harry’s request - stripped it of the extra buttons that had produced magical barriers and traps when he flew it with Hagrid, it had been unrecognizable. Harry no longer saw it as the thing he rode the day they fled from Death Eaters. It just looked the way it did in all the pictures he found of Sirius posing with it in his late teens.
Harry woke up breathing hard, hands grasping at his sheets. He sat up, throwing his blanket off the bed; it had felt like he was being suffocated by it.
And with that, she walked out of the kitchen.
“Exactly,” she replied immediately.
Harry nodded at him, unsure of how to greet him, and Malfoy nodded back. The doors of the lift slid open, and despite being repulsed at the thought of standing in a small, enclosed space with Malfoy, he stepped in.
Draco snorted. “Fair.” He tried, but he couldn’t look away from him. Their faces were so close, and his hand was still massaging the paste onto Potter’s upper arm. It was too much, but he couldn’t stop.
“Meet you at Teddy’s room in 20 minutes then?” Harry asked, but he was already turning around and walking out the door.
Teddy started to pout and tug at her sleeve. “No, don’t!”
Harry grinned. “Where’s the fun in that?”
already doing better. We know you’re sticking around this time. Things really were getting back to normal, weren’t they? Last night was just… Well, I reckon all the anger I was pushing down was bound to explode, huh? I’m sorry for that.”
He snorted. “And say what? ‘Hi professor. Sorry for responding a year late. I was having a crisis. Can I please still have the job even though I had a mental breakdown that has left me unable to use magic without spiralling into an anxiety attack? Thanks.’”
Ignoring Potter’s protests, Draco repeatedly circled the tip of his wand over the wound, saying an incantation under his breath. The cut closed and dried slowly until all was left was a dark scar. With a last wave of his wand, the remaining blood slipped off Potter’s palm and disappeared in mid-air. “The scar should fade by tomorrow morning.”
“Now, make yourself useful and dry,” Malfoy said, handing him a washed plate.
That was all it took for Ron and Hermione’s tense expressions to soften a little. Harry loved them so much.
With magic, it only took him a few minutes to alter the nameplate to say
Potter’s teasing smile started to fade away, his expression now softer, more unsure. But he didn’t look away either. His green eyes looked like they were searching for something, trying to understand something, that he wasn’t aware of yet.
He rolled up the small piece of parchment and reached over to the windowsill where the Malfoys’ owl was perched, obviously instructed to wait for a response. Harry tied the rolled-up paper to the owl’s leg before watching it fly away.
“Hey, Potter, where do you keep the-” Malfoy cut himself off, his eyes going wide. “You know, what? I’ll figure it out,” he stammered before turning around immediately and heading back up the steps.
Trying to keep in a laugh so as not to wake Teddy, Harry reached over his godson to punch Malfoy in the shoulder. "Such a prick."
Draco grimaced at the thought of how painful it must be. “Easy there, sit still, let me…” He took his wand out and whispered an incantation as he dragged the tip from the right side of Potter’s neck, down to his shoulder, and all the way to his elbow.
“I...This is…” Draco stammered, before letting out a long exhale. “This is a normal friend thing to do, right?”
He shifted uncomfortably in his seat. “I guess.”
- is it really just harry's love language to send food to and feed his friends bc that's how he experienced friendship and family for the first time via the weasleys always feeding him and ron and hermione sending him pastries when he was locked up in his room? yes. but is it normal for harry to do that for someone he's only been friends with for a month? no. does that mean he fancies draco too!? we'll see :)
Harry tries to figure out what it was about Malfoy.  As they grow closer, Harry starts to realize that there was something about them that made it feel different from all the other friendships he had. He just doesn't know what that means exactly.
“Oh… Need help watching Teddy?”
“Humor me.”
Draco didn’t share anything during the entire session. He could hardly even focus on what other people were saying. Draco had always been an attentive participant in these meetings, but he couldn’t be today. Not when Harry Potter was sitting across the circle.
Teddy yawned, shaking his head. “That’s not all he tells me.”
Potter chuckled. “No, really, though... That’s great… I think you’re going to be a great Potions teacher…”
The paper suddenly felt heavy in Harry’s hand, but he folded it anyway and kept it in his pocket. “Ginny.”
Taking a break from the wizarding world was a good idea. No strangers gaping at him as he walked down the street. No Ministry officials guilting him into being part of big events for publicity. No more responsibilities. No more Boy Who Lived.
“UNCLE DWACO. YOU’RE HERE!”
Harry took a seat as the facilitator started to speak. He scanned the circle, trying to get a feel of what he should expect from these people.
“No, really. Come in for a drink, at least. You patched my wound up and got me here. I owe you.”
When he reached the source of the sound, an open room, Draco could swear he was going to die right then and there.
Draco averted his eyes, swallowing hard to get the food in his mouth down.
“Ah, yeah…,” Malfoy murmured as he ran his hand across the cover. “Flourish and Blotts didn’t have it, so... Thanks.”
“We see each other at work, Draco. You really couldn’t wait to tell me something I already knew?”
A week later, with a twist and a sharp
Draco took another gulp of beer, his elbows brushing against Potter’s arm as he did. Potter rested his wrist on the knee that was touching Draco’s. Draco could feel the warmth of Potter’s hand and the cold of the bottle he held in it.
“Well, I hate it. It’s your turn. You talk this time.”
They all turned to Ron, Harry bracing himself because he knew where this was going.
It made sense now. Harry hasn’t picked up or even looked at a single Daily Prophet issue for years. He hated seeing his face on the paper every other day. Everything from date nights with Ginny to him visiting his parents’ grave was considered front-page news.
“Teddy here?”
an expert.”
Potter nodded. “Yeah. It’s… It’s a long story.”
He took another look at Potter as he sipped the coffee.  Potter’s hair was the messiest it’s ever been, and his t-shirt was wrinkled. Draco’s eyes travelled south and saw that Potter’s pajamas that he changed into in between movies were riding really low, exposing a strip of dark skin and the contours of his abdomen. He took another long sip in a desperate attempt to hide his face, which he was sure was reddening.
“I mean, you’ve seen Weasley and Granger a few times this past month, right? You’re doing good.”
“Alright.”
“Hey, you’re here. Look at me.”
“That's not the problem. McGonagall knows, and she doesn’t mind. Even when I returned to Hogwarts for my final year of studies after coming out, the teachers didn't have a problem. But the parents… Half of them will be protesting against an ex-Death Eater teaching their kids, which is valid, and the other half will be protesting against a gay man teaching their kids. Less valid, but still.”
“What?”
He choked on the gulp he was taking. “Jesus, Malfoy… ”
“But do you have to do it alone?” Ginny asked, her voice cracking.
Harry was about to be thankful for the quiet when another voice interrupted his thoughts. “Stop going insane ‘bout it, I get them too.”
They stayed quiet for a few moments, staring at the way the moonlight illuminates a patch of the floor. The constellations on the carpet glow.
Harry sighed, sitting on the couch. He gestured for Malfoy to take a seat as well, and he did.
Malfoy nodded. “We can paint the walls and deal with the extra furniture some other time.”
Most days, Draco would come over to help with Teddy’s room. This, of course, meant working for 20 minutes maximum. Then, they would spend the next five hours eating takeaway while Potter made him watch his favorite Muggle films or having a beer at the kitchen table while they talked and argued over dumb things. They were especially unproductive whenever Teddy was staying over and demanded that they play with him at all times.
Harry flinched. Ron was right.
Until today.
“Actually, since you’re not in a hurry to start...I should go Apparate over to my house to shower too. I’ll be quick.”
He could already hear the clatter of pans and Andromeda’s singing from the kitchen. They both must have fallen asleep on the couch halfway through the fourth movie they had been watching. Potter had said it was a prequel to the trilogy they had just watched, Star Wars. The order in which they had watched the series was baffling to Draco, but he had figured it was best not to argue.
Draco thought to himself as he smiled back,
Before Draco could articulate what to reply, Potter was gone. As he watched the bike disappear around the corner, Draco shook his head. This was definitely not how he expected his Tuesday night to go.
“Hogwarts?”
“Huh?”
“I can help.”
“Did something happen last night after I left?” Astoria pressed on.
decided we hated,” Ron said, throwing exaggerated accusatory looks at both Harry and Hermione, “maybe a heads up would be nice."
Potter was the first to break the silence. “Do you like your job?”
Ginny chuckled and elbowed him softly. “That they want the boy who saved the wizarding world to join the Auror training program? Yeah, that’s mad.”
Harry had always assumed he was straight.
He shook his head. “No, thankfully. I’ve made friends with most of the Healers and employees there. I’m not necessarily close with any of them other than Astoria, but they wouldn’t give me shit for it. Hogwarts, on the other hand…”
Ron turned to Hermione. “‘Mione, I know it’s eight in the morning, but do you want me to bring out the wine? I can’t be sober for this.”
“Well, yeah but… I don’t know, bond! You two need friends your own age too, you know.”
Malfoy chuckled. “I’m still surprised you do. Did Andromeda really give that much of a glowing review?”
“Malfoy.”
Malfoy stopped in his tracks and turned around to face Harry.
Harry stood there for a few moments, making peace with the quiet and the fact that there was no one there to answer. Then, he walked to the door.
to be Potter? What kind of sick joke is this?”
The dinner had been the noisiest one Harry had had in a while.
She sighed and finally turned to him. “You
If Harry had not grown more attuned to the little tells, Malfoy’s discomfort would have been hard to notice. But Harry did know him well enough by now and caught every slight tremble of the lip before a fake smile and subtle way his hands shook every now and then.
“Better?” Malfoy asked.
He stared at her. “Who? What?”
Snorting, Malfoy shook his head. “Yeah, sure, I’ll tell you about
The woman chuckled through her tears. “Thank you. That… That makes sense. It’s just unfair. I finally allowed myself to despise her. Then, she suddenly drops dead and the emotions get less clear again. She was a bad person, but somehow, I’m the one stuck with all this hate and bitterness and sadness.”
“Astoria!”
Malfoy’s long, slender fingers curled around the bottles of spices, hands moving across the ingredients with the expertise he definitely didn’t have the first time he helped Harry with dinner. His lips pursed in concentration, the almost shiny, muted pink of it making it impossible for Harry’s eyes to not linger. The point of his neck that meets his jaw, the muscles on his forearms, the curve of his arse.
Draco threw one of the couch’s pillows at him. “Oh, shut up, Potter.”
Malfoy snickered, balling up an empty sugar packet and throwing it at him.
Draco thought to himself as the latest addition to the group settled in the circle.
“Oh, I didn’t…”
Harry grabbed his hand and was pulled up, ending up face to face to Malfoy. This close, in the moonlight, he noticed how Malfoy’s grey eyes somehow gleamed with warmth. Harry had always thought the color made the boy look more stoic and cold. It was different now.
There was a thud against the table as Potter accidentally nudged his glass over, getting water all over his shirt.
“You know…When I last visited Hogwarts to discuss the job, McGonagall mentioned that you wrote her about the Defense of the Dark Arts position.”
The man shrugged. “It’s just a process, mate. Besides, if you go about it this way and continue to trust yourself and the people around you, you end up with a support system that’s bigger than the one you started with, right?”
“You’ve been acting... strange the past few days.”
“Malfoy?”
“Oh, no, I just Apparated onto your front step,” Malfoy said as he looked around the room.
He took it from Harry, looking confused. “What?”
“Tosser.”
“Er, hi?”
“No problem.”
“Definitely.” She was nodding a bit too enthusiastically to be convincing. “It was just a stupid guess.”
...” Harry added in a singsong manner. “And I think you two could work so much better if you two were friends....”
“Do you think you still would have if you were allowed to think for yourself?”
It was Harry’s seventh meeting. To say that he felt more at ease than he did those first few sessions was an understatement. The growing familiarity of the people in the circle - their names, their faces, their stories - felt good. Talking felt easier. And talking made him feel better.
“Oh, no, it’s alright -”
“I... Okay.” Harry set his glasses down and ran his hands all over his face, unsure of how to feel. “Merlin, do you think Ron knows? Do you think it’ll bother him?”
Harry sighed and closed the door before jogging down the stairs and into his study. He sat at his desk, fumbling with Ron’s letter again. It was late, and he needed to be up early for work tomorrow morning, but he couldn’t help it.
that?
“I’m annoyed that you’re making sense right now,” Ron mumbles.
“Of course we forgive you, mate. It’s just…” He sighed, crossing his arms and leaning back. “Look, I understand why all that happened. I do, alright? And I don't blame you for it. I know a lot of it was beyond your control. But...I guess understanding what you were going through and knowing that you weren't doing it intentionally didn't change the fact that...it hurt."
“She wouldn’t just take any teacher who’s willing to stay either. Not like she’d be settling for you,” Malfoy added. “The lot you were teaching - the D.A., right? - held their own so well during the battle because of you. You completed the Auror program. And that’s not mentioning that you saved the wizarding world. Trust me, Potter, if you ask she’ll give that position to you.”
“Blame Teddy. He’s heavier than he looks.” He still looked disoriented as he sat up straighter and tried moving his arm.
He frowned. “You know, if you aren’t buying that I actually hate my father and everything he did… Or that I regret everything
“Oh sure, of course,” the girl said giggling. “We can talk some other time.” She slid the receipt, with a phone number now scrawled on it, across the counter and turned around to leave.
He leaned back and took another sip. As he continued to watch Potter listen to Teddy, who was asking about dragons, with such sincere interest, Draco decided to deal with the warmth spreading throughout his chest later.
“Well...Why Malfoy more than your sister then?”
Draco noticed that his voice was a bit deeper now. Or maybe it just sounded like it was because of how laidback it was. He was too used to Potter raising his voice, always on the offensive.
“I don’t know either, but you’re welcome.”
being a sap,” he complained, hoping Potter wasn’t paying attention to Draco’s hands, trembling from how much he was holding back right at that moment.
Draco decided to ignore how the question made it sound like he and Potter were a couple of six-year-olds who were forced to be friends. “Yeah… We do.”
Harry closed his eyes, resting them a bit, as he laid his head on one of Teddy’s pillows. “Next time, Teddy. To be honest, I thought your Uncle Draco had told you already. He likes telling you about how much I got in trouble, doesn’t he?” he said, chuckling.
He had started seeing Ron and Hermione from time to time again. He had even managed to attend a few Weasley gatherings, even with Ginny there.
It started happening constantly after that. Getting beat up after Draco had accidentally knocked over an expensive vase. Having painful hexes thrown at him after he had hesitated to hit Dobby on his father’s behalf. Being pulled into a corner and hearing his father calling him a
Harry walked over to the kitchen table, grabbing a biscuit from an opened tin next to two empty wine glasses. “Remind me to make you wash my dishes whenever you’re over,” Harry said before popping the biscuit into his mouth.
Harry turned to face him. “You’ve been here?”
Harry knew that it was a lie, what with everything he had shared about his father in the meetings. It still obviously affected him. “You don’t get shit about it at work, right?”
Harry leaned against the doorframe of Sirius’ room after Malfoy left. It already looked a bit different. Not just cleaner but lighter, with all Sirius’ possessions packed neatly into the box they had left in the hallway. It was now a blank canvas for new, happy memories.
“Yeah.”
“I… I don’t know. It’s a long story. But basically it kind of just reminds me that I’ve done some dumb mistakes in the past that have hurt people.”
“Ah, hey.” Draco lifted the container in his hands. “Andromeda wouldn’t let me leave until I brought you lunch.”
“Yeah, apparently he returned to school to finish his last year and get his N.E.W.T.s…” Hermione trailed off and finally looked up, her brows furrowed. “Why are you suddenly interested?”
Malfoy huffed in amusement, but the worry was still evident in his face. “Okay, that’s a start.”
“And you’ve looked so much happier and more at ease these past few weeks…” She was looking down at her glass of wine, tracing the rim with her finger, but Draco could tell she was still watching him carefully from her periphery. “Humming to yourself in the morning, less jumpy, a spring in your step…”
She squinted at him. “You two have been spending quite some time together.”
Malfoy scoffed. "
“I thought the bloody moral of the day was that we all needed to communicate more,” Harry said, grabbing snatching the book away.
“Oh, sorry Ted,” Astoria said, looking apologetic. “I actually need to go soon. I have work early tomorrow.”
“What’s this?”
Ron smiled and took her hand to kiss the back of it. “No problem,” he said, before walking out the room.
As he sat down in the circle, he caught Malfoy’s eye and immediately felt guilty. It was the Sunday morning meeting, the one Harry said he’d stay clear of. He shot him an apologetic look.
Draco stumbled backwards as Teddy practically jumped into his arms. He caught his nephew more out of instinct than awareness because his eyes were still glued on Potter.
“Yeah, I know, I know. I’m sorry. Did I wake you?”
“Nah, I had to work this weekend because of an emergency, so I got today and tomorrow off.”
did you two even become friends in the first place?”
Then, he saw the forest again. Ron walking away, disappearing with a crack. And then a snake lunging at him. And then a snap of a wand. A pair of snake-like eyes.
"Anyway, yeah. Teddy’s wonderful. He’s going to fill this room with good memories. The kind you deserved back then…”
“He said his friends always sent him pastries and stuff during the summer holidays when we were back in school. Maybe this is just something their lot does.”
Draco groaned, blood rushing to his cheeks. “What exactly are you trying to tell me, mother?”
“Okay, that’s fair,” Potter said before taking another gulp of his drink. “You know… The work you’re doing at St. Mungo’s… It’s pretty great.”
Draco felt a drop in his stomach. He knew how that felt, and the many times he has proven himself right. The number of blokes who were with him because they were curious about the mysterious Draco Malfoy was disheartening. Boys that actually fancied him for him were too few and far apart. And even then it never lasted long enough to matter.
“And you two get along?”
a horrible person. My mother used to be too. For what it’s worth, the place is unrecognizable now.”
She clicked her tongue and crossed her arms. “I really wish you’d stop riding that thing.”
“Of course it doesn’t mean that,” he said, with a reassuring tone in his voice that sounded so foreign to Harry. “Death is just… It’s strange that way. We’re people, and we’re conditioned to feel sad when it happens. Because it’s still a loss, isn’t it? For many people, it’s because they lost a loved one or a hero. But sometimes it happens to people we hate too. Maybe because we feel a different loss.”
“Harry, thank y-” she cut herself off as she realized Draco was standing next to him. “Oh, Draco, sweetheart, you’re here,” she cooed, embracing him.
“Okay, okay… Good.” Harry lets out a nervous laugh, meeting her gaze. “You never answered my question.”
Hermione sighed. “Look, how about we start with dinner, and see where it goes from there?”
- my tumblr is ginnywcasleys! ty for those who take the time to message me on tumblr and remind me to update lol i need it and yall are heroes.
“A couple of days ago, after you…” Harry trailed off, gesturing vaguely to the arm Malfoy had healed. He cleared his throat. “You and Teddy fell asleep on the couch watching cartoons after dinner, remember?”
person he knew...And...And he said that’s why he thinks you should rest now...and do what you want to do... Because you helped so many people already.”
Malfoy shrugged. “Go ahead.”
There was bickering with Malfoy about the right way to pronounce bouillabaisse.
“I can still smell the food we made...That and the awfully strong cologne you’re wearing that gives away how pretentious you are.”
into Teddy’s life?”
Draco felt his cheeks flush. He hoped Potter would just assume it was from the Firewhiskey he’s been sipping. “Merlin, how much did Andromeda tell you about me?”
was going to take some time to get used to.
He had told Ron, who had been eager to go home immediately and write Hermione about his first day, to go ahead right after the last orientation ended. Hermione had decided to go back to school to get her N.E.W.T.s, which came to no surprise to anyone. It was the only part of Auror training that Ron seemed to hate - being apart from her. Still, Harry watched his best friend gape in awe and excitement at everything their mentors said during the sessions.
“I know, I know…” Malfoy said. “Thanks.”
Potter blinked a few times, shaking his head slightly. “Ah...Sorry. Don’t know what that was.”
,” he said as his eyes darted around the shop again. “This is owned by a wizard?”
Astoria scoffed. “Yeah, when they were away from each other for months. You’re literally seeing him after your shift, and he still walked his arse over to an owl post office to send this to you.
“Three years ago... I didn’t really formally come out. I sort of just...got tired of hiding it when people were going to hate me either way and kissed a bloke in the middle of Diagon Alley. Word spread fast.”
“Piles of mail from fans?”
Hermione and Ron continued complaining about their jobs, and Harry watched them, amused. He sipped at his cup of tea and thought of how it felt like he was in the Gryffindor Common Room again, listening to Hermione complain about a class curriculum or Ron go on about an essay he doesn’t want to start.
He had actively avoided thinking about Malfoy in those 20 minutes. And avoided trying to figure out why he was feeling irritated. So, by the time he saw Malfoy reach the fourth floor where Harry was sitting cross-legged in front of Teddy’s room and fidgeting with the mirror in his pocket, he had mostly convinced himself that he was overthinking it. Mostly.
left.”
“Hey, kid,” Draco yawned, ruffling Teddy’s turquoise hair. He looked up to see Potter standing in front of them, holding out a mug of coffee.
Potter, rushing to get ready for work after realizing how late he’d be, had left shortly after Draco had woken up despite Andromeda’s protests that he should have brunch with them. Draco, on the other hand, hadn’t minded Potter leaving early. If he wasn’t there, then Draco could just pretend that everything was normal. Pretend that he hadn’t spent the previous night watching Muggle films with Potter and trying to ignore the fact that he was getting attracted to him.
She shrugged as she started to put her dark brown hair up in a ponytail as she always did when it was nearly time for her to get back to her shift after a break. “You love me.”
Draco wanted to press on but a shrill ring interrupted the quiet. It was coming from Potter’s bag.
“Why?”
There was a tiny hitch in his breath as he applied it onto the toned curves of Potter’s shoulders. If Potter noticed, he didn’t say anything.
Ron raised his eyebrows at him.
The three of them sat around the kitchen table, his friends eyeing Harry curiously.
“Jesus, that’s a relief
Hermione squeezed his hand before letting go. “We know that, Harry.”
“Why?”
Ron sighed, but took a step back and gestured for Harry to come in.
Malfoy shifted from one foot to another awkwardly. “Er… Yeah… Yaxley.”
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked.
Harry raised an eyebrow. “You said you don’t do double shifts.”
“You’re being dramatic again. I’m just asking!”
“Malfoy. I… I’m sorry for still going to this one,” was all Harry could manage.
Harry smiled. “Me too, mate.”
“Harry! I haven’t seen you in a while!”
Harry stood up and walked to his godson, scooping him up into his arms. “Nightmares?”
“I almost sold this whole place. Nearly took the first offer I got,” Harry found himself whispering into the empty room. He leaned against one of the bedposts. “It was too much, you know? Thinking about how you hated the childhood you experienced in these rooms, how the Order had you cooped in this place, how we hid here, terrified for our lives when we were on the run... Everything about this house just..revolted me.
“Yeah. He wrote a
“Is it because you feel guilty for going after things you want that have nothing to do with being an Auror because you still feel like you owe the wizarding world this heroic image of you that they have?” slipped out of Draco’s mouth before he could stop himself.
Harry forced out a laugh. As he continued to watch Malfoy, noticing how he looked like he was glowing in the warm kitchen light, Harry
Potter rolled his eyes. “
“Like I’m going to get in trouble again!”
“I... Nothing. Sorry, I don’t know,” he mumbled as he looked away, fiddling with the shard in his pocket even more. But when he felt Malfoy’s hand on his wrist, he returned his gaze to him.
As he swallowed a mouthful of the spaghetti bolognese Potter had whipped up for them he looked across the kitchen table and scrunched up his nose as if to say
She squeezed his hand. “Look, we’ll talk soon, okay? It’ll be fine. I just need to go after Ron right now. Will you be okay?”
Harry burst out laughing. “Fine. We can watch something else.”
Lucius Malfoy had completely ignored the innocence and genuine curiosity of his child and smacked him across the face before sending him to his room without dinner. The next day, he had only allowed Draco out
“Yeah, yeah. Of course. I’ll be there,” Potter assured, before ending the call and getting up.
Harry was restless as he waited for Ron or Hermione to open the door. The nerves were starting to get to him, albeit not as intensely as the day before. If his friends didn’t live in a wizarding neighborhood where passers-by could easily notice him if he just stood there and strike up a conversation he didn’t have the energy for, he probably would have stayed outside longer, taking too much time to ring the doorbell.
Draco cleared his throat. “Well, uh…”
Harry couldn’t remember the last time someone in his life called Malfoy
Andromeda rolled her eyes. “You think you’re so clever, don’t you?”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Well,
She took a deep breath and gave Draco a small smile. “Alright. If you say so.”
, mother.”
“Oh. Er… Well...”
“Another bouquet for your girl?” Tina, the florist he had befriended through all his visits in the past years, asked. “She liked orchids, right?”
He kept his eyes open, but the images in his head continued. Less vivid, but still there. The Forbidden Forest. Endless trees. Then, black robes. A green light.
been a crap friend.”
Draco shrugged. “No problem.”
Hermione squinted at him with a mischievous smirk. “Whatever, I’ll get it out of you.”
Hermione frowned. “Hey, don’t give me that face. You
“You’re friends with that girl who does administrative work for the Wizengamot, right?” Harry asked.
The worry in his mother’s eyes and the softness that crept into her voice got to him. He couldn’t keep lying.
, he thought to himself.
She laughed. “Yeah, sorry ‘bout that.”
-u can find me at @	ginnywcasleys (changed my url) on tumblr! ur welcome to talk to me abt the fic, bother me until i update, etc etc
Teddy got up from Astoria’s lap and turned to her. “Will you tell me more when I’m finished?”
He hated knowing that. It felt like the pit in his chest was getting deeper.
Draco went back to hammering nails into the wall for the framed pictures Potter wanted to hang up. “Just because Teddy is perfectly fine sleeping in your room doesn’t mean we can keep procrastinating.”
Draco’s heart started to speed up a bit at that. He dropped his gaze, trying to appear preoccupied with his food as he poked at it with his fork. There was no way he could look Potter in the eye right now without his face betraying anything he’d rather keep to himself. “Yeah. You will.”
,” his voice sounded strained as he said it, “then I can tolerate him.”
At that, Harry felt like his chest was suddenly taking up too much of his body, and he didn’t know why.
Harry was better. Objectively, speaking.
Ron frowned. “Yeah, Hermione. Really?”
Potter smiled, and it was enough for Draco to convince himself this wasn’t a completely terrible idea. “Great!”
He jogged down the stairs, already preparing himself for another smug comment from Andromeda about how much time he and Malfoy were spending together and how she was to thank. But, when he opened the door, Ron and Hermione’s cheery faces greeted him.
He wanted to say
- ty for the kind comments and all the kudos!!! nothing motivates me more huhu i rly appreciate it!
Harry laughed. “You’re underestimating the general public and the media. They can easily give both of us trouble without much of an effort.”
Harry settled his sleeping godson onto the couch and covered him with a blanket before responding to Ginny. Andromeda had left him with Harry at Grimmauld Place earlier that day. Harry had been spending time with him every couple of days since he quit. He was the only one he couldn’t bear to stay away from.
“Just take it away from me. Get rid of it. You were right, I shouldn’t have it. It just brings back crap memories.”
She grinned. “You know me well... I guess Hogwarts is a way cooler place to work in anyway. I miss the food. The food is definitely a point for Hogwarts.”
“Nah. Only went out a few months. None of my relationships really lasted a significant amount of time. It’s either the angry letters from father in Azkaban get to me or the fact that I was a Death Eater starts to bother them. Not exactly the ideal bachelor.”
When they got to the fourth floor where Harry’s bedroom and Sirius’ old room are, Malfoy groaned. “I forgot how many floors this place has.”
She squeezed his arm. “Definitely. I don't know if it’s those meetings or something else, but...Whatever it is, I can tell you’re doing really good. And I’m happy for you.”
The door opened and Harry’s eyes flew open. Through the mirror, he could see Draco Malfoy standing behind him.
But this was different. It’s
“Exactly.”
“Slughorn is retiring after this year and McGonagall said she’s been really happy with the work I’ve been doing, so…”
Harry pictured having a wand pointed at him again, his life on the rope, or having someone else’s life depending on every move he made. He felt his heart fall to the bottom of his stomach at the familiarity of it.
“Are you sure about this?” Malfoy asked, pocketing the shard.
Draco grimaced. “Bold of him to say that when your team kept him from, you know, dying.”
“Er...Are you alright?” Draco asked.
Draco didn’t realize that he’d been eating his food without saying a single word for about five minutes now until Potter laughed.
There was Andromeda scolding Teddy about trying to dump the broccoli he was ordered to eat under the table. (
“You and I both. I miss you and Hermione a lot… Thanks for always trying to reach out. It means a lot, especially when I’ve been a crap friend.”
Now, they were sitting on the floor by the bay window on opposite sides of a pile of items. They had emptied out Sirius’ wardrobe, dressers, shelves, and trunk. It was mostly a mix of old clothes, books, records, and letters from Sirius’ early Hogwarts years and the few items he had when the Order of the Phoenix was stationed here.
Anything that would count as an outlet for this thing festering in him.
“Ah, come on, mate-”
Draco had told himself after talking to Astoria that he’d keep it casual. He had decided that he could still be friends with him, but he didn’t have to spend every other day with him.
don’t hate you,” Potter mumbled.
He looked up to see Malfoy with a pile of documents in his arms. Seeing him around had been a norm for Harry because Malfoy worked on the same floor as the Auror Office, but they had never actually spoken since his first day.
“Hah. I guess so.”
And in my defense, I had just finished a 12-hour shift and felt like throwing up from exhaustion. Didn’t exactly have a big appetite then.”
“What about you? Why have you been avoiding your friends?”
Draco scowled. “You know, I thought you’d at least be a little helpful.”
“You’re right!” Ron exclaimed from the armchair he was sitting in.
Harry looked at Ron questioningly as Hermione and Malfoy continued to talk about Andromeda.
Ignoring Malfoy’s comment, he grabbed the receipt from Malfoy’s hand before tossing it in the dustbin.
“Everyone?” he asked, stepping into the house and closing the door behind him.
Draco smiled at the thought but shook his head. “It’s alright. I have to head back to my place and change for work. I technically have the morning shift this month, but I just took the morning off because I promised Andromeda I’d come over for brunch.”
“Well enough to see you lot, yeah. I feel like… Like this time I can actually keep the momentum of meeting up with and talking to other people once I try again. So, I reckon I should. And I want to.”
“I know you've moved on from Ginny and that you haven’t talked to her in months,” she said, interrupting him. “So, there are zero other reasons for you to seem so anxious and have that look on your face when we’re talking about your dating life here. You're not like this unless there's someone-”
Harry’s heart thudded wildly in his chest at the feel of Malfoy’s thumb against his lower lip. He looked at Malfoy, at the softness of his gaze and the curl of his lip, and felt the riot in his own chest unceasing. Nagging. Telling him,
They were little things, but he knew that they were telling. Potter, thankfully, seemed to be the most oblivious person in the world.
“I’ve been babysitting Teddy alone for four years,” Potter said, exasperated. “And shouldn’t Teddy be asleep by now?”
Harry looked up at Malfoy who was only now wearing a crisp black shirt tucked neatly into his tapered trousers. He grinned at Harry, and Harry felt a strange tug in his chest.
The faux nonchalance faded from Hermione’s face, making way for a pity. “Oh, Harry…”
“Er, okay…I...I see your eyes,” he stammered out before he could stop himself.
“I’m sorry. I couldn’t sleep, and...It just
Laughing, Potter took a sip and set his drink down on the coffee table. “He’s asleep. He hasn’t woken up in the middle of the night since he was two. A glass won’t hurt.”
Before Draco could get up, he noticed something glinting in Potter’s hand. It was a mirror shard reflecting light. The shard’s edges were covered in something dark and liquid. Draco squinted a little, just enough for him to see it was blood, coming from a long and deep gash on his palm.
sorry for the wait! for what it's worth this chapter ended up like... twice as long as i had planned.
Breathe in, breathe out. In, out. In, out.  “Christ, not now.”
Malfoy smiled. “Thank you, I guess.”
Malfoy snickered before sighing. "No, really. I'm glad you worked it out...And that I don't have to worry about Weasley attacking me next time I see him."
“Wait.”
Andromeda smirked triumphantly before leaving the room.
Harry perked up. “Really?”
“I think… I just never allowed myself to heal and grow the way all of you did. All of you are doing what you love and actively working on all this hurt we have to fucking carry around. I never did that. I spent the past few years forcing myself to still be this heroic figure that the Ministry can use and that strangers can count on. But now, I just need to figure out who I am and how I can heal outside all of that.”
“What do you
Harry scoffed. “You’re joking, right? Have you
He took a deep breath. "I just...I just wanted to say that I’m sorry.”
Ron scoffed. “This is Draco Malfoy we’re talking about. Anything short of punching that git in the face is already too friendly for me. But if you two say the bloke’s alright, then I guess I’ll have to wait and see, won’t I?” he said the last few words through his teeth.
Harry smiled. “He’s been...It’s been good for me too.”
This is the prologue chapter, offering glimpses into Harry's post-war life so far before the story truly starts.
- as always ty so much for all the motivation via ur comments and kudos!!!!!! u guys are mvps im honestly so thankful.
“Well I’m not an
“Thanks. I guess you aren’t the worst after all,” Potter said, with a small smile.
“What?” Harry asked. “
Potter smirked. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you just want to work with me because you’d miss me otherwise.”
“W-what? That’s…Why would you even-” To hear it said aloud for the first time was too much. His mouth was too dry now. And the room was suddenly too hot. Harry stood up - a bit too abruptly and carelessly, his hips jolting the table a little - and stammered out an excuse about having to go.
Harry dropped the pictures he had in his hands as he felt his skin grow cold. Not a lot of people knew or noticed. Just Andromeda, Ron, and Hermione. “What? No, I…”
“Just...Next time you befriend someone I thought we
She scrunched up her face. “Right. Okay, maybe the Malfoy of it all is another story. But he’ll come around if you do choose to tell him.”
Potter was staring at his hands. His brows were furrowed, and his shoulders were heaving as if he was out of breath.
He expected Potter to make a face and retort with a snarky comment, but he just beamed at Draco, eyes sincere. “No. Just in general.”
“Guess so,” Potter replied, looking the slightest bit amused. “This is… This is weird.”
wasn’t going to say it.”
“I know that you're an adult now and that you’ve dealt with heartbreak before. And while being in the public eye, at that. You’re resilient. And smart. And these are experiences you’re meant to have at your age...But this is different. For sure, you know that too, don’t you, darling?”
“You should have seen him when he was a baby. There was a point when Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and I slept here for most of the week to help Andromeda. Teddy woke up screaming every other hour.”
Draco raised his eyebrows. “
“I’m suddenly thankful all I’ve witnessed were varying hair and eye colours.”
Harry’s eyes shot open. “Really?”
She rolled her eyes. “Remember that talk we had last week?”
Before he could reach his closet, there was a tap on the window. Harry jumped, but then saw it was just the Malfoys' owl again.
Malfoy snorted. “Well, I am rather tired of patching you up all the time.”
“But you loved her. And it was real.”
Potter beamed. “Exactly.”
“Right. Sorry,” Harry muttered as he let go.
He thought back to all the times Hermione visited Malfoy’s department when they all worked at the Ministry. Harry never questioned why, even though that was the reason he came to her to ask about him when Malfoy quit. Harry had always just assumed it was because she was friends with the woman Malfoy worked with. She certainly never corrected him. “You...You never mentioned it.”
Finally, Hermione closed her book. “Anyway, I found this new Indian restaurant that-”
Harry chuckled to himself, shaking his head. He didn’t know why the prospect of spending time with Draco Malfoy made him less anxious than the thought of seeing Ron and Hermione. But he didn’t want to deal with that now.
“Okay!” Teddy practically flew out of the room, mumbling a quick goodbye to Astoria.
“That’s good. Just wanted to know if I should be feeling guilty about all the unpaid labor I’ve been making you do,” Potter said, grinning.
Malfoy shrugged. “No problem.” He stood up and extended a hand to Harry.
“You’re terrible at apologies,” Ron murmured, but Harry could see he was suppressing a smirk.
“That Uncle Dwaco was here!”
Staying with his mother wasn’t his first choice when it came to living arrangements. Draco had moved into this house as soon as he got his first job at the Ministry. Living alone had been liberating.
“She’s alright,” Potter said without slowing down. “Her nephew- the kid of Ted’s brother - got in a minor car accident. Nothing serious, but he has to spend the night in a hospital and his parents are out of town, so she has to stay with him.”
Malfoy’s eyes widened, and he pulled away. “Right, sorry. I forgot…” He cleared his throat, looking away for a few moments. “Er...Two things you can smell?”
promise that."
Harry stared at him with his mouth open, not sure what to say. He didn’t know why Malfoy was acting like this wasn’t new information. “Was I supposed to know this?”
“It is,” Draco said, looking at the small grin on Potter’s face.
“For what it’s worth, if it was otherwise, you wouldn’t be doing all the good that you’re doing now.”
,” she said, half-singing the last word.
So, almost a year after Lucius’ death, Draco still didn’t know what to feel. There was still so much anger in him, but there was also sadness. It felt like obligatory sadness, as if there was a voice in his head telling him
were so young. And Harry was starting to live a whole other part of life that his parents will never experience.
“I didn’t think you’d still be up,” Draco said as he walked into the kitchen to find his mother nursing a glass of wine at the kitchen island. She was in silk pyjamas, and her long blonde hair was neatly braided down her back. He was always stunned at how regal she looked, even now, in her sleepwear at midnight.
“Thanks… But it’s not really what I want to do in the long-run.”
“Don’t worry, Malfoy. I always was the better Seeker.”
“In the living room, darling!”
Malfoy looked at him quizzically.
She shook her head. “Come in, everyone’s in the kitchen. And dinner’s almost ready.”
“And I’m sure you’ll be equally as nauseating with the next girl,” she added.
Malfoy nodded slowly, sighing. “Yes.”
“Yeah, yeah…” Draco fiddled with the leaves of the potted plant next to him. Talking about Potter with her was strange. “He’s...good.”
Smiling sadly, Potter looked at Draco. “You should take your own advice.”
Harry couldn’t help himself. He couldn’t be alone with his thoughts. The need to share or talk about it wasn’t even there; he just needed to be around people who were experiencing this much grief too.
“Hah. Yeah. Alright.”
“I’m taking the bus, I swear!”
Silence hung around them; Draco didn’t know what to say next. Frankly, he was even surprised that they could have a proper conversation. They had learned to be sort of civil to one another when they worked for the Ministry, but it was the first time he didn’t feel like he had to get ready to dodge a hex Potter might throw at any minute. Which he figured he deserved.
When the meeting ended, Harry found himself waiting by the stairway that led up to the building’s entrance. He wasn’t entirely sure why until Malfoy started going down the steps before stopping as he saw Harry.
“Potter.”
“Er, yeah…”
Harry turned to Andromeda. “
“Stop that,” he said before stopping himself.
Harry pressed the button with the number eight on it and turned to Malfoy as the usual female voice said,
She was already walking towards the orchids when Harry said, “Oh, no. We actually...We actually broke up.”
“Well, how is he? Andromeda told me he’s doing better since he quit being an Auror.”
“You… You didn’t go home last night.”
“You talking. Cars outside...Er, people on the sidewalk. The creak of this bloody step,” he said as the wood made the sound at a shift in his weight. He dropped his gaze. It reminded him of the floorboards in Shrieking Shack. The broken windows. Staying under the Invisibility cloak as he watched-
-for those asking, i update once a month! i used to update more frequently but i decided that writing longer chapters at a time worked better for me so yeah! (but i dont mind the ppl messaging me on tumblr to ask abt updates. i need the pressure lmao)
“I love how everyone hates the bike but is somehow alright with the idea that I was on a broom, a hundred feet off the ground, at eleven years old.”
Perplexed, Harry was about to stand up and ask Ron if they could talk alone.
He frowned. "I don't know, Potter."
The moment he was alone in the room for the first time in years, Harry felt himself tense up a bit. He stood up, looking around at the room, and took a deep breath.
it feels to have you back. But...All that still hurt. That just...It doesn’t go away immediately.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Rita Skeeter?” Harry guessed.
Draco blushed, but he just shrugged. “It’s nothing. Been studying this for years, and it’s the least of what I’m expected to know if I’m going to actually
“I… Er… Yeah, okay,” Potter mumbled as soon as he figured that out. “My name is Harry.”
Ron, with a manic, sarcastic grin on his face, looked at Harry. “So, you see this wanker ‘almost every day,’ and I’ve only seen you, what, eight times in the past year?”
"Is he alright?" he asked as he approached the bed, taking a seat on Teddy’s other side. He pressed the back of his hand against Teddy’s forehead then his neck.
Potter looked at the floor.
“I’m sorry.”
“Want to tell me five things you can see?”
But Draco… The moment he was freed from his abusive father, he made the necessary changes in his life. And he was just barely 18 then. You kids that grew up during the war think that who you are by the time you’re 17 is who you are going to be forever. I don’t blame you for that. You all had to grow up so fast. But none of you remember that you were still children at the end of the day. Isn’t who you become after that more important?”
“Er, my hair on my forehead. The stair railing against my back…” His breathing started to slow, and he started to really remember where he was. At this time. In his home. Malfoy here. Then, he realized Malfoy’s hands were still on him, cradling his face. “Your hands…”
Potter shrugged, taking a seat. “A few very short-lived flings… Some dates and hookups here and there. All Muggles of course.”
The wall was now filled with picture frames of different shapes and sizes, the photos showing just how full of love Teddy’s life was: Teddy and Harry posing in front of a huge sandcastle they had made together on a trip to the beach. Teddy and Andromeda sitting crossed-legged in the grass, the two of them laughing as his hair color switched with every sneeze. Teddy walking down Diagon Alley for the first time, gaping at the storefronts, one hand holding Ron’s and the other in Hermione’s.
Draco could probably name what he was feeling right then and there. It’s not like it wasn’t something he had felt for other blokes before. But right now, to call it anything more than the joy he felt around friends was dangerous and scary. Especially because it was Potter of all people and because this moment felt too right to disrupt with that terrifying thought.
“Thanks. I hope so.”
engraved on it still on the door. “Can you-?”
Potter’s smile faded. “Oh, she did?"
He laughed nervously at that. “Sure.”
As he sat in his study and finished penning a reply to Malfoy’s letter, he found that he was actually looking forward to hanging out with him again. He didn’t know what had compelled him to invite him over. Harry hasn’t had anyone over other than Andromeda for a while.
“A bit sore, but a lot better. Thank you,” he said, punctuating his thanks by touching Draco lightly on the wrist.
The thought made him sick to his stomach.
“My room and Sirius’ room have huge windows and don’t have any creepy paintings and decor stuck on the walls that I can’t tear down without the whole room getting destroyed … Also, Sirius has several pictures of his Hogwarts days on his walls. I reckon Teddy recognizes his dad in some of them. ”
He planted a kiss on the top of his mother’s head. “Goodnight.”
Harry walked past him, but just as he was about to leave the room, Malfoy piped up again.
“Well, that does sound like-”
He sat on the edge of the couch by Teddy’s head, running his fingers through the three-year-old’s hair. It was neon green today.
“You aren’t being hypocritical,” Jasmine assured. “After going through traumatic events like loss, distancing yourself from people who were there to witness you at your lowest is completely normal.”
Then, he felt a touch on his shoulder and a creak in the step.
Harry smiled. “Shut up, Malfoy.”
“Hermione.”
Harry took a deep breath. “No, no. He would have found out eventually. Just a tad bit hard to tell a child to always behave when he knows you broke into Gringotts and fled on the back of a dragon like a bloody hypocrite.”
“I can come over and watch him while you visit them for a bit.”
Astoria smiled as she finished pooling all the pink blocks together. “Yeah! For Christmas. I know it’s really early, but I knew Andromeda gets tons of commissions. Just wanted to make sure I could get Daph something special. Haven’t seen her in a while because of her job.”
“This bookshop is just the most charming thing,” she practically cooed. “Have you worked here long?”
This time, Malfoy wasn’t around. He didn’t know whether he liked that or not.
Draco studied the way Potter gazed back at him, feeling paralyzed just at the sight of the other boy looking at him so intently, lips parted and breathing still staggered from his workout. It was too much. He needed to say something.
“Mhmm. Don’t worry, ‘Mione.”
“Yeah,” Potter answered, grinning at Draco. “I think we are.”
Malfoy looked at him, a “please don’t make me do this” expression on his face.
“I believe you,” Harry repeated. “I believe that you’re not who you were years ago. And I know about all the good you’re doing now… I just wanted to say that. For what it’s worth.”
Malfoy scooted around the pile, which was barely a pile anymore with only a few stray items left, getting closer to Harry and placing a comforting hand on Harry’s knee. “You’ll get the hang of it again. It’ll be easier.”
Harry cleared his throat, shuffling awkwardly in his seat. “Well, er… Okay. I’ve been… I made a new friend, actually. And it’s been helping me because this person went through a lot of the same things that I did.”
“Hey Harry!” Hermione pulled him into a hug as Ron patted his arm.
“Fiiiiiine.”
“Ginny,” he mumbled to himself, still confused but also reluctantly nursing a tiny inkling that was barely a full answer at the back of his head.
“The wine I finished before Ron snapped at me and left?”
“And, now, well... He’s sort of my contact at St. Mungos for the policies we’ve been drafting for Muggle-born healthcare. A lot of our official partner Healers are Pureblood higher-ups that never interact with patients. So, I reached out to Draco. We barely talk, really, but he gives me the info I need whenever I ask... All his notes from working with the kids and their families, lists of nurses who actually got to know patients, contact details of Muggle-born Healers who had the time to help us out…”
He parked his motorbike by the center where the meeting was going to take place and walked into the building. Harry didn’t know what he was expecting, but he was still caught off guard by the bright yellow walls and the bulletin boards advertising classes for kids. Before he could worry about the possibility that he might be in the wrong building, he spots a door with a schedule taped to it.
“Because it’s from Sirius. And because I’m scared that if I forget about how my impulsive decisions led to…led to bad things... then I’d make those mistakes again. And more people die.”
“Are you alright?”
“A loss of opportunity for closure or confrontation. Or the loss of someone toward whom we could direct all this pain and trauma they caused us, so now we have to carry it with us, unsure of what to do with all these feelings. We still have the right to grieve that. That doesn’t make you a bad person.”
That seemed to have sobered Ron, even just a bit. He sighed, settling his hands on his hips and staring at the floor. “I don't know, mate…”
“Do you want to finish the Star Wars movies at my place sometime?”
When he turned back to Hermione, she was looking at him with a worried expression.
Draco almost choked on his drink and felt his face go red. “You are
His heartbeat started to pick up, and his ribs felt like closing in on him. Feeling dizzy, he sat down on the bottom step of the staircase.
“I just... I just wanted...You know. To say that,” Harry stammered. What was going on? Why did Malfoy have this effect on him? What
“And I’ll respond this time. I swear.”
Draco sighed. “Yeah, that’s… That’s what I wanted to talk about. There’s an alternate timetable for the group. I know it must be uncomfortable sharing all that when someone you know is in the room. Especially when that person is me.”
He hoped he wasn’t blushing. “You know, not the best movies to introduce to someone who's never seen one before, Potter. Those were chaotic.”
“Yeah,” Potter said, pulling his hand away. “Thanks. Again.”
that git?”
- it took him a while, but he got there! there's still a lotttt of healing and growing and PINING to do though. when i said slow burn i rly wasn't kidding im sorry
“Hey Ron.”
He hadn’t been to any wizarding places. He had only responded to one of the dozens of letters Ron and Hermione had sent. If you asked him when was the last time he had even picked up his wand, he wouldn’t be able to answer.
Hermione laughed, and Harry rolled his eyes, kicking Ron underneath the table. “I’m serious! I think you two could be friends if you tried.”
“What do you mean?”
“Earlier… At the center with that mirror shard and everything… You know that was an anxiety attack, right?”
Ron snorted. “By ‘we’ do you mean me and Harry because we’re crap at this?”
“Sorry I’m late, I-” He stopped, frowning at the room, taking a few cautious steps in. “Wasn’t this…”
