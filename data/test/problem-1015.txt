"I-I'm sorry Draco...I-I won't do it again." Poor girl was there the entire time, scared out of her wits. Draco just hummed, and that was all she needed before grabbing her wand and run off, bawling.
"....I've been seeing her in my dreams." Harry explained.  Snape raised an eyebrow and gestured with his hand for Harry to continue.
"I was just looking through my second book, I have the potion right here." She said as she guided Dumbledoor to the books. He looked distressed.
"Tom, Madaline's death, Edward's sorrow, Everything!" Harry screamed as he held his wand at the pile on the floor.
"Sir..." The twins said in unison softly. Dumbledore seemed to be in memory lane as he looked at the red diamond in his hand.
"Yeah, as ready as I'll every be." He said walking down the hallway. He yawned and rubbed his eyes. The twins looked at eachother than at Harry.
"I suppose. Oh, we still on for tonight? I've got a potion if like to tryout." The twins looked at him weird.
"Hmm...eels breath and dragon scales could create an enhancement in steel, but I'm not entirely sure which the other ingredients." George said reading it over.
"As I was saying." He started. The class paid attention to Snape, but Harry was still curious as to whom produced the sound. He looked to his right and found Malfoy's eyes on him.
"Unhand him." Cedric said coldly, pressing the wand tighter under her chin. Pansy kept her hard glare on Harry as she slowly let him go. Harry moved backwards, out of reach when pansy went for her wand.
Harry was walking next to Professor Croft in the dungeon, watching her hum pleasantly as she turned the coner and saw Professor Rimplestein. Harry looked surprised at the man, whom looks much more happier and had a light glow to his face. His shoulder length hair was slicked back, looking almost a shade darker as his eyes where a bright green, almost like a cat. He was a good few inches taller than Madeline and had a sweet smile that showed his affection towards the woman in front of him.
"....Do you know what this is professor?" Harry asked, looking up at him. Dumbledore glanced at Harry.
"This way Harry." George called behind himself as Fred and him snuck through a branch and stopped on the other side of it. Snape and Harry followed after them and were shocked by the beauty of the sight. It was the lake, just as Harry had dreamt it.
"Professor, was there anywhere she frequent? A lake perhaps?" Harry asked hopefully. Dumbledore looked at him questionably.
"Of course not profess- Atchew!" A sneeze snuck up on Draco and he covered Proffessor Snape's robe sleeve in green slime.
"The creator....Was her name Madeline Croft?" Harry asked, watching Dumbledore's reaction. He looked shocked, then collected himself.
".....Madeline." He said as a tear fell. he leaned against the painting, the cool metal of the frame giving Ed a pleasant feeling on his face.
"It was all professor Rimplestein's fault. I never trusted him for a second." She said. Harry looked confused.
"It is not fine Harry, I will not allow them to treat you so harshly. Damn muggles." Draco growled, causing himself to cough harshly. Harry softly rubbed Draco's chest.
"I've seen her in my dreams. What can you tell me about her?" Harry asked carefully. Dumbledore glanced at Harry, and then the twins before snapping his fingers. The place where the caldron was, was replaced by a couch and a comfy chair. Dumbledore sat in the chair, gesturing for the twins and Harry to sit. After they all sat down, Dumbledore began to speak.
"Let's just get off this bloody train." Harry went out of his compartment and came face to chest with Draco.
"Yes....I got it." He trailed off as his eyes rolled to the back of his head, and he felt himself falling.
"You, my foolish young Gryffidor, will not act as a hero for once, and will inform me of any new information your dreams give you. And I believe you said something about advanced potions and spells in your dreams correct? If I find you trying to recast or make anything you find there, I will make sure your punishment is harsh." Snape warned.
"Wings? Harry you nearly drowned until Malfoy pulled you put. Then Hagrid carried you to the nurses station." Harry looked confused.
"Alright I want a clean and fun game. Alright? Ready, set, " The referee said throwing the ball up in the air.
"I know Love, please rest." Harry said kissing Draco's sweaty brow. Draco held Harry close and closed his eyes.
"You see Harry, veelas do not completely become an adult until their, well, as they would say, puberty. Mister Malfoy has gone through puberty through the summer, which for a veela, is a painful experience." He said, causing Draco unwanted memories.
"What's the matter potter, never seen a veela before?" He asked as he flapped his wings and flew him out the hole.
"You'd best keep your tone appropriate, you are standing in front of a malfoy." He said snootily. Harry scoffed and started pulling on draco's arm.
"I was lucky enough to speak with Professor Slughorn about the subject and came to find that one of our lovely Professors at this school written a certain book to inform on the subject, more specifically on how to create them." Tom said stepping foreward. Edward stepped back.
"...I love you." Harry said blushing. Draco smiled brightly as he grabbed Harry carefully and planted a kiss on his lips." Harry nearly lost control of his broom before Draco pulled back with his famous Malfoy smirk.
"We found it in a lake sir." Harry said. Dumbledore finally ripped his eyes from the necklace in Snape's hand to look at Harry.
"I've sent a patronous potter, they should be on their way back, and maybe, if your excuse is good enough, I won't tell Severus about your little adventure."
"Draco!" Harry said appalled, taking draco's arm. Draco looked off in the distance, acting innocently. Harry sighed and looked at Cedric.
"I'm sorry, but can someone please explain to me what is going on before I loose my head?" Harry asked abit angerly.
Draco and Snape managed to pull Harry out before the flames could get him, but unfortunately the smoke had its effect and Harry soon found himself unconscious again.
"Alright Harry, we will see you on the other side." Harry smiled as they got on the boat and rowed off.
"I say we find Professor Croft's room and see what is left there. There are still so many questions that were left unanswered." Harry said exasperated.
Harry waited for the twins in the room of requirement. He felt abit guilty for not telling Draco about the dreams, but he felt he had to do this himself. Although the twins were unplanned. They always seemed to know what he was up too.
"Harry!" Harry looked to the side to see his beloved mate, Draco. Draco was flying next to him, his wings ruffling in the breeze.
"Pansy!" He roared, making his way down the hallway. She visibly jumped, hearing footsteps behind her retreat. In a matter of moments, Draco was glaring down at her.
"We are not harming my mate." Harry said firmly as he headed up to his room. The twins looked at eachother and shrugged before going to their rooms.
"I'll see you later" Draco said softly to Harry before he leaned in to kiss him, but stopped before he could, remembering he was contagious. He leaned up and kissed Harry's forehead before giving him a small smile and headed out. Harry frowned, worried for Draco, also worried what Snape was going to do to him.
"Indeed it has, I am sorry I haven't visited often." Dumbledore said lightly. Ravenclaw looked behind Dumbledore to see Snape and four students.
They stopped in front of the sleeping woman. Harry waited a second before clearing his throat loudly enough to wake the woman. Madam Ravenclaw yawned and stretched as she was awoken.
"As if you'd ever stop to impress me," Harry laughed, before he turned serious once again. "So you've heard what happened?"
"Thanks for coming here right away everyone. We have a mission of the utmost urgency, an order from very high up the ranks," Robards said, shuffling urgently through a few documents on the table in front of him until he found the parchment he was looking for. "You'll team up with your partner, every team gets a list with names on them. I want you to find those people and bring them here, all of them. No exception! If everything works out you won't need to use any force, but as always, you need to be prepared. I can't promise that for all of them."
Harry had barely time to get dressed after his shower before Draco was calling to him from the kitchen where he most definitely cleaned the mess Harry had left behind after eating his dinner.
The minutes slogged by, slow as hours, and by the time an individual finally stepped onto the platform the entire Atrium was filled with so much nervous tension that Harry could nearly reach out and grab it. Magic coursed and coiled through the air, prickly on Harry's skin.
Harry had said he'd be right back, leaving him alone in a crowded place in fucking Florida of all places, and then he was gone.
But having Draco here for Christmas somehow still felt like too much to handle considering everything.
"A mix of a XXL Slime Bomb and Portable Swamp. George is still working on it," Ron replied, hiding a chuckle. "It's supposed to be for our Halloween line. But the red colour still dyes everything for more than 72 hours and so it's a pain in the arse to get rid of."
They watched as Ron's Jack Russell Terrier ran off. Then they waited for their backup to arrive through the Floo. Having nothing to do but wait, Harry started to read the book titles on the shelf next to him. "So Necromancy is a top seller it seems. So many books on that topic. And Crup breeding? How are those books even on the same shelf?"
It didn't matter. His friend's lives and futures were more important. Harry decided that he could still make up a random story if he got caught. "
"Well, once we have to stay here he'll do it without anyone asking," Draco answered, laughter in his voice "I just wish we had an elf. They could take care of this place for us, make it a bit more liveable. A bit more hospitable. "
"Because this one here started to go fetid," Draco explained. "Boiled caterpillar bodies and Mandrake root? It'll leak deathly gases if it's not cleaned soon."
Just as Ron shrugged, the Floo in the backroom flared up and two wizards from the DMLE showed up to take Mr Peck with them. They were stony faced and serious, not even asking any questions about the old wizard's state.
"Partially," she spat out, her eyes darting around the room. She looked like a Horntail caught in a poacher's cage.
This morning when Dudley had gotten up, everything seemed fine. He had begun to feel rough after his lunch break. He'd gotten worse by the minute. And by the time someone noticed his miserable state it was nearly time for him to leave anyway, so they sent him home early with an order to get some rest.
"I love you," Harry blurted out, knowing that it was true, knowing that he had loved him for a while now but had been too blind to see it. "I just want to go home with you. And maybe get my face fixed first. Please, Draco. I'm really sorry. Let's just—"
For most of his life, the sight of Draco's wand pointing in his direction would have sent him straight into battle mode, but now Harry wasn't even slightly concerned about it. Funny how things had changed.
"Of course I'll stay," Harry smiled. Maybe he'd stick to talking to Narcissa for the night. Harry felt like she was the least exhausting member of the family. And they had shared a moment in the forest, so it couldn't be worse than that.
Ginny stood from her seat next to Harry and, much to Harry's horror, called Draco to sit in her spot.
Letting his arm sink back to his side, Draco took a step back and took a deep breath. This was the last thing he needed. Another lesson in Muggle culture. Damned be the Ministry and their decision to make this part of his probation.
Harry was grateful he didn't get to see what they we're doing, a huge blanket blocked their view to Draco's lower parts. But the noises, and the shaking of Draco's body was enough to give Harry a good idea of what the Healers were doing down there.
Harry was already in his bed when a rather impatient knock on his door forced him back out of his warm sheets.
Harry took his sweet time letting his fingers grace over every inch of skin he could reach, ignoring Draco's begs to finally fuck him. Harry had waited long enough for him to come back, and he'd take every minute he could get.
"The others will be here in a minute, just wanted to make sure you're presentable," Draco muttered, failing to look in Harry's direction. His house mate was too busy rummaging through a cupboard to look for glasses.
"Yes, sir. Would you mind dreadfully if I take the rest of the week off? This news has come as quite a shock, and Draco is sick too. The Mufflemumps. Quite a severe case."
"We're obviously investigating some kind of big Death Eater ring, mate," Ron replied. "It's only logical that he'd ask you about him. His family were mixed up with Dark wizardry for generations."
Leaning his head against Draco's, Harry took a deep breath. This time it needed to be different. They were friends now, weren't they? They were a team. Neither man had to carry the weight on their shoulders alone anymore. Harry yawned into the back of his hand, suddenly exhausted. "Let's go to bed. We need to be well rested tomorrow. There's a lot to do."
"But of course, Mr Potter," Robards answered, the relief visible in his expression. "You've both worked a lot lately... You too, Mr Weasley. Please, take the rest of the week off and come back next Monday. We'll manage without you for now."
Harry watched as Ron sprinted into the kitchen and came back with a huge casserole hovering in front of him, and it smelled absolutely delicious. Together they left the small house to go back to Grimmauld Place. Luckily they arrived right in time to stop Greg from prepping a quick lunch for everyone.
"What happened Harry?" Hermione asked, her face a mask of worry as she joined them. "You look like you've seen a ghost."
"I'm honestly surprised it took this long," Draco sighed as he finally accepted Harry's offered hand to get up.
A short look through the pages came up with absolutely nothing. Harry couldn't find a single article. There was nothing. Not a paragraph, not a sentence. Not a single word about what had happened, and there had been more than enough time to fill half the newspaper with facts, figures and photos if necessary.
By the time Harry managed to calm down he was hiccuping so badly that Draco had to open the windows, and let some fresh air in so Harry could finally catch his breath again.
"I'm sorry you lost him," Draco said, his voice quiet and thoughtful. Harry watched as the blond man ghosted his own finger over the name. "I'm sorry you lost all of them all. I hope we can end whatever this is before we lose so many people again."
" knowing that his stag might be able to light up the room well enough to see who they were casting their spells at, and more critically, how they could hit them and hopefully distract them enough to keep Robards safe.
"Can I turn off the flames underneath my cauldrons before I come back home to find the damn things exploded?" She gave the pair of them a withering glare.
Spinning around, he found Pansy leaning in the open door.The witch was watching them with a raven-like grin that made him snort.
When the door finally opened, Harry nearly jumped back and he had to try everything to suppress the urge to run away. He pulled the rough edges of his bravery tighter.
"Thanks, I know. Pretty sure I didn't sleep at all last night." Sending the memo off, Harry watched it fly out of the door before he yawned hugely into his fist. "If anyone asks why I'm as tired as a tormented troll then it's because Draco is sick, and he kept me awake all night. That there was his sick note."
Around the fifth month Harry hadn't had to focus anymore to see Draco's growing tummy. He loved lazing around in bed, and letting his fingers wander over Draco's new curves, enjoying the feeling of soft skin underneath his fingertips and the love he felt for his husband and the tiny human growing inside of him.
Three hours later, he stood in front of the Burrow with a bag in his hands, looking like the ordeal of the last hours hadn't happened.
Ron's triumphant "Aha!" distracted Harry for a second, and when he turned back to argue with Draco, the wizard had already slipped out of the room.
His night's sleep had been shit, to say the very least. He had been haunted by vivid, vicious nightmares, the scenes of Kingsley's home playing over and over again, spiked with the high-pitched laugh of Voldemort and sickening memories of the Battle of Hogwarts.
A quiet whimper from next to him made Harry snap out of his rage. Malfoy looked miserable. His face was pale as he stared back and forth between his father and Harry.
They were alive, and they'd have dinner tonight, and things would be fine. They had the rest of their lives and Harry didn't think he'd ever been so grateful just to exist.
"Fucking hell Finnigan! What did you do?" Blaise screamed as sparks flew up and singed his trousers.
"I can fuck you over your kitchen table while you stare at the half eaten plate your father left behind if that's what you want?" Harry huffed. "But I barely think this will help us."
The problem is that I'd very much prefer the company of anyone who isn't a woman at my side for the rest of my life.
"I know what I did. I don't mind having this arrangement. It looks like stuff like that is rather common in the Wizarding World. Your name is cleared through this
"We won't. We have to take you in for questioning though," Harry said, watching as Mr Peck's face fell. Many different emotions played on his expressions.
When Dean and Neville finally showed up, Harry couldn't stop the yawn that he'd been trying to hold back for the last hour or so breaking free. He knew that he'd be grateful to finally get out of his wet clothes and into a warm bed soon.
"Not a joke, hi Draco." Harry smiled and reached out his hand for Draco to shake. "I'm Harry Potter and will be your boyfriend for the day. If that's okay?"
Feeling his knees give in, Dudley sank to the floor with a groan. All he could hear was a stressed out "Fuck" before he passed out on the spot.
They went to the cinema and visited friends. Had a nice night out with a romantic dinner, and a stroll through the park near their house. And then Harry went and got some stickers and pictures for the nursery, deciding the walls were too empty.
"Don't ask me if you can bring it back. It's open for everyone, and we'll help as best we can. But Mr Potter, you must realise that soon a lot of young people will be back on this grounds, and we cannot, and will not, leave them unprotected at any time. I'll need all my professors here to keep my children safe. You of all people know that our students come first. "
Looking over at Draco, Harry sent a big grin in his direction. Together they began to lead everyone towards the lifts, accompanied by Ron and Hermione to their left, and Pansy and Blaise to their right.
And Harry felt quite overwhelmed by the situation. Seeing this was even more frightening than the Dementors this morning. At least they were true to their nature, vile and dark as they were.
"Potter had some very concerning news today. News that'll affect all of us," Draco grumbled, gazing around at his fellow Slytherins.
Malfoy sighed but didn't say another word about Harry's jeans and Band-Shirt combo. "Are we ready to go then?"
"You have a rather spectacular business going here," Harry noted, not even trying to hide how impressed he was with the elderly witch.
"Okay. That's something. But never do that again without telling us first. Stuff like that needs to be planned, and not done in a rush. You've always been the most impetuous wizard I've ever met," Hermione sighed. "And what, dare I ask, was your problem with Draco?"
After Harry had finished the story, which, to be fair, sounded more like an official Auror report at this point than anything else, heavy silence blanketed their assembly for many minutes as each of the Professors were trapped in their own thoughts.
Once in the lift, Harry waited to see if someone would follow him onto it. But thankfully he was the only one needing a ride. Pulling a memo and a pen out of his pocket, Harry hurriedly jotted a message to Draco, telling him to join him at the door leading to his department, and he sent it off. He wouldn't make the same mistake again and stumble into the labyrinthine department without knowing where to go.
"Oh don't worry, I understand. Arthur is the same occasionally. He just goes to his shed then. Not me. I like to hear the bustling of life all around me. Please come over whenever you feel like it. And for Merlin's sake call me Molly."
One of Crouch's curses hit Harry square in the face and he could hear the bastard laugh as he felt blood drop down his cheek and temple. Only then did the pain start to kick in, and Harry let out a scream as the frenzied attack came even more forcefully than before, making Crouch struggle to keep up. Landing a few hits, Harry grinned dirty as he saw Crouch flinch with pain.
"You're never safe with them around." Ron shook his head. "Snakes, the whole lot of them. They're always plotting how to embarrass us."
But Lucius Malfoy obviously wasn't done yet. "How about now? I can arrange for an official to arrive in less than five minutes."
"You didn't think it'd be that easy, did you Potter?" the cold voice said. "I have the entire Ministry at my hands. I have a few surprises left for you."
"Mrs Robards," Harry started, slowly, making sure she understood every word. "Do you know who I am?"
Pinching the brig of his nose, Harry sighed. "Lovely to see you too, Malfoy. No need to thank me, honestly. It's my pleasure."
"Bad. I'd say you got him just in time. I don't know if he'd have made another night out there. But there's nothing that we can't fix with some time and care. I gave him some potions, and instructions on how to take them. I'll give you the instructions to remind him to take them and how to care for him. The Ministry broke his wand, he's not welcome in our world anymore, I can't take him to St. Mungo`s. But I'll come over every evening for the next few days to check on him."
“Goodbye, Draco,” Luna responded with a smile, even though it was unlikely that he had heard her response.
"Of course not, Luna, I would've texted you if I had," Harry stated, "Also, I was enjoying looking at all the murals,"
While he worked there, he was pretty sure it was the happiest he had been in his entire life. Delicately piecing together bouquets of Iris', Carnations, Lilys, and Snapdragons. He liked making things that were beautiful. It made him feel a little bit less like the horrid person he was, because, if he could make something like this with his own hands? Well, maybe he wasn't all that bad after all. maybe...
Harry, having only been half paying attention and the fact that it was 9am on a Tuesday and his brain could barely process any information in general, he knew he would have to ask Luna where things were again in the near future.
"I'm not gay for Draco," Harry protested, but he didn't really put his heart into it, knowing that what Ron had said was at least half true,
And that's how Draco ended up here, standing alone in front of Hogwarts on the second day of school. Draco slowly let out a nervous breath, "Let's do this," He whispered to himself, and with that, he walked forward, the doors to the school swinging open, and he entered, holding his head high.
"But- But what about the shop? I won't be able to work here any more if I leave! You'll be short staffed!"
"C'mon, mate, loosen up a little, we haven't seen these people in ages! The least we can do is have a little fun!"
Harry had been looking forward to attending his 8th year at Hogwarts. He was excited to spend one more year with his friends before he was forced to face the real world. He was excited for meals in the great halls, because dang they always had such good food. So why had his mood been dampened slightly when he hadn't seen Malfoy? And why had it decreased even more when Pansy and Blaise said that they hadn't heard anything from him for months? Harry hated to admit it, but he was worried about Draco. From what he had heard through Remus and Sirius (YES THEY ARE ALIVE, I AM A WOLFSTAR STAN AND I WANT THEM TO BE HERE) Draco had run away from home immediately after the war. Harry couldn't blame him, but he was still worried that no one knew where he was. No one. Not even Draco's closest friends. What if he was hurt? What if he was homeless and living on the streets? What if he was dead?
“You woke up Draco,” She mused, not looking up from her work. Her hair fell in front of her face, lit up by the sun, making her hair a golden blonde. Her hair looked strikingly similar to Draco’s, especially in the sunlight.
Draco stared at the sleeping bodies in a mixture of shock in confusion, he looked to his side to see what McGonagall, who had walked him here, thought of it, but the elder woman remained expressionless.
"Draco," He breathed in disbelief, their eyes locking, filled with so many emotions that they wanted to tell each other but would never have the guts to do so verbally. Pansy broke the silence (and the Drarry eye fuck session :/) and pulled Draco into a deathly tight hug.
"I- I made a decision, a while back, and I can't help but wonder....." Draco paused, "For my whole life, I've attended this school, its a wonderful school, with wonderful people, but.... I made some not so good decisions. All the time. And, this past year, the school kinda... crashed and burned, causing the school year to be cut short. A lot of people were lost, and it was all kinda my fault, but anyway. I got invited to go back. I said no, but..... All day I've been longing to go back, just to see what may happen. See if people will forgive me.... somehow,"
As soon as Draco saw McGonagall, he wanted to run. Far far away. All he wanted was to leave that part of his life behind. But, when the older woman laid eyes on Draco, she did something he wasn't expecting. She smiled. Then she strutted right up to Draco and handed him a letter. He took the letter and looked up at the elder woman for some sort of direction, but she just looked at him expectantly, waiting for him to open the letter.
Then Draco looked away. Harry forced himself to turn his attention back to organizing the paint. Then, he heard Draco get up and leave the room. Harry sighed, lying down on the ground and resting his hands over his eyes.
“Well, since it’s your first day, I just want you to get used to the environment, maybe get to know some of the patients casually. So, I’ll probably have you doing little jobs, like cleaning brushes, organizing paint shelves, and scraping dried paint off of old pallets so we can use them again. Also, I was hoping at some point today you could walk down the block and pick up some flowers from Madam Malkins,”
"No. That's not what I meant. What I mean is that, I left for a reason. I don't want to be there, and no one wants me there. Ask anyone, in the entire wizarding world. I can't go back," Draco tried to explain, desperately trying to ignore the small part of him that did want to return.
"What's going on, Draco? You can talk to me?" Amber softly smiled at him, her brown eyes full of concern, and her fiery red hair glinting in the sunlight. Amber could be a Weasley easily if she so wanted to. With her bright red hair that was cut into a short bob, her vintage style of clothing, and her spit fire attitude. Amber was strikingly similar to Ginevra Weasley. As he thought of Ginny, his mind subconsciously floated back to those emerald eyes. Shaking his head, Draco turned his attention back to Amber and sighed.
"YAY!!!" Amber shouted, throwing her arms in the air and spinning around in victory, making Draco laugh, "Oh! Before I forget, here's my phone number, so that way we can still talk while you are off at school,"
Then, out of no where, the woman whipped a blow horn out of her green robes. She blew it, and holy shit was is loud. Draco jumped at the noise, even though he had watched as she blew it. All of the students startled awake, falling off of couches, and looking around wildly in confusion.
Pansy pulled away and grinned at Draco, "C'mon, Dray, we have a lot to catch up on!" And with that she pulled Draco and Blaise out of the common room, Draco letting out a laugh as she did so.
Harry looked up as he heard muffled voices approaching him. A young woman walked into the waiting room, her long platinum blonde hair flowing gracefully behind her. The woman had on a pair of ridiculous magenta sunglasses, and she removed them when her eyes landed on Harry.
Draco hadn't been planning on returning to this place for a very long time. In the time since the war, Draco had run away from home and had been living in muggle London. He had actually quite enjoyed it there. Away from everything he knew. It had been refreshing. He had picked up a muggle job at a flower shop.
“S’all right,” Harry responded, still holding his nose, and moving forward to unlock the art studio. Harry glanced at Draco again. Draco was looking at him, surprised Harry had heard his apology, and accepted his apology.
Draco sighed, but a small smile traced his lips, "I'll contact the Headmistress tonight, I'll see if her offer is still open,"
“I’m not sure. It depends, I suppose, on whether he just doesn’t like the color green, or he has certain feelings or memories attached to the color green, so his subconscious just decides to avoid the color green to avoid those memories,”
All day these thoughts circled his head, causing him to be more spacey than usual. A lot more spacey.
Harry was well aware of the party going on downstairs. The teachers, thinking the returning eight years may not want to be in the same dorm with a bunch of first years, had made another dorm, just for the eighth years of all four houses. At first it had been quite awkward, all of them just sitting in the common room, staring at each other. Then Pansy had whipped out a bottle of fire whisky and everything snowballed from there, the party becoming a wild one. Harry had clocked out early on, it had all been a little too much for him. Also, Draco wasn't there...
"Sulking on your own, staring at the ceiling, and pinning over Draco Malfoy? Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun, mate,"
“Uh- excuse-” Harry’s attempt to wake up Draco was cut off by Draco startling awake and slamming his head into Harry’s nose.
Draco let out a breath he hadn't known he was holding in as he allowed himself to relax into Pansy's embrace. He squeezed his eyes shut as he held Pansy closer, not wanting to acknowledge all the eyes on him. Then he felt another pair of arms wrap around them both, arms he easily recognized to belong to Blaise. He sighed once again, unbelievably thankful to have at least two friends still.
“Aren’t they wonderful,” She spun in a circle, gesturing to all the murals, “They are all made by our patients,”
"Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy, we are getting you are phone before you leave, I'm not letting you get away that easily,"
“See,” Luna said, “He mostly keeps to himself. He is quite an intriguing individual though, isn’t he?”
Harry nodded, before turning and walking into the second room. He sat on the shiny white tile floor, in front of a teal cabinet with aged flower painted designs decorating it. He opened the cabinet and resumed sorting the paint bottles from where he had left off the day before. He glanced at Draco, the young man was in the same spot where he had been the day before, but this time he was standing over his painting looking down at it critically. His eyebrows were knitted together, and his stormy grey eyes were dark and calculating. He chewed his lip lightly and hands were on his hips. Then, after a little longer of just staring at the painting, his head shot up and he moved to the cabinet Harry was organizing. Harry averted his gaze quickly. He heard Draco pause for a moment, then he walked to Harry and kneeled beside him. Draco’s gaze darted around for a little white, then he delicately picked up a bottle of a pink/orange coral color and strided back to his spot by the window.
Shaking his head at Draco's impudence, Harry stalked over to one of the windows. He glimpsed out onto the street, trying to see if anyone was watching their apartment. But thankfully it was empty except two or three Muggle cars passing by while Draco raided their bathroom.
Harry grinned. "Honestly, seeing that it's you, just be the poncy arsehole you were in school, brag about your wealth whenever they are near to hear you and I think we should be fine. I can't wait to show them my arsehole boyfriend. This will be brilliant."
Harry helped Arthur to work on his newest project until Draco and Molly called them both inside for lunch.
Draco on the other hand had no issues whatsoever. He was living his best life, exactly as if nothing had changed, as if he wouldn't change.
Draco had to go to his next appointment at St. Mungo's without him because Harry had absolutely no shoes left that he'd fit into. This was enough reason to transform him yet again into a sobbing mess.
He had seen it before the Battle of Hogwarts, people spending just a bit more time with their loved ones before everything went to shit. And this, awful as it was, somehow felt similar.
Sighing, Harry followed them, silently cursing every single branch that clawed and tugged at his jeans.
"You two know that I can hear you, right? And that this isn't helpful in making me less scared of today?" Scorps voice came from the hallway-
"Harry! I've been waiting for you!" came the delighted cry of the archival witch. "How lovely to see you again, my dear boy. All your other Aurors have already been down here already. I thought you might have done something stupid again, and they weren't allowing you to join this madness."
Draco casually walked up to them and pointed his wand at Mrs Robards. A bright white light emerged from the end. Then Draco turned to Harry. "I've put her to sleep, she'll be out for about six hours. Is that enough time for us to storm the Ministry?"
And he was out of his favourite chocolate. He had to restock on those as well, if only to keep sane until they were invited to St. Mungo's to have the baby.
At some point Dudley's wife decided to get into the games, enjoying the show more than she actually should have, especially seeing that there were more important things for her to be dealing with.
"Was this the reason you hogged the bathroom?" Harry asked, as he let his hands glide up Draco's legs carefully, barely touching him.
Ron grinned over his shoulder at Harry, and it was obvious that he'd taken an instant liking to the old lady. Suppressing an unprofessional snort, Harry followed them to a room in the back of the house. He watched in astonishment as the witch turned off the flames under nine different cauldrons.
"We'll use a Disillusionment Charm too and move slowly; it'll work out if we're quiet," Harry replied, gratified that the bunch of them cared so much.
Once they arrived, Harry and Ron placed the witch in one of the nicer holding cells before they once again brought her wand to the Artifacts, Articles of Magic and Stolen Items Room. They made their way back to their office.
Harry found the Slytherins convened in the kitchen enjoying a late breakfast. All of them stared at Harry in surprise when he disturbed their cosy round of chatting.
They all looked at her for a few minutes, just to give her a chance to make sure that potion had the chance to do its work. Then Hermione took over again. "What is your current, and your maiden, name?"
Pansy came back shortly afterwards. Opening the small bottle of essence of dittany Hermione always carried around with a sharp twist, Pansy kneeled down next to him. "This will hurt, but I need you to stay still while I pour this on your face since there's not much left."
Shaking his head, Harry looked down at the front page. Nothing. There was nothing about last night. Only a report about new regulations that the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures had set up which now forbid the cropping of Crup tails to hide them from Muggle eyes.
"No," Harry said cautiously, going to a window to look outside. He couldn't see anything. "But if they watched the house then they saw me enter shortly before so I wouldn't trust how quiet it is now."
Harry managed to stay at his apartment for about five minutes before his restlessness drove him onwards. He was desperate to go to Grimmauld and tell the others everything that had happened.
Not as scary anymore, of course: now Harry had a plan, and knew what to do, even if the worst came to the worst. He was chomping at the bit, wanting to leave. Harry was happy with their plan, even though it would be nearly all improvised.
Handing her the most atrocious and revolting plant Harry had ever seen, Draco told her with a wink to not let the Ministry find it in her possession.
Harry felt his muscles relax as he finally was able to move again. Rolling onto his back, he let out a pained, broken groan. His entire body hurt, and he didn't even want to think about how he'd feel tomorrow. A tomorrow he'd now have thanks to Draco.
Rolling his eyes, Ron hid the passage again, making enough noise to distract Draco's attention away from Harry's guilty expression caused by the potions sniffing comment.
"You're not the first one to tell me. How about you go to bed, I'll stay on your sofa, and tomorrow we'll work out how we're somehow going to make this work."
Nodding, Harry followed Draco into the Department of Mysteries and through a dozen doors and twisting, maze-like rooms until they found themselves in a dimly lit room that made Harry feel immediately uneasy.
The situation finally cleared ten minutes later. As far as Harry could tell, Robards' side, be that good or bad, had won the ground and taken everyone who wasn't fast enough away with them in a haze of Apparition leaving only a few people behind to spell clear the damage.
"It's just a stomach bug, love. I'll be fine." Harry smiled, a desperate attempt to not worry Draco even more. Draco didn't need that now. But one glance at his husband told him that Draco wouldn't allow Harry to brush it off that easily.
Whoever had the brilliant idea that he should take in Draco Malfoy must have forgotten all the fights they had.
"The Ministry started arresting people this week who were in any kind of way related to Death Eaters and their doings," Harry began, rolling his glass around in his hand. He hated being the bearer of bad news. "Robards even asked me if I trust Draco. It all began earlier this week. There were a few arrests, and a few people brought in for questioning." He paused, looking at the faces of all of his friends. "Today though? Nearly all qualified Aurors were called in and handed a list of suspects to arrest without an explanation. Ron's and my list included ten people, no idea how many the others had."
"I think I'll never see enough of the world. Every new place is breathtaking and worth visiting, but—"
Once they made it into the crowd, Draco pulled Harry close and started moving them to the rhythm of the music.
coins. Would you believe that most of our old members still have them? We'll all meet at Grimmauld this weekend, Harry, I'll give you a list of people to visit and tell them the address."
"—worried, yeah sure. Let's go and get ready mate. But honestly, you have it so bad for him, and you should let him know once this is over. The pair of you. Honestly. You're unbearable."
People were shouting; curses and hexes were fired, and people came from everywhere to join with them on their march to the lifts. The guards had been knocked out, but then there were more coming from every side, streaming in and trying to stop them. But there were just too many people on their side. Harry's army was a force, a battalion, determined to make a last stand between good and the forces of evil.
"Probably. Possible. I don't know. How long do they take to come here? I want to leave." Harry couldn't help it. His voice shook.
"What was that about?" Ron hissed into his ear, casting his eyes all around the Atrium in case they were being followed.
"Yeah. Nothing better than a good duel on a Friday," Harry huffed, already dreading the cuts, bruises and strains that he'd later have to heal. "I'll go inform Robards, can you go and fetch a few Healing Potions just to be safe? The files clearly show that he's a clear 'attack first, talk later' kind of person."
Looking at the Castiel guy, Draco wasn't even sure if he had listened. But it didn't matter, as long as they'd find Harry.
Taking deep breaths and focusing to push away every intrusive thought, Harry concentrated on the sounds all around him. The rustling of paper, someone walking past the Archive, another set of steps, a cough from Mathilde. All those little things that filled his surroundings seeped into his consciousness.
Closing the door, Harry followed Malfoy. "May I ask what happened that you showed up here - at an address you shouldn't even know, by the way - in the middle of the night?"
A white mist escaped his wand and trickled to the ground, and Harry watched in shock as about a dozen or more Dementors appeared out of the shadows in front of them.
Harry immediately felt mortified. A person wouldn't need to be a powerful Legilimens to know she was livid. Mrs Robards was just staring at him, her face covered in angry red blotches.
"Harry James Potter, you tell me this instant what exactly you did, or mark my words, I'll hex the information out of you!" she snapped.
The stag finally broke free and together with Ron's terrier went after the Dementors who were still creeping ever closer, their creeping, black-robed presence sucking away Harry's happiness.
Rolling his eyes, Draco put his wand to Harry's cheek and whispered the Healing spell before stroking over the freshly healed skin with his thumb. "It's still pink, but I don't think it'll scar. Salazar knows you have enough of those decorating your body already."
Opening the door just far enough so he could stick his head inside, Harry tried to spot Arthur between all the random Muggle clutter that he stored in there.
The entire group fell into absolute silence. Neville was the first one to gather his thoughts after McGonnagall's words, and as he started to speak, all heads snapped towards him.
Harry's stag took off, and from behind him he heard at least a dozen other people shouting the same thing. Suddenly the entire hallway was filled with the glowing lights of the Patronuses taking off towards the Dementors slowly gliding towards them.
"Pebble understands," said the little elf, "If Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy go to the second floor, there will be a bedroom waiting."
"I'd trust Draco Malfoy with my life," Harry replied, without a quiver of hesitation in his voice. "If I see his name on one of those lists then I'll quit the second I see it."
that thankfully freed their feet even though they wisely didn't move. They'd been taught on their first day of DADA to lure your target into a false sense of security. Ron and he pretended that they were still stuck fast.
Thank Merlin, Hermione had finally let go of the bottle. He poured himself another drink before he told his other best friend the entire story including what they had seen happening at Robards' house.
And just as he had expected, a glowing dot appeared in the air in front him, telling him there was at least one human inside there, and Merlin only knew what else.
"Let's say I was busy in other parts of the world. I came back for Greg's wedding this month. Hard to get ahold of the
"That's for sure. Merlin knows what happened to him." Harry chewed on the end of his quill as he spoke. "Let's get the paperwork done so we can finally go home," Harry said, already scribbling a memo to let Robards know they'd returned.
"We should go and check on Kingsley," Ginny said and Arthur nodded approvingly. "If we've enough people then nothing can happen."
"Nothing better than a duel on a Friday afternoon, Auror Potter. That way you'll do everything you can to not end up at St Mungo's. Looks like your weekend depends on your success. Backup will take five to ten minutes to arrive, so be careful! Good luck, stay alert," Robards said and sent him off with a nod. "Merlin be with you."
"I know a temporary solution in case everything goes to shit!" Harry called out, jumping up and pacing across the room, excitement racing through him. "Grimmauld is still a safe house! We renewed all wards and spells after the war! Those who knew where it was forgot about it when we renewed the Fidelius Charm on it. That means that right now the only people who know where it is are the Weasleys, Hermione and me! There's no way the Ministry could find you there, not if it kept Voldemort out! If they come knocking at your door, then you just go there!"
But the tides turned once more. A few swipes of Crouch's wand managed to make Harry stumble and fall over.
will be very pleased to see you again," Ron teased. "It's been a while since you were down there. I bet she misses you."
His skin was soft under Harry's hands, the scars he had left on Draco's body only there when one knew where to feel for them. Draco Malfoy would be his downfall, Harry knew that. And he'd gladly go all the way down. Be it for him, or on him.
Suddenly black smoke filled the air around them, and Harry heard a scream that ran through his entire body. Before he understood what was happening, white hands were gripping at them, trying to pull them into the shadows, and Harry realised he had seen those types of hands before. "Seamus! I need you here! We need fire! A lot of it!"
While Harry gave him a brief overview of the wedding and his aunt and uncle, Draco watched him attentive while sipping on his coffee. By the time Harry had finished his brief overview of his left over family, Draco had a murderous look on his face that quickly turned into a dirty grin.
So obviously, and Harry would have appreciated if they'd have told him sooner, male pregnancies had to have a little extra spice to them.
"No you obviously can't!" Draco screamed, the near-hysteria of his voice testimony to how frightened he had been. "And I can't do this anymore either! I can't sit around and hope you'll survive the next day, and the day after, over and over again, just because you have to play the hero! That's just—"
"You're very far from crazy," Hermione said as she sat up, "and one of these creeps looks like one of our friends from Robards' house. Draco, would you mind?"
"I wonder if she ever goes home or if she just lives inside her archive," Harry sighed, taking the files Ron handed him.
At least Potter wasn't with him this time. He somehow had made it his personal business to help Mr Weasley help Draco.
There was an eerie silence over the entire Alley, and at the far end, Harry could see fog creeping up towards them.
"Not if we remove their memories of us," Draco mused, as he shivered and pulled his jacket closer around his skinny frame.
So Harry dragged his tired body out of bed and Flooed into the Ministry, arriving even before Ron did.
"You fell, probably too much to drink. We're waiting for a team to take you with them, they have a few questions to ask you but will also make sure you didn't hit your head too hard," Ron answered without batting an eye. Harry had to smile. To think that it was he that was almost sorted Slytherin!
It wasn't as if working for the Aurors was that much fun. Harry had lost some of his fight during the last few years, and truthfully nowadays it was less about saving the world and more having a paid job. But that didn't mean he'd just sit there and do his job until he could leave.
Harry asked himself if this is how all the others felt right now too. Every minute they stayed like this, their hands entwined, his heart grew tighter. He genuinely felt as if this could be the end. It wasn't fair that they had to fight again, wasn't fair they had to fix what others failed to see before it was too late. It made Harry feel like he was seventeen again, walking into the forest knowing that he wouldn't come back.
Telling them the address, so they could finally see the house and come in, Harry turned and marched back into the kitchen. They could never hide that many people. It simply wasn't possible. They had to march in and hope that the sheer mass of people was impressive enough to stop anyone from trying to stop them.
"I'll send my owl to father,” said Pansy. "They're out of the country at the moment. Maybe it's best if they don't come back so soon because they absolutely did
"We should go too," Ron said, looking around at the thinning crowds and Harry knew it was a good plan. He was too wound up to properly control his feelings.
Entering the room, Harry started to look through the perfectly labelled potions searching for Veritaserum and Polyjuice. Finding a bottle of Amortentia, Harry huffed out a laugh and removed his Bubble-Head Charm, then opened the lid to smell it. It was still heavy on the broom polish, but now other scents had mixed into his former ones.
"Potter lives, Dudley." Greg was finally starting to calm down, though his face was still red with amusement. "Our poor boy Draco has had a crush on him since forever. But Potter is something like a saint in our world. He's famous, while we are—we're the opposite actually. We can try and get ahold of him, but I can't promise you that he'll ever get a letter. They filter his mail, and nothing gets to him without being checked first. It's madness."
"I beg to differ," Harry huffed. "I don't know how many times I nearly died at Hogwarts. And seeing that it's a school, any answer other than never is a bad answer."
With that, Robards concluded his speech and people actually started clapping. Harry had to join them, not wanting to be seen as a rebel, even though the only thing he could think of was 'bullshit'. Every word that the Head Auror had said was a lie. Robards didn't look even the slightest bit sorry about Kingsley's death at all. But people were just too willing to believe him.
Standing in the middle of the office, Harry looked around, frantically trying to find a place Robards could hide something. He could use a spell, but that was risky. Robards would very likely have detection spells over his office.
The dogs slowed down in front of yet another group of bushes, sniffing the ground to discover whatever it was they were looking for. After a minute, they had found a nearly hidden path leading them deeper into the bushes and semi forest around them.
As soon as he arrived Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak over Draco's head. Even though he hotly accused Harry of behaving like a mother hen, Draco let it stay in place as he stomped through the apartment and gathered his things. To Harry's amusement Draco's belongings included nearly all the food from their kitchen and all the snacks Harry had hoarded in a drawer in their living room.
Already feeling annoyed beyond repair, Harry gestured to Ron to get their order while he turned on his heels and stalked down the corridor towards Robards' office to wait for him.
"For fucks sake," the voice grumbled. "Potter? Is that you? My fucking luck never runs out it seems."
"Let's get Mrs Gardner first and then take care of this, they should be gone now so there's no immediate danger anymore."
"Yes! At four o'clock in the morning! She wanted me to tell her everything right away but it was far too early." Ron sighed. "I told her to sleep first and that I'll tell her everything when I come home later."
But the one answer he got was enough. The bloke seemed to be pleasant enough and didn't even want any money, because "pissing off some homophobes" was enough for him.
"It's been two hours since then. Why didn't you just go again after I left? Doesn't look like I killed your momentum." Letting his hands rest only an inch from Draco's prick, Harry looked up in his face, drinking in the view.
"What I mean is," Draco sighed, "if we help each other we might find them faster. Who are you looking for?"
"Ron and I got attacked by Dementors this morning. They Kissed one of our witnesses! Kingsley, there are strange things going on, and I don't know what to do with it. What happened to you?" Harry was close to pulling his hair out in frustration. "What is this thing we're dealing with?"
"Do you want to cut off my hair?" Malfoy asked after long minutes of silence in the bathroom. "That's a once in a lifetime offer, Potter."
Making their way through the house, Harry marvelled at the changes the house-elves had made. Grimmauld looked almost unrecognisable. The whole building was warm, cosy and hospitable. Harry briefly wondered if they had managed to get rid of the nasty tapestry with all the Black family members sewn into it, but that thought vanished when Draco bumped against him by accident.
The rest of the family jumped on board mere minutes later. A few quick spells and the living room was mostly empty of furniture and now featured a small dancefloor.
"I'm not hungry at all," Harry answered, not wanting the cheeky bloody Slytherin to have the upper hand.
Shaking his head, Harry scrubbed their plates clean and put them back into the shelf before he went to take a shower. He did indeed know that Draco had always been a spoiled, pampered brat, and that hadn't changed after all the many years that had passed.
"Wolfsbane, super potent Amortentia, Liquid Luck, Veritaserum, brews that aren't exactly illegal, but the Ministry still didn't like my customers, and since all those are all regulated potions they didn't appreciate me intervening in their business."
When Draco felt unwatched, there was only the tiniest hint of a smile gracing his lips as he looked down at his ever growing belly. Harry had seen Draco touch it with wonder in his eyes, before his face returned to the mask he wore for everyone else.
"Finish the job. Take over where You-Know-Who failed…" She looked around the room, her eyes wide and half-mad. "By this time tomorrow we'll all be dead."
"What's Grimmauld?" Greg asked, looking over the rim of his glass at Harry. There was still a lot that his new friends didn't know about his experiences during the war.
"Yeah go home to your snake, we'll cover from here," Ron said with a dirty grin that made Harry roll his eyes at him once more before he left.
Each bird sailed through the open window and Draco dropped a few coins into their little pouches before they flew off again
"I think the important things have been said. Please go home and rest, take this day to mourn over the best Minister we've had in centuries, and let's come back together tomorrow, to keep this place running."
Heart beating faster, Harry grinned even wider as he looked back at Robards' house. There was still no light, no movement and nothing happening. He was probably sound asleep while they were freezing and wet and waiting for the others to finally take over.
One thing Harry absolutely wasn't prepared to deal with was Draco's hormones, which were now his own hormones.
It was a relief when they finally got to tell everyone. Draco had made a cake, and invited their friends over so they could tell them all the good news.
Knocking on the door, Harry waited for the tell-tale barked 'come in' before he entered the office. What he hadn't been expecting was to find himself face to face with not only Robards but with Kingsley as well. "Just here to inform you where Ron and I are going to, sir."
"You're so ridiculous," Ron laughed, making a swipe for the whisky. Hermione threw him a dirty look that made him go silent instantly and place the bottle on the table with a quiet click.
"Do we know us?" Harry asked, stunned. The man had said Potter, he was sure he had heard that correctly. But nobody here knew him. He didn't even go with that name anymore.
Draco watched as Mr Weasley positively hopped down the path to the entrance from where he could Apparate back home.
Draco was feeling miserable, it was way too hot, there were way too many people, and he had lost his patience with this idiot about thirty minutes ago.
Choosing not to wait for Draco, Harry ran into the house and towards the Floo, greeting Blaise on his way in.
"—deeply missed. Therefore, and as soon as this meeting is over, everyone is allowed to go home for the day. We here at the Ministry won't force anyone to stay. Everyone who wants to stay here to make sure we have enough people for emergencies is welcome to do so." He paused, making doubly sure that everybody was listening. "By tomorrow morning I'll take the place the loss of my friend has left empty, until we find a worthy replacement for him. I'll also keep the role of Head Auror, seeing that I have no intention of becoming Minister myself and hope that this temporary solution will find an end as soon as possible."
Curses started to fly, missing all of them by about an inch. Most of Harry's army used some basic defense spells, leaving the Unforgivables to whomever had it in them to cast them, overtaking Crouch's marionettes with ease and sending them away one after the other.
"It looks like it's the only idea we have so far," Draco said grimly, his fingers unconsciously picking at a loose thread on his sleeve.
. But he'd never forget that Draco was the one who taught him how to give head. Which was, if he had to be honest, the beginning of his downfall in wizarding society. And Harry loved it.
"Really? Thank Merlin for your observation skills, Potter. I wouldn't have known without you." A head popped out of the covered up sleeping back and Harry tried his best to not scream in shock.
"What's his weakness?" Pansy asked. "Mother always used to say that everyone has one. Does anyone here know what Robards' Achilles' heel is?"
"Good," Harry said quietly. "We'll give you some Veritaserum now, to make sure it's really you. And, once we've verified that it is indeed you, we have a few additional questions we'd like to ask you. Now, I'd appreciate it if you take it without protest, because you're not going to get around drinking it. And if you still manage to outsmart us, I hear Mr Malfoy here is an excellent Legilimens."
Only then he realised that the path they were taking didn't lead to Malfoy Manor. It led to some kind of random beach house that didn't even look like it'd belong to the Malfoy's.
"We'll take care of this, Mrs Robards," Harry said before getting up. He pulled the others out of the room.
"Do you think we knocked Robards out?" Hermione asked nervously. Harry had to bite back a smile; she had never been all that comfortable not following the rules.
Malfoy stepped on his foot under the table and Harry realised he should have probably kept his mouth shut. But now the damage had been done.
Shuddering at the very thought, Harry pulled Ron towards a place on the other side of the room where they'd be able to see the small platform but would hopefully still be invisible in the flood of faces.
It turned out that Ron's help was more than appreciated, and very necessary. Ron remembered most of Hermione's issues, and how she dealt with them, and if he couldn't they went to Hermione for help.
Casting his eyes around the table, Harry suddenly realised that everyone had somehow grown up, matured into their role as adults. They'd all done something with their lives. Somehow the months had slipped into years. They all had happy, full existences, while the only thing he did was work. Looking to his side, Harry smiled a bit. At least he had Draco to come home to.
Dudley knew that Harry was some kind of big thing among his people. Diggle had told him that much. But he'd never gone into any details, so Dudley had just shrugged it off, thinking that he was possibly exaggerating.
"Are you already done with the others?" Harry asked, feeling astonished as he handed her the parchment.
Grinning, Harry walked to Draco's room and his face fell as he realised what had happened downstairs.
Ten minutes later, Harry finally found the Veritaserum. Taking four vials, he walked over to Ron who was staring mesmerised at a few bottles containing glowing red and blue potions.
"That'll be unnecessary. I'll finish eating, and thanks for cooking by the way, and then I'm off to bed myself. You probably won't even be done with wanking when I fall asleep."
"We're talking about Robards," Harry answered, his voice a concerned rumble, "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't expect us to use one of your secret spells."
"Yeah, me too. Thank you Draco. I—I really need a nap. I slept like shit last night, and I'm so done with today."
They hadn't expected it to happen that fast. Usually it took months, sometimes years, before a pregnancy was even possible. But not for them, obviously.
"First sleep. Tomorrow I'll visit the Burrow to talk to Arthur and Molly. You could come with me, they'd love to see you again. It's been a while since we darkened their doors. Also I thought about checking Grimmauld Place. I have no idea what state it's in at this point, and it looks like we'll need it."
so you can check out 'The Wizard of the Weekend'," Harry snorted as he reached for the newspaper and unrolled it.
"Nice to see that the gang of you care so much about me," Harry grinned before looking at Pansy. "Where did you put my cloak last night?" he asked. "We'll need it."
Dudley dragged his aching muscles upstairs. He couldn't wait to fall into his bed and sleep for a week straight.
Here's where you join in the game. They can't be mad at me if I tell them I'm secretly dating the Chosen One himself. They'd never believe me so for this plan to work I need you to come with me. Tonight.
Slipping behind the potted plant, Harry got rid of the cloak and shoved it into one of the pockets on his robes before sprinting towards the lifts. The picture there resembled a scene of 'The Shining' and Harry snorted recalling George's latest fascination with horror movies, the blood-soaked Kubrick classic his favourite.
Living with Dudley wasn't all that bad. Draco had learnt more about Muggle culture and technology within the last five months than he had in twenty-four years that came before.
At some point their living arrangement got to a point where it was nearly unbearable for Harry to stay.
, Harry let a fuzzy blanket fly towards the pair of them. Catching it mid-air, he threw it over Draco who sent him a small smile in response.
"There was an emergency investigation yesterday. The gas explosion was confirmed and the case is closed. I understand why you of all people ask this question, Mr Potter." Robards paused then, unconsciously straightening the parchment pile with the end of his finger. "Please be assured that I myself was on the scene and I did everything I could. Go home for today, take a day off, Auror Potter. We're not doing anything today."
But even Dudley had lost his temper after the third kitchen fire he'd had to deal with. That was when his flatmate explained what was wrong with him.
"Ten," Pansy's shaking voice came from somewhere in the darkness. "They just offed someone I know in passing. He took one of those brutes with him though."
It feels strange writing you a letter, and I'm not exactly excited to do so. But you are my last and also only chance.
At that all the lights went out, and Harry felt a sudden coldness spread through his entire body, taking over his mind and soul before he could act in any way. All the happiness and warmth seemed to flee from the world.
At some point in his life things had started to go wrong. Draco could possibly even point his finger at the exact moment, but he wasn't up for that kind of mental exercise. It'd only keep him spinning in circles for ages, and that was of no help whatsoever in his current situation.
Draco walked up to Harry and looked at the spot he had been touching before. "Sirius. He was your godfather, right? He was the one who left you the house."
He couldn't help but tear up at the thought of them being parents soon. He wondered what their baby would look like.
"Sure." Without a second thought, Seamus put Annie in his arms before he turned to prepare her bottle. "She had a rough night too, it can't be teeth just yet so maybe she's having a growth spurt. Or not used to sleeping somewhere other than home. But we'll survive."
Draco was especially off tonight, ever since Harry had to throw him out of the bathroom earlier because he had been hogging it for ages.
Harry shuddered as he remembered all the hours he'd spent sorting through files with her. He remembered the dust and the clutter of the place. Whenever Harry had done something that wasn't up to the high departmental standards they had set upon him, they had sent him down there to help her.
"Where would you suggest this topic be discussed then?" the Headmistress asked, and Harry was happy to see that she was taking him seriously for once. Some small part of him expected her to send him to his common room and tell him to shut up about it.
"All of them. Depending if they eat you or you eat them," the witch giggled, batting an extra-large leaf out of the way.
"Way to scare us, you prick! Wait, I have a Marauding Candle, I'll come and get you, you have to see this! Merlin, how many people did you bring?" Ron's voice was already inching closer, and Harry waited impatiently for him to arrive at the small back room.
Looking up, Robards acknowledged Harry's words with a quick nod before he nearly slipped in the red ooze on the floor. He ignored the two wizards after that, instead concentrating back on the task on hand.
Harry froze and turned his head to the side. It was only him and the twins in the hallways, which caused Harry to furrow his brows in confusion.
"Um.....yes sir." Snape raised an eyebrow. He opened his mouth to point out Harry's lack of attention when he heard a light growl.
"Fred, George, have you seen Draco?" Harry asked as he kept looking over at the Slytherin table. The twins looked at eachother, a look of mischief on their face before looking at Harry.
"Draco!" Harry said flustered as they passed by other schoolmates. Draco ignored Harry's pleas of putting him down and went down to the dungeon.
"......" he leaned forward and sniffed. Harry and the twins looked absolutely terrified as Draco rubbed his nose and tried sniffing again.
"He was a good friend of ours as well, but she wouldn't listen. She never did." The woman trailed off.
"Sit Potter." Snape spoke coldly as he waved his hand and the chair from against the wall flew over and knocked into Harry, forcing him to fall back onto it. Snape went around to his desk and sat down calmly. Harry took a big gulp.
"Potter, I want an explanation for why your air head behavior this morning." Snape said watching Harry carefully.
"See to it that you do, Mister Potter, I'd hate to have you in my class again next year." Snape said and flipped his hair out of his face as he walked to the front of the class.
"....sorry." Harry said quietly. They stopped at the end of the hall and looked at eachother, then to Harry, who appeared to be in thought.
"My favorite food is Treacle Tarts." Harry said smiling, knowing Draco would store that into his memory.
"Thank you. For everything." He said smiling as he waved his hand and opened the door to let the others come in.
"Mr. Potter is with me, though I cannot imagine who is with you both." He said coldly. Hagrid cleared his throat.
"I do sir." Harry said firmly with a nod. Dumbledore hesitantly takes the necklace from Snape, studying every detail.
"I'll protect you, I promise." Draco said rubbing Harry's back. Harry relaxed slightly and laid back down, his head on Draco's chest.
".......what is going on?" Harry asked himself as the lady began to hum, opening the book and grabbing the ingredients.
"Is it safe for me to assume that young Harry is your mate?" He asked. Draco nodded as he scooted his chair closer to Harry, trying to make it seem  unnoticeable.
"Madeline." He cried out. Madeline turned to him with a smile and they engulfed eachother into a hug before melting into a kiss.
"Yes, the grounds keeper." Snape said annoyed. Harry and Snape was walking through the grounds to Hagrid's hut. Snape and went up to the door and knocked on it.
"Savage, those fans are. I hear even Seamus has a poster of Malfoy. Rotten fellow he is." Fred stated.
"Edward please-" Harry heard a smack and then things falling. He started going down the stairs, keeping a hand on the wall.
"Draco stop, you are terrifying the golden boy. On second thoughts, please continue." Snape said bitterly.
"Harry?" Harry heard a gentle voice speak to him. Harry slowly lifted his head to see a transparent image of Madeline Croft. She was smiling down gently at him.
"....hello." Harry said meekly, knowing this was draco's elite fanclub. Standing tall as the head and leader of this club was none other than Pansy Parkinson.
Harry looked through the curtains to see if he could find Draco, and finally found him in the last bed. Harry took in Draco/s pale appearance and red nose. He frowned deeply as he walked over to Draco and sat in the chair by his bed.
"Well Harry, veelas are beautiful bird like creatures. They posses great power and excellent charm, amongst beautiful wings." Dumbledoor started.
Harry headed out of the room, stopping and looking at Malfoy once more before shaking his head and closing the door behind him.
"I spoke with Madam Ravenclaw's portrait, I also saw you speaking with the twins in secret. Now, I could give you detention and homework twice your size, or you can tell me why you are looking into an old professor's disappearance." Snape warned.
"Potter, can you not go one year without any sort of trouble?" Snape asked seriously, but with a hint of a smirk.
"Well Potter?" Snape asked impatiently. Potter kept his eyes towards the wall, his eyes narrowing to keep back the tears.
"......I like you Draco, I have for a long time....and I want to make it work, mate or not. But some things will need to change, at least for now. Starting off with not following me everywhere I go." Harry said pointedly.
Madeline laid dead with the book loosely in her arms. Tears fell from Edward's cold eyes as he reached down and took the book. He turned to leave but stopped and turned back to Madeline.
".....very well." Draco said, closing his eyes and pulled his wings back in. He opened his eyes to show them their original color came back.
"Yes sir." Professor said. Tom opened his mouth to continue but closed it, turning his head slowly to face Harry.
Harry started writing down the ingredients and the potion's instructions that he managed to remember as Snape continued his ramblings.
"Alright, let's head down to breakfast." Fred said standing up and putting the parchment in his robe sleeve.
Harry's eyes widen as he turned to where he heard the voice. He was looking straight at a huge portrait of the founder of Ravenclaw, hanging peacefully on the wall as she waved to Harry in a friendly manner.
Harry kept his eyes up front, ignoring Draco's presents, and it seems Draco has kept his words, be he hadn't even looked at Harry this last week.
"Bloody harlot." He growled as he got him wand out. Madeline froze with tears as she realized what he was about to do."
"You thought wrong. Don't ever talk to me again." Draco said spreading his wings and flying out the window.
"Hagrid, I need to speak with you." Snape said loud enough from Hagrid to hear him. There was some rumbling and multiple footsteps in the hut before Hagrid opened the door.
Draco lifted his head. His eyes back to normal, which made Harry assume so we're his teeth. He stood up and picked Harry up.
"I would prefer it if you did not tell him of your visions, but considering he is your mate, it would be best if he found out from you and not on his own. I suggest waiting until he is better, a veela is even more protective in their vulnerable state and will most likely not listen to reason and may accidently harm you." Snape explained. Harry bit his lips again and nodded.
"Veelas have a significant other called a mate, which they can find once they come into inheritance.  A veela is very protective of their mate and would slaughter anything that dares to even look at them wrong. You see Harry, veelas are more bird than human in some cases, so it is a magic law that if a veela killed for their mate, no foul will come to them." He stated. Harry looked horrified.
"Listen Tom, the book is not ready to be shown to students at your age, if the ministry allows it to be published at all. Now I suggested you head back to your dorm this instant." Edward said sternly as he continued stepping back.
"Alright Harry....I will try, for you." Draco said hugging Harry. Harry blushed abit and hugged Draco back.
It wasn't until after first period did Harry find out Draco attacked another student, a hufflepuff no less. During class, a hufflepuff male continued to blab about how much he wanted to smash Harry's tight ass, and Draco went ballistic, jumping over a row of seats and clawed into the student's chest. It was only until professor Snape stopped Draco and got him to calm down. The hufflepuff was taken to saint Mungo for immediate care. Once Harry heard the story from talk in the hallway, he immediately searched for Draco. He soon found him in Professor Dumbledoor's office. The second Harry entered the office, Draco turned and looked at Harry, a look of guilt on his face.
Harry's group walked for a good twenty minutes through the forest, careful for the roots and kept a lookout for any spiders or half creature beings.
"You do realize class does not start for another half hour, correct Mister Potter." Snape's facial expression was as stiff as the handle of a broom stick.
"Tell me where the book is Madeline!" Harry opened his eyes to see a door at the bottom of a stairway, completely dark.
"Oh Draco." He said quietly as he watched his chest rise up and fall back down, his wheezes sounded loud in the quiet room. Even ill, Draco looked like a god, his beauty barely dented by illness.
"Professor." Edward heard. He turned his head to see a small boy standing in the corner. He recognized the boy instantly.
"The tell me why you are exploring a missing person's case, Specifically Madeline Croft." Snape reached into his desk and pulled out a file and threw it onto the desk, Her picture shown on the top cover, where she was laughing and smiling. Harry froze up and he looked away from the picture, feeling a sense of guilt.
"Harry, what is going on mate? You're freaking us out." Fred said putting a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"...." He put the book in his robe before he reached down and picked her up, heading to her favorite lake.
"Yeah Harry, and take care of those bags under your eyes. Don't want ya falling asleep in Snape's class." George chuckled as they split up from Harry.
"These..these are the missing works we deemed too dangerous for the hands of our students." Snape said surprised. Everyone was looking around the room, curious as to what was there. But Harry's eyes were stuck on one object in the room no one had seen yet.
"Mister malfoy, I do know that veela laws protect you from any serious punishment, but I do have to ask you refrain from attacking any of my students, even though they may say vulgar things. I know my asking of you won't do much, but I do have to ask you to consider it." Dumbledoor stated.
"I can't believe Snape is trying to ruin our fun." George sighed as Harry stirred. He frowned, thinking about his earlier talk with Professor Snape, and then when he explained to the twins what happened an hour ago.
Harry headed into the Hospital Wing, looking around nervously for Draco. He became worried when he heard from the Slytherins that Draco's fever got too high and they had to transfer him to the hospital wing.
"I don't know! But there has to be! He was crying when he left her body in the water." Harry said with tears falling. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry.
"Hello?" Harry called, fear piling in his stomach. He heard low voices talking in the distance in front of him. Harry pulled himself together and forced himself to head toward them. Once he reached the voices, he saw the backs a grown man and a young boy roughly a few years younger than himself.
"This way." Harry said quietly looking at the twins, and headed down a hall. A few steps down and Harry noticed a pair of footprints on the map.
Harry found himself in the Forbidden Forest, in the dark of night with only the light of the full moon.
"And George and I have two days ago." Fred said smugly. Snape snapped his head towards the twins, an irritated look on his face."
"I survived worse, I recently got out of the hospital wing. It was lucky the curse didn't kill me on the spot that day on the tournament." Cedric said with a small smile. Draco hummed.
"....I see her often in a room, surrounded by books of advance spells and potions. Sometimes I see her with Professor Dumbledoor, Sometimes I see her by herself, and sometimes-....I see her being killed." Harry bit his lip. Snape moved foreword towards Harry, a look of complete seriousness.
"T-Thanks." Draco was surprised by Harry's action, but before he could say anything, the twins put an arm on each of Harry's shoulders and guided him off the train.
"Actually sir, Fred and I believe we found the lake Harry described in his dream." George said quickly. Snape gave him a cold glance.
"I am sorry." He said teary eyed. Draco frowned and sat up with abit of a struggle and pulled Harry into his lap.
Harry woke up with a gasp and sat up, or at least tried to sit up. He felt arms holding onto him and someone's face in his neck.
"Harry! Over here!" Harry turned his head to find George and Fred gesturing for him to join them in their compartment.
"Don't Draco...just-....don't." Harry sighed, walking off to his table, leaving Draco there to figure out his mistake.
"Avada Kedavra!" He yelled and filled Harry's sight with a bright green light and Madeline's blood curling scream. The light dimmed down to show Harry in a new location, the lake he kept seeing. He looked around and found a quiet Edward Rimplestein carrying a dead Madeline Croft bride style. Harry looked abit closer to see Edward's red eyes filled with tears. Harry felt his stomach drop as he watched Edward place Madeline's body in the lake.
"I am sure it will be great and informative." Edward said smiling as he kissed her. Madeline and Edward were happily together. Though Rowena did not think he deserved her, Madeline still loved him with all her heart.
Before they could let out a breath, Harry spotted snape. Snape looked around the corridor and sighed heavily.
"What am I doing here?" He wondered. He walked forward, passing a few trees in the process and stopped in front of a lake.
Harry kept his eyes looking away as he bit his lip, refusing to say anything. Snape growled and ripped his hand off of Harry's tie.
"Potter." She spat, causing Harry to flinch. He internally sighed at the sign of weakness he has shown. Luckily, it seemed no one else noticed.
"I say we inform Professor Dumbledore, maybe he'll keep it as a memento of his dear friend." Snape said.
"We will once I go in. I have to do this." Harry said firmly as he took off his socks and pants. He left his glasses for last.
There is always someone watching. He became abit concerned for the boy, seeing Harry act weird. Though he couldn't stop his fustration when the boy refused to speak with him, and had the guts to get fustrated back.
"Very well potter, then explain to me why I shouldn't talk to your beloved Veela about this and exactly what connection you have with Professor Croft." Snape said folding his arms. Harry rubbed his eyes and sighed heavily, sitting back down.
"Harry what where you thinking?!" He demanded. It was then that Harry realized Draco's eyes were white. He quickly rubbed Draco's wet and cold arm with his free hand.
Harry and the twins have been writing to eachother a lot over the summer, since Ron and Hermoine have been traveling.
"NO! I want answers!" Draco roared. Snape held his hands up before he continued to speak, showing he was not a danger.
"Alright, I'll see you then." Harry said as they ran through the hallways, then split up. Harry made it into snape's class before the bell rung.
"You e really done it this time Draco, you can not wipe out everyone's memory." Snape said quietly to Draco as they walked.
"I will." Harry laughed lightly before he left the slytherin common room. He headed to his tower and once he got to his chambers, he sent Draco a patronous. It wasn't until he got into bed and closed his eyes did he realize he knew that woman from his dream. His eyes opened quickly, and he felt sick to his stomach.
"Look, I'm fine. I'm not dead. And I would prefer it if you let me go so we can talk like normal people." Harry said with a glare.
"She was a very dear friend of mine. It broke my heart when we lost her." She said sadly, then her expression turned angry.
"Go ahead and take a nap, we'll wake you when we get there." Harry wanted to tell them that he wasn't sleepy, but his eyelids grew too heavy and they fell against his will.
"What am I doing? What are you doing here!? In what right mind made you think coming here to the forbidden forest at night seemed fine! You could've been killed Harry!" Draco scold.
"It is okay now Ed, all is forgiven." She said as they melted into a kiss again. Once they broke apart, Edward looked at Harry.
"I'm fine Draco, I'm sorry I gave you a scare. I had a nightmare." Harry said gently, calming Draco down abit. Draco held him close and kissed Harry's face over and over again.
"It doesn't matter, I have to take my leave. That old fool has become suspicious of me and I need to get him off my back." Tom said before turning to Edward. Edward became skin and bone since Tom last seen him at the lake.
"T-This is madness." Harry said standing up and shaking his head. Draco stood up to and looked at Harry with sad eyes. Harry felt his heart pang at the sight of Draco.
"My my boys, creating a potion, not even knowing what it does? What would your potions master think about this?" Dumbledore asked, appearing next to them.
"*beeeeeez*, I heard professor *beeeez* has been hanging around here, around you." The lady scoffed.
"Well perhaps 10points from Griffindor for your insolence, due to the fact that you are trying to cheat your way to a better grade".
Harry shrugged, sitting on the couch in the dormitory room. He's glad that it was early in the morning so no one else was awake, and those that were, were too tired or busy to eavesdrop.
The red diamond of her necklace caught his eye as edward held his wand out and cast a spell, forcing Madeline's body to float to the middle of the lake and sink down.
"I hope not potter, pay attention or you'll find yourself in detention." Snape said. Harry mentally rolled his eyes.
Harry flew around the castle on his Nimbus 2000, felling the breeze on he face and the wind flapping his robe around. He smiled up to the sky as he enjoed the feeling of flying.
"Why did he do that......why did he-....what did he-.......best not think about it too much." Harry said to himself as he carefully got out of bed.
It was morning. Harry quickly got up, having already dressed since he didn't change last night. He ran out of the room and headed to the great hall. As he got there he saw the twins waving him over. He sighed and walked over to them, sitting down.
"What- Draco where are we going?" Harry asked confused. Draco brought Harry to the slytherin common room and laid down on the couch, bringing Harry close to him.
"Hey wait!" But he was unable to exit. He sighed, looking around the room. He recognized one of the books from his last dream and picked it up.
"What were you thinking?! You act strange for days on end, you sneak around often, I find you conspiring with Professor Snape and the twins, no surprise there, but I follow you to find you throw yourself into a lake in the middle of the bloody winter??" Draco yelled, causing Harry to flinch. Draco realized how he was scaring Harry and forced himself to calm down.
"Whatever, just don't topple the boat, please." He began to row. Malfoy sighed and pulled out his wand and castes a spell on the boat. It started rowing itself.
"Very well, perhaps I can help. What is the name of the book?" Edward asked curiously. Tom gae the professor a smile that froze Edward's blood.
"But Draco looks human, well, abit more beautiful before last year." He muttered, causing Draco the beam happily.
".......forbidden magic and how to use it for good...by Madeline Ructure....."  Harry opened it, reading some of the spells and going through the potions.
"Your family, Favorite food, place, what you were like in school before coming here...I want to get to know you." Draco said lightly as he kissed Harry's forehead. Harry looked in thought.
"You've been acting strange. We want to know why." George stated, the twins crossing their arms and giving Harry the big brother look.
"I am sure you rather not contaminate our golden boy Mr. Malfoy. I do have some words with him after all." Snape said as he used a spell to clean his sleeve. Draco frowned and looked at Harry before letting go.
"I do not know what you are talking about sir-" Snape abruptly stood up and knocked the chair back as he rounded the desk and grabbed Harry by the tie, forcing him to look at him face to nose.
"Almost.....got it..." His vision blurred again as soon as he felt the cold snitch in his hand. It's wings stopped and Harry knew it had admitted defeat to him. He steadied his broom.
"No, but I believe I know who it is after talking with Madam Ravenclaw. Another old professor who used to work here, Edward Rimplestein." Harry said feeling his stomach drop just by saying his name. Snape nodded seriously.
"Edward Rimplestein. He was another professor who used to work here. He also went missing around the time she disappeared."
"Let's just get this over with." Harry said, feeling the guilt as he remembered draco's confused face as he called his name.
That name breaks his heart, and turned it into a cold terror. His blood feel as if ice is running through his veins at the sheer thought of the name.
"You'll think I've gone mental." Harry said resting his head on his hand. The twins gave eachother a worried look and sat across from him.
"It's fine Harry, it's just draco's veela instinct to take care of you and to make sure you are comfortable." Dumbledoor said with a smile.
"I am sorry Draco." Harry said near tears, leaning over to latch onto Draco. Draco cleared his throat after he finished coughing and sniffed, rubbing Harry's back.
"Lumos" He casted and the room lit up from the light of his wand. Everyone took in the sight of the dusty old books that piled on eachother, the potion cauldron in the corner and the beakers and dried up ingredients laid out on the small shelf near the door.
Harry could hear them calling his name on the otherside of the door, but was unable to respond. He walked to the books and threw them on the ground. He started pulling everything off the shelves, books, ingredients, potion tools, and threw them onto the floor.
"He said nasty things about you! He said he would do awful things to your body, and I will not stand and listen to him mouth off! You are mine, and so if your arse." Draco stared firmly as he narrowed his eyes, daring Harry to say differently.
".......Come my friends, you deserve to know of her room after all the trouble she caused." Albus said as he headed to the door.
"You fell asleep in the hallway. I caught you so you didn't hit your head." Draco said sitting up with Harry. Harry turned towards him with raised eyebrow.
Before she could even react, she felt a wand hover underneath her chin. She glanced to the side to see none other than Cedric Diggory. He kept his eyes trained on her, ready to strike at any moment.
"Yes headmaster, and I would like to point out that he is a magnet for danger." Draco said in a slight growl.
"you're a bloody liar, I know you have a copy on you!" He spat. His eyes caught the book on the shelve and before he could lunge at it, Madeline grabbed it and held it to her chest.
"If you calm down Draco, we may speak." Snape said carefully. Draco looked at Snape fiercely with his white eyes, then back to Harry who was still sitting on the ground.
"......what is going on....." Harry turned to see the woman from his dream quickly leave the room. Harry went to follow.
Harry was waiting for Draco outside his Magic History class,  when he was approached by a group of slytherin and hufflepuff students.
She had long black silky hair with green eyes. She looked to be a student, but her eyes tell she has seen much more than any student would.
Harry gasped and jumped in shock. This time he was sure he heard it, a ghostly man voice he hadn't heard.
"Madeline?" He called. the wax from the candles dripped down the walls, the books stayed where they were last place, unmoving, but no Madeline left to be seen. Edward silently cried as he slowly realized what it was he'd done.
"Blimey Harry, this is a complex potion, where did you find this?" Fred asked reading the paper Harry gave him, George looking over his shoulder.
"Let's just hope we won't have to deal with him this year, I could do with a break from the drama." The twins chuckled.
"Let him go Draco, he needs some time alone." He said gently. Draco growled slightly and then sighed.
"Draco has found his mate." Snape said coldly. Dumbledoor looked over to snape with a raised eyebrow, then to Draco.
"I woke up this morning feeling abit under the weather. I can hardly breath through my nose and this cursed illness makes me dreary." He confessed. Harry's eyes widen a small fraction and he glanced over to the twins who looked to be trying to seem innocent. He sighed internally and looked at Draco with a frown.
"What is it?" Draco gulped and looked closer at Harry, his own eyes glowing alittle. Harry looked surprised.
"You've only been here for two days Harry, and you've found yourself in here both times. You need to be more careful Harry." Pomfrey said.
"I'm sick of trying to be your friend, you're a nuisance that will only get me killed along with you." He said bitterly. Harry felt tears falling down his face.
Harry couldn't recognize the man he was with, but could take a good guess that it was Professor Rimplestein.
"Harry, I'd much prefer to attend classes with you instead of being confined to bed." Draco said with a small smirk.
"Well we don't really get along. They all hate magic." Harry said, not able to help the bitterness in his tone. Draco looked worried.
"Of course." The portrait said. The twins and Harry quietly walked away as they left the weeping portrait.
"Ingredients to what, Mister Potter." Snape's voice came from behind Harry. Harry nearly jumped a foot into the air, not expecting his professor behind him.
"I do not understand what our relationship has to do with you lot. You call yourselves fangirls and fanboys, but it doesn't seem to me that you care about his feelings." Harry stated cooly. Pansy snarled and grabbed the front of his shirt, pulling him face to face with her and catching Harry and the others off guard.
"...It does not matter what you do, you will wither away anyway. The curse I put on you drain you mentally as well as physically. I have no more use of you." Tom said before turning and walked away.
"Do not 'Huh' me potter, see me after class." Snape threatened as he continued to write on his board.
"Expelliarmus!" A voice called and Pansy's wand flew out of her hand and onto the ground. Everyone glanced down the hallway to see a very irritated Draco Malloy.
Harry nodded and got up after George. They exited the griffidoor common room and headed down to breakfast.
"Very well Severus, I shall inform young Harry." He said with a gleam in his eye. He turned to Harry.
"Give me the books Madeline!" He yelled. Madeline cried out as she held the book in her hands, close to her chest.
"Come." Snape said as he led the twins out first. Draco rubbed Harry's back and began leading him out.
"Right git." Harry muttered to himself and took a seat in the back. He pulled out some parchment and took his quill out.
Potter gave him a crumpled piece of parchment. “These are the meetings for the next few weeks, Malfoy. Make sure that we don’t tun into any members of your Inquisitory Squad. Then we’ll see.”
“I assure you, that was a misjudgement. I am very much happy you did not accept in first year. I’d rather be you enemy than anything else.”
“Even though”, continued Daphne. “I was wondering about how much time you spend reading. It would be a shame if your father were to know that you spend more time on Grindelwald than studying.”
Draco thought that was rather smart. He himself would not give up the timetable for the DA for more than one or two meetings at a time, making sure the other person did not betray him. It was probably Granger who had come up with that idea.
Daphne stayed silent. Her eyes pleaded with him, big and blue, with tears in them. He felt himself deflating. “Fuck’s sake, Daphne. I’ll think about it, alright?”
He smoothed his way back towards the staircase. The Slytherins pretended they weren’t eavesdropping and looked away when he caught their gazes. Draco pushed a small first year aside when he stomped up the stairs again. He hoped that Daphne would be able to be bought into silence. He knew that she would not tell anyone yet, but Draco knew her long enough to guess that she might try something soon. He just hoped that his charisma and cunning ability could make her see sense and not use it against him.
Daphne laughed softly. “Ah, well. Then you must deal with it, don’t you? Now, I want to talk about Potter’s defence group. No, hear me out!” Draco groaned and tried to turn back towards the castle, but Daphne pulled his arm harshly. He had no choice but to stay where he was. “I know I’m being paranoid, but Astoria can under no circumstances join that group! I know that she has talked to Cho about it and I’m worried that they might get Potter behind the idea. Just – could you convince Potter not to accept Astoria into the group? It would help, believe me!”
Pansy took his hand when he sat down next to her. “Draco,” she smiled. “I would have loved to see you hex that bastard. That would have been lovely, right?”
Daphne had never been high in standing. Even though she was very social and known among the Slytherins, she never had reached the top of those who mattered. Draco had always made friends with the right sort (Fuck you, Potter) and befriended those that were pure, politically important and in high standing. Even though Daphne fulfilled most of those criteria, her beliefs destroyed a lot. She liked Muggles. When Pansy and she had an evil discussion in second year, Daphne lost most of her popularity under the social group Draco moved in. She gained some in the muggleborn Slytherins, though.
Draco smiled thinly. “Interesting theory. But I must say, sadly not correct at all. Why would I want to break someone else’s arm? Nevertheless, a Slytherin’s?”
“Oi”, said Weasel. He frowned at Astoria, then looked to Potter. “I hope you know what you are doing, involving the ferret.”
Potter snorted. “Fuck off, Malfoy. You cant tell me that you like her lessons. Its completely ridiculous that we don’t actually learn defensive spells!” He got louder in the end and threw his arms up, making a spectacle of himself. Draco didn’t understand why he told him this, and took a step back.
When he reached the common room, the other students in Slytherin looked up. He ignored the silence that suddenly fell over the room. Usually, he liked the respect that his housemates represented. Now, it made him feel like on the wrong end of a wand. He felt exposed as if everyone could guess what he had been up to in the darkness of the dormitory with a boy.
He contemplated her but did not act. The music was good, he had to agree with her on that. It wouldn’t be fair if he didn’t finish the song, so he ignored her and listened furthermore to the music. It was like nothing that he had heard before. Maybe the muggles weren’t completely useless if they could make him like their music.
Daphne didn’t seem to care about any of that. Her face was set, a tear on her cheek and her chin raised. She looked like she would make sure that Draco would keep his word, expecting him to help his sister in any way, protecting her from any harm. It would be frustrating, Draco supposed.
“Tonight, midnight, common room”, he murmured to her. Then, he stood up. “Do make sure to knock before you enter rooms. Or were you raised on the streets?”
Potter stared at him, and then nodded. “I hate detention with her,” he said. And then frowned, he obviously did not want to say as much.
“Exactly,” said Draco. “Maybe you insult Pansy, and she snaps. I believe Crabbe and Goyle would join that fight. It would completely lose control and I know a spell that breaks an arm. Of course, I will – because I have such a good heart - rush to your sister, telling her you are in the hospital wing.”
Draco sat down next to the young girl. She was still pretending he didn’t exist, and he coughed slightly.
Daphne pushed her hands into her coat. “Yes, that’s exactly what you are going to do. Talk to Potter, make him see reason. And then my sister will live. We all win.”
She pointed to a sheet of paper that Granger had tried to hide under a book. Astoria ripped it free and pointed to the signature Greengrass at the bottom of the paper. Her eyes held his for a few seconds until she put down the paper again.
Draco took her hands softly and pulled them down. “Daphne, calm down.” When the witch didn’t answer, he shook her. “Daphne!”
Draco laughed. And wanted to insult him, make him mad, but somehow he ended up speaking honestly. “I have tea with Umbridge weekly,” he replied. “So she told me then.”
Theo next to him snorted. “You should have seen Granger and Weasley’s faces. They were completely red when Potter joined them again. Figurers that Potter would want a fight.”
As a result, they were all tense. It felt like everyone was watching him and wanting him to decide. But what did they expect from him?
Of course, this is the moment that the whole situation completely lost control. Pansy and Daphne both pulled hair, bit, and screamed at each other and overall were awful to each other. Draco pulled out his want, waiting for the perfect moment to break Daphne’s arm.
He started walking the same path that Daphne had walked when he was intersected by an angry looking Pansy. Her eyes were wide, and she grabbed his arm forcefully.
Draco mentally prepared for what he would have to do when he made his way to the little study group. They were almost hidden, but Draco had spent enough time searching for the most hidden spots in the library that he had no problems finding the four people that were so set on destroying his life. Only Daphne was missing.
It was one of the open secrets that everyone in Slytherin followed. Don’t tell me any of your secrets, it might end up in the wrong ear. Due to an enormous sense of loyalty, their loyalty laid first with their family. It was something that made it difficult to trust anyone because there was always another person that came before the best friend status or the boyfriend or girlfriend status.
He didn’t have to wait long, until Daphne sat down next to Pansy. She settled down in her personal space, smiling and pretending she didn’t see the angry look from Pansy. The rest of the group tensed, sensing the argument that would erupt. But Pansy didn’t say anything, just kept on eating. It wasn’t until Daphne pushed over her goblet, making a poor job of apologizing, that Pansy finally snapped. She took her Crabbe’s goblet and emptied their contents on Daphne’s head. As a result, Crabbe started screaming, insulting both girls and ensuring that Daphne slapped her own dinner onto his face. After that, Bulstrode got involved, Pansy insulted Daphne further. Daphne now got really angry. Draco stared at her in shock when she did something he did not plan on.
Daphne punched his arm when she caught up with him. “You told me you would protect her at all costs. What has come from that promise, hm? Are you going back on your word now?”
Even Astoria thought so. She nodded readily, blabbering on about cancelling with Cho, and taking her sister’s hand and pulling her along. The sisters made their way further and further away from Draco, and he watched as Daphne looked behind herself and gave him thumps up. He smiled.
Potter shrugged. “Dunno. You’re always telling me that I am not special. It’s a nice change, I suppose.”
Draco coughed quietly and turned towards Astoria again. “Your sister will be beside herself, you know that, right?”
And Daphne: using a pureblood solely to produce more pureblood babies. Was that actually freedom? Or was it a hidden dictatorship where only the Dark Lord was able to give redemption and eternal life?
Daphne shrugged. “I only use this one.” She showed him a small button that showed a little triangle and two lines next to each other. “It starts and stops the song. That’s it.”
The song came to a close. Daphne pushed the button again and took out the chord and put it back into her pocket. Draco watched her attentively.
Draco stared at him, not being able to look away from Zabini’s shameless display. When Blaise looked up to him under lidded eyes, Draco turned around and slammed straight into a bedpost. Embarrassed, he ignored his friend’s snorting laughter and jumped down the stairs, taking two at a time.
She took it carefully out of his hand. “It’s a present from my sister.” She gauged his reaction, contemplating him before she took one of the buds at the end of the cord and hold it out towards him. “Put that in your ear.”
And Draco had helped. By joining the Inquisitorial Squad, he was able to spy on other students (Which he really loved), dodging points from everyone that pissed him off (maybe enjoyed that a bit too much), making Potter mad, and also having influence on the school as a whole.
He ripped his arm out of her grip and opened the door towards the classroom. When he entered, all students looked up, but Severus only glanced at him once and continued his lessons. Draco smirked at Potter and his friends. Potter scowled back. When Daphne pushed past him, he followed her towards his usual place next to Theo Nott. Draco would copy his notes, then.
Snape stood next to her. “Indeed. Ms Parkinson, please make way to my office. Mr. Malfoy, is everything alright with Ms Greengrass?”
Sadly, Daphne didn’t seem to understand that he tried not to be alone and run into Potter. A few weeks after the incident, she pulled him away from their friends and pulled him outside into the castle grounds. It was a cold day and Draco felt himself shiver when the angry air blasted through his hair.
He heard Granger and Weasel gasp loudly behind him, but he kept his face towards Astoria. She had tears in her eyes and shrunk even more into herself. “Maybe. But I was more thinking about Transfiguration. You see, I still don’t get that one spell – “
Draco had, of course, panicked. He jumped off the bed, hastily putting on his clothes. Blaise behind him just lounged on the bed, a dazed look on his face.
“What the- “He stared wide-eyed at Daphne. The witch had closed her eyes and moved her lips in silent concentration.
Daphne smiled. “I could get my arm broken during breakfast. She would have to rush to the hospital wing. Oh, no, how awful.”
Draco tapped his fingers on the table. “That doesn’t really matter, now, does it? I want you to pro – “
Draco shook his head. He ignored the surprised sounds from Granger and Weasel and stared Potter down. Too bad that he wasn’t easily stared down. Damn him. “No, I told you already that was an accident, didn’t I?”
Draco blinked. His heart stopped for a scary second. He opened his mouth, closed it, and then started laughing. What the hell? “Potter, I am afraid I have no idea what you are talking about. But that is no surprise, you have only one braincell after all. Please, leave it to Granger for making assumptions. She may be a filthy mudblood, but she is smarter than you. You will only break your own head.”
“Then,” she began. “I will tell your father that you like to be fucked by boys. You know just as well as I do that our agreement was that you must watch over Astoria. Ask for something else.”
“I know,” said Astoria. She pulled her hand free. “Because of father. I want to do something for myself, Daphne. We need to learn new spells, not only in theory, but casting them. Learning how to defend ourselves is important. I am going to that meeting and I will join that group. You cannot stop me.”
Daphne slapped him on his arm. “What the hell, Malfoy! I told you to talk to him, how in Salazar’s name were you too late?”
When he asked Pansy about it the next day, she told him that she did not converse with her parents. It was only fair; the dark-haired girl had a very bad relationship with her mother and Draco knew that they hadn’t spoken for month. He suspected that her father had tried to send his daughter letters, but she would never tell him as much. It was better that way. The things he only suspected could not be used against each other. That’s why it did not bother him when she smiled at him thinly, probably lying through her teeth.
Draco blinked. “Well, then. Don’t act like a child in her lectures. I’m sure you deserve detention.”
“Aren’t you going after her, Zabini?”, asked Draco while he put on his jeans. He couldn’t be fast enough to find Daphne. He didn’t want anyone to find out he was in bed with a boy. It would fuck up everything.
But Astoria smirked softly. “Draco, darling. I believe I know what the deal is about. You have to make sure I don’t make anything stupid, right?”
Potter balled his hands into fists. “No, I know you know what I am talking about. So, shut up and tell me why.”
“What should I do?”, whispered Daphne. Her eyes filled with tears and she bit back a cry. “I want to help her so badly. But what could I do that will make her see reason?”
When they both had stepped inside, they found a rather big room. There were two chairs in front of the fire, making Draco feel at home at once.
“Please, do not make such a mess in the library. And bring back all the books in the right places.” She looked closely at Potter when she said that and then kept on walking.
The attention turned from hi to the huge professor and Draco saw Potter putting a piece of parchment into his pocket quickly. Afterwards, he walked back towards his group of misfits and winked at Draco when he looked at him.
Draco put a hand on her shoulder. He wasn’t good at comforting people. “I don’t think you can. She has the Greengrass genes in her, after all. They are a stubborn bunch, I must say.”
Potter laughed quietly. “Well, Malfoy, I think she is correct. And you know what? You might as well keep on helping us, because Astoria’s name is on the list now and if anyone were to find the DA, everyone will know that she signed it. So, make sure we won’t be found out and you will keep on protecting Astoria.”
Draco took it and put it in his ear. He saw Daphne doing the same thing on her end. Then, she took the small metal thing and pressed some buttons. For a few seconds, nothing happened. Then, he could hear a voice in his ear, and he jumped up in consternation.
“Whoops!”, she exclaimed when she held onto Draco. But Draco lost his own footing on the muddy ground and together they tumbled down.
“So,” he began. He looked at each of them for a second before he turned again towards the girl. She looked very different from her sister, her long brown hair falling prettily around her shoulders. He held her gaze for a few seconds in which she shook nervously. “What do we have here?”
Draco stared at her. “And how do you suppose I should do that? Potter and I are not exactly friends. Do you want me to tell him: Oh, you can’t accept Astoria into your group because I tell you not to? Yeah, that’ll go over well.”
But Draco did not, in fact, know what the hell was going on. He blinked at her, not really understanding what she was talking about. “Whatever do you mean, Daphne? I did not do anything to you, did I?”
Daphne grabbed his hand. “Listen here, Malfoy. I don’t care what you do, just make sure she is safe. I don’t care if you have to learn every healing spell there is, I don’t care if you get detention for it. Make sure that she makes it out of this war alive. You know that any time, if she gets hurt, I can tell every pureblood in this area that you are not what you’re supposed to be. So, think about it: Do you want to be disowned, dishonoured, and fall from grace, or do you want to stay where you are. You just have to look out for my sister.”
But when he saw Astoria in the library sitting next to Potter, Granger and Weasel, he knew that he was fucked. He hadn’t planned on being in the library, but he had promised to help Crabbe and Goyle with an essay and he needed an old volume from the library. When Astoria saw him, her face fell, and she turned whey faced.
