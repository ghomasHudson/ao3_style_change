Draco shrugged vaguely. “Just something for an acquaintance of mine. Plus, I write to my mother when I can.”
He finally mustered the courage to glance at back at Malfoy, whom was invested in his notes again, twiddling his quill between his fingers. The potion next to him looked perfectly metallic and silver, as expected.
And before Draco could speak, Dumbledore was gone, leaving him and Snape alone once again.
"Mum!" Draco exclaimed. "I have everything, stop griping!"
"No." Harry said, leaving no room for argument. But when did Draco ever apply to that?
Draco sat idly as the three men stared at him impatiently. A clock on the wall, stuck forever ticking between three fourty-three and three fourty-four, matched the rhythmic swaying of his leg, crossed languorously over the other in a manner he knew looked most infuriating. His ankle moved in small circles through the air. He felt it's movements slowly fray the nerves of the room's other occupants.
“I wouldn’t do it if I had a choice, Blaise.”
"All ready, Harry?" He asked, to which Harry just shrugged.
“Good, too.” Dean said congenially, decked out in his pyjamas that resembled some Quidditch team Harry couldn’t recall. He glanced at Seamus, and Dean also threw a short glance at his friend, “Oi.” Dean prodded Seamus’s side with one of his feet. “You gonna tell Harry about your summer?”
He found himself before her classroom door once again, throat sore and muscles trembling. He hoped it wasn’t visible as Umbridge would have surely taken it with satisfaction if he showed that he was truly scared. Not to mention that it wouldn’t pair well with how he was yesterday…. Merlin, he really should have taken some time to think the whole thing through since it was really real. He’d spent the whole day berating himself and denying the events of the day before and now he had to do it all on the fly
friendship and companionship.
“Tch, yes.”
"What're you doin' here?"
“And what makes you so sure?” Draco crossed his arms over his chest playfully.
"I just don't…hug a lot. Or any of that stuff in general." He said sheepishly, looking away slightly with a slush in his cheeks.
“Harry? Hey, wait!” Ron called after him. Harry heard the sound of fast footsteps following him.
"Draco." The witch said again. He took a begrudging sip of his tea. It was far too hot.
"Er, yeah, Professor. He's with me." Harry said, trying to look as if it was the most normal thing in the world. McGonagall's eyes widened at the two of them for a moment before she spoke,
He felt Bill reach and pat him on the back twice, but it was so hard it almost knocked Draco completely over, just managing to right himself and restrain a cough. "You'll be alright, Mal - Sorry. Draco. Anyone here gives you trouble, come to me, alright?"
"It's for your own good, Draco." Harry said gravely.
.” Draco hissed, as if it was common sense because it
Draco had the audacity to act mock offended, placing his hand achingly over his heart, "Me? An ulterior motive?"
"Hullo George, Fred." Harry said dully. The two snickered about something obviously no one else was privy to. One of them - George, Draco presumed - finally landed their eyes on Draco, and nudged his twin.
Something flickered in Malfoy's eyes, but he quickly looked down at his hands for a moment. Harry noticed the boy did that when he was thinking hard about something.
In the back of his mind, thoughts of Umbridge and his scar still swirled and lingered, but he pushed them away. He was sure they could wait a single evening, for Merlin’s sake. Not only was he done with his detentions, but Ron was on the team and it was officially the weekend. Umbridge and Voldemort and OWLs be damned, he was going to have this night to finally relax.
"No idea. Cast a tempus you bloody muggle." Blaise replied, earning a glare from Draco. "And
Just as Draco slung his book bag over his shoulder, he caught sight of Umbridge’s desk and the many papers stacked on top of it. He remembered her adamant scribbling on one of them earlier that morning.
"His life's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother," Ron said irritably. "Is that normal, Hermione?"
"Shit!" He kicked a chair across the room. What was that just now? Why did Snape's left arm start to hurt. Why would his mark start to hurt?
“Probably.” Harry shrugged. “Knowing her…”
The feeling stayed with him all throughout the feast, and by the time students were finally led in to their dormitory's, Draco's chest had begun burn as if something inside him was melting. It was stifling, and by the time he'd fled in to the Slytherin bathrooms, his vision was blurry and his face was wet. He saw himself in the mirror, red-eyed and flushed and couldn't understand who that person was looking back. It had been so long…yet there he was, sobbing like a child as he gripped the edges of the porcelain sink with white knuckles.
"Laugh all you want, Potter." Malfoy crossed his arms haughtily at Harrys laughs, chin up in the air, "We'll see who's laughing when
"I gathered that part." Draco said, pointedly looking at the woman on the motorbike. "I've seen a few in muggle London, but nothing as nice as this one." The motorbike was sleek and shiny, with black leather padding and thick steel handles, unfortunately covered by the legs of the woman as they were draped over. "Harley Davidson. Is that her name or something?"
“And we won’t even know what to
"Is that the Essence of Bellodroma?" Harry asked curiously. Ron checked the book again,
Harry drew back, neck sore from bending over the parchment. “What do you think?” he asked quietly after a moment.
he thought simply. It was a childish sort of urge. Just for the pure thrill, he wanted to use it. He imagined Draco dueling, swishes of his wand through the air in that quick way he'd seen him cast in the past. The bursts of magic leaving before he'd even finished the incantation…
Slumping back on to his bed, he faced the side-table and stared his wand. His arm lay outstretched next to him, hanging off the bed as if beckoning it towards him. He sighed deeply, and his heart rate slowed marginally.
“That must be terribly frustrating,” Draco said empathetically after a moment.
"You practically took it all off!" Harry erupted.
“Er,” Umbridge said, placing a stubby finger on her lips. “You did say something about influence at the Ministry…”
while he was talking. It could have been a baby if I didn't know better."
The faces of the newcomers were something he’d never come to appreciate until now, as their wondrous expressions and widened eyes gazed around at the floor-to-ceiling length green windows with childish glee. Some even had their faces pressed against the glass, peering into the clear depths of the Lake. Draco smiled, knowing the merpeople would be making an appearance soon to greet them for a little initiatory scare.
"Those two…I'll never understand." He muttered, forgetting Malfoy was there. The boy didn’t say anything for once, and Harry sung his prayers heavenward. "We were going to go with the Patil twins. Me and Ron." Harry paused, turning to watch the dance floor and the people around it. He didn't know why he was telling Malfoy all this, but he decided it just needed to be said. "It was last minute because we couldn't find dates. I agreed to go with Parvati Patil and he with Padma." Malfoy mirrored his movements, and now they stood next to each other as Harry sunk in to himself and let the sounds of the Hall surround him.
5 o'clock - Detention!
! Why on earth would you scare me like that?" Draco scolded, holding his croissants possessively to his chest. Potter, the git, flicked his eyes between Draco and the croissants, his mouth twitching at the sides as if he were about to
He trailed off, studying Umbridge closely. She seemed to be conflicted with herself, the reality of Harry in front of her and the reality of the Ministry and Lucius Malfoy waging a battle in her head. There was also the idea of Voldemort… Harry really should do something about it. If only he had an opening…
Harry nodded, "The train?"
"Mm." Harry said, now seemingly engrossed in eating. Draco almost shook his head. Sometimes he really didn't understand Harry. "Wonder what we're doing today."
“She stole it?” Harry asked.
And Harry slowly grinned.
"What about Crouch?" Blaise asked, leaning forward interestedly, "Bartemius Crouch?"
"What's the fun in that?" He gasped out, doubling over. "Your face! Merlin, Harry!"
It wasn't until Potter asked him to the Ball that that indifference begun to crack. Potter infuriated him to no end, but the usual painful feeling he got when he saw him had just begun to fade away by that point. As soon as he'd asked, though, all those feelings came back with full force and
"I am bloody well not! That's besides the point, though. It was a good joke." Harry said, siphoning his half-ruined potion in to a vial to give to Snape.
“Oh ... Yeah ... well, we need to be a bit more careful, he’s been asking Kingsley and me funny questions...”
"Enjoying the outside." Harry said with a sigh, then added curtly, "And also avoiding everyone inside."
The papers seemed to be organised into three different types. Much of it was what seemed like pre-planned parchments of homework Umbridge had yet to set her students, dating up until at least the next term. The others were several Ministry sealed parchments that he made sure not to touch directly or displace. They didn’t come as a surprise, though, as he already knew that her role was the Ministry’s doing.
"Surer of what?"
Snape was busy shouting at Seamus and Neville at the back, and everyone was too hot to be casually attentive, so Harry took his chance.
God, he missed it.
to do with Potter?" Draco said exasperatedly.
Harry had asked, stuffing his hands in to his jeans pockets.
. The air felt like solid glass, and if he moved or spoke he felt he'd break something. Shatter it in to millions and millions of pieces that magic could never possibly fix.
"Utmost loyalty." His father repeated, eyes boring into Draco.
"Remember how I said Sirius, Remus and my dad were friends?" Harry reminded him, pulling Draco by the arm closer so he was standing next to him.
“Bloody hell, Harry. We can’t help if we don’t know.” Draco’s voice reasoned behind him.
"I've been trying my best to for a while now." Draco huffed.
"Let's go now. By the Lake. Who knows how much time we have." Potter said, looking at Draco curiously. Draco nodded again, trying to brand the glittering walls in to his mind. For some reason, he didn’t think he would see them again. Draco didn't think the walls were what he needed, however. The feelings they gave him, his almost heart stopped. They eased his pulse, but they never made him feel more alive. Those feelings…yes. There resembled something unfamiliar, something not foreign but rarely seen. Those feelings felt like, resonated something closest to a state of being.
. You've known her how many days, Nott?"
pile, hearing a chorus of tortured wails erupting off of it as soon as it made contact with the other books.
"I won't." Ron scoffed. Hermione rolled her eyes but still smiled warmly, throwing her arms around him and Ron.
Draco scoffed sarcastically, making his way in to the room and closing the door. He pulled a chair next to Harry, brushing the dust of the seat a few times before throwing himself down with a huff.
Harry grimaced and turned his body away to stare at the window, so Draco was left staring at his back. "I got attacked by one."
Draco shrugged, “Not too bad, actually. Seven are the usual Sacred Twenty-Eights relations - none less distant than a second cousin to the main lines, though. One half-blood, three regular Purebloods and one Muggleborn.”
He heard Harry huff then follow behind him outside of the class, slamming the door. They both walked quickly and silently, Harry falling in to step with Draco after a moment.
"Did you notice the few members in the meeting I was in?" Draco asked him suddenly.
"I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN’T YOU," Harry interrupted, stood with his fists clenched and facing away from Draco. "ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER -"
He grit his teeth in frustration. He didn’t know the...etiquette for muggle-borns in Slytherin. It almost never happened, so he’d never been exposed to it. It was quite an ironic event, not to mention a cruel one at that…
to take me to the ball. If he were to back out, he would be admitting defeat. And since he's a useless muggle-raised Gryffindor, he won't know how to uphold any amount of class at all, setting himself up for disaster as he humiliates himself right next the sharp contrast of dignified, pureblood
"Yes."
"Uh, yeah. Essentially. I guess I just saw Ronald and his brothers being cared for so carefreely, and I realised I didn't have that. Mind you, I was a brat-"
Harry looked stunned for a moment, before answering, "It's an arc."
"Nothing much we can do. Nothing much
"Now what?" Draco quirked his head, feeling something unravel in his chest.
He shivered at the thought. Everything about the woman had made his life many times harder, and that was saying something. He could only tell that it would continue like this for the rest of the year. It couldn’t get any worse, though. Probably…
“What? You sure?”
"I guess you're correct." He said, shutting his eyes for a moment before opening them. "It's true, I really am sorry, Granger. I know a few words sound fruitless, but I genuinely do feel terrible for how much trouble I might have caused you over the years."
Harry thought about it for a moment, his frown lessening slightly. "Yeah, I guess. Everything?"
Draco felt a smug grin spread over his face, "So you guys think I'm at least a
"K…Know what?" Harry stuttered.
"I should have just taken the cup." Harry drew back, looking up at Harry with a tear stricken face and haunted eyes. "He killed him because of me."
The train whistled, and they made their way to the compartments where most of the Slytherin's were. Passing by, however, he saw Harry through a window and stopped abruptly.
you swore together?" Hermione raised an eyebrow coldly, and Harry saw Draco stiffen in the corner of his eye.
a man on a mission.
“Yeah, soon. Bye.”
"Thank you." He said in his awful nasally voice, cursing how much of an idiot he sounded.

to go to Dumbledore. He's busy as it is, and imagine running to the Headmaster for a little bit of a headache?"
"Sorry." Harry said, taking the vial and slapping Ron on the shoulder. The boy smiled at him ruefully anyway, which Harry understood as him saying it right back. He didn't quite understand why it was such a big deal, but Ron was always tetchy with the feelings stuff anyway.
"Th…Thanks, I guess." Ron said, looking down at the badge with wide eyes. "Thought for sure Harry would get it, though."
Before he knew it, he was walking up to the teacher's stand itself, hands clenched at his sides and breath coming unevenly.
“Again,” Dumbledore countered evenly, “as of this current moment, there is little that you can do. I’m sure even you know that.”
Harry started with a bump on his head from where he'd been sleeping in the library. It seemed that at some point in the night he'd slumped over half is body underneath a table. He hadn't planned to fall asleep there but must have gotten carried away trying to find out more about Gillyweed while Draco stole some from Snape's office.
"What
Harry opened the door, letting the yellow hall lights spill in to the room, before turning back quickly, "Wait," he said with realisation, "You just did magic!"
Draco stopped moving and hoped Blaise would think he fell back to sleep, but the bastard went on, "But, by Merlin, that boy in his robes! Who knew Potter was so fit?" He asked incredulously. "I almost wished it was his hand on
"But the
"Dumbledore showed up, then?"
“You said that the influence from my….
Harry quirked his head, "Meaning?"
to be stressed about them. That at least goes for
"Harry!" Draco exclaimed, forgetting Sirius and passing through the curtain, the man not following behind him. He rushed in to see Harry sat up, one hand rubbing his eyes and the other groping the table next to him for his glasses. Draco quickly went and picked them off the table, opening and placing them on Harry's face. Harry sat there and let him, and Draco watched as his green eyes came to focus on his.
side being Voldemort's." Draco said, and at Harry's shocked look added, "Oh, please Potter. Some things are worse than saying that damn name."
He’d been completely distracted the day before, consumed with thoughts about the letter, so he understood how he may have missed Umbridge’s odd behaviour in DADA. Even if Harry was involved.
"No, but Bill is. Charlie's still in Romania - Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards as possible. Bill works in an office at the Ministry now - says' he misses the tombs but, " He smirks, "he's got
"I know. I do understand." Harry said, smile wavering at Draco's nervous energy. "What's wrong?"
“You’re here to see Mr Lancaster?” she asked sceptically.
understand what this all implies."
Lancaster locked a haunted set of eyes with him, and he knew.
“Scar,” Harry mumbled. “But it’s nothing... It happens all the time now...”
"Not telling." He winked secretively, and Ron clenched his fists. "Sorry, Ron. I just can't." Harry said. He wanted to preserve the spot as much as he could, save for Draco's presence. It was the one place at Hogwarts where he could really get away. "So we'd bump in to each other there sometimes. Of course, we had to talk to each other at some point, so we did. Now we just talk a bit more like actual people. Since the truce, I didn't really have a reason to have anything against him unless he started with the bigotry bullshit again. He hasn't said anything like it since to me, though, so I've got no reason to hate him like I did before. I guess he's also trying, so he's not been bad to me either. He's not that bad when he's not being a prat, actually."
were flipped through front and back. Library sections from A to H were confirmed to be completely useless in the Potions, Charms and Transfigurations sides of the Library.
spells before.
"Mhm. Wait - how do you-?"
Malfoy didn't move, didn't even blink at him in return, "Oh, please, Potter. If you haven't noticed, I will do and say whatever I please. I won't take shit from someone who keeps company with blood--traitors and mudbloods." He spat. Harry clenched his fists at his sides, wishing Ron and Hermione were there right now. Being with Malfoy alone while this angry felt unstable and dangerous. They could gladly kill each other and everybody would be too busy at the Ball to notice.
"Then why am I here?" Harry said hotly, his patience wearing thin. He felt the last of his fraying nerves burn out from the whole day, his body almost entirely wrung with tension. He started to get up.
“I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,” she said, an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth, “but you all have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed — not to mention,” she gave a nasty little laugh, “extremely dangerous half-breeds.”
Harry and Cedric stood side by side at the front of the line, wands in hand. Fleur and Viktor were behind them, but they wouldn't be going in until a few minutes after Harry and Cedric.
Just then, a raised voice could be heard from the other side of the door across. It was the same door where the current Order meeting was also happening behind. The voice was steadily growing in volume, harsh tones reaching the trio's ears.
Dumbledore showed the first sign of reaction to Draco. The other teachers looked on incredulously, and Draco walked closer.
mentioned something, even Draco feared for his own life.
"Right. Goodnight, Draco."
Draco took the opportunity to rip back the curtain fully. For a split second, Harry thought they were looking through a window, a window behind which an old woman in a black cap was screaming and screaming as though she was being tortured. Draco backed away immediately as the woman, drooling from the corner of her mouth and screaming with her yellowed face stretched taut, placed her eyes on him. It was then that Harry realised it wasn't a window, but a life-sized portrait. One of the most realistic, yet unpleasant he'd ever seen in his life.
"Well…Obviously something…not good!" Hermione stammered. "What was it?"
“Will do. Just hurry!”
Draco looked around, eyes focusing on the parts others weren't looking at because they were transfixed on the maze itself. Outside the maze, the champions tent, the teacher's stands…
. The survival of their companionship withered away as soon as Draco got stuffed down Crabbe's trousers in the form of a glorified rat. He didn't want to admit it, but he still had trouble looking either in the eyes. There are some things you just can't unsee, and Draco had seen them.
"Ron-" Hermione reached out a hand, but he shook his head at her and left the room. "I'll go talk to him-" She started to get out of her chair before Harry raised an arm to stop her.
“Just sit down.” She finally said through gritted teeth, but there was an undertone of fear in her eyes. “And do your work.”
It wasn't until he felt Draco's arms completely around him did he realise he was being
Hurriedly, he packed everything he owned in to his trunk. For once, he was glad he didn't own much, since it managed to take him less than ten minutes. He coaxed Hedwig in to her cage, laced up his trainers, and looked around his room one last time. It wasn't much less bare than when his things had occupied it, and without a backwards glance or lingering thought, he turned and left the room with his trunk and Hedwig's cage dragging behind him.
"Weird?"
Harry scoffed, "The Vow has nothing to do with matters between me and the Order."
“It doesn’t have to be getting in
pile. Without saying anything, he changed the tome's place, putting it in the other pile with his gloved hands.
"I…" Harry sighed, "I know. But he knows what he's doing. He knows what he wants."
"Hey mate." Ron said in his other ear. Harry pulled back completely, beaming.
"Malfoy." He said. Draco looked at him expectantly, heart hammering because he was
Harry blew out the flame and the room was spelled in to darkness. He just barely touched the doorknob before his very eyes, the long corridor he'd been dreaming about constantly appeared in his vision. His scar flared with pain, and he cried out.
"Merlin." Draco sat back on his hands, "How on earth did you get one of those? No wonder you get away with creeping around the school like a ghost."
Harry looked forward again, now looking down at his own feet and mumbling, “Yeah.”
"Why the fuck would you do that?" Harry shrieked, feeling his lack of hair once again since the Yule Ball.
“With
"Sirius won't do anything, you wanker." Harry growled. "Calm the fuck down and let me explain!"
“Why, what happened, Seamus?” Neville asked as he placed his Mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet.
"The bad boy! Malfoy! He is ordering Dobby to deliver this to you!" And Dobby holds out a small vial of something sickeningly green and slimy inside. "Harry Potter must not trust the Malfoy boy!"
“Hi.” Harry said, moving to where his trunk was.
The three of them gathered at the front of the Manor, Draco's mother shrinking his trunk until he would be at Platform 9¾. His father held out both arms, and Draco begrudgingly took one while his mother took the other, although he made sure to only touch him sleeve with a few fingers.
"Er, hello Mrs. Weas-" He tried to say through her bushy hair as he's pressed in to her shoulder.
-o-o-
Harry's eyes flew open to the dark wooden ceiling of his room. His body was frozen. He tried to move his limbs but found them stiff and unresponsive. There was a sinking feeling in his chest…Like he would never be able to get up again…
Harry wondered how Draco was, finally allowing himself to be concerned about the boy. He wondered how things were going with his father and Umbridge… Had she finally gotten off their backs? Harry wondered if what he did made things better or worse…
The children all nodded, and they continued, stopping in front of the entrance to the Common Room.
Harry's eyebrows rose in amusement. "Alright there, Draco? Looking a little pale."
"Blimey, trust Malfoy not to have a sense of humour." Ron muttered and Harry wacked him with his textbook.
“No, it makes sense,” Harry went on, “If I cause more trouble, she gets distracted with me, then she won’t have time for you and maybe your father.”
"Draco, what's wrong?" Snape asked more urgently. "Tell us and we'll help you."
Draco choked on his juice and Harry snorted in to his.
"Dumbledore." Hermione said, seeming to be on the same train of thought. "Dumbledore is one of the only wizards who can rival him, not to mention the only one he actually fears. He must be planning a way to get him out of the way."
He was there to help him this year. That was
…go away. With the light. It came from his room in to mine."
"Any Bond, let alone the Unbreakable, is evidently binding. I'm not sure what really happens down to a technical scale, but between two people, part of your magic has to…" Remus thought for a moment. "It has to connect, or entangle. At the moment, you two, part of your magic is connected in order to hold that bond."
Deciding he couldn't wait until the new school year to speak to Draco, he begun to write.
"So, what's with you and Cedric?"
"What did he do?" Ron asked eagerly.
"Not mad? Harry, he's got every right to be!"
"Bathroom." He pointed outside accordingly, giving her an unconvincing smile for show. Her eyes glinted with understanding, and she nodded casually, looking back down at her book as Ron and their friends continued a game of exploding snap without questioning him.
" Harry hissed again. He looked around and cautiously made his way to where Hermione was leaning over the ingredients table, inspecting a very volatile looking jar. He made sure to veer around Snape, an almost second nature instinct after three years of Potions.
"Fuck you! I don't want to do this!"
Draco dropped his spoon with a clatter on to the table, "You
"Hey." He said softly. "It's alright. Don't cry."
They apparated swiftly, melting in to the hoards of muggles trying to get to their trains. His parents both turned their noses up at them, but Draco just ignored them.
(See the end of the chapter for
, you pillock." Draco said through gritted teeth. Harry smiled up at him sheepishly, resting a hand on his other knee.
Harry shook his head, now bowed slightly. His breathing was coming in more evenly than from earlier, and the room's sharp atmosphere of uncontrolled magic was gone. Draco hadn't even realised it was there until it left.
Harry's trusty anger begun to flare, and he didn't have the energy to control it this time.
Potter yawned widely, "Still there unfortunately. I think I heard Hermione say it once. Or I could have made it up. I get weird when I'm tired."
What if they didn't really let Harry go back to Hogwarts? Would he have to stay with his muggle family, or would he be allowed to stay with his rightful guardian, Sirius? Granted the man was a wanted fugitive, but legally…
"It was significant!" Draco said indignantly. He brushed a stray lock of hair from his face with a huff, "And as I was saying, I'll remind you that a few months ago you said something about our agreement."
Blaise only laughed harder, shoulder shaking. “Shit, you can say
Draco clicked his tongue next to him. "Shoot a few spells, my arse." He said, tucking his wand away. "Constant vigilance, Potter!" He pointed a finger at Harry, mimicking Moody's barking tone.
"You're in no headspace to answer my questions." Draco said evenly, but the words were cold and sharp. "Calm down and stop shouting. Once you can -"
"I understand." Draco said gravely.
Harry stood, gaping at Ron before the boy whacked him in the arm.
intervene with my treatment or stress out my patient, do you understand?" The woman said harshly, making Draco's posture straighten out of habit.
He told himself.
"Your family?" Harry said, interest.
"The Ministry. A mole from the inside." Remus whispered.
Moody-" One of the teachers started, before a flash of red sparks lit up the air.
"Hey." Harry interjected, "I knew what I was bloody-"
"And Wormtail must have blabbed to Voldemort about my Animagus by now, so my big disguise is useless." Sirius grumbled.
go through this, I have no idea."
“Shut up! Sit down at once!” She stabbed a stubby finger at him.
"Just stop worrying, Draco. That Potter's influencing you a little too much." Blaise patted his shoulder.
Pulling on a simple jumper and trousers after his shower, Draco made his way to the Hall. Walking in, he could see that it was busier than usual due to the fact that most people woke up later on weekends. Walking to the Slytherin table, he glanced across the Hall to see Potter must have already left. He wondered what the boy even did on weekends. Probably studying with that academic hellion Granger. Draco then realised Potter didn't
"I lived in a bubble my parents had created. I accepted those ideologies my father taught me despite knowing from the world around me they just weren't true anymore."
"And here?" Potter said, resting his head on one hand.
Draco shut his eyes. That's exactly what he was afraid of. Nothing about the tournament seemed right.
"What are we doing here, Potter." He said, the words coming out in such a hoarse whisper he was unsure if Potter even heard them. Something flared in his chest at how plain the words came out, as if they might make a trail to something vulnerable inside Draco if someone knew to follow the path. Potter didn't look like he heard, but said after a moment,
Dumbledore watched silently, eyes fixed on Draco as much Draco's were on his.
It felt nice, but it also made him feel very lonely in the aftermath.
Harry scrambled, going to the door and realising it wasn't open on his side either. "It's locked!" He yelled, backing away.
"Three spoons."
"Yeah." Harry said absentmindedly, busy looking at Draco across the room whom looked infuriatingly comfortable and not-sweaty despite the circumstances, the only proof he was affected by the heat being his Slytherin robes draped gently over the side of his table. He was focused intently on his potion, looking between the cauldron and his textbook, tracing the lines of the page then tapping his lips rhythmically.
He crossed his arms, "And what makes you think I'll give you a meaningful apology that you're satisfied with?"
"What?"
"Hi." Harry said, and they stared at each other for a moment.
"Arrhythmia." He told himself, feeling an irregular rhythm beneath his palm. He really should get it checked soon.
Draco turned to fully face his Headmaster. “Well, he’s fine, of course.”
"Oh." Harry replied eloquently. They lapsed in to a more awkward silence than before.
"About this." Harry said, flicking a finger between him and Draco and putting on his glasses, "Just that we talk to each other like normal people now. I wouldn't say the rest at the moment."
"Wh- really?" Draco said excitedly, looking back at the house with wide eyes.
He couldn't help the small smile when he saw the name. "Idiot." He muttered under his breath. Hedwig took the opportunity to nip at his fingers again, and he drew away hissing. "Fine, you wench." He quickly gave her another treat and went to collect a quill and parchment.
"Er, Morning Ron."
"Since when are
, Mr. Weasley!”
"Oh." It dawned on him, causing a tightening in his chest from anxiety. "I erm…"
“Er, yeah.” Ron said hesitantly, but he still looked pleased.
.”, she continued in a tone that seemed casual but told him she was much more curious than she let on. “How is your father, by the way, Draco? I can call you that, yes? Draco?”
Harry turned to him with a scowl, expecting the question to be a jab at him, but Draco’s face was open and inquiring. “...Fine.” he grumbled, “I wouldn’t be able to explain it all to Ron and Hermione anyway.”
Breakfast was a difficult affair as although his appetite was still intact, every few seconds his stomach would flip at the thought of his second detention that evening and thoroughly put him off eating at all. A part of him was still numb to what he’d done the night before and he forcefully steered his mind away from the implications of it. It didn’t take Hermione or Draco to tell him it a bloody stupid thing to do, but he vaguely remembered thinking it was a worthy risk while he’d been doing it. Nonetheless, it was an idiotic move. What did he expect, for Merlin’s sake? For Umbridge to really think that he was…
“At least
"Ugh-" Blaise bumped in to his back. "What is it now- oh, for Merlin's sake." He swore when he spotted the compartment. "Draco, no-"
"You'll be fine." Harry said. He walked ahead of them and rested a hand on the door handle, looking back. "You know what to do, right?"
.” Pansy intoned in a cold, menacing tone. Draco spotted a child in the back shiver slightly when she spoke, which sent a surge of satisfaction through him . “Don’t forget it, or you might become very comfortable with the corridor floors at night.”
"But…Why?" Draco asked, ready to believe the two were either stupider or creepier than he originally thought.
“Wh- Fuck off!” Draco spluttered as his two friends collapsed into giggles.
"After what I heard today, we need to rethink."
Draco felt himself pale, "Pettigrew was here?"
"Regardless!" She hissed. "What were the clauses?" She asked insistently. Harry obediently repeated the clauses he had given Draco at the time of the Vow, including the extra fourth one he had added in last minute. Hermione listened with iron focus, while Ron stared on in shellshock.
"This Potter business is causing you too much stress, Draco." Pansy said on his other side.
Maybe just Granger, though. Weasley would always be…well, Weasley.
"It all started after last term-"
“I was . . . I fancied a walk,” said Ron shiftily.
"Well, well. Didn't see this coming." He said with a wry grin. Within a moment, the two popped out of sight and reappeared next to Draco, inciting an embarrassing yelp from him.
"No, actually. Well - yes, but I'm talking about the Ministry. It's corrupt."
"Professor?" Hermione and everyone else looked at the man, concerned. Remus didn't respond, only bringing out his wand to cast a spell at the door.
Harry began to write, starting up the cycle of pain again,
"Well, that's the funny thing, isn't it. I'm one of the only few people who
" Harry retorted.
"Well, you did ask."
"What difference does it make that I was muggle raised?" Harry yelled, unwillingly looking at Malfoy standing defensively with the meter distance luckily restored.
Draco's mouth curled involuntarily in to a smile. "Well the spell requires a bonder, and I know just the person who can bond us right now."
"Just say you liked the style and did it yourself-"
Harry looked at him side-along, their eyes finally meeting, "It hasn't been that long, has it?" He smiled teasingly.
." Remus huffed. "Don't be a dick - oh shit. Excuse my language, kids-"
Harry held up a hand and she quietened again.
"Please find strength for a little while longer, Harry. I will have you in the Hospital Wing soon enough."
"She can bloody watch me take a pile in the shitter for all I care." Draco sat forward, throwing out a hand insistently, "But as a the new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts? Was that
"Charlie's here, too?"
“...and so after you sign a form that legally hands over the item to the Ministry, submissions are critically processed by our archive specialists and assigned a number…”
His mother looked at him, and despite the obscure question, understood what he meant. "I do." She said, taking another sip of her tea.
"Er, yes." Draco said. "That's pretty much it."
. Just like first year all over again!"
"So, mate." Ron said, sidling up to him. Hermione followed and sat on his other side, while the twins and Ginny sat on the other side.
"Potter thinks…
"Really? That’s good then." Harry said, relieved slightly. "Who was it?"
"In any case," Remus continued, "gathering followers is only one thing he’s interested in, he’s got other plans too, plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed, and he’s concentrating on them at the moment. That's why Dumbledore's revving up, too, but he won't say it."
Draco froze, hand on his wand. He slowly looked up. As far as he knew, he was alone. Unless he was seriously ill, or confunded, or going insane, or all three, a disembodied voice really just said his name.
"Harry, mate. You got the Evergreen?" Ron said as he peered at the textbook as if it might bite him.
"Yeah." Harry waved him off, "I'm going to tell you something and you
Anger erupted in him at her wording. He knew she was just goading him on again, so he just settled for a shake of his head, “No, ma’am.” He took the quill quickly, its weight heavy in his hand.
Draco's hands gripped his sheets tightly, trying his best not to glare at his Head of House.
"Malfoy?" Came a voice in front of him.
"Mum's gone and cast an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door."
that?" Harry asked from the floor, breaking the tense silence as Mrs. Weasley stunned the last portrait and Tonks returned downstairs while muttering something about a Troll's leg.
It took a moment before Blaise's face lit up in astonishment.
"Draco! Do you hear yourself?"
“What do you want, Harry?” Mrs. Weasley called. “Porridge? Muffins? Kippers? Bacon and eggs? Toast?”
“Erm, I’m his... other son.” he lied on the spot. Blaise stepped on his foot painfully and he barely held back a yelp. “We’re stepbrothers.” he bit out, eyes watering.
"Draco." The voice, Harry's, murmured low in his ear. "It's not him. It's the real one."
Draco smiled, "Hence the tea." He repeated. "How long've you been up?"
"So do I." Harry retorted. "But are we in agreement?"
“Witherby. He could have been the one referred to because he’d let my father have those files - off the record. There might not have been a sender address because they didn’t want to get traced back to referring to some clerk who let Lucius Malfoy into the Magical Archives in case he was caught.”
He dropped it again.
Sodding Malfoy.
situation these past few years. I simply repeated the remarks my father would say, but I know that they're wrong now and I'd just like to apologise for myself." He said the words before he could think about them, but felt an immense amount of relief after (even if he did feel like throwing up as well).
"And will you reveal any and all information about Voldemort and his followers to me, Dumbledore or our allies, granted your safety is secured first?"
Harry chuckled, "The whole day, though? What about your friends, Pansy and Blasé?" Harry said, commending himself for knowing the other Slytherin bloke's name.
The smile Draco didn't know he had on his face faded immediately. "Shit!" He turned to see them smoking and steadily blackening. He quickly took the pan off the stove, coughing through the smoke billowing in to his face.
The crowd roared and the band rumbled in a cacophony of trumpets and fanfares.
The summer before Fourth Year, Draco's father was much busier than usual, so he rarely saw him. His mother left him alone mostly, so he was left to his own devices to hang around the Manor grounds by himself as the days passed. It should have been lonely, but it didn't feel like it. He would often go deep in to the woods at the very edge of the grounds, just exploring because he'd never done it before and realised no one was there who could stop him. He would pace with even steps through the woods, counting different species of potions ingredients he saw on the way on his fingers and stopping only when he reached ten, then starting again. It was incredibly peaceful, and he would often be out there from morning after breakfast, until dusk when a House Elf would summon him. It gave him a lot of time to think for himself, and something deep in his chest cracked in to place just slightly during that summer beneath the July sun.
, Potter! Now, or I will extend your punishment throughout the weekend!”
"Ah, Harry!" One of them said.
Harry looked up at Umbridge. She was watching him, her wide, toadlike mouth stretched in a smile. Fear washed over him briefly, like ice cold water had been injected into his bloodstream as he felt malicious intent being directed at him from the woman. It wasn’t like he hadn’t felt such an aura being directed at him before, but it was extremely disconcerting to be feeling it from a teacher, within an environment such as a classroom where he was presumably meant to be safe. Of course, however, this
"Potter." He heard Draco behind him. "
Harry suppressed a laugh at the image of Malfoy crying out as a huge squid past his windows while he was in bed. He settled for a crooked smile which he tried to hide by angling his head away from Malfoy and to the lake, a mirror of how they sat the night of the Ball.
Harry strode forward, down on to his knees by Draco and wrapped him up in his arms. Draco didn't let himself hug the boy back, but was nonetheless pleased by the show of gratitude. Not that he'd have ever admitted it out loud. Whether he smiled in to the boy's shoulder just a little, he wouldn't have admitted either.
"It attacked both of us." Harry said resignedly.
"You're okay?" Harry asked, voice still hoarse and eyes searching Draco for evidence of injury.
'You know I love you, right Ron?" Harry said jokingly, poking his friend in the side. Ron's eyes widened and he squirmed away with a sharp exhale.
"Who bloody has?"
"And yours, Ron?" Harry asked, finishing off massacring his parchment and corking their potion.
Malfoy nodded, "I saw you in the woods, remember? A bit before the Dark Mark went up."
"Which is why he's gathering all sorts of people this time around." Sirius said, crossing his arms, "He's trying to recruit not just people, but creatures. Giants, Goblins, the likes."
"Technically, I found this place first. Never mind that I brought you to it." Harry would always say, and Draco would leave it at that.
"Joke shop's still on, then?" Harry smiled.
!" Draco roared, "Are you fucking insane?"
” Harry slammed the table with his fist again, and the room went silent again for the next few seconds, the only sound was the heavy breathing of Harry himself.
"Wha - I - What do you mean…I mean there's nothing wrong with Cedric. And me. There's nothing wrong with me and Cedric-"
.” Harry chastised.
His father was trying to access something beneath Level 2 as well, he vaguely remembered. This was a good opening for him, it seemed. Lancaster had looked a little spineless; it wouldn’t take much for Draco to get him to agree to something-
"Yes, I'm…bugger."
Walking back to Harry with the two cups in hand, the light from outside was now brighter and Draco could see how rough Harry really looked. He bit his tongue about it, sliding him a cup and then taking a seat across him.
"He threw himself in front of me when I was about to be cursed. I owe him my life." Harry said resolutely. Was this the same person crying in his arms a while ago?
Harry winced. "Erm, Sirius."
-o-o-
Draco’s arms fell to his sides. His body tensed without his permission. “You must be more specific, Professor. I’m sure there were many nights for Harry,” he said quietly.
“Merlin,” Draco blew out a sharp breath, massaging his forehead. “No more talk about that woman, please. She’s too agonising to be thinking about this much.”
Harry can't help his mouth from falling open, "The squid has a name?"
hurting because they'd say the same thing, and I don't
." Draco glared at Ronald, but the ginger paid no mind.
“Snuffles?” Draco inquired curiously.
"That we're friends, of course!" He called back, and turned away again before he could see the boy's reaction. The split second of realisation in the boy's eyes had been enough.
“I am him!” Harry roared, shooting out of his chair and sending it a short distance behind him with a loud scrape. He slammed a fist down on her desk, “I am
"Why have you silenced the room?" Draco asked, his eyebrows drawn together in confusion.
-o-o-
"Of course not! I figured I should take this not being a dickhead thing seriously. You are now looking at the new Draco Malfoy, Blaise! I prosper around muggleborns and half-bloods, giving charity and tranquil presence across Hogwarts! They bask in my pureblooded-ness. My adoring fans flock for my affection-"
"Oh God." Hermione whispered immediately, horrified. "Why? What did you and Draco do?"
"Diggory." His mother said, "A good family." She looked at Draco sadly, "Their boy was the last heir."
Draco hoped Harry would use his head enough to understand what he was asking.
. Many students knew by their second week neither to disturb them nor try using the table. They never really had the chance, though. The trio were said to be seen sitting there from as soon as classes ended all the way until dinner everyday. Maybe even more than that.
"It's
"I'm the last for the Malfoys and Harry's the last Potter, so we're all the last of our lines. At least Sirius technically has Harry to inherit everything." Draco said gravely, then straightened up, turning away. "Let's get back to work. I want this all done by noon."
hi! I'm a bit excited this week because this chapter is or was supposed to be posted on the 27th, which is this fic's one year anniversary!!! exactly one year ago today, I randomly posted the first chapter of this fic and now I'm all the way at 160K words with lots and lots of people who somehow like what I write.
Harry did it.
"Oh." He said, surreptitiously withdrawing his legs from Harry's vicinity. "Good Morning, ma'am."
"I'm sorry. It's just me." He said immediately in a placating tone, eyeing Harry's wand.
the bloody house, within the room of none other than the late matriarch of one of the oldest pure-blood wizarding families in Britain.
"Just
prefect?"
At Harry's quirked head in confusion, Draco explained, "The newspapers talk about you. Not good things. They don't believe you or Dumbledore and are rapidly trying to denounce him to the public."
It was time to formally meet the Order of the Phoenix.
“Spacing again.”
"I can see everybody from here. Can't you?" And at Harry's expression he continued hastily, "Oh don't worry, Potter. Nobody else can see you except me. Look over there." He pointed across the grounds to the small archway to the courtyard. "From here I can see in between the stone pillars all the way to the entrance of the school, although you wouldn't be able to tell from there. You wouldn't be able to see us but we can see them."
"Ron, grab him."
“Why do you think the Ministry’s done that, then?” Blaise asked, patting the man on the back sympathetically. Draco saw him grimace slightly. It was surely weird, the man being his mum’s new husband and all. Blaise had always expressed that the novelty of his mother having a new partner every so often never wore off.
"Right, well I slept inhumanely early last night and now I'm up. What's your excuse." Draco said, not knowing why he was so open to chat but cocking it up to the nice change of scenery.
He glanced up at the clock mounted on the wall: half-past five. Harry was surely already fulfilling his first detention of the week with her, whatever it may be. Draco shivered at the thought. Being alone with Umbridge was a punishment on its own, by anyone’s standards.
"Why aren't you eating?" Draco said conversationally, picking up the apple and taking a hearty bite out of it.
Harry felt something creep in to the back of his throat, making it hard to swallow.
Pansy looked at him delightedly when she saw him, "Draco! Man of the hour! Many of us were just discussing you and a certain-"
"I didn’t mean it like that." Draco snapped. "What about
"You can throw off the Imperius." Hermione said, waving her hand away, "But I really don't mind if he's not bullying people or pushing his Pureblood agenda anymore. Neither does Ron. Right, Ron?" She said, nudging him. Ron nodded gruffly.
at the Ministry these days, after all!”
"Shit." Ron muttered, running a hand through his hair.
"I don't know what planet I woke up on," Potter said next to him, "But for some reason there are some things I can say here that I can't tell my own friends."
"Hi." Harry said.
He heard a muttered spell from Malfoy and braced for the worst, squeezing his eyes shut. After a moment of nothing happening, Harry opened them, feeling something falling from the top of his head.
“Harry? Are you sick?” It was Ron again, but this time he was closer and was placing a hand on Harry’s back. Harry looked up to see his friend’s worried face in the mirror and he immediately looked away wearily as nausea threatened to take him under again.
"Well, Ron? Is his name Theodore…"
“Look at today!” Ron whined. “History of Magic, double Potions, Divination, and double Defense Against the Dark Arts . . . Binns, Snape, Trelawney, and that Umbridge woman all in one day!
Draco pretended not to notice the boy's cries, and continued to work until lunch.
Then his vision of the ground blurred in front of him, and he was grateful for his crossed arms and knees that hid his face from the other boy. God, why couldn't Malfoy just fuck off somewhere else? Why was he always at the Lake? Just sitting there and studying and existing and now Harry had just come to clear his head a bit but instead he was about to cry right in front of him. Harry didn't want to cry, he
Soon, they were slowly approaching March and the nights by the Lake were becoming less and less brisk. They didn't meet all the time, but only when they managed to catch each other doing their work or having a break in the spot.
Draco grit his teeth. “Fine,” he bit out, “anything you need done, I’ll do it for you. Fair?”
His scar throbbed slightly, but the pain had mostly left along with the corridor.
"No!" Draco shouted next to him, throwing himself in front of Harry with an expression that looked as if every movement caused him pain. Harry knew that look. He had it too, at that moment, but the adrenaline running through his veins numbed him from the pain almost completely.
Umbridge stiffened, and for a moment Harry wondered if he’d pushed things too far. The only reason he’d mentioned Lucius was in the hopes that her memory would be too scrambled from the day before to know for sure if she really had said something, and that there was no other reason he should have known about the man if not for her saying something about it.
these days, don’t you think?” Her tone dropped almost comically low and menacing at the mention of external influences, almost as if the very thought caused her discomfort.
“It’s Mr. Malfoy, child.” Draco batted said child away. “Don’t address your superiors so familiarly. Have your parents taught you nothing?”
"First one to fall asleep in class has to bring something to eat next time." Malfoy said, and Harry remembered he didn't see the boy at dinner.
"Cutting it a bit close, Potter?"
"It's fine." Harry said. "We're fine."
"Sixty-eight percent." Harry repeated in disbelief.
Merlin, it was him who had just probably moved the wand. He had used magic…without his wand. Harry sat up slowly once again, keeping his eyes fixed on the wand. He squinted at it, almost tauntingly as if it would jump up in to a song and dance.
"Are you lot ignoring me?" Ronald said in disbelief, but Draco made a point of ignoring the boy while sharing a surreptitious smirk with Granger to his surprise.
"Oh. Erm…Sorry, Draco."
"Right." Blaise said in a pleased tone Draco didn't trust. "Well…?" He trailed off inquiringly.
"It's not even my fault!" Harry yelled.
"May I help you?" Severus droned irritably, but Draco paid no mind.
"The final one." Harry swallowed. "How come you know what it is-"
“You think so?” Draco asked, more rhetorically than literally to prompt the man to say more.
"He pleaded he was under the influence of Imperius the entire time. That and gold. Lots and lots of gold."
"Hey Harry." Ron mumbled when Harry stepped in to the Common Room. The boy was focused on yet another chess game with Seamus, whom either pityingly believed he could actually win or was a tragic masochist for failure. Hermione barely acknowledged him, but that was nothing new when her head was buried in a new book she'd procured from a bookshop down in Hogsmeade.
Harry smiled at Draco, "Yeah." But his smiled wavered and he flicked his eyes away from him.
Draco thought about it for a moment, finger's coming up to his temple's instinctively but quickly whipping away before Potter saw.
Draco avoided his gaze, "Not exactly." He said quietly.
forgive me lmao. life is crazy
"Well - well, if he's a bit strange, it's not his fault."
"What?"
The woman was sitting behind her desk as the day before, but this time she had her arms crossed over the desk as if she were waiting expectantly for him.
" A voice murmured softly in Harry's ear. The person pulled back, and Harry's breath hitched when he saw it was Malfoy. The boy didn't look at Harry, instead smirking at Snape as he left as if he hadn't just whispered the answer in Harry's ear.
, Potter, for how much I want to hex you right now." He spat,  and Harry had to bite down a grin because of the boy's scalding tone in contrast to his pathetically disheveled appearance. Draco groaned and threw a hand over his eyes. "Now I have a headache. Thanks."
Two knocks. "Mother?"
, Harry. I know enough. I said I could handle him, and I can alright?" Draco snapped, his face immediately filling with regret after.
Harry nodded, noting the concern in Draco's eyes that wasn't unlike the way Hermione looked at him sometimes. "I'll be fine."
kind of harmless. He grinded his teeth together, incredibly annoyed but plastering a fake smile on his face so the man would just
"You won't like it." He said. And if Draco said it, Harry probably wouldn't. "It's in Snape's office."
to the Yule Ball, Harry?' " Draco said, batting his eyelashes like a bloody whore.
" 'Lo, Professor." The twins appeared from apparition with a dull crack, to Mrs. Weasley's discontent. "Seems you've finally returned." Fred said dully, "Sirius here's been pining like a-"
, just like him? Definitely fits the role - that is, besides the pink.”
Walking in to the kitchen, Harry was met with a commotion at the far and of the table. Peering around Tonks, he saw what - or whom - everyone was excited about.
in his sleep.
"Alright, sorry." Blaise threw his hands up in surrender and Pansy's scowl faded. Draco shot him a heavy glare anyway, wishing it would crush the boy beneath his gaze.
He wasn't sure if it was Potter's passion, or what he said that was so convincing, but being a lover of logic, Draco really couldn't argue with what Potter said.  He'd wondered some time after that if someone had maybe told him all this earlier, then it might have saved him from killing who he was to be his father all his life.
"I don't give a toss, Harry! You just told an ex-convict-" He ignored Harry's scowl because damn him, Draco was the one who should have been angry at the moment, "-that I was, what? Defecting? A spy? A complete idiot for trusting you?"
"Of course." He replied, and he meant it. He didn't know how he would have gotten through the summer's with the Dursley's without their letters.
"A bit grey…" Harry repeated, the weight of Malfoy's words dawning on him. He finally began to understand what Malfoy meant, the parts about his mother. It was extremely risky, what he was proposing, double siding Voldemort and his supporters, as well as his own father. Slowly, Harry nodded, drawing a relieved sigh from the other boy.
Draco's head shot up again. "I am, too!"
sound like Draco. "Posh git." He muttered under his breath, as if Draco weren't sitting right next to him. Draco seriously considered punching him in the stomach. The idiot left himself wide open and everything.
"Save it, Draco." Snape commanded with a raised hand. Glancing around, he said in a low tone, "I will convene with you tomorrow about this…arrangement. Until then I won't say anything to your mother and father, although they will be…surprised to say the least, if I did. For now, enjoy the Ball." He swung his robes around and billowed away in a sea of fabric. Draco huffed out a breath he had been holding in his Godfather's presence. Great. Now the greasy bastard's going to snitch on him. Draco liked Severus
“It’s definitely been a while.” Draco acknowledged, which made Blaise chuckle.
“Like the Ministry,” Draco suggested.
“Blaise.” Draco said.
When Draco felt it safe, he pulled Harry into an alcove where they were least likely to run into a stray student.
Draco saw Ronald and Granger in the corner, just shy of looking like animals backed in to a corner. "We wanted to -"
In a spiteful haste to get back at the woman, Harry hit the ground running at the start of the evening and went through three sheets of parchment (written double sided, as courtesy of the toad) by the half-way point of his detention. At that point, though, he was starting to feel light-headed so he slowed down. The pain in his hand was astounding by that point, leeching all the way up arm.
"Extendable Ears." Fred said proudly.
, and nothing more! I wish not to speak about it with anyone, so don't bother slithering over to me - I'm looking at you Martha Hefley -" He said warningly, pointing at a particularly nosy second year that had been known to gossip in the past. The girl withered under his gaze, and he continued, "If you have any questions, please shove them. Thank you." He said, dismissing the now sour students at the table and sitting down once again. The first and second years looked intimidated and disappointed and many of the students in years older to Draco looked at him angrily, yet he pretended to pay no mind.
"So you spring this kind of thing on Harry, who hadn't any idea what it meant-"
"Hi." The Weasley said once he'd reached him. He was still sat in his chair and was leaning languorously with his arm draped over the back. His head was tilted back as he faced Draco without turning his entire body and he held out a hand to shake. "Name's Bill."
. Maybe even
“Well, let’s not linger in the halls. Come in, you two.” She stepped aside to let the two pass, Harry shooting him a pointed look that he only corresponded with a glare.
"It…" Snape started, a strange expression on his face Draco could only place as fear, "It is all true, Draco. He is back." the man clutched his left arm, and Draco stiffened. He had forgotten whom he was really speaking to.
"Yes, sir." He said anyway.
“What, like unity?” Harry asked. “I can’t imagine how the Hat would know about him.”
"Now where in Godric's name do we get some of the stuff?" Harry asked him. Draco blew a strand of hair out of his eyes.
Disgusting. He thought he’d had enough time to forget the bad taste he got in his mouth from the sight of her toadlike appearance and overly sweet demeanor, but that obviously wasn’t the case. He could almost hear Draco’s grunt of disgust from across the hall.
" 'We cannot sing above the ground' is quite obvious. I agree that it's probably merpeople." Draco confirmed after Harry finished, "And there are merpeople in the Lake. They sometimes show up on the first few days of school to spook the First Years in the Common Room. Sadistic buggers, the lot of them."
He near growled in frustration. "You lot, move." He snapped at them, and they turned to look at him, eyes wide. They hesitated in place, and that only made him more irritated. Something old in him clicked in to place. "
Harry spat at his feet, spelling the man in to silence. He seethed, glaring at Harry with murderous vehemence.
“Did you just come from detention?” Ron asked, face blooming with red as if he were embarrassed. At the reminder of detention, however, bile rose in Harry’s throat. He braced his hand over his mouth and Ron gasped.
Draco nodded slowly, trying to let the information sink in but finding it difficult with so much at once. Harry didn't notice, and continued.
." Draco hissed warningly. "Just
"Did he make you bleed?" He heard his mother say. He opened his eyes to look at her, and she was staring at him critically.
"I wanted to be here for you guys, most of all." Remus said, and Sirius patted him on the knee. "Speaking of, I believe there's one more of you now?"
Harry nodded even though Malfoy wouldn't have been able to see it. It was more to himself than anything.
"Okay. Bloody hell…If you trust him then fine. I'll take your word for it." And Harry sagged a little, wiping some of the accumulated perspiration on his forehead. "But, please promise you'll be careful. You may be able to trust him, but would others be able to? If he's willing to protect you, what about Ron and Hermione? People he isn't as close to? Slytherins are fickle people, Harry. They will defend anything that's theirs, but that’s as far as it goes. Best self-interests in mind at all times. It's hard to change people like them."
"Right, that'll be him." Remus said. He looked at Draco again, with something in his eyes that Draco didn't understand. After a moment, he realised it was affection, although he didn't know what on earth he could have done to deserve it.
"I won't. I'll be back." He said back, the words he'd said to Draco the night before echoing out of him after having spent the entire day with them clattering at the forefront of his mind.
, and they were not.
“We, erm, talked about Umbridge.” Harry said, unsure of how else to explain everything else. The memory of the conversation only blurred together even more after a full night’s sleep. “He said he'd write it down for us. It was a lot.”
Rounding a corner before Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, however, he bumped into someone.
Umbridge’s eye twitched and she said nothing for a few seconds.
." Said Pansy. "It's a disgrace to this house, it is."
“Yeah. Amelia Bones is okay, Harry,” said Tonks earnestly. “She’s fair, she’ll hear you out.”
"Do you think Dumbledore suspects someone?" Harry asked. "And why protect Draco's information from them?"
do you think you're going?" Vernon spat, bounding down the stairs.
"I know you took it, Blaise!" He heard an annoying voice yell. Definitely Nott. Draco kept his eyes closed in the hopes that either of them would kill the other or
"Draco." She started again. "Answer me."
Harry stared at him. His mouth was probably agape as he stared at Draco with blurry vision without his glasses. He kept them off; he was better off not seeing the boy that much at the moment lest he become more frustrated.
"Harry." Sirius beckoned him with a finger as Remus begun to speak to Tonks on the other side. Harry got up, going to lean in to Sirius as the man whispered in his ear. "We need to talk to Remus about the Vow."
At the mention of his last name from Draco, Harry turned away and threw himself on to the bed across the only other in the room, which was occupied by Harry's friends. He sat and drew his knees up to his chest, his head turned away. The sight looked so small and vulnerable that Draco had to tear his eyes away back to Granger.
Draco dug in to his porridge. Harry, beside him, managed a few bites which although few, satisfied Draco. As they ate, Draco watched Remus, who he hadn't seen eat at all, turn his head slightly to where Sirius's head was resting. The man paused in that position, as if thinking about something with the smallest twitch of a smile on his face, head close to Sirius's. After a moment, he reached up and grabbed Sirius's arm, jostling it gently.
"It wasn't even funny." Malfoy lied. Harry's grin grew wider.
" Harry finished, expecting raucous positive feedback at his joke. Instead he got Ron staring him with a sympathetic look on his face and a few people around him looking at him weirdly. He was pretty sure he saw Snape stop and stare at him in the corner of his eye.
"Mm." Harry replied, waiting a few moments before adding, "Okay, then. Goodnight."
Harry blew out a huff, "In a meeting." And Ron mirrored him.
Ron guffawed at Draco. "Mate, you're gonna love this one-"
That night, he hurriedly entered his room after sneaking in to the house and threw his trunk open. He rustled through it, sifting through textbooks and scrap pieces of used parchment, even the still very much alive Hungarian Horntail, until he found a blank parchment and quill.
“Then I’ll do it.” Harry interrupted simply.
"Potter, there's also something else we need to discuss." Malfoy said, his tone now serious.
"What? Harry, then what could you have done?" Draco said incredulously.
Screaming. He didn't know if it was his mother's or his own.
Forcing himself not to punch himself in the face, Harry knocked.
"Riveting."
After lunch was Care of Magical Creatures, which went as expected for a lesson without Hagrid. Although Professor Grubbly-Plank showed them some admittedly interesting Bowtruckles, he still felt subjectively biased to Hagrid and the bizarre creatures he showed them.
All the Weasley's and Hermione exchanged darkly significant looks.
Draco's eyebrows drew up in surprise, "Oh. Okay, yeah. I won't."
-o-o-
He looked down at Malfoy next to him, having forgotten the boy was still there. Malfoy seemed to be lost in thought, and Harry knew he had forgotten Harry was there too. Not wanting to be caught staring, he moved his eyes back to the crowd, but felt something in his chest stir at the image in his head. He didn't want to look back, but he desperately felt urge to look at the boy again. The way Harry saw him just then had looked so different to how he usually looked. It was…jarring. His face was suddenly all soft lines and smooth curves. It was such a juxtaposition to how Malfoy usually composed himself, but just then Malfoy was anything
“Well, it’s quite impressive, but there are many misconceptions on why units are sorted there.”
of that bloody clock.
Harry gaped. "What more do you want from me?"
Harry bit down the urge to ask Malfoy about his first encounter with the merpeople and let the boy continue.
in order not to trip on his way to their spot. He had a fleeting moment of gratitude over him when he realised he could cast magic freely, equally fighting a quiver when he remembered his Hearing.
"They said they
"Private lessons." Snickered George next to him.
“The Ministry?” Umbridge asked. She was near hovering over her desk by how much she was leaning forward to hear him speak. She was hooked on his words now. Good.
Harry bit his tongue so hard he thought he might sever it from his mouth. Snape wouldn't really do that, would he? Wasn't it illegal? Harry grit his teeth and stared back at the man glowering down at him, letting his resentment bleed through his eyes in hopes it might drown the man. He felt Ron's hand grip his arm under the table warningly, sensing Harry's bubbling anger from the static magic simmering out of him.
They were all spread around the living room of the house, Ron and Hermione sat together and Harry and Sirius sitting opposite Remus. Luckily, the rest of the Weasley's had taken a trip through the floo back to the Burrow to do some errands, leaving them all alone in the house.
“S’ fine, mate.”
“No, don’t think so.” Harry bit out. “He’d kill me.”
"Let's go now. By the Lake. Who knows how much time we have." Harry said, trying to coax a reaction out of the boy by telling him what to do. Malfoy, however, just nodded again. Harry cocked it up to something spiked in the Pumpkin juice, and nudged the boy to start moving. The glassy quality in his grey eyes disappeared, and Harry felt something in him stir. Hoping Malfoy would follow, he moved quietly out the Hall and prayed nobody saw them leave.
"Mine's bloody blue. How does that work?" He asked, staring to pack up along with Harry. Harry shrugged and went to put his extra ingredients and deposit his shitty potion at Snape's desk, telling Ron to go ahead to Charms without him.
"And?" Harry said, trying his luck.
." Remus warned.
"I'd rather hold hands with a bunch of thorny rose stems." Draco bowed once more the Buckbeak, then turned away to start towards the door.
Harry came in to his room later that night, popping his head through the door after a light few knocks.
"Fucking hell, Potter. Are you smoking something?"
Harry shook his head and Malfoy picked up the apple between them and chucked it at him.
Draco had to admit, this had to be one of his
"You are dismissed for the day." His father said, and Draco held his sigh of relief in until he left the room with the door closed behind him.
"It's a good opportunity to practice some spells for the next task." Hermione said, already pulling out a book from her seemingly endless bag.
"Alright, you git. We get it. What's your stake in it, then." Blaise said haughtily.
“What?” Draco leaned forward urgently, “They want to interfere with Hogwarts directly? Is that legal?”
"I didn't
Draco was having a tea break in the kitchen at the time, with Ronald, Hermione and the rest of the Weasley children. Remus and Sirius had disappeared off somewhere, probably to catch up more on the almost fourteen years lost between them. Draco didn't know why, but he felt like the bond between the two ran deeper than that of most friendships.
"I can, but it would be much weaker. Practically useless."
"None else. Half of what he knew at your age still overtakes everything you know now. He formed that spell - or so he says."
"Draco." Harry's voice came from above him.
"Did he really tell Dumbledore he had grubby hands earlier?" Ron asked in a horrified whisper after a moment.
"Huh?" He said lamely.
. He wasn't used to this much attention, despite getting horrendously doted on when he was a child. Back then it was fun. Now it was just unnerving.
"Right, I know. I know it's a lot. But look at me.' Harry flicked his eyes in to Draco's, the cool grey seeping in to his, "If there's one thing I'll ever ask of you, and Merlin knows I don't deserve it one bit, it's your
"Both of you are idiots." Pansy chimed in next to them.
A sharp tug in his gut popped them immediately into the Ministry atrium. Draco stumbled upon landing, his stomach flipping at the uncomfortable feeling of the Portkey’s transportation.
. All he seemed to be doing was looking down, shoulders hunched, as he listened to Granger speak and the Weasel look on pityingly.
"Now, you don't." Hermione scoffed rudely, but looked away with a shake of her head with unwilling acceptance.
"Potter, look." He grabbed Harry's arm to spin him around. With a rush of adrenaline, he did, expecting some form of danger - or even worse, Filch and his cat. Instead, he found himself looking at the horizon spanning the Great Lake. If he had turned back around again, he would have been able to believe it was still nightfall, but the gentle gradient of colour from navy blue to purple to red was breath-taking as the first dredges of dawn broke. The sun was still pale, and Harry could look at it properly without squinting.
The boy's eyes opened slightly then closed, fluttering through a haze of fuzzy wakefulness. Draco watched his eyebrows furrow and a frown settle on his face. His fringe was curled over his forehead, almost plastered with sweat.
Blaise retracted his hand primly. “Prick.”
Draco swallowed quickly, "Very well, father. Thank you." The room felt overwhelmingly cold, and it just made the sweat on his body cause him to want to convulse in to shivers. He couldn't help but briefly flit his eyes at his father's left arm. The words started to chant themselves in his head.
“If it makes it any better,” Harry tried to reason with him, “It’s almost green. If you look at them in the dark, that is.”
"Oh, none of that." Hermione waved the idea off angrily. "They have to. It wasn't your bloody fault."
And he especially hoped, with all his being, that they would survive this whole thing together. Sometimes it seemed impossible, but Draco was a fairly competent Wizard, and so was Harry (although he wouldn't admit it in front of him). Harry's friends weren't so bad either - emphasis on Granger rather than the Weasel. He had never been nice to them, but he really hoped he could make it up to them for not just his own sake, but Harry's.
"Right." Draco took another sip. "Well, since we're both here, I should tell you what that meeting was about."
Harry just shook his head with a small, deprecating smile.
earlier.
Immediately, all the Weasley children started awkwardly clearing their throats at once, turning their heads away as Hermione laughed at them. The smile dropped from Draco's face, and he collapsed in to his arms again. Bloody Weasley's.
His overthinking grew so bad as five o’clock approached that he’d thrown up in anticipation and anxiety once again, just twenty minutes before his detention. Luckily there was no one in the bathroom at the time and he made sure to keep his head down and eyes away from the mirror, lest he made things worse for his state of mind. On the plus side, it did ease his stomach marginally and allowed him the smallest comfort to be able to face Umbridge again.
"It wasn't until Mum heard us saying it that we found out it was true. She even went as far as threatening to wring our necks if we said or did anything bad to you, she believed in you that much."
Harry followed behind Dumbledore all the way up to his office, a bound Moody levitating with them. Once in the office, several other teachers were present, and all stared at Harry with varying degrees of shock and horror.
before that!"
"Thank you, Hermione." Harry said, trying to smile but instead looking like he was grimacing. He felt like he was walking on eggshells around something neither wanted to admit first. Hermione looked at him not unlike the way Draco did when he was thinking about something.
"He was fully aware of it!" Harry said defensively, "He told me all of it himself beforehand. Believe me, I tried to refuse, but it was more of a positive for him than anything else."
"MALFOY!" Harry yelled, startling the boy awake with a harsh snort. His eyes immediately found Harry and he
Without a word, she spoke the password and led the First Years inside, Draco hanging back to ensure there were no stragglers. Once inside, his eyes roamed around the familiar common room as the trademark chill set in to his skin. He stood in front of the closed entrance, surveying the room. Students were scattered around from varying grades. What was most noticeable, of course, was the scene that took place at the beginning of every school year.
Harry emptied whatever was left in his stomach into the sink. When he was done, he shook his head for Ron to see, who was standing frozen at the entrance to the bathroom. “M’ fine,” he said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. “Go back to-”
"Sir." He starts in question in between breaths. His father's back was turned, flexing his wand wrist and staring outside a window as he waited to start the next bout of dueling.
He mouthed, and was met with a chuckling nod that had Hermione swatting him upside the head.
Making sure to cast a wandless
"Of course, you hag. You're not my mother." Draco huffed.
"It's not S.P.E.W!" Hermione protested. "It's The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. And the Elf's name is Kreacher." She crossed her arms over her chest and Draco stared at her, aghast.
He heard Weasley huff in amusement, then after a moment said, "Oh, I see."
Umbridge stayed smiling at him, head tilted as if to boast:
It's a bit unusual because i personally rarely ever see it, but i decided to stay true to Jackass Rowling's spectacular mystic of prose and use consistent capital letters for whenever Harry is shouting. I always thought there was some unspoken rule where you couldn't actually do that, but ig it's a thing for her. Harry must be bloody loud. Trust me, it felt weird and improper, but the texts are what they are.
She stared at him for a moment before nodding and leaving him alone in the kitchen. He itched to go and see what the news was about Harry, but his knee had begun to throb, and it stung every time he tried to put pressure on it.
Draco sighed.
"Good. See how you were almost hit by that spell - almost a second too late. You spent too much time turning your body to the spell when you could have been blocking it. Turn back to how you were." His father commanded.  Draco went back to the position he was in before, his father still to his far left.
"Since the twins told me some
He straightened down his robes where the child had tugged at him. “Quite a silly question, don’t you think?” He asked nonchalantly.
"Professor!" Ron and Hermione came bounding behind Harry excitedly.
“And I’m sure that there would have indeed been some….occurrences at the Ministry lately, in response to such rumours. It’s only natural, of course. Changes are bound to happen…”
?" Pansy exclaimed.
"They said at the hearing, some stuff about who might have sent the Dementor after me. Dumbledore said the Ministry's the one's who give Dementors orders, so it's their fault one attacked me. Gave them a real fright." Harry chuckled, which then turned in to a long yawn.
Draco let his head fall again, shutting his eyes and hoping they would all disappear as soon as possible.
“Oh really? What misconceptions are those?”
Ron collapsed in to the chair, muttering incoherently and Harry collapsed next to him with a great sigh. They both stared at the fire in silence for a few tense minutes before Ron managed to find the ability to speak, "Hermione left while you were still…fighting."
Harry brought out his cloak from his pocket, horrendously balled up. "Keep the cloak for me." He said, handing it to him.
Draco did so, then continued to work in a comfortable silence among them as the kitchen begun to fill with the sounds of food being made.
Draco watched Harry and Cedric run in to the maze, instantly obscuring them from view. Not long after, Fleur and Krum went in behind them. The cheers went down after that. Now all they could do was watch the maze until someone shot red sparks or found the Cup wherever it was.
"Regardless!" Draco chimed in, "Why on earth are you here?" He pointedly ignored what Potter said, and tactically ignored that he ignored it.
“It’s called thinking in parallel,” Draco said defensively. “You could try it, after maybe thinking at all sometimes.”
It might hurt Draco, though, and that was the problem. He wondered how he was with his father. Harry shuddered at the uncomfortable chill over his spine as he remembered seeing Lucius Malfoy standing proudly at the graveyard that night. He wouldn't know how he could even be in a room with such a person, let alone them being your father as well.
Draco sighed resignedly. Maybe he was cursed in a different way. "Harry if you're really there, I'm giving you six seconds to show yourself before I start hexing in every direction."
"I think so, sir." Harry said, clutching his bleeding arm that was now throbbing.
last time."
It did not, but was still just as suspicious.
Stopping outside of Ron's room upstairs, Harry took a deep breath before knocking twice. There was no answer, but after a moment he pushed the door open anyway.
Draco scratched on to his Charms essay, "Maybe you and Lolligo can bond over it sometime."
interesting things this morning…"
Harry got up first, brushing past Draco on the way through the doorway without a word. He caught Granger's eye on the way out, and nodded reassuringly. Surprisingly, she relaxed and let them go as Ronald finally noticed Harry's absence.
Not every night, but the good majority. He thought that Voldemort would be the one to haunt his dreams as he slept, but instead it was Cedric's lifeless body. On the nights he managed to sleep, he would see him, clear as day as he lay on the ground of the graveyard. It was always the same moment. The split second when Harry's eyes had flicked to Cedric's body before the pallid green light of the killing curse had even left. It crawled over Cedric's skin, reflecting in his eyes. Harry had felt his own skin tingle from the malevolence of the magic that he was horrified to feel felt
And now, all he could think about after his meeting with Dumbledore was retrieving that document from Witherby.
"But there's one more person trying to do the same." Remus said solemnly.
"Well that works out then." Draco said with a scoff. "I do mean it, though. Never again."
"Like chess." said Ron, gathering small, secret looks from Harry and Hermione.
"He had never realised that people actually died for all the Blood Purity bullshit. To him, it was just another requirement taught to him growing up." Harry sighed, looking down at his feet rather than at his friend's faces. "But he said he didn't want anyone dead for all of it. Not really. And I believed him, but don't ask me why. I told him that most of what he said all the time was bullshit from his father."
" He repeated in a horrified whisper.
to the Yule Ball. Knowing Potter, his Gryffindor idiocy probably made him take the stupidest, most brash option as a means to achieve something. At the moment, Draco had no idea what the boy was planning to do except possibly just try to gain control over the situation. Yes, that was it. Potter wanted control. He wanted to
"What?"
It seemed that he wasn’t the only one with the idea to send an early morning post, as when he arrived at the Owlery, sunlight now well streaming through the glassless windows littered around the tower, he spotted none other than Harry stroking his snowy Owl, whom was perched on his arm.
"Fine. I'm going - but not because you told me to!" Harry said, getting up and dusting off his trousers, "I left Ron and Seamus in a chess match and Seamus should have lost by now. Best be there for Ron to tell me about it."
Where was the man going now? Draco's mouth went dry and it was difficult to swallow. Was his father's mark burning too? He was busy stewing in assumptions and what-if's when the door behind him unlocked and swung open.
"I trust you have been briefed on recent events?" Dumbledore ventured, sounding too casual than to be talking about the rise of Voldemort.
"You can wear it to get back." Draco explained, holding his hands behind his back that Harry could tell he was nervously wringing.
"Hey! Where do yo-"
"Okay." Harry said, busy unwittingly enjoying the warmth of Draco's body encasing him. He realised they were swaying slightly in place together, and fought back a smile. The whole thing was so bizarre that he didn't really want to look in to it too much at all. "Never again."
were the one that put shit on my family. For years, you were a right git about us. For years, you called us blood-traitors, and called Hermione a mudblood! You hated us, and you hated Harry the most!"
pile."
Hermione hissed at them to be quiet and Harry just shot Ron a telling look as if to continue the rest of his sentence. Ron seemed to understand, changing the subject by using his quill to add a pair of circular glasses to the hangman drawing. Harry watched silently in amusement as Ron drew a scar on the drawing’s forehead, writing
Harry stretched and lay back with a yawn, "Go talk to your beloved
Harry whipped out his wand and pointed it angrily at the blonde, "Shut up, Malfoy" He hissed, and for some reason felt the need to add, "And it's not like that." He felt Hermione's hand on his arm behind him and she muttered to him in a low voice,  "Harry, don't bother."
Harry snorted, leaning forward and gestured to Draco’s wand for permission before taking it and cancelling the
Something flashed in Sirius's eyes at Harry's look, and he quickly checked his watch. "All pureblood families are intertwined if you look hard enough, Harry." He said distractedly, "Now off you go, you two. Before she wakes up again." He started down the stairs once again, throwing out as he left over his shoulder, "This house isn't going to clean itself!"
"Draco, the cloak is
?" Sirius had roared upon the news, "That man is a Death Eater, Harry, and I bet my life his son will be just like him! Now is not the time to be…
"Now, Hogwarts." Harry sighed contently, looking down for a moment pensively. "I'm so…relieved."
a son. He died a while ago."
Harry felt himself losing all sense in the fight against the anger inside him. He shut the open trunk in front of him with a bang, grabbing his wand off his nightstand.
"I don't know what that is." Draco said flatly, "But what I assume he meant is I sort of…play along on both sides."
“I was just sent to escort Harry.” Draco explained. “Grunt work. You know how it is, Professor.”
Harry didn't knew the name of what he suddenly let go of, but it was something that hounded him every moment of the day. It was a bone-deep, crushing weight kind of feeling. Harry felt it before he slept, and after the few moments of peace in the morning when all the thing he had to do came rushing over him, and suddenly he had a million things to do. Every morning, Harry would be awoken by Ron or Neville, or he would wake up on his own, and the amount of things he felt he had to do became suffocating.
The cool morning air greeted him as soon as he stepped outside, and he was pleased to note he wasn't too late to see the sun rise over the Lake like it did the day before. Hobbling over to his and Potter's spot subconsciously, he focused on one croissant in particular that was threatening to slip out of his grasp, and really couldn't have
"Oh." Draco said, stunned, "Well, my summer's been alright. I'm not sure how much I can say…" He glanced at Harry, and Harry gave him a questioning look.
He kept dreaming about Cedric.
. When
“For centuries, Slytherin has been a place for each of its members no matter what. For centuries…”
Hogwarts and this was
"Come again?" Draco gasped.
Potter sputtered once again that night, "I don't know what you…" but he couldn't seem to say more, looking at Draco confusedly. Draco threw a wink at him, a homage to the one Potter threw earlier, and heard the last few notes of the song.
"I don't even have the
“Was,” Harry mumbled. “Technically.”
“I’m thinking long term, Harry.” Draco insisted. “I know stopping my father is probably the first priority, but if I can’t do my job
Lancaster just frowned, as if he himself was also baffled by the information. “Strictly Unspeakable jurisdiction… No one knows what goes on down there, and if anything were to be sent to that level, every employee having been involved in its processing would be Obliviated - though it’s a rare occurrence at all.”
Tucked away safely, under heavy locking spells in the fear he might even possibly lose it. The Invisibility Cloak, entrusted by Harry himself to come and see him.
, Potter? Well that means you've got a date to the Ball. The champion must be drowning in requests to sweep them as their date." He prompted, making a sweeping motion with his arms. Harry readjusted his grip on his wand, his hands unexplainably sweaty. He knew he had asked Parvati not long before, but he still couldn't get used to the idea of actually taking her, and at this point was seriously considering feigning sickness on the night of the Ball, or worse, just taking Ron. Harry glanced at the boy next to him, his face red and looking at Malfoy like he was the very scum at the bottom of his cauldron. There was nothing wrong with taking Ron to the Ball, but Harry found the idea extremely off-putting every time he remembered Ron's dreadful dress robes, so he never voiced the option to the other boy. That was Padma's problem now, fortunately for him.
"Hermione, we went over this." Harry sighed deeply.
to study because of the Tournament. The poor idiot must be figuring out the next clue then.
I'm dreading writing the next chapter. Cedric was too hot to die. Spoiler: I still must kill him. Sorry!
Hermione sobbed in to his shoulder, her bushy hair sticking in to his face.
As he turned away, Vernon shouted at him from behind, "If this demented was so bad, then why didn't I feel anything?"
"I am worried, though." Draco said quietly after a moment.
Harry laid back down, folding his hands over his stomach. He sighed deeply, "I'm not sure."
Draco packed up the remaining food and vanished it as well. He sat awkwardly for a few moments, not knowing what to do with himself. Did he leave Potter there or wake him up? Or should he wait for class to start then wake him up then? It seemed odd to wait there while he slept. They had two hours until breakfast was over, and he wasn’t warm to the idea of being in the crowded Hall for some reason. The spot by the Lake really was spoiling him.
this is a bit long!! thank you so much if you're still reading! I just started writing again because of this and it feels amazing that people even bother. thank you!!
"I will, then." Remus said, then to Draco's surprise crouched down so he was looking up at the boy. "There's also something I wanted to ask of you too, if you don't mind."
"It's not your fault if he'd done some sort of Dark Magic ritual on you or something like that." Ron said, smiling back. "But Hermione stopped me before I could go get you when we figured it out. I was almost about to use the map before you gave it to Moody."
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, nausea making his head swim slightly. He shook his head again slightly, unable to speak for the moment.
Eruptedly, they stopped.
"I'm sorry, I seem to have forgotten you aren't aware of the idea of
"It's Harry." Hermione said with a pointed look to Ron. Harry's scoff was lost between his two friends having a silent argument as if he weren't there.
Draco looked up for a moment towards the Lake when Harry had left. He turned his head slightly, and for a fleeting moment managed to encompass the Forest, the Lake and the Castle in his vision all at once.
The child, damn it, beamed like Draco had just handed them the sun. “Thank you Mister Dra- Malfoy, sir!”
"The first?" She raised an eyebrow at him.
“Oh no,” said Umbridge, smiling so widely that she looked as though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly. “Oh no, no, no. This is your punishment for spreading evil, nasty, attention-seeking stories, Mr. Potter, and punishments certainly cannot be adjusted to suit the guilty one’s convenience. No, you will come here at five o’clock tomorrow, and the next day, and on Friday too, and you will do your detentions as planned. I think it’s rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do. It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you.”
The stag reared its head repeatedly until the Dementor recoiled, turning away as the wisps of light attacked it. The Dementor withered away, leaving only Harry's Patronus bathing the entire room in a white glow. He stood still, poised with his wand at the window and watching for any signs to see if the Dementor would reappear. His breath was coming in heavy, but thankfully the heavy weight in his chest had finally left.
“Ah,” Lancaster’s eyes lit up in recognition, looking slightly relieved, “Your father mentioned that, has he?” The man deflated slightly, which Draco accredited to the slight discomfort he may have felt at the resistance to the Veritaserum. “Well,” he leant forward on his seat, making Draco and Blaise do the same, “This is all off the record of course, but when I came into this position half a year ago, while having been briefed on the general contents of Level Two and One, I’ve never actually been down there.”
Draco was laying on his back in the one bed in the room, still in his day clothes and staring blankly at the ceiling. He'd been like that for a while, letting himself think over the events of the entire day and enjoying some well-needed peace and quiet.
"Nothing extreme." His father reassured him. "He is currently recuperating in one of our safe houses until he can regain his full strength." He stared at Draco intensely, "And in the mean time, you are aware of our allegiance to the Lord?"
Blaise shrugged simply, "The life of a Ministry man."
"I'm brooding, not sulking!"
"Please…just be patient." Harry said, getting up and brushing his jeans off. "He's trying. I need Ron to know that, too. There's no use in all of us fighting right now."
“Erm, right.” Harry said, his face growing hot. The air between them felt stilted, as if Cedric was something unspoken that neither wanted to acknowledge.
Harry was smiling at the bird, face lit up with so much good it almost took ahold of Draco too. "See? Knew you could do it."
"Her position has already been confirmed."
"- And I also realised Malfoy had been oddly…unprovocative towards any of us since December. In fact, he seemed to be ignoring not only the three of us, but I never saw him have a go at anyone else in the school either. He's completely stopped being…Malfoy."
"I was…" He cringed, the words stopping just before his teeth. "With Draco." He bit out, looking at his shoes. Hermione said nothing but exhaled a sharp intake of breath.
He turned his head to the side to the side, where the curtain surrounding him obscured his view of Draco in the next bed, whom had been sleeping when he came in.
"Right." Draco scoffed, "And I'm here because I enjoy these
Harry pulled back quickly. "What?" He exclaimed quietly, "Why?"
"But," Harry started, "You're in the wrong for saying some of those stuff as if he was still the same person. You can be mad about what he did, but please don't treat him like he can't change." Harry pleaded. "He really is trying, Ron."
"Oh, bollocks." Harry heard Mrs. Weasley swear from downstairs. "Sirius!"
Harry laughed despite himself, again interrupted by a long yawn.
"Morning, Draco." She returned the greeting, looking extremely relieved. "I assume you're here for…?"
"No? Why
Harry sighed deeply. "Constant vigilance." He muttered, closing his eyes.
Blaise thought for a moment. "Depends." He said, "Do you want to keep the scary Malfoy Heir act up, or do you want to keep going wherever it is you're going, and start changing how people see you."
“Oh, not too bad then, hm?” Ron spoke up hopefully, proving to Harry that he wasn’t actually asleep. “Did she let off on Friday?”
How could he have been bested by a muggleborn like Granger in grades every year, and how could Weasley been a better friend to Harry Potter than he could have ever been? It irritated Draco to no end, and he watched them as much as possible to gain any sense of an idea as to why such was the case.
For a few moments, Umbridge simply said nothing. She and Harry were at a standoff, staring intensely at each other. Draco thought she might do something brash like whip out her wand as the silence lingered, but instead, without moving her eyes off Harry, she said, “Mr. Malfoy.”
"Harry?" Sirius's voice called out from behind the curtain, "Who are you-" Sirius appeared, stopping when he saw Draco on the bed.
"I…" The man couldn't seem to get a grip on himself. He was looking at Draco as if he might get hexed at any moment, and Draco hadn't ruled it out yet. "I can't be sure."
"What? No. It’s common sense if you look at it properly."
But just as fate decided it wanted to fuck him over for the rest of his life, Potter himself appeared at the door, windblown and panting as if he had just run all the way from his dorms. Checking his watch, Draco saw there was only ten minutes of breakfast left.
.” Harry said again. If people found out about that part of his detentions then Umbridge would surely know he was bluffing the whole time. While it wasn’t likely that people would believe her if she started accusing Harry of being Voldemort himself, he still didn't want to possibly give up the position he had right now. Maybe he could help Draco more like this…
"And you won't tease Ron?"
"It's alright, Harry." Hermione said approvingly, but with a look that meant they'd talk more about it later. She dug through her bookbag for some parchment quickly, "Now how much have you started on you Transfigurations essay?" She asked. He and Ron blanched and looked at each other.
"Hermione!" Harry gasped at her.
"Culture!" Malfoy yelled back, "Heritage! Traditions! Knowing what you came from! Magic is sacred, Potter. How it's been passed down is incredibly important. Purebloods have had Magic in their families enhanced and filtered and passed down to each other with our History! Everything about it is important!"
"Yes, sir."
"I'm sure." Harry said, getting up and dusting his trousers off. "It's like collateral. I'll be back, okay?" Draco knew he wasn't talking about then right now, but the task.
"Didn't Harry tell you?"
" A voice hissed, the drone only being able to belong to Snape.
"It might suck, but at least it's the truth. Ignorance is bliss for a bleeding wound. It feels good but it's just going to kill you."
Doing his best not to look like he was running, Harry made his way to Ron and Hermione. He dreaded what they would say to him now that they were a combined force, but thankfully for once, they seemed to be arguing between themselves. Edging nearer, Harry saw it was more than just an argument. Ron and Hermione were flat out verbally sparring. Suddenly he seemed unsure about interrupting, not knowing if he would make the situation worse or not. Just as he was about to go talk find Neville or someone else, he caught Hermione's eyes and she beckoned him over violently.
"Merlin, she rattles the floor boards." George muttered.
"Merlin." Draco muttered, eyeing the…happy, couple. "What about the bloke before? The glassmaker? Owned a shop in Diagon Alley?"
"Alright, look. This evening has been…" Harry started.
"Professor, I can explain if you'll let me-"
Harry slapped a hand over his face. "Not another one." He groaned. "Is this really a priority?"
"I'm sorry." Harry added.
"If we're going to do this, there's one thing you can start doing right now to help."
“Seamus,
"What do you mean? We're at school."
," He looked up at the ceiling for a moment, wondering momentarily why his vision was blurry, "Trust me, join the vow. Be my Secret-Keeper, because I've said it once before, I'd rather die like this than die as a Death Eater." He felt warmth on his cheeks, realising there were tears rolling down his face.
The grass hedges were now well on their way to being as tall as Hagrid himself, and Draco knew they would only get taller before the task. He looked over the same areas and spots in the hedges as for the last hour. The hedges were made of a distinct ivy like plant that was characteristically fast-growing and strong. Draco had finally found something similar to how it looked in a Herbology textbook, and found out they were from the
"But-"
"Yeah? What did they do?" Ron said in the same tone.
“He’s not there.” He said to himself, but caught the attention of his two friends in front of him. Ron and Hermione scanned the staff table too, though there was no real need; Hagrid’s size made him instantly obvious in any lineup, yet he wasn’t there.
much. He didn't see Potter the whole day except that morning, and the boy wasn't at dinner either. His friends were, though, and Draco wondered if his assumption from before was correct.
Draco hated it all with a burning passion, but he never missed those details. They spoke volumes despite their insignificance, and sometimes he thought he knew the answer to his questions before it slipped away promptly. He brushed them off as much as he could, until Third Year, when Granger slapped him across the face while Potter and the Weasel laughed. He'd run away, separating from Crabbe and Goyle all the way back in to the Slytherin bathrooms.
“Right. Well, the point is that Dumbledore emphasised the concept of friendship and unity in the face of You-Know-Who’s enmity, and now the Sorting Hat’s going on about Inter-House Unity like the bloody House structure’s going off the rails.”
“But-”
“Seamus.” Dean sat up quickly, voice tense and warning.
"Not just loyalty, Draco." His father said, "Loyalty until death."
"Fine." Harry spat, pocketing his wand. "
"Just be careful. I'm not asking you to lose trust in Dumbledore, just to keep this Vow from him. I can't see anything good coming out of it except him utilising it however he can." Remus turned back around, his face, littered with scars, twisted in worry. "I hate that you all must go through what we did."
"Gillyweed in liquid form is used for potions, but in it's pure plant - or weed- form, it can have certain…effects on a person if they consumed the stuff."
Just as he slipped off into unconsciousness, the voice returned for a final vengeful quip.
"Don't throw the books! And both of you, stop messing around!" Hermione yelled, and all quickly turned back to their respective tasks dutifully.
happy new year! this may be my last chapter of 2020. what dumpster fire of a year.
"Draco." A voice said.
Harry thought for a moment, remembering first year, then his recurrent dreams, even his scar hurting time to time.
responsibility.
Harry’s description of her wasn’t far off, but he still never mentioned how utterly
"Can you teach me some?" He asked his father. The man turned back in slight surprise. He looked over Draco curiously, then drew his wand with a sly smile.
Harry and Ron nodded hesitantly, both secretly hoping Hermione would explain it better for them.
"Sulking won't get you anywhere-"
“Oh, yeah.” Draco said surely, “It’s not like my father has an actual job at the Ministry.
"Didn't know there was such a thing." Ron muttered, but Hermione elbowed him.
Draco would sometimes mouth at him, and the git would just smile wider like an idiot.
“Step-brothers?” Blaise cried, incredulous. Draco assumed that laughing wouldn’t have helped the situation, but the elevator music in the background didn’t help him one bit.
"I didn't take shit! I have absolutely
"What's wrong, Draco?" Harry asked, having come up to the top floor with him to explore some of the other rooms.
Then he realised the only possible thing that would make Harry so hesitant to tell
"Right. Well, there've been cases of wizards or witches stumbling upon the stuff while out by coastlines and such. As one does, they would ingest some - exclusively orally. After that, their bodies would…change. Some reported side effects such as suffocation, tightness of the chest, asphyxia, and dehydration." He waited for a moment for it to sink in to Harry, but he was just busy wondering how Malfoy could remember all that off the top of his head.
“Look, Harry.” Draco said softly, “I know it’s difficult because of everything that happened, but losing your head won’t do you any good in getting back at him for it eventually. You need to channel everything into something that will help, alright?”
"Oh god." Draco said beside him. "That means I'm her…"
"I am sorry, though." Draco said, looking at both Weasley and Granger, "For everything I've done…Especially to you, Granger. The things I've said and that one time I jinxed you last year…You did punch me though."
Draco leaned on the door behind him, crossing his legs at the ankles and hands behind his back. They were silent for a while, Draco at the door looking at Harry while Harry stood by the window looking back at him, seething. He could see Harry biting the inside of his cheek, and Draco pushed himself off the door with a sigh.
"What, the potion? Harry asked, surprised Ron was encouraging their potion they were bound to mess up yet.
"You both…" Remus said again, looking between the two, then glancing at Draco who was stood by the fireplace, an arm resting on the mantle and pinching the bridge of his nose. The boy wasn't happy when Harry had said he'd have to reveal the existence of the Vow to Remus as well.
"Draco, I think he's accepted!"
"Your things are already on the train." His Mum informed him, his father standing stiffly at her side.
"Thank you, Harry. You look very smart this evening, and I like what you did with your hair, too."
Draco thought for a moment, then said as pathetically as he could, "Well, I can't really do any more cleaning if this is to heal…"
Draco scoffed, memories of his eleven-year old self popping up in his head, crying in the bathrooms. “That wasn’t even worth a concern for me. My family’s always been Slytherin.”
“What kind of presence?” he asked shakily.
"I'm fine-" Draco started to reassure him, but was cut off by Harry's arms throwing themselves around his shoulders, stooping him over the bed. His arms immediately came up to encircle Harry back, involuntarily feeling himself melt in to the hug from relief.
-o-o-
"Ow! Blaise, really, I don't know why I even keep you around."
"But since I'm already an accomplice…" He started, smirking mischievously.
"Death Eater scum." Draco spat, voice hoarse as if he'd screamed it raw.
"And you believe all this?" Draco asked, numb with shock from all the information as it slowly sunk in. Snape halted and stared at him. Draco noticed him swallow quickly. "Professor? Is it all true?" Draco asked more urgently. It wasn't that he doubted anything Harry said, but it was all so much that he wanted to grasp on to the chance that it wasn't true.
"But that doesn't tell me what I need to trust you." Harry protested.
Later that day, Draco made his way to Snape's office, dreading every step.
"And if I want to share it?"
"Of course I understand!" Draco said sharply, "Who do you think I am?  You don't think I haven't thought about this, Harry? Because I have! In full, back through front and sideways! Ever since I was tortured under Cruciatus because I rejected that madman's ideologies, all I've thought about was doing this because it's the only way to go forward so I don't become just like
"But I'm not a bloody Slytherin!"
Malfoy, having sensed Harry's hesitation, laughed gleefully at him, "Oh.
something supplied in his brain, which he cut off immediately. He’d gone over this already, before the final task. Harry had survived then and he’ll keep surviving again and again after that. He was fine. Harry would be fine.
"So, Harry. It seemed more than just talking happened that night of the Ball." Hermione said menacingly. "Care to explain?"
Draco was elbowed roughly, sending his quill careening off the parchment in front of him and consequently leaving a long, dark line of ink streaking across it.
Harry turned back to the front, remembering that Draco never really liked Care of Magical Creatures as a subject at all (Third Year, a thrilling exhibition of the fact). Nonetheless, the boy continued to mutter snarky comments under his breath to his friends the entire lesson, only sometimes interrupting Professor Grubbly-Plank as she spoke about the Bowtruckles and how to feed them. Harry found it supremely annoying and surely the others did as well, but compared to how Draco used to be it was a vast step-up in behavior. Harry sometimes forgot that Draco was also just a complete dickhead.
Harry couldn't quite get anything through his head. All he kept seeing was Cedric's limp and lifeless body laying on the ground in his mind's eye.
He complied, his aching muscles uncoiling in relief. He blew out a long sigh, and massaged the knee that had been bothering him earlier. His father came to sit across him, wand still in hand.
give me a shout!
“I’ll be fine, Ron.” Harry said again tiredly, “Just two more days and I’m done.”
Once he was done, he gratefully retreated to his dorm, weary from the long day of travel and socialising. Behind him in the Common Room, he heard the momentary shriek of a First Year towards the side with the tall floor to ceiling windows, and he smiled.
"So don't claim you know anything about him!" Ron said, "He's
"I've fucked up!" He whined.
“I’m sorry.” Harry cried quietly.
"I wouldn't give a shit." Draco said honestly.
Draco's eyes widened, "Nothing, I swear! I just…" He trailed off again, his hands fumbling in front of him.
"Yeah, why?" Harry frowned, not knowing what was so funny. Draco just shook his head, laughing quietly to himself.
"S' nothing. Recurring injury." Draco waved him off, eyes pinched closed as the throbbing subsided slowly. "Must be all the cleaning. Kneeling on the floors and all that."
When Potter held his hand out for a truce, Draco found he was looking at him not with the same disdain he had for years, but as an equal for once. Something had panged in Draco's chest, but it wasn't painful, so he willingly agreed and hasn't looked back since.
When Harry finally got his chance to speak, he was pretty sure he'd never spoken so much without a breath in between in his life. He told Sirius everything since the Yule Ball, and by the time he was done, he was panting for breath.
Draco only sighed. “First of all,” he started, picking up a cherry tomato with his fork and popping it into his mouth, “it wasn’t the ‘dead of night’. It was, in fact, still half-nine, yeah? And secondly, that creature you’re referring to was
"Who's embracing air now." Harry muttered in to Draco's shoulder, and he felt a slight huff of laughter.
"Draco…" Harry said next to him, seemingly at a loss for words. A slow quietness settles between them for a moment. He heard Harry rustle in his place next to him.
"That's exactly the kind of thing that made me leave that meeting." Draco said, his eyes glinting with anger as they were still trained on Hermione. "You need to stop acting like you're some sort of…failure sieve, for him, Granger. He made his decision - without you, for once - and what's done is done. What good will come out of making him feel bad about doing anything without your confirmation first?"
"M'fine." He mumbled. "I'll be back."
"Come, come, all of you. Sit." Remus gestured to the chairs around them, and they all moved to sit, Sirius and Remus sat together at the head of the table while Ron and Hermione sat on one side and Harry and Draco on the other. "I'd ask about school but…" Remus trailed off, a solemn look on his face. "But other than that, how were your summers?"
The blank parchment sat waiting in front of him, so he humoured the woman with as much disrespect as possible and began to write.
"Right." Harry muttered thoughtfully. "Now that I think about it, apart from the Weasley's, there was no one else in that room who worked in the Ministry."
His smile fell, however, when his eyes saw the food in front of him. Draco watched him carefully, about to coax in to eating some of it before voices rang out from behind the curtains.
.” Harry snatched up the letter and stabbed a finger at it, “Be realistic, Draco. There’s no way we can do both. I’m here to help you, but we really can’t do anything like this when you’re throwing out every possibility you think of. What’s more important, stopping Voldemort from getting that weapon or getting Umbridge off your scent?”
“Right.” Ronald thrust his hand in the air, letting his chair rock forward so it was fully on the ground with a loud thump.
Harry crushed the note in his hand and stuffed it in his pockets again, making his decision. Malfoy hadn't given him a reason to doubt their ceasefire just yet, so Harry resolved to honour it and humour the boy tonight. He wouldn't tell Ron and Hermione just yet, but if things didn't go well tonight he'd put an end to things and never bother with it again. Why would Malfoy want to see him, anyway?
Harry's blood chilled. Draco had been tortured. With the Cruciatus, just like him.
"He takes and gives, but that's war." Remus paused to get up, going to stand by the fireplace with a hand on the mantle, looking at an old photograph of four black-haired people. Two adults and two sons. "I don't want you lot to get caught up in that, though, even if he is a good man with good intentions. You're just kids, even if you're in this war as much as the rest of us. Be conscious. Stay aware of what you're doing this for, understand?"
"I don't usually get offered food." Potter said, something in his voice sounding tight. He curled his arms around his knees tighter and rested his chin on them. Frustratingly, he still didn't touch the food. Draco had no idea why, or what weird complex the boy had but it prevented him from eating food when, what…someone gave it to him? Regardless of what it was, something hot coiled in his stomach at the thought. Food was something people should always make time for if they could, regardless of whether they were hungry or not. It was one of the things magic couldn't replace so it was incredibly important. It was fuel, and disrespectful to the body by depriving it.
"But what if it was a mistake?" Hermione stated lowly.
By the afternoon, they'd gotten through half the room altogether and Draco had taken to disappearing behind high mounds of miscellaneous objects and taking naps when no one was looking, so they decided to take a lunch break.
"Draco!" Hermione gasped.
He cursed and scrambled off the bed, holding the wand away from his body like it was incriminating evidence in a murder investigation. "Shit, shit, shit."
"Leave it." Harry said, his nose crinkling at the smell of old and grime invading his senses and leaving his stomach unsettled for some reason. "This place needs some air."
“What does that even mean?”
Dumbledore’s eyes glittered again, with something Draco always found slightly creepy. “It’s important to recognise the lack of power in those
, Ron."
"Moody is scouting the maze-"
Harry's eyes shot up to his in surprise, and Draco raised an eyebrow. Without a word, he picked up his bag and left the class in front of Harry and Weasley without looking back.
Her eyes laid on the badge in Ron's hand. “Ron?” said Hermione, her jaw dropping. “But . . . are you sure? I mean —”
“What? No-”
"Well, she doesn't seem very qualified to teach, does she? Who knows how this will affect our O.W.L.S?"
"That was just him being an idiot." Harry smiled slightly. "But on that first night on Yule, he said it himself with the most honesty I've ever seen on a person: I want no one dead for it. He looked sick, Hermione, at the thought of his father almost being responsible for those petrifications in Second Year. Sick at the thought of those possible deaths, and it occurred to me that maybe he wasn't as evil as I thought he was. He looked like a kid, not some sort of big scary dark lord."
"They won't." Harry confirmed calmly with a nod. "I don't think they'll even care."
"Oh shit…Are you- I don't know-" Harry heard Malfoy next to him, and he'd almost forgotten the boy was there. Shame immediately ripped through Harry, and he quickly choked down his sobs and looked up at Malfoy. He tried to smile as convincingly as he could, tears still rolling down his cheeks but trying to come across genuinely as if they weren't there.
" Draco shouted, "You're one them aren't you? You have the Mark?"
"They'll just have to get used to it." Harry said, turning away from the boy and starting to the school.
"And what? We believe what Looney Potter thinks all of a sudden? What in Salazar's name is wrong with you?" Blaise protested. Draco's eyes shot up to Blaise finally, settling on the boy's widened eyes.
He glanced at his mother, the fire sending shadows across her face, but also a warm yellow light that made her look younger.
“Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?” Hermione tried again. The entire class seemed spellbound by her insistence, and she certainly wasn’t alone in her words while speaking out.
"A Malfoy has no time for a heart." His father would say to him in contrast. He'd once found Draco crying about something he couldn't recall anymore, and his father had crouched next to him, taking him the by the shoulders and continuing icily, "In time, the absence of it will be replaced with iron-will." He leant in, cold blue eyes like a splash of cold water over Draco's body, "Now
"Brilliant. Now what did they tell you at that meeting that had you screaming at our Headmaster?"
"So how was it dancing with him?" She said.
He let her in as quietly as he could, the sun just barely peeking out in the horizon and not wanting either his aunt or uncle to wake up (although the latter was unlikely. Vernon slept like a bloody rock and so did Dudley).
"And this included all the blood bigotry?"
"No! He's alive too, you know! I won't have you discussing him like he's just a helpless baby! It may have worked when you first got your grubby hands on him, Dumbledore, but look where that ended him up!"
Dudley immediately perked up at this, and Aunt Petunia shot up and out of the room to retrieve some chocolate. Uncle Vernon stood, his reddened face clashing horribly with his blue striped pajamas.
Harry angrily stabbed his hand in the air, but not before Umbridge was already answering the question of another student. Upon closer inspection, Draco realised it was one of the two girls who would have taken Harry to the Yule Ball.
“At this moment, I’m unsure.”
Ron crossed his arms over his chest, still laying down facing Harry. "But?" He asked inquiringly.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright then. See you around." He replied, trying to keep the anxious thoughts at bay and just enjoy the cool ground beneath him and the seeping warmth in his blood from the sun. Malfoy's footsteps resumed and faded away.
dramatic. At least now you don't look like a bloody banshee. Thank me later, Potty." Malfoy vanished the mirror and started to the entrance looking sickeningly pleased with himself, the warm glow of the candles inside looking extraterrestrial bouncing off his platinum blonde hair. Harry followed him, touching his head and whimpering quietly with the grief of his own lost locks.
“Two days…” she muttered horrifiedly, staring at his hand as if it were diseased.  “It should have been alright...It should have been covered up…”
"That'd be the day." Ron sighed exasperatedly. "Harry, was she really that bad at the hearing?"
“Say - and this is all hypothetical, of course - that it was something from the Ministry. How would I do that, then?”
"I stayed inside Prince Manor, going over the entire Potions syllabus as well as some Transfigurations revision for my O.W.L.S. I never left the Manor, and there were no guests."
?" Draco snapped at Harry's twitching grin. The boy only smiled wider when he asked.
“Don’t mind me. Just go freshen up, and I’ll meet you at the Hall.”
"I know." He said quietly, but Ron and Hermione heard him anyway. "I'll stay inside."
"You used Polyjuice to spy on Draco in Second Year." Hermione reminded regretfully.
of us." He said pointedly, glaring at her. He put the note in his robe pocket, not trusting Blaise to not try to read it.
"Oh come off it, Pans." Blaise said, "They really like each other. Right, Theo? Can't put a label on
“And I was
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now, I think we’ve sorted this out, hm?” McGonagall said plainly. She stood up and rounded her desk, going to hold the door open. Both Harry and Draco got up to leave, but a hand on Draco’s shoulder stopped him from passing the threshold.
“You wear pink all the time.” Blaise reminded, and Pansy immediately elbowed him.
"Fucking Potter." Blaise said with a sigh. Pansy and Draco nodded, agreeing eagerly.
“It’s no problem,” Ron replied, looking sadly at the hand. He got up, went back to his broom and packed up the first-aid kit back into the additional bag. “Can you walk back to the tower now?” he asked, back still turned. “Don’t want Filch finding us here.”
He showered quickly, urged by the thought of Malfoy's wand underneath his pillow. Anxiety fled through his veins at the thought that someone might life up his pillow by some odd chance of fate and see the wand. How on earth would he explain that?
"What's better?" Draco asked, weighing his options in his head.
"How did he even get off?"
“Whatever it is,” Draco continued, “my father’s not getting it - for now, that is.” He peered down thoughtfully at the parchment again, “It seems this bloke Blane Witherby may be willing to help.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and blood rushed in his ears. "Oh, Malfoy now, is it?"
He was cut off by guttural screams, as if someone was being tortured. They continued for a long time, as if the pain causing them were prolonged. Draco couldn't tell if they were Harry's screams or not. He'd never heard Harry scream like that before. He'd never heard anyone scream like that before.
"Me? Hell did I do?"
"Like how we're friends."
"What?" Harry erupted, "That's not fair!"
Draco had cast. "No, sir. I…" He trailed off as it dawned on him. "It's just the first thing I thought of."
"Maybe they know my father. " Draco said, face paling. "Or they work closely with him, or they're directly involved."
"Harry." Sirius whispered. "The clauses."
Ron nodded and left, glancing at Harry over his shoulder once before he passed through the door. The dorm was empty except for Neville whom was desperately searching through his trunk for something. Not wanting to be pulled in to helping him find whatever it was the boy had lost, Harry quickly picked up his spare uniform and robes and went in to the showers.
"Professor Lupin!" Harry broke in to a run, and the others around him parted. Sirius and Lupin were sat side-by-side, but they might as well have been sitting on one chair by how closely Sirius stuck himself to the other man.
He cleared his throat nervously and replied, "Er, yeah. My mom's sister."
Something flickered across Draco's face, a fleeting moment of fear and a quick glance at Harry himself. He resolutely looked at Remus and Sirius, a look of remembrance on his face. "I heard my father say once, that they'll 'get rid of Potter this time'. Do you think they're planning an attack? Possibly on the school?"
“Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourselves?” Umbridge snapped.
“First Year, remember?” Harry rambled hurriedly, “As soon as I touched her, my scar stung, I swear, Ron.”
Harry’s eyes fluttered as the stabbing in his head caused all other senses to fade, leaving it the only thing his brain could comprehend. It almost felt like the Cruciatus, except that the majority of the pain was focused on his scar. He genuinely thought his head might split open all over the floor of Umbirdge’s classroom.
"Guess so." He said.
“Oi, that’s my best friend you’re talking about.” Ron interrupted him righteously. Harry paused for a moment, before finally understanding what the other boy had said. “I won’t stand for it, Harry.” Ron continued, elbowing him a little so even Harry managed to smile slightly. “See? You think he’s great too.”
"Morning." Harry threw back over his shoulder as he flipped an egg. Sirius ruffled his hair as he passed by, grabbing a cup and spelling in some hot water from a flask on the dining table.
"And where will you go?" Vernon shouted.
"Indeed." His father smiled at him, and it was one of the most genuine smiles he'd ever seen from the man. Too bad it was for Voldemort than anything else. "Unfortunately, he was weakened after his duel with that idiot boy."
With a ding, the elevator doors opened and Draco slid open the gate. They stepped immediately into a jarringly small office room, with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves on the walls and almost no spare space to contend with. Every seeming empty area possible was occupied by a pile of books or a sack of...objects or even the odd bit of furniture. Draco held his breath on instinct, eyeing the shocking layer of dust he could see on everything.
