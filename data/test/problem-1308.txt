Trudging along, Draco was grateful to his mother who suggested that he bring along his snow boots this term - she had got quite into the art of weather-predicting after the war for whatever reason and claimed it to be a very harsh winter indeed - and she hadn’t yet misled him. Draco stalked out of the entrance hall and descended the cobblestone steps with haste that could be considered slightly dangerous considering the amount of iciness.
Draco had been taught his whole life to not make any unnecessary sound. Footsteps, breathing and any type of movement were all supposed to be silent. No one was to be aware of his presence at the manor unless he was called upon, lest he somehow mess things up for his father and, by extension, the Malfoy name. That was just one of the small things he had been taught as a child that, once he arrived at Hogwarts and saw how everyone else was, kept coming back to him. How many things had he grown up with that were expected from him that weren’t the norm? Was his childhood really as bad as it seemed to be, compared to those of his classmates?
like that before. Like just seeing Draco was tearing Harry apart, and like he never wanted to stop looking.
"Why would I?” Draco asked, eyes closed. “That's what's supposed to happen. I just didn't think it would be like this.”
Sighing, Harry kicked at the ground, keeping his eyes down. “He forgets,” he said softly. “Small things, tiny details. It's hard to tell, because he hides it so damn well, but sometimes,” harry ran a hand over his face, tired. “Sometimes I'll be talking and I see something pass behind his eyes.”
Again they could have used the Floo or Apparated, but they decided to walk instead. As they walked past a row of houses, Harry heard Draco sigh. “What?”
After a time, Draco opened his eyes to see Harry staring at him strangely, as though just looking long and hard would do something. One of his hands was in Draco’s hair, the thumb rubbing up and down gently, while the other rested on his stomach, radiating heat. Draco's headache was gone.“What?”
,” he said. “It's just stupid. You don't need to.” He huffed again, looking away, and missing the surprised smile on Harry's face.
"Oh.” Draco felt like the time span was very significant, like there was an event taking place, like something would have changed by the time Harry got back, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He did know that he didn't want Harry to go. That if Harry walked out of their bedroom, out of the apartment, and out of the London today, something very bad would happen.
He was about to ask again, although he didn't have a clue what the hell he was asking, when Harry spoke.
During the twentieth week of his treatment, Draco awoke to soft fingers trailing up his arm. His mind felt cloudy, and as he opened his eyes, he struggled to get a grip on his thoughts, feeling them pull away from him, escaping like a fluid dream.
flat, was so far removed from anything Harry associated with Draco that it felt surreal. Harry hadn't wanted to rush, but today, they had eaten lunch, been halfway through washing up, when Harry had looked up and caught Draco's eyes looking right back at him.
Harry asked the question like it was nothing, like it was the most casual thing in the world, but when Draco opened his eyes, he could see the nervousness in Harry's features. “Sex?” Draco echoed, although it would be false to say he hadn't had suspicions when Harry brought the subject up.
). When he got no reply he went on. “The Wizengamot's agreement, you can't accept it. You won't. Right?”
Shutting the fridge, Harry eyed the now empty paper bag that had been used to carry the groceries back. “I think I'm done here,” he called, raising his voice slightly. There was an answering grunt from the bedroom. Crushing the bag into a ball and tossing it in the bin, Harry followed the sound and found Draco sitting on the floor, folding some sheets. “Need help?”
Taking a deep breath, Harry bumped his hand gently against the one Draco had laid on the table, before walking around and sliding into the chair next to him.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, slipping one hand under the table to clasp at Draco's. "Okay. So how does this work?" Though Draco's hand tensed for a moment, he didn't pull away.
"Who would I be waiting for?” Draco asked, irritation growing out of his confusion. He rubbed a hand against his right temple.
By the time they got home, Harry started talking again, chattering about nothing in particular. He talked so much that Draco didn't manage a word, which was the idea, because everytime Draco opened his mouth, Harry feared what he might say.
Harry said nothing, just rubbed his nose against Draco's skin and tried to memorise the scent. He knew he was returning to his home. To his friends, to his life, to his dream, and that he should be happy.
There was something wrong with what Pansy was saying, something about what she was saying, that he should pay attention to, Draco thought as Pansy said her goodbye and left.
"And that's just another testament to your stupidity,” Malfoy said, although there was a hint of unease in his tone, probably caused by the close proximity of Harry, and the intensity of his gaze.
Late that night, as the owls hooted and crickets chirruped outside their window, Harry and Draco had sex. It took a while to get started, they kept getting stalled at awkward points; the mood that was usually so desperate seemed stilted, with the usual passion absent. But slowly, carefully, they fell into a rhythm they both enjoyed, and then it was suddenly over far too soon.
"Things keep getting messy,” Draco muttered at length. “In my head. It's like I've got two images and they keep flickering in and out. I keep losing the details, and it's getting harder and harder to know which one's right, and which one's made up.”
“I hope you’re not making a mistake, Harry.” Hermione grabbed his hand and squeezed it tight. “I won’t be present as I’d like to anymore, what with me going back to Hogwarts.”
Draco leaned on the counter, squeezing his eyes shut. Why did he feel like this? He hadn't had a headache since-
Draco blinked. "I don't know,” he said truthfully. He hated crying. He would never cry in front of Harry. And yet he couldn't stop the tears- couldn't even identify why he felt like his heart was being ripped in two.
Harry knew they only meant the best for him, but he couldn’t help but glare. Sometimes Hermione made him feel like a child. “I’m not stupid, okay? You make me sound like one.”
mean it,” Draco snapped, reaching up as though to clasp a bar, but stopping in time. “It's the truth, we both know it.”
“Draco’s at home. Pansy's giving him this week's treatment,” Harry said without enthusiasm. He wasn't sure when Draco’s flat became a home, but he was all too aware of its lacking permanence and so used the term as much as possible, while he still could.
The smile that briefly crossed Draco's features disappeared a few minutes later, as they reached their destination, stopping in front of the iron gates. Draco was the one that stepped forward, pushing it open and walking inside. His eyes were red. Harry followed silently.
When they left the flat, Draco locked the door, making Harry smile a little at the normality. How long had he wanted to see Draco outside the confines of his cell? Now, he could. Even if there would be consequences, for now it was hard not to feel happy.
Harry frowned, scrunching up his whole face. “I know you've been through some crap, Draco, and I can't say what I would have done in your position,” Harry said slowly, his worry cooling as he started to become angry with Draco. “But you have to take responsibility for your own actions.”
"Because,” Draco leaned in conspiratorially, his hair scratching against Harry's cheek, and the alcohol on his breath sharp and tangible, “pretty soon I won't remember what it tasted like anyway.” Draco sat back, his laughter acting as a poor veil for his desperation. Utterly unable to tear his gaze away, Harry watched as the torn, harsh laughs subsided and Draco took another deep drink, staring moodily at the bottle.
She closed the door, watching as he jumped lightly down from the banister and beckoned her, walking briskly to the end of the hallway and taking the stairs down. Obediently, she followed, waiting until they got out of the complex before talking.
After fifteen minutes of silence, Potter said a short goodbye and left. Draco didn't reply, but once Potter had left, Draco turned around and spent a long moment with his eyes on the closed door.
The heavy door on the other side of the bars of Draco's cell swung open with a screech, causing him to glance up from the bed he was sitting on.
On the table, the drink was waiting. He was supposed to have it, Draco knew. That was part of his treatment. (
Swallowing hard, Harry tried to reason with himself, in a way that would take away the hurt he had anticipated, but it didn't help. “I-”
They were walking back to the flat, Harry still grinning because Draco hadn’t noticed the hickey he’d left, and chattering about how he kicked Draco’s ass, when he spotted Neville, walking down the road in their direction, hands in his pockets.
"Draco. What did you tell them?” Harry whispered. The way his breath was catching in his throat now had nothing to do with the run to get here.
"I don't want to eat yet,” Draco said, putting away the sheets and standing up. “There's somewhere I need to go.”
"Yes, that makes sense.” She scribbled something on her paper. In front of her was a large grey box, stamped onto which Draco recognised the Ministry symbol. He tilted his head, something niggling at the back of his mind. “I'll make up your drink.”
"But there's no way to do that- at least no way the Wizengamot would accept.” Harry's fingers hurt from the constant clenching and unclenching. “So he's stuck in there.”
"He denies it,” Harry finished for her, fists clenched, his knuckles white. “Typical Draco.” He let out a sigh. “He has headaches, sometimes it's nothing more than an irritation, and sometimes he can't even stand. And I heard him throwing up the other night, but he brushed it off.”
With that thought, Harry tensed, his eyes squeezing shut as he gave one last shuddering thrust and gasped at the intensity of his release. His body went boneless, his vision grey and spotty as he came down, each of Draco's upward grinds creating pleasurable aftershocks until he too finished, shivering and panting against Harry's ear.
Grinning more than ever, Harry resumed walking, with Draco at his side. Draco had actually shrugged when Neville directed a question at him, which was definitely a move forward.
"Really?” Harry tried to suppress the bubble of hope rising in him, like it had all the other times. The Auror department had offered the heroes of the War a free pass to try out the Auror program immediately, and Neville had accepted it right away. Harry wasn’t too keen to set himself out there just yet, nor did Ron, judging by the way he lounged comfortably around the shop with his brother. But sometimes it helped that someone he knew was at the Ministry and keeping him updated of things. “What happened?”
"I'm selling it,” Draco said abruptly, as they turned the corner back towards the flat. “The Ministry offered to buy it. I could use the money, and soon enough it's not going to mean anything to me.”
"Draco,” Harry found himself gasping. “Draco...” He had no idea why he was saying it, only that it was the only thing that his lust-ridden mind could comprehend right now; the body moving insistently against his, and the person that Harry was...that he’s in...
"Yes,” Pansy said firmly, closing the box and lifting it, leaving the drink on the table. “I have an appointment at the hospital.
Harry kissed the edge of Draco's eye, his lips slipping a little on the moisture there, tongue lapping it up. “I hate this.” His voice seemed to rumble right through Draco. “I hate this so much.”
“Monitor him, you mean? Like being his Arresting officer.” Harry couldn’t keep the disgust on his face. “Draco wouldn’t want that."
"Of course I am,” Pansy said, a little too heatedly. “But it's okay. I know you've been busy.” She hesitated a moment. “With Draco.”
"I didn't talk while I was eating,” Harry said, playing along with their familiar banter while reaching towards the worn tin pot resting by the little fire and looking inside hopefully.
Hearing those words made Harry want to shout. Made him want to ask what exactly Draco had thought it would be like. Wanted to punish Draco for doing this to both of them. Most of all he wanted Draco, the one that was strong and fierce and burned so much brighter than the tired, resigned being in front of him.
Draco’s lip curled, a thread of control snapping at the claim. “And what exactly is that? A prejudiced pureblood prat that acted as if he owned Hogwarts since he was young? A guy who’s smart but did nothing but stupid decisions in life? Someone who cursed and tortured people and took the Dark Mark? A coward who escaped with his parents? An ungrateful child for giving them up at the last minute?”
Draco looked momentarily surprised, then nodded. “I hope they burn it,” he whispered, so quietly that Harry nearly missed it.
"Hey,” Harry returned. Draco waited for him to say something else, but he didn't. Just continued the slow movement of his fingers, drawing an invisible line down Draco's collarbone, brushing a thumb over his sternum.
"That hurt, idiot,” Draco said into Harry's hair, arms wrapped around him as he rubbed the small of his back before pushing his top up and moving against skin.
“He needs someone to ‘look after him’ for the first few months. If you know what I mean.” Shacklebolt’s eyes were grave. “I guess you’re up to the job?”
"I put him on a high dosage already,” Pansy said, biting her lip. “I know he lies about how much pain he's in, so I went straight ahead. The thing is, the headaches are just going to get worse and worse until he completes.”
Harry stood slowly, not saying anything for a few moments and staring at the back of Malfoy's shirt. “You don't have to push me away all the time, Malfoy,” he said after a little while before placing his hand on Malfoy,
"It's just a headache,” Draco said, when Harry found him sitting on the edge of the sofa, head cradled between his hands. But Harry knew Draco, and knew that for him to have admitted there was a problem meant he was in a lot of pain. Harry knew this, not because he was the one who healed Draco's wounds, sat by his bedside and traced the scars with the tip of one finger, but because he did the exact same thing.
"It doesn't help,” Draco said after a few seconds. Harry's touch was surprisingly light and relaxing, in comparison to his usual all consuming, fiery touches. Occasionally he paused to brush the fingers of one hand through Draco's hair in gentle, firm strokes.
"I do,” Draco said. “I know you. I know what you're going to say, so just don't. It's too late. I made my choice. The Ministry wouldn't let me back out now anyway.” The last part was just added on, just a little wistful strand of nothing, but it caused tiny whirlpools to twist inside of Harry, as emotions and thoughts from the far reaches of his mind and spirit came to play.
Their kisses became a little sloppy, Harry pushed Draco's shirt up to lick and tease at his nipples, pausing and shuddering when the feeling between their hips became too overwhelming. Draco kept pushing and pushing, and at some point Harry found himself panting into his shoulder, too out of it, completely focused on the pleasurable throbbing that was engulfing him, to notice anything that wasn't the frenzied slide of Draco's arousal against his.
“I’d have to let Ron and Hermione know where I was going in the morning but I’d happily go with you to your father’s trial, it’s no problem. We should probably sleep now, how early do we have to be up?”
“Oh, I didn't think you were here to do anything to me, you just caught me by surprise. If I said something, no I didn’t. Anyway, what did you have to do in the astronomy tower... at half two... in the morning?”
"Then what do I taste like?” Draco asked, between gasps. “Hey, what are you trying to do? Draw blood?”
"Draco,” Harry started, tipping his head slightly and stilling the movement of his hand momentarily. “Have you ever had sex?”
Harry's fingertips were rough and yet gentle as they brushed over Draco's throat, making him swallow reflexively. When the touches reached his eyes, he closed them obligingly, letting Harry feel the soft skin of his eyelids and the skittish movement of his eyes underneath as he tried to keep them still. “Draco,” he heard Harry sigh just before he opened his eyes, feeling Harry stroke down the side of his face. Draco had heard Harry say his name before, shouts and screams and desperate cries and even softly, late at night when Harry thought he was asleep, but never
"It's not like I have anywhere else to go,” Malfoy said, turning his head away. Harry stared for a second before swallowing and turning away so his back was pressed against the wall next to Malfoy.
"Alright,” Harry said amiably, not willing to cause a fight. “Do you want to cook, or should I? Pansy made me buy loads of vegetables, even though they'll just go rotten, so we might as well use them up before they do.”
The call jolted Harry out of the reverie he was in, as he walked back towards his flat. It was just after sunset, and he had decided he favored walking rather than Apparating back to his place. His morning consisted of helping Ron and George out in the shop, then they all went to the Burrow at lunch. Without Fred around anymore (his seat at the dining table was always left unoccupied) and with Ginny back at Hogwarts, the place seemed a little quieter than usual. He spent the rest of his afternoon watching out over Teddy with Andromeda.
One sunny afternoon, as Pansy was leaving the apartment that Harry and Draco shared, she was surprised to see Harry sitting on the banister that ran around the apartment block, one leg pulled up and the other hanging down. What surprised her was that when he saw her, he raised a finger to his lips, prompting her to stay quiet.
On the other hand, Pansy was clearly agitated. Tapping her foot beneath the table, eyes wide as she recognized Harry. On the table in front of her, was a large grey box with clasps on the side, and the Ministry’s emblem stamped on the front.
Potter sighed, leaning against the wall and letting his smile droop a little. “I know it's hard, Malfoy. But it's not going to be like this forever.” He got no reply, just Draco turning his head back to the window, effectively ignoring him.
In answer, Draco wound his hands into Harry's hair, guiding his head so that they could continue kissing, even while walking. They managed two steps, before Draco tripped and nearly fell, catching himself on the door frame just in time. Harry, able to brace himself against Draco, remained upright and laughing. Draco scowled and snaked a hand between them and giving him a few hard pumps that effectively knocked all traces of amusement off Harry's face and made his final chuckle turn into a yelp.
For the first time in months, Malfoy was back in London. And he was still out of Harry's reach, even after all this time.
), and hearing him talk in this way made Harry's blood boil. After everything they had been through together, Draco was willing to throw it all away for a chance to run away from his mistakes, chosen they may be or not.
And then, just as he was mapping the freckles on Draco’s face, he remembered what he kept on trying to say a while ago.
"The Wizengamot refuses to release him until he proves himself, as I've told you before.” Shacklebolt tried and failed to be stern, and landed on consolatory.
"I see,” Pansy said evenly as they walked down the main street. “Have you noticed anything else? The treatment's in its fifteenth week,” she hesitated, glancing at Harry's face before continuing. “He should be completing soon, but I haven't noticed anything, and when I ask...”
"How can I not?” Draco answered back, his voice harsh. “Do you think it's nice to look back on my life and see everything I've done?” He laughed cruelly. “You have no idea.”
"How can you not have a favourite memory?” Harry asked, scrunching up his nose, eyeing the curve of Malfoy's neck as it was bared to him. “Not even from when you were younger?”
"Will they? I don't think so. And if they do, how long am I supposed to wait? Years? Decades? Do you think when I'm an old man, they'll deem me safe and let me live out the last few years of my life in freedom?”
"Only temporary,” Draco said softly, his voice scratchy from lack of use. Potter looked up at the sound, watching warily as Draco turned his head a little to meet his gaze. “That's what you said when we got here, and the Aurors and your Minister threw me in here. That's what you said when they made me drink that potion to deplete my magical core and rob me of my magic.That's what you said when the Wizengamot decided I would be imprisoned indefinitely.” Draco paused, his eyes narrowing. “It's funny, none of these things seem temporary at all.”
"I lied,” Draco said in a low voice. He didn't look at Harry, just carried on staring at the ceiling. “When you asked me what my favourite memory was, and I said I didn't have one. I lied.” He glanced at Harry, lying peacefully on his side, no worry in his expression, and couldn't resist reaching out a hand to run down his arm, feeling the soft hairs and warm, solid muscle. “When you saved me from Fiendfyre. When you willingly risked your life to save mine. I don’t think you realize the gravity of what you’ve done for me.” Draco faltered for a second, wetting his lips and continuing. “For one moment, I felt like my life was more important to you than anything else. I was going to die, and it was okay.” Draco let out a low, shuddering breath. “That's my favourite memory. Even when I tried to forget it, I couldn't.” He paused. “But I'd give it up, if I could keep you.” He turned slightly, slinking closer to Harry, trying to forget himself in the warmth, the soft rise and fall of his chest. “So I'm giving it to you,” Draco whispered, “ as sentimental and stupid as that is. Keep it safe.”
After successfully conquering the steps, Draco decided to make his way over to the Black Lake as Harry loved spending time over there. Just as he rounded the corner, Draco was met with snowballs being bombarded at him from every which way. He turned around and was comforted by the faces of his friends, cheeks red from the cold, absolutely beside themselves and couldn’t help but laugh with them.
A dramatic gasp escaped Draco’s lips, “Harry James Potter, do you have EYES for other MEN, I apologise but I simply cannot continue any longer! Not now that I know of your insincerity and borderline adultery with one’s oldest friend!”
When Harry awoke, he stretched and then retracted his legs, entwining them more; shifting slightly, Harry repositioned himself and settled in a more comfortable place before lifting his head and placing another feather-light kiss atop Draco’s soft, fair hair. “You okay?” Harry asked, his voice scratchy after having slept
“Erm, yeah, that’d- that’d be good thanks.” Draco spoke as Harry took his hand and pulled him to his feet, not letting go as he started to pull them towards the stone steps, instead squeezing Draco’s hand and settling once more into the comfortable silence.
Draco’s mind then wandered to the Golden Boy himself and thought that if Potter was in Draco’s position, he’s sure that whatever family he lived with would do all that they could to stop him. They’d remind him how much they loved him and get him help and say how much he was worth and that he can always come to them if he needed anything, that they were always there for him no matter what. If only Draco had had the same love and kindness towards him as Harry no doubt had.
Harry didn’t need Draco to finish his sentence in order to know what the pointy blonde was about to say. He wasn’t the most observant person in the world, not by a long shot but it didn’t take a genius to pick up on what was going through Malfoy’s mind, all he had to do was read the situation; Draco was up at the astronomy tower in the middle of the night, he was expecting to be alone and it needed to be done tonight, the night before Lucius Malfoy’s trial.
“Slytherin.” Draco said instantaneously, “it’s a longer walk and I still need a bit of time to clear my head before going to sleep.”
It was common knowledge that Harry positively loved the snow, why that is, no-one knows but anyway, he simply couldn’t get enough of it. Almost as if it put him in a trance-like state whenever he saw it, he truly was a little boy at heart and Draco couldn’t help but dote on him for it. Without thinking, Draco got dressed and headed downstairs, eager to find his boyfriend and, for lack of a better word, frolic with him in the pure white snow.
“Hey you,” He said, nudging Harry in the stomach with his finger, “You tried to talk them out of doing that right?”
A declaration of war was made between the surprisingly tight-knit group of friends, losers would buy drinks tonight  - the stakes were high. The first snowball was impressively however unsurprisingly thrown by one Blaise Zabini, hitting Ron square in the face. Ron however used the anger to really pack a punch with his first snowball however, he had snow in his eye and horrifically misjudged his aim. The snowball broke against a tree one couldn't help but feel sorry for roughly two metres to the left and behind the group of Slytherins, at least he’d made an effort though.
“I’m not, don’t worry, I was just getting a tissue although we do need to move at some point, it’s..” he cast a tempus charm and read the numbers aloud, “Oh wow, it’s half three and we need to sleep.”
“Oh great, sorry for not having anything though.” he said, despite being delightfully happy at the thought of wearing Draco’s clothing once more.
“Yeah, sorry about that but thank you for coming, really I don’t know if I’d still be here if you hadn’t.”
Their legs slotted together under the covers as Draco continued to get hugged by Harry and was pulled closer. Harry’s hand was now tangled in his hair and Harry placed a kiss on top of Draco’s head, so light he almost didn’t feel it, leaning into the warmth of the other boys arms, he felt the tears that had been threatening to fall from his eyes subside and started to drift off to sleep.
Once back home and in their toasty warm room with the fireplace lit, Harry and Draco moved to the bed to snuggle under the covers and enjoy each other’s company, wholly grateful to, despite everything they had gone through together, be able to have apologised and set it aside. The pair got comfortable in each other’s arms and looked out the window to see light snowflakes falling down before looking at the person they were blessed to be with and smiled at them, remembering the events of the day and looking forward to the next and all that followed that they were able to spend with each other.
“I’m glad, I’ll stay with you for as long as you want me to, whatever you need, just say it and I’ll do it.”
He left the bed in one swift move and made a beeline for the window; why did it have to be so far away, a bed six feet from a window should be illegal, especially on mornings such as these with biting cold air that positively attacks Those Who Dare Rise.
Tonight he ignored what his parents had trained him to do, he heard his footsteps echo around him and fall into his head each step he took. He heard the rustling of his clothes as he moved his arms to propel him further, and the ragged breaths of exhaustion leaving his lips. He desperately needed a break to catch his breath and rest for a few seconds but he wouldn’t allow it; if Draco stopped, he knew he wouldn’t do it, wouldn’t get to where he needed to, would just turn back. It had to be tonight. But maybe he was being loud for a reason, he might actually want someone to hear him.
Without sparing a second thought, he cleared his throat and decided to ask the blonde, “Sorry if this is a pain but would I be able to borrow something to sleep in? I didn’t think I’d be coming here tonight, obviously, and I’m still just in my clothes.”
“It doesn’t matter, nothing important but it had to be tonight.” Draco answered, unsure as to why he was speaking honestly, if a little cryptic.
Draco removed himself from Harry’s embrace with a wet sniff and found himself unable to meet Harry’s eyes. “Hey.” he heard Harry say softly to get his attention; looking up, Draco replied, barely above a whisper in a raspy tone, throat dry from his crying, “Hello.”
“Thank you for a wonderful day.” Draco murmured into Harry’s ear, the surprise of the warm air jolting the raven-haired boy.
The friends regrouped and slowly trudged to Hogsmeade, not realising how long they had actually been outside for and made for the Three Broomsticks where the Gryffindors were to be rewarded with free drinks. They walked in a line of three twos, Ron and Hermione leading the expedition with their fingers entwined and arms swinging backwards and forwards. Draco and Harry were just behind them, with their closest hand in the other’s pocket which was a way they figured they could feel the other person’s warm presence without having to bear the horrors of cold hands. Flanking them were Blaise and Pansy who were laughing away, throwing small snowballs at each other using the leftover flakes that were still on their clothes.
“I’m holding it because I just Engorgio-ed it so I could wear it today because I’ll be accompanying Draco to his dad’s trial, don’t ask. It’s a long story and kind of personal. Oh also, I almost definitely have a thing for him, no I will not be accepting questions.” He said as he finished buttoning the shirt from his heap on the ground, threw on the slacks, stepped into the loafers and made his second hasty exit of the day, leaving Ron gobsmacked in the dorm.
“Yes, I’m feeling delightful, thank you for asking.” He replied without a trace of malice in his voice.
As they took their seats in the spectators stand, overlooking courtroom 4, Harry took Draco's hand once more when he saw his face contort in pain as he laid eyes on his father and said, almost inaudibly into his ear, "I'm here." Draco was going to be okay.
"What would you like me to say?” Malfoy's voice was gravelly. He was sitting on his thin bed, leaning against the wall, dark eyes watching Harry who started slightly, having not expected cooperation in the conversation.
Seconds later, he found himself pushed against a wall, kissing Draco like it was all he knew how to do, like if he stopped, if they lost contact for a second, something terrible would happen.
Brushing off the insult, Harry looked intently at Malfoy. “I'm sorry you don't have any favourite memories,” he said quietly, almost a whisper. “But things'll be different now. Starting from now on.”
“Good job deflecting the topic,” Ron commented before raising his hand for a high-five. Harry rolled his eyes and ignored it. “Hey, I’m concerned too. Especially if it’s Malfoy.”
"He's still having headaches?” Pansy frowned, fingers itching to take out the file she kept on Draco to write down this new development. “But I gave him some medicine.”
The answer slipped past him as easily as breathing. “Okay,” was all Harry said, his mind going back to the War. The way many had died. The way
"Wha-?” Harry reached down and swept his finger under Draco's eyes, and then following it up, as if automatically, with his tongue. "Why're you crying?”
"Draco,” Harry started, intent on being the voice of reason. “If you agree, then you’ll be exactly as you said. A coward.”
"Pansy says you won't remember me,” Harry said finally, releasing the words into the cool night air. “She says that your memory of me is too tied into your past. She says that in the best case scenario, I wont get wiped out, you'll remember me as your acquaintance, but you won't remember any of the things we've done together.” Harry let out a wet noise that might have been a sob. “I don't know how that's the best case scenario.”
When Harry burst into Draco's new flat- without knocking -Draco was sitting at the kitchen table, with Pansy on the other side. Around them were a few cardboard boxes that held Draco's few possessions, yet to be unpacked.
"He gave us his decision yesterday,” Shacklebolt started gravely. Harry nodded numbly. “Well? Aren't you going to ask what he said?”
"At least you'll still be the Draco I know when you get out!” Harry insisted. He glared at the bars, wishing so much that they weren't there. He felt, if he could just touch Draco, physically, he would be able to convince him. “If you agree then...then what about
"They'll release you eventually,” Harry said weakly. “They'll have to. You don't have to accept this...”
"Malfoy, what's your favourite memory?” The damp walls of the cave, along with the persistent rain outside, made Harry's voice echo into the darkness. It had been three months since he had vanquished Voldemort for good. Three months since he volunteered to search for the Malfoys right after they vanished without trace the day before the trials. But what was three little months when added to seven years?
Having managed to find an extra mouthful of rice by scraping the bottom of the pan and thus ensuring he was probably eating metal, Harry spoke with his mouth full. “'S'not my fault you suck at hunting.”
"Pansy,” he said, giving her a smile as brittle as shards of glass, “the choices I have to make have
"I can't remember,” Draco whispered. Harry flinched, actually flinched, at the word, feeling it pull at his gut and send ice through his veins.
Inside Malfoy's cell, Harry felt chilled to his bones. Somehow, when it was warm outside, prisons always felt colder, and colder still when they contained someone you cared about.
"True, but you managed to swallow the dinner that took me two hours to prepare in about thirty seconds.”
Draco gave him a flat look. “It's only been a day.” When Harry persisted, he relented. “I have a slight headache.”
Harry slid his hands down to either side of Draco's face, holding him there, feeling puffs of air against his lips. Harry sucked it in greedily, making Draco squint at him. “What the hell are you doing?” he asked, his words soft as he dipped his head slightly to lick along Harry's parted lips.
Draco shook his head. He stared at the Manor, long and hard, focus never wavering for a second. After some time, when the cool of the night started to curl around them, Draco let out a long breath.
"I don't know what it is you expect me to do,” Shacklebolt said. “You do know he took the Dark Mark, right? He let the Death Eaters in Hogwarts, putting everyone’s lives at risk. He attempted to murder Dumbledore. He tortured muggles, he said so when we gave him Veritaserum.”
"Harry...” Shacklebolt sighed heavily. “Maybe it's better this way,” he suggested. “It could be like a fresh start for him...”
Blinking sleepily, the image of Harry came into focus, looking at him seriously. From the light, Draco surmised that it wasn't quite morning, or at least, quite a bit earlier than he usually woke up. He didn't recall waking up the previous night, so assumed it had passed nausea free, and was grateful. Even his ever present headache that now refused to be calmed by anything was hardly pronounced, just a quite throbbing that was easily ignored.
Draco cut him off with a quick but firm kiss. “Forget it,” he said seriously, leaning his head against Harry's for a second, so his grey eyes dominated Harry’s vision. “I don't want to spend any more time on the past.”
"Yeah,” Draco said. “But you know, that doesn't matter.” His cavalier attitude was enforced by the purposeful swig of alcohol he took. “You know why?”
The lights were off when Harry came home one evening. Considering that Draco might have a headache, Harry closed the door carefully, so it made no noise when it shut. Slipping off his sandals, he checked the bedroom, finding it empty.
Cringing a little at the intensity of Malfoy's glare and the pain in his voice, Harry leaned forward and grabbed the hand that was resting on Malfoy's knee, trying to convey some of his warmth into the cold skin. “Malfoy, I-” He was roughly shook off as Malfoy stood, presenting Harry with a view of his back.
Harry curled his lip in disgust. His previous fear about the agreement had all but disappeared, as he listened to Draco speak. Harry had never heard him speak like this, Draco was rarely vocal about his feelings (
"But that's bollocks, he can't get out until he proves himself, whatever that means, and he can't prove himself while he's stuck in Azkaban!” Harry straightened, frustrated, and paced in front of the desk, glaring at the untidy bookcase on one of the walls. “It's never going to end. He's gonna be stuck in there forever!” Shacklebolt was silent, watching his tense frame move agitatedly about the room.
Something tugged on his memory, and Draco felt the beginnings of a headache start at the back of his skull. There was something about sitting with Pansy, like this, and the door-
"Yeah,” Pansy agreed softly, reaching out to brush her hand against Harry's comfortingly. “But they still appreciate that he could be a strong asset to the Ministry, if his loyalty could be guaranteed. He could help track down the remaining Death Eaters, or he could help search for their possible hideouts. He could recognize traps and reverse some dark spells or curses casted if ever. The Ministry knows Draco’s good at his spellwork, not to mention his skills at Potions.”
"Hey,” he said to Harry, propping himself up a little and rubbing his face. Harry waited until he settled, before resuming his motion, brushing his fingers along the soft skin of his forearm, a brief swirl at his elbow and then upwards, drawing waves over his bicep. His blue eyes watched the motions, eyebrows slightly pulled together, as though deep in thought.
lived in our house for months? Or after, when my father convinced me to go with him and my mother because he’s too much of a coward to face the awaiting trials?"
"Yes, I do, don't I?” said Pansy vaguely, walking to the door. “But I've got to go, and I'm sure you'll do the right thing.”
"Umm, anything,” Harry said, hating how unfinished his words seemed. He didn't want to say the wrong thing, in case it triggered the simmering anger that resided in Malfoy. “What's on your mind?”
Draco didn't turn his head to look at Harry, just moved his eyes to lock gazes. “This is your home, Harry. This is your past, present and future. You won’t leave it.”
The Wizengamot had given Draco a week to decide what he wished to do. Harry spent the seven days locked up in his flat, Draco refusing to see him in his cell, with nothing to do but stew over what had been said.
His cell was isolated with one wall replaced with bars and reinforced with an invisible barrier, allowing visitors to stand on the other side. There was only ever one visitor.
"Maybe that's because I don't want to,” Malfoy snarled, throwing off the hand that Harry had placed on his shoulder, only to find himself shoved against the uneven wall of the cave with Harry infringing dangerously on his personal space.
"Hey,” Harry said, for lack of anything else to say. He took a step forward, and upon hearing the crack and looking down, realised he had stepped onto half of a plate. “What's-” he took another step forward and stopped as the scent of alcohol, pungent and edgy hit him full face.
Watching Malfoy now, even from the back, the light from the window blurring the side of his silhouette, seeing the way his shoulders were curled in, ever so slightly and the way his muscles shifted as he moved, was enough to make Harry's mouth dry with want.
So Harry locked the door, closed all the curtains in the apartment and then brought a pillow to the couch. In the comforting darkness, he set it in his lap and made Draco lie back, and Draco’s immediate compliance gave testament to the severity of his condition.
"Not that,” Draco shook his head, knowing what Harry was thinking. “You wouldn't have convinced me if I didn't want to come. At the Ministry, when we arrived.”
"I don't suck at hunting. I just had to get five times the usual amount of food because of your infinite appetite.” Malfoy tipped his head forward to glare. “Stop scraping that, you're eating tin filings.”
“But that’s not what bothers me, Harry.” Hermione’s face looked worried, her brows furrowed and his lips pursed.
At some point, they had shifted so that Draco was leaning on Harry, his bottle abandoned for now on the floor, while Harry's fingers had moved to run lightly up and down his arm, blazing a trail of barely-there sensation from his elbow to his hands.
"I just want to keep you to myself for a little bit longer,” Harry whispered once, curled up to sleep with his head resting on Draco's shoulder.
“It’s not only the fact that you lose any semblance of common sense when it comes to that prick,” Ron chimed in, and Harry saw Hermione gave her boyfriend a grateful look. “It’s also because you want to shag the daylights out of him. I don’t know who to pity between the both of you, honestly-”
"When you started eating and I thought I would be free of your incessant chatter.” Malfoy's head was tipped back, leaning against the rock wall of the cave they had settled in for the night. Malfoy’s eyes were out of the wavering area illuminated by their fire, but Harry thought they were closed, which made a marked change from the way Harry had felt Malfoy's gaze on him as of late.
Andromeda looked at him with something akin to pity. She reached out one hand and ruffled the top of Harry's hair.
headache,” Draco said, unperturbed as they continued walking. “It could be caused by something entirely different. Like your continuous whining.”
"So what's your favourite memory?” Harry kicked his heels against the ground impatiently, lifting a hand to scratch below his ear. “Mine is when Hagrid told me I was a wizard. And maybe when I learned about Quidditch. No, wait. When I found Sirius,” Harry’s voice caught at his late godfather’s name but he plunged on a beat later, ”and Lupin. Oh, when they told me about the Order. Well, actually,” Harry paused, grinning teasingly at Malfoy. “It’s probably when you promised to come back to London with me.”
There was silence for a while, only a quiet dripping coming from the tap above Malfoy's washbasin, the faucet of which wouldn't close properly. Harry thought Malfoy wasn't going to answer, and was surprised when he spoke. “What's on my mind?”
"Head Auror Robards wants to send me off with a group of Aurors at the MACUSA. He said that it was for experience, among other things.” His eyes didn't leave Draco's but his frown was replaced with an untouchable kind of sadness.
"Don't ask me stupid questions,” Malfoy said coldly. “We're not friends, you don't understand anything about me.”
The question was asked innocently, but Harry knew he had somehow misstepped, and braced himself, replying anyway. “Yeah, what are you thinking about?”
Blinking at him, Pansy patted his shoulder gently, a look of pity passing through her eyes before it cleared. “Idiot,” she said fondly. “That was two weeks ago.”
They had reached the corner of the street where Pansy's house was, and the point that they would usually split up when walking together, so they stopped under a street lamp. “I heard from Neville that the Minister spoke to them again today, like you asked him to.”
Suddenly on the same page, Draco stopped too. “No,” he said forcefully. “No. I never even spoke to her. Why would I remember?” Harry said nothing, too strung out to process the denials, so Draco punched him in the shoulder, demanding attention in a way that was as desperate as the lost expression on his face. “Hey, it's not
"I don't like thinking about it,” Harry said with a shrug. When Andromeda didn't say anything, he added: “It's been six weeks already.”
Harry had a feeling that they’ve talked about this behind his back more than a couple of times. “It’s not like we’re off getting married or something. He doesn’t even have to know.”
Shacklebolt didn't smile when he came in, just looked at him, taking in his appearance; tired eyes, dishevelled clothes, and slumped, defeated shoulders.
"Go on,” Draco said, quietly, not begging, not demanding. Just pressing himself that little bit closer to Harry and closing his eyes again.
"No,” Draco said. “I've been making it for years. I had it memorised.” There was that word again. Harry felt his stomach take another swoop. “And now I can't remember.”
Draco found himself pulled onto his back, Harry draped over him, kissing the side of his mouth, fingers dragging along his neck, cupping his shoulders and eliminating all distance between them. For once, Draco felt overwhelmed, trying to respond to all the stimuli, to the soft drag of Harry's tongue against his skin, the calloused pads of his fingers, the nails digging in and then releasing, and he almost didn't notice the tears until Harry pulled back and looked at him, his expression twisted up.
"Shhh,” Harry said, ignoring him. His head was tipped forward, so that he could see Draco properly, his hair falling downwards as he moved his hands curiously, with far more gentleness than he would have thought possible. “Let me,” he said, and Draco let him, willing to take any distraction over the pain throbbing in his head, and lulled by the womb-like darkness of the apartment, and the surprising coolness of Harry's fingertips.
Harry snorted. “You can be my caretaker if you want to, Ron. Follow me around and report back to Hermione. Surely that would be a fascinating chore.”
Harry gulped down his drink in one go. “I hope you won’t get bored without two idiots hovering on your side anymore.”
?” His raised voice caused a few stares in their direction, and noticing, Pansy grabbed his wrist, pulling him into a quieter side street and sitting down on a low wall. Harry stood, but she didn't complain.
The kitchen looked like it had been attacked, and put up a damn good fight. Most of the cupboards were open, one pulled off its hinge. The counters were covered in food, half made meals, and pots. A bag of rice with a rip in it sagged in one corner, a landslide of shiny grains seeping out. Sitting next to it, with his knees pulled up to his chin and his left hand embracing a bottle, was Draco.
And each time Harry made a new claim, Malfoy gave him a look that plainly voiced his skepticism, but said nothing.
Harry swallowed and took a step forward, then another, and another, until he was standing next to the table. While Pansy's eyes followed his movements, Draco only looked up when Harry was close enough to touch him.
"And don't flatter yourself, I'm not that desperate,” Malfoy continued, making a derisive noise. Harry raised his eyebrows, unconvinced.
"Harry,” Draco said very slowly and clearly, “I won't forget you. I promise.” Harry produced a watery smile and pulled on their joined hands, tugging Draco towards him. He came willingly, obligingly letting Harry wind around him, his warm, somewhat clammy skin press against his, and Harry's scent engulfed him.
"Forget it,” Draco said briskly, moving to the kitchen, hearing Harry follow him. “I said things too.”
"Moron,” Draco sighed as Harry leaned down, forearms braced on either side of Draco's head, holding his weight.
Outside, it was a perfect summer day. The sun was shining brightly, and the warm breeze through the trees was a familiar and comforting tune.
Blinking, Harry processed what Draco had said, not understanding. At the Ministry? “I don't know what you mean...”
Within a second, Harry scrambled next to Malfoy, grabbed his collar and made the other boy growl with irritation as he was pulled to the side. “What the hell?”
"Draco, look at me,” Harry panted, licking and biting against Draco's neck before moving up to meet his eye, his forearm propping himself up while his other hand rubbed gently at the skin on his hipbone. “Draco.”
"I know you’re a ponce, but I didn’t realize that you’ll be a snob to those who don’t belong to the same House as yours.” Harry cried, exasperated. “How could you forget something like tha-” He stopped as soon as he realised what he was saying; stopped talking, stopped walking, just stopped and stared without seeing anything except the little mound of hope he had been quietly building in the past four weeks be swept away into dust on the wind.
Pulling his knees up and resting his head on them, Malfoy held up a hand. “Leave now, Potter.” His voice was slightly muffled. He didn't sound angry, just tired.
"Quit it,” Harry snapped, shaking Malfoy's arm roughly, oozing dangerous, addictive warmth into every part of Malfoy's body he touched. “Stop pretending you don't care about me when it's obvious that you do.” Malfoy looked as though he was about to interrupt, but Harry ignored him. “Do you think I'm blind? That I can't see the way you've been looking at me ever since we started travelling around?”
"They came to me this afternoon and gave me their offer.” There was no hesitation in Draco’s speech, just smooth and soft. The kind of tone that made the worry Harry felt multiply again and again with every word.
"So you're saying, the reason Draco's in pain is me?” Harry looked shocked, and somehow hurt. Pansy didn't answer immediately, turning her watery eyes down, but when she spoke her voice was firm.
Draco said nothing. Harry elbowed him conspiratorially. “Did you know that? I mean, Pansy, your best friend, and Neville! Unbelievable, right? Poor Hannah.”
By the evening of the second day after Draco's release, everything was unpacked. They had cleaned up the Draco's flat which was of a fair size, and gone shopping to stock up on necessities. By tacit, Harry had brought a spare futon and set it up next to Draco's in the bedroom, as well as moving a few of his own things in.
Before Draco could adequately process this, Harry reached out and guided their faces together, capturing him in a short, sweet kiss, like he was closing a deal. Draco thought he tasted salt, but Harry's eyes were dry when he saw them for a second, before their positions changed and Harry was much closer, pressing his nose into the patch of skin behind Draco's ear, close to his hairline and inhaling deeply. “Not enough,” he said, his breath damp against Draco's neck, causing goosebumps. “It's not.”
Sighing, Harry stopped rolling on the balls of his feet and placed his hands on the desk, leaning so that he was more on the Minister’s level. When he spoke, his voice was quiet and serious. “He didn’t do it because he wanted to. He was left with no choice. He’s just like me, still too young yet forced to do things bigger than us.” Harry didn't have to mention who he was talking about. It had been obvious this was about Malfoy as soon as Harry had stepped into the Minister’s office. Everything had been about Malfoy since the two of them had returned.
Malfoy raised his head slightly to fix Harry with a thick, grim stare. “Right now, I'm thinking about outside. I'm thinking that I can't remember what the grass smells like. I'm thinking that when my pitiful excuse for dinner gets here, I won't be able to eat it, and even though I spent most of the night throwing up, I still feel so nauseous I can hardly breathe, and every time I try to stand up I nearly pass out. I'm thinking that your Minister has spoken with the Wizengamot four times already and not managed to do anything. And I'm thinking that the only thing more annoying than listening to the tap dripping incessantly every fucking second is listening to your pathetic, moronic voice.”
"It's a two part treatment. First a healing spell is used, requiring direct contact. That's what I'll be administering.”
"I don't have one,” Malfoy said after a few seconds, his eyes fixed on the opposite wall of the cave they had stopped in for the night.
"Maybe,” Harry said, giving the bite a firm lick and smiling at it. “I dunno what you taste like. Sort of... warm.”
Though he was scowling, Harry knew better than to think he was angry; this was fear. “Sure,” Harry managed to rasp out, agreeing because there was nothing else to do. “Sure. People forget stuff all the time. It doesn't mean anything.” He laughed, trying to be reassuring, and carried on walking.
"But there was a condition, Harry,” Pansy said. Sensing her lack of elation, the nervous way her eyes were scanning his reaction, Harry felt a cold fear grip him.
The side of Harry's mouth twitched up in a pale, ghostly imitation of his usual grin. “I don't need to.”
Swallowing, Harry took a few steps closer, relaxing marginally now that Malfoy's attention wasn't on him. It was a little easier once he'd gotten Malfoy to speak. He didn't have to pretend anymore that things were okay. He didn't have to talk to fill the silence.
"Aahh, Draco,” Harry panted, head back against the wall as Draco moved his mouth along the warm, soft skin of his neck. There was something about the position, the vulnerability and the trust, that made Harry shiver. Blindly, he reached out, weaving his fingers into Draco's pale hair and shuddering as Draco made a pleased noise, the sound vibrating against his damp skin.
The something dripping out of the fridge made another splat sound. Harry breathed in. “We first met at Madam Malkin’s. You were such a ponce back then already. But my first thought of seeing you was that you were the most beautiful boy I’ve ever seen. I think you haven’t heard any muggle stories, but to me you were like the prince charming in those fairy tales. And then you opened your mouth and ruined everything.” Harry laughed; he couldn’t help it. “And then there was that handshake I declined. I realized I may have been too rash at my actions and had set a prejudice on you early on as this pureblood prat, but it was already too late. Fighting with you was far easier, and less complicated.” He took another breath, and continued. “Then there was time at the Forbidden Forest, when you were terrified but you didn’t want to admit it. Then that Wizard’s Duel with Professor Lockhart. I wouldn’t forget our ‘Scared Potter’ and “You Wish’ exchange. We were both pricks. Then you bought your way in the Quidditch. But I haven’t told you that you were really good at it. You deserved to be on the team.” Harry wanted to stop, but he couldn’t. He needed to say it all out loud. “Then there was that year where you drew a sketch of me being hit by lightning. Nice portrayal of my hair by the way. And then you tried to scare me off with a dementor. When you made those ‘Potter Stinks’ badges. When you climbed a tree for me, you’re such a drama queen. I--” He was out of breath already, and Draco stopped his tirade with a raised hand.
Opening his eyes felt like the hardest thing to do, but Draco managed, breath catching at the intensity of Harry's gaze. He stretched up, wanting more contact, but Harry pressed him back down the hand on his hip squeezing in warning, so he fell back down, breathing heavily.
It was dark now, but both of their eyes had adjusted to the dimness, so that Harry could clearly see the look on Draco's face, and keenly feel the hurt, before any words were spoken. “Us?” Draco echoed, incredulously. “What hallucination are you living in? How can there be any kind of 'us' while my life is restricted to this cell? You should be happy, this way, you could get the relationship you want.”
"I make him take it, but he says it doesn't work,” Harry said with a shrug, staring off into the distance. The sides of his mouth pulled down. “He says it's nothing though, you know how he is.”
Draco was furious, and it was Potter's fault. He was the one that had brought him back, he might as well have locked the cell door himself. Sometimes he wondered where his parents were, and if they were okay.
Hearing that made Harry close his eyes in pain. At various points in his life, he would have wished for Draco to see his wrongdoings, his vendettas, in such a light, but not now, not after he'd thrown so much away to accomplish them. Not when he was left with no choice.
"I can't remember,” Draco said again, but this time harsher, louder, and with a slur that made Harry reassess how strong the contents of that bottle must be. “I can't
Immediately, Harry panicked. “You do? Why didn't you tell me? Is it bad? Rate it, on a scale of one to ten. Do you want me to get Pansy?” Draco punched him in the shoulder, but not hard. Despite this, Harry looked affronted, holding his jaw and glaring. “Well excuse me for
Hermione cleared her throat. “You know that’s not what we meant, Harry.” She sighed. “With Malfoy, you’re entirely a whole different person.”
Draco made an abortive noise in his throat, his grip on the bottle tightening to the extent that Harry was worried he'd snap its neck and cut himself. He reached forward to take the bottle but stopped at Draco's words. “No I can't. It was my mother's recipe. It tasted just like the one she made.”
Since then, Harry had been keeping a careful eye on Draco, but had noticed nothing abnormal in his actions. Although Pansy had warned that it was a progressive treatment, with the effects accumulating towards the end of the term, Harry couldn't help but hope that there was something wrong with it, and Draco would remain unaffected.
"Neville!,” Harry crowed, making Draco wince at the volume. “What’s up?” Neville seemed similarly put out by the interruption, but indulged Harry with a short conversation, before leaving, claiming he had to do some “troublesome” errands.
Harry's forehead wrinkled, his eyebrows pulling together. “What do you mean? I saw you the other day! When I went to St. Mungos and invited you for lunch with Terry Boot. You declined because you said the Spell Damage ward was jam-packed and you couldn’t afford free time.”
Harry gaped, Draco couldn't disguise the faint trace of longing in his voice. He really wanted this. “But you'll lose everything that makes you
"Then,” Harry paused, tasting the words, rolling them around his tongue to gauge whether or not he could say them. “Then we can leave.” He lowered his voice, brought his face close to Draco's. “We can just go. Your strength is coming back and I'd be there too. We could just go.”
"Did you write it down?” Harry ventured, eyeing Draco as if he was a cobra that might lash out at any second.
"I bet he won’t get any errands done,” Harry babbled, then gave Draco a sly glance. “I’m sure he’s on his way to Pansy’s right now.”
Andromeda gave him a smile. “For Draco, right now, there is no present. Soon enough he won't remember me, so it's pointless to waste time on something that doesn't exist.”
He turned in the direction of the voice and saw Pansy jogging towards him. She grinned as soon as he stopped and quickly caught up. “Hey Pansy, what's up?”
"What?!” Harry practically shouted, making Pansy shush him. His eyes brightened and he let out a tiny disbelieving laugh. “No way?!”
Pansy looked at him for a second, then nodded to herself, before changing the topic slightly. “You know, the Wizengamot isn't keeping Draco a prisoner because they think he's a danger.”
Gently, he brushed his lips against Draco's once, twice, then moved back, studying them carefully, mapping their appearance to what they felt like when pressed against his. “Draco?”
Trying to muddle through the words just confused Harry more, although he felt that he should be upset on Draco's behalf. “I don't understand.”
Draco looked a million times better. There was an ease to his features that Harry hadn't seen in a long time. The haunted look that had started to stay in his eyes, night and day, had dissipated a little. The small kitchen was flooded with sunshine and sitting there, Draco looked...calm.
As if on cue, he rounded the corner and found himself met with emerald green eyes and a very startled gasp.
“That’s okay.” Harry said as he grasped Draco’s wrist between his fingers and pulled him down to the dusty stone floor to sit next to him. Draco complied and let himself be led to the ground by The Boy Who Lived - twice.
“Great, I’ve got a light grey jacket and black slacks, now you just need to run all the way to Gryffindor, I’ll give you the slacks now because I doubt you’ll be back here within, ten minutes now so your jacket and I will be waiting at the Ravenclaw table.”
“Yeah.” Draco replied, unable to say anything else and surprised at how quickly Harry had cottoned on. He felt understood for the first time in years. He felt like Harry knew this had been a long time coming, that Draco was just waiting for a valid excuse, the words repeating themselves in his head in Harry’s soft voice, ‘you just had to do that from an earlier age.’.
“That’s okay, we can go to either Gryffindor or Slytherin, whichever you prefer.” Harry replied, seemingly unfazed at the notion of sleeping in the same bed as Draco.
“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, I was only asking! Anyway, what are you doing and why are you holding your old shirt?”
As the portrait let them through, into the Slytherin common room, Harry was taking in the new surroundings and didn’t notice something peculiar on one of the leather green sofas just outside his line of vision until he heard Draco grumbling and followed his gaze to see Pansy Parkinson’s dead-weighted body  sprawled over the antique furniture. She had very clearly passed out, drunk. Thankfully, someone had disposed of the empty bottles that had left slightly darkened rings on the coffee table in front of the sofa and replaced them with a hangover potion. Harry looked on in surprise, trying to remind himself that the stigma of Slytherins being heartless is completely untrue.
“Do what?” Draco replied, confused for a second before remembering his intentions that night, “...Oh, that.”
“Who said I still loved you?” Draco teased lightly, tugging Harry closer by his pocket to give him a chaste kiss on the cheek as they walked, nearly at the Three Broomsticks.
As Draco mulled over what the raven-haired boy had said, his words started to resonate as he thought back and realised that almost nobody had done so much as look stonily at Draco since he’d been back at Hogwarts. Maybe some of what Harry said had been true, of course that didn’t change how he’d been feeling in the first place but it definitely shed some light on him. He continued to sit and think until he was reminded of Potter’s presence by a rather violent sneeze that came from the left of him.
His mind was racing with thoughts and theories as to why Malfoy was up here, so much so that he didn’t realise the fact that he hadn’t stopped staring at Malfoy. Harry was only taken out of his stupor when he heard Draco mutter to himself under his breath, “Well that’s thrown a spanner in the works.”
“Oh yeah of course but everyone was so convinced it would be the pelting of the century I would have felt bad if I had said no.” Harry replied, trying his best to look genuine and not show the smile that was threatening to take over his face
There was no room in his mind for such thoughts, not after he had come up with the plan, if he did it tonight, it would seem like the events of the impending day were the cause, not the stupid little things that stuck, gradually wearing him down. If anything, tomorrow would be a relief; it was his father’s trial, people would expect him to be emotionally vulnerable now and they’d come to their own conclusion based upon it. As his thoughts continued to wander over to his father’s trial, he couldn’t help but question what Lucius would do or say if he knew what his son was about to do. He’d most likely sneer at Draco icily and tut at him before saying, “I never thought you were worthy of the family you were born into, your name and everything it has given you. You disgrace me and I will disown you if you try to do this, just think about what people will say if word gets out that you did this. You would make Malfoys look weak.” Draco shuddered at the mere thought of his father’s cruel, cold tone; only now realising how much of a negative influence he’d had on him.
“Why shouldn’t I though? It’s not like anyone would miss me, I’m just a snarky pureblood that no one likes; and for good reason. I mean, I was a bully, Merlin I treated Granger like utter shite and Weasley too as well as you, Longbottom, Lovegood, Weaslette, the list goes on.”
The afternoon went on with the group getting nicely tipsy, together leaving a slightly bubbly feeling in all of their stomachs and a welcome warm tingle in the tips of their fingers and toes before retiring back to Hogwarts together and then to their dorms.
“That’s completely fine with me. Do you need help getting up?” He groaned as he stood, ankles clicking from the sudden movement.
In Slytherin, there were many winding corridors to go down in order to reach the dorms, each hallway was filled with mirrors, paintings and various tapestries, placed in such a way to bring a homely feel to an otherwise quite grim walk to the dorms.
As Draco ascended  the spiral stairs that led up to the astronomy tower, he misjudged his step and walked into the side of a marble pillar to his right. “Yet another bruise to add to my growing collection.” He mumbled under his breath; despite no one being around to hear him.
“You can drop the act Harry, you’re a truly pathetic liar, I know it was you who thought to do it.” Draco said, with an amused look in his eye to tell Harry he wasn’t mad
Dazzling rays of sun pooled in through the window of the dorm room located in the east wing tower, shared by two boys no-one could’ve imagined ever ending up together. One side of the bed was inhabited by none other than Draco Malfoy.
Without thinking, Harry shucked the rest of his cloak off his shoulder, stepped forward and pulled the Slytherin into his arms, holding tight. He felt Draco still for a few seconds before melting into the embrace and letting his weight be held up by Harry.
“Of course we can.” Harry spoke quietly, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck and taking in the blonde’s scent of citrus fruit and pine wood.
Harry was just taking off his invisibility cloak, feeling the fresh air hit the skin of his half exposed arms as he looked forward and saw the unmistakable glint of Draco Malfoy’s steely grey eyes falling onto him. A gasp escaped his lips before he could register it. Why was Malfoy up at the top of the astronomy tower at 2:30 in the morning?
Harry was in stitches a couple of metres in front of Draco and looked dangerously close to pissing himself right there on the spot, Draco couldn’t help but laugh with him which set off Blaise who set off everyone else with his throaty laughs that were almost too contagious.
Draco opened his eyes and found his face nestled in a mess of black curls and dark skin. That was the happiest he had felt in a long time, he felt warm and tingly inside when Harry squeezed him more as he was stirring himself.
“Okay so I did, but you cannot blame me! Honestly you should’ve seen the look on your face, Merlin it was gold, pure gold!” He replied, giving up and letting out chuckles that had been held in for too long
“Okay, okayyyy Gryffindor Vs Slytherin, but just know you have the upper hand.” Harry snorted at his own pun before it landed on Draco who just looked at him confusedly.
They laid in each other’s arms for a further eight minutes before they heard movement coming from one of the other beds in the dorm, to the left of them. “Blaise,” Draco breathed in Harry’s ear, “he wakes up at this time every day, showers for seven minutes, gets dressed in three and brushes his teeth. We have twelve minutes to get dressed and start making our way to the Great Hall for some breakfast.”
