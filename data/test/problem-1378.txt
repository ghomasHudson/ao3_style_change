"Do you two want to stay here for the night?" Draco looked at them. "If it's no imposition that would actually be lovely" Ron said. "You could surely borrow some of my mother's nightclothes if needed" Draco said looking at Hermione.
"You can wear something of one of ours obviously" Draco said and got up going to their room. "The couch is a pullout." Harry said. "Here mate" Draco handed Ron some joggers and a t-shirt. "Thanks" Ron said.
"Bed rest. I do not expect to see you at meals tomorrow. Or classes." Snape ordered rather demandingly. "Yes sir" Harry said. "Good, Draco keep an eye on him. We both know he likes trouble. After all he does like you" Snape chuckled and Draco hit his shoulder softly. Harry chuckled as well. Snape left before they did, for the soul purpose of dramatically swishing his robe around as he left.
"What's up Harry?" Neville looked at him. "Just a few questions" Harry smiled. Ron and Hermione were obviously lost, but didn't really care. They began talking with Draco about how school has been complete rubbish.
"It is a lovely Christmas isn't it?" Bellatrix smiled. Everyone in the room agreed.
Harry's cheeks heated up and he knew he would never hear the end of it from Draco. "His journal?" Draco asked holding back laughter. "Yes his journal, Draco this and Draco that." Ginny fixed her posture and crossed her arms. Hermione and Ron were trying to keep their composure, but failed desperately and began laughing. "Well why'd you do it?" Draco chuckled as well but knew he would be able to tease Harry about it later on.
"If you want him you have to get through me!" Draco yelled at her and threw spells at her like a madman. Harry did the same. "I'm okay with killing you and him hon." Bellatrix giggled.
Narcissa smiled at the two boys. "Do you two like your gifts?" She asked. "Yes, these are truly amazing. I'm so grateful" Harry said to her, nearly in tears. He had never had this kind of experience. Everyone was happy and getting along. There was no yelling or stress. Harry felt safe. He felt as if this whole home was untouchable.
Harry looked down at arm where his sleeve had lifted, it was only the backside so if Draco saw anything it wasn't the...markings upon his wrist. Harry swiftly pulled the sleeve down and looked back up to Draco. Draco seemed to have a look of concern or worry, but he quickly dropped that look.
Narcissa grabbed her wand as well and walked over, standing next to Harry and Draco.
"Yes Ron you're totally gorgeous" Draco chuckled and hugged Ron as well. Ron laughed and smiled. "Thanks mate" They were cut off by a knocking on the door. "Everyone remember the main motive is to get blaise and neville together" Harry smiled and Draco went to open the door.
"Then what did you need?" Hermione asked looking at him. "Potter's a little..down, I figured a visit from his best friends might cheer him up." Draco shrugged. "You're doing something considerate?" Ron nearly choked on his food. Draco scoffed. "I'm not a complete prat" He said.
"Can I be discharged yet. I feel fine I wanna go lay in your room" Harry whined. Draco chuckled and caressed Harry's hair. "Love, that is not a question for me. I can get Snape if you want?" Draco looked down at Harry.
Draco finally arrived to Harry's bedside. Harry looked pale, and sickly. Draco felt his stomach churn. He took Harry's hand in his own and pressed it against his forehead. "I love you, stay with me" Draco mumbled.
"It's gorgeous darling" Draco kissed Harry, Draco really kissed Harry with every ounce of love in his body. "Okay okay your turn, It was sort of last minute. Although I think you'll love it" Draco smiled and waited impatiently for Harry to unwrap his gift.
"Come on stay with me Harry." Draco kissed him softly. Harry slightly kissed back. Everyone else in the room just stared. Lupin was traumatized from seeing Harry like this. Madeye was extremely confused why they were kissing. McGonagall thought, she owed Snape 10 galleons. But overall they were all extremely devastated at this turn of events.
"Now can we get out of here i'm tired and my head hurts" Harry whined. "Yes of course your majesty" Draco got up and bowed. Harry rolled his eyes and laughed. Harry got up and grabbed onto Draco for support. Draco held him up. "You alright?" Draco looked down at him. "Yes" Harry stabled himself and walked up to Madame Pomfrey. "Thank you, have a good rest of your day Madame Pomfrey" Harry smiled.
Ron and Hermione had returned for his coat, they heard the fighting and went inside after using the unlocking charm. They were now watching this intense scene going on in front of them, very confused what was happening.
Draco sighed and left the dorm to see if Harry was in the Great Hall. He walked through the halls, ignoring everyone. Draco arrived in the Great Hall and his eyes fell to the Gryffindor table where he saw Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry was there. Harry left the dorm without telling him.
"Well then you all can stop by say tomorrow night?" Harry looked at all of them. They all nodded. "Make sure to knock before entering, you wouldn't believe how many times these two blokes walked in on something they shouldn't have" Draco chuckled and looked at Ron and Hermione. Harry felt a slight blush creep up on his cheeks. Ron and Hermione nodded in agreement with Draco.
The scene in the hallway did not go unnoticed. Many different people were staring at the three of them. Slytherin's looked disgusted and Gryffindors looked disgusted. A few Hufflepuff were laughing hysterically.
"So want me to take care of that one too?" Hermione said and pointed her wand at Barty who was still very unconscious. "No. Let me do it" Draco kissed Harry's forehead and stood up. He pointed his wand down at the man and said the spell. The murderous spell. "That felt amazing" Draco straightened out his shirt.
~This is more about what happens once they get together, not completely about them getting together. They do get romantically involved rather fast ~
"Yes yes let's go" Harry smiled and left the room in front of Draco. Draco was going to say something, but then smirked to himself because if Harry was in front he could watch him walk away.
He heard the door open. Harry hoped it was Draco. He turned around and it was Zabini. "Leave me alone now." Harry said sternly. Blaise pulled out his wand and a vial. "We could do this the easy way or the hard way, your pick" Blaise said walking closer to him.
Harry got up and walked over to Draco's room. "Draco?" he said into the seemingly empty room. Harry cocked his head and turned to go into his own room. Harry looked around "Draco?" He said into his empty room.
They got off of the train, grabbed their stuff, and made their way up to the Gryffindor dorms. Harry saw one of the only openly gay couples holding hands, Louis and Harry, a Gryffindor and a Slytherin. Harry never understood how one could have so much courage. To be so open.
"Wow okay you shouldn't have gone first, now I'm going to cry throughout mine" Harry chuckled and sniffled. Everyone there laughed as well. Harry wiped his eyes and nose.
"Goodbye Harry try not to miss me too much" Blaise said, rubbing it in Draco's face. "Bye handsome" Harry batted his eyelashes. Draco gritted his teeth. "Draco please escort Potter to the hospital wing" Snape said looking over at Draco. "Yes sir" Draco said taking Harry's arm and leading him away.
Draco awoke bright and early. He almost got up out of reflex but looked down to see Harry cuddled up to him. Draco smiled softly and rubbed Harry's back. He was falling for Harry and he knew it. Draco had only hoped Harry felt the same.
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
Hermione came back upstairs a little later wearing a long silk green nightgown. "Well you two, it's been lovely" Draco said smiling. "Please sleep well." Harry hugged his friends and they said goodnight.
"Open water? Like the ocean?" Draco rubbed Harry's arm. "Yes I mean it would be so easy to die in it" Harry shuddered thinking about it. "What are you afraid of?" Harry turned on his side. "Being without you and...spiders I hate spiders. I hate spiders so much" Draco was now the one shuddering. Harry began laughing. "Spiders are harmless, you get bit and a little itchy. That's all love" Harry continued laughing.
Three smiling gay guys in the hospital wing. Quite an odd scene for a passer-bier.
Draco cleared his throat. "Well on with it then, we haven't got all day." Hermione made a plate for Harry. Ron just continued eating while grabbing his things. Draco took Harry's plate along with his own and made his way out of the hall. Hermione and Ron followed.
open each button. One by one. Slowly, as slow as he could.
No response.
A lump formed in Harry's throat. He hadn't even thought about it, returning back to his suffocating family. Harry got a tiny bit shaky, his anxiety kicking in. Draco noticed and began to rub small circles on Harry's hip.
In this moment all Harry knew was it was him and Draco.
Harry sighed and continued fidgeting to put his shoe on. Draco walked off and got dressed. He fixed his tie and his hair. He took a deep breath before leaving his room. "Very dashing" Harry said chuckling. Draco's heart ached and his stomach churned. "Don't be odd Potter" He said trying to sound his most steady and rude.
Innocent lives had been taken on his behalf. Lupin's wife had been taken from him because of Harry. Harry was now a sort of shell of who he once was.
Draco cried the whole way there. The echoing of Harry's laughter hadn't left Draco's brain for the past four days. All he could hear was the happiness. The happiness that went silent on Christmas.
"That should be all" Harry smiled and finished putting the items in his trunk. Draco closed his wardrobe and walked over to Harry. Harry got into his bed and pulled the covers up over himself. Draco smiled and got in as well. Harry moved close to him, completely wrapping himself around Draco. Draco smiled it was almost as if Harry was trying to merge them. "I'll really miss you" Harry mumbled.
Draco got up and walked into the bathroom. Harry went to his own room to look for a change of clothes. He changed into his daily clothes and fixed up his hair. "Bathrooms open" Draco shouted so Harry could go use it. "Thank you" Harry shouted back and went for his turn in the bathroom. Draco now changed into his daily clothes. He took a look at himself in the mirror and smiled.
"That's not cheesy. That sounds romantic." Draco smiled. "I'll take you to Paris one day" Draco finished his sandwich and wiped his mouth. Harry giggled. "Well then whats your biggest dream?" Harry said looking over at Draco. "It's also a bit cheesy, but I want a nice home on the countryside. Although nothing too basic of course it needs to be flashy and gorgeous.." Draco stopped to clear his throat. "I want to live there with you and a kid. A child we can spoil and raise the right way, without the homophobia and the abuse. We could have a dog and a cat. We would send them to Hogwarts once they got old enough."
"Well thank you darling" Narcissa said from the doorway. Draco walked back into the room. "Hermione dear why don't you come with me and pick something out to sleep in?" Narcissa smiled kindly from the door. Hermione looked around before getting up. "Alright thank you Ms. Malfoy." She walked over to the doorway and they walked out together.
He wanted to throw up at the thought of it. Harry's head ached and his eyes were heavy. He sat up slowly and looked down at his hand which was being held. His eyes landed on Draco who was sitting in a chair his head resting on the bed, asleep. Harry smiled. He hoped Draco wasn't angry.
Draco rubbed his temples. "I'm glad he chose you" Hermione smiled. "Me too mate" Ron said and took a seat by Harry's bed.
Harry rose to his feat, Draco watched with his hand still entwined with Harry's. Draco grabbed his wand and stood up as well. Draco was willing to fight, to die for Harry. "Ah looks like we'll have a fair duel after all" Bellatrix clapped cheerfully.
"Come in" Harry said while looking under his pillows for his glasses. Draco entered the room with Harry's glasses and looked at Harry who was frantically searching for his glasses. "Looking for these?" Draco held up Harry's glasses.
A master bathroom. It was humongous. A bathtub with a separate shower. Double sinks, for him and Draco. Two silk robes hung from hooks on the back of the door. A red and gold on, a silver and green one. Harry smiled and held his heart. This was truly one of the best things anyone had ever done for him.
"Wait so Harry's..like..gay?" Ron said with that confused look on his face he usually had. "Well I mean...I think so I've always thought that." Hermione chuckled to herself. "He's gay?! Like gay? Like into men?" Ron stopped walking. "Well Ron you moron if you were listening I don't know but I think so. Keep your voice down" Hermione said "Oh well I just wish he had told us it's not like we wouldn't have understood, I hope he knows we would love and support him either way" Ron said and continued walking.
"Th-there's more to the st-story" Harry sniffled and wiped his eyes trying to stay calm. Draco nodded and held Harry's hands. "All of this is happening to me, who do you think would be able to stop it?" Harry asked Draco. "Probably Dumbledore wait why haven't you told him?" Draco was confused.
"What is this child doing here?" Mad eye looked at him. "Draco is coming with us, no exceptions. He was the one who discovered Harry was missing. He knows Malfoy Manor better than any of us do." Snape said. The three other professors nodded in agreement.
"Malfoy Manor, my father would've taken him to the dungeons in Malfoy Manor" Draco told Snape and Snape repeated it to everyone. The professors, Ron and Hermione, and Draco all had gotten their wands. They were ready to leave. They were ready to go get back what was so rudely taken.
"We've made arrang-" Snape continued speaking before Draco excitedly cut him off. "You're staying with us for Christmas Harry" Draco turned to look at Harry. Draco was beaming.
"Lou bear, come on" Draco heard a voice say from behind him. "Coming, one moment Harry" Louis smiled. "Hello Styles" Draco turned and waved. Harry waved back. "Well I must be going, enjoy your little Potter problem" He turned and walked over to his Harry. They intertwined hands and went to Gryffindor table. Draco followed and found a place next to the red headed boy.
"Sev?" Draco stared at him. "I told Headmaster I would see Potter off" Snape said in his usual monotone. "Why?" Draco proceeded to stare. "So you two can have your time to say bye without the Headmaster watching" Snape's lips upturned into a small smile. Harry came out of his room and smiled. "Snape" He walked up to him dragging his trunk along. "Yes yes hello." Snape smiled again.
Barty smirked. "Hon, this is going to be our biggest accomplishment yet." He said. Bellatrix turned around to face him. "I couldn't be more excited" She said with a devilish smirk on her face.
Draco got into his bedroom and closed the door. He took a moment to process everything that had just happened. Draco got to make out with Harry Potter. Draco made Harry Potter moan, and whine for more. Draco smiled and was on cloud nine. He had finally got to do what he had wanted to for years, and Harry wanted it as well.
"Well we can continue to talk tomorrow, I'm sorry for worrying you." Harry smiled. "Don't be sorry, it's not technically your fault" Draco smiled as well and re- wrapped his arms around Harry. "Just wake me next time you need some fresh air alright?" Draco whispered. "Alright" Harry whispered back.
Everything felt good, too good. Draco had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach, but he dropped it. He was going to enjoy this moment, for however long it would last.
"No Potter problem. No potter anything." Draco said softly. Trying his best to keep his voice steady. "What?" She looked at him furrowing her eyebrows. "Nothing anymore" he mumbled and looked back at the Gryffindor table expecting to see Harry looking back at him. He didn't. Harry's seat was empty. Draco prayed Harry wasn't doing what he thought.
"Oh and we're having a few friends for dinner upstairs tonight." Draco said as he passed by her on the way to the back door. "Okay sweetheart" Narcissa said and walked back to the table where she had been wrapping more gifts.
Harry turned a shade of bright red and looked down. Draco just smirked and turned to go to his room. "Sweet dreams Potter" Draco said and shut his door. Harry walked into his bedroom shut his own door. He fell back against it. Harry's neck was marked up, his lips were bruised, and his emotions were thrown around aimlessly...
"You should've waken me I would've gone with you" Draco said softly yet angrily. "You looked so peaceful I didn't want to disturb your beauty sleep" Harry said chuckling.
"We will, now go eat" Ron said and shooed him away. Draco slowly left and forced himself not to turn his head back around to look at Harry. Draco walked through the halls dragging his fingers along the stone.
"Well then, seems we're all accounted for. Follow us" Draco smiled taking Harry's hand. They walked upstairs with everyone following. They opened the door into their suite. "Make yourselves at home" Harry said smiling.
He slightly squeezed Harry a bit tighter.
They kissed. Blaise to make the first move, trailed his hand along Neville's cheek. Their lips instantly meeting, they were so drawn to each other. It was difficult for them to not.
"Now like this" Draco began moving his feet slowly in a small pattern.  Harry began to pick up the pattern and he attempted to follow Draco's movements. He ended up stepping on Draco's foot. "Oh I'm so sorry" Harry was staring down at his feet trying to get them to move correctly. Draco chuckled. "Look at me, let the music take your body in the right direction" Draco waited for Harry to look up.
Once their eyes met they both knew that was it for them, they could see a future in each other's eyes. They saw the perfect days together, they saw the fun and joy that lasted forever on. So they did what they both had been yearning to do.
Draco smirked and carried Harry over to the couch.
"We have got to change that password" Draco and Harry had both said at the same time. "For once we agree on something, I don't want that twit popping in whenever he pleases." Harry said with anger brooding in his tone.
He draped it over both of them. "I have a passageway we can go through to go in unnoticed." He said taking her through it. She looked around and smiled. "Harry Potter breaking rules? Sounds like i'm in an alternate universe"
Draco wasn't afraid to express how he truly felt now. He didn't care. He had always cared but now it was different. His father was in Azkaban his mother was building a new healthy life without the wretched monster. Voldemort was dead, his mark was gone.
"Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
Harry finished up in the bathroom. "Come on you're taking forever" Harry walked back into Draco's room. "Hey you can't rush perfection" Draco chuckled and walked toward the door. Harry followed. "Let's come back here after breakfast so you can get the book" Harry walked out into the hallway. "Alrighty" Draco was now following Harry.
"I'm sorry" Draco whispered. " 'M a coward...always have been" Draco said. Harry looked up at him intently. "I'm so sorry, i never meant to hurt you, I thought I was doing the right thing but" Draco faltered. He became very aware of how many emotions were flowing through his body. His head was spinning, he felt flustered.
Harry made his way outside through a passage he had found 4 years earlier with the help of his map. "I solemnly swear I am up to no good" Harry whispered and the map revealed itself. He smiled and walked on the dewy grass.
"Well then enjoy your lunch" Draco grabbed his food, nodded, and started out of the room. "Wait" Draco stopped and turned around.  "Don't go" Harry smiled and pat the bed for him to come sit. "I don't want to intrude" Draco looked at the three Gryffindor. "We've intruded plenty of times haven't we? Think of this as revenge" Ron said and chuckled.
Harry's cheeks reddened and he smiled. "What ever is that supposed to mean Parkinson?" Harry chuckled. "Oh nothing, just don't be surprised if you end up in his bed" She smiled. "Oh and if, no no, when you end up in his bed, tell me. I have a bet going"  She kicked a small rock that was in her way.
She smiled. "Go talk to him" She suggested rather aggressively. "Wh- what why?" Harry said thrown off.
It had been four days since the incident. Draco referred to it as the incident, he would never say the day the love of his life died.
Draco and Harry took their seats across from her. "Boys you look handsome" She smiled warmly. "Thank you auntie" Draco smiled back. Harry smiled as well. "Harry how has school been?" Bellatrix looked at him with kind eyes. Harry could tell she was really trying so he decided to try too.
"Oh your friends left?" Narcissa said as she came back into the room. "Yes they had plans mum" Draco said and made a ball of the wrapping paper. "Oh okay, we'll then how about we-" Narcissa was cut off by Bellatrix entering the room. She was wearing the outfit she wore at the battle.
He never did.
Draco's hands traced Harry's waist slowly, his fingertips roaming Harry's bare skin. Harry but his lip slightly and stared up at Draco as he began to unbutton Draco's shirt as well. Draco places his lips on Harry's roughly, Draco picked Harry up and carried him to the large bed in the other room.
No answer. He decided to open the door. What he saw made his heart drop a little. Harry's bed was made neat and tidy, his shoes were gone from in front of his wardrobe. Draco's heart sped up but he tried to calm it with the thought of Harry probably left without him, meaning Harry was still angry about whatever he was mad at.
Draco locked the bedroom door with his wand, trying to be safe before shutting his eyes and letting sleep overtake him.
"Harry you're going to be alright I promise." Draco held his hand. "Can one of you do something?!" Draco looked around, he was crying. Snape rushed over and began trying to help.
"You're lying!" Draco voice raised a little more. "I'm not. You know who outed you?!" Blaise said back. "Who? Huh Zabini? Who?" Draco re crossed his arms.
Madam hooch stated and intertwined her own hands in front of her. "Thank you Madam Hooch" Draco said cooly. Harry and Draco started off the field. They were both laughing to themselves. "Oh and if you boys do come snooping around here again, just don't let me catch you" Madam Hooch winked and walked off.
Harry's face which once lit up a room with his smile, was pale and expressionless. Draco was sobbing, his whole body ached. He felt as if the glue holding him together had all just melted away. Draco's heart was breaking with every passing second. He stared down at the lifeless body of the love of his life. Draco could barely see, he could barely breathe.
"It is a lovely Christmas isn't it?" Bellatrix smiled. Everyone in the room agreed.
"Your mum is an angel Dray" Harry smiled picking out a suit. He pulled out a red one, considering it was around Christmas it felt right to where red while Draco wore green. It was dark deep red, with a black tie.
"Hello Madame Pomfrey, Snape has ordered Harry be here, do you mind if I take him in?" Draco said politely. "Oh I usually wouldn't allow it, but I was about to go on a little dinner break so go ahead hon" Madame Pomfrey smiled and let them in.
Harry couldn't even begin to think that anything would happen because Draco made it clear, no feelings. Harry already had feelings, but he would continue to hide them just as he had for the past 4 years.
those girls?" Draco said pushing on. "I- Of course" Harry said crossing his arms. "You seem rather nervous for you to be telling the truth Potter"
Draco felt tears well up in his eyes and he made an unexpected turn into the bathroom. Harry watched him go. He decided it was a smart move to follow him in. "Draco?" Harry asked softly looking over to Draco who was staring at himself in the mirror. "I'm sorry you had to see that or meet him or.." Draco faltered and sighed wiping his eyes.
"Okay spit it out" Harry pushed on looking at Draco. "You like all of this right?" Draco watched Harry's expression change. Harry was not about to admit to Draco Malfoy that he loved the way Draco's lips felt on him. Harry got up but Draco grabbed his arm softly. "No Potter, no you're not just going to run away from this, Its just a simple question"
Harry sat down on his bed he hadn't even looked around his new room yet, he was too busy being embarrassed and trying not to cry. Harry put his head in his hands when he heard a knock at his door. His heart skipped a beat. Harry was about to be made fun of or beaten up he thought. "Y- yes?" Harry said trying to keep a steady tone.
Draco took a seat next to Harry. "Hello Granger, Weasley, Potter" Draco smirked.
Harry scooted into Draco's arms. The strong scent of Draco once again filled Harry's nose. "We must ask ginny what the hell her problem is." Harry stated into Draco's firm chest.
Harry looked up at him, still a mess from his night terror. He didn't want to be alone especially after that awful terror. The gross imagery and gruesome words were still running laps in his mind. "Stay?" Harry said groggily barely aware of what he was saying. Draco looked down at Harry almost as if he was about to protest. "Or don't i'm sorry that was stupid of me to say." Harry felt his cheeks go pink. All of a sudden he was very aware of what he was saying.
It got worse and worse everyday. Everyday Draco would cry more and more.
"Make sure dinner isn't late tonight Freak"
"We made it" Draco smiled. A sound of heels clicking came closer and closer until Narcissa was in the room and rushing over to hug the two of them. "Harry I'm so happy you could be here" She pulled away from the hug smiling.
Harry looked up at Draco innocently. Draco bit his lip and leaned down to kiss Harry. His lips met Harry's, it was still a shock. Harry smiled and kissed back. Draco picked Harry up holding his thighs. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's torso. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck.
Draco was on him, his arms on either side of Harry's head holding him up. Draco looked down at Harry for a little. Harry stared back at him, had enough of the sweetness. Not that he didn't love it but he wanted a little more of..whatever that was. Harry smirked and pulled Draco's face down to meet his. Draco entangled his hands in Harry's raven hair.
Harry started brushing his teeth. Draco finished before Harry did but he waited for Harry to finish. Once Harry finished Draco walked out of the bathroom, Harry followed. Harry crawled into Draco's bed and yawned.
"That was odd" Harry said putting his plate on his bedside table. "Always is around Granger" Draco said chuckling. "Hey she's not as bad as she may seem sometimes." Harry said smiling. "No I know she's just very..inquisitive" Draco said. "I will be going now, I'm never sleeping in here again I could barely sleep with all the ugly red and gold." Draco spat. "Don't worry you won't have to" Harry said rolling his eyes. "Good, good day Potter" Draco said getting up and leaving.
"Wanna go lay down for a bit?" Draco said as he caressed Harry's hair. Harry nodded and went into the large bedroom. Draco followed. "This is so amazing" Draco said plopping down on the bed. "I know it's amazing" Harry laid down on the surprisingly soft bed. "The bracelets are amazing." Harry smiled. Draco nodded and wrapped his arms around Harry securely.
Draco just stared at the bruises. Harry's eyes stung with tears. He tried to blink them back. Draco was in complete shock. It was dark, the moonlight from Harry's window being the only thing providing any light. Draco let out a deep breath and looked back up to meet Harry's watery eyes.
Draco heard the portrait open. His heart skipped a beat. Maybe Harry had come back early. Maybe it was an intruder. Draco grabbed for his wand and aimed it at the door. He heard the door to his room open. Draco furrowed his eyebrows. Someone was looking for him. Draco slowly got up and approached Harry's door.
Harry awoke maybe just an hour or two after he had drifted off to sleep. When he woke up his head was resting on a pillow instead of Draco. Harry rubbed his tired eyes and got up, looking around. He grabbed for his glasses and put them on.
Draco laid his head back on his headboard, letting his eyes fall shut. Harry sucked down Draco's neck, going fast enough to not leave any marks, just invisible marks of pleasure being left behind. Harry looked up at Draco and reached for the top button of his shirt. Draco nodded and watched Harry begin to pop
"What are you most afraid of?" Draco said while staring at the ceiling. "Hm, good question" Harry looked inquisitive. "Losing you being my number one and...open water. Definitely open water" Harry said smiling. Draco chuckled.
They finally arrived and Draco dragged himself out of the car. He was in barely any condition to be awake. He hadn't eaten and he had barely slept.
"Blaise" Harry smiled and hugged him. He was barely in control of what he was doing. The only thing circling his mind was Blaise. A feeling of emptiness clouded his heart, remembering someone, he couldn't recall who. "Class is over, we missed the rest of it" Blaise said stroking Harry's hair. "Alright Blaise" Harry was lost in his eyes, just staring up at him from the bathroom floor.
Draco eventually fell asleep.
Harry took a moment to look out at the city then around the top of the tower. "Where is everyone?" Harry looked around. "I may have rented out this platform. It's the highest  and most beautiful view. And ever since Lucius  died I've had the money" Draco snickered.
Snape walked past their table. "Is there a problem?" He asked in his monotone. "The potion didn't work on Harry, I did everything right I always do potions right" Draco said still reading. "So you don't feel any different towards Mr.Malfoy?" Harry shook his head.
"Look in the back of my wardrobe."
Harry shuddered at the memories. "Your friends are gone?" Bellatrix asked politely, warmly, sweetly. "Yes they left a few minutes back." Harry replied with a smile.
"Wait is that why Dumbledore put them in a dorm together, do you think he wants to like see what might happen" Ron said looking at a now very shocked Hermione. "Ron I think you've just said one of the smartest things you've ever said" She smiled. "So Dumbledore knows..he knows everything, that sneaky little prat." Hermione said smiling still.
Harry and Draco watched the whole awkward exchange. "This is going to be fun" Draco smirked and finished eating. "I couldn't agree more" Harry smiled. "Well then we'll see the two of you probably sometime this week considering Christmas is next." Harry looked down at the two of them.
Draco didn't start pumping his fingers until Harry adjusted to this foreign item being put inside of him. Draco's fingers brushed against Harry's prostate causing him to moan louder then he ever had. "Baby, sh.." Draco pulled his fingers out.
Harry noticed Draco's hands had been a tiny bit sweaty. He seemed more jittery than usual. Harry let it slide because maybe it was just excitement or something.
Draco finally drifted off to sleep after about 15 minutes of staring at his room examining every dark corner and crevice someone could be hiding in. I guess he was pretty paranoid. Draco slept soundly, his dreams taking him to a calm place. A place where Harry returned the feelings Draco shared with him. A place where it was quiet and peaceful.
Trip to Paris.
Draco pulled away all of a sudden. "What?" Harry looked at him. "That's just a little preview" Draco smirked and released Harry. "More after dinner." Draco licked his bottom lip slowly and wiped his mouth.
"Happy Christmas Mum!" Draco walked over to her and leaned down to hug her. Harry hugged her as well. "Happy Christmas Narcissa" Harry pulled away and sat on one of the arm chairs.
Harry watched Draco pull a basket out from behind a big potted plant and walked back over to Harry. "I wanted to give you a sort of...date." Draco smiled and opened up the basket. He pulled out a black fuzzy blanket, laying it down on the bridge. Harry had an smile on his face, a big cheesy smile plastered on his face.
It had been hard to have any sense of serenity or safety with Voldemort out for him.  With Voldemort out of the way Harry felt free. There was no big bad evil force out to kill him anymore. Knowing that he was safe lifted a very heavy weight off of his shoulders.
"Now go ahead take it, and try to control yourself considering you're going to be in love with me" Draco smirked once more. "Insufferable git" Harry scoffed and chuckled. Draco handed Harry the vial. Harry took it and downed it.
Draco felt a slight blush creep up on his face. "Nope always been this attractive." Draco smiled proudly and wrapped his arms around Harry's waist. His waist wasn't as unhealthily tiny anymore. Harry had meat on his bones, he felt like he was nourished correctly. It made Draco smile.
"I like the way your brain works Barty"  Bellatrix smirked as well. "Well I'll have a cheery time killing that little twit. The poor dark lord, may his soul rest in peace, would want us to do it." Barty said getting up. "We're going to make him so proud" Bellatrix smiled.
He didn't even bother asking how she knew who head boy was because somehow Hermione just knew everything.
Draco had his head laid down on Harry's bed, he was holding Harry's hand against his chest.
Draco wasn't wrong the writing was beautiful. It made Harry feel like he was in the story, like it was happening to him. The writing lifted Harry up and away from the dimly lit library, up into the sky. He was drifting through the beautiful words on the pages. Everything was heartfelt, and painful.
"You'll see" Harry smiled mischievously. "Have her close her eyes" Draco yelled from the doorway, struggling to hold something behind his back. Narcissa closed her eyes and Draco walked over.
"What the bloody hell was that for 'Mione you smiled! you were being oddly nice?" Ron said shaking free from her grip. "I have a theory about this whole Draco being considerate all of a sudden thing." Hermione said smiling and making her way to the library.
Draco finally calmed down after exactly 64 steps. It usually always took just 64 steps. He crawled back into bed and snuggled the covers. Draco was a softie at heart but would never show that, that's what made him weak.
Snape, Lupin, and Draco followed him in. His old home was huge, it had so many doors and pathways. Harry could be anywhere. Yet Draco knew his father would throw him in the dungeon. Draco's father was cruel and malicious, but rather dumb. "This way." Draco said and lead them towards a sort of main room that everything was set around.
"Come on boys let me show you around" She clapped her hands smiling and took them around the main room, then into another door. They were both speechless once again.
"Of course, I don't mind at all" Draco smiled and nodded. Harry became his normal giddy self again. "Oh thank you, thank you, thank you" Harry said smiling.
"I have to go, I have to go see if he's ok" Draco sniffled. "You cannot fly like this Draco" Ron said. "I'll fly, he can come on the back" Narcissa stood up and cleared her throat.
"Vernon the freak is home" She yelled. Harry felt a feeling of panic sink in. Harry tried to keep his mind in a headspace of Draco. He tried to remember what Draco had said, how he was so strong. Harry didn't feel very strong at all. His uncle came into the room. "Why hello there fag." His uncle spat at him. Harry flinched and shook slightly. "What scared of your uncle?" Vernon made his way over to Harry.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck and stared around the room, trying to make sure he wasn't crazy or dreaming.
"I must have a talk with her tomorrow" He smiled and got into bed as well. "So you do know her?" Harry adjusted his position. "Yes, I've known that twit since 1st year. She's one of my very best friends" Draco yawned.
Harry squealed out of pure excitement sort of like a little girl, no matter to how bad it hurt. Draco had called him love. That simple word made Harry's heart rate shoot up and into the sky.
Narcissa grabbed her wand as well and walked over, standing next to Harry and Draco.
"I love you" Harry said softly. "I love you too" Draco smiled and kissed Harry's temple.
"Steak sounds delicious." Harry smiled, his mouth watering at the thought of it. "Okay then we'll do steak." Draco smiled and looked over at the clock.
"Happy Christmas Mum!" Draco walked over to her and leaned down to hug her. Harry hugged her as well. "Happy Christmas Narcissa" Harry pulled away and sat on one of the arm chairs.
Draco pushed the bad thoughts into a file in his brain. The file being buried deep in the depths of his brain. He looked down to see Harry in his arms, and that made everything, all those thoughts and worry go away.
Harry's moans slowly quieted and Draco's hips slowly calmed down. He pulled out and flopped down next to Harry. Draco rolled the condom off, tied it, and tossed it somewhere.
Harry began trembling, his whole body set into a fit of shivering. Draco pulled Harry closer to him and slowly backed away. "Wh- what are you doing here?" Draco said, trying to sound stern and unafraid. "Bella didn't tell you?" Barty smirked.
Hermione and Ron smiled. "We'll be on our way" Ron knew when to leave, and now was that time. He took Hermione and left.
Draco could barely control himself. He wanted to take Harry right then and there. Draco mentally slapped himself. He refused to let himself fall prey to Harry Potter. Draco got back into his bed and pulled the covers up over his shoulder. He slowly dozed off thinking of Harry's emerald eyes.
Snape had managed to sneak back to the dungeons. "Alohomora" He said softly to the locks. They clicked open. Lucius was too busy scolding his son.
He couldn't get the thought of Draco out his mind. Then again, he never could. He would always tell himself it was hatred and anger. Because Harry was straight. Right?  Harry also felt as if he had forgotten to do something. He shrugged it off, Harry was much too tired to care. He slowly fell asleep with the thought of Draco's stormy eyes in his head.
"I'm a freak according to my family, I don't deserve to be breathing, I'm a disappointment, I'm the reason my family died, I'm the reason I don't deserve love." Draco felt tears well in his eyes, but he was also happy, Harry had never been so vulnerable. Harry trusted Draco.
"Potter" Draco whispered while grabbing Harry's shoulders to softly shake him. "Potter come on wake up." He said a little louder. Harry pulled Draco down onto his bed and intertwined their legs. Draco just stared down at him in complete and utter shock. Harry had stopped whimpering and was now a little more calm. His breathing seemed to even out. Draco was stiff, he couldn't necessarily move. He took a moment just a quick little moment to enjoy holding Harry. He took a moment to understand what Harry in his arms felt like.
Draco didn't know what was holding him back. Although the little voice in his head did. It hissed at him "You're not good enough for Harry, you never will be" Draco winced at hearing these things from his own subconscious. "He will never love you" It hissed.
They arrived at Hogwarts and rushed inside. It was day time now, early morning. The students who were going about their day stared at them oddly. It was quite a weird scene to behold. Draco was covered in blood, Hermione and Ron also had a bit of blood on them. Narcissa also. Two Gryffindor's, a snake and his mum. Draco wouldn't have believed this happened if it wasn't happening to him.
Finally.
It took Harry exactly 64 steps to calm down.
"Right" Harry smiled and looked to Ron and Hermione.
"But you're aware that we'll probably get more threats right?" Draco ran his hand through Harry's soft raven hair. Harry nodded. "Draco when your by my side none of that matters. It's like I can do or be anything I want and I'm not scared to." Harry smiled and turned his attention up to the ceiling. As if he was caught in a daydream.
Harry fell asleep, a deep sleep as always. Harry let himself be vulnerable, and with his enemy none the less. He moved around in his bed, not dreaming of anything. His mind was quiet for once. It made him happy.
"Well, no but I advise you go home this weekend and talk with them. They expect you to stay until Sunday night." Dumbledore kept calm. Harry was now sure he was about to pass out. Draco was watching Harry to make sure he didn't pass out. "Would you mind we talk about this more tomorrow sir I'm tired" Harry said looking down. Dumbledore nodded and made his way out of the dorm. "Just for the weekend" Dumbledore said as he passed Harry.
They just laid there with no speaking. No anything, just holding one another.
Draco put nice smelling bath salts into the tub, along with bubbles. "Harry darling come on" Draco said out into the bedroom. Harry could hear Ron and Hermione having a conversation, it made him happy to know his friends wanted to stay.
"Oh Harry Potter?" Myrtle said giggling. "Yes why?" Draco looked at her.
Yours Truly,
Harry set his hand on Draco's shoulder, encouraging him to keep talking. Draco took a quick glance down to Harry's hand. "But I was scared, i was scared to tell you i'm an idiot i hurt you and i never intended to, i'm so so sorry Harry, i never meant for anything. I'm so stupid and weak i know i'm a cowar-" Draco was rambling at this point. Nervous once more.  Draco hated but loved how sensitive and open he was now.
"Harry, I love you and I can't imagine my life without you. I want to keep you happy for as long as you'll let me. So, Harry James Potter. Will you make me the luckiest and happiest man in the world and marry me?" Draco smiled brightly, his smile from ear to ear.
"Okay daddy." He said as he rubbed his tired eyes. "Let's get you dressed okay?" Draco set the boy down on the floor and went to rummage through the formal outfits they had bought for him. "This one." Draco pulled out a cute little suit. "Come here james" Draco called him over.
Draco and Harry made their way back to the dorm. Laughing and chatting on the way back. They entered the dorm and sighed. They both stayed in the door way when they saw the good old headmaster sitting on their couch.
"So, while you were still out. I went to go eat lunch because your best friends insisted I do. They promised to watch you." Draco said. Harry was staring at him intently. "While I was eating Dumbledore said someone needed to be thanked for saving the school from an threat. He called me up and I basically told everyone were friends. See that's all" Draco smiled and looked down at Harry.
Harry looked back to his own table and started listening to what Snape was talking about. "...working with amorentia" Snape said in his normal monotone voice. Harry looked over at Draco once more, Draco was staring right back.
"Please" Harry said in a slight whisper. Draco began to palm Harry through his underwear. Harry moaned with much satisfaction.
"Well then I guess we should go get some good rest then right?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry nodded. "I'll see the both of you tomorrow, sleep well" Narcissa waved and turned her attention back to Snape. Draco and harry exited the room and walked out into the hallway.
Bellatrix had become a very close person to Harry. She gave him advice, she joked with him, and she was there for him. Harry and her had began to become friends, very good friends. He trusted her, he believed she was truly a changed woman.
"Well he came in here earlier looking rather scared. Then someone came in behind him it was the boy you mentioned" Myrtle floated around the bathroom. "Zabini?" Draco looked at her inquisitively.
He got up and let his feet hit the cold floor. It sent a shiver from his feet up. Draco made his way to his door and opened it. He walked across the dark common room and opened Harry's door slowly.
"Oh Blaise hello it's been so long since I've seen you!" Narcissa smiled and hugged Blaise. Blaise hugged back. "It's great to see you too Narcissa." Blaise smiled. "It's great to meet the rest of you, well you two formally" Narcissa smiled looking at Ron and Hermione. "But you, It's nice to meet you" Narcissa took Neville's hand and shook. Neville smiled sheepishly and shook hers.
Draco shot up and wiped his forehead. There were tears running down his cheeks which he quickly wiped away. It was just a dream. Harry wouldn't be dead soon, Harry wouldn't be going anywhere.
Draco's ears began ringing. "You can't die.."Draco's voice came out a whisper, a tiny whisper was all he could manage. "I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you" Draco sobbed into Harry's chest. Harry's chest which now wasn't rising and falling with any breath.
"Who is it?" Draco half shouted. "Mum and your Aunt" His mom shouted back. "Come in" Draco said sounding annoyed. Draco got off of Harry and sat next to him instead. His mother and Aunt Bellatrix entered the room.
"Hey! Come on it's a normal fear" Draco scoffed and started laughing as well. "Right right" Harry smiled and looked up at Draco. Draco could feel Harry's eyes on him, so he looked down to meet Harry's eyes.
Draco and Harry untied the ribbon and pulled the lids off of their boxes. They both smiled instantly. Two silver bracelets, made exactly the same. Except Harry's had D.M. engraved on it while Draco's had H.P. engraved on it. Harry and Draco turned to each other and embraced.
Draco picked Harry up and kissed him roughly. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco's torso. Harry's arms fell around Draco's neck. Draco still had Harry up against the wall. Draco caught Harry's bottom lip between his teeth and nibbled on it. Draco kissed down over to Harry's earlobe. "You're such a tease" Draco whispered into Harry's ear and softly sucked on his earlobe.
Another person caught up with them. Harry rolled his eyes.
"Tell me your biggest dream" Draco said as he ate his sandwich. "Hmm ok" Harry paused to swallow the rest of his food. "It's cheesy but, my biggest dream is to see the Eiffel tower. Just see it with someone I love." Harry smiled and took a swig of his champagne.
Although he really didn't have to tell Draco anything. Draco scoffed and went over to him, taking a seat next him. Hermione and Ron both snapped their heads to look at him. "Malfoy." Harry said starting down at his plate.
"I can't either. This is a dream." Draco said as they approached the tower.
Harry and Draco were sharing the same thought. The thought of how much it reminded them of the two of them when they were just getting started. "Well our break has been very fun so far isn't that right Harry?" Draco smirked.
Draco's eyebrows furrowed.
Draco kissed Harry's forehead and moved a piece of hair off of it. "Wake up we have classes today" Draco whispered softly. Harry grumbled and whispered back. "No..5 more minutes" Draco chuckled softly and removed his arms from Harry slowly getting up. "You can have 5 more minutes Im going to get dressed" Draco smiled and grabbed his robes, he walked into the bathroom.
Harry tried to push the thoughts out of his mind so he could actually get some rest. Harry just wished things were different, so different.
Harry looked down at his feet not knowing what else to do. Draco was looking at Dumbledore waiting for the next idiotic thing that would come out of his mouth. "Well come on boys let me show you to your new housing" He smiled and got up walking in front of us, expecting us to follow. Harry started walking but Draco cut him off. "I will always walk in front of you, I will always be on top of you," Draco spat at him and followed Dumbledore through the many twists and turns of Hogwarts until they finally reached their dorm. It was in a secluded part of the building.
Harry smiled and scampered away into his room. Draco chuckled and turned around walking into his. Draco changed into his silk green pajamas. He fixed his hair and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
"Oh my god! Can you believe Blaise and Neville did that?!" Harry said sounding completely confused and astonished. "No I really cannot, that went way better than we could've expected"  Draco took his tie off and hung it up.
Draco stopped in front of Harry's door when heard Harry mumble a spell. The silencing charm.
"It took pretty damn long" Draco replied. "Let's get a drink or two and head back" Draco said. Ron looked at him. "Why are you in such a rush mate? Harry won't be back until Sunday" He said.
This was their last day without classes. Tomorrow they would go back to their regular schedules. He wanted today to be a day for just the two of them. Draco didn't want the anger. Draco wanted peace and calm and passion.
Draco had moved over to sit next to his door so he could hear what was going on outside better. He heard Harry's door open and the bathroom door shut. Draco sat there holding his breath waiting for something to happen. Draco couldn't stop thinking about the cuts and the bruises.
Draco was overwhelmingly sad. He didn't want anything to happen to Harry. Draco knew Harry was strong but not that strong.
"I didn't mean to startle you, I was out for a stroll. I didn't think anyone else would be out here"  The girl said sincerely.
Harry finished washing all of the dishes somehow. "May I be excused to my room" Harry said shakily. "Fine, you will be making breakfast tomorrow." His uncle dismissed him. Harry took his trunk and walked into the room under the stairs. He shut and latched the door. Harry flopped down onto the cot that was his bed. He cried. Harry sobbed, he felt weak. His side hurt more than he could even handle. Harry was trying to remember a numbing spell but nothing was coming to mind. Harry gasped for air and reached for his trunk. He opened it and sifted around for Draco's sweatshirt.
"For..attacking you, and waking you again" Harry chuckled a little, as did Draco. "It's alright Potter" Draco said. "Why are you in here?" Harry looked up at Draco. Draco rubbed the back of his neck. "I also had..a erm..nightmare" Draco mumbled under his breath. "What was that Malfoy?" Harry said. "I had a nightmare as well" Draco said sternly. "Oh about?" Harry looked up at him.
Dumbledore was no help either. The Headmaster of this great establishment, wasn't as great as Hogwarts itself was. Harry could never fully grasp how a school so majestic and beautiful could be lead by such an incompetent man.
"If you don't mind, don't scare me anymore with your appearances in my bedroom. It's odd and quite nerve wracking to know you're probably just watching me sleep." Draco huffed. "Why in the bloody hell would I want to watch you sleep?" Harry rubbed his eyes. "And where are my glasses?" Harry felt his eyes once more to make sure his glasses weren't on his face.
"Aw look at that Malfoy does have a heart." Hermione said sarcastically. "No..my room smelled funny, I was going to let him keep going but I needed to stay out of my room." Draco tried to sound as convincing as possible. Draco had always been an excellent liar, but he really wasn't in this moment.
Harry was standing there staring down at Draco. Harry now most definitely knew what was going on. "You're a monster! That's your son!" Harry shouted at him. "No son of mine would ever be gay." Lucius responded. "Come along Harry. I want to take you somewhere" Lucius grabbed Harry's arm. Harry tried to jerk his arm free. Lucius just tightened his grip.
"Draco, hello" Blaise smiled and wrapped his arm around Harry's waist. Harry didn't flinch or try to remove it. Draco's eyebrows furrowed. "Harry are you alright?" He got closer to Harry. "Of course I am why wouldn't I be Malfoy?" Harry smiled cluelessly, kind of like an airhead.  Draco shook it off.
Harry cringed at the sight of him. "Yes Headmaster?" Draco spoke up. "Oh boys hello there" Dumbledore got up and smiled cheerfully walking towards them. "What is it you wanted sir?" Harry made eye contact with him. "Harry I wanted to have a quick chat" Dumbledore kept a smile on his face.
Harry went to the bathroom to freshen up. He looked in the mirror, he had dark bags under his eyes. His whole face was pale, well paler than usual. Harry sighed and began to brush his teeth.
"If you leave now, I will not tell headmaster"
"I'm not surprised you did this Potter, it doesn't shock me at all. But after everything I was expecting different, that's my fault for thinking you could change" Draco spat at him.
"See Son I told you, worthless" His father said into Draco's ear.
"Bye Harry" Draco whispered against his lips. "Bye Dray" Harry said back. They pulled back. "Ready?" Snape looked at Harry. "Yes sir" Harry nodded. "Check my bedroom" Harry smiled at Draco and apparated out of the room. He was actually gone. Draco sighed and a nervous knot formed in the pit of his stomach. He must've looked sick because Snape noticed. "He'll be fine, whether or not I want to admit it. That Potter boy is very strong" Snape said to Draco.
Harry shook his head and continued breathing unsteadily. He was having one of his anxiety fits. He was all of a sudden very aware of how unsteady his breathing was and how much he was shaking. "Ok my mum told me this whenI was just a boy. Take eight steps, count eight items, and breathe as you do. Just concentrate on that number" Draco held Harry's arm. Harry nodded and began pacing. Only 8 steps.
Draco took the hint and unbuttoned, then unzipped Harry's pants slowly. Harry let out a soft moan when the material of his pants rubbed against him. Draco continued to kiss Harry's soft, swollen lips. Draco slowly palmed Harry from on top of his boxers. Harry moaned and squeezed his eyes shut. "Please stop teasing" Harry whimpered. Draco slid his hand under the waist band of Harry's boxers. Harry let out a quiet subtle moan. Draco laid his head next to Harry's and placed soft kisses on his neck, then sucking up to his earlobe.
Draco laid there looking up at the ceiling. No matter how hard he hoped Harry was safe, he knew he wasn't. Draco could feel Harry's unhappiness. It hurt him so bad.
"I lo-" Harry was cut off by the sound of the portrait opening rather aggressively. It sounded as if the portrait had actually been broken somehow. Like someone wasn't allowed access in, but came in anyway.
Draco didn't care, he shoved through all of the grossed out students until he made it to the hospital wing. Snape was standing outside. "How is he?" Draco sniffled and stared at Snape.
Harry took a deep breath and slid his shoes on. He grabbed a piece of parchment and a quill, he left a note in case Draco woke up. 'Out for a stroll on the grounds, needed some fresh air' it read.
Draco hugged Harry tighter than he ever had before, he was trying to make sure he hadn't been dreaming. He wanted to be sure Harry was really there with him. "What the hell happened?" Ron said from behind them, his mouth agape.
"Yeah mate sounds great." Draco smiled and lead them to the door. Harry followed. "It's been lovely. Bye you two" Neville smiled and walked out into the cold air. Blaise followed him.
He looked down at his arm. Draco's hand had slapped against Harry's wrist when he pulled it away so roughly. His wrist ached. Harry started to cry, to be weak. The flood gates opened.
Blaise, Neville, and Pansy had finally arrived. "Draco!" Pansy smiled and hugged Draco. "It's so nice to see all three of you again!" Draco smiled, looking at his friends who all stood before him. "Today's the big day." Neville said with a smile. "We couldn't be happier for you" Blaise smiled and put his arm around Neville's waist.
"How many times you two shagged here?" Ron asked casually. Harry choked on his food, Draco's hand shot to Harry's back out of reflex to help. Harry finally caught his breath. Hermione was laughing quietly. "Merlin Ron you have no filter do you?" Harry said. "Nope"
It was around 7 a.m. when Harry awoke again. He wasn't fully aware of his new surroundings, it took him a little to adjust to the new room he was in. The sun had barely started rising yet. He suddenly felt alarmed when he realized he was snuggled up to someone. A strong scent of vanilla flowed into Harry's nose.
Harry was taken aback when he saw what he saw. A garden, a garden full of flowers. There was a small bridge with a stream running underneath it. The metal was black, but it fit the happy garden so nicely. Vines were trailing the railings on the bridge.
Harry shuddered at the memories. "Your friends are gone?" Bellatrix asked politely, warmly, sweetly. "Yes they left a few minutes back." Harry replied with a smile.
Harry looked down when he felt a hand on his knee. He almost immediately relaxed and smiled softly.
Draco's heart dropped at those two words Harry said. He let out a shaky breath, trying to keep his composure for Harry. Harry shook in his arms and sucked in deep hard breaths. Draco held him tighter than he'd ever held anything or anyone. Harry slowly calmed down, he sniffled and hiccuped a few times. Draco inhaled deeply and exhaled slowly, trying to calm himself down.
"You've taken over my damn mind! You're all I think about and it makes me sick to even think about anything bad happening to you! I don't know how the hell you managed to reel me in and just make me feel all these things I've never felt before, but you did. I cannot even begin to imagine my life without you anymore!" Draco sighed and ran his hand through his hair.
He laid Harry down and Harry nodded before Draco had time to ask if it was okay. Draco kissed the corner of his mouth and down his jawline. He saw Harry's marked up neck, both sides. He looked up at Harry with a look of hesitation. Harry nodded and started unbuttoning his shirt. He was still insecure, but he trusted Draco wouldn't judge.
Draco got up and grabbed his wand. "I'm going to do it" He wiped his eyes and nose. "Are you sure?" Narcissa looked at him. Draco nodded. "I hate you." Draco said down to his father.
broken.
"I got the best tickets money could buy. We're flying first class" He said to Harry.
"Let's go pack alright?" Draco said softly into Harry's ear. Harry nodded and skipped away into his room. "I'm so excited Dray" Harry beamed and began packing his trunk. Draco followed Harry into his room. Draco flopped down onto Harry's bed and watched him pack.
Harry had never given up a fight, no matter the circumstances. He wouldn't give up now. Harry wouldn't give up Draco, he wouldn't give up the life they've made. Harry wouldn't give up their future plans, Paris, the home in the countryside.
Harry nodded. "Hurry back." Harry kissed Draco's cheek. Draco got up and put his shoes back on. "I'll be back" He smiled and walked out of the room. Harry laid there in the deafening silence. The silence that let his mind wander. Harry's eyes explored down to his covered wrist.
"When Ron asked me mine I knew he was the one. It's just so special for some reason." She kisses Ron's cheek. Harry smiled and returned his attention back to his food.
Harry began to stir. Draco stared at him and sat down, taking Harry's soft small hand in his. "Harry?" Draco mumbled into Harry's ear. Harry's eyes cracked open. Draco was overjoyed when he saw his love's eyes open up. "Thank Merlin" Draco hugged him softly, making sure to not hurt him.
"Well I'm gonna go. I'll let you two get back to being all cute" Blaise smiled and got up. Draco smiled as well. "Thank you for being so mature." Draco smiled.
Harry was angry. Draco was angry. Both angry at the one another for stupid reasons.
Would he have his own dorm?
"Who did?" Draco said back into Harry's ear.
"Where's Harry we wanted to check on him?" Hermione said and made her way to the couch. Ron day next to her and wrapped his arm around her.
"I'm just not hungry is all." Harry said somberly looking down at his plate. "But you haven't eaten since yesterday evening at the feast." Draco said looking at Harry. "I'm not hungry Malfoy." Harry said getting angry.
"Of course" Blaise smiled. "Thank you both again. This means the world to me" Blaise said getting up. "No problem mate" Harry smiled and scooted back over to Draco. Blaise walked back to Slytherin table, passing Neville on the way. "Hey Neville" Blaise said nonchalantly. Neville's cheeks heated up and he struggled to get words out of his mouth. "Hi" He managed.
Harry had a bright idea, a risky idea, a brave idea. He was Gryffindor so of course he went through with it. Harry turned back to Slytherin table where Draco was. Draco was now turned to face Harry again. Ron and Hermione were indulged in their own conversation. Harry smirked and slowly licked each one of his fingers. Harry almost instantly regretted it but saw Draco's reaction and was happy he had done it.
"He knows how they treat you and he tells you to 'stick it out' What the bloody hell?!" Draco wanted to punch Dumbledore straight in the face. Draco was pacing now. Pacing like a worried mother. "What was that bloody moron telling you to remember?" Draco asked. "To remember...that- that I can't make bonds, especially with a Slytherin, it's more people to die for me. Dumbledore thinks I should be alone, so no one else will get hurt but me" Harry managed to say that in a hushed tone.
"It's only for two days, I promise I'll be here when you get back." Draco smiled. Harry sighed. "You know what? Hold on" Draco got up and trekked over to his room. Harry sat up and cocked his head trying to see into Draco's room. Draco came back with a sweatshirt. It was a plain grey sweatshirt. Although the sweatshirt didn't lack character, it had Draco's scent. Harry could smell it right from when Draco stepped into his room.
"Why?" Draco looked down at him while walking. "What do you mean why? It's break dummy" Harry chuckled. "So? We could have them all for dinner at the manor." Draco said and turned into the hall. "Really?" Harry waved at his friends and walked over there. "Yeah really, we could do a dinner or something?" Draco suggested and Harry nodded.
"Oh your friends left?" Narcissa said as she came back into the room. "Yes they had plans mum" Draco said and made a ball of the wrapping paper. "Oh okay, we'll then how about we-" Narcissa was cut off by Bellatrix entering the room. She was wearing the outfit she wore at the battle.
Draco wore an all black suit, black tie, and black shoes. His eyes were puffy and bloodshot. He hadn't stopped crying, every night he would get into bed hoping Harry would be whining for more cuddles. He never was. It was always just silence. Deafening silence. Draco would wake up from his two hours of sleep and hope to see Harry's smiling face staring at him.
"For the first time too it seems. Congrats" Hermione giggled and held Ron's hand. Ron was still, completely mortified. Harry was also mortified.
"What are you doing psycho this is my shower you'll take up all the water." Harry complained. Harry's eyes fell across Draco's body. Scenarios still actively running through his brain. Draco roughly put his hands on Harry's hips and shoved him against the cold shower wall. Harry  gasped slightly and laid his head back.
"Oh Draco hello" Myrtle flew out of a stall and sat on a sink. "Yes hello Myrtle" Draco said politely. "You never visit me anymore I get so lonely" Myrtle floated over to Draco. "I'm sorry Myrtle" Draco looked at her.
Draco pulled away slowly and opened his eyes. He saw Harry staring at him with a goofy smile. Harry's cheeks were flushed, as always. Draco sat up, and sat Harry up as well. Their hands were still intertwined. Harry sat there with a smile on his face. He felt..calm.
"You three make me sick." Draco spat out and crossed his arms. "Good to know" Harry smirked triumphantly, attempting to make Draco angry. Attempting to make himself appear confident. It seemed to work because Draco simply turned on his heel walking towards Dumbledore.
Harry followed him. "I never said you don't but I just want to know if you really want me to." Harry put his hand on the counter and looked up at Draco. Draco spit out his toothpaste before he began talking. "Of course I want you to love. Where is this coming from?" Draco turned to face Harry.
"What? Oh we must alert the headmaster and any other professor that may be of use." Snape went into his room and put his robes on rather quickly. If the situation wasn't so serious Draco would've been impressed. "We will get him back Draco." Snape said and rubbed his godson's back. Draco wiped his eyes and tried to catch his breath. "We must" Draco said softly.
Snape gave a lecture on amorentia, the dangers of it, and how to use it. Harry was barely listening as always. Snape instructed them to make amorentia, a short term one, and test it on their table partner. Everyone got to work. Harry turned to face Draco. "I'll try it, you make it I really don't do good with potions" Draco smiled. "You sure you want to take it?" Draco asked.
"Yeah" Neville said, his cheeks red as a tomato. Neville walked in and rubbed the back of his head. Everyone could tell he was a nervous wreck. "Blaise it's wonderful to see you again" Harry shook his hand and Draco did the same.
Harry bit his lip and tilted his head. "God I missed this" Harry said breathily.
"Good I'm glad you're so happy Harry" Hermione smiled. "And this manor is truly striking. It's amazing." Hermione said.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck. Draco kissed Harry slowly, yet roughly. A spark lit in Draco's heart every time their lips would connect. Draco slowly ran his right hand out of Harry's hair and down to his petite waist. Draco untucked Harry's shirt and slowly ran his hand up Harry's shirt. Harry shivered.
"It's going fine Louis" Draco smiled a little. "Shagged yet?" Louis asked. Draco almost choked on his saliva. "What kind of man do you take me for Tomlinson?" Draco narrowed his eyes and smirked. "Right right the well respected Draco Malfoy would never" Louis rolled his eyes.
Draco narrowed his eyes and made a rude gesture with his hand. Harry rolled his eyes and turned back to his friends. Draco continued walking.
"I now pronounce you husband and husband. You may now kiss the groom" The man officiating the wedding said.
"Good morning!" Bellatrix came into the room and waved hello to everyone. Harry smiled at her, then noticed she had her wand tucked into her pocket. He found it odd, but let it slide. Maybe she was ready to defend them against an intruder or something.
He took a moment to think back to his wedding as his husband chased their child throughout their bedroom with the cutest and tiniest jacket Harry had ever seen.
Dumbledore finally spoke again and everyone looked up and silenced. "I will now be announcing this year's head boy and girl." There was a pause so everyone could cheer for the headmaster. Dumbledore bowed his head graciously and adjusted his glasses.
Draco's heart fluttered. Although he was also worried sick. He dropped his eyes to Harry who had fallen asleep surprisingly quickly. Draco smiled. If Harry went home to his family, Draco was afraid he might re-start his bad habit. He wanted to do anything he could to keep Harry safe, happy, and satisfied. Draco's mind was buzzing with awful thoughts. All of the loud voices overlapping each other. It gave him a headache.
Draco was so angry and sad. He didn't know what to do. He was crying and hadn't even realized it. "Sev...sev he'll know what to do" Draco sniffled and slid his shoes on before making his way out into the hallway. He stumbled through the hallways and knocked on the door to Snape's classroom. Draco knew he slept in some hidden room in there.
"Really? I think I will" His father took a few steps closer to the door. "Go away now." Draco sternly said. Lucius just shook his head.
"You've seen things I never intended for anyone to see. You know things I never wanted anyone to know." Draco hung onto every word Harry said. "I feel that since you know some of it, you might as well know all of it" Harry sighed.
Draco pulled away just a little. Harry looked at Draco, confused now. Draco looked over to the tear running down Harry's face. Draco kissed it away and placed his lips on Harry's again. Harry smiled and kissed back. There was no tongue, no burning passion. It was a sweet kiss.   Draco spoke softly against Harry's lips.
Only an inch of space was separating them at this point. Harry's arms were now around Draco's neck, softly tangling his hand in Draco's platinum blonde hair. Draco moved his hand to Harry's cheek where he softly caressed it with his thumb. Harry's heart was beating rapidly.
Draco smoothly turned around and walked to his bedroom. Draco sat down on his bed and smoothed the covers. Draco had wished things were different. He didn't like being rude to Harry. He just didn't know how to deal with his feelings. Draco had always had this yearn for Harry. He never could bring himself to do anything about it. He knew he would be rejected.
"It's quite crazy how everything played out." Draco yawned and caressed Harry's arm softly. "I would've never imagined to be laying here with you, no matter how bad I wanted it I could never imagine it actually happening" Draco chuckled.
All he could remember was the searing pain he had felt on his back for the next week. He could remember the sound of the belt against his skin and his uncle screaming so vividly.
"Obviously you've seen some things, on me, that seem to define me" Harry fiddled with his shirt's corner. Draco got comfortable on the couch as he stared at Harry intently. "But they aren't me, they are just my exterior, and yes it looks bad it also feels bad" Harry paused for one of many shaky breaths he would take during this conversation.
Scars to remind him of how weak he is.
"c'm here" Draco said softly, his voice raspy. Harry moved himself up next to Draco. Draco looked at him and ran his hand along Harry's neck. "it was amazing" Harry smiled. Draco kissed Harry's forehead softly. "I'm gonna go shower i'll be back alright?" Draco said. Harry nodded. Draco smiled, grabbed some fresh clothes and walked away into the common room.
"Darling I'm tired and cold" Harry said and flopped down onto the bed in his suit. "I'll draw you a bath alright?" Draco smiled and removed his shirt, then pants. Only to put on pajamas.
Warnings: abuse, suicidal actions, smut, molestation, homophobia, ED, and talk of killing oneself
Draco fell to the floor, sobbing. "No! No! No! No!" Draco pounded his fist on the ground, he pulled Harry's heavy and limp body onto his lap.
Draco chuckled and sat down as well running his hand over the smooth silk pillowcase. "Can we talk?" Draco kept his eyes on the pillowcase. "We're talking now aren't we?" Harry watched Draco's hand caress the pillowcase. "No idiot, i mean talk talk" Draco's hand halted in the center of the pillowcase. "Yes of course" Harry kept his eyes on Draco's hand.
"I could easily make you beg. I could have you gasping for air, moaning uncontrollably, feeling the pleasure running through your body. You'd be putty in my hands." Draco licked his lips. Harry was now silent, he was distracted by the scenarios being created in his mind. Draco smirked and took off his boxers, stepping in the shower.
Harry felt his heart warm, Draco held Harry's hands at his sides. Draco kissed down to the next bruise. He didn't stop until he had kissed all of them. Mumbling sweet things in between soft kisses. Draco held Harry's hands and kissed back up to his lips. He placed a soft kiss on the corner of Harry's mouth.
The fights began to collide, Harry, Draco, and Narcissa against the other two. "Stupefy!" Narcissa yelled pointing her wand at Barty, for some reason he didn't deflect it, or even try to. It hit him and he fell unconscious.
"Uh..excuse me sir what are you doing?" Harry spoke up, knowing Dumbledore idolized him. "Just having a little check in..What have you boys been up to?" A playful smirk formed on Dumbledores face. "We were out on a stroll." Draco said normally.
"Lucius Malfoy" Snape said and brushed a piece of dark black hair off of his face. "I have reason to believe he has come to try and kill Harry. To finish what the Dark Lord started." Snape looked down at Draco. "Lucius was always a heavy follower of Voldemort. I wouldn't doubt for a second that he would want to finish his master's dirty little deed."
"Dray it's alright. What's your favor Blaise?" Harry used Blaise's first name because he trusted him. Harry can read people, Blaise had his guard down. Blaise was being genuine and sensitive. It kind of shocked Harry.
"Draco?" Harry was now becoming increasingly frantic. "Draco?!" Harry ran around the dorm looking for him. His vision became blurred from tears welling up in his eyes. They had just gotten each other back, now they were apart again.
(a tiny bit of smut for you all :)
For when you begin missing me. Hold it, smell it, perform a ritual I don't know. I bet you laughed at that. I miss you already. I have barely any time to write this, so I want you to know I'm fine. Please don't worry too much. I'm strong remember?
"They're great, it's always pleasant seeing them" It pained him to lie to his friends but he would never want them to worry. Harry would never want to put his feelings before anyone else's. If he could hide the bad parts of his life from everyone forever, he would.
Draco knocked again, growing impatient. He heard someone walking up the door. It opened to reveal Snape in his nightwear.
————-
"It's okay love, sh sh." She hugged him. Draco sobbed. They walked out of the door and into the car that had come to take them to the service.
Harry was surprised to see Draco's mother standing in the room as well. "Harry, love hello" Narcissa smiled at him lovingly and pulled him into a warm embrace. "Hi Ms. Malfoy" Harry smiled as he hugged the nice woman.
"Yes Barty I have." She mumbled, annoyed. "But it's not time yet, I need to gain a little more it's only been a day" She searched around her room for her wand. "Looking for this?" Barty pulled her wand out of his pocket. His tongue flicking out of his mouth, an ugly habit he had. She rolled her eyes and took it. "Barty Crouch Jr. I will let this plan fall through if you continue to be a miscreant you bloke" Bellatrix sat down on her bed.
Harry got close to Draco's ear and whispered. "But we're still sleeping in mine" Harry smiled. Draco rolled his eyes and chuckled. "Fine, but just tonight and then we're back in here" Draco looked down at Harry. "Yeah we'll see about that" Harry smirked and got up. Harry stretched. "Hey classes are over and, well I have somewhere else I want to take you" Draco looked at him.
"Blah blah blah" Bellatrix rolled her eyes and laughed hysterically. "What's so funny?" Harry asked her. "Nothing, nothing at all" She smiled.
Harry stood there not moving, breathing, or doing anything. He saw a hand reach under the cloak and pull it off. Harry didn't want to see who he was in trouble with. He didn't want to see who had caught him.
It had taken five months to plan out every detail until everything was finally perfect enough for the both of them.
"You started it" Draco chuckled and pulled Harry into a dark corner of the hallway. Before Harry could protest Draco had his arms around Harry's waist. Harry was at a loss for words. Draco was softly caressing Harry's hips. "I wonder what else that pretty little mouth of yours can do" He looked around to make sure no one was looking. Once he was sure there were no eyes on them, Draco slowly and softly kissed him. Harry melted once more and felt his knees go weak. Harry kissed Draco back.
Pansy went out into the hall and waited for someone to accompany her. "Finally took you long enough" A voice said approaching her. "What's the deal with Malfoy?" the girl said. "I don't know he said nothings happening anymore and Potter isn't at breakfast" Pansy said. "You really think I didn't notice. He's my best friend" The girl said.
Draco couldn't breathe, he couldn't speak, he could only cry. Cry like the coward he was.
"Yes a gay bottom" Harry let out a deep breath. Harry's lips were throbbing. He ran his index finger along his neck. "So I was right, I always am" Draco fixed his hair and smirked. "Oh shut up" Harry rolled his eyes. Draco just smirked and watched Harry's finger run along his own neck.
Draco only packed things he felt he needed to bring, he knew his closet at home was packed full of clothing and shoes. His mother had a tendency of buying anything she liked. He put his trunk on the floor next to his wardrobe and wandered back into Harry's room. Harry was lugging his trunk to the common room.
"You boys look dashing. Harry you clean up nice" Narcissa smiled and took her seat. "Aunt Bella was just telling us how you two were troublemakers" Draco smiled and dug into his food, they all did.
Harry nodded and drifted off to a place of serenity and safety. Draco smiled as Harry fell asleep. He removed Harry's glasses and put them on the coffee table. "I love you darling" Draco kissed Harry's temple and continued to play with his soft dark hair.
Draco had already taken his seat. Blaise smirked devilishly and pulled Harry over to Slytherin table. They sat down next to Draco who seemed to be enjoying his food. "Oh hello Harry...and Zabini?" Draco looked at them.
Draco placed a soft small kiss on Harry's lips. They pulled away a tiny bit, leaving a few centimeters of space between their faces. Harry and Draco gazed into each other's eyes for a splits second before they began hungrily kissing each other. They had both missed each other's touch so very badly.
Draco lead Harry outside, and down a concrete path. Harry looked around at the tall beautiful trees, lined up in a row. "It's beautiful out here" Harry said as he gazed up at the sky. "Just you wait" Draco smirked and opened a gate. Harry followed.
"Do you feel any different?" Snape asked looking down at Draco. Draco shook his head just as Harry had. "Hm" Snape said. Draco shook his head. "I did everything right" Snape studied the potion Draco had made. "Yes, yes you did do everything right Draco." Snape smiled at him. An actual smile. Severus Snape's face actually managed a smile.
"Boys?" They heard a voice speak up. Draco and Harry jumped back from each other, hitting both of the little walls on either side of the nook. Harry fixed his glasses and looked at the woman standing there. "Excuse us Madam Hooch, we were just exploring on our last day off" Harry said smoothly. Madam Hooch raised a suspicious eyebrow. Draco kept a calm expression.
Hermione and Ron were going to help him get ready.
"What are you doing here?" Ron asked him. Hermione looked at Draco with a very perplexed look. "Wait wheres Harry? Did you hurt him? I swear to merlin I will ki-" Hermione was cut off by Draco. "God no I didn't hurt him" Draco said offended, but coldly as if he didn't care. Hermione straightened her skirt and cleared her throat.
Draco reached his hand out and softly touched Harry's knee. Draco wanted to see the bruises. He wanted to make Harry feel beautiful. Draco knew he could make him feel beautiful because he was. "Why not?" Draco said, his voice softer still with a little edge.
Draco wanted to stop Harry, but couldn't. He loved the feeling of Harry's lips on him. Harry did just as Draco had. He slowly sucked down Draco's neck. Draco let out a soft breathy moan and Harry smiled knowing he was doing it right. Draco still had Harry up against the wall.
They made their way downstairs, passing Bellatrix on the way. They smiled to her and continued to the main room. Narcissa was already in there, sitting on the couch. She seemed to be waiting for them.
Draco sniffled and took another look down to Harry. "You really like him don't you?" Hermione said softly as she watched Draco's gaze fall back down to Harry.
He looked back at Draco, who was staring right back at him. Draco smiled and turned back to his food. It's like they had an odd connection in their souls. Whenever Harry was looking, Draco was looking. Whenever Draco was looking, Harry was as well. Their souls were bound together, they were made for each other. They fit each other's puzzles most perfectly.
They finally made it to their table and took their seats. "Jesus you two it's like you're celebrities or something" Ron said with a mouthful of food. Harry chuckled and placed a napkin on his lap. "No, no not really" Harry said.
Harry smiled and pulled away from the hug. "This is truly amazing" Harry looked around the room. Another door. He walked in.
The room looked more festive now, a new carpet, couches, a Christmas tree, gifts under it, and decorations everywhere. "The house looks beautiful" Harry said smiling. Draco went over to the tree like a three year old is drawn to one. "He does that every year, goes and checks how many presents are for him" Narcissa giggled and Harry smiled. "He's like a three year old" Harry chuckled and Narcissa agreed.
"Daddy" James pointed at the doorway where Draco stood holding the jacket.
"While we have time I want to show you something." Draco said and began leading Harry out of the door. Harry followed with his eyebrows knitted. "Good morning Mum, I'm taking Harry to the back" Draco said and waved to his mother. "Good morning Narcissa" Harry smiled politely. "Good morning boys, have fun." Narcissa said smiling as well.
Draco looked back over at Harry who was now on the complete opposite side of the bed. Draco needed to kiss, to touch Harry. He needed that moment back. He also didn't want it to be rushed. "It was an intrusion" Draco said catching Harry's attention.
"Darling! Wake up! Get up!" Harry smiled and jumped on the bed. Draco grumbled and turned on his side. "It's our wedding day! Wake! Up!" Harry threw pillows at him. Draco chuckled and got up, he started jumping as well. Draco and Harry fell back onto the bed laughing.
Blaise sat down and Neville did as well. They sat as far away from each other as they could. Which wasn't saying much considering the couch wasn't very lengthy. "So how was everyones first day of winter break?" Draco said clearing his throat and easing the tension.
"Weaslette" Draco said coldly. Draco being mean made Harry want to laugh. Harry knew Draco wasn't mean, Harry knew Draco was a big softie.
He made his way back into Harry's room. Draco laid back down and stared at the ceiling just thinking.
"Neville!" Harry smiled and hugged him. "You look dashing" Draco smiled and shook Neville's hand.
"It may not be the best time or place." Harry yelled over all of the commotion going on in the room. Draco was staring at Harry who he just noticed now had a shirt on. Lucius must have been so kind to put it back on. Anger bubbled up inside Draco, Lucius touched Harry. Lucius had to carry Harry, put his shirt back on. Draco sniffled slightly and turned his attention back to Harry. "But you must know I lo-" Harry was cut off.
"Christmas can wait another 30 minutes" Draco said groggily, he was barely conscious. "No, no it cannot. Come on Dray I wanna go open gifts" Harry nagged. Draco's eyes completely fluttered open. He smiled when he was met with the cheery face of his love. "Fine love" Draco said and went in to kiss Harry.
Harry eagerly removed Draco's shirt completely. Draco pulled away from Harry and swiftly removed Harry's shirt, popping a few buttons off along the way. "Fuck you're so beautiful" Draco mumbled and sat down on the bed with Harry. Harry straddling Draco's lap. Harry reconnected their lips and ran his hands along Draco's exposed chest. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry securely.
"And what's this?" Harry looked at him. "It's one of my sweatshirts, so when you start missing me, well you know put it on, hold it, perform a ritual I don't know" Draco chuckled. Harry laughed as well and took it. Draco laid back down. "and um..whenever you start to feel..bad again just remember I'm here for you always ok? Just smell the sweatshirt and know that I'm here" Draco said softly. Harry felt tears well up in his eyes and he hugged Draco. "I'm really really going to miss you" Harry whispered into Draco's neck.
Harry awoke the next morning to banging on his door. "Wake up and make me breakfast!" An angry voice yelled. "Y- yes sir" Harry fumbled for his glasses. He took one last inhale of the sweatshirt and put it back in his chest. Harry sighed and made his way out into the kitchen. "Took you long enough I'm starved!" His uncle tripped him on what he would call an 'accident' Harry got back up and limped over to the counter. His shin was now throbbing.
Draco sighed. "Please" Draco never thought he would be saying please to Harry Potter. "No Malfoy" Harry said disgusted. He wasn't really disgusted, he wanted Draco to see and comfort him, but he knew in his mind Draco would probably be rude. Of course there was a hint of doubt in his mind because of earlier's events.
Draco fell to the ground, just as he was about to hit it he woke up.
Harry smiled and walked out behind him. "I'll see you in potions alright? Oh and before lunch" Draco winked at Harry and walked into the Great Hall. Harry followed and walked over to Ron and Hermione who were already in their places.
Harry felt hurt, or embarrassed. "Jeez ok sorry, someones in a mood" He tried to joke. Draco just walked ahead of him out of the portrait. Harry followed him. "It was just a joke what's wrong?" He pulled Draco to the side. Draco refused to make eye contact with him. "Nothings wrong, let go of me" Draco said snagging his arm out of Harry's grip rather harshly.
"He hates when I call him that, he prefers Sev, but I prefer making him annoyed" Draco chuckled and walked back into their dormitory. "Although I've never seen him so shocked, as to when he saw your markings on my neck" Draco smirked and ran his finger along them. "Very pretty aren't they?" Draco looked down at Harry. Harry nodded and rubbed his eyes.
He held the sweatshirt and tried to pretend Draco was with him, holding him. It eventually worked because Harry did fall asleep. The worst reason to be asleep was to numb pain. Harry had done it too many times.
Harry was frozen with sadness and despair.
Draco sighed. "Then today we will do whatever you want" Harry looked back up and smiled. "Sounds good to me. How about we go eat breakfast in the Great Hall so I can see my friends. Then we can go read by the lake?"
Although he had done it many times before, it still rattled him to run through a brick wall. His friends immediately spotted him and ran up to embrace him. He held in a wince, it hurt the bruises.
Harry clapped his hands excitedly and began handing out their gifts to the rest of the people in the room. "We got these all last minute so if you don't like them, sucks" Draco said with a smirk and Harry hit his shoulder.
"Well I'll explain why I'm here." The man smirked devilishly and looked at everyone in the room. Draco had Harry pushed up against him, scared and trembling.
"Potter" Harry's heart dropped. Harry quickly wiped his eyes and got up to open the door. "Have you come here to pick on me or beat me up? Pick one and get it over with." Harry said sounding tired and sad. "No..I.." His gaze dropped down to Harry's now fully clothed body, wondering where he had got all the bruises. Draco was about to continue speaking when he saw rough ragged red lines along Harry's wrist. Harry noticed and pulled his sleeves down further hoping Draco hadn't seen.
"And he's usually not cold?" Ron sniggered and Hermione hit him. "Not recently, he got this letter, he wouldn't let me see it" Harry sighed. "Where's the letter?" Ron asked. "He probably took it with him." Harry wiped his eyes.
Snape mumbled more healing incantations. "Don't go anywhere tomorrow, please just stay in and rest" Snape looked at Harry. Harry nodded. "Make sure he doesn't go anywhere" Snape looked down to Draco. "I'll be sure of it, thank you Sev" Draco smiled.
He wrapped his free arm around Harry's waist. Harry smiled. "Open" Draco said. Narcissa opened her eyes to and was met with the cute eyes of an adorable puppy staring back at her. "Oh boys" She smiled and took the puppy from Draco's arms. "We knew it would get quiet around the house without us, so we got you something to liven it up" Harry reached out and pet the dog. "Thank you." Narcissa hugged them again, but was careful not to crush the dog.
It brought back memories of death and sickness. Death from the battle. The battle that Harry unintentionally caused.
Draco opened up the portrait and walked in. "What the bloody hell are you two doing tearing apart my housing?" He said angrily. "It's Harry's housing as well Malfoy" Ron snapped back.
"Yeah good idea..yeah me too" Harry said just as quietly. Draco was the first to break the intense stare. "Let the bed bugs bite potter." Draco said turning around and walking into the darkness of his room. "Goodnight to you too" Harry said and shut his door. Draco got into his room and grabbed at the collar of his shirt which felt as if it was tightening.
Hermione and Ron helped Draco outside. Ron patted Draco's back. "He'll be alright mate" Hermione said and Draco got on the back of the broom his mother was riding.
Harry turned around to face him. "Yes a very sweet moment of me saying bye to my friends Malfoy." Harry didn't make eye contact with Draco because well Draco was very intimidating, but Harry wouldn't let himself look a like a scared child.
"Merlin ok, this is going to sound odd, but did you snog Hermione last year because there was this rumor.." Draco said biting his tongue trying not to laugh. "Oh no most definitely not. I don't really like her like that..I don't really like many girls like that" Harry said.
"He has a problem, which needs solving immediately." Draco walked up to Snape's desk where he was sitting. Harry stayed where he was. He was honestly scared of Snape. Draco looked back at Harry. "Harry come here" Draco said softly. Snape's mouth almost fell off when he heard Draco say Harry's first name.
Harry blushed, his cheeks turning a light shade of pink. "Darling, I would love that" Harry smiled and kissed Draco. Draco held Harry's face so tenderly. They kissed like old lovers on a patio watching the sunset go down. It was a sweet and warm kiss, it felt so familiar. It warmed both of their hearts.
Draco sighed and wrapped his arms around Harry. "you were gonna just leave like everyone else...gonna give up" Harry whimpered. He didn't know how he managed to get so close to Draco so soon.  Draco knew he had made the wrong decision, he had always been a coward. A coward, the voice in his head repeated. Now he had disappointed the one person in his life he'd truly ever felt anything for.
smut warning: (here it is you horny bitches)
Harry slowly escaped Draco's grip and tip toed into the common room. The collar of his shirt felt as if it was tightening around his neck. Harry unbuttoned the first two buttons on his sleep wear. He ran his hand through his hair.
He set the table and served everyones food. His family all came in and sat at their places. His Uncle took one bite and looked up at Harry. "What is this?" He said "Ch-chicken" Harry said softly. "It's a disgrace,  are you trying to kill your aunt and cousin and myself?! Huh freak?" His uncle yelled at him
Draco awoke late the next morning. He looked down to where he would usually see Harry sleeping like a baby. Except this morning his arms were empty. Draco sighed and hoped Harry was safe. He got up out of Harry's bed and dragged himself into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth and dragged himself back into Harry's room. Draco curled back up under Harry's duvet.
Draco sucked two love bites on Harry's collarbone. His sweet pronounced collarbone. Draco kissed back up to Harry's lips. He wasn't kissing him hungrily anymore, it was sweeter. Draco always seemed to turn passionate moments sweet. He couldn't help it, being with Harry brought out a side of him he didn't know existed.
Draco laid his head back on the head board. Harry proceeded to suck on Draco's collarbone. Draco would mumble curse words under his breath. Harry finished sucking two sweet love bites on Draco's collarbone and proceeded to do something even riskier.
"What person?" He said once more. "Let's just say you know her rather well Potter." Pansy smirked and looked down at Harry's hands.
"It's very nice, the fireplace is excellent, the water pressure in the shower couldn't be better, the company could be better" Harry said scowling a little and glancing over at Draco. Hermione placed her hand on Harry's and smiled, happy for him. Hermione had no way to be sure but, she had always questioned Harry's sexuality. Maybe Draco would be the one to bring it out of him. She's always suspected he wasn't straight. He just had never told her anything about it.
Hermione smiled. "Alright well then come on." She said. "It's cold you may want a larger sweatshirt, or coat or something" Ron said. Draco shook his head. "No I'm fine in this" He got his shoes and put them on. "Well on with it then" Draco smiled and walked out of the portrait.
Draco put on his pajamas and flopped down onto his bed. He smirked, satisfied with himself. That had gone much better than Draco had thought it was going to. Draco loved the way things were happening but couldn't shake the thought of Harry's wrists out of his head. Draco yearned to know about the bruises, and how Harry had received them. He longed to know why Harry did the awful things himself. Draco had always been too nosy for his own good. He knew in his mind he shouldn't do what he was about to do, but he did it anyways.
Draco held his hand the whole way there, obviously secretly so no one would notice. They arrived in front of Snape's classroom. Draco started talking  "Are you ready? I can do all the talking if you want. I can ask him questions, Are you ready? If you're not we can turn around. I know it's difficult-" Harry cut him off. "Stop rambling let's go" Draco opened the door and walked in.
"Well well well if it isn't Draco Malfoy" A voice said from beside him. "Yes hello Pansy" Draco said dryly. "What's the attitude? Not hyped to see your best bud in town?" She pouted and laughed. "Not in the mood" Draco shrugged and ate. "Potter problem?" She smiled.
Harry hadn't even realized that there were warm tear streams running down his face. He was so emotional, it was embarrassing. "...Potter" Draco said softly. Harry had only heard that part of whatever Draco had said. Harry didn't respond he just sat there. "Potter" Draco said a little louder. Harry looked up to meet eyes with him.
"Why would she do that?" Harry asked. "I don't know why you're asking me. You dated her Harry you should know" Blaise turned his attention down to Harry. "I didn't really date her..but no I have no idea." Harry fiddled with his fingers.
"Harry please..it's not like that. I didn't want you to die or be threatened. My father is an awful man..i couldn't tell you...i couldn't put your life in danger. You've been put in danger more times than anyone deserves" Draco said softly. He was trying to keep his cool, keep calm so Harry wouldn't be more distressed than he was now.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Shut up." Draco scoffed and got under the covers. He found it hard to sleep, hard to let his mind shut down. Draco knew what he was doing to Harry was wrong. Draco knew he could never give Harry a relationship, a true love. As of now Draco didn't care, he just loved the way he could relax Harry, or relieve him of his pain. He loved the way he could make Harry melt so easily.
"I figured i'd make it a fair fight, wouldn't be much fun if I could take it so easily so here." Barty tossed each of their wands to them. Harry's trembling hand reached out and grabbed ahold of his.
He had gotten Blaise and Neville a joint gift, necklaces. One said he's a catch, the other said he's a keeper. Harry thought it was a funny cute gift for them because they were just starting out. Blaise was very passionate about quidditch so Harry found it to be a perfect gift. It was cheesy but cute.
Draco sighed happily. "That sounds beautiful Draco, let's do it" Harry smiled. "Oh Harry and.." Draco stood up and took Harry's hand pulling him to his feet. "We could go to Paris with our child. We could show them where daddy and daddy went on a sweet vacation" Draco smiled and spun Harry around.
Harry released and moaned a final quiet moan. "I love you" Harry chuckled and kissed Draco again.
"Well then guess I get on with it." Bellatrix raised her wand. "Immediate death for you. I won't make you suffer because you are still my nephew" Bellatrix smiled.
"I'm still extremely sorry, I feel terrible. Absolutely terrible" Draco laid his free hand on top of Harry's. "Draco, drop it. It's completely fine I'm seriously ok" Harry moved closer to him. Draco fixed his droopy posture, he was now sitting taller. Harry chuckled and dropped his head. "What was that?" Harry smiled.
"How do you know if someone's in love?" Harry looked over at Hermione. Hermione smiled and leaned in to tell Harry, as if it was a huge secret. "Think you're in love?" Ron  looked at him. "No...I just want to know" Harry turned his attention back towards Hermione. "If they really love you, they'll ask your middle name." Hermione smiled and continued. "Why does that logic make any sense?" Harry questioned.
He was not going to be publicly humiliated like this without Harry being hot and bothered as well. Harry smiled to himself and watched Draco shift in his seat. Draco slowly flicked his tongue out of his mouth running it along his bottom lip. Draco got up walking over to Gryffindor table. Harry was perplexed now.
"Hedwig" Harry looked up at him. Draco cocked his head. "hm?"
"And your little love affair won't last much longer, how could it when Harry will be dead soon anyways" His father laughed.
Draco saw the casket, open. He took in a deep shaky breath.
"You're gorgeous" Draco said softly. "Thank you love" Harry smiled and pecked the tip of his nose. "Wanna go look around the manor?" Draco asked him. Harry nodded and put some shoes on, Draco did the same.
"Christmas can wait another 30 minutes" Draco said groggily, he was barely conscious. "No, no it cannot. Come on Dray I wanna go open gifts" Harry nagged. Draco's eyes completely fluttered open. He smiled when he was met with the cheery face of his love. "Fine love" Draco said and went in to kiss Harry.
"Oh..nothing..nothing important now" Draco said looking away from Harry. "Get out" Harry said out of nowhere, sounding angry or hurt. "What?" Draco looked down at him. "Out." Harry scolded.
"I couldn't agree more." A deeper voice, sounding like a man said from the staircase. Everyone's heads snapped back to look at him.
Streams of tears falling down his and Harry's faces.
Draco lifted Harry onto the bathroom counter. Harry moaned slightly and continued to make out with Draco. Draco held Harry's body against his own, Harry's legs were wrapped tightly around Draco's torso. Draco pulled away from Harry's lips and kissed down his neck. Draco held Harry's back and waist tightly.
Draco only chuckled.
"You don't have t-" Draco said sincerely but was cut off. "I know I don't have to, I want to." Harry cleared his throat. Draco simply nodded and leaned back into the couch. "Ever since my parents passed, I have been living with my wretched aunt and uncle, not my mention my awful cousin. It was alright at first, but then things got...a little bad" Harry took yet another shaky breath.
Draco got back into his room and basically slapped himself. "Idiot idiot idiot" Draco mumbled. He put his hand on his head and sighed. Draco knew he shouldn't be nice to Harry, but all of his reasons why were slowly becoming not great reasons.
"Looks like it's just you against us now" Draco smirked at his aunt. "I can take all of you on, this should be easy." Bellatrix smiled and began throwing more spells. She was aiming all of them at Harry, but no one would allow her spells to touch him.
They all began opening at the same time. Draco and Harry occasionally looking at the other person's gifts. Harry saw a few items of clothing he knew he would be stealing from Draco when they returned back to Hogwarts. Draco saw some cologne's of Harry's he would definitely be using without Harry's permission.
Harry looked down at the sweater he wore to cover his wrists and arms. He would never let his friends or anyone find out what he was doing to himself. It was one of the only way he felt any release. Harry knew it was bad but he didn't care anymore. He had tried stopping a couple of times, but when things would get rough he would start again. It was the worst habit Harry had ever picked up.
He took the cloak off once he was out of sight and inhaled deeply. The fresh air was exactly what he needed, his head had stopped pounding. Harry walked around the grounds, just wandering about.
He knew Harry had become putty in his hands. "So you're lying?" Draco said making eye contact with Harry. "Maybe" Harry said softly a smirk playing on his lips. Harry didn't want to let himself do this even though he wanted it so very badly. In that moment Harry could think of two things only.
"Hello Auntie Bella" Draco said kindly as well. She waved. "Dinner will be in an hour, west something a little formal" Narcissa smiled and waved farewell. The two of them left.
"Hm" Snape smirked for a split second. "Interesting, well how about Draco takes some of it, see if it works on him" Snape said. Both of the boys shrugged. Draco poured the rest of the potion into the vial and downed it. Draco cleared his throat. "God that's disgusting" He smacked his lips.
Meanwhile...
He saw Draco's concern buried deep in the clouds that made his eyes.
Louis and Draco had been friends since 5th year. Louis knew all about Draco's..Harry issue. Draco confided in Louis because Louis understood what he was going through at the time. Back when he was closeted, he had no one to tell or turn to.
Harry and Draco both smiled. "Harry, your uncle and aunt, they would like you to return home for the weekend. I strongly suggest you go" Dumbledore said calmly. Harry felt his throat closing. His breath became very unsteady and his legs felt like jelly. "Did they say what for?" Harry said shakily.
"Okay?" Neville said nervously. "You know Blaise Zabini right?" Harry placed his head on the palm of his hand to hold it up. Neville's cheeks heated up and he smiled slightly. "Yeah I know him" Neville said obviously trying to sound stern. "Well, I've heard he's got a crush on you" Harry smirked.
Harry groaned, annoyed he had to wake up. Harry yawned and rolled off of Draco's bed. He smiled and looked over to the indent of his and Draco's bodies in the bed. Harry got up and walked to his bedroom.  He stretched and pulled out his robes from his wardrobe.
Harry put his clothes on and yawned. "Why are they here again?" Harry looked up at Draco. "They wanted to check on you" Draco shrugged and ruffled Harry's hair. Harry pecked Draco and opened the bathroom door. Draco got dressed and followed Harry out. "Hey you two" Harry sat down slowly, he was still quite sore.
"Now a spin" Draco smiled. Harry let Draco spin him softly before pulling him back in by the waist. Harry and Draco danced around the room. "You've got basic ballroom dancing down, so come here" Draco removed his hand from Harry's and wrapped both arms around Harry's waist. Harry wrapped both arms around Draco's neck and rested his head on Draco's shoulder just letting the music take them away to a peaceful place. Draco and Harry danced the night away.
It opened to reveal Hermione and Ron. "What the bloody hell is going on here?" Ron said with a scowl on his face. "How did you get the password?" Draco said, avoiding Ron's question because he really didn't have a good answer. "Dumbledore told us to come check on you" Hermione said. "And how did you know which room was my room?" Harry asked.
Draco did indeed laugh at that. He also felt his heart twist. Draco picked up the sweatshirt and put it on. It was a bit small, but not too small. Draco inhaled the strong scent Harry had left behind.
"It's so peaceful and beautiful, I come up here and listen to music on an old record player I brought up here or read" Draco smiled and looked at the general direction of the record player. Harry admired the way Draco spoke so passionately about just a room. "Accio" Draco pointed his wand at an old sheet on the other side of the room. The record player came to Draco and he smiled satisfied with himself. Draco put the stylus down on a record that was already on the player. It began playing music, a gorgeous slow ballad.
Draco licked along the bottom of Harry's baby soft lips, asking for permission to enter. Harry's mouth opened slightly allowing Draco in. Draco's thumb was circling Harry's hip bone softly. Harry was moving around slightly underneath him. Draco steadied him, and kissed out to the corner of Harry's mouth.
"You have nothing to be nervous about it's all going to be fine darling" Draco kissed Harry's head. Harry smiled and rested his head against Draco's chest. "You're right" Harry took in a deep breath. "Okay are you ready?" Draco looked down at Harry.
"Ah my godson, hello my boy how are y-" Snape stopped talking when he saw Harry follow Draco into the room. "Potter" Snape said bitterly. "Lay off Sevy" Draco said sternly.
"Let's get you ready!" Pansy smiled and ran upstairs to Draco and Harry's suite within the Malfoy Manor. Everyone followed her, Blaise going over every last minute thing he could think of. "Yes, yes I have everything and everything is going fine. Mum's at the venue right now and everything has arrived it's gorgeous she says" Draco smiled and walked into his bedroom, grabbing the suit.
Draco moved their faces closer so their lips could meet. Harry sunk into the kiss and his arms made their way around Draco's neck. Draco pulled Harry up onto him, Harry straddled his abdomen. Draco bit Harry's bottom lip softly, causing Harry's mouth to slightly open. Draco took the opportunity to slip his tongue in. Harry's tongue tried to fight against Draco's dominant one but failed.
Harry shivered and followed Draco.
"Lucius. I hate it. I absolutely hate it" Draco said as he was making a vomiting face over his middle name. "Well I'm sorry you feel that way.  Then I'll just stick with Draco blank Malfoy" Harry smiled. Draco chuckled and rolled his eyes.
"If you want the clean version I can tell it" Draco smiled. Snape nodded. "Sounds good" Snape came all the way inside and the portrait closed behind him. Draco lead him to the couch and sat down.
