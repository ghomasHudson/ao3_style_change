"You know, I think Potter grew up to be like Lupin." Belle stated. Draco gave him a questioning look. "Well, Andromeda told us how they all were. She knew the marauders personally. Potter is kind and caring but at the same time he's fucking sassy. He grew up to be Lupin." Belle explained.
Belle, Harry, Ron and Blaise laughed and talked about most unnecessary things. At one point they were talking about how specific and similar Blaise's and Harry's features were. Both had dark skin, Blaise eyes were sapphire blue while Harry's eyes were emerald green. Belle was a complete goofball, she made the most obscene comments that turned things awkward and laughed about it. Blaise couldn't help but feel warm and fuzzy everytime Belle laughed pushing her head back. Belle couldn't help blush everytime Blaise smiled and played with his thumbs whenever he spoke. Ron and Hermione loved each other so much that every once a while they checked on each other and smiled.
It takes a while before Draco does look up. Harry held his breath the entire time. He isn't much good at comforting people, but with Draco he always seem to find a way.
The party was raging and so many people were drunk except Ginny. Ginny hated drinking. After being possessed by Voldemort, she didn't like the feeling of not having control over her body. So no one forced her to drink. It was past curfew so the music had turned from party music to romantic songs. Ginny and Theo danced alongside Pansy, Luna and Ron, Hermione and Neville and Hannah. Blaise danced with Belle.
He doesn't quite remember what happens next. He does know that it started with him throwing his hairbrush on the mirror. The mirror shattering into million tiny pieces, as shattered as he his. He knows at one point he has a baseball bat. Maybe he transfigured it from something. He has blurry images of him trashing and breaking things and screaming on the top of his lungs. He sits down on the floor and groans in pain. There are some pieces of glass on his right palm. He doesn't remember the glass pieces going in his skin. He sits. He hates. He hurts. He breaths.
"I just know about what everyone else does. That whoever it is, is targeting pedophiles. " Draco says, deliberately not giving other information he has.
"I have made a list of few things that will help us make a case against the ministry. But to be sure, we need you to tell us everything so that we can have proper story to give to the lawyers. I'm guessing you have one?" Granger says.
"Hi little man. I'm uncle Draco. I'm a metamorphmagus. Just like you. It's been a while since I've been able to do it though. Maybe you'll help me do it again."
Draco shakes his head smiling and pulls away. He goes to the washroom and washes up his face. He emerges out of the washroom wearing only red knickers, walks and stands by the full length mirror in the room by the window. Potter emerges behind him, catching his collar. Draco had only ever removed that collar while bath and wore it entire day, everyday. They just removed it today for the dinner. Potter stands behind him, his erection touching Draco's arse. Potter lovingly clasps the red O-ring collar on Draco's neck and gives his shoulder a gentle kiss. Draco slowly catches Potter's hand and slides it on a huge X mark on his torso, looked Potter in the green eyes.
Draco shouldn't be surprised that Christian understood. But he was surprised that he guessed who it was. Draco looks down and gives a small nod.
Draco doesn't reply. What will he say. He has nothing to say to them. To anyone. He's got nothing left to offer. He is dead inside. Just as dead as his mother.
"Its from here. This portrait, it has a passage that leads to Hogsmade. It leads to a shop that is of a man who if I didn't know better I would say is Dumbledore." She explained. I gave her a confused look. "The man who owns that shop looks exactly like Dumbledore. Like he is Dumbledore's brother or something." She explained.
Harry looks him dead in the eye and Draco averts his eyes. Harry knows that it isn't because Draco is scared of him. It's because he wants to and that does funny things to Harry. There's a gorgeous pink tint on Draco's cheeks and Harry loves it. He smiles. The rest of the half hour passes with light chatter as it seems like little grass isn't ready to talk about what happened. Or will only talk to Ginny and Draco. They finally get up to leave and Draco makes a joke about using silencing charm while little grass says that we should too.
Harry almost laughed at her reaction. After all they've been through, Hermione never swears. Even after her viciousness, she still was a goody two shoes in so many ways. Her eyes widened and Harry can swear he saw her bushy hair stand up like a cat's which briefly reminded her of that polyjuice accident back in second year. With some effort he managed to supress his laughter after he remembered that specific incident.
"Belle. Why don't you become the defence against the dark arts professor after finishing the teaching studies? As they all talk about you, you will be good at it." Harry said.
"Don't let Andromeda know anything about it for now. Just tell her that you are visiting. And contact that guy who got the letter. He's our way to contact Narcissa." Ron demands.
Wormtail you better start writing properly or you have hell of a prank coming your way. Prongs whats the idea???
"That would've been a stupid thing to do. It would've only excited that asshole more. I can use him not knowing about me being good in dada to my advantage at some point." I explained. She nodded and kissed my cheek.
Harry takes a deep breath. He can feel the warmth in his chest, of his pet thinking of him, doing this for him. He puts two fingers under Draco's chin and pulls his face up to catch it in a long kiss. Draco, as always, surrenders to the kiss.
Blaise took the note and shooed the Hufflepuff away. He might've been a fourth or fifth year. Draco took the note and opened it with a shaking hand.
"Yeah. He was the best we ever had. He actually knew his shit and was kind and gentle. Fucking sassy and hilarious at the same time. If it wasn't for your so called godfather, he would've been able to teach at least a couple years more." Belle ranted.
He didn't torture Dudley that much. Dudley was afterall, a child as well. Harry ensured not to use his wand as he slowly and painfully, cut them in pieces while they were still conscious. He saw their breathing stop at cutting their heads. With a quick spell, he transfigured all of the parts of the dead bodies to various stuff, like china, wooden toys, dead animals. And with a quick spell, he cleaned all the blood. He cast a strong Notice Me Not charm and Muggle Repellent charm then asked Draco to lift his head.
"Have some water, my love. And breakfast. Then you can tend to me and prepare to meet Ginny." He says as Draco tries to recover from two strong orgasms he had.
"So are you, Harry. You just hide it better. Try talking to him. It'll take time but maybe he will open up. You both are the same as you said. Maybe you both need each other." Ginny says gently.
"I'll never watch you wearing jeans, will I? Always the sharp edged trousers and shirts." Harry snorts.
"Well, you're here at the wrong time. All are on lunch break now. Come have lunch with me and then I'll set you up."
Draco laughs. "Almost everything has a name, Potter. Even nameless things have names." He replies, his eyes still closed. "What do you like about it?" He finally opens his eyes and asks.
"There was a time Darien couldn't keep his hands off me. Now I feel pathetically grateful if he even glances at me once." Draco says, finally, out loud. The truth about his marriage.
Draco laughs at Harry's lame joke. Harry's laying on the bed as Draco is sitting on his stomach. There's a box of small pastries and cupcakes on Harry's chest, which Draco is using as a table. He takes some pastry on the spoon and feeds it to Harry, smiling and smiling, Harry accepts the sweet treat. Harry loves these moments just as much he loves the sex.  Draco is so carefree and like a kitten during these times. He loves how sappy it is. He loves Draco's laugh and he loves how he feels so happy and complete. Harry places the pastry box aside on the bed and grips Draco's hips, he pulls Draco forward and with a smile, Draco bends down to kiss Harry. Harry kisses his lips, his cheek, his nose, his lips, then he expertly, removes Draco's blouse.
Draco walks inside the sanctuary, planning to meet Nan. Instead of walking straight towards her room, he walks towards the kids area. He stands outside quietly, looking inside. Potter is in there, making that beautiful stag patronus dance and prance along, making the children laugh. He was laughing as well. He was so handsome. With one last glance, he turns and walks to his nan's room. The laughter and noises can be heard till Nan's room.
"Don't. Although I'm sure you remember that night, 16th July, your best friend's birthday. That was the night you slept with her husband, wasn't it? Some, six years ago."
"I'm so glad you both are together. You can't see it, Draco, but it has done you so much good. You waited so long to talk about what you felt, the good and the bad. You let it simmer deep below, let it fester and eat you. I don't think I've seen you talk so openly about yourself or your feelings. Potter seems a lot happier with you as well. He always looked like he was in a strought in the start of last year. But since you both got together, he looks alive." Tori smiled.
Harry pulled back and rested his forehead on Draco's. He was very well aware of the goofy grin on his face. He couldn't help himself. He pecked Draco's lips again.
"Nura keeps calling Draco pretty human and is now challenging me for Draco's affection." Harry rolled his eyes.
"Don't make promises you can't keep. One day, you'll realise that I'm not worth it. And just like all of them, you will discard me when you're done with me. You will leave me alone." Draco cries hard.
With a wandless accio, Potter summons his wand, points it at Draco and casts a spell Draco has never heard before. Draco can immediately feel sensations on his ears and on his ass and suddenly, he feels something like fur touching the back of his thighs. He lifts his hand to investigate the ears. Instead of the human round shape, the upper half of his ears are pointy and furry. He slowly reaches his ass and gasps. He feels a bushy, furry tail. He looks at Potter with his eyes practically out of his head then blushes furiously and gives Potter an extremely shy smile. Potter smiles back. His smile filled with love and adoration.
"We come there twice a week to meet the children, teach them some things and play with them. And you?" Potter asks back.
Narcissa laughs as Nicholas spashes some water on her. They both were cleaning the kitchen after an intense dessert fight which then turned into an intense chocolate filled love making session with a tied up Narcissa. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Narcissa, she's never been more happier in life. She is with the man she loves, who loves her back, respects her, treats her kindly, and even her son. She is back with her sister she lives with now, helping her raise their grandson. A bundle of joy he is, Teddy Lupin who always turns his hair blonde whenever he watches Narcissa or Draco appear. She's back with her son who is also free of Lucius and is happy with the man he loves. And most importantly, she's free. She looks at Nicholas wiping his hands on a washcloth. His messy back curls falling on his eyes and bronze skin gleaming in the kitchen light.
"This wouldn't have been counted for if Bee wasn't awake. She is now. And she can tell the truth." Blaise explained.
"We are Slytherins yes. Our parent's are at the wrong side, also yes. But we don't want to be with them. Draco trusts you so we will trust you too. We need your help." Theo talks.
Draco couldn't look at Harry. His cheeks were red from blushing. Harry did a wandless silencing charm. He caught Draco's waist from one hand his caught his hair from other and pulled in Draco for a kiss. The kiss started slowly but then Harry became aggressive with the kissing. He kissed hard and forced his tongue in Draco's mouth. Draco caught Harry's neck from one hand. His other hand went in Harry's shirt. Harry broke the kiss and without wasting a second kissed Draco's neck. He slowly sucked and bit Draco's neck while still having a hard grip on his hair. Draco left out soft moans and put his hand on Harry's ass. Draco felt his tender but firm ass while Harry sucked his neck. Harry pulled of and kissed Draco again. As soon as Harry moved his hand slowly towards Draco's abdomen, slowly going down there was a knock at the door.
Harry smirked. They could believe all they want but the Black Library and Malfoy Library had way too many books on magic none of these people knew about. Obviously it would give the whole world a fit if they found out that their savior is using dark magic. No wonder that magic is banned. It's not banned because it's dark, it's banned because it's powerful and these people are too stupid to not understand it's power. Or too stupid to not want to understand it's power. And Harry, was not the most powerful wizard of their age for nothing. He would have to tone down but. This can get real ugly real fast.
So many questions. Harry has so many questions. There are so many things he doesn't understand. So many things he can't believe. Teddy. Draco. He has to keep them both safe. Draco he will, but with Teddy being in France, how will he? Narcissa has taken an extremely dangerous risk by sending this letter to Harry. And help, Harry will give her. He rescued Draco. He'll rescue her too. He just needs to figure out how. So he does the first thing he can think of. He calls Hermione and Ron.
It's a beautiful quote that is put on her tombstone. She did end the war. Lied to Voldemort on his face to get to Draco. Her love for Draco made it possible for Potter's side to win. Her love made it possible that Draco was safe. Her love that Draco will no longer have. He turns and walks towards his Aunt Andromeda. He pulls out his mother's necklace. He knows what's in there. A picture of all three black sisters, laughing as teenagers, free of all the pressures of the war. He takes his aunt's hand and places the necklace in her hands and leaves. He doesn't wait to see his aunt recognised the pendant. He doesn't wait to see his aunt burst in tears clutching the necklace to her chest. Instead he walks towards the winter garden.
"Go and meet her. If some sensible solution does come up, you'll be able to come Hogwarts with us." Pansy says. "We're leaving with the guys to do school shopping now. Only a week is left. We'll see you later okay?"
"Tr- truth" I sob. When she realizes I'm crying my eyes out, she looks at me sympathetically and let's me in without answering the question. "Thank you." I say in a cracked voice.
Draco watches mesmerized as he hears Lovegood and Thomas talk for Draco instead of against. All they said is true. No doubt. But he hadn't expected anyone to come for him. He was branded afterall. A Malfoy. A death-eater. So many of their families and friends lost so much because of his own family. They were tortured so brutally in there by his own father and aunt. How could they not hate him? But they didn't. He saw and heard as they spoke on behalf of Draco. Painting him as a victim. A fallen hero. Everything that Draco doesn't believe himself to be. He deserves death. He deserves azkaban. Be deserves the hatred.
"Yes, Sir. Can you please look at these? There are business plans. Everything is set, I have the land, you keep meeting investers and rich people so, I thought maybe you could help." Cormac smiled hopefully.
"You needed time, Draco, I understand. Just one owl saying you'll talk when you're ready, to give you a few days, that's all you had to send. I was worried sick. I just saw you there, breaking apart, crying hysterically. I don't know why and I just didn't know how I could help. Don't ever do that to me again."
McGonagall has called all the Slytherins. All the professors are putting protection wards. Many people from the order are here. They're making all the underage go. Shit. I'm underage. I'm 16. I can't leave my friends alone here. I'm not going to go. All the Slytherins come. This is it. This is when my friends sacrifice themselves and no one will even know.
"We started a trend." Teddy kept the conversation going, waiting for James to realise that he was here in the school.
"I know. But I can't help myself when I'm around you. And if I can't get forever then I'll be happy with these nights. Like tonight. You're coming with me." Christian says and kisses.
"There are other ways of killing me you know? No one lasts more than a year. How am I supposed to?" Belle asked.
"I would like that." She says. I get up and fix the couch for her. "The kids are safe. Its done." She says then explains about the order and passage and Aberforth. After everything I give her an apple I was intending to eat. She eats it and falls asleep. I take my diary out and tell people three kids are safely smuggled out of the castle and have a safe place to go to. I sit down laying my head on the couch and fall asleep as well after adding some protective charms on the door.
"Better. But I still can't leave him alone for more than a few minutes. It's like he's afraid that I'll vanish and leave him alone forever. His abuse was a secret for so long and to have it outed this way, I don't even know how to fix it. He thought I would be mad at him because he kept it a secret. Then he thought I would leave him after I'm done with him the way the others did. I feel like I'm still reassuring him that I won't just dump him and leave. Ginny and Tori say it's because he's never had the kind of intimacy that we have. Astoria says it's closeness and intimacy he wants, because he's never gotten it much. Not because he's afraid that I'll leave. But to tell you the truth, I love the clinginess. It just, feels good to be needed this way, like I am his everything." Harry smiles.
I'm freaking out! They've got Luna. She's locked here in our cell. They're angry about everything that was getting published on Quibbler. They will only give her back to her father if he manages to give them Potter. What do I do? I can't get her out if here. They'll know it was me.
"I've never seen you smile like that looking at anyone. Not even Christian." Iris says. "I'm happy for you Draco. I hope he's treating you well.
Pansy and Luna were taking care of Teddy as Harry took Draco out for a date. Harry had set up a picnic near the black lake. Draco kissed Harry. Harry sat, resting his back on a tree. Draco sat on his lap, his back resting on Harry. They talked and kissed and talked more. For Draco, his life couldn't be more perfect. He had the boy he loved his entire life as his boyfriend, who loved him back. He had a family, which was Belle and Teddy. He had amazing friends. His life was perfect.
"Enter." We hear he voice and enter. "Aah Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter. This is Mr Hugh Holland. He's here from the ministry to meet you both."
Everyone said their goodbyes. Harry and Draco went to Draco's room. Teddy was being taken care of by Tilly. They all went to sleep soon. Luna and Pansy slept on Pansy's bed. Theo and Ginny slept on Theo's bed. Belle and Blaise slept on Blaise's bed. Ron and Hermione slept together and so did Neville and Hannah.
"James, please keep your reckless Gryffindorness within you and try not to get hurt. And I know it's no use to tell you to keep the pranks down. But please be safe okay? And try to wait at least a month before we get a howler from McGonagall shouting us about some prank you pulled. She's scary." Draco chuckled and kissed James forehead.
Draco eventually shifted his gaze and spoke to everyone. He and Hermione had real deep conversations about many things. Harry looked at Draco and couldn't take his eyes out. Draco's hair shone and his pale, toned body was free. Not at all tensed like it always used to be. He had never seen Draco so calm and carefree. He couldn't help but think how beautiful Draco looked.
Draco looked at his food and then started sobbing. So many emotions were hitting Draco together. Guilt, anger, denial, acceptance, denial again, anger at those muggles, anger at himself, guilt for making people he love upset. Harry settled Teddy on his armchair and then held Draco while he sobbed.
Oh, that's new. Everytime Draco thinks that Potter can't make things anymore hotter than they are, Potter does. Draco can feel the magic making him follow the orders. There is no way Draco can refrain it. Draco is reduced to nothing but just being a hole to warm his Master's cock. He bends his back a little and the position is uncomfortable but Draco is so hard that it doesn't matter. Afterall, he's always loved to be bounded in uncomfortable positions. There's precum dripping from his cock and he can feel his knickers soak through it but there's nothing he can do. He can't touch, he can't rub and he definitely can't cum. So he closes his eyes, feels the ache in his jaw due to the huge and broad cock in his mouth, feels the spit drool down and just breathes. Even though he's bounded, a slave, he feels oddly free on his knees with the cock in his mouth. He breathes. His mind is quiet and his breaths are slow. Right now, he isn't Draco Malfoy. He isn't a former death-eater or Harry Potter's boyfriend. He isn't an abused child. Right now, he's just his Master's bounded slave. And he's free.
I walk towards her and pull her into a hug. She hugs back. With slow pace we all walk towards the great hall. We all walk and look at the breakfast made on the table. There are so many choices to eat but none of us feel much hungry. Half-heartedly I pick up one pancake and some whipped cream. I ate half a pancake amd left rest of the plate untouched. I heard Snape calling us.
"Every year you come to my compartment. The only difference this time is that you're coming as my boyfriend. Still a git, but my git." Harry laughed as he went to kiss Draco. Draco kissed back.
Draco, the fucker laughs again and then bends down to kiss the still laying Harry. Harry, still annoyed but kisses back. Draco is still smiling and finally, Harry smiles on the kiss as well. He later realises none of them have cleaning charm and Draco isn't complaining. Draco pulls back and picks up Harry's wand. He mutter a spell and the loud music starts blaring. Harry groans. How he misses the calming music that used to be played in the morning. Draco laughs and tones down the volume a bit. The music is still too loud for Harry, but he will suffer through it for Draco. Draco lays back besides him and Harry pulls him close by holding him by his chest. Harry kisses his neck and the top of his head. Then he just holds him and just be. He smiles when Draco turns and his pointy nose presses through Harry's collarbone.
"You should meet Dally. You'll like her. She'll like you too hopefully. She has hair like mine." Draco speaks.
"You've done so good, Draco. You've been such a good boy. Hold it a little more. Don't cum without permission." Harry tells him.
"Oh, you are a skilled occlumence? You needed to learn when you were playing house with He Who Must Not Be Named?" Storm sneered.
Harry couldn't help but feel mixed emotions. He wanted to hex the shit out of that cow Bulstrode but he even wanted to laugh at Draco. His situation and his behavior was funny. Slughorn gave Harry antidote and Harry force fed it to Draco. Slowly Draco calmed down and it was like he woke up from a nap. He suddenly became aware that he was no longer in the party and looked at Slughorn and Harry stunned.
Home. Harry is Draco's home. Draco still hasn't said that he loves Harry but this what he said, it's much more valuable, much more real and pure than confessing love. Harry knows how it feels to not have a home and the one home you had is ruined for you. But being someone's home, Harry has never had that. And he refuses to be the one who rips Draco off from his home. He'll be the safest, most loving person Draco ever has. He will be Draco's home. He can feel his chest flutter. He nods at Draco.
Potter loosens his grip on Draco and leads him to the out of the castle with their hands interwined. As they walk towards the lake, they see Charlie and Draco does not miss the glare Charlie and Potter give each other. Draco feels Potter's grip tighten on him and Draco bites his lip to hide his smile. For some reason, after so long, Draco feels safe. The walk over the lake is quiet and the silence is comfortable. Draco keeps getting closer to Potter until there's not much distance left between them and their sides are touching. Potter keeps rubbing his thumb on the back of Draco's hand in a soothing manner.
After 10 minutes of crying, I go to the washroom and fix myself. I come back to my room and open my trunk. I take out my Ancient Rune's books and some parchments. With that I take my diary out. I open to see if there's anything new. There are some messages.
"Blood flavoured lollipops. As many as you can bring." Draco pouts like the spoilt brat he is. Harry's spoilt brat.
"I need to talk to you both and Neville after lessons. Its important. Also it has to be a secret." I say.
Harry, with a skip in his steps, walked inside Grimauld Place. With a goofy grin, he walked towards his room, onlh to be stopped in the kitchen.
I heard Bellatrix laugh her maniac laugh then cast a crucio. McGonagall's screams fills my ears. I wish I could save her. Stop screaming!! Please stop screaming. Please everyone just stop. Make it stop. The meeting gets over and I practically run from there.
Millicent looks down at the coins, her vision blurry with tears. She falls on the floor there in front of the coins, and she cries. With little effort, she picks herself up to go to the bathroom, to fix herself. But she feels broken, so broken that nothing can be fixed. So she does one thing she knew she shouldn't. She picks up the liquid bathroom cleaner, the poison for her, she uncaps the bottle and drinks it all in a gulp, avoiding the burn in her stomach.
Not many people were there as many students didn't come back after the war. There were almost just thirty to forty people, mixing all the four houses and two years. There weren't many students in first year as well. After the sorting ceremony and the feast was done, all the last year's went to their new tower. The tower had the colours of all four houses mixed. They all were pretty tired so all went in their dorms.
Harry walked past her and opened the door to the room Draco was in. There he was. His Draco, laying pale on the bed, looking lifeless. He looked paler than usual. What shocked Harry was the scars. So many of them, barely leaving any space for the skin to show. All over his shoulders, his chest, his stomach. Harry was pretty sure that there were scars on his back and lower body as well. What horrified Harry the most were huge criss cross scars that go from his hips, stomach to his neck which Harry knows are the scars from the time he almost killed Draco in the girls lavatory. Harry curses himself. Hates that he's one of the person to add the scars on Draco. His Draco.
"Of course she's happy." Darien smiles. "And I haven't forgotten your promotion. 300 galleons a month. Come."
"It was the same for me, you know. Ron and Hermione. I gave up on them and that's when it started working out. It's weird, isn't it? Our children best friends while we were at each other's throat at all times. Surreal. Albus complaints a lot about Scorpius."
To Harry Potter, I leave this hand knit comforter and a bundle journals. Dear Harry, this comforter was given to me as a gift by Lily, James, Sirius, Remus and unfortunately, Peter. They handstiched it for me after I left my family for Edward. This is the most personal thing I can give you that belongs to people who loved you. The journals I am giving you is how the marauders spoke to each other when they couldn't be together. They made it during school. I'm sorry I'm giving this to you so late but I didn't have anything else to leave for you. The journals Draco and his friends used only reminded me more of them."
"Noted." He says and gives Draco a reassuring smile. This seems to bring a little confidence in Draco.
He hears Draco gasps as he cups Draco's erection. Draco looks edible, looking at Harry with those black wide blown eyes and it takes everything for Harry to control him and not fuck him then and there. He puts his fingers in Draco's knickers to pull it down. Draco raises his hips to help. He pulls Draco's knickers down with ease and kisses Draco's inner thighs.
"Blaise is much darker than Potter. Potter is bronze golden. Blaise is brown. Like proper brown. He grew up to be even more hotter."
The next week went beautifully for Pansy. Smith took her out for luches, dinners, plays, and she cherished every one of those dates. They hadn't kissed yet, Smith seemed reluctant. But Pansy was ready to wait. Because Smith had also introduced her to his parents. Smiths were like Parkinsons, they weren't a part of Sacred 28 but were still purebloods.
Harry thinks about the past three months. Three best months of his life. He still gets blowjobs every morning, its a fixed routine now. Draco is apparently very clingy, he found out but tries to show he's not. He's like a pet kneazle who will look at you in the eyes while pushing the china from the table but will cuddle you after a while and demand attention. They would have amazing sex and Harry had early on noticed Draco was a sucker for praises. Harry loved the blush on his cheeks when Harry praised him. His cheeks and neck would turn pink, and during sex he would turn crimson. He defied Harry for fun so that Harry would pin him down. Draco's eyes shone with adoration and trust. Harry loved that look in Draco's silver eyes and there weren't many people who Draco looked at with trust like that. His Slytherin group were the only one he looked at like that. Oh, and Lavender Brown.
Ginny and Hermione are playing frisbee against Ron and Astoria. He laughs as he watches Ron fall then looks back at the sea. The sun is setting down painting the sky in various colours. It's beautiful but has got nothing on the sunrise they saw early in the morning. Draco always was partial towards sunrises. He looks at his toes as he curls it in the warm sand. He feels Potter sit behind him and bind him in an embrace by his arms and legs. Draco leans back as he allows himself to be held completely. Who would've thought that he would end up here with his childhood nemises now lover? If three years ago anyone had told him that he would be in love and would be loved so fiercely by Harry Potter, he would've admitted them in Janus Thickery ward of St Mungos. Bur here he is. Loved and owned by Harry Potter and he's free.
"Don't listen to your brother's stories much. James, he likes a good laugh. I love you Al." Harry said.
"Just, please make it quick. Don't make him suffer much. He's still my father."  Nott says, places the glass on the table and walks out of the door, not giving a chance to respond.
"He'll be fine, Harry. He's stronger than he thinks he is. We'll search him." Ginny tries to reassure him.
I go to him and pick him up.  He catches my shirt with his tiny hands and looks at me. I smile at him and he gives me a nice smile.
"We were?" He asks quietly and looks at Harry with shocked expressions on his fake that Harry is sure are fake. "What?" He yells. "You like Malfoy? Malfoy?" He yells and sobers up. "Nope. Can't act."
He turns back to look at Potter who is looking at him with expressions Draco can't recognise. It's peculiar that it makes Draco feel something. It's always done. It's Potter. He always makes Draco feel things that Draco himself can't understand. But maybe he understands Potter in a way no one can. Two pawns of opposite sides used in a war game by adults. Two children with terrible burden of their own which is similar in some way if not all. His mind drifts to what Marina said. Maybe he likes Potter. The idea of this having any resemblance of truth is absurd. They're white and black. Two different sides of chess. Two different side of coins. Three years ago, Draco might have given this more thought. Right now, he can't. He simply can't muster the energy to think about anything. Thinking is a chore he thoroughly hates. Getting up is a chore now, thinking is just more excruciating. He sometimes wishes he could go back to three years prior. A place where his life was all made out and planned by his father and all he had to do was obey. It does takes edge out of things. He was raised to obey. It was ingrained in him. Just like right now, he wishes someone to come over. To take control away from him. To give over and just not think. It has always been easy for him to do this. He just can't do it by himself right now.
He's in here. Harry can feel it. Ron, Hermione and Harry are in the third floor while rest have scattered to check the rest of the two floors. Laughter. He hears laughter. They made Draco say something embarrassing and are  interrogating him. How dare they pick him up like that. Harry breaks down the door. He can feel the anger flare up. He is furious. The aurors point their wands at Harry and with a flick of his fingers, they fly back away along with their wands, falling on the floor after dashing on the wall, painfully. Draco. He's tied up on the chair like an accused and he looks hurt. There's blood running from the side of his lips. Harry clenches his fists.
"We loved having you both as well." Harry said. "Astoria in Hogwarts is not the only thing worrying you, is it?"
Draco does. He blinks twice then turns his face to his side so he's facing Harry's crotch again. Harry's erection can be seen through his jeans and it hardens more when Draco licks his lips. There is a crazy power rush in being fully clothed when Draco is practically naked. Harry undoes his belt and then his jeans. He pulls it down and his cock springs free. He wasn't wearing any pants. He stands behind Draco's head and tilts it all the way down so Draco's throat gives easy access. Draco's entire body is on the bed but his head is unsupported, tilted down to expose his long pale throat wrapped up in the red O-ring collar.
"That guy barely managed to get his bones back. His parents won't let him put charges. They're terrified of Potter." Daphne for some reason thought Draco needs this information.
I swallow the lump in my throat and slowly walk towards Potter. His face is swollen and he definitely had done something to himself to make him unrecognizable. But I'd recognize him and his green eyes anywhere. I've been in love with him since forever. I need him to escape.
Draco walked slowly along the lines in the park Harry had asked him to come along for. Narcissa was out in Paris this week, school trip. Darien no longer had time for Draco like he did once. Nan was with Ralph, it wasn't Saturday so they had made plans. Pansy was busy with Smith out of all people. So Draco accepted. They walked towards the lake and Draco opened the bag of breads to feed the ducks.
"Do you promise not to let anyone purposely know that Theodore Nott will be helping you with the tasks?"
"I'm making honey-lemon drizzle tomorrow. With raspberry dark chocolate sauce. I'll save some for you." Harry asks, looking hopefully.
Potter grabs Draco's hips and instead of smiling in victory, he feels a pang in his chest. He keeps his face staring straight ahead though so Potter can't see his face. The music suddenly stops. Looks like Potter's magic does as he wishes.
Draco stops, Harry's dick still in his mouth and gives Harry a confused look. Harry tugs on Draco's hair and Draco moans.
"This is so inappropriate. I should not be helping you pick up lingerie for your wife." Pansy grumbles.
Harry stood in front of the restaurant, reading the board. 'The Hungry Platter' it read, in English as well as French. He felt fingers slipping on his hands as Ron and Hermione held each of his hands and he felt great comfort. This was just another adventure he will have to muster with them. He took a deep breath and squeezed their hands before leaving it to open the door. They walked into the kitchen of the restaurant and Harry saw an older version of his smiling at them. It was weird that someone could look so much alike Harry. Watching Christian wasn't nearly as weird as watching his forty year old man. Christian was just twenty five.
"Please don't. I already read three pages worth of complaints about how she keeps snapping at Scorpius and another three pages about how she let some other boy touch her hair. And another couple of pages from your son, telling me my son is an idiot. And I agree. My son is an idiot."
"That its the best base for cantros potion. Cancer medicine are extremely difficult and gold is the only metal that doesn't cause disruption in the potion. The best quality is always made in gold couldrons. But then there are potions like pepper up that you just can't make in the gold ones." Draco continued chatting like the auror wasn't there and pretending not to blush at the term of endearment Potter used.
"He disowned me and is taking all the money. I'm poor. POOR! Fucking hell! I'll have to get one of those job things. I mean he can disown me all he wants but why does he want to take my money? I can't live like a poor man! I mean after all the shit he put me through, at least I had money. Lots of money. I don't want to be poor." He whines, his heartbeat fast.
"Just because you're capable of buying it doesn't mean that you become incapable if anyone else is buying for you." Harry replies.
It isn't your fault Bee. If it wasn't you it would've been someone else. And even if it was you there definitely would've been another girl. These people make me sick. I just wish they didn't exist. I'm so sick of it. Our parents are one of them. I'm so ashamed to be called their son.
The way Luna was so different but so comfortable with herself, Pansy couldn't help but feel butterflies in her stomach everytime Luna smiled at her. Theo and Ginny however looked at each other while dancing like no one else existed in this world.
"Mal- Draco, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't understand what you were going through. You're a brave man Draco." He smiles at me.
"He's lost blood. I keep a stock of blood relishing potion. Pomfrey helps me." She explained. She starts sobbing and I hug her. "He's been doing this since voldemort took over the Manor. He won't stop." She sobbed on my chest.
Harry enters the kitchen with Teddy. Draco is sitting on his chair, his food untouched. Belle was right. His ribs were visible, he was just too distracted to think anything about it.
This can't be happening. This is too much. Why is he here? Why now? He already has the school and Potter to deal with so why him as well?
Draco had a drink and suddenly dropped his glass on the floor. Everyone looked at him. He ignored everyone and went to Milicent Bulstrode. He took her by her hair and kissed her. Everyone looked at him in shock. Harry almost had tears in his eyes. Belle pulled him away.
Draco muses. He's still kneeling there as Potter hands him the shampoo back and rinses it off. He's still kneeling as Potter takes the bodywash and sponge and cleans himself. He's still kneeling as Potter is done showering and he's still kneeling as Potter takes the towel from him. He's still kneeling when Potter takes everything from him and places it back where everything belongs. And Draco, he's still stiff and hard.
"I was thinking, let's go down for a walk back there. Take Aurora and Eltanin with us?" Cormac tucks a strand of Draco's hair behind his ears.
So many hands. So many people. Draco remembers that night. One of the most terrifying and terrible nights of his life. He still doesn't know what potion he was given. He remembers those death-eaters enjoying his body while his Father and Voldemort watched. They made his mother watch. He saw as she fell on to her knees, begging them to let Draco go. He remembers how limp his body was. How he could do nothing but lay there and feel the pain, unable to help himself. His punishment to save Potter that day. To not reveal him. To holding the wands deliberately loose so that Potter could get them and escape. How could he not? How could he let Potter get caught. Draco wanted him to win. But is it worth it? This pain, this torment. He remembers watching Hagrid bringing in Potter's body. He remembers feeling empty in a way he never did before, which is a lot to say because Draco has always been empty. A vessel. A body to use. A tool. He remembers feeling the tiny bit of hope he had, lose. It still hurts. It hurt so much. Why doesn't anyone make it stop? Why doesn't anyone ever make them stop?
"Now, Draco." Harry turned and looked at Draco. He repeated in soft but firm tone that brooked no argument. Draco nodded and left.
"Draco, it's you I want. Not sex. I can stay satisfied with my own hands. I'm not going to go to anyone else or force you. It's you I want, my love. We'll go further according to your time and your pace. I'll tell you again. It's you I want. The sex is a bonus. I'll stay with you forever even if I don't get sex, ever." Harry tells Draco.
How can Draco tell him? About his father, about his mother, about the war, about the death-eaters, about all those other men Lucius gave Draco away to.
The courtroom filled in whispers so loud that the minister had to yell at them to remain quiet. And so Potter told them. He told them how Draco refused to give him up at the Manor. Which Draco did. He remembers standing there, looking in Potter's green eyes. He would know Potter anywhere. And he did refuses to give Potter up. He knew a definite yes or no would result in him dead. They needed time to escape and the best Draco could do to give them that time was to say he can't be sure. And just like he knew, Potter's luck worked and they escaped. The rest of the trial went in a blur.
Harry sits on the barstool as he waits for Draco to make his decision. There's a faint rosy blush on Draco's cheeks which makes the glitter on his cheek more effective.
"Oh I remember that there was this pink robe I really liked and I wanted it. I was beaten up so bad at home for even thinking about it. Because according to them, pink is not for boys. Stupid gender roles." Draco said.
"He did. After father's failure in the Department of Mysteries, he was angry. To punish my father, he gave me the task to kill Dumbledore. Which he knew was impossible for me to do so. I was meant to fail so that I can be killed but I tried to prolong it as much as I can so that I can find a way to take my mother away."
"With me you can Draco. You know that. I need you to tell me if something I said or did upsets you. I don't want to upset you."
"Ginny you need to hide. In the room of Requirement. You need to hide. Your brother, Ron. He's with Potter isn't he? Your family has just been labeled as criminals because you'll are blood traitors. They're coming for you tomorrow. You need to leave. You need to hide." I tell her. They all freak out.
"Not possible." I say. "Both of the cabinets are in Borgin's and Burke's." I say and pray to Merlin the Room of Requirement doesn't come in their mind. They're all daft. It wouldn't really occur them. Hopefully.
He raised an eyebrow at Tori. She gave a peep outside, closed the doors, walked towards Draco, sat besides Draco, and cast a muffiliato. Now Draco was intrigued. He put a bookmark in his book, closed it, placed it on the table and turned fully towards Tori. After several moments, she finally spoke.
His magic cracked in the air. The four stood up and hastily pointed their wands at Harry which made Harry laugh. With one wave of Harry's hand, all the wands flew and broke into pieces. And with a make of his fists, the all were binded. The four fell on the ground completely immobilised. Harry crounched down and sat in front of the short woman. He touched her hair and something happened. She screamed so lound that she broke the spell Harry had put her in and fainted. Harry knew she wouldn't be sane again. He looked at the other three who looked back at Harry with wide terrified eyes. Harry smiled at them. Harry pointed at the other women, channeling all his energy through his fingers, gave the other women the same treatment. He knew the pain he was putting them through was worse than cruciatus curse but they had harmed Draco. His Draco. His pet, his property. Harry didn't have much he could call his and he was definitely not going to let anyone harm his most prized possession. Neither was he going to forgive someone who dared to even look at Draco wrong. He still thinks that the women got of easy. Men however, he was going to have fun chasing. He ended the shorter man's spell and immediately he fell on Harry's feet, begging for mercy and forgiveness. See, a year ago, Harry would've forgiven him. But no one who dies and comes back are same. Especially when they've had lived with dark magic inside them ever since they were one year old. Harry laughs at that man and with a light kick on his mouth, pushes him away. He points at the man and sends an extremely painful stunning spell. One after one the spell hits the man and he lays there on the floor bloody and bruised. He finally does to that man what he did to the women, and leave him down, muttering things as a crazy man. He does the same with the last man and leaves them there in that little cottage to slowly, painfully, die through starvation and insanity. And he obviously wards the doors shut with a few spells that will make everyone avoide coming near this cottage. He can't let people come in here and save these people now, could he?
"Ministry along with Dumbledore has banned any and all knowledge of it. It's not allowed to be written. But it doesn't mean the world outside don't know about it. You should check out the history books in literally any other countries. They all learn it and you'll have no idea about it. Everyone outside blames Dumbledore for the war and not Voldemort."
"About Draco's attackers. None of them are sane. The aurors had to get a special curse breaker from France to break the wards you put there and that took almost a week. None of those people are sane and there are signs of abuse. All of them turned into squibs." Hermione ranted with concern.
It takes a bit to manage to stand as his thighs have gone a bit stiff with the kneeling, and the dripping joggers irritate his skin.
"The witch burnings went on for years but it stopped. Slytherins still thought children from abusive homes should be taken away and a seperate house in Hogwarts should be created for them. After that all stopped, the purebloods kept on going ahead with this idea, to get muggleborn children and teach them our traditions and festivals. These traditions are followed for a reason. To keep magic alive. And we were successful in doing that until Dumbledore came along. Dumbledore was a powerful wizard and power has respect and fear. He managed to convince all muggleborns that the traditions we purebloods are teaching are black magic and almost all of us are dark wizards. He started gaining the support of muggleborns and slowly the traditions we purebloods were teaching were thrown over. Some of them were worth throwing over but many of them are still very important. It's to keep the magic alive. We all have a heritage, Harry. Many different ones but we all have it. British specifically have Greek and Roman heritage. Sacred pureblood families contain any of these two or a mixture of them. There are many more brought from other countries like Japanese, Latin, Indian, and others.
"Send me the documents. I'll invest." He says as he turns to run after Pansy only to be stopped by his gran.
"Draco. I will never slap you. You have to know that. I said I'll give pain but not the abuse. I'll stand by that promise." Harry says.
Potter listened to him when Draco said no but its a ruse. He knows it is. No one can stop themselves when it comes to Draco. The abuse, the uglinnes will come out and Draco is ready to be the one who breaks his illusion that Draco can say no. He never could and he never will be able to. Potter does get jealous and angry but he doesn't get angry at Draco. Draco will have to do better. Time to get someone else on his bed. Or well, too many someone elses'.
He hears Draco sigh and scream and moan as Draco cums and Harry keeps his eyes open, not wanting to miss a single detail. Harry drops himself on top of Draco, panting, trying to get his breathing under control as Draco lay beneath him, unmoving. Harry pushes himself aside on the bed and pulls Draco in, makes Draco leave the headboard, holds him close. Draco immediately curls up in Harry's warm embrace and gives out a soft sigh. The patter of the rain can still be heard throughout the room, through the silence. Harry places a soft kiss on the top of Draco's head. His hold on Draco tightens as he hears a sniff, worrying that he did something wrong, that he pushed Draco. And then Draco sneezes.
"I apologise, head auror Robards. The last thing I remember is walking out of Hogwarts." He said with as much innocence as he could muster.
"Give one to Ollivander. Luna? I never came here." I say and she nods. I leave and run to my room. I manage to pass some fruits to Luna for a few days.
I tell them everything about Fenrir Greyback's plan to kill or turn children into werewolves forcefully. And I tell her about how I want to use Room of Requirements to help children escape.
"Teddy. How about we go shopping? I have to buy clothes and essentials for you." I tell and he just snuggles on my chest.
Pansy watches mesmerized as Zacharias Smith speaks on the Daily Prophet radio channel. He's one of those arrogant bastards who haven't yet looked at Pansy. Which is a winner for Pansy because men, they always look. Pansy was the top editor in the Daily Prophet, thanks to Potter getting rid of Rita Skeeter. But while running to make a career in this Slytherin hating world, when she turned turned 39, she didn't realised. So here she was, single and getting old even if she looks like she's 25, benifits of being magical. Magical people lived twice as muggles so they were pretty young till they were 45 at least. And all men who are available are either there for her body, wanting a good little beautiful slave or just sex.
"It won't go. It keeps reminding me who I am. Why are you with me? I don't deserve any love." He sobbed.
Harry caught Draco's hand and stopped him. With his other hand, he caught Draco's hair and pulled him in for a kiss. Lucky for Draco Harry was tall. Draco was tall as well, but Harry was taller. Harry caught is hair tight that it pulled. Draco moaned and pleasure of being kissed and pain of his hair being pulled. Draco caught Harry's neck and waist. Harry bit Draco's bottom lips and Draco gasped. Using this opportunity, Harry pushed his tongue in Draco's mouth. After the intense kissing, Harry finally let go of Draco. They both looked at each other breathless. Harry grinned at Draco and Draco blushed. They both held hands and continued walking in the garden.
"Mad Pomfrey, can you please make sure she's here for a few days? She'll be safe here. Don't tell anyone I asked you this please." Madam Pomfrey nods her head.
"I became friends with muggleborn Slytherins in my second year. And I had to pretend because if I didn't then father would punish me severely and then mother would step in to save me. It would result in her being seriously injured. Sometimes so bad that she couldn't get out of the bed for a few days."
When Harry entered the room, just as expected he doesn't see Malfoy. He frowns. He turns towards the washroom. The door is open which gives him a view of broken glass and tiles and he doesn't even knows what. He holds his breath and walks inside. He looks at Malfoy curled in a foetal position, blood dripping from his temple and his hand. His first thought is that someone came in here but the baseball bat Malfoy holds in his clutches like it's his lifeline suggests otherwise. He crouches down in front of Malfoy and threads his fingers through Malfoy's hair with slow caresses. Malfoy takes a deep breath, as if drawing strength from Harry. His eyes are open but he looks at the floor. Harry slowly coaxes the bat out of Malfoy's hands. He takes Malfoy's injured hand and slowly picks out the pieces of glasses. The ones he can't remove by hand, he removes with magic. He then slowly removes the tiny piece of glass from Malfoy's temple. He cleans the wounds and with some spell, he heals the wounds.
"I swear to Merlin, sometimes it's difficult to remember that you're a wizard. The house is an ancient pureblood home, Potter. The house is magic and it's alive. It understands what we need and provides it."
Draco hates that name. He laughed so much when he read that's what they've named the killer. Potter wasn't amused. Why couldn't they name him something interesting like they did with Jack the ripper or the zodiac? Clearly the wizards don't have much of an imagination like the muggles.
"Why can't you understand I can't say no! I can't! I can't!" He yells after screaming and dashes of the room.
"You should listen to him if you want all your hair attached to your head." Rose threatens that girl and smirks as she runs.
"Like I'm the best thing in the world." And he is. He always was. He is the best thing in the world. Just not Draco's world.
"Professor, I would love to complete my last year at Hogwarts, but I doubt there is any way I can come. I can't leave Teddy alone." I say.
"I'd like to not have any more permanent scars. I don't mind if the marks last a few days. I just don't want anything permanent. And no needles or knife. That's it I guess." He says, not looking at Harry.
"My pet belongs to a Gryffindor now, doesn't he?" Harry asks in return. Draco nods turning crimson. "We can get some other colour if you hate it so much." Harry adds tentatively.
Harry stares in his eyes for several seconds and then firmly asks, "What did I tell you about thrashing the room and our stuff?"
Harry felt his throat close and his hear beat skip. He could feel tears well up in his eyes. He bent down a little and gave another kiss on the top of Draco's head.
Harry silently gave her the letter. Andromeda eyed the letter for several moments before she picked up. Harry held his breath as he watched Andromeda's eyes widened. The letter fell from her hand, so did the tears from her eyes. Her whole body trembled as she shivered. With a wave of his hand, Harry switched off the stove on which the kettle was kept then walked towards Andromeda to hold her. He held her tight and rubbed her back as she sobbed on Harry's arms. After a great while, she finally calmed.
"Are you enjoying the night?" She asks. "You're gonna enjoy more because-" she suddenly stops and looks at Draco. Harry watches as Draco beams at her.
"Waste. Apparantly when mixed with cocopeat and ground rumbus root it loose the expectancy of underwater breathing by 5 percent. Which is weird because ground rumble roots are used to grow the expectancy of underwater plants while cocopeat is an excellent muggle mixture for the fertilization of- You don't care, do you?" Neville asks.
Astoria stops pouring her coffee in the middle and turns to look at Harry as he has done a huge crime.
"Let's go year by year. First year. We both were on the brooms. If McGonagall had caught me, I definitely would've been expelled. You but, became the seeker. The youngest seeker of the century. Second year, flying car. Any Slytherin would be expelled. You didn't. Third year, when you sneaked out for honeydukes. I definitely would've been expelled. Fourth year-"
"She's got it." Draco says cooing at Nura. The blush at being called pretty human prominent on his cheeks.
Its okay Bee. We already knew this was going to happen. So we already spoke to little snakes. They will be as out of trouble as possible. Just select any kid you see first and that's the one you rescue this week. I know it's tough but I'll try to find out which specific kids Greyback is eyeing on. Then we can save them.
They had spent better part of the day sitting near that lake. They had talked out everything war to get it all beside them, to leave it all behind.
"Mr Malfoy. I have a solution for the both of you. I know this is a special case so I'm ready to make a special arrangements. The seventh years and eight years will have one common room and dorms, no matter the house. We have built up a new tower just for you all. I am willing to construct two more rooms. You and Teddy will be having your own adjoining rooms. If you can get a helper to help you babysit Teddy while you are in your classes then you both can live here. Also Madam Pomfrey and Madam Pince have agreed to look over Teddy on regular basis while you will be attending classes. Will that be okay for you?" She says.
He came out with some tissues and wiped all the cum from Draco's ass. He lay next to Draco and stretched his arms. Draco instantly went and lay his head on Harry's chest. Harry locked his arms around Draco and gave him a passionate kiss.
"Now that I know he's not a pompous git, even I can see it. Just dont do anything in my room though." Sometimes when Ron talks, I just want to punch him.
Harry feels something satisfying in him as the Hufflepuff boy's eyes widen and he scrambles back of. Harry turns to look at Draco who is staring at Harry with an unreadable expression. And then without a word, Draco turns back and walks into the carriage, sitting with his back at Harry. Harry sighs and walks towards other carriage where Neville, Luna and Ginny follow.
The blond calls the bartender and orders a drink gleefully which Harry knows is pretty expensive and not everyone will be able to afford it.  Harry gives his card to the bartender to swipe and the blond looks at him intensely.
Harry told Draco about how he was abused as well. He told Draco how he was starved and beaten and jailed in that cupboard under the stairs. Slowly the conversation became lighter and they talked about the things they loved. The date ended perfect with good sex in Draco's room.
"Yes, baby?" Harry asks, he doesn't know where the term baby came from but Draco doesn't seem to mind.
And so Harry explained Nicholas everything. By the end of it, Nicholas was fuming. His trembling hands took Narcissa's and he squeezed it.
"Aunt Romie, I'd love to raise children. I would love to be a father. Can I ask you something?" I asked. She nodded. "Are you alright?"
Harry hears Andromeda sniff. He turns around to see Andromeda's eyes are full of tears. Harry awkwardly places one hand on her shoulder and she pulls Harry in for a hug as she cries on his shoulder. After a few minutes, she releases him, some instrument is still playing a tune in Draco's room.
"Mind telling me why are you ruining a perfectly good dorm?" Harry asked, his expressions and voice neutral.
Cormac persed his lip, wished the healer goodnight and entered his flat. Cormac's father was a waiter in a muggle restaurant. He was extremely young when he understood that it's a cut throat world who will climb on to you to be on top if you don't climb on them first. He had got this flat extremely cheap in an auction after the war. Stability was something he needed and he could use rent money for something else. So he worked in a law firm for 50 galleons a month. He didn't waste all the money in living his youth though. He was in a race in this world and he needed to come first. So he cleared the flat, cleaning it sparkling for yet another one of his executives so that they would give him a solid recommendation on his letter for promotion. This promotion means his salary doubling and he gets his own small cabin.
"So, have you always had hearing problems?" Theo asked stuttering, trying not to offend. He didn't understand how could he ask this without it sounding mean.
Nick walks towards Narcissa then pins her on the kitchen counter. The counter hard against her lower back as she leans behind and Nick pins her hands on the counter. He raises one hand and places it on her eyes. Narcissa dutifully closes her eyes. She feels as Nick takes her left hand and places a kiss on her fingers and then gasps as she feels a ring slip her fourth finger.
Harry bolts out of the room and walks till he reaches an abandoned classroom. He's shaking in rage. He is in so much anger. All the things around him start to shake and soon enough, explode, but not one thing touches Harry. Doesn't even come anywhere near him. All Harry can think about are Malfoy's moans and McLaggen's hands all over his body. Crucio and Avada Kadavra are rapidly feeling like a better option.
"You're so beautiful, Draco. So gorgeous." Harry says as he leans up to kiss Draco, hard, fierce as he increases his speed.
"I don't know." Draco replies. " Three years ago I would've been ecstatic. Now, I just. Talking to you drains me out so much that I don't have enough energy left for anything else. I just don't have the strength to think about this. Or about anything, really."
"Malfoy, I have no interest in your sexual stupidity with those sluts. Just bloody be on time when you've promised." Rose slammed her book shut and left the library immediately.
"Touch yourself." Harry said and watched as Draco's eyes widened as his hand automatically went to his cock. "Stroke that pretty cock of yours slowly." Harry smiled.
He undid the cloth that surrouded the box and exposed it to Mafilda. Her eyes widened and she swallowed. Harry watched gleefully as she started to shake like a leaf. She walked towards her desk at her work station, opened a drawer and took out a bottle of wine. She used magic to uncork the bottle and offered it to Harry silently. Harry didn't move, just remained seated and watched her shrug and take a rather large gulp of the wine. She looked back at Harry, sat down on her chair, took another large gulp and looked back at Harry.
"Yes, gran. I know. Her clothes are so skimpy or tight, she might as well not wear anything at all. She can't speak a sentence without cursing, she calls me a pussy and you a hippocrate, which by the way, you are. She has a very strong personality and she is extremely independent and opiniated. She's perfect. And I love her. I'm sorry Gran."
Harry casts silencing charms and locks the door then lays on the bed waiting. Draco comes out wearing a black lace nighty, black lace panties, eye liner and red lipstick. Harry looks at him and he immediately gets hard. Harry gets up and walks towards Draco. He kisses Draco wildly and forces his tongue down in his throat.
He sits up. Wordlessly, Potter does a cleaning charm in his mouth and his mouth tastes like spicy mint. Not like Draco's that tastes like vanilla. Figures. Potter hands Draco a glass of water which Draco takes it. The water soothes his parched tongue and Draco inhales. He feels somewhat better but his head still hurts. Potter gives him a vial and being the self destructive fucker he is, opens and drinks it without asking what it is. Turns out to be hangover potion though and Draco has never been more grateful to Potter for anything. Well, he has but lets not go there now. When Draco feels much more like himself, Potter gets him a plate of food. Fuck. He has to eat but he doesn't want to eat. He knows he should but he hasn't been eating much since months. He goes days without eating. One look at Potter tells he won't be able to get away from it like he did in the kitchens that time. He sighs and picks up an apple. He chews into it and waits for Potter to come out with the truth. Why is he doing this? Draco remembers. He remembers last night. Remembers Weasley holding him in pity and Granger's tears. Remembers Potter taking care of him. Remembers telling them the truth he had avoided to speak out loud for a while now but the truth his friends know about.
Harry opens the door and leans his shoulder on the wall, sideways. He looks at Draco who is wearing nothing but the black knickers and is laying down on the floor with his legs on the bed. He always plays the guitar in weird positions. He turns to look at Harry as he sings.
Draco immediately curled into him and held Harry tight, silent tears flowing from his eyes. Harry held him tight, whispering sweet praises in his ears and petting his hair. It takes up to 15 minutes for Draco's sobs to slow down. Draco sniffed and looked up at Harry, his eyes red, nose and cheeks crimson red. He's looking at Harry, his eyes filled with adoration. Harry doesn't think he'll ever get bored with Draco looking at him like that.
Draco barely notices the pull of apparation in his stomach. He however notices the quietness of their bedroom and he feels his nerves calm down a little. But he's still unable to stop crying. And he hates crying.  He had tried so hard not to let Harry know this. He can't breathe, it hurts so bad. He can't breathe, he's crying so hard. He can't stop. Harry is crying too. Draco doesn't know what to do. He feels pain, he feels hurt, emotional and physical. He wants to forget. He wants it all to stop. He wants Harry and nothing else. He holds his Harry as tight as he could. He feels Harry holding him just as tight and he feels safe. He feels his nerves relaxing slowly. He's with his Harry. And with Harry he is safe. Harry would keep him safe. Harry won't hurt him. Harry loves him. Harry will keep them away. You will, won't you Harry? You won't leave, would you? Don't leave.
Harry mused. He then with gentle fingers, pushed Draco's hair away from his face and tucked it behind his ear. Then he stared at that sweet arse visible from the net and lace knickers. He sighed and resigned himself to sleep.
Draco could feel the head auror trying legilimence on him, trying to break Draco's wall and enter the memories and he was terrible at it. But Draco was extremely skilled in occlumency. He was one of those very rare people who could use occlumency on veritaserum, a fact he kept well hidden. He carefully broke down his walls and gave Robards fake memories of leaving the castle and then everything going black. Robards stomped his feet in frustration. If Draco wasn't pretending to be innocent and wasn't skilled in occlumency, he wouldn't have been able to control his laugh. Head Auror Robards tried to talk to Potter but with a wave of his hand, Potter cast a silencing charm, effectively silencing whatever Robards was about to say. Robards kept speaking like a mime which finally made Draco chuckle.
Someone knocks my door and I immediately pack my diary in my bag. Its Luna. Diana doesn't like her much and she very rudely asks her what does she want. Luna being a polite baby just politely tells her she wants to talk to me. I ask Luna to sit down on my bed and cast wandless silencing charm so that Diana couldn't hear us.
Why did he just burst out like this? Couple months of silence and this is what happens? Draco's never going in silent mode again. No matter how exhausting.
Draco is still worried about having to go to the Weasley home. After less than amicable relationship between the Weasleys and the Malfoys, Harry isn't surprised. But he thinks that this is as good as a time to bring out this invitation. Draco is calm right now and this might be a good time to get a Yes out of him.
It had been two days since the school had started. Wednesdays were Defence Against The Dark Arts. Which was ridiculous. The new professor was a tall, thin man who was an auror, or so he says. Because Draco knew so much about everyone in the ministry but not about him. Much. Not much about him. Draco knows who he is but not the way he knows about other aurors.
