Harry's face changed then, became a little more guarded - Draco cursed inwardly.
"I'm not," admitted Draco, and fuck, this was weird. "We've had a pretty huge falling out and I don't know if things can be fixed. I want them to be, more than anything," he swallowed, "but if he doesn't feel the same, then I don’t know what I’ll do.”
"God, Draco, my Draco.”
& & &
"Harry," Ginny started, shoving half the bun in her mouth and chewing noisily, "You know that we were destined to be together. I told you that months, if not years ago. It's been decided! So what were you thinking, drooling over a, a…boy last night?"
Pansy nodded, draining her appletini and signaling for another round. "Blaise is right Draco. Harry needs to come around on his own time. He's stubborn as hell, you know this." She smiled at the Muggle waiter and discreetly slipped him her number written on a coaster in eyeliner. Blaise rolled his eyes.
settled down: that I was more than fine staying in and watching the telly with him, that I didn't care that he was a slob, that he left his dishes in the sink and never rinsed them, that he actually used bar soap on his ha…" He stopped quickly. Too many details. "I got scared that I didn't want anything else."
Let him. Allowed him. Accommodated him.
"Mmmhmm – he caught himself a diplomat from Johannesburg, this time, quite a lovely man. I wouldn't have minded a crack at him, myself." She inspected her nails and sighed, presumably over lost opportunities.
Harry took his dinner at a small café, and after a dessert that was both sinfully chocolate, and handily packed with pot, he returned to the Enge Kirkesteed, still carrying his camera around his neck and a small supply of "special" brownies. He walked with more purpose this time, looking for a certain window, but when he found it – or the one he was sure had been hers – it was empty, the light turned off. Harry stood in front of the window, feeling very stupid all of a sudden – and truth be told, more than a little forlorn.
It was almost a week before anything happened - before he had any luck at all.
"It's all right, love - how do you think it will go?"
She – no, he, he had to remember that – sat down and crossed his legs, running a hand through his hair. "So, what do I call you?"
So, Draco would be home tomorrow night and they would have to settle this one way or the other.
“It's pretty much a normal day for you, yes?” He was about to go on, but the look in Harry’s eyes stopped him.
That Sunday, there was a message on the machine from Draco when Harry got home from having dinner with Aaron. "Hey, I'm going to be home Monday night around 6 PM. I hope you'll be home because we need to talk about a lot of things. And also because I've really missed you, Harry. I hope that maybe you've missed me a little bit too."
Blaise trailed along behind them, too amused to stay abreast. Besides, he wanted to be clear of the explosion when Malfoy finally got what Pansy was getting at.
They walked down the street towards their flat, Harry's hand curled securely around Draco's; that simple touch was enough to make his eyes burn and he blinked several times on the relatively short walk home.
Three drinks and two more bouts of dancing, and Draco felt the emotional rigors of his day catch up with him. "I'm sorry, but I'm knackered," he finally had to say when another set of songs began. "But this has been a lot of fun. Thank you."
interested in, is just twisted, and sick and wrong."
Adams looked up in exasperation. "The most rigorous work you've done lately is lip-ups against your coffee cup after Ginny told you your kisses had gotten limp and mushy."
"Yes."
Closer, he could see that Harry was as close to the stone as he could be without actually becoming one with it, that his cheek was laid against the smooth surface and that his eyes were closed. That he could deal with.
"Ah, and Harry wouldn't run screaming, might talk to him, and he might be able to find out what's the matter and be able to correct it, yes?"
Draco had waited for Harry to answer him with baited breath and was completely disconcerted when the tables were turned; he flushed. "Uhm, yeah I am."
"I think so. I think you can be. I think you are." He didn't add that he needed him to be happy – he could never, would never, explain.
Both unruly black eyebrows headed north towards Harry's hairline. "Check in on me? Aww, Malfoy, I didn't know you cared."
"I remembered from last night, oddly enough."
Harry did, even holding a match for him. "Consider that the extent of my grand gestures for the night." He drew back and leaned against the wall a few feet from Draco, ill-concealed confusion on his face.
"Something like that, yes. Have there been any messages or anything left for me?"
It was a good place to lose yourself.
"Hmmm? Sorry, did I miss something?" Harry was watching him, one eyebrow raised in the first familiar gesture of the night.
What would it be this time? Was it his turn to be den mother to new recruits? Did he get to revise the Auror Training Manual – again? Or did he have to police yet another "Equal Rights for Elves" rally?
In the ring, the clowns were tripping over each other, having formulated a new routine that was far from perfected – oddly enough, this seemed to make it funnier and Draco found himself giggling along with the crowd. Then the fire-eater took the stage, followed by the chimera, the dancing hippogriffs and the nifflers playing "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Toad" on the xylophone. A few illusions from the twins – and damned if they weren't good illusions, too - and then the Weasleys took wing.
Harry shrugged. "If you say so; I have no idea where my wand even is. I think it's under some laundry or maybe last year's newspapers but I couldn't swear to it. It – magic – isn't something I need anymore."
He set the cast of the footprint down. "The second incident was, of course, the sticking of the Malfoys –specifically Draco – to their mat, so that they were helpless to move. Since charms are not permitted in this arena, save from Dumbledore, it couldn't be a sticking charm, so Muggle means were used, specifically a form of what Muggles call "Super Glue." Not a substance usually found around here, but Seer Trelawney uses it regularly to fix her eyeglasses, which have been broken many times. The culprit stole Sybill's tube of Super Glue and used a minute amount, mixed with a bit of water, to make sure that the spots where Draco and Lucius' hands and foot respectively would land were coated."
"Yeah, sure, lets."
Draco had no idea what that was, but figured it was some Muggle thing, because this WAS a Muggle club after all. "Does it, to you? Tastes like cordials or something to me."
“Because I love you and I’m sorry I didn’t realize what today was. I should have.”
He smirked. "No, it’s still brown; I just don't give a shit anymore."
He did not envy Bill, and from the look on Bill's face as he took his brother's arm to drag him away and back to the wings, Bill didn't envy Bill either.
Draco had a ribald reply to that, but thought better of it. "Yes, plus extraordinary flexibility is a Malfoy family trait, plus lots of practice, of course. Glad you enjoyed it."
Harry looked at his boss suspiciously, but Kingsley's broad face was expressionless.
Draco stiffened. "Why? So you can tell me I'm a lying fuck? Again?"
"I guess so. Is she – I mean he – with a customer?"
He went to his closet and stared at the clothes there, and without thinking, he pulled out a white tank top and suede trousers that clung to everything. He didn't bother with underwear and paused only long enough to dunk his head in the sink, towel off and rub some gel through his hair, spiking it up wildly – it seemed to work for him.
"With Weasley?" Draco couldn't believe his voice sounded hopeful that Harry might be with Weaselbee.
"Definitely; Bill, for God's sakes, your fringe is perfect. Just stop. You're more of a girl than I am." Ginny applied yet more lip gloss, the better to shine under the lights.
“You are such a bloody selfish git! Why is it always about you, you, fucking
"I will once I give you your jacket back, you idiot- open up!”
Well, all right, just Dudley. He'd been oddly touched by his cousin's last-minute concern for him the night of his birthday, and had gone back to tell him so. Strangely enough, after a few moments of awkwardness, they'd gotten on, and Dudley had introduced him to marijuana, weed, grass, whatever you wanted to call it. His cousin had confided that weed was the only reason he'd been able to tolerate Vernon and Petunia once he'd turned fourteen; Harry could sympathize.
Harry almost said that he'd figured he'd sown most of agricultural England inside Ginny Weasley already, but stopped himself at the last minute. He wasn't sure if that crossed the line of 'shop talk' or not. "Well, if you think it's the right thing to do, sir, I'll take the time. How much do I have?"
It was Harry’s turn to smirk. "Not yet, but if you want to change that, I’d be game.”
She stretched, long legs appearing even longer as the black chemise she was wearing hiked up, almost to the point of showing the goods – almost. Harry swallowed again as her smile widened, noting his reaction. "Well, darling, if you're interested, I have the time in the world as they say. Show me your list and I'm sure I can make you a happy, happy boy tonight."
"Yes, sorry, sometimes my stomach gets irritated. I'm fine."
Well. This was an unexpected twist. Harry had never made love to a boy, and while he couldn't rule the possibility out, he wasn't sure that a girl who looked that hot but was a boy was fair play. He felt duped. Maybe that was what had felt wrong last night – maybe it was a sense that all was not what it seemed.
"Don't you miss it?" Draco was curious about Harry's metamorphosis into something completely unlike what he used to be.
Draco snorted, and then laughed aloud. "I would say so. You have a rather nice arse, so I would hope nothing too untoward would happen to it."
"Draco, I can't do this.”
"I think so; I'm not entirely sure what we are anymore." Harry took a sip of his drink.
Predictably, Sirius’s stone was in the very last row, at the far end near the hulking black trees. Draco cautiously walked down the grassy slope and was absurdedly relieved to see a very familiar dark head bent over the stone.
Their hearts slowly resumed their normal rates as they stood there, impaled and enmeshed in each other for long moments, until someone banged on the door. "You gonna be in there forever or what?"
Darcy sat back on his knees and smirked. "Partaking in all the city has to offer, are you? I taste cocoa and hemp."
Harry didn't let him do anything; he pushed back, he wrapped around him, he moaned out loud and clenched him with his heat and strong muscles and kissed him as though it was the last moment on earth and all he wanted before the abyss opened and took them all, was Draco.
Draco didn't say anything, just thought to himself that this conversation would amuse Potter to no end.
The windows were blue tinted so as not to be patently obscene and run the risk of being shut down, but behind them he could glimpse people moving, see heads thrown back and arms raised. Shadows, yes, and profiles. One profile, at least.
He was grateful to sit down again and the hands rubbing his head felt good; he closed his eyes and tried to relax. Panicking was not going to help. Killing Paul was not going to help, and only an idiot killed his stylist before he was done anyway. Said stylist was now rubbing some sort of sticky substance between his fingers and applying it to various pieces of hair before stepping back and nodding. "This works."
Harry shrugged. "Before you became Minister, the admissions selection process was pretty loose."
The next act involved a skit with the Bearded Lady and the Fire Eater which resulted in singed eyebrows and mustaches all around. Then more clownfoolery and then, finally, it was time to close the show with the Marvelous Malfoys.
It had started innocently enough; both of them tired, both of them just wanting the other to tend to their needs, neither wanting to give, only take. For Draco, that was par for the course; for most of their relationship, Harry had given, and he had taken, and it had gone along like that until Draco had nearly forgotten what it was to be concerned for another before himself. And most of the time, Harry went with it, occasionally rolling his eyes at some of Draco’s demands, but doing it all the same. Tonight had been different.
Still, he wanted to look good, if for no other reason than to show that he wasn't completely lost without Draco, that even outside of a club or work, he could function just fine. He combed his closet for something that bridged the gap between slutty and stuffy, finally deciding on jeans as well, and a long-sleeved blue jersey. He pulled on his faithful leather jacket and left for the Guardian, just a short walk from their flat.
Draco sighed. "Unfortunately for both of us, I do care."
"He still has the scar, the Sectumsempra scar. I saw it when his teddy slid off, and the light flickered over his chest; it's unmistakable."
Deep down, Harry knows that, just because things are more relaxed now and Sirius and Lupin are both friendlier towards him, doesn’t mean they wouldn’t rather have their Harry back. But he still can’t stop smiling. Maybe this will turn out to be his best summer yet, after all.
”Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts and — most particularly — guests!” Dumbledore says in a loud, carrying voice and twinkles down at them all. ”I have the great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable! Now, the Tournament will officially begin at the end of the feast, but in the meantime, I invite you all to eat, drink and make yourself at home!”
”Are you all right?” the man asks him gruffly.
”Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Draco sneers.
Harry smirks, also rolling his eyes. Then, catching Draco’s confused look, he reminds him, ”His Patronus…”
Then he sees it; a hooded figure, darker than the darkness around it, emerging from the shadows in front of Harry.
”Yes!”
. This time, he’s not coming back.”
Swallowing thickly, Harry gingerly releases Draco again and rests his hand on top of his jutting hipbone while he waits for him to catch his breath, hyper-aware of the droplets cooling on his fingers and wondering if it would be weird if he licked them off…
He looks away quickly, just as a suspicious sheen appears in his eyes and clears his throat discreetly. Harry’s hand is itching to reach out to him again, but he resists this time.
”Draco, this is ridiculously. I know OWLs are coming up, but—”
”You want me to give an interview?” Harry asks incredulously. ”To her?”
Immediately the Griffin springs to life and steps aside to reveal the revolving spiral staircase and Snape quickly ushers both Harry and Draco in front of him. The three of them travel upwards in the same tense silence that had trailed after them all the way from the dungeons and it’s so complete, so dense, that when Snape grabs the knocker on Dumbledore’s door and bangs it three times, Harry flinches.
”Right…” Harry says slowly, adding silenty to himself:
But as the darkness fades and he slowly but steadily becomes aware of his own body again, it also becomes clear that he is far from dead. He blinks his eyes open but the brightness of the room stings his eyes and he presses them shut again with a groan.
Voldemort is clapping his hands together somewhere, a mocking show of impression and soon the other Death Eaters join in. But Harry is too drained to lift his head and even if he could, he doesn’t need to see any more… doesn’t want to see any more… he just wants it to be over, as horrible as that is and as weak as that undoubtedly makes him, Harry just want it all to be over now…
As soon as the grilles part, he squeezes Draco’s hand a little tighter and begins to run. They stop in front of the black door at the end of the corridor and, holding his breath, Harry reaches out and gives it a firm push. Just like in his dreams of late, the swings open for him.
”But they arrested Hagrid”, Draco counters. ”So it doesn’t matter!”
Harry can’t contain his grin and doesn’t even bother trying. He eagerly tells the Potions Master everything, whilst tying the message to Hedwig’s leg. Before sending her on her way, he gently strokes the feathers at the back of her neck.
”James Potter?” Draco says and Harry gives him a surprised look to which the blonde shrugs simply. ”His name is in
He then holds an arm out and gestures towards the large desk. In the next moment, two high-backed chairs materialise in front of it.
Sirius and Snape are both watching Pomfrey with avid eyes, but Remus’s eyes are pinned on Harry’s face and there is an intense look in them, but Harry can’t quite pin-point what it is.
”That’s fine”, the man mutters. ”Give me your wand…”
”R-Ron? Are you — are you all right —?” Harry calls after him.
He curls up with a soft sigh, carefully putting his hand on top of the covers so the fabric won’t irritate the cut during the night and is just beginning to drift off when the blonde speaks again.
When he opens the door, the people inside the chamber fall silent and turn to look at him. Harry doesn’t recognise most of them, but he can guess who’s parents to whom just judging by their hair and eye colours and, in the case of a beautiful women with long blonde hair that Harry thinks must be Fleur’s mother, the way she pinches her mouth together and looks around indifferently, which reminds Harry of how Fleur had looked when she’d criticised the Yule Ball decorations.
”Does daddy know?”
”—and I’m not completely useless myself.”
But before he can finish the sentence, the thick blanket of clouds suddenly begin to disperse above their heads and white-blue moonlight showers the three men and the effect on Remus is instantaneous… Harry stares in horror as his daddy’s whole begins to tremble and convulse… Sirius doesn’t appear to have noticed yet, still focused on the trembling heap of a man at his feet and in the light of the full moon Harry can now make out the murderous, almost manic look in his dad’s face…
He remembers Lupin telling him the other Harry also knew how to conjure a Patronus and that it took the form of a stag, like James Potter’s animagus. ”It got lighter again after that, but I still felt…”
”Or, you know, if nothing happens but you still change your mind”, Harry adds.
”But…
”Clearly someone doesn’t want me here this year…”
, his eyes begin to droop. He decides to save the books for after dinner and burrows down under the duvet for a nap instead.
The anger that flares up in Harry immediately dies down again when he looks down in time to see his deep purple potion pale considerably. He blinks in surprise and looks up at Draco. The blonde’s potion is still a dark lilac, and nowhere near the pale pink that the instructions said to aim for.
”You’re no fun…” the blonde mutters. ”The rest of the team are going. And it wasn’t my idea, you know. Flint—”
”How are you feeling today, Harry?”
”What about dad —?”
Pansy shrugs, ”Maybe she ate him…”
”WE ARE NOT RUNNING A HIDEOUT FOR STOLEN GOODS!”
”Wow…” Harry breathes.
”You’re… Dumbledore’s? Not… not
”But by that time, I could see you’d already reached the Cup so I let him go…” Moody continues. ”I couldn’t understand why you were hesitating, why you wouldn’t just grab the Cup… I was ready to kill Krum myself, but then the both of you touched it and disappeared… well, never mind… it all worked out in the end…”
Harry swallows a sigh and drags himself up to standing.
”That’s perfect”, Draco murmurs, ignoring the Irish boy’s joke. ”That’s so you…”
When he’s changed into his pyjamas, Harry decides to get all his books out to assess the damage… That’s when he notices… Riddle’s diary, unlike all the other books, is completely clean. There’s not so much as a dot of ink anywhere on the covers or inside on any of the pages.
Suddenly, a man comes stumbling out from behind a massive oak tree and Harry’s heart jumps into his throat. Steeling himself for a possible attack, Harry fumbles with his wand.
”There’s no way that won’t scar”, Snape says, nodding towards the cut and then swallows thickly like he might be sick. ”They should hear it from you…”
”E-excuse me—?” Draco stutters in surprise.
”Yeah”, Draco exclaims excitedly. ”Granger had her parents send it — they couldn’t send the whole tele- erm, the whole
The Prologue.
When he comes back to the booth, the atmosphere has lifted again and everyone is chatting amicably, even the girls, and when Harry slides into the seat next to Draco, the blonde’s hand sneaks onto his thigh and gives him a gentle squeeze.
”Why?” Harry gasps. ”What’s happened?”
”No, please, stop”, Harry sobs, his tears finally spilling over. ”I know that, please, I’m sorry!”
He catches Malfoy staring at him from across the room, Pansy clining to him like a limpet and speaking directly into his ear, close enough to leave a smudge of lipstick on his skin, Harry imagines. He looks away and scoops up another cupful of punch from the bowl, then watches idly as it refills itself again.
Taking the hint, Harry climbs off the bed and walks around it to his own. He grabs his bunched up pyjama bottoms from the floor and fingers them nervously, glancing over at the tuft of blonde hair sticking up from under the covers on the other bed.
he calls out warily.
”, she mutters to dry off the parchment, before rolling it up and tucking it back into her book bag.
On Saturday morning, Harry wakes up early and lies still thinking about the coming Quidditch match for a while nervous butterflies start hatching in his belly. After half an hour, Draco starts stirring in the other bed and Harry turns over to his side and watches silently as the blonde boy stretches, still half-asleep.
voices, all of them eerie and almost echoing, begins to sing…
Harry thinks feverishly. Hagrid always did get the most absurd pets. Like that time he attempted to raise his own dragon… Not to mention the three-headed dog that guarded the Philosopher’s Stone! Hagrid even named it
But the girl remains pressed flat against the wall, clearly too terrified to move. Harry dives under the troll’s arm and skids across the floor, grabbing a metal pipe and hurling it at the troll. It hits its’ shoulder, but the troll barely seems to have noticed, now glaring intently at the petrified Draco instead.
Harry looks around i mild interest to see almost all the men in the box similarly affected, including the Minster for Magic but not, funnily enough, the Weasley twins nor Draco and himself, and Lucius Malfoy only slightly so; he’s blinking in a daze, but not making any attempts to get out of his seat like the others.
”Say no more, master Barty”, the house-elf begs, sobbing into her hands. ”You is getting your father into trouble, say no more!”
As soon as Harry has finished his breakfast, he goes back to his bedroom and digs the Invisibility Cloak out of his wardrobe, where it’s been folded up for the past few years, ever since his dads forbade him to take it to Hogwarts anymore. His daddy did change his mind about the Marauder’s Map last year when it became clear that Umbridge was out to make Harry’s life as miserable as possible and gave it back to him, but Harry never got around to using it and now it lies, wiped and folded, at the back of his wardrobe too.
The only thing that can be heard is the clicking of pincers and Harry holds his breath, tensing every muscle in preparation, getting ready to bolt or struggle, to fight for his life…
The soft notes of
”Oh, lovely…” Pansy murmurs coolly.
”Yeah I’m fine”, Harry mutters. ”The unicorn’s dead though…”
Indeed, their Head of House suddenly steps out of the darkness like some ominous apparition, his black robes rumpled but billowing more dramatically than ever and his dark eyes blazing with fury. Harry instinctively takes a step back, but Draco restrains him.
Harry’s heart start hammering fast and steadily in his chest, but a sense of calm also settles over him like a heavy cloak.
”Well, I sorta won it, last night… from this fella in the pub…”
? Oh, I dunno, maybe ’cause I have
Harry stumbles back in panic and trips over, sprawling on the floor.
”Are you sure you’ve slept?”
The last thing Harry sees before the Hat is dropped over his eyes is a Hall full of people craning their necks curiously, trying to get a good look at him.
As the snow melts away around the castle and more and more time passes without any more attacks taking place, the dark mood of the previous school term finally starts to lift. Professor Sprout proudly informs everyone that the Mandrakes had started to become both moody and secretive, a sure sign that they were leaving childhood and entering into adolescence… And apparantly, as soon as their acne has cleared, they’d be ready to be repotted for the last time before they could be cut up and stewed, and all those who have been petrified will be able to be cured again.
Seamus nods eagerly again, ”And you said the other one, the necklace, Dumbledore showed you another memory of that bloke who bought it from Riddle’s mum?”
”And Hagrid kept it in a box, like a — a —
”Harry Potter, what a pleasure—!” Fudge says and clasps Harry’s hand eagerly. ”And allow me to introduce you all to Mr Oblansk — Obalonsk — Mr — well, he’s the Bulgarian Minister for Magic, and he can’t understand a word I’m saying”, Fudge adds, then turns to the man in question and speaks loudly and slowly, while pointing at Harry. ”This… Is… Harry… Potter…
, Daphne had commented drily at the time and Pansy had nodded in agreement.
Harry pulls a face in agreement.
”Maybe. Only one way to find out!” Remus says. ”But first, finish your chocolate…”
Harry snorts, ”Yeah, like that’s likely to happen…”
”It felt like a good idea at the time, but I’m regretting that permanent sticking charm now… it was my favourite picture of your daddy, and I can’t take it with me”, Sirius says. ”We were your age when that was taken…”
Harry inhales deeply, and nods.
”We always bicker”, Harry mutters.
Not happy ones either, Harry thinks, feeling a pang of sympathy for the other boy.
”What are you
”, Morfin continues. ”
”Oh no, not you”, he moans.
”Get in — it’s nice and hot”, Draco says, turning another couple of taps.
”I have something to tell you—!” the girl counters, wrenching free from his grasp with a scowl and shoving the parchment in his face again.
Oh my goodness, I can't believe I finished it :D
”The Gryffindor Prefects probably don’t know she’s there”, Harry argues.
Harry hands him his wand and watches nervously as he puts it on top of a brass scale that immediately begins to vibrate, before spitting out a thin strip of parchment. The old wizard tears it off and then holds it up, close to his face, as he reads the tiny writing: ”Eleven inches, phoenix-feather core, been in use four years… that correct?”
Remus reaches out and shakes his hand, then leaves him and Harry alone to say their goodbyes. Draco peers up at Harry shyly through his blonde fringe and Harry barely resists reaching out to brush it aside again.
”Are they going to get really angry?” Draco frowns uncomfortably and Harry nods. ”With you as well? For not telling them sooner?”
, Severus”, Remus grits out angrily. ”I merely want an explanation as to how my son has been put in mortal danger
The others stand up, watching him expectantly.
”Yes…” he mutters and pushes to his feet.
Dumbledore?” Remus growls.
Lockhart’s head pops up from behind the stage again, his wavy blonde hair now standing on end, his hat nowhere to be seen. Another laugh bubbles up in Harry and he has to press his fist against his mouth to keep it in.
”Listen!"
”See you at school, Harry!” Seamus yells happily while gripping his mother’s hand tightly, getting ready to Disapparate as well.
”Yes, I’m sure”, Draco says firmly. ”And as… lovely, as all of that sounds… I couldn’t leave mother alone on Christmas. I mean, she’ll have father, of course, but… just in case he gets called away, you know.”
Harry has to swallows convulsively now to keep the lump in his throat down and the tears in his eyes from spilling over. He
”You’re asking me to choose between Harry and my family, right”, he tells Sirius.
”We’ll all go”, Blaise tells him quietly. ”He’s our friend too. Come on…”
Approaching the second set of doors, Harry quickly scans the words engraved on them, feeling his stomach churn once more, but at the same time a small stirring of excitement sparks to life inside him as well.
Draco scowls and says nothing.
Harry stifles a groan and drags his feet to the front desk, where Draco has once again chosen to sit.
And then willing himself to walk away. Concentrating on putting one foot in front of the other.
”Ah yes…” the man says, in an even softer voice. ”Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon… Harry Potter… You have your mother’s eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow, great for Charms work…”
”Oh, this?” the other twin says casually. ”Just a potion we’ve been working on… We were trying to cheer Ginny up, she’s been really upset since we all found out about Colin — they sit next to each other in Charms — but it didn’t seem to work as we’d expected…”
”Maybe he’s in the Slug Club too”, Daphne mutters.
their way.
”Oh… Fine”, Harry mutters. ”Forget it. I was just saying—”
Harry nods.
Sirius chuckles fondly next to them and cards his fingers through his husband’s hair, then tries to do the same to the mess that is Harry’s hair and gets stuck for a second.
Reaching for the second present with unfamiliar handwriting, Harry glances at the label again. This handwriting he’s sure he’s never seen before. The gift is a lot smaller than the first one and it’s not clothes, because it’s not squishy enough.
” they can hear Professor McGonagall bark as the Poltergeist’s cackles have faded away, presumably as he’s finally decided to surrender and zoom away, deeper inside the castle, to plot his next practical joke. ”
” Harry hisses, but it’s completely drowned out by the reactions of the rest of the students, some of which — the four Team Captains in particular — are a lot louder.
”Yeah, all right…” Harry mumbles.
”What are you two talking about?”
about?” Draco exclaims.
”Nothing”, Harry grumbles. ”Just stop trying to set me up on playdates like I’m a baby!”
”Okay, well, we’re in different Houses obviously… and on rivalling Quidditch teams… so…”
”Oh — ehm — then”, Draco mumbles, tearing his worried eyes away from Harry again and meeting those of the Headmaster politely. ”Well, he got himself bitten by the thing, didn’t he, the clumsy fool. He was dying, properly dying, but then the bird — it — it started crying and the tears — I dunno, the wound started healing up again — but Riddle still had Harry’s wand and —”
”I said…” the blonde murmurs, throwing a furtive look up at the High Table. ”Is it really true you were raised by muggles?”
Luckily, Harry knows of the alternate entrance to the Defence teacher’s office, since his daddy taught the subject two years ago, which means he and Draco will be able to sneak inside without going through the classroom and hopefully, they’ll be able to use the fireplace inside Umbridge office before she hears anything.
”What?” Harry says in a small voice and starts to sit up, but Remus puts a hand on his shoulder and gently pushes him down again before taking a seat at the egde of the bed. ”Why?”
”It won’t do at all. I’m determined to have you!”
Harry is aware that the other boy has trailed off suggestively and that he’s being asked about something specific and, although he has no idea what that is, or if he’s ready for it, he doesn’t care. Because Malfoy has asked him if he
, he thinks, glancing at his notes — full moon
”The Hell you are, I said stay here—!”
Looking into Draco’s face thoughtfully, Harry tries to read the boy’s mood, but just like the day before Draco’s face is shuttered. He gently rolls the parchment up again and sticks it into his pocket, before standing up slowly.
”Oh… okay”, Harry says, getting off the bed as an after thought as the other boy climbs under the duvet and curls up to sleep. ”Okay, well, good night then…”
”Harry…” Professor Snape murmurs softly next to him.
He’s vaguely aware of the creaking of the door opening behind them, but he’s too far gone to care, sobbing freely and smearing hot tears and snot all over Draco’s collar as the other boy’s arm hug him tighter. It’s nothing like the pressure of Remus’ arms around him, but it’s enough to hold him together…
”In which Durmstrang most definitely won’t participate!” the man hollers, showering the former Quidditch player with spittle as he gets in his face. ”After all our meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave right now —!”
You can’t just
”Sorry, old habits die hard”, Remus mumbles and Harry can
”Oh, forget it!” Pansy snaps and spins on her heel, stomping out of the Common Room.
”You’re just looking for excuses now!” Harry hollers. ”This is so unfair! These are my
Draco snorts softly, a look of bitterness twisting his face.
”Er, my dad’s told me about one… is it called the Imperius curse?”
”Come in”, a by now familiar sickly sweet voice calls out from the other side and his stomach flips.
to happen, the Hog’s Head is just down the road. It wouldn’t be the first time that Aberforth—”
”No, nothing”, Harry says quickly before he can change his mind. ”There’s nothing… Sir…”
funny, but he’s cried and screamed enough to last him a lifetime lately, so he might as well laugh for a bit…
detentions—”
”Yes, yes, of course”, the Headmaster agrees heartily, but his pale blue eyes keep darting to Harry as if he wants to say something.
”What do you mean
Remus tightens his embrace again and gives him a weak groan of sympathy as he starts to pet his head.
”Let’s go inside, Harry…” Sirius says softly and clamps a hand down on his shoulder.
When the Slytherins ascend the stairs from the dungeons the next morning, all the windows are a dull white and when they step inside the Great Hall it becomes clear as to why; the enchanted ceiling is one gigantic white blur, mirroring the blizzard outside the castle.
The blonde’s steel grey eyes flit over to Harry’s and a look of silently understanding passes between them, before Draco gives him a small nod and lets him lead them both over to where the others are sitting.
”I promise you, I’ll explain everything when —”
When a fifth of the student body has found their way inside the Great Hall and settled in their seats, a loud yell can be heard from just outside the doors, followed almost immediately by several panicked shrieks and outraged screams.
The twins turn around to face him as he approaches and he can see their green eyes light up in the middle of all that fur.
”Doesn’t matter”, Draco says and shakes his head dismissively, then shudders and hugs himself. ”Fuck, it’s cold… I hate winter!”
His dads just stare silently at him for a long moment. Finally Sirius heaves a tired sigh and turns to Remus.
”Your father and I are not in the habit of
Remus lets go of Harry’s shoulders and grabs his wand, tapping the door once. Immediately, Harry can hear the clicking and clattering of what sounds like numerous locks opening and then the door slides open with a creak, revealing a dark hallway.
there. He reminds Harry of someone conducting an orchestra
Not surprisingly, no-one except Hermione Granger does very well on the test, something Lockhart is quick to point out, having gone through them all immediately while they all waited.
When the thatched roof of the now familiar little white house comes into view at the end of the winding road, Harry breaks out into a run.
But in the end he decides to say nothing, because it feels rather nice to have the arm around him and the body bumping against him if he’s being honest…
”I’m sure”, Professor Snape says coldly.
”Sirius.”
”Harry? You’re okay, it was just a nightmare—”
”But I… yeah, fine…” Sirius mutters darkly. ”I can’t promise I won’t hex her into oblivion, though.”
”Yeah”, he mumbles. ”So, let’s see… a sound you make… er… I dunno, a sound? not a word, but a
”All right…” Sirius mutters, righting his chair again with jerky movements that make him seem petulant.
”It’s just a duvet—”
”Well, we’re really grateful to them as well then”, Remus murmurs, easing his embrace again. ”And we’re really happy to have you back… It hasn’t been as
”That house-elf of Barty Crouch’s”, he says. ”She was found at the scene of the crime and she had your wand in her possession… They checked it and… it had been used to conjure the Dark Mark.”
”And did that make him feel better?”
”, Harry groans.
Harry nods, stifling a sigh. Even now, at sixteen years old, Professor Snape as the ability to make him feel like an eleven-year-old who’s been caught doing something bad.
”The Hell’s this?”
Harry frowns in confusion. Empty what?
get the memory off him when he least expects it.
The Gryffindors give them weird looks and begin to back away, before hurrying down the hallway. Draco swallows thickly and finally meets Harry eyes and even though Harry can see all sorts of fear and worry in the grey orbs, the rest of the blonde’s face is set in resolve.
”Well, you can stay here”, Harry says, instinctively inching closer to the other boy and grabbing a hold of his hand as expecting him to just disappear any minute. ”Right, dads? Draco can stay here?”
Harry thinks furiously.
Barely resisting the temptation to hang his head in shame, Harry bites his lip and meets the man’s eyes.
”Really?” Harry says excitedly.
”I’m sorry to hear that”, Snape says drily, sounding anything but.
Harry quickly got to his feet as well, prepared to restrain Ron in case he decides to actually attack.
”Oh, so the Weasleys can’t come?” Draco asks hopefully.
”W-w-wha— Vol—
When he was really young, he would dream of green light and a woman screaming… As he got older and his dads told him about Voldemort, he started dreaming of this faceless shadow shouting
A deafening roar erupts from the audience and Harry blinks.
”Harry is doing really well”, Remus says, throwing Harry a kind smile. ”But I still think we need to come up with a back-up plan, just in case he can’t get the hang of the spell on Tuesday… It’s not that I don’t have faith in you, Harry. It’s just a really complex spell, way beyond NEWT level…”
”You haven’t eaten anything yet!”
”No, my Lord”, he croaks. ”They are just friends from school… y-you know what… school boys… are like…”
”I know”, the blonde snaps back. ”I said
and Harry allows the grin to stretch his face once more, then makes a show of stretching and blinking his eyes open.
”Everything alright with Draco?” Remus asks with a gentle smile.
”That’s better… so you made Prefect, then? Congratulations.”
”Didn’t you hear”, Harry says, grinding his teeth with the effort to reign his friend in. ”Slughorn’s bringing it out in a minute, just sit down. Okay?”
”That hag…” Seamus grouses. ”Someone ought to teach
They walk back out of the Beasts Section and join Harry’s friends. Krum grabs a free chair from the table next to theirs and squeezes in between Harry and Seamus, then spends the better part of an hour getting questioned by Pansy and Draco without ever even realising it because the two Slytherins are so subtle about it that, unless you know them very well, like Harry does, it just sounds like idle chit-chat and polite small talk. Smirking, Harry sits back and watches the two of them with a fond exasperation.
”No?” Sirius says with a teasing grin as he brings his coffee cup over to the table and plops down in the seat opposite Harry. ”When did that happen, then?”
But obviously Professor Snape has no interest in standing back and simply observing as someone else teaches, so it’s hardly a mystery that he hovers at Diggory’s shoulder, just itching to jump in and take over.
He doesn’t want to disturb Hedwig’s sleep again, having already done so twice already today, so he pokes one of the school owls instead and ties the letter to its leg with trembling fingers.
”Where’s my daddy?” he asks thickly.
”I’m Ron Weasley”, Ron mutters.
The blonde blinks, then quickly shakes his head, ”No no, I didn’t, that’s not what… I didn’t mean… it’s just, I know it
”Ehm, actually, Draco… it’s… um…”
”Well, what if we all just read a few”, Daphne suggests.
”I overheard some girls talking in the bathroom earlier… Someone is planning to slip you a love potio—”
”Muggle?” Draco says. ”Oh no, sorry, nothing muggle. My mother is very… Particular about these things…”
”It’s okay”, Harry says quickly.
Ever since Dumbledore made him admit he’d seen the echoes of Lily and James, Harry has been dreading his dads reactions and as he sits down with Remus at the end of the replica of the Slytherin table and waits for the house-elves to serve them some lunch, Harry begins to tense, expecting his daddy to ask him about it. But to his immense surprise and relief, Remus doesn’t even mention it. Instead he starts telling Harry about the latest chapter in his Defence textbook and Harry eagerly dives into the conversation.
”What do you want to know?”
”I know! I KNOW!”
”Creature”, Dudley grumbles uncertainly. ”There was no… I didn’t see any… anything like a creature, it was just me and—”
Studying the approaching boy’s body language warily, Harry tenses, getting ready to defend himself. But Dudley stops at a safe distance from him, his eyes flitting nervously over Harry’s crotch.
, he thinks, discretely inhaling another whiff before resuming his walk towards the desk.
By the time he calls out
The boy nods, then turns his head to shout over his shoulder, ”Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”
Comments are my inspiration!
”It actually happened once!”
Sweetie…” Remus murmurs and gathers him into his arms and hugs him tightly.
Harry glances at Pansy, then thrusts his head to the side to indicate another door on the left-hand side of the ante chamber. They walk inside and Harry makes a beeline for his animagi potion, brewing in a small cauldron in the corner, whilst Pansy has an idle nosey about.
”It would be awesome if he did win, though —”
”Good morning…” Remus murmurs, his voice carefully neutral and Harry’s stomach flips.
”Who are Tristan and Isolde?” Seamus asks the others in an undertone, but they just roll their eyes at him and sigh. ”What?”
”I knew…” Remus murmurs, giving Harry a small smile. ”I knew the first time I saw him.”
He straightens up again just as abruptly and lets go of Harry’s shoulder so quickly that Harry staggers a little. Then taking a deep breath to calm himself, Remus adds, ”Well, at least it will be easier to keep track of you from now on…”
Dumbledore tilts his head and twinkles at him from over the rim of his half-moon glasses.
Lockhart blinks owlishly at the other man, his own grin fading rapidly as Snape’s smile grows.
. Then Harry feels the cool tip of a nose nuzzle the back of his neck.
Harry thinks numbly, even as the monster keeps thrashing against the inner wall of him, screaming for blood.
”It’s really nothing to worry about, Harry —
He jumps up and hurries down the aisles, scanning the subject signs.
As the days get colder and greyer and the first Hogsmeade weekend approaches, Harry has still not heard a word from Dumbledore about his next lesson. The old man keeps disappearing from the school at regular intervals, just like Pansy had pointed out and Harry wonders if he’s out sourcing more memories for them to watch together in the Pensieve or if he’s up to something else.
”Well, imagine I started choking suddenly…”
It shouldn’t bother him that Draco doesn’t jump at the opportunity to tell him about his dreams, and it doesn’t bother him exactly. But he can’t help but feel a little curious, when the other boy so obviously goes to great lengths to avoid telling him about them.
She gestures vaguely with a small piece of parchment and Harry nods his thanks and holds his hand out. She takes another step forward and hands him the note, with another wary glance at Draco and the others. Harry unfolds the note immediately and confirms his suspicion that it’s from Dumbledore, giving him the day and time of their next lesson.
”So, what, they’re not even going to
”Hi, Myrtle”, Harry says and smiles kindly. ”I actually came to see you.”
Harry startles awake with a strangled scream and sits bolt upright in bed. A searing pain is shooting through his head, his scar burning… Clamping a hand to his clammy forehead and blinking tears from his eyes, Harry looks around in a panic, half-expecting to see a giant snake come lunging at him from the darkness…
exactly
Snape leads him towards the Dark Forest and as they walk along edge of it, a large tent comes into view.
”We’re walking”, Ron says curtly. ”Not a crime, is it?”
When Harry returns to the Common Room, his friends are sitting oin front of the fireplace, Blaise and Theodore are playing wizarding chess and Seamus is watching them idly, but Draco is nowhere to be seen. When Seamus doesn’t ask him if he wants to play Exploding Snap, Harry knows something is up.
guests. Are you sure you don’t want to invite anyone else?”
”That’s all it would take”, Seamus counters.
”I bet she doesn’t even know my name”, Pansy wails, sinking down on the settee. ”Oh Harry, what should I do? How do I get her notice me?”
Harry feels like someone has just poured ice water into his veins. The Potions Master slowly tears his eyes away from whatever he’s been scribbling in his notebook, the dramatically black quill stilling over what Harry imagines to be a full stop, and then he looks up and pins Harry with piercing look.
, a voice at the back of Harry’s mind pipes up.
Swallowing thickly past the sudden lump in his throat, Harry glances up at Madam Pomfrey again. The Matron is fussing with his blankets now, but it’s clearly just an excuse to linger, because Harry catches her eyeing his fork with narrowed eyes.
”Yes, of course”, Dumbledore says. ”Harry, will you wait here for me while I show the Minister the… the grounds? It shan’t take too long.”
”With Prof—?” Harry stutters in confusion.
”Not yet”, Harry says, smirking fondly. ”It’s on the floor next to the bed…”
”Well, I saw mister Weasley, sitting on the floor in some place, I don’t know where… and then he… well, he was attacked, by a giant snake —”
They reach the end of the staircase and Harry jumps off, pulling Draco along with him and the blonde stumbles behind him, grabbing the back of his robes to steady himself.
The older man just nods, looking anything but surprised.
”Is everyone else accounted for?” Hooch says and looks between the other Heads of Houses and they all nod. ”That’s something, at least…”
”I’m not sure… It will come to me…”
… The true Heir of Salazar Slytherin…”
”, Draco snaps at him finally.
Suddenly a bright, silvery swift shoots out of the tip of the man’s wand and soars towards the ceiling. Harry watches in wonder as it flits between the walls, before finally fading away again.
The Gryffindor nods shyly, taking his hand down finally.
, Harry hears himself think, sure he won’t be able to bear it.
… Then he is falling… further and further into darkness, down… down…
”No no no, I’m not laughing at you”, Sirius says, still grinning. ”Well, a little — but I’m also remembering what it was like when I did this — Look, I can’t really tell you what to do, you just need to figure it out in yourself, if that makes sense?”
”Who knows… but we do know that he returned Morfin’s wand to him and stole the ring from him before he left. Now, it is getting late and I do want to show you this one last memory before you go…”
he thinks frantically.
Harry nods, feeling strangely relieved over not having to make the decision himself.
lie, Harry won’t question his either…
Slim, but strong fingers clamp down on his hips and hold him down. Harry’s still sleep-befuddled brain registers very little else after this, other than the bruising grip on his hips and the impossibly hot suction all around him.
he thinks.
Remus frowns uncomfortably and looks away.
”D-Did I? I don’t recall —”
…” Harry says teasingly, sidling up to him. ”But it
Spotting a particularly sharp rock on the lake bottom beneath him, he dives and grabs it before hurrying over to Draco again. He swims around to the back of the statue and begins to hack at the ropes. It’s frustrating work, with the water slowing his movements, but finally the ropes snap apart and Draco’s limp body begins to fall away slowly from the statue.
”But—” Granger begins to protest.
”I don’t have to go”, he blurts out.
”Are you
”Y-Yeah, o’ c-c-course…” Harry stammers breathlessly.
”I’m so sorry, Harry—”
Harry thinks dumbly.
, Harry thinks faintly.
”She does that. I love her, but she can be a real cow sometimes…”
”What’s going on here —?” a conductor says suspiciously as he approaches them.
And that’s when it dawns on Harry that he’s walked straight into the evil hag’s trap.
”I know, but…” Harry trails off with an embarrassed smile.
”Oh, Harry”, the other twin says with his chin propped up on his brother’s shoulder, making it look like they’re conjoined. ”Did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And you’ve met our little brother Ron. Well, see you later then!”
”Oh yeah”, she tells the other girls. ”I can see it now… they really
”Harry, I didn’t mean—”
Harry smirks to himself, picturing what his dads would look like sitting in the stands, reluctantly donning green and silver for the first time in their lives, and makes a mental note to get them Slytherin scarves for Christmas, just to see if they’ll wear them…
”— And there will be no more evening activities”, Snape finishes in a loud voice, sending a glare Flint’s way. ”Unless the culprit behind these attacks is apprehended soon, I regret to inform you that it is likely Hogwarts will be closed.”
A sudden
”Harry, these are my parents”, Hermione says. ”Mum, dad, this is Harry Potter.”
”Not… Lockhart…” Snape says slowly. ”Dumbledore.”
he thinks.
A roasted leg of lamb is waiting for them in the kitchen, surrounded by all sorts of greens, roasted potatoes and a steaming gravy boat. Harry feels his stomach growl in anticipation and eagerly takes his seat at the table.
”Harry! Harry! Wake up, sleepy-head, it’s time!
When Harry collapses into bed three hours later, he is aching in places he wasn’t even aware he had and judging from the muted groan coming from Draco’s bed, the blonde is experiencing a similar sensation. Harry smiles to himself and starts to drift off…
”Vat is this place?” Krum mutters. ”Did you know the Cup vould be a Portkey?”
”Almost there!” Sirius yells over the hum of the engine.
”I’m sorry, Si—” he starts, but the Potions Master cuts him off with an impatient wave.
”I want to talk now, while you can’t slip off, Severus! You’ve been avoiding me —”
”All right…” Remus says and gives his arm a quick squeeze, before choosing the seat opposite Seamus.
”Yeah”, Harry pants.
Hermione hangs her head in shame, and Harry glances over at Draco quickly. The blonde looks just as gobsmacked as Harry feels.
Harry reaches out with his free hand and offers the girl a hand. She takes it gratefully and climbs to her feet, but when she tries to hold on to his hand Draco shoots her a glare and she immediately recoils, blushing.
”He’s not
. ”It was apparently made by Trelawney at the end of last summer, right after the Triwizard Tournament. But no-one was around to hear it at the time. I only found out it existed because Croaker — a particularly scatterbrained colleague of mine”, he adds as an aside to Professor Snape. ”Mentioned having seen the Harry Potter-Tom Riddle prophecy
But it’s a short-lived sensation… As soon as Remus has kissed him goodnight and the only light left in the room is the small sliver breaking through the crack he’s left between the door and the frame, unwanted memories start flooding Harry’s mind… Images of Draco begin to dance around Harry’s head, much like the illustrations of his favourite tales —
”Actually, Sirius…” Remus says carefully. ”It’s not a bad idea to—”
Harry imagines he can hear the tinkling creak of glass threatening to break and looks around discreetly to see where it might be coming from.
The smile slowly slips from Sirius’s face and he blinks, shifting his weight a little awkwardly.
There is sudden flash of red light in the room, and Harry is sure that Moody has fired a curse at him… but it doesn’t hit him. Instead he hears the deafening
he thinks numbly even as his heart is pounding in his chest. He can’t believe he didn’t think of this before. They’d all been so certain that Crabbe and Goyle were the ones behind the attack on Draco, but if they weren’t in that first potions lesson of the year then they couldn’t have stolen any Polyjuice.
The stands erupt in cheers and applause, but all Harry can think about it the horrors that await him inside the maze and how he’ll have no way of signalling for help… how could he have been so stupid? He should have thought about this, he should have asked someone about it…
”Hey, just because you dungeon vamps prefer the dark and damp, doesn’t make it normal”, he says, then rolls his eyes at the disapproving frown on Remus’ face. ”What, it’s just a joke…”
”Caractacus Burke was not known for his generosity”, Dumbledore comments. ”But thanks to him, we know that near the end of her pregnancy, Merope was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that was one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.”
Harry frowns, ”You were?”
”Thanks”, Harry says and punches him back.
…” Slughorn continues, seemingly unaware that his lemoande just got spiked. ”People have always been
Snape just jerks his head, silently urging them to follow the Headmaster and both boys hurry to comply.
He thinks about possible strategies for getting the memory from Slughorn all the way to the dungeons. But as soon as he steps inside the Slytherin Common Room, he forgets about them all.
Three weeks into the school year, after a particularly fun and thrilling DADA lesson where they got to study Kappas — water-dwelling creatures that usually live in ponds and try to strangle anyone they come across with their scaly, webbed hands — Remus once again asks Harry to stay behind at the end of the lesson. They wait for the last students to file out of the classroom and then move into the adjoining office. Remus tells Harry to take a seat and then more or less collapses into his own chair.
Snape takes a point from Slytherin anyway, but almost immediately gives it back after having praised Draco for his and Harry’s potion, the only one besides Hermione’s and Ron’s that is actually successful apparently. Not that Snape seems to think Harry has had anything to do with that success. On the contrary, he seems to think Draco is a potion-making genius and Harry a potential distraction.
Professor Snape’s eyes seem to flash and for a moment the two men seem to communicate silently with each other. Then Professor Snape gives the Headmaster a curt nod, and he begins to stride off the pitch with the now glowing body of the knocked out Draco hovering in the air in front of him.
On the morning of the first of September Harry is abruptly awoken by a sudden explosion of light as the window blinds are pulled up. He groans and curls up, pulling the cover over his head to shield himself from the bright morning sun, but he’s barely managed to secure the fabric around his head when the whole thing is wrenched away from him.
”I’m not really hungry”, Harry says, fighting the impulse to push the tray onto the floor. ”Can I just have some coffee?”
The Gryffindors exchange looks.
”I never
”It’s a group of actors doing dramatic readings of Shakespeare plays.”
”No Second-year could have done this”, Dumbledore says calmly. ”It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced —”
”It’s okay, Harry…” Remus murmurs softly. ”Shhh… it’s okay… you’re okay… I’m going to be right here, but I have to let go just for a second…
”Excellent”, she says after she’s squeezed and prodded it for a good ten minutes. ”All better. After you’ve finished your breakfast, you may leave, Potter.”
supposed to be comforting
perks”, Remus comments playfully.
Harry himself is the perfect mix of worry and calm, in that he’s really worried that he’s going to perform poorly in his exams, but also feels like it’s out of his hands at this point so there’s really no point in actively worrying about it, since that will probably just make him perform even worse, and that thought, oddly enough, has left him feeling pleasantly calm about the whole thing.
Draco gives him a wary look.
”Is he… Is he really…?”
”It’s all right”, Harry mumbles. ”Sure you can’t remember any of yours? Any snippet? We just need the one…”
It’s not until Harry feels a heavy hand on top of his shoulder that he realises he’d been struggling to stand up again.
A sudden movement in Harry’s peripheral interrupts his thoughts and he wheels around, staring at the storefronts wildly as his heart begins to hammer away in his chest.
”But Sir—!”
”Hmm…” Pansy says, studying her nails idly. ”I don’t know that it’s my
”Well, you still have to wait for us…” Remus points out.
”All right”, Sirius says and shuffles over the doorway, but then hesitates at the threshold. ”You okay, Harry?”
”It’s Snape”, he whispers.
Harry is woken up roughly by a stressed-looking Remus who has a rather wild look in his eyes when he tells Harry to hurry up and get dressed, then disappears from the room again in a flurry of movement. The chaos continues throughout the morning. Remus is muttering about missing the Hogwarts Express and tells Harry to hurry up several times, then scolds him for not eating breakfast when Harry decides to forgo it for the sake of saving time.
he thinks gleefully.
”About bloody time!” Seamus says.
”Where you really wanted to go…” Pansy repeats slowly, still squinting suspiciously at him.
”What the hell is that?” Seamus asks, frowning.
”I’m… I’m sorry if—
The seconds of tense silence that follow are the longest of Harry’s life. But finally, the massive creature blinks its eight eyes and starts to slide backwards, back into its domed web and before it disappears from view it calls out to the others, ”Let the human go!”
… when did you become so grown up?”
”Harry, your mother and father would be so proud of you”, he murmurs. ”As is your dad and I… Okay?”
”I see you’re still as pigheaded as ever…” Draco drawls, but Harry catches his lips twitch so he doesn’t take it to heart.
He feels one of the hands on his back begin to move gently and then a nose nuzzling the side of his face, as his daddy whispers soothing nothings to him until he begins to relax slightly again.
After a tense moment, he feels the other boy’s arms snake up and return the hug. They slowly begin moving together to the music again. It’s not the same as before, there is a definite tension between them now.
”Ehm, last time my father hugged me…” Draco mumbles, ducking his head and avoiding everyone’s eyes.
Harry nods and hurriedly gets up from the table.
Harry stands petrified, neither breaking nor returning the kiss. Draco doesn’t seem to mind, though. He wrenches his lips away again and wraps his arms around Harry in a bone-crushing hug, sniffing and snuffling into the crook of Harry’s neck and Harry pulls a face as he feels his skin smeared with tears and snot.
”I’m thrilled to welcome two new teachers to our ranks this year… Firstly, Professor Lupin, who most of you had the pleasure of meeting at the end of last year when he filled in for our last Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, has kindly consented to fill the post permanently—”
grab your trunk!”
Harry slumps over his empty guest list with a sigh.
As soon as they’ve all stepped through the barrier to Diagon Alley, Narcissa suggests a restaurant called
”I have only two words to say to you”, the Headmaster says in his booming voice, holding his arms out so that the light from all the levitated candles in the Hall catches on the many stars and moons embroidered on his emerald green robe sleeves, making them twinkle. ”
”Er…” Hagrid blinks in confusion and glances around at the class uncertainly, then raises his voice and speaks a little more carefully, as if he thinks Umbridge is hard of hearing. ”THESTRALS! Big — er —
Harry feels his hackles go up, frowning at the Headmaster.
He does shoot Harry a glare when he snickers though, as does the Gryffindor girl, so Harry quickly grabs his last two ingredients and ducks out of the store cupboard again before they both bite his head off.
Harry thinks, glancing at the cauldron of Polyjuice Potion again over his shoulder, barely refraining from gagging now at the idea of tasting it.
Remus sounds tired and a little bit concerned, but there’s no real softness in his voice. No worry, no love. Harry lets out a sob and grabs the pillow from the top of the bed and slams it over his head, desperate to block it all out or to smother himself, whichever comes first.
Ron swallows a couple of times and wipes his mouth on the back of his hand.
and think for yourself, Weasel —” Draco grumbles.
then there’s more swirling, but not inside his head, but all around him…
As horrible as that thought is, when Harry thinks of his dads, he feels even worse. Because what would happen if he gets expelled tonight? They would send him home again, on the first train in the morning. Except no-one will be there waiting for him. The house will be empty, and Harry has no idea when either of his dads will be back again…
”AAAARGH!!”
. at. the ready.”
”It wasn’t his fault”, Draco says, earning an incredulous glare from the Team Captain. ”And we can practise fine without a Seek—”
?” Draco exclaims, his voice rising an octave in sheer outrage.
Harry slams the gate shut behind him again and it does appear to be slightly more wonky now… He gives his dad an apologetic look, but the man just pulls him into his chest and wraps his arms around him tightly, clapping him on the back before pulling away again. Remus who has now joined them on the driveway quickly takes his place and embraces Harry and although it lacks the abruptness of Sirius’ hug, it’s just as tight if not more so.
”Yes, but—”
, Harry thinks numbly.
”, Draco agrees pointedly, narrowing his eyes at the girl. ”It
He’s still fretting about it the next evening, standing on tip toe in front of the mirror in the Slytherin boys’ bathroom and twisting awkwardly to get a better look at the robes from all angles. The mirror snickers at him and he glares at it, or rather his own reflection… He hears the door creak open behind him and spins around.
as he begins to wring his hands nervously.

Harry doesn’t wait for her finish, just swirls on his heel and stalks across the room towards the dorms.
”Professor —!” Harry blurts out.
Glancing at the clock, Harry groans. It’s already past midnight, and he’s still got most of the essay left to write…
”What?”

Sirius pulls a face, but doesn’t protest. Harry realises they must have discussed this already, before confronting him about it.
The Sphinx continues to smile. Feeling a surge of excitement, Harry eagerly asks her to tell him the last part again.
. I would have had to drop out of school, transfer to Beauxbatons or something—”
Harry nods silently.
”You’d be so lucky”, Seamus mutters behind him.
”You c-c-can’t — you c-can’t s-sack me — I’ve b-been here sixteen years!
”Harry?” Draco says worriedly.
At that moment, the silver-ringleted witch reappears in the neighbouring portrait, also sweating and panting heavily.
After dinner, Harry waves goodbye to the others and makes his way across the castle to the Headmaster’s office for his second lesson with Dumbledore.
Harry watches the Headmaster take out another phial and is bemused to see the substance doesn’t swirl into the Pensieve as readily as the other memories, in fact it seems to have congealed somewhat and keeps sticking to the phial. Eventually, Dumbledore manages to get it all into the Pensieve and he gestures for Harry to go first again.
Harry thinks with a sigh and decides to walk around indoors instead, turning to trot up the marble staircase.
Draco looks up and meets his eyes, raising his eyebrows. Harry blinks and quickly looks away again, digging through his trunk for his own toiletry bag and a towel, keenly aware of the the blonde’s eyes still on him as he does. As his cheeks begin to heat up, he ducks his head and more or less flees the dormitory, mumbling about brushing his teeth.
He feels the familiar lurch in his belly as he soars into the air. There is a collective intake of breath from the audience and Bagman is shouting ecstatically, but as Harry speeds up all he can think about is the wind rushing in his ears and whipping his hair all over the place… And for a moment, he feels like he’s back on the Quidditch pitch.
… things are slowly getting back to normal after the attack on Mrs Norris — just not for him — but he doesn’t want his dads to worry…
”Can we help you?” Pansy says suddenly.
”Well… actually, I was wondering if you have a date for the Yule Ball yet, because if not I was thinking maybe… maybe you and I could go together…
Harry nods and carefully removes the sleeping cat from his chest and puts her down on top of his pillow instead.
”Still not corporeal”, Harry says, even as he beams back at the other man.
about?”
”No, the Greengrasses didn’t get tickets…” the short man says with grin.
Harry takes a deep breath, then holds it in his lungs for the length of a heartbeat and as he releases it again, he lets the truth begin to spill out, starting with the vision of Sirius being captured and tortured at the Department of Mysteries… As he speaks, he’s aware of subtle movements behind him and knows that the Sirius and Lupin must be itching to jump in and interrupt him, but that they’re both restraining themselves. Harry tells them about the duelling between the Death Eaters and the Order, about Dumbledore arriving at the Ministry and duelling with Voldemort, about Voldemort possessing him… He allows for a short pause in his story, to let everyone settle down again, the name Voldemort clearly causing quite a stir in the adults in the room. Dumbledore inclines his head and tells him to
”Yeah, I know, but…” Harry looks down. ”That’s not all… Voldemort offered him… a chance to prove himself…”
Drowning a sigh with the morning’s first mouthful of coffee, Harry begins to fill his plate with whatever breakfast food is within his reach, ignoring Draco’s surprised look when none of it is scrabbled eggs, which is normally his favourite.
”Ho-ly…” Seamus whispers, his voice quivering with repressed laughter.
Harry nods. He feels weighted down somehow, like all this new information is a heavy blanket draped over his shoulders and no matter how much he tries to shrug it off it just won’t leave him again…
Harry’s mind automatically flashes back to the Duelling Club in Second Year and Gilderoy Lockhart showing him an elaborate wand movement and promptly dropping his wand… a bitter laugh wells up in his throat, but he manages to swallow it down again.
”But… I…”
Harry smiles against the other boy’s smooth chest and snuggles a little closer. I bet I could produce a perfect Patronus right now, he thinks happily and lets his eyes flutter closed… perfect… like this moment… just per—
”Professor, do you know why my scar hurts?”
After he’s opened the presents from his friends Ron and Seamus, Harry starts on the ones from his dads and happily hugs them as soon as he’s opened the last one.
Harry tucks the Quaffle under his arm and swerves around in time to see his dads exchange a confused look.
The library is all but empty, save for a couple of studying Second Years and the librarian herself, Madam Pince, who immediately gives him a distrustful look when he enters.
”Merlin’s beard, Harry…” Sirius says faintly. ”That was some flying…”
Ginny smiles happily and gives him a quick half-wave, before strolling back down the aisle. Harry watches her retreating back with a sense of foreboding and when she disappears around a bookcase he sighs and turns back to Draco.
”Mister Potter, I believe I asked Mister Malfoy and not you!” Umbridge snaps, but her narrowed eyes finds the red mark on Draco’s cheek bone and she seems to come to some sort of realisation.
”It’s usually not that bad…” he mumbles.
By the time they’ve all scraped their plates clean of pudding, the noise of chatter around the Great Hall dies down again and they all turn their heads to see Professor Dumbledore standing, ready to make his speech at last.
Without further ado, Lockhart opens the cage and within seconds chaos has erupted in the classroom. The pixies zip and zoom in every direction, causing mayhem all around them, tearing up books and chucking ink bottles at the students who scream and throw themselves under the desks for cover. Two pixies manage to grab Neville Longbottom by his ears before he’s had a chance to duck down and lift him into the air and hang him up in the candelabra like some great big swinging ornament.
”Yes, Mister Potter?”
Before Harry knows what’s happened, there are arms around him and lips pressed firmly against his own. He blinks stupidly, his hands twitching uselessly at his sides and his lips trembling — and how has he never noticed how dry and chapped they are until now? — he instinctively jerks his head back a fraction and quickly wets them —
“Now really, that’s enough… I’m afraid that’s detention for you, young man. Oh yes, ‘fraid so old chap!”
Mama was happy, therefore everybody was happy.
"Indeed," agreed Kingsley, who had heard wilder stories. "But no, that is not the reason, though I endured quite a bit of heat over that little switcheroo of yours. No, I've been reviewing your personnel file."
Draco looked up, expression incredulous. "Those are hard core, Pans. Harry'd be eaten alive at places like that!"
The Colchester gambit paid off; Harry did call Maggie to see if it was legit, and God bless her, she'd lied her innocent little heart out for Draco, thereby earning her raise handsomely. Draco stayed in his small flat in Paris, Apparating when he trawled the clubs.
“Why?”
"Bill, really. And do stop fussing with your hair." Molly looked around to check the whereabouts of the rest of her brood; Ron was present and accounted for, as were Bill and, oh, Charlie…Arthur, Ginny, yes, right here and the twins were down with Dumbledore. She could just barely make out Percy hiding behind the giant spider, and Harry…Harry was near the clowns, where he had, not coincidentally, a rather splendid view of Draco Malfoy's arse. She sighed, knowing the centerfolds were in for it tonight.
Before Draco could react, Harry moved forward and grabbed Draco's arm, turning it roughly palm upwards. "Bet all your fans think this is just a really cool tattoo."
He closed his eyes as they kissed; the lip ring was exciting, it’s cool metal rubbing against his lips as the kiss deepened. It was a surprisingly gentle kiss, more so than he would have expected, and the touches were almost affectionate, familiar. Again, Harry was struck by a feeling of – not déjà vu, but something, something.
“How did I not know this?”
Ginny's wails of frustration and anger were drowned out by the laughter, and a moment later, she was Apparated away.
Harry had shrugged and handed him the cue for his turn, not saying any more about it; and for the rest of the night, Draco had watched him, trying to sort out all his feelings so that when the day DID come, he could express what was in his heart and head in a way that Harry would understand – and not take as his fault. Because it wasn't, and it never had been. Never in all the time they were together had Draco truly felt like he deserved Harry, or been sure that Harry would want him forever. But the long nights alone – then watching Harry relate to other people who wanted him – and now, talking to him, truly TALKING to him? He knew he was wrong. Harry did want him, as much as Draco wanted him in return; and God, did Draco want him. It was the way he moved; the way he used his entire body to do even the smallest things. It was the half smile that played across his lips or the big open grin, the way he propped his head against his palm and listened to Draco like he was the most fascinating person in the world. It was the offer to walk him home to make sure he got there okay. It was the questions he asked after Draco had told him something, the way he reasoned things out in his mind before saying anything, as if making sure he gave good feedback. It was the way he got shy once in a while and cast his eyes down, then looked up through inky lashes.
Harry woke with sticky eyes and a throat that felt like he'd swallowed steel wool; he cleared his throat, a single harsh sound that quickly became a string of racking coughs.
Anyone else might have been momentarily taken aback, but Draco knew full well he was gorgeous, and used it to his advantage whenever possible. "I don't have to, no."
"He won't accept any of my apologies, Pans - I've fucking tried and tried. He just nods in that infuriating way and then makes some little, pointed comment that just, it hurts. He knows how to hurt me. He's never been cruel before. Okay, nasty sometimes, like when we're fighting and he's pissed off at me, but never cruel." He looked up. "He's acting like - like I never knew him at all."
It's not like they both hadn't looked at online porn before; hell, Harry had discovered it (by accident, of course) and yelled for Draco to come look. They had spent time discussing various personages on screen and rating them on a scale of one to ten - sometimes twenty - but they had done it together.
"Yeah? Me too." Harry stubbed out his smoke and took a sip of scotch. Draco took the moment to look at Harry, really look at him; the messy, slightly spiky hair, the curve of his cheekbones, how his lips moved when he talked, smoked, drank.
Harry stopped him long enough to walk them two steps back, so the wall would take his weight – his knees were shaking with strain of standing straight – and to be honest, it was arousing as hell to see him, Darcy, on his knees, moving with him. Propped up, Harry closed his eyes again, stroking Darcy's hair, his other hand pressed against the wall behind him. He was taking an unusually long time to come, he thought, but then again, he'd been a bit rough on himself the night before, so perhaps that was to be expected.
"That's what he – Draco - did too. He went to a…" Harry trailed off, realizing he needed another drink and waved at the bartender, who brought them fresh ales. "He went to a website where you can pick guys. Like, based on not only what they look like, but how big their cocks are and how long they need before they're ready to go again." He drained half his ale.
“What does this day mean to you?”
Darcy looked surprised. "That was all? Are you sure?"
"Probably because all the times you told him how much you loved him before, you were fucking professional sluts on the side." Blaise had decided it was time for tough love, not to mention that a feisty, even nasty Draco was preferable to the mopey, self-flagellating Draco of late.
"That I'd settled down too soon, too young, that I actually
There were many things Harry could have said in return to that, but he settled for, "He may be drunken and a tad indiscriminate but he always gets his bloke. It will be fine, Malfoy. I can take care of myself."
"Wait, where are you … Harry!"'
It took a moment, but he finally managed to say, "And that was really hard for you."
Pansy did snort now. "What if Harry wants his blondie back?"
Which part of them was bird was the subject of much debate, as the younger Weasleys were rather colorful characters, and they enjoyed encouraging speculation amongst circus-goers.
"Draco." He felt a wave of something wash over him and he sat down hard on the back of the couch. "Hi."
Lucius spoke through tight lips. "Draco, do hush up. This is the hand we are currently dealt, so for the love of Merlin, do man up and stop this accursed whingeing!"
Harry appeared to consider this for a moment, then nodded and lit another cigarette. "Basically."
one could replace Draco, and Harry knew enough to not even try. But for a little while, it had helped assuage his loneliness, helped him feel a little better - but it would never be enough to replace what was missing in his life.
They began to walk again, as the time for dinner drew near. "Uhm," said Harry after a moment or so. "About what she said…I do like you." The blush was back. "I'm sorry it embarrassed you and I'm sure you just think I'm some geeky freak, but," he shrugged. "I do."
Harry nodded and pulled up his pants, giving him a manufactured smile, the same one he gave to his superiors, the Wizengamot, his dealer, and Ginny when she was in a mood. It was sincerely insincere and had gotten him slapped more than once. Darcy didn't look any more fooled than Gin normally did. Damn women – or men, as the case might be.
& & &
Draco grumbled, but slipped into the outfit and looked at himself in the mirror. He did look good, not much like himself, but still good. Blaise nodded behind him. "Okay now.” He muttered an incantation and Draco's face changed subtly; the shape of his mouth was a bit different, the slope of the nose, the contours around his cheekbones. It was not drastic, but it was enough. Blaise nodded, satisfied. "There, you're gorgeous yet not Draco-gorgeous."
She jumps to her feet, Millicent and Daphne quickly mirroring her and then the three of them strut out of the compartment like a mother duck and her two ducklings.
And Harry isn’t sure he’ll be able to look into them and say
”Well, Draco came back without you and he looked upset, but wouldn’t tell us why—”
a boy collapsed on the floor, panting by the looks of it. When Albus Dumbledore appears in the photograph and puts an arm around the boy’s shoulder to gently guide him up to sitting, Harry realises who the boy is — it’s him. Or this world’s version of himself, at least. Swallowing thickly, he watches as the Harry in the photo turns his head to glare back at him tiredly. He’s dirty and sweaty, with several cuts and bruises on his face.
He kicks the the duvet away and sits up, rubbing his eyes and reaching for his glasses on the bedside table. The room slowly comes into focus around him. The sky outside the window is a pale blue with streaks of gold announcing the sunrise. Harry peels his pyjamas off and stands up, arching his back and stretching a little from side to side, his muscles sore from another long night of tossing and turning.
He starts from the beginning and tells them everything he remembers about the dream, about waking up and just knowing.
”I will consult with Professor Snape and Professor Trelawny, and after we have discussed the matter in depth—”
”I’ll come to Hogsmeade station to see you off on Friday”, Harry says breathlessly, after breaking the kiss.
gone for two whole hours”, Seamus says and nods gravely behind them. ”I’m surprised he didn’t owl you a sonnet… or a lock of his hair or something…”
”But… What will you do?”
”Romantic woes, perhaps?”
”It was you!
”Oh, shove off Malfoy! Can’t you take a joke?
…” Lupin calls from inside the house.
He grabs the fang with both hands and pulls it out of the wound. Harry winces in pain, his eyelids fluttering closed. He can feel Draco’s trembling hands press against the wound on his arm, pointlessly trying to stop the bleeding…
”Oh yeah?” Moody says quietly, advancing on him slowly. ”Well, I know your father of old, boy… You tell him Moody is keeping a close eye on his son, you tell him that from me… Now, your Head of House will be Snape, I take it?”
”I’m sorry”, Harry mumbles again.
”It would simply be better for everyone, if Dumbledore demoted him”, Draco says reasonably. ”Hagrid, too.”
Harry’s head shoots up in surprise and he stares at the older man hopefully. Professor Snape scowls back, but then strides into the room and takes a seat in front of the fire.
”Show off”, Draco mumbles next to him, but his twitching smirk is still in place, as is the glint in his eyes.
Still bristling, he barks the password to the wall and shifts his weight restlessly from foot to foot while he waits for it to rearrange itself and let him through to the Common Room.
