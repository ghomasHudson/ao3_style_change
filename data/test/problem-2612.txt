He hugged her closer. “I’ll try my best.”
The message was short. It was nothing interesting, and he felt a bit disappointed. And then angry, because why the fuck would he be disappointed? It was not a romance novel, he told himself.
Daphne laughed softly. “Ah, well. Then you must deal with it, don’t you? Now, I want to talk about Potter’s defence group. No, hear me out!” Draco groaned and tried to turn back towards the castle, but Daphne pulled his arm harshly. He had no choice but to stay where he was. “I know I’m being paranoid, but Astoria can under no circumstances join that group! I know that she has talked to Cho about it and I’m worried that they might get Potter behind the idea. Just – could you convince Potter not to accept Astoria into the group? It would help, believe me!”
The first time Draco had set foot into Umbridge’s office, he nearly fainted from all the pink. Not even his dear friend Pansy loved pink that much.
“So, darling”, he began. “I hope you will not spill my little secret with anyone. That would be very much appreciated.”
He shuddered at that image.
Daphne laughed softly. “I knew you’d ask sooner or later.” She sat up and smiled down at him. Rubbing her eyes, she stood up again and hold out her hand. He accepted readily.
“Please, do not make such a mess in the library. And bring back all the books in the right places.” She looked closely at Potter when she said that and then kept on walking.
And Daphne: using a pureblood solely to produce more pureblood babies. Was that actually freedom? Or was it a hidden dictatorship where only the Dark Lord was able to give redemption and eternal life?
Mission fucking accomplished.
He didn’t have to wait long, until Daphne sat down next to Pansy. She settled down in her personal space, smiling and pretending she didn’t see the angry look from Pansy. The rest of the group tensed, sensing the argument that would erupt. But Pansy didn’t say anything, just kept on eating. It wasn’t until Daphne pushed over her goblet, making a poor job of apologizing, that Pansy finally snapped. She took her Crabbe’s goblet and emptied their contents on Daphne’s head. As a result, Crabbe started screaming, insulting both girls and ensuring that Daphne slapped her own dinner onto his face. After that, Bulstrode got involved, Pansy insulted Daphne further. Daphne now got really angry. Draco stared at her in shock when she did something he did not plan on.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Don’t worry about it, Pansy. It’s nothing.”
Potter balled his hands into fists. “No, I know you know what I am talking about. So, shut up and tell me why.”
Potter scowled back. “Why don’t you open the door?”
His eye twitched.
“They are going well, Professor. I do enjoy your classes, I must say. Learning the theory behind spells is very interesting.” And idiotic. We should learn to cast them ourselves.
When finally Saturday morning rolled around, Draco was in a good mood. Even Crabbe and Goyle picked up on his good mood and grinned the whole way to breakfast. Draco even promised to look over their homework. It was an honour, of course.
Draco studied the piece of parchment. “Your handwriting is atrocious.” He read through the piece of paper and nodded. “Alright. Are these the real times or did you give me wrong times to make sure I don’t go to Umbridge?”
When Draco met up with Daphne in the evening, he was already feeling very tense and anxious. Daphne hadn’t looked at him all day and he was fed up with gauging her reaction. So, when she sat down next to him and smiled sweetly, he felt his blood boil.
He remembered when Weasel had gotten a Howler in second year. Now, he understood how embarrassing it might be and he did not want any part in that experience.
His friend looked as confused as him. “I don’t know what he means with that”, said Theo. “Do you really think that they are in the inner circle?”
Potter’s smile widened. “Yeah, and I’m so bad at potions. And my hair!”
“Oh, Daphne!” said Astoria giving Draco a confused frown. “I was so worried about you! Are you alright?”
Potter rolled his eyes. “He already knows, guys.”
Draco put a hand on her shoulder. He wasn’t good at comforting people. “I don’t think you can. She has the Greengrass genes in her, after all. They are a stubborn bunch, I must say.”
Blaise just snored. “You’re panicking for the both of us, I’d say. So, you take care of her, I am going to take care of this.” His hands went under his underpants and he let out a loud moan.
They fell silent. Draco had lost the little walking man when they tumbled over and he turned towards his friend, who had closed her eyes against the heavy rain. Her hair was wet and glued onto her skin, looking almost translucent. Her robes weren’t in any better shape, now full of dirt and probably smelling like it too.
Draco thought quickly. He knew for a fact that if Potter once thought that he knew what was going on, he would not stop from getting to the bottom of a mystery. Sadly, this mystery was one that involved Draco himself. He had to do something to shut him up or insult him enough that he would fuck off on his own.
Daphne laughed. Her voice was shrill in the empty hallway. She stopped and held his arm to turn him towards her. “You don’t get anything, do you? We might die if she gets caught. So please, make sure she doesn’t join the group. I’m asking as your friend, please.”
And of course, he hated how unconcerned his good friend Zabini was. The man had laughed in Draco’s face when he had suggested to talk about the situation, saying he didn’t give a rat’s ass about Daphne spilling the secret. Draco supposed that was fair. Him and Zabini were, after all, not friends.
She ignored him.
Potter smiled. “Yeah, thanks.”
When they finally were inside again, he send his friends towards the dining hall and he himself went to the loo. He did not want to be seen when he opened up Potter’s secret message. And he had to admit, he wanted to know as soon as possible what the dark-haired man had written down.
Draco held his breath for a few seconds. “And what should stop me from reporting you to Umbridge right now?”
Daphne punched his arm when she caught up with him. “You told me you would protect her at all costs. What has come from that promise, hm? Are you going back on your word now?”
He knew that this would not be the end of his little talk with Daphne. She was too stubborn to consider backing down. He considered his next steps during potions, making mental notes about the different approaches. Maybe he could stop the young girl from joining that stupid meeting with Potter, then she would probably see how dangerous it was to join anything that Potter started. It would be a smart step, making sure she would not be included in any dark activities.
He coughed again, louder. “Daphne?”
Daphne laughed. “Of course not. Why would I ever want to humiliate you publicly?”
Draco smiled sweetly. “Now, Zabini, that’s not true. You know as well as I do what this is about.”
Draco groaned. “Why do I always end up with destroyed clothes when we hang out?”, he asked her. “Seriously, we should stop seeing each other or I will end up without any clothes in a month or so.”
But when he saw Astoria in the library sitting next to Potter, Granger and Weasel, he knew that he was fucked. He hadn’t planned on being in the library, but he had promised to help Crabbe and Goyle with an essay and he needed an old volume from the library. When Astoria saw him, her face fell, and she turned whey faced.
The rest of the day flew by and it felt like no time at all until he stood in front of the entrance to the room of hidden things. It had been no problem at all to lose Pansy. The girl had never been very motivated about her prefect duties. Draco had sometimes made the rounds alone and this night had been no difference. He had told her to stay inside and get some sleep. Which she had done.
“Why are you so afraid of your sister dying? She is not in the inner circle, is she?”
But Astoria smirked softly. “Draco, darling. I believe I know what the deal is about. You have to make sure I don’t make anything stupid, right?”
It had been a rather disappointing evening.
“But still, do you really think that I can protect her? What am I supposed to do? Follow her around and make sure she doesn’t get a papercut? Maybe I should prepare her tea, so she doesn’t burn her tongue in the morning. Or I could punch any guy in the face that looks at her? What should it be, darling?”
“Yes, darling.” She smirked at him. “I assure you the feeling is mutual.”
Of course, this is the moment that the whole situation completely lost control. Pansy and Daphne both pulled hair, bit, and screamed at each other and overall were awful to each other. Draco pulled out his want, waiting for the perfect moment to break Daphne’s arm.
Draco stared at him, not being able to look away from Zabini’s shameless display. When Blaise looked up to him under lidded eyes, Draco turned around and slammed straight into a bedpost. Embarrassed, he ignored his friend’s snorting laughter and jumped down the stairs, taking two at a time.
Sadly, the drama was not finished completely. When he came across Zabini in the dormitory, the dark-haired boy stared at him for a few seconds.
Draco nodded mock-seriously. “Yeah. That’s why the first meeting is at the same time you have detention with Umbridge. Potter, if you want to fake times, make sure they are actually possible times.”
Madame Pomphrey was not happy. She chastised them. And when they finally were able to leave, Astoria was in front of the Hospital wing.
“No, thank you,” sniffed Draco. He held his head high and took her arm. Even if he was not happy about being outside, he still was a gentleman. Sometimes. “You couldn’t afford them, darling.”
Potter deflated. “That’s why I made the defence group. We need to learn these spells. Voldemort is back, and the stupid ministry is not doing anything.”
Draco heard small snickers behind him and pulled his wand. He already had a good spell on the tip of his tongue, ready to blast that bastard to smithereens, when suddenly he heard Hagrid’s booming voice behind him.
The attention turned from hi to the huge professor and Draco saw Potter putting a piece of parchment into his pocket quickly. Afterwards, he walked back towards his group of misfits and winked at Draco when he looked at him.
Draco shook his head. “Shut up.” His voice sounded cold, even to his own ears.
Draco smirked. “What do you think about involving Umbridge, darling?”
Probably destroyed.
Potter shook his head. “Shut up, Malfoy. Why did you break that girl’s arm?”
He breathed out. “Don’t you think that is a bit too long?”
Daphne nodded and hugged him closer. She breathed deeply and when Draco started singing along to the music, she started laughing. He supposed he wasn’t as sure in the text as his friend was, but it was nice after all, he supposed.
Draco ignored his friends and looked over towards the Gryffindor table. As soon as he looked over, he could see Potter’s startling green eyes on him already. When he saw Draco looking back, he cocked one eyebrow in obvious question.
Draco thought that was rather smart. He himself would not give up the timetable for the DA for more than one or two meetings at a time, making sure the other person did not betray him. It was probably Granger who had come up with that idea.
He was glad for Pansy. The witch was his best friend since he could remember, even if their friendship was more convenience than anything else. Her parents and his were close and they had brought her to the manor more than once. He also knew that if he ever needed dirt on someone, she would possibly know. It was a good dynamic, he guessed. While Draco also loved drama and gossip, she always had something to say to him. They did not talk about personal problems or feelings, none of the Slytherins did, in fact.
To Draco’s surprise, Potter nust snorted and rolled his eyes. “I wanted to talk to you about the DA. I think we should meet up and talk how were going to fuck with Umbridge.”
He smiled back.
Potter nodded excitedly. “Yeah,” he exclaimed. “And she told you about the DA in the first place. That’s how you knew about the meeting! And on the same day, you made sure that Astoria would not join the meeting in Hogsmeade by breaking her sister’s arm.”
She, of course, would love that. After the huge fight with Pansy, Draco had sided with the darkhaired witch, which in turn had frustrated Daphne greatly. Afterwards, she had made a few snide comments towards Draco, always showing that she would love to punch him in his face. Well, he had insulted Astoria in front of Daphne, so he had it coming.
Draco laughed softly. “Of course. I will forgive you this time.”
“That went well,” murmured Draco. “You played that shit very well.”
Draco stared across the clearing. Weasel and Granger seemed as discombobulated as he was, while the rest of the class looked like they might die on the spot. Draco felt that silent confusion. He was just as caought off guard as all his peers. Potter did not seem to care.
Daphne laughed lightly. It sounded like a sob. “Thanks, asshole. That’s helpful.”
This was the fourth moment that he was shocked. This girl had the perfect opportunity to ask everything off Draco, and she decided to spend her free spell on protecting her sister? It was an odd thing to do, asking to protect someone. Draco would never have used some opportunity like this in that way. Maybe he would have waited and sat on the free shot, not really using it until he really needed it. Or, he supposed, he would have used it to humiliate the other person, laughing at their expense and trying to keep the upper hand.
“What do you expect me to do about that? I have no influence on your sister, hell, I don’t think I could stop her form joining that stupid group if I walked into the great hall naked and screamed at her like a fucking dementor. I don’t even know that girl. Take care of it on your own.”
Pansy glowered at the other Slytherin and promptly started insulting her. Draco could already feel the tension growing, and he was not in the mood for another pissing contest.
“I hate you.”
Draco didn’t know what to do. He had thought that Potter would love being the saviour of the wizarding world. But this right now confused him: did he not like the attention? Draco knew himself that he would love to be as important as Potter. It would be a dream come true: people staring at him in awe, following his direction without hesitation and waiting on his every whim. But Potter didn’t seem to think the same. His eyes were still downcast but Draco could not stop thinking that this outburst was genuine.
Draco bit his lip. “Well, how I came to the information about your ill-advised study group is not that important, now is it? What’s important” – he looked back to Astoria – “is that you should not join this DA, or whatever it is called.”
Potter laughed quietly. “Well, Malfoy, I think she is correct. And you know what? You might as well keep on helping us, because Astoria’s name is on the list now and if anyone were to find the DA, everyone will know that she signed it. So, make sure we won’t be found out and you will keep on protecting Astoria.”
“Malfoy,” Potter stood up with him. He held out his hand. “I know for a fact that you pulled out your wand. Goyle set his own plate on fire and you used that moment to cast a spell at her. Then she screamed. Ergo: you broke her arm. I want to know why.”
Daphne stared at him the whole day. It got so bad that even Crabbe and Goyle noticed the looks and stared back at her. Draco ignored the silent pissing contest, but Pansy made it difficult. When they left the potions classroom, she took his arm and asked him quietly what exactly Daphne wanted. Draco made up some story about stealing her homework (It was believable, as he sometimes took notes from his peers) and she nodded. It would keep her quiet for now, but Draco knew that the display had been seen by other students. He hoped his father would not hear about it.
He stood up and wanted to go towards the door, but Potters arm on his chest stopped him. The green-eyed git stood right in front of him, slightly pissed off.
Daphne’s eyes filled with tears. “But- “
Crabbe and Goyle never read any of their letters accurately. They probably have heard what was going on but were too stupid to actually understand what happened. And he couldn’t really ask Astoria or Daphne. They would not tell him anything that important, he guessed.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Umbridge had greeted him. “I do hope your studies are going well.”
Draco tapped his fingers on the table. “That doesn’t really matter, now, does it? I want you to pro – “
“I’ll see you in the common room later.” The traitor next to him kissed him on the cheek and started to walk away from him towards the Slytherin common room.
The song came to a close. Daphne pushed the button again and took out the chord and put it back into her pocket. Draco watched her attentively.
Daphne had never been high in standing. Even though she was very social and known among the Slytherins, she never had reached the top of those who mattered. Draco had always made friends with the right sort (Fuck you, Potter) and befriended those that were pure, politically important and in high standing. Even though Daphne fulfilled most of those criteria, her beliefs destroyed a lot. She liked Muggles. When Pansy and she had an evil discussion in second year, Daphne lost most of her popularity under the social group Draco moved in. She gained some in the muggleborn Slytherins, though.
Daphne poked him in his chest. “Malfoy. My sister has heard about some secret defence group, founded by Potter and his friends. Don’t you think that is the opposite of keeping her safe?”
Daphne blinked. “What kind of accident?”
Draco grimaced. “You won’t be happy, I think.”
Draco laughed. And wanted to insult him, make him mad, but somehow he ended up speaking honestly. “I have tea with Umbridge weekly,” he replied. “So she told me then.”
Draco blinked. His heart stopped for a scary second. He opened his mouth, closed it, and then started laughing. What the hell? “Potter, I am afraid I have no idea what you are talking about. But that is no surprise, you have only one braincell after all. Please, leave it to Granger for making assumptions. She may be a filthy mudblood, but she is smarter than you. You will only break your own head.”
Pansy let the topic go, but Draco believed that she would talk to Daphne in private, making sure she didn’t talk to Draco that publicly again. When dinner rolled around, Draco watched Astoria and Cho Chang closely. They talked quietly with each other, glancing around, and making a piss poor job about appearing inconspicuous. He would have to talk to Daphne about that.
“Please,” she whispered. “Please help us.”
When Daphne slammed into him on the way to potions, he already had the feeling that his peace and happiness would be interrupted soon enough. The blond-haired girl took his arm and roughly pulled him away from where he was walking with Crabbe and Goyle, ignoring his protests and we will be late for potions, you berk.
He ripped his arm out of her grip and opened the door towards the classroom. When he entered, all students looked up, but Severus only glanced at him once and continued his lessons. Draco smirked at Potter and his friends. Potter scowled back. When Daphne pushed past him, he followed her towards his usual place next to Theo Nott. Draco would copy his notes, then.
So he walked out of the hall.
Daphne smiled. “Thanks.” She seemed to get the unspoken agreement to not tell anyone. Smart girl.
She laughed. “Ah, of course. How could I forget. I am, of course, under Mr. Malfoy’s worth and dignity. I will never bother you again. So terribly sorry.”
Draco shrugged. “I said I might tell you. Now I don’t want to, so bye.”
Draco smirked. “Well, maybe you break your arm accidentally and have to go to the hospital wing. It would be such a shame if you had to go there, she would miss that meeting.”
Draco’s mouth opened. “So, you don’t have to wait until they finally play a song again? That’s- “He fell silent. That’s brilliant. But he couldn’t really say that, right?
Draco sat down next to the young girl. She was still pretending he didn’t exist, and he coughed slightly.
Draco mentally prepared for what he would have to do when he made his way to the little study group. They were almost hidden, but Draco had spent enough time searching for the most hidden spots in the library that he had no problems finding the four people that were so set on destroying his life. Only Daphne was missing.
Draco set the note on fire, making sure no one could ever poove that he had conversed with the saviour himself. Afterwards he made his way back towards the great hall, making sure to dodge as many points from Gryffindor as possible. Take that, Potter.
She pointed to his shoes. Of course, she was right. He hated that his beautiful dragon boots were destroyed. He would have to talk to his parents at once. Maybe they would finally speak to him again and send new shoes.
His father would hear about that!
Harriet looked at Draco incredulously as she raised her wand to apparate off to work.
Opening his eyes once his analysis was complete, his breath hitched in his chest at what he had seen.
Vows from Outlander/Scottish Tradition.
Draco took a step back from her and frowned as Harriet turned her face away from him.
“Don’t worry about it, Mother, Father.” Draco said coldly to his parents, “What difference does it make if my son or daughter is born a bastard? My child’s just an ‘unfortunate mistake’ anyway, right? So is my love for Potter, I assume? Tell me, did you two feel the same way about me?”
“That’s because I wasn’t there to play for Gryffindor!” Harriet squealed as Draco pulled her close and playfully nibbled along the sensitive  nape of her neck.
A part of Draco wanted to shout at her for it, to reprimand her.
“WWWAAA!”
“You don’t have to be so involved, Draco. I’ll be fine on my own.” Harriet bravely retorted.
“We know that you will.” Hermione said honestly.
The blonde alpha didn't deny himself the pleasure of staring at her engorged breasts which hung out of her nightshirt, temptingly close to his face.
“If I can fight a war, I’m sure I can change a diaper!” Harriet called back.
Her alpha was home!
To distract himself from the mind-numbing, potential reality he was about to face, Draco thought about his experience with the receptionist.
Draco was a tender, gentle, thorough lover.
—————————————————————
If Draco’s wife had gone into heat and the two of them were spending her cycle together, that most likely meant that she would become a grandmother soon.
It was too painful for the Malfoy alpha to concentrate on anything else.
Harriet frowned in response. As Draco looked at the omega, his omega, standing there in the street, with a delicate hand placed over their unborn child and her pink lips pursed together, he grappled with the urge to sweep her into his arms.
Draco’s grey eyes were soft as he watched the omega lower herself into the seat.
“Get out of here, Granger!” Draco hissed as Harriet looked at Hermione and shook her head.
As it is in most situations, the wedding was planned to be for the guests, not for the couple.
The damask curtains were highlighted by the gothic chandeliers that hung over each ornate, ebony crib.
Draco glanced at Harriet wearily and nodded, “It’ll be another hour or two before Mother and Father are awake, let’s lay back down.”
It felt good to Draco to be needed.
Draco and Harriet shared a leisurely breakfast together before they dressed for the day.
Seven?
“Are they going to hurt you?” Draco asked as he looked at the strange medical equipment.
Did he not understand that she slept better when he was there with her?
Harriet looked from one side to the other in awe of the tranquil beauty of the area’s rolling hills and swooping patches of deep, rich green.
Among the papers were advertisements for Hogwarts and several other elite, magical education institutions, some that even offered graduate programs.
While he laid there and suffered through the healing potions that had been poured down his throat while he was unconscious, he forced himself to abandon his dreams of fatherhood, to let go of his idyllic, imagined scenes of having a family with the woman he loved.
He never mentioned it to Harriet, but on some days there were rippling echoes in his mind that he couldn’t ignore.
“He didn’t cry.” Harriet explained with a yawn, “I just knew he needed me.”
“I can disguise our faces with a charm, no one will recognize us.” Draco said dismissively.
Harriet looked down at their baby and chuckled mirthlessly in the darkened room as she asked her alpha, “How can you…...how can you even want me…..now?”
—————————————————————
The amorous alpha waited until his little son was sleeping to claim Harriet and relieve the ache that fiercely burned inside them both.
As Draco held little Rose in his arms, he indulged in the luxurious fantasy of daydreaming that the tiny, bright-eyed girl was his.
Draco left his impromptu meeting with Harriet’s care team and stalked through the house until he arrived back at Scorpius’s room.
“Yes, love?” Draco asked in a husky whisper.
He still remembered the way her belly had felt…..
As long as Harriet had her beloved Draco as her alpha, her husband, and her lover, her hair would stay messy and her cheeks would stay pink, no rogue required~.
“Hurry up, love.” Draco spoke to Harriet with a warm smile and tired eyes as his gaze flickered from her to the baby, “My son is hungry. It’s not wise to make a Malfoy wait~.”
Her tired, green eyes softened when she saw her alpha stomp in and hurry towards her.
It wasn’t anywhere near as intense as the birth of her son, but Harriet weakly held onto Draco and Hermione as the midwife and healer guided her on easing the placenta from her body.
It was bad enough that Narcissa had come barging in while they were lying in one another’s arms.
Draco narrowed his eyes and cautiously stepped closer.
Little Scorpius slept in the wooden crib that he had been provided for the night with his tummy full and his face relaxed, swaddled in the warm blankets that his parents had brought with them from home.
Draco felt his heart sink deep in inner turmoil.
Hermione and Narcissa looked on while Draco sat on the edge of the nest and reached out to touch the baby’s little hand that poked out over the blanket in which he was swaddled.
“.....Nearly there.” Harriet sighed as she rolled onto her side and Draco followed her movement to readjust his position.
Hermione gave Harriet a gentle hug, careful not to hurt the baby in her friend’s arms.
Although Draco had stayed home with Harriet for the entire duration of her pregnancy, once a month, he did have to attend Malfoy company board meetings with his father, Lucius.
“I suppose you two are wondering why I’ve asked you here.” Draco said after a moment.
The middle-aged woman in front of him sprinted down the hall and Draco followed on her heels as his mind reeled and his stomach turned.
Draco blew out the last lit candle in their room before he cuddled behind Harriet.
The air between them was suddenly full of delightfully anxious tension.
After a day of babies, cake, toys, and mingling with guests, Narcissa thoughtfully took over Scorpius’s bedtime routine and let the tired parents go to their room early to get a good night’s rest.
Draco hurried around the room to find what he wanted. He had no desire to leave Harriet alone for any significant length of time.
After their harrowing journey, Harriet and Draco found the imaging department, checked in, and followed a nurse down the hallway.
Harriet wished-
He moved one of the ebony rocking chairs from the nursery into his and Harriet’s room along with the bassinet.
Narcissa Malfoy deeply cherished her son.
A frown of despair was fixed firmly on his handsome face.
When he heard nothing from the other side he knocked again.
He was hardly ever more than an arm’s length away from her.
As the intensity of Harriet’s heat faded, her restless desire died away with the arrival of her menstrual cycle.
Loading a basket full of the candies, Harriet was standing in line at the register when Draco happened to glance across the room from where he was paying for Narcissa’s order at the opposite counter.
Was she already contemplating the best time to leave him and their child?
He had heard the story years ago, but he had buried it away.
Hermione was standing behind the sofa, holding a tray with the tea kettle, the cups, the cream, the sugar, and the biscuits in her hands.
Harriet adjusted well to life at Malfoy manor and with Draco’s parents still away on their business trip, he and his beloved had no interruptions during their days together.
“......Did we win?” Draco asked dryly.
What if-
Harriet inhaled as she cleared away her bothersome thoughts and doubts.
“I didn’t let her go the first time!” Draco snarled angrily, “She left me!”
It had taken over an hour of reassuring and coaxing to convince Draco that it was safe enough for him to leave her side and attend the wretched business gathering at his father’s company.
“You don’t have to get up with me every time, Draco.” Harriet chided quietly as she smiled up at her alpha.
When he looked at his mate and saw her eyes wide, her cheeks flushed from embarrassment, and the wedding officiant staring at him with his mouth open, Draco frowned sheepishly.
Draco’s grey eyes cracked open in the early morning light. The clean bandages on his head obscured his vision as he stared up at the Slytherin green ceiling of his vast bedroom.
—————————————————————-
Draco worriedly glanced down at the midwife as he held one of Harriet’s thighs in his free hand and frowned.
A daughter……..
Scorpius smiled as he returned Lily’s embrace until she reluctantly pulled away.
—————————————————————
As beautiful as Draco always thought that she looked, seeing her in that dress, walking towards him in front of everyone was a startling new experience for the Malfoy heir.
Narcissa was always eager to look after her beloved little Scorpius, and that conveniently freed up Draco to examine and debate over napkin options or potential tablecloths.
Harriet was excited.
Draco’s mother ran around her lavish house, bossing one group of decorators, commanding where the seventeenth tray of cake needed to be placed by the caterers…….
Draco felt his heart clench as he grew suspicious.
Draco tried to force his worries, his hopes, and his dreams from his mind.
—————————————————————
“Babies are susceptible to germs, Ron!” Hermione snapped as she elbowed her alpha in the ribs.
“W-What are we going to do?” Harriet asked.
He prepared small doses of anti-nausea potion for her to safely take throughout the day and the concoction managed to stop her from vomiting, but Harriet’s appetite plummeted.
Did her husband think that she hadn’t noticed she had just given birth?
When the day of the dinner reservations that Draco had scheduled arrived, his smile turned into a smirk as he looked down at Harriet that morning.
Silence fell between them.
Ron came to his own conclusion as he studied the dreamy look on the other alpha’s face.
“So you’re what all the fuss has been about, eh?” Ron asked in a teasing tone as he looked down at the baby and gently touched one of his tiny hands.
“Dobby is so happy to see Harry Potter again, sir!” The house elf declared joyously as Harry carried little Scorpius into the large Malfoy kitchen to make them both breakfast.
Draco was distraught to discover that that had all been a lie.
“You’ve had a hard day haven’t you, my darling?” Draco asked.
Padding silently down the hall and across the house, Draco waved his wand and closed his eyes to peer around the corners using magic.
Draco was too busy gnashing his teeth to engage in any kind of even forced, mildly pleasant social interaction.
It was a great opportunity…but making love was the last thing on Draco’s mind.
Draco had no idea how to get to a muggle hospital without apparating. Besides that, he didn’t even know what one looked like.
“That’s a lie.” Draco replied, Harriet smiled as he kept his hand in place and stared at her abdomen as if he could see through her skin, “I can feel them right now, in there, our little son or daughter.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and stalked towards her, musing over how his Harriet laid in his bed.
Even if his efforts had been successful and he had managed to sire a child, she wouldn’t feel anything the day after her heat ended.
Harriet sighed and closed her eyes as if she were trying very hard not to grow frustrated.
—————————————————————-
“Well, I took an omega….months ago. She…..disappeared. I’ve tried to contact her ever since.” Draco explained, “I saw her again today and she’s…….she’s with child.”
Or rather, who.
Imported stone?
Draco wasn’t foolish enough to believe that Lucius would pay him any kind of compliment, that wasn’t going to happen.
His grey eyes were wide with anxious horror as he lunged towards the reception desk and shouted at the woman behind the counter, “Where’s my wife?!?!”
A frown of apprehension crossed over Draco’s face as his mind lingered on the matter…..
“Of course.” Harriet said, returning her friend’s smile, “She’s beautiful, Hermione. Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of her.”
Harriet was continuing her attempt to ease her discomfort when Draco walked in the room.
“I’ve got you, Potter, I’ve got you.” Draco whispered soothingly to her as he pulled her dark hair away from her face and held her steady over the toilet.
Draco was only interested in his potential children.
With a gentle thud, Draco’s hand landed on the vacant place in the sheets next to him.
“That’s also none of your business.” Harriet snapped again.
Harriet had forgotten all about the classes that she and Draco had attended.
Draco propped himself up on one arm and looked down at Harriet. Despite her abrasive attitude, he took his hand and began to trace soothing lines with his fingertips up and down her belly.
Draco hadn’t kept his hopes too high of earning Lucius’s approval about the baby and he didn’t really care if he received it or not, but the way Lucius had looked at the newborn and what he had said did make Draco smile.
“I don’t have to breathe, Draco. I’ve told you for a week, they’re just false contractions. This could go on for quite a while, you really need to relax.” Harriet huffed.
With a flick of her wand, the healer apparated away and Draco frowned to himself as the healer’s grim warning echoed in his mind.
“I’ve a shipment coming into today – Fotheringham – and it needs to be counted and put into stock.”
He shoved his way through the crowd and dropped to his knees at the man’s side. Pink froth was bubbling froth from the sides of his mouth, eyes rolled to the back of his head.
It was one of the easiest decisions he had made, to move in with Draco. The day he was released from the St Mungo’s, Harry had handed in his resignation, completely sober this time, and found that, for the first time in his life, no-one expected anything of him. It was both terrifying and exhilarating.
An angry Scottish voice barked something at him. With eyes away from the scene to his right he was able to concentrate clearly.
A bell was rung from the bar, and everyone made their way for final orders. He finished his drink and headed for the door. The whole evening had been a bust but at least he had had a pint. The other three pubs could wait.
Nodding, he stepped around his chair and went to put on his Auror’s robes. The fabric was thick in his hands. Shame curled in his stomach to wear it and not contribute. He swallowed the thought down and shoved his arms in the billowing sleeve.
“Fine and dandy? Tell you what – anything that happens to him, I am going to do to Smith. Someone go let him know!” Henry looked like he was debating whether or not this instruction was sincere or not.
The man blinked dumbly and then the corner of his lips turned into a smile. “What would you recommend?”
“No can do – banished remember? Come on, my arse is freezing. Grab your stuff, you’re staying with me.”
Draco looked at him sharply.
When he was sure he wasn’t going to be arrested for stealing a camping cooker he made his escape swiftly, ears bright red and head ducked.
“The hell I am!”
Harry motioned for Smith to hand over the device. He hesitated at first but at Harry’s glare his resolve gave way almost instantly and he passed it him.
Being here, spontaneously, had sparked something within Harry. Something that had been dormant for far too long. It felt good to have it back.
Draco just stared and Harry second guessed himself. Draco had nearly died, this was hardly the time to be dropping this bomb on him; plus, he was probably out of his face on pain medication.
Two men, large and burly were leant against one of the shelves grinning at the scene before them. The leader, Harry presumed from how the rest of them continued glancing at him, as if waiting for their next command and there, in the middle of it all, was Draco.
As he followed Draco’s lead by transfiguring glasses, moving tables, and carving ice-cubes, he began to doubt himself. It was becoming clearer that the woman who had alerted the ministry had just passed by one of Draco’s regulars and had freaked out, rightly so. This caused Harry’s heart to lurch however at the thought of returning so quickly and with hardly anything to show for it.
“Harry that’s not normal. They’re anticipating every move, never missing a step. I mean are muggles just better at sports than wizards? Without magic, does it somehow make up your other senses. It’s weird.”
“Are you the police?” She asked, eyebrows knitting in suspicion.
He had to try another tact. In times like this he desperately missed Ron and Hermione. Ron who would laugh things off and make things feel less intense for Harry. And Hermione who always knew what to do and was better with muggles anyway.
“Well that’s what  a person would say if they were actually doing something nefarious.”
He sat at the small wooden desk in his bedroom which he had obtained by nabbing it off the street, shrinking it and then taking it up to his flat. Shame had prickled the back of his neck as he had dragged it to an alley to shrink it out of sight, but he shrugged it off. Shame was for people that had once held some dignity and after lots of reflecting and even more alcohol, Draco realised this was something he had never had in abundance.
“Very astute of you, Minister,” Harry said, flatly.
What had happened to her?
, professor, can’t you see that –
Umbridge’s face twisted in confusion. “I’m not –”
the son-of-a-bitch.”
Harry sighed, taking his hand and pressing an apologetic kiss to the centre of his palm. “Either will die at the hand of the other,” he murmured. “He killed me, so I didn’t have to kill him. You were right, there
to rely on others.
The army disappeared from sight behind the wall.
“Where are they?” Seamus demanded, looking between the empty road and the approaching army. “They’ll be on us in a minute! We have to go!” He jittered in place for a moment. “Maybe we should –”
Draco’s mouth dropped open in outrage. “Maybe because you’re a bloody cheat?”
Pansy’s heart sank. Blaise had more than fulfilled his end of their bargain. He’d supported their defection to Potter’s side. He’d fought during both the Invasion and the Manor rescue. Without him, her whole plan might very well have come to naught. His support had lent credence to the idea of defection, and convinced countless others to cross over with them. She owed him, and they both knew it.
They all stared at it. It had just occurred to Harry that only Earth Magic could have done something like that, when he caught sight of a tiny blue light, rapidly approaching them from the treeline.
“I don’t think anyone’s ever actually hand-wrapped a gift for me before,” Draco said, touched. “Thank you.”

committed to defecting, he would be free to adjust his plan accordingly. We cannot risk that. We cannot risk his safety, or the safety of the school.”
Draco stared at him.
A line of fire tore down his palm. The one he’d cut, earlier in the night, to get them through the wards, and never healed. The one he’d used to wield the whip, because if Harry had to hurt, then he should too. He yelped, trying to pull away, and she was apologising and saying something unintelligible about

Draco covered Harry’s hand with his own. “I love this one,” he said, honestly. “Although your Charms work could use a little polish. It says you’re ‘home’ right now.”
And he remembered:
Hermione sat in the Gryffindor common room, a thick library book open on her lap. It was a terrible wrench not to be studying, but she just had to keep telling herself that sixth-year exams were not the NEWTs, despite the fact that studying for them really

Trelawney turned back, blinking through her thick glasses. “Ah, yes,” she said vaguely. “The incantation. Very well, kneel in front of the mirror – the true mirror, not the tapestry, and fix your friend and the decision he must make

Then the water hit her. She slammed back into a tree. The water pulled her under. It felt like an eternity, but when she came up, she could hear Katie calling for her. She almost hit her head on a tree branch, and grabbed for it instinctively. She missed that one, but caught another. She swung herself up.
Snape made a muffled cough that sounded suspiciously like a laugh. “Indeed. And if you don’t stop blubbering into each others’ arms like the tossers you

Draco tilted his head towards him. “Why’d you think, Potter?” he said, gently sarcastic.

Still, according to Draco, he and Pansy were writing almost every day.

of him.
Pansy raised an eyebrow. “It’s also said that it was Merlin and Arthur who had that ‘special bond’.” Draco shrugged dismissively, and she clicked her tongue. “Draco, Jeremiah Malfoy may have been the most thorough historian in the world, but our legends of Merlin are just that. Legend. Myth. No more fact than the Muggle versions of the story. We don’t know Merlin and Nimueh were bonded by Wild Magic. For all we know, it’s impossible for a pair of White Mages

He looked so disappointed that Hermione stretched up and kissed his cheek impulsively. “Don’t worry,” she winked. “I’ve been practicing my Disillusionment spells.”

Pansy’s unease grew. “What domain? What is this? Where am I?”
Draco paled, and his hands clenched convulsively. “I –” His jaw firmed. “Yes.

Harry’s lips curved up into a smile. “I love you, too.”
Harry looked at him, and then Draco. “What was that?”
Draco knew what he needed. Hogwarts was as injured and scarred as its defenders. Healing it would take both of them. Air and Earth, Light and Dark. Life and order from death and chaos.
Dumbledore smiled. “Lily’s love for her son certainly played its part, but I believe now it is the love between Harry and Malfoy that will ultimately bring the prophecy to fulfilment. Harry’s death will likely be the catalyst, and in his grief, young Malfoy will strike the killing blow.”
Draco’s thigh was pressed up against his, warm and solid. He remembered their detention together in this very room; how they’d written lines for two hours under McGonagall’s watchful gaze. That had been the first time Harry had taken Draco, up against a wall in an alcove.
“A simplistic version of the truth,” the snake said, sounding offended. “Distorted by time and the fickle memory of humans. A thousand years ago, in the time before the Founders built this school, wizarding-kind lived in fear. Muggles hunted and killed the most vulnerable; the elderly, the sick and infirm. The children. There was no Statute of Secrecy, no protection when the Muggles became aware of a community through one of their own children. Salazar wished only for a place for pureblood children to learn, in safety and in secrecy.”
Terror clawed at his chest, but he pushed himself on. The roar was so loud, now, he honestly wasn’t sure if it was spell-work or their voices causing the earth to shake. He slowed as he climbed the hill behind the Shrieking Shack.
“He is
Atwood took a step back.
“Right,” she said, throwing him a salute. “I’ll do my best, cap’n.”

again and again, taking down their shields. Katie caught on pretty quick, and then she was. The Death Eaters started climbing the slopes, using the trees for cover, just like them.
“Damn straight we are,” Ron said, loyally. “Voldemort’s bloody well not getting the better of us this time. You’ve survived everything else the bastard’s thrown at you. This is just one more obstacle before we can
Harry took a deep breath, feeling the tugs and aches of bruises and what he suspected were cracked ribs. Voldemort had taken great pleasure in throwing him around, torturing him with repeated applications of the Cruciatus Curse, before Draco had managed to break through the lines to his side.
“Shut it, Blaise,” Draco said mildly, tugging a strand of Harry’s hair affectionately.

“In an attempt to convince me to let you walk to your death, yes,” Draco said. “In which endeavour, naturally, he was unsuccessful. He is manipulating people and events to make sure it goes the way
Harry felt his own smile fade. He never had understood why Justin had so suddenly broken up with him, the morning after Harry’s first time. What if he hadn’t just been lashing out? What if he’d been telling the truth? He’d forgotten Justin’s cruel words last night, caught up in the heat of the moment. Instinct had taken over, and he’d come so hard he couldn’t even remember how they’d ended up on the pile of tattered blankets across the other side of the room. But if Malfoy thought Justin was inept in bed… Merlin, what must he think of
“Hurry now,” she encouraged. “You don’t want to be left behind.”

in me. I have no doubt your mate will feel the same.”
The girl murmured something confused and incoherent, hurrying over to the door beyond her desk. Harry didn’t wait for her to finish asking for Scrimgeour’s permission; he knew the Minister would deny him. Anything to get the upper hand in their little power struggle, and with Draco in the Ministry’s custody, Scrimgeour already had too much of an upper hand for Harry’s taste.
He couldn’t stay here. He needed to find Voldemort. He pushed the curtain aside, peering out cautiously.
him to use it. But he was competing with his fellow students for a better grade, not fighting Death Eaters. He couldn’t afford to make any more mistakes like Auror Rookwood. The Wild Magic was dangerous. Especially when he used it, with all the fury of a damaged soul.
Across from them was most of the professors, and a sullen-looking Dawlish, who glared at Harry and Draco. Harry’s best friends were squashed in another corner, behind Kingsley Shacklebolt. Pansy hadn’t been invited, which didn’t particularly surprise Draco. Not

“No true Slytherin would ever allow themselves to be blinded by love,” Pansy countered. “And Draco is, above all, a Slytherin.”

As for Potter’s desperate, pitiful plea for help… it would not save him. It would not save any of them.
“Now’s –”
“Amenable to Potter’s overtures?” Pansy regarded him seriously. “I’ll give it some thought. You have to understand, though – Potter has an uphill battle ahead of him. Draco is in a perilous situation, and it isn’t just a petty, childish grudge he has against Potter. His father is in Azkaban because of him.”
“Malfoy Manor,” Snape said, grasping Harry’s shoulder and twisting on his heel.
“Probably this is not exactly what you’d call a
As a consequence, Zabini walked around like the kneazle who got the cream, smirking at Dean and Ron both. Ron because he had had a very public screaming match with Ginny about her relationship with Zabini, during which Ginny had accused him of being prejudiced against Slytherins, and Ron retorted that he had no such problem with

Poor Lexie. They’d been in the Great Hall when the loyalists attacked. The spells had come so suddenly that almost no one had been able to react in time. Most of them hadn’t even managed to pull out their wands before it was all over. Lexie had been hit with a Vomiting Curse. She’d vomited up everything in her stomach in seconds, and then she was just retching, her body convulsing, face pasty-white. Madam Pomfrey had classified her category one immediately. The Vomiting Curse was only meant to last as long as there were stomach contents to be vomited out. Whatever this variation was would make her keep trying to vomit until she died of exhaustion or starvation. It was horrible.
Ron’s mouth fell open, and Hermione gasped.
The Three Broomsticks was heaving with loud, rowdy students. Draco bypassed the popular pub, leading Potter instead to the Hog’s Head Inn, where it was dark and quiet.
Draco sighed, carding a hand through his hair. “I didn’t choose this. Potter is the Dark Lord’s mortal enemy. There’s a fucking

Draco sneered, fear sharpening his tongue. “Is that it? The best you can do? How long did you practice that spell without a wand before you got it right? Years? Decades? Can you perform
singed his hair. He flinched. Granger had deflected it for him. “Look out!” she cried, eyes on someone behind him.
The Three Broomsticks was a scene of utter chaos; students spilling out of the pub, others trying to push their way inside. One of the front windows was blown out, and the crunch of glass was audible over the screams and shouts of the crowd.
. I know you. If you could have saved Quirrell, you would have. The only reason you even survived is because of your mother’s sacrifice. And maybe that changed you – how could it not? – but it didn’t corrupt your soul.”
Draco watched it fly.
Harry shook his head, glancing around. There was a large chest at the bottom of the bed, again with the Malfoy crest, and a desk near the door with Malfoy’s textbooks lined up neatly on the shelves above. There was a small fireplace, an armchair, a large walk-in robe with the door just ajar, and a chest of drawers in the corner.
“The Room of Requirement, Harry,” Hermione said, softly. “This is your way inside.” His eyes snapped to hers, and she smiled at him self-deprecatingly. “I wouldn’t blame you if you said I told you so.”
He hadn’t killed Voldemort alone. Draco had been right there with him, and they couldn’t have done it without Ron and Hermione, and Neville, and the Order, and the staff and students and families of Hogwarts; mothers and fathers and children fighting side-by-side.
She walked with him down to the sixth-year dorms, pitching her voice very low. “You know I won’t ask questions, love, but Madam Rosmerta… she’s not one of us. I assume that means you have something on her, or you’re controlling her somehow. But she was very – vague, this afternoon. I’m worried your control might be slipping.”
“My boyfriend is the

“We’re all fine,” Ginny assured him. “Dad and Fleur were injured, but they’re both up and about now. Charlie’s healing a bit slower; he was outside the wards when you reversed everything. But he’s in good spirits, considering. And the twins are both fine, thanks to Malfoy.”
Harry just smirked back at him, pleased by the return of some of that old Malfoy antagonism. “Not at all,” he replied. “Anyway, as I recall, you got your just desserts in the end.”
The whole school was in an uproar when Harry and Draco arrived back at the castle.
afford to behave as if he had something to hide. There was no reason they should know this was where he’d been working on his task… No reason except, of course, if Potter had told them. He couldn’t afford to rule that out. But otherwise, as far as they were concerned, this was just the place Potter had chosen to Apparate them to.

At his feet, the giant snake reared up. The kelpie froze. Nagini struck. The kelpie didn’t move fast enough. It screamed, thrashing. Nagini slithered around to attack the snakes.

A few hesitant hands went up, and Madam Pomfrey bustled down into the hall.

Draco lay on his back on the picnic rug, one hand behind his head, the other trailing idly through the cool water of the stream. Occasionally his knuckles would brush one of the leaves, sending it spinning off in another direction, and the musical tinkle of a tiny faerie’s delighted laughter would fill the air.
Hermione flushed. “Oh, quiet, you,” she said, shoving at his shoulder.
Draco moaned and struggled to push into Harry’s grip. Harry just laughed and kissed him, pinning his hips down and keeping up the slow, almost-there strokes. “Just enjoy it,” he said softly.
“Where they should have been all along,” Hermione said, in satisfaction. “That was very well done of you, Harry.”
Agrippa raised his hat. His portrait was half-hanging off the wall, torn and burned at one edge. The angle made it look almost comical. “Young Tonks,” he said. “Pleasure to see you again, circumstances notwithstanding. I wish you well.” He leaned down, and added darkly, “

“You know everything I do, Ron,” he said. “You know the prophecy. If I don’t make it, at least my Horcrux will be dead, too. After they’re all destroyed, it doesn’t matter who ends it.”
The Aurors ushered them through an enormous door into a courtroom that was easily three times the size of the one Harry had been tried in. There were already hundreds of people crammed into every bench and up the aisles.
“Allow me,” said George.
Cardosa began to wake at last, and Draco cast another vicious Stunner at him. He didn’t have much time. The Dark Lord might have given every appearance of trusting him, but Draco knew that that was a dangerous illusion.
“Idiot boy,” he said, with a good deal more fondness than Harry thought entirely appropriate for a professor who hated his guts. “The slip-through in the wards is for the Alphas. Not you. You need every advantage you can get, even if – even if it will never be really
Harry laughed, and obediently summoned his own wand with a wave of his hand. His lips didn’t move. Draco snorted, shaking his head, and Harry grinned back at him, using his wand to light a roaring fire, clean them up, and settle them back down with the covers pulled up to their chins. Draco gazed at him, brushing a lock of hair out of Harry’s eyes. It was so lovely to see him happy again. To see him smiling, and laughing, as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders. As if –
Harry rolled his eyes, rescuing their tiny vial of shimmering gold from her. “Your wand is vine wood, Hermione. It’s perfect for you.”
He grimaced, but shut his mouth.
Harry felt his chest tighten. He couldn’t speak; just nodded.
ridiculous, mate,” Ron said, helpfully.
Harry looked, suddenly, wide awake. “Talk?” he said, apprehensively.
Hermione patted his arm. “I’m sure there’s nothing to worry about. Can you really imagine the Malfoys allowing spiders to sully their pristine home? They probably have wards specifically to keep them out.”
Harry’s brow wrinkled. “I don’t understand. Dumbledore’s never said... if he thinks I can’t die, why did he tell me I had to?”
He made a strangled noise halfway between a yelp and a scream. “Fuck, fuck,
Pansy tried very hard not to think about the thin summer tunic she was wearing. Dozens of students and professors and parents were coming back into view, all in their underwear, running for the bridge. A few were injured. Two Aurors – Greene and Savage – were levitating half-a-dozen in front of them. Rosmerta was limping, arm around Potter’s shoulders.
“Oh, baby,” his mother breathed, cupping his face in her hands. She bent to cover his cheeks and forehead with kisses. “Oh, my darling. I thought I’d lost you. Don’t you
“It was not difficult, my lord,” Draco said, and Harry gritted his teeth at the cringing, subservient tone. “Dumbledore penetrated my shields last week. I broke eye contact immediately, but he knew it was possible. I used that to my advantage yesterday; allowed him through my shields, and then projected such terror at him that he had no choice but to believe I feared him. Not to mention my…
“Fine!” Draco called. He raised his arms. A shield Harry had never seen before shot up around the wolf. The floor; flagstones warping and twisting up into a wall to protect them – as if the ground itself had answered Draco’s call.
He ran, with Harry by his side. Somehow they were faster together, as if there was a wind at their backs, propelling them on. They took a corner and ran straight into Draco’s friends. He skidded to a stop, jerking Harry off-balance. Harry stumbled, and Draco steadied him instinctively.
It was flattering, in a way. That Draco trusted him enough to let his guard down in such an intensely private way, in amongst a group of Gryffindors. Not to mention he needed every minute of sleep he got. Harry wasn’t cruel enough to wake him just to point out the state he’d left Harry in, with no way to relieve himself.

Malfoy turned on his heel without responding, and Harry wandered off in the other direction, whistling.
“Exactly,” Hermione said. “You need to be careful. Parkinson’s story sounds credible, second-hand, but Seamus isn’t exactly objective when it comes to her. If Malfoy’s in on it, and he gains your trust…”
Hermione reached out to clasp his hand, and they exchanged a look. As one, they lifted their hands to put them over Harry's. A hard lump formed in Harry's throat, and, shakily, he put his other hand over theirs, squeezing tightly.

, and he knew that she knew it.
Malfoy opened his mouth, and then closed it again, slowly. He looked thoughtful, suddenly. Hermione eyed him suspiciously. Malfoy wasn’t one to yield that easily. Did he know something they didn’t?
She stared, unable to look away.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, deciding obfuscation would probably be better than a flat denial. “I’ve been able to talk to snakes since before I can remember.”
She only just had time to turn away before she was heaving. Vomit spattered the floor already stained with blood. Seamus’ blood.
to expose him for what he is. And then he fell asleep in my arms, and I had the opportunity, finally, for proof – to look under his left sleeve… and I almost didn’t.”
Draco stopped him with a finger over his lips. “I need to tell you something, Harry. Will you listen?”  Harry looked at him uncertainly. But Draco’s eyes were calm, steady; the grey of the sea a storm had just passed over. Harry nodded mutely, and Draco smiled. “Right at the end, before I passed out,” he said, “and I thought I was going to die –”

Vince jerked, making as if to stand.
Madam Primrose had survived the war, but Robards had been replaced by Kingsley, who had done several years in wizarding law before joining the Corp. Scrimgeour and Pius Thicknesse still sat on the panel of judges, but Umbridge had been replaced with a woman he didn’t recognise.
Harry saw Draco stiffen. “It’s Draco, Aunt Bella.”
He cast the Magnifying Charm on his glasses as he ran down the bridge. Suddenly he could see the army up close, and he startled, almost tripping over his own feet. He put a hand blindly on the railing, following it down the bridge as he scanned the army. It was a chaotic mess of Death Eaters and vampires and a giants twice as big as trolls. A Death Eater slipped right in front of him, triggering a violent, fiery explosion. Harry shouted, falling back.
,” Harry said in an undertone, as Jenny chattered away to Ron, Eliza interjecting occasionally to correct her friend. “Not only did I send Justin over the edge with that kiss, I corrupted two
“What?” Harry said, thrown by this sudden revelation. “Who?”
“One of the three Deathly Hallows,” Luna breathed, eyes widening. She took the jagged stone, turning it over to examine it. “My father’s been searching for them for years. You did a very good thing, giving it up, Harry. It’s said that the Resurrection Stone doesn’t allow true contact with the dead. It shows only lies, designed to lure us to our deaths.”
But this was not the time to draw attention to them.
. Because we deserve a future together.”
But the feeling didn’t go away, and he realised he could
“You said you still thought it was a curse, then,” Hermione said, indignantly.
, Draco.”
Draco frowned. “What –?” He looked at Snape, and pulled back a little. And then his eyes caught on Harry’s neck, and he stilled. “What. Is. That,” he said flatly. His tone was dangerous, and Harry froze.
“But – but that’s
The title of this chapter comes from the song by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, featured in that iconic scene in the first Deathly Hallows movie. My favourite scene in the entire series!!
At the back of the group was a seventh-year with short dark curls. She caught his gaze, and smirked.
Molly said tearfully, “He’s just a boy, Albus –”
, as he’d feared.
Harry caught Draco’s earlobe between his teeth, biting down gently. “
, and got them here on the double. I think they’ll be okay.”
“Ah, the question that has divided scholars for centuries,” Dumbledore smiled. He held up his wand, drawing a golden line vertically in the air between them. “The Elder wand. My wand, as it happens, taken from Grindlewald long ago.” He drew a circle around the bottom half of the line. “The Resurrection Stone.” A triangle, around the whole thing. “And your Invisibility Cloak.”
“I’m yours, I’m yours,” Harry sobbed, trying to thrust forward into Draco's grip, crying out when he pulled against the knot. Draco made a low noise, almost a snarl, and grabbed his hips, pulling him back onto his cock, pushing impossibly deeper, the pressure on Harry’s prostate unbearable.
word for it? When you turn up with
“Intimacy,” Draco agreed.
Voldemort collapsed.
She answered the question in Finnigan’s eyes, first. It would be the hardest to say, and she wanted to get it over with quickly. “You know my father is in prison. You know he talked.”
The trouble was, Divination was never that straightforward. It was one of the first things Professor Trelawney had taught them, and, true to form, Pansy had seen only brief glimpses so far.
Something grabbed her hair, dragging her up. She screamed. “Well, well,” Yaxley sneered in her face. “What do we have here?”
A hand grabbed his arm, and he was gripped by a terrible squeezing sensation. Side-Along Apparition. He’d forgotten what it was like. He hated it,
“I know.” Malfoy’s lips twisted. Harry’s eyes fixed on them, and he licked his own involuntarily, mouth suddenly dry. “We’ve always hated each other, right from the start. Perhaps that’s why this was inevitable. I am the one person you can trust never to fawn over you, never worship the ground you walk on, always tell you the truth.”
“Hold still, sweetheart,” Narcissa said, drawing her wand.
Hermione sighed. “I love you,” she said, quietly. “I’m sorry.”
you –” His voice cracked embarrassingly, and he looked away.
“Shh,” Malfoy said, fumbling for his wand and casting a spell that banished the rest of their clothing.
. I need to be
“Ooh, another challenge, I like –
Luckily, they gave him a couple of trays, so he could levitate it all easily back to his friends. They were sitting by the lake, watching some daring students play tag with the Giant Squid.
She jumped a little, but faced him with a mulish expression.
Jenny’s eyes lit up. “Really?”
Hermione blinked. That was the first time she’d ever heard him say Voldemort’s name out loud, and it made her swell with pride.
Ahead, two giants had just smashed through some kind of enormous rock wall. Debris rained down on rows of shining knights. The giants roared. The knights attacked.
Pansy took her seat again to wait. Almost immediately, someone else settled into the chair opposite her. “So,” Daphne said. “I thought I would offer my congratulations on a game well played.”
They had a narrow escape with Selwyn and Travers just around the corner from his father’s study. They were toying with some fencing swords in the Hall of Mirrors, and Draco saw them too late. Tonks dragged him backwards, out of the hall. Draco collapsed back against the wall, panting. His arms were burning, and he struggled to keep Harry from slipping.
“Yes,
Ron nodded briskly. “Right, then. What are we waiting for?”
“Jeremiah’s book,” Draco rasped. He was looking worse with every passing moment. “It said – I could delay death. It’s – working. I just need to…”
Well, all except Harry’s, which was as impassive as Blaise’s. He’d given up on trying to make Malfoy leave, apparently.
Harry snorted. He splashed his face with cold water, and all he could think was that a few short hours ago, he would have been doing this with magic; just a simple wave of his hand, his own magic supplemented by Draco’s through their bond.
Harry could only nod, he expected this. It was the same every time. If, at any point, the ministry were under fire they would bring out their Golden Boy and parade him around like an animal at the circus to distract their citizens and their press. It was a clever tactic, Harry had to admit, but it felt like poison being dripped onto his tongue each time he did it.
When the pancakes were plated, Malfoy drew his wand and Harry jumped a little. The wand lowered slightly and a sad smile took over Malfoy’s face.
It was Draco’s time to hum now and wait for Fotheringham to continue talking.
Harry
The flat was warm and inviting and held more alcohol, for which Harry was certainly glad of. Draco lit the lights as he walked from room to room.
Harry nodded in a pathetic attempt at being enthusiastic.
Silence. Ears straining to hear anything beyond the creepy sounds of the forest, he took another few steps forward.
For the second time that day, a knock came to Harry’s door. It was loud and obnoxious and not waiting for an answer so Harry knew right away it was Ron.
“I can’t believe we’re having a housewarming. You and me. Mad isn’t it?” Harry asked, smiling as his hands tugged on Draco’s hips.
When he had counted twenty minutes passing Ron finally came through the door looking very grim. Everything in Harry was calling out in fear. He knew. He just knew something had happened.
“And then…and then he might accept and even come to terms with and doing something about the fact that he’s not…straight.”
Draco rolled to face the window, a small bud of hope unfurling in his chest. It was when he could hear the consistent waves of breath from the other that he responded. “Goodnight, Potter.”
“There he is: boy wonder.” His tone was derisive in an attempt to  make Harry look like an idiot in front of the minister.
“I have accommodation covered.”
Harry was looking the woman behind the bar, and he just didn’t get a feeling that she was a witch. Everything she did by hand was too methodical and practised.
“Robards?” He said, sheepishly.
The man was carefully following Draco’s hand, apparently mesmerised, and continued to stand very still and stern looking.
With a nod, Harry made his way down to the pub’s cellar. He was grateful that Draco had insisted earlier to light the place and label the new bottles on the shelves.
And we are at the end!
Draco’s sneered at him, “Well thankfully I have this brute to help me,” he said, nodding at Harry who frowned back at him feigning annoyance. Draco winked at him.
“Fish supper. No vinegar.”
“Well, you’re not going alone, that’s for sure, I’m coming. I wouldn’t trust the slimy git as far as I could throw him.”
“You know what I mean,” Draco said.
Patil walks in, her long black hair tossed over her shoulder. She walks up to his desk and perches herself on the end. Harry sits back in his chair and smiles warmly. This is something he must practise; smiling and being polite is rarely something that feels natural lately.
For the past two days, he had spent his time in the local cafes and in and out of the touristy shops or along the meandering country paths and so far, did not have one single lead. Not one.
Ron grinned crookedly at him. “Failing that – Hermione.”
“How was your day?” He asked.
“Do you want me to go?”
“Hmm…and what do you think of say…” He paused and looked at the menu board, “An Azkabana Slammer?”
Harry smiled. “It was Draco really. He was the one who questioned him and got the information we needed.”
“Wait, so I call you ‘Draco’ and you still get to call me ‘Potter’?”
When the trails emptied around lunchtime, he wandered down the street and popped into some of the shops, filling his back with random fridge magnets he wouldn’t use and shortbread he wouldn’t eat.
Potter was watching the conversation with a mixture of horror and amusement.
“Ah, a man of fine taste.” He looked intently at Draco, as if eyeing his prey.
Grey eyes finally met his and they held more feeling than Harry would have guessed. “I’m not asking to be forgiven, by the way, I don’t think I should be.”
“The Manor? I thought that –“
Fotheringham was saying,
The following morning was filled with shy smiles and a determination to figure out how the poisoning had happened.
“And he won’t know that, I live like a muggle.”
“In here.”
A sneer forms on Potter’s face. “So, you’re still bitter that your side lost, is that it?”
“So sorry, what can I get you?”
The young girl from the chip shop snapped back his attention as she shouted out her order.
Harry’s head was clearing at the sound of Draco’s serious tone. “Do you want to stop? It’s okay if you do, I –“
Draco could now be heard shouting at the mirror and Harry chuckled to himself as he fetched the mugs.
Two hours later, he had packed and completed his final checks on Grimmauld before leaving.
It took a moment for Harry to unfreeze himself, eventually giving the receiver and device to Henry. “Smith – what trackers do you have on him? Hopefully where he’s been Apparated to isn’t too heavily warded.” Harry looked at him expectantly.
“Anything you need I can get for you, just let me know.”
Finally, he added a colourant - a potion that he had created himself while bored, which turned the drink from a muddied colour to a vibrant, toxic green.
Potter smirked again, but it didn’t have any bite to it. “Still posh then I see?”
It was strange. To have the question hang in the air unanswered. The door opened and they whipped round to look.
The sun was well into its descent as he began to open his bag and set up the tent.
Harry took a breath and whispered into the receiver, praying that Draco didn’t jump and blow his cover, precarious as it was. “Draco? If you could possibly establish the intent behind his purpose for using muggles it would really help. Only if you can and once that’s done you’re out of there. I’ll personally come and get you out, alright?” Harry resisted the temptation to tell him what a great job he was doing with the two quills still in his eyeline and noting everything down.
She held him, head to her chest and rubbed his back in the middle of the waiting room. He cried for a long time, long enough that a healer came and offered Hermione a calming draught to give to him. She held out the hand that was rubbing smoothing circles in his back and clutched it.
“We weren’t talking about my friend, we’re talking about yours.”
The house had a more foreboding feeling to it as they approached. The path snaked up to the front door and all noises of the town were distant and indiscernible.
“Harry – people love alcohol. They’re not going to complain at having a boozy buffet.”
A hint of his old self could be seen in the way he held himself. Proud and confident, he haggled prices and asked questions. Harry could see him debating between products and calculating totals in his mind; almost like he was in potions, adept and purposeful.
“Tut, tut. Insubordination from you?”
Robards swivelled round to look at him. “Are you mental or have you gone soft? You hate the bleeding lot of them, more cause to hate them than anyone and here you are…are you fucking him or something? I think we’ll need a reason for this change of heart.”
“And what are you thinking about right now?”
It felt familiar to be Apparating to a forest with the tent but painfully quiet without the bickering that usually accompanied.
“You testified at my trial, but I’m guessing you didn’t stay for the full sentencing?”
This newfound desperation had him marching to the final pub at almost eleven at night. His boots thudding down the pavement and face set in a grimace.
The comment threw Draco until he remembered what Harry was referring to exactly. In the midst of his humiliating spectacle of hysterically sobbing in the middle of the night, Harry had kissed him. Actually kissed him. It was a shame that he was too upset to appreciate it properly at the time, due to snot on his face and continuing to cry, but it was rather nice.
Unable to help himself, Harry moved towards the desk and took the seat across from Kingsley.
Having the decency to look slightly ashamed he looked away from Draco’s face.
“Please call me Helena, dear. I don’t recall but it is marvellous stuff.”
At the top of the stairs was a small landing filled with rubbish, a far cry from the pristine rooms downstairs. Empty potion bottles, cauldrons and other debris was scattered on the carpet. A smell of stale booze and possibly piss hung in the air. Harry’s nose wrinkled.
Harry raised his hand to wave, mouth hanging open. The spotty teenager behind the till cleared her throat impatiently and drummed her long fingernails on the counter.
A silver glow bounded through the door and into the office. It was a Patronus Harry recognised but couldn’t put a name to whom it belonged to right away. It looked like an eel, beady eyes staring intently at Ron as it delivered a message in what appeared to be Smith’s voice.
On his way out, the talking mirror from Draco’s old bathroom stopped him.
“They might not be allowed to, Harry,” she reasoned calmly, “only family, perhaps or…”
“What’s that about my arse?” He smirked as Draco flushed a dark red.
“Right. And what do you think of the name of the drink?”
He crossed his arms over his chest, rather self-conscious now that he was here. All his bravado had worn off the second Potter had stepped through the wards with his hair standing on end and an incredulous look on his face.
The mirror could be heard hurling skincare tips to Draco as he walked past. He rolled his eyes and shared a commiserating look with Harry who, determined not to be awkward, walked to the kitchen to make tea.
Draco sighed heavily and picked at the invisible lint on his trousers. “I presume they thought it an unnecessary caveat to add. Any close contacts I had either refused to associate with me any longer, had fled the country or had similar rules imposed on them. And for everyone else…who would be willing to side-along a Death Eater?”
“Yeah, it’s just that…I don’t think…that I can have him as just a friend. He deserves better friends and also – “ He shuddered a breath.
Besides the chip shop there was a fish monger, butchers, convenience shop and four pubs which seemed rather excessive. Harry felt that the ‘tourist’ shop didn’t really count as the man who owned seemed to be actively trying to discourage people from visiting judging by his surly demeanour. Harry had gone into speak to him on his first morning of his investigation and was practically chased out of the shop by the old bugger. Some locals had heard the commotion and as he had tripped out the door and stood watching him, suspicion written all over their faces.
“Loose leaf Earl Grey isn’t posh, Potter. It’s just good.”
He muttered something under his breath when Draco lit the sparkler by snapping his fingers and adding ridiculous paraphernalia to the tall, curved glass – a pink umbrella, long bendy straw and sugar clinging to the rim. He conjured a napkin under the bar and with a flourish placed it under the glass.
“And what? Curing teenager’s acne?”
The players had split into two groups and were running about and dodging each other in such a way that it looked like the game was choreographed. Sidestepping each other and anticipating the opponent’s moves and never missing, always hitting the target. It was unbelievable.
The letter was quick and succinct and sharp as an arrow.
“It’s been known.”
His heart sputtered and struggled to correct itself. “Good.”
“I’ve been in the hospital wing so often I could recognise it even in such a small dose,” Harry laughed.
Blood spiked in his veins at seeing a strip of moonlight glow on his face.
His vision blurred and it took several attempts to get the quill to fly into his hands and not soar past his head. Spreading out the parchment on his knees he wrote his letter of resignation.
Harry tried to seem genuine but he couldn’t quite get his face to obey.
“Draco, you’ve just been listing hairdressers here.”
The heels of his palms pressed into his eyes as he worked on the complicated act of sucking oxygen into his lungs. “This can’t be happening. Can’t be happening. Potter tell me what you need me to say – what’s going on?”
“What the fuck?”
“I know, I heard. I’m dealing with it.” Ron cut him off and gave him a look that eventually quieted him.
Draco seemed to be talking very loudly at this point, something animated about one of the products. He called Harry’s name.
“I don’t want to hear about your arse, thanks. What are you going on about anyway, I’m not going anywhere with –“
Grinning, he commenced his grovelling and wrote his reply.
“Well, it’s not my fault you were sent to a boarding school that didn’t allow you to mix with normal folk and you don’t understand what people here are saying.”
Harry’s hands went to Draco’s shirt and Draco held his wrists. “Harry – you haven’t seen me without a shirt.”
“Well, I’ll need both of your memories firstly to be submitted into evidence. You’ll need to bring them along, Harry if you don’t mind.” Harry shook his head to indicate that he didn’t. “In your absence, I’ll send along another Auror in place of you, to keep an eye on the suspect.”
He started by levitating the chairs and tables to their places and transfiguring the glasses into their needed purposes. They always looked so dull when they eventually popped back to their pint shaped forms; Draco much preferred them with their long stems and shallow tops.
Some total wanker was giving drinks to muggles and naming them after wizarding things. Who the fuck would do that? Who would be so stupid, so reckless and to what motivation? Ridiculous was the least sinister thing it could be for he didn’t know what was in these drinks and who was giving them out.
Draco put a sign on the pub door that said they were closed for business. Twice they had people shouting up at Draco’s flat’s windows asking why. Mainly they were concerned for Draco’s health, but when they realised he was well they were confused as to why the pub was shut. At one point, Draco had been practically hanging out the living room window trying to convince people to go home. One very persistent regular then asked for Draco’s recipes for some of the cocktails if the pub was really shut for the evening. Draco had told him to bugger off in that crisp accent of his that made Harry’s stomach feel funny. Him being bent over the window with his arse in the air did that too but Harry tried not to think about that.
He kept the place clean and found the hours could be dwindled by unblocking a sink, scrubbing at the skirting boards, and organising clothes into their respective places and purposes.
“Well, if I am to be entirely honest, I knew you straight away.”
They made their way to the bottom of the village and decided to make their way up, one shop at a time. Draco used this time to keep in touch with some of his regulars and do some errands along the way. They had picked up tonight’s dinner, bulbs and Harry had to stop Draco from buying some new electric grill that was all the rage.
“Guess.”
“I am forbidden from going home, Potter.”
Potter rolled onto his side away from him and Draco felt a small part of his heart twinge at the sight. Rejection from this man was a familiar hurt for Draco and he had never learned to just accept.
“I…I know.” Draco went quiet.
There were so many things he found he had to avoid to get through the day. Owls, chocolate, kind smiles but, on days like these, everything reminded him of despair. Sometimes looking at his sock drawer or a tea towel could cause him to dry heave with grief.
Harry knew he was being led into a trap. “Yeah.”
“You’re an arse, Potter.”
As Harry made his way back up, a peculiar feeling settled over him. Similar to when he would go to the muggle cinema and to watch a scary film. It vanished almost instantly as soon as he made his way into the bar.
Harry smirked and turned his attention towards the players. Being unfamiliar with all of the rules for rugby he couldn’t quite follow the game particularly well but their agility was incredible.
“When you said that you were banished. What did you mean?”
“He what now?” This set alarm bells off in Harry’s head.
“So,” Harry continued to press, “Is it some kind of supplement.”
“Okay,” Harry said. “What are we going to do? I mean he’s tracked for Apparating but not for side-along.”
“Will you, aye? All ninety pounds of you?”
“Oh, of course but your skin is beautifully clear, you don’t need it surely.”
Harry stopped and looked at him. Something in his face must have given it away for Ron’s face cleared, understanding shining through. “Really?” he said. There was no anger there and less surprise than Harry would have thought.
An event had caused Kingsley to be delayed in speaking with Harry and so he found his way to the curse breaking department to see Hermione.
“Is that so?”
“Draco is not a Death Eater any longer and his sentence has been served, Robards,” Harry said coldly.
Dark wood covered almost every surface of the room, from bookcases, to cabinets that held all types of curiosities and a large desk with an obscure paper weight on it. Harry hoped it was purely decorative because the thing was completely ridiculous.
The look of Ron’s face from earlier floated into his mind and he scrunched his eyes closed at the memory of it. No. He couldn’t do that anymore. Couldn’t take the credit for others’ work simply because he was instructed to do so.
“What are you doing?” Potter asked.
Harry handed out the drinks, attempting to keep the grimace from his face. On his walk to the bar he caught Draco’s eye. He had been watching him and now smiled softly from across the room. Harry felt a buzzing in his ears, heart thumping from behind his ribs.
There was a crack in the air and then silence. Harry was floored. He looked around the room to see other faces matching his though perhaps without the pinch of desperation that he no doubt had.
Draco tensed infinitesimally. “Oh?”
“Could’ve fooled me,” Draco barked at him.
The first thing he was aware of, other than the need to piss, was the dip in the bed next which he knew by this point was Harry. He was reading a quidditch magazine that Draco kept by the bed but couldn’t quite push himself to read. He tended to avoid all things that caused him discomfort and reminders wakened an ache in his chest, so he left them be.
“My job is number one.”
“Huh?”
If Draco was unnerved it was certainly impossible to tell. He was relaxed in the chair, as if it were his office instead. He examined the glass and brought it to his nose. Suddenly, a smile broke out over his face and he threw his head back and laughed.
“Gringotts, dragons, dementors…”
Draco shifted and this brought Harry’s attention to him.
“Should we, I don’t know, look at some of the shops more closely? Since it seems to be potions based?” Draco asked when Harry finally took a breath from asking him questions.
They huddled around the portkey, Ron to his left and Patil to his right. Smith was not coming thank fucking goodness as Harry’s temper could only withstand so much.
“You got parole and community service, time served. How is that banishment?”
“I dunno. You’re just looking at me differently.”
“My god, this job is exhausting.”
“But still!”
“Hey,” Ron called. The others felt the need to smile professionally at him. Except Patil, who winked. She took notes as Ron asked Harry questions about what he had seen, ideas on the suspect and anything else he felt was relevant to include.
“Well that’s because I used it religiously, Potter, do keep up.”
“Fine! My friend, fuck – this is ridiculous. I…you were the one that made me realise that I was, how did you put it, ‘not straight’.”
“Oh, fuck off!
“Draco, darling!” A woman’s voice him called from down the street.
The other man seemed to choose his words carefully now. “Well I have certain interests, you see. Places I want my business to go and it’s rather irritating to be hindered by…laws and regulations in our world. So, needs must.”
“Your hair isn’t so dreadful today,” She said with a sigh.
Draco said quietly.
“Well, you would say that weren’t you? If you were the police and you didn’t want me to know.”
“Yeah. It’ll be fine. Go.”
Potter snorted and then immediately tried to pretend he hadn’t.
Scott shook Harry’s hand. “Hiya. Great team I’ve got here, Harry.”
Draco stirred something in a travel sized cauldron. “No, not that I can think of. Seems like normal happiness to me. And anyway, why would someone go the bother of slipping something into people’s drinks that made them happy? What do they get out of that?”
“…No. I don’t.” Draco made a gesture that indicated there was not much more to be said on the matter.
“Draco, lock the doors.”
Firstly, he could owl Kingsley to confirm that there was something rather odd happening in this town, but he still had truly little to go on. Secondly, he could keep up the casual surveillance he had initiated so far and see if anything turned up. This was, however, a slow and tedious process and the only information he had received was when he wasn’t acting weird and intensely questioning people. Finally…he could just speak to people. Have casual conversations with them and hope it leads somewhere with his investigation. This seemed like the only viable option and, if he were being honest, the only one that currently appealed to him.
Harry nodded. “I’m going to kiss you – is that alright?”
Eyes scanning the dark wooden shelves he eventually came across the stuff. It was, in fact, a disgusting colour of pink. Bright and swirling and not to be trusted; no wonder Draco called it the Pink Dolores.
“And also I think I’m…well…it’s that I…I’m in love with him, see, and don’t really know what to do about it.”
Draco was panting, his hands still tied to the chair. Harry moved his hands over the chair and the bindings fell limply to the sides. “No, no, no, no – Draco? Can you hear me, Draco? Can you – fuck. Its – I don’t – Draco, where is it? Where did it hit you? I can’t see it. Fuck. Draco? Ron! RON! Help him, Ron, please! Draco?”
Harry thought on this. “Hmm, maybe. Or maybe we only get one shot at this ridiculous thing that is life and who gives a damn what we do with it or what anyone says about it.”
