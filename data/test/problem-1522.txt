Oh no. Oh shit.
“Potter - I need my wand to open this.”
“Still. People will see you’ve offered your protection.”
Draco looked round nervously but they were alone. Turning left, they went through the door to the cellars, along the short passageway. Draco found the descent of the rough stone stairs nearly impossible, but he refused to shuffle down the steps on his bum or let Prudy levitate him. Eventually he managed it through placing his cane on the step below, bracing his hand on the wall on the other side, and hopping down on his good leg.
“How old are you, Mr Malfoy?”
“Anyway, Malfoy, we’re getting side-tracked. I want to know about this Path of the Penitent, how it works, why we can’t hex you, everything.”
They had not spoken on their way here, both of them staying alert, but there had been no sign of anyone. Draco wondered whether his absence from his cell had been discovered yet. He couldn’t decide how the Aurors would respond; surely they wouldn’t think he would do something as stupid as to go straight home, but then on the other hand they wouldn’t have anywhere better to start the hunt. The ritual was nearly completed, but if the Aurors came now, it would all have been for nothing. Draco tensed at the thought, turning to face the two doors leading back into the house, standing guard as Prudy busied herself behind him with filling the kettle with water and placing it on the stove.
. And tomorrow - tomorrow is - fuck. Tonks and Lupin. Oh, Merlin. And guess what? I get to meet my godson! Little Teddy.” Potter’s breathing became distinctly uneven once more, and he brought his knees up and leant his head down on them, wrapping his arms round his legs. Draco didn’t think he was imagining Potter’s slight rocking motion back and forth.
While he had been collecting himself, the tree above him had
“Is it your leg? Here, I’ll come round and get the door for you.”
Draco’s smile faded. “I don’t know. I still did my best to get in your way last Saturday. Only a prat tries to stop someone who’s busy saving the world.”
“Why didn’t you tell them?”
and slid it over the table. Draco easily separated a blob of the same size as before, and then spent a moment thinking about how he looked on a broom.
“Well, if ten is a
No, you don’t understand. I’ve done so much shit - so much -
much compassion.”
,” with a jab forwards, and a stain disappeared from the hem of Potter’s robe -
Once he was clean, he leant back against the wall, trying to take some of the weight off his right leg. He regarded the stream of water speculatively. Reaching a hand out, he tried to access the Old Magic like he had with the wood, by imagining what he wanted the water to do -
“Yeah, I know. But - I know how bad it is to lose your wand.”
“Thank you, Master Draco!” Prudy clapped her hands together and actually did a little gambolling hop-skip of happiness. Draco couldn’t imagine why she would ever want to come back to Malfoy Manor. He felt really rather touched by her loyalty.
There was the family villa in the south of France, but he had to be in the country to continue on the Path and atone to his victims.
As they came through the gap the path widened again, and Draco caught his breath at the sight before him.
Draco almost moved the leg in question, but remembered just in time that he was supposed to be staying still, and that the muscle would seize up.
Potter grimaced. “Right.”
Draco couldn’t really understand what the man was talking about. He was too busy staring through the glass in front of them. They seemed to be
” She asked quietly.
So he
Shacklebolt raised his eyebrows and McGonagall shifted in her seat. Draco didn’t look to see how Pomfrey or Potter were reacting. The silence began to get awkward.
Potter was already back in front of him, holding out Weasley’s newly-black Chudley Cannon’s sweatshirt. Draco took it, and began pulling it over his head.
“What’s your elf magic like then? You can shape wood?”
Draco felt a little better. “This isn’t the hospital wing, though.”
Potter grimaced. Draco was beginning to have second thoughts about putting himself so close to the line of fire, but he wasn’t going to back out now.
“What happened to your leg?”
your apology. After everything you’ve done for me, it’ll just make me feel worse.” Potter glowered. “Look, Potter, she’s just disappointed that I didn’t end up haunting her bathroom with her forever, don’t worry about it.”
“I… feel like I’ve just been hit in the head. I don’t know what to think.”
“Honestly, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, I think wizards might be a bit set in their ways.”
He slowly swung across the room and lowered himself onto the armchair on the other side of her desk.
Draco flinched a bit when he stepped closer, but to his credit, the man pretended not to notice, instead holding his hand out patiently. Draco was a second late in responding, but then he made his arms move and passed the crutches over. Now that he could use one hand on the roof and one on the open door, it was easier to twist around on one leg and lower himself in, although he still dropped the last few inches into the padded seat with a bit of a
He didn’t know what to do with the dirty plate and mug afterwards, so he stacked them on the kitchen counter and went to have a shower. The bathroom was tiny and the water lukewarm, and the high side of the bath was exceedingly awkward to step in and out of with only one good leg. He ended up sitting on the rim of the bath and pivoting to lift each leg over the greyish porcelain.
Draco’s eyebrows rose. He didn’t really know what to say. He hadn’t expected to ever see Prudy again. “Thanks, Prudy - but you know, I’m not your master any more.”
risk, for
“Why - why are you telling me this?”
a big day, then!”
He bowed his head, and let the tears fall. They cried together for several minutes. Draco had never felt pain like it - a bitter, stabbing regret. If only Dobby were alive, he would certainly have been among the seven people the Path would have sent him to. He could have made amends, atoned by doing Dobby’s task. And now, instead, he somehow had to live with himself.
What the hell had Potter been doing with those Aurors, anyway? It had been all of a day since the battle, and they had already dragged Potter out again to start rounding up the left over Death Eaters? He remembered how exhausted Potter had looked sitting on that bench in the Great Hall. Surely the merciful Muggle-lovers could give their hero a proper chance to rest?
“Well, no-one told them to me.” Potter curled up in the armchair, head clutched in his hands, his wand sticking out from his fingers at an odd angle.
“Do I
The Path of the Penitent! Hagrid was one of the seven people he had most wronged - and now the spell was compelling him to kneel before him and ask his forgiveness.
“I can’t go, Potter - no, well, the truth is I don’t want to go. It doesn’t feel right or respectful, I’m a Death Eater, for Merlin’s sake - ”
Draco finally got a chance to look around. They were on a scrappy, litter-strewn square of grass, surrounded on all sides by a muggle road lined with more cars than Draco had ever really seen gathered in one place before, and a ring of dingy-looking tall town-houses beyond that. Potter had apparated them into the shade of an anaemic beech tree. Draco could spot at least two broken windows just in the houses nearest to them. He wrinkled his nose.
When Winky finally lifted her head from Draco’s knee she left a large damp patch behind. Her face was red and blotchy. Draco half-expected her to start apologising and punishing herself for messing up his robes, but she appeared to have a bit more steel than that. She gave him a sympathetic look - much kinder than he deserved - and said simply, “Winky is leaving Master Malfoy to his breakfast now, sir.”
He was out of options.
After several long moments, Draco forced himself to turn back. He had to deal with Potter, and he couldn’t afford to lose focus like this.
“I was not aware you had come into your inheritance.” Shacklebolt’s deep tone of voice was impossible to read. Draco knew he would be thinking of the lost reparations that they would no longer be able to force his father to pay.
“Pass me some water then.”
Draco almost rolled his eyes, and then remembered how it had felt to be clueless and nervous in a tailor’s shop.
There was clearly more to
” she spat, and for a fleeting instant Draco was bound hand and foot with his uncle over him, but in reality the ropes had fallen at his feet and vanished.
“Harry! Where are you? The ceremony starts in half an hour, and Andromeda said you were meant to meet her and Teddy first, and Ron said you never came back to the castle last night. Please come soon, Harry, we’re really worried about you. I’ve got to go. Get here quickly, please!”
Potter’s eyes lit up. “Yeah, go on.”
I’ve done wrong and I’m going to atone for it, all right? And you have
In the last five or so hours, that serene clarity had already faded as if it had never been. Only the hands gripping his kept him from detaching completely from his own body. He welcomed the numbness, though; some part of him knew that this exhausted fog was going to be preferable to whatever emotion came next.
“You should have seen her, Draco! Did I tell you about the time when she first saw me as a ghost?
“We had to put you under several complicated Stasis Charms to induce a magical coma. We finished fixing you up at about dusk, and you’ve been under an extra-strength Dreamless Sleep potion until now. So all in all, about twenty-eight hours.”
“Hey!” The female Auror who had come to the Manor to re-arrest him was sitting on a chair a little way down the corridor. She sprang to her feet as Draco emerged. He almost laughed when he realised that he was only around the corner from the Slytherin quarters.
Eventually the kettle started whistling, an unbearably loud sound in the silence, and Prudy reached quickly to move it off the heat. She levitated a mug to the kitchen table and came back over to Draco.
He fished his pocket watch out from the jeans with one hand, awkwardly using the rest of his arm to prevent the crutch from falling over. It was already five to two. Shit! Where had the time gone? He must have been warding off his panic for longer than he thought. He had to leave the protection of the wards, and he didn’t feel ready yet. He swallowed and took a deep breath against the resurgence of nerves. He would never feel ready. All he had to do was get himself to the pavement so that he would be visible to the muggle chauffeur when they arrived in the taxi.
Prudy sniffed and nodded, bringing up a corner of her pillow-case to wipe her eyes. “Prudy is just wishing Prudy is being there to protect Master Draco.”
Potter, but there’s no need to be such a Gryffindor about it. The firewhiskey will be just as effective if you take a moment to enjoy it on the way down.”
By the time they finished, Draco’s lungs ached fiercely, but he refused to show his discomfort. He was quietly grateful when Madam Pomfrey set a small phial of pain-relief potion on his bedside table.
charm. Besides, the T-shirt reminded him of nothing more than his night-shirt, and the cloak helped him to feel a bit less underdressed.
“Yes, I’m afraid so. How bad is the pain when it’s triggered, from a one to ten, say?”
“Hmmm.” Myrtle glared directly into Potter’s face for a few more moments, before finally relenting. “Are you
Draco felt his mother’s hand on his lower back, and it was comforting. His mother and father gazed at each other for a moment, and Draco could tell they were saying goodbye. He wished it was possible to give them a minute alone together, but it was too late now.
“I do sympathise, Mr Malfoy. This is hard. But you’ve survived a war; you can adjust to this. And the best way to channel that frustration is into working hard on your exercises that I’m going to show you. First, though, I’m going to start breaking up the scar tissue in the muscle with a massage. Can you get up onto the bed, please?”
He had thought he’d already accepted that as a fact, but it wasn’t until now that he realised that he was hoping this muggle would supply him with some miracle solution. He just didn’t know how he was going to cope, living like this forever.
“Yes. Although you can only tell because of the hair, can’t you?”
“Gods, no, Potter, that goes against the etiquette. Let alone the number of reasons which are perfectly obvious. And anyway, if you’re a talkative drunk then I’ll know all about it in an hour or two, unless I forget it by the morning of course.”
Andromeda cancelled the
“Luckily, I
Her tiny hands clutched at her skirts and her bulbous eyes filled with tears.
“Hello, Mr Malfoy, I’m doctor Anne Liston - please follow me,” she said, not batting an eye at his cloak, and walked away with the unquestioning expectation that Draco would follow. He did, somehow soothed by her air of authority.
Oh, no.
He opened his trunk and brought out his familiar peacock quill, green ink and parchment. It felt good to see them again; they were a welcome piece of normality, and almost as comforting as the tea had been.
Potter sucked in a surprised breath, and finally seemed to see him properly. “You didn’t kill him, Malfoy,” he said roughly.
“For you, Potter, not much more.”
So what if Severus had lied to him his whole life? Draco didn’t care. Snape was dead now, in any case, so it didn’t matter, did it? It didn’t.
Potter laughed, refilling his glass for the third time. “I know. I know. I just couldn’t help myself, I was curious…”
“How do I know you’re not lying to me, Potter?”
Draco urgently brought his finger to his lips, flicking his eyes between her and the ghost floating above them.
“Twenty past
He passed it to her, realising for the first time that apparently the bark was real for her too. She hurried back to the table, climbing a short wooden step ladder to be level to it, and broke the bark into several pieces with her long fingers before dropping it into the mug. Then she levitated the kettle over and poured the boiling water over the bark.
Draco flinched back even further, and Weasley shoved him off in disgust. Draco groped for the wall, hardly seeing it through the swirling grey dust, and sank down against it, until he was sat in a ball, pressing his side hard against the ancient wallpaper. His breaths were quick, shallow gasps that rasped in his throat. And the spell wanted him to start talking.
He felt over the wound with his fingers, wincing at the wrongness of the dip where there should have been a smooth, strong line. The burned skin was indeed numb, and felt just as shiny and tight as it looked. He could feel the ropey remains of his calf muscle directly underneath it, flexing as he gently moved his foot up and down. There didn’t seem to be nearly enough muscle left for the leg to function normally. Draco gingerly got to his feet and tried putting weight on his left leg, only to hiss in pain as his calf immediately cramped up. He sank back down to sit on the floor and tried not to let any tears escape as his fingers coaxed the rigid muscle to relax again. Eventually, after maybe half a minute, the intense pain faded, and he took a deep, shaky breath.
“Then Frona will help the young Master.”
Prudy still wore the faded pillow-case that she had worn as the Malfoy house-elf, but over that, in an odd contrast, she wore Draco’s own dark purple satin waistcoat. It was big enough on her to look like a tunic-dress, and Draco thought that it must have been tied up somehow at the back to prevent it from slipping off her frail shoulders.
Madam Pomfrey had lost the last of her hostility, and looked at Draco with open sympathy. “Also, Mr Malfoy, I wanted to discuss your leg injury. Mr Potter said it was inflicted by a Fiendfyre creature?”
Draco took them from the man and arranged them between his legs. The man closed the car door, causing Draco to startle yet again, and walked around the car to his own side, which had a lot of complicated-looking dials and wheels and levers.
Bill nodded, and swept a stray strand of his long ginger hair back with a sigh.
Potter beamed, and Draco couldn’t resist smiling back. “Yes, but we both know you’re not as prattish as you used to be, Malfoy.”
“Right…?” Then Draco saw the house appearing between two others and he understood.
Potter shrugged, failing to look nonchalant. “You know how it is. Early inheritance, the perk of losing one’s parental figures before turning twenty.”
McGonagall’s eyebrows rose. Pomfrey coughed. Draco could feel his face burning. Gods, he hated honesty. Still, Potter had only asked him so that he could help Draco avoid being coerced by Shacklebolt.
“Yes. That’s right. I’m afraid that is the reality that I am here to help you face, Mr Malfoy: there is no complete, nor instant, fix to this problem. I don’t believe in sugar-coating things like this, it doesn’t help. You have a disability now. That means your abilities are more restricted than they used to be.”
Draco boggled at her. He had tried to
Draco choked on a cry and stumbled back, slamming himself into the bodies behind him. He had to get out, get away, but Dumbledore was far too powerful, he would kill Draco, he was nearly upon him -
Draco just looked at him, and knew Potter was thinking something along the same lines: that this connection felt strangely profound.
Draco felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Potter had said that Severus had been serving Dumbledore, but it had slipped Draco’s mind after everything else that had happened. This made it feel real. Severus truly had been helping Potter, teaching him his own secret spells. Somehow, all that animosity between his godfather and Potter had been an elaborate act. Draco felt something bitter clench in his stomach and had to look away.
Potter frowned. “I’m not going to let you
Wow. The days since Saturday had been a blur. He hadn’t realised so many had gone by.
“Mr Malfoy will be well enough to be moved by this time tomorrow,” said Madam Pomfrey, “and in the meantime the Baron will continue to stand guard.” She nodded up at where the ghost still floated, bobbing ever so slightly up and down. He returned Pomfrey’s nod, impassive.
Draco bit his lip, but the look of naked disappointment gathering on Potter’s drunk face was too much to stand.
.” The wreckage flew back into an armchair.
“Hold on, lad, I’ll come round and give you a hand,” said the driver.
Potter winced and hunched into himself. Apparently he cared about this house a bit more than he said he did. “Kreacher’s going to be devastated.”
Anne Liston held open the second door on the right for him, which led into a large, airy room, with, thankfully, a wooden floor and no marble anywhere. The wall on his left had another pair of large windows looking out onto a different muggle street, and in the far right corner was a desk with couple of chairs - another shiny black armchair on the ‘patient’ side and a strange chair with wheels on the ‘healer’ side.
After a long moment, Draco pulled himself up onto hands and knees and crawled under the table to Prudy’s tiny form. She lay crumpled against the cabinets, a horrible gash oozing blood from her forehead. Draco gently laid a hand on her arm, then lifted it, feeling for a pulse on her frail wrist. He almost sobbed in relief when he found one.
), but he’d never before had to deal with injuries that stuck around for any length of time. He was a fair hand at healing spells, if he had a wand. These endless aches and twinges - especially from his damn leg - were beginning to get to him.
“Okay. Sorry.”
Its ancient branches, already sagging with age, were sagging even lower, deliberately reaching towards him. Draco watched as the branches formed a protective circle around where he sat, and reached out to touch the branch nearest him, remembering how it had felt when he had been this tree. “Hello,” he said softly.
Potter laughed again, this time without bitterness.
Draco still felt tense with humiliation, and he almost wished Potter would be nastier about this so that he could get properly angry with him. The debts he owed Potter were now verging on uncountable, and he hated it.
on Carrow. That one wasn’t even life-or-death. He spat in Professor McGonagall’s face, and I was angry. And I don’t feel anywhere near as guilty for that as I do about cutting you open that time, and
was what was meant to happen - in the funerals he had attended in the past, the beams of light had simply dissipated in the air. Draco had thought that was what was meant by ‘lay bare our loss to the sky’.
“Yeah, right! You think I couldn’t take your father?”
, but I had to be able to complete the monthly ritual for my ancestors.”
Shacklebolt smiled. “Thank you,” he said, and offered his hand. Draco shook it, a little taken aback. “I will instruct the Aurors to retrieve them and pass them along to Madam Pomfrey.”
be that thick, Potter.” The spell immediately rebelled. “All right, what I actually mean is that it seems completely obvious to me. It’s the damn Mark, I don’t want anyone looking at it.”
Draco could feel himself wanting to hide. He was far too exposed while lying in a bed. He didn’t want to talk about which people he had hurt the worst. He had some fairly good ideas, but he didn’t fancy rehashing all the bad things he’d done with the Minister and the Headmistress and the Saviour of the Wizarding World. And what if he forgot someone obvious? How bad would that look?
Draco’s nose wrinkled. “Ugh. Potter. Don’t say it like that.”
She gave him a frightened look.
Draco heaved himself up off the floor again somehow, using the side of another armchair for leverage. He gathered his crutches from where they had fallen and swung over to stand in front of Potter.
“God, this stuff is fucking strong, isn’t it?”
He lifted his head and pushed the parchment onwards to his father. His mother had seen what he had written, and gave him a look full of quiet concern and sympathy. She reached back under the table and squeezed his hand.
“I’m sorry, Winky.” Draco’s eyes stung and his throat felt thick. “Dobby was - was a very brave elf. I saw him, Winky. He fought a whole room full of his old masters to save Harry Potter. He saved everyone.”
He managed to operate the simple red button to release his seatbelt, and he even figured out how to pull on the metal handle to open the door, but getting up and out onto the pavement was intimidating.
Draco looked down at the parchment. Names, written in many different hands, almost covered it completely. Draco’s eyes widened.
His mother nodded.
“I know! I know, okay? Can you please speak more quietly?”
“You don’t, I suppose.” He paused, as if chewing over the next thing he wanted to say. “Snape invented it. I’m surprised he didn’t teach it to you. It’s bloody useful.”
Potter brought his head up and squinted at him. He looked strange without his glasses on. Draco turned and scooped them up from the mantelpiece, where he had placed them last night. Potter took them without a word, put them on, and squinted up at Draco again, more successfully this time.
At the bottom of the stairs, he ignored the door to his left that led to the wine cellar, or rather, the dungeon below the dining room where Lovegood and Ollivander and so many others had been held - even Potter, for all of ten minutes. Instead, he stopped in front of the stone wall directly in front of him.
He felt Weasley’s long hand come reluctantly to rest on his left shoulder, Potter’s hand on his right. Draco hesitated for a second, looking side-long at Potter. He didn’t want Potter seeing this stupid salute, but he didn’t want to have to explain why either, so he lifted his left arm to get it over with as quickly as possible.
Draco stared at her, feeling whatever hope he had had fold up into nothing in his chest. He knew his parents were right, but for an instant he allowed himself to wish, fiercely, that things were different. Then he forced himself to put that wish aside.
Potter’s light-brown skin paled. “No, I - no - I didn’t, I didn’t mean to…” Draco raised his eyebrows at the extent of Potter’s discomfort with the memory. It looked like he was going to be sick.
“Excellent.”
Potter looked down, scuffing his foot along the floor. Then he gave a tight shrug. “What happened, happened. I just have to - have to accept that.” He looked up and gave Draco a nod. “See you tomorrow, Malfoy.” He turned and left.
Potter stared at him, and Draco flushed. He had to explain more. “I’m curious to see a family home. And it might provide a - place to work on your task together. And…” This wasn’t going to go over well. “You’re a very powerful political ally, Potter, and I don’t have any of those left. Maintaining a connection with you could be extremely useful to me.”
Draco blinked at him. There was a light sheen of sweat across Potter’s forehead. Once again - just like that note yesterday - this was Potter being
Potter covered his whole face with his hand and shuddered, his sobs becoming louder and less controlled. It didn’t last very long, though. Within two minutes, Potter had got his feelings under wraps again. It seemed that Potter wasn’t used to letting go, even with alcohol loosening his inhibitions.
On the word ‘Fred’, Potter’s voice finally cracked, and his breaths hitched into quiet sobs, his head bowed and his shoulders moving with each gulp of air.
“Keep your neck
“Well, congratulations on leaving your comfort zone. I know it isn’t easy. So, if you wouldn’t mind, could you tell me about your injury?”
“No,” he said, but no sound came out, and he still couldn’t move.
Potter’s voice was a bit weak, but Draco was delighted to have elicited this much interest from him. Perhaps Draco could return Potter’s kindness with inane, distracting babble.
he spun round on his knees to see two Aurors and - and
Draco sagged onto the bed, struggling to calm down. It wasn’t his uncle, of course not. The relief was strong enough to flatten the alarm of finding himself once again at wandpoint. After all, he knew that the Aurors couldn’t do anything to him.
He welcomed the blackness.
With an effort Draco released his death-grip on the crutch. The Old Magic stopped making his body vibrate.
The man was already standing outside the door, reaching out a broad, brown hand towards him.
Potter wasn’t going to just hand it over. Draco was a war criminal with a Dark Mark and a mysterious ability to leave his cell whenever he wanted.
The pull on him quadrupled, and there was no way to fight it any more. Draco could feel his heart going more than twice as fast as it should, and his breathing was coming in sharp pants. Oh Gods, this was going to be horrible. He stepped off his circle of granite and onto the grass. The grass descended steeply between the levels of the spiral path, and Draco knew he couldn’t do this on one foot. He lowered himself to the ground, discarding both crutches and continuing on his bum like a deformed crab. He angled himself downwards and to the left, manoeuvring between the standing people, the invisibility cloak still over him, dragging through the grass and tangling with his legs. He could at least delay his appearance until the last possible moment - he knew the spell demanded he be seen as well as heard, but he could make the disruption as short as possible -
Prudy sniffled and nodded, looking absolutely wretched. Draco squeezed her back. “I’ll see you in a week, Prudy. Take good care of yourself.”
Potter looked appalled. Served him right for asking.
“It hurts you, doesn’t it?”
Potter looked stricken. He clearly hadn’t thought through the likely reactions from his pseudo-family when offering Draco help. “Um… sorry?”
“Prudy, I’m so sorry.” Potter had to clear his throat to continue speaking. “I - he - it was a few weeks ago. And - it was my fault. He died saving me and my friends from - ” his eyes flickered up to Draco’s face, and Draco held his breath - “from great danger. We would all have died without him.”
The whole thing was beginning to take on a nightmarish quality, heightened by the ethereal golden light. His chest was closing in like it did when he had a panic attack; he couldn’t catch his breath.
Potter ran into the bedroom and hared back out again holding Draco’s shoes.
“I have no idea if I’m a talkative drunk or not.”
Potter nodded. He was frowning, probably annoyed with himself for showing any concern.
Professor - no, Headmistress - McGonagall stepped into Draco’s field of vision near the foot of his bed, followed by a tall, bald, black guy, who was presumably Shacklebolt. His undeniable presence made it seem as though he had been Minister for Magic for years rather than a few days. Draco slipped the twig under his covers and wished very much that he could sit upright to face them.
“Behind you - by your left shoulder - that’s it!”
Draco sniffed. “What’s that smell?”
“Isn’t that obvious? I thought you’d want something, you know, so you can defend yourself.”
“What, so you wouldn’t want your father to still be alive if you could give him that chance?”
“It worked well for me.”
“You are most welcome, Mr Malfoy. And if you are really able to help with the healing potion situation, I will be most appreciative.”
“It is pointless, Draco. We have no wand between the three of us. And I will only harm your prospects even more as a fugitive than if I come willingly.”
If he’d had his wand, he would have
Still, just from listening to those sat around them, they had picked up the pieces of news that came filtering in from across the country. Everyone who had been
“They’re not my - oh, whatever, Malfoy. You’re coming back to your cell, right now. Then you’re going to answer our questions.”
had come back to themselves; Kingsley Shacklebolt was the temporary Minister for Magic; some of their fellow Death Eaters were dead, some captured, some fled. None of it seemed truly important.
“Malfoy - would you - could you come with me? Tomorrow?”
“There we go. So, your left arm is fine, although your wrist joint was pretty much pulverised - all rebuilt now, of course. It’s your lungs and spine I’m more worried about. Your left lung was completely crushed and punctured at several points by your ribs, and you broke three different vertebrae. I’m confident that your spinal column has re-knitted itself correctly, but with these kinds of injuries it’s best to stay still and not aggravate the wound site for at least forty-eight hours. I tried to add some magical restraints to your bed to make sure you couldn’t move around too much, but they kept failing to form. Mr Potter tells me that you are currently under some kind of magic which prevents you being held captive, is that correct?”
“Easy does it, mate, nice and smooth, yeah?”
“Oh, God. I feel terrible. I don’t think I can make it, Malfoy.”
“You are all well come.” Andromeda paused just long enough for all eyes to settle on her. Draco had known her for fewer than five minutes, and already he could tell that this woman had not forgotten her aristocratic training in presence and performance. “We are come together to lay bare our loss to the sky. We are come together to pool our memories as water. We are come together to give our dead to the ground. We are come together to bear the blaze of our grief.”
“ - but today is a day for firsts, Potter, and if I can talk to a muggle and survive, then I’m sure I can figure out how to put plates down on a flat surface.”
His chest felt empty after all that crying, and the toast was not very appealing. After a slice and a half, he gave up. His stomach was still too small to eat much anyway.
Madam Pomfrey began tracing her wand in complicated patterns above his shoulder and chest.
Potter laughed. “Why not?”
“It wasn’t - it wasn’t - ” Potter had to break off and take a deep breath. “It wasn’t supposed to be this way.”
“Get back, Potter. Back!”
It was the first time Potter had deliberately used his advantage over him, and Draco didn’t know why he was surprised: he deserved the suspicious tone. He kept his chin up and forced himself not to mumble.
Draco slowly opened his eyes. His eyelids felt heavy and gritty, and Draco recognised the fogginess in his head as an after-effect of Dreamless Sleep. He blinked, gradually surfacing.
but that’s worse, because I can’t face her, but I can’t face this without her - ”
Lucius reached down into his boot and brought out a small silver knife. He kept it below the level of the table, so that no-one else could see it.
Draco looked up, and grinned at Potter’s wide-eyed expression. “Any requests, Potter? I’ve only tried with water once before, but I think it’s the kind of thing that doesn’t need much practice.”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat and spoke for the first time, in a calming rumble. “So, it appears the first order of business is to discuss where you will stay for the summer months, Mr Malfoy. Since Malfoy Manor is currently in the hands of the Ministry - ”
“Well. I won’t ask what a
“If you are quite done attempting to assault me, I’m going to the common room. And provided you get rid of the Aurors, I
“Yes, please.”
“Excellent. Right. Welcome back to the household, Prudy,” Draco said, feeling faintly ridiculous about doing this from a prone position on the floor, but determined to show good manners.
Potter summoned a couple of tumblers from the cupboard and, after wrestling with the bottle for a moment, poured them both a generous measure.
“Potter! Potter, wake up. You’ve got a message, it looks urgent, come on - ”
So much for retaining the element of surprise. “I want to brew more healing potions for Pomfrey. I imagine it will take a while before the professional apothecaries will be able to catch up with the demand for healing potions from St. Mungo’s, and it would be good to get the Hospital Wing’s stash fully restocked as soon as possible.”
The cane tore chunks of moss as he limped along. Draco’s leg was really starting to burn as he passed beyond the point where his ancestors had started having portraits painted. The oak trees were becoming larger and older with every step. He gritted his teeth; there was still just as far to go again.
“PEEVES!”
Finally, Potter looked up. “Over half of these things are
“So,” said Potter, looking gloomy, as if he just remembered why he wanted to be drunk.
idea from?
“Oh, right, of course.” Potter’s mouth twisted. “Jesus. I can’t even imagine it.”
Oh, no - oh, no - the pooling of memories had begun. And unlike the slow passing of a pensieve in the funerals he had known before, again Godric’s Hollow seemed innately designed for this. Running from each person’s plinth was a narrow granite channel in the ground, leading down into the central basin. All around him, people started bringing their wands to their temples and drawing out long strings of liquid-smoke memory.
“It’s a privacy charm. They can’t hear us.”
, in front of my aunt, all of them… Fuck, she could have been caught out so easily. One stray twitch from you… I - look, I know my parents love me, but they’re not exactly demonstrative about it, and lately they’ve not done the best job of keeping me safe. Knowing she did this - well, it feels amazing, frankly. My father - he admitted he put us in harm’s way, he even
Potter stood up from the trunk, and his movement broke the tension a little. “Er, hi, Bill. Thanks for coming. Did Kingsley explain Malfoy would be here? I should have warned you, I didn’t think…”
“Let me take a look at you…”
No need for the Statute of Secrecy at all, then. He could only stare.
Myrtle sniffed. “
“Master is - Master is being much better now,” Prudy squeaked, blushing.
His mother finished reading, then passed the parchment over to Draco. Draco blinked, getting his vision to focus, and scanned the page rapidly, anxiety clenching his insides.
. I can’t even imagine her doing that. In front of
” Not one of the spells reached Draco.
, and lifted her wand straight up, her posture rigid with defiance and pain. Across the Hollow, every single person lifted their wand too, and Draco clenched his fingers tighter around his crutches, wishing he could do the same.
“Potter, sit down. I’ll get us some plates.”
“Well, yeah, of course.”
He already felt a hell of a lot calmer. There was something soothing about slowly seeing the tent get put back together. Potter started with the crockery, levitating things back into the cabinets as they were fixed and then reattaching the cabinet doors. When he had finished putting the kitchenette to rights, he filled a kettle with an
“Hello, Potter. How’s the house?”
“The Elder wand is gone, Malfoy. I got rid of it.”
Shacklebolt smiled slightly. “My thanks, Lord Malfoy.”
“Prudy is feeling fine now, Master Draco, the Matron is healing Prudy very well - but Master Draco is not fine! Master Draco is hurt, Mr Potter is saying the poltergeist is throwing huge rocks at Master Draco!”
“Good.”
The tent flap opened behind him. Draco started and pulled off yet another fast turn on his crutches.
“Good. So. I’ve got some stuff to say, Malfoy, and I don’t really want you to interrupt.”
“Are you all right, lad?”
“Of course it is. It’s, er, kind of you. I was just trying to muster the courage to go find it myself. I didn’t expect you back today.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “You don’t have to do anything until she asks. I expect she’ll want your help when it comes time for her trial.” He wondered whether Potter would ever actually ask
“Oh! Yes, of course, Prudy, if - if you still want to…”
, Potter, yes, I probably will, but that has nothing to do with it! No-one but you wants me there!”
Potter grimaced, and didn’t meet Draco’s eyes. “She
“Master - the bark…”
Draco adjusted his sweaty grip on the crutches and endeavoured to keep his panting silent. The sun was nearly directly overhead, and Draco was half-stifled under the cloak. His heartbeat started to pound painfully behind his eyes, and he recalled that he hadn’t had the time to apply any of his usual hangover charms to himself. He was distracted for a moment by the memory of casting spells again, of feeling his magic channelled through Potter’s wand, before the misery of his current physical situation brought him back to the present. He licked his dry lips and wished he had some water. It was not unlikely that he would pass out from heatstroke before the end of the ceremony, and then everyone would trip over his invisible form as they walked back up the spiral path.
“Okay.”
as a shield.”
Potter glared at him again, clearly refusing to let Draco make him ask any more questions.
Draco shuddered. No, he wouldn’t think of that either. He counted his breaths up to ten, again and again, and kept a vicious rein on his thoughts.
Draco kept staring, and blinking, and breathing, and half-listened as Potter started working his way around all three rooms of the tent, methodically casting
After another couple of seconds of him looking anywhere but at her gaze, the healer - doctor - seemed to take pity on him.
“What were you doing?” The male voice was rough with panic.
Draco didn’t think this was the full reason. He was not going to mention that the Path of the Penitent was exclusively house-elf magic, and the only reason he could use it was because his inheritance had connected him to his wood-elf heritage. “You want to approach them first so you can brief them on what to ask me to do, right?”
your fault. You were coerced. I don’t think it counts if you used Unforgivables under threat of an Unforgivable yourself. That’s all on Tom.”
Draco hadn’t heard his father sound so calm in a long time. Despite his stringy silver hair and puffy, bruised eye he had an air of authority. Draco ached to see it.
“And the Auror showed you which wall to use?
, when he had let himself believe that the killing was over… He was so stupid. He had thought he was safe.
Potter gave him a look that was almost sympathetic as he put Draco’s wand back into his pouch. Draco exhaled sharply, clenching his fists against the irrational surge of disappointment. Of
he could have changed its eye-watering colour into something halfway acceptable, but as it was, no. With a sigh, he reached into his school trunk and unearthed his least-elaborate summer cloak, a light, plain grey with a tasteful green trim at the very edges. He would probably look odd to the muggles, but even though it was a warm day, it was still Britain, and he wasn’t taking the risk of going anywhere in just this thin T-shirt without being able to cast an
“Hello, Myrtle. Yes, I nearly died.”
“Huh. Guess it’s really true, then.”
“I still don’t believe you would have ever wanted to become a Death Eater in the first place.”
“I find myself somewhat. Somewhat isolated, sir.”
Draco looked away and met Potter’s eyes, and Draco was surprised to see his own powerless anguish so perfectly matched. Potter stood up and brought his chair round to the right side of the bed, where he reached forward to rest his hand on Prudy’s shoulder. His fingers brushed Draco’s, but Draco wasn’t going to stop rubbing her back.
“This
Draco felt a flicker of hope, which, for some reason, in the next second, made him angry. “Quidditch, Potter! Seeking! I’m not interested in flying if I can’t do it well enough to keep up with
He was dead!”
He would be a Malfoy who kept the line intact. That was all that really mattered.
“He’s not dead. He’s been arrested, along with your parents.”
Draco pressed his lips together, hard, to stop his eyes from prickling. He fixed his father with a blazing look. “I will make you proud, father. I will not forget you. I will follow the old ways.”
“Well, whatever these charms are, I don’t know them.”
“Oh, Draco!” Her wide eyes filled with dramatic tears behind her glasses. She swooped over him to the other side of the bed, clutching at her chest and letting out a sob. “I heard all about it! It’s too dreadful! You nearly

didn’t see that arm with shards of bone poking out of it.”
Shacklebolt nodded, face still impassive.
Draco spared a moment to feel grateful that this man was clearly restraining his curiosity about why Draco didn’t know how to use a seatbelt, but the next moment he was once again occupied by the terror of the car moving out into the new, busy road. By some miracle the driver avoided all of the other hulking metal machines, and it was less alarming once they were in line with the others, all moving the same way, but still, the cars on the other side passed them by mere inches. The muggle man seemed to notice Draco’s death-grip on the seat beneath him and once again proved his worth by not attempting to speak to Draco for the rest of the journey.
The tree immediately curved a creaking branch across his lap, and Draco watched as a section of bark as wide and long as his hand peeled back for him to take. He picked it up, wincing at the obvious gash left behind. He stroked the exposed wood as if to soothe it and whispered, “Thank you, sir.”
“Easy, Malfoy, it’s just us.”
Draco’s eyes widened. Oh, Merlin, he had forgotten! How could he have done that? “I was trying to get to the hospital wing. I needed to see Prudy. She - Winky told me - about Dobby.” He fixed his gaze firmly on the ceiling, but could still see Potter stiffen. “I - I have to tell her. She doesn’t know yet, or didn’t, maybe she does now. I wanted her to hear it from me. She is - she was - she
“I’m not lying, Potter. You can do this. You’re Harry fucking Potter, okay? You can do this.”
“Months? That’s ages!”
“Mr Malfoy, I never thought you were the type to martyr yourself.” Her eyebrows raised over a pointed look. Draco recalled a certain hippogriff incident in third year and squirmed. Her voice was soft as she went on. “You have received a life-changing disability, Mr Malfoy. I have some ways I can help. But you need to tell me the details.”
He lurched out of her reach, panicking outright, and scrambled the last few metres, half-falling down the hill. He crossed channel after channel full with precious silver, smearing it on his clothes and hands as he passed, sullying, besmirching -
“I, er, might have asked them for the spiciest curry they had.”
Potter gave a half-smile. “I’ve used Unforgivables, and not even under coercion, either.”
How strange it was, to be in the Golden Trio’s own tent. For all those months, so many people had been wondering where they were, and they’d been

“It’s not Dark Magic! It’s blood magic, old magic! There’s a difference!”
hurt. He consciously resisted turning his head to the side. He heard her sensible shoes clopping on the flagstones as she hurried over to him.
How are you alive?”
,” with a swish-swish from side to side, and the whisky fumes lifted away - “
“Is Prudy okay?”
Draco coughed. “I’d say that would be a severe understatement.”
“We can go from here,” Potter said, stepping up to him. “Er - you can just hold my arm, I guess?”
“This was about a month ago, wasn’t it, Winky?”
The strike, the spells, the Dark Lord crumpling: in those final moments, for the first time in forever, Draco felt no fear. Potter’s hand snatching the Elder Wand from the air felt perfect and inevitable. Even the final tearing stab of agony from his Dark Mark couldn’t dim his elation.
- to let Draco know that he wouldn’t be asking him to talk about things he didn’t want to? Draco reeled. It fit, it felt right, but it made no
She swooped away and back again, seemingly too overwhelmed to stay still. Draco followed her progress with his eyes, wishing he could turn his head. It was now evening, and the sun was low enough to pour directly into the room. Myrtle all but disappeared in the golden swathes of light.
, for 2pm. Apparently that was way earlier than necessary, but Draco didn’t want to take any chances. He sighed and turned back to his book.
Longbottom.
Potter snorted. “This could actually kill you, couldn’t it?”
He grabbed a fluted stone pillar to stop himself from landing in a heap on the floor, and took a moment to slow his breathing a little. Being back here helped. He looked around and the familiar unearthly glow of the sunlight through the lake against the windows soothed his nerves.
Winky’s lower lip wobbled and a squeaky sob escaped her as she nodded.
from a wood-elf and a water-spirit, which is supposed to be a secret, by the way. That’s where the bark came from - my family tree.”
Potter shrugged. “If I had been in your place, and lived your life, I don’t see that I could have done things much differently. I never had to find a way to be in Tom’s presence for weeks at a time. I never had the option to try and appease him. It’s not courage to fight him when it’s the only choice you have, and it’s not cowardice to adapt to survive. Maybe I wouldn’t have bullied people at school, and
“Yeah, my bones are fine. I still have that hole in my leg though. I need to make myself some more crutches, but I don’t want anyone seeing me use the Old Magic.”
“I will. I have no Mark, and Harry Potter owes me a life-debt,” his mother said.
Draco squared his shoulders, planted his crutches, and swung at a dignified pace towards the door. He half-expected another attempt to try and stop him, but neither Potter nor the Aurors moved from beside his bed. He thought he heard the start of a hissed discussion as the door fell closed behind him.
angry, she hated him, but she was too much of a professional to let it affect her standards of care.
. As promised, the questioning never strayed towards Draco’s parents, and Shacklebolt seemed to trust that Draco was answering honestly.
would have inherited Grimmauld.”
She pursed her lips. “I really do think this is the best option, Mr Malfoy. But if the physiotherapy fails to help and the pain interferes too much with your daily life, there is always the option of amputation below the knee, and replacement with a prosthetic. That is not something any Healer would do before exhausting all the alternatives, however.”
“You didn’t kill Dumbledore. Technically, Snape did, but it was at Dumbledore’s request. Merlin, that night
a twelve-year-old took out a basilisk. I was in no way justified in being sceptical about that.” He rolled his eyes. “And the spell wants me to tell you that was sarcasm, in case you couldn’t guess. Fuck. I can’t even be sarcastic.”
“You’re not welcome here, Death Muncher. You killed the students.”
“Yes, sir.” Draco flushed, and didn’t look at Potter. He felt a ridiculous flicker of guilt for not making Potter aware of his opportunity to choose a task to ask of him. Which was stupid. It had been a sound tactical decision at the time. The way that it had back-fired on him so badly was his comeuppance for tricking him, he supposed.
A very bare, high, narrow bed, with some kind of thin blue mattress and only parchment for a covering, sat in the middle of the room, and Draco immediately wanted to leave - he didn’t want to lie on that thing while this muggle stood over him, touching him. He came to a halt only a step or two past the door and held his crutches tightly. That’s right; she couldn’t do anything to him. If she tried to, then he could grow a murder tree right out of her floorboards, see if he wouldn’t.
“I do not know what state they will have left it in, but I believe that Voldemort himself went through it, looking for clues of your whereabouts.”
“I really should have been expelled though…” Potter finally let it go with a disgruntled sigh. “Whatever. I suppose it can wait. Um, I’ve brought Prudy here with me.”
“Malfoy!” Potter’s voice cut through the rest, surprisingly close (hadn’t he left him all the way up at the top of the Hollow?). Draco tried to turn to see him, but his vision was already swimming, and he lost his balance and fell backwards, landing with a splash in the shallow pool of memories gathered in the basin.
“I’m so sorry, Andromeda - I got a late night and I overslept, I’m really sorry - ”
“Filthy little Death Eater!” A high-pitched female voice, this time.
Peeves started advancing towards him, and Draco took a hasty hop backwards, but the stairs behind him cut off any further retreat.
Draco obediently lay down on the sofa, and Winky snapped her long fingers and was suddenly holding a small wooden stool. It looked a bit like Frona’s. Did all house-elves have stools they could magically conjure?
The rest of the appointment went as smoothly as could be reasonably hoped for. There was a dicey moment when Draco was lying face down on that narrow bed and Anne Liston touched his calf for the first time. Draco tensed up, expecting the cramps to start, but it was clear this healer knew what she was doing. The massage hurt - quite a lot, when she dug her fingers into the missing flesh - but not nearly as badly as the cramps did. And afterwards, Draco could tell that the muscle felt slightly looser somehow.
“And the
Draco blinked. For a moment, he had forgotten this woman wasn’t a witch.
“I accept the mantle,” Draco said quickly, just before a hand grabbed his shoulder and wrenched him away from his father.
“Yes, see you then. And, thank you. Again.”
. Who gets rid of the Elder wand? If I’d known I was its master this year, you had better believe I’d have used it.”
He’d only watched her get

“Yes, I said elf magic,” Draco snapped. He was caught off-guard by a flare of panic, but stayed aloof thanks to long practice. “I’ll answer your questions. But not until you get rid of
He grabbed his crutches and approached the exit to the common room.
“Okay, that’s it. If you don’t get up in the next ten seconds then I’m going to hex you.”
He had already taken a step to the edge of his circle when he realised what was happening.
Draco felt cold. He took a sip of tea, and it brought some feeling back to his lips.
“I’d rather have been brave than rational. But I was intending to take your mind off things, and now I’ve fucked that right up, so let’s eat. It’s very important to have a proper supper before getting black-out drunk, you know, Potter.”
Draco gritted his teeth. He wanted very much to get angry at this upstart muggle. Who did she think she was to tell him, Draco Malfoy, what he could and couldn’t do? He took a breath through his nose, then another one, glaring across the desk at the doctor, who didn’t look nearly as cowed as she should. In fact she was looking at him with - was that
, and he hadn’t had Potter look at him like that since sixth year. It was ludicrously comforting to see it again.
“Death has taken our loved ones, but he will not take their stories from us. Let us share those stories now, so all may know how their lives touched ours.”
“Oh. I guess maybe it is a bit strange to come here. I just couldn’t - ” Potter’s voice broke, and he stopped, clenching his jaw.
Frona turned to glare at Draco. Draco wilted under her anger, his dignified posture slumping.
“ - the only thing that would have worked is fresh phoenix tears, while the wound was new. How incapacitating is the wound? How much pain are you in?”
Why was this elf so afraid of him? He was not her master, and without a wand, she was in fact much more powerful than him. Of course, house-elves as a rule had a healthy wariness of wizards, but most wizarding families had a much better relationship with their elves than the Malfoys. Could Winky know that somehow? Wait - yes, she could.
“Malfoy, I know I said I wasn’t going to ask questions, but I need to know what the hell you were thinking.” Draco braced, thinking of sixth year, or just last Saturday, trying to drag Potter off to his death. “Where were you going? Why didn’t you stay in Slytherin? You said you would!”
“Of course I am, Potter. I don’t want to turn down the chance to reciprocate on doing you a favour.”
Potter looked down at it and smiled. “Yep.”
“And how long will that take?”
“Potter - would you find her? I can’t move from this bed. I’m sorry to ask you, I know I have no right, but if you could bring her here, then I’ll - I’ll tell her…”
“Why do you need to know, sir?”
“Grimmauld Place does have some security issues,” said Shacklebolt. “I’m afraid that the Death Eaters gained access to the house at some point during the last year.”
Draco wanted to say, but he knew he would have to state that it was sarcasm, which rather took the fun out of it. He deposited the plates and hopped back to the kitchen for cutlery. “Well, at least the taxi driver was nice. I really liked him, actually. He didn’t ask any questions, and let me tell you, that was a good thing, because
“You can try that if you like.”
The Auror was bearing down on him, wand raised. “Get back in your cell! How did you get the door open?”
“Can you walk? Madam Pomfrey said it was safe for you to move your spine again…”
That wasn’t the most important thing to focus on, though. Draco needed to decide what to do with Potter’s offer. He expected it would be fewer than ten seconds before Potter withdrew it, and Draco needed to consider the possible advantages before he lost the opportunity. He didn’t have time to think it through thoroughly, though - Potter was already opening his mouth.
“I couldn’t wait that long, for a normal trial, I mean. I need to be at the Manor every new moon.” He tried to stop himself continuing, but the spell clearly knew he hadn’t properly explained. “There’s a blood ritual I have to do every month, in a room in the Manor, to keep the spirits of my ancestors alive.”
“Oh, there you are.” Potter set down a bag he’d been carrying on the dining table - the bag was made of that weird Muggle stuff, was it called plistac? - and dragged an ugly armchair to the centre of the tent to sit near the bed. He groaned in obvious pleasure at getting off his feet. “House is fine, thanks. Took all afternoon, but Bill checked every room over thoroughly and he’s satisfied he’s disabled all the traps. It’s still absolutely full of dark objects, of course, but it always was. I think the Death Eaters did me a favour by looting some of it, but actually there’s a lot less damage than I expected. We figured maybe your aunt had a thing about preserving her family’s heirlooms?”
Potter followed his lead, placing the tumblers down on the hearth and tucking his blankets around him in a much more haphazard fashion than Draco.
Draco stared at him. “How can you be so calm about this? It sounds like he was fucking
“Yes. (That was sarcasm.) But then you’d probably come in and save my life.
“It stops people from holding me somewhere against my will. Apparently it doesn’t care if someone wants to hurt me or kill me, which is a shame. I was rather hoping that it would offer me more protection than that. I expect a lot of people are going to want to finish what Peeves started, and…” Ugh. Did he really have to say it? “That scares me.”
“I’m not familiar with the way muggles live, Potter, but this doesn’t seem like a very savoury area. Why would the Blacks choose this as the location for their ancestral home?”
Draco heard Potter make a slightly strangled sound.
For a moment they just looked at each other. Draco was impressed to see how calm she looked, even while her eyes were wide with shock. He wondered whether she would approach him to try a more Muggle approach to restraining him, but perhaps he had been deemed too dangerous for that, because instead she turned away from him.
All right. He’d - he’d make a list. A list would sort things out. It would be awful seeing it all written down, but at least like that he could impose some order. Maybe it would feel less overwhelming than the images that were currently swirling round his head.
It was well into the evening when Potter came back. Draco had made himself as comfortable as he could manage in the bottom bed of one of the bunks, sitting in a nest of bedding and leaning back against the corner pillar. He was reading the
He was such an idiot. All that time he had affected Potter more than he would ever have guessed, he had unknowingly achieved what he wanted, and it had never given him any relief. For some reason his mind flashed to an image of his uncle straddled over him, grinding down on him.
Draco kept his expression calm, even as he felt himself freeze up. He hadn’t meant to say that, especially not in front of the Aurors.
“Excellent. Crutches incoming…”
“All right, all
For a second, Draco wondered how Prudy could possibly already know that he was now Lord Malfoy, but there was no accounting for the way house-elf magic worked.
Granger.
Peeves screeched and hurled the stone down onto him. The branches splintered but held, and continued to thicken, weaving themselves across the remaining holes.
“Three times what?”
At half one, Draco couldn’t take it any more. He heaved himself up off the bed, gripped his crutches with clammy palms, and began to get ready to leave. He counted the muggle money that Potter had left him (of course, Draco had paid him back in galleons, and had even erred on the generous side as neither of them had been sure about the exchange rate). He carefully transferred the strange coins and flimsy scraps to his money pouch. He tied the money pouch to one of the denim belt loops, wishing he could wear a robe like normal, because the pouch did look a little ridiculous bouncing against his hip.
Draco bristled, but he couldn’t argue. He’d never thought of himself as a bully before, but it was the right word, wasn’t it? And beneath the reflexive offence, a part of him was desperate to believe Potter’s words.
“What about Dobby, sir? Is Master Draco knowing where Dobby is?”
Draco nodded.
Once they both had their plates loaded with a mix of rice and curry, Potter looked up and their eyes caught across the table. Draco realised suddenly that they were about to
Frona stared at him for several long seconds, and Draco didn’t dare to look away. Eventually, she nodded, apparently satisfied with whatever she saw on his face.
He turned back to the tent. The only times he had been camping were as a seven-year-old sleeping in his enchanted treehouse in the orchard at the Manor, and at the Quidditch World Cup every four years, when their tent more closely resembled a portable palace.
“Look at me when I’m talking, worm!” His voice had gone rough and breathy around the edges, and his eyes were raking across Draco’s face and then down Draco’s body. “Someone should - should really teach you some manners, eh,
“Come on. It was just an illusion. There’s nothing to be scared of.”
“Gods, Potter. That’s a lot.”
Before he could stop himself, Draco covered his left forearm with his right palm. The bandage was still wrapped securely around the Mark under his shirt sleeve.
,” and Potter took a grateful breath as his stomach settled. “
“I thank you for my life, Madam Pomfrey. If there is anything that the House of Malfoy can do for you, my door is always open.”
He had barely gone two steps when Peeves drifted out from the wall ahead, just beyond the crater.
“I’ll - I’ll come back tomorrow.”
to confirm it.
Draco tucked the right crutch under his other arm and grabbed Potter’s left arm just above the elbow. Draco wondered if Potter felt as awkward about touching as he did. Probably, because Potter wasted no time before turning and dragging Draco into the darkness.
“So… do you… have mine?” Draco held his breath.
His breath was coming faster and faster. He wanted to retch, he felt dizzy, he was shaking. He clung to his knees. His chest was getting tighter and tighter, the pain building. He knew he was doomed and he could only wish that he could muster enough backbone to die with some fucking dignity in front of Potter. But no. He was too damn
Potter blanched, then pressed his lips together. Draco wondered if Potter was now, technically, a murderer - although the Dark Lord had fallen from his own spell… Did
He checked the pocket watch again. The delicate gold hands told him it was barely nine thirty. Potter had ordered him a muggle carriage - a car - no, a
He reached up and wrapped his hand around the post nearest his head. The touch of the polished wood instantly made the old magic reverberate through him, and he felt a fierce joy at possessing a form of magic that was bred into his bones, and could never be taken away from him.
“Yes, actually, that would be a fraction more respectable.”
He tested himself by lifting his head from his knees and looking at the fire. It was just the familiar common room fire, friendly and warming. He breathed a sigh of relief. At least he didn’t have a phobia to deal with on top of everything else.
After a couple more failed attempts to reach Draco through the deceptively solid air, Potter shook his head slightly and first the female Auror and then Potter stepped away. Draco felt a surge of satisfaction that they were walking backwards, too wary to let him out of their sight.
“Hello, Master Draco, sir! Mr Potter is saying you were injured, sir?”
He swallowed, remembering his latest magical vision. He’d never thought - it would never have occurred to him that he had succeeded in doing what he’d been trying to do all those years: make Potter feel small. But apparently he had managed that without even trying, from the moment he had started talking in Madam Malkin’s. He hadn’t realised it was Potter at the time of course, and if pressed, he wouldn’t have been able to recall anything he’d said. He had been making polite conversation; that was all it took. Just naturally obnoxious, he supposed.
He dared a glance at Potter’s face, hoping not to find a question there that would compel him to admit even more. It was almost worse that Potter clearly understood.
The next moment the man was walking around the front of the car towards him. Draco froze, but, barring a bit of an odd look at his cloak, the man didn’t approach closer than to operate the unfamiliar handle on the car door and open it with a soft clunk.
Potter’s eyes widened. “Wow. That wouldn’t have caused problems at
“Ah. Right. And how long ago did this happen?”
Potter turned away abruptly. Draco flinched, but relaxed slightly when Potter threw a parting remark back over his shoulder.
“Malfoy, this is brilliant,
“Prudy!”
That didn’t seem likely somehow; Potter had always been more direct than that. A strange thought occurred to him. Could Potter’s intention be to
Draco stopped struggling. He was only making himself look more pathetic. He settled for sitting up and using one hand to try and persuade his rigid calf muscle to relax. He glared at the wet grass between his knees, steadfastly ignoring Potter standing over him, and blinking several times to clear his eyes of the tears that the pain had forced to the surface.
“No! As I said, I am
Of course, he would have to go out again soon and continue his search for Potter, but he couldn’t go any further without some kind of crutch. He turned right and hopped down the passage to the boys’ dormitories, barely noticing the way his breaths sounded more like sobs at this point. He collapsed gratefully through the door to the seventh years’ room, sinking onto his bed and allowing himself to lie back against the pillows for a moment.
Wait. Potter had needed to die?
“No. My psychotic aunt did. In my house. I wouldn’t blame you for blaming me, Potter, at least a little. But, well, I doubt it’ll help, but I am - ” He had to swallow as his voice thickened. “I am exceedingly sorry that he’s dead.”
In other circumstances, Draco would have felt pissed off after a night spent on the most uncomfortable mattress he had ever had the misfortune to encounter. His back ached almost as much as his leg. But as it was, that discomfort barely registered, because today he had to talk to muggles.
justified. Malfoy, I - about the, the bathroom, I never even said that I’m - ”
Prudy’s squeaky voice came from somewhere below Draco’s line of sight, from around Potter’s feet.
“It’s the Bloody Baron - he has been standing guard over you ever since you were brought in. He won’t let Peeves anywhere near you. Now you just relax while I finish my examination.”
Potter was coughing across the table. He jumped up urgently and grabbed a glass, gasping “
“Yes.” And now he was going to tell Potter about his powers, and there was nothing he could do about it. Draco felt stirrings of panic. This was worse than Veritaserum. At least a truth potion let you be evasive. “I can get wood to grow in any way I want, even dead wood. I should be able to affect water too, because I am also descended from a water spirit, but I haven’t had a chance to test that power yet. Did the tree actually kill my - him?”
Potter scowled. He adjusted his grip on his wand.
“This whole situation is exceedingly strange, Potter. I never thought we’d see the day when you thanked me.”
to you. For having a shred of empathy. I hate this fucking spell!”
“Yeah?”
Draco managed a jerky nod.
“Hey, Malfoy, Jesus - take it easy…”
By the time he reached the final tree at the back of the room, his wonder had been worn down by pain. He sat heavily with his back against the enormous, wizened trunk, gasping. After a minute of resting with his head back, he felt somewhat better, and opened his eyes.
He averted his eyes from the rest of the list, not wanting any more names to jump out at him. Instead he reached for the quill and ink, and, with handwriting that was much more shaky than usual, wrote
Potter stormed past the tree and Draco realised that, somehow, in the next second, he had to stop him. If Potter got between him and the table then he could stop him getting to the mug of bark tea, and it would all be over. So he did the only thing he could do.
Potter cleared his throat. “Looks like Tom added his own little something to the security. Only someone with the Dark Mark can get through the doorway.”
, and he let me put the DA at risk during your raid. I’m sure he did care about you, he probably agonised over it and wished he could help you, but you were just too valuable a tool to spare.”
Draco grabbed it and didn’t let himself think as Potter pulled him up onto his one working foot. He was surprised to find that he actually could stand up.
“Who are you?”
“We must consider our next move,” his father said quietly, making sure his voice didn’t carry.
“Isn’t that, like, blasphemy? I thought you literally had your ancestors living inside of you.”
“I’m not going to use anything against you, Malfoy. Well, I did agree that I’d ask you about the other Death Eaters, and you’ll need to explain the Path thing properly to the others, too, but I - I didn’t tell them about the wood-elf thing.”
“It’ll be fine, Malfoy. There’s only a couple of Aurors out there right now, and they’ve been briefed on the situation. Now’s a good time to make a move, actually.”
Draco nodded, staring sightlessly at the wet table.
Shacklebolt looked at Potter, at Draco, then back at Potter. Draco could not interpret his calm expression.
me, Malfoy - ”
Draco eyed the spine of
Draco rolled his eyes, but he didn’t actually feel as exasperated as he normally did by Myrtle’s wheedling. In fact, he felt a sense of warmth unfurling at the sight of her. He hadn’t thought there would be a single being in this castle who would voluntarily come to pay him a visit.
“I can’t
Potter ran a hand through his hair, took a deep breath, and kept going.
It looked just like the ceiling of the potions classroom.
Lucius cleared his throat. “It is time for you to come into your inheritance.” Draco snapped his gaze back to his father’s face. “If I am Lord of the Manor when they sentence me, they will take our whole estate in reparations, and the house of Malfoy will be lost. If
“So you’re an elf?”
For a moment Draco could vividly imagine the terror of the Snatchers crashing in, of being dragged out by the hair, tied up and brought to the Manor to be tortured and killed. Someone, surely Granger, had done that stinging hex on Potter’s face - how could she have thought of that, in the same moment as their sanctuary was invaded? Merlin. There was being intellectually quick-witted, and then there was having nerves of steel.
There was a sound like Peeves hitting the wall. Draco could no longer see beyond the lattice of branches.
Well. Let it never be said that Malfoys didn’t have manners. “Thank you, Potter.” And then, because of the bloody Path spell, he added, “I’m really quite confused about why you’d be nice to me, but I like it.”
“How long was I out for?”
Winky’s watery eyes peered through her fingers at him, and Draco took a deep breath and kept talking. “I heard his last words, I think. I remember he said, ‘Dobby is a free elf.’ He was - he was so proud of being free.”
A simple thought of what he needed was enough to set the post writhing as it remembered how it had felt to be a living tree. It sprouted a single branch, which grew strong and straight and into a distinctive crutch shape. As soon as it was finished, Draco reached up and took it, and the post obligingly dropped it for him and started growing another one.
His father gave him a small smile, approval radiating from him. Draco tried to drink it in, tried to store it away so it could sustain him after he could no longer have his father.
“Tell me about it.”
Winky hesitantly touched his forehead. Draco felt the low-level headache that he had almost stopped noticing starting to ease. He opened his eyes and saw Winky flinch back, as if expecting Draco to strike her for daring to touch his face.
“Then I think… I think the best thing to do is to offer your full cooperation to the aurors.” His father sounded resigned. “Tell them everything you know. It should help them capture and get convictions for much worse offenders than you. It will give you something to bargain with for leniency in your own sentencing.”
“That doesn’t sound like rehabilitation - that’s hardly better than now!”
“I thought I said no Aurors, Potter.”
, it said at the top. There was a key declaring the colour code: red for Potter, orange for Weasley and blue for Granger. The list of chores started in Granger’s writing with things like
“That’s it! Now grab my hand and haul away.”
Eventually he recovered enough of his presence of mind to look around. The pavement here was much wider and cleaner than at Grimmauld Place, and the buildings rose regal and imposing and white. Draco was grateful to spot his destination almost immediately, just a little way along the street - a large free-standing black sign declared in gold capitals, ‘Phoenix Physiotherapy’ with the names of six or seven different muggle healers listed underneath in smaller writing. It also had a stylised picture of a bird rising from a gold flame. Draco swung himself over to it, and saw Dr. Anne Liston’s name first on the list, followed by a jumble of letters that perhaps equated to some kind of muggle titles or qualifications.
He swung his legs out of the bed and heaved himself to a sitting position, ducking his head to avoid the slats of the bunk-bed above him. He groaned as the movement reignited that stabbing sensation in his head. Ugh. He had forgotten he no longer had a wand; he couldn’t use his normal barrage of spells to get past the hangover. How did muggles manage? Perhaps Potter would take pity and cast them on him.
“If it isn’t ickle Drakey Foulmouth, the Death Muncher. Mouldy Voldy’s little friend…”
Draco swallowed forcefully. She was sitting so close. He wanted to shut his eyes to avoid her earnest look, but that would be cowardly. Shit, he really didn’t want to do this.
“I reckon if you don’t come, then you’ll regret it for a long time. Is that true?”
The next moment heat kicked the back of his throat, his tongue was bathed in flames, and he was spluttering for breath.
“M-Malfoy - I c-can’t! I can’t go, I can’t face it, and now Ginny w-won’t even be there, well she
He paused and blew out a slow breath. Okay. No stopping to think. Evaluate later. Just write.
, at least he had some breathing room… but not enough. Draco thought back to his father’s arrest at the end of fifth year. The Dark Lord had broken his father and the other Death Eaters out of Azkaban again before there had been time for the hearings to start, but before that, the Malfoy solicitors had warned Draco and his mother that the trial could last for months. And now that the war was over, there would be dozens of cases to try. Would that make the process faster or slower? Would they rush all the Death Eaters through, or would they leave some of them waiting years? Either way, Draco doubted he’d be front of the queue. They’d want to try the most serious offenders first, that’s what the public would demand, and Draco had never killed anyone. Thank Merlin.
Draco gave him a stiff nod.
Potter laughed and peered closer. “Is that
Draco took a deep breath. “As you wish. A house-elf called Frona told me about it. She’s the grandmother of my house-elf Prudy.” Potter’s eyes went hard again at the mention of her name, but he didn’t interrupt. “Frona is ancient, and remembers her people’s ways. She said that the Path of the Penitent used to be invoked by house-elves back in the old days, when they served wizards and witches without being magically bound to us.”
Draco was once again grateful for the Dreamless Sleep when he woke up the next day. Without night terrors or visions for a couple of nights, and with Madam Pomfrey carefully making sure he ate enough, he had some energy again. He was not strong, and not whole, since his leg still cramped occasionally and most of the bones in his torso and arm still ached, but he would take this over the way he’d felt for the last two years.
“Got your father’s looks too, didn’t you, pretty boy. What a waste. Bet you’ve never even been touched, have you?”
He tried to settle with the SAS survival guide again, as it had been quite interesting yesterday, but he couldn’t focus. He
“Potter. You. You actually. Died?”
Draco passed McGonagall on his left (
Draco lowered himself back to the armchair while the doctor rolled back around to her side of the desk, reaching for a notebook and beginning to scribble into it. Draco heard her muttering, “… perhaps eighty percent muscle loss…”
“That’s really helped.”
Draco jumped, but didn’t have time to react further before a rush of cold air moved over him, and he felt his tongue roll back against the roof of his mouth. A flutter of panic rose in his chest, but the next moment, his tongue was released.
” and gulping it down. Before Draco could find his voice, Potter grabbed another glass, filled it, and thrust it towards him.
.” He jutted his chin at the Aurors.
Draco kept his eyes closed and managed to gradually calm his breathing. He could still feel the terror swilling around inside him, but it was muted for now. He opened his eyes again as Madam Pomfrey resumed talking.
“How are you feeling, Prudy? Are you completely healed?” Out of the corner of his eye, Draco saw Potter take a seat in one of the transfigured chairs from earlier.
, for Gods’ sake?
“Is that your house-elf’s name? What do you care?”
But now Potter knew that Malfoy had no leverage; he had to answer Potter’s questions whether he wanted to or not. There was no reason for him to keep the Aurors out of it. Draco tensed, waiting for him to dismiss the privacy charm and call them over.
“My house-elf.”
? Sure - of
Weasley’s face softened around his scars as he broke away from glaring at Draco to look at Potter. “Harry. It’s your house. You can invite whoever you like to stay in it. I’m just surprised - well, you’re a bigger man than me, that’s all.”
He was in no shape to go anywhere. Fuck. He would have to lie here, flat on his back, and wait for Peeves to come back and finish the job at his leisure. His breathing immediately started to speed up. He cast about for something wooden, so he wouldn’t be completely defenceless, but there was no wood within reach - the bedstead was metal.
With deep breaths, he gradually got himself back under control, wiping away the last tears with the back of his hand. Gods, he was so tired. When had he last slept? How many days had it been since the battle? He had passed out when his father had given him the old magic, and when the Path of the Penitent had triggered the vision of how he had wronged Potter, but neither of those counted as rest. The last time he’d slept properly was in this very bed, and that night he’d woken in the early hours to his Mark burning, and the news that Potter was back.
” and Potter looked up, blinking as his headache disappeared. Draco grinned involuntarily at the feeling of the magic travelling down his arm. He drew a slow, flat circle in front of him and said, “
“We come back to the original point. I presume that, once the Manor is declared safe, you will take up residence there?”
Bribery? No, no, no - the Ministry would seize all their assets anyway.
“Oh, well. No-one’s asked about the murder tree, I think maybe they assumed that Malfoy Manor is just like that. But I said that you used accidental magic to make that lattice-shield. They seemed to buy it?”
Potter jumped up from the armchair and started pacing in front of one of the fireplaces. Draco felt a disorienting surge of bitter envy that he could no longer do the same thing.
Draco reared back as a multitude of thick ropes flew towards him, but just as before, the ropes hit an invisible barrier a foot from his face, and fell to the floor between the beds. Draco stared down at the tangle for a moment until the ropes faded out of existence, then raised his head slowly, expression as hard as he could make it.
Potter nodded, and squirmed a little in his chair. Draco supposed it should be better that Potter felt uncomfortable too, but instead it just seemed to double the amount of awkwardness. Draco was certain his face was pink.
Draco stood watching the spot where he’d lost track of the taxi as it got absorbed back into the other traffic, just breathing. So. His first muggle. His first car-ride. Not so bad.
Dressing himself brought yet another first: a muggle T-shirt and jeans. Weasley had left them in the drawer under one of the bunk beds, and they fit relatively well. Draco felt quite strange wearing the outfit, but he couldn’t decide if it was weirder to be wearing muggle clothing or to be wearing something of Weasley’s. Ah well, at least the clothes were comfortable, and Potter assured him that they would be more appropriate than wearing the shirt and trousers from his school uniform. Naturally, Potter had also ruled out any of the robes packed in his trunk, even the casual ones.
“Draco, my darling, your father is right. It is over for us. We will submit to however the new regime sees fit to treat us. You have by far the harder role to fill. You must keep the house of Malfoy from falling into the hands of the blood traitors. All they see is our wealth and our estates. They do not know the old magic. You are the only one who can uphold it. You must fight for your freedom.”
Draco blinked, and was taken off guard by a brief, vivid sense-memory of wood under his hands, heat all around him and smoke in his lungs. His breath caught as if the smoke was real and he descended into a coughing fit.
“It’ll still be much

“Oh God, I wish I wasn’t, I really wish I wasn’t…”
to fulfil his life-debts. A few days ago it had worried him to be so indebted to Potter, but now he wouldn’t have been surprised if Potter never claimed them at all.
“No. In fact, I am now officially embarrassed, Potter, because I have to tell you that I had never, until this very moment, even thought about what people in India might eat.”
“Old - really, Potter? That’s what you called him?”
Weasley gave him a relieved nod. “Good. Okay. Sorry, I know you wouldn’t, but I was starting to get a bit worried. Mum and dad - they need all of us, all their remaining children with them for that, you know?”
is a five in comparison.”
Draco had just finished an awkward meal (lying flat on one’s back while eating a sandwich was not very comfortable or dignified) when the first of his visitors arrived. It was Potter. He was panting as if he’d run all the way there.
“Hello, Potter,” Draco said, playing up his accent for old times’ sake. He was pleased to note that speaking was significantly less painful now that he’d slept a little. “What do you want?”
And joy rose in him before his brain had even fully understood why. Even as the Dark Lord put him next on the list to die after Potter, he could only feel relief. Never in all those miserable wandless weeks would he have thought he could be so searingly grateful to see his wand clutched tight in Potter’s hand.
Which was a good thing, because he needed to stay objective for this. Perhaps if he treated it as if it was a piece of homework… He smirked slightly at the thought. Well, why not?
Draco bridled.
Lucius turned back to look at him. He lifted his right arm, and Draco did too, and they clasped their bleeding hands together as if they were about to have an arm-wrestling match.
He could have kept playing with the water for a lot longer, but the stream from the shower was becoming rapidly cooler and his right leg was getting quite uncomfortable. Reluctantly, he let his hand drop and the water snake in front of him immediately lost its form, splashing to the ground.
As soon as he stopped crying, Potter tipped his head back and drained his glass down in one, without even flinching. Then he held out his hand. Draco passed him the bottle.
Draco!”
The remnants of his extended family flashed through his mind. Literally every one of them was now dead or incarcerated - no, except for his aunt Andromeda. Whose daughter had just been killed in the battle in which he had fought on the wrong side.
“Is Master wishing to return to the Manor now?” Prudy asked.
” Which reminded him. “That’s three times now. Bloody hell.”
“I know, Prudy, but you need time to grieve. I’m not sending you away, okay? This isn’t a punishment. It’s just for a week.”
He had to tell Prudy. He wanted her to hear it from him. Yesterday, Potter had said that Madam Pomfrey had been taking care of her, so probably that meant she was in the hospital wing.
This time, Draco found himself looking into an oak wood, dusky sunlight falling softly onto the summer leaves. The ancestral grove.
Potter blinked at him.
“You know who else wanted eternal life, Malfoy? Tom.”
“Yes, Potter. I can’t actually do anything
“What? That’s not what I said, Mr Malfoy. There is a lot we can do to improve your situation. Our first ports of call are going to be breaking up the scar tissue, and strengthening the remaining muscle so that it doesn’t get so easily overloaded.”
He retrieved the letter from his uniform trouser pocket, and smoothed out the too-thin not-parchment. He read the details through again, although he already had them memorised: Dr. Anne Liston, 3pm, Phoenix Physiotherapy, Harley Street. He frowned at the address. How did this muggle woman know about phoenixes?
After a few seconds, the spell kicked in, forcing him to answer Potter’s question.
Maybe… maybe Prudy could just apparate him home on the nights of the new moon? He could be back in his cell in less than an hour. It wasn’t too much of a risk, was it? But no, he was being stupid. He had only been shoved in this dungeon underneath Hogwarts as a temporary measure, while everyone finished clearing up after the battle. Hogwarts was warded to the eyries against intruders, but its dungeons resembled nothing more than dingy classrooms. Soon he’d be transferred to await trial in the Ministry cells, or, or in Azkaban, and both of those places had had centuries to close all the loop-holes of a wizarding prison. They would have safeguards against house-elf abilities.
“Hey, you actually mean it. Well. Thanks, Malfoy.”
Potter laughed. “A bit of both, probably. She’s come a long way, but I’m pretty sure Hermione still believes deep down that it’s worse to get expelled than killed.”
“Jesus fuck. Hold on, Malfoy.
“Your eyes - they went all black for a second.”
, like he stood out more from the background than other people did. Draco could hardly be bothered to notice the Aurors behind him.
“… They did?”
Anne Liston smiled. “Poppy and I go back a long way, Mr Malfoy. We did a good deal of medical training together. And unfortunately, you are not the only patient that she has needed to refer to me during this terrible war you’re having.”
He was definitely lying in a hospital bed, but the room didn’t look like the hospital wing. It still looked like Hogwarts though. Bright sunlight bathed the familiar grey stone of the arched ceiling in gold.
“Yeah, it was.”
“So… you coming?”
“Not to me, it’s not, Potter. I feel as though I’m naked.”
He laboriously rolled up his socks so he could get them on more easily; he winced as he tried to manoeuvre his left foot into his school shoe without pressuring his calf muscle. Finally, he considered the issue of outerwear. Weasley had left a ratty Chudley Cannons’ sweater behind, but Draco could not bring himself to wear it. If he’d had his wand, then
Draco fumbled for his money-pouch, pulling out a handful of crumpled notes and random coins. He stared at them for a moment, before the man seemed to realise that he needed help with this too and plucked one of the notes from his hands.
Madam Pomfrey’s shoulders slumped a bit. “Essentially, yes. There’s no way to remove him from the castle, I’m afraid. Believe me, a few people have tried in the last thousand years and it never ends well for them.”
“Prudy, I’m so sorry - your brother - Dobby, he, he’s - ”
he thought, and then gave way to the blackness.
“Sit.”
, Malfoy?”
His mother frowned at his father. “You know that it doesn’t work that way. He owes Draco less than nothing. In fact, Draco owes
Potter was watching his fingers as he picked at the fabric of the armchair like the barbarian he was. A strange thought flitted across Draco’s mind - could Potter be giving him space? He dismissed the idea instantly. Potter was a tactless oaf, there was
“I’ll send Bill Weasley over, I know he’d be happy to help. Tell me as soon as he’s finished and I’ll arrange the ceremony to set up the new Fidelius. In the meantime, stay alert - I doubt it would occur to the remaining Death Eaters to risk turning up there, but you never know. Some of them may be specifically hoping to get their revenge on you, or to claim the Elder Wand.”
Potter looked just the same as he ever had, and yet different. He was taller, skinnier, and obviously exhausted. But he still had that same
Madam Pomfrey flinched. “No sudden movements with your arms, Mr Malfoy, you mustn’t jar your spine - or I will have to sedate you again. And no matter what else you may be, Mr Malfoy, you are still a student under my care. Besides, no-one deserves to have an undead vigilante deciding whether one lives or dies.”
then I’d say… a five.”
“Really, I would never have guessed. And who were the other two?”
“How did you get into Slytherin, anyway?”
He leant inside the low door for a moment, and Draco heard another metallic clunk before the man withdrew and stood back politely. Draco was impressed by the man’s easy manners, and he managed to give a stiff nod of acknowledgement as he stepped up to the car.
The elf was shaking her head back and forth so hard her ears flapped. “Prudy is forbidden to harm wizards and witches - ”
Draco blinked. “I’m not a student. I’m a Death Eater.” He suddenly realised that his hospital gown had short sleeves, and his Dark Mark was visible where his left arm rested on top of the covers. He shoved it under the covers instead, ignoring the increase in throbbing from his shoulder.
“Potter…” McGonagall looked like she was struggling to decide which words to use. “Are you - quite sure you wish to offer Malfoy your hospitality? He has the means to rent temporary accommodation.”
, but Potter was not under any magical obligation to tell him about it. Even answering Draco’s questions to this extent was surprising. Perhaps Potter’s noble ideals made him think he should be fair or something, given how much Draco had revealed. Well, Draco was going to have to rely rather heavily on Potter’s noble ideals now, wasn’t he, so he shouldn’t really sneer at them.
“Yeah! It was her I thought of, you know, just before I, before he - and every night in this fucking tent, I’d look at her little dot on the map - I just thought, you know, that we’d, that we were meant to - oh, it’s so fucking stupid. I’m not supposed to be upset about this! I’m meant to think about Fred, for God’s sake!”
“Argh, fuck - it burns!”
” Three voices intoned at once.
His father had passed on the parchment and now turned back.
slump. He would keep his shoulders back and look at Potter, no matter how much he wanted to shrivel up and die.
Weasley ducked out of the tent, and Potter turned back on his way out to hold the flap back for Draco.
“That, Potter, was a bloody good meal.”
He watched out of the corner of his eye, and a few seconds later he saw Weasley and Granger get up and walk out of the hall.
Then Draco realised where he was sitting. Crabbe’s bed. He glanced down to the foot of it and saw Crabbe’s cloak still tossed haphazardly over the covers. For a second a crushing pain
on his drawing room floor, done nothing while she
“I only wish they hadn’t torn the posters in Sirius’s room…” Potter sighed, and ran his hands through his messy hair. “Anyway. You’ll be glad to know Bill got rid of Old Dusty too.”
As soon as they landed, Draco yanked his hand away from Potter’s arm. He hadn’t taken enough time to make sure he had his balance. Instinctively, he put his left foot down as he lost his centre of gravity. His calf immediately flared in agony.
The conversation was not plentiful, but it wasn’t stilted either, and it centred mainly on the food. When Draco had finished scraping the little box for the last taste of the curry (without even transferring it to his plate first - mother would have been shocked), he sat back on his chair with a replete sigh.
“There is a way.” Frona’s voice was croaky with age. Both Draco and Prudy turned to her.
How could he have forgotten the Dementor’s Kiss?
understands that the battle is finished and that we don’t need him to defend the castle anymore. And thirdly, he knows not to mess with my hospital wing.” Madam Pomfrey crossed her arms with a glower and for a moment Draco could almost see her magic crackling around her.
You’re no fun, Draco.” Then she swooped off, going directly through Potter on her way to the wall.
“Please -
“Yes, I did, Potter.
The minutes passed with excruciating slowness. He wanted to get out his pocket watch, but he had a feeling it wasn’t a very muggle item and he was too embarrassed to reach for it. He could hear the tick of a clock just above him on the wall, but he didn’t want to crane around to see it, he would look stupid if he did that. He settled his crutches against one side of the arm chair and gripped his hands together tightly. They were getting sweaty. He could feel sweat beginning to prick at the edges of his hairline too. Oh Gods, why was he here? These muggles couldn’t help him! If magic couldn’t fix his leg, how could a muggle? More likely they’d cut it off, yes, and they would have to hold him down while he screamed from the pain, and it would take ages, because they would have to cut through every part of his leg slowly with a knife…
He arranged one crutch under each arm and stood up. The crutches were exactly his size - they nestled neatly into each armpit, with a cross-bar for his hands to hold at just the right height. He carefully leaned his weight on them and swung his right foot forward. It was easy, and his left foot never had to touch the ground at all.
, Draco! I thought we were friends?”
“You know I haven’t. Potter, are you sure this is edible? How have the muggles made it that colour?”
“You’re the Weasley who - ”
The hospital wing was on the far side of the castle, on the first floor. He turned right and started back along towards the cells, trying to place his crutches quietly onto the stone. Before he got to the corner that would put him in sight of the Auror on guard duty, he turned off into a corridor on the left, which led to some stairs up to ground-level.
Draco had
“Potter, if you don’t go to this funeral you will regret it for a very long time - ”
Draco nodded, and slowly eased his left foot onto the floor. He was able to touch the sole of his shoe down with no ill effects, but as soon as he actually pressed rather than hovered, the cramping gripped his calf. The pain radiated all the way down to his heel and up to the back of his knee. Draco gripped the desk tightly and couldn’t help the way he hissed, squeezed his eyes shut, and tensed. He couldn’t even reach down and knead his leg with his knuckles to help ease them faster.
The man got into his big black car and drove away.
Potter shrugged, faux-nonchalant. “Oh, you know, saw him in the afterlife. Had a bit of a chat before I came back, straightened it all out.” His eyes flicked over to Draco, and he grinned at his gormless expression.
His eyes prickled. It wasn’t fair. He’d survived so much, and he knew he had no right to expect to be unscathed, but having to limp around like this was so fucking undignified. He couldn’t bear to be seen clunking around on crutches and failing at basic tasks. He had no wand and he could barely even walk. He was pathetic.
Draco came to with a huge gasp. He was lying shirtless on his back on a hard stone floor, although someone had bundled some fabric behind his head as a makeshift pillow. He opened his eyes and stared at the stone ceiling, surprised to find it quite familiar.
He nodded to her when the pain had passed, and they made towards the large wooden door leading to the drawing room, Draco limping as quietly as he could behind Prudy. He found that if he barely pressed the sole of his left foot to the floor while putting most of his weight on the cane and moving his right foot as quickly as possible, he could manage to avoid triggering a full cramp in his leg. It still throbbed with every step though, and the carpet did little to muffle the clunk of his cane hitting the stone floor in the stillness.
It’s completely fair. I owe you, Potter, and not just for the life-debts. I’ve been shitty to you since the first time we met and this is the way I’m atoning. This is my punishment, don’t you get it? I’m not going to Azkaban. This is what I’m doing instead. So if it sucks sometimes, then good. That’s how it should be. That’s fair.”
, and spoke with the unfailing grace of Draco’s mother offering the Dark Lord more tea.
, thought Draco, and felt himself passing out for the second time in two days.
before…”
. “I’m scared you blame me for Dobby’s death.”
“Well, you saved my life.”
And Potter just kept crying this time, great heaving sobs that went on and on, and no amount of Draco making gentle circles on his back with his hand seemed to help at all. Finally, Potter raised his head off his knees and turned his head to look straight at Draco, his whole face swollen and his eye-lashes clumped together with tears.
He forced himself not to eat too fast, or too much. He had seen what happened when Ollivander had done that the first time Draco got home for the holidays in sixth year. Ollivander had nearly died. Draco had made a point to read up a bit about starvation after that. When he returned to Hogwarts that spring, he charged Prudy to continue the nightly ritual of sneaking food to Ollivander.
part-Indian on my dad’s side.”
Potter’s laugh was more of a bitter sob. “That’s - that’s about the size of it, yeah.”
Draco took a breath and was surprised by how much less tight his chest felt. “Okay, good. Let’s go, then.”
Potter looked up at him. “You know it?”
She frowned crossly, but reached up and grabbed his hand in her small one. With her other hand, she dragged one finger an inch along his skin. Draco flinched slightly, but it didn’t even hurt that much. His leg was worse. A shallow cut had opened, enough for a few beads of blood to rise to the surface. He wiped his hand across the wall in front of him, wincing as the rough stone caught the cut. Immediately, the stone melted away to form a rough archway.
“Yes. Every head of the family, right back to when we were an actual oak tree, continues to live in me and in that room in the Manor, as long as I replenish their spirits every new moon. We’ve kept the line unbroken for over two thousand years. This is all also, obviously, a family secret.”
Draco put his crutches down on the floor and rolled up the rough denim of the left leg of the jeans. He startled a little at a low rumbling sound, but when he looked up, he saw it was just the sound that the wheels of the doctor’s chair as she pulled herself around her desk to take a closer look.
Draco took a deep breath, planted his right foot against the ground, and seized the muggle’s hand. It was dry and warm, and in one smooth movement the man had pulled him up and out.
Draco snorted. “Well, it’s tasty, but I don’t know how people in India do it. I swear, that curry was trying to kill me.”
Draco noted that he was becoming very slightly inured to the wash of exposure every time he had to explain himself to Potter. His lungs felt raw and his heart was beating fast, but so far in this conversation Potter was yet to make him feel actively
“Myrtle… thank you for coming to see me.” Myrtle stopped crying, and her eyes nearly bugged out behind her glasses as she stared at him. Right, of course - Draco never said thank you to her before. Well, damn it, if he could be earnest with Potter, he could be sincere with a ghost - with his only remaining friend at Hogwarts. “I - I appreciate it, Myrtle. And I know it must be a blow to discover that I somehow survived again.”
He could sit down, he supposed, but what if a crutch slipped from beneath the cloak? And what if he needed to move away quickly? It would take him far too long to get up again.
Finally, his leg settled down again, and he sucked in a couple of restoring breaths with relief.
Myrtle was halfway through a rather bloodthirsty story of taking vengeance on her former childhood nemesis, when
, barely up to his chest. How did muggles get in and out of these things with anything resembling dignity? With his hands occupied by his crutches, it was a lost cause.
For the next two hours Shacklebolt and Draco discussed every Death Eater not yet dead or captured, followed by everything Draco knew about the location and defences of various Death Eater safe-houses, as well as Malfoy Manor and what traps may have been set there. McGonagall took her leave immediately and Madam Pomfrey soon left them to it, coming over now and again to bring Draco a drink of water that he had to sip through a straw, or silently cast some diagnostic spell over him. Potter listened avidly to every detail of the conversation, but did not once ask Draco anything, although he obviously wanted to several times. He had not known Potter was capable of such restraint, and felt surprised that Potter bothered to spend the effort summoning it for
Winky popped in to leave his packed trunk at the foot of his bed. Draco was surprised when she took a second to hop up onto the bed and tell him, in her squeaky voice, that she was sorry he had been hurt and happy that he had survived. McGonagall visited briefly after breakfast to say thank you for his offer of making more healing potions, and add a package of ingredients to his trunk. At midday, he was finally allowed to move, and Madam Pomfrey helped him get changed out of his hospital gown and into his own clothes. He wore a dark blue casual robe, no school uniform for him any more. Potter arrived around mid-afternoon to take him away.
for me. I fucking deserve this! Why should I ever get to fly again?
“Shit - Malfoy - what time is it?”
Potter took a large step towards the tent entrance, then buckled, one hand going to his head and one to his mouth. He turned abruptly and ran in crouching steps to the tiny bathroom. Draco heard the ugly sounds of retching and his own stomach tightened in disgust. Draco took a few deep breaths to keep himself under control. Rusty as he was, he still had more practice than Potter at dealing with a hangover, and there was only one loo.
Draco sniffed, pretending to look offended. “Yes I did, Potter, and we both know that’s because I’m a clueless, aristocratic prat.”
“I didn’t want this, oh God, I didn’t want this, I didn’t want to take his parents away, not so soon… oh Merlin, he didn’t even have one whole fucking month with them, even I had a
The ground fell away in a great bowl shape, the rim forming a perfect circle from the natural grass and granite of the landscape. Down below, in the centre, Draco could see the two bodies laid side by side under a stasis charm. At a glance, the werewolf looked older and his cousin looked younger than he expected. They lay on a bed of woven branches and twigs, which in turn lay in the middle of a large, shallow dip in the granite - for all the world as if it was a naturally-occurring pensieve, only one the size of Dumbledore’s entire office.
had magic. What could the muggles do to him? Nothing. Still, he wished he had his wand.
Shacklebolt gave a melodious chuckle. Draco wondered what in-joke he was missing, and why Shacklebolt and Potter had one.
Draco was caught off guard. Potter was deliberately trying to not take advantage of the spell. It went so against how Draco himself would have acted that he wanted to cringe. His gratitude mingled with a hot rush of shame and he fought to stop it turning into desperate, defensive anger. All this time he’d been so sure that Potter was a dickhead, but here he was, proving himself to be a genuinely decent person over and over again.
“Master Draco is not knowing any better! Master is only doing as old Master Lucius is showing him…”
Potter gaped at him, then snapped his jaw shut and went back to glaring. Draco let his grin fall and glared back, enjoying the feeling of stepping back into this role, this brief return of how easy the superior mask used to be.
Shacklebolt looked at him levelly for a few long seconds, until Draco couldn’t help but blurt, “Of course, I am grateful to the Ministry for taking the necessary steps to secure the Manor, and I am happy to allow the Aurors full access to the premises to support them in so doing.”
Draco collapsed into the chair, dropped the crutches, and wrapped his arms across his chest. He thought if he just kept staring at the opposite wall, he could ignore how fucked up he was, and this tent was, and the world was.
“Yes, Master.” She sat up and, with a pop, apparated away.
“What the fuck?” said Potter.
Potter goggled at him. To his credit, it was only for one second, before he blinked, stuffed his hands in his pockets, sat down on Draco’s trunk, and clearly put effort into biting back several replies.
Potter’s face crumpled and Draco felt instantly guilty.
“So, Mr Malfoy, Poppy has informed me that you are a wizard.”
Draco gazed around, captivated by the beauty of it. So
Draco fought the urge to back away as the Auror and Potter rounded the pillar of his bed and approached him. He did not want their hands on him - he wouldn’t let them drag him away - if the elf magic failed him then he still had his crutches, the wood felt friendly beneath his hands -
Potter frowned.
He needed to cut himself, but he didn’t have a knife. He considered asking Prudy to fetch a kitchen knife, but he didn’t want her going anywhere alone before they knew that the rest of the Manor was empty. “Prudy,” he whispered to the elf at his feet. “Can your magic cut me?”
Draco nodded, swallowed, and followed the instructions. His cloak got in his way a little but soon he was at least turned fully towards the pavement.
“And - I don’t know why I’m even bothering asking you this - have you ever had Indian food?”
“What? Gods, Potter, you are such a - Gryffindor!”
pathetic muggle building was imposing?
Potter shrugged.
Potter came in, followed by Weasley. Weasley looked around with his eyebrows raised. “They gave this place a right going-over, didn’t they? Hey, this is old Perkins’ tent - I gave you another, Harry, why are you still using this one?”
Potter dropped his eyes and nodded. “I would have testified for her anyway.”
“I had the Dark Lord living in my house, Potter. You don’t think I’m glad he’s gone?”
He hopped to the centre of the stretch of wall, leant up closer against it and whispered, “Destiny.”
“I’ve got used to Pomfrey’s strict meal schedule, so yes, Potter, I’m hungry.”
“I meant to go to a corner shop to get some groceries but then I saw this Indian takeaway place on my way there, and I honestly couldn’t be bothered with cooking anyway…”
“So. Turns out I’m single now,” Potter said, in what was obviously intended to be a casual voice.
“Um, you know, she’s so busy with - with the arrangements… I’ll get it back for you, I promise.”
“Malfoy, are you all right? Oh shit, sorry, I know I shouldn’t ask - ”
- I don’t know if it would have counted as full murder. And anyway, I know you wouldn’t have done it. I saw you lower your wand.”
Potter shaking his arm got Draco to lurch into motion. He followed Potter towards the centre of the scrubby square. In between one crutch-swing and the next, a small tent appeared.
At least it was wizarding space. He wouldn’t have put it past Potter to have gone on the run from a genocidal dictatorship with only a muggle tent for shelter. It was a sub-par Undetectable Extension Charm, as the interior was still extraordinarily pokey - all three rooms added up to about half the size of his bedroom at the Manor. The whole place smelt strongly of cats, and he had never seen decor quite like it. He supposed this kind of fusty, mismatched tweeness would perhaps pass for style if one was poor enough, or a muggle, or perhaps both and also elderly.
Potter shrugged. “That’s what Ron named him, and it sort of stuck.”
Draco spent the rest of the day pottering (ha! Pottering) around the tent. He was at a bit at a loss, but on the other hand, it felt nice to have some space and time to himself with nothing to do. After his attack earlier, he didn’t feel capable of achieving much. He spent a while alphabetising the books that Potter had returned haphazardly to the shelf. He was slightly bemused by the range of topics Granger had seen fit to bring with her - everything from muggle survival guides, a complete set of crumbling potions references, Skeeter’s biography of Dumbledore, and, for some reason, a very old copy of
Hagrid.
Draco let out a slow, silent breath of relief through his nose. He never let his glare falter for an instant, even though Potter’s own eyes (always a brighter green than he remembered) were much more piercing from a distance of barely two feet away.
Potter smiled at him. Draco stared. It was definitely the first time Potter had looked at him like that - like he could almost be glad to see him.
had already poisoned him, at his request! He was already dying a year before that, from that curse that burnt his hand up. Look, Dumbledore arranged his own death, okay? He had it all planned out. Even if it had been you - if you’d cast the
Potter just smiled wider. Draco gritted his teeth against asking more questions. He wouldn’t give Potter the satisfaction of seeing his curiosity get the better of him.
Potter narrowed his eyes, not looking at all repentant.
“Obvious solution. Are you gonna give it back?”
Draco was momentarily stunned that they were talking openly about that. He had locked that secret down behind his Occlumency, lied and lied so desperately… but of course his father knew. He shook his head. “He has repaid it tonight. Twice over. I would have burned to death but he - he came back for me. And then he stunned a Death Eater who had me cornered.”
Prudy frowned. “But Master is needed at the Manor.”
Draco limped quickly to the table, held Prudy higher with one hand to protect his face, grabbed the mug and drained it, all in under three seconds. The liquid was still scorching hot and left his throat feeling even more scoured than before.
“No, Master!” Prudy covered her mouth with her hands and gazed at him with eyes full of horror. Draco kept his back straight, with difficulty.
me with your
he had lots of time, but he couldn’t stop himself glancing at his Malfoy pocket watch every twenty seconds. He was glad he had had such a plain breakfast: he felt nauseous with nerves.
Potter lifted his hand from his face and stared at him. “But - your leg…”
do things to rebuild your life. Which includes finding ways to do things you like to do, like beat me at Quidditch, even with a hole in your leg.”
The simple acts of showering and dressing himself took a long time, but even so, he knew he still had hours to kill before his afternoon appointment with this muggle healer.
Potter tugged him by the elbow towards the tent flap.
“Wow. Really?”
Draco felt a growing pain in his chest to add to his collection, but he knew this pain wasn’t caused by physical injuries.
“Stop
“Did I? Oh, God, my head… Malfoy, I can’t go, I’ll be sick all over Teddy - ”
Draco shut his mouth and drew one deep breath. There had to be fewer than five minutes left before the start of the ceremony. For a moment, he could see Pansy in front of him in the Slytherin common room, only minutes to go before their first class of the day, asking him to cast the spells for her because she was too lazy and hungover to do them herself. The wand movements suddenly felt easy and familiar under his hand.
“No, not really. All I’ve had is butterbeer and, like, a sip of firewhiskey one time.”
The old, familiar rage sprang to life in Potter’s face. Malfoy recognised it intimately, felt a moment of satisfaction at having elicited it, and then remembered his vision and felt sick with himself.
They emerged into the midday May sunshine. Potter whirled and settled the cloak over Draco in one smooth motion, then immediately grabbed for Draco’s arm before he could move out of range and thus give Potter the slip. Potter tugged him forwards a few more steps, through the wards.
“My name is being Frona,” she croaked.
Draco laughed. “That explains a lot, honestly. I’ve never seen a person more motivated to get good grades than Granger, but apparently she just had different priorities than the rest of us.”
. Draco snorted. That rota would now be worth a fortune - anything here would.
The entrance was an imposing marble portico, flanked with pillars and black railings and approached by three broad steps up. Draco awkwardly hopped up them on his crutches. He paused before the huge, shiny black door, his heart beating madly. At least the man in the taxi had been friendly. This place was designed to be intimidating.
He returned to the common room by way of the bathroom, picking up his old clothes with a grimace and throwing them without ceremony on the common room fire. The flames were nearly smothered but recovered gamely, and Draco watched, pleased, as his clothes were slowly destroyed.
Potter nodded.
Potter bristled. The sight of an annoyed Potter was amazingly therapeutic. Draco drank it in.
He focused on the blank parchment and the feel of the feather in his hands. He found himself stroking it gently, over and over, and let his mind calm down.
“… and then she took off running to the professor, all snotty and crying, but - you!” Myrtle span around and flew right up to Potter, jabbing an icy finger into his chest. “You should have been expelled! Why are you here? You
“No, wait, Malfoy… it’s only your leg, right? Surely there are modified broomsticks to help with the balance?”
move. “Do you know what, Malfoy, that hadn’t even occurred to me. Or maybe I came by earlier and set up a Notice-Me-Not Charm under this tree.”
The paint was flaking from the door in large curls, but the serpent door-knocker still managed to look imposing. There was no handle to turn. This house was only intended for wizards, after all.
“Okay, Master Draco!”
He dozed, then woke up fully as the lake beyond the windows went from inky black to a light grey. He felt significantly better now that he had eaten and slept and knew with certainty that no-one could take him away to Azkaban. His head still ached, though, and his leg cramped just from the act of sitting up on the sofa; apparently it was stiff after lying still for so long.
He turned the handle, pushed open the door and did his best to stride in confidently, if striding was possible using only one leg.

“It’s all fucking true, isn’t it?”
“Why not at home?”
“Wood-elves, wait… So was that
Potter looked stricken. The pity still hadn’t left his eyes. Draco hated it, hated
Hands were tugging gently at Draco’s arms. He cringed away; at this moment he couldn’t even handle breathing, and now Potter wanted him to cope with more sensations? With interaction? With
I don’t care about my - ”
“A Malfoy and a muggle talked to each other? And the world didn’t implode?”
He felt much shakier now that he had admitted it out loud. It was so horribly weak to be ruled by his fear like this. And to have to tell someone on top of that, and for it to be Potter, of all people, who had faced the Dark Lord not five days ago…
It was difficult, though, to force himself to press hard enough into his skin with the metal. It took him a few moments longer than it had for his father, and when he managed it, he couldn’t suppress a small hiss of pain. He felt the blood start to pool, wet and hot, along his hand and down onto the floor.
He jerked his gaze down towards his body as movement caught his eye. Standing with her hands hovering, palms downwards, above his bare chest, was the oldest house-elf that Draco had ever seen.
Draco smirked. Playing Potter was just too easy.
Draco glowered, but gave Potter a reluctant nod.
now, hasn’t it? Our Lord is gone and I suppose you’re
Madam Pomfrey. Draco reluctantly stopped groping under the bed for the slats below the bed-frame and lay down again - his body
“Oh.” For a moment, his throat felt choked up and his eyes burned. Then the spell kicked in and his annoyance managed to chase away the threat of tears. “And now I have to tell you that I’m
“Is he - did he die, Winky?”
“Oh, so you remember that? Potter, you should have got there three minutes ago - ”
“I would rather stay here. I - ” Damn. “I don’t think I’d feel safe at a hotel. It wouldn’t exactly have the best security against vengeful Death Eaters when they learn that I’ve sold them out. Anyway, a wizarding hotel would probably refuse to have me, and I wouldn’t feel comfortable at a muggle one. Also…” Double damn. Deep breath. “I would get - lonely. You’re pretty much the only person who’s willing to talk to me at the moment.”
“One… two… three!”
“Okay. You can sit down again, Mr Malfoy. I won’t make you do that again, don’t worry.”
Potter huffed, but appeared somewhat appeased. “I won’t even be there. I’ll be staying at Hogwarts at the moment, to help with the rebuilding.”
Draco shuddered. ‘Clever techniques’ probably meant dosing someone with alcohol and then knocking them out with a firm uppercut to the jaw. The idea of letting a muggle get close to him made his breath start to come short. He almost said, ‘My father will hear about this,’ but bit that back and substituted with a weak, “I am not at all pleased with this.”
Draco grinned at her. “You are such a bitch, Myrtle.”
He had genuinely gone into the forest to let himself be killed? How the hell had he survived that?
Lovegood said something to Potter, then she was turning and pointing.
This wasn’t the direction Draco thought this conversation was going to go.
He had to get dressed from a sitting position on his bed, which was tricky. His left sock proved particularly difficult, as he couldn’t push his foot down into it without his leg protesting. But as each element of his school uniform went on, he felt more like himself, more collected and capable. He wished for his wand
, he had to get out of here! With an effort of will, he restricted his movements to his eyes, which darted everywhere. His gaze caught on the pearly, nearly-invisible sheen of a ghost floating above his bed, up near the ceiling, and his breath froze in his chest.
He let his lip curl back in a sneer.
“Ugh, that is always so horrible,” Potter said through gritted teeth.
“Are you
Potter’s eyes flashed, and he looked angry for the first time. “

He lowered his hands. “I’m - I’m
“Well.”
Draco just looked at him, then over to Potter.
Draco nodded.
Draco heaved an involuntary sigh of relief, his eyes fluttering shut as he allowed himself to sink back onto the bed. It wasn’t him, it wasn’t Peeves, they were not about to die. He tried to will away the sick waves of adrenaline as they curdled in his bloodstream.
He lifted his head off his knees and looked towards the door of the cell. He felt drained as always after an attack, and wanted nothing more than to curl up in a corner and attempt to feel somewhat normal again. But he had to find Potter. The world didn’t give a damn about him feeling ready or not.
Potter’s eyes widened, aghast. “No? Surely not?”
“Potter, I wish I could tell you you are an uncivilised barbarian, but unfortunately, the Path spell won’t allow it. I thought you said you’d had firewhiskey before? You don’t just down it!”
Potter glared some more.
you.”
No-one cast a spell, but the opening words of the ceremony were enough. Starting from the innermost circle, golden beams of light shot upwards, hitting an invisible dome. The dome reminded Draco of the Hogwarts wards, and it perfectly mirrored the shape of the Hollow below. As more and more beams of light poured into it, the blue of the sky faded away until they were encased inside a dome of magic. The grass and the people and the granite changed colour as they were bathed in gold.
Potter stood up and collected their empty mugs, casting a lazy cleaning charm over them and putting them back in the cabinet. “Anyway. I should be getting back to help Bill. I’ll come back later and fix this place up a bit more, I know it’s a dump. Are you sure you wouldn’t prefer a hotel?”
He closed his eyes and held tighter to the crutches, letting the smooth touch soothe him. He let a little of the old magic out through his hands, sensing the essence of the wood. He could outline the shape of the crutches without looking down. The wood was long dead, but Draco knew that if he asked, it would come alive again for him, grow for him, defend him. It was good to know that he had some way of protecting himself; he had already fought off both his uncle and Peeves, hadn’t he? And
“What are you doing, Peeves?” Potter’s voice was low and horrified.
Before even saying a word, Potter handed over a sturdy, dry twig. It was about the length of a forearm and felt almost like a wand in Draco’s grip. The Old Magic hummed happily in his belly at the touch.
He reached behind him and grabbed Prudy, lifted her to his chest and croaked, “Stop or she dies.”
Potter’s eyebrows went up.
They both stared at each other. After a moment, Potter took a deep breath. “Do you get what I’m trying to say?”
“Malfoy,” said McGonagall. He saw her eyes flick to the bandage on his arm, but she made no comment. “I am very glad to see you looking better.” Her voice sounded slightly rougher than usual. Draco was astonished to see that she genuinely meant it. “I cannot even begin to sufficiently apologise for what Peeves did to you. I’ve never heard of him attacking anyone like that.”
, Potter. She took such a stupid, such an
Draco looked down at Potter’s wand; his grip tightened around it reflexively for a moment. Then he took one more deep breath and handed it back.
him?” Draco couldn’t help the slight tinge of hysteria in his voice. He remembered the crunch of the boulder against his chest, his body’s instinctive understanding that he was close to death. In the whole war, the only other time he’d suffered injuries of that severity had been Potter’s
She reached out hesitantly and drew a hand above the line of buttons on Draco’s shirt. They neatly undid themselves and his shirt folded back from his chest. She made short work of his bruises, laying her cool fingers on each in turn until they faded to nothing.
“Right, I’ve got to go right now - it must be half past already…”
Doctor Liston’s eyes sparkled. “It does make it a tad obvious, Mr Malfoy, but only to those in the know.”
Potter glowered even harder. Draco grinned wider.
Potter’s mouth twisted in disdain but he backed up a step, indicating to the others to do the same. Draco was not surprised to see the two Aurors obeying Potter instinctively.
Shacklebolt stood up. “Harry, I will go and brief Robards and the Senior Aurors with this new information. I’ll call you when we begin to discuss plans, if you like?”
His anger abruptly collapsed into anxiety. This woman may be a muggle, but she was also a healer. Healers
“Harry - ideally yes, of course; but this is a rare opportunity to gain the full cooperation of a Death Eater. Lord Malfoy’s help could prove invaluable.”
“Oh, yes, and I’m sure you always showed her
There’ll be no more killing, understand? Now go. I’ll deal with you later.”
“Who?”
Draco’s chest clenched in pain. He knew exactly what must have happened - his fucking aunt. That knife of hers had disappeared into the swirl of apparition and at the time Draco had been worried it had hit Potter. But no, aunt Bella never missed her aim, and apparently in that moment she had wanted to punish Dobby for his treachery more than she had even wanted to please her Dark Lord.
“The Path of the Penitent. Like I said, it’s ancient magic. Strong stuff. I have to atone to each of the people I’ve wronged, by doing a task they set for me. You said ‘Explain yourself,’ and apparently that means that I - I can’t lie to you.”
Potter couldn’t do anything to him.
“Merlin, Harry, I don’t care about that. I’m just not sure why you’d prefer wandering around some godforsaken forest all morning looking for this old thing, all for the benefit of a pasty Death Eater, mind you, instead of popping over to the Burrow and asking your friends for help.”
Potter started. “Er, not that I know of. Why?”
Potter was standing by his bed, flanked by the same two Aurors who had been in Malfoy Manor. Both the Aurors had their wands out and pointed at him. The female one looked particularly stern.
Draco blinked. The scratchy handwriting was unrefined, but perfectly legible. Still, Draco doubted that he read that third sentence correctly. Why would Potter tell him what the questions were going to be about? He felt pretty sure that a fundamental principle of interrogation was to
Potter didn’t move. He seemed to have stopped breathing.
“I’ll do it. Stay at Grimmauld Place, I mean.”
It was glorious to let himself melt into this comfort. He choked on a breathless laugh. He had forgotten that comfort was even possible. He couldn’t stop himself from falling apart just a little bit, held up as he was by the soft mattress and protected by the achingly familiar curtains, the posts like sentinels rising from each corner.
“Hey - that’s
He could not stop himself from staring at the place where the Dark Lord had fallen. He was gone. They were safe. Both his parents were here, right here, still alive.
, Potter?” It was the less-surprising thing to focus on.
Potter stared at him. “Of course! I would never…”
Potter sat with his head bowed for several moments, before heaving himself upright. He started walking towards the door, moving as if his feet suddenly weighed more than usual. Draco could just let him go, he didn’t
“Seriously. But I didn’t expect to be alive right now - even before I knew I had to die, I mean - so I suppose we might have to broaden our view a bit on what’s possible.”
, was right.
tell you the truth at the moment. Anyway. Why the stick?”
He looked over at where Potter was sitting. The Malfoys were probably the only people in the hall who hadn’t tried to approach him since the battle ended. He looked as exhausted as Draco felt, his eyes still bloodshot from the smoke of the Fiendfyre. How couldn’t the others have noticed that he just wanted to be left alone?
Potter sighed. “Do you mind if we don’t go into all that right now? I don’t really like thinking about it.”
He looked around the tent carefully twice before concluding there was nothing else he needed to take, and then ducked out under the tent-flap. He blinked in the strong sunlight and adjusted his grip nervously on his crutches, looking around the whole square for any sign of muggles. No-one was walking around, or looking out of the windows, as far as Draco could see. Despite that, he could feel his breath suddenly coming faster, and his heart had already been pounding, and despite not having any lunch, he was beginning to feel sick…
Potter looked over at Shacklebolt for a moment before mumbling, “Thanks, Professor, I’ll think about it.”
He told himself to stop wallowing in self-pity. For Gods’ sake - if it hadn’t been for the old magic, he would have been in a far worse state than this. He had never known the woodcraft could be so powerful. Or so vicious.
Draco had a sudden memory of Wormtail’s silver hand. He balked at the idea of deliberately cutting his leg off, but that hand had worked perfectly for Wormtail - until it had strangled him. It was still worth looking into; he needed to speak to his father, he might know how the silver hand was created. Surely he would be permitted to correspond with his father in Azkaban, even if he couldn’t visit?
Draco tentatively shifted up onto his elbows. The ache was gone now that the old magic had settled. He could still feel it inside him, like a second layer of skin; strange, but not uncomfortable.
before?”
He had to get to Hagrid.
Draco recoiled slightly. “What? Potter, you can’t be serious - they’d tear me limb from limb.” And that wasn’t even sarcasm.
“Wait! Sorry, um - would you be able to come back here at, er, about 4pm?”
Draco sighed. “I knew I shouldn’t have worn my cloak.”
“It is a list of the fallen,” his mother said softly.
“It really was, wasn’t it? Why did we never have that kind of food at Hogwarts?”
“I see. Do you have any ideas of who else, apart from Harry here, will be on the list?”
Potter had taken the box back and was tipping it over his plate so as to better scrape a portion of the sloppy orange foodstuff over his rice, splashing a bit on the table. Draco goggled for a moment at such a blatant lack of table manners, and then, feeling rather daring, emulated him.
“Thank Merlin,” Draco said, draining it. The water helped, but not enough - the heat still prickled his tongue.
Her ears drooped; her tone of voice was resigned, almost wise. Draco wondered how he could possibly ever have inspired her loyalty. Why had she wanted to come back to him, even when she could have stayed free?
“Right, so when your muscle is getting overloaded, the spasming is caused by the triggering mechanism for the contracting and relaxing going haywire. The bundle of fibres isn’t acting in concert any more; different strands of muscle cells are firing all at different times.”
“Damn it, Malfoy, don’t bring all that up again. No-one thought I was actually going to manage it, you know, so you were only being rational.”
“You would have me tell them everything? Even… your involvement?”
A part of Draco almost wanted to laugh, but he knew he would sound hysterical. He pressed his lips together and hid his face in the relative safety of his arms. No-one had ever seen him have an attack before. He had always managed to hold it together until he reached privacy. He willed himself to get a grip, but it was far too late. He just couldn’t do it. The pressure in his chest was crushing and a pins-and-needles numbness was spreading across his scalp and down his arms.
“Which one - ?”
Draco’s eyes widened in alarm as Prudy edged closer to out-and-out sobbing.
“Okay. And, um, I’ll arrange for some food to be brought to you.”
Draco took his mouthful at the same time as Potter. The flavour was unfamiliar but delicious. He swallowed.
“Well. If you’re desperate enough to say please to me, Potter, I can’t really say no, can I?”
Draco blanched. It was probably the first time in the school’s history that Peeves sounded completely serious.
The grin left Potter’s face. “Yeah. I did.”
fail me.”
come, Malfoy! My cloak! The invibli-invisilibity cloak! No-one’ll see you. You’ll come? Please?”
“She didn’t need to. I’ve been in here before.”
They drank the rest of their tea in silence. Draco didn’t feel cold any more, but he was reeling. He had recognised early in sixth year, of course, that his mother had been right: the Dark Lord had meant for him to die in attempting his task, as a punishment against his father. He knew how much of a fool he’d been for ever thinking it was anything else. He’d never considered that Dumbledore had been using him as well.
He allowed himself to let go of his legs and uncoil. The movement brought back all his previous aches and pains, especially in his leg and the back of his head.
“Huh. Saving the world really put a crimp in your being a teenager, didn’t it? Or was that being friends with Granger?”
The wood immediately became insubstantial, like swirling smoke somehow taking the shape and colour of a door. Draco awkwardly hopped forward, keeping his left arm raised, followed closely by the Weasley and Potter nearly tripping on his heels.
running into the kitchen, wands drawn.
Draco felt something quite like smugness. Perhaps he would try surprising people like this again sometime. “Does the Black house have a potions lab, Potter?”
“It was part of the ritual for invoking the Path of the Penitent.”
Right. Now to get up and go out there again… as soon as he could gather his strength…
have to explain that? Really? Because the spell will make me, you know.”
“What? Oh. It’s Wednesday, dear.”
The warmth flared into a burning fire as he felt Potter’s arms jostle him. He whimpered.
“Ah - no - but I haven’t asked yet.” The leaves rustled around him, and he almost felt like laughing at its obvious impatience. “Please, er, sir - could I have a piece of your bark?”
“Okay, whenever you’re ready. Just let the leg take enough weight to trigger the cramps.”
Madam Pomfrey’s stern manner cracked slightly. “Mr Malfoy, I can assure you that you are safe here. The Bloody Baron is not going to leave your side. But of course, I do not blame you for feeling jumpy. I have been a matron for a long time, and I thought that after seeing a literal battle take place within the school walls that nothing could shock me any more - but for that poltergeist to have - to have actually
Prudy instantly stopped crying and beamed. “Now that Master Malfoy is the head of the family, Prudy will be very happy to serve him!”
Myrtle settled again near the foot of the bed, bobbing upwards slightly as she gave a theatrical sniff. “You haven’t been to see me for
She nodded, looking relieved.
“Your truth-bombs are really… well. Really something, Malfoy.”
“I must protect the castle, Draco.”
is, if
have to leave now. Except that was utterly pointless - what would he do, go on the run? He had to be at the Manor every new moon, and even if, with Prudy’s help, he managed to stealthily apparate in and out for a few months, eventually some Auror would work out the pattern of the break-ins and set up a very simple ambush. It was only delaying the inevitable.
Potter huffed a soft laugh. “Would it be better if it was black?”
“Kreacher?” asked Madam Pomfrey.
Her nose wrinkled slightly, but she nodded. “I doubt any student has had a chance to focus on academics this year, particularly those who were - directly involved.” Her gaze moved to include Potter. “All the seventh years are welcome to return for another year, so that you can properly finish your education.”
“So. Right, first step is to make ourselves comfortable. I recommend we get the blankets off the bunk-beds and make nests over by that poor excuse of a fireplace. One doesn’t want to have to move anywhere once one is halfway through a firewhiskey bottle, and it’s best to pass out in a place that you wouldn’t mind sleeping in.”
Three weeks. By then, he had to somehow have sorted all this out, and be back at home. At least it wasn’t
“What day is it today?”
get us some other stuff…”
Severus was dead. He had not been on their side. He had been a spy for the Order from Draco’s babyhood, in love with Potter’s mother, in love with a
No house-elves. Frona had made it clear that her goodwill extended as far as telling him about the Path of the Penitent, but no further. And Prudy - with any luck, Prudy was receiving proper medical care right now. Draco’s chest clenched at the memory of how light and limp she had felt in his hands.
He reached down and pushed aside the charred, tattered remains of his trouser leg. A chunk of muscle from the back of his calf was missing, a smooth bite-shaped crater, and the skin over it had become the shiny twisted tightness of a healed burn. Draco stared, and remembered. In the Fiendfyre, a griffin of flames had snapped its beak at him as he dragged Goyle up that tower of desks - he had felt heat at the time as he had snatched his leg up higher, but thought nothing further of it - through the rest of the battle he supposed that adrenaline must have kept him going. How could he not have noticed it? But since sitting down on the bench in the hall after the battle, he hadn’t tried to move anywhere, and perhaps the burn had been bad enough to kill all the nerve endings…
Well, best get to the hospital wing as quick as he could, and with luck he’d be back in time for Potter and he’d never need to know Draco had gone. It was unlikely to work out like that, but he needed to do this for Prudy. And for Dobby.
“No - wait - Malfoy isn’t… Malfoy would already help you! You don’t need to force him into it!”
Potter nodded, fresh tears making their way silently down his face. Then his eyes lifted back to Draco’s face in sudden hope.
He rubbed his eyes, then rolled over and felt under the bed for his pocket watch. Some bleary squinting later, he determined that it was quarter past eleven.
Potter started fidgeting. Draco waited, letting the silence stretch on until…
“Ah yes, I see, Mr MacFoy, for 3pm?”
The tree rustled contentedly, then lifted all its branches up again, allowing Draco to leave. He struggled to his feet and started the painful journey back to the main part of the house.
“Dobby!” She wailed, and flung herself forward across Draco’s chest, clutching at his hospital gown. He kept rubbing her back helplessly as her entire frame shook with almost-soundless sobs.
“Hmm. You are truly a child of war, then. And is this your first time out and about in our world?”
“Okay. I think, then, I’m going to need to see that happening.”
“Oh. Right. I should have thought of that. But look, okay, in my defence,
His breath hitched. He wrapped his arms round his chest, feeling cold, and was not altogether surprised to find he was shaking. He held tight as his breath sped up and his heart raced and the walls of his cell closed in, and he waited as patiently as he could through the endless minutes of terror until he didn’t feel so certain that he was about to die.
, and
“And you have already received a command from Harry to, what was it, ‘explain yourself’? Which has resulted in you being unable to lie to Harry?”
Draco frowned. He didn’t know that one.
Madam Pomfrey nodded. “And how bad is the pain, when your leg cramps?”
“Listen, Malfoy, what do I do about this life-debt I owe your mother?” He smirked slightly. “I don’t know the proper traditions, you know.”
warily. He had never read it, but he hadn’t been able to avoid the other Slytherin students quoting the most salacious parts of it all year. Gingerly, he took the book off the shelf and looked down at the cover. At least the eyes twinkling up at him weren’t empty and sunken like the dust-Dumbledore’s had been. He took a shaky breath.
Potter seemed to remember himself and the smile faded.
“Narcissa, my love - perhaps you could use your life-debt on behalf of Draco?”
“Not Dark Magic, Potter. Elf magic.”
After a few, endless minutes, Prudy’s sobs began to subside. Draco brought his right hand up to wipe away a couple of stray tears from his own face and he wasn’t surprised to see Potter do the same. Finally, Prudy stopped crying, but didn’t uncurl from her position as a tight ball of limbs on Draco’s chest.
“It was - rushed. But I am of-age.” He forced himself to meet Shacklebolt’s eyes with proper Malfoy imperiousness. It felt a little forced from his prone position in a hospital bed.
