Lucius fell on his face when the trunk collided with Hermione’s legs, a horse standing tall and strong, was no match for a scrawny man regardless of how badly he wanted to move. Deciding to leave the trunk for the moment, Lucius set his evil sights on Potter, the black cat who had started this plan-spoiling drama. The man picked up a scythe and started waving it around crazily, trying to attack the cat, but Potter had jumped back onto the loft. As Lucius chased after him, climbing the ladder one-handed, Potter started to push against the ladder, hoping to make it fall. Harry nearly took a scythe to the face for his trouble, but as the ladder started to fall backwards, Lucius dropped it, saving poor Harry’s handsome face as they both fell with the ladder. Lucius cackled madly as they fell, not really sure what else to do. They managed to land on a pile of hay, so neither were grievously injured in the fall.
Soon though, both Sirius and Lucius were faced with another problem – Remus and his speeding sidecar were heading straight for them! Remus managed to lean over just enough that they didn’t collide, however he still wanted in on the action. So as he passed the two, Remus grabbed the man’s suspenders with his teeth and let the momentum and the elasticity of the fabric pull him over to the motorcycle. His sidecar managed to come with him and he collided into the back of the motorcycle, causing it to speed up. Remus was still trailing behind the motorbike when they all approached a windmill and he saw the blond man stand up on the handlebars again. Upon seeing the windmill, Lucius had decided it was his best chance of escape, so he jumped onto one of the blades as it spun near the ground, hoping to get those dogs off his tail once and for all.
Luna Lovegood arrived in a rickety car that seemed to constantly backfire as she drove, making it easy to tell when she was approaching. Her nargle inspired hat had become skewed due to the jerkiness of the car so she straightened it before getting out. She sang loudly as she exited her car, not caring if she was on tune or not, nor caring if she drew the attention of others. She had always been eccentric, but she was good at her job and that is why her clients loved her. Luna nearly tripped over the curb, too busy checking for wrackspurts in the general vicinity to pay attention to the lay of the land.
Draco shot Harry a look of frustration at his tone but the geese didn’t seem to mind at all. Instead they broke into giggles once more and yelled “Oh! Oh, flatterer!”
Lucius jumped out of the haystack, trying to run away from the teeth on his legs and bottom, but he was grabbed back down before he got out. Remus and Sirius bit every inch of skin they could reach within the hay, ferocious in their anger.
“Yes everybody wants to be a cat. Because a cat’s the only cat, who knows where it’s at. When playin’ jazz you always has a welcome mat, cuz everybody digs a swingin’ cat,” Harry and Scorpius sang together, dancing around the piano. Albus decided to take the words of the song to heart and swung on the cord of the lamp as they sang. He turned on the light as he did so and suddenly the room was full of all sorts of colors!
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “Oh, now you want to get naked, huh? I see how it is,” Harry teased with a sexy smirk.
“Sorry love, nature called. But good morning handsome.” Harry greeted Draco as he climbed back into bed.
“Good night, Draco,” Harry called as his love jumped off the chimney and headed back to his kittens.
Draco’s eyes widened in surprise and excitement at Harry’s words and he grabbed his husband’s hand, running after him through the Ministry. Harry technically had an office…he only used it while he was in the middle of a massive undercover operation. Otherwise he preferred to stay in the same area as his coworkers. But it meant that Harry’s office was always available for time alone…and it was guaranteed to be empty as only Harry had the key. Draco realized where they were heading and picked up his pace, somehow more excited than ever.
Harry was dancing side to side with a flourish now, moving closer to Draco and then moving away. Albus had gotten too into his dancing for Scorpius’s liking as the ginger kitten ran into his sibling. Scorpius elbowed Albus away and glared at him briefly, before returning his attention to Harry. Harry stopped right next to Draco’s face, loving the way  the white cat was smiling as he finished the last few lines of his song.
Unless I find a way home myself? I'm Harry Potter, I've done worse, even though I have no idea where to look, "Wait. What does Hermione do?"
Harry and the Twins were not even comparable to them. Harry was kind and understanding, telling me the truth at all times. The Twins found new ways to make me laugh, and made me feel like their little brother at times. Sure Ron hated me, but even Mrs. Wealsey seemed to find me decent enough. Her husband was the same as Ron, but that was no surprise given that him and my father were always at odds. I felt grateful that Harry saw my heightened arrogance for what it was during our 4th year. Fear and pain. He had found me crying in the Moaning Mrtyle bathroom after You-Know-Who was finally resurrected. He listened and even understood.
I chuckled in embarrassment and turned my head away, "Merlin I can't believe I said that. How distasteful, huh?"
When I looked up the sight left me breathless. Harry had fallen asleep, which was extremely cute, and Riddle had taken to staring at me. While it was rude, and maybe a little creepy if I looked more into it, I couldn't help but feel attraction. It was a confusing mess, being attracted to two boys who hated each other. Perhaps they were too different, or too similar. Yes, similar. That was the most likely of the two. Both were passionate and were very powerful. I could clearly see that even in their personalities they had similar traits, even though they acted completely different at times. Which was true, they were very different. Harry was kind and hardheaded even in his best moments. Riddle was cunning and always seemed to think with a clear head, unless Harry provoked him it seemed.
Before I knew it Draco was rushing me out, apparently having just finished. He gave me my paperwork and I smiled, at least he was nice about the names. For himself he went with Drake Pond, and for me he gave me Hadrian. My last name was Albott? I looked at him in question, but when he refused to look at me I was forced to keep quiet until we were out of sight. Turns out that over the next few months he refused to answer any questions regarding the last name. We ended up moving into an Inn and got several jobs to pay for rent. A few weeks before the Hogwarts term started we got our letters.
. Although how did I know about the door? Was it even real? Looking back it was the only part of the dream that seemed real. I’m sure it didn’t exist, but I decided to look tomorrow anyway just to be sure. I couldn’t have that room be real and not use it.
Harry rolled his eyes in annoyance, "Hard to be upset when your parents are horrible people." I knew in that moment he was thinking of his Aunt and Uncle, not of his real parents. I was sad to think his statement was all too true. At least for me, would I truly be upset of my parents died? My mother, yes, but my father? I wasn't too sure.
Draco flushed, "I just don't think you could pull off blonde hair." I laughed as he look away in embarrassment. After a few minutes of planning we got to work. Draco did most of the work, since he was better at transfiguration then I was. He lengthened his hair till it reached past him ears and darkened the color to a dirty blonde. Ultimately we decided to lighten up my hair and give it a hue of light browns throughout, while doing the same to his only instead giving it a reddish tint. When we were finished Draco had strawberry dirty blonde hair and I had very dark dirty blonde hair, and he changed his eyes to a light brown. With the added freckles to Draco's face we finished. At first I was worried about our underage age magic being detected until Draco told me of the magical wards protecting this Department. We couldn't do magic outside of here, but inside we could.
Ender's fight for survival and his stubborn determination was something I could relate to. His cold exterior never stopped him from making connections, and that gave me hope. He was trained to hate and fight, and yet he chose his own path as best he could. He did what was not only best for him, but best for his sister. He thought beyond himself, despite how hopeless his own situation was. It was how I based my own life. My loyalty and my devotion was my own to control and hand out. It truly was an inspired work of fiction.
It was a shame the wizarding world didn't place much value in muggles. Their literature and their inventions were truly splendid. Once I actually took a look, Mr. Weasley's obsession with the muggles was understandable. If more wizards and witches took a longer look Mr. Weasley's obsession would become an epidemic. If only they would open their eyes and see the truth. Alas, that would never happen.
Sorry, it's so short! Although I figure that this little cliffhanger of mine will be even worse than the chapter being short.
Draco didn't look amused, "Deal with it Potter," I knew he was serious at the sound of my last name, "We will go through any obstacle to get home, that means we show up early. What I'm more worried about is paying for all of our supplies. I've been sazing money but I'm not sure if it'll be enough."
Draco smoothly stepped in to save my ass, "I'm Drake Pond, this is Hadrian Albott. Pleased to meet you, Riddle. Now we uh- we have to leave now." Riddle chuckled again as a flustered Draco dragged me off. We both seem to do that a lot.
Draco looked more and more defeated as he listened, “I know. There’s nothing for me back home. But what other choice do I have? Stay here, fall in love, never have to worry about pureblood stigma, become a healer, and get married, and maybe even have kids? Stay here and have everything I could have ever wanted? If it all falls apart I can’t pick myself back up. I can’t take any more disappointment, Harry. I’m scared.” I put my hand on his and gave him a reassuring smile.
That thought made him angry, he wanted to breed Draco and even if it was impossible he was going to give a good damn try.
This though aroused him even more and he broke in a chorus of pleading sounds for his alpha to knot him.
Maybe it was because Harry barely said anything intelligible since the day before, but that single word hit Draco strong, he was laying on a floor, Merlin-know where, with Harry fucking Potter jacking his cock and breeding him nice and slow for the second time that day. Maybe that spell actually killed him.
Draco’s eyes rolled back in his head as he orgasmed, the sensation of the bond forming burning deep inside his body as Harry semen filled him.
Slowly Draco started to breath again, his hand reaching for Harry, the alpha grabbed his fingers pinning him on the blanket.
Hary must have slipped out of him in the sleep after the knot deflated but now his hard cock was pressed again in the crack of his butt.
Draco holds on for dear life, his only handhold being the alpha himself, but his lover is going too fast for him. His orgasm is ripped from his body, splashing into the water and leaving him limp- numbly enjoying the sensation of Harry driving into him over and over again.
With this resolve he took out his fingers hooking them around Draco’s hips, he aligned his hard dick, slowly pressing the head inside.
“About a minute.” Granger left a brush on the bed an all of them crowding around it. Harry gently raise his hand to touch it and simply like that they were gone.
The after was now and he suddenly wished he wasn’t tied to Harry so he could scout away. As he could read minds. The alpha hugged him tightly.
Probably unconsciously Harry was growling against his earlobe. The way the alpha was completely lost to his need made him wet and horny, and eager to be breed.
He took out the fingers grabbing the white legs around him so strong he probably left signs, at least his alpha hoped so.
He couldn’t lift his eyes or he was going to faint. Harry hot breath came closer, the hold around him tightening. Maybe he would faint anyway.
“Sleepy.” He said stretching his neck a little to have a kiss. Harry ruffled his hair before going to the bathroom to clean a bit.
When he woke up Harry wasn’t there and he wasn’t in the same bed anymore, he struggled a little but a nice nurse told him he was at the hospital. He had a bad fever due to the stress and his organism was rejecting the suppressants. They took him into a special chamber and it was obvious why right away.
In the background, his rational self remind him that it was Draco’s first heat since the suppressant, it was impossible for him to get pregnant, his body was still getting ride of the chemicals.
Still, his alpha needed to mark the blond. That’s why Harry was now sitting his back against the couch’s sit kissing his mate deeply as he was moving inside him.
“Let me spell this aloud for you, I enjoyed every second of your assault. I’m scared you did it on a whim, because of instinct.”
Draco rolled waiting for Harry to come back, he must have dozed off a little because he woke up again at the bed dropping. He opened his arms welcoming back Harry which kissed his clavicle and then his sternum until he was the same level to his stomach. He gave it another kiss and then pressed his ear on it.
That I’m,” Harry gracefully jumped to the tree behind the white cat, which was full of beautiful blossoms, just asking to be rained down upon such a beautiful creature. He slid down a long and sturdy branch and used his front paws to wiggle it, sending petals floating down onto the cat below.
“A muggle with a horn, makes you wish you weren’t born, every time he plays.” The duet continued as they followed the frame back the other way.
Harry managed to get another page or two of paperwork done before his phone buzzed loudly again. He hadn’t tried to put it away this time, merely tossing it to the corner of his desk. He finished the page he was on before sighing as he opened Draco’s message.
“Okay, let’s charge. Ooof!” Remus fell on his chin as Sirius grabbed his tail to prevent the smaller dog from running ahead.
Albus was having a bit of a time actually getting his paints to go where he needed them. He caught the splurt of pink paint before it fell to the ground, but the teal was a different story. It fell to the floor and nearly landed on top of James who swiftly moved farther from the easel. Once he had a nice purple mixed together, Albus jumped onto his chair, paw dripping with paint and ready to create. As he painted, he rubbed his chin and got green paint on his fur at one point, thinking more about what to paint than where the paint was going. He finished his painting rather quickly and stood back to admire his work. As he did so, Albus heard laughter from his siblings.
Lucius threw on his coat and ran to the door, opening it with a bow for Narcissa. She walked out the door, calling for her babies. “Draco? Kittens? Come here, my darlings. Where are you? Come on.” Narcissa called anxiously, opening her arms wide.
Harry gasped, trying to get more water out of his lungs. “Help? I’ve had all the help I can take.” Harry grumbled.
“Well come along Lucius. Last one up the stairs is a blast-ended skrewt!” Luna practically cackled as she started to run up the mountain of marble in front of her.
Harry settled in to watch Draco groom his face fur, making it stick out handsomely in just the right way. He stopped that verse and just smiled down at the white cat. Harry rested his head on his paws as he got comfortable. Unbeknownst to Draco or Harry, the kittens had woken up and were eagerly watching from their basket bed.
Both men slept soundly through the night until rather late the next morning thanks to the blackout curtains. Harry was the first to stir, his bladder forcing him awake whether he wanted to or not. Holding back a grumble, Harry gently untangled his limbs from Draco’s so that he could head to the bathroom. Draco stirred slightly, annoyed at the loss of Harry’s warmth but he didn’t wake up immediately. Eventually, Draco woke up when he subconsciously reached out for Harry and didn’t find him. Draco’s grey eyes flashed open looking around for the dark-haired man. Harry had just returned from the bathroom and upon seeing Draco awake he smiled brightly.
Hermione whinnied indignantly at the slap, rearing her front legs in annoyance. Poor Ron was sent flying into a sack of feed but thankfully didn’t land on the hard stone floor. Lucius was laughing so hard that he didn’t see Ron go flying. Lucius’s laughter had made it impossible for him to stand so he ended up leaning on a post in the barn to stop himself from face planting. When he managed to catch his breath he stood up and continued his bragging.
“Yes Papa.” Albus replied before hissing and shaking his way over to the easel, still in alley cat mode.
Lucius allowed Albus to play with the ribbon, but when Albus climbed on top of his hat, Lucius removed the kitten and set him down safely within the carriage.
“Quite. We must correct him.” The two brothers got into the water and floated over to the black cat.
Draco sighed at the sadness in his son’s voice but spoke kindly to Harry regardless. “I understand perfectly, Monsieur Potter. Well, come along, darlings.”
Lucius shut the door behind him and shook his head sadly as well before he replied, “I’m so sorry, Madame.” Narcissa didn’t see the giant smile on his face as she had turned away from him to head upstairs.
“I’m all right, Honey, don’t worry. I’ll see you downstream.” Harry reassured Draco, spinning around on the log, trying to act less frightened than he felt.
“Neighborhood!” Hagrid yelled before gravity got the best of him and he sat back down on the sidewalk.
“Now James. Now please, darling, settle down and play me your pretty little song.” Draco asked as he jumped into the comfy chair next to the piano. He stretched out his back before sitting with his tail wrapped around his legs, eager to hear his children sing.
Lucius mouthed “Oh, no” to himself as he tried to think of a way to get his hat back. Sirius fell asleep quickly this time around, and Lucius decided to try a diversion tactic. As Sirius slept, Lucius pushed his arm through the hay and started to scratch the dog’s belly.
Harry flailed more in the water, and fell back under the surface once more. The geese still swam behind him watching him curiously.
“Lay some skin on me, Pans Cat.” Harry said, stretching out a paw. Pansy gave him a high-paw with a chuckle as the rest of the gang joined in the conversation. A mixture of silly inside jokes and “Welcome home, Potter” greets Harry as he looks around the room.
Pans played a few notes before stopping to address her friend Harry. “Well, lookie here. Big man Potter’s back in his alley. Swing on down here, daddy.”
“Draco, this is the greatest cat of them all.” Harry introduced a flirtatious Pansy to Draco. Pansy waggled her eyebrows at the white cat, took off her fedora with a bow and smiled at the newcomer.
“Oh, yes, Monsieur Potter. These are my children,” Draco answered as he looked at his kittens fondly.
Neville’s head hung down from the top of the barrel Ron was walking through, a hungry grin on his face. Ron looked up in time to see him, startled, and ran back the way he came, fearing for his life. However, a paw reached out and caught him by the tail. Ron kept trying to run for a minute before he realized it was futile, and that was when he was pulled up in the air by his tail.
“You are charming.” Draco giggled as Pansy played with her fedora this time. “And your music is so…so different, so exciting,” he gushed at the band.
In between chuckles, Fred and George managed to pick up their uncle and drape his wings across their backs to support him. “Come along, Uncle Hagrid.” George whispered.
Draco turned his most dashing smile on Harry at that, hoping to adopt more kittens when their current babies had grown up. Harry’s face betrayed his shock for just a tiny bit before he relaxed and smiled back at his gorgeous partner. Harry sat up straight and tried not to mess with his collar. It was a very new sensation to have something around his neck, especially such a stiff collar. But now, he matched the family with his little bow in the middle and it made him happy though he would never admit it aloud.
“Hush your mouth,” Sirius whispered, before lifting his ear back up to listen closer. “It’s a motorcycle. Two-cylinder chain drive, one squeaky wheel on the front it sounds like. You go for the tires, and I’ll go right for the seat of the problem.”
Inside the house, Lucius was tying a knot in the top of the sack, complaining to the cats as he did so. “You came back? Oh, it just isn’t fair.” Lucius whined as he shook the sack he was holding.
Ron nodded and turned to go…before the words sank in, then he stopped and repeated, “Alley cats? But I’m a mouse.”
“Now, now, darlings, cheer up,” Draco replied gently. “Mr. Potter knows a place where we can stay tonight.”
Remus fell off first because the man’s shoes had slipped off and those had been the only thing keeping him attached. As he fell into the sidecar, Sirius put on his fiercest glare, only to find his partner grinning from inside. Remus pointed behind them and Sirius turned around to see Lucius sinking ever closer to the ground, trying to keep his feet up as high as he could. The umbrella had a different idea though as once again the poles darted upward, thwarting Lucius’s floating efforts. As the umbrella fell back into its normal spot, as if trying to put itself away, it trapped Lucius’s face inside it and somehow the man managed to catch himself atop the rogue motorbike.
“All right. First, to make the magic begin, you wiggle your nose. And tickle your chin. Now you close your eyes. And cross your heart. Then presto! Breakfast a la carte.” Harry said with a flourish to move the tarpaulin and expose the cream canister. All three of Draco’s kittens had done every step of the spell eagerly, though Albus had briefly peeked when Harry had told them to close their eyes. All in all, a very impressive bunch of kittens, they were. The kittens opened their eyes and were happily amazed to see a giant canister of cream before their eyes. It really was like magic!
Harry spun the pointer with his wand as they broke apart, and the arrow landed on the left hand-red. A few spins later the men were interwoven like a human pretzel, barely able to hold up their bodies which caused them to slip. Harry flicked his wand at the spinner and lost his balance, which led to Draco falling on top of him as they both collapsed onto the mat. They lay there chuckling for quite a while before playing a few more rounds, each one ending in a similar fashion. Eventually, as they lay giggling, both men’s stomachs started to grumble loud enough to be heard over their laughter. They got to their feet to get ready for dinner. Harry started to cook a simple but delicious meal while Draco helped set the table before he sat down to watch the green eyed man cook. Draco was almost drooling due to the smell but also due to the view, as Harry was cooking in just his boxers.
“Look, Luna. What do you think?” Narcissa asked, turning to look at the other woman after checking the camera.
Draco followed suit, sitting right beside Harry and leaned up against him, cuddling in closer as Harry wrapped an arm around his waist. The sharks kept swimming around lazily, a few looked at the wrinkles in the water, but that was the extent of their curiosity. Deciding that it would be safe to jump in Harry eased his way into the water. His head went under and he held his breath as he looked around at the sharks. None of them did more than glance his way so he stayed under as long as he could before breaching the surface. Harry smiled up at Draco and held out his hand to his blond boyfriend.
“Well, it is most important that I get back to Paris. So if you would be just so kind and show me the way…” Draco asked hopefully.
“Oh, boy, fellas, let’s rock the joint!” Seamus said excitedly as he started to drum his heart out on his pots and pans.
The herd of cats and the mouse ran down a busy sidewalk, full of shops and cafes, at one of the tables sat Mundungus Fletcher, getting an early start to his day of drinking. He had a bottle of wine that he was drinking from without a glass as his bleary eyes looked around lazily. Not caring what was happening around him, but wanting some visual stimulation nonetheless. As he looked around, Mundungus saw a small pack of cats running past him at full speed, being chased by a tiny mouse! His eyes grew wide and he attempted to sit up straighter as he did a double take, surely he didn’t see what he thought he had seen? After watching the mouse continue to chase the cats, Mundungus looked at his bottle, put his head on his hand, and poured the liquor out onto the sidewalk. Clearly he was drunk enough already. The cats and Ron ran through the streets heading towards the mansion in a furry flurry.
Realizing that their target was now able to move quite fast, Remus turned to his partner and said, “Step on the gas, Sirius!”
“I’m the leader. I’ll decide what it was. It was a little old cricket bug,” Sirius grumped, settling back into the side car to sleep.
“Stop staring at me like that and shake your cute sparkly patootie all the way into the ocean,” Draco said as he tried to give Harry a stern face… which he failed miserably at mainly because well Harry looked deliciously adorable in his new swimwear. Harry nearly collapsed into a fit of giggles at Draco’s words, rather uncharacteristic of him on their own, followed by his facial expressions.
“It isn’t Beethoven, Papa, but it sure bounces,” James said from the piano, where he started to bounce along to the beat.
Their last night in the wizard BnB was full of cuddling in bed, naked but enjoying intimacy without sex this time. Harry and Draco took turns drawing shapes on each other’s bodies, sometimes just drawing lines all the way down their sides. Both men enjoyed their last night of peace and quiet, knowing they had to go home the next day and start to get back to their normal, somewhat busy routines. They talked about their vacation and the fact that both men wanted to come back here every vacation from now on, or almost every vacation. Harry thought about them possibly packing in such a way that they could sleep near the waterfall or the cavern next time, and Draco agreed it sounded like a cool idea so long as he got to pack some comforts. Harry chuckled at that but agreed so long as it got Draco to sleep in the cavern with him.
Harry returned in his boxers, wanting to be comfortable and not really feeling the need to have a shirt on. They sat down to eat lunch, digging in happily while they discussed ideas for how to spend the rest of their day. Harry and Draco were both rather tired so they decided to stay inside and play some games for the rest of the night. They started off playing Clue, which is rather hard with just two people, but both men loved the challenge. Draco had recently found an old muggle game and had bought it immediately, so when they were done with Clue, Draco ran to his suitcase to grab his surprise. Harry watched curiously, slightly worried about what Draco had found because Draco had a mischievous look on his face. Sure enough, Harry groaned when he saw the game in Draco’s hand, he had found Twister!
The rest of Pansy’s band joined in eagerly, and they all danced on top of the piano as they played. They sang the chorus as they played, well, yelled it, mostly, due to how loud their music was. “Everybody, everybody, everybody wants to be a cat.” They stomped while they played and after the chorus, the floor beneath them gave way. They sang the chorus and stomped and played their way through every floor of the abandoned house they were in. Once they reached the ground floor, the band played their way out of the door and onto the street, though their instruments were a little worse for wear.
Lucius lost his balance atop the motorcycle and his leg moved to the sidecar. The sidecar jerked to the side again and Lucius fell forward, terrified of hitting his face on the ground. His hands started to walk on the ground beneath him in order to keep his head up while his legs were in a painful splits. Remus had moved away from the foot at first, not wanting to get hurt again, but once he realized that Lucius had no way to move his foot, Remus decided to get revenge. Smiling, he rolled up the man’s pant leg, and then went to town biting on the man’s thigh and calf.
“That’s a magic carpet?” Draco asked not entirely sure what Potter meant, as he didn’t see any carpets in the truck.
Inside the trunk, Draco and the kittens had worked their way free of the sack, but were still trapped within a locked trunk. Harry had realized that the window to the stable had a hole in it, so he snuck inside, jumping up to the loft above, wanting to remain unseen.
Unfortunately for Harry, being caught off guard like that made him hard almost immediately. He was in the middle of finishing up some last minute paperwork on a case that had literally finished around the time he was supposed to head home. Thankfully Harry was sitting at his desk and didn’t have to stand up…yet. Harry fought back a groan as he tried to maneuver his robes away from his erection. Unable to focus now though, Harry pulled his phone back out, and sent a slightly angry text to his husband.
Draco started off sounding bitter and snarky but at the end his voice became a whimper of emotion and need. Harry’s anger and annoyance dissipated immediately when he heard Draco’s voice fill with sadness. Harry had been missing his husband as well and since Draco had become good at covering his emotions sometimes Harry forgot just how much love Draco needed. Harry pulled the blond into his arms and held him tightly, breathing in the minty scent he had come to associate with home and safety. Draco sighed and relaxed inside Harry’s arms for a minute, but soon his sigh became a low moan. Both men still had hard-ons…and the hug had pushed them up against each other. Harry felt a low moan escape him in response and his face flushed darker.
Sure enough, outside the cats that were not part of Pans’ Gang were either on the fence swaying to the music, or hanging out near enough to hear it under the lamp post. Draco didn’t know this however, as he was still at the harp, harmonizing with the cutest black cat in the world.
The group waddled along in companionable silence after that, everyone lost in their own thoughts about Paris, food, and home. Harry, for one, was just glad the birds had stopped talking.  They sure liked to pick on him. He wasn’t a fan but he was intrigued to see this Uncle Hagrid character. Draco walked along happily, glad to be getting closer to Paris, and to his Madame, with every step. The kittens were all rather entranced by the geese still, and so they didn’t mind the waddling or the companionship. Albus tried to model his walk after Harry’s after a while, because he looked up to the black cat. By the time they arrived at the street the Café was on, it was dark and the sounds they heard coming from inside didn’t bode well.
Harry chuckled and shook his head at Draco. He grabbed Draco’s suitcase and carried it the rest of the way down the stairs.
Harry rolled his eyes before stretching out his legs and arms, not wanting to injure himself while playing a silly game. Though he had to admit getting tangled up with Draco sounded like a fun and potentially sexy time. Draco finished setting up the game and decided to stretch a little as well, sitting right next to Harry and poking his toes with his own. Harry chuckled at Draco’s adorableness before standing up and grabbing his wand; he went and stood on the twister mat. Clearly, the best way to play this game would be to stay on the mat and use magic to move the spinner. Draco joined Harry on the mat shortly after, pulling Harry into his arms for a bear hug. Harry returned the hug happily and relaxed into Draco’s arms.
Ron was furious and terrified as he felt the claw touch his fur. “Why did I listen to that Potter cat?” He cried.
Harry and Draco took turns attempting to rid the other of sand, wanting to leave as much of it on the beach as possible. As Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s unruly hair, he couldn’t help but laugh. Harry’s hair was always a mess and hard to style but the sand managed to magnify those traits exponentially. Harry made a face as sand almost fell into his eyes, his hair had fought back and knotted around Draco’s fingers, making sand fly everywhere as Draco gently freed himself. Draco apologized in between giggle fits as he helped get Harry’s face clean of sand. Harry glared at Draco once his face was clean enough to open his eyes, but the glare quickly became a smile. Draco’s eyes were silver in their delight, making them the most beautiful color in the world to Harry. Draco stared lovingly into Harry’s emerald eyes, enjoying the way that the barely present sun made them sparkle. Unable to stop himself, Draco closed his eyes and guided Harry’s lips to his and kissed the dark-haired man gently. Harry returned the kiss happily and just as softly, not wanting to ruin the tender moment they were sharing.
The kittens jumped down first, excited at the idea of a surprise and their dads followed them curiously. Ron had recovered from the flash by this point and ran after James, grabbing hold of the kitten’s tail so that he could keep up. Luna started to pack up the revised will, getting ready to head out for the night when music reached her ears.
Hermione glared at the man, annoyed to even know him, in that moment. She loved Draco and his kittens as much as she loved the Madame, who always treated her so well. Anything that helped keep Narcissa happy was great in her book; the old lady was kind and full of love. Hermione was livid, and if looks could kill, Lucius wouldn’t be walking or laughing ever again. Ron had climbed up to hide in Hermione’s mane when Lucius came in, not wanting to be found or possibly stepped on. At Lucius’s confession, Ron moved up right next to Hermione’s ear.
“As you can see the sharks don’t seem interested in me. Will you join me, my love?” Harry asked as his emerald eyes shined with excitement.
Ron glared up at the cat and grabbed his hat from the giant paw above him. “Don’t worry about me. Potter needs help. Draco and the kittens are in trouble!” Ron cried.
As he sang this verse of his song, Harry gracefully got down from the tree and strutted closer to Draco. Draco was trying not to stare, so he started to groom one of his front paws slowly. Harry kept getting closer, eventually propping himself up on a boulder while watching Draco intently. Draco met the other cat’s eyes a few times but did his best to focus on his grooming.
Huffing, Scorpius took off after James replying, “I’ll show you if I’m a gentleman or not.” They chased each other for a minute before James managed to trip his sibling. From the safety of the ottoman, Albus cheered on James as he watched.
“Oh my goodness Lucius, I know Luna.” Narcissa responded as the wild haired blonde in odd spectacles entered the room. All three of the kittens meowed happily at the new arrival and ran to circle her feet. However they kept a good eye on her movements as none of them were stepped on.
“Come on. Let’s all start meowing.” Scorpius suggested. All three of the kittens started to meow loudly at the locked cat door, hoping that Madame would find them soon and open the door.
As Lucius was ironing his work clothes, he heard Narcissa’s voice come down the pipe. A will, just what he had been afraid of! He slows his ironing, scoffing a little at her mention of their divorce, before shushing himself so that he can hear what is being said. Lucius decides to stop ironing completely and goes to sit next to the metal pipe that connects his room to hers in case she ever needs to call for him during the night. The pipe has a cover, but Lucius, being the sneaky devil that he is, has removed it in order to eavesdrop on this conversation. His future is at stake after all!
Draco stopped struggling with the guard at the sound of Harry’s voice and looked up at his husband, silver eyes alight with love, lust and passion. Harry’s emerald eyes locked on his, and he smiled while shaking his head. Draco had always been persistent, so it didn’t really surprise Harry that his husband had decided to show up at the Ministry when Harry had not texted him back. But he had been hopeful that Draco could wait for him at home.  He was clearly wrong. Rutherford nodded at Harry and stepped back to clear the way for the Auror to pass. Harry nodded appreciatively at the guard and waved bye to everyone still in the office, his face only slightly flushed.
Scorpius walked to the edge of the truck, stood up on his hind legs and waved at Harry. “Sayonara, mister…”
“You know, Luna, if Lucius had only known about the will, I’m sure he never would have left.” Narcissa mused as she focused the lens of the camera. Once the lens was set, Narcissa pulled away to do some last minute preening, Draco had already been trying to straighten out Scorpius’s bow collar, and Narcissa had her eyes on Harry.
“Ooops! Oh dear. Slip of the hand and it’s off to dreamland. I say, that’s not all that bad. Slip of the hand, dreamland.” Lucius chuckled at his cleverness.
Not needing to be told twice, Harry jumped down from the window and slid across the piano, which spun poor Seamus around in a circle for a bit on his stool, in his hurry to greet his friend.
“You know, uhh…not exactly your type, Draco. Maybe we’d better find another place, huh?” Harry said, even as the kittens, energy replenished at the sound of jazz music, ran past the adults and into the window of Potter’s house.
“Madame, uh may I take your parcel Madame? It really is much too heavy for you.” Lucius stammered, reaching out for the package in Narcissa’s hands.
“Well, shoot fire. Don’t get sore at me. I ain’t done nothing.” Remus defended himself grumpily as he turned in the basket so that his head was under the opening now, and his paws stuck over the edge.
The noise woke up Ron, who walked out of his hole and behind a banister to listen. “Draco? Kittens? Gone? Why, that’s terrible!” Ron exclaimed worriedly as he put his hands to his head in shock. “But where? Why? Good heavens. Anything could happen to them on a night like this. Get washed down a storm drain, struck by lightning…” Ron fretted aloud before running back to his house as he said “Oh, they’ll need help. I’ve just got to find them.”
Blaise picked up the bottle and looked down at the mouse hungrily as Ron kept talking. “But honest! He told me just to mention his name.”
“Well…I guess they won’t need me anymore.” Harry turned to head back towards his house, walking slowly with a heavy heart in his chest.
“Come now Luna. I don’t wish you to sue anyone. Though that may change based on whether or not Lucius signs his portion of the divorce papers I guess. But for now, I need your help to make my will.”
The now empty sidecar followed the motorbike in running over Sirius as poor Remus slowly spun up higher on the windmill, trying desperately to get down. As the blade turned sideways, Remus managed to get unhooked and watched as the man jumped off his own blade, umbrella back to normal, and tried to float down to get away. Remus refused to let go of their quarry so easily. He ran the length of his blade and jumped as far as his little legs could carry him. He managed to make it to the man and wrapped his front legs around the man’s knees, holding on as tightly as he could. Remus and Lucius spun as they fell and Remus slowly slid to where he was barely hanging on to the man’s feet. They fell faster due to the extra weight. Sirius saw them falling and grabbed hold of the sidecar, using it to circle underneath, hoping to catch them.
He struggled to breathe, and the exhaust proved to be too much for him. Unable to hold on any longer between his coughs and the jerkiness of the motorbike, he went flying from the bike, landing with a thud against the curb. Ron’s hat fell to the ground in front of him, and he pulled up his goggles to watch Lucius. His fur was black from the exhaust and he was still coughing as the evil man sped away into the night. Ron climbed up the curb to get out of the street to recover from his adventure before starting the walk home.
“No, no. Back off, boys. I’m doing fine.” Harry protested trying desperately to hold onto the vine in his mouth.
The handle hit Sirius on the chin and almost took off his head in it’s trail upwards. Sirius glared up at the umbrella, angry at being attacked by an object. Lucius had been standing atop the hay, trying to get his umbrella back and needing the leverage to pull it harder, as the umbrella finally got free. However, Lucius slipped on the hay and slid off the bale. The momentum of his fall sent the sidecar flying as he fell on his bottom.
“Yeah. All those little kittens, Draco,” Harry agreed as he jumped up next to the white cat. “I love them,” he admitted as he scooted so that they were touching.
“Scorpius’s the caboose! All aboard!” Albus called out not seeing the glare Scorpius shot him at being the caboose.
“Last one in has to get naked!” Harry called as he ran as fast as he could into the ocean, diving in just a few seconds before Draco.
Eventually, Draco started to fidget as his skin started to itch from the sand so he sat up, wanting to rinse off the sand. Draco sashayed back to the cavern, winked at Harry, and wiggled his bum. Harry giggled at Draco’s dancing, refusing to move until Draco stopped shaking his ass though, because the view was delicious. When Draco jumped in, that was Harry’s cue to get up and join the blond. Draco swam without a charm for a while, trying to rid his hair of sand. Once his goal was accomplished, Draco re-bubbled himself so that he could swim without fear of swallowing saltwater. Harry dunked his dark curls into the water and tried to shake the sand out of his hair for a while before he recast his bubble head charm. Draco swam laps around the cavern for a bit longer, chuckling as Harry shook his hair back and forth hoping to rid himself of the sand.
Rosmerta was back on track to deliver her load now, and hadn’t seen the cats all sneak in the back. Glad to be back on the road, Rosmerta was driving along, humming happily to herself. Her red hair was flying in the wind but she didn’t care, she preferred it down anyways. Harry, Draco and the kittens were starting to relax, now that the drama had passed, and that’s when Harry had a great idea. They were in a truck that was carrying cream…so it would be a shame not to eat.
Unable to resist the fun music, Albus plopped himself, paws still covered in paint, atop the keyboard as James returned to the bench. James made a face but kept playing even though Albus was getting paint on him and the piano keys. As they played their scales song again, Draco and Scorpius sang the words together. The final few lines were sung by the whole family and the piano part ended with both Albus and James using all four paws to play. They jumped back and forth and only stopped when they bumped into each other headfirst, landing on their bottoms on the keys.
Draco squished himself up against Harry hard for a minute before backing up to grab his suitcase. Harry grabbed his own and both men turned on the spot apparating with a crack to their BnB. Harry unlocked the door and held it open for Draco who thanked him and ducked inside. Draco gasped as he took in the house they were staying in. It looked like a quaint little cottage on the outside, but the inside of the house was beautiful and reminded him of a castle. Draco ran into their room to drop his suitcase before flopping onto the bed. Harry laughed and  followed suit. They lay there for a few minutes, looking around at the room and getting used to their new surroundings.
“Heavens!” She screamed hitting the brakes hard, and her poor delivery truck screeched out at the force.
“Remus. Remus. Listen.” Sirius whispered to the long eared dog. Remus woke up and held out one of his ears, holding it up with a paw.
He looked under the first wheelbarrow he came to, nothing. He sneaked around some more, not realizing that his shoes, to those with better hearing, were in fact rather squeaky. Lucius tiptoed between the large piles of hay, looking around for his possessions. He found them at the same time that he found those vicious dogs. The brown one was sleeping in his side car, wearing his hat and the dog also had his umbrella! The little dog was sleeping in the bassinet Lucius had put Draco and the kittens in. Lucius had to bite back a scream as he ran away from the dogs, not wanting to be seen by them if he could prevent it.
Not wanting to miss out on the fun, George started to help fill in spots. “Draco, you’ll do nicely here.” He pointed out her spot.
Draco smiled at his son before continuing to dance with Harry, his silver eyes locked on the black cat’s sparkling green ones. Albus had ventured closer to Pansy, curious about her instrument. Pans Cat swept off her fedora with a flourish and offered her trumpet to the ginger kitten.
“Move!” Harry yelled as he turned to run towards his love. “Just tell ‘em Potter sent you, and you won’t have a bit of trouble.”
Ron put on his hat and coat and ran out the cat door as fast as his little mouse legs could go. “Draco! Kittens?” he called as thunder continued to clap and the rain poured down steadily. Ron pulled the flaps of his hat down and tied them in place before summoning his courage and running down the steps. Ron kept calling out for his friends for as long as he could stand but when he nearly got washed down a storm drain he had to turn in for the night, planning to go searching again as soon as morning came.
“Oh, no. No. We mean far more to her than that. Oh, I’m so sorry my dear. We just have to go home tomorrow,” Draco lamented snuggling closer to Harry and nuzzling his neck.
Harry, guessing the cause of the sound, reassured Draco by squeezing his hand. He pulled Draco into his arms and held him tightly. “We don’t have to get in with them if you don’t want to. If you want to and are nervous we could try the disillusionment charmed water gear. What do you say, my love?” Harry asked, kissing the blond’s forehead.
“Oh Luna.” Narcissa cries out amid her laughter as the other woman dips her. Draco’s silver eyes watch the two women expectantly, but Luna merely wiggles her eyebrows at Narcissa once more before helping her right herself and waltzing across the floor in time to the music. Scorpius and Albus dance around the women’s feet, enjoying the music and the joviality of the moment. Unnoticed by everyone, James has gone from holding the crank of the gramophone to sitting atop the spinning record and jumping over the needle. As the women start on their fourth lap of the room, James can no longer keep up with the pace of the record and trips over the needle. He flops face first into the record, with his little kitten legs and tail up in the air. He then gets underneath the needle as the record attempts to spin one more time, but the music slows and starts to sound off before stopping.
“So warm…and cozy,” Remus said as he hugged Sirius close to him. Sirius’s eyes widened in his surprise and he shimmied out of Remus’s arms, pushing the dog’s head down in an attempt to loosen his grip.
“Of course,” Harry replied confidently, “I’m the only cat of my kind.” Harry plucked a flower and gently tossed it at Draco’s feet.
Harry moaned at Draco’s excitement, stopping on his way back down to lick Draco’s tip as if it was a lollipop. Draco’s cries filled Harry’s ears and he felt his cock twitch in excitement almost in time with Draco’s. Harry kept going, working Draco’s cock up and down, loving the way the blond twitched under him. Not wanting to finish too soon, Draco pulled harder on Harry’s head trying to communicate to him silently, it took two tugs but Harry got the memo and with a final lick of Draco’s tip, the dark-haired man sat back, green eyes searching for Draco’s. Silver eyes, molten with desire and love watched Harry hungrily, while Draco gasped for air, wanting a few seconds to calm himself.
“Nice doggy, nice doggy! Heel, roll over, play dead!” Lucius called out commands frantically as he spun around in circles.
“This sure beats running, Sirius,” Remus said as he settled back into the sidecar and put his hind legs up, getting comfortable.
Narcissa sighed on the porch, shrinking in on herself in her grief. “Oh, it’s no use, Lucius. I’m afraid it was just the imagination of an old lady.” Narcissa re-entered her home clutching her head as she shook it side to side. “But I was so sure that I heard them.”
Once at the front door, he pushed his head through the cat door and looked around. No one appeared to be outside during this time of  night. Lucius let out a sigh of relief and opened the door as quietly as possible. He looked around as he stepped outside, holding the bassinet in his hands, hoping that no one would see him. He was so busy looking around at the lack of people outside that he tripped over a trash can near the door. The trash can fell over with a crash, and Lucius’s face landed right up against the blanket the cats were sleeping behind. He didn’t drop them, or actually fall himself, but it had been close. Once his balance was restored, Lucius shook his ponytail out of his face and looked back at the door.
Scorpius walked over to his brother and his father, doing his best imitation of the frog, which caused James to shrink down and try to hide in their dad’s fur. Scorpius giggled happily at his brother’s discomfort, enjoying his moment of feeling superior.
“Now look, kids, if I said magic carpet, magic carpet it’s gonna be. And it’s gonna stop for passengers…right…here.” Harry explained to the kittens happily, drawing an “X” in the ground with a claw.
The sharks looked at the men swimming with them curiously, but none of them tried to bite or attack. Draco looked at the different sharks in awe, curious as to why they were so used to humans. But since this was a B&B Draco felt like it had something to do with the regular visitors to the island. Draco slowly started to relax enough to swim with both of his arms so he let go of Harry and started to swim beside the dark-haired man. Harry twirled as he swam and he and Draco chased each other through the water and the sharks, who really didn’t seem to mind their presence at all. The lights above seemed to tap into the men’s emotions, going from purple to blue and bright yellow with their joy and love. They swam for a while, chasing each other through the sharks and under the natural tunnels of the cavern. The bubble head charm allowed them to swim for as long as they desired without needing to come up for air.
“I’m ready maestro.” Scorpius announced sarcastically. James stood up and started to play the keys hurriedly. He started in the middle of them and went all the way to the side where Scorpius sat all prim and proper. The piano made an unsettling sound as he hit the last key and Scorpius cried out. His poor tail had been under the final key and now it was bent and hurting. “Papa! He did it again!” Scorpius yelled.
A rooster crowed not far from where Draco and his kittens had been abandoned. The morning proved to be a sunny one. At some point, the rain had stopped and Draco had left the basket to give his kittens more room and to stand guard as best he could. He wasn’t sure who had done this to them or what kind of wild animals they might find this far out. Birds were chirping and the frogs had started to croak once more, yet over the sounds of wildlife a male voice was carried by the breeze.
This caused Narcissa to giggle happily, while Draco held a paw to his mouth in his embarrassment, though he laughed a little as well.
“Three?” Harry asked, confused. James came to join his brother and Harry said, “Four?” Albus joined his siblings as well and Harry incredulously asked, “Five?” His eyes had gotten rather big at this point. He hadn’t expected kids.
Draco hugged Harry back and purred slightly as Harry kissed him. He listened to Harry’s words and nodded thinking to himself. He had always wanted to swim with sharks but now that they were right in front of him, he was struggling with his anxiety. He definitely didn’t want to be eaten by a shark… he weighed the choices in his head, using the gear would make sure the sharks didn’t notice them, but it would make it harder for him to see Harry.
“I got ‘er wide open,” came the response as Sirius attempted to charge while pushing the sidecar and Remus in front of him.
Draco whined slightly and grabbed playfully at Harry’s ass, squeezing it briefly before giving Harry a gentle push ahead and both men walked out of their room and towards the ocean. Once they hit the beach, Harry started to run, racing Draco to the beautiful turquoise water.
Sirius and Remus barked as they gave chase, not about to let someone come onto their property and get away with it. They caught up to the haystack easily, and both of them jumped into the hay together, teeth bared and ready to attack.
“There is a whole network of Wizard BnB’s created by those of us who are familiar with Muggle technology because they have a version called AirBnB, so we took their idea and made it work for us,” Harry said with a shrug as they lay next to each other.
Draco chuckled happily before he replied, “They could hardly keep their eyes open. Such an exciting day.” Draco sighed as he and Harry turned to face the city.
“So long as you like having me around that’s all that counts, I guess,” Harry said with a joking glare at Draco.
A few pages of paperwork later, Harry’s phone buzzed again. He decided that since he was almost finished with his case file, it would be okay to ignore this current message and just power through to the end and text Draco as he handed the file in. That would give Draco something to be happy about, instead of Draco potentially getting more annoyed at him. It wasn’t Harry’s fault he had been so busy at work, an upsurge in Wizarding crime had really messed with his schedule. It’s not like he paid the criminals to do bad shit that required him to have to hunt them down.
“Yeah. Well, I guess you know best. But I’m gonna miss you, baby. And those kids. Gee, I’m gonna miss them too,” Harry conceded, snuggling closer to Draco while he could.
Harry, Draco, and the kittens watched out a window as Pans Cat and her gang disappeared into the night. Still singing and playing their loud music, they were joined by other alley cats as they went. Once they were no longer visible, and even the music had faded, Draco ushered his exhausted litter into bed. They tucked themselves in with Draco’s help, and each kitten slid down the pillow, into the open space between the bed and the blanket. Except for Albus, who trotted across the bed in his alley cat style and received a grooming attempt from his dad before tucking himself into the blanket easily.
“Oh and Lucius. I am expecting my attorney, Luna Lovegood. You’ll remember her of course.” Narcissa added before disappearing inside her home.
“Oh that phoenix cage? Hog wash!” Elevators are for old people and, well, normal people.” Luna replied looking back at the long haired man distastefully.
“Mr. Potter,” George said in a tone that was far too happy for Harry’s liking, “I think you should be the rear end.” George instructed while he gently pushed Harry into the spot behind little Scorpius.
Draco covered his mouth with his paw to try and hide his laughing smile. He loved all of the things about Harry they had just named off, and he was trying not to let that show. But also Harry’s look of annoyance was making him chuckle.
Harry chuckled before replying, “Keep your whiskers up, tiger. It’s just beyond that next chimney pot. Well, there it is. My own penthouse pad. It’s not exactly the Ritz, but it’s peaceful and quiet.” Harry said as the kittens and Draco looked across the roof to his house.
“Narcissa, what’s that music? Sounds like a gang of swinging hepcats.” Luna commented, dancing with her walking stick happily.
Ron yelled as the motorcycle sped off, and he had to turn around quickly to grab hold of the frame so that he wouldn’t fall off. Lucius had put down his riding goggles and sped out of the barn so fast that his legs somehow raised above his head. He managed to get his feet back to where they should be as he peeled away, still going too fast to be safe, but he was on a mission. Poor Ron was sat inside the tail light, bumping his head and his bottom on the edges as the motorcycle drove on the cobblestone road. The bumps combined with a sharp turn sent Ron flying out of his hiding spot, he managed to grab a hold of the license plate, but that put his face in line with the exhaust.
“Narcissa, my dear.” Luna greeted her friend and client with a warm and inviting smile as she entered the room.
Harry and Draco spent the next day relaxing indoors, soaking up their free time with books and movies they had been wanting to read or watch. On their last day of vacation they would go to the waterfall and spend the day there so they wanted one day to just relax indoors.
Sirius turned to look at his friend for a minute before turning back to watch where he was driving. All of a sudden, his eyes got big as he realized they were headed straight for a tree! The tree broke the sidecar clean off the motorbike with a metallic clang, as there had been no time to change course. Remus broke off to the left, alone in his unattached sidecar, and forcibly turned it to head back to where the intruder and his partner were. Lucius’s luck ran out with his umbrella and it shot straight up in the air, breaking and sending the man crashing onto the back of his motorcycle. The same motorcycle that Sirius was still riding. Reflexively, Lucius wrapped his arm around the thin dog, not wanting to fall off, and not caring about being attacked at that moment.
“Well yes that is a given but I am assuming you want to do something besides me on this vacation? There is a cool waterfall on the island, a nice shark cavern we could swim in… of course at any given time those activities can be stopped in order to enjoy each other. So I will ask again my love, what do you want to do today? Besides me, that’s guaranteed.” Harry winked as he finished speaking.
The kittens ran to the train tracks immediately, an idea in mind. The tracks were part of a bridge and it was huge.
They walked together hand in hand to the cavern, it was a warm day but walking was far more comfortable than apparating. The heat didn’t bother them as much as they were barely wearing any clothes and as the sun beat down on them, a nice breeze whipped around their bodies. Harry’s hair was a mess once more and Draco’s had even started to falter somewhat. They set their packs within a natural divot in the rock outside the cavern before disrobing and adding their robes to the pile. Harry led Draco to the entryway of the cavern and smiled as he heard a gasp come from the blond.
Once they had finished changing, Draco spent a few minutes just staring at Harry, unable to speak. Harry did love it when Draco was rendered speechless. It didn’t happen often, but the heat of Draco’s eyes was making him blush. Harry stared back at Draco just as intently, figuring that fair was fair, and he was rewarded as a brilliant pink flush filled Draco’s cheeks.
Lucius has another run-in with Sirius and Remus, as he goes back for his belongings. Potter and Co crash at Potter's pad for the night and meet Pans Cat and her gang of alley cats! Music ensues and it's super fun!
Scorpius walked past James with his head and tail held high once more, as if none of their fighting had happened. James and Scorpius both murmured “yes Papa” and headed to the piano. Once his face was hidden from their father however, James followed Scorpius closely giving him dirty looks. He pounced on Scorpius and then jumped off his brother as he sprinted to the piano. Scorpius responded by giving chase, neither of them truly listening to Draco’s instructions.
“Cats inherit first?” Lucius cried out as if the idea was causing him physical pain. “And I come after the cats? I, me, after…No. It’s…it’s not fair.” Lucius stood up in his indignation and hit his head on the pipe he had been eavesdropping through.
“No, no. This is no time for fun and games.” But all they could see were bubbles on the water, no sign of the cat anywhere. After a few more seconds, the twins stopped laughing, starting to worry.
“Siblings never fight fair.” Albus's voice from above. Then the candle he was on wobbled and fell out of it’s holder, Albus managed to stay on the table but the candle wasn’t so lucky. It fell off and managed to land right on top of Scorpius’s head.
Harry returned the smile with a wink as he enjoyed the view before him. Draco’s lightly muscled torso shimmered from the effect of their sunblock potion and his bulge in that speedo did things to Harry’s sanity. Draco started to fasten his thigh holster and Harry forced himself to look away and change, otherwise, they would never leave the room. As he changed Harry focused on his breathing, trying to calm himself down a bit so that they could actually do some swimming when they arrived at the cavern. Draco whistled from behind Harry as the dark-haired man changed in front of him. Harry felt himself blush, but shook his ass for Draco, enjoying the attention. Draco whistled more as Harry shook for him before breaking out into a giggle fit at their playful antics. It had been forever since they were both able to be so relaxed. Harry finished changing, tossed on a thin robe for their walk and tucked his wand into his own thigh holster. Draco watched Harry move with rapt attention, drinking his fill of the sexy man before him.
“Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this music into rum.” One of the wands started to smoke but otherwise nothing of note happened. Seamus chuckled and whispered to James, “That’s a hot one.” James giggled while still playing the piano in time with the upbeat jazz tempo. Pansy was back up dancing and swinging with her trumpet, lost in the music.
Draco chuckled at this show of alley cat toughness, before changing the subject. “Now that will do. It’s time we concerned ourselves with self-improvement. You want to grow up to be lovely, charming gentlemen. Now Albus, you go and start on your painting.”
“Scorpius, darling. Well, are you all right?” Draco asked as he gently picked his son up out of the tree he had fallen in.
Her vision now worse than ever due to lopsided spectacles, Luna flailed about on the stairs, going in a bit of a circle as she attempted to regain her balance. Terrified of this crazy woman dying on his watch, Lucius reached his arms around her trying to steady her before she fell all the way down the stairs.
Harry looked down and his emerald eyes found Draco’s silver ones watching him. He blinked for a second, making sure that this handsome white cat was indeed real, before smirking and continuing with his song, still maintaining eye contact.
The sputtering of an engine got their attention, and both dogs looked up to find the source. They saw Lucius, the man they had chased away not long ago, whistling smugly as he drove away. Lucius had the sidecar attached to his bike via his umbrella’s handle, with the fishing pole and basket in the car. And his hat was still on his head, so his mission was accomplished without any new bites. He sat up straighter in light of his triumph as he drove away.
“Absolutely stunning.” Draco agreed. He waved his wand and a fancy version of Lumos erupted to light up the cavern for them. Numerous small balls of white light floated above them now, allowing them to see the sharks swimming in the clear water. Draco gulped loudly, worried about possibly being attacked.
“Now that’s quite a family.” Harry commented, chuckling to himself. “Come to think of it, Potter, you’re not a cat. You’re a rat. Right? Right.” Harry agreed with his self criticism, scrunching up his face in a mix of anger and annoyance. “Hey, hey! Hold up there.” He yelled out to Draco and his brood.
“Papa, may we watch Albus paint before we start our music lesson? Please?” Scorpius asked in his cutest voice.
Albus’s eyes got really big as he remembered. “I was having a funny dream. Lucius was in it.” Albus wiped his face after his dad stopped grooming him before continuing. “And we were all riding and bouncing along…” The frog-erumpent croaked again, causing Albus to stop talking and listen. “Frogs? Uh-oh. It wasn’t a dream. Lucius did this to us.”
Instead of answering, Harry leapt out of the tree. His timing was perfect and he landed on the hood of the truck. The instant his paws hit the vehicle, Harry arched his back and let out his most menacing hiss, feeling his pupils dilate and contract to add to his scare factor.
“If you want…I wouldn’t mind making this a regular occurrence…” Draco said with a wink as they left the room hand and hand, ready to get home.
“Please get the kittens for me and tuck them into bed. They seem to be tuckered out after the excitement of today. I can manage Draco on my own but not all four.”
“Children, where are you? Answer me. James, Albus, Scorpius, where are you?” Draco called out frantically, looking everywhere for his precious babies.
A few nights later, Narcissa was having a nice party to celebrate the return of her beloved fur babies. Luna had come over, as Narcissa wanted to make a few more changes to her will. Lucius had vanished without a trace, leaving what little possessions he had behind, and she couldn’t really be bothered to care. Her cats were back at home, and they had found a nice, wonderful second parent for the kittens in Harry. He was a handsome and sweet black cat--albeit a little rough around the ears, yet Harry was settling in well and that was all Narcissa could hope for. Luna was sitting back at the desk in Narcissa’s room while Narcissa fiddled with the camera, wanting to take a photo of her now complete cat family.
Harry stayed out for a while longer, trying to get a handle on his feelings about what the next day would bring. He went to bed eventually, keeping guard at the end of the bed all night. They slept late the next morning so that everyone would be well rested for the last leg of their trip back home.
“They’re black…Now, how would I know that?” Sirius grumbled at Remus, who slid further into his basket in an attempt to avoid the glare coming at him.
“Now, my darling, don’t be frightened. You’ll see...” Draco’s soothing words were drowned out by an even louder thunderclap. Scorpius screamed and ran towards the basket.
“Oh, where am I? I’m not at home at all,” Draco thought aloud, sitting up and looking around. He jumped from the riverbank onto a branch before speaking again.
Ron appeared from his little hole in the wall, and stuck his head out to ask, “Did somebody say cheese?” In the next second the camera flashed, and Ron was seeing spots everywhere from the light.
Unaffected by Albus’s look of disdain, Scorpius lifts his head up as high as he can while stuck in the door before responding. “Because I’m a gentleman, that’s why.” Scorpius then jumped out of the door gracefully, preparing to trot away victorious.
“Oh, ha. Lucius, old chap, get used to the finer things in life. Someday they’re all going to be yours, you sly old fox.” Lucius complimented himself as he pulled out a bottle of champagne and started to work the cork out.
“That’s right. It was my favorite role. Narcissa answered, booping Draco’s head lovingly as the cat purred loudly in her ear.
Ron finally got some energy back after his cork injury at the sound. “The kittens!” He cried, stealing himself to run and try to save them. He jumped off the back of the piano, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.
All of the kittens perked up at that information, especially James and Albus, who were still walking.
Hagrid screamed in shock, having been startled out of his drunken reverie rather suddenly at the sound of his name. “Fred! George! My two favorite noophews!” Hagrid yelled back between hiccups.
Hermione nickered at Narcissa’s words, wanting recognition for her good job as well. Narcissa turned to the beautiful light brown horse with a smile and walked over to her.
Harry had leaned into the hug happily, starting to relax a little. His relaxation was cut short as Draco kissed his neck because it caused him to gasp and stand up straight. He knew where this would lead and he really didn’t want to start a fire in a house they were renting. It was bad enough that something had caught fire in their kitchen!
James was the first kitten to follow. Scorpius gave Potter a longing look as he sighed and followed behind his father. Albus followed but stopped to show off his alley cat skills to Potter first.
Rosmerta glared up at the black cat while yelling, “Sacre bleu!” She tried to catch the cat atop her head but he jumped off immediately and dashed out of the back of the truck. “Thieves! Robbers! Mangy tramps! Take that! And that!” Rosmerta shouted as she got out of the truck and started to throw a wrench and other supplies at the escaping animals. Scorpius tripped over a hole in the ground, and Harry grabbed him by the scruff to move him away from the angry person. They ran over some train tracks in their escape before entering a small hut on the other side and hiding within.
“Um, can I wait here one more minute? Maybe while you swim around more?” Draco responded, still a little nervous.
“Oh, Harry. Thank goodness you’re safe.” Draco exclaimed, sighing in relief. His grey eyes silver with happiness once more.
His phone buzzed once more, interrupting his internal rant about work. Harry groaned again but finished the file just a few minutes later. Currently he was still on track to be home within his ten minute time frame, so hopefully that would placate his blond. Adjusting his robes so that his erection wouldn’t show, Harry stood up and went to turn in his file, pocketing his phone and grabbing his bag.
Narcissa danced with Draco in one arm and her feather boa in the other, but soon her boa leaves her hand as Luna gets closer to her. Luna presses up against Narcissa’s body, taking her empty hand in hers and wrapping her other arm behind Narcissa’s waist. Draco is happily sandwiched between the two women, enjoying the sound of Madame’s laughter.
Remus tried to lift his head up, but didn’t get very far as his ear was pinned. It had apparently fallen out of the hay pile while he had been sleeping.
“Indeed it was. Glad I could be here for it. Sorry I was so needy earlier…I won’t text you a dick pic while you are at work again, I promise.” Draco replied, attempting to keep a straight and somber face.
“Because Potter…I was in desperate need of you. I had a hard-on all damn day just thinking about finally having you to myself tonight. You were supposed to be home hours ago. You have worked late every damn night this week and I need you.”
“I’ll never forget you, Harry Potter. Bye.” Draco forced his eyes to look away from Harry as he walked towards his kittens and his home.
“How about we start dipping our toes in the water without any magical help and see how the sharks react? If they don’t do anything too drastic we can just bubble our heads and dive in?” Draco decided nervously.
Lucius grabbed his jacket and ran to open the door for their guest, having heard the car pull up. He managed to open the door before Luna could knock, which had been his goal.
Lucius glared at the intrusion but replied kindly, “Coming Madame, coming.” Lucius ran into the kitchen, and tossed the sack into the oven whispering, “I’ll take care of you later.” He pouted and kicked the oven door closed before running to meet Narcissa.
“Nope, not here love. At least not while I am cooking. I don’t think it would be wise to have a repeat of last time.” Harry reminded the blond gently.
“Yeah…let’s go back to bed,” Albus yawned. Scorpius was the last kitten to leave the window, still hopeful that something would change.
Luna lifted up her spectrespecs for a better view, “Very good, very good.” She replied before swapping out her glasses back to her work ones. “But I think we should get on with the will.”
“Fancy that. A cat learning how to swim.” George agreed, watching Harry in the river and mistakenly thinking the cat wanted to be in the water.
Draco and Harry kept dancing for a while longer, enjoying the rhythm and the ability to unwind after some very intense few days. The kittens were all dancing around or watching the band cats dance and play instruments, enthralled. Pans Cat and her gang were playing away, lost in the music and loving every second of it. Suddenly, Draco noticed a harp, and decided that was a sign to try and wind them all back down. He knew that his little travel group was exhausted after all, so Draco sat at the harp and started to pluck at the strings with his claws.
“Onward and upward Lucius! Wheeeee!” Luna cried happily as she let go of his suspenders suddenly as she started to run back up the stairs once more. The suspenders snapped against Lucius’s skin with a satisfying thwack as she careened up the stairs at record speed, running into Lucius and almost running him over in the process. Lucius fell forward as his heels were stepped on and Luna had to bite back a giggle. She continued up the stairs at a more reasonable pace, giving Lucius time to recover enough to announce her to Narcissa.
Draco cast one last, sorrowful look at Harry before following his kittens inside. The door shut behind them and Lucius greeted the cats kindly, as if they hadn’t ruined his plans.
“Of course. The more the merrier.” Luna agreed from her spot at the desk, adding in some extra notes to the will.
They landed on a ledge a little bit under the track. Harry wrapped his paw around Draco and the kittens to try and hold everyone in place while the train thundered over the tracks above them. The bridge shook with the speed of the train and Draco stared up in horror, terrified that this wouldn’t end well. Harry and Draco switched to both clinging to the post and pressing the kittens against it to get a better grip to combat the continued trembling of the bridge. When the train finally left the bridge, Harry, Draco, Albus and James slowly poked their heads up through the gap in the tracks. And that is when they heard the shout.
“And how we celebrated your success.” Luna wiggled her eyebrows before continuing to speak. “Champagne, dancing the night away…” Luna stopped speaking in order to hum along with the music now, dancing gracefully with her arms out around her.
Draco then nipped Harry’s tongue in retaliation and swallowed the sound enthusiastically as their kiss grew more passionate. The two men rolled around as they kissed, constantly in motion, desperate for as much skin-to-skin contact as they could manage. Neither of them realized that at some point they had rolled off the blanket and were making out directly on the sand. Harry’s hands started to move towards the hem of Draco’s speedo, wanting all of Draco and no longer caring about being naked on a beach with his lover. Besides, they had booked the whole island for the week anyway, might as well take full advantage of their privacy. Draco moaned loudly as Harry’s hand found his erection and he ground his hips against his lover’s instinctively. Harry slowly worked off Draco’s trunks until they reached his ankles, at which point Draco kicked them off unceremoniously, too involved in Harry to worry about where they would land. Draco’s hands then tugged on Harry’s speedo, making quick work of it, fueled by his hunger and his intense desire for the dark-haired man.
“And, you dear, you take this place.” George continued excitedly as he gently shooed Albus to the spot behind his father. “Now that leaves Mr. Potter…” George said with a chuckle.
Draco’s voice was dripping with sass as Harry’s head came up out of the water. He gasped as the slowly setting sunlight fell upon the dark-haired man. Harry’s wet hair had a slight auburn tint to it in the orange light. His emerald green eyes sparkled in the light from the water and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Before he could stop himself Draco’s hand was outstretched and stroking Harry’s face gently. His goal had been for them to watch the sunset together in the ocean… but with the way Harry was illuminated Draco felt he might lose control and be rolling around in the sand with Harry before the sun went down.
“This is outrageous. It’s crazy.” Pans Cat cried out laughing. The band joined in the laughter as Ron ran into a bottle, hoping to be safe there.
“Oww! Ooh! Ow! Criminently!” Remus whined, holding his head in pain. He glared at Sirius angrily before walking back to another pile of hay to go back to sleep. Sirius curled up next to his partner, grumbling to himself about the thief getting away. Both dogs fell asleep quickly though, tired from the night’s festivities.
“I’ll see ya in the morning, Sirius,” Remus agreed as he slid down into the basket, his feet almost touching the bow at the top.
“Yes, we British like to keep things proper.” George agreed. He and his twin started to chuckle once more.
“Show you the way? Perish the thought. We shall fly to Paris on a magic carpet, side by side, with the stars as our guide.” Harry snuggled closer to Draco as he spoke. “Just we two.”
Draco couldn’t help but giggle at the term though he tried to hide it behind his paw. “Old pickle-puss? Now now. James, that is not kind. You know Lucius is so fond of all of us, and takes very good care of us.
“Hurry, Ron, hop aboard the motorcycle. And for goodness’ sake, do be careful.” Hermione worried as the mouse used her body as a bridge to get down from the window.
“And they are very fond of you,” Draco admitted happily, neither adult realizing that all three of said kittens were currently eavesdropping from the window. “Yeah…” James agreed before being shushed by Scorpius.
“Sherry! Sherry!” Hagrid shouted leaping into the air, before falling back onto his bottom from lack of balance. He looked up at his nephews with a bemused expression on his face, not a care in the world. He was drunk, he was loud, but he was in good company which is all that mattered.
“Scorpius! Scorpius!” Draco yelled in a panic, unsure of what to do. He couldn’t leave his other two sons behind and he didn’t want them jumping out of the truck and possibly getting hurt, but he couldn’t leave Scorpius either.
“My pleasure entirely. Aloha. Auf weidersehen. Bonsoir. Sayonara. And all those goodbye things, baby.” Harry waved sadly, while the truck started to drive away.
Draco wasn’t phased by Harry’s glare, so he merely chuckled in response before turning Harry around in his arms and kissing him. Harry moaned into the kiss, deepening it immediately, as he always craved more of Draco. Draco responded by pushing Harry against the wall of the shower forcefully, causing Harry to moan once more and Draco swallowed the sound greedily as their tongues fought for dominance. They stayed locked at the lips until the water started to cool down, only the temperature drop could get them away from one another. They were on vacation after all, and both men hoped to have a lot of sex during their time off. If he was being honest, Harry had mentally called it their “time off to get off” numerous times. Which always made him chuckle to himself, though he wouldn’t admit his nickname for their vacation to anyone else. Harry was thinking of this to himself as he dried off, a grin spreading across his face.
“Draco. Beautiful. Love it. And those eyes. Ooooh. Why, your eyes are like diamonds sparkling so bright. They make the morning radiant and light,” Harry responded, turning on his charm.
“We didn’t mean to ruffle you, squeaky.” Neville said with a smile as he playfully lifted Ron’s hat off his head.
“You’re tickling!” Scorpius protested as he laughed against his will. Scorpius managed to get out from under James and took off back the way they had come, right under the ottoman that Albus had been hiding under. Albus backed away and then turned to run from Scorpius since he had been rooting against that sibling. Albus jumped onto the table so that he could be out of the way, hopping up onto a candlestick for a better view.
“Wait for me, wait for me!” James yells as he chases Albus back to the mansion, Scorpius trailing behind him slightly.
Ron had been spending his days staring out the front windows, hoping to spot Draco and the kittens. He knew that if Lucius found them first, they wouldn’t stand a chance, so he had taken on the responsibility of lookout. He barely slept at all. He was so worried, but finally, this bright sunny morning, a few days after they had been taken, Ron saw them!
“So start mentioning names, rodent.” Blaise replied as he tried to hit Ron out of the bottle and into Seamus’s waiting paws. Ron flew into the Siamese’s paws and Seamus made a cage out of his claws to keep the mouse in place.
“Now, uh, you stand here, dear.” He instructed Scorpius, pointing at the spot right in front of him. “And, uh, let’s see. You take this position.” Fred said, picking up James and moving him in front of Scorpius. Both kittens were watching him excitedly.
“Now, my little pesky pets, you’re going to travel first class. In your own private compartment.” Lucius rambled as he opened a giant trunk lid, his face contorted in wicked glee. Lucius dropped the bag full of cats into the trunk with a thud. Draco and his poor kittens yeowled at the pain as Lucius shut the lid of the trunk and kept talking as if he wasn’t doing something terribly wrong. “All the way to Timbuktu.” Lucius told them, locking the trunk with a combination lock and spinning it. “And this time…you’ll never come back.” Lucius declared triumphantly.
James ran as fast as his little legs could carry him, not caring about the water splashing at his feet. He didn’t want to be eaten by whatever big mouthed thing was there hiding in the tall grass.
“Draco and kittens in trouble?” Harry asked incredulously. Then he quickly switched gears into hero mode and gave Ron orders. “Look, you go get Pans Cat and her gang of alley cats.”
Neville and Dean attacked him, trying to dodge the club, while Blaise had a different idea. Blaise loosened a rope holding a bale of hay, and sent it careening down on top of Lucius’s head. Lucius had been trying to lift the trunk since the cats had stopped fighting him, and he was nearly knocked unconscious by the unseen impact. His eyes swam with dizziness as he tried to come to his senses. He climbed back on the trunk hoping to be safe there. Seamus and Blaise threw a saddle around him, effectively trapping Lucius’s arms to his side. Pansy ran over with a bucket of water and tossed it on the man’s head as he teetered around unbalanced. No longer able to see, Lucius turned in a circle which gave Neville the perfect spot to attach the hook from the hay bale. When it was snug under the saddle, Neville motioned at Hermione and she pulled up on the rope hard. As Lucius’s weight lifted, Harry pushed against the trunk and out Draco and the kittens jumped, followed closely by the hero himself.
Harry sighed and got out of bed, still flushed but accepting his fate. He could rarely bring himself to tell Draco no, especially when it came to trivial things like this. Sure, Harry wouldn’t like to strut around in that speedo in the middle of Diagon Alley, but here on an island, with just the two of them? Harry would definitely wear a rainbow speedo to keep that light in Draco’s eyes.
“Forward march.” Fred called looking behind him with a smile. Everyone started walking at the command.
While they watched the geese depart, Harry felt himself smiling. The kittens had quite enjoyed the scene Hagrid had made and so they watched the geese leave both happy and a little sad at the loss of entertainment. Draco had spent most of the conversation trying not to laugh, and it felt nice to be able to breathe freely again. He had been worried about offending the twins by laughing at their uncle’s shenanigans.
Harry joins up with Draco and his family, not wanting to let them down. "Magic Carpet" ride, Harry almost drowns and the cats meet some twin geese and their crazy uncle.
Knowing that the cats were still fast asleep, Lucius waited without a care in the world as his engine popped to life. He was just another motorbike on the street, nothing new or interesting about him at all. Plus if the cats were still fast asleep, there would be no witnesses at all to his evil scheme. Grinning at his genius, Lucius made a U-turn on the road and headed off down the road, his hat popping up off his head every time his bike backfired. Lucius didn’t care, though. Why would he, when he was about to be rich? He started to turn down a street before realizing it would take him by the police station, so he swerved to make another U-turn and kept going on the road he was on for a bit longer. His nerves were definitely still on edge, impairing his judgment and making it hard for him to focus.
“Where did you find this again? I know I was skeptical at first but it truly is beautiful here,” Draco mused as he stared at their rather lush master bedroom.
“Don’t come in!” He yelled as he tried to run out the cat door. Since it was locked, he merely smacked into it much like the kittens had done. Unphased, Ron picked himself up and ran to a window. “Go away! He shouted down at the kittens, terrified for their safety. “Away!”
Completely spent, Draco fell forward onto Harry’s chest, not caring about the mess there. The only thought in Draco’s mind was his need to be held by Harry. Harry chuckled as he grabbed his wand, a simple swish cleaned them both up as Harry pulled Draco ever closer to him. Content, Draco rested his head above Harry’s heart and sighed, relaxing even more at the sound of Harry’s beating heart. Harry sighed contentedly and snuggled Draco closer, enjoying having his lover close. They lay there, savoring the safety and love they could feel surrounding them, as if their love was creating a barrier between them and the world. Harry and Draco’s favorite place was always in the other’s arms, regardless of where they were in the world.
Harry’s hair was rather clear of sand as he started to swim around with Draco and the sharks once more. They didn’t swim for very long this time though, as they were both rather tired from their earlier swimming and love making session. Harry and Draco exited the cavern, rinsed off their speedos in the water before getting dressed once again, and drying off before they headed back to the house. Harry had scheduled a magical food delivery from one of their favorite restaurants which was thankfully waiting for them on the kitchen counter. Harry started to plate their food while Draco ran to change and finish drying off, he returned shortly, wearing a deliciously tight tank top of Harry’s and a tight, brightly colored thong. Harry gulped at the sight before him and ran to change his clothes as Draco took over the unboxing of food. Harry playfully squeezed Draco’s ass as he walked past, on his way to their room, excited to be in comfortable clothes soon.
Fred and George just laughed at Harry’s words and one of them said “how awful” but between the laughter and the wheezing it was hard to tell who had said it. George composed himself first and spoke to Harry.
Lucius’s face was contorted in terror as he watched himself fly back towards his waiting steed, Hermione. She reared up her back legs and gave him a forceful kick as he came into range. The kick sent Lucius flying into the trunk, and the continued momentum brought him the rest of the way out of the stable. Harry darted out and quickly put the lock back on the trunk, not wanting to take chances. Harry had barely gotten back inside the stable when the delivery truck approached.
Scorpius didn’t say anything in response. He merely stood up, tried to get himself to full height, and stuck his tongue out at his brother wordlessly. Additionally the white kitten was glaring rather fiercely at his brother. Then the kittens ran to catch up to their father, who was still chasing poor Harry from the riverbank watching the black cat while he attempted to float along on the log.
Scorpius was watching Harry with dewy eyes, clearly crushing on the older cat. Albus was excited about Harry staying with them and learning the ways of the alley cats from a real alley cat. James was ready for that magic carpet ride, because a magic carpet ride sounded amazing. They all followed Potter over to where he had drawn the “X” excited to get their ride.
“Boy…” Harry changed the subject, struck suddenly by Draco’s eyes. “Your eyes are like diamonds. Gee. That’s pretty corny though, huh?”
Harry had been relaxing on his back when the truck stopped. Though he tried to grab onto the pickup bed, the momentum proved to be too great, and he went flying through the back window, landing on the driver’s face. Harry was screeching and yowling loudly in his shock and fear, eyes wild and his poor fur standing up on end. His tail had fluffed out to three times its normal size by the time the truck finally stopped. Harry looked down and his face became one of horror when he realized that he was sitting on the woman’s head.
The kittens trotted along happily chugga chugging as they stepped in sync with each other. Next Albus imitated a whistle while he led his siblings, with Draco and Harry walked along behind the kittens, keeping an eye on them. Albus shifted to a new noise, clickety clack, clickety clack, before imitating a whistle once more. Only this time, Albus’s sound effect was followed by a real train whistle! A train was coming straight towards them from the other side of the bridge!
Narcissa was in the middle of a weird dream when suddenly a rumble of thunder woke her up. “Draco? Kittens? Oh my gracious. I had the most horrible dream about them,” Narcissa said, rubbing her temple before shaking her head to clear out the bad dream. “Thank goodness it was only a dream. Oh dear, what a terrible night,” Narcissa added, hugging herself as she left the warmth of her covers and put her house slippers on. She grabbed her wrap to put on as she walked over to the bed her cats slept in, speaking words of comfort.
“Me, too. And my feet hurt.” James slumped as he voiced his complaints as well, lifting up one paw for emphasis.
“You know, they need…Well, you know, a sort of a, well, a second parent around,” Harry said as his swinging tail finally connected to hold Draco’s.
“Cats?” Lucius wheezes indignantly slowly falling onto the floor in a deflated heap of a man. He had just been dancing and skipping around his room rather joyfully but this realization definitely put a damper on things.
“Not a sign of them, Hermione.” Ron replied with a sad sigh. “And I searched all night once the rain stopped.”
When the sandwich was gone, Harry cast a bubble-head charm on himself and jumped back into the water, splashing Draco who squealed in mock indignation before collapsing into a fit of giggles. Harry was laughing as he came back to the surface, he loved splashing Draco, especially when the blond wasn’t expecting it. Draco cast a charm on himself before jumping into the water, landing rather expertly, on Harry. Both men started to sink but as they didn’t need to worry about oxygen, they just let themselves fall. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling the blond in close, their charms merging to create a bigger bubble of air as their lips met in a passionate kiss. The rocky surface touching their feet startled the men apart, and they chuckled at their surprise, realizing that they had been far too lost in each other to be paying attention. They walked around the bottom of the pool for a few minutes, collecting some beautiful seashells from the floor before returning to the surface to deposit their treasures.
Lucius stood up quickly, planning to capture the cats and hide them before their racket got Narcissa’s attention. Standing up and walking was far harder than expected though because Ron had tied his shoes. Lucius went from standing to nearly falling on his face to hopping about like a kangaroo. “Uh why!” Lucius exclaimed as he jumped a few more times before falling face down on the carpet. Ron ran by him unseen, as quickly as he could.
They barely broke contact in time to stop themselves from inhaling the salt water. Harry smiled at Draco lovingly and the two of them collapsed into a fit of giggles. Draco pulled Harry into his arms and they stood next to each other, still laughing as they watched the sunset. As the sun reached the horizon, the two lovers started to splash at each other, using the naturally occurring waves to drench each other. Harry and Draco laughed heartily as they played in the ocean like two carefree kids, finally relaxing completely from their long days at work. When splashing got boring, they both ran back onto the beach, deciding that it might be nice to dry off before going back inside. Draco had a different plan though, as soon as he heard “beach vacation” Draco had been hoping to make love to Harry on the beach. He didn’t care that they would both be covered in sand from head to toe, he just wanted to take Harry out in the open, with the serene soundtrack of the ocean in their ears.
“Dreadful.” Hagrid mumbled in agreement with the black cat, too intoxicated to feel offended over the look he was receiving. “Being British, I would have preferred sherry.” Hagrid finished his thought and started to laugh obnoxiously at his own joke. Fred and George, of course, joined in raucously.
“Oh?” They both asked curiously. The twins started to gossip amongst themselves about this new discovery. “It’s scandalous. He’s nothing but a cad. Absolutely. Possibly a reprobate. A roué. His eyes are too close together. Shifty too. Look at his crooked smile. His chin is very weak too. Obviously, a philanderer who trifles with unsuspecting men’s hearts.” The twins chatted about Potter like he couldn’t hear them.
The twins stuck their heads into the water and searched frantically for the possibly drowning feline. They couldn’t see him however and both brothers returned upright to compare notes. In unison they shouted “Deeper!” before diving back all the way under the water to find this poor cat. After another minute of searching, Fred and George had found the exhausted cat.  Together they brought him to the surface. The geese swam the exhausted beginner swimmer back to shore, propping him up between them
Draco meowed happily up at Narcissa as he stretched to give her a hug. Madame held him close, hugging him in return while still holding onto little Scorpius with her other hand. Draco and Scorpius booped Narcissa’s face lovingly as a sign of affection while purring. With his father distracted, Albus seized his chance to go bother the driver of the carriage, Lucius. Lucius was their Madam’s soon to be ex husband but he was currently in denial about that fact. He had resorted to taking on butler duties to try and convince Narcissa to let him stay. Though Lucius had treated her very badly so Albus didn’t see the harm in making his life more difficult. Which would be why the orange kitten was currently climbing up the side of Lucius’s face as he drove the carriage, wanting to play with the man’s hair ribbon. Lucius had really long hair that he tied back with a ribbon, and the ribbon looked like a perfect cat toy. Getting up on the side of Lucius’s face Albus felt a sense of victory before reaching out his paw to bat at the ribbon playfully.
“Hermione, tonight Operation Catnapper will be completed. Wish me luck. Fisherman’s luck,” Lucius said to the annoyed horse as he hopped onto his bike. Ron was sitting inside the busted tail light, and pulled down some riding goggles before waving good-bye to his friend. The motorbike started up, causing where he was sitting to become red. He looked around for a second before saying, “Good-bye Hermione.”
Harry stood at the end of the sidewalk, watching the door, hoping that maybe it would open up again soon and Draco would ask him to stay with them. Or that Draco would say he wanted to live with Harry. But nothing of the sort seemed to be happening so Harry sighed to himself before speaking.
Draco and Harry danced together to the beat, their front paws touching while they stood on their hind legs. They were essentially helping to hold each other up while they danced for a bit, until they landed in time with the music on all fours and shook their front paws from side to side in front of them, following their tails.
“Woah! Woah! Ohh!” They all yelled as the haystack crashed into a wheelbarrow. Lucius managed to split off his section of the hay, sitting on the side car instead. Remus and Sirius continued fighting as they took off in the haystack, not realizing that Lucius was no longer inside the hay.
Draco’s lack of attention was Harry’s cue to turn him over, so in one swift motion, Harry rolled them both around , putting Draco’s body underneath his. Draco quickly got on his hands and knees, desperate for Harry to take him. Harry started to get Draco ready for him, slowly inserting his lubed fingers inside the blond and enjoying every sound that came out of him. Draco thrust backward hard on Harry’s fingers, wanting more, needing more. Harry took his time, slowly moving, adding one finger at a time and priming Draco to take all of him. After spending some time with three fingers, Harry decided it was time to give Draco what he really wanted. Adding a little extra lube with his wand, Harry gently approached Draco’s hole, and pressed his erection against it, not going in quite yet, wanting to tease Draco once more. Draco moaned in anticipation as he felt Harry right outside of him, and he let out a small whimper, needing so much more of Harry than he currently had. That whimper broke Harry’s resolve and he gently pushed his way inside Draco.
“Lucius?” Asked Luna incredulously. Do you mean to say you’re leaving your vast fortune to your soon to be ex-husband? Everything you possess? Stocks and bonds? This mansion? Your country chateau? Your treasures, jewels and…”
Draco smiled down at Harry as he stripped down to his speedo and shook his head at his lover. Harry had always been adventurous and sometimes brave to the point of stupidity, so Harry diving down the slide first didn’t surprise him. However, Draco’s poor heart needed a minute to calm itself after watching Harry do crazy stunts. Draco steadied his breathing while gingerly sitting at the top of the slide, taking a deep breath, Draco pushed off and flew down the water slide, laughter escaping him as he went. Draco managed to stop laughing long enough to land in the water without swallowing any and swam towards Harry, eyes sparkling silver in their delight. Harry’s emerald eyes shone back at Draco, full of love and joy. Draco swam over to Harry and they cuddled together on the edge of the pool, taking time to relax in each other’s arms before going back up to the top and sliding down a few more times, laughing the whole way down.
Draco cried out in ecstasy as Harry filled him, and he thrust back against his lover, taking him immediately all the way to the hilt. Harry moaned at how tight Draco was as the moan turned into a yell of Draco’s name. Draco panted Harry’s name as the dark-haired man started to pick up his pace. He knew how Draco liked it and knew that they both loved going fast. After a few medium paced thrusts Draco was practically begging for Harry to speed it up, and Harry obliged happily. They both went as fast as their bodies could manage, in perfect synchronization the whole time, neither man missing a beat. Harry roared as he went faster and faster and loved the feeling of Draco’s ass crashing into his pelvis as they both thrust together. Both men were panting and sweat was mixing with the ocean water on their bodies as they continued to make love together, both lost in the other. To Harry, there was nothing in the world other than Draco, the love of his life, a man who gave him so much pleasure and joy. As Draco continued to thrust back into Harry the world around him ceased to exist, all he could comprehend was Harry inside of him, and the sound of Harry’s breath, sometimes broken by the man’s yells of pleasure.
Pans eventually settled back onto the bed, comfortable lying on the pillows and playing, but she stopped when she heard someone else on the piano. Little James was playing with all four paws, fast and expertly, while looking around at the band, proud of himself. Seamus joined him at the piano, wands in paws, and used them to hit the keys on the piano. While he did he muttered his favorite spell, though it never seemed to work.
Lucius quickly grabbed his hat back as it had tried to run away again and no sooner had the hat touched his head, than Remus and Sirius fell into the man’s lap. They had been kicked out of the car and were just now landing from their own momentum. Lucius saw them land and scooted backward quickly into the hay, not wanting to be caught by these vicious dogs again. Both dogs fell to the ground confused and annoyed, circling the area trying to understand what was messing with them.
“No trouble at all, little prince. And when we get to Paris, I’ll show you the time of your life.” Harry replied before he jumped into the truck with them. The kittens all stared at him excitedly, wondering what they were going to do in Paris.
“Oh Sirius, we done bit six tires today,” Remus said, stretching as he exited his pile. “Chased four motorcars,  a bicycle and a scooter,” Remus complained, cranky at the lack of sleep. Nevertheless, he trotted his short legs behind Sirius, wondering what his role was going to be this time. If he had it his way, he would still be asleep right now, but Sirius was loud when he wanted to do something. So it was better to just appease the other dog.
Harry moaned into the kiss as he let it deepen for a little while, enjoying the intimacy of the moment. However, before he lost control and took Draco right there, Harry broke their kiss by leaning back to push them both down the slide. Draco cuddled closer to Harry and felt the other man’s arms tighten around him as they headed down. Harry rested his chin on top of Draco’s head as they flew down the slide, giggling at their positions but not caring.
“Oh. Oh, what a horrible, horrible human.” Draco said disgusted, while they watched Rosmerta from a safe distance.
Harry made a grumpy face at the words, and just glared at the geese while they finished their instructions.
Everyone stopped what they were doing, which had Ron been looking, probably would have made him laugh. Lucius was standing with one leg partially in the air, trying to shake off a chubby Blaise, his other leg clung onto by Neville. Lucius had poor Seamus by the tail and Dean by the neck, one cat per arm. Pansy was atop the man’s head about to go in for a nice scratching attack. Harry had been about to join the fray so he stayed put, watching Ron work intently. Now that he could hear, Ron picked the lock rather easily, smiling as he heard the click of the lock opening. That click was everyone else’s cue to go back to fighting and soon the sounds of cats fighting and Lucius grumbling filled his ears again. Harry ran to help open the trunk, jumping inside to check on Draco and the kittens.
As the dogs fell back to sleep, Lucius made his move. Perched so that he was leaning precariously against the top of the mountain of hay, he slowly reeled his fishing hook down. His goal was to get his hat back off of Sirius’s head. He managed to hook the hat on the first try, but as he reeled it up, the hat fell off the hook and landed on the head of the smaller dog. Lucius looked down in shock at his bad luck and noticed that Sirius was stirring below him. Sirius’s paws went up to scratch his head, but he noticed his hat was missing! Wide awake once more, Sirius looked around frantically for his runaway accessory. He looked all around his bed but didn’t see it, then he checked the ground, and that was when Sirius saw his hat on Remus’s head! Furious, Sirius reached down to take back his hat while chiding Remus.
Fred was tapping his wings together in excitement, looking down at the kittens of the group. He had a fun idea about how to travel with the little ones, and couldn’t wait to line them up.
“Well so long as you promise we can stop whatever we are doing to enjoy each other, I say the shark cavern swim sounds wonderful for today. Once we finish our breakfast that is,” Draco answered thoughtfully as he ate.
Harry had been next to Hagrid as he spoke, and when the large goose leaned into him, Harry leaned away quickly, wrinkling his nose. The goose smelled like a pub. “Basted? He’s been marinated in it.”
Draco stirred his coffee for no reason, it was perfectly mixed already but he didn’t want to stare at Harry while thinking of things to do that weren’t him. Clearly, that wasn’t the correct answer in this situation and those emerald green eyes always managed to escort his mind to the gutter. He loved the ideas Harry had listed but he wasn’t sure which one sounded best for today.
“Fine, okay. I am cock sick and I need you to come help me. Now get that sexy ass home now!” Draco’s desire was almost palpable through the phone.
Lucius had just breathed out a sigh of relief at having avoided the police building when his sigh turned into a yelp. He hadn’t been watching where he was going and suddenly he found himself driving down a stairway, heading into the metro station. Face contorted in fear, Lucius allowed himself to go down the stairs until he found a safe place to turn and head back up. A train’s whistle filled his ears as he did so, adding to his terror because he narrowly avoided being hit by a train. He calmed down as he managed to leave the metro station behind and continued chugging along the street and over the bridge that led him out of the city –  it wouldn’t do to just drop the cats off in the city, they would be found far too easily. No, he had to ensure they were never found, or at least never returned, so into the countryside he drove.
Draco shook his head and sighed at that. “I most definitely do, plus life would be so boring without you my love.” Laughter overtook Draco at Harry’s feigned anguish at his words.
A second after Harry had promised peace and quiet, a light came on inside his penthouse and loud jazz music flowed out of the open window.
“Draco! Kittens! Draco! Where are you? They’re gone! They’re gone!” Narcissa ran screaming through the top floor of the mansion.
Harry pressed his body up against Draco’s and slowly wrapped his arms around his lover’s hips, hugging him loosely. Draco smiled as their kiss broke and he laid his head on Harry’s shoulder soaking up the love and comfort he was receiving. They stayed like that for a while, in a loose yet comfortable and love filled hug, the rest of the world completely forgotten. Harry slowly started to help Draco get sand out of his hair as they both shivered slightly, reminding them that it was in fact, night time. They rinsed off rather quickly after that before using their wands to find their robes and discarded trunks before racing back into the house. Once inside, Harry and Draco hung up their wet clothes, grabbed new towels and hopped in the shower. Both men wanted to try and get more sand off of their bodies, plus the warmth would be refreshing. Draco and Harry took turns washing each others’ bodies and ensuring that no grain of sand stuck to them. It took Draco a while to get all of the sand out of Harry’s hair causing Harry to feel bad about it, so he helped Draco because the poor man’s arms had to be tired. With both of them sorting through it, Harry’s hair was sand free again in no time. Draco shook his head in mock indignation at how challenging Harry’s mop had been.
“I’ll show her.” Albus said jumping down the step of the hut and hissing and spitting at the truck in the distance.
Scorpius ran out of the basket and sat next to Harry, gazing up at the black cat excitedly. “Oh, that would be wonderful,” the white kitten said excitedly.
Harry made an incredulous face at the two twins, still rather annoyed at them. He didn’t quite understand their sense of humor. And on top of that…he didn’t like the fact that they had nearly gotten him killed.
“Just need a few, then I need you to take me…” Draco murmured breathlessly. Harry smiled and kissed the blond’s lips gently before summoning the lube from their bag. He took his time gently getting Draco ready for him, not wanting to disrupt his boyfriend’s attempt to calm himself more than was necessary. Then Harry focused on himself and by the time they were both lubed up, Draco’s breathing had become steadier. Grey eyes locked on green before Draco nodded.
“Oh! Right-o, boys. Birds of a feather must…” Hagrid’s words were drowned out by a massive hiccup before he finished his saying. “Together.”
Harry spurred to action immediately, running towards the little white kitten and grabbing him by the scruff. Harry ran with Scorpius in his mouth and jumped onto the edge of the truck. Scorpius flopped onto the truck bed and gathered his paws under him. Once righted, Scorpius ran over to his father, hiding under his legs, scared to be near the edge.Harry hung on for dear life by his front paws, hoping for a nice bump to boost him into the truck.
“Oh, I’m so sorry, but…we just couldn’t. You see, my mistress will be so worried about us.” Draco explained sadly.
“Potter?” Pansy asked immediately, no longer thinking about eating the mouse. Her confusion was echoed by the rest of the gang as they echoed the name. “Hold it, cats. This little guy’s on the level.” Pansy exclaimed.
Draco almost fell to the ground as Harry left him, completely spent. But Harry had been watching him and moved the blanket to catch his love before Draco could face plant into the sand. Harry then joined him on the blanket and held out his arms. Draco smiled as he turned to face Harry, silver eyes finding nothing but love and contentment in the emerald eyes watching him. Draco slowly moved to lay his head on Harry’s chest, still working on catching his breath. Harry’s chest was moving rapidly as he tried to get his breathing under control as well. Both men lay quietly for a while, regulating their breathing with smiles on their faces. Love was truly the best magic in the world, of that both men were certain. Soon the men started to feel cold, so they rushed into the ocean to clean themselves off, and warm themselves in the beautiful water.
“Come along Draco, kittens. Come along!” Narcissa called in a sing-song voice as she headed through the open door. Lucius was standing outside waiting for her to go in before putting away Hermione. As soon as she entered, Narcissa realized that she had forgotten something so she stuck her head out to speak with Lucius once more.
When Narcissa checked the living room on her way up to bed, she saw all of her sweet cats sound asleep. She picked up Draco in her arms and cradled him lovingly before taking the elevator up to her room. Narcissa passed Lucius on her way and whispered to him.
They went back to holding hands as they walked farther along the trail, both men now enthusiastically searching for the source of the noise. A giant boulder was in front of them, and it wasn’t until they walked around it that the waterfall came into view. Harry and Draco gasped in unison at the breathtaking view before them, the waterfall seemed to have carved a path for itself into the moss covered rocks all around it. The rocks glinted in the sunlight where the moss seemed to have been washed away at some point. The water was a brilliant turquoise where it fell, before it hit the bottom and turned into white water, churning with momentum. The pool of the waterfall was also a sparkling turquoise, the whole area was serenely beautiful and Harry and Draco felt certain they had found paradise. They walked towards the curtain of water, watching their step as they went so that they wouldn’t fall in. As their eyes continued to scan the landmark, Harry realized there was a small, natural water slide to the right of the big waterfall. He pointed it out eagerly and he and Draco rushed over to investigate.
Merlin knew how much he loved Draco’s legs, so delicate at the appearance so strong around him. And his flat belly that one day he would fill with his pups. His grey eyes shiny like stars. The perfect curve of his butt, which perfectly fitted his palms and the hot clench of his body around the first finger.
In front of the fireplace, Harry tangled their fingers bringing his hand to his lips kissing the ring while he looked at Draco. The blond felt so weak in front of such adoration that he felt the corner of his eyes fill with tears of joy. Harry tugged him closer sliding an arm around protectively as they walked into the flames together.
Coming back from his high Draco grabbed Harry’s hair tugging a little, the alpha was back on his chest tormenting his nipples.
Rationally he knew about the connection between Harry’s magic and Voldemort’s, and also that his past made Harry the man he loved. He just couldn’t stand the saw of grown adults sitting on their hands waiting for a teenager to save them. And now that he did it, they couldn’t just let him live the normal life that was always denied to him.
The knot pressed hard against him and Harry stilled. He takes back his hips a little pressing on Draco’s back with both hands and he slammed it in.
“Nothing, I just know war and people tend to die during it. Let me tell you, I wish you all the best, but if anything happens to him, or to you, wouldn’t you regret it? And I’ quite sure that everyone needs to remember what they are fighting for!”
“Nothing, I just know war and people tend to die during it. Let me tell you, I wish you all the best, but if anything happens to him, or to you, wouldn’t you regret it? And I’ quite sure that everyone needs to remember what they are fighting for!”
He came so hard that his body arched completely from the bed only his shoulders sustaining him. Harry panted in his ear hot wave of come filling him. It went on forever, his body falling back on the sheets shaking in the after-shock.
“I feel so full.” Whispered Draco, his voice strained with sleep. Now that his body was sated he was feeling the soreness.
Harry met him halfway, consumed by the need to have the omega close as possible. He dominated the kiss pushing his tongue inside right away, his hand cupping Draco’s face and the other one sprawled on his abdomen; right were one day his pup will grow.
The very same Draco who was sleeping with his mouth half-open on the pillow beside him; his hair were wild after the heat and his cheeks still showed a little blush. It was the most beautiful thing Harry ever saw.
“You can, is recorded. I think Hermione convinced the press to assume a more muggle line of action, there were some cameras. One day that girl is going to shred the secrecy act, I’m telling you.”
He pushed Draco’ tights open with his knees and took the place was rightfully his between those white long legs.
Harry strengthened his grip on the omega chasing his orgasm. He could fell it building, his slowed his pace to put more intensity in his thrust trying to get his knot inside.
The orgasm came as a wave, starting between his toes then rushing up his legs and hitting him like as tsunami.
Now that the conflict was over and Harry saved them all it seems like everyone wanted a piece of him. Most of the time Draco felt like punching in the face the one who approached his Harry as ‘The choosen one’. Who choose him? A confused untalented future teller which never had made an actual profecy aside for that one time when she dumped the destiny of the world on a baby.
Probably it wasn’t so far from reality. Harry declared more than once how he was going to enjoy breeding him as soon as his body was free from suppressant.
His hand fisted in his hair and held him down against the blanket when he tried to rear up. Draco moaned, for pain and excitement, at the same time, his back was arching, needy for more until Harry’s groin was pressed against his ass.
Also this one is pretty safe...before for the third chapter, all the hard NSWF I was keeping in check exploded and well, it wasn't the only thing.
The auror whispered a weak levitate spell just o lift his body enough to push a pillow under his hips.
The orgasm took him by surprise, his toes curling as he emptied himself in the pliant body. Draco exploded in his hand shaking uncontrollably.
It wasn’t the first time these days. Harry put a block on their chimney to prevent anyone to bother them.
Harry was growing impatient, now that Draco was aroused his pheromones were driving him crazy with lust. He pressed a knee between his legs and Draco sleepily shifted his legs a little apart, giving him space. Playtime was over.
The day after he didn’t know what to expect out of the room they gave him. It was a weird house, built-in height and totally against any physic’s law. They called it The Burrow. Turn out he didn’t have anything to worry about. As Hermione told him afterwards, Harry gave everyone a lecture about him, he told them he gave up on killing Dumbledore and that he deserved the benefit of the doubt. Not all of the adults agreed but then Harry became stone-cold and gently told them that could either leave Draco alone or defeat the Voldemort themselves.
The only mission in his life was the one others choosed for him: kill Voldemort and save the world. Now he had his own mission: he would kill Voldemort so he could have his life with Draco.
Three weeks later, Draco had a lingering sensation as he wore the travelling cloak. Harry was making a last-minute check to be sure they didn’t forget anything
“You okay?” Harry covered his body, pinning him down. There was nothing sexual in the gesture, he had the pressuring instinct to comfort the omega.
“It should be okay, what do you think?” He turned trying to sound natural, but of course, he had to stumble on thin air in a movie-like sequence.
“Of course I mean the wedding! This is an error, people should focus on fighting not on picking up clothes for this stupid formality, I love Bill I will still love him, after all of this!”
Draco shouted when he took hold of his prick stroking him until he was close again, then the alpha stopped. Draco protested but Harry took his wrists bringing them up.
The sound of him grunting into his hear was so lewd it did things to him. Probably it was the thought that Harry was in that state because of him.
He looked like he wanted to eat him and Draco didn’t feel like he would stop him if he did so. Harry vanished their clothes, just like that with an abrupt wave of the head and grunt. Draco loved him like that, reduced to his primal instinct to claim his omega.
Harry helped him on his feet and walked him inside. There were people talking and screaming around him, he vaguely recalls someone pointing a finger at him but Harry growled back.
Harry's hand left his ass and took place on the small of his back, rubbing a slow calming circles there.
It was quicker than their lazy, languid sex of earlier in the morning. It was shaded with a different feel, of playfulness, and as always, the all-consuming possessiveness of Harry. Draco bit at the bottom of Harry’s lips, hard enough to draw blood and the alpha groaned into his mouth as he licked it away. He let out a moan and arched back as they writhed back and forth, erections bumping, brushing and grinding against each other.
Draco meawled, he wasn’t used to be wanted so much, everything in Harry was intense; from the mouth reclaiming his, to the finger, which was making his way inside his body.
He almost chuckled at the though snuggling in Draco’s neck as the omega slowly slipped into sleeping.
He groaned when Harry took one between his lips and suckled hard, pulling the flesh deep into his mouth, swirling his tongue around, raking his teeth over it. The smaller man shook and shuddered from Harry's ministrations, his body on fire already.
It was soft and slow. The alpha get into it right away, they had been parted too long and they both craved closeness. The kiss was followed by another one than a smaller one and soon enough they were just resting so close that their lips brushed as Draco speak.
This was pretty new for him as well. Harry's never really been with anyone who wanted so much. He hadn’t been with anyone, period.
Draco was gone, completely out, Harry hold him close enjoying the comforting sensation of their new bond. His alpha was pumped with pride for knotting his omega that now was safe and warm in their nest.
Draco said something but it went lost in his moans, he wanted to make some sort of sarcastic remake; but Harry made it impossible still sucking hickeys against the thin skin of his collarbone, not with the way his other hand was now firm on Draco's ass, guiding him in a rhythm, fast bouncing on his erection.
Being buried knot-deep inside Draco forced him to lessen his movements to a slower rutting, a small winding of his hips that made the bulbous knot to soothe back and forth against wrecked prostate.
The omega screamed, his prostate being landed at every thrust, his body still sensitive from the orgasm.
After the scream went away he was made lying on a small bed, much different of his usual king bed in the dungeons but much more comfortable, he could smell Harry everywhere and he slipped into a deep sleep.
One night, lying on his bed, he decided he wanted to be that kind of omega. The heart of the house, caring for everyone even when they didn’t care for themselves, not the baby-maker his father saw in them.
“At the end of our fourth year Hermione presented as an alpha, I knew from the moment I smelt her she was meant to be my mate, everything suddenly made sense. I’m not saying you should live in function of founding and alpha, but just that being an omega is not something you can control, and you shouldn’t make your life revolve around your genre.”
“Do you need help?” A deep voice said; Harry was there. He gave a nod, his voice suddenly gone. He didn’t turn. Lately, he had been feeling self-conscious near Harry. Maybe it was due to the fact he finally had his heat, but suddenly he felt like he was burning near the other guy.
When Draco finished again, moaning weakly, his hips moving in small little circles in time with Harry’s thrusts, Harry flipped him, swinging Draco’s leg around as he put Draco onto his back. The omega looked at him lost, his eyes unfocused and his chest coated with come, but Harry wasn’t done. He pressed hard until his knot popped inside, swelling since he already had one orgasm he didn’t come right away and he could play with the omega body a little. One of his favorite activities.
It felt really fucking big. His fists bunched in the blanket at the not-quite-pain of Harry bottoming down inside. It took forever and the pain was already been fading into pleasure.
One evening they had an official dinner organised by the Minister of magic. Draco didn’t even remember the occasion, they usually restrained from going out in public but Harry bailed him saying that all of their friends were going. He also bought him a beautiful dress and in the end, the blond really enjoyed the evening.
Harry’s hand trailed his side until the leg which he grasped and lift. Now his cock was pressing on hid the loose hole and Draco pushed back. Harry grunted his approval leaving new signs on his shoulder. It felt big as the first time. Draco arched to facilitate the penetration but it took forever for Harry to bottom down.
The night was the hardest part. There was nothing distracting him to the thought of Harry with someone else, while sleeping he saw him in his dreams mated to someone else, maybe a nice small girl which was more photogenic and loved to the public than him.
“So you enjoyed it? How much?” The amusement completely took over. Draco could physically feel Harry’s ego-inflating.
Seriously, if you are reading this story for the sweetness brace yourself because Harry's going to loosing it (also Draco will loose the big V).
The knot was swelling, Draco could feel it against his rim but Harry didn’t seem ready to push it inside.
“Oh, you do? And what do you know about love?” She stood up angry but Draco didn’t lose his composure.
Harry had been away for two weeks now, he went to the world’s congress of wizards as a guest to gave a speech about the future, he didn’t even wanted to go; but Draco told him that the decisions that they would make into this moment of transition would have shaped the future of their world.
It was also a way to knew she was okay if anything happens to her the collar would come off. It had been a reason to relief during the weeks they spent on the run.
“Oh, you do? And what do you know about love?” She stood up angry but Draco didn’t lose his composure.
“Gonna see how often I can pump you full of come before you scream enough.” Said Harry right into his ear. Giving him goosebumps. He turned his head looking for a kiss.
Harry leaned forward closing his teeth on their bond mark; he also had one now, even if it wasn’t usual for omegas to mark their alpha he pleaded Draco to do so so now they matched.
At some point, Harry took him by hand to have a dance together if Draco hadn’t been so focused on his mate probably he would have noticed how everyone was murmuring looking in their direction and how all of the other couples slowly left the dance-floor. The music stopped and Harry smiled at him, before going down on one knee and ask him to became his husband. Just afterwards he realized that all of the most influential people converged in the luxury location that the Ministry booked for the evening because of them. Harry gathered the top of the wizarding world as a witness of his proposal.
The first time they had sex it was right after their first kiss, it wasn’t planned but it didn’t make it any less perfect. They had been dancing around each other for weeks. They were on the run and they lived in a small tent at the moment, so there weren’t many possibilities to avoid each other. It didn’t help that Ron’ heat was near and it was triggering Draco’s. The last drop was the visit to Luna’s father. It was an ambush but they managed to escape, unfortunately, a curse hit Draco, nothing serious, he shield away most of it but some sparkles touched his arm giving him a sense of burn, Draco couldn’t help but let out distress smell. Harry went wild. He forgot about magic and punched the culprit in the face, he let go of him just when Draco pleaded him. He grabbed him and apparated both of them away. Draco blinked looking around confused. It was some sort of house, the wood from walls was crackled and the was a strong ocean noise coming from outside.
He had been living on borrowed clothes since his escape, Mrs Weasley collected old clothes from her sons and cleaned them with magic, but they were still someone else's.
The alpha kept cumming for a long time. He could feel his omega happiness irradiating from the body under him. In the end, he curled around him, his knot still sitting deep in the blond’s body, little spurts of cum still coming out occasionally. The rut would come back but for the moment the sleep took them.
Harry collapsed on him, covering him with his weight, it was so calming having him that close licking the wound he left on his neck. The heat was almost gone and they didn’t stay tied long, but Harry made the best out of it kissing him deep and showering him with praises. Draco had a weakness for being told how good and perfect he was and his alpha knew it.
Draco wrapped his arms around a pillow and waited for him to finish in the bathroom. He can feel himself starting to step further into sleep relaxing under the warm blanket Harry distended on him. With a tiny smile he settled more deeply into the mattress looking lovingly the alpha, as he walked back to the bed, Harry slid under the covers spreading an arm over him and pressing his nose into his hair.
“Ah…stop! I wish your brain was big as yours…” he stopped a second before saying something irreversible but Harry wasn’t having it.
He half-collapses against Harry's chest, breathing heavily and pressing light kisses to any skin within reach looking blindly for his mouth. He mewled as he found it, letting Harry devour him.
-This is it- he thought. He was going to die there, with a hospital gown which left his butt exposed. But then a new figure entered the room and Harry’s smell saturated the air.
Draco leaned back making a show of his body, using the coffee table as a handle while he inches up and down Harry's cock in slow, smooth motions. His white skin now is heavily stained with hickeys, it looks like a map of their love-making. That morning Draco woke up at Harry’s lips renewing the marks which were starting to fade.
“You are the chosen one, of course they need you, and not because you destroyed You-Know-Who, but because they know that they can rely on you. You were the reason because they didn’t lost hope. Even when the ministry failed them you didn’t.”
“Your back?” Garbled Draco, Harry messy hair tickling his nostrils; he couldn’t care less. He gripped to the alpha trembling.
Hermine kept her distance at the beginning, but then Ron had a discussion with her, and she came forward.
Draco didn’t. He didn’t have time for daydreaming about anything. He had some blur idea about a cute spouse who would give him an heir. But he knew that his mate would never be his own decision. He was a Malfoy, he had expectations to live up to, he was the last of a long line of alphas and his father raised him telling him he would be one.
Draco whined, his omega had been responding to Harry’s unlashed alpha making him beg to be breed. A voice, far away, tries to tell him he is not even in heat but the instinct to mate was too strong.
What the fuck, Harry’s dick was a gift to the mankind but hell if it was hard to take him with such a short preparation. Ron told him that it was also related to the mating. As soon as they bonded his body was going to recognise Harry’s, but until then he needed to bear with it.
The mark was there, red on the white skin. Harry’s sight narrowed on the bite and before he knew he was clenching his teeth on it, his knot deep inside Draco’s body as he came.
The rut completely took over and everything he could hear from Harry were growling sounds. Teeth occasionally bitting his shoulders, the nails digging into his hips. At some point, he had to twist his hands into the rug so he won't slide away from Harry 's thrusts. His legs gave away and they crushed, but the pounding didn’t stop. A hand gripped his wrist as Harry pushed his legs wider as he could.
“Harry?” The alpha groaned. The air still smelled as rut but it wasn’t strong as the day before. Probably it was a phantom rut, triggered by the thought his omega was in danger.
When his knot went down he didn’t even bother taking out, he turned Draco on his knees pounding into him.
The alpha fucked him through his second hard climax with low groans, both of them feeling it as they tied. Harry’s hips stuttered a bit, gradually slowing until he was just giving an occasional hard thrust between heavy pants. Harry’s hair was damp with sweat as he boneless sank down on Draco, he was heavy but the omega could handle it.
They went at it non stop for days, they cared so less for the outside that they even lost count of them.
The alpha came for a long time, even after their fell on the side little after orgasm kept hitting him pumping more come into the spent omega.
Draco finally felt his body orgasming when the first stripes of semen spurt out of his dick he whited out, his whole world narrowing to the place where his body was connected to Harry's.
He had been since that night on the Hogwarts’ tower. The alpha had been nothing but nice to him, he looked so honest and he was so damn Gryffindor. That’s why it would been better for everyone if Draco just disappeared.
Draco wasn’t sure to stay this close when they were on the run, by he changed his mind after Harry took him in a wild part of the north-Norway, where they rented a car to reach a small luxurious cabin deep in the forest, a place where they could forget everything but themselves.
He didn’t want to go back to that Manor that once was his home, especially after failing his mission.
As Draco tensed and Harry’s alpha squirmed. He wanted nothing more than knot the omega and claim him but not if that meant hurting him. The brunette kissed his nape gently.
Draco woke up to the sensations of a hot mouth closing on his lobe. A wet tongue lap the area beneath, trying to slip under his collar, no that there was any chance, magic glued it to his skin. Lips came in tracing his neck.
Draco tensed a little but then let go, he was going to tell Harry sooner o later bet get over with it. His paranoias were gone the moment he realised the alpha was back as always.
Draco was always so perfect around him, even when he was so loose due to all of the fucking they have been doing in the past days. The blond groaned softly, pushing back when Harry pressed forward. He loved him slowly, caressing him with his hands and his lips. He sucked new marks around Draco’s neck, already covered in purple spots, he gave special attention to their mate bite. He always did, even when they were in public he loved putting his hand on it to remind Draco and all of the world to who he belonged and Draco loved every second of it.
“Ehy.” Both of their voices sounded rasping for the screaming. “You okay?” He sounded hesitant and Draco stressed out. Everything happened so fast that he didn’t spend a thought about the ‘after’.
His pace fastened. His knot already forming. He left Draco’s lips descending on his neck and then on his chest until he found a swollen nipple, they were so sensitive that Draco swear, Harry wouldn’t leave them alone lately, as if he thought that Draco was going to start milking.
They went for a flight, later in the morning, it had been Harry’s idea and it was amazing. A warm spell shielded them from the cold and they could enjoy the enchanting landscape of Sweden. Even with the spell, they came back after one hour, running out of breath. They were famishing so they made some toast, the mood was light, Draco hugged Harry from behind as he prepared the food and the alpha pushed him sat on the counter don’t bother reaching the table to eat. They end up making a mess kissing between one bite and another. And by the end of the lunch, Draco was hard because a hand had been palming his cock through the clothes over the last sandwich.
He didn’t go for his cock this time, he pressed to fingers behind his balls, teasing his prostate from outside, grinding his knot against from the inside. Draco trashed under him screaming incoherently as something big and devastating built inside him. He was almost scared by the pleasure. His legs went numb as the sensation grew.
“Mine.” He said. More of a groan, or a whisper, than an actual word, but it was burning into Harry's brain. He opened his mouth and swallowed the throbbing erection of his mate down his throat, feeling the slide and glide of hot, sweet skin against his own heat.  The shaft rubbing against his lips and tongue, fitting into his throat was silky smooth, but not. He sucked Draco hard, bobbing his head and pressing down to his throat, two fingers pressing hard on the sensitive bundle inside his ass until Draco came with a scream.
Remus uncovered his eyes after a few seconds, and seeing that Sirius was now firmly back on the ground, he jumped up happily and started to run after the motorcycle himself. Now that he saw the motorbike, his annoyance had been replaced by excitement. This would be fun! Remus kept pace with Sirius easily and both dogs barked as loudly and ferociously as they could. No one should be out near their farm this time of night and it was their job to ensure that everyone who drove by knew that. Lucius hadn’t registered the sound of the dogs until he saw them standing in front of a small bridge he had been planning to drive over. His hair flew out of his ponytail as he tried to brake, but to no avail. Instead, face showing his terror once more, Lucius swerved to avoid the dogs.
Their last full day of vacation greeted them with sunny skies and the smell of the ocean on the breeze.  Harry and Draco got ready quickly, wanting to spend as much time as possible at the beautiful waterfall. Draco packed some food and water for them once he got dressed and Harry had made some quick breakfast burritos for them to eat on their walk. Soon they were on their way to the waterfall, walking hand in hand as they did so. Draco skipped a little as he finished his burrito, swinging their hands lovingly. Harry chuckled at his adorable boyfriend, grateful to have the blond in his life. Harry swung his hand in time with Draco’s trying to keep up as he finished his own breakfast. Draco chuckled as Harry nearly tripped with the speed increase, and pulled the dark-haired man into his arms to keep Harry from falling. Both men relaxed into the hug while they looked around, the waterfall had to be nearby, they could hear it, and yet neither man could see it.
Sirius, a long and lanky brown dog with a black nose and ears, was sleeping under a wheelbarrow outside on the farm. One of his floppy ears lifted up at a sound in the distance. He was a guard dog after all, so all new, unfamiliar noises needed to be investigated and approved by him. As the sound got closer, he wearily opened one eye, then both, lifting  his head as the engine popped loudly again. Sirius attempted to stretch and sit up, but forgot where he was sleeping and hit his head and back on the bottom of the wheelbarrow.
