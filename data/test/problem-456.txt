“You idiot, he’s tricking you!”
By the time the panic had ebbed, Harry’s fingers and toes were wrinkled, the shower pressure was fast decreasing, and he could no longer feel the cold. Briefly he wondered if a prolonged cold shower could cause hypothermia. But the thought was short lived as he walked out into the hall in search of a towel.
The war with Voldemort had made victims of them all, and Harry and Draco were not on opposing sides. Not anymore.
Harry smiled, “Certainly not me. I assumed you’d hate me ‘til the day you died.”
Ron eyed Harry with suspicion as he finally swallowed the last of his toast, wiping away the remaining butter and crumbs on his sleeve. “You’ve been acting really weird lately. Always telling me that you’re busy, but you never go out anywhere, and now this? What’s going on mate?”
“Yes, I remember,” Draco said quietly before a much larger smile crossed his face, “In fact, the bathroom is a little unforgettable, wouldn’t you agree?”
“I don’t want to go back to the Manor tonight.”
“This wasn’t always your home you know.”
Slowly it dawned on Harry that Draco’s mother had been Sirius’ cousin, no doubt the family would have visited Grimmauld Place on occasion. He nodded slowly in understanding, pulling open a cupboard and taking down two mugs and a small pot of sugar before making his way to the fridge for the milk.
In a last-ditch effort to preserve what little was left of his dignity, Draco snatched up the pillow he was leaning against and held it in front of himself as he climbed out of the bed. “I just noticed that his pillow is more comfortable than my one, so I’m going to take this one to sleep on,” he said, making a quick exit from the room.
Harry sighed and settled back down in his seat, finally taking a few sips of his tea, noting the untouched cup on the other side of the table that he had been thanked for. Although, he supposed, the thanks was never truly intended for the beverage.
Draco looked furious, his fists clenching tighter. “Fine,” he hissed, marching past Harry and directly to the kitchen, withdrawing his wand from the inside pocket of his blazer and whipping the kettle into action on the stove.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean-”
Harry pointed to a small wardrobe in the corner on the room. “There’s a few shirts and things in there if you want something to sleep in, and the bathroom is just down the hall.”
Draco shuffled along the sofa to punch Harry’s arm. “Shut up. Where am I sleeping then?”
Draco looked thoughtful for a moment and slowly rose to his feet, pacing across the kitchen floor and peering out of the window. “I thought for sure you would have moved Weasley into this place.”
“I’ve had a lot of time on my hands since I moved in,” Harry said quietly, absently scratching at the back of his neck.
Harry woke late the next day, sunlight blazing through the thin curtains on his bedroom, but he made no effort to get out of bed. What would be the point? Yet another day of dusting and staring into space, coupled with the new, crushing disappointment of the night before.
Harry watched silently as his owl Petra took flight against the pale sky, barely touched by the rising sun. There was no going back now. He only hoped that Draco would take him up on his offer.
“Well, the death toll stacked up pretty fast the last few years. I guess I feel… responsible. Voldemort’s end-game was killing
There was no denying that the interaction had been a strange one, but was it really? After all, Harry would be lying if he said he wasn’t suffering from a terrible sense of melancholy since he had left the Hogwarts grounds all those months ago, not realising back then that it would be the last time he would set foot there.
Draco’s brow furrowed. “I don’t know what that means. Is that a muggle thing?”
“How wrong you were,” Draco muttered.
“What?” Harry asked in a panic, fully aware of how he must look, hoping beyond hope that Draco wouldn’t mention it.
He let his eyes fall closed, envisioning the exposed flesh of Draco’s clavicle, where the oversized shirt he had worn to bed had slipped down in a ridiculously sensual fashion, partially leaned over the bed, concerned eyes fixed on Harry’s own in the soft glow of the wand light.
Unfortunately for Draco, just as these slithers of thought started to crack the surface, they morphed into something more. Sitting next to Harry, tucked under the lemon and green duvet, shoulder to shoulder. In his mind he could feel the heat of it against his arm, his ribs, his hip… and then the heat rose somewhere entirely different and Draco realised to his horror, that not only had they been sitting there in full silence while his strange fantasy had played out, but Harry was now watching his face with curiosity and he was entirely unable to walk out of the room without Harry noticing what had happened.
Harry stood frozen to the spot as Draco walked away. So many emotions hit him at once he hardly knew which one to deal with first. Draco was here, he had actually come. But, he had also seen Harry naked as the day he was born. And finally, thankfully, he had turned his back just seconds before ‘little Harry’ had rejoined the party.
Harry smiled, the company of his best friend was long overdue and always deeply grounding, helping himself to food was always expected of Ron, and Harry always picked up extra when he knew the red head would be coming by. “How’s the family?”
“No! No, I didn’t mean like that. I meant that I’ve had someone coming over to see me is all. It’s been sort of therapeutic,” he finished, knowing exactly what Ron would say before he said it.
Yes. Just for body warmth.
Draco flushed pink. “I’m fine, and you’re avoiding the question.”
Harry shook his head. “I offered him, of course, but his mum was so cut up about Fred, I don’t think he had the heart to leave her yet.”
Draco eyed him with suspicion. “Why?”
Draco’s quickly relayed the conversation and Harry sat quietly, taking it in and trying to adopt Narcissa’s way of thinking. It was no secret that the woman, though high and mighty, lived for her only son, a love like that would be hard to topple.
Harry’s orgasm hit hard and fast with Draco’s name on lips and he rode out the aftershock. Panting, his head dropped back onto the pillow, a little regret forming as he wished he at least removed the duvet to lessen the clean-up.
Draco settled at the table again, finishing his tea and settling the cup gently down again. “Who’d have thought we would end up like this?”
Something about sitting at the kitchen table in Grimmauld Place gave him a sense of security. That he could say whatever he wanted, and it wouldn’t matter: like it absorbed into the walls around him and went no further. Not like when he was at home, where every word was carefully placed lest it reach the wrong ears.
Rising slowly from his seat at the kitchen table, Harry began to wonder who would be calling at such an hour. It was almost half past eleven in the evening, a most unlikely hour for visitors to arrive unannounced. Of course, it wasn’t unusual for Ron to visit in the evenings, but it was always arranged beforehand and rarely so late.
“Goodnight… Harry.”
“I shall endeavour to keep my pants on for you then, goodnight Draco.”
Harry wasn’t sure what to say. He had never seen Draco get flustered like this, and certainly never heard him say ‘uh’. Draco had two speeds: talking and not talking, never anything as slow and unsure as the quite obvious lie he had just uttered.
Harry stepped forward, grabbing Ron’s shoulders with both hands. “It doesn’t have to be just me you know. You could give him a chance and find out for yourself.”
“What, like a girlfriend?” Ron asked, shock evident in his tone. Harry was quickly off the table again, waving his arms around as he realised the mistake in his wording.
In the wake of Draco’s departure, Harry had to admit he was a little disappointed that their conversation, no matter how disconcerting and one-sided it had been, was over so quickly.
Draco fell silent, picking mindlessly at the now cold toast on the table in front of him, but failing to actually eat any of it. Harry set the tea down in front of him, opting for the slightly bold move of placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Tell her how you feel. That you want something more. If it all goes sour, there’s more than enough room for you here until it blows over.”
Draco pushed the plate back across the table to Harry. “Perhaps next time. For now, I need to get a move on, I have a dinner to attend,” he said with a smile, drinking the slightly too hot tea with a new determination. No matter what happened tonight, one thing was certain: he wouldn’t be all alone in the word. At least one person, would still care.
Harry tipped over the edge at that thought, coming harder than he thought he ever had before flopping back onto the bed.
The admission came as more of a whisper and Draco’s eyes dropped from the table to his lap, a pink hue creeping up his neck and across his cheeks as he spoke. “I was… jealous.”
The words clicked into place as Draco said them. “It was the same for you, wasn’t it? But it wasn’t me you were aligned with.”
“You remember when Cedric Diggory died?”
Draco shook the thought from his head. Thinking about the day his father was sentenced made his insides hurt.
“I paced around outside the house a bit but couldn’t go in. I left a message with the elf that I’d be home in the morning,” Draco’s cheeks turned a little pink. “That is, if you don’t mind me taking you up on what you said earlier.”
Draco’s propped up the wall of the upstairs corridor, one eyebrow raised and the twitch of a smirk on his face. “I was beginning to wonder if you’d drowned in there,” Draco nodded in the general direction of Harry’s crotch. “I imagine if you spill tea on that it would be unpleasant. I’ll wait in the kitchen.”
Draco flinched at the memory, but still he said nothing. “All you ever cared about was your family, you loved them too much to refuse their wishes. In summary,” Harry swept on, determined to finish, “I think that you’re angry at yourself for the way you acted and you’re trying to push it back on me because it’s easy and familiar and nothing about the past six months has been anything of the sort.”
Harry had assumed Draco would laugh, but he was quiet, fidgeting with the handle on his empty cup. Harry watched him for a few more seconds before speaking again. “If you’ve got something you want to say Draco, just say it. We’re not kids anymore.”
“We could have been friends, you know. When I first met you in Diagon Alley, when you weren’t showing off for all your Slytherin friends, I thought you were pretty cool.”
“You wish you hadn’t lived that night.”
“But you’re angry.”
Harry smiled in spite of himself. “Tuck your legs under the covers, you must be freezing.”
Folding his clothes neatly on top of the bedside table, Draco opened the wardrobe and found an oversized white t-shirt, marvelling at the fact that it was on a hanger and even appeared to have been ironed. Harry really did have too much time on his hands. Pulling it over his head, Draco regarded himself in the mirror mounted to the wardrobe door. He was thinner that he had been, not that there was ever much weight on him to begin with, making the t-shirt all the looser on his narrowed frame.
Draco hovered in the doorway of one room that had ocean blue walls and a white bedspread, topped with a royal blue blanket. Pine furniture sat about the place, the tops and handles of each painted white. Draco was drawn to it, the room somehow felt like standing on a beach and breathing the fresh air.
Harry shrugged. “I was only close with Ron and Hermione. Ron is with his family and Hermione back at school, guess it's a little hard to trust people these days.”
Draco sat quietly at the foot of his bed, slowly mulling over the events of the past few weeks. He had visited Harry almost every day since that first night. Odd to think that after being overwhelmed by his anger and self-hatred that it had led to something that could loosely be called a friendship.
Draco was taken aback by the answer. “That was years ago! You’ve been dealing with this for
Harry smiled widely. “Well, it’s not exactly Malfoy Manor, but it’s a long way from living in a cardboard box. Does it really still surprise you that I find you tolerable?” Harry joked, giving Draco’s shoulder a squeeze before releasing it.
At this point, Arthur had cast a glance at Draco across the court, his eyes full of sadness. Though Draco had never seen the Weasley family as anything more than blood traitors, he realised what Arthur was trying to convey with that look some days later after careful thought; Lucius had to be punished for his crimes, but Arthur was burdened heavily by the fact that it would mean tearing a family apart when so much had already been lost on all sides.
Harry smiled a little. “Well, what will she do if she is? It’s not as if she’s going to ground you.”
Ron’s face was as red as his hair, practically steaming with anger. “And why does that person always have to be you?”
“Why don’t you use magic?” Draco asked, his tone a little less highly strung than it had been moments earlier, watching Harry’s movements around the room with bemused curiosity.
As he closed his eyes and sleep tugging at his consciousness, a final thought filtered through his brain. ‘I shall endeavour to keep my pants on for you then’ Harry had said, and for the smallest of moments Draco wondered if, just perhaps, that wasn’t what he wanted, before he gave way to a deep and dreamless sleep.
You know where to find me.
That night he sat quietly at the kitchen table, trying his best not to stare at the clock as the minutes ticked away, two cups already laid out on the kitchen counter in anticipation. But ten became eleven, then eleven became twelves and finally, when the clock struck one Harry sighed in disappointment, putting out the lights with a quick swish of his wand and wandering quietly upstairs to bed.
When he and Ron had made the decision not to return to school, it seemed like the right choice. There didn’t seem to be anything on paper or in the minds of their teachers that could make them more than what they had become, and the last thing he wanted was for people to be hailing him as a hero every minute of the day: but was the reclusive life he had chosen really any better?
Draco froze immediately. He had gotten so used to saying whatever he wanted at the kitchen table that he had allowed that part of himself to leak out. “Sorry, mother. That was rude of me.”
“Only to say that I might go out again for a while.”
“Well, that depends,” Draco said thoughtfully, “You didn’t answer my question.” He fidgeted with the pillow a little, trying to make it cover both of his long legs rather unsuccessfully.
“It wasn’t your fault you know,” Draco said softly, pulling Harry from his negative spiral. “Everyone was just trying to find a way to put a stop to their own suffering. They were fighting for themselves and what they believed in. Ultimately, they wanted to defend you, and everything you stood for, because it’s what they believed themselves.”
“I lived with muggles for ten years, some habits are hard to break,” Harry responded with a shrug. “Sugar?”
The Manor felt different with his father gone though, less oppressive somehow. Not that his father was ever overtly cruel to him, but there was a standard that needed to be met and often times it was a burden to Draco that he didn’t feel he quite lived up to expectations.
“Do we have a winner?” Harry asked gently as Draco wandered inside, long fingers dragging along the plump duvet before he sat at the foot of it and smiled, nodding.
He found an easy rhythm, squeezing the shaft as hard as he dared, panting frantically as he felt the flush creeping up his neck, lost entirely in the sensation with his mind, shamefully, trained on memory of Draco leaned against the wall, seeing him naked, looking down at his cock…
“Tea and toast actually.”
“Well for the past nineteen years she has been making them MY values. I feel like I’ve turned on her,” Draco said sadly, dropping the piece of toast he had been holding back onto the plate.
Embarrassment struck Harry as he realised that the cups he had laid out the night before must have still been sitting there when Draco entered the kitchen. “Wait, how did you get in?” Harry asked, his mind finally clear enough to realise that Draco had just walked into his house without his knowledge.
Harry laughed, sometimes Draco’s ignorance was utterly endearing. “No, loads of kids get grounded. It’s when your parents don’t let you go out, or stop you doing things you enjoy. It’s a kind of punishment: like child imprisonment, but in your own home.”
Harry closed the door softly behind himself and Draco listened as his footsteps faded away down the hall. He wasn’t sure why using Harry’s name had felt like such a big deal, perhaps it was the familiarity of it all, he wasn’t sure he’d ever used a first name when speaking to anyone except Pansy, but even that was only because she absolutely insisted upon it, he never liked doing it.
“To be fair, you did once almost kill me in the boys bathroom. I’m entitled to be suspicious.”
Harry had spent more than enough time being schooled by Hermione on the emotions of others, and while the child in him enjoyed Draco’s discomfort, the war-weary adult he had become saw no point in drawing things out. “Well, I may be wrong in everything that I’m about to say, but let me take a shot at it,” Harry began, wrapping his hands around his own mug, comforted by the warmth that spread through his chilled fingertips. “I don’t think you were ever fully committed to Voldemort. That much seemed the clear to me that day at the Manor when you claimed you didn’t know for sure it was me the snatchers had brought in.”
Draco nodded. “I get it, you know. So much happened, we were hardly going to all join hands and skip off into the sunset just because he was defeated.”
“How did you…” Harry started, but Draco cut him off.
Harry nodded silently. It was already hard enough to lose someone you loved, he couldn’t begin to imagine how much worse that feeling must be if that person was your twin, or worse still, your child. He shook away the thought, he still hadn’t quite reconciled Fred’s loss himself. “Any news from Hermione?”
Harry nodded and a warmth flooded him, Draco had just perfectly articulated the exact thing he had been trying to explain to Ron for weeks. “I should be happy that it’s all over. Focus on all the positives,” he shifted in his chair, staring into his mug. “I was supposed to live here with Sirius, when it was all over. I was supposed to finally have a family.”
He craned his neck, only to see a thin silver shackle encircling his foot and chaining it safely to the metallic grid at the foot of the bed. Harry screamed with fury and disappointment and threw himself forward, shackle notwithstanding. It cut into his ankle like an axe, but he ignored the pain. His nails cut skin and his fingertips touched wood for one fleeting instant before Malfoy managed to yank his wand away, deep gauges marring his wrist. An ugly grimace reshaped his features when he saw his blood.
Harry had heard Remus's story about Voldemort organising the werewolves, and had seen Greyback taunting Dumbledore on the tower as if he had nothing at all to fear from the man Voldemort himself was scared of. The last thing Harry wanted was going wand to claw with a monster like Greyback. Truth be told, the thought of werewolves had terrified him ever since that night Professor Lupin had come after them in the woods.
It shouldn't surprise him, Harry knew, not after the Department of Mysteries, but it still carried a sting - being Voldemort's personal target had given him a twisted kind of protection. But to meet death at Draco Malfoy's hands was... well, beyond unimaginable.
"But I want to," Malfoy pouted. "You mean your domesticated Lupin never let you see his true face when the full moon came round?"
Malfoy leaned down until his face was right above Harry's and slipped his fingers into the collar of Harry's shirt. Purposefully, he started ripping off the buttons one after the other, without the slightest effort. His eyes never once left Harry's own. Harry marshalled all his strength and struggled against the paralysing charm. His fingers managed to twitch, a little.
Each and every one of his senses was protesting against returning to life as Harry swam out of unconsciousness. His head pounded so badly that breathing alone almost made his stomach turn. A white-hot needle seemed to be stabbing through his temple. His left hand was one big bruise, and when he tried to move it, he realised that he couldn't. He tensed, but to no avail - his limbs were as heavy as if they had been transfigured into lead. He thought he might be able to lift his eyelids, but the effort would probably make his head explode.
Harry preceded him to the door, ducking between Zabini and Parkinson, who brought up the rear behind Crabbe and Goyle. Without a word they escorted Harry to the sixth year dormitory, losing Pansy in front of the entrance to the girls' dormitories before coming to a halt at the portrait entrance under the painted frown of a wand-brandishing Salazar Slytherin. The portrait didn't comment as they entered.
The locket. A dry sting pricked Harry's eyes. Poor Dung - he'd had no idea that the trinkets he'd stolen would be bought with his life.
Multi-coloured leaves crackled under Harry's feet as he strolled through the outskirts of Hogsmeade, the hood of his cloak pulled up to shield his face and scar from the curiosity of passers-by. There weren't many; not this late in the afternoon, not in these times.
He slid his hand down Harry's torso, and Harry could feel its warmth and a scrape of nail where Malfoy's thumb ran over his nipple. It tightened into a terrified little nub, and Harry bit his tongue to swallow his protest. It wasn't so bad, really, compared to the Cruciatus Curse. Only when Malfoy slipped below his navel and began to toy with the button of Harry's old jeans - the ones Dudley had grown out of at twelve - he squirmed. Malfoy grinned wolfishly and caught Harry's wrists, pinning them above his head with one hand. Harry could feel the inhuman strength of his grip, the way his bones shifted under those long fingers, and knew Malfoy could probably snap both his wrists with a little more pressure.
"You're going to kill me? You couldn't even murder Dumbledore on the tower."
Of course there were scrapes and scratches all over his body, but if Malfoy had intended to infect him, he could have - would have, Harry thought - left obvious marks like those he wore himself, not disguised his handiwork with an invisible nick somewhere. The thought left him breathing a little easier.
Harriet shook her head, eyes still firmly closed as Madam Pomfrey took the cloth from her face.
"Yes! And then when he tried to fight back, Monica Danvers, you know the Gryffindor? She hexed him halfway to Sunday."
Harry's bright, teasing face dropped, as she sat up. It tensed into something that looked almost like anger, distrustful and sour, "No."
Hermione screamed, "It's trying to get back inside!" pulled out her wand and shouted, "Obice!"
"Charming child. He's already taken a shining to one of the muggleborns from the south, Ji-hyun. The spit fire."
Bang!
Draco crossed her arms looking rather proud and smug, "She's obviously powerful. Even without all the defeating the Dark Lord business."
There was screaming and chaos by most of the students, particularly the Gryffindor boys, the headmaster and teachers enforced order and delegated prefects to lead students back to their dorms.
Draco put her chin in her hand, "You're not wrong. But still. How utterly stupid. To be scared about being such a person. I know that...what did you call it?"
Harriet rolled her eyes, "Ugh. Why didn't someone give you a new personality for Christmas? You could use it."
Harry said with particular pride and enthusiasm, which normally would have Draco practically glowing, especially in front of her father, "Draco's such a good flyer already. Hopefully she can knock Higgs out of the Seeker spot. Plus it'd be more fun playing with Draco. Two birds, one stone, you know?"
Parvati said, "Accidental magic is usually tied with strong emotions, and generally either simple spells or something very personal in its more complex. My first accidental magic was when Padma got lost and everyone was worried and upset. I knew where she was and able to give my parents direction. The equivalent of a direct-me spell, though tied to a person, my twin, rather than a location."
Harriet scoffed, "She deserves a punch in the face." Maybe it wasn't a bad thing Harriet was famous, because it gave her more than enough leverage to not lose an ounce of sleep over how rich and powerful that bitch was. Fuck her and fuck any other bully out there. She absolutely deserved a punch in the face.
Yes, Mother Teresa is a controversial figure, but this is the early 90s...Harry doesn't know better.
Harry snorted to herself, "So pretentious."
Parvati lifted her wand, definitely no longer calm, "W-win-. Wi-. Win-. Wingardium Leviosa!" And the troll's massive club lifted in the air. The troll itself grunted in frustration, and tried to grab it back, while Parvati waved her wand floating it out of it's reach. "Now what?!"
Hermione argued, "But that would be too obvious and you'd get into trouble straight away. Harriet, you have only just managed to get off of Professor Snape's bad side."
"Would you like a scourgify too?" Hermione offered tentatively to Malfoy.
"Well, I do admit, that remains to be seen. It did seem part of it broke, but wasn't completely destroyed. My initial thoughts were that it could be repaired."
Parvati interrupted Lavender, "The Wizarding prison for serious criminals. But we're getting off topic. Draco Malfoy has more money and influence than most. Not many would dare to cross her. If she wants something, she nearly always gets it."
The two officials saw Harry and Draco, taking a few seconds to figure them out, looking them both up and down, before the Auror said, "Are you Harry Potter?"
Harry nodded, "I heard from Ron he has a sister."
(See the end of the chapter for
The raw and open feeling shifted inside of Harriet to amusement. She was successful at keeping her laugh tucked inside so as not to wake Draco, but it hadn't been a sure thing. Absorbing the picture Draco made: all smushed, mouth open, and quietly snoring, Harriet couldn't help but feel a bit more affection for her. Despite their rough start, Harriet truly appreciated and cared for the girl. It didn't stop her from being a pompous prick nearly all the time. Nearly, as obviously sleepy Draco was less than dignified. She really wished she had a camera. Anytime she was acting particularly prissy, Harriet could remember this moment.
Bang!
Harriet started rooting through her chest, and Hermione sat up too, removing the cucumbers purposefully, and helped her look.
Draco hit her harder.
"Why would I want to know a bully?!"
Hermione hushed her fiercely, seeing the troll far down the hallway dragging a club half the size of Harriet's body. It stumbled along, looking around bemused, as if it had been magically transported to a foreign land taking in the confusing scenery. It stumbled through a door and out of sight, and the girls all took a rather smelly breath of relief.
"Your grandmother was Muslim," and Draco added pointedly at Parvati, "not Hindu. So you can't have her for Yule!"
"Of coursssse," Matilda yawned again, "She livessss here at Hogwartsssss. In the catacombssssss."
"Bitch."
Harriet shrugged, "Annoyed? I dunno. I thought it might be funny. I kind of felt bad for the python. Nothing too crazy."
"They're brilliant! All my friends. Milly is the best with magical creatures, and Pansy and Lavender together practically know absolutely everything happening inside Hogwarts, and Parvati is like...this soothing force? She could probably calm an angry tiger. And Hermione of course is the smartest person I know. And Draco is wonderful! She's clever and loyal and kind in her weird sort of way!" Harry glared, as if in expectation of some form of rebuke.
adults you like?"
Draco waved her hand flippant, "Some pureblood lines took on protestantism, though most still follow pagan customs. To be fair, it's more cultural custom than religion, which is probably why your grandparents worked."
Draco just hissed in his direction mockingly.
They pondered a bit before Parvati suggested, "What if someone else dumped it on her. Peeves maybe."
"Which is why she should experience a proper Yule!" Draco really was insistent.
"Oh yes. They stain everything a pink color. Probably your best choice."
"Is this okay?" Parvati asked.
Neville said, "See ya, Harry."
Pansy said, "I also heard something else," she hesitated a bit, "Dumbledore is also planning to attend."
"Béchamel is one of the foundations of French cuisine! And it didn't stop you from going for thirds!" In actuality, that pleased Draco very much.
Pansy started to work on her other hand, "We have already talked about this, darling. When it's your week this summer, just take her shopping."
A mousy haired freckled girl by the name of Melody Hammond introduced herself as a fifth year prefect and directed them to the tower. "If there's anything you need, feel free to reach out. I know it is all a bit much, but you will adjust soon, I'm sure. Gryffindors tend to be a friendly lot and will help out where we can. Though don't trust the boys. They're all a bunch of dunderheads as a rule."
"Take the stairway up to the girls dorms. It's divided by year, so if you need me, I'll be in the fifth year room 3."
Nicholas clicked his tongue, "Don't be comparing your hesitancy to act on Gellert as the same, nor does it give you the excuse to overact and therefore overreach in response."
Draco sneered and then shook her head. Muggles and their odd expressions. Either way, Draco got back on topic and proceeded to explain to her the Three Thoughts in detail. Thought One: Slytherin was created as a safe haven for traumatized children. Thought Two (One and a half): the muggleborn rules are obsolete and pureblood supremacy is a lie. And Thought Three: the Dark Lord is not dead. When Draco explained Though Two (One and a half) Hermione nearly burst into tears and practically jumped over the table to give her a firm and long hug, which Draco graciously tolerated the interruption. She firmly told herself that she didn't blush or enjoy the acknowledgement. Nope. Not at all.
Harry grinned wickedly and poked again.
I know it was long and a little intense. I mostly want this fic to be funny, but I also want to get a bunch of stuff out of the way so the seven of them can get to the work of taking down Voldemort and being flippant about it in the process.
The beets arrived a week before Halloween, and it was decided for maximum impact, to pull the prank when the entire school was at the feast watching.
Hermione just snorted, "People are the same everywhere. Minorities are demonized because they are unknown and other. Don't think I haven't noticed I'm only one of three muggleborn in our year, and that is even a higher percentage for the class than normal because theoretically, while the magical world wasn't having babies during the war, the muggle world was."
"By four! Out of twenty five!"
Hermione crossed her arms across her chest in a huff, "That doesn't even remotely make sense. Why wouldn't the witch just curse the teacher and not the position?"
Draco gasped. Harry had thrown around plenty of insults before, but this was the worst, "No! I did not!"
Friendship is magic.
Harriet felt she would never forget for her whole life the look on that sour face when she thanked her deeply for helping to get her on the Gryffindor team, Malfoy realizing with horror what she had done. It still made Harriet smile anytime she thought about it.
Plus I had some questions about the use of fresh rather than dried stinging kelp."
Harriet would trust her friends with her life. The rest of the world? Never. But her friends? Always. "You can tell them if you want. But
This pleased the woman as she had a wide smile before dismissing them with a short word to the twins that Harriet supposed meant "Now, go on. Shoo!"
Nicholas gave him a firm pat before they pulled away and Albus tossed his arm out with a flourish, "Welcome to Hogwarts, my old friend."
(See the end of the chapter for
McGonagall nodded and placed 3 books on the desk. Two were in aged leather, one far older in appearance than the other. A third was in a cloth binding with white flowers embroidered on it. McGonagall opened the aged leather one first.
They sat in silence again until Parvati said, "What about color?"
The mood of the girls all dropped, as if the temperature of their little space was suddenly ten degrees colder. The Gryffindors boys though, seemed to still be in their own tropical bubble.
"So it turns out Malfoy was the one that chucked something into your cauldron. Professor Snape saw there were some ingredients on her station that shouldn't be there."
Harriet closed her eyes, tucking her arms behind her head, making sure the cucumbers weren't going to fall off anytime soon. She muttered, "I just need to find a good prank."
Albus turned and gave a mischievous smile as they approached the door at the end of the corridor. He dropped the silencing and disillusionment charms, and then opened his mouth to start singing a rather sweet rendition of The Dowie Dens of Yarrow. As he opened the door with a wave of his wand, they encountered a rather impressive cerberus drowsing at Albus's lullaby. As the beast finally tucked each of its heads down to the floor, Albus waved his wand to lift a large paw off of the trap door on the floor and gave a flourishing bow without missing a note in his song.
Harry spun her broom to face her, open and expressively expectant.
Harriet tried to memorize all he could about the young man. He had a casual elegance about him, obviously pleased that day. As Harriet sat and watched the picture move, there was a moment where he frowned and swatted at a fly in his face. Harriet laughed a bit.
"But what can we do? What difference can we make? Can we truly protect her?? He's the Dark Lord!"
Harriet grinned, "Something muggle children worry about quite a bit."
Pansy picked at her nails. Draco complaining about Harry seemed to be a common thing. "Mhmm."
10 points to your house if you can identify the easter egg.
Weasley nodded pleased, "I'm sure she'll end up in Gryffindor, so I hope you'll look out for her."
"Dating?!" Draco squawked and blushed.
Draco rubbed at her own face in exasperation, "You don't understand."
Anyway.
Albus frowned a little deeper but Nicolas just tutted again, "Now now. Don't sulk." He chuckled good naturedly before continuing, "You want to use my stone to bait out Tom, but I myself would be too big to be trapped in your web. Tell me what has you so miffed, my young friend."
Hermione was sweating, and kept holding her wand at the door, "Obice! It's the barricade spell. Flick in a semicircle and visualize a barrier of some kind!"
Padma who was trailing behind, snickered, "Parvati told me you haven't spent much time around magic."
The Weasley father looked like he certainly didn't want to be there and said, "Justice shouldn't take holiday. We got a tip off that there were biting Easter eggs being distributed here. Someone's been leaving them for muggle children. It might sound like a harmless prank, but a score of kids are scared and traumatized. The Obliviator department hasn't been happy missing out on their holiday either."
"Ah, then why Slytherin?"
Draco shook her head, "No. She doesn't seem the type, plus she's been here for eons. From what it sounds like, the forest isn't her domain. It seemed like the lake was her primary territory."
"Are you experiencing one right now?"
Harriet wondered how rude it probably seemed that the others couldn't understand their conversation. She also thought about how Milly was so attuned to Matilda despite not being able to communicate in words, and maybe that was her own special form of magic. Either way, she might as well translate for the others, especially since it probably was pretty rude having conversations they couldn't partake in.
Where's the other 3/4ths of the student population??
"Yes, they do, but it's usually relatively simple. Your hair thing and the sweater would qualify, but not teleportation, nor vanishing an object and then making it reappear. That's actually very advanced magic. What were your emotions like at the zoo?"
And then the Slytherins were killed by the troll.
They laughed some more for a bit, Draco taking in the look of Harry's hair, more and more of an actual bird nest, with bits of leaves and twigs and soft white petals. She was beautiful.
Her heart skipped a beat when she realized there was a familiarity, her grandmother's graduation picture with gold ornaments in her hair as well.
"The blood magic should have protected the child, but I miscalculated. Her relatives did not nurture nor support her. She discovered I was the one that placed her, and blames me for their failings."
Hermione sighed with a sort of begrudging acceptance, "Yes. In terms of transgender being a non-issue in the magical world is wonderful. But still, people are people for better or worse, and one prejudice is being replaced by another. However we're getting off topic."
Sorry about this update taking forever and this being relatively short.
Well either way, it couldn't hurt to make talented friends, and looking further afield had been a good decision. Hell, she had wanted to make friends with Harry Potter since the day she heard the story of the toddler who defeated the Dark Lord.
Draco groaned in her typical dramatic annoyance, "Some adults suck. Hermione just figured that out last night."
Draco pointed a finger in rebuke, she really was animated in her movements once you got her going, "Ah, but why show it off? To a bunch of first years? Purposefully? Like we can't even pull up our own chairs. He wanted to intimidate us and he wants to control Harry."
Harry gave her usual wicked grin, "I'm still winning."
Draco yanked her hands out of Harry's hold, "No!" Harry couldn't understand. Draco's father was right. He deserved respect and he was just protecting the Malfoy line. Draco needed to be better.
Lavender cooed, "We were talking about trimming it up next sleepover anyway. Don't worry. We'll make you look absolutely fabulous, Hermione."
Harry then asked, "So you're related to the ones at Hogwarts? I know like...four of them? Mostly the twins cause we play Quidditch together, but Ron seems an okay sort too." She wrinkled her nose in a bit of disgust, "Sorry about Percy. No offense."
Draco looked pleased and sneered smugly, "Who says I wasn't planning on it anyways."
Draco shrugged, "Hufflepuff is last at the moment, and if Gryffindor loses, it gives us a better chance at the cup. Seems a perfectly reasonable strategy."
Still, Harry is gaining a maternal figure! Sorry, Molly. You're an awesome mom but you have enough kids.
It was two people Draco recognized as an Auror, though she couldn't identify which one, and the Weasleys' father. She concluded within a few seconds they were likely there on a ridiculous and nuisance search. People were often jealous or upset by their family and would post false reports of dark magic and artifacts. It was annoying, but others can be naturally prone to jealousy, especially at the success of others.
pretty stupid. And jealous."
"But doesn't everyone do accidental magic?"
Malfoy groaned, "Of course you'd be the precocious one. Transfiguration, and a whole closet of objects."
"Draco! Flamel wrote back!"
"So, you know how Hayworth has been messing with the twins because their mom's business banned his family because they were acting super shady?"
"Pans. I have news!"
Harriet looked at the picture of the scruffy haired boy, absorbing every detail. McGonagall turned a few pages forward and pointed at a redheaded girl quite a few years older than Harriet herself, with a prefect badge pinned to her robes, smiling proudly at a boy with a more humble smile hidden among numerous facial scars. She had eyes Harriet had seen many times when she looked in a mirror. "So you knew them well?"
Draco looked away and bit her lip. No. No, it wouldn't be perfect. Harry just squeezed her hands gently and said with a slight smile to her voice, "I thought so."
"We can't sneak into the Slytherin dorms, remember?"
"What was that dish the other day? The potatoes and peas in a beshy something?"
"I love it!" Harriet grinned.
"Next is Professor McGonagall. She's our head of house and also teaches Transfiguration. I've heard that you should never challenge her in a drinking contest, if you value your liver, and that her and Professor Snape are good friends."
"Sorry, Albus. Miss Potter was already intriguing, you've given your ringing endorsement, and she has taken the first step in contact."
Draco's mother just stood in silent expectation for a second until she was interrupted by a tug on her robe sleeve.
"What were they like?"
"And cucumber? That you like so much? Of course," she said with a slight chuckle.
"Now about Miss Potter…"
Lavender grinned wider, "The very same."
"Ah. You know me too well, old friend," a more genuine smile was back on his face, but it still was marred slightly.
Lavender nodded seriously, "So anyways. Darcy Wu punched him in the face. Like a muggle!"
Lavender said, "The hair isn't a bad target."
Harriet unfortunately had to wait to put her prank into action. They didn't have enough beets between the four of them without depleting the stores they needed for class, and had to owl order, which oddly took a long time.
Draco's felt her stomach drop out. She had tried so hard to gain Harry's trust. Why couldn't she see that her father just had high expectations. Deep disappointment filled her chest, "Harry. You don't understand."
"Fancy a game, old friend?" Albus said with a mischievous twinkle. He continued, explaining the large wizard chess set, "This is the product of my deputy headmistress: a far better person than myself, I must admit. She has been training this particular set for at least a decade."
Harry whispered, "Do you know who they are?"
As the pudding course arrived and everyone grabbed something, Harriet asked, "Do you know any of the other professors?"
Harriet grinned at the jar, imagining the sour look on Malfoy's face with her pink hair, "It's perfect, Hermione. Thanks."
Harriet had never felt beautiful before, nor had any clothes even remotely considered nice, much less beautiful. Even Harriet could tell it was too much. But much like meals with the Patils, she had learned that they were generous to the point they would get upset if she didn't seem to eat practically her weight in food. They fussed and worried and never served Harriet that one dish she couldn't pronounce with beans again, when she only took one serving, rather than going back for thirds and fourths. This was probably the same, and Harriet couldn't bear to offend these people, despite this over the top present.
I hope all the conversation wasn't too boring.
Hermione was happy to explain, "A magical carnivorous plant that thrives in cold damp places. It can be dangerous as it will wrap and entrap anything it can catch. Much like quicksand, the more you move, the more likely you'll be caught and die."
This chapter gave me so much trouble!!
It was comforting to know that Snape didn't hate Harriet per se, just her father. And she'd heard ad nauseum that she looked very much like him, outside of her eyes. Speaking of, he cared deeply for her mother? Was Professor Snape's treatment of her just really poorly handled grief? It was hard not to think that way with the sound of the sobbing man echoing "She has Lily's eyes," in her memory.
"And you haven't opened your eyes even once, dear?"
"Wouldn't the goddaughter thing be enough?" Hermione asked. Harriet was thinking much the same.
Harriet was spared from asking further, because it was obviously not
Harry snorted, turned, and poked Draco in the stomach, "So very important."
It's so much fun writing these snarky jagoffs.
She spotted Hermione setting up at their usual table. Draco figured they'd probably be working on Potions today as Uncle Sev had given them quite a bit of research required for the next class, and Hermione already had their potions work out in front of her.
Harry waved her hand dismissively. Draco recognized it as one of her own personal forms of flair and it almost warmed her heart, but she still bristled, upset about Harry's ridiculous opinion. Harry said, "Fine. Then why exactly are you a 'bad heir,' whatever the fuck that means."
Finally Hermione answered, "I have an uncle who insisted I should have only boy things, mostly clothing. I got so upset about it, and transfigured the lot into pink and purple floral dresses and jumpers and knickers and everything. Not really my style as I learned eventually, but I was just so upset and angry that it didn't matter."
Draco seemed to have caught herself and stuttered with a sour looking face, "Y-Yes! I'm still quite upset. You missed out on a perfect Yule celebration!" Her nose and the back of her neck were red and flush.
Bang! Harriet could feel some cracks in her magical barricade and closed her eyes, visualized, and strengthened it.
Harriet awoke significantly more refreshed with the sounds of the other girls starting the day. Draco was sitting up in bed looking spaced out and still half asleep, with a pillow crease imprinted to her right cheek. Harriet didn't hold back her laughter this time at the oh-so-dignified princess of Slytherin.
"N-no, Father." Merlin, she wanted to cry. But there was no use crying to Father. Crying was for the weak.
"Maybe he's trying to discover what is going on between Snape and Quirrell and your broom?" Hermione offered.
"No no. Just during DADA. I think the garlic smell is getting to me."
Parvati's mother smiled kindly and said, "Of course."
"During Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Is something wrong, Madam Pomfrey?"
To the sound of the Lavender and Parvati exiting the room, Hermione opened the curtains to Harriet's bed canopy. She looked a little strained and stressed, like she hasn't slept well, but said with a certain amount of relief, "Oh, good. You're awake. You should get ready. Lavender picked up some clothes for you from the dorms, Draco." They'd already swapped passwords with the girls, and it wasn't unusual for Lavender to hang out with Pansy alone in Slytherin as they often were required to share whatever the latest gossip was immediately, supposedly on pain of death. None of the other Slytherins would think much of Lavender entering their dorms alone and heading to the first year girls room.
Mother's smile widened slightly and then she stood up, her more genuine smile directed at Harry and Draco, "Now. Let's see about that tea. You must be famished. I know you missed lunch to attend your quidditch training. I have been assured Lisky made a few extra ham croquettes."
Draco was interrupted from further indignation by the common room door opening and Lavender spotting them and making a beeline for their settee.
"No. That was Professor Snape. I wonder why. He's never done that for me."
Harry raised her eyebrow at Draco at her father's choice of words, but then gasped and whispered to Draco, "I think I know who that is!" Her impulsive behavior struck again, practically giving Draco a coronary when she whispered, "I'm going to go ask," and then jumped around the corner before Draco could stop her.
Her father sneered, "Obviously the Potter child is a menace and you have failed to show her any goodness and civility. You failed. I am never to hear of you associating with Potter or any of her ilk again. Never."
The Nimbus 2000 arrived at McGonagall's office without incident much earlier, probably because Harriet spent quite a few galleons on the thing. Despite Harriet's appointment as Seeker being a fairly tight secret, word still got out to Malfoy. When she confronted her in one of the corridors,
You know how Fawks cries over Harry's wound? She's also super upset that her buddy had to die.
No one saw her enter, everyone was too invested in the festivities to notice a tiny girl scooting inside and plopping down with the Gryffindor first years.
"Exactly. Dumbledore believes Harriet has some power against You-Know-Who, which is fairly believable considering his disappearance after he attacked her. Dumbledore has long since made it his mission to take him down. If Harriet does have whatever this unknown power is, it would make sense he would wish to use her. Dumbledore is very much working off of the premise of You-Know-Who's continued existence. He wouldn't need her as a tool in the first place if he wasn't. As long as you believe that Dumbledore's not delusional, You-Know-Who is likely still in existence in some form or fashion."
Harriet grinned at her, having gotten the opportunity to be contrary, "But it sounds like my grandfather didn't really follow it much."
Hermione took a deep breath and continued, "I understand being scared. I had to decide what sort of life I wished to lead. What is important to me? In your case, how important is Harriet's continued existence? I'm not saying you need to take a curse for her, but if she's that important to you, she has enemies and they aren't going to ignore you if you start dating."
Harry shrugged, "I guess I'm okay. I mostly just like flying and quidditch practices the best. I'm not exactly Hermione."
The hat shouted the last part and the table filled with students sporting red and gold clapped and whistled, one redhead student next to their identical twin cupped their hands and taunted the other house tables, "We got Potter! We got Potter!"
An older woman shouted in excitement and hurried to greet them, speaking rapidly in a language Harriet couldn't understand and kissed Padma and Parvati enthusiastically. They both spoke back to her in whatever Indian language they were using, and then directed their attention to Harriet behind them, Harriet recognized her name in their fast clipped speech.
Draco hummed and then remembered that she was already contemplating what sort of evil would be weak but also desperate enough to even think of using such a horrible method of preservation, "That would explain the unicorns!"
The evening after being released from the infirmary and the next day went as normal as one would expect at a magical school. Classes were fascinating and using parchment and quills were novel, though there were points that Harriet missed a good old ballpoint pen.
Lavender grinned wider, "It so is! I heard it from my Aunt Adenium, who heard it from Bathilda Bagshot, who was childhood friends with the Dumbledore children."
"Yes you are! You were a bully from the second we met!"
McGonagall smiled kindly and turned two pages before showing a similar picture with a similar number of students, though the students themselves were different. She pointed to a girl who had darker skin than Parvati, with hair plaited and decorated with gold ornaments.
That said, it gave her a lot to think about.
"Alright, Albus. What's the catch."
Madam Pomfrey didn't answer and just continued to swipe the pink goo along the rest of Harriet's boils, "And the scar pain comes primarily?"
"You...you trust her?" Draco hesitantly asked further.
Plus, she wondered if she was truly done with Dumbledore messing with her life. Who knew if that horrible man would actually back off or not. And what the fuck was that 'I miscalculated' business? She was obviously a chess piece, a tool to him, but why? What had singled Harriet out to Dumbledore, and for that matter, Voldemort in the first place? Was she destined to become some great witch, like Draco and Parvati said all parselmouths were?
Parvati nodded, and repeated Hermione's movements, aiming for the door, "Obice!"
"Your father is-" Mother smoothed a wrinkle that had formed on the collar of Draco's clothes as she thought of exactly what to say, "a perfectionist and an idealist. He wishes very much for an ideal world. He sees problems in the world and wishes to fix them and set things in their proper place. He's always been extremely hard working and passionate. It's one of the things I admire in him. But he's a perfectionist."
Thanks to my amazing beta and friend Anra7777! She's not even into drarry and has still been wonderfully helpful.
As Harriet entered, she saw that  Professor McGonagall was going through a stack of parchment with a quill dipped in a bottle of red ink. Essay corrections most likely.
Thankfully Malfoy stepped forward, "Thank you, Uncle Severius for attempting to find me. As you can see we are unharmed. It seems the Gryffindors couldn't resist throwing themselves into danger for a little heroic drama."
"What about my mother?" she murmured, hesitant but hopeful.
The first year boys, while having gotten acclimated to the Slytherin girls near daily invasion, still hadn't quite given up the rivalry. Seamus groaned, "There's no way we can win now! He's going to award every penalty he can in favor of Hufflepuff."
Albus was practically mirthful, "The stone is inside. It is so well protected in fact, that neither you nor I can remove it."
Pansy nodded, "So sad. Seriously? What sort of evil would kill a unicorn?"
Harry rolled her eyes, "He's obsessed. I don't think he has a single thought that's not Quidditch related. But then, we're on a winning streak, so I guess I can't really knock him too much. We're definitely up for the cup this year, baring we don't totally bomb against Ravenclaw."
Nicolas asked pointedly, "Does she love?"
"Oh...I mean, I remember being a little worried about you guys getting hit by the debris, but I don't remember the barrier. Maybe instinctually? Like...I felt so angry and felt it all needed to go somewhere, but I didn't want to actually hurt anyone..."
Parvati scoffed, "There's no way that's true."
"And where does the ache locate primarily?"
Nicholas shook his head, "My my. What hornet nest have you poked your nose into?"
Parvati answered sweetly, "Nothing," while simultaneously Draco drawled, "Nothing that should concern you."
"Know any good spells, Hermione?" Harriet asked. Hermione really was a genius, and had definitely learned there was much to be gained from just chilling out once in a while. Harriet was grateful for multiple reasons to make friends with someone like her.
Draco looped her arm around Harry's shoulders, pinning her head in place to properly mess with the birdnest. Harry laughed brightly and escaped the hold and was about to return the favor before Draco's mother gave an obvious cough, having entered the foyer silently.
McGonagall replied modestly, "Well enough. They were my students and we were also on the same side during the war. I hope you never experience it, but war tends to bring out one's core character." McGonagall directed Harriet back to the page, "Your mother was a prefect and also head girl. As I told you, she was a very capable witch. Bright, hard working, and had a tremendously good heart. She really was the best of us in a way."
Harry snorted, "You manage to find the most pretentious way to describe people. And yes. Well sort of." She sighed, less in pleasure and more in mild aggravation, "Hagrid's practically in love with Dumbledore for some reason. He adores him. Maybe he saved him at some point or something. But Hagrid's good. He just seems like a truly good person. He was...my first real friend."
"...wow."
"R-really? Thank you!" Don't cry again, Harriet. Don't cry.
He said one final thing before exiting, almost off-hand. His temper had run its course, "And, Draco. Don't be a further disappointment. While the Potter brat is here you might as well be a good host. We wouldn't want rumors to spread of the Malfoys being less than hospitable." And the door shut closed.
"Zachrias? Haven't sorted a Zacharias recently."
That got her attention. It might have been one of the few exceptions that made such an early wakeup actually justified. However it didn't make it any easier. Draco peeked a single eye open and grumbled, "You better be serious. I'm not waking up for anyone less than the Minister of Magic."
Harriet asked, "He fought Voldemort?"
Parvati spoke first, nearly in tears, "Harry! You said your muggle relatives were awful, but I didn't realize it was that bad!"
Draco's father huffed, obviously irritated, "I haven't the slightest notion as to what you're talking about."
"Why yes. Good to see you're somewhat observant. A useful trait for a Slytherin. I could put you together."
I'm going to take a page from the Matrix and say "Somethings never change...and some things do"
Had it been a challenge to see if Harry would be as strong, or just revenge, long-festering hatred enacted at last? Or could Malfoy really want Harry like this?
"You can't escape," Malfoy murmured, still too close to Harry's face. He licked what had to be Harry's blood from his lips.
Mournfully, Harry looked into the direction where Hogwarts lay behind the hills. The castle's presence exerted an almost physical pull. For the umpteenth time, he cursed Scrimgeour for forcing Professor McGonagall to close the school. No, Hogwarts wasn't the safe haven it had been when Headmaster Dumbledore had been alive - Snape and Malfoy had exploded that illusion. But seeing terrified wizards and witches hastening in groups through Diagon Alley, the empty lanes of Hogsmeade, the children cooped up at home by frightened parents... Re-opening Hogwarts would have been a signal of hope. That the Ministry refused it felt like a surrender to Voldemort. Harry just knew it had to please the evil bastard.
The hated smile had not waned on Malfoy's face. "You know nothing of what I would or would not do."
Despite the pain, Harry's prick burrowed into Malfoy's lap, propelled forward with every crack of the brush against his flesh. Every time he clenched his buttocks to prepare for another smack the sensitive organ rubbed harder against Malfoy's trousers. He could feel the steady movement of Malfoy's hips, grinding up against Harry's hardness without ever letting up on the blows. He had the whole sweeping expanse of Harry's arse and thighs at his disposal, and set about transforming Harry's skin into blazing, liquid fire. The sharp smacking sounds hurt Harry's ears until he flinched as much from the sound as from the pain. His head was muzzy and his face hurt from trying not to scream. He couldn't suppress yelps and whimpers now, even knowing that Malfoy would drink them in.
It took a long moment before the shocks stopped tearing through Malfoy and he straightened up, pulling Harry's ill-used body up into a half-kneeling position. Harry frantically tried to stifle his sobs, mortified at the thought of breaking down in public even as his arse and thighs blazed as if his skin was going to burst, and his head thrummed madly from crying and hanging down over Malfoy's lap.
It had cleared the streets of Hogsmeade faster than an outbreak of Dragon Pox in spite of Auror patrols and a nightly curfew.
"Don't be ridiculous," Harry snapped.
Then Malfoy fumbled his fingers out so quickly that Harry gasped in pain, and fumbled again, impatiently, to position the prick he'd just stroked so shamelessly against Harry's opening. It was bigger than Malfoy's fingers had been, hard and impatient and hot like a firebrand, and this time it hurt. Raw agony shot though Harry's arse as he was stretched without much care. He dug nails into his palms and forbade himself any sound of pain. He would not show Malfoy such weakness.
"Don't touch me!" he snarled from between clenched teeth.
There was a table in the middle of the hut, right below the lamp, and against it lounged a familiar black-robed figure. Harry licked his dry lips and tried to suck in flat breaths to keep the pain in his head from flaring. He was fucked. The Death Eater would drag him off to Voldemort, and that would be the end of him.
Harry cursed and spat "Incendio!" at the creeping carpet. The roots blackened under the blast, but only gripped him with sickening force as the heat burned his own feet. Another tug sent him crashing to his knees, and the roots greedily snatched his wand hand as he tried to balance himself on the ground. He searched fitfully for the silver knife in his pocket with his other hand even as the Death Eater rose before him in a cloud of dark robes. Harry tried to throw himself out of the way, but the roots held fast.
"I can't see you stopping me," Malfoy sneered. He flicked the flaps of Harry's shirt aside, and ran a hand over Harry's stomach. It burned under Malfoy's palm, and goose pimples broke out all over Harry's skin.
Harry's cloak hung from one of the wooden pegs by the door - Malfoy must have been busy tidying up before he left. Harry slouched over to fetch it, stooped as if his desire to curl up and cry in a dark corner reached right into his muscles. He took down the cloak and pulled it around his shoulders. It felt a precious little bit like hiding.
Harry threw the Higgses a look out of half-closed eyes that made both boys' backs stiffen with apprehension, and put his hand over the robe pocket with his own wand.
"R.A.B.!" Hermione gasped. "Sirius's younger brother? But how? He was only a boy when he died, no older than-"
Malfoy threw a lazy glance over his shoulder at the crowd of Slytherins, whose expressions ranged from outrage to breathless excitement. Even those not interested in Quidditch seemed to stick around for another instalment of the infamous Potter/Malfoy feud. The fact that Harry and Malfoy were friends had never stopped Malfoy from challenging Harry every step of the way. High-maintenance in bed and out of it, Malfoy's great ambition was to rule Slytherin, and victory was not complete unless it included the Boy Who Lived.
Malfoy's lips twitched again, and then a smile lit up his face. He buried his own hand in Harry's hair, pushing their mouths close again. Harry could feel the puff of Malfoy's breath against his lips.
“Probably nothing different, I suppose.” Ginny rolled her eyes.
“I don't get it.” Ron threw his parchment on the coffee table under his feet. Hermione continued reading without a glance at her boyfriend. “We've asked everyone. No one has come clean. Almost everyone has solid alibis.” Harry ignored him as well, eating a chocolate frog he'd stored from their most recent trip to Hogsmeade. “Were you just letting us believe what Hermione said about roommates, but you actually snuck someone else in?” Harry shrugged, pulling his card out of the package. Nicholas Flamel. Shrugging was the only response he'd given to Ron the past two days regarding his 'secret lover'. Ron groaned, leaning back against the back of the couch.
“Something I'm sure you'll take advantage of.” Harry laughed as they both started getting ready for bed.
“Came to see why someone was out here so late, saw it was you. I got distracted, what can I say?” Harry was grinning at him, the smile twisting his insides and pissing him off and making his heart clench.
didn't think I would be a good babysitter. Before Teddy.”
“Take away the war. We're just two students at Hogwarts. I'm a female Slytherin following you around and always staring at you. Always trying to be near you, needing to know what you're doing. What would you assume then?” Malfoy's face made it clear he was completely lost.
while I try to study. Now, can you kindly shut up and we can both get back to work?”
"To whom?" Harry pretended he hadn't heard her as he continued speed-walking away.
Potter was sitting on his own bed, legs hanging over as he watched Draco. He turned back to his book.
Draco still had no idea why Harry had brought him there to tell him all of that until Harry had stopped rambling and cleared his throat.
He had been hard at work for two hours before sitting back to study his work. He hated that he wasn’t able to make it perfect – his hands shook ever so slightly, and the whole process was new to him. But he was confident the end product would still be great.
Harry skimmed the last paragraph. He was impressed that, not only had the reporter written his statement down almost word for word, but he also ended with the idea that if Harry Potter could move on from the war and forgive his enemies, maybe it was time they all did.
“But you and Potter are having so much fun! I wouldn't want to get in your way.”
When Malfoy offered Ron some of the sweets his mother had owled him, Ron didn't even consider that they could be poisoned or one of George's trick candies that tasted awful. The thought that he'd instinctively trusted
“I imagine you plan on sharing with your friends. Or does the Chosen One get to eat all of the cake while his friends watch? That does sound about right.”
Putting up with a git was nothing compared to that.
“Hm?”
“What do you mean? You were there.” Weasley scooted her arms closer to him on the table.
“Third, plenty of you bicker, but no one assumes you are... interested in one another.”
“He does bring out the best in everyone, doesn’t he?”
“No - is that true?” Hermione nodded, no question in her mind. Shit shit shitshit
“Okay...” Malfoy and Ginny continued a staring contest, but eventually Ginny realized Malfoy didn't think he needed to offer more than that. She huffed. “I'm not trying to be rude, Malfoy, but why in the hell would you give it to
Thinking intently of everything he knew his girlfriend liked, Ron startled when a blond sat down beside him. “Malfoy,” he mumbled. The blond nodded.
“Oh! I haven't read that one yet.” Draco sat up further.
“Excuse me?”
He didn't want to upset Teddy, but the boy would have to understand. He saw Teddy at least once or twice a week already. Besides, it wasn't like the boy didn't have enough attention with just one of them there.
“He's always going to be a prick.” Harry flopped on the couch. “Aw, a cake! You shouldn't have.”
said anything! You guys are the ones who keep bringing him up."
finish dinner!” Harry studied him intently for a moment.
“Wow.” Draco shook his head. “You really are shit friends.” Ron started raging towards him, wand suddenly out, when someone walked in.
I could still be on the wrong side. I- I just need to know what's going on, Harry.”
“It looks like you're bothering me while I try to study.” Potter looked around in a dramatic gesture.
“What the hell are you doing?” Despite the angry words, there was no emotion whatsoever in them.
“Oh.” Draco picked a weed from beside him and started picking the pieces off of it. It brought a memory of Hermione and Dean explaining a stupid muggle concept to them – taking a flower and picking the petals off saying, 'he loves me, he loves me not', and you had your answer when you plucked the last petal. How incredibly daft.
“Please tell me you don't mean what I think you mean.” George laughed cheekily.
“Hey!” Weasley called out, interrupting the peaceful quiet. “Where'd you get that?” Granger looked like she was going to chastise the red head, then noticed what he was asking about.
“You think so?” Malfoy shrugged, but Harry noticed the slight tint on his cheeks. He never would have been able to see it six months ago, before they'd started... whatever this was.
Draco had gone home yesterday, and as almost always, done nothing on a Friday night. He'd read a novel and listened to the highlights of a recent Quidditch match, and that was about it. George and his friends pestered him to have more of a social life, but Draco was genuinely fine spending most of his time at home.
“Yeah. Just got pissed at some of the Eighth Years. Mostly Gryffindors, of course.” There was only the slightest bit of teasing there. Harry was quiet for some time.
“I think he feels bad for everything he did to us,” she'd say. “He's just trying to make amends so he can forgive himself and be happy.”
fall in love with him?
Draco sipped on a butterbeer, doing his best to ignore all of the loud noises around him. There was a group of rambunctious students behind him, playing some game he'd never heard of that involved flicking coins at one another. The group around Potter was playing another game he didn't know that comprised of naming things one hadn't done and the others being forced to drink if they had done that thing. He assumed it was meant to be a drinking game, but they seemed to be having plenty of fun with only Pumpkin juice or butterbeer. There were a dozen loud conversations going on at once, but Draco wasn't paying attention to a single one.
Just as he was considering leaving, the door was suddenly wrenched open to the Savior of the Wizarding World with a singing boy hanging on his shoulders. There was a beat where no one spoke.
He wasn't even sure where he was going until he was most of the way to the lake. Even though there was a giant sea monster in it, the lake always seemed like the calmest place at Hogwarts to him. Besides, he desperately needed fresh air.
Potter. He'd save the entire Wizarding World, faced death half a dozen times and won, and he could tell a bloke that he liked him. Even if the bloke was Draco Malfoy.
because he'd saved the world that millions of young girls dreamed about being his wife.
He took a deep breath and stopped himself. They'd all made mistakes. They'd bullied Malfoy and his friends nearly as much. They'd all done things in the war. Malfoy had saved their lives when it mattered. He'd been cleared of all charges, with just a precautionary monitored probation. They had apologized and talked through it. It would never be undone or forgotten. But they had forgiven.
“Yeah. I think he might. If you're okay with that.”
“The same to you.” Harry cleared his throat.
“I've already told you why I like you.”
“Draco!” Granger cried, clearly upset. “I thought you were over your petty rivalry. It's his birthday.”
“We thought that maybe...” Hermione took a deep breath, then blurted it out. “Maybe there's a reason that you're pretending you think he's up to something.” Harry scoffed. Why else would he want to stare at that angelic face and watch the way his eyes twinkled when he read a part of a book that he enjoyed and hear him mutter to himself when he studied-
“Draco and I had a discussion about what you all said earlier, and you were right.” Malfoy kept his face straight, too confused by Harry's somber voice to be embarrassed. He noticed Finnigan's smirk falter at the voice. “Our fighting was immature. We don't want to annoy you, and we certainly don't want to give you the wrong impression. We've agreed to stop fighting.”
“Wh- Did you think I was going to like you because you started stalking me?” Harry didn't even seem annoyed.
He wouldn't talk to him, for the most part, and usually didn't even really look at him. But he would sit with him in the library a few times a week and silently study. If they happened to be going to the same review session or heading back to the Common Room at the same time, Potter would fall into step beside him without a single word of greeting. There had even been a few times when Draco was reading or working in the Common Room, and Potter – for no apparent reason – felt the need to sit next to Draco and work on whatever he was occupied with.
“Are you five?” Draco asked, his voice stern. “I'm not saying he's innocent, but neither are you. We all heard you arguing and you said some really shit things, even if it was to Weasley.” Harry started to speak, but Draco continued. “You're making your friends uncomfortable and miserable. Weasley's obviously miserable. You're clearly miserable. And I'm tired of seeing the theatrics every time you walk in the same damn room.
“Do you wish I still was?”
“No, he isn’t! For Christ sake Ron, have you ever thought, just for one second, that perhaps Draco just wasn’t as lucky in his friends as we were? That he spent eleven years having a single mindset drilled into him and when he arrived at Hogwarts being immediately aligned with people who shared that inherited nonsense? Did you ever consider, just for a second, how different he might have turned out if someone had just taught him otherwise?”
“What are you doing?”
If the roles had been reversed, Ron would have fought it. He would have told Harry that his friends needed to accept it, that his friends needed to make an effort, too, that they needed to grow up. Even he wouldn't have blamed Malfoy if he'd done something like that.
The Golden Trio strolled into the Great Hall later than normal, even for a weekend. “I thought you weren't talking to the press anymore, Harry.” Harry shrugged as Ginny threw the paper in the middle of the three new arrivals as they took their seats.
“What's going on?” Harry turned to look at him.
“I figured as much. However, I thought you might want this for her.” He held out an envelope with posh writing on the front. Ron raised an eyebrow, but Malfoy just held it out in front of Ron. With a suspicious look, Ron slowly took the envelope and found two tickets inside.
“Nu-uh.”
“When we argue and fight and tease each other... I am flirting.” Draco struggled to find a response for longer than was normal, he knew. He recognized the flush slowly taking over Harry's face.
“I'm not going to lie or make something up, Malfoy. I would never say anything to anyone unless I knew you were actually doing something. I never said anything to anyone sixth year either. Well, except Ron and Hermione.” Malfoy nodded, his shoulders relaxing slightly.
Ron walked away as Harry started brainstorming. He slowly sat down on his bed. Well, there was the last step he wanted, and he'd cracked the case.
“Uncle Draco and Uncle Harry are here!” Potter laughed.
“You signed the card, 'the only person in the world who doesn't like you.” Draco shrugged.
“Harry, dear. You don't have to make me extra food every time you come over. You insult an old woman's cooking.”
“I'm not the ass! He started it!”
“Teddy really enjoyed having both of us there,” was all that Draco offered.
But Ron knew it was more than that. If that was the case, Malfoy would have stopped as soon as he and Hermione agreed to a truce and forgave him. They were polite to him now, and never insulted him, and Malfoy still hadn't stopped going out of his way to be kind to them. He was obviously up to something.
“No,” Harry said, but he didn't sit back down.
“Wow, Potter. Savior of the wizarding world, and humble, too.” Harry lightly huffed.
Although Draco had come a long way in accepting himself and recognizing that he wasn’t an entirely terrible person, he wasn't fool enough to believe for one second that Harry Potter would ever be interested in him.
“Did you actually talk to Harry?” Daphne tried to turn the conversation back to the only thing she wanted to talk about, apparently. Draco hesitated, turning over one of his chips. For some reason, he didn't want to tell them about that evening.
“For Merlin's sake,” he grumbled at the cheesy words in icing. “Thank you for saving us all!' I thought you were supposed to be smart, Granger.” Her face hardened. He glanced at the second cake and found it said simply, 'Happy Birthday, Neville!' He ignored them to charm Potter's cake to say, 'Happy Birthday, Harry!' instead.
“I'm totally about to get on that, 'Mione. Swear.” He exchanged a look with Weasley that indicated he probably never would.
Harry snapped his focus back to his plate.
When he returned to work Tuesday, Draco made a face as he looked over the list. George rolled his eyes.
“Oh, so you sent Harry home?”
from dating? What potion do
“I know,” Draco interrupted sharply. “I already told him I couldn't.”
A sudden crash and odd squeak near them caused both of them to freeze. “I, er. Sorry, mate. Leaving now.”
Harry hated it for a lot of reasons – despite trying to redecorate a little, the entire thing was old-fashioned and stuffy. The portrait of Mrs. Black chastised him and outright bellowed at Granger and some of his other friends. Kreacher made him feel uncomfortable with his overbearing nature and odd behavior, and Draco had a strong suspicion there was some larger, underlying reason Harry didn't like the House Elf. Both Andromeda and Sirius were burned off the family tapestry, and there were other indicators of them being considered traitors.
“You've read the others?” The awkwardness fell away as he and Granger fell into a conversation about whether one of the characters was evil. Draco made sure not to spoil anything from the new book. When that conversation died down, they ate in a much more comfortable silence.
“Oh, we're definitely flirting when we bicker,” the same one said, no shame whatsoever. There were a few laughs and vague cheers. He gritted his teeth, his eyes scouring the room until they landed on the two in front of them.
The man obliged, stepping into reach and bending down to examine Harry's prone form. Harry's hand shot out. He grabbed the man's ankle and pulled.
His eyes fell on his own gangly, bare legs with bruises marring the inside of his thighs. He was naked, and with that awareness came the cold, biting his flesh. The door of the hut stood slightly ajar. As if someone had left, and pulled it shut again without much care. Or as if something smaller than human had squeezed its way out...
Or hadn't been, a few weeks ago. There was something different about him now. Maybe that was what happened if you had the Dark Mark and Voldemort could reach inside your soul.
He'd have to think about that.
"And I always wanted to have you," Malfoy continued, in an eerie voice that reminded Harry of Bellatrix Lestrange. "I told you that two years back, didn't I? Oh, not at the beginning. At first I just wanted you as a friend, famous Harry Potter, to pry all the secrets and powers out of the Boy Who Lived..." The chilly little smirk reappeared on his lips. "But then you shunned me, and made every school year utter hell until finally I only wanted you beneath me, beaten and helpless and begging..." Malfoy's hand closed around Harry's throat, leaving him hyper-aware of how his pulse hammered above his collarbone and against the clasp of Malfoy's fingers. "Just like this."
"What do you want?" he hissed, and Harry, whose first unconscious impulse was 'to come', followed by the rational 'freedom', rejected both. He wouldn't beg for the one, nor give Malfoy the chance to reject the other.
"Crucio!"
Malfoy's eyes gleamed. "My mother always knew what cousin Regulus had brought home with him before the Dark Lord had him killed as a traitor. And Snape sent me here to get it, and to make an example of whoever was guarding it. He said you'd come." Rage stained Harry's cheeks at the mention of the traitor. "The same thing as my father's diary. Which you destroyed, Harry. Again, all our misery traces back to you."
"Be quiet," Malfoy ordered, slipping his hand in further until it touched Harry's sweaty prick. "You've wasted too much time already. We have hardly more than half an hour left until moonrise."
In his early years, Harry had sometimes wondered how things would've played out if he'd taken the Sorting Hat's offer for Gryffindor... If he hadn't run into Draco and his father searching for a way onto Platform 9 3/4... If Weasley hadn't brushed off Draco so rudely that Harry felt he had to intercede for his new acquaintance... Then he might compete with Ronald Weasley now instead of plotting to take revenge.
"Sectums-" he gasped, trying to aim when the Death Eater's boot came down with sickening force on the fingers of his wand hand. Harry bit his lip to stifle a whimper. His fingerbones threatened to crack under the pressure. Tears shot into his eyes, and the wand slipped from his numbing fingers. A non-verbal summoning charm sent it up into the man's gloved fist. The boot came down again, this time aiming straight for Harry's face and bruising his cheek with unexpected force. Harry saw stars and slumped backwards. His last thought before the second kick impacted right on his temple was that the Death Eater was inhumanly strong for such a slight figure.
Just let me see you stop me! Harry thought mutinously. The... he refused to think of it as a kiss, but it scared him. "Let go!" he insisted again, and to his surprise Malfoy drew back and summoned his wand from the table.
It stung, because Harper was a lousy reserve, but Harry couldn't deny that he deserved the dig. He'd been on edge ever since the disastrous end of the previous school year when Voldemort had sent him the vision of Sirius being trapped and tortured in the Department of Mysteries. Harry had run out of his OWLs blindly, desperate to go to the rescue, babbling half-mad to Draco when his yearmates came after him. Only to find himself Stunned, Petrified and bound to his bed with Pansy standing guard over him, wand in hand, while Draco and Zabini went to find Snape. Harry still woke up at night bathed in cold sweat at the thought of what might have happened if they hadn't stopped him. He'd have walked right into a Death Eater trap, and would have gotten himself and Merlin knew who else killed in the process. He'd come uncomfortably close to owing Malfoy a life debt.
"I won Slytherin every match since-" he started, only to fall silent at Malfoy's raised hand.
"Cast the Killing Curse instead," he ground out, his voice constrained by exertion and fear.
When Harry didn't obey quickly enough, Malfoy shot forward like a snake and caught Harry's tie, pulling him in. Harry stumbled and had to brace himself against Malfoy's thigh.
He'd gone into the match dead tired, always a bad idea when playing Quidditch against Gryffindor and their bastard of a captain. They'd all been sloppy after the Weasley twins had left school the year before, expecting the new Gryffindor line-up to be a pushover for its first few games. Harry should have known better - Ronald Weasley had trained up his underestimated new Beaters to go right after him.
He'd insisted on going alone over the protests of Ron and Hermione. If Harry vanished for a 'night out in Muggle London', who could object? He was of age, and independent. But if all three of them were gone, Mrs Weasley would raise the roof when she came in to cook dinner in the evening.
"If he's got a concussion, perhaps he should go and see Pomfrey before you tear him to pieces," Millicent Bulstrode commented from the sidelines.
Malfoy's face danced, sharply outlined, at the insides of his eyelids, so vivid that Harry could smell the rain-scent of his skin, feel the burn of his cock deep inside him, the silken tug of fingers at his groin.
"I didn't-" he protested, and the wand at his throat gave a painful little buzz, as if transmitting its owner's displeasure.
When he was halfway confident that his legs would not give out and send him collapsing into a heap as soon as he tried to stand, he pounced. He tackled Malfoy, stifling a scream as his muscles protested the sudden movement. He grabbed desperately for Malfoy's wand, but the bastard just slipped off the bed in a fluid move. Harry scrabbled forward to follow when something bit down around his right ankle, sending him onto his belly in a graceless sprawl.
"What's this, then?" Harry pressed on, intent on getting the little shite to talk. He might learn something, and Malfoy was full of himself. As long as he prattled, he wouldn't curse or hit Harry. "You're going to wait for reinforcements before you drag me off to your master?"
When Harry finally laid eyes on the hut, almost a mile outside Hogsmeade in the middle of a small clearing, it looked less ramshackle than he'd expected a hideout of Dung's to be. It was built from solid wooden logs fused together by magic into elaborate swirls at the joints. Small, but Harry reminded himself that size on the outside meant nothing for a wizarding dwelling. The clearing was shrouded in silence. There was no sign of life - the single window was barricaded and the door bolted. Tonks and Kingsley must have locked up again when they left. Harry drew his wand.
"Sleep, Potter," Malfoy muttered.
Harry could see it in a flash of vision - the elder Malfoy, resplendent in brocade robes, one hand tangled in the sleek mess of Draco's hair, pulling his head back just a little to expose Draco's throat; the silver knife in his other hand looming close, reflected in the translucent shine of Draco's skin. He saw Draco's face, eyelids fluttering but unresisting, with that tiny, bitter smile on his lips, serene like a young animal selected for sacrifice. Saw the flash of silver, and snapped, "No!"
The memory returned to Harry's mind on the path of countless nightmares; the jaws of the monster, the glowing amber eyes, the massive bulk of bristling grey fur... Snuffles's pained whine as the creature flung him away into the undergrowth... He'd been scared out of his mind!
"But I'll give you one thing, Potter," he promised. "We'll get Weasley for setting his Beaters on you - soon." Next to Malfoy, Crabbe was cracking his knuckles appreciatively.
Malfoy had watched Pansy's nursing like a cat watching a plump, savoury mouse. Now, he stretched luxuriously and leaned his hip against a table.
That very same resentment had made Harry run away to spend his last week before the start of his second year at the Malfoys'. In retrospect, he couldn't quite blame Dumbledore for yelling at him about the prophecy in response to taking such a mad risk. Back then, however, he'd felt miserable and resentful and certain that Mr Malfoy wouldn't have wanted to explain to the Ministry why the Boy Who Lived had mysteriously died in his care. In fact, Harry kind of admired Lucius Malfoy, Death Eater or not. The Malfoys might sneer at Harry's pedigree, but would take him to the World Cup for the whole wizarding world to see to polish up Lucius's tarnished reputation. Lucius had never disguised the fact that while he approved of Harry's stormy friendship with Draco, he would still sacrifice Harry in a heartbeat should circumstances necessitate it. And he had, in the Riddle graveyard. Still, it was the sort of blunt honesty Harry missed in Dumbledore, who was unable to disguise that he, Harry, somehow fell short of his expectations.
“Um... I didn't think we were arguing. It sounded like we were agreeing-”
Twenty minutes later, Harry was still nowhere to be seen. Ron had started to worry at ten. The war was over, the Dark Lord gone, but that didn't mean Harry couldn't still be in trouble. Some of his fans were absolutely mental. Who knows what some of them would do if they got their hands on him?
“Harry.” The brunette looked up at Hermione's gentle voice. “We wanted to talk to you about something.” Harry straightened up from where he had slumped against the couch. That didn't sound good.
"Is that a crime?" Hermione frowned at his unnecessarily sharp response.
“I'm fine. Just needed some quiet.” Harry hesitated.
“Please do,” Draco called after him without turning away from the witch in front of him. “Are you done being gits? Do your friend a favor and don't do anything else to ruin his birthday.” He didn't give a chance to respond before grabbing the trash bag and storming out.
If Draco thought Weasley and Harry laughing obnoxiously loudly in the common room was annoying, the two making a point of ignoring each other was somehow worse. In every class, there was an awkward moment where Granger and all of the other Gryffindors hesitated, as no one wanted to sit with either Harry or Weasley, knowing the other would take it as them choosing the other's side. The same was true in the Great Hall, where the two former best friends sat several feet apart, and their friends were forced to pick a side or sit awkwardly between them.
He listened to the radio as he worked. After a nice streak of songs Draco enjoyed, and even started whistling to, the news came on. He half-listened to some stories on a huge Muggle event in London that would cause a lot of extra foot traffic in the city, an update on the new coffee shop that was set to open in Knockturn Alley in two weeks, and the week's Quidditch scores.
As Draco started up the process of making Puking Pastilles, which was nearly second nature for him at this point, he considered his career choice.
When he pulled back, Harry looked into Draco's eyes and remembered all the things he'd once thought were impossible, too: defeating Voldemort once and for all, facing a dragon, breaking out of Gringotts – hell, being a wizard.
"Much simpler than people." Malfoy smiled so innocently that Harry's heart clenched. That wasn't an expression he'd ever seen or even imagined on Malfoy.
“We had a copy of it in Malfoy Manor. When I heard you were looking for it, I went home and grabbed it.”
“How very Slytherin of you, Harry.” His grin grew.
Then again, without a picture they wouldn't have any story. In Hogwarts, Draco had heard a different girl each day claim that she had a date with Harry that weekend. He doubted it had changed much.
Harry breathed out heavily, barely having breathed during his whole rant. “Is that enough? Do you get why I like you now? I can keep going if you need.”
“Of course, of course.”
Draco rolled up his sleeves, the air getting hot after working on Potions for so long in the fairly small room. Even though it was March and freezing outside, the room had long since moved past warm. After a moment of consideration, he charmed the roof hatch open. He hated to do it when it was so cold out, but he was dying in the heat.
had said.
“We had a very fun night. Everything's been taken care of. Leftovers from dinner are in the fridge.” Andromeda sighed.
Draco cleared his throat. “My Aunt had asked me to babysit. When work let out early, I thought I would stop by in case she hadn't found anyone.” Teddy dropped from Potter's shoulders and ran up to Draco, who gladly picked him up.
“And I'll make sure you're
? - and George hadn't seemed surprised and told him to consider it.
"Well, I think you're stressing him out, always staring at him like that." Harry's face ran pale.
“You aren't,” Draco stated stupidly. Harry shrugged.
“What about these two?” He gestured to Ron and Hermione. “They bickered like a married couple before...” he trailed off.
“Which one of us do you think it
“Absolutely not.”
woman more time to enjoy life.”
Despite how obvious his friends found him, he didn't think his mother had any idea of his feelings for the man. He'd made a point of even limiting how much he talked about Harry in any capacity. Then again, if he really had a look like his friends claimed, maybe his mother was familiar with it, too.
Draco had politely told George he wasn't sure it was the right fit for him – Draco Malfoy in a
“Hear, hear. Pansy, let’s go back to your story about your cat getting into Nott’s potions cabinet. I need to hear the end of that.”
“Would you like to talk about it?”
Ron grinned at his plate.
"It was just an observation."
Draco took the tea from Kreacher with a 'thank you' and settled back into the couch. Without really seeing Harry for years, Draco had managed to almost entirely eradicate his...
“Like what?”
“Ron thinks it's from a secret admirer,” she continued. “If it wasn't from you, I guess he must be right. I just wish the person who gave it to him could know that anyone who knows him that well, who's willing to get such a nice gift, who makes absolute sure his birthday is great...” Draco gritted his teeth. “Well. Harry doesn't usually like admirers, as you know. But I think someone like that... maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if this person... admired him. Maybe Harry wouldn't even be opposed to it.” She shrugged, but got up before he could respond, even if he wanted to. Ginny dramatically raised her eyebrows at Draco, then popped up and followed her friend out of the Great Hall.
“Yes. I meant, she told me what you did before his party.” Draco did his best, he really did. But despite all his efforts, he definitely flushed. Flushing was better than blushing, probably.
“It was a really nice gift, Draco. Just admit you can actually be thoughtful.” Draco ignored him. Eventually he heard Potter settle into bed. Draco read the same page in his book a dozen times in a row without absorbing anything except that Potter had called him Draco.
“My shift ended early. I wanted to check if you had found a babysitter.” He hugged his Aunt when she outstretched her arms.
“And I see you, Draco. I see you put up with the bullshit people say and the Prophet writes about you so much better than I do. And they're saying positive things about me! After everything you went through, you resisted and became a good person anyway. You couldn't kill Dumbledore when you life depended on it. You saved me in the Manor. You knew it was me, because you've always been able to see me. But you saved me anyway.
“Oh.” Hermione nodded, her voice soft. Draco sighed.
It grew weirdly quiet as Harry opened the small package. Draco still hadn't looked away from where he was picking the good parts out of a bowl of 'trail mix', he thought Hermione had called it. There was a gasp, probably from Hermione when she realized what it was, but Harry just burst out laughing. Draco tried to hold back a smile that was threatening to show.
“What the hell is this?” Draco grumbled on entering the Eighth Year common room. There was no one in the room, but there were balloons in clumps around the floor and posters hanging on all the walls. Our Hero, one of them read. Savior of the Wizarding World, cried out another. Everything was in red and gold, of course. Draco felt his stomach twist.
“Anyway,” Draco interrupted their conversation. “This is exactly the kind of thing we come here to ignore.” He raised his mug of butterbeer and Blaise knocked it with his.
“Fancy a game of Wizard's chess?” Ron looked up to see Malfoy standing in front of him. He snorted.
Hermione's suspicion turned to excitement as she scanned the title of the book. Ron wouldn't have been sure from the name, but the response from Hermione made it clear it was the book she'd been looking for the past two weeks.
. I was just about to get dinner ready if you two want to hang out.”
. He forced down any more thoughts of Malfoy
It hadn't been long after returning to Hogwarts that Draco admitted to himself that part of his obsession with Harry – at least for the last few years – was attraction. He'd always found Harry attractive, as long as he'd known he was gay. You couldn't really deny how handsome the man was. It wasn't
“Nope.” The 'p' popped like a bubble. Draco closed his eyes, the flush he had so proudly detained pouring out all at once. “I didn't say what it was at all.”
“Never! I want to give a
“Have you eaten?” Draco shook his head. “All right, I'll make you some, too.”
“As delicate as I should expect from you, Potter.” Still grinning, Harry leaned closer so that he could press a slow, tantalizing kiss to his lips.
Draco took a deep breath. He didn't think seeing Harry like that again was a good idea. It wasn't smart to build his heart up that way just to not interact with Harry again for years.
“A lot of people don't believe that someone....” he looked around before whispering, “like
The Ministry could have done a lot more to help the Order – and everyone – as soon as Harry told them Voldemort was back, if only the Minister of Magic had listened. Umbridge wouldn't have been able to take over Hogwarts and prevent the students from knowing the truth. The Death Eaters wouldn't have been able to avoid Azkaban the first time around, after Voldemort's first defeat, just by paying off the Ministry. Harry wouldn't have had a warrant for his arrest out, which obviously had impeded his efforts to save the world.
“Well... thank you, I suppose.”
“What? No. Now I'm never going to stop.” Draco rolled his eyes, trying to hold back his grin, and started walking again.
“We wanted it to be a little more complimentary, but-”
“You have... the
“I have no idea what you think I got him.”
“Go apologize to your friend.”
“It may not surprise you to know that I have had my fair share of shitty birthdays. I wouldn't wish that fate on my worst enemy.” To be fair, that was the truth. It was possible, however, that he might not have gone out of his way to fix his enemy's birthday.
