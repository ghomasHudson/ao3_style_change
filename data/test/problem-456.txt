and a trained assassin, of course he’d know that I was practically barreling my way towards the him and Kikue, but he didn’t move or make any eye contact with me, and I … I didn’t like that at all.
“Don’t thank me yet. You need to get changed into the proper clothing for the club so you won’t stand out like a sore thumb in the crowd. Caetia is actually in the living room and he’s got clothes in his dressing room upstairs that you could use, although we may have to use some magic to make the material smaller with more room around your buttocks area since you’ve got curves and a tighter, more petite body than Caetia.”
all his customers are dead and his business has gone to shite!” My words were shrill with worry, eyes wide as they followed how Harry simply ignored my bout of sentences to come prowling towards me with a cool set of his features showing nothing that could place an emotion on, the dark of his eyes glowing in the dim light of both the moon now shining down on us and the lights of the underground tunnel.
“Here. All you need to do is inhale the smoke coming out of it’s liquid.” I mumbled my words up at Harry, lips pursed in concentration as I focused on the Gryffindor to take note of his reaction to the potion.
Harry’s eyes were focused on the wriggling sweat of my naked shape, illuminate in their eery green red stare as he watched me moan and cry out from every push of his cock into my arse, digging his way into me while he impaled my body over and over without let up, making me
Ashamed and shaking with raw nerves and heat, I turned away from the dead vampire and Potter, staring at ground as I started to walk away from the psychotic assassins. I heard Granger murmur to Potter as I walked on weakened limbs towards the nearest store, trying to push my arousal away and focus on the fucked up situation I just got myself into. “I’ll get rid of the body. We made a scene so we need to find another place for you guys to hide.”
Watching Potter grip the velcro wrapped around his right wrist, I jolted on the spot from the impending
I was bouncing in Harry’s arms, my arse bumping over the curl of his fingers that had a death grip on the meat of my cheeks, making my mouth turn up to reveal a pained hiss whenever Harry quickened his steps and situated me this way and that way in his arms, the tips of his fingers practically trying to burrow themselves into the fleshy meat of my arse and making my breath rise whenever his bloodied flesh of his searing appendages brushed across the exposed flesh of my arsecheeks.
me, the deep lull of his voice harsh and unforgiving, slandering me and basically calling me pathetic for not having the courage to say out loud what I’ve wanted to since meeting Harry all over again.
A significant pig squeal from the man writhing in an agonizingly thrashing manner beneath me had echoed out around us a split second after his arms flailed about, the whites of his eyes blurring with unshed tears of his evident pain while the flapping of his trembling gaping mouth gave way to another scream that resounded throughout the empty dark room surrounding both of us as he felt the tear of his innards spewing from the gash wound I made in his stomach.
“Good. I’m glad you find my house pleasant. I’m also stoked to hear that you’re getting more satisfied with your body, I mean, you have a banging one so why wouldn’t you? That outfit was
When I felt the straining of my back start to loosen and my frame go slack from the sudden burst of euphoric calm that overtook my body, my ears started to pick up the familiar sound of heavy bass thrumming closer and closer as music started to filter in around both Harry and I, the motorcycle taking another right to reveal a mansion that was at least three times larger than the ones below us just moments ago.
Harry reached over to turn off the stove, having placed the bacon and sausages on a plate to my left.
My eyes widened when I felt the buzzing essence of magic shoving itself through the material of my coat to tear it away from my body with a forceful yank on my person.
I had been sitting at one out of the many tables in the middle of the room on a stool for the past six hours, sorting through a good few hundred pages of some potions books as I tried to find which potions I could gather that could potentially lead to a concoction that would put a large mass of people into a deep sleep without harming said people or giving itself away before it even hit its victims.
I leaned my head back, my breaths rising high in my chest as I watched the way Harry’s pitch black, unruly locks swept across his forehead as he tilted his head and loomed over my petite frame with the lean of his muscled body. I was intimidated, exhilarated, and at ease all at once.
When I took one look at how morbidly serious Harry was when he asked me about it being alright to leave me with his Gryffindor comrades, I was too floored at Harry’s severe expression to not even argue at the man and instead gave my clear consent for him to leave.
My gaze wandered from one wall to the next in front of me, bewildered and quivering in my pleasured haze. I couldn’t see anything but black, bursting spots and an array of blood red flecks, like the ruby of Harry’s eyes.
Pansy smiled wider, shaking her head back and forth slowly as she laughed lightly beneath her breath. “Darling, I believe I am.”
As I watched Hermione walk away, I decided right then and there that Harry needed to make amends with his friends and stop distancing himself from them. If he can control his magic around me when he fucks me, then he can control his magic around his best friends. I’m sure the Assassin felt bad about pushing his friends away despite him trying to seem nonchalant about it.
I waited for my mail with my ears straining to hear footsteps outside of my apartment for the mailman since I was too poor to have an Owl drop me off my mail.
Harry’s eyes were trained solely on my mark, the harsh light of his eyes darkening further as he replied to my question. “Yes. That was another question you asked. Now I want you to grab some food, put it on one of the plates I got down for you and eat.”
I wanted to run the shaking of my cold fingers into the soaked strands of my pale hair and tug at them in frustration.
a latin phrase that means “by skill and valour”. This place’s focus is training and assigning future wizard soldiers that go undercover to complete a task that the Ministry of Magic does not partake in because we deal with the dirty deeds. We deal with killing people for the sake of the citizen’s safety and to prevent world wide known catastrophes from happening. Arte et Marte is a place that assures protection of anyone in danger of harm but it’s also a place where assassins do what they are expected, and that is to get their jobs done even if they have to murder those that get in the way or could pose a small threat.” Hezian’s cerulean eyes gleamed in the dim light of the room, mahogany walls seeming to give the space surrounding me a darker effect of the area.
“Take your coat off.” Potter’s voice dripped with gravelled prevalence, a husky murmur that made my thighs give a shudder and my knees buckle the smallest of an amount, groin giving an insistent throb as my lungs seemed to stop its regular operative system from the sound of the Gryffindor’s words.
I yelped out at the rushed action, my heart hammering against my chest as I tried to keep the frown on my face from wavering in the wake of Harry’s quiet rage, his glowing gaze slipping over every space of my expression as if analyzing each tick I made to cause my person to feel open and bare and unnerved.
Turning the black knob on the door, I pressed against the frame to watch it swing inwards, my mouth opening to call out Albon’s name only to let out a squeal, high pitched and intoned with jarring disbelief.
Pressing my back against the door, a shudder raced through my body when the deep, heavy thrumming bass of music filtered around my skin, tickling across the expanse of my flesh as my limbs buzzed with the heavy bass sounding all around me. The music was sensual, slow and deep as it accompanied a man’s smooth vibrato.
My breaths came out stunted and unnerved in the wave of elated embarrassment I was suddenly put under.
Gasping, I brought down my left hand to clutch at Potter’s knee between my legs to keep from toppling sideways since I was literally dangling from his thigh that kept me suspended up in the air and against the wall.
the building but outside of it. Hell, you even said that maybe I should go on a mission with you at some point anyway,” I whispered yelled towards the Gryffindor, not wanting Hezian to hear the last part since the man didn’t know anything about having awakened my dark magic and it’s need to feed off of negative outcomes, energy, and others’ dark magic.
The spoken order made me quake from where I stood, heat running through my limbs and making my breath quicken.
My airway was being cut off longer between each interval of a game of catch and release of the oxygen I needed, as if Harry was purposely
“Harry James Potter!” I snapped at the Gryffindor, voice rising in a panic as I breathed raggedly and felt the fine line of my sanity lingering on the edge of a cliff and ready to jump off at any given moment.
I was shameless in the way I spoke around a tremor of a voice, high and needy as I stared up at Harry from beneath my wet lashes that had tears spilling down my cheeks from the wonderful pain and pleasure, the prodding of the Gryffindor’s pick puncturing into my lower abdomen.
When the pressured, ominous shadowed tar like magic of Harry’s had dissipated after its sudden outburst and sinister power, it felt as if it crawled back inside the deceptive and harsh body of the assassin’s where it spewed forth from to hide away and settle back in its crime for the time being as it let the air surrounding me clear and reveal its destructive murder.
My lips parted on an exhale of a breath, body humming with energized warmth and anxiety as I processed the man’s words. There was something that he said that made me raise my brows in my Malfoy haughty manner. “What makes you think I’m a submissive?” Even though I said it without any stutter, I felt my cheeks flush in mortification at my own words.
And I was going to have to put a stop to this stupid tantrum of mine, for the sake of both Harry and I.
him, both intentionally and uninhibited. I hated making the Slytherin shatter across the dirty ground and loved observing the way his cheeks reddened and the perfectly put together boy crawl out of his own skin and display the
Pretending that I wasn’t as anxious as I knew I was from the want I felt to bury my head beneath concrete and stay there with the way my breaths tried to wheeze pass the tiny quiver of my mouth, I held myself very still in case my legs decided to give out on me and leave me haphazard on the floor in a pool of apprehension.
The buzzing in my ears died down with the exhilaration of my kill descending into my chest to burrow itself there, my nerves feeling frayed and jostled about like some sack of potatoes as I was left weakened in the limbs from the amount of the new dark magic and energy I took in.
Blinking up at Harry from where I was perched upon his bike, I released a shaky breath, taking in the messy strands of the Gryffindor’s dark hair and the way the man looked like a slinking panther as he slipped his hands into the front pockets of his jeans with an intimidating cool indifference, the cords of his muscles shifting in the lazy movement he made, all composed and carnal in his dominating presence.
Standing right in front of Harry with my index finger aimed towards that obnoxiously gorgeous face of his in accusation, I glared up at my boyfriend, spluttering on the spot in outrage.
I paid attention to the fast beating of my heart, trying to focus on bringing the quickened rhythms of the organism down to a slower and east pace with each breath I took into my lungs while I continued speaking up at the ceiling, knowing that Harry was listening and giving me my space to calm down. “And then Cho Chang of all people went and talked about how useless I’d be as a partner of yours, talking about my lack of using magic without my stupid wand and how I’d practically never be good enough for you. She also talked about how you fucked her on a regular basis and that pissed me off some more.”
I couldn’t really blame them. Who would want to associate with someone who was a death eater and was thought to have forced Snape to kill Dumbledore? No one has yet tried to kill me or physically abuse me since the war, but that’s because everyone in the wizarding world saw me as worthless.
“I should have been more considerate though. So I do apologize about that,” Harry’s deep voice vibrated through my bones as he went to brush his hand up my leg while he continued on with his words, looking me straight in the eye, “and I want you to know that I never fucked Cho. She most likely said that to get under your skin and wished for that to happen. There’s also no way that you’d be useless to me. You’re smart in everything that you do, there’s no doubt about that.”
Each person’s face was impassive, although at some points during their harsh fighting, I could make out the slight creases on their features that indicated the distress they were trying to hide.
The Gryffindors were so good at fucking with people, getting them to do everything for their own gain and then turning their heads away when they’d bite and and tear off said poor person’s head.
I felt fine tremors rake down the length of my spine, each inhale and exhale shaking out of the quivering of my mouth as I felt a buzz of adrenalized anticipation seep its way into my bones.
as my own collided with his, the air getting knocked out of my lungs as the Assassin’s eyes drank me in from head to toe with a slow descent. The color of his eyes were rich and damning with the way he soaked in every nuance my body made as I danced on top of his lap in time with the song playing around us.
I chuckled roughly as I blew out the tousled locks of my pitch black hair away from my eyes so I could watch with dark bemusement at the way Draco’s eyelids snapped open and a whine bubble out of his feeble throat, grey eyes stricken and unfocused, right when I dropped all his weight down over my prick and drove straight into him to press the tip of my cock right against his quaking prostate.
Harry woke with a gasp. He was so lost in the memory of Draco Malfoy that it took him a minute to realize where he was: The Gryffindor boys dormitory. It was the middle of the night and his roommates were still sleeping (thank god they were still sleeping.) It was just a dream. A wave of humiliation rushed over him. This doesn’t mean anything, he told himself. It’s your subconscious fucking with you again.
“Look, I don’t want you to take this the wrong way… But we could both learn a thing or two from Malfoy,” she said, patting Harry on the shoulder. Before Harry could argue, she walked past him, up the stairs and into the girl’s dormitory. In a strange way, it felt more like a breakup and their actual breakup.
“Hi,” was all Harry managed. Malfoy didn’t respond. He just stared at Harry with that same electricity as before. Harry took a step forward.
“And you turned it down because you missed being a schoolboy. That’s so depressing,” Malfoy said, grinning from ear to ear.
is what you choose to do with it?” Malfoy picked up Harry’s quill, twirling it around between his long fingers. “If I were you I’d be traveling the world, seducing groupies! What a waste.”
“I didn’t pass the NEWTS.”. Harry took this in. It was strange: nothing between them was off limits when it came to insults, but they didn’t
“What is it?” Harry asked. Draco was clearly mad at himself for starting this. He rolled his eyes and took another swig of the firewhiskey, preparing himself.
“Look, I know we’re not each other’s favorite person, but -” before Harry could finish, Malfoy gathered his books and swiftly walked past him, completely ignoring him. He didn’t say a single word as he left the library, leaving a stunned Harry behind him.
“Mr. Potter, I know you’ve dealt with horrors well beyond your years. Now that you’re of age I’m sure having a curfew seems silly. However, you
“Do you want me to stop?” He whispered. Harry shuddered, staring down at him with desperation. The sight of Draco hovering over him, teasing him, was almost enough to send him over the edge. Harry slowly shook his head, practically begging for his touch.
“That’s not - you know what?! Forget it! I’m not gonna do this with you!” Harry said, throwing his hands in the air and turning away from him.
“Well what about Parvati’s cousin with the feet? That’s not a sex thing!” Harry said defensively. Hermione opened her mouth to say something and raised her hand slightly, almost as if she were back in a classroom. Instead, she brought her hand to her mouth and looked at Harry as if he were a poor, dickensian beggar child.
Lust coursed through Harry as he clawed at his back, Draco biting his neck. He shoved Harry against the wall, pressing himself against him, and he eagerly arched into his touch. Harry was hard, desperately hard. He bucked against Draco’s erection as Draco moaned into his neck, eagerly reciprocating. The feeling was overwhelming; if they continued like this for much longer Harry was sure he’d come in his pants. He didn’t want that to happen yet.
“Hey, I know. You don’t have to explain anything to me,” Harry said gently. Draco didn’t look at him, but his shoulders relaxed, his breath steadied. Harry desperately wanted to touch him. His eyes lingered from Draco’s face down to his hands. He noticed a faint pink scar on his white skin. It started at his knuckle and disappeared into his sweater. With a sinking heart, Harry realized it was most likely from the spell he cast their sixth year. Memories of Draco bleeding on the floor of the bathroom filled his head.
“Harry my boy! I heard you’d be joining us for detention. Can’t keep out of trouble, eh?” Harry barely looked at him, but Slughorn didn’t notice.
No one was quite sure how it happened, but a Kobold (aka a sex boggart) found its way inside Hogwarts. So far no one had been caught in it, but the professors were well aware of its presence. They had hoped to contain it before the news reached the students or the students parents, but there was no such luck. Sure, it may not have been as dangerous as dementors or death eaters, but a “freaky sex boggart” in a school full of teenagers was dangerous in its own right.
“I’m sorry I was out past curfew. I just needed to clear my head a bit,” he said. After dreaming about Malfoy Harry decided to go for a walk around the school, totally forgetting that he was technically a student with a curfew. Peeves ratted him out instantly, and he was too tired to even bother hiding. The only thing more depressing than an adult with a curfew was an adult concerned about losing house points.
“Hermione’s right,” Harry interjected. “Not everybody fantasizes about sex.” Ron stared at him, dumbfounded. Even Hermione gave him an incredulous look.
“You’ll have plenty of time to clear your head in detention next week,” McGonagall said. Harry laughed.
“This is familiar, isn’t it?” Professor McGonagall sat at what used to be Dumbledore’s desk, in what used to be Dumbledore’s office. She was Headmistress now, Harry knew that, but he couldn’t bring himself to think of it as anything other than Dumbledore’s office.
“Yeah, that’s what I want, too! But I don’t know how we’re supposed to do that if we avoid talking to each other.”
“What do you do to cope?” Harry asked. Draco snorted back a laugh. He reached into his robes and pulled out a flask, giving it a quick shake. Harry gave him a disapproving look.
“Hell, I died and I still have to take them.” Draco snorted back a laugh, but quickly wiped the smile from his face.
Harry’s heart leapt in his chest when he and Malfoy made eye contact. Malfoy stared back, his shock turning into defiance. There was a hint on anger in his grey eyes, but something else too. Something intense, electric. Something Harry couldn’t quite place.
He thought he had successfully hidden away the broken parts of himself. Even Ron and Hermione didn’t know the details, not really. Nobody knew that on Halloween, Harry nearly drank himself to death. He had decided not to go to any parties and instead drank alone at Grimmauld place. It was the anniversary of his parents death, which of course made him think about the death of all the other loved ones in his life: Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, the list went on. It was so easy for one drink to turn into two, for two to turn into five, for five to turn into who knows how many. It turns out that alcohol poisoning wasn’t just a muggle thing.
“You wish,” Pansy smirked at him. “Now get out of here so you can bring me some food on your way back. I’m starving.”
Draco’s life became a blur, days swimming from one to the next. He was invited to live out the days before the wedding on royal grounds and his parents had him packed and in a carriage before Draco could center himself enough to graciously refuse. The castle was airy and lavishly decorated, a veritable sea of marble and filigree, nothing like the dreary dungeon Riven had described. Draco’s rooms were equally beautiful, with large windows and dark wooden furniture, the carpets deep enough to sink one’s toes in.
Ron reached out as if to pat his hand, but pulled back awkwardly at the last moment. “Are you… going to be ok?”
“Staples,” Malfoy says out of the blue. He looks like he regrets his volume, and it occurs to Harry that he probably feels just as uncomfortable. This is the first time they’ve spoken beyond polite greetings in four years, and neither is sure what to expect. It makes Harry feel better, somehow, to know that he’s not the only one feeling utterly wrongfooted.
The wizarding world at large thinks it will happen somewhere dignified, like a Ministry ball or perhaps the Atrium. People expect it to be public— even Ron and Hermione have mentioned crowded venues with pointed looks. Everyone argues that one of them will make a scene, get the cameras flashing if only to show one another off a bit. Mrs. Weasley seems particularly set on something grand. She missed out with Bill, Percy, Ron and Ginny, so she’s set on Harry. After all these years she still hasn’t realized that she doesn’t know him quite as well as she thinks she does.
Harry frowns, his discomfort dissipating. “Yeah, in the supply closet. But we just use Sticking Charms— don’t you?”
Harry was gone. Draco found out from Charlie, the town baker, who had given him an apologetic look and told him the traveler had stopped using the spare room in their shop over a month ago. Draco just nodded and tried to ask for the bread he’d been sent to get, but his cracking voice gave him away. Charlie took one look at him and sent him home with a free bag and a short pat on the back.
Harry’s just getting on a roll with his embarrassed self-loathing when there’s a knock on his door. He sighs and prepares himself for some form of chewing out before he opens it.
Harry lets him lead from there, and they wander together deeper into the maze of bushes. He takes Draco’s hand and Draco winds their fingers together mindlessly. Harry’s palm is sweaty, but it’s still nice. The wisteria runs alongside them and overhead, and somewhere he can smell jasmine. There used to be a tree of the sweet flowers around here years ago but Draco has trouble believing it’s survived this long. There’s no hope of finding it even if it is still growing— there’s nothing to see but the path branching off in all directions, each turn disappearing into the shrubbery.
A good place to start, indeed. And when he climbs over the glass so Harry can clutch him closer, it gets even better.
“I’m fine,” Harry said again. He wasn’t sure who he was trying to reassure—Ron hadn’t asked. “Er, silly mistake, that.” He laughed woodenly.
“Nothing, that’s not the point,” his voice tinged with frustration. “I need— I came here to ask you again. I’ve already talked to your parents about this and I— Draco, I’m in love with you. I truly am. We know each other now. You can’t use that against me. I know you, and I am in love with you. You know me now too, so I am asking you one final time before I let go of this foolish fantasy I’ve been holding onto. Will you marry me?”
“I’ve missed you,” Draco said as he neared them, a soft smile quirking his thin lips. “Should we get lunch today?” Harry, so floored by the positive attention after his disaster the day before—Draco
“Where’s the fun in that, Potter?” Malfoy said skeptically, just before the bus jolted forward and Harry had to put a hand up to catch Malfoy’s arse as he fell a couple steps down the steep stairs.
When Riven returned at dawn on the fourth day Draco met him outside. He reminded himself that he should have been happy in the moments of his impending engagement. He smiled but could not make himself meet Riven’s earnest gaze.
“I can’t help it!” Harry groaned. “He’s—he’s always here, and he’s just—look at him, Ron, he’s everything!” Harry sank a little lower in his chair. “He’s never even looked at me.”
“Do you think,” Harry finally gasped, “we should—should still go to the—” he gave up when Draco took his lip between his teeth, content to press him up harder against the wall and rock their hips together. Draco moaned at the contact, and Harry took the opportunity to kiss the soft skin of his neck.
“...Pumpkin,” Draco mumbles, utterly mortified. Harry chokes on a surprised laugh. He looks delighted by the name, and Draco isn’t even surprised. Of course Draco likes a guy who thinks Pumpkin is a suitable name for a cat.
“I don't want you to be,” Draco whispered, and the resulting rush of happiness was so unexpected it made Harry giddy.
“Make that two hours each and tea,” Draco said with a raised eyebrow. It made him look sweet in a huffy sort of way. “I get off in ten minutes.”
“Can I take you to dinner?” Harry asks. He’s not sure where to go from here, but he knows he’d love to have dinner with Malfoy, so it seems like a good place to start.
Ron seemed to understand, regardless of the words left unsaid. He grinned at Harry and toasted with his eggnog. “To you and Malfoy.”
Ron frowned. “Er, don’t think so. Smith’s been nosing around though. I think he asked him once or twice, but Malfoy said no.” He turned to Harry quickly, eyes alight with a sudden stroke of inspiration. “Let’s write it tonight! Slip it in his pocket or something, yeah?”
“No,” he suddenly whines, and it’s so unexpected that Harry almost loses his balance and falls right on top of him. “They’re mine,
“Fine, fine,” he grumbled, taking care not to hit any boxes as he clambered down to kneel by his friend. “And you wouldn’t dare. Mother would flay you alive.”
“What?” He didn’t sound angry, just confused. It was like Harry had said the wrong line in a play, leaving Malfoy without a cue to follow.
“I heard you were looking for me.” Harry spun around to see Draco Malfoy leaning gracefully against the wall. There was amusement in his grey eyes, as if he was about to let Harry in on a particularly juicy secret.
“That’s not fair, why couldn’t there have been a freaky sex boggart set when we were at Hogwarts?!” Ron said, stabbing at his food. Hermione rolled her eyes, though more out of amusement than real annoyance.
“I want to know! Where do you plan on going?” Harry asked. Draco sighed and stared at the ceiling, overwhelmed by the question.
“I just thought if I had a routine, I could stop thinking about the war. Hogwarts is familiar, so I thought if I came back then things could go back to normal, but…” He stopped talking. His heart was racing. He was shaking, sweating. He tried to take deep breaths, but his breath was weak and hollow. He lowered his fists to his sides and scratched at the wood of the bench, needing something to cling to.
“Yes, what’s it like being back? Do you think the classroom setting is helping you prepare for your NEWTS?” Hermione asked.
“Oh,” he said, sheepishly holding up the flask. He stood up and walked over to Slughorn, handing him the flask. Slughorn took it and poured the remaining firewhiskey into his goblet.
“Shut up.” He handed Harry the flask. Harry was apprehensive, considering the last time he drank. Still, he took a swig. The firewhiskey burned his throat as he swallowed, and the sweet buzzing in his head was already starting.
It was strange seeing him without Crabbe and Goyle. He looked smaller, more vulnerable. Something about his tired, sullen eyes made Harry think post war life wasn’t treating him very well, either.
Harry stilled them, staring into his eyes. Draco’s cheeks were flushed, and his eyes were so dilated they almost looked black. Harry was in awe. He placed his hand on Draco’s flushed cheek, tracing his thumb along his swollen bottom lip. Not to be outdone, Draco took Harry’s thumb into his mouth, sucking, swirling his tongue around it. Harry groaned, rutting his hips against him. He dug his fingers into Draco’s soft hair and crashed their lips together when -
Harry stood frozen in place. The silence between them was painful, filled only by the crackling of the fireplace. Harry had spent weeks wondering about Malfoy: Did the war mess with his head the way it messed with Harry’s? Did he have the same nightmares that Harry did? Did he regret joining Voldemort’s side? Had he changed? Now that it was all over, did he feel directionless and empty, or did he feel free?
“You’re not,” Draco whispered. Harry’s heart caught in his chest. There was nothing he wanted more than to unload his pain, but god was it terrifying.
“So what was it about life after Hogwarts that was just too much?” Malfoy asked in his smooth, aristocratic voice. “Were you not coddled enough after defeating the Dark Lord? You craved being hero worshiped so much you had to surround yourself with adoring schoolgirls? That’s pathetic even for you.”
“What are you talking about?!? Did you forget to put ‘defeated the dark lord’ on your resume?! I can’t believe you weren’t hired on the spot -” he stopped, thinking. The realization finally dawned on him.
“Why are you here?” Malfoy finally said, not even bothering to turn to face him. His voice was smooth but strong. Harry had almost forgotten how posh he sounded.
“Everyone wants me to be happy, but I don’t know how. My entire life has been tied to his, and I don’t know what to do with myself now that he’s gone,” Harry said, his voice hollow. It was the first time he admitted this to anyone. He shook his head and laughed bitterly. He drank more of the firewhiskey, desperate to numb his own shame.
“I’m not gay,” he blurted out. Draco paused, one eyebrow raised. Harry continued, “I - I mean, not really. If I am I’m only half gay.”
Harry nodded, unenthusiastically picking at his food. It was the first Hogsmeade weekend after Christmas, and the first weekend Harry has seen Ron and Hermione since he decided to return to Hogwarts.
“I thought you did?” Harry said, this time gently. Malfoy avoided eye contact, pausing before answering.
“Poor Potter. I guess the rumors about you were true after all,” he said as he followed Harry. He didn’t respond. He tried to control his breathing. He clenched his fists. He avoided reaching for his wand, though it was tempting. Hexing Malfoy wouldn’t do much to convince people he didn’t belong at St. Mungos.
“No, of course not, but I’m not even asking for his time! I just want…” he paused, trying to find the words, “I don’t know, closure?”
“It’s not a ‘sex boggart,’ it’s a Kobold. And it forces you to fulfill your wildest fantasy, which is not always sexual, but…” she paused, glancing at Ron. He gave her a quick wink and Hermione blushed, a flirtatious smile on her face. Harry pretended not to notice.
with the characters! It’s crazy, I thought muggle photographs didn’t move, but the movement in movies is - it’s amazing! I had no idea muggles were so creative!” Draco spoke with feverish excitement, moving his hands, leaning close to him as he spoke. Harry was so used to his cold, cruel demeanor that he almost couldn’t believe this was the same Draco Malfoy.
“I wasn’t planning on doing this, but since we’re here…I just want you to know that I didn’t want him to die,” he finally said. Harry furrowed his brows.
“Let’s change the subject!” Ron said quickly. “Is there anyone else from our year who’s back at Hogwarts?”
“It’s been a while since you’ve had a curfew, hasn’t it?” She asked him, her tone gentler this time. Harry let out a soft, bitter chuckle.
. Italy, Japan, Iceland, Thailand, I don’t even know! Once I pass my NEWTS I and I get access to my trust fund, I’m out of here! I’ll live somewhere where no one knows who I am and I’ll never look back!” He said this with an energy and excitement Harry hadn’t seen in him before. He couldn’t help but smile.
When Harry opened his eyes, he was alone in his bed. The dream was over, he was back in his dormitory and his sheets were a mess. He cast a quick cleaning spell, then laid back and stared at the ceiling of his four poster bed. He knew in the morning he’d be overwhelmed by shame and guilt. He knew he’d have to ask himself questions he’s never asked before, he’d have to examine whatever this meant between him and Malfoy, and grapple with what that ultimately meant about him.
“Fuck you, that’s not funny!” Draco said, still laughing. Harry laughed with him. Draco snatched the flask from Harry and took a drink. The smile on his lips faded. Silence followed.
“Is that all you want?” He whispered. Arousal shot through Harry as Draco’s hot breath lingered on his ear. He could barely piece together what was happening before Draco placed a soft, wet kiss against his earlobe. Harry gasped, his body shivering, his breath heavy. He felt Draco smile against his skin as he traced kisses along his neck. Harry let out a soft moan, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck, drawing him in closer.
“Fuck you,” Harry snapped at him. Malfoy smirked, clearly pleased that he could still get under his skin.
“Fantastic. I won’t be long,” Slughorn said, hastily making his way out the door. Harry neither knew nor cared why Slughorn was in such a rush to leave the two of them alone. All he knew was that less than 48 hours ago Harry dreamt about Malfoy grinding against him and moaning wantonly, and now he had an unsupervised detention with him. Malfoy’s eyes burned into him, daring him to say something. Harry wasn’t going to take the bait. He sat down at a desk several rows away, hoping the distance would ease his thoughts.
However, when he ran into Draco Malfoy in the library, they were alone. Draco had found himself a secluded spot by a fireplace, hidden behind towering bookshelves. Harry had stumbled across him completely by accident, and tried to quietly back out. Malfoy was buried in his schoolwork and hadn’t seen him, but when turning to leave, Harry knocked over a stack of books. Startled, Draco jerked out of his book, his eyes locked on Harry’s.
“It’s hilarious! Absolutely brilliant!” Draco continued. “You must see it if you get the chance! I mean, really, we were so wrong about muggles! They make the best art. The
The last time Harry had a wet dream was during his sixth year. And, what a coincidence, it had been about Malfoy. He tried to himself back then that it didn’t mean anything; it was his subconscious conflating things; it didn’t make him gay, and even if it did it didn’t mean he was gay for Malfoy.
“N-nothing, we -,” Harry was interrupted by Slughorn chuckling to himself and shaking his head, a knowing glint in his eye.
“Can we please get back to talking about this sex boggart?!” Harry said, desperate to break the tension. Ron laughed into his Butterbeer, and Hermione slapped him on the arm for a second time.
“So because you saved his life, he now owes you his time?” Harry stopped, surprised by Ginny’s statement.
“Uh, It’s alright.” Harry was no longer shaking, but he kept his fist clenched close to his side. Draco Malfoy had just tried to hold his hand. Whatever script they had been following earlier, it was completely behind them, now.
information about their personal lives. It wasn’t a big deal that Malfoy didn’t pass his NEWTS, Harry didn’t care. But it was clearly a sore spot for Malfoy, and the fact he willingly admitted this to him caught him off guard.
He quickly took the flask and downed a shot, flustered. Draco edged away from him, as if the touch had stung. There was a flush to his cheeks; Harry wondered if it was from embarrassment or if Draco was feeling the same whirlwind of emotions as him. The alcohol buzzed in his head. Any shame or embarrassment he felt before seemed so stupid to him now.
The weight of Dumbledore’s absence was heavy. He looked around the office, noticing small changes here and there that McGonagall had made. However, he noticed a red Phoenix feather at her desk, and Harry knew that he wasn’t the only one carrying the weight.
The rain gently tapped against the windows and soft candlelight flickered on the walls. The piano music was sultry but subtle, and Harry wished he could stay in this room forever. Harry looked up and saw Draco Malfoy lounging on the absurd four poster bed. His white shirt was halfway unbuttoned, exposing his chest and collarbone. The bed was sprinkled with rose petals. Draco picked up a rose and twirled it lazily with his fingers, giving Harry a seductive grin.
“I mean it’s weird that the guy who defeated the dark lord can’t... defeat detention. Why even bother coming back?” Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat, avoiding Malfoy’s gaze.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about,” He muttered. He stood up and stalked to the back of the room, desperate for some distance from Malfoy.
“Good good. Now, er,” Slughorn leaned closer to Harry, “I trust if I leave for a few minutes and come back by the end of detention, you two will still be here? I’ve got some errands to attend to.”
For weeks they managed to avoid each other. They had no classes together, and the only time they were ever in the same room was during meals in the Great Hall, surrounded by other students. Harry figured they’d go the whole semester never interacting, and he convinced himself that’s what he wanted.
Harry dug his fingers painfully into Draco’s hair as he thrust into his mouth. The sounds of Draco gagging and moaning as Harry thrust into him filled his ears. For a moment he worried he was hurting him, but the sight of Draco touching himself as Harry face fucked him confirmed Draco was enjoying this just as much as he was. The sight was so beautiful Harry had completely forgotten this wasn’t real. With a cry he came into Draco’s mouth, his eyes shut, his member pulsing on Draco’s tongue.
“Maybe if someone showed Voldemort ‘Baby’s Day Out’ the war could’ve been avoided,” Harry said. Draco burst into laughter. Pride swelled in Harry’s chest. Draco’s laugh was beautiful.
Harry shouted, finally losing it. The sneer from Malfoy’s face vanished. He no longer looked like he was having fun; he looked shocked.
“Ok, so last summer, Pansy got this - this muggle device. And she played me this thing called a movie,” Draco said, his face lighting up. “It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen before! It’s like a play, but - but you’re not sitting far away from the actors! Sometimes you’re really up close to them! But then other times, you’re really far away! It - it’s so
Harry was mortified. Exhausted, he sat on a bench in the back of the classroom. He hung his head and ran his fingers through his hair, trying to calm down.
Malfoy then snapped out of it, glancing at the other Slytherins, almost like he was checking to make sure no one saw him. While the others were still gossiping about Harry’s return, Malfoy swiftly gathered his things and left. He didn’t look back.
“It’s called ‘Baby’s Day Out.’” Harry bit back a laugh. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting, but it definitely wasn’t Baby’s Day Out.
“Parvati told me her cousin got stuck with a coworker, and they couldn’t leave the room until the coworker licked her feet.” Ron’s eyes widened as he went pale.
“No. This is a dream. I don’t have to do this.” Draco slowly sat up, as if he were a predator stalking his prey. He reached over to Harry’s waist and looped his fingers through the belt loops of Harry’s pants. He pulled him closer, so his face was aligned with Harry’s crotch.
The first time Harry saw Draco Malfoy was in the Great Hall. Even in a room full of Hogwarts students, Harry would recognize that shock of blonde hair anywhere. He was eating breakfast at the Slytherin table, but he wasn’t really with them: he avoided eye contact, ignored their conversations. He just sat amongst them, like a chameleon trying to blend in with his surroundings.
“Shut up,” he said as he rolled his eyes, angry at himself for breaking. He turned away from Harry and buried himself in his homework. Harry grinned.
“Of course not,” He said, a knowing smile on his lips. Then, his drunk courage getting the best of him, he winked. Draco rolled his eyes and smiled, shaking his head. He took another drink and handed the flask back to Harry. As Harry reached over to take it, his fingers brushed against Draco’s. Their eyes met, and a jolt of arousal shot through Harry.
“Since it’s your first offense of the year, I’ll go easy on you. I’m deducting twenty points from Gryffindor, and giving you a week of detention.”
The room was lit by soft candlelight, and rain gently tapped against the windows. The faint sound of jazz piano played in the background, though Harry wasn’t sure from where. The only thing in the room was a giant four poster bed, the sheets covered in… were those rose petals?
Harry’s voice was sharp and filled with a vicious timbre, causing my spine to go tingle and a heat to suffice low in my quivering abdomen as the harsh lines of his green eyes flashed with a shadowed hue. “That’s something for you to keep your nose out of.”
The quake in my elbows as I held my upper torso up with them was immense, the weakness of my limbs displaying themselves out into the open with the ridiculous amount of tremors that shook my frame from the sudden drained energy that collapsed inside of me.
I felt my face get so hot that I thought I was overheating, and with my pride high and swelling, I turned my face further away from Harry to look off into the opposite side from where he stood, cheeks puffing up as I pouted like a damn child.
“I’ll have you know that I’ve lived thousands of years and the conduits I’ve eaten over the years weren’t as old as you were. But
I looked like the desperate virgin I was. I had to be collected,and calm. I wanted to show Harry that I can control myself when I’m around him-
Something seemed off about Kingsley the first time he entered my apartment. Usually the man was all about citizen’s rights and would have waited for me to grant him permission to come into my room. And he would have kept a good distance away from me. Right now, he kept edging toward me like a snake, eyes flashing like headlights.
My heart thudded furiously beneath my chest, a dark whisper of prickling energy buzzing like livewire beneath my flesh as a sort of sick joy bubbled within the low pit of my gut.
“That was fucking adorable, Princess. Tell me what you were going to say, hmm?” The vibrato of Harry’s low tone caused a keen to rip of my my open mouth, the assassin’s body weighing me down and intimidating as the heat of his words flitted across the shell of my ear teasingly, making my arse perch up and press firmly against the hard of Harry’s large cock.
Sirius whipped his head down towards his boyfriend, his eyebrows rising high and the the black of his eyes searching Caetia’s. He looked as if he was about to protest but Caetia prevented his boyfriend’s words with his own. “Let it happen, babe. I think it’s a
Maybe I moved around too much last night and hit my neck on something hard enough to bruise myself? That made a lot more sense. I had the tendency to flail about in my sleep.
Turning swiftly on my feet, my trench coat wrapped around my figure as I pushed the impending memories into the far, dark corners of my head and rushed over to Andrew’s office, my breath quickening in time with the fast pace of my heart beating like a drum against my chest.
“You know that I can take care of myself, especially with my own magic, and you even said a little chaos would do good for me,” I whispered softly to Harry, my lashes lowering over my gaze as I stared up at him with a pleading cadence evident in my large gaze.
Numerous wide hallways tethered from each other in different directions, black doors lined against one another. The place looked like a dungeon induced maze, fluorescent lighting showing long lengths of the hallways, gold plated numbers etched into the front of the doors.
“Well,” Malfoy starts, but seems to realize he doesn’t have a leg to stand on. “Well— you like my hair.”
“Did you need something, Potter?” Draco asked suddenly. He dropped a rounded stone into the blue potion and gave a quick swirl with his glass rod. “I’m a bit busy at the moment. They need this analysis done in an hour, and the potassium only just arrived.”
“Are you worried he’s going to cause trouble?” Ron asks. His voice sounds different, and when Harry glances at him again he’s got both feet slung over the armrest of his chair. Robards will skin him alive if he sees.
Draco jumped at Ron’s screech, hitting his head on the corner of Harry’s chin, and they both groaned.
“Fine. Don’t burn the market down.” Draco kissed Pansy’s cheek and ducked away when Blaise swung at him.
They regard one another for a couple seconds, coming to the same quick decision. Harry takes the few steps separating them, and now Draco can smell the tang of sweat and aftershave, and he has to consciously stop himself from licking his lips. Harry takes another step, closer than strictly necessary for cat transferral, but this offers Draco the chance to see that his eyes are actually brilliant green and not the blue he’d once thought. They’re framed by thick, dark lashes under wire-rimmed glasses.
“There is,” Harry cut in. “But it’s painfully cliché.” He raised his eyebrow and his eyes flashed down to Draco’s lips. Draco flushed.
“You do know what we call it when water falls from the sky, don’t you Potter? You know we stay inside when that happens?”
“Shut it. Like you’re the epitome of elegance.” Harry pauses to consider that. “Well, you are actually. Bugger.” They grin at one another. A butterfly flutters past and Draco watches as it lands in a patch of lavender, its yellow wings stark against the flowers.
“An illness, of sorts,” she murmured. “Of magical origin, but not quite a curse. As far as I am aware there isn’t a... cure, I suppose. Charms to slow its effects would be appreciated.”
“Please, Draco. I could never be angry with you, I only want to help. Whatever that means, whatever you need.”
He’ll tell Potter just a little later, about the bond and their relationship. For now, Draco just lets himself be held by his mate, sinking into the feeling of wholeness, of completion. It’s enough, now that he has a chance at forever.
“I despise every word of that. He’s just shy!” Draco hissed. “We’ve only spoken a few times and he was not ‘making a move,’ he was only being polite. Not that you would know anything about that.”
“Mate, what the fuck?” Harry hissed, hands cupped protectively over his jaw. He glanced surreptitiously at the group huddled around Savage’s desk, but Draco was still frowning down at his papers, entirely unaware of the quiet commotion in their corner of the office.
Dean twisted his neck to look at the spot from a different angle. “It doesn’t look very balanced to me. That white dot is far too tiny.”
Draco stood up from where he’d been sitting in the waiting area outside the Head Auror’s office. He’d had a short meeting before Harry’s in which Robards had promised him compensation for all lost property and a small bonus. Harry wasn’t sure why he’d waited, however. A large part of him wished it was out of concern, but the more likely scenario was that he wanted to see Harry get his.
Draco can’t look away from him. “What?” he breathes. He must have heard wrong. “Potter, you—you don’t like me.” That’s the only thing Draco can focus on. A certainty he’s built all of his pain on.
“Well, you did buy me cat food,” Draco jokes. Tries to. “It’ll make us even—” but then he really thinks about what Harry said, and it couldn’t have been unintentional, it absolutely couldn’t have, not with the way Harry’s looking so crestfallen at his refusal. The wild, plague-ridden universe is finally blessing him, and Draco’s not going to fuck it up. Hopefully. “Or. Or instead— we can watch it together?”
“The general public doesn’t share your opinions, Potter,” Draco said snidely. He looked pointedly out the window. “Besides, I wouldn’t want the Ministry’s Golden Boy to freeze to death on a bus.”
“If I don’t see you in half an hour I’m sending a search party,” she says firmly, hitching up her skirt.
Friday dawned cold, rainy, and miserable, but Harry woke with fresh expectations. If Draco had indeed read his letter, he’d know by the end of today. Harry hoped he’d at least have the decency to speak to him in person about it, but Draco’s statement would be clear no matter what path he chose. He only worried over the fact that Draco was taking so long to approach him, not giving even the slightest indication that he’d received Harry’s invitation.
“Too bad, you already thanked me.” Ron plucked a final twig out and ruffled Harry’s hair for good measure, before hopping up to sit next to him on the desk. He held out the plate of pies, and Harry took one morosely.
“You heard Hermione,” Pansy leaned forward, sounding as earnest as he’d ever heard her. “Go talk to him.”
“No! No, it’s not that,” even though Draco rushed to say it, he didn’t think to lie. Riven had not yet shown a cruel or unlikable side. “Like I’ve said, I simply don’t know you, Your Highness. I cannot marry someone I’ve never even held a conversation with.”
like he was interested in the bus—the bus that was meant to carry them far, far away from one another. Eventually. After a half-hour ride, of course.
“How are you?” Potter asks, like nothing’s wrong, like the last time Draco heard his voice he wasn’t coming in Draco’s mouth.
“I’m sorry,” Draco winced. “My answer is the same. I can’t say that I know you after a single afternoon spent in your company.”
“Still an Auror, Potter?” he asked, joining Harry as they started back towards the Consultancy Department.
All in all, Harry felt optimistic about the start of his day, and not entirely hopeless about his chances. He walked through the Atrium with a spring in his step, and hummed quietly in the half-empty elevator until an old witch shot him a glare.
Savage chose that moment to step up behind Harry, slapping him soundly on the back. “Morning, Potter,” she said, and her tone, while not entirely sympathetic, was close enough to pity that Harry once again began to suspect the worst. “Er, just heard about Malfoy and Smith. That’s a real shame there, that is. Ah, don’t dwell on it too much, yeah? Do some good work, relax this weekend.” She gave him what he thought was an effort at a reassuring smile before wandering back over to her own desk.
They eventually pulled apart, however, both panting and lips swollen. Harry kept their noses touching, sharing the same air and still running his hands over every part of Draco he could reach, but slower now. When he straightened Draco rested his cheek against his stomach, and Harry’s arms cradled his head.
“I worked hard on my tits,” she complained. “And he doesn’t even care? What’s so wonderful about Draco? He’s so
Harry had never unzipped that quickly in his life. He held the edges open, and Draco turned around to eye him before he hummed in satisfaction and leaned in against Harry’s chest. His head landed on Harry’s shoulder, his forehead pressed against the side of Harry’s neck, and Harry hurried to wrap his jacket as far around Draco as it would go.
“Are we seeing the same story right now?” Harry asks. He’s really not getting the reaction he wants— from himself or from Malfoy— and he just needs to be sure.
The roses sat among the bouquets, their deep red the brightest spot of color in the rain. Harry wanted Draco to have things like that—to have roses every morning he wanted them. To fill his  life and his house with things that showed him how much Harry cared. Things that would make his every moment brighter, that would remind him how much he meant to someone.
“I know you’ve changed,” Harry said firmly. “Malfoy. Look at me.” He did. “I know.” It was important to Harry that he knew— knew Harry appreciated the work he’d done, the time he’d taken to understand the world anew. “I don’t regret the past. Even if I don’t approve of the things we both did to get here, I don’t regret them. But I like knowing those times are over. I like seeing that.”
So today, a tedious December 5th, Draco was once more alone at the breakfast table. It was ordinary. It was downright dull. Yet still, he felt he was forgetting something.
“There have been rumors about the queen taking visits here during the festival,” Blaise said. “They say she likes to travel alone.”
A frappuccino, as it turns out, was worryingly expensive, melted frighteningly fast, and contained about as much coffee as it did caramel. But Harry felt immensely proud of himself while carrying it through the Atrium. Draco was usually such a paragon of good taste and luxury, that most people assumed he’d enjoy something more authentic, like one of those itty-bitty sipping coffees. Harry was the only one who fully appreciated Draco’s love for sugar. He tried not to smile in the lift.
The lifts on the Auror level were only one corridor down from the bullpen. Someone had already hung several thick strings of glowing baubles along the walls in preparation for Christmas. Harry worried about what the office would look like come December. It was a minor worry, of course, compared to his very real and very blond worry, which was currently stepping into the first lift.
“Ron’s correct, Harry,” Hermione said with a slight wince. She passed them each a bowl as she sat, but Harry noticed the delighted glint in her eye when she pointedly skipped Ms. Weasley’s Wizarding blessing in favor of just ladling out stew. “Dennis isn’t your problem. The problem is that you need to be a bit more subtle. Be traditional, but not overbearing—maybe give him something thoughtful. It’s a foolproof courting method—” Ron snorted “—but you can certainly be casual about it at the same time. You can articulate your feelings, and Draco has space to reject them tastefully if he chooses.”
Of course, those should have been his first clues. If Draco had thought a bit more about the future, he might have seen this coming. He might have built his own expectations, his own hopes and anxieties. He might have listened to everyone. He might have even planned something similar himself.
Needless to say, his mother wheedled out what had happened, and she told his father, and both let slip while Blaise was over, so Pansy naturally found out. His parents were a happy combination of shocked, delighted, disappointed (that he refused), and accepting of his reasoning. They had, after all, married for love, and they weren’t about to deny their son that freedom, even if it was costing them a position in the court. Blaise was ecstatic at Draco’s discomfort, and Pansy was suspicious and mildly put off by the “audacity and straightforwardness” of the prince.
Draco is grateful that that’s the moment Pansy gets them out of the ballroom and into the gardens, because he feels like he might sob, and the breath of night air is the only thing that keeps him together.
“What?” Harry finally looks away from Malfoy. “No. Ew. Of course not.” He says it far too blandly, like a child denying their love of sweets, and Ron gives him a Look. Harry tries (unsuccessfully) to change the subject. “What’s he doing with the— why did he— what’s… erm.”
Hermione, Harry decided, was both the largest advocate of active listening and simultaneously its worst practitioner. She had her head stuck in a file when he arrived on Floor One to fetch her for lunch, and she stayed glued to her paperwork all the way through the Ministry, oblivious to Harry’s inner turmoil.
“No, er, this is my first time out in like two weeks, to be honest.” Harry’s thrilled with the conversation, truly, but that news does get him a bit worried.
Draco had forgone his robes once again today in favor of trousers and a grey button up. But even under the pale Ministry lighting, against the faded backdrop, he looked so incredibly light and
With new determination, he made for the next— or third— best option. While the common room wasn’t ideal, at least he knew no unfortunate magical accident would have rendered it inaccessible.
“Yes, obviously. It’s quarantine, who doesn’t?” Sane people, that’s the answer. “Listen, what fruit do you have? Or— sorry, you probably don’t play AC, it’s kind of a childish game. Sorry.
The coming weeks followed in a similar miserable pattern. Since his previous subtle observation had long since become a thing of the past, Harry decided to throw himself into his makeshift effort at courtship with everything he had, hoping for some hint at reciprocation. Ron was in a state of despair—he’d erected a reinforced paper wall around his section of the desk in a bid for peace. When Robards came by and saw the towering contraption, he’d nodded solidly and gotten Ron a cup of grainy coffee from the canteen.
Malfoy shrugged against his shoulder. “It’s quiet. It was cheap at the time.” He smirked at Harry. “I could catch the bus out to Soho five days a week if it pleased me.”
“What is this?” His words had a precise bite to them, a careful weight on each syllable. Draco had not been expecting the low, honeyed tone, and though he certainly couldn’t place it, it lingered at the edge of his mind.
But the statement makes Potter frown. “I think I should be the one to decide that. And I do like you. I more than ‘like’ you, actually, which is why I can’t seem to talk to you unless I’m plastered.”
So Draco stopped imagining, and started to focus on the moments that are rather than the moments that will be. He lets himself marvel at Harry’s sleepy eyes in the morning, their dates in the park, their movies and dinners, Harry’s kisses and Harry’s voice, Harry’s laughter, Harry’s hand in his. He stresses his way through every fight, and works for the right words to apologize the same way Harry does: with dedication and a bit of sheepishness. For all Draco knows Harry does still fret over their future, but Harry’s allowed to do that just as Draco’s allowed not to, so he doesn’t ask. They share almost everything— and Draco loves that the most, the fact that Harry’s not only his lover but his closest friend— but this isn’t big enough to be shared. It’s just the way Draco is. It’s beautiful, really, because living this way has given him the space to just be with Harry, without worry or fear. He’s there in every moment, committing it all to memory, and he knows it’s when he stopped thinking about the ‘what if’s and the ‘when’s that he truly became happy. Happy in both their relationship and in life. Letting go this way is beautiful because it’s what let them fall in love.
Draco’s eyes were locked with his as Harry lifted the side of his own shirt. He could see the exact moment when confusion turned to shock and understanding. For a brief second, he swore Draco’s eyes lit up with— impossible, but how Harry wished— hope, but then his face twisted into something ugly.
“Wow, you’re a handful,” he blurts as soon as he hefts Pea up against his chest. Draco flushes. The vet insists Pea is healthy, but he weighs about 10 kilos and knows it. “What’s your name?”
In the end, though Narcissa protested, Riven did not stay for supper. He excused himself with all the elegance of a court socialite and left Narcissa beaming. Draco had never known she possessed so many white teeth. Of course, he was shooed to the door to see Riven off with numerous smirks and winks from his mother. He was sure he’d rather she just drop the pot of tea on his head.
Malfoy stops and stares at him. Opens his mouth, frowns a little. There’s a wonderful feeling in Harry’s chest.
Puzzlingly, Potter’s friends had been the only ones treating him decently since his trial. Besides that, he would never forget the sound of Granger’s screams.
Ron took a couple more seconds to stare, before he sighed in a way that let Harry know whatever was coming next was Draco-related.
“Those are only used for the royal family, though,” Pansy glanced up from her work. “Is something the matter?”
Malfoy’s distracting him— all part of his dastardly plans for Harry’s early demise, no doubt— but it only serves to remind Harry why he’s there. He slaps that week’s issue of the magazine on the empty expanse of glass.
“How have we never noticed?” Harry finally managed. His mind was in utter turmoil, but his voice was steady and surprisingly coherent. His mouth seemed to be taking over while he stared.
“Yes?” Potter quirks an eyebrow at him. “I think? If you mean the part where I date you, then yes, very. And the pun, only if you liked it. I’ve got more. Which I’m saving for the first date, assuming we have one.”
“Look,” Ron said, “give him a couple days. And don’t whine about it either. Just give it some time. You’ve got until Friday anyway.”
“That’s because it isn’t complete.” Harry regretted speaking the moment every face turned towards him once again.
“Do you suppose he had life insurance?” Seamus wondered. “Voldemort, I mean. Who do you think collected?”
“How would I know? He’s probably going down to Creatures. He’s the Potions Consultant on a Werewolf case, Harry, where do you
Draco pretends to mull that over while he lets the rush of happiness wash through him. It never fails to happen every time he hears Harry call their house ‘home’. “Not a chance, not without Mother there to plan it. We both hate weeding too much.”
That hurts. To think that he’s not even good enough for that. He desperately wishes Potter would leave. There’s nothing he can possibly want from Draco, unless it’s to humiliate him, and even Potter isn’t that cruel.
Malfoy gives him a slow once-over. “That’s an awful lot of shiny buckles for a casual visit.” He runs his tongue over his bottom lip. His mouth is painted cherry red today, and Harry tries not to think about smudging the rouge with his thumb (or his teeth).
With each successive failure, Harry grew both more determined and more dejected. He refused to confront the depth of his feelings, despite the growing worry that they were almost certainly unrequited. Ron periodically reminded him that he wouldn’t get a substantive answer unless he properly
“Oh,” Harry finally says. “Suppose that’s alright.” Malfoy’s still frowning, but he sets the magazine down at least. It occurs to Harry that he may have hurt Malfoy’s feelings, and that makes him feel rather terrible. “I mean, I’d like that. To go out. I like
“You always stare out here when we’re having dinner, and you get this look in your eyes— all wistful and poetic and stuff— and it’s, well...” Harry coughs and looks away. “Anyway, I asked your mum. She told me you liked it here.” Harry seems to have something more to say. He’s rocking a bit and biting his lips, his eyes darting over the flowers. Draco wants to tell him to spit it out, but he doesn’t feel like rushing Harry today. He waits.
“Just fuck traditionalism, I guess,” Dean’s comment brought Harry back to the game. “I've always thought Purebloods were more… conservative.”
Draco huffed from where he was standing on a stool at the edge of their small stall, still trying to peer over the crowd. The Solstice Festival brought droves of people from the surrounding provinces, and the markets would be full all week long. As the largest city in the Gryffindor, Godric’s Hollow was always brimming with both locals and travelers, but the summer and fall festivals brought a refreshing (or stifling) wave of villagers, noblemen, craftsman, wanderers, knights— the list was endless and ever expanding. Needless to say it was good for business.
Blaise shook his head. “People are too desperate to leave it up to fate. And Draco and I checked every Ministry list.”
“Potter, your jacket!” Draco helpfully pointed out, pain momentarily forgotten. “Take it off, Merlin, get your arms out!”
Harry gets a text from Draco around five thirty. He thoroughly denies that he’s spent the last two hours frantically stress-cleaning his entire flat and being eaten alive by nerves, but the notification does make him drop his phone once again.
“That’s lovely, Harry,” Hermione said. “Very thoughtful. Give it a few days so he’s not too focused on the, ah—”
“No, he means it literally.” Hermione seemed to have gotten her bearings again. “There's a second half to the symbol. It's a mark of duality.”
“Is she here?” The question was tentative, polite. Draco’s eyes flickered to Riven. He had not moved, but his gaze was sweeping over the crowds, his hand resting on the golden pommel of his sword.
“There’s no match in the records,” Draco spoke over her. “It's not that difficult to search. No one’s registered with the same mark.”
On Wednesday, Harry caught him staring once—a rare and noteworthy occasion—but Draco looked away before Harry could reassure himself that it was their desk Draco had really been looking at.
“Alright, Harry.” A weight slid off his shoulders at the comfortable name. “Why did you reveal yourself as Riven?”
Draco paused, still running a fingertip over the furl of a rosebud. “I don’t think it matters,” he said, “seeing as he would not have been there either.”
Harry didn’t bother replying to them. He kept his head face-down in the middle of his place-setting, right between the knife and fork. He felt quite a bit like the overboiled stew Hermione was serving tonight. Might as well act the part.
A gust of wind blew a cloud of thin rain under their small shelter and Harry felt Malfoy’s shiver all along his side. The prat hadn’t brought a jacket, and was sitting in a wide-necked grey jumper with his collarbones out for all of London to see. Indecent, really. They were far too tempting for wind and rain and wayward lips.
Reputable is a stretch. Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson have single handedly torn the tabloid industry to shreds and sculpted it into a beast of fashion-driven scandal. The press is their battlefield and
Harry was stunned. He’d prepared for rejection, ridicule, a potential destruction of the tentative friendship he and Draco had. If none of that, then he’d anticipated being ignored in the same way he had been the last couple days. He’d never once considered a worse option—that Draco might already have a date. One who was clearly interested in him, no less.
“What do you want?” Draco snapped. He immediately wanted to take it back, but the next second a pleasant blush was spreading across Potter’s cheeks, and Draco was disturbed to realize he rather loved the look of sheepish embarrassment on him.
Harry felt Draco’s laugh against his cheek more than he heard it. Draco stood, turning in Harry’s loose embrace so he could slip his arms into his coat and pull him closer.
“Or I can do that.” They grin at one another for a moment. “Right, where’s your remote? I’ll log on to Disney for you.”
“Picking currants, picking currants, have to pick my cur-rants,” Draco sings softly. Harry stares  at his boyfriend, vaguely wondering which one of them has finally gone ‘round the bend. With their combined cornucopia of issues they’ve singlehandedly paid for Healer Ashfield’s new summer home in Tuscany, so it’s well within the realm of possibilities.
The house was warm when Narcissa welcomed them inside with tears and smiles. Dinner was warm too, with far too much laughter and happiness hanging heavy like perfume on the air. Riven was warm when he hugged Draco by the door, whispering goodbye and his love.
Harry, who at this point was firmly pinned as the doors dragged his jacket higher and higher up the wall, tried to do so. His cuffs, however, remained buttoned, and refused to let him slip away.
Draco hadn’t registered when Riven had taken his hands, but he was holding them tightly now, like he was scared Draco would run. It wasn’t an undeserved worry. Draco felt like he very well could run.
“Oh.” Harry turns back to watch Malfoy shake Robards’ hand. Robards' grip is strong, and his thick fingers nearly engulf Malfoy’s delicate wrist. Harry doesn’t like that.
“Thought you surely must have died by now, Harry,” he said as he took in the familiar smile hidden behind a tidy beard. It was indeed harder to see with the heavy hood and cloak over the man’s dark hair, but Draco had always liked a bit of a mystery.
It turns out to be quite awkward to kiss someone when they don’t kiss back. It’s dry and still and Draco kind of hates himself but he’s also really fucking excited because he did it, he
The doors to his office were warded, as was every entrance in the DMLE, but Harry disabled the alarm system with a bit of fiddly Auror-grade spellwork and slipped inside.
A couple hours might have been optimistic. When they reached the open door of Draco’s lab, Harry had to take a step back. Whatever had been in the cauldron seemed to have
Harry felt his lips twitch at that. “I just remember a time when you wouldn’t think twice about homelessness and Muggles. It’s good to know things have changed.”
His eyes grew dull. He lay awake night after night, his body exhausted but his mind spinning. Draco went a whole day without smiling, and the next he skipped two meals. His mother noticed but said nothing. He knew Riven would see it soon, but Draco refused to be the first to admit something was wrong. He’d promised himself to try and he was going to. Draco could keep this act up until it stopped being a farce, until he really was in love.
“Ron, please,” Hermione snapped. “Harry’s having a hard time. Show some empathy. And if you can’t, fake it,” she added when he made to argue.
“I suppose it’s passable,” Draco said. Ron snorted, and whispered something about Harry liking things bitter as he threw back the rest of his eggnog. “I was actually hoping to speak to you—in private, possibly?”
He would have thought Harry would react to haven his past words thrown in his face but he barely shifted. “You say the prince was here? Riven?”
“Yes, that. But let us know how it goes. We just want you to be happy, Harry.” Hermione said it with such a tender look that Harry forgot for a moment that this was the woman who’d once driven Kingsley Shacklebolt to tears over a legislative footnote.
“Are you sure? You don’t seem— Harry?” Harry’s letting go of his hands now, and Draco watches with wide eyes as he sinks down to one knee. He knows what’s happening, somewhere deep down he understands, but he can’t do anything except stare. “You— what are you doing?”
As days went, there wasn’t much to distinguish this one by. It was a mundane and predictably tedious set of hours, and Draco saw no reason for it to present itself with this much unexplained gusto. He’d woken up alone, he’d dressed alone, he’d walked alone and now he was eating alone. Lovely, truly, and absolutely no reason for the strange little flips his stomach seemed determined to perform. Really, the day had no right to act this self-important.
“Surely not!” he said indignantly. “That’s an awful reason. The awning is shit anyway—look, my trousers are all wet.”
Just then, a head of dark hair came weaving through the crowd towards them. Speak of the devil, and his female counterpart shall appear. Something along those lines.
“Go out with me,” Harry breathed between kisses. “Please. I want— to talk— to kiss you— take you to bloody Hogsmeade—”
, the hours ticking by to the rhythm of Harry’s mounting headache, and still Draco’s mumbling about fucking
He shuffled a few papers around, and pulled out a decorative card. At first Harry thought it was his own letter to Draco, misplaced, but when he took it from Ron and opened it, the inside was blank.
A staggering explosion went off inside the lab, sending several of the paintings on Draco’s wall crashing to the floor. The net burned red for a moment, then dissipated.
“She’s indisposed, unfortunately. As her son I’ve taken over the business for a short while. Shall I carry a message for her?”
“Don’t worry, Malfoy,” Cho calls again. “He’s been wetting himself over you for years, he’s bound to say yes.”
They were standing only a few feet apart, yet there was no reason for him not to mount his horse and leave. Draco shuffled his feet.
“Yes,” Draco chokes out, and he realizes in mortification that his cheeks are wet despite his best efforts.
“Of course,” Harry lifted his hand and ran a thumb slowly over Draco’s chin and up to trace his lip, marvelling at the fact that it seemed he was allowed to. “But you know we’re not an ‘if’, right? This one thing, this can be certain. I’d like that.”
Harry sucked in a breath. He hadn't meant to, but it slipped out the moment he saw the stamped black swirl on Draco’s hip. The sound echoed unpleasantly in the quiet.
Sure enough, a small green flame was flickering cheerfully against the shell of Draco’s left ear. Portable Floo.
By now they were well into December, and the Aurors had thrown themselves into Christmas preparations with the usual holiday cheer. There wasn't a nook or cranny that wasn’t spouting charmed snow, and a Christmas tree had been shoved into every space large enough to fit one. They were lit with a garish combination of Muggle lights and traditional candles, and the overall effect was one of a continuous snowy night. Indeed, Harry could hardly see the windows through the layers of tinsel pinned up to every wall.
“Mandalorian, right?” Draco says. There’s just a hint of insecurity in his tone, and it’s fucking adorable honestly. He’s such a dork. Harry’s absolutely lucked out. “How many episodes do you want to watch?”
“Oh, thank you.” Draco looks genuinely pleased at that. “It’s an online recipe, I can send it to you later.”
“I’m fine, nothing’s wrong!” Harry blurts out. He’s red, and he squeezes Draco’s hands briefly. Draco waits once again.
Slightly perturbed by the lack of any change in their usual routine, Harry continued on to his and Ron’s corner. He frowned as he sat, eyeing the back of Draco’s head in confusion. He’d expected—well,
“Or,” Ron continued, “when they know exactly what they should be doing, but really don’t want to do it.”
Which would have all been fairly romantic, and potentially salvageable, had Harry not snapped his glasses in half against Draco’s chin.
For the next hour Draco proceeded to turn discomfort into an art form. He wondered at how long his mother had waited to call him down, as the polite conversation between her and Riven spoke of easy familiarity. He was invested without seeming overbearing, and amusing in a restrained manner. Draco dreaded the moment he would be alone to fend off questions.
“I’m going to run to the loo,” she finally says. He snorts. “I’ll be right back, don’t move. We’ll cheer you up yet.”
Three, four months ago, that would have sparked a sizable argument and a few eventual hexes. Now Draco just rolled his eyes and grinned unashamedly at Seamus, who flipped him the bird and turned back to study the chessboard laid out between him and Ron. Harry automatically stretched out one arm when Draco poked at it, letting the Slytherin rest his head in the crook of his shoulder.
“How about a trade, then?” He offered instead. “I get an hour with you over coffee today, and you get an hour with me over coffee tomorrow.”
It’s Harry’s turn to deploy the Look. Malfoy frowns at him like he doesn't get it, but Harry’s not really in the mood for deduction.
“I have somewhere I need to be,” Harry gave him a hint of a smile. “Take care of your mother. Goodbye.”
They lay quietly after that, with nothing but Draco’s heartbeat echoing in Harry’s arm. It didn’t feel like avoidance, however, more like they were both waiting for the right time to talk. Harry was inexplicably reminded of a piece of music or perhaps a dance, one where he wasn’t meant to come in yet. He didn’t have much to say, but he could feel Draco’s words in the tense line of his stomach, in the shift of his jaw as he bit his lips.
And finally, Draco rolled over to face him. They were close enough that their noses might have brushed if Harry leaned forward just barely. Draco’s breath washed over his lips with every exhale, and he found it difficult to concentrate on what he said next.
“I suppose I didn’t have to ask ‘Mione out, really,” he finally said. “That just sort of happened. But I feel like you and Malfoy—don’t take this the wrong way, mate, but I feel like you two have always been a bit of both fire and fuel. It’ll happen, but you’ve got to start it.” Ron looked pensive for a second, something that was both rare and worrying. “Why don’t you owl him? Seems like all your physical plans have been the problem so far. You could invite him out through a letter. That’s straightforward.”
“What’s going on here?” Harry and Draco tore apart from each other, shocked out of their trance. Professor Slughorn stared at them from across the room.
Harry suppressed the frustration building in him. He wanted to tell them that of course Hogwarts wasn’t helping with ‘the other stuff,’ nothing was helping with ‘the other stuff.’ He could defeat dark wizards, he could save the wizarding world, but the one thing he couldn’t handle was sleeping alone in an apartment.
Draco dragged his tongue along the underside of Harry’s cock, causing him to let out a soft moan. He swirled his tongue around the head before taking his whole length in his mouth. Harry dug his fingers through Draco’s hair, trying to keep himself balanced as the sensations overwhelmed him. Draco moaned, and the vibrations of his mouth caused Harry to give an involuntary thrust. His cock hit the back of Draco’s throat, causing him to pull away and sputter in surprise. Before Harry could apologize, Draco placed both Harry’s hands on his head and wrapped his mouth around Harry’s cock. Harry let out an embarrassingly loud cry as Draco bobbed his head, keeping a steady, relentless rhythm.
Curious, Harry moved his hand closer, placing his pinky on top of Draco’s. He held his breath, willing away the fear. Draco froze. Doubt set in, and Harry wondered if he could pass this off as a mistake, but Draco laced his fingers between Harry’s, clinging to him. He slowly traced circles on Draco’s knuckle with his thumb, causing Draco to let out a shaky breath. Harry ached to hear more sounds from him; he wanted to be the one to pull them out of him.
Just as I was about to reach the edged corner of the back stage where I had emerged from to get onto the stage to begin my show, heated large hands had gripped me around my slim waist and the next thing I knew, I became weightless in a mere nanosecond.
My hand that was trying to grapple the wall behind me dropped like a ragdoll and went limp, falling onto Harry’s arm wrapped around me as my mouth hung open and drool started to gather up and drip down the sides of my lips, delirious with ecstasy.
“I’m saying that you’re a conduit for dark magic and that your parents have been lying to you about being your parents, or at least, one of them has. I’m saying that
There was so much built up emotion inside of me that I couldn’t help but release it all the moment I laid my eyes back on Harry when I woke up - discombobulated, confused, and absolutely exhausted.
I heaved out a large breath, my eyes wandering away from Harry’s as I looked up at the high ceiling of the living room, trying to calm the racing of my heart down along with my anxiety that threatened to overrun my body from the thought of having to open myself up to Harry.
The long sleeves went past my hands a little for my fingers to curl into the hem lines as a grounding material, the dark green a lovely color against the pale of my flesh with the collar showing the slight of my sharp collarbones and the right of my shoulder a tad bit.
The bitch started to squeal out in pained countenance as I brought his head so roughly towards my frame that his entire torso tilted sideways and stumbled out of Harry’s grip, the slim of his hands reaching up with a frantic grapple at the wrist that connected with my hand which held his hair captive in an annoyed grit.
My cousin looked just as extraordinary as his boyfriend with his black suit that form fitted his strong and lean muscled figure well, the black wisps of his hair blending in with the darkness of the room, messy and captivating. The dark of his eyes were intriguing in the way they practically were the color of coal in their black shade.
“I’m fine,” he finally said, but it came out too quiet for his liking. He paused, staring down at the table. “I just… I don’t understand. I wrote him. I did.” There always had to be something wrong, didn’t there. He looked up at Ron. “It’s me, isn’t it? All this time, and it’s—it’s just me.”
“Are you ok?” Pansy asks. That’s when Draco realizes he’s been staring into space for several moments, a hand pressed to his stomach. He feels sick, and not metaphorically.
There’s a rounded bridge ahead, crossing a winding pond, and Draco makes it there before leaning against the railing. The koi here are the magical variety, luminescent and floating over the top of the water as they swim through the air. He watches them circle and tries to think about something other than his life. He wonders if he’s ever been at a point where it wasn’t falling apart in one way or another.
“The bond’s acting up,” he says shortly by way of explanation. Pansy sets her glass down on a nearby table and wordlessly takes his hand. Draco lets her lead him away.
“I need to talk to you,” was all he said before turning and walking back down the steps. Draco glanced around in confusion before slipping into his boots and pulling a cloak around himself. He called to his mother that he’d be a minute before following Riven outside. The prince was leaning against the wall facing away from him, but turned presumably when he heard the crunch of snow under Draco’s feet.
Ron was still gasping and choking, but Harry was hardly listening. His mouth seemed to have finally slowed to the pace his brain was at, or his brain must have caught up with his mouth, because he was finally speechless. Draco pushed up on an arm to lean over him. When he reached out to brush his hand across Harry’s cheek, Harry let him, feeling a soft tickle of warmth glowing on his skin. Draco’s grey eyes lit up.
“Your cat is literally a hot water bottle,” he says in delight. Draco purses his lips and gives Pea a short glare that Harry hopes never to see directed at himself.
Draco opens the wine halfway through episode two, and Harry does like it, because Draco has excellent taste in wine. After two glasses Harry gets hilariously intense about the whole show and starts commenting on everyone’s outfits, and Draco has to work to stop himself from laughing. Pea has made a permanent home on Harry’s lap, the bastard, but Draco’s been doing his fair share of sliding and he thinks just another shift might have him almost touching Harry. It’s all very distracting, really. He’s barely even been paying attention, and he loves this show. He feels like a complete tit and yet he isn’t even trying to stop.
“You know we stay quiet when someone’s reading, don’t you?” Harry tried to frown, but he only barely succeeded in keeping the smile off his face. Draco seemed to be doing that to him more and more often lately— Harry’s cheeks always hurt after spending time with him. He wondered if it was possible to smile too much.
Her words registered a moment later. Harry turned back to face Ron, a sinking dread already filling his stomach.
“Will you marry me?” Harry’s eyes had never been more serious, even if he was laughing. “I’m in love with you. I know I’m bad at saying it, and that probably will never change, but I promise to keep trying. As nothing more than who I am, here and now, will you marry me?”
“Dennis Creevey?” Harry yelped, sitting up quickly. “He’s a bloody intern! What gives him the right to make a pass at Draco?”
“Oh, well, I’m sure you know now,” the other boy shrugged. “I mean, you probably went everywhere else before coming here, and the library was closed, yeah?”
In theory, there was nothing wrong with his answer. But when Draco started and glanced at him in bemusement, Harry suspected he might be missing something. Hermione elbowed him and tapped her ear with a snort.
“I do play,” he admits. “I’ve got pears on my island. I can text you my friend code and… you can come over? If you’d like, that is.”
And then Harry worried that he was the one making a bad decision, he was the one about to ruin things. He suddenly didn’t want things to be so much of an ‘if’ either. “Draco, what does this have to do with our soulmarks?”
“Just our luck that the pince is a looker,” Pansy sighed and draped herself over Draco’s shoulder. “I can’t believe they locked him up for so long. That beautifully smooth jaw needs to be on permanent display. It’s absolutely lickable.”
Harry’s heart sank. He should have guessed Draco wouldn’t have been satisfied with a hand-scrubbed lab—magic was safer, after all—but he’d hoped to at least contribute something. It seemed his efforts were, as always when it came to Draco, useless.
“Well all of them then,” Harry says it like it’s obvious. “We’ll order takeout or something if it gets late.”
.” He wiped at a cheek he hadn’t even realized was wet in frustration. “There was— is— a man who used to stay in our village. He came almost a year ago, he stayed above the bakery.” He could feel Riven’s tension, but he had to speak before he lost the words. “He used to visit me at the market. He was the first to bring me wildflowers.” Draco’s throat was seizing up. “He was strange and frustrating. He made me laugh, he always wore a cloak that drowned him. Everyone thought we were headed somewhere. I suppose I believed them. Suppose I was also wrong."
They stand there in silence that is most definitely getting more awkward by the minute, Harry with his bags and his mask hanging off one ear, and Hot Neighbor with his fingers tucked into his long sleeves as he fidgets uncomfortably.
Riven must have smiled too, because Draco heard it in his voice when he thanked him a thousand times, promised to cherish and love him, and cupped his cheeks gently with gloved hands. Draco breathed out in relief. How fitting that even now there should be something separating them, a block between their intimacy.
Harry considered reminding Ron that reports were meant to be done in ink in the first place, but there was a more important battle to fight here. He wasn’t in denial about his feelings, but it was a standard dance—a matter of honor, if you will—to defend his behavior.
Draco was once again seated at Savage’s desk, with Cho hovering over his shoulder while Ernie picked apart a case file infront of them. His chair was tilted in such a way that when Harry passed by, their eyes automatically met over Cho’s outstretched arm. Draco nodded at him blankly and looked away.
“Is someone after your currants?” Harry can’t help asking. He tries to stifle his laugh at the idea of Draco dreaming about the former Minister of Magic threatening his (evidently) valuable fruit. It appears the currants are momentarily safe, however, because Draco sighs happily and resumes mumbling. Harry watches for a few minutes, but there doesn’t seem to be any immediate change in sight and he’s reluctant to wake Draco up just to get some quiet. He finally lays down behind him once again, wrapping an arm around his waist to pull him closer.
“Oh, yeah. Yeah, I’ve run out of just about everything. You’ve got to get the shopping done at some point, right?” Harry’s not sure why he’s trying to justify his venture out into London. They aren’t on lockdown yet. He’s got every right to be gallivanting across the city if he so chooses (except for the fact that he’s not stupid).
“I didn’t know I was expected,” Draco answered carefully. Potter smiled lopsidedly, and Draco got the distinct feeling he was missing something. It all felt off, too…
He watched in faint curiosity as she pulled a piece of paper from the receipt machine and scribbled something down on it. His vague interest turned to confusion, and then sudden mortification when she grabbed the arm of her coworker and yanked him in front of her register.
“Oh, no, should it have gone closer to the middle?” Malfoy looks suitably concerned as he leans forward, but his words aren’t making an awful lot of sense. “I wanted it to be a font-and-center spread, but Pansy thought it would look nice near the beginning.”
