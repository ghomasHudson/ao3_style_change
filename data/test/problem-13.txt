"Yup." Said the man.  "That's exactly what it looked like earlier today."
"Oh. I didn't come yesterday because I ruined the hunt on Thursday, because I was talking to Pansy about the same thing."
"Hey?"
"I don't know Hermione! I guess? I do not know. I think I'm getting used to his presence and it would be kind of weird if he disappeared out of the blue. And deep down I feel that it's not just because of that either, but at the same time I think it is and I feel stupid and ... Aaah!"
"Dray, can we ... talk?"
"But you did not answer me. Is it normal?"
Harry and Draco stayed behind. The blonde still refused to look at him. Harry felt powerful. Maybe it was the effect of alcohol, but he didn't care. The only thing that could improve this moment was if he finally managed to get rid of his chaser. At the end of the street, he saw a light approach rapidly and his fogged mind had an idea. His bare foot advanced to the edge of the sidewalk.
Dave spun around on his heels, but he found no one and was beginning to make an excuse to get out of there when he felt himself being grabbed from behind in a rear-naked choke of superhuman strength at the same time in which he watched in horror, two tall figures emerging from a dark spot and walking towards him.
Stupid lilies.
"You've been distracted since we arrived. Is it because of the human, Draco? Seriously, that is not you."
"I trust you. " Encouraged Uncle Harry.
"Well, considering it worked that way, if you did something that I think is important and I owe you a debt, I suppose that for you to feel that it was paid off, it would have to be important to you. Why do you ask?"
Draco opened his eyes. The pair of green orbs stared at him, curious. With his fingertips, the brunette ran across his face, stopping with his index finger at the tip of his nose.
Neville snorted. “You are so dramatic. Go sit with him! Come on! It's almost empty. I will watch your back”
"I don't think so."
The three friends looked at the man lying unconscious on the floor without knowing what to do.
"What are you going to do now?"
Amir decided to end his shift there and go home.
The brunette looked, stunned, at the vampire, unable to believe how, somehow, he had reversed the whole situation. As if HE were some kind of sinister stalker and …
It wasn't grass. His head was lying on Harry Potter's lap and the boy-who-lived'  hand rested carefree at his hair. With relief and horror, he saw his chest rise and fall indicating that he was still breathing.
“But...”
But, the brunette girl had already lost interest in the prey, poking his cap away with her foot. What kind of person wore a cap at three in the morning? It wasn't even a pretty cap!
Obviously, gathering a group of bored young people to study on a Saturday night was a bad idea, to begin with. The time Hermione and Luna took to go down to the kitchens to get a snack, a period that lasted between ten and fifteen minutes at most, was enough for the chaos to begin. Ronald Weasley ended up making any macho remarks; Pansy made some offensive comment about Neville; and Seamus read an incantation with the wrong intonation making his shoe caught on fire.
"Clever." Praised Uncle Harry, jumping from the wall and entering the gate, now open.
But, of course, like any Gryffindor, Harry Potter was an incorrigible inconsequential.
"Are you going to stay there staring at me and not going to invite me in? Rude."
" Grimmauld Place, number twelve."
“You are a terrible liar, Harry.”  Neville shook his head in disapproval  “You can't even be discreet. You could at least pretend you're not staring at his table shamelessly.”
Harry laughed, turning his head back to give the other a peck.
Luna and Neville exchanged a look and then shook their heads in approval. Harry frowned, disoriented by the situation.
“And probably shoot the best moments for Facebook!” Seamus added.
"That what, Harry?"
"How do you kn...? Oh, forget it, Harry! You are truly incorrigible!"
"And then nothing, Hermione. He came here to say that he needed to work some things out and then we kissed and the people who went with him showed up and he practically ran away and I don't know what I should think. He didn't show up yesterday. It's not like we agreed to meet, but, he used to show up every night and I don't know if something went wrong or if I said something wrong and now I don't know what to do, because we haven't spoken since."
Harry threw his head back, resting the back of his head on the mattress, frustrated. He was sitting at the foot of a bed in the Room of Requirement. Normally, he would spend that part of the month in the gardens, chasing after Snowball. But at that moment, he really needed to study and Draco's lupine part was content with cuddles and chewing squeak toys.
"We have that...thing."
"No. And don't blame me, until yesterday you would prefer to throw yourself in front of a car over my presence."
“At least someone here got lucky.” Neville interrupted his train of thought. “Do you believe that after you left and I went to water the plants to close the cafeteria, I found out that someone threw coffee on my Mimbulus Mimbletonia?”
An open light lit only by the brightness of the full moon. Teddy sleeping peacefully on the wolf's furry belly. Earth and cracked cookie crumbs dirty paws.
"I already apologized! And look at Longbottom's face! He is big enough to stand for himself." Spat Pansy Panrkinson, pointing at Neville who was trying to sink into the seat so as not to be noticed. "He is clearly don't giving a shit for what you are talking about!"
"Actually, I met him the week before, I kind of helped him with something." For God's sake, don't ask what. "But, we only really talked when he showed up at the cafe and Neville forced me."
However, after so many days being completely ignored - by the brunette, because the cat made a point of hissing at him every time he saw him, always winning a toothy growl back - the vampire seemed to lose his temper, deciding to change tactics.
“The smell of everyone was driving me crazy.”
And talking about the devil...
"I already called you five times. Don't you think you're overreacting?" Said Hermione, shaking her frizzy hair with disapproving eyes.
"Oh. She forgot the cat."
"Mr. Harry" He corrected, but kept the pronoun of treatment, because he refused to feed the stereotype that immigrants were badly educated or rude "Can you confirm the address? I don't remember the house number ..."
In a matter of a few minutes and the strange feeling of being watched came again. With the corner of his eyes, he saw a pair of green eyes peering through the circular opening that decorated the door. He waved for the brunette to come in.
>Not all vampires hunt out of necessity, many hunts for fun
When the wizarding world thought that Harry James Potter, the boy-who-lived, couldn't get any stranger, the newest couple at Hogwarts appeared with an explosion of murmurs and articles in The Daily Prophet.
“What guy?”
“Surprise!” Shouted the owner of the spy eye, jumping on his neck happily.
> The greater the hunger, the more unstable the vampires become, which can make them unconsciously violent
"Ah. I thought you heard your friends arrive."
"I brought cake." Said, placing on top of the bench.  "What time are we going out?"
When he found himself, Draco was on the floor. Hands on the rug, head up. He blinked in confusion. He looked at the brunette, a little disoriented. Harry Potter had the chain wrapped around his wrist and a malicious smile.
Hermione looked at Neville who gave her a yellow smile and an embarrassed positive sign.
>Teorically, a vampire could live off a person's "donation" from small amounts from time to time, but few people know that vampires exist and even less trust them (it is also very difficult for a vampire to force himself to stop)
"When the dog-wolfsbane potion was not so well known, which I happened to put in your drink last month before you ask, Dumbledore would bring Remus here. Er ... Professor Lupin. Until he returned to human form. The strange noises and howls frightened the neighborhood, beginning the rumor that the house would be haunted and Dumbledore helped to reinforce it, to keep onlookers away."
"Potter!"
Later, Harry would sit down, smiling, to have his breakfast, before Ron would eat everything by himself.
“I didn't expect to see you so soon, Luna”.
Finally, despite his humor and style, Draco didn't like horror movies. Quite the opposite. He thought everyone was too artificial and exaggerated. He liked romantic comedies. THAT, NO POTTER, ARE NOT EXAGGERATED, GODS, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE. Harry had slept in the middle of one of them on Tuesday, and when he woke up, he blushed, realizing that he had been carried to bed again, this time, without notes.
Even if he was dressed before the transformation, the wolf would tear his clothes and he would return to normal naked every time, resulting in Potter seeing him in that situation every time. That kind of intimacy had become practically everyday over time. But not THAT kind of intimacy. Draco didn't want to think about that. It was too dangerous to think of any kind of physical contact at that stage of the moon cycle.
Harry slammed the door in a panic. His back was glued to the cold wood as if making a barricade with his body. He felt that he was beginning to hyperventilate.
Stupid Potter.
"Aren't we?" Harry rolled his eyes and the Slytherin laughed. "About what?"
Harry carefully took the warm ball in his palm. Last week it had been a sparrow and two days earlier a squirrel. Hermione's cat had serious problems when it came to bringing dead animals home. That was why he had been forced to keep the cat. Her boyfriend, and their best friend, had refused to accept the cat since his pet mouse had disappeared - BEEN BRUTALLY MURDERED HERMIONE - while they were at school. Harry held the little thing firmly against his chest as he advanced towards the kitchen, where the light was better.
Harry laughed. He was practically used to the blonde's recurring bad mood. "Please, love!"
He reduced the reach of the chain, forcing the blonde to lean over his body, still fucking him, stimulating his prostate every time in delicious agony. He wanted to keep his face close to his ear, after hearing his growls and wheezing. He groaned loudly at the sting of a bite he had received in his shoulder.
"Hm?" He blinked, putting his glasses on his face to get a better look. " Ah, that."
"Do you think it's normal for me to growl at you?"
For the next month, Harry had a slight impression that the Slytherin was avoiding him. Maybe because the blonde avoided being in the same environment as him. Or because he walked in the opposite direction every time the Gryffindor approached. Or the times he had shouted, "Stop following me, Potter!". Or because he had hexed him with furnunculus in the face the time Harry had disobeyed the advice.
Happy with himself, he put away the papers in a folder, before Crookshanks climbed on top of the table and he lost a point for cat paw prints and saved it in his backpack. Harry Potter smiled. Everything was going well. Which was kind of weird. Things didn't use to work out in his life. In a week, Hermione would come back from the trip and pick up the cat, classes would start again and the time spent between study and work would make him tired enough not to deal with his paranoia (which shouldn't be very healthy, but it helped). And everything would be back to normal.
"It's rare!"
"I don't know how you know ... I don't know how you're still alive, but if you tell anyone, I'll make sure that changes very soon ..." Draco threatened, narrowing his eyes.
"Hermione?"
Had Draco given any excuse and left, so he wouldn't have to deal with it? Or had he waited for everyone else to go before turning into a bat and flying away? Had someone put him to bed? Someone had put him to bed. Weren't the curtains open the day before? Yes, they were. But who? Harry was a little afraid to ask himself.
There was no way to get back to normal with a vampire perched on his roof every night, showing up at his windows, following him to work… Oh my God. What if he decided to follow him to college? No. No. No. He had to get rid of him. Just find out how this life debt thing worked and then…
The brunette's hands wrapped around his neck. Draco knew he shouldn't, but he responded when the brunette kissed him. It took all his willpower to lift his face, preventing the Gryffindor from reaching.
“I went to take your friends home, no one was in a position to drive. There's medicine for the hangover on the counter. I have a few things to do, but I'll be back to check on you later. -D. ”
"I have to go."  He said simply, looking away.
"You are too dramatic Draco."
He placed a knee between his thighs spreading his legs, intensifying the kiss. Harry felt the blonde's pair of fangs lengthen and he circled them both with his amazed tongue. His fingers traced the blond strands, clinging between them. Draco took off his lips. His red eyes flashed darker if that is possible.
“What kind of name is Ronald? Are you a clown of some fast-food chain or something?” Then he shrugged, smiling. “My mother's family has a tradition with strange old names.”
"There's nothing going on."
"No." Draco sighed, bringing his face close to Harry's hand until he was practically on top of him. His superior height made Harry fall backward, falling on his back on the bed.  "I just don't think you understand that I'm not your dog. I am a werewolf. This is not a joke. I can really hurt you. And I don't want to be thinking that there is a possibility that it will influence my control in human form too."
Harry interrupted the monologue with a sweet kiss. " It's all right. Nothing will happen. That's why I'm training you."
His name was Dave. He was 38, an accountant, single, childless, and was going through the beginning of an early middle-age crisis. And for that reason, was desperately trying to get in shape before he was forty. On the other hand, he wasn’t sure he would have the patience to wait for good results and didn’t want to deal with the shame and nasty comments from co-workers if he gave up from the gym in the first week, so he opted for a secret alternative: jogging at three in the morning.
"I see."
"And do you always go out hunting together?"
Harry just heard the click of the window closing and the vampire's light step on the roof, standing there still, staring at nothing, for a long time, until Crookshanks bit his thumb, pulling him out of his trance.
"Are you upset with me?" He said, stroking the blonde's cheek with the back of his hand.
"And then? What is the problem?"
To tell the truth, after the game, he didn't remember much from the night before.
"It's for decorating."
"Any wizard with half a brain knows that it is to CRUSH the LEAVES of the acanthus Potter, not the roots. Give me that knife before you cut your fingers or Weasley's... Merlin's beard!" Draco would say, taking the knife from the brunette's hands and producing the past requested by the potions teacher while Harry made sure to keep the blue petals on his table only inside the potion itself, and away from the blond, as he knew that aconite was lethal to werewolves (yes, he had done his research).
"No offense, but, are you sure? I've been in this area and, if my memory serves me correctly, there is a numbering error that makes the number eleven go straight to thirteen ..."
Dave looked back out of the corner of his eye and found only the emptiness of the dark street. He didn't know if that should make him feel better or worse.
More snarls and more profanity and scratches and squeaks and meows.
He stumbled out of the bathroom. At least this time Myrtle was not there to "help" him with her "advice". He couldn't bear to go back to class now. His throat scraped. He avoided drinking water during the worst crises. The petals clogged his throat and wouldn't let the liquid get down, making it worse. Sometimes he just wanted to scream.
"What is it now?"
In the living room, while waiting for her juice, Luna tried to think of what to do, looking discouraged inside the backpack, until the colored circles caught her attention and she had an idea. Quickly unfolding the packing, making Neville move the coffee table away and setting up the plastic piece on the carpet, she announced excitedly:
Pansy put her arm around Ginny's shoulder and held up her middle finger. Ginny laughed. The redhead's ears were almost the color of his hair, but, Hermione stepped in front of him, pointing to the sofa, on the opposite side of the room, where they were sitting earlier.
Harry threw a pillow at his face. Draco tried vigorously not to think about the years of dirt accumulated on the object
"Hey, babe!" Pansy Parkinson sat in front of him during breakfast "I didn't see you leaving the common room today ... Was the date good?" She provoked, with a grin.
Harry smiled.
"What the fuck was going on?!"
Harry groaned. The alarm buzzed loudly, shaking audibly over the nightstand. Another Monday. Another day of work. He stretched sleepily, muttering, however, a sound coming from the lower floor made him start.
"Are you feeling better?"
A tall presence loomed behind him. Harry looked over his shoulder to see, pleased, Draco Malfoy standing behind him with his arms crossed.
Even so high in the night - or so early in the morning - the taxi driver, Amir, respects traffic laws, stopping at the traffic light, even with the street empty. He took the opportunity to ask to see the dog's ribbon, impressed. He praised the animal, congratulating him on the victory, receiving a happy lick on his hand. Amir didn't even bother to get his pants dirty when he wiped his hand when the traffic light opened.
He didn't care what friends would think, cornering the blond man against the sink. The man, for his part, did not seem the least bit intimidated.
"Oi?"
Harry nodded, without looking in the direction of the redhead when released from the suffocating embrace.
Teddy was not scared and needed no explanation. He knew, somehow, he knew that that in front of him was a werewolf, perhaps not in the way he had imagined, but, a werewolf, like his father. Something he didn't understand made his eyes water. He smiled.
Harry froze at the mention of the word "France". The possibility of the blonde moving to another country, even though he knew that he could ask for a portkey there at any time or even travel by broom if he wanted to, because it was not such a long distance, it bothered him deeply.
“But you think he is cute.”
"I believe he kind of invited himself. More or less. It seems like he kind of thinks he owes me something."
Hermione seemed to understand his eye signs -which looked more like a nervous attack- to not ask questions about this part. "And he went there to thank you? And did you ask him out?"
"Yeah." Harry smiled and Hermione chuckled.
"And what time will he arrive?"
Ron pushed the animal away "This is not funny, Harry." He said, wiping his face with one hand and lifting the other to be pulled up.  "So, besides the drool, what did you want to show me?"
Harry quickly grabbed the Defense Against the Dark Arts one, his favorite subject, and one about advanced potion studies, settling on his boyfriend's lap in a green pouf. Harry had acquired a serious habit of stroking his hair and behind the blonde's ears all the time. Ronald thought this was a little strange, but he decided to ignore it, taking out an edition about spells, even though he would prefer one about quidditch... Obviously, Neville chose herbology. Hermione handed Seamas an edition whose cover was made of dragon leather, as things used to spontaneously ignite in his presence. For herself, she chose a transfiguration edition, leaving the rest of the stack for the rest to choose. Then they would exchange their notes.
“Ronald!”
Harry's eyes widened. Any mark left by a werewolf, in human or animal form, bite or scratch, even sealed with a mixture of silver powder and dictum, leaves scars. On the blonde's forearm, at the same point as Harry Potter for two years, he could practically visualize Lord Voldemort's mark under his robes, teeth marks ripped the pale skin into a reddish scar.
"I'm calling the police!"
"No. Marks. " He repeated, tightening the collar with a firm tug on the chain, making Draco yelp and loosen his skin, hurt. Then Harry added. "Only lick."
"Me first!" Ginny exclaimed, taking the last sip of her beer and handing the bottle to Neville.
“I had to practically drag him to the table by his feet!”
Amir, the taxi driver, will pass by The Grimmauld Place the next day and will not find house number 12. However, he will simply assume that it was a daydream due to lack of sleep and will start to manage his time in a healthier way, without acquiring any mental health issue in the process.
"OK. And then you kissed him."
Harry didn't move, confused. In the background, they heard Ronald's screams as he had just rounded the square and approached. The brunette felt himself being pulled by the arm and the blonde's tongue ran through the cut on his cheek. He stopped feeling the sting.
Draco straightened up, startled. He raised his hands before his eyes. They weren't dirty. There was no soil under his nails. He didn't taste the blood of any dead animal at his tongue. His clothes were destroyed, as they used to be with each transformation, but Harry Potter was surprisingly intact.
Draco stared him in the eyes again. "Hm ... No. Before, well, you know ... Snape prepared it for me and also taught me how to do it when we weren't at school."
In dark times like that, it was necessary to be the one who turns on the light.
"Sorry. I get a little unstable when I'm hungry." Draco looked away again.
Draco made no move to change his position, raising an eyebrow and, when he didn't get any more comments, realized that it was a real statement and laughed. "Yours is very hot."
The man smiled, returning the length and turning to say goodbye to the adorable animal as well. However, to his astonishment, his gaze found a tall, blond man, looking very confused (and very naked).
"Is it about your new vampire boyfriend?" She said, going straight to the point.
"Harry!"
Harry Potter woke up in the middle of the afternoon. He didn't know exactly what time it was, but by the faint glow of the sun, it had been long past lunchtime. He came down the stairs barefoot and in the sweat pants he wore as pajamas. His stomach rumbled. Would it hurt to eat the rest of the pizza he had ordered the night before and had been abandoned in the living room ever since?
Half naked, Draco ran towards the castle.
"I said 'no'." The blonde repeated, as if talking to a small child.
“No. It’s beets, carrots and ginger j...”
Harry took a deep breath. It was just the cat. It was just the cat ... Harry looked to the side and saw Crookshanks sleeping on the other pillow. Shit. There was someone in the house.
The cat looked at him defiantly. The cardboard box in the center of the round table in the kitchen. Harry knew what that look meant. He was going to push the box off the table, for no reason, just to see his reaction.
Draco rolled his eyes. He knew that his friend would not stop asking until he said something. And he didn't know how to lie. Not for her at least.
On the horizon, even though the sun was invisible, its first rays already gave signs of the day to come.
"What is it, Crookshanks?" He looked over his shoulder.
The brunette shrugged.
“What the fuck do you think you're doing?!”
"What am I going to do with you buddy?"
"The meat!"
"Mornin”. Said Ron, already starting to fill his plate before he even sat down.
“Nothing. My life is a joke”.
Harry closed the kitchen door and sat down on one of the chairs. He raised the bat in the line of his eyes. It had pointed ears and big, expressive eyes, out of proportion to its body size, making him look like a tiny chihuahua puppy.
"Fuck you, Potter." He said, pushing the vial back to him and stormed out the broom closet. "I don't need your help."
From somewhere in the room, a sleepy voice spoke nothings.
For hours, he waited sitting on the couch, face in hands, wondering if it had been real, at the same time that with each new sound of steps, cars, conversations, and screams outside, he was frightened, unconsciously waiting that the blond man was going to come through the door and jump on him.
Harry was unmoved, hitting him in the chest with a broom, making him stagger down the two steps he had climbed, more surprised than injured.
In addition, other problems had been purposely caused by Monster, just to irritate Sirius, making much of the house impossible to clean. However, with the new blonde presence in the house, he had become almost obsessed with making it perfect again, after all, Mrs. Malfoy could not think he was an incompetent house elf. No sir! What if she wanted to find another elf? It would be a shame for Monster and his ancestors who have served the Black family for generations!
Harry's eyes widened. Sharp, white fangs flashed in his direction and a blood-colored reflex tinted the storm-colored irises for a millisecond. Harry moved away from the bed as far as possible, his back found the wall.
Harry felt it would be kind of stupid to answer the cat again, but he answered anyway. In the middle of the kitchen table, under his fluffy little paws, was a sheet of paper.
"Imagine, with forty years on the back the weasel father finds out that people need to work to have money!"
"And who do you think you are?"
“Of course not!”
Around noon, Ronald woke up and joined them for a "golden trio" day, as it was in their teenage days. They made a lasagna, which was one of the only five dishes that Hermione knew how to make and the redhead went out to fetch a big container of ice cream. They laughed and told stories and relived high school dramas, which led to a little discussion about the alleged murderer of Scabbers, Ronald's rat, in the eighth year. Despite that, Harry couldn't be happier.
"You see that knot in the root on the right? No, to my right. It opens a secret passage that leads to the Shrieking Shack in Hogsmeade. Okay. Let's go?"
“Yeah Harry, aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?”
"Why can't you just believe that someone wants to do something for you without wanting anything in return?"
For a painfully long period of time - or so it seemed - Draco thought he forgot how to blink, staring at the empty spot where the brunette had been seconds ago. Behind him, he heard a slight rustling and the sound of the bed creaking. There seemed to be something terribly wrong with the fact that he was unable to turn his ears in the direction of the sound.
"Potter! " He said, pushing him to the side with his foot.
"Huh...?"
The blonde, er, Draco, laughed.
First, he could accept death.
"Are you sure? You look so cute."
Draco was not very impressed. “No, let's play. Harry?” Harry just shook his head, agreeing without knowing exactly with what. The blond's sucking noise emptying his own glass of "juice" echoing in the back of his head. “But I will warn all of you beforehand that it will be difficult to beat me, I can be quite flexible.” And blinked, just to make the brunette blush, which was always funny.
"Hey." said the man, biting his lip.
"Are you going out to 'hunt' ?" Harry asked nervously, trying to remember if that was the term the blonde had used the last time.
"I suppose you shouldn't be eating them now. The cat clearly drooled on them a little."
"Fine. " He agreed, lowering his head on the table and extending his hand, where Harry deposited the bottle.
A little epilogue, but that is actually the whole reason I wrote the rest of the fanfic. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do.
“Glasses count as a piece? Because I didn't plan to take it off.” Harry asked.  “Okay, without the glasses, I get 5 then.”
"No!"
"So, Mione ... " Hermione was kneeling on the kitchen floor, snapping her fingers and making "pstpstpst" for the cat and being brutally ignored.  "I wanted to talk to you about something ..."
"A friend?" Harry raised his eyebrows, and then his attention turned to the second part of the blonde's speech. "The other vampire I 'ran over' the other day?"
Harry knew that she had many things to tell. He had already received her messages and photos about everything and heard the most remarkable stories about three times, but he didn't mind listening again. He smiled, going to the kitchen with her to make coffee.  It was too early for Ronald to wake up on a Saturday and Hermione was very excited to talk about her new acquaintances and, as much as he really - more or less - wanted to hear her, the brunette truly wanted to talk about something that was dominating his thoughts.
“If you really are busy, we can come to your home” Ronald had said while they were having lunch together on Thursday “Seamus’ boss lets him take the beer for half the price and…”
"Yes."
"Bye Bye." Said his friend, hugging him and whispering a “call me later", before leaving, followed by a Ron with his hands full of sweets.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco watched in horror as the full moon rose behind him in the open air in all its glory.
"You know what the problem is."
“Six too.”
The Dark Lord was going to take over the power.
The cat-cloud landed meowing indignantly in Hermione's lap and Harry heard a sigh and a knock on the door.
“I can spin the wheel... I don't know if I really want to practice contortion today.”  Neville said, taking the roulette from the blonde's hand.
Harry narrowed his eyes.
"I know it was weird, okay? It's your fault. You are the one who keeps treating me like I'm some kind of exhibition animal."
Fourth participant in a three-person deadly tournament, which he shouldn't even have been able to sign up for in the fourth;
Teddy felt his eyes tear up. But, he was already big. He wasn't going to cry. They could go to the park another day, even if he had to wait to hear Uncle Draco's secretive secret...
“How do I know you're not lying? You are a vampire. How will I know that you are not trying to gain my trust to ...”
“Stupid Potter” Draco muttered “Stupid. Stupid. Stupid!”
"Did you learn to prepare it by yourself?"
With the quietest of steps, Harry came down the stairs. Looking around suspiciously. The front door was open, the sun's rays slowly licking the living room floor. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit…
"Hey, little guy! You are alive!" Harry smiled in relief, leaning over the box to get a better look.
He was quick, picking up the cat and placing it on the floor, severely scratching his hands in the process.
After a while, Harry asked again.
Harry Potter tried to live the next week in the most normal way possible. He would get up in the morning, open the curtains suspiciously, have a bath and coffee. Then he would leave for work. The brunette worked a part-time job at a coffee shop. He didn't really need that job, having received a fat inheritance from his godfather, who had passed away a few years earlier. But, being very hyperactive, and especially now that he was on vacation from college, it was a good way to occupy time and ward off excess anxiety.
"You obeyed her."
Harry wrapped his friend in a tight hug. "How was the trip?"
Founder and professor of a secret (and illegal) club in the fifth...
"Are we interrupting anything?"
Ginny sipped the strange-smelling juice, contorting her face in a mini grimace. “Horrible.”
Meow. Again.
He decided it would not.
Harry blinked in confusion. It was a strange feeling that he couldn't describe with words. The possibility that the vampire had dragged his wasted friends into some dimly lit alley didn't even - ok, maybe just a little - cross his mind. He couldn't understand what was going on, why the vampire was doing it. He had no obligation to do that, did he? The situation of the life debt had to involve a bigger gesture, didn't it?
“Beet, carrots and ginger”
“You met this guy yesterday and already brought him to your house ?!” Ron exclaimed angrily, in the same tone of voice his mother used to lecture.
"Thank you, Teddy, dear. Hmm... We have to wait for Uncle Harry to arrive."
Harry mumbled something but soon returned to the main subject. "It's that kind of thing! And he even gave everyone a ride and left a little note and medicine in the kitchen and he didn't even know our friends, he was under no obligation to do that ... And worst of all, he always comes back, Hermione. And we watch movies. Horrible movies Hermione! And he cries in the end, even though he knows that it is always the same and it's very cute! And I don't know what to do! And it seems that everything is going too fast. And then he kissed me!"
"You know, I thought about saying 'a cup of blood' instead of sugar, but I thought it would be a bit much". The blond man stared at him outside the window, elbows resting on the doorframe. " What are we going to watch?"
She smiled showing her white fangs and left again, with a happy goodbye.
"Yeah."
Harry felt the blood running back through his fingers. The blonde had released him. He withdrew his hand, massaging his palm, watching the man get up and replace his sunglasses.
"Great. Get in the car. We are getting marshmallows and popcorn."
"Harry?" A sleepy voice answered on the other end of the line. "What happened? Is everything all right?"
"See how you react in human form."
Some time later, they were both sitting in silence. A comfortable silence this time.
"Nothing changed." He said, looking away to watch the small figure that flapped wings inches from his face transform into his human form and lay with his head on the brunette girl's lap.
But, like every night, ever since he had appeared as a bat in Crookshanks' mouth, he would come back. He always came back. And for the first time since then, Harry invited him in through the front door.
"He's not exactly your uncle now, okay?" Said the brunette "Usually he doesn't even remember anything the next day. I call him Snowball, but, don't tell him that I told you, okay? This secret is even more secretive."
Well, almost everything.
In the interval between two classes and a neutral environment - the empty spell room, while Professor Flitwick went to grab himself a coffee - he waited for the brunette to appear. What was going to happen sooner or later.
"I know that is not what you wanted to hear Harry, but, there is nothing else for me to tell you. The only thing to do is to talk to him."
If Uncle Harry were here, they would probably go out to fly together. Uncle Harry had given him his first broom when he was just two. But, Uncle Harry was not at home today. He had been called by Aunt Minnie, the aunt who turned into a cat, to go to her school because someone had inadvertently released a very dangerous manticore.
Several pairs of eyes turned to him.
He went to the bathroom to splash water on his face, Crookshanks, as always, behind him, his brush tail raised, whipping the air.
None.
>All vampires have this characteristic of red eyes, which, like fangs, can voluntarily be shown and hidden, but they will lose control in situations of instability (mainly hunger) and strong emotions (mainly desire and anger)
Parselmouth and, apparently, candidate for an heir to Salazar Slytherin in the second;
"May I help? ". He opened the door.
"Oh my God, this is so stupid. "
Harry snorted, crossing his arms and turning his head in another direction. "Sorry if I wanted to make sure that you would not feel obligated to go out with me."
Luna clapped her hands excitedly. “Great. Before we start, I believe that everyone should be with the same amount of clothes.”
2-Several of the former Slytherins in their year (including Pansy and Blaise) has returned for the last year, but since the transformation, he has moved away from his friends. In addition, because of his family's situation in the circle during the seventh, he ended up realizing that he didn't have so many friends, quite the opposite. So, at the present moment, he doesn't know how (and doesn't even want to) get back to them.
“So... The rules...” Luna was standing in the center of the room, the sofas were pushed for more space. “Hold it here for me, love.”
"Where is your shirt?"
"Luna. Left hand. Red."
>The latter case is the most common and it is from it that the idea of life debt comes from. Although it is not normally straightforward, as in a form of bondage, a strong relationship of loyalty and gratitude is implicitly developed
“Yeah, I thought he looked kinda anemic. Too white.” Commented the redhead.
"Well. You should talk to him. I mean, nothing fairer, right?"
"What is that?"
"Potter ?! What the fuck are you doing here?! Get out!"
"What about the meat?"
Some people might say that he was wrong for having that kind of thinking, that he was being rude for judging someone else's clothes and that Draco probably only wore clothes that made it look like his butt had been vacuum-packed because he liked it, right? Wrong! You see, that statement could be true if the man wasn't a vampire, but, as that was the case, OBVIOUSLY, this was just a distraction strategy.
"What? No!" Draco faltered. "It's just that ... The moon makes my senses strange, ok? You know it."
"Morning". He said, yawning, out of habit.
"You are a vampire!"
Draco raised his eyebrows. "I guess…? I mean, she was going to kill you."
Draco ran his fingers over his forehead, finding a stiff spot. With his fingertips, he plucked a fake gemstone with a sticky substance underneath.  His jaw went stiff. "Excuse me for a second, will you? We'll talk later."
“What?”
The blonde rolled his eyes. “Again, Harry... I can call you Harry, right? You are being very offensive.”
"I'm not going to apologize to Parkinson for being a slut!"
"Snowball" barked, taking his attention
"Okay. You first." Harry gave in.
"What does that mean?" He shouted, shaking a collar with a heart-shaped pendant on which his name was engraved, in the direction of the half-dead brunette.
A tug on his collar forced him to lower his head, looking him in the eye. This time, his gaze was serious and his tone was firm when he ordered:
"Well, "that thing the other day" is too generic, Harry. What are you talking about?"
Such a simple solution. So fast. So without consequences.
"Nah. He's right. It's just that you were never attacked by the cat to know. Keep going."
Harry knew that he hid his insecurity with humor and teasing and that he was very nervous when someone didn't laugh at his jokes. He knew, especially since the incidents of his sixth year, how he would stop eating when he was under a lot of stress and how dark circles under his eyes formed when he didn't sleep properly.
"And vampires exist?"
Hermione Granger interrupted her speech, static, staring at her friend under a Slytherin in a mixture of sweat and tiny white plumes. The cat on her arm's fur stood on end when it hissed at the blonde. A sharp-toothed Draco snarled at Crookshanks.
>Any of this is relevant to the fic? Of course not.
"What are you talking about?" Asked the brunette, kissing him back. "He brought you to me. This is the best cupid in the world."
>Vampires have naturally cold skin, as they are kind of dead, although in a short time after consuming someone else's blood, they get a normal person's body temperature
Stupid Potter.
Draco lifted his nose, both to show his usual superiority and to avoid looking at the scene, for his own good.
"I noticed."
A loud bark interrupted the redhead's speech, who spun around trying to identify the source of the sound and consequently the giant animal trotting towards him. He was not fast enough. A pair of heavy paws hit his chest, taking the air out of his lungs and lifted him to the floor. He closed his eyes to prevent the saliva from the licks from blinding him. Strangely, the animal had mint breath.
Harry turned to the blond, who wore a long-sleeved black blouse - no surprises here -  but open at the shoulders and back, with the strips of fabric forming a pentagram. The man laughed at him, tapping the collar with the tip of his index finger.
"I don't know. Pansy said she would stop by. She is somewhat unpredictable about schedules."
The Slytherin ignored him.
Ronald made a puke impression, returning his attention to his beer. The brunette's eyes widened. He might not be able to taste the metallic smell - yet - but he knew very well that it was not juice at all. He stared at the sticky consistency through the glass, feeling his stomach churn. He stood up so fast that his vision disappeared for a second, walking towards the blonde.
The sound of wood being scratched didn't startle him this time. He stood up staggering from sleep. His little barefoot pink painfully greeted the sofa, making him bounce between mumblings to the front door.
"Well, I..."
Under him, the traces of his crime: crumpled sheets of notebook and letters transformed into incomprehensible abstract art of ink and saliva. He runs his hand over his cheek, finding the same blue, wet mess. The clock on the wall in the living room strikes five-thirty. At what time of dawn had he fallen asleep? And why had he woken up now?
"Harry. Potter. " Hermione took him by the arm. Nails profoundly embedded in his skin. "Tell me I didn't just see you putting something in Malfoy's juice."
“Hmm…? Yes,  there must be. Will you guys excuse me for a minute?”
"Oh! Who is a good boy? Is that you!"
The next few weeks of Harry Potter's life would be, shall we say, strange. As expected, the first –many- days were spent cleaning the house to make it at least habitable. However, the process would be much faster than he expected. Surprisingly, Draco's help, which he didn’t expect to have any knowledge of cleaning, would be quite useful, especially magically, because apparently a lot of the dirt in the house was caused or intensified by little magical beings, especially biting fairy nests an infestation of bundimun that threatened to take over one of the upper floors.
"Hermione!"
At some point, Neville got up and fetched a drink, Seamus exploded a packet of chips that flew in all directions, and the weight on his shoulder was gone. The brunette's attention only returned when he heard the creaking of the stairs.
"I said I wasn't going to tell, didn't I? I learned to do it because of you."
Hermione tried to dismiss that thought.
Draco Malfoy froze. Looking around, he saw nothing but darkness. The leaves of the trees moved only with the blow of the wind. But the strong, familiar smell was coming. He needed to get out of there.
Draco laughed dismissively. "Of course. I'm not an idiot. What do you want?"
He was going to kill Dumbledore.
"Look that!"  He exclaimed, but instead of throwing, he pointed the stick horizontally. "Avada Kedavra!"
"Okay, Dave. It's all right. " Said the black man who had appeared and was crouching in front of him. "Everything will end now."
“There are people in my house”
"Yeah. We are friends."
Next.
"There are no such specific rules. You did a very important thing for me, so I think you are a person worth protecting. Only that."
"Trust me or trust me not, it's your problem Malfoy. It doesn't matter. I will help, whether you want it or not!"
Harry adjusted his glasses. The blonde's weight pressed his body to the bed, with both hands resting on the mattress, surrounding him. Eyes with dilated pupils and irises too large for a human pattern, at the same time bright and dark, looked at him predatory. Harry passed his index finger through the metal ring on the collar pendant. If there was one thing he was not, it was afraid.
"Will you excuse me for a second?" Said the blonde, closing the door.
>In this case, Draco hasn't been out hunting since he met Harry and ate for the last time at the party. Considering that a "fresh cup" of blood is not a very large amount, it was enough for a few days
"When did you...?"
Until, on one of the last days of the month, Draco lost his temper. After a spell class, in which Harry had separated from his friends on the way back to the Gryffindor Tower, tired of third-wheeling, Harry was pulled by the arm into a broom closet.
"Relax. I'm kidding."  He said, his breath against Harry's face made his hair stand on end. "Actually, the marks are on my wrist."
"I was thinking of inviting you… on a date?"
Draco laughed, disdainful. "Very funny Potter."
His father would be proud.
"Do bats drink water?!"
“I this blood?!”
He stood up, disoriented. Or at least tried, because something stuck around his neck wouldn't allow it. He angrily watched the pink leather ribbon, which connected his body to Potter's wrist, on which, at the moment, he was sleeping.
"Good evening. Would you have a cup of sugar to lend me?"
It took Harry Potter two hours to find them both, dying of concern about the possibility of getting home and being murdered for having lost a child in the park in the middle of the night, but the scene would be totally worth it:
"What temperature do you think my tongue has? " The blonde smiled, holding his chin with his hand.
"Ronald Weasley!" Exclaimed Hermione, offended.
"No!"
Draco didn't answer, kneeling down to stay at the same height as the boy. "Are you ready?"
“Seamus, do you remember if I locked the car? No? Someone? I'll take a look.”  Dean said, turning the doorknob. “By the way Harry, there must be a bat nest on your roof. I saw one landing there when we arrived.”
Half is done!
“Harry?”
He spat out another wide white petal.
"Harry ...?" He murmured uncertainly.
Harry disconnected the call.
This is all folks
Draco glared at him but ignored him. Without the restraint, he stood up, yanking the backpack Potter used as a pillow from under his head and picking up his clothes. While Potter grumbled against the daylight, he dressed.
"Hm?" He barely answered, between toast bites.
Nothing fairer.
“I'm Luna Lovegood, nice to meet you!” She said, breaking the silence and extending her hand to the man.
"Yes...?"
"I already said there's nothing going on Pans."
The blonde laughed. “It is not how it works. I have to pay you a favor of equal value.”
Draco laughed again. "I would do it myself, but the ingredients are not exactly accessible for my family's situation at the moment."
"Malfoy is weird. And so are you. " Ron said, with amusement on his face, giving a little punch on his friend's shoulder, but soon he looked suspicious. "There was something familiar in his eyes. I can't say what it is ..."
The cat's lightweight appeared on his back. In an instant, curious paws plunged into the box to catch the bat.
The cat was staring at him from the table with its yellow eyes shining. The mess of dry saliva and pen blots that was his notebook now had red spots. His eyes widened.
"Harry." Draco stopped abruptly.
Especially that stupid Harry Potter. With his stupid scar.  And messy hair. And those stupid round glasses. And that stupid broom. And his stupid and magnificent jade-colored eyes, his favorite color….
Teddy got out of his chair. He knew that the chair was his own, because it had a stack of beautiful pillows on top, for him to get taller and because he and Uncle Draco had painted his name on the back so that everyone would know too. Uncle Draco was Uncle Harry's husband. He had a crazy lab on the top floor. Sometimes he taught Teddy to mix gooey things and create liquids with shiny mixes. Once, he and Uncle Draco had made a blue potion and put it in Uncle Harry's coffee and he had been sobbing soap bubbles for a week. Teddy never noticed when it happened, but his hair always changed to blond when he was around him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shrugged, looking a little embarrassed.
"Hm ...? Draco?" A  sleepy voice caught his attention and the half-asleep body shifted.
"Kneel."
“Hmmm… okay. Guys, this is Draco…?”
"And who decides if the value is enough, is it me or you?"
"Then we go after him. I mean, he went after you at work, didn't he? Nothing fairer."
His steps turned into a race. He knew he could keep up for miles like they were nothing. The wind ruffled his hair and his mind was filled with the sounds of the forest, the wild smell of green and wet earth, and ...
"I don't know Harry. Probably. I'll look later and tell you ok? Go back to bed."
As if he knew, the blonde lowered his sunglasses and sent him an amused wink. Harry wondered if he would be fired if he shooed him away with a broom. Before he could give in to his impulses, a hand caught him by the arm, pulling him into the small kitchen of the establishment.
"YES! And do you know what the worst part is? He didn't even think it was a bad thing to be possibly murdered, he was more concerned that stores might close and he couldn't buy a packet of marshmallows!"
"Yes, you did. Several times. And that he didn't take to you." Interrupted Pansy.
He ended up discovering some vampire tastes and tics as well. He liked to watch the brunette eat for example. He had discovered this the day before when he had finally managed to make his hot cocoa and put some cookies in the oven. Probably remnants of his life before the transformation. It must have been pretty boring to have to live on blood alone. Although, in his bat form, Draco had eaten fruit ...
Cassius, the peacock, won his own room at the House of Black. The photos Lucius received in prison at that time made him completely overcome the fact that his wife and son were living with Harry Potter.
Without warning, the door to the room opened and a brunette girl with short hair entered, accompanied by a tall black man. They both stopped in place, watching the scene. Draco turned his head, growling at them. Harry saw their muscles tense and their eyes glowed red for a second before the girl shook her head and smiled.
At the end of the day, he improvised a splint on the bat's wing with ice cream sticks and placed it in a new box with a small blanket at the bottom, placing it out of the cat's reach. Before closing it, he smiled when he received a series of licks of thanks - or maybe it was because of the ice cream - in his hand.
"Don't ask Mione. It was your boyfriend who started it." Said the redhead, who, knowing that there was no point in continuing the matter in Hermione's presence, returned to her own pillow on the floor.
"Why?"
Until the big wave came.
And, after all, it couldn't be that much trouble, could it? Hermione's cat was practically independent. He basically just needed his help to put the food back in his little bowl and open the door when the animal returned from his night walks. For some reason, he always managed to get out alone, but, he didn't know how to come back. Or maybe he could do it, and just knock on the door out of politeness. He would expect that from Hermione's cat, at least.
Draco laughed.
Harry Potter swallowed dryly.
"What the Hell, Potter?!"
"Harry?" The sound startled him, but it was not enough to make the blonde stop. "Are you there? Are you all right? You missed the first cl..."
“Come here. I will introduce you to everyone.” Luna smiled, pulling the man by the hand towards the corridor.
“Is that what you think I am?”
> In this case, Dray always tries to hunt when he changes flirtatious and sarcastic to an emotional mess
"I love you."
"Did you know that the whipping willow was planted just to hide this passage, at the time when my parents were at school?"
Draco's tongue was hot. Harry didn't know if it was the moon's influence to produce that much saliva. And He didn't even want to know. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, as he threw his head back when he felt his tongue encircle his tip, his nails scratching the brunette's thighs. Dozens of tiny feathers flew through the air when he rested his elbow on the torn pillow, but Harry Potter couldn't care less.
The girl laughed, tossing her hair aside. "I could say the same about you ... Don't worry, I was waiting for someone."
"Hey." She said sheepishly "I just came back to get my coat. No hard feelings, right?"
It's not a good start.
“I'll let you think about it.” He said, smiling. “ See you later.”
"Ron. I think that's the only reason he hasn't attacked Draco - that's the name, it's not?- yet. He said he doesn't 'vibe with him', but that he at least knows that he won't steal your organs overnight. He also drew dicks on your face while you slept." Hermione took her cell phone out of her pocket, showing him a picture of Ron and Simas drawing a lightning bolt on his forehead and a dick on his cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
"On your forehead! Is it a new fashion tendency or something?"
Draco rose on the bed, sitting down. Harry got up to sit beside him.
Ronald and Hermione exchanged concerned looks, watching their friend who followed the blonde walk away with distant eyes, without even realizing the presence of the redhead who, surprised, broke the kiss, removing a red petal from her tongue.
More useless vampire facts!
Draco looked at him seriously. Okay. Maybe it wasn't exactly a sensible question to ask. He knew why.
Luckily, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and, of course, the subject, arrived to interrupt the silent fight.
It was getting worse.
Harry lowered his head in embarrassment, feeling the blood rise to his cheeks.
"What? Course not!"
Harry looked very offended. "Excuse me? It is a potion for the advanced level!"
He felt eyes staring at him from across the main hall all the time. In fact, it looked like he had decorated his entire schedule. He discreetly followed him through the corridors, waited for him when he left classes, and would always find him during his vacant times, no matter where he hid in the castle. With the approach of the full moon and the imminence of developing a potterphobia, Draco decided to give him a chance.
Harry shrugged. "I didn't feel like going."  With the tip of his forefinger, he tapped his cigarette, expelling the ashes by the force of habit, just to make everything disappear in a wave of his wand. "And if it were, who would I dance with, without my boyfriend?"
"That was a little rude man". The voice sounded muffled on the other side of the door.  "You should have said 'Sure, please come in' ".
Both vampires did not know exactly what to say, they sat in silence until the sky started to lighten and forced them to leave. In the end, Pansy broke the ice.
"Hm? Okay?"
"Stay." Draco remained motionless, eyes fixed on the headboard, ears attentive to the brunette's movement under him until he heard permission. "Okay."
"So?"
"OI? I was just defending Neville and ..."
Harry Potter froze under the touch, not knowing how to breathe again. His heart accelerating to alarming levels. Until Luna's soothing touch on his forearm brought him back to reality.
"Draco."
From under the table, where he played with the remnants of the paper bag that Ron had left behind, the cat meowed offended.
Harry Potter woke up in a series of three small scares. First, the roar of thunder shook the windows, making him jump on the bed. Then he realized that he couldn't breathe and, finally, that he was blind.
It was necessary to review his options.
"Harry, who is there?!" Ron called from the living room.
“Hmmmmmmmmm!” Dean and Ron made together as kindergarten boys, drawing the attention of the other tables in the small restaurant, which turned to face them.
"You will be one hundred percent honest with me." Observing the blonde's silence, he reinforced. "I'm being serious."
"Still sounds dumb to me. And this is the worst metaphor I have ever seen."
The taxi driver accepted the answer, turning to the right and entering the street where, to his surprise, the numbering was complete.
Big hands hugged him from behind.
And before he knew it, the brunette had already been pushed off the counter, with the notepad in hand. He looked over his shoulder, just in time to see Neville smile and give a thumbs up. He couldn't take his friends anymore trying to find someone for him. But it was better this way. Neville didn’t know what kind of danger he was dealing with. It was necessary to approach carefully.
"It's six in the morning."
Draco rolled his eyes. "You are unbelievable Potter."
Oh. Harry blinked in confusion. It seems that they had understood the situation in completely opposite ways. He didn't know whether to say it, but he said it anyway.  "I was just talking to Hermione as you were only here for some kind of obligation and that maybe I took advantage of it and maybe it scared you and that is why you didn't come yesterday."
He loved Narcissa deeply for having protected him and there was no way to thank her fully for that. Human beings have short, fragile little lives, and vampires are forced to take several of them all the time. For that reason, it was nothing more than fair to return what he had received from time to time. Especially when someone who was worth protecting appeared. And that was the problem.
"What? Ouch!" Something small and hard was thrown at his face. "Oh. I forgot to take it off."
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Ignore my brother, okay? He has the soul of an eighty-year-old man.”
"I don't feel intimated. And of course, I want to go out with you ... As long as you leave the cat at your friend's house."
Ronald watched in amazement as the mass of white fur fell before his eyes, remaining motionless on the floor, with his tongue hanging out and his eyes glassy.
Pansy laughed. "Yeah, Dray. We thought that this life debt thing was exactly about you being away from his neckie."
"Can we talk?"
"He still likes cookies?" Teddy asked, excited
"So that's enough. The only thing to do now is to sit down and talk to him when he gets back."
"These are cookies for dogs AND people, okay? I bought it from a Muggle company. You're welcome."
Perhaps it would be better if they were roses.
"Excuse me?" Romilda raised her eyebrows offended.
“That's it, Harry! Life is short, don't waste any time!” Dean agreed, raising the bottle in a toast, Seamus raised his thumb in approval. Even the Crookshanks purred.
He looked over his shoulder, seeing the blonde reappear with a colored glass cup -a prissy tend, Ron would say- and a striped straw. That was exactly the impression Ronald had again, the brunette observed, watching his friend wrinkle his nose.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hey!” An animated voice called from the door. “Am I disturbing something?”
"Why?"
“Luna was in town, it's the last week of vacation and we are tired of your excuses. You have no choice.”
Draco rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand. Blood.
Also apparently, Snowball was even happier than Teddy, having a new play partner, with more spirits than Harry. The brunette smiled when he saw his godson and boyfriend playing together. Snowball even let the boy ride on his back like a small, furry little horse, until he jumped through the bushes and disappeared into the woods between barking and childish giggles.
Harry didn't answer, staring at the open window.
Stupid lilies.
"Draco? Right hand. Yellow."
There were three options.
Harry ignored him. "Wingardium Leviosa! And it is LeviOsa. If you pronounce it wrong, Snowball won't get up. Hermione made me guarantee to teach right and ..."
Draco looked down tiredly, walking down the hall.
"So."
"But..."
"If you have been approved for your potions N.O.M.S. that would prove you able to go to the advanced level ... Although I still think that Dumbledore pulled the strings to keep you in the class ..."
The girl was crying, clutching her ankle.
"Malfoy!"
The little animal screeched, trying to escape by flapping its leathery wings, one folded at odd angles, preventing it from flying. Harry allowed him to climb into his hand, lifting him away from the cat's claws, with the other, lifting the cat by the skin on his back, pulling him out of the kitchen. The bat in his hands remained immobile, putting out a pink tongue as if he mocked the other animal.
Ginny smiled, stopping at one end of the color encounter and extending her foot to the first blue circle.
Before Harry could think of a sharp answer to return, the blonde's lips took his. Harry felt the blonde's tongue invade his mouth. He didn't have time to find out if its temperature was right or not, or if the situation itself made him feel that strange sensation because in the next second Draco's body had rolled over his.
The blond man watched the interaction with a chuckle on his face, cupping the drink with his hands.
The blond man was standing in the doorway, hands in his pockets, watching the last streaks of light disappear from the sky. When he heard the question, he turned around, smiling. Harry looked at him mesmerized. His eyes were the color of a stormy night.
"What was that thing the other day?"
Harry closed the curtains.
It was getting worse.
Okay. What more? Maybe it was thirsty? Probably. How do bats drink water? Bats drink water? He picked up the phone and dialed it.
Crookshanks arrived before him in the kitchen, meowing when he appeared at the door.
Harry rolled his eyes as if it were obvious. "He doesn't like rare meat!"
Uncle Harry came home VERY late. Okay, he brought ice cream and cookies. Teddy's favourite cookies. But, that did not pay the wait. They should have spent the whole day together! And when they finally arrived at the park, it was almost dark and the gates were closed.
Harry felt his heart melt when the blonde wrapped his forearm around his waist. "His boyfriend."
Harry looked back expectantly. Through the living room window, he could see that the sun had already set and the night was beginning to fall. Who could it be at this hour? He looked through the peephole, finding another eye, sky blue, staring back and smiled, turning the doorknob.
Teddy whirled, giggling, rocking back and forth in anxiety. "Uncle Draco?"
Shit.
"That was the worst way anyone has ever asked me out in my life. And I am over two hundred years old."
Draco shook his head, in a gesture for the brunette to continue. He knew he would do it anyway.
As every year, it was to be expected that in the last one, it would also be necessary to deal with one more of the oddities of the boy-who-lived. So, although that wasn't exactly the kind of weirdness expected, over the past three months, Hogwarts had to learn to get used to the sudden friendship between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.
He deposited the woman on the sofa, she was grimacing in pain.
"No, I'm not thinking of a possibility like that."
“Mimbulus Mimbletonia” Corrected Neville “It is a rare species of cactus. I already told you about it. In the end, I had to take her home. This morning I put the poor thing in the sun to make her feel better and…”
The blonde's hand gripped his tightly. Harry realized with despair that he just couldn't move under the grip, let alone get rid of him.
The curtains were drawn and his room was dark. When he opened them, it was the same. He supposed it was daytime because of the faint light, but the clouds were so dark that it was not possible to know what time it was. Thunder rumbled and occasional lightning tore through the sound, the wind buzzing in his ears and blowing on the cat's fur, which fled under the bed. It still didn't rain.
Cornered against the wall and with a wand pressed to his neck, Harry had everything under control.
"Harry, my boy! " Professor Slughorn's plump figure received him. "What brings you to my office?"
"I do not know. I don't know how vampires work. Is that why you stopped?"
When he heard the doorbell, he mechanically dragged his bare feet to the front door and thanked the deliver guy, not bothering to fetch cutlery from the kitchen, wash his hands or something, returning to the room and just getting the cat out of bed so he wouldn't decide to climb on top of the pizza box resting on his stomach. He cut a piece with his hands and opened the notebook, looking for something to watch.
Harry looked at the empty street. It was early. It was Sunday. He decided to take a short walk to his bed. He locked the door, stretched, and started walking towards the stairs. The cat meowed again. The brunette didn't even turn around, disinterested, turning on his heels to go towards the kitchen to get the cat's food. The animal insisted.
To tell you the truth, when he pressed the button to hang up, he didn't even remember what pizza flavor he had ordered, but, from previous experiences, he had a notion that it took around an hour for someone to show up at his door with the food, so he just put on something, find the money and lay on the couch to watch the fourth season of "Friends" for the third time.
Crookshanks took that as an incentive, jumping off the table and walking over to him, his brush tail whipping the air. Proudly, he deposited the black ball at his feet.
"I don't see how this can be my fault ..."
"I'll be right back!" He said without turning to her, running to get his cellphone upstairs.
“Delighted to meet you.” Draco smiled, taking it between his fingers and turning her wrist so he could place a kiss on the back of her hand.
"Damn Potter, do you have to complicate everything? Go get a coat or whatever."
Harry was left alone with his thoughts for what seemed like an eternity until Neville appeared smiling, throwing his apron over his shoulder and sitting in front of him.
The cat put his paw on his knee and meowed in agreement, before being caught and placed in Hermione's lap.
*I don't think it's fair to demonize Cho, so I preferred to put Romilda because that's kind of her whole role in the book.
“Harry Potter taking the initiative? I don’t believe it!”
No one answered.
"I know, but, it's important!"
Crookshanks meowed from under the couch.
The girl rolled her eyes.  "Okay, okay… Life debts and “what's right” and blah blah blah… I know that. And what has changed?"
As a matter of fact, Harry Potter didn't like cats very much. He was the type who preferred dogs. But he liked Hermione, and after his skin had been saved by her so many times, it was simply impossible to deny taking care of the cat while his friend was taking a vacation course.
He turned his back to the tables, placing a white cup under the machine and pressing a button.
Harry could just watch from the window a very strange conversation, listening to lose parts like “Stop pretending you need help if you are going to hunt people who want to help you! It's very slutty! ” and "Those pants look awful on you!" And then the vampire came back as if nothing had happened.
“How was the game, Ginny?”
"Want to test mine, dude? I just don't think you will find anything special ..." Offered his friend.
"Maybe."
“Your friend looks cool”.
"And then what?"
It was Wednesday morning. The students were gathered in small groups at their respective tables having breakfast. Rubeus Hagrid was dragging a large tree out of the castle that had grown up in the teachers' bathroom overnight. And Ginevra Weasley was having a frustrating conversation with Romilda Vane at the Gryffindor table.
"I'm going to call an ambulance, okay? Come, let's get out of the rain." He put the woman's arm around his shoulder, carrying her inside, her body was very cold.
"Ah. I thought it was normal."
"Only that?"
“And this is?”
"Theoretically, that you met this apparently Satanist guy at the cafe and the next day invited him to your house to mentally wash all your friends and luckily you still haven't lost a kidney in the process. So, knowing Ron Weasley, I suppose I don't know anything." Hermione laughed.
He reached his bedroom upstairs, his throat dry, looked carefully out the window. A red car passed by on the dark street. No blond man. He took a deep breath. In bed, the forgotten pizza was already cold. He didn't care, capturing a piece.
Because Draco Malfoy was deeply in love with Harry Potter and it was killing him.
That's right. He purposely wanted Harry to be distracted by that, just to drink his blood with a straw in the next second. Vampires are very smart. And for that very reason, he always needed to be one step ahead. For that reason, for the sake of his own protection and that of his friends, he needed to pretend it was working and that is the one and only reason why he didn't realize it was his turn and Neville had already called his name three times. At some point, he ended up putting his left foot on the green and with Ronald standing beside him with his foot on the yellow.
Usually, Snowball contests don't end so late, but Harry feels that a werewolf would miss a more open space to run, so he usually invades parks at dawn, as he did this time.
Who told him to have hope?
“The Weird Sisters”, as well as during the Triwizard Tournament, were present, having performed even an unprecedented song, created specifically for the occasion, in honor of the war heroes and martyrs. Ronald wore robes without puffed sleeves and accompanied Hermione in the same blue dress she had worn in the fourth year. Someone spread that they saw Pamona Sprout and Professor Flitwick exchange a peck behind the bushes. And Hagrid blew his nose audibly in a pink scarf several times, touched.
The blond man put his hands on his hips as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He narrowed his eyes and when he opened his mouth to speak his voice was hoarse and defiant.
"And being well involves going out at midnight to play with the furball? When are you going to explain where that dog came from, anyway? In fact, I don't even think this is really a dog and ..."
The cat meowed.
"Slughorn taught me, okay? He still thinks I'm a potion enthusiast for some reason."
"And putting strangers into the house!" Pansy laughed.
“You asked a stupid question!”
Draco shivered, feeling his face heat up. He still wasn't exactly comfortable when the brunette referred to him that way. He didn't feel that ... he deserved to be treated that way?
Harry groaned, in a mixture of lust and pain, when a big hand grabbed him by the hair, pushing his head towards the mattress, immobilizing him to mount. He would not insist on moving anyway, hands wrapped between the sheets seeking support while the larger body invested against his.
3-During the transformations, Harry started painting Draco's nails to avoid direct contact with the skin (scratches from werewolves are also very dangerous). It is one of the only "decorations" that did not make Draco angry, in fact, he thought it looked great and started painting himself in human form (preferably black).
Draco shrugged.
He was trying his best to try to hide his condition, but as the disease - yes, disease - progressed to the next phase, everything would be much more difficult.  Draco hadn't needed a doctor to diagnose him. It was more than obvious when he coughed the first petal. Of course, it was a little difficult to come to his senses in the beginning. He could never imagine that something coming out of the old pureblood tales could be minimally real. Still, he was there. The bathroom floor covered in lilies. The metallic taste of blood in his mouth.
“What?! No, I’m not!”
"Wow."
Apparently, yes.
"I'm not even obliged to be here Harry, I already said I'm doing this because I want to. And that question was kind of strange. Do you want me to kill someone or something?"
"About what?"
"Do you prefer Snowball?"
The brunette stood up, startled.
Draco laughed.
"At least they are not roses" Myrtle had told him. "The thorns would cut you from the inside out."
Draco could hardly believe he was crawling after Harry Potter through a low tunnel covered with cobwebs. But, after seeing him immobilize the whipping willow, he decided he didn't doubt anything anymore and preferred not to think too much before his conscience took control and made him turn back and run.
With all the calm in the world, the Gryffindor stood up, dusting his pants.
"As long as you stop following me and putting dubious things in my drink without me knowing ..." Draco shrugged.
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
“This Morning?” Ronald interrupted. “Wait, when was that?”
Harry absorbed the name, wanting to remember it for some reason, and then shook his head away from his thoughts and took a step forward.
"Crookshanks!"
The man pretended he hadn't seen him, walking over to one of the tables and sitting cross-legged. To any other customer at the cafe, the blonde looked just like another normal person, absently turning the menu pages. Kind of too cold and obsessed with black, but normal. But, Harry Potter knew what he was. And being a compulsory accomplice to that secret, facing the man right in front of you and doing nothing, was driving him crazy.
"Okay, okay. We are not going to go back on that. But how is the situation? We thought you said that the human was unbearable." Said Blaise.
Ron sat on the grass. He knew he had asked a question that would not get an answer. There was no one to take the attention that the furball was receiving from his friend now. But, okay, if his friend was happy.
In a certain way, Harry Potter was really seeing someone. The problem was, it was against his will.
“Sorry if I don't want the blood-sucking night creature to kill my friends.” He said, crossing his arms.
"I'm not going to stay here for you to insult my films, okay?" And they both laughed.
"Ah. I know her. It's all right."
Harry smiled at him, victorious. Based on his insistence on the issue, he remembered one more rule: Vampires need permission to enter your house.
Harry Potter looked up confusedly. He looks around, making sure he is still in his office. The lamp poured yellow light into the room. In the background, the neighbor's television produced a distant and incomprehensible hiss. He had left a window open and the light breeze made the leaves on his desk fly, spreading across the floor.
The love for Harry Potter seemed to be the only good thing in the world. The only good thing about himself. His only certainty. The only thing that kept him going.
“Hey!” Harry whispered-shouted, poking his head out of the window. “Draco?”
Draco sighed, putting his face in the curve of the brunette's neck. Even in human form, during the week of the full moon, his senses and the senses of the wolf - which he refused to call Snowball - were mixed. And Harry Potter smelled so good ... Draco blushed when he felt his cock start to stiffen. His body tensed. He didn't know why he was uncomfortable with that situation.
"Now?"
A shadow too big for an owl and too small to be a thestral crossed the sky. The unknown figure landed before him, calmly. Harry Potter dismounted from the broom.
“Two to one. What can I do? We are testing a new keeper. But I was the one who scored the point. Is there beer in the fridge?”
“I’m aware. So? Aren't they your friends? I assumed they were because you didn't go out screaming that you were going to call the police...” With a dramatic jump, he spun in the air, entering through the window “Are they not? Do you want me to…”
"Thank you. And have a nice day."
"Didn't you say he said 'no'?"
"Snowball." Snowball barked at the mention of his name, putting his head back in the car "Was always very educated. From then on, training was easy." Harry smiled, stroking the dog's ears.
Harry snorted, crossing his arms. Hermione laughed.
"Sorry." They said at the same time. "Why?"  Also at the same time, and they both laughed.
Gradually, the universe was entering the axes. The fights between the two returned, but apparently, with less murderous tendencies. His friends, suspicious at first, came to the conclusion that at one time or another, they would have to get used to it. Hermione, more than Ronald. Especially now that Harry seemed to be doing slightly better in potions, showing that, despite being explosive, the coexistence could end up being beneficial for both of them.
"Wow."
"I SAID-" Louder this time. "That we all here now! Draco! What the hell! You are not paying attention!"
Harry chuckled.
His breathing had become heavier and heavier. The air seemed more and more insufficient with each breath, while the blonde swallowed his cock. With both hands he squeezed the pillow tightly, spreading yet another cloud of small white plumes across the bed.
Harry almost spit out the piece of cold cheese. The man was at his window ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND UPSIDE DOWN. It was not possible that Harry had not heard him climb the wall and walk on its roof. How had he come up at last ??
The cake tray - chocolate with pieces of cherry - was placed on the table. The red-haired woman served the pieces of cake in four small plates and three cups of tea with a flourish of a wand. The other two women who were at the table thanked, without, however, interrupting the conversation between them. Grandma Andie and grandaunt Cissa - who did not like to be called grandaunt, because she was not old enough to be a grandmother yet - were sisters. Before they were bickering, but now they weren't. Granny Molly, a chubby and freckled lady, was not his real grandmother, but she said that her uncle Harry was her son at heart, hence, Teddy was her grandson at heart.
"Hm?"
“To make you stop ignoring me”.
Harry ignored him "And if it didn't work, what would happen?"
The only room he was unable to disturb, despite having cleaned up superficially, was Sirius'. The outrageous Gryffindor banners, flags, and posters nailed to the wall, unlike the rest of the Slytherin, screamed his godfather's rebellion and made Harry feel strangely safe in his room as if he could be closer to those people he loved and that loved him.
"What? Of course not! He's not a vampire! Nor my boyfriend!"
Romilda interrupted, pointing a finger at her face. The rest of the red and gold table stopped to observe, in amazement, how close the girl came to having her forefinger pulled out. "Did he say that to you?"
Draco opened his eyes, annoyed by the daylight. He was lying on the lawn, on the castle grounds. Already on the first nights of the new “friendship agreement”, Harry Potter had decided that he was not dangerous enough to need to be holed up in the Forbidden Forest or imprisoned in the Shikering Shack and that he had full responsibility and would not let no one see him return to normal. . From there, not exactly on his will, every morning of the following weeks when the full moon reigned in the skies, he would wake up back in human form somewhere different, wherever his animal form wanted to take him. Or, as he suspected, wherever Potter wanted to take him.
