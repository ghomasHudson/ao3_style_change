After that, their relationship shifted and, slowly but surely, Draco started greeting Harry with all sorts of embarrassing names, making Harry's numbness fade more and more.
But although it was decreasing with each day that passed by, Harry had only really felt it three days ago when he accidentally greeted Draco, much to the blonde's dismay.
-“Your little crush is staring at you.”- Blaise muttered, hiding his mouth from Harry’s sight by fake-drinking from his goblet.
She was suppressing her anger, Draco assumed. He just didn't understand why would she be angry. He deserved it.
Draco couldn't quite pinpoint what emotion it was exactly, but he knew that he wanted Harry to feel this way more often.
They were both in Draco's dorm having a mini Christmas celebration despite Draco's protests. Harry had just won a game of wizarding chess against the Slytherin and Draco was cursing quietly, making Harry laugh.
Ever since Sirius' death, he felt like there was something broken inside of him. Something that he didn't thought it could be repaired. Until he started his sessions with Draco, that is.
-"Look, I don't like Malfoy. He's a bloody git and we all know that. But I also don't think that on top of losing his sight, he has to bear with the comments."- Harry said.
Harry crouched down and started whispering soothing words to Draco. Harry’s mere presence was soothing enough, and Draco found himself feeling infatuated by the Golden Boy in the best way possible.
-"Wouldn't want to ruin the perfect family image you so desperately want to portray, now would I?"- Draco hissed back.
Bellatrix pulled him closer to Harry. So close that their noses were touching and Harry just needed to lean in slightly in order to kiss him like he had dreamed so many times before.
Harry found out that even though he was highly embarrassed by the names, he didn't particularly hate the feeling Draco gave him.
-"Where is he?"- Harry could barely notice that everyone was watching him intently and he really didn't care. Where was Draco?
-"I wanted to give it a shot. I had nothing to lose, and I had nowhere to go. Well, that's a lie. McGonagall did offered me to stay with her until I could afford a place but I didn't want to bother her. I didn't want to bother anyone. So when your parents offered, I took the chance. Narcissa seemed nice and Lucius was decent enough with me."- Harry told him. Draco hummed in response,
Draco waited until he couldn't hear Potter's steps...until he couldn't smell Potter's scent of pines and vanilla any longer to smack Blaise. Hard.
-“He has liked you since fourth year, Potter. I’m actually surprised you didn’t figure it out earlier. Draco said you were oblivious, but this is next level.”- Said Blaise with a laugh, not caring to hide his amusement.
-“Oh, don’t be ridiculous. Your new wand is supposed to arrive in two weeks and you don’t know wandless magic.”- Hermione dismissed, rolling her eyes.
Sirius Black though, that was another story. Draco admired Sirius. He just couldn't believe how brave Sirius was, walking away from the Toujours-Pur-Blacks, coming out openly back then when he fell in love with Remus, and essentially being the person that Draco
-"It's nothing, really. I do it with all of my patients."- Draco told him truthfully. He did walked all of his patients out.
-"This will guarantee our safety Draco. You can't make any mistakes now. Think of your mother."- Lucius told him sternly.
-“We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”- Draco said shakily. Harry took Draco’s hand in his and intertwined their fingers together.
-“Oh, hullo Harry! As long as Draco is comfortable then it’s fine with me.”- Luna said. Draco finally looked up at the green eyes he had fallen over since fourth year.
From the distance, Harry was watching them. Unable to wait any longer, he stood up with his things and walked towards them.
-“It happens to me too whenever I’m too angry.”- Harry whispered, looking at his hands because he couldn’t hold Draco’s unreadable gaze.
-"Yeah, I think you're being delusional."- Harry said coolly. Draco wanted to wipe that smirk off of his face.
A lot of people were whispering and gossiping, Harry could hear them; but his focus remained unwavering towards Draco.
. If anyone asked, she'd say she was learning a new language, but Draco bloody well knew that she had learned the word from The Lion King II.
-“Oh..”- Draco said, biting his lower lip. Harry was staring at him the way he stared at Harry every day.
Harry stood beside Lucius and Narcissa awkwardly while watching Draco talk quietly with a friend of his, Blaise or something. From what Harry could see, Draco was upset. Blaise was listening, sometimes nodding, and whispering what Harry assumed where comforting words, because Draco seemed to visibly relax. Blaise told something to Draco, and Draco turned to stare at him. Harry blushed and looked down. Draco and Blaise made their way to Harry and smoothly snatched him from Lucius' claws.
Not knowing what to do and not wanting to seem rude, Draco nodded. Harry smiled widely and sat beside him.
-"You'll settle just fine, Harry. Our son, Draco, is a nice boy, he's just shy."- Narcissa said, earning a snort from Lucius. Narcissa glared at him in return.
He was so busy admiring the carved details of his new wardrobe that he didn't notice a figure entering the room.
-"I agree. You really need to get laid. Have you seen yourself lately? You're overworking again."- Blaise said, gently carresing Draco's cheek.
What mattered the most to both of them in that moment was that there they were, all over each other’s skin.
-"You know how muggles have auras? Well, we have magical barriers surrounding us. Every wizard's and witch's magic has a specific colour, most of the times said colour being the same as the light your wand gives off whenever you cast a spell. Granger's magic is a royal purple while yours is emerald green."- Draco explained.
Harry tossed and turned in his bed, but the sleep didn't come. Resigned to the fact that he wouldn't be getting any sleep, he grabbed the Marauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak, and exited the room he shared with his fellow Gryffindors quietly.
He knew it wasn’t healthy but he had so much rage inside. He couldn’t even mourn properly because of the Dursley’s, so that only added up to his anger.
-“You’re going to take my eye out.”- Draco said calmly, carefully lowering Ron’s finger. Ron’s cheeks went as red as his hair, feeling some sort of deja vu.
-"You know that you can change that, right?"- Draco told him, looking him in the eye for the first time since their session earlier that day.
-“When did they started? The panic attacks, I mean. You don’t have to answer if you feel uncomfortable. You know what? It was silly of me, you do..”-
-"Malfoy."- Harry called. Draco broke out of his trance and suddenly realised what he was just about to do.
He didn't talk. He simply sat down beside Harry and ate in silence. He was terribly hungry, but he also felt like he was about to throw up.
-“Listen to me, because I’ll only say this once. Get away from me, alright?”- He said, pushing Harry enough to make him fall. Harry’s jaw dropped.
By dinner, Harry realised why he was adopted. Lucius was staring smugly at a copy of The Daily Prophet, in which he appeared on the first page, along with Narcissa and Harry.
Harry did have a good taste when it came to muggle cafés. It surprised Draco how good the coffee was and how pretty the place was decorated.
-"So, I guess that's it for today. Do you have any questions regarding your treatment and the process that we'll be following?"- Draco asked. Harry shook his head.
-“What are you doing here?”- Harry asked Draco more rudely than he had intended, but Draco didn’t react. He kept himself composed, grey eyes expressionless.
Harry looked at his friends helplessly. Hermione was looking anywhere but at him and Ron just gave him a confused look.
Draco had come back looking thinner and paler then ever. Harry couldn’t contain himself so he kept an eye on him.
-"Draco."- Harry breathed. Draco turned around and Harry gasped. In the moonlight, Harry could see Draco's eyebags and sunken eyes. Harry realised that all this time, Draco had glamoured them.
-"Glad you're enjoying my misery, Harry."- Draco had said sarcastically, as if he hadn't noticed that he had called Harry by his first name. Harry had beamed for the rest of the week.
-“I don’t know what Williams said, but you don’t deserve this, Draco. Let’s get you treated, hm?”- Harry whispered so quietly that only Draco and Blaise were able to hear him. Harry stood up and extended a hand for Draco to hold.
Harry sat beside him. Draco tried to wipe his tears away and sniffled a couple times, but when Harry hugged him, he broke down again, gripping Harry's cloak tightly and pulling himself closer to Harry. Harry held Draco tightly, whispering soothing words until Draco calmed down.
-“I just...I was thinking, he’s good at Potions, right? Maybe he might be able to help us.”- Harry stuttered. Hermione bit her lower lip.
-"That's good. Keep studying hard and we might discuss that little vacation of yours soon."- Lucius said. Draco beamed.
The night before Draco's arrival, Harry took the Marauder's Map and the Invisibility Cloak and went through one of the secret passageways that led to Honeydukes.
-“S-so when I came home at the end of each year, aunt Bella was waiting for me. The scars you saw back then, she made them. She wanted me to learn how to be evil. At first, I confronted her and it wasn’t pretty. After a while, a stopped confronting her and just numbed out my feelings. It was easier.”-
-"Upendi, Upendi."- Pansy chanted. Pansy, much like Draco's cousin Sirius Black, wanted to piss her parents off and walk away from the pure-blood supremacy legacy. So, she was now taking Muggle Studies and to both Blaise's and Draco's astonishment, she was into muggle films and not any muggle films,
-“I like you, Draco. Merlin, help me!”- Harry said nervously, moving closer towards Draco. Draco blushed, -“And I’m going mad because you keep avoiding me, so can you please stop and let me kiss you?”- Harry asked helplessly.
Harry Apparated in St. Mungo's and asked to see Draco as politely as he could, considering he was fucking pissed and he didn't even knew why.
-“Expelliarmus!”- The Ravenclaw’s wand flew directly into Harry’s hand and Harry had to use all his self control not to break it.
."- said the boggart, gesturing at Draco's mechanical arm with his hands. Draco winced but didn't back down.
Draco Malfoy was a wonder to Harry. They had a gala in which the Malfoys introduced Harry as part of the family. Draco had tried very damn hard to comb Harry's hair (earning giggles from Harry) and even used enchantments but it was useless. Instead, Draco left his own hair uncombed much to his father's dismay.
Harry was about to hex the life out of the petrified Ravenclaw when he suddenly felt a cold hand intertwining with his.
So Ron made no comments and ate his breakfast quietly, giving Hermione a knowing look when she was about to comment on Harry's eating habits.
-"He's in our room. Come on, I'll take you there."- Blaise said and took Harry to the room he shared with Draco.
Draco felt shocked because all of his life, people had constantly told him how weird he was for doing those movements until he learned how to control them; yet here was Harry, the only person asides from his mother thinking that it was pretty. That he was pretty.
everyone's pain in his dreams. It physically hurts him. Just like your negative feelings do."- Pansy explained, chugging the rest of her butterbeer.
-“Were you...waiting for me?”- He asked tentatively. Draco scoffed offendedly, but Harry didn’t fail to notice the blush that crept onto the blonde’s cheeks.
Harry couldn’t help himself and he kissed Draco. Draco kissed him back softly but he was the first to pull away, earning a small whine from Harry.
Draco cowered when anyone came anywhere near him, recoiling rather visibly. He never defended himself whenever someone hexed him or insulted him. He kept his head low and became very quiet.
-“HOW!? Wait, wait, wait, so you’re not mad?”- Harry asked, searching for his glasses that had fallen from his face when he freaked out.
Draco gasped when Harry came into the hospital. He was in the middle of a session when he felt a great amount of pain that left him breathless.
-"H-hullo."- Harry stuttered nervously. No one had told him that Draco was absolutely handsome. He was tall and slim, with messy platinum hair and a piercing body.
Everyone gasped and Draco blushed before nodding once. Harry kissed him again, slower this time and pulled away when he heard Zabini suddenly exclaim:
-“What on Merlin’s name are you doing in here? We are supposed to find Potter’s hiding place.”- Theodore Nott hissed.
-"Potter's staring at you, right?"- Pansy asked, giving a quick glance to the Gryffindor table. Indeed, Potter was staring at him, trying to be subtle but failing miserably.
-"I'm guh-gonna..I'll just..-yeah."- She said quickly, pointing at the bar with her fingers. She stood up and stumbled towards it.
Nott was already making his way to Draco’s pants when the door opened, revealing a very angry Blaise.
-"I should thank you, then? It wasn't your secret to tell."- Draco told him. Harry's temper was rising. He only tried to help. Draco could felt his anger and flinched a bit. He didn't like how it felt when Haryy was angry.
-“Please darling. I’m your best friend and you’re not exactly subtle about hiding it. You literally give him heart eyes every time you watch him.”- Blaise said shrugging.
Harry had had enough and had told Draco that if he was going to be mean, he wasn't interested in his friendship.
-"He was simply trying to make me feel more comfortable, sir. We tried to do my hair but it was useless."- Harry said as innocently as he possibly could. Lucius stared at him for a long moment. He tried doing enchantments to Harry's hair but they didn't work. Sighing tiredly, he turned to Draco.
Whatever feeling Draco had given him with that nod was long gone and the food in front of him seemed heavily distorted.
At first, the Slytherins were skeptical, but seeing Draco smiling softly, clapping repeatedly, and even giggling whenever he won against Harry in Wizarding Chess eased the Slytherins. Most of them anyways.
-"It seems that Malfoy was hexed by...oh, dear..-Voldemort himself during the war. You know, when he handed you the wand when you
-"Well, it's your life at the end of the day. No one else will live it for you. Others opinions shouldn't matter."- Draco spoke carefully.
-"Since the beginning of the year."- Draco admitted. Harry squeezed his hand and guided Draco inside of the common room.
-"Don't get your knickers in a twist, I'll help you out. I'll teach you everything you need to know."- Draco offered. Harry beamed.
-“Leave him alone!”- Sending the group of students flying to the end of the hall as a deep red glow blasted from within him.
-“Thank Merlin you came!”- Blaise told Harry. Harry had just arrived to Draco’s room to find Blaise and Pansy there. They were both decorating the room.
-"W-what!? What!? What was that all about?"- Ron asked. Harry shrugged, trying to act nonchalantly as if his heart wasn’t threatening to burst out of his chest.
! I'm sure he'll be fine."- Hermione had told him, but before Harry could say something Ron told her,
-“It’s pretty. When you make those movements, I mean.”- Harry muttered more to himself than to Draco.
-"You know Potter, this is one of Draco's favourite songs. Why don't you take him out for a dance?"- Pansy suggested. Draco choked on Blaise's drink. His throat was burning and his heart was beating way too fast.
-"Yeah. Have you been well?"- Harry asked, smiling a bit. Draco felt a faint rush of comfiness invading him and he was able to relax a bit.
Harry observed how Draco had his hand tightly clasped against Blaise’s and couldn’t help but feel jealous.
Harry was frantically searching for Draco and ended up in the entrance that led to the Slytherin common room. Blaise was just about to go in when Harry called him. Blaise turned and sighed in relief.
He had searched literally everywhere in the goddamned castle for Draco. But the boy was nowhere to be found.
-“Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq...”- Draco whispered over and over again, trying to control his breathing.
So instead, Harry sneaked into the Slytherin common room clumsily and ended up crashing against Draco, knocking them both on the floor.
Harry made it his mission to bring Lucius down the moment he entered Draco's room on the last day before going back to Hogwarts when Lucius was just leaving it. Draco was crying hard, his lips were swollen, his hair was a mess, and his robes were torn.
-"Uh..I'll try. But I know that this is not the first time, Malfoy. I'm not stupid."- Harry said and Malfoy snorted.
-"I'm finally able to study magic without having Voldemort breathing in my neck or reading my mind. I'm grateful."- He focused back on his task, much to his friends shock.
-"You should go back to your room."- Draco said softly, stopping in front of the entrance of the Slytherin common room.
-"It seems that you two get along quite nicely."- Hermione pointed out. Harry shrugged again. The owls came, delivering the mail and Harry noticed that Draco had received a Howler. Draco paled and excused himself, Blaise following behind.
-"Fantastic, I presume."- Blaise laughed, making Draco and Harry laugh as well. The three of them went to the nearest clear table and sat down, talking quietly for the rest of the night.
-"You're right. Go straight to your room and you won't have any food until you remember your manners and reconsider about your behaviour."- Lucius commanded firmly.
-"This is not your book, it's Granger's."- Draco commented, observing the book carefully. Harry nodded.
-“We became friends because of it, so I don’t mind. We are friends, right?”- Draco answered. Harry’s blushed intensified, earning a smirk from Draco.
-"Honestly, Potter. It was an innocent jinx. Just let him go."- There was something in Malfoy's tone that almost made Harry comply.
-"Let's just go."- Draco said unusually quiet. Harry stared at him, then back at the student, and then back at Draco before nodding once.
-"Please, sit down so that we can start."- Draco told him. He himself needed to sit down. He felt suddenly drained and out of energy. Like there was nothing to keep him going.
Draco could often be found alone in the library and after watching him the entire week, Harry decided to sit with him on Friday.
Harry pulled away first, gasping for air. Draco's lower lip was red and Harry gently touch it with his fingers.
When Harry learned that Draco was his soulmate, he had been so excited. He didn’t quite understand what Draco had meant when he had told him that they were soulmates but the idea made his heart flutter.
Harry hadn't even noticed how much time he was actually spending with Draco. He hadn't noticed when he started regularly accompanying Draco to the Slytherin common room (and soon to Draco's dorm). He hadn't noticed that he had learned the password. He hadn't noticed that pretty much all of the Slytherins had gotten used to his presence. He hadn't noticed that he actually enjoyed talking with Zabini and Parkinson as well. He hadn't noticed he had started calling Draco by his first name, but he bloody well remembered the first time Draco had said his.
-"Where are you taking me?"- Draco asked suspiciously. Harry giggled but said nothing. They arrived to the Headmistress' office and Harry said the password.
He told Draco about that insufferable blonde with gelled hair and stiff ideals, and how even though Harry disliked him, he couldn't help but feel happy about everything else.
Narcissa had smiled at him and Lucius had nodded gracefully. They Apparated at the Malfoy Manor, where the press awaited.
-“What’s that, Draco? Scared of your auntie?”- some slytherin shouted, earning cruel laughs from other students.
-"I think I want to become a teacher."- Harry revealed. They were both sitting down at the edge of the Great Lake and Draco had brought Harry more pastries and sweets.
-“Remember when the..the D-Dark Lord stayed at the Manor?”- Harry nodded, -“Well, he..he touched me in p-places I didn’t..”- Draco’s voice broke and he curled more in himself.
-“Is your head full of nargles too, Harry?”- Luna whispered. Draco observed from the corner of his eyes, smirking internally when Harry flushed.
-"As I was saying, you will pay for our trip and you will not contact Draco by any means, or I'll make sure as hell that the only light you see is the one after the Dementors kiss you."- Harry threatened.
-“I..uh, yes. Let’s go.”- Harry agreed. The trio walked past Draco, but the latter didn’t seem to notice them.
Dinner started, and while the situation was soon forgotten because of the food, a tiny smile made its way to Draco’s face when he thought Harry wasn’t looking.
-"He really isn't. He's brilliant."- Harry went on telling Draco about Ron, and Draco listened carefully.
-"So you're married to your job, then?"- Harry chose to ask instead. Draco nodded, eyes brightening up.
The morning came and Harry couldn't wait any longer. He slid into the Slytherin common room and waited for Draco in his room, much to Zabini's dismay.
He should’ve known that his safe haven would be discovered sooner or later. He just didn’t think that it would be discovered by his soulmate.
He casted off the Muffliato from his room and headed to his bathroom to get ready for another day at work.
-"No, he's not. You're going back to your table."- Draco commanded. Harry laughed along with a couple of Slytherins.
idea, Blaise. But I do believe we forgot the cups to pour the drinks, shall we fetch them?”- Pansy said with an equal tone, earning a glare from Draco.
He nodded softly, blonde strands of hair falling over his eyes. Harry smiled and sat down in front of them.
Harry was running late to class and Draco was just...standing there. He seemed like he was daydreaming and dazed, lost in his own world. A lot like Luna, if Harry could say so himself.
Everything was dark, asides from the corporeal patronus of a doe that lit up the room, moving around the piano in which Draco was playing.
-“Hermione, back at Malfoy Manor, I heard Draco’s voice in my head. Why?”- Harry asked curiously, recalling the peculiar event.
-“Mental, that one. Kept hanging out with mudbloods and blood traitors. No wonder why his father punished him.”- someone said.
Draco had pretty much ditched his job to come to Harry's office at the Ministry thinking that Merlin-knows-what had happened to him just to find out that Harry had told Hermione
-"I trusted you with my deepest secret. You should've asked."- Draco said softly. The kind of soft that broke Harry.
-"What happened back there?"- Harry asked, once Draco had calmed down and Harry had given him a cup of tea.
-"Mr. Malfoy, I need to speak with you alone after your classes. For now, Miss Lovegood will escort you to your classes and for your well-being, don't go off wandering alone. At least for now. I know you're very capable, and that it will be frustrating for you but just hang in there until professor Lupin and I sort this out. We shall make an announcement and...-anyways, you all have class. Off you go."- Minerva said and walked away, muttering something that no one could hear.
-"It's not..I..-He's not interested in me, okay?"- Draco told them defensively, gulping all of his butterbeer and Pansy's firewhiskey. Blaise shot him an amused glance.
-"Merlin! People will always talk. Just grab my elbow, you git."- Harry told him. Draco nodded decisively and grabbed Harry's arm ever so gently, searching for his elbow.
Draco still dressed fashionably, if he could say so himself. But he was way less stiff than before and didn't use gel on his hair anymore. Instead, wore it in a "styled" mess. He really didn't took time to do it anymore, but it was always somewhat decent.
-“Of course, they couldn’t be with me every time and they couldn’t go against Nott’s orders or he would tell aunt Bella and well...you’ve seen how that turns out for me.”- Draco explained.
He also saw other students hexing him, and he thought that Draco would defend himself or at least tell a professor, but Draco did nothing of the sort. He kept quiet and moved on with his day, much to Harry's irritation.
One moment, Harry was inside Grimmauld Place, but the moment Walburga had opened her mouth to insult her son the walls had crumbled and everything had shattered.
Blaise was immediately beside him, whispering soothing words. Draco could only gasp and shake his head, curling himself in a fetal position and rocking himself back and forth.
, Harry. I know. But that's how the Ministry saw it at that time. Anything that might have happened to him during the war does not concern them. And you know he wasn't the only one injured."- Hermione's voice dropped at the end and stared at Ron. Ron waved his hand dismissively.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione quickly followed the source of the sound and found a Ravenclaw hexing Draco and the blonde was not reacting. He only asked for help softly.
They made their way to the castle together. When it was time for them to go in their respective ways, Draco asked him fearfully:
-"I think you'll make a great teacher."- Draco commented out loud. He hadn't meant to, but he couldn't back down now.
-"Master Lucius punishes him often."- Dobby muttered, Apparating away. Harry paced back and forth impatiently. After what seemed an eternity, Dobby returned with a tray full of food which Harry gratefully took. He walked towards the room that had engraved "
-"I love my job. And I'm really thankful that people trust me despite everything. It wasn't easy, but I'm glad I didn't gave up."- Draco said with sparkling eyes,
-"Take a break. You need it."- Harry told him. Draco stood there, just appreciating Harry's emotions for a bit.
-“Unfortunately, always.”- Draco had replied when Harry entered. Draco stared at him with wide eyes, smile gone.
-“Alright then.”- Harry told him. He waited for his friends to get in the carriage before making his way towards Draco.
At exactly 8:00am, Draco came into the room, walking as quietly and carefully as possible. Harry noticed that something was different about him but he just couldn't figure out what it was.
At first, Harry was simply going to wander around without any particular destination in mind, but after seeing Draco in the Astronomy Tower, he couldn't help but feel curious.
He had noticed how uncomfortable Draco seemed whenever someone was close to him. He would only let certain people touch him, and it was always asked before done.
-"I guess he wasn't, and nobody mentioned it back then."- Harry sank. Malfoy had lost his sight to help him.
-“You’re not trying to protect him again, are you? Because you know what Bellatrix will do to you if you betray us.”- Nott threatened, grabbing Draco’s hair and forcing him closer to him.
-“Hi Malfoy. Mind if I sit?”- She asked. Draco shook his head and Hermione nodded, sitting down in front of him.
-“Nott was watching me every time, breathing on my neck. I never told anyone that you were my soulmate...except my mother, of course, but they knew that we had something going on.”- Draco gulped and then revealed slower and softer,
At around 18:00, Draco was awoken from his trance by a knock on his door. He could feel a sense of nervousness but relief at the other side of the door.
-“They hadn’t been able to get under my skin in a long time. I started imagining it was you touching me.”- He kissed Harry’s lips,
He really did try to sleep but it was useless. Moreover, he was just desperately hoping that Draco was alright.
-"You asked me before why I can see the magical barriers. Well, it was a "special" gift from the Dark Lord when I succeeded in letting the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. It's a wonderful ability, it really is. But I hate it. It reminds me of what I once was. Of what I will always be."-
Even after what had happened, Draco was feeling something other than pain and Harry was feeling something bubbly that, for once, he didn't hate.
-"Anytime."- He said with difficulty. He stared at Draco until the latter one let out a little noise,
They quietly made their way into the Slytherin table, apparently not wanting to draw any more attention.
In the months that followed, Harry found himself spending more and more time with Draco. At first, it was sort of awkward.
Watching him returning to his seat, Harry felt a mix of emotions but most of all, he felt an inexplicably big amount of pride for Draco.
Draco scoffed. Potter's hero complex was still intact, then. Or maybe it was the Gryffindorishness in him.
After successfully (barely) avoiding the possible death of some arseholes, Harry made it his mission to keep an eye on Draco, protecting him from hexes and jinxes of other students in a subtle way.
-“Five stirs clockwise, five counterclockwise, five minutes brewing in high heat, five minutes resting, and two teaspoons of honey.”- She told him.
He didn't really remembered how he had ended up in the Court Room, but he did remembered how he felt when Draco saw him.
Harry unconsciously observed Draco that week. He realised that Draco wrote a lot in a notebook, but asides from that, the blonde didn't do much.
Harry woke up on Friday night of the first week after an awful nightmare including Voldemort and wandered off to the Astronomy Tower. He found Draco there.
Maybe that's why he couldn't quite pinpoint the exact moment and reason it had happened; because somehow, when he didn't think about Draco, his mind went blank and empty.
Draco un-petrified the student and quietly made his way back to his dorm with Harry following close behind.
They were in their Defence Against the Dark Arts class when professor Lupin told them that they would be learning how to fight off boggarts.
-“Listen, is it alright if I sit here for a bit?”- He asked. Draco looked away too, staring at the window instead.
Harry was surprised to find out that his new family for the time being, the Malfoys, didn't treat him like dirt.
-"I'm sorry, what?"- Draco asked, not quite looking at her. He was too focused glaring at Harry. Harry looked at him guiltily.
-"Don't get your knickers in a twist, Potter. He's fine."- Parkinson started, but Harry could tell that she was nervous.
-"What do you mean?"- Harry asked confusedly. At that very moment, as if by divine revelation, they heard it. A tripping jinx and someone falling.
-“He’s fine. That’s all I needed to know. He has something going on with that Diggory boy anyways. He won’t want to see me here. Let’s go.”- Draco spat with venom while Cedric, Fleur, and Viktor hugged him.
-"Come on, mate. I'm your best friend, of course I know you like Draco."- Ron paused to stare at Hermione, who was listening attentively,
-“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I...I relapsed and I didn’t want to disappoint you because I was doing so fucking good and now I fucked up. I was just so overwhelmed. It’s Sirius’ death anniversary and I couldn’t handle it.”- Harry sobbed. Draco hugged him and Harry sobbed louder.
Harry sat beside him, glancing at the moving flowers that laid over the Dark Mark. Most of them were narcissus, but there were a lot of water lilies and daisies as well.
He shrugged it off and walked Malfoy to the Great Hall. As Draco predicted, their entrance made quite a turmoil. Harry swallowed his embarrassment and guided Draco to the Slytherin table. Parkinson and Zabini received them, sharing identical looks on their faces that Harry couldn't figure out.
-"I'm so sorry."- He whispered back, glancing with evident concern at his friend. Draco limited himself to shake his head in sign of dismissal and turned to Harry.
-"Hi Draco. Parkinson, Zabini."- Harry greeted from behind Draco. Pansy nodded politely and Blaise waved happily.
-“Nott has a cheap invisibility cloak. Works well enough. Whenever I seemed to be alone, he was there. Watching. Waiting for me to make a mistake. I learned how to feel when he was there and tried to use Legilimency on him a few times to get him off of me, but then he started doing what he did in that classroom.”- Draco finished.
Draco, albeit some difficulty, could finally see him again. He walked closer to Harry, until he could hear Harry's ragged breaths.
Harry noticed how, even though they were sitting relatively close, both Blaise and Pansy gave Draco a little space.
-"Fine. Have it your way, then."- He said, walking towards Narcissa. Draco stared in shock and then turned to Harry, who whispered an echantment with his wand in hand and turned Draco's hair back to normal. Draco thanked him quietly and they both made their way to the ballroom, where everyone was waiting.
-"Thanks."- Draco muttered, apparently as embarrassed as he felt. Harry froze, and without saying anything, he simply nodded and walked to his table.
He told Ron and Hermione that it had been a pretty tiring day and that he just wanted to rest for a bit. It wasn’t a complete lie, he was tired.
-“What on earth do you think you’re doing?”- Harry asked, taking off his cloak and crossing his arms, waiting for an explanation.
Harry went back to his dorm, pacing back and forth. He knew he was bisexual on his fourth year, so that wasn’t the issue. He bloody well thought Draco was pretty.
He didn't bother in checking the time, but he knew it was way too early for him to be dealing with this.
-"Would that be so fucking bad!?"- Harry exploded. Ron stared at him for a long time. Or perhaps it was only for a few minutes. Harry couldn't focus. His head was spinning.
, Harry. Do you ever comb that hair of yours?"- Draco whispered, running his hands through Harry's hair. Harry leaned in and closed his eyes at the touch.
The trio was making their way to DADA and both, Ron and Hermione, had asked Harry about the whole Draco situation that had happened the day before.
-"I wanted to."- said Harry honestly. Draco stared at him for a long moment until he finally glanced back to his notebook and kept writing.
-"Take a day off, dammit. You are needed here, Malfoy. You're the best Mind Healer we've had in decades and if you keep passing out, most likely due to exhaustion, we're screwed. Really. So don't fight me and take the fucking break. Doctors orders."- Rivers silenced him.
-"Oh! Yes, of course. If you want or need to know anything else, don't hesitate to come to me, Draco."- Hermione told him.
-“Oh, butterflies.”- Harry answered nonchalantly, but Draco saw how Harry pushed down his robes to hide his wrist.
-“I’m not here to hurt you. I just wanted to make sure you were alright.”- Harry revealed. Draco’s eye brows rose in shock.
Their friendship, however, hadn't last long, for Draco had been put in Slytherin and Harry in Gryffindor.
-"Do you...erm..need help?"- Harry asked uncomfortably, noticing how a blush crept upon Malfoy's cheeks.
The numbness his own mind had created tuned out every other feeling or emotion that he could possibly feel.
-"Malfoy."- Harry had greeted with a nod. It was simple, but it was friendly enough for Ron and Hermione to speculate.
-"Alright Draco, come up in here."- McGonagall encouraged. She had stopped calling him by his last name ever since the beginning of the year.
-"Of fucking course. He's everywhere! Gimme that."- Draco murmured, gesturing with his hands dramatically and grabbing Blaise's drink.
alright? You looked ill and ran away so suddenly.”- Draco recalled. Harry nodded and smiled fondly at his crush.
Holidays were a pain for Draco. He wasn't allowed to eat more than once a week nor he was allowed to leave his room, and that painfully reminded Harry of his times with the Dursley's. Harry was always moody and angry with Lucius, but tried his best to keep the peace.
-“Draco…”- Blaise said softly. Draco opened his eyes in horror. A few people were staring at him, but for the most part, everyone was busy eating or talking.
-"So, how are things going with Malfoy?"- Ron asked once at dinner. Harry, who was too busy staring at Draco, suddenly came out of his trance.
Afterwards, Draco focused on whatever rubbish Parkinson was talking about and didn't look in Harry's way again.
Draco nodded once and started explaining softly. He chuckled whenever Hermione understood and made soft noises of approval.
They had just finished decorating when Draco came in with wet hair and arms exposed. Harry’s mouth went dry.
-"Aren't you coming?"- Harry asked when he saw that Blaise was walking away. Blaise stopped and turned.
-"Mister Malfoy, as of this moment, you are not allowed to see neither Draco nor Narcissa. You will go straight to Azkaban."- Minister Kingsley said decidedly. Draco was frozen.
-“Maybe we can be a little less chaotic together.”- Draco whispered, staring at Harry’s big green eyes as he gently placed the glasses in Harry’s face properly.
Draco had spent twenty minutes trying to fix it but the moment he looked at his reflection in the mirror, he only saw a young, thinner version of Lucius. Not recognising himself, he sighed painfully and messed up his hair frustratedly, his sleeve rolling in the process, revealing the faintest sign of a scar where the Dark Mark once rested.
-“I need to move them. I actually…need to make uh..different movements to feel satisfied. I mean, I can control it if I want to but it just builds up inside of me.”- Harry nodded in understanding.
-“You coming, mate?”- Ron asked him. Harry realised that he hadn’t moved from his spot and neither had Draco. Draco was watching him with hungry eyes.
-“He was keeping me company. Draco can be very nice when he wants to.”- Luna replied smoothly before Draco opened his mouth.
-"Blaise knows. I have a plan, Harry. And I need him for that plan. After Hogwarts, I'm going to move to France and I'm going to open a flower shop. However, I have no money to do that. He has agreed that, somewhere in the future, maybe not right after I finish my studies but some day, he'll pay for my trip to France. Of course, he thinks I'm only going on vacation and has no idea about what I want to actually do, but it's the best I've got."- Draco told him honestly, ending with a tired sigh. Harry stopped caressing his hair.
-"Thank you for the coffee."- Draco said politely and stood up. Harry too, stood up (rather clumsily).
-"You're in good company. I'll come by later. Ms. Granger, Ms. Weasley, Ronald."- He greeted politely and walked out of the room.
-"You're seriously not gonna stay standing, are you? Sit down and help me eat this. It's way too much food for me anyways."- Draco said, not looking at Harry. Harry noticed a faint pink tint on Draco's cheek but shrugged it off. Harry ate with him quietly.
-“I don’t think that’s a good idea.”- Draco finally stopped petting the thestral and turned to face Harry,
And then, Draco had found the diary. Something to pour his emotions on, and that’s how he had ended up unconscious in the Chamber of Secrets.
-"Alright, alright! No need to get defensive. M'lady."- Blaise extended his arm to Pansy and Pansy grabbed it gracefully, both of them walking towards the Great Hall.
-"He's been double-shifting every day since your little fight."- Blaise told him. Pansy sipped her butterbeer.
Every now and then, when the halls were nearly empty, Harry would walk close enough to grab Draco's hand.
Potter might have not notice, because he was absolutely oblivious, but Draco noticed that although McGonagall's voice was firm and apparently calm, there was a light shake in it.
-“RUN! NOW!”- Draco yelled, throwing their wands at them. Hermione and Ron held hands, waiting for Harry. Harry watched as Draco and Narcissa held everyone off, giving them time.
-"What is it, Draco?"- He asked. Draco broke the contact and the light vanished as quickly as it had come.
A week after that, their relationship shifted again. They weren’t dating, but there were stolen kisses, midnight picnics, hands holding, hugs in Draco’s bed, and those ridiculous names that Harry hated (not really).
Draco stopped and then turned to face Harry and the latter didn't fail to notice the blush that covered Draco's cheeks. It was evident even in the dark because it contrasted with Draco's pale skin.
Painful memories of the Dark Lord touching him in places he didn’t want to be touched came rushing all at once. He could feel his breathing becoming harder.
Maybe it was because of that or maybe it was because Harry felt different that Draco realised that he liked touching Harry.
He was genuinely nice to everyone and he spoke with such a soft voice that it actually soothed Harry.
-“I reckoned you either had your reasons to keep quiet or you hadn’t realised. So ‘Mione and I let you take your time.”-
Two weeks went by and Harry was worried about Draco. Draco was very quiet and he barely ate. Blaise had expressed his concerns as well but Draco had dismissed them, telling them both that he was perfectly fine and that there was nothing to worry about. Neither Harry nor Blaise knew the contents of the Howler, but it must have been something bad because Draco was never like this.
-"He needs you."- He said and kept walking. Harry gulped nervously and opened the door to reveal Draco crying. He had first met Draco in January. It was now October and he had never seen Draco cry. Draco usually wore a bored face, but here he was, crying in his bed and hugging his pillow.
-“Mate, these rumours about you are crazy! You protecting Malfoy? Really?”- Ron snorted as he grabbed another piece of chicken.
-"They said they can't guarantee anything but they want to try a new magical surgery in January. This one might help if not to regain completely my eyesight, to help me to see in at least 50%." - Draco explained. Blaise hummed in response, because he didn't trust his voice to be steady in that moment,
Until he was able to reach Draco with his hands if he wanted to. But he didn't want to. He wanted Draco to step down.
-“You…won’t tell anyone about…-about what you saw today, right?”- Harry shook his head and Draco nodded in relief.
-"Oh, you bet I'm gonna. It's all about the D, Draco."- Blaise smirked and winked at him before following Pansy.
After Zabini had finally told him that Draco had had a surgery and that he needed time to heal, Harry was restless. He was in a horrible mood and he was always on edge.
He told Draco about how shocked and in awe he felt the first time he saw the castle in the distance.
-“If you wanna make out, do it in your free time, Nott. Right now, Umbridge is looking for you.”- Blaise said through gritted teeth.
-"Very much so. I had this whole death thing planned in my head but now here I am, listening to lame stories from you."- Harry laughed.
What Harry didn’t know was that Draco’s family had threatened him to hurt Harry if he didn’t follow the rules.
-“Course not! I need a break from Ron’s snores anyway. He always forgets to cast the silencing charm.”- Harry said with a laugh.
Harry was very much enjoying his treacle tart in peace when he heard the snickers and the whispers. His head shot up to watch what had instigated the interruption to his very (not) nutritious breakfast.
-“You have been protecting that boy for so many years. How do I know you’re not lying?”- Bellatrix asked.
-“G-Granger! What are y-you doing in here?”- Draco asked, rather nervously. Hermione’s face softened a bit.
-"It's a long story, but basically um...he's blind because he helped me during the war. And he was getting bullied in here, so I felt like it was my responsibility to help him."- Harry defended his actions.
Harry had learned how much Draco liked routines and him doing his hair was one of them. Seeing Draco like that made Harry blush.
Draco Malfoy was walking through the Great Hall, along with Blaise Zabini on his left and Pansy Parkinson on his right.
Now, Draco had spoken with professor Lupin before and he was very nice. When Harry had told Lupin about their relationship, Lupin had smiled and said:
treated him kindly for once."- Narcissa mumbled through gritted teeth. Then, she turned to Harry with a sigh and a smile,
-"Potions, charms, alchemy, herbology, and defence against the dark arts."- Draco told him. Harry hummed and they both stayed in silence.
-“I’m so sorry, Draco. I forgot.”- She said quietly, raising her hands in surrender and backing away from Draco to give him space.
They headed down to breakfast together with Pansy. After everything that had happened, Draco was sure he had been blessed by the heavens with such good friends. Blaise and Pansy cared for him and he cared for them as well.
Harry didn't even think about it. He kissed Draco softly, with so much care and affection, that Draco felt safe for the first time in a long time. After that incident, Harry did his investigation in silence and boy, did it paid in the end.
-“I have nothing to hide. So get the fuck away from me.”- Draco said slowly and dangerously. Nott clicked his tongue.
-"It's not really as bad as you think."- Ron told him with a knowing smile. Draco looked at Ron in confusion but said nothing.
-"No matter how much of a prat you are."- Harry added with a smirk. Draco shoved him playfully and sat on his bed, setting the tray in front of him. He glanced at the food and then at Harry.
And when they had come back to Hogwarts, Draco was back at square one and Harry couldn’t understand why.
Harry melted but the back of his brain was screaming angry warning because how dared they treat Draco like that.
-“Harry! Are you even listening?”- Hermione’s eyes travelled to the boy Harry was currently watching. Draco Malfoy. How convenient.
-“You are the best of our class in Potions, and there’s this part I really don’t understand. Could you help me?”-
-"Draco! Nonsense, come in."- Harry encouraged with a small smile. Ginny was holding Harry's right hand and Draco felt something weird on his chest.
-"OKAY! You're up for it, then? You can't really say no, you know."- Harry said, effectively interrupting Ron.
’ with you befriending the ferret. You could befriend Moaning Myrtle for all I care, but the fact that you hid it from us all this time!? What if something had happened to you, huh!? What if he hadn’t changed!? I’m thankful he did but what if he hadn’t, Harry? What then, huh?”- Ron said with pain in his voice.
Harry nodded and they didn’t spoke anymore after that, but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes in the book.
Not that he was going to tell anyone though. Pansy could and would hex the life out of him if someone else found out.
-"So, how's your first gala going?"- He asked instead. Harry made a mental note to ask Draco about that later. Harry groaned.
-“Fleur incantatem, fleur incantatem, fleur..”- his sobs kept him from getting more flowers on his wrist. The Dark Mark was fully covered in them, but it was still there. It would always be there.
-“I haven’t been scared since you started looking out for me. Asides from Pansy, Blaise, and Luna, you were the only person to treat me like an actual human being.”- Draco admitted.
-"Yes! I...well.."- Harry ran his hands through his hair exasperatedly. Now that he remembered, Malfoy hadn't look at him once during the trial. Malfoy, Harry recalled, seemed to be frozen on his spot. Realisation hit him,
-"Nope. Not falling for this one, Malfoy. You double-shift way too much and you need a break. Take a day off and.."-
It was a beautiful day. Draco inhaled and sighed happily. The sun was still rising and his flowers were awakening.
He even was happy to be able to finally do essays without the threat of imminent death knocking at his door.
-“May I ask you something?”- Harry asked, once he felt comfortable enough with Draco. They were in the Room of Requirement because Draco needed a bit of peace after someone had hexed him (Harry had hexed said person back while Draco apologised quietly). Draco nodded,
-"What?"- Harry asked when he realised that Draco was just standing there watching him. Draco shook his head and turned around to walk away but stopped at the door.
Draco stopped humming but didn’t seem to be startled. He turned to Harry and patted an empty spot next to him.
-“Ah, ah, ah...I wouldn’t do that if I were you. At least I’m a man. Is it not better that I do it?”- Nott whispered before forcing himself onto Draco.
He noticed that Harry was eating less as the weeks went by. He noticed how Harry’s eye bags were noticeable one day and gone the next, meaning that he was glamouring them. He noticed the fake smiles, and how Harry didn’t seem happy. He noticed how Harry disappeared at least two times a week.
Draco stopped playing and looked up at Harry with tears in his eyes. Harry sat down beside him quietly.
Harry wanted to say something, but bit his lip to keep his mouth shut and started picking up Malfoy's things in silence instead.
For a moment, Harry thought Draco hadn't heard him, but seconds later Draco opened the door. He eyed curiously at the tray Harry was carrying and let him in. Harry observed Draco's room. His wallpaper was a faded posh, patterned-green (much like his own) with silver details all around the room. The cealing had been enchanted so that Draco had a magnificent view of a galaxy.
-"Ron, 'Mione, please bring Headmistress McGonagall."- Harry told them. Hermione and Ron nodded with wide eyes and quickly went to look for McGonagall. Harry sighed tiredly and turned to Malfoy, who was struggling to get his things.
-“Williams, to my office. Now. Zabini, take Mr. Malfoy to the Hospital Wing.”- She commanded. Draco shook his head vigorously.
-“This is going to hurt for a moment. Stay still, alright?”- she said. Draco tried to smile at her but it looked more like a grimace.
Draco and Luna had become really good friends and Harry took his chance one time when Draco was studying with Luna at the library.
-“You never know, you could even accidentally create an Obscurus inside of you because of all that suppressed magic.”-
-"Lucius!"- Narcissa exclaimed horrified, but Draco had already stormed out. They ate the rest of their dinner in silence. When they were done, Harry went straight to his room and called for one house elves, Dobby.
-“May I hold your hand?”- Blaise asked softly. Surprisingly, his friend nodded and Blaise held his hand tight.
Sure enough, Draco felt a sudden rush of giddiness that didn't came neither from him nor his friends.
-“You need to go. You’re gonna miss the first dance.”- Draco told him, reluctantly pulling away from him.
No matter how much of a prat he was, Harry Potter deserved to be happy. And Draco was going to help him.
-“Breathe with me, Draco.”- Blaise whispered soothingly. They breathed together for a long time. They breathed together until Draco’s gasps stopped. Until he felt like he could breathe again.
-"You don't understand! I embarrassed myself in front of him, Blaise!"- Draco said dramatically, burying his face in his hands.
-“Like hell I’m leaving you here. Not with Malfoy around out of all people.”- He told Harry firmly. Harry sighed.
When Draco found himself in a hospital bed, he knew immediately what had happened. He also understood something when he
-“Harry.”- Draco breathed. Harry had invited him to have lunch outside with Ron and Hermione, the pair immersed in a game of Wizard’s Chess.
-"Are we in a session, Mind Healer Malfoy?"- Harry asked amusedly. A pink tint graced Draco's cheeks.
He cleared his throat, trying to focus on the fire place in front of them because he felt like he was invading Harry's privacy.
Draco’s mind could only think about Harry back and forth, back and forth, back and forth as they kissed.
Not even Draco himself was able to understand what was going on with him. All he knew was that he could
By the end of it, Draco felt like he was going to pass out from how much pain and exhaustion he was feeling.
Harry had tried to contact him in at first, sending Hedwig once per week. Draco would take the letter from Hedwig, feed her, and then send her back without anyone noticing it.
-"Don't touch him!"- Draco exclaimed harsher than he had intended to. Everyone looked at him confusedly and Draco couldn't stand all those emotions at once.
-"Sorry, I couldn't help myself. I'll go now."- Harry sighed, unwrapping his arms from Draco. Draco turned to face him and gave him a peck on his lips.
-“I just realised something and it took me a while to calm down because I kinda…freaked out.”- Harry admitted.
-"Oh, I couldn't help myself! It's just...he's so infuriating and Mother does nothing about it. I mean, she tries but she's scared of him. I don't even know how you got into this fucked up family in the first place."- Draco told him.
-“Are you sure? I know that you uh..that you don’t like..well, touching people.”- Harry admitted, but much to his surprise, Draco simply shrugged.
-"If you say so. You still should eat a bit. We're not getting anything else 'til tomorrow."- Ron shrugged and ate his chicken.
-“Alright then, shall I cast new butterflies?”- Harry nodded and Draco casted new butterflies on Harry’s skin.
-“But I trust you. If the rumours are true, then I don’t mind as long as you know what you’re doing.”- He continued. Hermione gasped.
-"I don't know. I just feel like a lot of people expect me to be an Auror or a Curse Breaker or something."- Harry said.
-“You came! Come sit, I made some pastries.”- Harry said with a grin, making Draco’s heart swell with affection.
-“Come on, you twat. I don’t bite.”- Harry teased. Draco sighed and turned to Harry, hesitantly putting his arm around Harry’s waist and resting his head on Harry’s chest.
In the weeks that followed, Harry spent more and more time with Draco, finding his presence quite calming. Draco became the definition of soft.
-“I’ve been good, thanks for asking.”- Draco replied softly, and politely. It was quite a shock to Harry. He hadn’t heard him speak since the war and was quiet surprised at how much his tone had changed.
do something while we were gone?”- Harry heard Ron asking angrily, but he didn’t get to hear the answer. He had the feeling he didn’t want to know it anyways.
Perhaps because Draco's worst fear was what he used to be, which could only mean that he was working on becoming a better version of himself.
-“Is your head full of nargles again?”- Luna had asked. Draco had rolled his eyes, the faintest hint of a smile gracing his mouth.
-"You should go find him."- Hermione encouraged. Harry stopped pacing around and nodded at Hermione, determination written in his eyes.
Harry would wait for Draco and walk him to his classes. This happened a few times but not so often that people would get suspicious. After all, the only classes they shared were Transfiguration and Potions.
-“Coming mate?”- Harry shook his head and Ron shrugged, walking away and leaving a flustered Hermione behind.
-"It's fine. I don't really see them all that much anyways. Lucius is always working and Narcissa is at the gardens most of the times."- Harry told him.
-"You had to pick today out of all days to go public. You couldn't have kissed him yesterday."- Ron complained sorrowful, handing his money to Blaise.
Narcissa showed Harry around and the latter one was impressed. Narcissa opened the door of what it seemed to Harry was going to be his new room. The room was bigger than his cupboard. It was actually bigger than any other place he had been in. It was beautifully decorated with a faded red-patterned wallpaper and golden details.
It wasn't really hard to be by himself at Howgarts now that he was blind. The castle's magic guided him through the corridors and helped him out whenever he needed it. Plus, he knew how to do wandless magic.
That moment, Harry bursts through the doors, splintering them into shards without even lifting his wand.
Draco in heels, Harry can't stop staring, at the pub, re-connecting after years, mutual attraction, Draco x Harry, tribble
Harry blinks in horror as he realises he has Malfoy pushed up against the alley wall, his hands either side of Malfoy’s head. Harry’s groin presses hard against Malfoy’s, effectively pinning him in place.
‘On your back,’ Harry commanded, his whole body aching with anticipation at the easy way Draco obeyed him, falling back against Harry’s tumbled bedsheets, biting his lip as he looked up at him.
He pulled away, and Hermione watched as he stalked over to Harry, still sprawled indolently across their sofa. ‘As for you, Potter,’ Draco said, his voice sharper. Harry leaned further back, let his legs spread wider apart. Draco didn’t take the bait, his eyes fixed firmly on Harry’s face. ‘I want you naked
‘Now, Potter, look here—’ Robards tries reasoning with him, but Harry is incandescent with rage. This
Harry was already waiting by the fireplace, his dark hair as messy as always, his glasses sitting crooked on his nose, framing his brilliant green eyes. His forehead was crumpled into a habitual scowl, but when he looked up at Draco, his face relaxed and his eyes lit up. A small smile tugged at the corner of his lips as his gaze dropped to Draco’s darned emerald jumper, emblazoned with an enormous silver
Hermione sat still and tall at the table, keeping her eyes on the parchments in front of her. It had seemed a good idea at the time, to bring some paperwork home to finish over the weekend, but right now she couldn’t quite remember what she was supposed to be working on.
Charlie Weasley, fresh from Romania, chuckled and let his mother hug him for several long minutes, before he gently unwound her arms from his waist. ‘Good to see you too, Mum,’ he smiled, then his eyes flitted upwards. They sparkled as they ran over his family, before settling on Draco, hovering towards the back of the crowd.
‘Merlin,’ Draco murmurs, and Harry looks up again, wanting to see what Draco is thinking. His brows are drawn over his silver eyes, and understanding dawns in his gaze. ‘No one else knows, do they?’
As Harry gets to his feet, however, a silvery terrier bursts into the room. Harry and Hermione watch in shocked silence, and when it starts speaking, Ron’s worried voice emanates from its mouth.
And then: flashes of bodies entwined, of desperate kisses and heated touches and agonising, all-consuming lust.
‘I want you naked,’ Harry whispered against Draco’s ear, already reaching down for the hem of his shirt. ‘And then on your back beneath me.’
Draco holds his breath, his whole body tingling with the adrenaline of the suspects’ - and Potter’s - presence.
‘I have to go out.’ Draco strode into the room, fastening the buttons on his shirtsleeves. He was wearing those dark blue trousers Hermione loved, and the matching cloak with the silver clasp Harry bought him last Christmas. His white-blond hair was swept back, accentuating his high cheekbones and flashing silver eyes.
So he does, dragging his tongue along the delicious length of him, suckling the head and finally tasting his salty-sweet essence.
Harry barely feels it, a mere wasp sting to his werewolf strength, and Pettigrew’s stink of fear grows as the realisation he is facing a fully grown werewolf the night before the full moon sinks in.
… trying to resist Harry was almost impossible. He worshipped her, and loved to push Draco as far as he could: a recipe for disaster, really.
If she broke the rules, then Percy would pull her onto his lap, bending her over and wrenching her pencil skirt over her hips, and spank her until her bum was red and burning and her cunt throbbing.
Harry sighed happily, feeling Draco’s come slowly leaking from him as his own dried over both of them. Nudging Draco’s arm, Harry snuggled up into his side. He nuzzled against Draco’s chest, placed a gentle kiss on the silver of a scar.
Draco nods wordlessly, and tightens his feeble grip on Harry’s chest as he turns sharply and pulls them away in a swirl of violent motion.
The scars and the Mark and the bruises from Harry’s mouth are covered once more, a secret only the two of them share.
They’re on patrol again in the early evening. By now Harry is starting to enjoy it, the freedom from the office, the familiar loops around Diagon and Horizont, the diversions into Knockturn. He realises he even quite likes having Malfoy by his side, his presence almost comforting. They walk shoulder to shoulder, always with Malfoy to Harry’s left, making the most of his left-handed advantage in the case of needing to use their wands. Harry waves his hand to cast a surreptitious
He closes the gap between them, kisses Neville the way he’s always wanted: slow, and soft, and with the reverence he deserves.
They perch together on a wall next to Flourish and Blotts, beneath a powerful Notice-Me-Not cast by Harry, and watch in companionable silence as people dash by, looking from Flourish and Blotts to Fortescue’s on the other side, their eyes sliding right over Harry and Malfoy. It makes Harry think wistfully of his first visit to wizarding London with Hagrid, and how the Muggles didn’t seem to notice the Leaky Cauldron. He’s so caught up in his thoughts, Harry is woefully unprepared for what next comes out of Malfoy’s mouth.
Ron soon joins them, Flooing back as soon as he hears what happened. He pulls Harry into a rough, heartfelt hug, making Harry settle a little bit more. Harry hardens himself to the pain in his chest, the hollow feeling of heartbreak rattling through him like a wind through a long-dead carcass, picked clean of everything that once made it vibrant and alive.
Harry knows, from the silence that lingers between him and Ron, that he is being unreasonably irritable. They’re in the Ministry cafeteria drinking weak tea and sharing a slice of lemon drizzle cake, and Ron keeps giving him what he clearly thinks is a surreptitious look of worry.
Draco marches straight to the back of the library, to the dedicated Potions section. He has fond memories being in here as a child with his godfather: Severus would sit with young Draco at his feet, reading missives to him from complex Potions texts in his low, sibilant voice. It hadn’t mattered that Draco hadn’t understood the words, he only remembered the feeling of magic, of being special, that being with Severus, here, had given him.
He wonders if Draco has friends he can confide in, about the war, about his family, about taking the Mark. He looks up at Draco, too much alcohol making his vision fuzzy, almost like he needs glasses again. He can just about make out Draco smile indulgently at him.
‘It was pretty obvious.You’ve got muscles upon muscles and don’t wear your glasses anymore, whenever I’ve seen you investigate a crime scene or a suspect the first thing you do is
‘He will! And he specifically said I wasn’t allowed to touch,’ she added, uncrossing her legs and squirming in her seat. She wanted to touch herself, so badly. She could feel how wet she was, and her whole body was wound tight. It wouldn’t take much, to push her over the edge… ‘No!’ she cried out, even though Harry hadn’t said anything else. He smiled, a devious, wicked smile, and Hermione briefly considered that he would have been well-suited to Slytherin house.
‘Potter,’ Draco replies civilly, priding himself on the mildness of his own tone compared to Potter.
Especially not to Draco, some deep, dark part of him realises. He shakes his head and clasps his takeaway cup tightly, keeping his eyes trained on the cobbled ground.
barged in front of his face. Harry almost snapped at him. Only a hasty, calming hand from Draco on his shoulder stopped him.
Harry Apparates them to the closest point to the Society, a little alleyway opposite the red-bricked building in Kensington, the Society entrance guarded by a Muggle repelling charm. For a moment after he lands, Harry is in a strange daze, caught up in a blissful feeling of hard, deliciously-scented hedonism.
‘I just don’t want you to get hurt,’ he admits, his voice barely a whisper, as his wolf whines along with him.
It was an easy decision to have a quiet wedding, just the two of them. In the wilds of Romania they were married by Charlie Weasley, while a pair of Horntails chased each other playfully through the skies above.
With that, Harry spins out of the room, Draco walking shoulder to shoulder with him, as they leave their boss, silent and anxious, behind them.
Harry is surprised by those words. It had never occurred to him that Malfoy might not have been in the country at all, after the war.
before tossing it on the floor. He grabbed Harry’s hair, yanking him up into a sitting position and depositing Hermione next to him.
The DMLE archives sounded a lot more impressive than they actually are. In reality, the archives are a dark, cramped, cupboard, about big enough to fit two people at a push.
Draco gave a frustrated sob in response, and Harry took pity on him, pushing him back towards the bed.
As if sensing his change of mood, Draco gives Harry a gentle nudge with his shoulder. ‘We don’t have to talk about this stuff anymore, if you don’t want,’ he offers quietly.
and writhing beneath him in pleasure mere minutes before. Harry smiled into his skin, cradling his hand possessively around Draco’s hip. There was a moment of contented silence, and Draco kissed Harry’s hair.
Harry looks glumly into his half-empty glass as he confesses this, and sighs unhappily. He always tries not to dwell on his affliction, the way his life had changed, the way he was now utterly beholden to the moon and its fickle, ever-changing ways. But sometimes, especially with the melancholic help of alcohol, it was hard to avoid.
The pub Harry takes them to is close to London Bridge. The evening commuter rush is in full flow, and Draco finds himself sticking close by Harry’s side as they battle their way through the crowds of Muggles. The pub is nice enough, dark and dingy and quiet, with a few old men silently nursing beers at the bar. Harry nudges Draco in the direction of a corner table, tucked far away from the bar and the other patrons, and Draco makes his way over to claim it as Harry braves the bar.
Draco awakens slowly, pain chasing through every nerve, swaying as if he’s sat on his mother’s garden swing, a child again. He breathes in, smells something familiar and comforting, and presses up against the warm, firm bulk that cradles him.
Molly laughed her warm, infectious laugh, the one that had the power to warm Draco from the inside. ‘Oh, absolutely,’ she agreed merrily. They carried on chatting, breaking to greet Ron and Hermione when they stepped through the Floo. Ron gave Draco an awkward nod as always, and Hermione, very pregnant and glowing with it, stood up on tiptoes to press her lips against Draco’s cheek.
Harry doesn’t even bother reaching for his wand. He just closes his eyes, ignores Ron crying out ‘Harry, stop! You’ll hurt yourself!’, and turns on the spot, tearing down the DMLE wards around him with a grunt of pain, and Apparates away.
Malfoy looked him up and down, slowly, and smiled as he waved his hand and the stool next to him slid smoothly out. Harry perched on top of it, flagging down the bartender and ordering two more Firewhiskies.
Draco’s face fell, pain flooding his features before he could pull up his emotional walls that he was so well-practiced in. He’d probably been using them to hide his hilarity at the thought of Harry actually falling for him and his stupid ruse.
Draco steps back hastily, until his back is against the wall of the room, and watches on in horror as the silvery moonlight slowly crawls through the window and Harry’s body breaks and bends and rebuilds itself. Harry howls with pain all the way through, as his bones crack and his skin stretches, and Draco covers his ears with his hands against the terrible noises.
Hermione met him at the door and pulls him in for a hard, long, hug, making sure to rub her cheek across his face so he was drenched in her comforting scent.
Harry stood before the mirror, face pale, eyes sad. As Draco watched, he lifted his hand to his scar, tracing the jagged lines dazedly.
‘Here,’ Draco murmured to Harry, using his wand to slice off a generous serving of Molly’s treacle tart. She made it without fail, every week, and everyone knew she did it for Harry.
‘Let’s not disappoint our wonderful boss,’ Harry mutters, and he is momentarily stunned when Malfoy gives him a look of genuine amusement, his lips curling into a smile, his even, white teeth flashing, his silver eyes crinkling.
‘Good work, gentlemen. You’ll find your desks have already been moved next to each other,’ he adds as he turns back to his parchment.
Draco watches from across the paddock, filling in the Hungarian Horntail’s details for its annual health check.
‘Wouldn’t want that to happen, would we?’ Malfoy says quietly in return, and Harry allows himself to laugh shortly in response.
Malfoy denied him for months before arriving at Grimmauld Place, immaculately dressed, orange tigerlilies in hand, scowl on his face. He took Harry to an expensive restaurant in Diagon Alley. Harry’s favourite part was the long, sweet kiss Draco gave him beneath the stars afterwards.
They land at Grimmauld Place, in the hallway just outside Harry’s bedroom. Draco is in Harry’s arms, warm and soft and compliant, and Harry can’t help nuzzling against him as they land, breathing in the scent of him. He lowers Draco carefully to his feet, and backs him against the wall, pinning him in place, giving a satisfied purr when he smells the arousal simmering around Draco. Then Draco shifts, and winces, and the bitter scent of pain blooms in the air, making Harry’s heart constrict.
Draco held her waist, anchoring her firmly to his muscled thigh. With a whine, Hermione started to rock against him, feeling her dampness leak onto the rich material of his clothes. It didn’t take long, straddled on Draco, his thigh providing the perfect surface to grind against. Harry had already gotten her so close, and when Draco released her waist to pinch her nipple between his finger and thumb, Hermione’s body went limp, collapsing against Draco, as she came over his thigh, her own legs trembling.
Draco, eyes still averted, nods in agreement, and Potter Disapparates with a thunderous crack, leaving Draco alone in the alley, his breathing uneven and his heart beating wildly.
, beneath Harry’s. The scent of his lust curling around them both, fanning Harry’s magic like a bellows to the flame. He remembered the pinpoint focus of his own mind, the way he’d instinctively tightened his grip on Draco, the first
Harry was used to the smell of fear. Even though people didn’t know what he was, most of them could sense something about him, something strange, something dangerous. Even the Muggles seemed to sense it. If he didn’t keep a tight control on his emotions, he noticed people cower away, the air sharpened with the sour smell of terror, when he spoke or moved.
Draco leaned down, drew him into a biting, bruising kiss that left Harry gasping for breath when he pulled away. Draco manhandled him into the position he wanted, until Harry was on his stomach, his face between Hermione’s thighs, Draco behind him. Draco leaned down, placed a kiss on Harry’s bum, before biting down, making Harry wince and rock his hips into the sofa. Hermione reached down, curling her hands in his thick, dark hair, and his green eyes locked onto hers, even as Draco reached around and - judging by the way Harry’s eyes unfocused slightly and his breath caught - grabbed hold of his neglected cock.
‘Honestly, Potter,’ Draco says softly, taking his elbow and helping him to his feet. ‘I thought werewolves were supposed to be able to handle their liquor.’
Harry settles into some outstanding paperwork, idly replying to an interdepartmental memo from Hermione inviting him over for dinner on Friday evening. The smell of the bullpen has faded a little now, thankfully.
let Malfoy get to him. His heart aches painfully in his chest, and his breathing is tight, laboured. His ears are buzzing, and he shakes his head like a dog, trying to clear his aching thoughts.
Harry has the good grace to look abashed, flashing Draco a guilty smile. ‘Er, yeah,’ he admits. ‘I try not to — I don’t want people to think I’m a show-off, you know?’
Potter’s voice is low, warning, as he pushes Draco up against the wall, cheek and chest pressed against the bricks. Potter’s body covers him completely, chest to back. One large hand grips Draco’s waist, holding him still. The other casts a non-verbal Disillusionment over both of them, trickling over the crown of Draco’s head and down his body like ice-water. Potter places his hand flat on the wall, next to Draco’s face, and he can feel Potter’s breath against his hair.
Harry’s head fell, his green eyes dazed. ‘Fuck,’ he muttered, and his fingers gripped Hermione’s thighs, hard enough to bruise. He tried to push himself back, but Draco held onto Harry’s hips, holding him impaled in place.
Harry is already casting a wandless charm to slick up his fingers, quickly working Draco open before impatiently sinking himself back into him. They both groan, and Draco whines helplessly as Harry grips his hips and starts thrusting into him, hard and deep, letting Draco’s tight heat around his cock chase away any coherent thoughts he may have been capable of having. He knew he wasn’t going to last long again, not through the intimacy of having quick, dirty, morning sex with a deliciously dishevelled Draco. Of knowing that Draco is safe at last, safe in Harry’s arms. With a groan he reaches for Draco’s cock again, finding it fully hard now, and leaking. He runs his thumb over the wetness at the head, and then begins to wank Draco off as he carries on fucking deep into him.
‘This isn’t even an important case,’ he hisses to Draco, as if they’re already partway through a conversation.
Longbottom is the next to arrive, and he gives Draco a friendly enough wave, which he returns. Most of them have been good to him, in their own way, at least considering what Draco knows he deserves.
Malfoy just gives him a sharp nod of his head, getting to his feet and elegantly stretching his long, lean body as Harry tries desperately not to look. Instead he finishes his tea, feeling the steam hiss out of his ears. He scrambles to his own feet and follows Malfoy as he breaks the Notice-Me-Not and stalks back towards the Ministry.
The Horntail almost falls backwards in its surprise. It’s enough for the other handlers to cast their charms, bringing it carefully down as Potter pulls Charlie to safety.
‘Good,’ he replied, ‘that’s good. Me too. Although right now,’ he added, wrapping his fist around Draco’s leaking cock, ‘I’m going to ride you.’
Draco’s captors are stunned into silence at Harry’s presence, until the mousy-haired man gulps and takes a trembling step forward.
‘Come for me, Draco,’ Harry orders, his lips brushing the shell of Draco’s ear. Draco groans and arches, his cock pulsing in Harry’s hand as he comes with a cry, spilling hot come onto Harry’s skin.
Draco gets so far into the swing of his task that he doesn’t notice Potter is there until he speaks.
Harry opens his mouth, whether to say something or suck a bruise into Draco’s throat, he’s not sure. Before he can do either, twilight fades and the moon rises, and Harry drops to his knees with a grunt of pain.
‘Thanks, sweetheart,’ Harry replied, and Draco felt a warm fuzziness overcome him at the endearment as it tumbled so easily from Harry’s lips. Harry’s hand returned to Draco’s thigh beneath the table, squeezing as if to say
With that Draco started to thrust slowly into Harry, taking hold of Harry’s cock again and slowly working that too. Hermione stroked Harry’s hair, whispered words to him she wasn’t even aware of, and watched as he slipped blissfully into subspace.
‘Wasn’t part of the plan?’ Harry snarls in response, and Pettigrew raises his wand. ‘No, the plan was
Harry can’t help the growl, low in his throat, but Draco either doesn’t hear it or doesn’t care, stalking towards the Society entrance without looking back.
Ignoring the pang of grief he feels for his godfather, Draco instead focuses on the books in front of him, running his fingers over the familiar leather of the spines as he searches. He spots the book he wants, pulls it free, cracks open the creaky spine. The pages are beautifully illuminated, and Draco finds the page he’s looking for. His eyes scan the page, and a quick, satisfied smile breaks through.
‘Mr Weasley?’ she replied, sugar sweet and pliant. He raised a knowing eyebrow over the frame of his horn-rim glasses.
Draco smiled and walked across the crowded room to his boyfriend, letting his hand brush for the tiniest moment over the front of Harry’s jeans.
Harry groaned, and Draco grasped his chin, staring at him. ‘Yes, sir,’ Harry bit out, arching his hips as he did. Draco ignored the move, releasing Harry and giving Hermione another look.
kind of thoughts about Malfoy as his hand drifts further down his body. His cock is hard, hopeful - never mind Harry hasn’t had sex in about three years, and barely touches himself anymore. He doesn’t like giving his wolf side any additional excuses to prowl beneath the surface of his skin.
: naked, bronzed, an avenging god reborn: Harry Potter kisses the scars on your abdomen that he put there, with a single word shouted in anger, two years before.
‘Where is he?’ Harry manages to bite out, and he doesn’t miss the worried look Ron throws over his shoulder.
Draco always chose the booth right at the back of the Leaky Cauldron, sitting with his back against the wall, nursing a Firewhisky. He’d cast a Notice-Me-Not over them - his were particularly strong - and give Harry a meaningful glance.
,’ Harry snarled, his voice low and trembling from the amount of control it was taking not to rip Draco’s throat out right now. ‘You utter, treacherous bastard. I
‘What about your trousers?’ she whispered, her cheeks warming as she realised she was so wet she’d leave an instant mess over him.
His eyes flutter open, squint against bright red material, the focus on the swaying of rambling gardens around him. He looks up, and realises Harry is cradling him, carrying him to safety away from Lestrange Manor.
Harry feels like insects are crawling beneath his skin, making him hot and itchy and irritable. His wolf is ready to explode.
It had taken a long while to get used to Harry calling him Draco, shouting at him with affection instead of hatred, back at the beginning. Now, those days of rivalry were a distant, blurred memory; a time not worth remembering.
Overstimulation, teasing, edging, orgasm denial, D/s elements, Dom Draco, Sub Harry, Harry x Draco, drabble
Draco groans, Fiendfyre chasing through his veins, as Harry kisses him with bitten lips. Fingers grip at his hips, marking pale skin with bruises of possession:
between them. Their toast to new beginnings seemed to ring true for both of them, and as the drinks flowed, so did their conversation. Malfoy had vetoed any beer, after the first, instead buying them round after round of a rich, sweet drink Harry didn’t recognise, with Muggle money Harry tried hard not to be surprised to see him with.
headlines that would cause. Ron gave him another look of concern, and Harry works hard not to snarl in his direction.
‘Doing what?’ Harry blurts out. They turn the corner into Knockturn, the shopfronts turning dark and grimy. Harry sees the slight movement of Draco’s arm and knows he’s brushing his fingertips along his wand, holstered around his thigh. Knockturn makes Harry feel the same, his hackles rising ever-so-slightly.
They slowly pull apart, and Draco snuggles back against Harry’s body, not uttering a word of complaint about the hot, sticky come that leaks from him and covers them both.
The second hooded figure almost stumbles as she passes them, and replies to her partner. ‘He’s not bloody well here now, is he?’ she snarls. ‘Better not tell him we had a chance and lost it. He’ll be angry…’ Her next words are swallowed by the walls as she moves past them.
rolls off Draco at Harry’s words, and it turns him almost feral. With a snarl he lifts Draco’s thighs onto his shoulders, runs his hands down the back of his thighs, and curls them around his perfect arse, one palm cradling each cheek. With a grasp on Draco, he pulled his hips into the air, pulls him apart, and settles his mouth on Draco’s tight hole.
He falls obediently to his knees; uses that clever lover’s tongue of his to send me into blissful prayer.
the moon by then, the change that’s coming. Even without the potion, I think I’d be pretty bad-tempered.’
Harry surged forward, capturing Draco’s lips with his. He wrapped his arms around him, pulling him close, groaning into his mouth as he felt how hard Draco already was, pressing insistently against his hip. Harry licked Draco’s lips, urging him to part them, and slid his tongue against Draco’s when he did.
solid warmth that lies beside him in bed. He nuzzles his nose into soft, sweet-smelling hair, breathing deeply and stroking his hand up a lean, lightly-muscled back. He opens his eyes as he returns to full consciousness, a slow smile curling on his lips as he sees Draco in his arms, naked and pale and beautiful in the morning sunlight, even as he sleeps. He kisses the back of his neck, running his hand up along his chest, and presses up against him so his already-hard cock nudges against Draco’s delectable arse.
Hermione adjusted her Gryffindor tie and pulled up the soft grey socks over her knees. Her heart fluttered nervously as she cast a quick
Draco watches, unnoticed, as the woman at the bar serves Harry. He sees the shiver of fear that ripples through her body when Harry isn’t looking, sees the wary way she pushes two full glasses towards him, stopping before he could accidentally brush his fingers against hers as he took them. Harry drops some Muggle money on the counter, and the look of relief on her face as she snatches it up and turns her back on him makes Draco want to jump over the bar and shake some sense into her.
‘For you?’ he replies, ‘I’ve waited far long enough.’ He kisses Draco before the smug little smirk gets too big, and then finally gives in to his urge to see Draco fully. He pushes up onto his knees between Draco’s thighs, gazing down at his long, lean body. Draco bites his lip as he watches, his eyebrow raised at Harry’s slow appraisal.
Draco recovered first, drawing his wand with a smirk and Transfiguring his and Theo’s clothes into Slytherin-coloured Hogwarts uniforms. Hermione lowered her book, pushing her chest out a little. In unison, Draco and Theo’s gazes dropped to her cleavage, emphasised by the barely-buttoned shirt and loosened tie.
Draco can’t help but rake his eyes over Potter’s body: he’s lean and strong, his emerald eyes blazing, his dark hair messy. Potter’s own dragon-leathers are green and new, and they make him look more like a rock star than a dragonologist.
That thought only grew stronger when Harry walks into the Head Auror’s office and finds Malfoy already sitting in one of the chairs opposite Robards, looking as effortlessly elegant and unimpressed as usual. Harry ignores him, instead giving a short nod to Robards.
to be punished, why you misbehave all the time.’ Harry frowned, and Draco stretched out, pressing the front of his body to Harry’s back, until his lips were at his ear. ‘But that’s not what you’re going to get today.’
The next time Harry walked into the DMLE, it was with a blazing fury in his heart and Draco Malfoy’s hand in his. He marches up to Robards’ office, Draco trailing just behind, ignoring the low mutters of the office around them. Harry throws open his boss’s door, to find Robards sitting at his desk, a resigned and wary expression on his face.
‘Potter,’ he states, needlessly, and Harry drops lower into his crouch and growls. ‘At last, we meet.’ Harry scoffs and takes a step forward, making the other man stumble backwards in alarm.
- sitting with Pansy Parkinson, smiling as they spoke. His hair was as icy as always, artfully styled, and Harry could see a plethora of silver earrings adorning his ear. A tight, black t-shirt stretched over his chest - Harry ached to run his fingers over the material, feeling the hardness of the body beneath - but it was Malfoy’s legs that Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from.
‘I’ve been watching you all night, Potter,’ Malfoy said, as he looked at Harry’s lips and reached up to stroke a long, elegant finger down his cheek. ‘About time you came over.’
‘Now, seeing as our patrol is over, we have to go back to the office and finish up our paperwork for the day,’ Draco says, speaking slowly and carefully again, a frown on his face. Harry has to grit his teeth to stop his wolf from growling angrily. He is not an idiot! ‘Potter?’ Draco adds, a look of concern flashing across his expression.
Harry pulls himself out of bed, heading straight to the shower. He turns it on as hot as it goes - his blood runs so hot now he can barely feel it otherwise - and strips quickly, stepping under the steaming stream of water with a satisfied sigh.
Harry wakes up late on Saturday morning, his head sore and his body aching. He curses under his breath, and summons a hangover potion to himself. He drinks it gratefully, the cool, minty feeling washing through him and clearing his head. He’s fully clothed, lying face-down on his bed. He vaguely remembers Apparating home - that was a bit of a risk, considering how tipsy he’d been - and a strange, comforting camaraderie blossoming between him and Malfoy.
‘Bloody charming,’ Ginny muttered, but without any actual anger. Draco had spent six months in Romania at the reserve as he worked towards his Magical Creature Care Mastery: he needed both that and Potions to become a magical creature Healer. To his surprise, Charlie had taken him under his wing and the two had become firm friends.
good, Draco,’ Harry pants, pushing away the wolf’s urge to pin Draco down and thrust eagerly into him until he comes.
‘It’s all right, mate,’ Ron said, as they stumble to a halt. ‘I know you start to get irritable this close to the moon.’
‘Did you catch the Potions special on the Wizarding Wireless last week?’ Molly asked now, waving her wand sharply at a knife on the counter so it burst to life and started frantically chopping up carrots.
There is a silence between him and Draco, when he finishes speaking, but it isn’t uncomfortable. More of a shared understanding. Harry wonders whether Draco has many friends, anymore: he barely seems to get involved with any of the Auror socials, and as far as Harry’s aware, he’s never deigned to accept a partner before him.
‘You all right, mate?’ Ron murmurs, just moving close enough to brush against Harry’s back. Harry leans back momentarily, Ron’s presence soothing him. The wolf in Harry recognises him as his beta, his second-in-command, and Ron’s scent and presence always has a calming effect on Harry.
Harry continued to move against Draco, slowly at first, easing himself open on Draco’s dick, getting used to the feel of him buried deep, then faster and faster. Soon he was sweaty and flushed and so,
She was soon lost to Harry’s mouth, to the blissful feel of him driving her to the edge. She ground her hips against his face, her knuckles pale on the armrest, and Harry kept holding himself still every few minutes, groaning into her cunt with hot, heavy breaths.
Before he can dwell on it, Potter drops a pile of case notes in front of Draco, and Draco jumps slightly at the dull thump as they land.
Trusting Ron to take care of things here, Harry strides over to Draco. With one yank of his hand, the manacles slide free from the wall like a knife from butter. A pulse of magic releases their cruel hold around Draco’s wrists, his pale skin bruised and purple beneath. Harry scoops him up, holds him close, and marches out of the room, ignoring the calls from Aurors to stay.
‘In your absence, Potter,’ Robards begin, his voice heavy. ‘It appears Malfoy dropped your assigned caseload and secretly started work on something else.’
The door to the library burst open, and Hermione heard scuffled footsteps as Theo and Draco stumbled to a halt. She looked up, hiding a smile at the silver and blue eyes that met hers, wide and disbelieving.
Harry groans in dismay as his dick starts to harden, but he doesn’t destroy the letter, this time. Instead he tucks it carefully into his pocket, hating himself, and turns away to find Hermione and try, desperately, to take his mind off Draco.
Harry stumbles as he lands, his eyes so blurred with tears it’s as if he needs glasses again. He wipes a hand across his face, pulling the evidence of his hurt away. He will
‘Feeling tetchy?’ he smirks, leaning back in his chair so his white shirt pulled deliciously tight over his chest.
. In he storms, as predicted, his lips curling in the semi-permanent snarl he has now. His green eyes, like chips of granite, settle on Draco, and the snarl increases.
Harry pulled off Draco’s black top, tossing it aside without a second thought. He took half a step back, holding his hands at Draco’s hips.
Draco wrinkles his nose as the pungent, unwashed smell of the man assaults his nostrils. ‘Who are you?’ he manages to croak, his throat sore and dry.
‘I like everything about you, Malfoy,’ he replied softly, and before Draco could come up with some scathing retort, Harry took his cock deep into his mouth.
He was going to have to get used to all the dog hair on the full moon, Draco thought to himself ruefully. He couldn’t stop the enormous smile that simple thought gave him.
‘With all due respect, sir,’ Malfoy starts. His words got more clipped when he was angry, and right now he sounded like he could give the Muggle royal family a run for their money. ‘I don’t think—’
‘Trust me,’ Harry said grimly, ‘no-one could get through those wards.’ They were strong enough, after all, to contain a werewolf on a full moon. ‘And I’m not too worried. The war may be long over, but plenty of people still want the thrill of seeing how the Boy Who Lived lives nowadays.’
‘Come on, Hermione,’ Harry said, his voice taking on a pleading tone. ‘You have to be naked when he gets back anyway,’ he added, and Hermione shook her head and turned back to her paperwork.
When they make their back up to the DMLE, Malfoy is waiting by his immaculate desk, his neatly pressed Auror robes back in place. His silver eyes flash when he looks up at Harry approaching, but the play of emotions is too quick for Harry to focus in on any one. A moment later Malfoy’s eyes are cool and considering again.
Malfoy looked him up and down, slowly, and smiled as he waved his hand and the stool next to him slid smoothly out. Harry perched on top of it, flagging down the bartender and ordering two more Firewhiskies.
Potter’s desk, however, looked as if a drunk house-elf had attempted to tidy it. Tea stains on the wood, no filing tray in sight, a bent and battered eagle quill thrown over a scrap piece of parchment with ink drying on the nib. There’s even a half-empty cup of tea and a smattering of biscuit crumbs left over from an afternoon tea break.
Potter just frowns, dumps his bag and takes off his outer Auror robes, leaving him in a crumpled white shirt and dark trousers that do nothing to hide his thick, muscular thighs. He yanks the lid off his tea, and takes a long drink of it, a small, satisfied sigh escaping him. He seems a little softer, afterwards, and places his cup down on Draco’s side of his desk. The fragrant steam rises lazily from the liquid, and Draco frowns slightly as he breathes in the scent. Tea - strong tea, maybe an Assam? - of course, but there’s something else in it, something sharp and herby and bitter, that niggles at Draco’s mind.
The cloaked figures reach the other end of the alleyway, hesitating and looking out before disappearing back into Knockturn Alley. Instantly Potter is far away from Draco, the Disillusionments lifted. He avoids Draco’s eyes, running a hand through his messy hair, and Draco bites his lips and looks away.
Draco smiled fondly and kissed him softly on the forehead. Of course he’d already found the box, but he hadn’t looked inside. And Harry giving him an inadvertent heads-up that tomorrow was the day was perfect really, as Draco had a velvet ring box of his own hidden away in his own sock drawer, waiting for just the right moment.
‘What’s up, Malfoy?’ Potter doesn’t look up, and his voice is mild - friendly, almost. For a moment Draco stares at him in surprised silence, then when Potter’s green eyes flash impatiently up to him, he shakes himself and replies.
‘You used us as bait.’ Harry doesn’t bother to temper the snarl that forces its way through with the words. To his credit, Robards barely flinches, and only the sharp spike of fear in the air lets Harry know he is flustered.
He breaks away just long enough to scoop Draco into back his arms, his legs either side of Harry’s waist, and carries him through to his bedroom, Draco’s mouth on Harry all the while. He throws him onto his bed, where Draco lands on his back, legs open and inviting, lips parted and eyes dark and molten.
‘My father wasn’t a traitor!’ Pettigrew squawks angrily, and with a slashing movement and a muttered curse a red stunner hits Harry in chest.
‘I’m fairly sure the Nott and Malfoy libraries are the only reason Granger’s put up with us for all these years now, sweetheart,’ Draco drawled self-deprecatingly, but Hermione could hear the smile in his voice.
Most people, if they found themselves pushed up against a wall with an angry werewolf panting over them, would have stank of it.
On his knees on the beer-sticky floor, crawling between Draco’s thighs beneath the table, Harry would pull open Draco’s trousers, free his gloriously thick cock, and swallow him down, the low sounds of the pub around them ringing in his ears.
close, his cock hard and leaking against his stomach. Draco writhed and gripped his hips harder and made adorable, tantalising little breathy sounds that drove Harry crazy.
‘I thought you wanted me naked, Potter,’ Draco said imperiously, the breathless catch in his voice betraying his drawling words. He pushed Harry back, and raised an eyebrow before turning to one side and bending at the waist, leaning down to unzip his ankle boot as if he were doing a yoga pose. Harry’s eyes were drawn instantly to the perfect, hard curve of his arse, exactly as Draco had no doubt planned, but as Draco’s fingers reached his boot, Harry stepped forward.
From the entrance to the alleyway, a pair of dark-cloaked figures scurry towards them, completely unaware of the Auror presence nearby. One of them is talking, his voice low and breathless.
Harry lets Draco tug him along, following him blindly as he leads them down a quiet alleyway near Cobb and Webb’s dark paraphernalia shop.
Ron is leading them, his red hair messy and his skin pale beneath his freckles. His eyes roam over the three prone bodies, over to Draco, unconscious and limp, and up to Harry. Ron’s eyes flash in sympathy.
‘You know,’ Draco said with an air of casualness, as the scent of sex curled around them like a double dose of Amortentia, ‘I wouldn’t be against doing this again. This, or… other things.’
Harry grunts in response, carefully pulling himself free until just the curved head of his cock is inside Draco, before sliding slowly back in. He can feel the wolf, straining, clamouring to take over, and Harry grits his teeth as his muscles start to tremble from the exertion of staying in control.
Harry stares in silence for a few long moments, his mind untangling the words Malfoy has just imparted on him.
When Harry had first brought - well, dragged, really - Draco along to a Burrow dinner, Draco had been partway through his Potions Mastery. He’d been more than pleasantly surprised to discover that Molly Weasley had been top of the class in Potions back in her day at Hogwarts. They had ended up deep in conversation, Draco absent-mindedly helping her with dinner. Ever since that day it had become a little tradition between the two of them: Draco helped Molly getting dinner ready, and he kept Molly up to date on the latest Potions news.
The day ended as perfectly as every other day did, now. In bed with Harry, chest to chest and face to face, their bare legs entangling beneath the crisp, clean bedsheets. Draco breathed in the familiar scent of Harry, smiled to himself as Harry gave an enormous, contented sigh that always seemed to precede him saying something painfully honest or unbearably romantic.
me, waiting to get some dirt on me so you could sell me out to the Prophet and see me fall from public grace. And all for some imagined retribution for your traitor of a father?’
Harry looked up to find Draco watching him expectantly, those sinful lips curved into a sinful smile, his Auror robes neatly in place. Harry grinned back, standing and grabbing his own robes, and they walked together to the elevator, where Draco’s delicious scent curled around Harry, and he stood just close enough so their arms brushed against each other.
Hermione whimpered unhappily, her heart beating uncomfortably, as she scrambled down from Harry. Draco drew his wand, waving it silently, and Harry groaned as his wrists were bound in an
‘Enough. Here’s what’s going to happen next.’ Harry feels Draco shift in interest next to him, his hand still warm and grounding on Harry’s arm. Robards eyes flickered briefly to where they are joined, then back up to Harry’s gaze, for once showing a glimmer of fear. ‘You’re going to promote Draco to full Auror. As you should have done as soon as he finished his probation,’ Harry adds, letting a flash of tooth show in his reprimand. Robards gulps and nods warily. Harry carries on. ‘I’m going to be partnered with Draco from now on. In just a few days he single-handedly managed to find the criminals
Harry grinned, and waved a lazy hand to obediently vanish his clothes, wandless and wordless. He only did these casual little displays of power in front of Draco and Hermione.
From the corner of her eye she could see Harry, his hand on his cock, his head thrown back as he slowly started to wank himself off.
‘Easy, mate,’ Ron soothes, and despite the reassuring engulfing of Ron’s scent around him, Harry is already snarling and pushing him away.
Harry can’t believe his eyes when he gets home late from the Ministry one dull, dragging Friday evening. He walks into the house -
He arrives at the DMLE before Potter, and slides into his chair with a sigh of relief. Hopefully he can at least finish his tea - delicately spiced chai from Brewmsticks, the new tea shop on Diagon Alley - before Potter storms in and spends all day glowering at him like an erumpent with toothache. Draco takes a sip of his tea, eyeing Potter’s desk, pushed up against his, with distaste. Draco’s desk is meticulously organised, with neat stacks of parchment case notes, a tidy in-tray, his raven feather quill and emerald green ink nestled on a silver and rosewood stand - the one concession he’d allowed himself to bring from the Manor to work - and a compartmentalised tray full of Muggle stationery, paperclips and bulldog clips and highlighters and sticky tabs and post-it notes. He’d first discovered Muggle office supplies in a fancy shop on a trip to Covent Garden with Pansy, and been slightly obsessed ever since.
, at least, Hermione.’ Draco unclasped his cloak, letting it float to the ground, and started to roll up his white shirtsleeves.
Cock-warming, office sex, established relationship, oral sex, D/s relationship, Dom Percy, Sub Pansy, Pansy x Percy, tribble
When Harry floats back to full consciousness, he’s still buried deep in Draco, Draco’s come drying on his stomach. Draco presses little kisses everywhere he can reach, all over Harry’s chest, his jawline, the tendons of his arms, caging Draco beneath him.
be safe. The wolf was just a little too unpredictable to trust around Draco. And besides, Harry didn’t want Draco seeing him in that form. Feral and mutated, hairy and scruffy.
‘Hmm,’ Draco hums as Harry reaches around to take hold of his half-hard cock, lazily working him up and down a few times. He arches his back, lifts his arm behind him so he can grab a handful of Harry’s hair and hold his mouth to his neck. ‘On second thoughts, maybe the tea can wait.’
Buff, and broad, and tall, Harry towered over everyone now, exuding a dangerous aura that Draco was drawn to like a billywig to a flame. Harry’s thighs were huge, muscled and thick, his stomach sculpted and his chest brown and bulging.
‘I know you do, Potter,’ Draco says, leaning forward in his chair again. His shirtsleeves are already rolled to his elbows, and Harry’s eyes dip against his will to drink in the sight of Draco’s pale, toned forearms, the silvery remnants of his Dark Mark strangely attractive against the marble of his skin. ‘But I made this batch myself. I guarantee it’s better than the supply you get from Mulpepper’s.’
All Harry had to do was get through this case, show Robards he was capable of keeping his cool, make sure Draco got the treatment he deserved at the DMLE, and then never interact with him and his hard body and his quick tongue and his delicious, tempting scent ever again.
Harry groaned again, his breath catching, the tell-tale sound pausing as he held himself still, the way he had to when he was too close to coming. Hermione bit her lip, opening one eye enough to squint at the time on the carriage clock on the bookshelf. She cursed under her breath when she realised Draco had only been gone fifteen minutes.
betray him, but he’d been looking into who had. Even after Harry accused him of being a traitor and disappeared for days on end, sending back his tear-stained letters, scorched and unanswered.
‘I doubt either of you prats could teach me anything,’ she replied haughtily. Theo laughed, low and sexy, as Draco’s eyes darkened. ‘We’ll be the best teachers you’ve ever had, Granger.’
‘Harry, Draco!’ Molly had enveloped them both in an enormous hug before they’d taken more than two steps out of the fireplace. Harry gave her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek and pulled free from her embrace, but Draco lingered for a few more moments.
Feeling horribly impatient, Harry waved a hurried hand over himself and Vanished everything he was wearing. He watched Draco’s face as he stood naked before him, his cock hard and heavy between his legs, leaking steadily. He was rewarded with the further darkening of Draco’s eyes, as they slowly raked down Harry’s body. His pink tongue poked out to lick his lips, the silver flash of the stud taunting Harry.
He might be a traitorous little shit, but Harry couldn’t help missing him. Draco’s scent, his presence, those tiny, fleeting touches, had all been keeping Harry grounded more than he realised. His wolf was miserable as well, and it felt like it was constantly berating Harry.
If she was good, then when he was finally finished his paperwork Percy would fuck her mouth, or maybe even bend her over his desk to take her.
- sitting with Pansy Parkinson, smiling as they spoke. His hair was as icy as always, artful styled, and Harry could see a plethora of silver earrings adorning his ear. A tight, black t-shirt stretched over his chest - Harry ached to run his fingers over the material, feeling he hardness of the body beneath - but it was Malfoy’s legs that Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from.
‘Fuck, Malfoy,’ Harry muttered weakly, and Draco reached forward with his other hand, his fingers curling around Hermione’s in Harry’s hair. ‘Draco,
‘So far,’ he replied, and he pulled Draco towards him. He stumbled in his heels, falling against Harry’s chest, and Harry reached around and grabbed his arse, the lace rubbing against his palms, and held him steady as he kissed him again. ‘You’re so fucking
Harry thinks back over all the Potions-related cases they’ve had in the past, where an in-house expert would have helped cut case completion times drastically. And then there’s the emergency Potions kits they hand out to field agents, and how they’re often depleted and under-stocked.
Barely fifteen minutes later, the door quietly opens and closes again as someone steps inside, and Draco knows, from the soft caress of familiar magic against his, that it’s
See Miracle number 1. Another case, another completion. With the chaotic sounds of the city below them, Auror robes flung unceremoniously around the room, Malfoy was finally naked, pale and scarred, in Harry’s arms. Harry came hard, the word
‘Enough to wait for me to get ready?’ Draco joked, and Harry growled under his breath and kissed him again, his mouth hot and hard.
‘Fuck, Harry,’ Draco moaned after several seconds of silent stillness. ‘If you don’t move soon, I swear to
Hermione sat up straighter at Draco’s words and the low, sultry tone of his voice. Even Harry dropped his magazine, green eyes sharpening.
When Draco walks out of the Floo, Harry is standing next to a haphazard blanket fort, running an awkward hand through his hair.
‘Thanks, mate,’ Harry says, as Ron nods his head and turns back to the cooking. Harry takes a sip of the rich, dark ale, and turns back to Hermione, clutching a glass of her favourite goblin-made red wine and watching him anxiously. ‘Well, it’s only been a day,’ he relents, finally answering her question. ‘But it’s going to be awful. I know he’s done well for himself, turned his life around, and he’s not a

Hermione reaches out to cover his hand with hers, and Harry takes a deep breath, making himself calm down. He forces a smile and looks up at her. ‘What’s for dinner, anyway? I’m starving!’
Harry didn’t hear the rest of Draco’s words, as he turned sharply on the spot and Disapparated in a cloud of thunder.
Later that afternoon, Harry makes his way down to the cafeteria. He needs something to eat - his appetite, already large, increases threefold in the days leading to the moon - and can’t stand to read through even one more case file. He catches the distant footfall of someone from behind him, and a quick sniff of the air tells him it’s Ron. He hides a smile and slows down for his best friend to catch up. When he does, Harry is surprised by Ron pressing into his side, slipping an arm around him.
- had betrayed him. Harry had allowed himself to get close to someone, someone other than a Weasley, and look where it had got him.
Draco hisses next to him, just loud enough for Harry to hear, and even as his wolf purrs happily, Harry resolutely ignores him, storming out of Robards’ office.
But otherwise, he didn’t feel irritable. Just like Malfoy had said, after drinking his version of the Wolfsbane potion. Harry frowned as Ron rubbed his cheek against him before pulling away, his blue eyes bright.
From her chair, Hermione looks up and sighs quietly. ‘Harry,’ she starts, in her calmest voice. ‘I know you don’t want to, but I really think we should talk about Mal—’
They weren’t late to the Burrow, in the end. Draco privately thought that it would be impossible to be late to the Burrow. Any time was the right time to turn up at the Weasley household. Draco followed Harry through the Floo, straight into the kitchen. As usual, it was warm and busy and filled with the rich, fragrant scent of Molly Weasley’s cooking.
‘You’re not so bad yourself, Potter,’ Draco said, a begrudging tone to his voice, as if he hadn’t been calling him
become an Auror a few years later than Harry and his friends, but Harry always assumed that was something to do with his bail, or the terms of his release from Azkaban. He’s never given it much thought, really. ‘I assumed you were busy with running the Manor, or something,’ he mumbles instead.
‘Hey.’ A firm, warm hand settles on his forearm, and Draco steps forward into Harry’s space, face to face. Harry hadn’t even realised he’d come to a stop, but sure enough they’re standing in the middle of Knockturn Alley, a handful of intrigued faces watching them from different doorways. ‘C’mon, Potter. It’s okay.’
Harry whirled to face Draco, who was ashen beneath his already-pale skin, his silver eyes heavy with worry. For a moment he looked like he was going to pull Harry into a comforting hold, then his eyes flickered up and met Harry’s furious gaze, and he faltered and took a guilty step backwards.
"Right," Blaise frowned, staring at Draco with something close to concern. Draco shifted, uncomfortable under his gaze before turning his face away. His movement seemed to snap Blaise out of his thoughts, and he blinked. "Right, well, I need to tell you something."
He sighed, willing that annoying little thought to go away. It was like spending time with Potter had forced him to develop a conscience.
"She can and she's going to," Draco answered. "The only reason she's holding off is because she wants to know if she can get him sent to Azkaban on some trumped-up charge of knowing where Dumbledore is."
“Like how you just letting Sirius die was wrong?” Lupin answered, his voice dangerous close to a snarl, and Draco could feel claws digging into his neck.
"There are different kinds of abuse, Draco," Blaise answered. And Draco hated how his voice had gone soft as if he was afraid Draco would suddenly break.
Harry had always been skinny but recently he'd moved from skinny to emaciated. And Draco hated that he'd let Harry get to this point. That he hadn't been paying more attention.
At the same time, it was horribly annoying to always be watched. It would have been nice to be able to touch Harry, to brush his fingers along Harry's while passing the coffee without Black staring at him as if Draco was about to Avada Kadavra the lot of them. To get away he spent his time exploring Grimmauld Palace. Most of the rooms were closed up, cobwebs clinging to the ceiling and dusty artefacts shoved in drawers. He found what must have been Sirius’ old room, the letters SB and a bunch of letters on the dressing table. A few doors down was a door labeled RAB and it took Draco exploring the family tree to figure out it was Sirius’ brother Regulus Black.
let him. He couldn't keep being afraid of him. He lifted his wand, feeling his hand tremble even as he did. He'd never cast a killing curse, never wanted to. The idea was almost funny given how much he hated people.
"I… yes," Slughorn nodded to himself again, not bothering to acknowledge Draco at all. "Yes, I suppose I
"Draco could be being tortured now and we're just going to waste precious time moseying around the castle as if his life isn't worth anything?" Harry asked, his voice rising to a shout with every word.
" he snarled, swinging his wand forward to make another cut. "How could this have HAPPENED?" Silence. Severus hoped that had been a rhetorical question. "WELL!" the Dark Lord turned, snarling at the mass of Death Eaters gathered around him. Apparently not.
He tried to stand, fell, and then managed it just in time to catch sight of the raven bobcat disappearing between the trees. He didn't bother to call out, he knew Harry was gone.
"Professor Umbridge?" Draco sprang up. Umbridge turned toward him in surprise, followed by every other eye in the room. And the confusion cleared from Harry’s face, replaced by a rueful twitch of his lips. "I had a question about the reading assignment you gave us and was wondering if you could help me?" She blinked once, twice, three times before she was able to recover herself.
“You know Ron and Harry had a falling out,” Ginny interrupted, her lips twisted with annoyance. Luna wondered if she should interrupt. If it was even her place to interrupt. It was hardly the first time Ginny and Dean had argued, but they didn’t mean she enjoyed hearing it. “You can’t trust what Ron’s saying right now.”
with the Weasel, Potter?” he said after the dorm door had closed behind them. He continued pulling them out of the Slytherin Commons. “I swear if you—"
Then he was standing in front of Ron, who was babbling about how Draco was using him. "You'll be better off without him!" Ron kept insisting.
"Draco is back from his change," Harry said, not even raising his head. There was something about his voice; it lacked the usual scorn, the usual dead tone of uncaring that Harry always maintained.
“They’re going to ask you a lot of questions,” Granger said, her eyes lighting up like he’d just given her a fascinating book or something. “And I’ve been studying. I thought I could help you prepare.”
it. He had gone without letting himself open to being hurt by others for so long, he felt open, exposed, venerable every time he thought someone was just a little too close.
Harry slept the rest of the morning though Draco didn't. Partly because he was afraid of what he would see in his dreams and partly because he couldn't bring himself to drag his eyes from Harry's blissfully peaceful face. He couldn't remember the last time he'd seen Harry look truly relaxed, much less
"Well," he said, letting out a strangled laugh. "I mean that now, we have to go talk our way out of this mess with Umbridge."
"No,” Harry answered, his eyes wide and surprised as if he hadn’t even considered the idea. Of course not. “That’s not what I—"
“Draco had a nightmare,” Harry said. “Knight to A6.” Severus raised his eyebrows, his gaze flicking down again, though whether it was at Harry’s move or the information he’d been given, Harry had no idea.
The door slammed behind him angrily. Harry blinked, battling between his confusion and his desire to chase after Draco. Even if he did find him, he had no idea what he would say. Somehow thank you just didn’t seem appropriate.
"Draco!" Harry protested, leaning around Draco's shoulder and frowning as if he didn't understand what all the fuss was about.
"Potter," Severus said,his voice containing that ordering tone that Harry didn't know why he bothered with. It wasn't like Harry particularly cared to listen to him if he didn't want to. "Stay with Draco," Harry sighed heavily, letting it be known how much he was being put upon, but nodded and Severus let go of the back of shirt. He followed Senior Malfoy out of the infirmary, closing the door behind them. Harry plopped himself down on a bed, reaching across to snatch a grape from one of the plates he'd brought.
"Oh, yes!" Dobby nodded his head vigorously. "Draco Malfoy was always kind to Dobby, unlike…" His eyes widened, and he looked around as if searched for something to punish himself with.
"But, sir, you see, she's an old family friend," Zabini answered, his smile instantly turning into a pout. "I'd really like to check up on her," the wizard blinked at him again before turning to Harry and Luna.
"What truth?" Harry tensed. It was a warning. A warning Draco should have known to acknowledge by now, but he could feel Harry slipping out of his reach, and he was grasping with everything he had.
He heard a gasp, but he didn't have time. He was already on his feet, reaching for his wand as Werewolf Draco turned toward him suddenly, clashing his fangs together and snarling. Harry felt pain ripple through him as the scratch rubbed against his clothes, and he knew he was bleeding, could feel the hot liquid running down his leg, but he didn't have
They spent a long time in Honeydukes', Weasley and Harry looking at a bunch of different things while running around like children. Granger was calmer and more selective but seemed just as eager, stuffing things into her bag. It was intoxicating, the atmosphere of relaxation and fun. It was almost of if Draco could put down the weight he had been told to carry and act a child again. If only for a day.
So, Dumbledore had him in his office, trying desperately to get him to care about whatever nonsense he was talking about now while Harry twirled his wand between his fingers. He had one leg swung over the arm of Dumbledore's chair, swinging back and forth while the other was planted solidly on the ground to keep him from falling over.
to Draco again, he would feel better. He'd probably tell Harry how stupid he was being and say some other cynical comment and that would be that.
"The landlady," Malfoy huffed, and then he seemed to really look at Harry, his lips twisting into satisfied smirk. His hips shifted, one hand falling to his waist as he almost posed. "Unless, of course, you had something else in mind," he said, his voice soft and silky in the air between them, his chin turned to the side, grey eyes soft and amused as he stared back at Harry. And Malfoy's blatant mockery of Harry's attraction to him shouldn't have been attractive.
"Draco," Lupin's voice sounded. It was quiet, reserved and yet it still sent a chill down Draco's spine that made him want to growl and pounce on the older werewolf. "The wolfsbane potion is the safest option."
"Yes," Draco muttered. "You must continue acting even if it means letting someone else die for your war. I never used to think Dumbledore believed that, but well…."
Then Hagrid had returned the next day. Draco had been right, he'd been sent on a mission to try and get the giants to help the Order defeat Voldemort, but Harry wasn't quite ready to tell his friends that he already known where Hagrid had gone. He did, however, want to talk to Draco about everything he had learned. He also wanted to ask him why he'd been avoiding him. And he just wanted to see him—even if he wasn't allowed to touch him.
6:00 o'clock, right?" Malfoy stared at him, an eyebrow rising with a mixture of annoyance and amusement.
"Tell me again what happened?" Shacklebolt ordered, and Harry sighed as Dracona started her explanation. He still felt confused and fuzzy headed, not completely sure himself what had happened. He hadn't
"Dumbledore told me that I was one of the Horcruxes. Since Voldemort's curse backfired, I had a part of his soul buried in me. It let me sense the Horcruxes, look into Voldemort's mind, and he even sometimes invaded my dreams. Dumbledore said that I would have to die for Voldemort to die, that I would have to die by Voldemort's hand," Harry answered, and several things clicked together in Draco's mind.
Harry batted his hand out of the way, pulling his wand free and casting a neatening charm on him. ‘There you go,’ Harry announced, leaning forward to kiss Draco on the cheek. ‘Good as new.’
The first week with Malfoy drags on in much the same vein. They sit next to each other, working on their boring, routine case loads, alternating between resolutely ignoring each other, or winding each other up until one of them storms off for a tea break. Every afternoon, Robards’ sends them on patrol duty in the Alleys, where they stride along side by side, ignoring the flash of cameras from the Daily Prophet and the wide, staring eyes of the wizarding folk out for the day.
, ya know,’ he continues, crouching on the floor in front of Draco. ‘We just wanted to ruin Potter’s life, give him what he deserves, but to be handed a Death Eater who betrayed his brothers and sisters in wands? Who slaves away for the very people we were sworn against? Your death will be slow, I’m afraid - but we’ll have some fun together first, mark my words.’
Hermione gulped and nodded, even as a spark of excitement flared to life in her stomach. Draco helped her stand up, and she saw the damp patch on his trousers from her betrayal, making her cheeks flush even warmer than before. He closed his legs and patted the tops of his thighs, and Hermione carefully lowered herself over him, her eyes facing the ground and her bum in the air. Draco stroked it, lovingly, before saying ‘count to ten for me, Granger,’ and letting his palm connect with her bum with a loud slap in the quiet of the room. She gasped and counted, just as he commanded, until her skin was tender and warm, and she was aching and desperate once again. After the tenth slap, Draco gently pushed her thighs apart and slid two fingers inside her, as she clenched around him and bit her lip to stop from begging.
He ran his hand along her thigh, the silk of her stockings meeting the silk of her skin. They were fully clothed, a hasty
It happened in the middle of the night, whenever he’d managed to come up with a reason to share a bed with Draco - a surprisingly easy feat, most of the time. Blaise would wait, hours sometimes, until the whole world was silent and dark and Draco’s breathing deepened.
‘Cuppa and a slice of cake?’ he asks hopefully, and Harry smiles and nods. He put Malfoy, and the question of
‘Draco,’ Harry hisses, aghast, and Draco looks up and freezes, caught in the act of passing Blaise a copy of Vogue. ‘Mask night is
‘What have you done to my mate?’ Harry growls, slowly advancing. He clenches his fist tighter, runs a tongue over the point of a fang.
with Harry, wasn’t a good enough reason to risk Harry’s friendships and sanity and very place in life.
As soon as they stepped, side by side, out of the safety of the Ministry and into the light of Diagon Alley, they were beset on all sides by photographers and journalists. A flash of a camera momentarily blinded Harry, and a reporter he recognised - not at all fondly - from the
Harry can’t help it. He leans forward, silences Draco’s stuttering with a long, lingering kiss, before licking the taste of Draco off his lips.
It takes but three words for you to drop to your knees, helpless and pliant, before him. He smiles, a benevolent god, gazing at you with hot silver eyes, white-blond hair artfully tousled from your earlier caresses. He lets one long, elegant finger trail over your chest.
Harry was in a dark, dangerous mood. The full moon was the next week, and its pull was already almost too tempting to ignore. Harry’s wolf growled and simmered just below the surface, and from the way the Ministry workers in the Atrium yelped and scurried out of his way as he strode through the marble hall, Harry wasn’t hiding it well.
He stepped up to them, kneeled on the floor, stroked a hand over each of their heads. ‘You’re both so perfect. So good for me. My perfect little Gryffindors.’ Hermione preened under his words, and Harry stirred feebly beneath his touch. Draco gently grasped both of them by the forearm. ‘Ready?’ he asked gently, and when they both nodded, he Apparated all three of them to their enormous bed, where Hermione knew they’d spend the next few hours, while he cleaned and comforted and cuddled them back to reality.
Hermione settled back against a reading desk, smoothing her grey skirt where it fell mid-thigh, and opened the book in front of her. Draco’s voice replied, a little closer, and she heard their footsteps approach.
Harry grunts again. ‘I… the moon is so close,’ he whimpers, slowly dragging himself back. ‘I… I want… I want to
Harry looks from Ron to Robards, his panic and anger rising. ‘What do you mean?’ he asks, his voice dangerously low.
Harry sighed and squirmed and panted, sweat glistening on his forehead, his muscles trembling. Hermione could see how close he was, in the tight lines of his body, the tension in his jaw, the bite of his fingers in her soft flesh. He groaned and gasped, his heavy eyes flying open.
They face one another, and Draco carefully holds one hand out, palm up, in invitation. Wolf-Harry reaches forward, his whiskers tickling Draco’s hand as he gives him a cautious sniff. The next moment, he jumps up, his paws landing on Draco’s shoulders as he gives a happy
Draco hated that his once-enemy was now his mate. He hated how possessive he was, how every time he dragged Potter to his bed he left him littered with bites and bruises, covered in sweat and come.
‘You were hurt,’ he repeats, his nose trailing along Draco’s cheek. Draco whimpers a little, his fingers gripping Harry’s top. ‘I will do
And probably, it’s only Robards who realises Potter is the first partner on the force Draco’s ever had.
Draco caught sight of Harry over Charlie’s shoulder now, his green eyes soft and fond, as they embraced. The Weasleys, all of them, were Harry’s family - even Percy. He knew it meant the world to Harry that Draco was accepted into their world. Charlie released Draco a moment later, flinging his arms around Harry next.
‘I don’t want to talk about him, Hermione,’ Harry snaps back before she can finish. She looks pained, and Crookshanks wakes from his nap, glaring at Harry through one opened golden eye and swishing his tail warningly. Harry groans, and runs his hands through his hair. ‘I’m sorry,’ he mutters, and Crookshanks closes his eye and settles again. ‘I don’t mean to snap at you, it’s just…’ he pauses then, unsure how to carry on. Just what, exactly?
It’s later that day, hours after Potter leaves, when Draco is walking across the quiet Atrium to the fireplaces that he realises the full moon is in two weeks’ time. Potter mentioned, at the pub, about the Wolfsbane Potion making his irritability worse. And considering how irritable he was now, before taking it, Draco didn’t know if he wanted to stick around for the week after next.
And they genuflected without fail: one locked away in the dark, one watching and waiting for the light.
Harry kept his eyes on him the entire time: as he felt the cold rub of metal against his hole, as the head of Draco’s cock breached him, as the length and girth of him slid slowly inside. Draco didn’t blink, his silver eyes dark and hungry, his hands clenched on Harry’s thighs as if he was trying to stop himself from grabbing hold of him. When Harry was completely impaled on Draco, he took a deep breath, adjusting to the delicious stretch of him.
"I…" Draco blinked once and then nodded, snapping his fingers loudly. "Of course." The elf that escorted them in suddenly appeared at Draco's shoulder.
"I don't know," she shrugged, shaking her head at him. "I just know that he heard you were on the case and asked to be assigned to it."
to be assigned to his case. About how he had wanted to work with Harry. "Why did you ask to be assigned to my case?" he asked, the question just kind of falling out of his mouth, and Malfoy's grey eyes widened in shock.
“When he found out what was happening, he did everything he could to take me away from them,” Harry answered.
," Lucius answered, and Severus flinched back, his face a mask of cold shock. And Lucius was forced to acknowledge just how right Harry had been. Severus really did think he meant nothing to Lucius. "I don't know how you've gotten the idea that you don't matter to me, but-."
"It can't be true," Draco said. Harry turned to him. Draco's face had gone deathly pale, his breathing unsteady and Harry was beginning to be really concerned about him. "Trelawney is a fraud. Everyone knows that!" Draco stood abruptly, wobbling where he was and shouting at Dumbledore. "It's not true!"
Severus had understood though. He sat on the end of his bed and watched him cry. Not because he was sad or upset but because he was angry. For the first time in his life, he was really and truly angry. For the first time in his life, he felt like he understood Voldemort. He would burn the world down if he had the chance. He would burn the world down and leave everyone who had every hurt him to die. He would watch their ashes smolder and then walk away, never giving them the curtesy to think of them ever again, because they didn't deserve it.
But Harry was still hard against his stomach, and he couldn’t just leave without bringing him off. Draco lowered his hands along Harry's sides, gripping Harry's hard cock in his hand. Harry immediately arched at his touch, rutting against the feeling. Draco ducked his head, lowering it down and wrapping his lips around Harry’s head. He was trembling, his fingers still tight against Draco’s scalp and that
Severus stopped by the house later that day. Everyone but Sirius Black was at the hospital cooing over Mr. Weasley and Draco figured he had timed his visit on purpose. He was sitting in the library, reading one of the new potion books that Harry had given him when Severus came in, his mouth tight in that way that Draco
"Just know I'm here when you do need the help," he called, and Draco had to shove the urge to turn around and lunge down.
"It's a portkey," Draco said, holding it out for Harry to take hold of. "Grab hold." Harry hesitated before reaching out and wrapping his fingers around the little golden hand watch in Draco's hand. Neville clutched Hermione tighter to him before reaching out to grab hold of the object in Draco's hand too. Almost immediately, he felt the familiar tugging sensation below his navel as they were launched through space.
Draco gave him an odd look but followed him over to the Slytherin table anyway. Blaise sat for a long time before raising his head to meet the two pairs of eyes focused on him from across the hall. He stared back at Granger and Weasley for a minute before turning his head away and engaging Draco in a conversation about their next class.
