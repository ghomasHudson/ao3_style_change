Qye blinked when he felt Granger lay her own hand on his arm and he looked curiously at her. He blinked when Weasley hissed quietly next to him, voice confused and slightly frightened, “Harry, what in Merlin’s name are you doing?”
“I believe we should agree with Healer Smethwyck’s plan for now,” the older wizard said and Qye leaned away from him, warily eyeing him staring down at the group of adults.  He narrowed his eyes when ancient blue eyes turned to him and glared as he felt Harry stiffen next to him.  Those eyes shifted down to Harry and he saw how they grew more thoughtful.  “I will write a letter to the Minister, Jonas.  Naturally, due to the circumstances, he will have to come here for the update.”
Ron narrowed his eyes and stiffened his aching body, raising his wand.  “Screw you, Malfoy.  I’m saying we take as many down as we can before they get there.”
“Maybe the duels helped them grow up a little, Harry,” she had snapped when he finally asked one too many times as she tried to study.  “Maybe they see that tearing each other apart is pointless and actually damaging when there are bigger and more dangerous things out there.  Now could you please go do something actually productive, like going through the study schedule I set up for you?”
“Listen, why don’t we get out of here?” Harry said quickly, turning around so they couldn’t see his face.  He had been preparing two weeks for when everyone came back but he still wasn’t sure if he was controlling his face properly.  “I’ve been waiting for you two for about half an hour and I’m freezing.  Why don’t we go to the Tower?”
“A dark spell, Poppy,” Dumbledore said grimly, from where he stood next to a pale McGonagall, recently returned from securing that the rest of the students who were injured in the attack so that they were unable to intrude in the private room they had set up.
He wasn’t conscious of rolling over, breathing heavily as he stumbled in the blankets that lay atop him, tangled in his legs as he fell out of the bed, knees banging on the carpet, arm outstretched, his hand reaching and –
Silently groaning with agony, he forced the primitive feelings rising in him away.  Taking a deep breath to calm – and cool – himself, he looked at him, unable to hide the gentle look in his dark blue eyes.
:: Qye said calmly.  But he could feel a bit of shock from the other boy.  Before he could say anything, the portrait of a bowl of fruit came into sight and he had to abandon thinking with Qye.
“Severus said it was correct,” she said, shrugging slightly.  “You must just be allergic to it.  Perhaps you’re incompatible with one of the ingredients in the potion and that was what caused you to have your reaction.  It is not uncommon.”
putting in the shredded leaves of ivy!  Put it before and your entire potion will blow up, probably taking your hand along with it!  Were you even reading the instructions?!"
Harry ignored Qye and fought the retuning blush.  He was lucky no one figured out what had happened and only Ron and Hermione knew.
“You should perhaps send them a letter, reassuring them that you’re fine now,” Dumbledore said, standing up abruptly and leaving Qye blinking. “That is,” the elderly man continued, a small smile replacing his frown and the twinkle his searching look, “when Madame Pomfrey decides to release you.” He chuckled softly at Qye’s sour look as he began to walk out of the room. He paused in the doorway and said airily, “Enjoy your stay.” And then he left.
Did he remember waking up three days ago? Three days ago? That was interpreted as a negative. Did he remember sneaking out of the Infirmary? No, what was he, insane? Did he remember coming back to Great Hall and falling into a screaming fit where he then passed out unconscious? He remembered that but apparently it was a different fit that happened four days ago and under different circumstances.
“What the hell - ” Jacob began angrily but Jordan interrupted before his twin caused any more damage.
Harry thought, rolling his eyes.  He let out an exasperated sigh and gave the blond a warning look.  “Fine.  Yes.”
He stopped as he caught sight of an exit, leading to the grounds of Hogwarts. He pondered for a moment, then, without hesitation, walked outside.
“I…I’ve just been tired lately,” the other boy mumbled.  “With school and stuff.  I just need a bit more sleep, that’s all.”  Ron shook his head wearily, feeling the hurt rise a bit more.  That wasn’t all.  There was more and Harry wasn’t telling.
Draco was silent for a moment.  “My father…with the Dark Lord’s rise came back the thought of entertaining relations with vampires.  Nothing my mother said would dissuade him.  She made me go to the Venators almost as soon as I got back home, tried to keep me away.  And I wasn’t even really thinking about it while I trained with them.  It was just my mother being overprotective as usual, I thought.  Yes, the vampires were annoying but they hardly mattered.  They were never going to be a part of our world.  Surely the Dark Lord, with his value on blood purity, would never enter into such a deal.”
“Now, that’s not nice,” he whined even though his blue eyes danced with laughter.  “I was just inquiring over a friend’s well-being.  Is that a crime nowadays?”
It encompassed him, floating him along ever so gently, like a feather on the wind.  He felt weightless, moving through the shadows.  Darkness encompassed all around him.  Shadow…silence…
:: Qye asked as Harry stood leaning against a wall in the Entrance Hall on the last day of holidays.
Ron’s eyes widened in horror and he blasted a fire spell, blocked by one of the other vampires as the woman darted for his friend.  Seamus and Dean’s spells were likewise blocked by the vampires charging forward, Malfoy’s sunlight shield was intercepted by a beast and the woman raised her blade above Neville, petrified and staring, pale and wide eyed.
Sirius drank the rest of his Firewhiskey and returned to the plans.  He went through all this, the hiding, the cold, for a godson he barely saw but loved more than his own life.  He jotted another possible location for a Death Eater gathering and hoped James and Lily understood he did it all so he could one day be with Harry.
“What are you talking about?” he asked, looking warily up at the Slytherin.  “And what are you doing?”
“I agree with the wizarding team, Pater,” Nilsson said, her voice as still as her expression, and Libby saw Lest reel back, the blood draining from his pale face.  “I have had limited contact due to their requests but from what I have observed, they act and think independent of one another.  Healer Smethwyck has shared all their biological data, to which I have also found no method to merge them with our current resources.  Nor do I believe we would be successful in any endeavor with the conviction I have sensed in both of them.”  She paused and then said something in a different language, a hint of sympathy slipping into her voice if not her face.
“What - ” he heard Sirius start to say and Qye clenched his jaw as Harry looked at him from the corner his eye, his gaze seeing through Qye’s discomfort.
Lest wasn’t looking at him. Lest was looking at a fifteen year old wizarding boy, staring at him with a strange look on his face. Lest didn’t see him…didn’t see his young best friend…didn’t see…
Harry shook his head and turned the page, skipping over the section entitled ‘Substitute Nutrients in Place of Plasma’.
“What the - ” said one of the vampires and then there were shouts as they were all pushed back, an unseen force knocking them to their backs.
Malfoy growled, grabbed the carefully shredded mint leaves lying right in front of Harry and jerkily shoved them towards the shorter boy. Harry meekly took them and sprinkled them into his potion, which immediately turned a blood red. Glancing up at Malfoy, he saw the Slytherin still scowling at him.
His comment broke the heavy silence that gathered in the Three Broomsticks as Harry and Malfoy entered.
“I just don’t see the point of it, I’m not planning on being a bloody Healer,” said Ron in annoyance.  Hermione glared at him.
There was a cry and he whipped his head around to see Sprout stumble back, wincing as she clutched her bleeding wand arm.
"Are you mad?" the Slytherin boy snapped, glaring at him while holding his wrist tightly.  "You put the root
She rolled her eyes and shook her head.  “I’ll probably cast a few more counters after we finish eating,” she grumbled.  “Maybe dunk him in the Black Lake if he doesn’t come clean.”  She headed over to the Gryffindor table, still muttering under her breath about jinxes and personality switches.  Harry merely smiled faintly as he left the Great Hall, ducking past a pair of curious Ravenclaws.
“How do you have any right?” Sirius whispered, voice shaking in fury once again, ignoring his sister and the Healer and Dumbledore and fixing his unforgiving gaze on Lest once more.  “He was ten, how do you have any right to him?  There’s no way you have any claim.”
“Lest,” Professor Opacre said exasperatedly. “Harry has just recovered from being sick so stop baiting him. And besides, he’s already apologized for that.”
“Fine,” he choked out, turning another laugh into a cough.  “Must be catching something.”  Having dealt with Qye for the past two weeks had turned his definition of ‘language’ into something a bit vulgar.  He idly wondered what Hermione would think of Qye’s language.
"That's right, how well we resonate." Seeing their still confused faces, she continued. "Here, to give you a little more background, let me explain how our jewels are given to us.
A look of surprise on the vampire's face before he crashed down to the floor and he heard Professor Opacre's yelp clearly as the rest of the class fell silent, stunned.
“Don’t doubt that,” Harry muttered as he hitched his schoolbag higher on his shoulder. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think she'd want to keep me locked in the Infirmary for the rest of my life.”
“Original, Weasel,” Draco had finally responded, a vaguely irritated tone in his voice.  He frowned at the redhead and then back to Harry, who was staring at the pair in stunned silence.  A loud thumping had announced the arrival of Hagrid and the Slytherin had nodded to Harry and calmly rejoined his Housemates, leaving Harry lost in the political undercurrent that had shifted between the two normally antagonistic Houses and families.
“The Ministry is investigating the matter,” Dumbledore’s gentle voice said quietly near him.  Harry opened his eyes and looked up, blinking.  The Headmaster had moved from his chair without him noticing and Harry looked confusedly up at the somber figure.
Qye snapped.  Harry ground his teeth as he roughly put away the journal and fell back down on his bed.  Qye sighed and continued in a contrite tone of voice,
“No reason for that, I’m fine,” Qye shrugged, shoving his hands in his pockets. “She just likes keeping me prisoner, that m - ” He stopped, took a deep breath to stop from saying miserable, old hag, and continued. “That mad woman.”
His mouth opened and closed repeatedly as he stared dumbstruck at the other boy, unable to form any kind of response.  His stupor was broken by a low laugh from behind him.  Still stunned, Harry turned around to find the Slytherin smirking at him, his pale eyes shining with amusement as a few strands of white-blond hair fell into his face.  The black-haired boy felt heat slowly begin to creep up onto his face.
He had been so preoccupied with his friends that he hadn’t noticed the actions of the other students and now that he had, he wished he had kept his attention on his best friends.  Watching some of his own housemates avoiding his eyes and sitting away from him stung and seeing the students at the other houses looking at him, whispering and pointing, only aggravated him.  They clearly didn’t like being around him or didn’t trust him.
he wondered briefly – and let out a quick huff before he stepped into the corridor, carefully bracing a hand against the wall, his strength ebbing from his sudden adrenaline spike.  It was dark in the hallway, no windows in sight but he saw light further down.
“Stay away from him, Harry,” Malfoy said softly, tightening his hold slightly, his gray eyes looking into his own wide-eyed green ones.  “I told you I can’t always be there when trouble comes along and Opacre’s brother is trouble, more than you can possibly know.  Trust me on this, I know more about him than you do.  I want you to stay away from him because…because I don’t want him to hurt you.”
“Cover for me, will you?” Malfoy asked Harry, glancing at him as he got up from his seat to help a desperate Pansy.  Harry shrugged, turning back to their potions.  He heard Malfoy mutter under his breath as he crept towards Pansy, who had been moved three tables behind them.
“As I said, my first responsibility is to the well-being of my patients,” the wizard said calmly, steel behind every word.
Harry felt Qye retreat from behind his eyes and as he watched Pomfrey’s wand tip turn dark green, he felt the other boy rummaging around his memories.  As Pomfrey ended the spell, Harry amusedly felt Qye stop “reading” his memory of the strong and strict nurse.
The first meetings had been tense, filled with insults and hardly getting any work done.  However, once they saw their grades begin to fall because of their bickering, they quickly made a grudging truce between themselves to not argue while working on the duo assignments.  Now, two months of homework meetings, they found themselves in an odd sort of routine.  Once they met up, they quickly split up the work and silently worked by themselves, only talking when they asked one another for help.  After finishing the work, they quickly and silently departed after sharing the results.  Sometimes, one would finish before the other and they would have to wait until the other boy finished his work.  Harry usually spent this time working on other assignments but he hadn’t thought the other boy would return the polite gesture.
Marylin moved closer and contemptuously said, “You must be such fools to think you can win over all of us, especially you, Dazain.”  He felt his sister’s own anger at the sight of the vampire in front of them.  Despite his unassuming stance, they both knew this particular monster well.  “Why come with such bad odds?”
He heard Hermione yell and briefly saw her brandish her wand at another beast, stumbling back as it swiped at her, before the beast atop him snapped at his face, blocked by his forearm.
Professor Opacre turned around and smiled brightly at him, holding a small spray bottle.  “Here, almost done,” she said cheerfully, as she walked back.  She spritzed his hair, brow furrowed as her fingers lightly set his hair.  “I really need to thank you, Harry,” she said abruptly, eyes completely on his hair.  “I…I had almost forgotten what it meant to do this.”
.’  Oddly, the name sparked nothing in her while just picturing the boy’s face made her mind flash with something.  She mentally sighed and shook the thoughts away.  ‘
Behind the Death Eaters, from where he had been sending his curses and been rebuffed by Dumbledore, she saw Voldemort tremble with fury.  In a moment where Dumbledore was distracted, freezing another vampire dashing near Harry, she saw Voldemort shift his wand.
“Nothing, 'Mione,” he replied automatically. Marylin smothered her smile and saw Lest look sympathetically at the boy for a moment before his face returned to its usual detached expression. Marylin sighed and turned back to the teenagers.
His eyes narrowed and he stormed towards the doors leading to the corridors.  “Get the students out of the way.”
Lest slammed the beast away from the students, tossing his hand to the side and knocking it unconscious against the wall.  Another pair of beasts tore through the doors, one catching a red blast of light against its chest from Professor Flitwick while another’s legs turned to stone from Professor McGonagall.  He threw himself over the table, feet dashing across the floor as he knocked down another beast, crushing its mind until it crumpled to the floor in front of one of now empty tables, frothing at the mouth.
At this, Harry felt the objection falter in his classmates, pushed aside by their indignation. More than one pair of eyes shot a heated glare to the male vampire and not all of them were Slytherin. Beside him, Ron muttered under his breath, "Bastard. Bet he wouldn't say that if he knew half the things we've been up against." Hermione shushed him while Harry aimed a subtle kick at the redhead's foot.
Malfoy didn’t say anything though.  He didn’t even appear to notice that Harry was there.  His pale eyes were locked on the horse.  Harry looked at him a bit closer and blinked.  There was pain in his gray eyes.  Pain, anger, hatred, bitterness…all of it was in his eyes.
he asked, worried and reaching for that place in his head where Qye resided, feeling his hurt and turmoil.  He felt the flash of rage in the midst of it and stilled.
Harry felt the tightening in his shoulders ease slightly but the others looked much how he still felt, with slight hints of unease and suspicion.
He stepped aside as the fireplace turned green again, barely avoiding Sirius as he stumbled through, reaching out and gripping onto Remus’ arms hard enough to bruise.
Jonas started by reassuring them.  He hesitated, wondering whether to share the most recent development on their magic before deciding to focus on the more important news first.
Harry gave her a sidelong look.  “Please tell me you didn’t spend the entire time last night asking him about that?” he asked worriedly, a tug of guilt in him at the thought that he might’ve ruined his best friends’ chance at beginning their relationship.
He dragged off his Invisibility Cloak and carelessly dropped it on the floor as he fumbled to the nearest sink.
an answer had stepped forward and thrown whatever they could at the waves of beasts.  Ron had seen the twins and Lee Jordan take another corridor with their pranking materials, Ginny helping Hermione with stunners on beasts and Hagrid with the 7
This one was far more outlandish than any other recommendation she had ever made.  She had no illusion that if the world were to ever see it, she would never provide services ever again.  Her previous patients would most-likely seek a second opinion for every other recommendation she had made before.
"Well, the first spells she did were aimed for the mind, did you notice?" she asked and a few murmurs ran through the crowd.
Harry was silent, gazing at the now weary Ron and still tear-bright Hermione. Then he sighed and brought up his knees, wrapping his arms around them.
“It’s not my fault these students of yours are so easily frightened,” the Opacre male said disdainfully. “Maybe you should teach them to have a little backbone.”
Finally, as he was about to ask why he had been brought up, Dumbledore said quietly, “There’s been an attack.”
It came from the filing cabinet next to her desk and her frown deepened as she slowly made her way over, trying to think of what could possibly –
Ron's head whirled around but Harry didn't even wait for Professor Opacre's acknowledgement, beginning to push his way through the crowd. The redhead still somehow managed to catch the sleeve of his room and he glanced back at the irate redhead.
"Ah, but he's got his ever-loving immortal to keep him going, don't you know?" Seamus interrupted, smirking from his place at the table. Harry could feel the scorching heat of Hermione's glare to his right and a few other Gryffindors added their own (low-volume) catcalls. His face reddened and he didn't know whether to ignore it or deny it fervently, sure either one would prolong his embarrassment.
Harry dropped his eyes, staring at the floor, and Qye looked away from him, swallowing disappointment.
:: Qye replied absently, indicating that he was already deeply immersed in “reading” one of his memories.  ::
“Yeah, lucky,” Harry said quietly, staring at the floor and feeling his temper begin to rise slightly.  After he explained that to the class, Hagrid had immediately begun to break them into groups for the quarter project.  Ron and Hermione fortunately got to be in the same group that was to study the white winged horse they had first touched.  Harry wasn’t so fortunate.
He shrugged, the smile fading from his face.  “I don’t know her,” he said quietly.  “So I don’t know whether or not I should trust her.  I would rather get an impression of her without her disliking me.  If she dislikes me, she’ll most likely do things that won’t make me like her and that won’t help me to see if she’s trustworthy or not.  ”
Harry grinned back, hitching his bag further up his shoulder as they walked down into the dungeons.  "And to get away from both of you bickering," he added cheerfully as they took the stairs down into the freezing dungeons.  Ron rolled his eyes but Hermione sniffed.
“You know,” Malfoy said in as low a voice as he could manage in the crowded area, “it’s more than likely that Opacre was the one who helped him.”
Ron, glaring down at his History of Magic notes which had more doodles than anything, said distractedly, “What else is new?”
“Bloody hell, Potter,” Malfoy breathed. “You’re burning up.” Harry shivered as Malfoy rubbed his thumb gently against Harry’s forehead. He opened his eyes halfway to see the irritation in the silver-grey eyes that had been there since Lest’s arrival gone, replaced with the blond’s calm, aloof expression. Behind that, he thought he saw a hint a concern in those stormy eyes.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry stiffened and he glanced over to see Harry eyeing him back.  He tilted his head, puzzled by the unreadable look in his eyes.
– who had just ruined his plan of action, Qye adopted an outward face of calmness as he slowly sat up, propping himself up against the pillows. ‘
’  And he couldn’t help but feel a bit guilty as well.  Hadn’t he hoped for something cruel and hadn’t his wish been granted?  He began to believe that it was his fault that the Massacre happened.  His dreams now included the children and old woman screaming as the building tumbled down on them but instead of a Death Eater holding the wand, it was him and he was laughing.  He woke from these dreams sobbing and in a cold sweat.
“What dream?” Ron asked, raising an eyebrow at the gleeful sandy-haired boy.  Seamus snickered and the redhead turned a bemused look to a flushed Harry.  “What dream, Harry?” Ron repeated, his eyebrow rising higher.
Lest looked at him, face blank and revealing nothing. Harry sweated for a moment when he didn’t take the sweet. ‘
Raising his voice slightly, enough to be heard by the two, he said to Granger, “Of course, maybe that
numbers – were being offered from around the classroom.  Her eye twitched and she raised a hand to silence the class.  The class went quiet and she closed her eyes taking a deep breath.
Madam Pomfrey brushed back the hair on one.  She moved to the other and did the same, frowning and murmuring another spell whose light flickered between green and red and everything in between.
Harry carefully began to ladle it into a vial.  In his bag, he had the container with iron ore embedded throughout which the potion mentioned as the strongest possible.  Instead of a specific memory, as the potion had been designed, he would be focusing on Qye as a whole and he didn’t want to take any more chances than necessary.
“I still don’t know what’s made him different,” he said.  He shrugged and twisted the bracelet again.  “Hell, I don’t even know if maybe he’s just playing a long game or whatever this is.  It’s pretty strange and…I don’t know.”
It impacted against nothing ten feet in front of the students and fell to the floor, out cold from the force of Marylin’s shield.
“I am not badgering!” Hermione huffed, straightening up.  “I am merely concerned with how Harry’s doing and just because you’re insensitive doesn’t mean I have to be!”
There were no more of those soft sounds, the held back murmurs of ache.  The other boy had said nothing the entire way back and Harry hadn’t pushed, mind troubled with the events of tonight.  The cautious beginning, the information, the unexpected kisses and fights.
The words came again, louder and sharper this time.  He could hear the anger and fear in the voice, so commanding and harsh.  He stirred again, trying to resist the pull.  Were those his thoughts?  He thought they might be.
The trio stopped and turned around.  Marylin mentally raised an eyebrow at that.  The redhead and brunette were on either side of the green-eyed boy and they were standing almost…protectively.  She made a careful note of that as the three looked at her.  Harry glanced at his friends before stepping forward and saying quietly, “Yes, Professor?”
Lest arched an eyebrow, making no move to get closer to his sister or the objects in the room.  Then he did a double take and incredulously said, “Wait…he
"You have to know, however," Harry cleared his throat, torn between being annoyed and amused with Qye, "that they're not really my type." He picked up his fork and started in on his fully-served plate - courtesy of Hermione - while giving a quick meaningful look around.
He embraced his Videte again and knew she was shielding the few stray students stuck in the corridor in the presence of the pack of
Several heartbeats passed as they stood in the hallway and then where there once was a dog stood a man with tousled black hair, sharply looking between Snape and the vampire woman who had dropped her eyes to the floor.
“That’s kind of hard to do considering our current situation,” Draco said coolly, following Harry and leaning against the table.  “And I thought I was Draco now,” he said, raising an eyebrow and smirking.
His smile faded as they left Infirmary and he once again closed his eyes, easing himself down on the pillows and opening his eyes to stare at the ceiling.
Draco’s jaw clenched again.  “My…father sees power.  To him, the vampires are just a little above those without magic because of the talents they possess.  Talents that no wizard has ever gained.  Again, you have to remember that there’s been an unspoken agreement between us and them to stay apart.  Hardly anyone has ever actually had contact with them, outside of those with Venators inside the family.  And even then, remember the association has to remain outside of the law, or at least enough that the vampires in power can pretend that no official declaration of war has been made.”  Draco caught sight of Harry’s overwhelmed expression and gave him a crooked smile.  “I told you it was a long story.”
That was also interpreted as no.) Did he remember falling on top of Lest and arguing with him on the way back to the castle? Merlin, no and he was
“Sealing me away is protecting me?!” he yelled and he felt his heart twist as he saw Lest’s eyes widen in shocked horror.  “Taking everything that was me and just fucking pushing it down and out of sight, was that you protecting me?!”
Jordan bristled slightly along with his twin, glowering at the older man next to him as he gave out the status report of the Dazains.  He shared an annoyed look with his twin.  ‘
The vampire woman opened her mouth, closed it, sighed and hung her head.  “Them,” she repeated morosely, her blue eyes looking forwards apprehensively.  Remus was suddenly struck by how young she looked.
Harry had glared at the bemused looking blonde.  “Are you blackmailing him?” he had asked suspiciously.
Glancing behind him, Harry saw Professor Opacre standing next to her brother, who suddenly looked detached and emotionless.  He felt Draco stiffen slightly before relaxing under his hands, which, he was shocked to realize, had been absently rubbing soothing circles on the back of the Slytherin’s hand.  He forced himself to stop.
Dumbledore searched his eyes a bit more and Qye swallowed, fighting the urge to avert his eyes from the elder man’s gaze, a nervous feeling arising in him at the penetrating look, a feeling worsened as the frown and crease deepened more.
“What do you think, Pater Nosferatu?” Verna Zabar suddenly asked quietly from the rocking chair by the small fire, not looking up from her knitting.  Jordan looked at the elderly woman in confusion from beneath his golden fringe, his blue eyes blinking in puzzlement.
The Gryffindor swallowed at the low murmur from above, the voice sounding like velvet.  Harry blinked rapidly, his breath coming out shallowly.  He still couldn’t manage to think…
Qye hastily scrambled off Lest while the vampire jerked away, his pale face flushed and a trace of embarrassment in his eyes. The dark-haired boy unsteadily stood up, dusting himself off, his eyes refusing to meet anyone’s as he mentally scolded himself.
“If you have any more details, Headmaster, I can’t - ” Madam Pomfrey said, settling a blanket around one of the teenagers.
Harry knew his eyes weren't the only ones to shoot over to Professor Opacre's calm face at the last part of her instructions. She merely looked back at them impassively and Harry tore his eyes away, a bit of concern welling up at him as he looked at Hermione gazing at Lest with a determined look in her eyes, wand held lightly but ready.
“Forget it,” he said shortly, turning around quickly and storming to the Gryffindor table.  He heard Ron and Hermione follow him silently.
Ron and Hermione had also stayed, fighting against the Head Nurse’s commands. It was only when Professor Opacre asked Pomfrey herself, a kind smile on her face and stubborn look in her eyes, did the disgruntled nurse acquiesce.
“And here was me thinking you had a thing for me, Ron,” he teased, emerald eyes twinkling slightly. Ron rolled his eyes and thwaped his foot as Hermione giggled.
Qye watched Lest in the reflection of the mirror on the wall behind the man.  He waited, the overwhelming rumble in his head growing, until Lest was reflected standing just behind him, looking at him with such a soft expression and gentle eyes.
“Dumbledore thinks it’s the best move to make,” Remus said lowly, staring into the flickering flames as he held onto his friend.  “After what happened with Fudge and his resignation - ”
The normally twinkling blue eyes narrowed and a murmur passed through the crowd. Out of the corner of his eyes, Harry saw the DADA professor’s brother stiffen, his own dark blue eyes narrowing as well.
“Draco Malfoy,” she called out without thinking, her mind musing on this new development.  A moment later, she inwardly groaned.
“Dean, help me,” Seamus stage-whispered.  “I have a midget after me.”  Harry glared at him before turning his attention back to his friends, idly wondering if he should break them up now.  Sometimes they tended to get very heated in their verbal spars and while he doubted they would hex each other, he didn’t want them shouting and bringing McGonagall or Snape to them and costing Gryffindor House some points before the school year began.
“What do you mean?” he asked confusedly, his uneasiness forgotten as he looked curiously into the blue eyes.  The ice in them faded slightly as a bit of amusement flashed through the sapphire eyes.
Harry jerked in shock as Draco barely dodged the punch where his head had been, his feet moving swiftly to the side.  His wand turned and fired off a blast of ice at Lest’s side, which the vampire dodged as he leaned back.
“Ah,” she coughed, pushing back the laughter that just wanted to bubble free, “No, Mr. Finnegan.  I will not be ‘biting your necks’ at any time.  Most vampires can live on animal blood or meat that is extremely rare.”  She saw the boys’ eyes flicker but it was too quick for her to see to whom they had been glancing to.  She ignored it and continued.  “While animal blood is not as nutritious for us as human blood, it does sustain us for long periods of time.”
“Fine,” Qye answered blandly, eyeing the wooden stick apprehensively. He watched as the nurse muttered a spell, turning the tip white, unaware of Qye’s curious eyes and twitching fingers.
Ron turned around and saw the group of a dozen vampires at the other end of Zabini’s spell.  A few held leashes to fresh beasts and he didn’t need to see the sadistic smiles on their faces to know more were coming.
“I’m going to start by saying I will not be revealing the details of our conversations.  If I hope to maintain any form of rapport, this will remain an important aspect in my relationship with the two of them.  In addition, I will be honest with them about anything we discuss.  With that…”
"Yes, but you missed the point," Professor Opacre stated easily. "One was aimed to confuse the mind and the other to essentially shut it down. Now, from what you've learned this year, I would've thought you would've already known vampires have great strength with their minds." She raised an eyebrow. "Telekinesis, telepathy, ring any bells?"
The vampire woman let out an irritated sigh.  “Well, no, not in the strictest sense since you’re already bonded and there is no way around
he thought in a distant part of his mind as fear began to grow in him, growing with each moment that Dumbledore was silent.  ‘
Harry rolled his eyes.  “Oh, don’t act dumb,” he said acidly to the other boy, glaring irritably.  “If anyone’s lost it, it’s been you. The only thing that could’ve changed more than you is a butterfly.  What happened?  I can’t believe you got a heart over the summer, Malfoy.”
“Although,” he added, shakily, walking backward towards High Street as he slowly let go of Draco’s hand, “I am very curious to know how you’ll explain this to Ron.”  He turned to the street, very conscious of Draco gradually joining him.  “Might be a short date.”
“Opposite,” Ron responded promptly, shoving his hands in his pockets.  “Wait till you see Fred and George, I think they still have a couple of Mum’s hexes on them.  Did you get our gifts?” he asked.
“Huh,” he said again thoughtfully, tilting his own head.  He reached out like he had before and felt it this time, felt Harry’s own mind reaching for his.
“Guys, can you bicker about that later?” Harry asked quietly, flipping through his textbook idly.  “I kind of don’t want to get on the bad side of this teacher.”
Harry turned on his side and curled up, staring dully at the darkness in the room. Funny, he never thought he would miss that annoying little voice in his head. Qye would probably have made a million comments today that would have had him annoyed to death because of their cynicism or embarrassed because he would be on the verge of laughter. He might’ve had advice on how to deal with this set of problems. Made some sarcastic comment about the gossiping nature of people and had a sympathetic fume with Hermione about Seamus. He would’ve even enjoyed seeing Lest again.
A girl on the right side of the class jumped and squeaked.  Marylin turned her eyes toward her and the blond girl paled noticeably.
“Guess you’re stuck in here, huh?” Ron said sympathetically and Harry sighed and slumped against his pillows. “Rotten luck but at least you didn’t have to go to Potions all week.”
“There’s still paperwork and other stuff to figure out,” Sirius mumbled into his shoulder while Remus held on, Albus seeing the way the younger man fought back tears as he made his way to his chair.  “It’s going to take a while since Kingsley’s trying to keep it quiet until all - ”
“You’re both doing better than I was expecting,” Smethwyck said, folding his arms.  “But you’ll have to forgive me if I err on the side of caution when my patients wake unexpectedly.  Especially knowing what I know now about what you did.”
“What’s happening?” Qye asked as he stared at Smethwyck from where he lay on the bed, his head hanging upside down from the edge of it.
“I never said anything about a fix, Pater Opacre,” she responded calmly.  “I see items of concern, certainly, but I would no more say I could fix them than I would say I fix any of my other patients.”
The Slytherin frowned. “Yes, you are. You should go up to the Infirmary. The potion is finished, or as much as it will be anyway.” The frown disappeared and a small smirk came upon the pale face. “Do you want me to carry you up again?”
“You know,” grumbled Ron as he climbed down from the Divination classroom, “I don’t know who’s battier – Trelawney or Dumbledore.”
He had paled slightly at hearing that.  Hearing that the house had to be cleaned up…Dumbledore didn’t tell him the details of what had happened and the Prophet’s article was vague on the attack.  All he had managed to gleam from what he heard was that his cousin had been locked in the cupboard and the neighbors had frantically called the police when they had discovered the bodies of Petunia and Vernon in the living room.  He knew that the murder had been brutal but hearing that the house had to be cleaned…he had been ill after the official had left.
Most of the common room was empty except for a couple of first years drooping at one of the tables, most likely trying to get a head start for the impending exams.  The rest of Gryffindor was undoubtedly either sleeping off the night before or out for a late breakfast.
, the signals of Voldemort and his allies portkeying away.  More Dazain vampires fell but Dazain himself and a few others vanished as Lest turned his attention and tried to run towards the light.
Qye added and he realized he couldn’t tell what Harry was feeling, couldn’t feel his actions like he did when they shared a body.  He turned to see Harry frowning right back at him.
He should be moving but even if Lest’s arms hadn’t been unyieldingly wrapped around him, he found himself unable to.  There was something in the kiss, something furious and possessive tied with something tender and longing.  It asked for something and his body buzzed with it despite himself and he didn’t understand it.
Once or twice, he had seen Hermione open her mouth, obviously wanting to make him talk about how he felt about the fate of the Dursleys but, thankfully, Ron had just shaken his head at her and she went silent.  Harry absently wondered what was going on between them, what with all this silent communication and understanding among them.  He wondered if it meant that they would realize their feelings soon.  He hoped it did because he doubted he could take much more of their bickering.
he thought firmly to himself, absently flexing his hands, and then jumping shakily as he found he had hands to flex. Another deep breath. ‘
“Come on,” Harry heard Malfoy finally say coldly to the other Slytherins, breaking the tension.  “I just took a shower.  I’d rather not get dirty.”
The male vampire hissed and barely dodged Ron’s burst of flame, whirling around as his companion bellowed and clutched her leg, blood streaming from Malfoy’s spell.  She flung her free arm out and Malfoy dodged as Ron threw a shield charm in time to block a tossed suit of armor.
“Calm down, help is coming,” someone whispered and Qye whimpered, prying his eyes open slightly, whimpering as the blows came faster against his mind, shaking his body with each hit. Another cry was wrenched from his throat as another blow hit him and the cool hand pressed harder against his back slightly, offering comfort, offering protection, offering…
*waves* The past four years happened. And now it's 2020 and I'm sure we all know how that's been going. If you would like to follow my writing twitter @greensaysk you might get some little tidbits as I write (I've been posting some Kinktobers for various fandoms to get back into the habit). Thank you to everyone who's stuck around waiting, I love you all so much and hope you are all doing as well as possible.
“It wasn’t an option in the first place!” Sirius hissed at him, looking worriedly back at them as if they were going to start going off.
Qye murmured as he ceased stirring and sat back against the wall, listening to the gentle simmering while twirling the Jobberknoll feather.
“Are you alright, Potter?” Malfoy asked slowly, his gray eyes studying him.  “You haven’t been yourself lately…”
“Last year was different,” Ron said flatly as he scanned the Great Hall.  He frowned as he caught Malfoy’s eyes, which darted next to him and then narrowed as they didn’t find their target.  He made a face and turned back to his table where he saw the rest of the Gryffindors eyeing him.
He was taken aback as Professor Opacre immediately sat up, her blue eyes turning from kind and gentle to strange and gleaming.  “You want me to help with an outfit?” She paused, the shine in her eyes muting slightly.  “Why?”
“Will you stop staring at me?” mumbled Harry later at lunch. “I’m not going to keel over, you know.”
The next moment, Seamus and Neville were there, helping him as Harry fought wildly, putting themselves between him and the destruction.
“They insist they are not the same person,” he said bluntly, watching the news break to the huddled group who less than an hour ago were moments from tearing each other apart.  Dumbledore’s expression didn’t change as he studied Jonas gravely.  Black’s mouth opened and closed while Marylin’s mouth hung wide open, her eyes wide and shocked. Lupin rubbed his temple with one hand, his brow furrowed and face troubled.
Dropping his eyes, he hurried into the Potions classroom.  Quickly sitting down beside Malfoy, he mechanically began to set up his materials as the rest of the Gryffindors silently walked in a moment later.  He saw Malfoy shoot him a sharp look but he managed to keep a straight face.  After a moment, the Slytherin looked away and continued to read his textbook.
“I never fucking asked you to!” Qye snarled, standing, ignoring Smethwyck worriedly hovering behind him.  “I never told you to do anything!”
“Hey,” Ron interrupted, pausing in his actions and indignantly glowering at the girl. “What’s that supposed to -”
"You know the laws about them so stop stirring up trouble, Malfoy," Lest cut in before his sister could reply. His blue eyes glared coldly back at the Slytherin. "And I've heard wizards have their own ways of mind-reading so not much to talk, are you?"
Here, Ron's face turned red as his blue eyes glared fiercely up at the vampire, hand clenching around his wand, lips tight. And Lest...
Harry gritted his teeth.  “Fine,” he growled slightly, his bright green eyes flashing with annoyance at the pale boy.  “I’ll leave then.”  He pushed off the wall and turned to go further down the Entrance Hall.  He shivered slightly as he felt the cold touch his back, which had just begun to warm up against the wall.  But, he decided, the cold was better than being stuck with an annoying git like -
"Just ignore him," Hermione said, still blushing but looking slightly downcast.  Harry guessed Ron's last comment must have struck something in her but she managed to push away her sadness.  He absently made a note to have a talk with Ron about Hermione soon.  The two were driving him mad with their little dance.
Even with the Weasleys’ protection though, people continued to stare and whisper about him all week.  The Halloween Feast yesterday had been a torture and the only reason he had gone was because Hermione had threatened to hex him if he didn’t.
“Why don’t you two slit your throats and save us all the waste of time?” the man sneered as he raised his spiked arm, his cold green eyes trying to catch Ron’s.  “Callie’s going to decimate your teachers soon enough, you don’t want her attention any more - ”
There was a terrible snarl, its sound low and reverberating through the trees.  The rustle of leaves and grass echoed faintly behind the raspy sound of the leash uncoiling.
“R-really?” he asked in what he hoped was a calm and curious voice. “Well…um…guess I’m a fast healer, huh?” He gave her a weak grin.
,’ Qye thought desperately, angrily, pushing harder, trying to look past the regret and agony in Lest’s fucking stupid blue eyes, his hands shaking and gripping the handmade stake tighter.  ‘
“Harry…” Dumbledore said gently but he continued to look at the ground, rubbing his stinging eyes and feeling numb.
:: Qye finally said after Harry spent a moment blinking at the door.  Harry blinked one last time before sighing.
:: Qye said innocently and Harry felt his face flush slightly as he dropped his quill.  Making sure that Malfoy was still reading his essay, he turned inward to the other boy.
“This conversation was long due in coming,” Hermione sniffed. “It’s not our fault that you got us so worried that we had to let it all out - ”
“Yell a little louder, why don’t you, Hermione?” Seamus grumbled, glancing around the corridor. “And I’m always a little behind in the class anyway so it’s not like it matters or anything.” He shuddered. “I’d hate to think what I’d be like without it.”
“I’ll be having words with him too,” Marylin sighed, falling back into the armchair and closing her eyes.  “Can you at least try to ignore him?”  Lest made a noncommittal sound and she sighed again.  “I suppose that’s the best I can get.  But, ignoring him, what do you think?”
.::  There was a silence again and Harry blinked his eyes, raising a hand to scrub away a couple tears of pain.  Then he jerked slightly as some of the pressure in his eyes faded.
Harry was at Hogwarts, being treated while Malfoy looked after him, and the Opacre vampires still skulked around.
He made sure to pause once or twice – maybe more, he didn’t care, he couldn’t focus – and talk with the students.  He dimly noted apprehension and some fear in their eyes and wondered if any progress had been done.  Maybe there hadn’t been any…or maybe the nervous state was simply because of him.
Lest’s eyes still seemed to follow him every time he entered the Great Hall to the point where he could barely eat.  Qye, thankfully, never said anything when Harry made his excuses to leave his presence as quickly as possible, however much Harry could feel his heartbreaking longing.
He had been sitting in the tree, content with his peace and quiet when he heard voices approaching. Concealing himself further within the branches, he had turned his eyes to see Weasley and Granger coming towards the tree with Myn and…
Harry furrowed his brow in confusion.  Then he noticed the sudden silence in the room.  Turning slightly in his seat, he looked at the doorway.
“Then would you mind telling me why you care to disrupt it?” growled Snape, unmoving from his position in blocking the doorway.
“This is the file I was given,” she said, studying him, and he gritted his teeth at the sensation, glaring back at her while his fingers twitched.  There was a faint clatter as the windows shook and he saw her glance towards them briefly before looking back at him.  “I have already added my own section into it but I have yet to determine what would be best moving forward.”
“He calls us by our names,” Harry murmured again.  “And hasn’t said anything besides the fact that he wants our bodies healthier.”
“That’s hardly considerate when everything has been set,” Lord Voldemort interrupted as he apparated a few feet from them.
’ She groaned silently and made a mental note to make a restriction with Ravenclaws concerning length.
“Oh, look, some novice Venators,” the man said contemptuously.  “You’re hardly the Nosle Kids, give this up.”
There were snarls and cracks, flashes of green and red lights, and he heard a faint whisper as a figure dashed past him as he muzzily began to lose consciousness.
“Libby, this is Qye,” Smethwyck continued, gesturing to him sprawled out and watchful.  “And that is Harry.”  Harry said nothing and Qye fought the urge to reach out like before, wary of giving any clue of connection between them.
:: Qye threatened when Harry slumped against a cool wall in a deserted corridor on his way to dinner. He had shaken off Ron and Hermione to drop off his things and take a breather in the bathroom.
“Do you hear what you’re saying?” Lest broke in, his voice cold and face as icy as his tone as he looked up.  “You’re agreeing with this madness?  Are you listening to yourself?”
“Well, you know,” Professor Opacre smiled, holding up the pencil.  Harry squinted and felt a sense of unease as he noticed the silver tip.  “Just a few additions.”
,’ he thought fretfully as they left the elevator, his escort stiffening as they passed one of them.
Lest glanced at him once from the Head Table and looked away when Harry pointedly turned to Ron and Hermione.
Marylin bit her lip to keep from laughing. Ron and Hermione blinked in unison before looking uneasily at the startled vampire.
“Hermione,” he said through gritted teeth, counting backwards from ten mentally, “you’ve said that during the entire trip.  And I’ve repeatedly told you that I’m fine.  Now will you
Harry eyed her strangely, confused by where the conversation had gone. “You can’t exactly help with me getting sick, 'Mione. There’s nothing you could have done, it was my own fault that I didn’t listen to you and come to the Infirmary like you said.”
Smethwyck’s gaze turned to him, studying his no doubt stiff shoulders and fisted hands on the comforter.  The windows rattled slightly and the man inclined his head.
“Very well, then,” she said briskly. “I shall inform the Headmaster and your Head of House of this just in case it happens again.” Harry mentally sighed. “On Monday, you’ll return to classes but until then, stay in this bed and don’t become too excited.” At this, she threw a sheepish Ron and Hermione a warning look. Nodding once again, she turned and left the room.
“You know, I thought Granger might’ve strong-armed him into it to keep him focused on the O.W.L.s,” Zabini said thoughtfully.  “Maybe slapped Draco again.”
Then he was being dragged, the shock of seeing Voldemort standing with Death Eaters on the grounds of Hogwarts, seeing vampires standing there as well, seeing Dumbledore and Professor Opacre and Lest and –
“I’m tired” was all Harry said as Hermione worriedly held him, his words muffled in her shoulder.  “I’m so tired, I’m sorry, I’m sorry…”
For those of you who have dreaded a separation - I have read every review and heard you all - I assure you this matter has not been laid to rest as it most certainly has not made things easier. I hope you continue to give me and the story a chance.
“What the hell are you talking about?” he bellowed, glaring at the hooded man thought backing away slightly.  “What warning?!  Who
His smiled faded as he saw the strange look in her eyes and he blinked at her.  “Is something wrong?” he questioned, furrowing his brow slightly.  She blinked and started, flushing slightly.
“I finally managed to pick up our mail,” Remus said exhaustedly as he drew closer, removing the bundle of papers from his knapsack and dropping it on the table as he collapsed on the chair across Sirius.  “There was a letter from Dumbledore as well but I didn’t have a chance to read it.”  He rubbed his eyes as Sirius picked up the letter and tore it open, frowning as he saw the official Hogwarts crest on the top.  “I thought about picking up the Daily Prophet finally but the witch still recognizes me and keeps reminding me of her policy not to serve - ”
"But," the female vampire continued, spreading her hands, "it's not like I'm going to let you duel without giving you a bit more information on how exactly we duel." She turned slightly and gestured for her brother to come forward, which he silently did, to the front of her desk. "I"m going to give you a very brief introduction on the fighting styles of vampires. I'll elaborate more later but right now I just want you to pay close attention and grasp a basic understanding.
“Maybe you should go to the Infirmary, mate,” Weasley said, his goldfish expression gone, eyeing him with an odd look. “You don’t exactly seem like yourself.”
“Where’s Malfoy?” he murmured, unthinkingly, aloud.  The other Slytherins were there but the blond was obviously missing from their group.
Harry was suddenly reminded vividly of Hermione, of her concern and unwavering support and missed her with a pang.  Before their final O.W.L. she had slipped a mini treacle tart into his bag along with his study guide.
“I’m feeling well enough to dance?” Harry offered weakly. He had just suffered from the flu, two faints, and switching places with Qye within a week, so perhaps now wasn’t a good time to try and be funny with his friends...or ever, really. At the continued weird stares he was getting, he sighed and rolled his eyes again. “Never mind."
, sent me a letter this morning.  Apparently, wizards cannot handle wars among themselves.  He asked us to join his side against Voldemort, saying that it would strengthen the bond between all the beings of the magical community.”  He smiled mirthlessly.  “He also said he would help to stop the
As Harry calmly buttered his piece of toast – courtesy of the ever-watchful Hermione – he shouted and pleaded with the highly amused boy to stop torturing him.
Dumbledore had sent Ron up to alert the school nurse the moment Harry collapsed and then conjured up a stretcher for the unconscious boy. He had then proceeded with it to the Infirmary, followed by McGonagall and Snape. Neither he nor they said anything when Hermione silently took her place beside them but when Opacre and her brother stepped in as well, the Heads raised their eyebrows though Dumbledore seemed unsurprised. Madam Pomfrey had descended on Harry the moment they came in and left the silent crowd outside while she examined him for a few minutes.
One of the first years screamed as Professor Sprout blasted away another one of the rampaging monsters, its clawed hands coming dangerously close to her.
“My mother’s side of the family has long been a part of the Venator association,” Draco said.  “You’ll actually find most wizarding families have had someone in the family or known someone who was.”
“Leave me alone, Malfoy,” Harry snapped, scowling because of the interruption and because it was Draco.  He turned away and stalked back to the table, beginning to pack away his materials like the other students.  Draco, he noted, had already cleaned up.
“No vampires,” Harry rasped, looking around Qye’s shoulder.  She stopped at the expression on his clammy face, the brittle yet resolute look in his eyes.  Qye felt an odd tingle run across his skin, goosebumps rising up as something charged the air around them, and he kept his warning glare on the vampire even as he saw the other adults stiffen as if sensing something else.
Sorry posted this a little late! Holidays this weekend took up more time than expected.  I hope everyone had a pleasant weekend!
"The potion we're brewing today won't be as strong as those prescribed, seeing as most of you aren't ready to deal with your minds," Snape continued, smirking at the Gryffindors in the class and making the Slytherins smirk as well.  "The most the potion will allow you to do is skim the top of your subconscious and search through some memories you might have forgotten.
Trembling – Hélène, he was trembling!  He hadn’t trembled in years and now he quivered with barely restrained want! – he slowly opened his eyes and looked down.
Hagrid had explained to the class that Harry was not delusional and petting thin air but was rather petting a certain type of winged horse, called a Threstral.  The black horse was invisible to anyone except those who had seen death with their own eyes.  He explained that they were employed here at Hogwarts to pull the carriages so that in case of any attack, they would have the element of surprise to the attackers.
Green eyes blinked dazedly and watched the Slytherin step back.  Draco nodded his head and began to walk away before Harry could think of anything to say.
"Now then, Hermione did well," Professor Opacre said, raising her voice to the class as Hermione rejoined them. "As well as could be expected from the knowledge provided."
The black-haired boy smiled weakly at the brunette. “I’m not sick, Hermione,” he said, laying his arms on the table and resting his head on them. Taking one look at the food on the table, he had declined on the excuse that he would eat a full dinner. Closing his eyes, he murmured, “I’ll go after dinner, don’t worry. I’ll make it through the day.”
Jordan shared a confused look with his twin – how many looks have they shared in this one meeting?! – but blinked and turned when Krista gasped loudly.
“What?” he said, a little defensively, crossing his arms in front of him.  Next to him, Malfoy carefully put his drink down.  Ron grimaced as he saw his now free hand gently touch Harry’s elbow, which twitched as Harry glanced over at him.
"What are you two talking about?" Hermione interrupted, looking at them curiously as Ron continued to eye Harry with a strange look on his face. Before he could fashion up something to quickly drop the subject, Seamus scrambled between them, his horrified face looking at Harry.
“Harry?”  Now Ron entered, raising an eyebrow at him when he kept silent, not touching the food.  His forehead furrowed and worry slightly entered his eyes.  “Mate, you okay?”
“Would you like to start together then?” Wainscott asked and Qye silently reviewed the courses of actions he hypothesized last night.  “Or would you prefer individual interviews first?”
He could hear his son whimpering and his wife sobbing hysterically but all he could do was stare in horror at the figure.  There was something terribly familiar about this situation…
The hand squeezed tighter.  “It’s not your fault,” Dumbledore repeated again softly.  “Their deaths do not appear to be connected with Voldemort.  Do not put yourself at blame.  Not for this or for the deaths of those attacked by Voldemort.  They’re not your fault.”
Harry’s face flamed up – Merlin, he really needed to find a spell or potion to prevent him from blushing – and he choked.  “He…I…we…I mean…” he stammered, his face heating up even more as they both turned their eyes on him.  Coughing, he lowered his eyes and muttered, “He’s not my boy, Professor.”
There was a long silence and then he heard his footsteps recede, the rest of them following silently behind.
“Go to hell,” Sirius growled and Remus felt him tug at his elbow, dragging him towards Dumbledore.  “Come on, Moony.  Sooner we can see - ”
“Yeah,” he said quietly.  He made sure his gaze was unwavering as he moved his thumb across the back of the blond’s hand, a slight smile for the slight tremble in response.  “Yeah, okay.”
Qye’s heart began to race furiously and he swallowed nervously, frantically trying to think of a reason for the quick recovery. Harry had been sick yesterday but Qye had been perfectly healthy when they switched places so it made sense to him that he wasn’t sick.
He just looked at his reflection for a few moments, taking in what he saw.  Clothes that hung limply on him covered his pale skin, slightly golden from the hours of working in his relative’s backyard.  His cousin’s hand-me-down’s just emphasized how thin and small he was, easily the smallest boy in his class.  He studied himself a bit longer, noting how his messy black hair was a bit longer than usual, curling at his neck and an inch from his shoulders.  His green eyes were dull and hidden behind his banged-up glasses and he saw how they looked a little lost.  His scar was barely visible under his fringe and he absently ran a hand through his hair, making it messier than usual.  He noted how his face seemed a bit more hollow, gaunter than it was last year.
“I think that’s our cue to leave,” Hermione said decidedly. She gave Harry a last hug, which he returned warmly, before she stepped back, smiling kindly at him. “I’m glad you’re feeling better, even with all this memory loss. We’ll be back to visit you again tomorrow.”
A pale eyebrow rose up.  “Well,” Malfoy said, still smirking, “I’m leaning against this wall and talking with you.  What does it look like?”
:: Qye said in a flat voice as Harry waited patiently for the world to make up its mind of how it would stand. ::
“Shut up, boy,” Saira snapped, glaring at Jacob.  Jacob growled at her, glaring darkly at her with annoyed green eyes.
He blinked as he watched Hermione glance up and down the street, scattered with a few mingling Hogwarts students and Hogsmeade residents before dragging him a little further down to one of the gardens closer to Gladrags.  He furrowed his brow as he watched her pull out her wand and wave it with a quick privacy spell before whirling around on him.
Harry blushed slightly.  “Ah, I’m fine,” he said quietly, ducking down his head in embarrassment.  “Thanks.”  She smiled, looking relieved, and patted his head.
The entire summer he had been plagued with dreams of that night in June.  He dreamed of Cedric, staring up at him with his dead gray eyes, face forever locked in that expression of surprise.  He dreamed of that high cold voice whispering over and over again, saying ‘
Harry wiped away all traces of his smile and nudged the sulking blond’s shoulder with his own.  “Sorry, continue.”
“Don’t remind me,” Harry mumbled as they walked out of the Entrance Hall and headed towards Hagrid’s cabin.  Before Snape had even called out his name, he had a bad feeling that he already knew whom he would be paired up with.  And sadly enough, the first pairing to be called was him and Malfoy, right in front Snape’s desk.  Hermione had ended up with Goyle and Ron with Crabbe.  Poor Neville had been paired up with Pansy and was now sitting behind him and Malfoy.  At that point, Harry had revised his opinion about today being a bad day.
were the one throwing things at me in the first place. You’re lucky I decided to catch you and not just let you fall to the ground like you deserved.”
:: he thought wearily, reluctantly allowing himself to be pulled away from the gentle darkness.  Consciousness came and he sighed quietly, wincing as he felt a painful throb in his head.  He wished he hadn’t woken up.
“It’s not makeup, Harry,” she coaxed, still trying to move him forward.  He stumbled a bit and she moved behind him, holding onto both shoulders.  “Just think of it as enhancement, you have such lovely features, I just want to make sure people can really see it - ”
“I know you two have…issues, Draco,” she said quietly, her light eyes looking at him seriously.  “Honestly, I think both of you are acting like little kids about it.  But I can’t seem to do anything about it so I’m asking you two to
Lest dropped his eyes and said nothing as Harry walked past him, making sure his friends were between him and the vampire.
But he had gotten over that quickly.  Partly because he had never been close to his relatives so he could not find any reason to keep mourning their tragic fates for so long.  Partly because of the worry he saw in Ron and Hermione, seeing them looking at him sadly and uncertainly.  As much as he was regretful of his relatives' deaths and Dudley's commitment, they were not as important as his friends, the people he considered his surrogate family.  He made himself get over his downcast mood quickly, unwilling to make them worry more than they already did.
“Just wanted to see if one of my favorite students was feeling better,” Professor Opacre smiled. She caught Harry’s gaze and beamed at him happily, blue eyes glowing. “And it seems you are!” She hurriedly walked over –
The rage and pain still coursed through him, made his blood pound and his heart beat almost out of his chest, shaking his hands, fueling him past the exhaustion and grief and yet he didn’t move, staring down at the man he once called his best friend, who stared around him wide-eyed and bewildered.
:: Qye said quietly and Harry blinked, momentarily slowing in his steps before resuming his brisk walk.  Hermione and Ron continued to talk behind him, unaware of his reaction.
The dark-haired teenager stirred, curling up further in his bed.  “Go ‘way, Ron,” Harry mumbled as he buried his face in his pillow.  “Wanna sleep…”
All her frustration from the exams, Lest’s heavy silences, and the pressure from the families came to a head.
“Lest, why are you staying so long?” she asked, resting her arms on her armrests, clenching and unclenching her hands.  “You arrived the beginning of March, it’s already May.  Saira and Leon and all the other Heads are wondering exactly what your angle is here.
Harry stirred slightly, his eyes fluttering open slowly.  Stifling a yawn, he raised a hand to rub at his bleary eyes.  The winter sunlight poured in from the window and he slowly sat up, hearing bustle from Madam Pomfrey’s office.
"You can't put such labels," she said stiffly. "We all have different jewels and abilities and manners in which we use them. For example, my defensive skills are much more effective than those of my brother and my telekinetic abilities happen to be easier to employ - "
“I merely wanted to see if you shared those memories,” Wainscott said simply.  “As I understand it, that experience occurred after Qye was sealed away but before he emerged.”
The two Gryffindors silently followed their Head but not without taking a last worried look at the room where their best friend lay unconscious.
The world began to grow whole once more and Harry felt small amounts of relief creep into him as the other part of the world dimmed. Just before it disappeared completely, however, he heard something. A quiet, soft voice came to him in a bored tone of voice.
“Madame Pomfrey tells me you’re doing the same as me,” Dumbledore continued as Qye looked grouchily at the nurse’s back.
For a few moments, the students just looked nervously at the winged horses.  Hagrid’s happiness began to dim a bit but Harry quickly went forward before his friend could become even more depressed.  Hagrid beamed at him, Ron and Hermione as they went towards the horses, which were shuffling nervously.  They cautiously approached a bright white one and began to pet it.  The horse seemed to like it and immediately began nuzzling their hands, not showing any sign of being hostile.  The class was immediately reassured and within minutes, every winged horse had a few students patting it.
“Get back to work!” Snape barked and in a split second, the students jumped to return to finishing their potions.
:: Qye whispered as Harry watched Professor Opacre cheerfully wave a hand at the class.  He dropped his eyes when the blonde woman began to turn towards him.
Ron turned red at the compliment and Hermione flushed with half pride, half embarrassment.  Harry grinned slightly at this and Professor Opacre smiled cheerfully at them.
Harry thought to Qye, innocently shifting his eyes away from his friends and trying to think up an excuse to give them a moment alone.
of color wrong – he couldn’t do it in the Shrieking Shack and Myrtle’s bathroom was too obvious a choice.  There were too many chances some apparently unused classroom could be used as a rendezvous by some other students despite the exams taking place.
