“Good. And you’re securing the school?”
But the thought did little to comfort Harry. He hadn't even realized how difficult their task was going to be. Yes, they had the Horcrux, but what good did that do if they couldn't destroy the damn thing? And they still had to find the next one and kill the snake. And when they had somehow managed that, there was Voldemort himself. It all looked rather hopeless.
Draco arched an eyebrow. “Aren’t you afraid someone might see you following me to my quarters? They might draw the wrong conclusions.”
“Alright, fine. The Three Broomsticks it is.” the Slytherin girl finally gave in with a huff.
Sirius raced from the room and Ron gently laid Hermione down on the couch. Remus bent over her, checking her injuries. “What exactly happened?” he asked calmly.
“It looked like you wanted to attack us, mate.” Ron agreed.
"We should head down to dinner."
“Of course. Like I said, we're not going to tell anyone.”
“Well then, what are we waiting for?”
He couldn't help but notice that Draco seemed stressed out too. There were dark circles under his eyes, he had lost weight and he looked even paler than usual. Whatever Voldemort had ordered him to do was clearly taking its toll on him. Harry almost felt bad for the other boy.
“I virtually lived in this room all last year. I know how to get in. All we had to do was wait outside. You ran right into our trap.“
“Do you want to talk about it? The nightmare, I mean. I found that it helps me.”
“I believe you. But... “
Draco bit his lip, debating with himself. All his life he'd been taught not to show weakness. To act indifferent even towards those closest to him. But everything was different when it came to Harry. He knew how much his boyfriend valued honesty. So maybe it was time to take Luna's advice and voice his fears.
They left the shed together (after Harry had nearly run into the door, because he'd forgotten about the locking spell) and walked up to the castle side by side, their shoulders brushing occasionally. Draco had to resist the urge to grab Harry's hand.
Remus placed another glass of water for each of them onto the bedside table, before ushering Sirius out of the room. Draco was glad to finally be alone with Harry. But he still hesitated slightly, before turning to face the younger boy.
Malfoy sighed. "No, I don't think so. I suppose she's going to pout for a few days and then demand an apology, before kindly forgiving me." He sounded defeated. Harry wondered what was going on. Why was he dating that girl if he so obviously didn't like her?
(See the end of the chapter for
"I guess there was."
The afternoon went by in a breeze, amidst a lot of talking and catching up. Once she was done questioning him about Harry, Pansy told him about Pierre, a boy she had started dating recently. Draco ended up staying for dinner and only left after it had gotten dark. He felt a little bad for leaving Harry alone with Andromeda and his mother the whole day, but it had been so good to see Pansy again.
"I could help you, you know?" the dark-haired boy suddenly said. "Whatever it is that's troubling you. Whatever you're doing in there. I could help you. I could try, at least."
“Everything pisses off Ron right now. And Millie won't succeed in knocking you out of the air. She's one hell of a beater, but you're too fast. At least when you're not too busy staring at my arse to pay attention.” the blond joked.
“I think I mostly feel … betrayed. And I can’t help thinking you were right.”
“Hey Lavender.” he replied a little warily. Truth be told, he hadn’t had much dealings with her in the past. Aside from the few weeks she’d spent lip-locked with Ron. And his memories of that time weren’t exactly fond.
“I've never needed it before!” Draco snapped and Harry thought he could see him wavering slightly.
The dark-haired boy blinked, caught by surprise yet again. “You want to sleep in Gryffindor tower?” he asked dumbly.
“This one is broken. But... if it worked right, it could serve as a secret passage into the school.” Draco confirmed, before adding more quietly: “I've been trying to fix it.”
Therefore he was very annoyed when he suddenly found his way blocked by two boys from Hufflepuff.
“You want to know what I do in there, right?”
“Yeah, maybe.”
"He ... took me home. Healed my paw and ... he wanted to keep me."
Draco showed him the picture. Harry took it, staring at the smiling face of his mother for a long moment.
They finally pulled apart, gasping for breath, staring at each other.
“I know, Greg.” Draco said with a sigh. “Just... try to stay out of trouble as much as you can, okay? I think that's the only thing you can do.”
"It's obvious that you're blaming yourself. I know you. And no matter what stupid reasoning you've got going in that thick head of yours, it wasn't your fault. It was an accident. You couldn't have prevented it, but you saved Ron's life. Never forget that."
“I was…”
Harry was still lying on the floor, clutching his forehead, his face contorted with pain. “He’s coming!” he gasped, staring at Draco in wide-eyed fear. It took the Slytherin only a second to understand.
“I'll go with Harry. I can finish my homework later in the common room.”
“I still don’t trust old Snivellus.” Sirius grumbled.
“I've got Charms right after lunch. But I have a free period after that.”
“Is that a Slytherin thing?”
The red-head seemed about to explode, but Hermione intervened:
“Stutter at me?” Harry said with a grin. “Come on, would I?”
“You’re joking?”
"That's quite enough now. The patients need rest." Pomfrey intervened sternly.
Harry and Draco put their purchases away, before freshening up and following Longbottom to the great hall for dinner. The Slytherin was pleased to see Longbottom sitting down with Harry, both of them in deep discussion. While a part of him – the selfish, spoiled part – wanted to keep the Gryffindor all to himself, the more rational part knew that Harry needed to spend time with other people as well. They couldn’t only rely on each other. It just wasn’t healthy.
“It's just a story, Ron. And we shouldn't listen to Mr. Lovegood. He's...”
Surprisingly enough, Ron joined Harry only a minute or so after he had taken a seat at the Gryffindor table, while Lavender sat with Parvati, a good way down. When Harry turned to the red-head, he only shook his head and muttered: "Don't ask."
Another eye-roll. "Pansy isn't my girlfriend. She's my best friend. And you should feel honoured."
Harry rolled his eyes at the notion that Draco was his boyfriend, but ignored the comment for now. "So everything went well?" he checked instead, just to be sure.
Just as they reached the bottom of the stairs, the front-doors flew open and even more gigantic spiders forced their way in. The fighters scattered and started shooting spells at the Acromantulas instead. Harry's eyes widened in horror when Hagrid suddenly appeared, waving his pink umbrella and running right into the midst of the giant spiders, trying to protect the monsters.
The blond had never been so eager for the feast to end, but it seemed to drag on forever. He sighed in relief when the plates finally vanished and the students started to get up and head out. When everyone else had left, McGonagall stepped down from the platform and motioned for the eighth years to gather around her.
“How was your first day?” Harry wanted to know.
Apparently there had been quite some speculation about the fact that Draco had been disinherited by his father. Lucius hadn't commented on it, which only fuelled the rumours.
“What did he do?” Harry wanted to know.
With a nod the dark-haired boy went to work, setting up the protective spells he had learned from Hermione. When he was done he took a seat at the table and gratefully accepted a mug of tea.
She gave them both a stern look, before continuing: "And let me know if you feel any strange effects. I would also advise visiting the infirmary if you're feeling unwell. This is very old magic we're dealing with here. It's not to be taken lightly."
“No, Kreacher. You can go back to Grimmauld Place if you like. Thank you for your help. You did great tonight.”
"Whoohoo … that's what I call an entrance!"
“Yeah.”
“Great. Come on then.” Sirius urged.
Comments are love. Please let me know what you think. Even if you hate it.
Well, that was at least something. “And … do you think he might...”
“That guy threw you out before?” Potter asked, keeping his voice down so he wouldn't be overheard.
Harry thought back to everything that had happened that day. And finally he realized what had bothered him about the whole kidnapping-thing. It had felt staged, somehow. Their escape had been too easy. No-one had followed them. And Malfoy had been acting really weird...
Yes, Harry had no doubt about that. "Thanks for telling me, Dobby. Goodnight."
Harry turned to face Luna, already used to her showing up seemingly out of nowhere.
“I’ll need at least another day or two to fully recover.” Remus pointed out. “And I’m also not sure if Ron is well enough to apparate yet.”
The teasing tone still surprised Draco. That Potter felt comfortable enough with him to tease and joke around, despite their history. It was a little overwhelming. And yet it was easy to return the friendly banter.
“Drop your wands!” the voice ordered again.
“Not buts.”
Draco rolled his eyes and flopped down next to Harry. “Pansy has decided that we need to visit Muggle London. And since we both don't have much experience when it comes to dealing with Muggles, we were hoping you'd come with us.” he explained.
With the room of requirement constantly blocked by Nott, it was nearly impossible to get more than a few minutes alone. They managed a few stolen kisses in hidden niches and alcoves or the odd, deserted classroom, but the risk of discovery always made them pull apart quickly.
Without waiting for an answer she barged on: "Soul bonds were originally created out of love, did you know? If people wanted to make it clear that they were marrying for love and not because of some political arrangement, they would ask for a soul bond. Because once sealed, most of them are impossible to break. But then in the 1700s it became common practice among the old pureblood families. I'm not exactly sure why. The resources are rather vague on that. The trend lasted for about 100 years, before diminishing. In 1920 the use of magical bonds was mostly discarded and nowadays only some old-fashioned pureblood families still insist on using them."
"So much for this plan." Harry muttered darkly, while he was walking to the great hall with the others.
Cho shot Draco a dark look, but didn’t complain.
“But what about the cloak? I’ve never given it much thought, but Harry's cloak is really special.”
“It was my idea to go to Godric’s Hollow.” Harry reminded.
“Harry, look.”
“Okay. Take them to Shell Cottage. And then come back for us. Can you do that?”
He started tugging on Draco’s pyjama top. “Off!”
He really needed to stop telling Draco so much, Harry chided himself. He should know by now that the blond would use it against him, even if only in jest.
“Sorry. I didn't meant to...”
“She's got to be joking!”
He broke off as shouts and the obvious sounds of battle drew nearer. Seconds later Fred and Percy appeared, duelling two masked and hooded men.
“He … he makes us stand guard.”
“No, I didn't know. I... I'm sorry.” Harry muttered awkwardly.
“Well... my advice would be to risk it. We'll need all the advantage we can get. But it's up to you, Harry.”
“I’m very happy.” he assured again. “And it’s not like it’ll be just Draco and me. Looks like Daphne is going to move in, too. Which means that Lavender is going to stay over all the time. And we’ll have tons of other visitors. You and Ron, I hope. Pansy already demanded unrestricted floo access and Neville agreed to help with the garden. And Luna wants to check the house for Wrackspurts.”
“I guess in a few years they’re either going to date or kill each other.”
“I see Luna has gotten to you as well.” she remarked.
"Yes, she is. And the Aurors arrested Bellatrix." the younger boy assured, taking a seat next to him. Then he pulled the mirror out of his bag.
They crept to the door, which stood slightly ajar. Hermione cast “Homenum revelio” and they all held their breath. Nothing happened. They were alone. Cautiously Harry wrenched the door open further and stepped inside. Dust and dried leaves littered the floor and there was a steady draft. Dim light filtered in through the windows. It was just enough to make out their surroundings.
“Message?” Harry asked.
“I know. And I feel bad about it. It was just so cool to finally be good at Potions, after years of having to endure Snape's taunts.” Harry mumbled.
“I dunno, some Ministry hag.” Fletcher said with a shrug. “Little woman. Bow on top of ‘er head… Looked like a toad.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Maybe... if you don't want to see a healer at St. Mungo's, then maybe you could try talking to my mother.” he suggested suddenly.
“What is he doing? He's lumbering about like he's been confunded.” Millie said with an incredulous laugh.
“Yeah, so?”
“Calm down, Harry. We got away.”
“Something I can help you with?” Draco broke the silence.
“That’s okay. Christmas is the time to get sentimental, I guess.”
"Err... I was just looking for... Cattermole." Harry lied. "Someone said he should be up here."
“Harry, are ye alrigh'?”
The music started. Harry felt giddy with excitement. He grabbed Sirius’ arm and they walked slowly down the aisle, past the beaming guests. Harry saw the Weasley family gathered together, Molly already dabbing her eyes with a tissue, while Ginny rolled her eyes. Headmistress McGonagall with most of the professors from Hogwarts. Hagrid, who was taking up four seats and had put on his horrible, hairy suit for the occasion. Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt and various former Order members.
The red-head shuffled closer again, peeking through the curtains cautiously. He looked visibly relieved when he found them both dressed and turned to scowl at the Slytherin.
“Oh, stop pouting. It’s not my fault you’re ridiculous.”
“You mean they... they've left already?” he whispered.
“Yes, you are. And you can’t even hide behind your followers any longer. Bellatrix is dead. And Snape betrayed you. He was on our side all along. He’s been working against you from the moment you targeted my mother.”
“We found it!” he exclaimed.
“Umm... I'm not sure, really. I think I had an inkling after you went completely berserk when he got attacked. And then you started disappearing in the evenings to meet him at the room of requirement. Ginny's jealous bitch act started making sense. And you're always staring at him. It's really pretty obvious, mate.”
Draco looked over at Harry, who had gone ghostly pale, staring at the elf. He knew, without having to ask, that Kreacher was talking about the cave where Dumbledore had taken Harry. The cave where they’d found the fake Horcrux. Without thinking he reached out and grabbed Harry’s hand, offering silent support as Kreacher went on.
“Will be fine.” Remus assured. “She’s tougher than all of you boys combined.”
“But close enough.”
Ah, so now she was on about that again. She'd been harping about it for two days in a row already.
“What? But that's... It must've been the water.”
“Because only yesterday four students broke into the office and tried to steal the sword.”
“And the point is…”
“Yes.” the Gryffindor echoed softly.
Draco knew that it was no use arguing with her. And if he were in her shoes, he wouldn’t want to be left behind either.
Because if it could, someone would have found out by now. He knew that McGonagall and Flitwick had reached their wits end, even if they hadn't said anything so far. The way they kept glancing at him and Harry was telling enough. This bond was unlike any he'd ever heard of. And it was growing ever tighter.
Draco scowled and tried to flatten his hair.
The blond looked up with a sigh. “Has either of you ever heard of knocking?”
The Burrow was already bursting with people, with all the kids (aside from Percy) present and the Delacours on top. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were sleeping in the sitting room, after having given their room to the Delacours. Fleur and Gabrielle were sleeping in Percy’s old room, while Bill was sharing with Charlie and Ginny with Hermione. But since travelling here was so complicated due to all the security measures it had been agreed that Harry and the others would spend the night as well.
“Sorry, Harry. I just had to.”
"I did some research, like you asked. There really isn't much to be found about Horcruxes in most books. Which is a good thing, if you ask me. Because Draco was right about the Black library being very extensive. Especially where the dark arts are concerned."
“It‘s over. I did what everyone expected of me. Voldemort is dead. Now I’m free.”
“Well, at least you've got someone to blame. I practically ran away from my friends.”
“Yes, we were selfish. And I’m really sorry.”
“Have you considered … getting professional help?” Hermione asked hesitantly.
"And that's when Ron stepped in." Dean said with a slight smile.
“I’ve had it up to here with that slimy little ...”
“Pretty much the same. Plus Astronomy and Ancient Runes.”
He forced himself to remain where he was, while he watched students filing out of the classroom, chattering among themselves as they headed towards the Great Hall for lunch break. A few of them gave him curious looks, but luckily most people in his year didn't take that whole Chosen One nonsense too seriously.
“But … no... that wasn't … My magic's just acting up a bit.” Harry protested.
He rarely got a chance to speak to Hermione these days, since she seemed even more engrossed in studying than usual. She practically lived in the library ever since Ron and Lavender had gotten together. And the red-head now spent all of his free time lip-locked with his annoying girlfriend. When either of his friends did find the time to listen to Harry rant about Malfoy, they both only told him to stop obsessing over the Slytherin.
They had no better plan, so the three of them started searching for Umbridge's office. They found it easily enough, but there were about a dozen witches and wizards sitting on little tables in front of it, busy making pamphlets. There was no way to slip past them unnoticed.
“Okay, the window then.” he decided after a moment's thought.
At first he had bristled at the transparent attempt to protect him from the other students and their bullying. But soon he'd realized that the Gryffindor was just as much protecting himself. Because whenever someone grated on his nerves (which happened rather frequently) he counted on Draco to help him keep his magic from lashing out. It was a give and take and therefore easier for the blond to accept.
“No wait! He can't just go up to Draco and say it.” Daphne cautioned.
“But it is Bathilda?”
“We've just been to the hospital wing to check up on Neville.” Hermione changed the subject, taking pity on Ron.
“Good. Now focus on your body. Feel every part of it. From your toes up your legs … your stomach … your back … chest … your arms down to your fingertips … and up to your head.”
Snape’s eyes swept over Ginny and Blaise, before coming to rest on Draco again.
“Then the poisoner didn't know Slughorn very well.” Hermione spoke up for the first time in what felt like hours. “There was a good chance he'd keep it for himself.” she pointed out, visibly pulling herself together.
It took a moment for the implication of those words to sink in.
They continued pacing back and forth, casting nervous glances at the blank wall every now and then. Sometimes they talked in hushed whispers, but mostly they were silent. Draco had no idea how much time went by like this. He was starting to wonder if anything at all would happen here tonight and his thoughts kept straying to Harry.
“But … I’m a horcrux.” Harry said meekly. It seemed as if his anger had dissipated just as quickly as it had come and all the fight drained out of him.
"Thank you."
“Okay. I guess then I'll try to be nice to the ferret. As long as he doesn't try to piss me off.”
Harry looked over at him. Sopping wet and dirty, with angry red burns on his face, Draco was still the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. He knew that the thought should scare him. Terrify him, really. But somehow it didn't. And before he really knew what he was doing, he had grabbed the blond's arm, pulled him flush against his body and covered Draco's lips with his own.
“It used to be my home. But then the Dark Lord came and turned it into his home. So much has happened there. So much death and darkness. I could never view it as my home again. It's better to leave it all behind and start over.” the blond said. “Of course father would think differently. But since he's going to spend the next 20 years locked up in Azkaban, he doesn't have a say in the matter.”
Yay, another chapter finished. And this time I've changed things quite a bit from how they're going in the book(s). Please tell me what you think. Did I make it too easy for them?
He'd been nervous when Andromeda had announced that Potter had just arrived. On her insistence he had waited in the living room with his mother, while Andromeda went to greet Potter and warn him about their presence. But something must have gone wrong, because suddenly he had felt a wave of magic, so strong that it had made the walls tremble.
Unfortunately he didn't seem to be here to bring Harry more water. His hands were empty safe for his wand. So it was time for the questioning then. Or the torture. Harry found that he didn't much care either way. The thought of being tortured didn't even scare him right now. He only felt numb.
"Can it be broken?" Draco spoke up for the first time.
"Even if you could… He's got my mother."
Draco winced and said nothing. Harry was right. It had been bad. Very bad. It had triggered the worst nightmare he’d had in months. Though he doubted that this had been their intention.
“You mean... everyone else just waited for you to … explode?”
Once again Draco felt tears welling up in his eyes. "Thank you."
Hermione didn’t know what to say. She was also a bit distracted by the dopey grin that appeared on Malfoy’s face when Harry said the word boyfriend. She hadn’t thought the haughty Slytherin would  be capable of such a soft look.
They were all pretty quiet that day. It seemed that everyone was still dealing with what had happened. Trying to come to terms with the fact that they’d almost walked into a trap and that they still were no nearer to finding the bloody sword. The situation looked rather hopeless.
“Sirius!” Draco called helplessly.
It wasn't fair, mentioning his godson. Because Harry had promised Remus that he would look after the boy. That he would be there for him and protect him. He would do anything to make sure that Teddy didn't get hurt. Even going to see a healer.
For a second she was stunned speechless. And not only because Draco Malfoy had just paid her a compliment.
“Ohh those are pretty.” Hannah commented. “Do they have a special meaning?”
He visibly shook himself. “Anyway … it’s too late now. Nothing to be done about it. I’m glad I know the truth, but it doesn’t really change anything.”
“Why don't you continue with the meetings?” Draco wondered. “Umbridge's stupid proclamations have been taken back. You could turn it into an official study group. Practice the things we learn in DADA. Now that aunt Andromeda won't return for tutoring, I'm sure people would appreciate it.” he suggested. Longbottom gaped at him, obviously surprised that he would encourage them.
Draco shook his head and decided to go to bed early. Maybe he could talk some sense into Millie tomorrow morning. Or maybe he could get Hermione to do it. She was usually very good at playing mediator.
“Sorry, got held up by Urquhardt.” the blond muttered.
“Oh, I don't know. I think pulling me behind that tapestry after Potions the other day was pretty reckless.” Harry pointed out.
“You’ve still got it!” Hermione shouted.
Harry nodded and quietly followed him through a sturdy door into the cosy little kitchen.
“That’s … scary.” Draco muttered.
“I suppose it is a risk we’ll have to take.” the werewolf mused.
Draco recovered from the ritual fairly quickly. Harry did not. He was tired easily and spent most of the next couple of days sleeping. Since he knew how much his boyfriend hated being bedridden, Draco played up his own tiredness and stayed in bed with him. He suspected that Sirius and Remus saw right through him, but they didn’t comment on it. It was actually kind of nice, just lazing around in bed with Harry all day. Sirius poked his head in every now and then (usually accompanied by a lewd comment of some sort) and Ron brought them food, but aside from that they were mostly left alone.
"Erumpent Horns are Class B Tradeable Material! They can explode at the slightest touch." Hermione explained.
“Let's scoot up a bit. And take off your shoes.”
"Did she go running home to daddy?" Parkinson joked.
"So, umm… Hogsmeade…"
"Not helping."
But the blond was always very careful. Opening the door just a crack, just enough to slip through and then quickly pushing it closed again, before Harry even got near it.
“We've got to kill the snake.” she said. “You need to find out where Voldemort is, Harry. He'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it – look inside his head.”
Professor McGonagall was crouched over someone on the floor. Draco could only make out red hair and lots of blood and felt like he might be sick. Ron was next to his head of house, looking deathly pale and close to panicking. A few feet to the left Millicent was trying to shield Neville's prone form from stray hexes.
With a defeated sigh he turned away and made his way down to the Quidditch pitch. Harry had been fretting all week, worried that his reserve keeper McLaggen would fuck it up. The guy was a pain in the ass, always undermining Harry's authority and mouthing back. Draco wanted to be there to offer moral support. It was the least he could do.
Harry was strangely quiet this morning, which never boded well. Draco kept watching him suspiciously all through breakfast. The younger boy hadn’t had any nightmares last night, at least not as far as he could tell. And he could usually always tell, because he was a very light sleeper and woke up every time Harry started thrashing around in his sleep. And yet something seemed to bother him today. Draco decided to ask him about it later, when they were alone.
As much as he would have loved to talk to someone about his deal with Malfoy, he knew that he could never tell a soul. Especially not Ron. He wouldn't understand. Harry didn't understand it himself. He should have told Malfoy where to stick his outrageous suggestion and be done with it. Instead he'd agreed to it and even signed a contract. It had been a stupid thing to do. He knew that. But he also knew that he'd do it again. He needed to find out what the Slytherin was up to. No matter the cost.
“We’re going to Hogwarts?” Ron asked, once they had all sat down.
And then a lot of things happened at once. Voldemort yelled in rage. A herd of centaurs came charging out of the forest at the same time as what looked like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls and started attacking the death eaters. Millicent broke out of the grip of the surprised death eater and sent him to the ground with a punch to the face. Harry uttered a war cry and charged at Voldemort. Everyone else followed his lead.
And then the door opened and they slid out on an avalanche of fiery hot treasure, to find a group of goblins glaring and pointing daggers at them. Harry pushed the cup into his pocket and drew his wand. “Stupefy!”
“They’re supposed to prevent Wrackspurts.” Harry explained.
"I thought Weasley was dating that awful giggly Gryffindor."
Harry wasn't sure how to feel about this. He had always looked up to Dumbledore. He'd adored the man, defended him and been secretly proud of the special relationship they had. And now he had to learn that this relationship was only born from necessity. That Dumbledore probably had no affection for him whatsoever. Harry had only been a pawn in the war against Voldemort. And now he couldn't even go up to the headmaster's office and tell him how disappointed he was, because you just didn't yell at people who were dying, right?
Harry put the box on a shelf and turned to look at his boyfriend expectantly.
Harry glanced down at his own lap (thankfully still covered by the blanket) and blushed again. Draco didn’t have to be a Legilimens to know what he was thinking. Trying to diffuse the awkward tension between them he quipped: “Actually… being cuddled by you was nicer than when Pansy did it. She’d always tickle me when I finally woke up, trying to get me to smile.”
“If he vos not a guest of Fleur’s, I would duel him right here for vearing that filthy sign.” Krum spat.
“Yes, it is.” the blond confirmed. “You showed me the album of your parents and I noticed that there were almost no pictures of him. So I asked mother and aunt Andromeda and .. well.”
Harry shrugged helplessly. "They don't even know what spell was used. And until they find out, there's nothing they can do."
"At least we've come one step further." Remus reminded. “And I’ve brought all the books from Grimmauld Place that might have any mention on Horcruxes. So far I haven’t found anything useful on how to destroy it, but I’ve still got a few more to go through. Bill also sent two books I haven't even looked at yet. There’s got to be a way.” he said hopefully.
“Sure I was.”
Draco shook him off. “I’m fine. I just got up too quickly.”
Just a short chapter today, but I think you're going to like it. And I'm fairly sure now that there will be only two more chapters after this. I'll reveal who is behind the bond in the last chapter. Anyone want to make a guess?
I'd say sorry for taking so long to update, but judging by the fact that there was only one comment on the last chapter (a huge thanks to floraescence - you made my day!) I guess not many people are interested in this story anymore.
“We're alone.” he whispered, giving the other boy a pointed look.
Yes, Gryffindor had won, but it had been a narrow thing. They'd spied the Snitch at about the same time and gone into a dive from opposite ends of the pitch. Harry was well aware that he had only gotten there first because he had the faster broom. And even then it had been a matter of seconds.
Soon they were interrupted again. This time a younger girl stumbled into their compartment and gaped at Harry, before stuttering that she was supposed to deliver something to him and Longbottom. She handed them scrolls of parchment, tied with violet ribbon and then gave a squeak and ran off when Harry thanked her with a smile. Draco shook his head. He was so glad to be gay. Girls were just too weird.
“Hey, it’s okay.” the blond murmured, pulling Harry into his arms again and the Gryffindor realized that he was shivering.
“Okay, let’s take a look.” he quipped, trying to sound more confident than he felt. Hey, he wasn’t a Gryffindor for nothing. So he grabbed the handle and opened the door, taking a step inside. Immediately he felt relief washing over him. The room looked almost like it had back in fifth year, when they’d used it for Dumbledore’s Army. Only without the books and other trinkets. “Come in. It’s good.”
Draco complied, shifting closer and both boys gasped in surprise when their groins brushed. They stilled for a second, as if unsure how to proceed, despite the fact that they had done this a few times already. Harry could never quite tell how they ended up like this. Most times it wouldn't go past snogging and maybe a few light touches. Either because one of them remembered where they were and put a stop to it before they could be discovered or because they got interrupted. Mrs. Norris had almost caught them at it twice already.
Harry shrugged. “It’s stupid, but… people were staring. They probably think I’m dating her or something.”
“Harry, look at me! Breathe!” he ordered. “You know how it works. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Come on, Harry. I’m here. I’ve got you. It’s okay. Just breathe with me.”
“And…?” he prodded.
Harry glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eyes. The Slytherin was trying to appear cool, but Harry knew him well enough by now to notice that he was nervous. And he couldn’t blame him. The thought of returning to the room of requirement, after what had happened there during the last battle, made his own stomach turn with worry. But it was the only place he could think of where they could test his powers without fear of being discovered or destroying something.
“So… you think it’s worth investigating?” Ron asked eagerly.
Harry couldn't really pin-point the first time it happened. Nightmares were a regular occurrence after the war and he was used to his magic lashing out while he was asleep, so he didn't think anything by it when he woke up to find his bedroom in disarray. Merely shrugged it off and took some precautions for the next time. He also didn't really notice any other incidents, though in hindsight he was sure that there must have been quite a few. Maybe he had deliberately overlooked them.
“And if you'd had a choice? Would you still have taken his mark?” he couldn't help asking. He just had to know.
“But... but.. he's not.. we're just..” he stammered, earning himself an eye-roll.
There was a flash of copper and a loud clang. Kreacher had sprinted up and hit him over the head with the saucepan he was still carrying. Draco suspected it wasn’t the first time either.
“You want me to use my godson as excuse?”
“Hey, you did good. You felt something, right?” Draco checked.
“Sounds like a plan.”
“I want… can I … taste you?” he asked hesitantly.
"Mother is safe?" he checked.
“Harry?”
The only thing he'd found out so far was that the Slytherin was spending an awful lot of time in the room of requirement. But despite his best efforts he hadn't found out what Malfoy was doing in there. He'd tried countless phrases to get the room to show him, but none of them worked. Giving up on that plan, he started waiting in front of the room, hidden by his cloak, hoping to catch a glimpse inside when Malfoy came out.
Something whooshed over them like cold air and Draco felt his tongue curl backwards on itself. It lasted only a second, before it unfurled again. The unpleasant sensation had him shuddering. Next to him Harry gasped. So that thing with binding Snape’s tongue had been meant literally. Good to know.
He was back in that dark old graveyard and watching helplessly as Voldemort returned.
“How are you feeling?” he inquired softly.
The spell didn't work either. Wormtail struggled against his magical hand, but he grew weaker by the second. Then his eyes rolled upwards, he gave one last, feeble twitch and went still. Both boys stared at him for a moment. But already the shouts were growing louder. The footsteps drawing nearer. Draco grabbed Harry's hand again and pulled him up.
Draco shuddered. He knew that voice all too well. His first instinct was to turn around and run and it took all of his willpower not to give into that urge. He took a deep breath and forced himself to creep forward instead.
“It’s the Malfoy brat. Today’s our lucky day.”
“Yes, I’m sure.”
“Yeah, I’ve been wondering about that as well.” Sirius admitted.
“I guess that could work.” he agreed finally. “I mean, Mrs. Weasley won’t be pleased, but it’s worth a try.”
“Dobby must be going back to Hogwarts now.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “I had to get away from Sirius. He’s getting bored, so he decided to torture me.”
“It really was about bloody time, don’t you think?” Draco asked once they were back in their bedroom.
As they followed the goblin on foot into the darkness, Harry thought he could hear shouts in the distance. He had no idea how they were supposed to get out of here again, but decided to worry about that later. First they had to get into the vault. All this trouble couldn't have been for nothing. He would not leave here empty handed.
Nott turned to Draco with an evil grin. “Look who we’ve got here. Malfoy. The blood traitor.”
“We're just here to see Harry off.” Granger said, her tone icy.
“No, you didn’t. … Don’t you think it’s … maybe a bit … soon?” Hermione asked cautiously.
"She's right. Of course she is." he whispered. "I don't want to marry Astoria. And not just because I'm gay. I don't like her. I mean, you've met her, remember? What's there to like? But there's nothing I can do. Father insists that I have to marry her. And if I don't go through with it, he threatened to disinherit me. And what am I supposed to do then?"
He left dinner early, grabbed his school bag and headed down to the kitchen.
“I don't care what my idiot of a father thinks. I made a choice. I chose the other side. And now get out of my way before I hex you.” he punctuated his words by pulling out his wand and pointing it at the other boy.
The old headmaster still hadn't found the next Horcrux, so at least there was no reason to worry about Harry's safety just yet. Of course that didn't mean that Draco was starting to relax, but it was at least one thing less he could lose sleep over. He really had enough on his mind right now.
“No, he didn't. It's really okay, Harry.”
“Did it work? Is the horcrux…?”
The whole thing was still very vivid in his mind two days later, when he went to Diagon Alley to buy his school supplies. The list had finally arrived that morning and Draco thought it best to get it over with quickly.
Once again thanks to everyone who took the time to leave a comment.
“She’s probably afraid we’d have an orgy in her backyard.” Sirius had mused with a grin.
Okay, that made some sense. So the younger boy nodded. They climbed down the stairs again and started searching the walls for a hidden door. Which wasn't easy, with the handcuffs hindering their movements and Malfoy trying to pull him along all the time.
"It was just a nightmare." the blond whispered again.
“Harry should lie down. He needs rest.” she announced. “Draco, why don’t you take him home? I’ll be along shortly.”
“I wish to enter my vault.” she demanded imperiously.
After Dumbledore’s death they’d had to give up Grimmauld Place. Now that their secret keeper was dead, everyone who had been let in on the location was like a new secret keeper. And that included Snape. Mad-Eye Moody had taken some precautions. He’d placed jinxes against Snape on the house, which also should bind his tongue and keep him from leading his Death Eater pals into headquarters. But they couldn’t be sure if those worked and the risk was just too high.
“Exactly. You need to start courting him.”
Physical contact helped to settle the bond, but Draco shied away whenever Harry came too close. Sometimes Harry would get away with sitting close enough to the blond that their shoulders were touching. At least for a few minutes. It was enough for now. But Harry had a feeling that it wouldn't stay that way for long.
“I'm fine, Harry.” Draco assured, allowing himself to indulge and lean against the younger boy for a moment.
“Shut up!” Sirius ordered harshly and the elf fell silent. “We have a few questions for you. And you’re going to answer them truthfully, understood?”
"He mentioned some books about pretty dark stuff when I helped him during the holidays." Harry remembered.
"Just ignore him." Remus advised, entering the room. "Sirius has always been a bit ... different."
"What happened?" he wanted to know.
"Really? But… McLaggen…"
“Did you...?”
Other people joined them only seconds later. Granger and lots of Weasleys, Luna Lovegood and Longbottom and hundreds of others. It seemed that everyone wanted to touch Harry, to hug him, pat him on the back, congratulate him. Draco loosened his hold only reluctantly. He took a hesitant step back and watched as Harry was swallowed by the crowd.
“Will you let me...?”
“Do you… do you think Remus will find a way to get rid of it?” Harry asked hesitantly.
Harry decided it would be a good idea to get Krum away from Hermione, before Ron did something stupid and offered to show him to his seat. Krum’s appearance was causing quite a stir. Heads were turning and people started muttering. A few witches eyed him speculatively. He was a famous Quidditch player after all.
"Let's get you home, little one."
And pictures exploded behind his closed eyelids. A steady stream of memories, half of them his own and half of them Draco’s, though he could no longer tell them apart.
“Sorry. Did I wake you?”
"What…. Are you mad at me?"
Harry felt a new wave of compassion for the unknown sender. Whoever this boy was, he had so much in common with Harry. He understood. And the thought that he might actually stop writing to him made Harry feel cold. Until those letters had started arriving he hadn't even realized just how lonely he felt. Which was stupid, considering that he'd pushed everyone away. Then again, they just didn't get it. And this boy did.
Harry stared at him in awe. “She could get us in.”
“You told me to be careful, remember? Not to trust him blindly. You let me draw my own conclusions.”
“Harry…” Granger called hesitantly and Draco felt the Gryffindor stiffen in his arms. His instincts were screaming at him to get Harry out of here. Away from the people who had made him lose control. Who had reduced him to this frightened mess. But those people were Harry’s surrogate family. And he had no idea what had happened to provoke that outburst in the first place. He didn’t know what to do.
“That’s what Krum said. He seemed pretty sure. He said he’d seen it carved into a wall at Durmstrang.”
Harry glanced over at Ron, who had gone very pale. He suspected that he didn't look much different.
Hermione hesitated, still looking at the blond, who rolled his eyes and drawled:
She had the decency to look sheepish. “Yes, I was waiting here for you to show up. I overheard you and Harry earlier, making plans to meet at the room of requirement. But I'm really not here to hurt you. I only want to talk. I promise.”
“But what about all the stuff Remus found out?”
He was distantly aware of the many people surrounding him, of their sobs and murmuring voices. Someone tried to talk him, Hagrid possibly, but Harry wasn't listening. He felt frozen to the spot. Unable to move. Unable to take his eyes off Dumbledore's prone form.
“Nothing?” Harry prodded.
Draco didn't need to ask what Harry was hinting at. He still had a hard time containing his blush sometimes when Sirius looked at him. And he sure as hell wouldn't forget the “Talk” the animagus had given him during the holidays any time soon.
“You were trying not to laugh, too. I saw it.” Lavender claimed.
“Charming. At least that explains why he’s covered in blood.”
Draco didn't know what to say. It was probably not surprising that Harry had contact to the Order. But that he'd actually get them to help Draco's mother…
"My only reason for binding you to each other was to save you. Both of you. That's why I chose this spell. I had heard about it in my youth. Lily and Lupin had found it in an old book in the restricted section."
“But…. the others. Hermione and Ron… Sirius … and the Weasleys…”
"Draco! Names are important. If you don't start using his…"
„I thought… with what lies ahead of us, you can use every advantage in a fight.“
"But he didn't succeed." Harry murmured.
“Narcissa, get out of my way!”
Harry jumped to his feet and stared in the direction the voices were coming from. And only seconds later he saw them, walking along the shore, craning their necks, like they were looking for something. Or someone. His heart was beating wildly and a part of him just wanted to run over and hug them. Another part however, still felt bitter. They had deserted him, after all.
But Draco didn't find out what she was going to say, because the moment was broken by the chime of the floo. Seconds later Andromeda’s head appeared in the flames.
“A brilliant mind who expected Harry to sacrifice himself! And you expect us to just forget that?”
“Yeah and that’s what I don’t get. I didn’t know you guys as well as Albus did, back then. But even I could tell that you’d never betray James Potter. That whole thing… it just didn’t fit. And Albus must’ve known that, too. And there’s another thing… the Fidelius Charm was his idea. You’re really telling me the Potters didn’t tell him they’d switched Secret Keepers?”
Leanne managed to tell her part of the story before breaking down in sobs. McGonagall sent her to Madam Pomfrey and then turned to the others, who explained about what had happened after Katie touched the necklace. Tense silence followed.
The Gryffindor looked sceptical. “And you expect me to just believe you?”
“It’s over, Tom. We’ve destroyed all of your horcruxes. You’re mortal.”
“Yes?” Draco prodded.
When they broke apart, both boys were breathless.
“Do you want to come back to the Burrow with us?” Ron asked hopefully. “Ginny won't give you any more crap. Mum made sure of that. And George already left. He's going to spend a few days with Lee Jordan and a few other friends. Not sure if Percy is going to keep his mouth shut, but who cares what Perce thinks, eh?”
“But I do!”
Draco kindly refrained from saying “I told you so.”, while Harry wanted to know what exactly Lovegood had told them about the sign.
“Could be a coat of arms. Which would explain why it was engraved on that old headstone in Godric’s Hollow. There are a lot of wizard families who’ve gone extinct in the male line over the years, so their coat of arms have been forgotten. Maybe it actually was the family of the original brothers. Or maybe someone just thought it was. That’s how conspiracy theories work. A lot of half-truths, mixed together to make it sound believable.”
Harry shook his head with a grin. Already feeling lighter he hid the mirror in his trunk again and was almost out the door when a thought occurred to him. He doubled back and grabbed his invisibility cloak, before heading back to the room of requirement.
“We don't have it any more.” Hermione admitted.
“Of course we know that you'd never hurt us intentionally.” the girl hurried to assure. “But you said you couldn't control it. Harry, that's not normal. I think you should see a healer.”
Harry looked at him and felt hysteric laughter bubble out of him. Hermione just shook her head and cast a wary glance at Goyle.
"You're hot, Draco. I bet there are a thousand cute blokes out there who would love to date you." Parkinson claimed.
“Huh?”
“Someone's in a good mood.” the fat lady commented.
“Harry! Gonna...” was all he managed, before his orgasm ripped through him, leaving him weak in the knees. He slumped further back against the shelf, unable to stay upright on his own.
He turned around when he heard soft footsteps drawing nearer. For a moment he felt frozen. Could only stare at the pale, blonde woman. Then he shakily got to his feet and all but threw himself into her arms.
Kreacher closed his eyes. “Gone.”
"What other option do I have?" Malfoy asked dejectedly.
"I'd love to. If you'll have me back."
“I thought we were your friends.” Seamus grumbled.
"You never do anything for me." Lavender accused, suddenly sounding close to tears. "You don't even wear the chain I got you for Christmas."
Grey eyes bore into his and Harry forgot how to breathe. Then Malfoy pulled back and sauntered away. The Gryffindor gasped in lungfuls of air and sank down to the floor. Had that really just happened? Had Malfoy, his enemy, actually offered him information … in exchange for a shag? And what the hell was he supposed to do now?
The blond’s eyes found his. “She loves me. She’s proud of me.”
“In Dumbledore's grave.” Harry murmured.
Malfoy made a big show of thinking and Harry felt the familiar urge to strangle him. How could this boy be so damn infuriating? He didn't like the wicked glint that suddenly appeared in the blond's eyes.
“I mean... you're still together, right?”
“Yes.” Harry murmured, startled out of his trance at last. “Slughorn poured it out...”
“Stating your intentions?” Now Harry was grinning.
“And his house is creepy.”
"Sod him. It's none of his business who you love."
Oh and Happy Halloween everyone.
“Wasn't meant as an insult. In fact, I think I'm really starting to like Longbottom.”
“Yes. I know you said the diary helps you. That you feel less angry now. You’ve also gotten really good at harnessing so much magic. And that’s great. Really, it is. But when someone pisses you off, you still lose control of your powers way too easily. So I thought … maybe we should try to work on that?”
“One like it, more precisely. Maybe the real Horcrux.”
“It’s almost December. No surprise there.” Harry added.
“Oh, come on…”
He pulled a letter out of his pocket and handed it to the blond. Harry leaned closer, so he could read it over his shoulder.
“No, you don’t understand, Remus. The Order is finished. You-know-who’s won. Take these kids and go into hiding. Go abroad.”
The Gryffindor had never heard of that before. But he'd been raised by Muggles and there were probably a lot of strange wizard customs he hadn't heard of yet.
“Why?”
“Are you going to explain what you meant with getting a horcrux out of Harry?” Ginny wanted to know.
Seeing his scowl at the mention of Greengrass, she added: “She’s sorry, you know? For abandoning Draco like that. They were never really close, mind you. Kind of like you and me. But she still feels bad about it. She failed him and she knows it. It’s just… She just did what her parents told her to do. It’s a bad habit she’s trying to break. And… oh, don’t scoff. You grew up with Muggles. You don’t know what it’s like in the old pureblood families. There’s a lot of tradition and .. high expectations. It’s not easy to just dismiss what you’ve been taught all your life. Ask Draco if you don’t believe me.”
It took only one day for the Gryffindor to get fed up with the other students. Quite aside from their unfair treatment of the Slytherins, they were grating on his nerves by staring at him or whispering behind his back. A few people had even asked for autographs or tried to take pictures of him. And it felt like there were giggling girls wherever he went. They followed him through the halls, to his classes and even bothered him during meals.
“And what the hell is that?” Draco asked, only now noticing the chain in Ron's hand.
Suddenly someone shouldered roughly past Draco, making him stumble and hissing “Death Eater scum!”. The Slytherin did his best to ignore the insult, but Potter glared at the guy, who hurried to disappear back into the crowd.
“Soon. First I’ve got to wake Remus. He told me to alert him as soon as you were awake.”
“Do that. Hermione knows what I thought of that present.” he claimed, though he wasn’t really sure. He’d never had the guts to tell her.
She sounded sincere and he had to admit that he missed having a female friend he could talk to. Luna was great, but so different from Pansy. Daphne was a lot more like her. As long as she didn’t start meddling too much he wouldn’t mind spending more time with her.
"I've probably gone mad, but yes Potter, I'm helping you."
“Oh we will. Did you already forget that we promised Pansy to go clubbing with her once exams are over?”
They finished their lunch in silence, with Harry trying not to stare at Draco too openly and failing miserably. The blond looked better today. He wasn't quite as pale and the dark circles beneath his eyes were less prominent. The sleep potion Dumbledore had given him had obviously helped. And he'd already eaten two decent meals today. Now Harry just had to make sure that he kept this up.
"Oh... yes... right."
“You didn’t know?”
“But at least I’m not as fanatic about it.” the Gryffindor claimed. “Honestly Mione, I always thought you were bad when it comes to studying, but he’s actually worse.”
The Irish boy took a menacing step closer.
“Exactly.”
The Snatcher obviously believed her lie and turned his attention to Ron, wrestling the rucksack out of his grip and cowing in triumph upon discovering the sword. Draco had to bite back a curse. While two of their captors fought over the sword, another one questioned Harry, who claimed to have been stung and that his name was Vernon Dudley. Draco held his breath, hoping he would get away with it, when suddenly the huge shape of a man appeared next to him. He nearly gagged at the smell of sweat and blood that seemed to cling to the stranger. And then he realized who he was staring at. Fenrir Greyback. And of course Greyback recognized him as well.
Draco was very quiet, despite the successful meeting. He had earlier overheard Luna chatting to Harry about last year's DA meetings and now couldn't get something the girl had said out of his head. It was stupid and yet...
“I hope they'll get used to seeing us together in a few days.”
“Good idea. Let's try the library.” Harry suggested, glad that his boyfriend seemed to have gotten over his worry for now.
As it turned out, caution wasn't necessary, as luck was once again on their side. The dragon chose exactly that moment to break through the floor of the main hall. Wizards, witches and goblins alike screamed and ran for cover. No-one noticed the three of them dashing through the chaos and out through the front gate.
"I want to explain that I didn't mean to spy. And I ... I want to help him."
“No way! You guys stay here. I'll take the cloak.” Harry decided.
The Slytherin was grateful beyond belief that Harry seemed to get it.
“She's your cousin. And you're bent. Your opinion doesn't count.” Ron decided, before continuing with his rant: “Mum also put Fleur in a room with Ginny. Maybe she hopes they'll kill each other. Ginny had another fit when she told her. She's really no fun to be around right now.”
Harry stared at the hairband again, only now fully realizing that this was the horcrux that had been inside him before. Suddenly it didn’t seem so funny anymore. He looked around at the others. Most of them were looking at him expectantly. Only Draco was staring at the hairband with a strange expression.
The blond only grinned and handed him a small package.
She came closer and Draco looked her up and down in the dim light. “Are you okay, Luna? Did they hurt you?” he checked.
The Gryffindor wondered if he would continue to be surprised by this strange, honest version of Malfoy. Had the boy always been like that? Had he really never known the true Draco?
“Abe?” Harry asked.
Harry grinned, catching on. “How about a bargain?”
The lesson dragged on endlessly and he barely heard a word McGonagall said. As soon as the bell rang for lunch break, he grabbed his things and stormed out. He only made it halfway down the corridor though, before he was roughly grabbed and pushed into an unused classroom. The door closed with a bang and he whirled around to face Draco.
Ron however, took the question quite seriously. “Well... we don't really talk much. It's mainly...”
“Fuck! That’s not good.”
People were blasted out of the way, as he advanced on Molly. Without thinking, Harry stepped right into his path. Voldemort stopped dead. For a moment they just stared at each other. It was strange, to see him this close. He hadn’t seen Voldemort up close since that night in the graveyard, back in fourth year. He’d almost forgotten just how ugly that snake-like face was. He should probably be terrified, but somehow he felt completely calm. He’d always known that it would come down to this in the end. And he knew, with complete certainty, that he had nothing to fear.
“You'll tell me? Just like that?”
“I haven’t told them yet.” she admitted.
“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we’re in!” she shrieked. She looked frightening, completely mad.
“A compromise?”
Harry was among the first to enter the great hall, but he was soon joined by Hermione.
He had no idea how to explain the oddities of Luna to a stranger. And now Krum looked like he wondered if he was being made fun of. Just great. He should have stuck to his tactic of keeping silent. Thankfully Draco stepped in again.
“Yes!”
“I guess so.”
Draco and Millicent followed him, after giving Ron a sympathetic look.
Draco's face felt like it was on fire, he was blushing so hard. Most of the other Slytherins had started craning their necks and listening in on the conversation.
“I understand your need to do something. To actively fight Voldemort. But I can understand Draco as well. He's scared that you'll get hurt. We're scared for you as well.” the animagus admitted and Remus nodded in agreement.
“I never said being in Slytherin was a bad thing.” Harry claimed. When the blond just gave him a pointed stare, he conceded: “At least not lately.”
“What’s your mum playing at?”
“Blonde Ravenclaw? Luna, for sure.” Draco mused.
Harry only nodded, feeling sorry for the poor beast.
“Oh, I know you do.” she answered with a strange smile. “That’s sort of the point.”
This decision however led to the next round of discussion, because Remus felt that it would be unwise for all six of them to go.
Later that day Remus managed to tune into a programme called “Potterwatch” on the wireless. It was hosted by the Weasley twins and their friend Lee Jordan. They used code-names and you needed a changing password to tune in. Today they were also joined by Kingsley Shacklebolt, who gave a short report about the latest death eater attacks and assured people that Harry was not simply in hiding, but working to bring down you-know-who. Hearing the twins joking around and Kingsley proclaiming his faith in them put the group into an even better mood.
"Mistress is calling for Mipsy." the tiny creature explained, looking sick with the strain of refusing the call.
“I wasn't talking to you. Come on, Millicent.”
He actually hated the old headmaster a little for dumping this onto him. Because after months of running away from Death Eaters, camping in the woods with Ron and Hermione and now in these abandoned houses with Malfoy, with barely enough food and too little sleep, he was still no nearer to finding the next Horcrux. And with every passing day, more lives were lost and Voldemort's power grew.
“Well, in that case, thank you. And just for your information, I was almost sorted into Slytherin.” Potter claimed and started walking down the street. Draco stared after him in stunned silence, before he shook himself and hurried to catch up.
Neville stopped walking and turned to face her. Hermione felt a little alarmed when she saw the serious look on his face.
“Mr. Lovegood probably doesn’t even know what it is.” Draco chimed in. “He most likely thinks it means something different. They’re a bit strange, the Lovegoods.”
“She’s what?”
“Yeah. And we used it to destroy the cup.”
The Gryffindor nodded thoughtfully. “But how did you know?”
“Kreacher tried to destroy it, but nothing would work. So many powerful spells on the casing. And it would not open. Kreacher punished himself and tried again. He punished himself and tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders. Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And Kreacher’s mistress was mad with grief and Kreacher could not tell her...”
Tense silenced followed her words.
With a shudder Draco forced his gaze away from the dead professor. Just in time to see Neville rip off the Sorting Hat and pull something long and gleaming out of it. The sword of Gryffindor. With a cry he swung it in a graceful arc … and sliced off Nagini’s head with a single stroke.
So, this is the last chapter. Not sure if I'm really happy with it, but I didn't want to keep you waiting any longer. Please let me know what you think.
"Professor McGonagall said you can tell us more about the bond now, sir?" Draco inquired.
Hermione gave him a curious look. “No, he didn't. Out of the whole lot, he's the most responsible one. He would never apparate drunk. You know that. Well, Neville wouldn't either. But it was his stag night, so... Why are you asking?”
“But I am. So if you're planning to stay, I'll expect you to be nice to him.”
Without pause Bogrod pulled a metal instrument from his bag and started making horrible noise with it. The dragon recoiled, trembling in fear. When they passed him, Remus saw scars made by vicious slashes across his face. They reminded him of his own scars and he felt sorry for the poor beast. Then he caught Sirius looking at the dragon speculatively.
"Ha bloody ha, Blaise." the blond groused, pushing him aside.
“Did you want to...?” Draco offered, but the younger boy shook his head.
Draco wrote back immediately, assuring her that he didn’t mind sharing his room with Harry, since he was used to it by now. And he meant it. Even if it would have been nice to have a room to himself again. He couldn’t escape thoughts of Harry anyway. So it wouldn’t make much of a difference.
"Merlin's bollocks, I can't believe we're cheering for the Slytherins." Ron muttered.
"You should give it a try. Your parents would accept you dating him."
“I can’t wait to tell Hermione that you own a house-elf now.”
A rough shake made him look up at Millicent.
The blond's eyes widened in understanding and he slowly got off the bed.
“That bloody, fucking…!”
“Me too.” Draco whispered back.
“No time like the present. Although I think it would be best if only Draco and I went this time.”
“I was so worried... when Millie told me..” Harry kept babbling.
“Drop your wands and raise your hands. We don’t care who we curse!” a sharp voice ordered.
“Why did you call it Master Regulus’s locket?” Harry wanted to know, getting to his feet again.
“I dread the upcoming match.” Harry confessed to Draco.
“Great. That means we only have to shake off mum long enough to get past the wards and disapparate. Piece of cake.” Ron muttered.
So they changed into their pyjamas and got into bed, but sleep was a long time coming. And then Draco woke twice during the night, because Harry was moaning and thrashing around in his sleep, obviously having nightmares.
The meal went by without incident. A little while later Draco saw Harry being dragged off by Ron, so he buried his hopes of a little alone time with his boyfriend and went back to the Slytherin common room with Millicent to help her with her DADA essay.
They reached the altar and Sirius gave Harry a quick hug, before taking his seat next to Remus in the front row. Narcissa kissed Draco’s cheek and sat down next to Andromeda. Harry smiled at Draco, who smiled back, looking just as excited and nervous as Harry felt. A tall, slender witch stepped in front of them. She was wearing a simple, blue robe and her white hair cascaded down her back in a riot of wild curls. She smiled at both of them in turn, before starting to speak in a clear voice.
Draco grinned at the empty threat, but decided to change the subject nonetheless. As much fun as it still was to rile Harry up, he wanted to talk about something important here and it wouldn't do to start an argument. Not right now.
Remus joined the hug as well and then Ron and Hermione were there, both of them crying. Draco was so fixed on his friends that he didn’t notice much of what was going on around them. A few people nearby had already noticed that Harry was alive and well, but most still seemed to believe he was dead.
Draco didn't want to know what Blaise meant by using the time constructively. It was nice that Millie worried about him, but she was totally exaggerating. He already knew that she'd be trying to follow him everywhere for the next few days, no matter what he said.
Of course Slughorn had them brewing Amortentia. Draco couldn't stop the wistful smile when the scent of Harry's aftershave wafted up from their cauldron. Once more his eyes were drawn to the younger boy and once more Harry was looking back. For a second their gazes met and he felt unable to breathe. Was he only imagining the soft look in Harry's eyes?
“I don't want you to stop trusting him, just because I have a bad feeling. You know him better than I do. And you have your reasons to trust him, don't you?”
Seconds later they reappeared in the dingy pub. The lights were dimmed and as Sirius had predicted there were no patrons. Only the old barman was standing behind the counter, pointing his wand at them with a wild look in his eyes.
The blond nodded and led him back outside. The door vanished as soon as they left the room, but another one appeared seconds later. Harry opened it and found himself back in the room from last night. He glanced at the bed and blushed, the memories rushing back full force.
He only snapped out of his daze when they reached Malfoy Manor and the Snatchers dragged them in through the gates. It felt strange to be back home. Though he didn’t really view the manor as his home any longer. Fern Cottage was home. Hogwarts was home. Hell, even Grimmauld Place felt more like home than the manor these days.
Since neither Harry nor Sirius seemed able to answer, Draco relayed to the others what they had seen. How Snape had treated Dumbledore’s hand and his estimation that the old headmaster had less than a year to live. Dumbledore ordering Snape to kill him. And then … the horrible truth about Harry’s connection with you-know-who. Dumbledore’s plan to only tell Harry at the last moment that he had to die if they were ever going to defeat you-know-who.
"You're still tired." Draco argued, pulling him down so they were lying side by side. “Let’s get some more sleep.”
Harry gasped, shaking his head wildly. “No! No fucking way!”
“I saw something move. There, by the bushes. Someone’s watching us.” Sirius insisted.
The goblin didn't even blink at seeing an escaped convict.
Draco hadn't even noticed that his boyfriend had entered the library. Once Harry spied him, he hesitantly came over and sat down in Luna's vacated chair.
“I can't believe you! We broke up, in case you've forgotten. You have no right to get jealous now!”
“Harry! That was supposed to be a secret! I told you it’s not even official yet.”
“That would have been okay for me.” Draco assured.
“You are.” Draco argued.
Harry looked at Draco, who shrugged in response. “Worth a shot, I guess.” But he wasn’t about to let Harry run through the castle with his ex-girlfriend. He didn’t like the way Chang kept eyeing him. “Luna, could you show Harry the way?”
“I don't know. I don't know what to believe anymore. But I know that I have to do this. Alone.”
Therefore he was startled when Madam Pomfrey appeared at his bedside, accompanied by Professor McGonagall. The matron looked him over critically and waved her wand over him, muttering a few quiet spells, before nodding to the professor and leaving again.
“Draco thinks I should get rid of it. But I just … can’t.”
“Then why didn't you?”
Draco knew that he did. That he trusted him completely. And that trust meant the world to him.
Harry’s smile became softer. He leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s for a second. “When you propose, I’m going to say yes.”
The train started moving soon after and everyone told stories about what they had done during the holidays. Of course Luna's were the most outrageous. According to her, she and her father had discovered two new magical creatures on their journey through Portugal. When the lunch trolley stopped by, Draco treated them all to a round of cauldron cakes. They passed the rest of the ride playing exploding snap and making plans to visit Hogsmeade next weekend.
A pained look crossed his features at the mention of Harry's mother, but he went on regardless. "Bond enaid sanctaidd - that is welsh and means sacred soul bond. The purest of all bonds, it is formed through love. Therefore it is stronger than any other form of magic. Which is also the reason why you both reacted so violently. The bond was fighting the hold Voldemort had over both of you. By acknowledging your feelings for each other and sealing the bond you rid yourselves of him."
“No, he didn’t. He wanted to, but since he decided to forego his NEWTs he really has no reason to be here, so McGonagall wouldn’t allow it.”
“Okay.” Draco agreed, blushing slightly. “I mean, I’ve got to make sure you don’t fall on your ass, right?”
“So you approached him, uncaring of the danger. And then?”
Lavender was getting more angry by the minute. Harry was only glad that most people were already in the hall and not here to witness what was sure to become ugly very soon. This fight had been brewing for a while, if he was quite honest. Ron visibly tried to reign in his temper, but the tell-tale flush gave his anger away.
“About whatever stupid idea is going on in that head of yours. This is a secret mission, remember? Keep it low key.”
“We could do it here?”
“No-one here but us.” Remus explained, the relief in his voice evident.
“Hmm… I can’t really explain it. But something just feels … off.”
Hermione had suggested that he should see a mind healer. He'd gotten angry and shouted at her, even though he knew she only meant well. But he couldn't talk about his experiences. Especially not with some stranger, who had no idea what it felt like to live in fear. To run for your live every day. To have Voldemort in your head. What it felt like to know that other people had died for you.
The new school year at Hogwarts had started about two weeks ago and Snape had been declared headmaster, much to everyone's shock. Judging by what they had gathered from the articles in the Daily Prophet, he had also hired two death eaters as new teachers. They could only guess what school must be like this year.
“Has that happened before?”
"So… since I destroyed the Horcrux, that means Voldemort is no longer immortal?" Harry mused.
After spending pretty much every night of Christmas break (and a good part of some days) in bed with Draco, exploring each other's bodies and allowing the blond to bend him into seemingly impossible positions, he was rather confident about his knowledge of gay sex. Not that he'd ever say as much to his godfather. He'd never live it down and Sirius was having way too much fun with this as it was.
“Sirius… Could you maybe stop making jokes at my expanse for a couple of minutes?”
Slowly the panic was receding. Draco let go of his wrists, but didn't move away. He was sitting so close that Harry could make out his features despite not wearing his glasses.
The boy nodded slowly, wondering when his hot-headed godfather had gotten so damn wise. It was probably Remus' calming influence.
It took only a few days for Harry to realize that Malfoy was right. Despite McGonagall's warning that she wouldn't tolerate prejudice of any kind, people were hostile towards Slytherins in general and the blond in particular. 'Death Eater scum' seemed to be everyone's new favourite insult. You could hear it all over Hogwarts, usually hissed at a Slytherin who was foolish enough to walk around alone. There were other words, too. None of them were any nicer.
“I’m not melodramatic!” the young wizard protested.
“And no-one’s seen it since it was lost?” Harry asked.
“And Bellatrix got suspicious.” Draco added.
"It's not. I'm merely good at observing the other houses. Not my fault you're less perceptive than I am." Alice claimed.
“Good. See you in an hour.”
And then, following an odd impulse, he pulled the blond into a quick hug. "It'll be okay. You'll see." Draco stiffened at first, but then he melted against Harry for a moment.
“They're going after the Horcrux?”
Everyone laughed and the tension was broken.
They pushed their way through the masses and out into the courtyard. Voldemort and his death eaters had gathered in a half-circle. And in the middle stood Hagrid, crying silently and holding a prone figure in his arms. A figure with messy, dark hair and glasses. McGonagall screamed in anguish and Sirius howled and fell to his knees. Harry rushed to his side.
All three boys winced sympathetically, though Harry doubted that Mrs. Weasley’s yelling would accomplish much. Sirius at least was completely immune to such things. Small wonder, considering how he’d grown up. If his mother had only yelled half as much as her portrait, then Harry supposed he’d learned early on to ignore it.
“No, he won’t. We made sure of that.” Remus assured.
“You can show it to your friend Granger first, if you prefer. Let her check it over.”
Draco sighed in defeat and allowed the younger boy to pull him along, grumbling slightly under his breath. The things he did for that boy...
“That's an Amaryllis. It means splendid beauty.”
"Kreacher will make sure it's delivered." the elf promised, fuelling Harry's suspicion that he knew more about his mysterious pen-pal.
Harry grumbled about the fact that no-one had felt the need to tell him of any emergency plan, but at least he stopped his panicked struggling. Draco only let go of him once he was sure that the Gryffindor wouldn't apparate back to the Burrow.
“Maybe Hogwarts won't close. We're not in any more danger here than we are at home, are we?” Ron reasoned.
“Get us out of here!” he yelled.
"That would be great. Thanks, Pansy." And he meant it. Especially with the way he'd treated her lately.
Draco glanced at Harry nervously. The younger boy shrugged and stepped closer. The blond was all too aware that all eyes were on them. And while Ron, Remus and Sirius knew and were okay with them dating, he had no idea how the others would feel about it. Especially Mrs. Weasley.
“He kept us busy until they arrived.” Hermione added.
Harry and Draco shared a look. Finally the blond rolled his eyes with a sigh. “I still don't trust you. And I probably never will. But I accept your apology.” he drawled. It was worth it for the smile Harry gave him. Ginny thanked him and finally left, still sniffling and wiping her eyes.
Remus burst into the living room. His eyes were red-rimmed, his clothes wrinkled and he hadn’t shaved for days. But he looked excited, clutching a battered, old book to his chest like a treasure.
“And what if it isn't?”
Harry grinned and kissed him again. He whined in protest when Draco pulled away.
“I guess so. But be careful.”
“Draco said you don’t remember anything from the point where the snake attacked you.” Remus cut in.
Draco led the way as they hurried upstairs. They burst into the ballroom just as Hermione screamed again. Draco pointed Wormtail’s wand at Bellatrix and yelled "Expelliarmus!". Harry caught her wand, whirled around and shot a stunning spell at Lucius, who was too shocked to react. The spell hit him right in the chest and he crumbled to the ground.
His boyfriend gave him a look like he thought Remus was being very dense.
“You could do that. Or I could teach you.” he offered.
“So? What exactly do you want to do?” Draco asked.
“But … when the letters came you said you'd go back. We all agreed that it would be good. You were excited about it.” Harry reminded them.
“They had a rather… complicated relationship.”
“Severus Snape?”
He was hiding at the back of the DADA classroom so he wouldn’t be forced to face the boggart, which would undoubtedly take on the shape of his father.
“Come on, Moony. The poor boy is going stir-crazy. And it’s only Grimmauld Place. It’s not that dangerous.”
“I don’t know what you want, Lavender. I get along fine with Draco.” Harry reminded.
And Voldemort would know that Draco was Harry's weakness and try to use him against the other boy. The risk was too high. For both of them. So he kept quiet and took what little time alone they got.
The second time he really had to acknowledge that something was wrong was a few weeks after the first. Hermione and Ron were stopping by for a visit and they all sat in the kitchen, drinking tea and enjoying Kreacher's biscuits.
The red-head spluttered, causing both girls to giggle. Harry found himself grinning as well. The banter of his friends was comforting and made him feel a little lighter. It reminded him that there was more to his life than only darkness, loss and pain.
“You’re afraid of their reaction.”
“Yes, you can. And you will. You will get up and continue to fight.” he ordered, almost back to the commandeering tone Draco had become used to. “Let Potter's sacrifice not be in vain.” he continued softer.
With a sweet emotion;
Harry agreed only reluctantly. He hated the whole secrecy. Maybe it would have been better if he hadn’t come to the wedding at all. He should have just stayed behind at Fern Cottage. All of a sudden he felt reminded of the parties the Dursleys sometimes had and how he always had to stay up in his room and keep quiet. "I'll just pretend I don't exist again." he muttered sullenly.
“The death eaters kidnapped Luna on her way home for Christmas break. They’re holding her hostage.” Remus explained.
“Kreacher has caught the thief Mundungus Fletcher, master Harry. He is waiting at Grimmauld Place. Kreacher apologizes for the delay.”
The others agreed, so they apparated back to Fern Cottage, where Sirius disappeared upstairs without a word. Harry looked from the stairs to Remus uncertainly.
“Yeah, right.” Harry agreed. “And if… if anyone has to see my childhood memories, I’m glad it’ll be you.”
He handed the parchment back and watched as Malfoy signed it. His signature glowed for a moment, indicating that there was indeed some magic involved. Not giving himself a chance to back out, he quickly scribbled his own signature onto the parchment.
And it did feel surprisingly peaceful, just sitting there, watching the sun glistening on the great lake. Draco had no doubts that there was still a hard time ahead of them. The war might be over, but there were still Death Eaters on the loose. His parents would face a trial and he himself would at least be questioned. He had the Dark Mark, even if he'd chosen to turn his back on the Dark Lord and help Harry in the end. And not everyone would be as accepting of his and Harry's relationship as his mother and Harry's friends had been.
The Slytherin got off the bed and started stripping without a word. He was pale and lean – like a statue carved from marble. Harry couldn't look away. His gaze dropped to the tight, blue underpants, which did nothing to hide the obvious bulge nor the wet patch that had formed at the front. His face felt like it was on fire, but he couldn't force his eyes away. Not even when Malfoy pulled the pants off.
The goblin looked at her evenly.
"Unfortunately it is. At least as long as I'm still dependent on him."
“Thank you.” Harry said sincerely. “And that goes both ways, you know? I’d do anything to protect you.”
“He’ll be fine on his own for a few minutes. He won’t wake up for a while yet.”
“You haven't told them?”
“Are you sure you’re well enough?” Draco cut in. “We’re probably running right into battle.”
“It's okay. I get it.” Harry assured.
There was Nagini, suspended in the air in some sort of enchanted, starry sphere. Harry wondered what kind of spell might penetrate that magical barrier. He wouldn't be able to try out more than one. Cloak or not, once he shot a spell at the snake, he'd give away his position.
“What?”
They were called eighth years and thanks to the fact that they were all technically adults, they had certain privileges. Like rooming apart from the rest of the houses. They had been given their own common room, which was nice, since it meant less people who would stare at Harry.
“I know that. But the potion won't help you in the long run. It's not fixing anything. It just represses the nightmares. You'll have to face your demons sooner or later.”
Of course comments are always a great motivation...
"Good. It was about time."
Harry just laughed.
But then Harry cupped his jaw and leaned in for a soft kiss and he forgot all about the others for a few seconds. At least until the twins and Sirius started whistling and making cat-calls. He pulled away and returned to his seat, blushing furiously and not daring to look at anyone.
“Hermione, what happened?”
“Harry Potter. So we meet at last.”
Harry closed his bedroom door and leaned against it with a sigh. He was so glad it was finally Friday. The week had dragged on endlessly and work had been boring as hell, since he'd been confined to his desk, because he hadn't followed Auror protocol on that arrest last week.
The Slytherin whimpered and jerked away from the touch. He struggled against the tangled bedsheets, throwing them to the floor in the process. Once free of that obstacle he brought his hands up and tried to push Harry away. The dark-haired boy caught the flailing hands and gave him another shake, a bit harder this time.
"Harry, is something wrong?" Sirius asked, immediately worried.
“Spying on me, Malfoy?” the junior Death Eater taunted.
Hey everyone, I'm back with the new chapter and the first part of the battle. Only one more chapter to go now. And the epilogue. Somehow I can't believe that I'm almost done with this story.
The younger boy nodded and they both landed back on the pitch. Draco shouldered his broom and was about to walk off, when Harry grabbed his hand, pulling him in the opposite direction.
Slughorn distracted him by asking the class about the different potions. The blond wasn't surprised when Hermione's hand shot in the air and she identified all three potions correctly. Harry blushed lightly when she explained about Amortentia and his eyes sought Draco's. But Slughorn distracted them again, by promising a bottle of Felix Felicis to the student who brewed the best Draught of Living Death.
“Couple of hours. Not as long as Remus predicted actually.”
The blond led him through what appeared to be alleyways, bordered by all the stuff people must have hidden here for centuries. Finally they stopped in front of a large cupboard.
Harry stopped to take a deep, steadying breath, before approaching the portrait of the fat lady and giving her the password. He knew that his two best friends would be furious with him for disappearing for half of the day without a word. True to form he was accosted by Hermione as soon as he'd set foot into the common room.
They continued on their way, finally stopping in front of a stone gargoyle. Neville said the password “Unity” and the gargoyle leapt aside. There were only a handful of people sitting on the couches and armchairs. Anthony Goldstein greeted her with a smile, while Hannah Abbott waved. Hermione looked around the eighth year common room in wonder, feeling a strange sense of longing. Visiting her parents had been great, but she had missed Hogwarts more than she’d thought she would.
“They are removed.”
“Okay, I'm not even sure if Hermione bought that stupid excuse, but I sure as hell didn't. So what are you really planning?”
“Are you ready?” Remus asked finally, once he was satisfied with the preparations.
"It's alright, Harry. I suppose you've got a lot on your mind at the moment."
Daphne looked at the Christmas ornaments above his bed and her lips twitched.
Harry wasn’t happy about this plan. Neither were Draco and Sirius, though Draco wasn’t sure if his cousin really disagreed with the plan itself or only the fact that Remus expected him to stay behind and play babysitter. But Hermione and Remus wouldn’t be swayed. They had made up their mind and nothing Harry or Draco said could change it. About an hour later Draco watched apprehensively from the window as the three of them went out to the front yard and disapparated from there.
"Well, we didn't. And they said…"
“Are we sure it is a Horcrux?” Draco wondered.
Once the door had closed behind them, he started stripping off his wet clothes. When he grabbed a fresh pair of pants, he noticed a long, thin package on his bed.
"Did Hermione really go to Slughorn's Christmas party with McLaggen?"
“You know this man vell?”
“Do you know what that means?” Draco asked.
Everyone was either looking at Harry or staring at their plate and a strange silence had settled over the group. Draco shifted uneasily in place, suddenly missing the inane chatter and loud noise from before.
As it turned out Remus needn’t have worried about waking anyone. When Harry had fought his way back through the bushes, Draco was just coming down the stairs. He’d woken up to find Harry missing and when he hadn’t returned after five minutes, the blond had gone looking for him. He was closely followed by Hermione, who had heard the stairs creaking and wondered who was creeping through the house in the dead of night. With a resigned sigh Remus sent her back upstairs to wake Ron.
The boy blushed, casting a quick look around. The library was deserted. Most Order members were spending the holidays at home with their families. Aside from Narcissa and Draco, who were currently upstairs, playing chess, only Remus had stayed, stating that Sirius was his family. Harry was happy that the two men had each other.
With shaking fingers Harry pointed his wand at the crate and it slid silently to the side. Shrugging off the cloak he approached the dying man, a trembling Draco at his side. When Snape caught sight of him, his eyes widened.
"What did you find out?" Hermione wanted to know.
"The most ridiculous rumours, too." Hermione added. "I overheard Michael Corner telling someone that you tried to kill each other."
“How...?” Harry stuttered, before he spied the invisibility cloak the blond was now draping over his arm. Harry's invisibility cloak.
"Follow me, everyone!" he shouted to the shocked Muggle-borns. "Go home, pack your families and run!"
Harry couldn't help but wonder if he'd even thought this through. What were his plans? Where would he go now? He felt a strange fear at the thought that they would part ways again in the morning. But they would have to. The Slytherin would probably go into hiding, while Harry still had a task to fulfil. Even if said task seemed all the more impossible now, without the help of his friends.
"I believe so."
“Longbottom?”
“Are you sure?”
The red-head grabbed a vial from his bedside table and held it out to him. “Pomfrey told me to give you this. Dreamless Sleep. She said you need to swallow the whole vial.”
"Umm.. well, most bonds can. But I've read about a few instances where that wasn't the case. Trying to break a bond can be dangerous. Life-threatening even. And… I haven't found any mention about a soul bond causing marks to appear on your skin." Hermione admitted reluctantly. "But… I'm sure I just haven't found the right book, yet. I'll keep looking." she promised.
“Cut the crap, Harry. It’s not getting any funnier.” Draco grumbled.
"I'm not drooling."
"And that's where Lavender comes in." Seamus announced gleefully.
I've also planned the last few chapters. There will be 22 total and probably an epilogue. So just a few more to go...
“That's not true. I trust you. Hermione and Ron too. And the others will come along. And even if they don't... It's their loss.” the dark-haired boy insisted.
Harry grinned. "No, I don't think that would go down too well."
"Because your stupid parents want you to marry her, I know. Because the Greengrasses need the money and the Malfoys need to be associated to a family that wasn't in league with the dark lord. Blabla politics. What I don't get is why you go along with it."
"Of course. So everything went well?"
“Have a little faith, will you? You’re Harry bloody Potter. I’m refusing to believe that your infamous luck has suddenly run out.”
Harry put the diadem down on the ground. Hermione gripped the fang tightly and shuffled closer. Draco held his breath as she raised it…
Harry turned in time to see Draco go into a spectacular dive. He gripped the rail in front of him tightly and held his breath as he watched the blond hurtling towards the ground at top speed. He pulled out of the dive at the last minute, raising back up in the air, the Snitch clutched tightly in his fist. The Slytherins (and assorted Gryffindors) broke into cheers.
“We’ve been trying to keep up on Potterwatch, but they didn’t give any details, either.” Terry Boot added.
It was one of those times when Harry had fled to his room, that Malfoy trudged in, cursing under his breath. The Gryffindor looked up just in time to see the blond removing his robes, which were stained with red and yellow splatters.
“I need your help.” Draco cut him off.
“You what?”
“We knew you weren't dead! You're all over the Prophet and the radio... They're looking for you everywhere. We would have heard it if you were dead.”
“I still don't understand why Dumbledore wants that memory.” Millicent broke the silence that had fallen over the group.
The blond pinched the bridge of his nose. “I appreciate your concern, Pans. Really.” he assured. Denying would get him nowhere, that much he knew. He had been in love with Harry ever since fifth year after all and Pansy knew it. “But I’m not going to pursue Harry.” He held up his hand to stop her protest. “If he really does have feelings for me, then I want him to realize it on his own. I don’t want to push him into something he’s not ready for.”
His only reply was another smile, a bit bigger this time. After that they didn't talk any more. It took Potter some time to fall asleep again, but Draco didn't mind. He leaned against the bedpost and watched him until his breathing evened out. Then he got up, cast a quick Reparo at the window and vanished the remains of the broken bottle, before slipping back into his own bed.
“Stop it. Both of you!” Harry demanded.
“Sorry. I guess sometimes I just let my insecurities get the better of me.”
“Which will be hard to get at.”
“Oh, I almost forgot. I've got a letter for you. From Hermione.”
Harry was pretty sure that getting attacked by a Venomous Tentacula wouldn't cheer him up, thank you very much. What would cheer him up was for his so-called friends to stop grating on his bloody nerves. But he could hardly say that, since he didn't want to hurt their feelings. So he tried avoiding them instead.
“But you've just done that.” he snapped.
Once they had gotten themselves under control, the blond sat up. “On a more serious note... You” he poked Harry in the ribs “were supposed to meet me on the seventh floor.”
“That’s not true! Draco cares. Don’t you, Draco?” Derek asked, giving the blond puppy dog eyes.
“Kreacher certainly can.”
“Hey, it's Harry Potter!”
He saw Trelawney up on the staircase, hurling crystal balls at the death eaters. The Weasley twins and their friend Lee Jordan slamming Yaxley to the ground. Remus and Sirius taking out Fenrir Greyback. Flitwick felling Dolohov. Ginny, Luna and Millicent were duelling Bellatrix, who cackled maniacally. Her killing curse shot so close by Ginny that she missed death by an inch.
The house-elves were happy to see them and quickly set a table in the corner, providing them with various foods. It felt strangely intimate, eating here in the kitchen, just the two of them (and the army of house-elves swarming around them) and Draco wished they could do this more often.
He could feel Draco tense, but still didn't look at him.
"Yeah, Helga Hufflepuff's cup. Dumbledore found out that he stole it from some old witch. He seems pretty obsessed with the founders of Hogwarts. The locket actually belonged to Slytherin. So I think he might have used something from Ravenclaw, too." Harry explained. "Why?"
After breakfast they lounged around outside, enjoying the sunshine and then spent some time playing two-a-side Quidditch in the backyard. In the afternoon they went to the Burrow. Thanks to all the security enchantments it was impossible to travel there by floo or apparition at the moment. So they took a portkey to a nearby field and walked the rest of the way. Despite the fact that Bill and Fleur’s wedding was scheduled for the next day, Mrs. Weasley had insisted on hosting a birthday dinner for Harry.
He spent the rest of the day racking his brain for ideas. Harry didn't seem to mind his silence. He didn't move from his bed and even skipped dinner, claiming he'd eaten at Hagrid's and wasn't hungry. Draco knew it was a lie. Harry had told him how inedible Hagrid's food was. But he didn't call him on his bullshit. Instead he sulked through dinner, doing his best to be nice to the little Slytherins who surrounded him. A few of the first years had gotten strangely fond of him by now.
He looked at the girl in surprise. “Does that mean the locket...?”
Harry’s breathing became deeper and more even. Draco felt the magic around them receding bit by bit, but kept up his litany of soothing words until even the last tendrils faded away. The younger boy looked exhausted and heartbroken, so he pulled him into a tight hug.
"Oh, well I…"
The next day, Harry was the last one in the changing room after the match. The others were most likely already partying up in the common room. He wondered briefly if they had even noticed his absence yet. Pulling on his jumper he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes with a heavy sigh.
“I wasn't asking for your input, Weasley. Shouldn't you get to class?” Snape sneered at him.
“You… really?”
“Yeah, I was surprised, too.” Draco agreed. “But I think Remus is right. It’s a good solution.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Exactly what I said.”
The blond swallowed hard and turned to leave, but Potter caught his arm and pulled him further into the shop instead, before rounding on the owner.
Yes, he needed to calm down. Harry needed him to be strong. And Remus needed him to explain what had happened.
“It's not easy.”
“Luna called me a stupid reckless Gryffindor?”
“People really need to learn to move on.” Harry grumbled.
“Oh, don’t give me that look.” she grumbled, rolling her eyes.
"Indeed, Mr. Malfoy. I am sure you have many questions. And I will try to answer them. But first I believe there is something you should see."
"You weren't in Hogsmeade last weekend." Luna pointed out.
"The bond will try to draw you together, because that is what all soul bonds were created to do. There might be some side effects if you're apart for a prolonged period of time. These can vary in intensity and usually range from a light feeling of anxiousness up to headaches, nausea and panic attacks." McGonagall explained.
"I've read a bit about bonds, but I don't know much. I'm going to the library. See if I can find out more." Hermione decided.
“Don’t even think about it, Potter.”
Somewhat reassured Harry allowed Draco to steer him up the stairs. There were people here, too. Mostly students, clad in pyjamas and dressing gowns, huddled together in small groups. They were whispering with each other and staring at Harry, but he was too exhausted to care right now.
Draco insisted on paying for all of them and true to his word gave a very large tip. He felt a lot better when they stepped outside again, where it had indeed began snowing now. After a quick trip to Honeydukes, Luna led them to the Treasure Trove, another new shop. The owner was a stout little witch in a garish pink and purple dress, which clashed horribly with her orange hat.
“Err… sure. I mean… it’s not like I have to take care of him or something. Right?”
“Somehow I can't believe that we made it out of that one.” Remus muttered.
"I'm sorry if Malfoy being here makes you uncomfortable, Dobby. You can just avoid him next time, okay?" Harry suggested.
“Exactly. I don't want that to happen. Especially not here, with other people around. Can you imagine what happens if the Prophet gets wind of it?”
Draco looked at Sirius. “You have a bad feeling, too?”
“I will.” Potter promised earnestly and Draco had to stifle his laughter.
The dark-haired boy hurried to Gryffindor tower, only taking the time to make sure he didn't run into anyone. Once safely in his dorm he reached for the two-way-mirror and contacted his godfather.
“Okay. I'll help you. I'll... contact some people.” he promised, jumping to his feet.
“Shush.” the blond whispered, claiming his boyfriend's lips in a kiss. Harry immediately stopped arguing and pulled him closer, deepening the kiss.
Their plotting was interrupted by Mrs. Weasley’s voice drifting up from the staircase.
He shook that thought off quickly. His father was still rotting in a cell in Azkaban. And if he was honest with himself, he felt that it served him right, for all the bad choices he'd made for himself and his family. Lucius had gotten them into this mess. Draco was making his own choices now, no matter if his father liked it or not.
“Or maybe another Death Eater.” Harry suggested.
“Lately, only those whom I could not save.”
“I have. I wasn't sure at first, but talking about everything really helps. And I started a diary.” Harry hesitated slightly, before adding: “I'm also working on my control. Draco's a great help with that.” Then he waited for their reaction, concentrating on his breathing like the blond had shown him. Just in case they reacted badly.
“Yeah, I… I just meant… You know, never mind.”
“I know.” the younger boy replied, sobering a little. “But that's still better than getting locked into a Gringotts vault or captured by angry goblins.” he pointed out, shifting a little. His fear of slipping off the dragon's back was diminishing a little. It wasn't comfortable by any means, but at least they were still free.
Hermione giggled and Ron complained that he had more to offer than only brute force. But Harry's eyes were drawn to Draco's. It was the look of absolute trust in those grey eyes that made him believe that everything would be alright in the end.
The other Slytherin regarded him curiously. “You’ve changed.”
“Be... because she...”
It was a scary thought and one that Harry didn't even want to consider. But Hermione nodded thoughtfully.
“If you know a way in, I suggest you tell us now.”
For a second he seemed about to snap back, but then he simply turned away from Harry's glare and sat rigidly, staring down at the table.
But the moment of triumph was brief. A giant came stumbling towards them, brandishing a huge club. Draco grabbed Harry's arm and dragged him out of harms way. The dark-haired boy glanced over his shoulder to see Ron and Hermione following them. Luna and the others however seemed to have re-joined the battle.
“Yeah, it was always complicated with Albus. I knew my brother. He learned secrecy at our mother’s knee. Secrets and lies… that’s how we grew up. And Albus was a natural…” The old man’s eyes travelled to a portrait of a girl over the mantlepiece.  It was the only picture in the room. “Forget my brother and his clever schemes. People had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans.”
“And now?”
"Yes, thank you Pansy. I already knew that. And I've been very polite."
Tonks cackled maniacally and Remus felt goosebumps rising on his skin. If he didn't know better he'd really believe it was Bellatrix Lestrange standing there.
It turned out to be the right decision. Of course Sirius agreed to help and get the rest of the Order on board. He didn't ask too many questions, at least once Harry promised to tell him everything during the Christmas holidays.
He put the teacup down with a frown. “I thought the whole point of this was to make me talk about the .. the difficult stuff.”
“Just trying to find a compartment.” he said quietly.
He didn't like the way she smiled at that. "Yes, I figured. Since he's suddenly Draco and no longer Malfoy."
“What happened?!” Harry asked.
“Hmm… but I … I can’t. The bloody Prophet would have a field day.”
“But you just said..”
“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine.”
“Not usually, but it might be now.” Malfoy mused.
Draco smiled a little at her description of his boyfriend. Brave but not very smart? Yes, that about summed it up.
“But she has the best tea.” Daphne claimed.
“Shit. I hope Harry has more luck.”
“True. But I think I'll stay out of this one. It's much more fun to watch your mounting frustration while she plays cock-block without even realizing.” Blaise said with a chuckle.
Draco grabbed Harry’s arm, ready to apparate them out of there, but there was no need. Sirius shouted. “We didn’t kill you!” and the figure exploded in a cloud of dust. Of course the ruckus woke up the portrait of Sirius’ mother. The curtains flew open and she started shrieking. Remus quickly shot a spell at her. With a bang the curtains closed again and the hall fell silent.
“Where are you going?”
Harry took a deep breath, calming down a little. “Okay. And Sirius and Remus are going to head back there as well, right?” he checked.
They all echoed Remus’ words, before disapparating in pairs. Harry looked around as soon as he landed. Draco’s aim had been perfect. They were standing in the backyard he remembered from his vision, right next to the old gardener’s hut. Hermione and Ron joined them seconds later. It was early afternoon, but the sun was already low in the sky. Harry shivered in the cold February air as he took in his surroundings.
Deep down he knew that he wasn't being fair. They had helped him so much. They had risked their lives and put up with his dark mood for a long time. With the futility of their quest. He couldn't blame his two best friends for giving in to despair, when he himself had given up as well.
Draco blinked, obviously trying to process that fact. “At first I thought he was going to warn me to keep my hands off you. But then he asked me about... and then he told me all those … things.”
Draco makes his first appearance in this chapter. It's still from Harry's POV, but I think the next one will be from Draco's.
“Okay.”
“Yes, it was.” Draco confirmed.
“You've still got Longbottom and the rest of your Gryffindor gang.” the blond reminded.
He knew that he should go down to the dungeons, try to get some sleep. It was most likely already past curfew and he was planning on coming back to the room of hidden things in the morning. But his feet refused to move. He felt ready to drop where he stood. With a weary sigh he sat down on the floor, his back to the wall. Harry watched him closely.
The elf looked up at him with his large eyes. "Oh no, Harry Potter, sir. Dobby does not mind seeing the young master. Young master has always been kind to Dobby, sir."
“You won't if you ward your belongings. I can show you how. I did it with mine.”
"Why do you feel the need to tell everyone?"
“You are impossible.” Draco claimed, once his giggles had subsided.
“Don't let me stop you then.” the dark-haired boy murmured. Seconds later he found himself pressed back against the wall, while Draco proceeded to snog him senseless.
"Saving me was very brave."
"Are you a stray? You look like a stray." Harry would have bristled at the statement, sure that he didn't look that bad, even if he was a little dirty, but he was too busy eating.
The fiercely protective tone made Harry smile. He pulled back slightly to look at the blond.
“A pawn in his game.” Sirius finished Harry’s sentence with a low growl. “That fucking prick! He’s lucky he’s already dead. I’d strangle him myself if he wasn’t!”
“It would certainly save us a lot of trouble.” Remus agreed.
“What do you mean?” Sirius wanted to know.
They emerged in a large, brightly lit room. Harry saw coloured hangings, lamps and many faces, staring at them in astonishment. Several people yelled and seconds later they were surrounded by a crowd of students.
“I guess we can all agree that this trip was a waste of time, right?” Draco tried to end the discussion.
“I know I should have said it sooner, but … thank you. For speaking up for us at the trials. I know what you did for mother. And for me. And... thanks for returning my wand.”
The animagus looked up at him in shock. “Harry?”
This coaxed a laugh from the Slytherin. Harry smiled. He liked hearing that laugh. Malfoy was usually way too serious. He looked so much more approachable when he was smiling or laughing. More human and less … formal.
Harry glanced at Draco for a second, just long enough to make sure he meant it, before focusing on his chest. It was a nice chest. Not overly muscular, but not too skinny either. And Draco’s skin was just so pale and perfect. He bent down and started trailing kisses all over that pale skin, starting at Draco’s clavicle and working his way down. Draco was quiet aside from a few gasps and shuddered moans. He tasted of sweat and soap and something else Harry couldn’t name. He thought if he was to drink Amortentia it would probably taste like this.
“What does master Harry want Kreacher to do?”
“Expelliarmus!”
When Draco came to, he was lying on a soft mattress and someone was yelling nearby. He opened his eyes slowly, taking in his surroundings. It took him only a second to realize that he was in the hospital wing. The curtains around his bed were drawn and Millie was sitting in a chair at his bedside. And somewhere outside Harry was yelling at someone at the top of his lungs.
“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged.”
"But I think we should get out of here." His back and buttocks were starting to hurt from sitting awkwardly on the cold tiles for so long. Draco tensed and Harry knew instinctively what he was thinking. "Don't worry. I'll make sure we don't run into anyone." he assured. "But we need to talk and I'd like to do it somewhere more comfortable."
“You got flowers.” Derek stated the obvious.
They hurried up to the castle to find professor McGonagall already waiting for them. Obviously Hagrid had told her that they'd witnessed the whole thing. Harry showed her the necklace and she told Filch to take it to Snape. Then she ushered the six students up to her office.
“Yeah, me too. Guess I'll … head home then.” Potter mumbled.
“Good. And Ron’s mum hasn’t been let in on the location, right?”
“Of course it’s not here.” Harry said, a little harsher than intended. He just couldn’t help it.
“Sure you are.”
“Morning.”
Draco’s cheeks took on a rosy hue as well. But he didn't break eye-contact. “I guess I might let you.”
“It's okay. Really. We were never all that close to begin with. At least Daphne and I weren't. And I don't mind being on my own. It's not like I ever had a lot of friends.”
The Gryffindor was starting to wonder if he'd somehow given himself away. If maybe Malfoy knew that he was there, waiting for him. The blond knew about his cloak, after all. But even if he realized that Harry was there, he couldn't know where exactly. So Harry decided that he just had to wait. Sooner or later Malfoy would slip. He would let his guard down long enough for the Gryffindor to make a move. It was only a matter of time.
"What? No, she went with Draco." Harry let him know, surprised at the sudden change of topic.
“But...”
Harry didn't really know how it happened. One second he was trying to defend himself against Ginny's hurtful accusations and the next something inside of him snapped. Only when the ginger haired girl stumbled back a few steps, her eyes wide in fear, did he notice the dark waves of magic pulsing all around himself. It felt like his magic was alive, coiling around him like a snake, ready to strike. And the worst thing was that he had no control over it.
“I really don't envy him. Or you, for that matter.” Millicent commented.
“Yes, it’s perfect. There’s lots of room, no breakable objects… Just what we need.” the blond agreed.
“What now?” he snapped.
“Harry, what did you do? What did you do? Come on, tell me. Tell me.”
Time seemed to accelerate as Christmas drew nearer. The grounds were covered in a thick blanket of snow, which prevented most outdoor activities. The load of homework increased and some teachers tried to cram as many exams as possible into the last weeks of the year, which meant even more studying.
"And not even the worst of it. Because to create a Horcrux a wizard first has to deliberately commit murder. This act, said to be one of supreme evil, would result in the murderer metaphysically damaging their own soul. That damage would then be used by casting a spell, which would rip the damaged portion of the soul and encase it in an object."
The moment of peace was broken when the Slytherin woke up and the awkwardness of their position set in. They quickly pulled apart, unable to even look at each other.
“But what if … what if I hurt you?”
The blond looked surprised by the offer. "That's… thank you."
Her warning delivered she went to fetch Hermione, Pansy, Ron, Crabbe and Goyle, who crowded around the beds with varying expressions of relief.
Draco nodded, taking deep breath to calm himself. She was right. Harry needed him. He couldn't collapse right now. He nodded and allowed Hermione to drag him towards the castle.
Harry froze. He stared at Sirius, who was only a couple of rows down from where they were standing. Draco put a hand on his shoulder, trying to offer comfort. Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Harry grabbed his hand and together they walked over.
He'd been allowed to spend most of the summer at Grimmauld Place after that, which had been a relief. Not only because it meant getting away from the Dursleys, but also because of the nightmares, which were getting more and more frequent and revolved mostly around Sirius dying for a few weeks. Harry had been glad to find his godfather at his bedside when he woke up from those nightmares, very much alive and ready to offer comfort.
“I'm glad you allowed me to tag along today. I had fun.”
Draco picked up his wand and stumbled to his feet. He jumped in shock when someone grabbed his arm to steady him, but relaxed when he recognized Ron.
“Either that or they'd take it as proof that they've always been right and I'm completely barmy.”
“Unless I tell you.”
“Was that Harry Potter?”
“It's okay. You had a nightmare. You're safe.”
"You should take Harry out tomorrow. It would cheer him up."
Next to him Harry sniffled.
Once the cuts on Ron’s face and arms had been healed, he carried Hermione upstairs. Remus turned to his attention to Harry and Draco. They had both sustained a few cuts as well, but nothing serious. Harry still winced when the dittany was applied to his split lip.
Judging by the whispers of the people gathered around them, others had noticed the Slytherin as well.
After dinner they gathered in the living room, like they did most days. Hermione had her nose buried in a book, Sirius (wearing the locket) walked around aimlessly, muttering under his breath and Remus and Ron were playing wizards chess, while Harry and Draco watched. All of a sudden the silence was broken by a loud crack. They all jumped to their feet, wands at the ready. Draco’s heart was hammering as he looked around frantically, trying to spot the intruder. When his eyes fell on the small elf he sagged with relief.
But it was already too late. As soon as Harry had spoken the name, there were cracks of apparition all around them. Draco heard Hermione yelling something that sounded like a jinx and raised his own wand, only to realize that it was no use. They were surrounded by hulking figures and heavily outnumbered. He counted at least seven people. It was too dark to make out more than their silhouettes. His heart sank.
The blond got up and started the kettle for more tea, while Harry looked through the pantry for something edible. He found a couple of eggs and some bread and quickly got a pan out, all the while stealing glances at Draco when he wasn't looking. The eggs were okay, but the bread was old and hard. It said a lot about their situation that Draco ate without complaint.
“He's right about that, you know?” a dreamy voice chimed in.
“Hold tight!”
“Let me get this straight: You've been trying out handwritten spells, without knowing what they did?” Draco asked sharply.
“I know.”
“Draco! What … what are you doing here?”
“Why should I?” Seamus asked challengingly.
“You're going to kill all of your friends, huh?” Harry asked with a smile.
"Draco."
Hermione was the first to comply. The three boys followed her lead. The figures came closer. Draco saw someone snatching up their wands, while another guy pointed a lit wand at them. He heard Hermione stammering out a fake name and couldn’t hold back a gasp when he got a good look at Harry’s face. It was shiny-pink, puffy and so swollen that his features looked completely distorted. He remembered Hermione’s shout earlier and realized that she hadn’t been trying to defend them. She had hit Harry with a stinging hex, so he wouldn’t be as easily recognizable. He admired her quick thinking. Hopefully it would buy them enough time to get out of this.
“He will. Hermione is helping him research. They won’t rest until they’ve found a way.”
“No. Don’t bother them. I can always tell them tomorrow.”
Harry seemed unable to find words.
Hope you all had a nice Christmas. And I wish you all the best for 2020.
“Are you decent?”
Harry did his best to trample down the irrational surge of jealousy he felt whenever Draco mentioned Parkinson. He knew that the blond missed her and he really wanted to be happy that they'd get to see each other again. He didn't even know why the thought of the Slytherin girl infuriated him so. It wasn't like he had to compete with her or something. He and Draco were friends as well. Close friends even.
“What are you...” Harry tried.
“I don't want to sleep.” the dark-haired boy clarified.
“She wasn’t exactly thrilled when I told her. But I think she’s coming round.” Malfoy claimed.
Hermione was openly crying now. Ron stared at his best friend in shock. “But Harry… maybe…”
“Of course it is.” Draco assured.
“Can I see it?”
“What's that supposed to mean?” Harry wanted to know, squirming away from Lavender to look at her girlfriend.
Draco just sighed. So much for peace and quiet. On the other hand, the Ravenclaw might actually be the most helpful of his friends. At least in this situation.
“Are you still sure you'll be okay in Slytherin? You share a dorm room with Nott, right?” Harry asked worriedly.
Draco snorted. "You're mentally scarred? What about us? We have to endure you snogging Lavender all the time."
So far no-one had approached the Slytherin openly or even asked him what was really going on, though Blaise kept giving him speculative glances. He didn't know if Potter had been questioned by his friends, but he doubted it. There had been no outbursts of magic and even though Potter was getting better at controlling his powers, the blond doubted that a talk like that would go down too well with the Gryffindor.
Then he slipped out of the room without looking back.
“He gave you the Talk?” Harry asked, once understanding dawned. “You know, the sex talk.” he elaborated, when the older boy just looked at him blankly.
He looked at Harry as if daring him to argue. But the younger boy was actually glad for the support. It meant that Draco had forgiven him yet again, even though he probably didn’t deserve it.
"You're both very perceptive." he cut in, hoping to stop them from getting into another fight. Those two were always bickering it seemed. His tactic worked and they both beamed at him, before starting a discussion about their latest charms homework. Draco used the opportunity to sneak off, though he was sure that Alice noticed. She really was a perceptive little thing, he had to give her that.
“Run?” the Slytherin squeaked.
“We’re a few miles away from Fern Cottage. I didn’t want to apparate too close to the wards.”
“For me too.” Draco admitted. “It felt like… like I was dying.”
“No, but... at least yours don't make your magic whack out. You know, back at Grimmauld Place I slept in a room with nothing but a bed in it. And when I woke up from a nightmare, there were cracks in the walls and the bed covers were ripped. I just... I don't want to accidentally destroy all our stuff.”
“Aren't you usually all for being prepared?”
Harry felt a plan beginning to form. If they could rescue Draco's mother, then maybe he could get the blond to switch sides. It was clear that Draco didn't want to work for Voldemort. He had been forced into his service. And he had asked Harry to help him.
“He's not infallible.”
“Everyone here? Everyone safe?” Remus checked.
"Does that mean you don't intend to keep the fleabag?" Zabini asked hopefully.
“Harry…”
“You know what he's done, though, don't you?” he asked, looking at Potter.
He was starting to think that the worst was over. He was obviously getting used to his new strength, so there would be no more outbursts. At least that was what he was telling himself. Until he was proven wrong yet again.
The two armies clashed in the middle of the courtyard. Curses and hexes were flying everywhere. Some people fought with their bare hands. Just as Draco thought it couldn’t get any more chaotic, giants joined the fray, their thundering footsteps shaking the floor. Thestrals and even a few Hippogriffs were soaring overhead, attacking the giants, trying to claw at their eyes. Slowly the fighters were forced back into Hogwarts, where the battle raged on just as fiercely. An army of house elves joined the fight, led by Dobby, wielding kitchen knives and other strange utensils. All around the death eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers.
“I got into it with the Carrows. The two death eaters, who teach at the school. They’re also in charge of the punishment and they don’t like it when we mouth off.”
“Pretty sure, yeah.”
“It was funny.” Draco came to her aid.
“You know Hermione. It’s never just a bit of background knowledge with her. You ask her a simple question and get a lecture in response. Isn’t it enough if we know the basics of the ritual? I mean, we already know what it does and I’m sure Remus is going to tell us what to do.”
The news seemed to cheer Ron up. "You're sure?"
Harry seemed to freeze for a moment, only to spring into action a second later. He nearly ran towards the ruin. Sirius and Draco had trouble keeping up. And then they were standing right in front of the broken down building.
He struggled to his feet and shuffled to the door, opening it only wide enough to slip through. Judging by Hermione's shocked gasp, she still managed to get a look into the destroyed room.
He could hear footsteps thundering past, so he stayed where he was and waited, holding his breath. When everything was silent again he crawled out of his hiding place. He still couldn't see a thing, so he groped along the wall, until he reached a junction and emerged into another corridor, this one thankfully lit and completely empty.
“I did.”
Meanwhile Draco was sitting in the library with Luna. He'd just wanted some peace and quiet and he couldn't get that in the Slytherin common room. As weird as it was, he hated fighting with Harry now that they were together, but he also wasn't ready to back down and apologize. And to top it off, Millicent and Blaise had started giving him helpful relationship advice (like he'd take advice from them!).
“A house elf stopped by earlier to bring you a change of clothes. He said Blaise sent him.” Ron let the Slytherin know.
“Very good. Rest now. You’ll be fine.”
“Bit of an overkill, Harry.” Draco commented drily.
“Are you okay with this?” the younger boy suddenly asked, sitting up again. “I guess you were hoping you'd get to share a room with Zabini. And now you're stuck with me.”
“Okay. When do you want to start?” the Slytherin asked, a little surprised that Harry had agreed so readily. He’d expected more of a fight. But the younger boy actually seemed eager to try.
And he was right in so many ways.
“Snogging. Yes, unfortunately we know. We have to watch it.” Draco grumbled.
“Minerva, he's been through enough for one night!” Sirius protested.
Hermione looked up when they entered and immediately ran over to hug Harry. “It's Bill. Greyback attacked him.” she explained when she noticed him looking at the injured red-head. “Madam Pomfrey said he'll survive, but his wounds will probably never fully heal. And Remus thinks he might have some wolfish characteristics from now on. But since Greyback hadn't turned when he bit him, he won't be a full werewolf.”
“That… yes…”
"But… where will Mipsy go?" the elf asked in a frightened voice.
"I'm actually here to congratulate you on your win."
As always thanks for the lovely comments.
They had both shied away from taking things much further than that night in the room of requirement, still a little unsure of themselves and also afraid of being caught in the act. Back at Grimmauld Place there had always been the fear that Sirius or someone else might barge in. And now back at Hogwarts it was hard to find a quiet place where no-one would disturb them. Peeves seemed to have realized that they were hiding something and was determined to catch them at it. They also hadn't really talked about it again, after that one, awkward conversation following their first night together.
“Are you sure it’s a good idea to leave him alone with her?” he asked.
“Yeah. She might realize it’s gone.”
“Put the cloak on.” Hermione hissed from somewhere behind him and he struggled to comply. Then he crawled forward, until the reached the opening at the end of the tunnel. It was blocked by some kind of crate, so he crouched down and peered through.
“I want to thank you again for making this possible for me.”
"Should I feel honoured or offended that you compare me to your girlfriend?"
“Sorry.” God, he was so bad at interacting with girls. Which prompted another thought. Was she here to ask him out?
Harry sighed softly and flopped down onto the blanket, pulling Draco down beside him. He felt slightly overwhelmed and sought the blond's comforting presence without really thinking about it. His friends looked at him with matching frowns, but they kept silent and sat down as well. Harry couldn't help but notice that they were both still clutching their wands. This was going to be harder than he'd thought.
The blond nodded. He had already known that.
“Here, that's dittany.” Draco explained, handing him a small flask, after applying some to the burns on his face and arms.
“Look at me, Potter! It's okay. Just breathe. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Come on, Potter. Breathe with me. In … and out. Just like that.”
“So.. you only miss her, then? What about the others? Goyle or...”
Draco gave a jerky shake of his head. He was wide-eyed and ghostly pale. "No. Upstairs is… it's worse. I thought… maybe the kitchen?"
“Yes and no. It's only part of the reason for your outbursts. The other, bigger part is the fact that you're obviously suffering from a severe trauma. Which is very understandable in your situation. Your powers however, react to your inner turmoil. So when you're highly emotional, especially when you're angry I suppose, your magic surges. It becomes an outlet for your anger.”
Maybe it was the use of his first name, or maybe it was the look in Harry's eyes, but the blond finally gave in, starting to recite the poem, getting surer with each word:
The morning dawned cold and grey. After a small breakfast, Draco pulled on his outfit. He had found some old robes in one of the houses and transfigured them into something his father might wear.
“Come on. It's over there.” Draco's voice startled him out of his observations.
“We should go to Hogsmeade tomorrow. Get some Christmas shopping done, before the rush sets in.” Draco mused.
He had no idea how long they sat like this, until Potter pulled back, mumbling a meek: “Sorry.”
“Excuse me?”
But then the real Reg Cattermole showed up, seconds before Yaxley arrived on the scene. Harry punched the guy trying to seal off the fireplace and Sirius started firing curses. There was a lot of shouting, screaming and spells flying around. Draco had no idea how they did it, but somehow they all managed to make it into the fireplace, emerging back in the public toilet, with Yaxley hot on their heels. Someone grabbed Draco's arm, he saw Sirius wrestling with Yaxley and then they vanished into crushing darkness.
“You know I'd never...”
“Do you think she's going to try something again?” Draco asked doubtfully, following Harry to the room of requirement.
“Why? Are you such a horrible room-mate?”
“He attacked me. What was I supposed  to do?”
They slowly got up and started treating their injuries. Luckily the Slytherin had remembered to pack some healing potions and salve.
“We're sorry, too.” Hermione hurried to assure.
“Are we still doing DA meetings this year, Harry?” Luna chimed in again.
“Ron complained in his last letter that you spend all of your time studying.” Harry addressed her again. For a moment it had seemed like they’d forgotten she was still there.
“Really, Mr. McLaggen... It can't hurt that bad any more. That pain relieving potion I gave you must already be kicking in. And the sleeping draught should start working any minute now. Or do you need a higher dose?”
“You can say that again. I nearly hexed him on sight!” Sirius growled.
They walked in silence for long minutes. It felt awkward, having to stay so close together because of the handcuffs. Every once in a while their arms or hands would brush and the small contact sent shivers down Harry's spine. He didn't want to think too closely about that reaction.
When the younger boy said yes, he quickly shook his head. “No. No way. That's a bad idea, Harry.”
"You have to admit to a certain irony." the werewolf said.
“We shared a compartment with him on the train. He was nice to me and he even chatted with Luna.” Neville added shyly. This caused quite a few whispers. Most people knew Loony Lovegood and steered clear of her.
Thanks for all the lovely and encouraging comments.
But Daphne ignored him. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’ll help you.” she promised, patting his hand.
“Also true.”
“Come on, give me some credit. After all that you've been through, you're sleeping like a baby? Didn't take a genius to figure out why.”
The blond rolled his eyes. “Harry, Andromeda said you can buy him one for Christmas. That's still almost a year away.” he pointed out.
“Have you finally read it then?”
“I thought about it. We both did.” Hermione assured. “And at first it sounded like a good idea... But it's like Ron said and … now that most of the remaining Death Eaters have been caught, I can restore my parent's memories. So I'm going to Australia next month and … Ron is going to come with me.”
“I say we’ve got nothing to lose.” was what Sirius finally settled on.
“But she’s completely devoted to him.” Draco reminded.
He kept up a litany of soothing words until the Slytherin finally calmed down and his erratic breathing evened out. Harry sighed in relief, but didn’t dare loosen his hold just yet. He knew that he should return to his own bed soon, but he didn’t want Draco to slip back into the nightmare. There was no harm in staying like this a little longer, he reasoned. And also no harm in closing his eyes for a moment…
"I'm glad to see you too, prongslet." Sirius said bemusedly, returning the fierce hug for a moment.
Dobby appeared out of nowhere and started cleaning up.
Blaise on the other hand launched into another tirade about clingy girls and told Ron he was doing it all wrong. “You need to set boundaries. She's going to think she owns you, if you let her get away with it.”
“Why? I thought you were still quite happy with your firebolt.”
“I'm bringing tea.” the werewolf announced, entering the room and putting the tray down next to the bed. “And I've come to apologize for Sirius. He means well, but he can be a little … over-enthusiastic. Just ignore him.” he advised, looking at Draco apologetically.
"Shit. He's not going to like that. Especially since Remus was in on it with you." Harry muttered.
Harry hesitated. “Because I feel like I'm intruding on their happiness.” he finally confessed. “Sometimes I get the feeling that wherever I look lately, all I see are happy couples. It makes me feel...”
“I’ll talk to Moony. See if we need additional security.” Sirius promised. “But that’s probably going to take some time. I suggest you use that time to make up with your boyfriend.” His tone clearly said that it was no suggestion.
“And Pansy. And Daphne, too.”
Most noticeable was the fact that he didn't sit with his usual group of friends any longer. Okay, Longbottom still remained faithfully at his side during most meals. Finnegan and Thomas however sat far away from him. And so did the Weasley girl. Draco noticed that she was actively avoiding Potter ever since they'd come back to Hogwarts. She wasn't exactly subtle about it. He wondered what had happened between them, but didn't dare ask.
“She stole Bellatrix' key.” he muttered, disbelief colouring his voice.
Draco could hear the pride in those words and it surprised him. He’d never heard Daphne gushing like this. About anyone. The thought must’ve shown on his face, because she blushed, but met his eyes defiantly.
“We've been over that a dozen times.” the animagus nearly whined.
“More than just a moment, I hope.” the red-head added.
“A bit? Not much, to be honest. That stuff was more Hermione’s thing.”
Potter chuckled and the blond found himself relaxing, grinning along. He hadn't managed to become Potter's friend back when they'd been eleven, but maybe they could really start over. Maybe they could become friends now.
It felt strange to sleep alone, after sharing a bed with Harry during the holidays, but Draco slowly got used to it again. The coins he'd made for them helped a lot. They at least enabled him to communicate with Harry, while they were both lying in separate beds, in different parts of the castle.
Hermione gave him an unimpressed look. “We'll think of something. But no-one is forcing you to help. You can go back to your dorm if you like.”
Draco sat up slowly, only now realizing that he was lying in his bed. Next to him Harry was still asleep. Someone must have brought them up to their room after the ritual. And speaking of…
Harry kicked off his shoes and took off his jeans, before putting on the pyjama bottoms and t-shirt Draco handed him.
“Two years ago, when we were cleaning out the drawing room, we found a big gold locket. And we threw it out. Did you steal it back?”
“Did you see where it's hidden? Or what it even is?” Draco asked.
“Plan?”
November turned into December, Christmas was approaching fast and Harry suddenly wished himself back to the days when all he'd had to worry about were exams and making it through another school year without getting killed. He had really thought his life had been difficult back then. And yet it was nothing compared to what he was going through now.
"Oh really? And how did you figure that out? If you can't imagine how I feel?" the Gryffindor spat.
Sirius cursed under his breath and quickly sent his Patronus to alert McGonagall and Flitwick.
“Hey, Sirius said he talked to you about something.” the younger boy stated.
“More?”
“What's so scary about Nott?” Harry wondered aloud. He barely remembered the lanky, mousey-haired boy, who mostly faded into the background.
"Sure you're not."
Draco was surprised to find her glaring at the other three house tables as she said this. But maybe he shouldn't have been. He'd seen the dark looks directed at Slytherin.
Catching Harry's no-doubt dark look, she quickly abandoned that train of thought and went on: " Most bonds need to be sealed to take full effect. That usually happens with the kiss at the end of the ceremony or… you know, with the … wedding night." She blushed and Harry felt his own face heating. Yes, McGonagall had already told him.
“And how did that happen?”
“Guess not. Unless Ron managed to convince Finnegan to keep his mouth shut.”
“Same thing, practically.”
Neville opened the door again. Harry and Luna slipped out first, quickly followed by Draco, Blaise and Ginny. They found themselves in a long tunnel. What felt like hundreds of steps led steadily downward, finally ending in front of yet another door. They stepped out into a deserted corridor and Draco activated the map, looking for their dots to find out where exactly they'd come out.
Harry felt a lot better after the talk with the two men. And he knew that his godfather was right. He needed to talk to Draco. He hated fighting with his friends. And fighting with his boyfriend was even worse. They had done enough of that in the past. Of course they still bickered and argued pretty often. They would never change so much that they could agree on everything. But this was different. It was their first, real fight since they'd gotten together.
“No, Harry. We’ll stay and help.” Luna argued. Dean nodded.
The calm tone of his voice surprisingly helped to calm Harry's temper as well. He concentrated on his breathing for a moment and his magic settled.
"So you've finally worked things out with Draco then?" Hermione joined the discussion.
Harry was momentarily distracted by Seamus and Dean, who asked him about the stupid stuff the Daily Prophet had written about him this time. When he finally looked over at the Slytherin table, he found Draco sitting between Zabini and Millicent Bulstrode. The blond gave him a reassuring smile and Harry smiled back.
“You have no idea. Saturday was Neville's stag night. You wouldn't believe the amount of trouble the boys have gotten into. And of course I was the one who had to clean up after them.”
“They’ve shacked up while you were gone.” Millicent explained.
He had no idea what to do. The bond and those little snippets of feeling he got from Draco didn't make it any easier. Remembering how it had felt to hold the blond he couldn't help but wonder if it was simply the bond demanding physical contact or if the desire to touch Draco was all himself.
“Did she also tell you where he hid it?”
“So? Do I get an answer?”
As plans went, it wasn't the worst. And they actually pulled it off without a hitch. Amidst the chaos the decoy detonator had created, no-one noticed Harry entering Umbridge's office. Sirius waited a couple of seconds, before making his grand entrance. He bellowed orders at Draco and started interrogating the confused people.
“You said the wolf and the mutt are alerting McGonagall. I take it you’re planning to secure the castle to keep the dark lord out as long as possible?”
After introducing the new teachers (for DADA, Muggle Studies and Transfiguration, since McGonagall would only teach the eighth years this year) warning students to stay away from the forbidden forest and informing them about the list of banned objects, she asked the eighth years to remain behind after the feast. Her speech delivered, she finally sat back down and the feast began.
Draco could see the sliver of fear in his expressive green eyes and laid a cautious hand on his arm.
“Potter! You're here.. What? How?” McGonagall whispered in shock.
“You should have seen him. He was brilliant. The other guys didn't stand a chance.” Millie gushed and Harry grinned at Draco's blush.
"We sealed it. I don't think it can be broken." Draco murmured, glancing at him. "And even if it could, they couldn't force us to break it."
The confused Muggle-borns followed them willingly as they quickly made their way back up towards the exit. They made it to the Atrium unhindered, but once they stepped out of the lifts, all hell broke loose. Someone had obviously raised the alarm. Whether it had been Umbridge, Yaxley or one of the people they'd left unconscious in the old theatre they had no way of knowing. Fact was that a couple of people were already sealing off the fireplaces - their only means of escape.
(See the end of the chapter for
Remus sighed tiredly. “Padfoot…”
Only to be interrupted again: “Sorry to disappoint you, oh Chosen One. But I'm not going to be your dirty little secret.”
There was a thump from somewhere inside, accompanied by laughter. She frowned, wondering if it would be better to come back later, but then Harry’s voice called out: “Come in!”
“Dead serious. Come on, climb up.”
“You know, I've never... I mean... I snogged Pansy. Mostly because she threw herself at me and to keep up appearances. But... it never went … past that.” Draco admitted, breaking the uncomfortable silence that had fallen between them. He looked apprehensive and kept his eyes fixed on the floor, as if waiting for Harry to make fun of his inexperience.
“By Daphne and Lavender. But what about me?”
“Because he warned Snape that we might come.”
While Harry had his own doubts about Dumbledore and Sirius had had his fair share of disagreements with the old man, they both hated Snape. They wouldn’t believe that he was the victim in this scenario. Ron and Hermione had always adored Dumbledore and would never believe him capable of something as evil as blackmail. Maybe he could discuss his theory with Remus, who was usually the most level-headed of the group.
"I do. But I shouldn't take it out on my friends."
He went back towards the common room and Hermione entered her room. It was surprisingly big, with a four-poster-bed in Gryffindor colours dominating the centre. She dropped her bag onto the bed and considered unpacking, but her curiosity got the better of her. So she left the room again and went down the other corridor, knocking on Harry’s door after a slight hesitation.
Sorry you had to wait so long for this update. And it's only a short chapter this time. Next (and last) one should be longer. I'll try to get it done by next Weekend.
Harry turned his head to see Draco standing there, his wand pointed at his former friends.
“To shag you.”
“I know. I already said I’m not mad.”
Draco knew that he was doomed. Just like his parents. Even as he struggled to fulfil at least one of the tasks given to him, he knew deep down that he would fail. That he was expected to fail. It was only a matter of time until the dark lord decided that he'd had enough of torturing Draco and his family. Only a matter of time until Draco would be forced to watch his mother die, before being killed himself. Part of him just wanted it to be over already, while another part urged him to fight. His inner struggle was as tiring as the sleepless nights and the constant fear that haunted his every step.
“It never came up? The letters arrived weeks ago.” he reminded, getting angry. “We've been talking about Hogwarts nearly every time we met. Or at least I have.” Now that he thought about it, he realized that his two best friends had been rather quiet the last couple of times he'd mentioned the school.
"I will. I promise."
“Good to see you, prongslet.” Sirius said with a grin, giving Harry a quick hug, before turning to Draco. “And you too, little dragon.” The blond grimaced at the nickname and accepted his hug rather stiffly. Harry grinned at him. Remus just shook his head at his boyfriend's antics and gave the two boys a quick hug as well.
Rookwood pushed him roughly back down and Harry made no move to get up again. He simply lay there, his face pressed against the cool stone, hoping it would all be over soon. He didn't even react when the tall man nudged him in the ribs rather forcefully with his shoe.
Ron couldn't believe that Harry had chosen Luna of all people, but Draco approved. And Harry was very happy about his choice when Luna started repeating her father's weird conspiracy theories regarding the Ministry. At least he could always count on her to make things interesting and get people's attention away from him.
“Exactly, you didn't. Maybe next time you'll actually think first, before attacking my friends.”
“It's already past curfew.” the older boy murmured.
The use of his given name finally did the trick. His eyes snapped open and he jerked upright, panting like he'd run a marathon. His eyes darted around in fright.
People ran to the entrance doors then and Draco was pushed along. McGonagall's anguished scream made him flinch. Seeing the usually stoic professor lose her composure like that was frightening. But it was nothing compared to what he saw when he finally went out through the doors. Harry was lying limply in Hagrid's arms.
"Would you be so kind to leave? You're interrupting..."
Harry wanted to grin, but suddenly soft lips were touching his, gentle but insisted and he found himself kissing back automatically. It was so different from the kisses he'd shared with Cho. Malfoy wasn't crying for one thing, which was a relief. And he seemed to know exactly what he was doing. Harry found himself swaying closer and sighed when one of the blond's arms encircled his waist, while his free hand carded through the dark strands of his hair.
“Ron, that man is completely insane!”
Ginny snorted and crawled onto the bed as well. Despite the things his boyfriend had told him, Harry was still surprised when she settled down next to Draco, like it was the most normal thing to do. At least he wasn't the only one surprised. Ron looked positively shocked.
“Shit! Sirius, we need to get out of here! Now!” he yelled, pulling Harry into his arms.
“Mipsy needs to go back." the elf squeaked.
“There are many more similarities, but we can talk about those another time. Right now I need to get going. But it was fun talking to you, Harry. See you around.”
Remus noticed the kitchen clock with a frown. Harry and Draco should have been down for tea ages ago. Which probably meant that it was time for more damage control. Ignoring his still pouting boyfriend he grabbed two mugs of tea and a plate with biscuits, placed them on a tray and went upstairs.
“Well, I don't like it either. But it's our best bet.” Harry reasoned.
Harry went to stand beside Sirius. “He’s right. You-know-who is on his way here. We know a way to defeat him, once and for all. But in order to do that, we need to find something. Something that’s hidden here at Hogwarts. It probably belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone ever seen something with her eagle on it, maybe? Or do you know of anything that used to belong to her?”
“You’re welcome.”
“Because Dumbledore had asked him to do it.”
“How can you be so sure?”
“Don't worry, guys. Draco broke with his father and joined our side. We're friends now.”
“It has to be. Who would kidnap us if not a wizard?”
“Okay.”
“Something I don't want to hear?” Ron asked carefully.
“I really only defended myself.” the blond insisted again, sitting down in an uncomfortable chair.
Once they reached the exit, Harry hung back. Hermione gave him a knowing look and ushered the others back towards the castle. He mouthed "Thank you" in her direction, before heading to the changing rooms. Once there he ducked into a hidden corner, where he wouldn't immediately be spotted, but could keep an eye on the doors to the changing rooms.
“I asked Millie to stand guard so I could sneak in here. Pomfrey wouldn't let me in and McGonagall banned me to the common room, so I could calm down. She wasn't too pleased about me yelling at Ginny.” Harry confessed.
“Private lessons?” the older boy repeated sceptically
“I'm not cheating.” the dark-haired boy protested.
"Nah, that wasn't McLaggen. He was just sort of lying there, while Ron pummelled him." Seamus said with a shrug.
The blond blinked in shock. With trembling fingers he pulled back the sleeve of his left arm and stared at the unblemished skin, completely speechless. Harry reached out and traced the spot where the dark mark had been. The skin looked a little red and tender, but otherwise completely normal.
I really hope you like the end.
“That... that's great!” the dark-haired boy said with a smile.
The two men shared a quick look, before giving him their undivided attention. "Tell us, Harry."
"No, I haven't."
Harry wanted to protest. He wanted to continue. To try again right now. But he knew that Draco was right. He did feel exhausted. “Okay, tomorrow then.” he acquiesced.
“We should split up.”
“Shit! They've added Gemino and Flagrate curses. Everything we touch will burn and multiply, until we're crushed to death.” the Slytherin explained with a pained grimace.
“How did you get in here?” Harry asked.
“So?”
After another four days of talking it through, they agreed that they had everything as well planned out as possible. Draco would pose as Lucius and demand to be taken to his vault. Harry would follow him under the invisibility cloak. The Malfoy vault was close to the Lestrange vault, so this would at least take them in the right direction. Once the cart had made it down, they would have to overpower the goblin, get him to take them to Bellatrix vault and then lead them out again.
“When she was six years old, she was attacked by three muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic. She was a kid. She couldn’t control it. They got a bit carried away, trying to stop the little freak... It destroyed her, what they did. She was never right again. She wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it either.” He sighed and turned away from the portrait to stare out of the window instead.
The Slytherin rolled his eyes. “Of course. If you were some mad, dark lord, would you simply put a bit of your soul into a box and keep it on a shelf for others to find?”
Draco freed himself from Harry's grasp and pushed the sleeve back down, unwilling to look at the ugly mark. He did his best to keep it covered all the time, so he never had to look at it.
“It's too cold for a Seekers game.” Draco complained.
From there on things took a definite upturn. Study dates in the library soon started including Ron and Hermione, as well as Pansy and on the odd occasion even Crabbe and Goyle. Everyone got on surprisingly well. Though Harry preferred study dates in the room of requirement, which usually meant a lot of snogging.
“It drove her mad. Sometimes she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and harmless. My father went after the bastards that did it and they locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he’d done it, because then they would’ve locked Ariana up in St. Mungos for the rest of her life. We had to keep her safe and quiet. So we moved and put about that she was ill.”
“And you want us to come along and watch? Kinky.”
“Oh yes, so far you've been doing a spectacular job.”
"I hope you told him where to stick his idea?"
Thanks for all the lovely reviews. Your encouragement means a lot to me.
"He hasn't stopped staring since you sat down." Pansy claimed.
"Then Mipsy will go to Hogwarts." she decided. "But if master Draco ever need help, he be calling Mipsy."
“Yeah.” he muttered a little uncomfortably.
“Alright…” Harry said, sitting back against the headboard and looking at Hermione questioningly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Indeed, we did. We found a way to slightly alter the ritual, so Harry won’t be harmed.”
“What are you grinning about? We could have been killed!”
Again Harry's eyes were drawn to the still form of Remus. He remembered the werewolf laughing and showing off baby pictures only a few hours ago. Remembered Remus naming him godfather of his newborn son. And now that son was an orphan. Just like Harry. His parents had died, trying to protect Harry. Just like his own parents had died protecting him.
“It was the sword. The sword of Gryffindor.”
He hesitated, wondering how much he should tell her. Pansy was his best friend. They never had any secrets. And he didn’t want to start now. But it wasn’t exactly his secret to tell…
Harry turned to face his godfather, who looked rather poncy himself, in his cream-coloured robes with golden lining. But he actually seemed to feel comfortable, whereas Harry felt like a dressed-up monkey.
"Well, I don't know what I saw in you either. You're annoying and clingy!" Ron shot back.
Once he spied the door he got ready to pounce, but as always Malfoy slithered through the crack and the door vanished before Harry even got close. Only this time the blond didn't slink off towards the dungeons, like he usually did. Instead he leaned back against the wall with a tired sigh. The Gryffindor watched him curiously, noting again how bloody tired he looked.
“So are you.”
Harry however chose to ignore the comment. "I swear I'll tell you all the details later, but right now I don't have much time. I promised him I'd be back soon."
Once Travers had trotted out of sight, Bogrod summoned a cart and they got in.
Ron nodded. “She's right. We shouldn't risk it.”
Draco didn’t look like he believed him. Harry wasn’t sure that he could hold that promise, either. But he would try. Because Draco had no reason to stay with him. He could have taken off as soon as he’d turned seventeen. But he hadn’t. He was still here, despite all their fights. Despite Harry’s ugly temper. And he was extremely grateful for that.
But Remus shook his head. “I wouldn’t want to risk it. There have been rumours about death eaters and even dementors being stationed there.”
Hermione shot him a glare. “No need to snap at us.”
Harry looked at him like he'd grown an extra head. Hermione okay. She had a knack for knowing things about him even before he did. And Luna was surprisingly insightful as well. But Ron was usually completely clueless.
He didn't like the look the two professors exchanged and how his head of house seemed to stall.
“Okay. Do you want me to sit with you until you fall asleep again?”
Finally the bell signalled lunch break and Draco moved aside as students started rushing up to the castle, some of them giving him curious looks. Harry walked over with Ron and Hermione in tow, looking surprised at seeing Draco there.
The gravestone was made of white marble and rather simple. It almost seemed to shine in the darkness. Draco didn’t even have to bend down to read the inscription.
"And then you need to go shopping. I'm expecting a visitor tomorrow. I'll need some sweets. Maybe a cake. Chocolate."
Harry sprinted towards them, calling out in Runcorn's booming voice to stop. To Draco's surprise they actually did. Harry told them that the Muggle-borns had to leave first and for a moment it looked like they might actually be getting away with it.
“Why did you put on that ring?” Snape demanded to know. “It carries a curse, surely you’ve realized that. Why even touch it?”
He looked back at the younger boy, just as a herd of centaurs came charging out of the forest and what looked like hundreds of people came swarming over the walls, all of them attacking the Death Eaters. And this time he was sure. Harry gave a little twitch. And then he disappeared. Hidden beneath his invisibility cloak.
“Maybe it will fade completely one day.”
“Moony and I. We were already together before the war. But I wasn't big on talking either and with everything that was going on...”
I'm not really happy with this chapter, but... ah well, see for yourself.
“But...”
Draco had a really bad feeling about this. There was something off about that woman. But he couldn’t really put his finger on it. So he had no choice but to follow the other two as they approached her. As soon as they started moving in her direction, she turned around and led them down the street to a house with a very unkempt garden. She wobbled down the path towards the front door, fumbling with the key.
He and Harry led their fist DA meeting in the second week of October. Draco was a little nervous, despite all their careful planning, but it went better than expected. Millie and Blaise showed up like they'd promised and they even brought two fifth year boys from Slytherin with them. Everyone behaved surprisingly well.
“Please tell me you're not really planning on going to the forest.”
“Umm... Malfoy? Any other ideas?”
"I did something stupid. Well, a couple of stupid things actually." Harry confessed.
“He’s a Gryffindor.” Draco reminded.
When they finally reached the seventh floor, Harry was nowhere to be seen. But Ron, Hermione, Neville and Luna were waiting by the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy and his trolls.
“No, I can't. And you can't tell anyone about it, okay? Not even Ron and Hermione.”
“We did it!” Tonks shouted, doing a little victory dance, which ended with her stumbling over her own feet and knocking into a passing witch. “Sorry!” The witch glared at her and hurried off.
Draco hesitated a second. “You wouldn’t have told me the details of what happened in Bathilda’s house.”
“Nothing to worry about.” she assured them. “He only had a cracked skull. I mended it at once, but he's still unconscious and I'm keeping him overnight. He shouldn't overexert himself. That also means no visitors.”
“There they are. Look.”
With a scream of pure rage Ron swung the sword. Again there was a sound like a scream, a big bang and the smoke figure vanished. The locket had been shattered to pieces. Ron stood there, panting and trembling. The sword fell out of his hands and clattered to the ground. Suddenly Hermione let out a choked sob and threw herself into his arms.
“But Harry used the real sword of Gryffindor to fight the basilisk back in second year.” Draco insisted.
Okay, so much for staying quiet. Hesitating only a second, he pulled off his cloak. Malfoy turned his head to look at him and didn't even flinch. Harry was disappointed. He had hoped for some kind of reaction.
“I’ll be sure to let Granger know.”
“Why don't you try talking to her again? Or Zabini?” Harry wanted to know.
But it did no good. They had their minds made up and wouldn't even listen. The five formed a circle around him, egging each other on. Draco knew it was only a matter of time until they started attacking. And he was right.
“You always hated the guy. You were rivals for five years and now you're suddenly pals. You've got to admit that it looks suspicious. So when Ginny told us about the Imperius curse we thought...” Dean tried to back his best friend up, but trailed off at the murderous look Harry sent him.
Then he addressed Harry directly: “You have permitted your friends to die for you, rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the forbidden forest. If you have not come to me, have not given yourself up by the end of that hour, I shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me.”
Ron was officially dating Lavender Brown since that fateful party in the Gryffindor common room. Which meant that the red-head now spent pretty much all of his free time lip-locked with her. Harry shuddered whenever he heard the girl's high pitched voice shouting: “Won-Won!”. It made him glad that he'd never gotten that far with Cho. And while he was happy to get more time alone with Draco, he still missed hanging out with his best mate.
The younger boy grinned. “Too bad that there are still people around. Cause I really want to kiss you right now.”
Draco aimed a kick at the small man's ribs and then scrabbled for his wand. Wormtail continued to struggle. His silver hand closed around Harry's throat, choking him. Seeing this, Draco abandoned his wand and tried to pry the hand off Harry, but it wouldn't budge.
“Yes, I know.” Harry grumbled. “Doesn’t mean I like it.”
Growing bolder Draco pushed his free hand beneath Harry's shirt to pinch and tease his nipples. Harry grabbed his shoulder to steady himself, shuddering uncontrollably. Draco quickened his strokes and was rewarded with a strangled moan that sounded vaguely like his name, as Harry's cock throbbed in his hand, spurting come between their bodies.
Harry jumped in shock. He hadn’t even noticed Draco entering the kitchen.
Harry craned his head to look at Lovegood. He had already noticed the strange symbol around his neck earlier, but he had no idea what it meant.
Ron and Hermione were giving them funny looks, but Harry decided to worry about that later.
"What is that supposed to mean? You're making no bloody sense, Potter!"
She heaved a sigh. “Of course. You stopped thinking. Like you always do where he’s concerned.”
Tonks strutted after him like she owned the place, while the two men followed closely behind. Remus couldn't really believe that they'd made it this far. He kept waiting for an alarm to go off, for Aurors to show up or the goblins to attack them. But nothing happened. They left the main hall through a side door and got into a waiting carriage.
“What does he do in there?” he wanted to know.
“Forgive me for caring about my education. And I didn’t study nearly as hard as I wanted to, because someone kept distracting me.” the blond shot back.
It was maybe a few weeks later (the days had started blending together after a while, so he couldn't be sure how much time had really gone by) when Harry finally managed to block Draco's attempts at legilimency. It took a lot of willpower and concentration, but he managed and that was what mattered.
“The house-elf’s highest law is his master’s bidding.” Kreacher intoned. “Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came home.”
“Definitely.” Hermione said at once.
“Kreacher will fetch the wands and wait for master Harry’s command.”
“Okay, we'll better go then. Thanks, Luna.”
“She’s the Ravenclaw ghost. And also Rowena Ravenclaw’s daughter.” Harry explained. “It was Luna’s idea. Because it’s said that no-one in living memory has seen it.”
It took Draco only a second to assess the situation. Then he reacted without thinking (as he was prone to do whenever Potter was involved) and rushed to the dark-haired boy's side. He felt Potter's magic even before he reached him. It made his skin prickle and the hairs on his arms stand up. How the reporters didn't notice it was beyond him.
Harry felt frozen in place. Before he could react, Draco had stepped in front of him and turned to glare at Pansy.
“No. Hermione had it in her bag. I asked her to give it back to me earlier, when you were talking to your mum.”
“Good luck with that.” the red-head snorted.
“Very. We managed to get the horcrux out of Harry.” Draco heard Ginny gasp behind him and realized that she didn’t know. But he couldn’t worry about that now. He didn't know how much time they had. “It’s destroyed. Most of them are. Only two are left now. One is the snake. The other one must be hidden here at Hogwarts. Do you know what it is? Or where it is?”
He was looking at Harry over at the Gryffindor table, fretting that being back at Hogwarts would destroy the fragile bond that had formed between them over the summer.
"You know the rules Harry!" George hollered, grinning along with his twin-brother.
“I can't.”
“Are you Bathilda?” Harry asked the old woman.
Draco flinched, once again reminded that it wasn't a good idea to get on her bad side. She was still a little pissed at him after their last argument, where he'd threatened to hex her if she didn't stop following him around. He knew that she only meant well, but it had been grating on his nerves and cutting into the already limited alone time he got with his boyfriend. Hermione had done her best to play mediator, but Millie could really hold a grudge when she wanted to.
Rita Skeeter was no surprise and neither was the notebook in her hands, even if seeing it made his blood boil. Madame Maxime had come to the funeral as well. Even the merpeople looked on from the black lake and a herd of centaurs stood at the edge of the forbidden forest.
“You have fought valiantly. Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will die, one by one. Lord Voldemort is merciful. I have commanded my forces to retreat, immediately. You have one hour. Dispose of your dead. Treat your injured.”
“What kind of stupid question is that? Of course I do!”
"Sir, maybe we should head up to Experimental Charms and check it out. That thing could really have escaped from there. I believe we had a similar incident last week." he claimed, hoping Sirius would get the message.
"Quite the opposite, actually." Draco muttered and shared a secret smile with Harry.
The Gryffindor girl nodded. “They left already. But that's not the reason we're here. Harry didn't have much time, so he couldn't give us all the details, but... he said he heard Nott celebrating in the room of requirement.”
“Not yelling at me whenever I suggest something would be a good start.”
“We won't disappoint you.” Draco promised. He was grateful that she'd even let him come back. And he was determined to use the chance she was giving him.
“Wha’ you on about? You never cared about any of that chunk…” Mundungus whined.
“He is a great help.” Harry repeated firmly.
While Hogwarts became strangely empty, the village of Hogsmeade was packed with witches and wizards, who wanted to pay their last respects to Dumbledore. There was also a delegation of the Ministry, including the minister himself, staying at the castle. Harry did his best to avoid them, like he avoided most people.
“Wait!” Hermione cried. “We can't just go. We need a plan.”
But his thoughts kept returning to the flowers and the question of who had sent them. He couldn't stop himself from glancing at Harry again and again, but the Gryffindor never looked back. He appeared to listen closely to everything McGonagall was saying, which was very unlike him and only served to fuel Draco's suspicions.
"He started calling you Draco." Pansy pointed out.
“But not like this...” Remus tried to explain, launching into another tirade.
“Right. Makes sense.” Harry had to admit. “Well, at least you’re here. But don’t just stand there. Take a seat.”
Their reassurances did little to comfort him. And it seemed that Draco felt the same.
“No, he hasn’t.” Ron said with a shrewd look.
"Draco does have a point." Remus cut in again before they could start a fight. "Judging by what I've read so far I'd say it's pretty unlikely that the locket can possess you when you simply wear it. But that doesn't mean it won't affect you at all. This is extremely dark magic we're dealing with. As I said, I haven't managed to work my way through all the texts yet and my knowledge is sketchy at best. We'd better be very cautious."
Godric's Hollow wasn't what Draco would have expected. Not that he'd really known what to expect. It was a quiet, picturesque little village, with only a few small shops, a pub and a church. Despite today being a Saturday there weren't many people around, for which he was glad. Harry was wearing a hoody, which covered his hair and partially hid his face and Draco had put on a hat to hide his hair, but on closer inspection their disguise wasn't fooling anyone. Luckily no-one seemed inclined to take a closer look and they were left alone. It seemed like strange visitors were a common occurrence here.
“The riddle? You mean you know how to open it?”
“Yes, I did. But... it didn't do much good. He said he was well aware of Mr. Nott's choices and told me to leave the matter to him.” Harry muttered, looking petulant.
“You can't know that.” Draco argued.
“Okay. And…”
“What? He’s not in love with me.”
The question earned him an eye-roll. “I'll be fine, Harry. I can look after myself. And aside from that, Millicent has appointed herself as my personal bodyguard. I have no idea what Blaise told her.” the Slytherin grumbled.
And the waves clasp one another;
"You mean if he was aware of my actions?" Snape asked.
“Like I said, they’re a bit strange. They believe in all kinds of weird things. Mostly things that don’t really exist. But they’re also harmless. I’m sure Luna’s father isn’t a fan of Grindelwald or anything. He probably picked up the sign somewhere and made up some weird story for its meaning.”
"What happened?" Harry wanted to know. "Did he get hit by a curse?"
Harry suddenly felt too excited to sit around, so he did his best to get some cleaning done, wanting the house to look… well, at least not as shabby as it usually did. He spent the whole day getting at least the kitchen and living room somewhat presentable and started on the library the next day. There was no answering letter and Harry got more and more nervous with every passing hour.
“Now? It’s the middle of the night.” Remus reminded.
“Don’t give me that hero worship crap. I thought people had finally gotten over it.”
She paused, taking a deep breath, like she was steeling herself. “As of yet we cannot say whether the school will open again in September … or remain closed forever.”
“Gay? It was always pretty obvious. I think we all knew.” she claimed.
“That's rich, keeping you in the dark, because he doesn't want to put more pressure on you. Like that's ever stopped him before.”
"Astoria!" an angry male voice shouted at the girl. Gentle hands grabbed Harry and pulled him out of harms way, setting him down on the blanket.
“Come on, the bathroom is over there.” he said, grabbing a few clothes as well.
Harry approached him cautiously. They both sat down on the large stone, just staring at each other for what felt like hours.
“Kreacher, stay still!” Sirius bellowed.
“And... you don't mind?” Harry asked cautiously.
“Be that as it may, I implore you to be careful, Draco. Mr. Nott is unpredictable right now. I've been trying to keep an eye on him, but he makes it rather difficult. Whatever task the Dark Lord has set him is taking a toll on him. And that makes him very dangerous.” Snape warned.
“And you believe him?” Hermione checked once he'd ended.
“My friends will start wondering where I am if I don't show up to breakfast.” Draco finally broke the silence. “And I guess your merry band of Gryffindors will miss you as well.”
"I just thought it might be a good idea to get to know each other better. You know, since there's a chance that this stupid bond is permanent! Forgive me for trying to be nice." Harry huffed.
“I want to kiss you, too. But we can't. Not here. Not anywhere, with the way people are staring.”
They completely ignored his protest. Of course they did. He liked both girls well enough. They could be funny and sometimes it was nice to gossip or discuss fashion with them. But there were also times when they were a real pain in the ass and he had the sinking feeling that it would be one of those times now.
“No, I’m not. Stop asking me that.” he grumbled.
“I don't take orders from you no more, Draco. You're a traitor!”
"That's great, Katie. Are you going to re-join the Quidditch team then?" Harry asked.
Then Draco looked away and the moment was broken.
“I'm not exactly sure how it happened.” Harry said with a shrug. “We saw each other at Andromeda's and he helped me one time when my magic whacked out. After that we started talking and … well, we agreed to put the past behind us and … things just sort of … evolved. He's been there for me, you know?”
“From what I’ve seen so far, people don’t like including Slytherins in anything.” Harry grumbled.
Harry sped up, following Hermione, Ron and Goyle through the billowing smoke, hardly able to breathe. All around them the last objects burned to ash. The heat was getting unbearable and Draco was holding him so tightly it hurt.
Lucius whirled around, but he was a second too late. Draco's spell hit him with such force that he was ripped off his feet and thrown backwards into the wall. He crumbled to the ground and lay motionless.
As always the transformation had taken quite a toll on Remus and he would need a couple of days to recover. He was still confined to his bed on the second day after the full moon, so it was just Sirius and the kids at the breakfast table. Ron was finally well enough to move around freely and share the burden of the locket. Wearing it made him whiny and moody and he was prone to start complaining about every little thing. Draco had to give him a wide berth, otherwise he was scared he’d strangle the annoying red-head.
Harry could only agree with him. It was bad enough that he had to watch his best friend snogging Lavender all the time. He really didn't need to hear the details about their relationship.
“Pretty much, yes.”
“Well, first I would strip off your shirt. Then I would slide my hands all over your body, from your throat down to your hips. Find out where to touch you, to make you moan.” Harry answered without hesitation. “Then I would follow the same path with my lips and tongue, circling your nipples, biting your hip bone.”
“I... I wanted to impress you.”
He decided to get it over with quickly and ask Slughorn after their next Potions lesson, which came way too soon for his liking. They were studying antidotes now and Harry had no idea what their teacher was even talking about. Hermione, as always, quoted perfectly from the book, making him understand even less, if possible. And then they were each handed a vial and told to brew an antidote.
"Now that we've got it, what are we going to do with it?" he wondered.
“So Nott's doing something in the room of requirement. Most likely something illegal. But we have no idea what exactly. That means we need to catch him at it.” Harry mused.
“And now come on. Let’s get dressed. I believe there are some presents waiting for us in the living room.” the blond joked.
“No, we don’t. They can manage without us.”
“We didn't really need anything. But it's fun to just look and try on some things.” Daphne let him know.
“He went to bed. Said he was tired.” Michael Corner answered quickly.
“Ah, doesn’t make much of a difference now.” Sirius claimed. “He was already on his way here. And by now he probably knows we’re after his horcruxes, so he’s going to be pissed enough.”
“Harry, we really didn't...”
“No-no. I'll wait.”
“But... why stage that whole kidnapping and...?”
"I know of two. The last one he made was his snake.”
Harry shuddered. Dumbledore's right hand was blackened and dead-looking. The old headmaster however shrugged it off without explanation and gave a variation of his usual speech. He told them about the list of banned items (now containing every product from Weasleys Wizard Wheezes), before urging the students to put old rivalries aside and work together, now that Voldemort was gaining strength once more. Harry found himself glancing at Draco again, sharing a secret grin with the blond.
“Of course we believe you, Harry.” she assured. “And we're really sorry for the way we reacted yesterday. It was just … unexpected.”
“It could be. That would mean the cloak and the wand are real. So why not the stone, too?”
“Even if he's delusional and too full of himself.” Ginny added with a smirk in his direction, causing him to chuckle.
“That is all I ask. I would hate to have to tell your mother that something has happened to you.”
“I know. Luna sent me a message.” He pulled a golden coin from his pocket and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons they had used for the DA.
"Unfortunately we only have that one." the Gryffindor girl reminded him.
“That’s Bathilda’s house, if I remember correctly.” Sirius noted.
They finally entered the next room, where Harry was helping the old woman light candles that were placed on nearly every flat surface. Draco looked around and his unease grew. The whole house was a mess and it smelled like there was something rotting in the dark corners. Bathilda was clearly in no state to live alone. She was staring blankly at Sirius while Harry moved around the room. Draco wondered if she did recognize him after all.
“You are a mere child. You do not stand a chance against Lord Voldemort.”
“People need to learn to move on.” the Gryffindor grumbled. “We all make mistakes. That's okay, as long as we learn from them. I think what you do in the future is more important than what you did in the past. Yes, you were a Death Eater. And a giant prat. But you're different now.”
“If anything, that showed me that I prefer boys.” the dark-haired boy said with a snort. And while he was at it, it was probably best to tell Ron everything. “I'm dating Draco.”
Harry watched him as he left the room. Then he leaned back in the armchair and thought back to their talk. It had been their first, real conversation as far as he could remember and he was surprised how well they'd gotten along. Maybe they could really leave the past behind and move on.
“I know that she helped me. And I know that she would be happy to try.”
“Does that mean wizards are okay with it?” the Gryffindor asked.
“I think she didn't think that one through. She just acted. Because she loves you. And when you love someone, you do stupid things, without thinking about the consequences.”
