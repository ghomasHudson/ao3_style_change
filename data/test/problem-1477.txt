When he saw in his peripherals Ron sit on one side and Hermione on the other, he said, “I assume you told her why I wanted to talk?”
“Actually, yes. I was wondering about my privacy. I don’t really want the prophet talking all about my childhood. It wasn’t exactly ideal, or very bright.” Gregor answered immediately, “I promise that anything said in here, stays in here. I completely understand that you don’t want more attention than you already have. Anything else?”
“Take a deep breath, breathe with me. In… and out…” Her soft, calming voice penetrated through all the panic and he started to calm down a little bit, but he still wasn’t alright.
“Ok, how did you and Seamus get together?” Glancing at the person he was cuddled up to, the dark-skinned male smiled.
He then sniffled and said in a shaking voice, “For as long as can remember until about two years ago, my room was the cupboard under the stairs. My cousin, Dudley has also always bullied me. The bedroom I have now, used to be his second bedroom that all of his toys, his old tv and stuff like that went.”
Hermione sighed and responded, “Oh well, I suppose I will. Never have I ever been pinned down.” Draco, Pansy, Ron, Dean, Seamus, and Theo took their shots. Seeing as the last question was pretty much the opposite of this, no one was too surprised.
The group crowded down the halls, Luna in the lead, dragging Pansy behind her, with everybody else following. Ron and Hermione brought up the rear, murmuring.
Harry gently grabbed the blonde’s chin, moving it so he was facing him. “Hey, it’s ok. I won’t ever let it get that bad again. I promise.” The brunette let go of the other’s chin, glancing out at the view.  “It really is beautiful, isn’t it? How about this. Let’s go get some dinner, and then we’ll come back here, look at the stars.”
An argument broke out. Hermione of course, saves the day, “Ok, let's vote. Raise your hand for Never Have I Ever.”
Realizing he had been talking for a long time, and that he had started crying, he stopped. Gregor stood up and grabbed a box of tissues from his desk and set them in front of Harry, he sat back down. He crossed his legs and spoke up, “Wow. I didn’t really expect you to open up that much, especially in our first session, providing that you want to continue. I think I should tell you, though it probably won’t help much right away, you are perfect the way you are. There is nothing that you could have done, and you shouldn’t hate yourself.”
As the Trio walked down to the lake, he started to wonder what Hermione and Ron’s reactions would be. Hermione would probably be a bit concerned and immediately run off to the library to do research. Ron- who knows what Ron will say.
They both left the room and Harry walked across the hall. He knocked on Ron’s door and when he heard a quiet ‘come in’ he took a deep breath before entering the room. He walked in and found Ron sitting on the bed with his head in his hands.
————————————————————
As the day passed, he found himself migrating away from those he knew and towards those that he wanted to get to know. He found out that Draco had changed more than he had thought. He even had seen him give Hermione a high-five.
A mind healer is set up and the golden trio have a laugh.
Gregor then said, “I can tell you are thinking about it, will you tell me what you are thinking, and what emotions go along with those thoughts?” “I-I don’t know if I can. I can at least tell you what I am thinking, but it has always been really hard for me to express my feelings, especially without breaking down.”
Gregor looked surprised. “I guess that was one solution. What did he tell you?”
Pansy raised her eyebrows and said, “You probably want to take that back.”
He then stepped into the fire and with a final wave goodbye, was whooshed away by the flames. The next thing he knew, he was already back in the common room, being spitted out by the fireplace.
Standing up and walking across the circle, Luna gave Parkinson a small peck on the cheek. Parkinson blushed a bright red while Luna just sat back down with her signature dreamy smile and rose pink cheeks.
“Why don’t we take it slow. We can stop whenever, and we will take it as far as you want it to go. Do you want to top, or do you prefer to bottom?” Draco said with a soft smile on his face. Harry smiled and blushed harder; he rarely ever seen this side of Draco. He grabbed Draco’s wrist and moved it so that it was cupping his cheek instead of holding his chin, and he leaned into the touch, kissing the insides of Draco’s palm, and sighed.
Luna went next, saying, “Never have I ever played seven minutes in heaven.” All the Slytherins took a shot, but no one else did.
Letting out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding he started talking, letting everything that had been on his mind for as long as he could remember spill out.
His first night in his dorm, he didn’t cry himself to sleep. This was the first time that he can remember that he felt actually happy.  The second night, he did, and someone heard him. Ron. This boy he was instant friends with, and he didn’t know he had heard him quietly sniffing.
Gregor frowned, and responded, “Well, I am certainly glad that Monday went well. Would you tell me what happened Tuesday?”
Harry
————————————————————
Draco laughed softly, smiled, and replied, “Well, you’re lucky your boyfriend is a switch then.” The blonde grabbed his hand and led him over to the bed. Harry laid down, uncertain and nervous. Draco picked up on his boyfriend’s nervousness and said, “Relax. I’m not gonna hurt you.” Harry nodded and leaned up to the blonde, who had draped himself over Harry for a kiss and was indulged.
He just stood there, his heart heavy, like a stone in his chest. He then felt arms wrap around his waist as he was suddenly assaulted by Draco’s comforting scent. Harry clung to his boyfriend for comfort and took a deep, shaky breath and whispered, “I think they broke up. ‘Moinie probably went to her room; she will probably be ok. I’m guessing Ron is in my room, not his, which is right next to Hermionie’s. You probably shouldn’t come, “ He said regretfully, looking up at Draco.
He packed his stuff up and headed down to McGonagall’s office. He knocked and heard a “Come in!” from inside. As he opened the door, she said, “Oh it’s you Mr. Potter! Thank you for coming down. I wanted to inform you that you now have an recurring appointment on Sunday evenings at 7:30, just after supper, with a mind healer. I wanted to ask you, would you rather floo or portkey?”
Harry closed his eyes and said, “That does not excuse him.”
Draco laughed, saying, “Oh, well I have definitely done that before. I suppose ‘Silent treatment’ is the muggle name for it.”
Harry sighed, gave a tired smile, and said, “Pretty well, but there have been a couple more panic attacks than usual. Give me a sec to clear my head and organize my thoughts and I’ll start from the beginning.”
A blush crept up his neck up till his face and Harry rubbed the back of his neck with a hand and asked, “How did you know?”
They ducked behind a tapestry, one that the brunette had never seen before, which was strange after pouring over the marauder’s map for years, and having had years to explore the castle. They walked into a small, semi-circle room naturally lit by the windows. The three walls have windows, with a bench beneath them. The ceiling above them was also made out of glass.
Harry smiled, “Thank you. I would like that, and I’m glad to know it’s not just me who feels that way sometimes.”
After a moment, Gregor went on. “I’m glad you told me about that, and that we can try to help you with the panic attacks. Did anything else happen this week that I should know about?”
His mind flashed back to his first year when Hermione was trying to cheer him up after he had told her and Ron about the Dursley’s.
Getting up, he, Ron and Hermione grabbed their books and headed to charms. Charms was pretty boring, with only Hermione really listening to Professor Flitwick drone on. The most interesting part of class was when Seamus somehow set his feather on fire, though what they were trying to do was levitate it.
“Anyways,” Gregor continued, “Some things to expect during attacks include loss of breath and shaking. Most people won’t be able to hold themselves up and will end up curled in a ball. Some people prefer having someone holding them helping ground them to reality; others not. It can also depend on the trigger. Ask before touching, and don’t if you don’t get a definite response. Any questions so far?”
————————————————————
Draco smirked and said, “Glad I could do that for you. I suppose I should tell you about my childhood.” Draco hesitated, but Harry gave a soft smile and said, “Hey, you can talk to me. You can share how much or how little you’re comfortable with.” Draco nodded, still a little reserved.
Draco won the game of chess. It was no surprise, Harry was rubbish at chess. The two decided that they should have dinner and went to the great hall. Harry had almost forgotten that Hermionine and Ron had broken up that day. He sighed and glanced at the blonde. Draco had the Malfoy mask on, not showing anything, as most of the time when they were in public.
She stepped in to the office. As she walked in she took a deep breath before saying, “I’m worried about Harry. He just told Ron and I about his home. It’s abusive.”
“I don’t know what’s doing it exactly,” Harry murmured behind his ear. “We don’t know enough about it. The particulars. But… I know what it feels like. And it doesn’t… doesn’t feel

Shivering, Blaise lowered himself against the wall. The stones felt deliciously icy over the sharp heat in his side. He lifted his shirt as high as he could without crying out and pressed as much of the area as possible against the granite. Goyle might have ruptured something, cracked a rib. There was no way to know.
There was a canteen on a frayed strap. A few scraps of blank parchment. A toothbrush. Her replacement wand, resting upright against the side of the bag. Blaise had passed it directly on to Malfoy at the cathedral. Her former guards had kept it from her there as well to prevent inadvertent use, but giving it to Malfoy for the journey still tasted sour in the pit of her stomach. Ginny stroked the wood gently. For a moment she contemplated just taking it back, hiding it in the folds of her robes. But it was pointless; Malfoy would notice its absence and take it from her again, and using it even in self-defence was so foolish that the very idea made Ginny scowl.
The candles flared into life. Hermione squinted, shielding her face. Her stomach hurt. “Ron.”
Draco’s acquiescence to his orders stabbed into his ears as if the man were there in front of him, speaking the words again.
This wasn’t the time for his own pain. This wasn’t
He pushed Malfoy backward and the man fell into a chair, legs sprawled, staring up at him. Tonks’ words died, and in the silence, Harry cast a binding spell on Malfoy’s body. Malfoy didn’t even flinch.
But the friendly reply she’d hoped for never came. Ginny smiled at her tightly and looked down at the table.
Krum smiled down at Hermione, and Harry was plunged back three years to a tournament he’d thought the pinnacle of danger. The flashback was dizzying. How ridiculously self-indulgent it all seemed now.
needed. It had never occurred to him to ponder what Seamus had gone through.
Another chill slid down Harry’s spine. He turned away, but there had never been any chance she’d not catch on.
Blaise felt Seamus’ mind drift. He rubbed his hand over his eyes, then stared back up at the stars. Potter had vanished sometime after that, taking Lovegood and Moody with him, and it was then that Blaise knew the end, and his mission, was coming. Besides himself, only Moody and Potter knew where he was headed, and they were sequestered somewhere out of reach until he had accomplished his task.
“Oh. Hestia,” she stated flatly, then her gaze sharpened on Hermione. “That was Ms Lovegood. I’ve got to go. Here.” She tapped three drops from the fourth vial into the flask, gave it a swirl, and handed it to Hermione. “Drink this down, then
Eventually sleep was a necessity. Oliver Wood relieved Harry of his current scroll just as Harry’s head hit the table, and sent him out of the room. Hermione had departed for the Infirmary a few hours back with a splitting headache, and Moody had clunked off to see to a few new arrivals. The twins now sat at the table, brows furrowed identically as they went through the pile of scrolls, and Remus leaned on the hearth, studying an uneven parchment that looked like it was about to crumble to pieces.
He shook his head, the tears finally coming. “It’s the truth, Hermione.”
The Death Eater’s voice faded, and Draco nearly let go of Ginny’s hand. There was no real reason to hold it any longer; she had demonstrated that she would follow swiftly, and without argument. And they might need both their hands.
Harry frowned. It was odd seeing the expression from such a low angle. Seamus inhaled and felt rather than saw Blaise’s chest rise.
What was she going to do anyway? Step aside and give Draco Malfoy her blessing? Tell Harry… gods, tell Harry to go to Draco instead? She wanted to laugh, hard and cruelly, at the absurdity. Here she was, developing a plan for either outcome, and expecting one look from Harry to tell her the way of the world.
It was amazing she had not sensed the presence behind her. Ginny’s expression stiffened; she wheeled the branch over her shoulder with both hands and her lips parted to suck in a silent breath. Draco watched the tendons in Ginny’s wrists tighten.
Draco froze, the air whooshing from his body. He fell back, barely catching himself. Pain bloomed in his belly, familiar and fierce. He felt like he was made from the heaviest of stones.
Her vision returned first in sparks, and then random shimmers. She could hear emptiness, the hollow sound of open land, but she had no idea where she was. In a few seconds she would see it. Hopefully she would be alone.
Merlin. He couldn’t even look at Harry now. His nights with Theodore had never done this to him. In the end, his friend had always been staring back at him in the morning, comforting and knowing, quiet with what they had done yet again. Draco had been able to pretend Theodore’s eyes were a touch greener. But now there was no need to pretend and the painful, sharp reality of it speared his innards.
They chatted for a while afterward, and the morning stretched on. The fire had burnt down to the coals and the room was enfolded in a lazy heat when Luna voice at last gave way to the harp alone. Dumbledore dozed comfortably in his painted armchair. Harry’s thoughts began to sway, blown about by a wayward breeze.
Merlin, he… He didn’t know how he felt. It was much the same, the level of turmoil caused by thoughts of Draco. No, it was different, but it—Harry clutched his head. Where was the line? When had he stepped over it? It was not a feeling he’d always had, but he’d certainly had it for more than a few days, more than a few months. Maybe even years. He knew he didn’t hate Draco, but sometimes, sometimes the way he felt was just as vibrant, just as ferocious. Just as consuming. He
“So.” Hermione nodded once, then again.
“Ginny. What?”
It had been an entire week since he’d dreamt of Hogwarts. Once again, he’d woken smelling the smoke.
“Seamus.” The arm he now clutched lay leaden over his ribs. As he watched, Seamus’ body shivered into another slow rasp. Sallow pits hung under his partially closed eyes, and a glint of red dotted the corner of his mouth. Blaise looked down at the damp sheets.
Besides, his wand was right here in the sack next to hers.
They navigated the halls, headlong rushes down lengthy corridors, maddening crawls beneath smoke. Hermione was starting to fear she no longer knew where they were. But Ron had to know. He was leading with purpose enough to convince her, and if he’d done that, the children would buy into it as well.
“I took him away from you,” Harry said, so quietly he thought he hadn’t spoken aloud. He pulled back and met Remus’ eyes. “Just as I’m taking Blaise from Seamus.”
Wondering if he cared, or even wanted that.
Harry rolled over in bed, cupping a hand over his eyes. Realising that his bed held no one else this time—had held no one else all night—was no help in banishing the emptiness. He laid his hand flat across the sheets beside him, not quite thinking of why, only wanting to touch, to freeze the absence in his memory.
“Well,” said a voice somewhere above him. “It
But the truth did not allow him to dwell in ignorance for long. It returned with silent stealth just when he thought he’d gone far enough out of his mind to rid himself of its presence forever.
Luna said clearly in Harry’s head. The urgency was unfamiliar; Luna had never once expressed such anxiety to him, Siren’s Ward or not. Harry staggered, banged into the stone wall, and nearly fell. Hermione dragged him up again, but Harry’s sight gave a lurch that spun the hallway right round. Down at the end of it, someone came into view at a full run and a cord snapped taut, dragging Harry upright. Hermione hissed and let go of his arm, but then Harry had him, had Draco—Draco who had just crossed the entire castle—skin to skin, his face in Harry’s hands, his breath against Harry’s mouth.
“Shh! Great jabbering nuisance, that’s what you are, Hermione Granger.” Ron walked her across the room and dropped her down on the bed, and Hermione scooted backward as best she could. He crawled toward her over the duvet, a lopsided smile on his face. Hermione watched as his right knee became swamped in blankets and he had to halt and push it free. She settled back, elbows braced behind her, knowing she looked like a silly schoolgirl waiting for… well, something favourable, she was certain. Only she hadn’t the care to think what just now.

The goblet was pulled away. Harry let it go. His eyes drifted closed as the drink lulled him under again, hardening his cock anew, making him
, she was tight (he didn't know how, when she routinely spread her legs for nearly any Gryffindor who'd have her). She was bouncing on his cock — which was fucking hot in itself, but she was doing it here at Slughorn's Christmas party, surrounded by people doing the exact same thing, snogging and sucking and getting off in all manner of ways.
Her pussy was starting to ache. Hermione rubbed her legs together, but the teasing pressure only made it worse.
He felt fine.
, re-claimed tonight with his seed — and however many more times it took before the slut carried it to term, forever bound to Severus Snape. A thought occurred to him (not for the first time) that perhaps Lily bore Severus's seed instead of Potter's. Who was to say if she aborted what Severus spent hours (and various positions) putting inside her?
"Oh!" Ginny's cunt squeezed around Harry as she came, rocking his cock deep inside her, soaking his pubic hair with her cum. Panting, she leaned down to press the softest kiss to his lips. "Thanks for the ride," she grinned. "But if you think you've earned the right to come, you're mistaken." With that, she pulled off his turgid length and dismounted.

Harry got so overwhelmed he started counting teeth to stay sane.
Ginny growled, resuming her own attempt to rape Harry's cock, an act utterly ruined as the slut beneath her tried to arch into it, moaning in delight.
“This is Tilda Basherton, the Prophet’s lead reporter, always on the hunt for a good scoop, am I righ’, Tilda? This one is taken, I’m afraid!” Slughorn gave Harry a rough shake that made his glasses go a bit askew. Slughorn chortled at his own (terrible) joke, sloshing his goblet full of ‘punch’. “Though I
"Please Gin, just his mouth?" Cormac all but begged once he pulled away from her. Precum dripped freely from his prick. "Let him taste it—"
Someone was standing over him, waving a wand. The magical band around Harry's genitals was gone.
The problem was it was Harry's pleasure too. He was well prepared to take Cormac and the angle he was rutting away at did lovely things to Harry's prostate.
The man shook his head a little, remembering himself. “Yes, we should. Slughorn recommended we depart before the party gets
Horribly turned on by the degradation and pain, Harry still felt faint nausea at being inside her. It wasn't that she didn't feel good around him, she did (amazing, in fact), but women, he'd discovered after much thought, just didn't do it for him, no matter how pretty they looked bouncing on his cock. Now, Ginny’s cunt might be tight and so very wet and, granted, without the spell he'd have shot his load inside of her by now out of stimulation alone, but the thing was, Harry didn't really want to fuck her.
A wolfish grin stretch across Cormac’s face as he eyed Ginny. “You know, Potter,” he turned back to Harry and clapped him on the shoulder, “you’re alright. Don’t wait up.” He gave Harry a saucy wink and a last, hearty whack on the shoulder then sauntered off in Ginny’s direction, slouching against the wall beside her.
Ever since the Gryffindor victory party, Ron had been literally hip-deep in Lavender Brown as often as he could manage, it seemed. The number of times Harry had walked in on Ron driving his cock as deep as humanly possible into Lavender’s cunt was unreal.
Alright, maybe Ginny had a point.
Why would he be scared of a
Absently, Hermione began to free herself of her own clothes, letting her nice robes fall to the floor. Luna helped her with the little buttons on her muggle blouse so that Hermione could slide out of that too, leaving her in her underwear, skirt, and smart shoes.
A touch at her entrance startled Hermione, but she soon settled, relaxing into the finger carefully sliding in and out, delving farther every time. The finger curled, rubbed hard at the sensitive tissue behind her pelvic bone and Hermione groaned low, hips rocking up into the touch.

Harry was nearly to the buffet when he was jerked back against someone’s very squishy side.
He palmed Ginny's tits, loving how they felt in his hand, so soft and heavy, jiggling every time he fucked into Ginny's cunt. As good as Cormac felt, he was also wound up, like a coiled spring, and yet oddly...high, almost outside himself, like he was experiencing everything from two different views. It was strange.
His face started to hurt from holding the polite smile as he was introduced to—
“Thanks I think?”
Perhaps the man was addicted?

After nearly an hour of this, Harry saw an opportunity to escape when a devastatingly beautiful witch approached the professor for a hug.

But still, it was…nice, he guessed.
A large hand wrapped around his waist, holding him fast, leaving him little choice but to be frog-marched all around the room, hardly walking more than a few feet before being introduced to this accomplished witch or that interesting wizard. Lucky him, they all were “simply
His head swam, vision blurring. He looked around. A lot of people were either naked or getting there. Bodies undulated against each other, moans began to echo against the stone walls, the air thickening with the musky scent of sex.
Harry squirmed at the thought, wincing slightly at the stiffness in his lower back, noticing how sore his cock and arsehole felt.
Ginny twisted his sore nipples again, drawing Harry more or less out of his thoughts.
“My turn.” Malfoy spotted a chair in the far corner under a heap of what looked like old rags. His nose scrunched up, mildly offended at the sight. A quick flourish of banishment and cleaning charms had the chair mostly serviceable for his needs.
He had no idea how much time passed after Ginny and Cormac took their leave. He was vaguely aware of his surroundings.
Malfoy came around, leaning up against the door beside Potter. “Like that Potter? How does it compare to mine?”
Cormac blinked at her.
Without thought, Harry's hands crept up to Ginny's hips, holding on as she bounced on his cock.
No. That wasn’t right. Not hours.
He staggered past couples and threesomes and moresomes, everyone engaged.
Her pussy throbbed. She

Malfoy could get used to this.
“There you are, Harry, m’ boy!” Slughorn boomed in his ear, slurring just a bit. “Come along now, I’ve so many fine people simply dying to meet you.”
Luna's lips grazed Hermione's nipple through her bra, drawing her attention away from the women with a jolt.
Cormac went at him again, his pace uneven as he hurtled towards orgasm.
Perhaps, if the boy was good, Severus would show him the pictures he’d taken during those blissful hours, compare the boy's flexibility with his mother's, see how many of those same positions they could match.
. Daft prick still won’t leave off. If I hadn’t already been coming along with the drinks, I’d have hexed him for harassment.”
His eyes opened and when they locked onto the hate-filled black eyes of Professor Snape, fully clothed but for the cock he pounded into Harry with, Harry came, untouched, never taking his eyes off of Snape.
“I’m not putting a target on anyone else’s back, Hermione, we’ve talked about this. Anyway, it’s just a party. You walk around, drink some punch, talk to people, and after a couple of hours you can leave. What’s the worst that could happen?”
Finally, Potter stirred to consciousness when Horace came, adding yet another load of cum to seep to the floor. Severus's stomach turned a little when Horace kissed Potter, tongue-fucking his mouth thoroughly. The boy — dutiful slut that he was — sucked on his professor's tongue eagerly, rolling his hips to better take Horace's fat cock, which eagerly renewed its thrusting inside Potter. He watched as Horace all but suffocated the boy under his immense bulk, all in the name of coming yet again inside the little whore.

Hermione wrapped her arms around Luna's neck, her legs around Luna's hips. Never before had she felt so close, so connected to another person.
He scanned the crowd until he saw Malfoy, hiding behind the door of a nearby half-open closet. Potter barely struggled as Zambini tugged him to it, Malfoy closing the door behind them, cutting off most of the lewd din filling the main room.

She was pregnant. Her robes were well-tailored to flatter her fuller figure, which was how he hadn’t initially noticed it, but now that he did, the round curve was all he could see.
"Come on his face."
Luna hummed, eyes drifting shut for a moment, nibbling at Hermione's tit as she groaned around it.
A knock on the door then Hermione entered the dorm, her bushy hair a tangled mess. "Oh good, you're awake. I tried to wait up for you, but I got so tired." She yawned around the last word before smiling at him. "I had the most...
Harry knew he was getting loud, begging for it, begging for the man to make him cum, to never stop fucking him. His own cock slapped against his belly, leaking, needing to be touched (Harry didn’t dare to).
The boy was sex and sin personified.
" Severus came deep inside the boy. There was no surge of magic this time, Potter already pregnant with his seed, but Severus caressed the boy's belly all the same, thrusting minutely as if pushing his cum in a little deeper would do anything more than make Potter groan low in his throat.
Desperate now, she helped Luna strip out of her robes, not stopping until Luna was completely nude. She stopped to admire the sight of her lover, pale and faintly trembling with need. Her eyes traced the small breasts adorned with tiny pink buds, swept her gaze down past the trim waist to the proud cock jutting from a neat blonde thatch of pubic hair, narrow with a delicate curve.

Hermione could do little more than clutch desperately at Luna, overwhelmed by the pain-pleasure at her breast, by the feel of something, some

Levitation was how she had ferried the drinks through the people — Slug Club alumni and current members — clustered here and there throughout the room.  “
He felt so empty. So empty...
Fuck, even if Harry wanted to, he couldn't have Cormac, there was no way would Ginny let him.
He grasped his own cock, pumping it, lazily.
Potter’s eyes were wide. He stared up at Malfoy as he took every inch Zambini gave him, crying out every time Zambini bottomed out. Tears ran down his face. Potter drooled faintly, his mouth open to moan and pant desperately for breath.
Lily's eyes stared back at him, desperate and wanting for him in a way Lily never had, not even when Severus had dosed her with a potion that made her so horny that she let him fuck her for
Cormac did his best to follow Ginny's advice. If Harry had been less stretched, had less cum inside him, he might have been torn apart by Cormac's animal fucking, but Harry loved it.
Harry started, tearing his gaze away from a plate of eclairs tap-dancing perilously close to the table’s edge.
And he was

Feeling more confident, Hermione took the tip into her mouth, suckling it, lapping at the tip like she would a lollipop.

in Zambini. He needed to have that ass again. Gone was the teasing pace Zambini had used before. Now, he fucked Potter in powerful thrusts, burying himself to the hilt, in and out again as fast as he could manage. His bruising grip wasn’t enough to keep Potter in place. The frantic claiming drove Potter forward, practically into Malfoy’s lap.
Cum seeped from his hole.

She fell to her knees. Once she was on level with it, she was unsure of what to do. She'd never done this before. Glancing up, she tried to convey her feelings without speaking and, miraculously, Luna seemed to understand what she needed.

What was wrong with him?
Potter's whimpering changed as the boy started to come, thin strands of cum painting his filthy chest, the orgasm forced out and prolonged by Horace's tight grip on his cock, which Horace kept up, stroking the boy back to full mast and desperate again.
In his defense, lying about having a ‘boyfriend’ was easier because — “hey I’m just going to the Hog’s Head to let random skeevy wizards fuck me blind while wearing a hood so that the barkeep doesn’t release his incriminating photos of me screwing the twins (and countless other wizards now), don’t wait up!” — didn’t exactly roll off the tongue.
he felt empty.
And still Harry tried to lick at him, mouth open wide to tempt Cormac to thrust inside.
Hermione felt like a coiled spring, wound up and nowhere to go. Arousal was hitting her hard, making her trust her body over her lack of experience (something she rarely did). She bobbed faster on Luna's cock, feeling the tip nudge the back of her throat. She struggled to swallow the spit filling her mouth, finding it awkward with her mouth so full.
Hours passed.
"I'm going to love you."
Was it something in the punch? Everyone had been pressed to at least try it (such a good idea, tasted fucking amazing).
They weren't punishing the slut at all. They were making his goddamn
Another slap, harder, knocked his head to the side.
"Perhaps it would be best if I just let you play? Do what you feel is right."
Time lost meaning. There was only unfulfilled need and the freedom that came with servicing others with his body.
Potter had been a guileless slut, trying to seduce his professor (he'd succeeded, much to their shared pleasure). Fucking Potter first with his own butt plug, then with his cock when Potter had passed out had been a treat Severus had more than earned. The surge of magic he'd felt at the moment he'd impregnated the boy was unmistakable (he'd also verified it with research in the Restricted Section).
It was lucky Luna was half on top of her, holding her down because Hermione bucked at that first touch and kept trying to follow that tongue. "Fuck, Luna, please do that again!" That was better than fingers any day.
Potter nodded frantically, eyes rolling back into his skull. Severus was unsurprised when, moments later, the boy came on his cock, untouched.
Hermione pulled off with a gasp, uncaring about the rope of spit connecting her mouth to Luna's cock. "Do it.
Potter whimpered. Still shaking, he braced himself on all fours, bent forward and—laved his tongue across the cum-splattered floor.
"I'm surprised Horace left you to your own devices."
Without warning, Potter levered himself up high enough to kiss Severus, coaxing his clever tongue inside when Severus parted his lips.
Every time Ginny dropped down, her ass would half-squish Harry's balls. Harry's eyes rolled back. He twitched on the floor. He couldn't take much more of this, needed to come,

Harry mentally groaned. Letting Hermione think he had a boyfriend was coming back to haunt him. It had seemed so simple at the time, an easy explanation for why Harry would go off on his own during Hogsmeade weekends, disappearing for hours at a time.
He was also quite unconscious.
He was nowhere near sore yet, but the fat cock fucking him in increasing speed might get him close.
A pair of shapely feet stopped in front of Harry. He looked up, unsurprised to find Ginny standing there, arms crossed, watching Cormac rape him.
Maybe he was drugged?
Someone would occasionally sit on his cock, or draw his legs up to fuck his stretched hole, but they were all strangers, faces blurring together as they used him as a sex toy, laughing about how good a fuck the Chosen One was.
For a long moment, Ginny didn't move, apparently stunned, but soon she was scrambling to lay on her back under Harry, legs spread wide to either side of Harry's. Cormac forced Harry down over her and, wrapping a hand around Harry's cock — here Harry

Bits and pieces of strange, sultry things came to Harry at that, of a night of lust and deprivation with anyone who would have him. Including his professors.

Harry staggered out of the closet, nude and shaking. His body was streaked with cum. It ran down his legs, matted tellingly in his dark hair, smudged up his glasses, and had dried in itchy patches on his face.
, people had been trying to fuck him since before he could remember. They just hadn't been successful before now.
"Horace. Horace!" Snape practice bellowed to get his colleague's attention. Said colleague had his cock buried inside Potter's ass, fucking the well-used slut yet again. Sloppy wet sounds filled the air as Slughorn moved through countless loads of cum.

, but Harry wasn’t really calling the shots here. Between the punch and being pinned in place by Cormac, Harry’s reticence in fucking his almost-sister was overridden, stimulation doing the rest of the work. Harry rocked forward and back as best he could, trying to fuck himself on Ginny and Cormac, but Cormac had a steel grip on his hips, controlling where Harry was to the point Harry nearly went mad with it.
Then Hermione flushed. She was a terrible person. Luna didn't want to have a penis. It was just something she was stuck with. And here Hermione was, happy that her lover

Potter groaned low in his throat, head thrown back, like he’d fucking
"Word is that Malfoy has had you, Potter."
Harry felt Ginny's eyes on him and struggled as best he could, but Cormac held him fast. Whatever was in the punch Harry drank had made him slow and horny. He thrust his rapidly returning erection against Cormac's leg even as he tried to fight to free himself.
Cormac found he couldn't resist anymore.
But she wasn't stopping Cormac at all. Maybe if Harry could think beyond trying to catch his breath, it would make sense to him, but he could only take Cormac's thick cock and stare up at the blob that was Ginny, his own cock drooling precum onto the floor.

Harry thought.
He’d lost track of how long he’d been in there with Malfoy and Zambini, but eventually, they had left him alone on the floor, feeling empty in ways he could only dream of in between Hogsmeade visits, when he could lose himself to the desires of client after client in a room at the Hogs Head Inn, hooded for anonymity while the barkeep who blackmailed him watched and gathered even more blackmail material.

Malfoy grasped Potter’s head, holding it mostly steady so he could fuck that drooling mouth, driving his cock deep into Potter’s throat. Pleasure hit Malfoy, surging within him. He held Potter down, coming deep in his throat while Zambini did the same in Potter’s ass, making sure Potter was filled up at both ends.
The fear shot fully through Blaise’s limbs. Magic resistant. Gods. One of Voldemort’s precautions, perhaps, or maybe she wasn’t just a snake. What on earth was he going to do? He’d counted on magic. Shielding against the Death Eaters, and spells to finish her off. Now Blaise’s head felt hot. There was a ringing in his ears.
Draco rounded on him. “Isn’t it enough that I have to watch you die?
“Interfering? Stopping it from occurring?” Harry’s tone was much sharper. Draco felt a twinge of anxiety.
“Is it selfish of me to want—” Blaise said it quickly, then pursed his lips. “I feel like there’s so much I haven’t done.”
“They don’t know,” Malfoy murmured, staring past Harry to the wall. Sloper growled.
He shook himself and knocked. Moody’s voice called gruffly for entrance, and Harry went in, closing the door behind him. Moody was closer to the entrance than he’d expected; the man stood by the large cabinets lining the nearest wall. He nodded in greeting. Harry returned it and looked quickly away at the rest of the room.
“We have to move.”
Something hot rose in her throat and she grimaced until it sank away again.
He would need it before he ever saw daylight again.
Malfoy’s eyes slid away again.
Malfoy shuddered and again gave up the answer he kept trying to avoid. “When my mother… When I found my mother’s body.”
“What if he doesn’t want it?” he whispered.
“Some of them ran.” But Draco knew that his thoughts and Blaise’s were the same: they were all gone, regardless.
Hannah’s arms were spread, her hair a lopsided halo around her head, gold tarnished by the street’s filth. The front of her shirt and part of the now-lily-white skin of her stomach had been blackened by a grotesque char mark. Hermione’s eyes followed the dark snake’s curving form over Hannah’s side, from the eye sockets of the skull to where the tongue flicked a mangled burn just above her navel. As she watched, raindrops splatted down on the mark and washed rivulets of soot away.
“She can walk. She is… how do you say it… ambulatory. If you get her up. It took a long, long time. But she does move, like a puppet.” Suddenly Fleur was furious, fire flaming in her face. “I could not leave her with
Inside lay a lock of someone’s hair.
Draco froze in the doorway, hand still clenched around the ring. There in the farthest bed lay Blaise, a whitened ghost of himself. Finnigan slouched on a cot beside him, clenching the unconscious man’s hand. The scene was too familiar, but reversed, without blood, without the overwhelming scent of rust. Without Grimmauld. Draco’s throat closed too tightly to inhale.
Draco stood on cold flagstones, naked, and the person out there in the blackness stared back at him. Fury licked round Draco like flames, but the air remained dark and sour, a bottomless night without stars.
A year ago, Ginny would have never touched a bag belonging to anyone else, and especially not Draco Malfoy. The numerous potential enchantments on another’s belongings made the idea ludicrous. But there was no magic in this cave. There was nothing so obvious anywhere in the open, nor had there been for near on nine months. There was nothing like that here. Malfoy, a most desirable target, would never give the Death Eaters such an easy way to find him.
A door clicked open, and suddenly Blaise knew Seamus was there; the presence of the one who shared his bond tore a long furrow through the fog. He rolled dazedly, felt the bed dip, and a warm heat insinuated itself along his back. Seamus’ arm came around him, a delicious weight, and Blaise’s mind spun free of the chaos. He found energy to search out Seamus’ fingers, lace his own through them. Sleep, deep and expansive, took him at last. The passage of time vanished.
Harry nearly jumped up, but Hermione’s grip waylaid the motion.
Harry’s eyes were full of candlelight, only there were no candles. He stroked his fingers down Draco’s face, up through his hair. His skin held the heat of the coming sunrise. “Not going to fuck you, I’m going to make love to you.”
Seamus could see Pomfrey watching out of the corner of her eye even as her wand continued to touch and rise. “Death Eaters,” he managed. His mind threatened to sink.

“Don’t know if I want to go through with it, really,” she joked instead. Rolled her eyes as dramatically as she could. “Such a burden, bonding. Does horrid things to your complexion, you know.”

Harry did know what he was really talking about, he must know, Harry had said he knew, only Draco couldn’t get it out right, couldn’t—why didn’t Harry just
“Wouldn’t be hanging onto my belt buckle if you didn’t, now would you?”
They cleared the trees in a wash of light. There was green before him, washed out by the rain, and a towering grey sky. It was pouring; there were no branches now to stop the onslaught. Draco’s legs kept moving on their own, rushing away from the forest. The whip of red hair edged his vision as Ginny cast a glance behind. Draco blinked, trying to gain his bearings.
How could he refuse?
Almost as though Harry had spoken allowed, a warm body pressed against his ass, hands caressing the back of his legs.
Harry’s head swam. He rubbed his belly absently as he took long pulls of whatever was in the glass. He ran his tongue over his lips, his teeth, chasing the sweet, cloying taste. His head swam a little more, then a lot more.
A baby that kicked at his touch.
Harry didn’t know which of them she was trying to punish.

know at least one thing. And she thought it had been far, far better when she hadn’t known anything about Draco Malfoy.
Draco let out what sounded suspiciously like a hiss. His body contracted in on itself. “I could care less what Harry thinks of me.”
“I want you to,” Harry gasped. Draco drowned him in another kiss, pushing him onto his back and settling on his thighs. Harry arched into Draco’s palm over his bare chest, the grip of fingers at his ribs. He yanked Draco’s shirt up and splayed his hands over Draco’s back, sinking deep into the heat of his skin. Draco sat up and jerked his shirt over his head. He threw it behind him, then returned to Harry’s mouth, working kisses down his throat, pausing to lave Harry’s shoulder. Harry wove his fingers through Draco’s hair and tried to catch his breath, but it was impossible. Draco was too close after such a long time of being so far away, not just physically, but mentally. Now, Draco was
Ginny couldn’t decide what felt worse: the sick horror at those thoughts, or the fact that a small part of her still very much wished they were the reality.
If he could have turned from it, he would have, but then he would have regretted the cessation, wept over the loss as though his life had been taken from him, sought after it until he found the unbearable pull again. He would have borne it. But he couldn’t turn away, couldn’t even think such a thing, and Harry’s body pressed him on, moved with him, coaxed him into incoherency and sparking whiteness.
he thought wretchedly.
“Merlin, what the—Don’t go anywhere, Hermione.”
He wanted this man so badly he could have wept.
There were comfortable-looking chairs, small tables. Books far too big for the shelves sat on raised daises directly beneath the windows. Even from across the room, Draco could see thick coats of dust over most of them, obscuring the words across pages that had been opened long ago. Perhaps years ago, by whomever had lived in this castle before the war. The sway of magic drifted, and Draco peered around, noting areas where the aura was strongest. These were spelled books. But there was no sense of danger, no prickle of uneasily bound magic.
“I’m so sorry about his death.” There, it was out. What she’d been longing to say to him for days, in a quiet tone she’d forgotten she possessed.
And ran into another group.
Just another night. Another tryst to be filed away and, in time, dismissed.
Ginny drew herself up, stung by the sarcasm. “He’s not like that. And you know it as well as I do.”
A second later, Harry understood.
“Doing well enough,” Remus answered, nodding. “We left her outside of Tewkesbury two days ago.”
It wasn’t until he’d gone, disappeared down the passage, that Hermione remembered she should have asked how many Death Eaters there were.
She stopped, but could see her unfinished plea in his eyes. He took her hand and drew her from the room, winding down a long hallway and through several abandoned chambers before pulling to a halt. Ginny found it hard to breathe for an entirely different reason. On the other side of that door was her family.
She’d even called him on it.
It was
Ron tilted his head up. “Uh. Firewhisky, I think. Least, that’s what I poured you earlier.”
“What are you talking about?” Draco whispered.
It wasn’t rubble. Hermione blinked.
if I’m capable of… You know how much pain he’s in! Harry, how could you let him wallow like that?”
“Malfoy,” she returned. Seamus squeezed her shoulders once and released her.
She nodded, her focus now narrowed on her silent cousin. “He’s barely got the clothes on his back. No tracers. No Portkeys. There’s nothing magical on him except the wand.”
Nothing new came through the bond. Harry marveled at Draco’s control.
What was he doing here?
Remus nodded, a tender smile on his face. “There are a lot of people ‘still here,’ so Alastor tells me. And Minerva will be along in a day or so. It’s building,” he continued, his tone going grave. “You can feel it out there, in the land, in the air. We came as quickly as we could.”
“Oliver, Dumbledore trusted him first. Alright? That’s why I gave him a chance. And that should be reason enough for anyone.”
“No, it is not.” She was sure she’d never seen this hallway before. Or that last one.
She had as much claim to Harry’s feelings as he did. More, even. But if she was perfectly honest, that didn’t imply a return of affection anymore than Draco’s feelings did. In the end, it was Harry who had to tip the scales. And in that, Ginny at last found unequivocal comfort.
“It was difficult to figure out exactly what was wrong with him,” Pomfrey said, almost on top of Harry’s words. “I mean, it was plain, it was right there in front of my face! But every spell I cast seemed to be malfunctioning, or giving me the wrong results. He was in much worse shape than they were telling me, but all I could get from the spells was Seamus Finnigan’s aura. And I can’t believe it took me as long as it did to sort through it, because Blaise was still under there, but he was so weak. He still is.”
“That is precisely why I urge caution, Harry.” Dumbledore gave him an encouraging smile. “If I did not believe you capable of this magic, I would not have suggested it.”
“And just what is this last Horcrux?” Hermione asked.
It is all right, I—” She looked at her concealed companion, and when she spoke again, it was in a much quieter voice. “I will deal with her.”
It hardly mattered. There weren’t any good thoughts left with which to distract himself. Just bad thoughts and worse thoughts.
Harry moved closer, taking the bandages and Luna’s hands. The house elf blinked up at him with large, watery eyes, then backed away and vanished. Harry turned Luna’s hands over, surveying the pale skin, the bluish veins lacing her wrists. “Would it really be so hurtful to heal you?”
Weasley turned over in her sleep and Draco swung up out of his reverie. The images faded, but the dark red remained ingrained in his brain, the green dwindling of Theodore’s eyes.
Ginny’s eyes cheeks paled several shades. She stood, grabbing her pack strap. “Oh, gods—”
“Why are any of you even necessary?
He might have spoken it aloud.
A thousand thoughts: Why should Luna have such trouble distinguishing, why was this arrival different, where in fuck had they come from that she hadn’t felt their approach? He asked none of them.
They might have been caught. Hell, it could have happened days ago and no one in the castle would ever know. Luna could only stretch her sights so far and only at certain times, or she risked the collapse of the ward. She’d informed him when Ginny and Draco first set out, but since then, there had been nothing but what Harry’s own mind conjured. He’d been so preoccupied with what might be happening to them that he’d failed to consider what he might say or do when they did finally arrive.
“Acuere Inimicus,” Moody said gruffly. “They would do it to a traitor. In the beginning.”
“Minerva, we’ll get started on this,” Kingsley said. “You need to rest. How long have you been awake?”
Draco’s face collapsed and rebuilt itself in the same instant. His knuckles whitened around handfuls of his cloak. “I don’t give a fuck about any of it, Weasley!” he rasped. “Not you, not—him. If he wants to bind himself to you, then let him. It’ll save my fucking life, now won’t it?”
Harry levered onto his elbow. “What is it?”
Harry stared at the fire. The flames licked at the hearthstones, leaving streaks in the flickering light.
She couldn’t think about that. Couldn’t.
“I know.” A tiny smile lit Potter’s features. “I know she is.”
Harry shut his eyes. It was like staring at a dead body, one that strummed at a harp and sat straight up, and spoke difficult and all-too-simple questions into his head. “Yes.”
“The battle?”
His chest began to seize. Draco stumbled over the grass to the next stone… and the next one. Taller and taller. Unsure of where he was going, only needing to move. The circle locked him into its embrace, and yet it couldn’t drown out the strange whine in his ears.
“Asking you about what happened?”
He was the last Malfoy. He was starting to think he was no Malfoy at all.
“If you would, Minerva, please speak to Dumbledore as well and find out every single piece of information he has to offer.” He wasn’t ready to look his oldest and truest mentor in the eye yet; his body still hummed with betrayal.
By the fire, the chaotic whirl of fiddle and drum ended on a less than even note, and a roar of applause went up. A few seconds later, Fleur Delacour’s crystalline voice silenced every other. The tune was delicate and captivating. Hermione had never heard it before.
Fog. Lots of it. Hermione halted despite her instincts and took in her surroundings properly. Hills to her left; a deep valley to her right. Up on the highest mount, above twisting trees and switchback Muggle roads, a stocky castle reached heavenward. One tower was intact; its sisters rose jagged into the stars.
“Everyone out?” Nod after nod, some as curt as if they came from seasoned soldiers. Hermione hustled them past her. Ron was ushering boys in before him, little ones in striped pyjamas, older ones clutching their wands. Some of the girls were Summoning cloaks and helping the others into them.
How could he know? How could he ever know now? Again the justifications assaulted him, as they had done over and over. He waited as he always had, terrified of some option he hadn’t already considered, one that had slipped past his notice. But nothing came. Instead of the usual relief, however, the only thing left was uselessness. Blaise was still going to die; that was the reality of his perfect choice.
And failed. Harry gathered Draco to him, working his hands under Draco’s shirt and down his back, and couldn’t remember how he’d convinced himself to live without this. Without Draco. It felt like he
When he got back to the room mid-afternoon, Pomfrey had already relocated all of the texts to the Infirmary. Only Remus was left, staring into the fire.
Harry hesitated, but there was nothing to do except satisfy this hunch; he laid his hand flat on Draco’s side, fingers splayed. Draco’s body seized. His head bobbed back and another low sound escaped, but Harry barely heard it.
“I knew your heart already. As soon as I knew Draco’s, the possibilities opened themselves up. I could see the light at the end of this darkness. You are every inch the hero. It is one of your most admirable qualities. You will not sit by when you have the power to finish this. Draco Malfoy is the one best able to give you that power, and perhaps the strength to save yourself as well before it is all over.”
The rescue had gone badly. Azkaban had been quiet, nothing but the drip drip of water leeching through limestone, the groans and cries of those still trapped within. The four people on Harry’s team had slunk past many battered cells, felt the clutch of nameless fingers from those locked inside. Harry remembered the pitiful moan of one emaciated creature, male or female, he couldn’t tell, but it had reached for him with a hand that quivered like a leaf. It had croaked his name.
“You’ve no idea what’s happened to me,” she gritted out. “You’ve no fucking idea.”
She pulled back just as Harry stiffened. There was no use pretending she didn’t know who he was staring at over her shoulder. His eyes were wide, pupils retracted to fine points.
It wasn’t his name that stopped him but the tone of voice. He couldn’t define it. Words like ‘edgy’ and ‘cracked’ were not enough to capture the quality of it. It was many things folded into one. He stared at Harry and realised with a sense of deflation that he’d have trouble looking away.
Ginny did not miss the choice of first name. A lie, anyway. Straightforward, and uncaring of whether she missed it or not. She wished she could read his expression, but he was looking down at his hands where they rested in his lap.
“Do you think I want to do this? Any of it? I—”
Hermione thumbed through her own stack. Right to the page she needed, of course. “There are a set of old runes here that might be adapted well enough. But I don’t think aural communication is a good idea, like with Patronus messaging. If we make them contingent upon spoken spells, it would be too easy for the enemy to taint the magic. All they’d have to do—”
There was a twist to the Healer’s face, something old and cracked. Seamus saw her hands curl in her smock. “Seamus, I’m afraid that it’s only a matter of time now.”
Keeping his eyes on the hallway before him, Blaise backed into the room.
“Yes. I need to be there with him when I die.” He could say it without flinching, but Draco’s reaction was no longer under wraps, and was worse than feeling it himself. He reached out for Draco’s hand, gripping cold fingers. “When he feels the effect, that will be the time to strike.”
“Deceased,” Harry countered. “How?”
“I didn’t know,” he repeated, breathing it right against Draco’s temple. “Draco.”
“That bond was extremely rudimentary. The edges hadn’t been tempered as yours will eventually be, but the emotional upheaval would have been as great as yours, if not greater simply by virtue of having existed for a longer period of time. And without proper boundaries to rein it in, without the right sequence of events during the initial process, that emotion and the magic linked to it could very likely flood outward.”
It was becoming habit, forcing himself to remain calm, but that didn’t make it any easier. “What, he hasn’t done enough? He’s fulfilled his ‘duties.’ For Godric’s sake, Moody—”
Ginny’s freckled hand joined his. The hue of the moss seemed to flower, impossibly vibrant. Their skin looked translucent next to the rich tone. Ginny pulled away with a hiss.
“Alright.”
“No, I know that.” Blaise squeezed Draco’s fingers. “I meant… specifically. Things I wish…” Blaise’s mouth twisted downward, and everything looked all right again, only it
Remus ran a hand through his hair and sighed. “Things here haven’t been going well, then,” he said, a question and a statement. The inquiry lay in Remus’ eyes, and Harry knew it for what it was, the resigned expectance of even more hurtful news, news Remus didn’t want to hear but knew that he must. It was the way most news came nowadays.
Harry pressed his fingers to his temple. As bad as it felt, he was glad it had been Remus, who had volunteered to accompany him, and not one of the two people he had ordered into it. There was too much dissention concerning Draco Malfoy already.
Her silence hardly mattered, however; Oliver was speaking for her. “Someone has to go after him. We can’t just leave him out there to wander around. If any Death Eaters got hold of him, you know what they’ll do.”
just behind his eyes, of the incredible loss that had been visited upon him. This bloody, fucking war had done it, and it was Harry’s war, wasn’t it? Even as a baby with absolutely no control, it had been his war, and it was scything through the people he loved one by one.
Sloper’s wand dropped a touch, but Katie picked up the slack.
Ginny nodded shakily. She took two deep breaths, and then her gaze moved past him. She gave a sharp cry and lurched backward, clapping a hand over her mouth. Draco’s grip on her other wrist caught her, tumbling her onto her side in the grass. Draco whipped around and found himself a foot away from a Death Eater.
me. To my face.”
He’d dropped it… out in the hallway. When he’d—Draco dashed a hand over his face, tasting bile. House-elves. Gods, they’d known he was here and not in his own room.
Ginny sat back, mollified, and traced her memory for that strange wound in Draco’s eyes, the one that had first opened the door for her. She tried to find the falsity in it, the lapse of commitment that corroborated her conclusion.
“Who has yours, if I might ask?” Condescending.
At least her pursuer had been forced to Apparate as many times as she; his eyes would be playing tricks on him as well, and perhaps, gods, perhaps he hadn’t been able to catch the tail end of her magic this time.
Ginny jerked up, her eyes flashing. It startled Harry again; he hadn’t realised how vociferously she might wish to protect her first guardians. “Fine. They were intimate long before I came to them. And they were intimate while I was there.”
Fuck if I’m just going to hide in here and not use what I have. I can’t let anyone else die!”
want to fight for you. I want you to stay alive because you’re my friend and I love you. Harry, I’ve already lost someone I love, and I—”
Blaise forced himself into motion and staggered for the door. There was blood in his mouth, much more than a mere cut lip would leave. The flavour was different, richer. He spat over his shoulder and looked away before it hit the floor. And right in front of him—a flash of blue light—the door slammed open, letting a tall robed figure into the room.
Draco stared at him stonily, nearly wiping away the memory of his open expression a moment ago. The sweat still shone on his skin and Harry was already having trouble remembering how he’d looked. It was painful; he’d wanted that memory so badly.
“I should have known, you stupid girl,” the voice hissed. “Get out of the way.”
“Wanted to… be with you again,” Blaise forced out. Seamus froze as it flooded through the thought-words and caught him. Seized him. Petrifying to be chained so suddenly by simple sounds, but his heart felt locked up, stuttering under the pressure of Blaise’s frustration and need and… and…
“Doesn’t explain how he found us.” Jack Sloper, contemptuous. His wand was still out, held firmly in his left hand, and Harry felt ill with irritation. Sloper did not belong behind a wand. He acted like a petulant child too often for Harry’s taste.
“You’re here.” Harry’s voice held the same light that bloomed on the horizon. Cool wind touched Draco’s flesh and he inhaled.
to want such a thing from Draco.
“Sad business, Harry. Sad business.”
Fingers curled around hers, drawing her hand away from her chest. Ginny stared as Blaise gained a firmer grip on her hand. “Don’t know how relieved I am to see you here,” he said.
For one crystal clear instant, Harry was certain that all the ghosts clung to his branches as well.
Moody sat back without answering, but Harry knew he would not pursue the argument again tonight. It still surprised Harry how quickly his word had become final. And it scared him. Supposing he should make a mistake and watch them all follow him in some glorified crusade toward certain death?
Kingsley’s door was nearly shut and the light was burning inside. Harry was about to knock when a low voice came from the other side of the door.
A flicker of light brighter and quicker than thought illuminated Malfoy’s hair under his hood, followed closely by a growl of thunder. Ginny risked a look behind her into the forest. Fog had crept in around the tree trunks. She slowed. Something fluttered in the darkness between the trees. Her eyes, or…
Harry leaned forward, cursing himself as he did so. “Do you remember when you saw her dead body for the first time?”
Short(ish) chapter up tonight because a Long chapter is coming.
Hermione had no idea. Latin, she thought, but for some reason she was having trouble making sense of the words.
An orphan. His head hurt.
Hermione sat up, disoriented in the darkness. The candles had all gone out except for one in the wall sconce by the door. “Wh… Ron?”
Minerva McGonagall swept off her hat, releasing a cloud of frizzy hair. She set her pack on the ground with a thump. “They’re all in there, everything we salvaged from Grimmauld. Though I haven’t been able to peruse any of it.”
He wished he could just say the words. But they were netted by the remembered scent of Harry’s skin and the concern in those eyes. Draco pursed his lips, dangerously close to teetering off the edge. He had no idea what lay below him. “I haven’t time for this,” he said at last, horrified at what he heard creeping into his voice. Still Harry stood there, close enough to touch if Draco just reached out, felt for the slope of that shoulder. There was warmth there that he could no longer ignore, now that he’d tasted it—felt it ripple within his body,
“Yeah, well, maybe Harry trusts too easily,” Draco spat.
Dumbledore studied him. “It is the waiting that burdens.”
“He won’t wake,” Blaise answered in a tired voice. And yet he sounded so sure. She peered at him.
An hour passed.
His own thought snapped back at him, broke the flesh of his lip, singed at his eyes until he closed them.
“My mother’s dead, Potter.”
He grimaced.
The library was cool, filled with the smell of musk and dampened paper. Draco stood in the doorway for some seconds, looking at the rows and rows of dusty tomes. Floor to ceiling, so many books. He stepped inside, and the carpet swallowed the sound of his footsteps. The rain had vanished during the previous night, and clear daylight shadowed by fast-moving clouds lit the room through the windows along the far wall. Mullioned panes made the light waver on the floor like water.
he just needed, needed to—
she said. The hint of a grin crinkled the corners of her eyes.
She lunged and threw her arms around him before she knew she was going to. Blaise stiffened, his hand clinging to her elbow. And then she was
“Did we just…” Draco sounded drugged, half asleep.
“Oh, I don’t know, Malfoy, it’s just hard to reduce something like that into one sentence, yeah?” he said irritably.
“Salazar,” he hissed.
Malfoy met her smile with an eerie quirk to his own. “It’s a Siren’s Ward. Even if I did go to Voldemort, it wouldn’t do them any good. I don’t think there’s a spell in existence that can break through that ward once it’s set, unless Lovegood wishes it.”
And she could feel him, there. Though she hadn’t felt him there in years.
Ginny composed herself and walked around to the chair beside Blaise’s cot. She sat down and cleared her throat.
They did not just steal from her like this, turn everything on its head, and she had to know, had to see it rejected in his eyes. Words formed on their own.
Ginny
and time to reflect on how razor-thin the line between luck and strategy was. Blaise’s hands were climbing over Seamus’ face before he could stop them, striking out of fear and anger, caressing out of sheer need. He bit at Seamus’ lips, caught a moan in his mouth, and then suddenly he was shoved away so hard he staggered.
The day became a study in waiting, and then night spilled over and Harry fell asleep again at the table in Kingsley’s room. He’d considered going to the Infirmary to watch, but just thinking about such a vigil was too much. When he woke in the morning, it was to a room full of murmurs, people blinking in the dawn light as they waited for news. Harry’s neck hurt like hell; he winced at the sunlight coming through the window.
“No, I’m the one they can’t escape.” He was breathing too fast; couldn’t get enough oxygen. Remus frowned at him, and Harry just couldn’t control it anymore. “I sent him there! Don’t you get it? I’m the one who ordered him to go there.”
He could hear nothing over the thud of his heart, see nothing but the endless tree trunks. Ginny ran in front of him, her hood slipping off, red hair streaming behind her. His shoes slid and he righted himself. Pushed on. She looked back and caught his eye with a twisted expression.
“It kept me alive,” he hissed, suddenly frenzied. “It kept me from dying, and I should have—”
He took a steadying breath and stared into her widened eyes. “I knew, Hermione.”
*	*	*
Seamus swallowed. “Rather stay up. Talk to you.”
“Alright.” Harry straightened, then bent again and took Hermione’s hand. “I have to go. Kingsley and Hestia will have news.”
Yes, Draco Malfoy could understand Respondent Magic.
Hermione tripped again and staggered upright. The field was sopping wet and still empty, Luna’s song becoming a dirge in her head. “Why did you let him go?” she chastised herself, and the tears rose thickly into her throat. A series of bad judgments. What was the matter with her?
Harry grinned and hopped down from the banister. Wood caught sight of him. A delighted grin spread across his face.
Draco made out the warped features of Mad-Eye Moody in the torchlight. The old man glared at him, his beady eye rolling as it scanned his face and body. Draco felt the walls inside himself fall into place once more. Portcullises slamming, guarding. He drew himself back to his full height, and found he was sneering again. His chest hurt like a fresh wound.
knew it. Maybe that was why he wanted to talk to him about Nott.
“No. I don’t think you do.” He sneered again and backed off. There was an age in his face that didn’t belong, shoved on him without his permission, and beneath it, the mockery she knew far better. The fact that he might be right, that he of all people knew what it was like to be hunted, turned Ginny’s stomach. Before she knew it, she was furious.
“For what?”
He reminded himself that the Death Eaters had better things to do these days than wander aimlessly through the passages of their fortress. People to hunt. Saviours to catch. They wouldn’t even be looking for him, or anyone, down here, not unless he gave them a reason. His wand was in his hand, though he had no plans for using it just yet. Still, it felt more comfortable. Even after all these months, he was unused to leaving magic behind.
When Fred had drifted back to sleep, Harry’d led her from the hospital wing, down toward the kitchens. Ginny had been in high spirits.
Ginny moved suddenly. “They can talk to each other?”
The itch burst wide, too much heat. Harry’s lungs caught. He opened his eyes. The room was bright, beautiful, filled with light and Draco.
In the end, he did not let go.
And now, an entire day later, Ginny held George’s fingers as Fred slumbered beside her, and tried not to think. It had been easier when she’d feared for George’s life. But it was clear he was recovering, though it still came in slips and slides. Fred’s conversation had silenced her self-reflection for a time. Now there was nothing except Luna’s voice to remind her of where she was, and that Harry was somewhere nearby.
It wasn’t, confound it, but Ginny was just feeling petulant now. Her head was beginning to pound and her stomach rumbled in annoyance at nothing but stale granola. She turned her glare on the man across from her. “What? Now you don’t trust Luna?”
How had he not seen the corner he was backing himself into? Harry slowed to a stop and squeezed his eyes shut as the pressure in his head doubled. He’d thought he wanted her back in every way. And then the war had gone and changed everything, as it always did.
“How dare you!”
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. What a stupid train of thought. “You can’t very well go back now. Think of all you could have changed if you weren’t such an imbecile.”
“Once?” Pomfrey pressed. Seamus shook his head.
His fury had red hair and freckles. Green eyes. Stolen wands and twisted snakes emerging from skulls. But mostly, it possessed dirty cornsilk hair, eyes the colour of smoke… and a decisive lack of anything remotely like resolve when it counted.
On 17 January, 1999, the Death Eaters of Britain launched what was to be the final attack on St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The wards, damaged by four preceding attacks, failed for good at 4:10 am, allowing twenty-eight Death Eaters access to the lower levels. With the anti-Apparition wards down, the first two floors were overrun within moments. Several Healers took a stand lasting a little over an hour on the third floor, but were eventually overcome. Patients hiding on the fourth and fifth floors were massacred, including five suspected Death Eaters who had been brought in under Ministry guard a week prior. By the end of the attack, thirty-five employees, patients, and Aurors had been killed, with fifty-two critically wounded. Those who could be evacuated were removed to what safe locations could be found. The exact number of Death Eater casualties is unknown, but estimates range from ten to fifteen wounded, seven to ten dead.
He looked at her blankly. It was strange; he felt steadier, bolstered. He turned to the bed. His lover had not moved. Pomfrey squeezed his shoulders.
she recognised there. His skin was ashen even in the gold light and he looked at her miserably. Ginny’s mouth dropped open. There had never been a time, even in the extremes of his anger, that she had seen his walls stripped away. He probably wasn’t even aware it had happened. Now there was just a man in front of her, torn by something monumental and trying desperately to keep it locked away. Draco Malfoy… was in pain. Helplessly so.
Harry nodded. He drew a dingy caftan from the arm of the chair and spread it over his legs. “Do you… Do you ever get cold?”
“We can’t stop,” he gritted back. “We have no idea where they are.”
“Blaise Zabini is going to die.” Until he spoke the words, Harry hadn’t known what his greeting to Dumbledore would be. His former mentor gazed at him silently from his frame. Harry gritted his teeth. “There’s nothing we can do.”
“That’ll be too much for her.” Harry sounded broken, his hand hanging limp around Draco’s. “She’s already doing so much.”
“George?” she asked when she could. “What happened?”
“I want something that will allow for communication, quickly and over great distances,” Harry said as they traversed the halls together to a council meeting. Ahead, Su and Remus walked briskly, barely avoiding other castle denizens, their heads bent over crackling parchment.
Hannah’s death still felt unreal, too raw. Perhaps Hermione had come upon her too suddenly and had not had the necessary moment afterward in which to commit fact to feature. Hannah’s glassy eyes were burned into her brain, but the inevitable, ominous thud of finality had not followed; in Hermione’s mind, Hannah was only staring upward, unable to close her eyes against the rain. Waiting for something.
“Shut up!” Harry shouted. Again, everyone’s attention fixed upon him. In her corner, Tonks fidgeted but remained silent. Harry turned his attention to Malfoy. “What are you doing here?”
He put his forehead on his knees and tried to breathe, but it didn’t do much. He suddenly heard a voice calling out to him “Come on Harry, breathe. Deep breaths.” He could feel the voice take a couple of loud, deep, breaths and he tried to copy it. Slowly, he found it slightly easier to breathe.
He woke up with a pounding headache. He turned over and groaned, remembering what happened last night, or parts of it. Why had he gotten so drunk on a school night? He turned over and literally rolled out of bed and as he picked himself up off the floor, he just hoped that someone had brewed up a hangover potion.
Pansy asked, “What in Merlin’s beard is the silent treatment?” Luna laughed at her girlfriend and said, “It’s when a person doesn't talk to or ignores someone else because they are or annoyed at that person.”
As they moved on to Blaise, Theo said, “Did we mention this morning that Draco and Blaise hooked up?” At this, Blaise went bright red, and everyone laughed.
He let out a sigh of relief and gave his professor a small smile and responded, “Thank you Professor McGonagall I better be off to lunch now.” He left the room and headed down to the great hall for lunch. As he walked down the halls, he thought about what he had read earlier. As his mind wandered around his sexuality, he thought about how he would tell Ron and Hermionie about it.
Harry didn’t respond, deeming it unnecessary. The room was silent for a minute before Gregor said, “Do you know if he has a mind healer?” Harry shook his head before clarifying, “I don’t know if he has one. As far as I know, no, I’ll bring the subject up to him later.”
Harry couldn’t help but feel hurt. “You know he’s changed! He said sorry to Hermionie, he said sorry to you!”
Harry thought for a moment. Not much had happened that week, but it had been crappy. He realized something that had been weighing down on him though. “Not really. There has been something that had been weighing down on me though. Almost two weeks ago, McGonagall held me after class to talk to me about the Dursley’s. Malfoy listened at the door. When I left, I caught him. He had heard all of it. H-He told me something about his childhood, so we were even.”
Pansy just snickered and said, “I caught Theo in Draco’s room. They were dating at that point, so who cares, but the fun part is that when I mentioned the hickeys on his neck the next morning, he denied they were hickeys even after Draco had told everyone they were his own work. Those two needed to work on their communication.”
Harry meets a first year that Draco then takes a liking to.
Hermione laughed and said, “You watch him all the time, you partner with him as often as you can, and you always try to sit next to him during meals.”
As dinner came to an end, they all trekked to their common room. As they all sat down on the chairs and sofas that were facing the fire, Parkinson came over with three bottles of fire whiskey. As she sat she announced, “We are all going to have fun tonight, and learn more about each other. I’m letting you choose, Truth or Dare, or Never Have I Ever?”
Everyone laughed and Hermionie said, “We chose to come, and with someone other than them you might not fail. Plus we wanna see you hex Draco. We know if we did it to him, he would fire back, but he wouldn’t hurt you.”
Draco spoke up to answer the boy’s first questions. “Harry isn’t gay, he’s bi, which means he likes both genders. And yes, you hexed me, but it was pretty lousy, no offense.”
So I was gonna skip ahead to eighth year after last chapter, but it didn’t quite line up. I also thought a little explaining was due for that. I think that chapter ten is going to take place in eighth year. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed!
They reached their first class, potions, and everyone sat down. Slughorn then started class, “Today we are going to be starting our liquid luck potions. Everybody, please pair up.” Mostly the couples were together, minus Ron and Hermionie, but everyone else was just with their friends, and he ended up with Draco.
Smiling, Parkinson explained the rules. “If you chicken out of either a truth or dare, you take a shot. If someone brings up the war, everyone takes a shot. Got it?” Everyone nodded. Pansy smiled and said, “Good. Draco, you start.”
Draco leaned over and whispered in his ear, “So you’re a virgin?” Harry blushed and gave a quick nod in response. The blonde slipped his hand into the brunette with a soft smile. He gazed up at the blonde and felt his heart swelled with love. He still couldn’t believe that Draco liked him too. He gently cradled his boyfriend’s face and gave him a small, sweet peck on the lips.
As he methodically got prepared for bed he thought about what exactly he was going to say to his friends. He decided he would ask them to come with him to his meeting with Gregor first, and then explain why. As he drifted off into sleep, he realized that even if the last week had been crappy, he had still been happier than he’d ever been for most of it.
(See the end of the chapter for
He had told Hermione and Ron about his “family,” but he hadn’t told them about himself. He hadn’t told them that he had been depressed for years, and that he hated himself for all of it. He knew it wasn’t his fault, but he just kept thinking, I could have done better.
Harry grinned and said, “Did you know that while we were on the run, Ron and Hermione here had a huge fight? Ron even ran away from us for a couple of months. It was all because of a locket that he was wearing.”
Hermione responded, “Everyone but you and me, I believe.”
Luna looked at him thoughtfully, “I dare you to... tell us something surprising that we don’t know about you.” Oh... what should he say? There are lots of things he could say but... which one?
Ron and Hermione shot each other a glance, and Ron spoke up, “Yeah, mate. I don’t see why not.”
“That Potter kid is so lucky. I bet he’s always had stuff handed to him,” one third-year Hufflepuff whispered to their friend, who nodded in agreement.
Harry laughed and joined in on the impressions. “Turn to page three-hundred and…. ninety….four.” Harry drawled, pulling robes around him with a slight sneer on his face. Everyone laughed as they continued to imitate their old potions professor.
Harry sighed and gave a small smile, “Yeah, I know. It- it was actually kinda nice. You were the only one who didn’t treat me like the chosen one. The only one to treat me like I was just a teenager. It was kind of a relief.” Harry said with a small laugh.
Hermione piped up with her question. “What would happen if he were to have a panic attack, and we couldn’t be there to help him? I mean, I’m sure others would be not helpful.”
The thunder, too many people, trapped. He couldn’t take it.
They reached the lake, and Hermione laid down a blanket for them to sit on. That all sat down and just sat in silence for a moment. It was a comfortable kind of silence, not an awkward silence.
He hesitated, “Not really. I just hate to think about how wrong they are. It’s also one more reason I hate the papers; they would probably say it’s a ploy for attention or something. Still, it’s frustrating that people assume stuff like that.”
-Wednesday-
As he entered the library, he spotted Hermione along one of the back rows of shelves. He walked over to her and she greeted, “Good morning Harry.” He responded, “Morning Hermione. Whatcha reading?” As she picked up another book, she explained. “I’m going through some of these books and seeing if I can’t find something that could help you with your nightmares.”
Gregor stayed silent, knowing that Harry would start talking when he was ready. After a minute, Harry finally spoke up. “This week has been really busy, and honestly, really tiring. Ron and Hermionie broke up. Draco and I spent some time with a first year who tried to hex Draco. Draco and I started opening up to each other about our childhoods.”
Gregor looked at him thoughtfully and said, “It isn’t normal for one to have a lot of nightmares, but it is to be expected after experiencing traumatic events. When you woke up from the nightmare, or perhaps when you’re in a small, tight space, do you ever feel like you can’t breathe, or as if the whole world is caving in on you?”
Ron sighed and said, “Yeah, I am. I hope someone has brewed a hangover potion.” Harry smiled to himself, he had the same thought earlier.
She rolled her eyes and said, “It’s obvious. Other than the look Draco here sent me, your body language. You are sitting closer to him than you ever have before, and you walked in giggling and whispering in each other's ears.”
The two soon headed back to the common room. When the couple got there, they found an eerily quiet common room with Hermionie standing in the middle of the room on the verge of tears. Harry walked over to her, letting go of Draco’s hand. “Hey, what’s up? What happened?” She just shook her head and whispered, “Ron,” before running off.
“Okay everyone listen up!” declared Hermione. “Every one work together to make a circle in front of the fire.” Looking around, he realized people were following the directions. He stood up and walked over to where one edge of the circle was forming and sat down. How bad could it be?
Hermione then spoke up, “I’ve heard of them before. When they are upset, they sometimes fly onto your face and put their stinger in your mouth. They squirt their venom into your mouth, and it tastes like toffee.”
The blonde smiled and shook his head. Harry spoke up, “We all need to learn to forgive others and not judge them before getting to know them. The last time I saw him before the war really got bad, I used a spell that I read from some book and nearly killed him. If it wasn’t for our old potions professor, Draco might have died right there and then.”
Dean smirked and said, “Snog the person you have a crush on.”
He nodded and left with only a quick glance at his best mate. He slowly walked across the hall to Hermionie’s room. He knocked, and the door swung open. He found the two sitting on Hermonie’s bed, Draco, with his arms around Hermione, looking slightly uncomfortable. Harry almost laughed at the relief on the blonde’s face when he walked into the room, but held himself back. He walked over to the two and took over for Draco.
Well... that happened!
Frowning slightly, he said, “I’m wondering what outsiders think of me. I heard some older students in the hall talking, saying that I must’ve had everything handed to me.” He sighed.
He looked up from his feet to see Gregor’s reaction. Gregor didn’t look surprised but had a look that he couldn’t quite recognize. Gregor said slowly, “And what do Ron and Hermionie think of this?” Harry became silent and got lost in thought for a moment.
Pansy was the one to speak up about Theo. “Did you guys happen to know what happened the first night of fifth year?”
As his mind started spiraling out, he slowly drifted in to an uneasy sleep. With his mind still going crazy, he had nightmares, back to being trapped in that closet, starving, scared, the times when he had beef beaten with Uncle Vernons belt, or when Dudley would beat him to a pulp. Or Malfoy spilling to the papers, the whole world knowing about where he lived.
Harry let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. He pulled Draco into a hug, squeezing him tight. “Thank Merlin, I could calm you down. Losing control of your magic is… not good.” He waved his hand, repairing the broken things. Draco was still tensed against his chest but was slowly relaxed in the brunette’s arms, listening to Harry’s calming heartbeats.
“Well then, why don’t we fix that? Draco, you do the honors.” Draco stood up from his kneeling position and walked away, down the corridor, before coming towards them again. He did this a couple more times before the door revealed itself.
Looking a bit nervous, Malfoy said, “Because to the public we are. Together I mean,” Malfoy glanced at Pansy, who gave a tiny nod. “We both knew for a long time, second-year I’d reckon that we were bent. We both grew up in pureblood families where it was unacceptable. We never really came out; there wasn’t really a point. We are former death eaters; no one wants to date us. So, we just continued the charade to please both our families. It’s not like there's anything we can do anyway.”
I hope you enjoyed! Thank you to my beta Liiizzaabeth_Rose! I had a bit of trouble with this chapter, so I’m sure there was more to fix than usual.
Harry was surprised, though he realized that he shouldn’t have been, knowing what he knew from first year.
Ron rolled his eyes saying, “One month. If I find out he hurt you though…”
Rolling his eyes, Ron responded, “Everyone thought he was, but he wasn’t. It’s a very long story.”
Gregor spoke first. “I don’t know at all what Harry has told you, but he has what we call panic attacks.”
Harry and Draco get up to some... things, and it turns into a conversation that they really needed to have.
I hope that anybody that read this enjoyed.
“Well, he had been flirting with me since the third year, and I didn’t notice. When I figured out I was bent, he was the first one I told in sixth year. He said, ‘really, me too. I’ve been flirting with you for years.’ When he said that, I felt so bad that I hadn’t noticed. And from that day forward, we were a couple.”
Harry whooshed through the floo to Gregor’s office. Though he could apparate, he found that it wasn’t the most fun to have to walk out of the Hogwarts wards in the colder months.
Draco’s magic swirled around them, he could almost feel it. He grabbed the blonde’s hand, trying to ground him. The table in front of the chair was blown up in splinters, and Harry barely had time to throw up a protego. As soon as it was up, it came down again, all Draco’s magic in the room making it hard to keep his protego up.
As they left the classroom and headed up to Gryffindor tower, he started thinking. What all had Hermione told professor McGonagall? What would the professor do? Would he go back to the Dursley’s?
Well here you go before you get too crazy after that cliffhanger!
Harry smiled and said, “Even I can help put some color on those deathly pale cheeks. One time I caught him eavesdropping on a private conversation I had with Professor McGonagall.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Of course, Harry was the other seeker, so they had very little chance. The only way for them to win was if their chasers did better than the other teams, and their keeper would have to block a lot of shots.
“I don’t know. I-I think it’s going to be awhile. I know that he’s changed, and I’m trying, but… I’m not sure that I’ll ever be completely ok with him. I am really trying.”
At that he smiled. “Ron knows more about something than you?” He said in disbelief. Hermione giggled, “Probably.” At this, Ron walked up. “What’s so funny?” “Mate, how much do you know about mind healers?” “Well,” he reasoned, “Apparently they are like muggle counselors, but don’t trust me on that. Most work for St. Mungo’s, but not all. They are mostly there for people who need someone to talk to, and are supposed to help with coping techniques, and give good advice. Other than that, I don’t know much.”
“The manor was never my favorite place. It was always so cold, never seemed lived in. The garden was the only place I really tolerated. It wasn’t my father’s; it the only place untouched by his influence. My mother was the one who designed the gardens, it was her hobby. She didn’t do any of the dirty work, my father wouldn’t let her, but she spent almost all of her time out there.”  Harry turned to see a ghost of a smile appear on his boyfriend’s face in the mention of his mother.
“I took the dark mark the summer before sixth. It was horrible. It still is. Then, in sixth year, I was tasked by the dark lord himself to fix the vanishing cabinet. I quit trying to do anything else in my life, missing meals.” Draco paused and glanced at his boyfriend, who kissed his forehead quietly reassuring him that it was ok and that no one will ever hurt the blonde ever again.
Parkinson nodded and said, “New rule. Whatever is revealed in this room, stay in the room got it?” looking at everyone with a slight glare.
It was Sunday morning. The past week had passed by slowly, and he was so ready to see Gregor. He looked at the time, it was already 11:00. He quickly dressed, and saw that Ron must’ve already got up. He quickly got dressed and headed downstairs. He was greeted with a strange sight, usually unless it was the dead of night there was someone in the common room.
Harry looked away from the magnificent view to his boyfriend. “It’s… it's amazing. Beautiful. You’re amazing and beautiful.”
“Hey, how are you doing, Mionie?” Harry asked the curly-haired witch who was just picking on her plate
Harry sat down on one of the more comfortable chairs as he started to make sense of his emotions and thoughts, sorting them out and trying to make heads or tails on any of them.

Harry quietly said, “You just told me about the first time you were beaten by Lucius..”
As the Trio headed off to breakfast, he overheard a conversation between a couple of older students.
Hermione was next. “Umm... As you know, I’m a Muggle-born, and my parents are dentists. They take care of people’s teeth.” Looking around, a lot of people looked surprised, mostly those who grew up in wizarding families.
Harry was surprised, this was very accurate and it seemed as if Gregor had read his mind. “Yeah. Especially if space is as small as a broom cupboard, or if I wake up from the dream in the middle of it, I sometimes feel like I’m still in the nightmare. It’s a horrible feeling.”
Harry just responded with a quiet, “Yeah,” lost in his thoughts.
As everybody got up, people started heading to their rooms. Ron and Hermione had joint rooms, and Harry’s was across the hall from theirs, connecting with Blaise. Dean and Seamus have connecting rooms, and Neville and Nott were next to each other.
“I-I-I’ll be alright for now. I probably won’t stop being off until it stops raining, but we can go back to class now. I’ll be ok.”  He slowly stood up, and his legs giving out once, but,  he managed to walk back into the classroom.
Draco just smiled and said, “But I was already right here. I also assumed that you don’t want the entire class to see you breakdown, right?”
That feeling did not last. It lasted until the end of Monday, but Tuesday night he had a nightmare. He woke up to Ron shaking him, looking terrified. “Mate! Are you ok? You’ve been screaming for the last like, five minutes.” Sitting up, he saw all of the boys in the room sitting in their beds.
He went up to his room and flopped on the bed. He pulled out his homework and got through about halfway through his Transfiguration essay before Pansy quietly slipped in. He didn’t even look up when he said, “I can’t stand being friends with Harry. I want him so bad, and he doesn't know it! I hate this!”
Ron sputtered and was quick to defend himself, saying, “The locket was enchanted. Whoever was wearing it was always in a bad mood. Anyways, did anybody know that Harry has an invisibility cloak?” Harry stared at his longest friend. He had not expected this piece of information to be revealed.
They chatted for a while longer, but not really about anything important. Gregor ended the appointment by saying, “Remember to take time for yourself. You don’t need to get burned out.”
Harry talks to Gregor again.
They both gave up on seeking the snitch where they were and slowly flew back towards the middle of the pitch. It was a while longer before either of them saw that small flash of gold that they were looking for, but in the background, he could almost tell what was going on below him.
Harry has a chat.
Hermoine rolled her eyes and said that yes, she will come and that she wonders what the other two would do without her.
Stuff happens.
Gregor nodded. “If you can tell that he is going to have an attack, try to get him away from triggers, and if possible, people. I wouldn’t worry about it as much if it wasn’t Harry Potter we talked about, but we are. You don’t exactly need more publicity than you already have.”
He reached the ROR and he paced in front of the wall three times, and a big, wooden dor appeared. Harry then opened it and waited for Ron to get inside and closed the door shut. He sighed and turned. “When are you going to be ok with Draco?” He saw Ron physically droop a little.
He looked at his teacher and shifted his eyes to the ground, feeling embarrassed. “I just wanted to apologize for running out of class earlier. I had a panic attack, and as Draco phrased it so well earlier, I don’t exactly want the whole class knowing that their savior has panic attacks.”
Draco looked to his boyfriend and said quietly, “Almost seventeen.”
Harry made eye contact with the blonde and said, “One of the things I like about you is that you changed. Not that I like your past, but not everybody can change like that.”
As they slowly made their way up, they found out a lot. The Slytherins knew all the hiding places; the Ravenclaws knew where things were; the Hufflepuffs knew where the places people went to were. The Gryffindors knew where most of the practical things were. Everybody knew where the Room of Requirement was.
A blush rose on the brunette’s cheeks, “Shut up.” he grumbled with a smile.
“Yes. They lied about how my parents died. According to them, they died in a car wreck, and that’s how I got my scar. Up until about two years ago, my bedroom was the cupboard under the stairs. I got a lot of burden in the house, like cooking and cleaning. I was never allowed out of my room when there were guests, though my cousin, Dudley was. He was always the favored. He also beat me up a lot, even going as far as breaking bones a couple of times.”

As the night progressed, he sought Pansy out. He said quietly to her, quietly enough that no one could hear him, “I’m going up to my room. When you have had enough of snogging Luna’s face off, I want to talk to you.”
The game continued until Gregor knocked the tower over. They played once more, before Gregor looked at his watch, and said, “Well, it’s late. You should get back to Hogwarts. I hope to see you in a week?” Harry smiled and nodded, and (a bit nervously) walked into the fire.
Draco smiled, and a comfortable silence once again washed over them, which was once again broken by Draco started speaking softly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Slowly, as Harry figured out who he was to the wizarding world, he found out why he kept hearing his name in the halls. His first month went smoothly, or at least as smoothly as is seemed possible for “The Chosen One.”
He reached the common room and found Draco. They walked down to the Great hall and sat down on the bench together. Pansy and Luna sat down across from them, before Pansy squealed and said, “I knew it! Welcome to the gay fam Harry!”
Draco smiled said, “Wandless magic isn’t as hard as it seems when you start. A wand, like a broom, is just a  way to channel your magic, rather than magic itself. It does take some practice and training, but I bet that if you really put your mind to it, you could do some simple spells wandless this year.”
Their first day back, he was surprised. The castle looked much the same, though he had seen it at its most broken. This year, all of the eighth years shared a common room, and each had their own space, though two people shared a bathroom. The bathrooms connected two of the rooms, a door on each end of the toilet, so the teachers let them pick their own rooms.
They all stepped into the fire in succession and popped out in Gregor’s office. Gregor, as always, spun around and said, “Hello Harry! And you two must be Ron and Hermione.” He added, shaking their hands.

"I wanna fuck his mouth." Cormac stared at Harry, licking his lips at the thought of being buried in that throat, feeling Potter gag around his massive cock.

“Corny?” A wizard squeezed his way out of the crowd, his hair fell in artful red waves to his shoulders. He was as beautiful as Cornwaella was. “Time to go, I think—” He caught sight Harry, hand still pressed to Cornwaella’s baby bump. “What—?”

After a moment searching for her wand amongst her discarded robes, Luna cast a cushioning charm under Hermione, making it as if the stone were the world's most comfortable bed.
The man’s body was thick and soft, pressed against Harry’s legs and ass. Labored panting came from above Harry. It strongly reminded him of Dudley or Vernon when their larger bulks would move atop him.
And right behind him was Ginny, sullen and glaring at him, tits jiggling as she marched after Cormac.
"Um—" Cormac tried to interject, jacking his cock with a speed that made Harry dizzy to look at, but Ginny wasn't having it, cutting him off with a fierce glare as she worked herself frantically on Harry's cock.

"What do I have to do to put you in place?" She twisted viciously at Harry's nipples.
Harry arched awkwardly into the pain. It edged him closer to nowhere, any orgasm cut off by the spell Cormac had hobbled him with.
They were all trapped inside.
The pair squeezed into the crowd, leaving Harry standing by the table of impatiently dancing hors d'oeuvres, alone and feeling it quite keenly.
The boy was filthy, his pale skin streaked with dried cum.
Potter licked that up too.
"I'm trying to
"That's good," Luna whispered. "A little more? You can always stroke what you can't reach with your hand. A little tighter— that's it..." She groaned as Hermione took her advice, getting eager as she pleasured Luna. "That's it..."

turn for a taste." He yanked Harry against his very well-toned body, capturing Harry's lips in a heated kiss.
“Do love potions even work if you aren’t attracted to that person’s gender?” Harry mussed as he turned a few pages in his potions book. The Prince would know the answer to that.
Potter pulled off of Malfoy’s cock with a gasp, back arching, coming completely untouched all over himself and the floor.
Severus leaned down to capture Potter's lips, showing the boy who owned him. It mattered not how many cocks Potter spread his legs for, how wantonly he took them all. The boy was
Hermione pulled away from Luna's heated kiss, her breathing shaky as she dropped her head back against the wall they were snogging against.

Not even Slughorn’s subtle gropes were holding Harry’s attention anymore in the face of it all, and
"Is this ok?" Very slowly, Luna's tongue slid over the hard nub, then circled it, lapping at it hard, then circling, circling, getting the material of her bra soaked with spit.
Reeling, Harry tried to crawl away. Cormac kicked at his arm, knocking Harry onto his face. His nose hurt, but at least it wasn’t bleeding. He tried crawling away again. Cormac kicked his legs apart, was between them an instant later and driving his cock in to the hilt, his hands tight around Harry's hips to keep him in place while Cormac took his pleasure.
“What was that?”
"Yeah...I had a weird dream too," Harry said, unsure if everything he fuzzily recalled was really a dream at all.

And how beautiful he was despite it all.
With that, Harry dove back into his half-brilliant, half-hopeless potions essay, absently wondering if the Prince had ever gotten laid. No one could be this good at potions and still have the time to get his cock wet.
Potter looked up at him, dazed.

Tugging at the bra forced Hermione's breast to spill out, baring it to the world until Luna enveloped the nub again, suckling gently at it.
She pulled her hands away from Luna, suddenly very unsure despite the throb in her own loins that begged for

Horace had perfected the potion during his initial tenure at Hogwarts. It was rumored that he would break in Slytherin first years with it (and perhaps those of other houses). Watching Horace cant Potter's hips, efficiently getting him at an angle that made the boy whimper even while unconscious made Severus quite sure that the rumors had basis in fact. He seemed rather adept in fucking the dubiously willing.
