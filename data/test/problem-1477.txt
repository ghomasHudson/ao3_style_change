Voldemort. He shook his head slightly to rid his mind of that particular path of thought. It made more sense now, why Draco was determined to keep making Oaths and Vows to him, and why Narcissa had so quickly acquiesced to coming under Harry’s protection. He frowned. Why hadn’t Draco mentioned the right of conquest? Harry found it hard to believe that he simply didn’t know – he was far too clever and calculating for that. Did he think Harry would be like Voldemort, if he knew of his power? Harry sighed and rubbed his scar again. He needed a drink. “How do I find Rabastan and Rodolphus?” he asked. “There must be a way for a Lord to call on his vassals.”
The three made their way inside. Harry could hardly see five feet in front of him, due to the cloud of dust that had enveloped the room. Keeping close to the wall, they advanced slowly, stopping as they reached a body.
Years ago – even half a year ago – Harry would have let Malfoy’s words rile him up, but now all Harry could think about was the man’s insinuation that he cared for Harry. Instead of commenting, however, he simply nodded.
Harry shrugged, happy enough with that reasoning. “Thank you, Kreacher. Can you please take these to the Post Office and have them sent out?” he asked, handing over the letters. “You won’t have to send anymore once I get an owl,” he promised.
Making his way upstairs, he knocked on Ginny’s door. After no response, he pushed it open slowly, calling her name.
Hermione rolled her eyes but conceded. “The modification I found is very similar to a marriage bond. It’s from ancient Rome meant for masters to marry their indentured slaves, which is incredibly immoral, but, also, means that you might have a transfer of feelings. Definitely not thoughts, but probably feelings. And, you’ll be able to communicate with each other telepathically.”
“Hands on my shoulders,” Malfoy said, as he held her waist, lifting her easily and turning in a circle. When he returned her safely to the ground, he murmured, “Go with me, Granger,” and dipped her backwards, one hand on the back of her neck. When they returned to standing, Hermione was bright pink. “Right, that’s the first half,” Malfoy said. “Weasley, Potter, your turn.”
“Oh hell. I forgot. Are you okay?” Harry asked. He scratched the back of his neck. He didn’t particularly fancy ordering Draco around all the time.
Hermione deflated. “No.” At their looks she perked up and started to explain. “Malfoy how many life-debts do you owe Harry?”
Harry shrugged. “Do you know if you can drink caffeine if you’ve had Pepper Up?” he asked suddenly, remembering Malfoy’s talent for potions.
“Happily,” Harry promised. He did not care to see the person he considered his sister in that position.
Harry shook his head. “Later.” He moved into the first cell, running a finger over the instruments lying on a bench.
Malfoy coughed, drawing their attention. “Grannuff, please arrange for the gold to be kept in the separate vaults for each House. Are you able to remove all of the artefacts to a separate place without touching them?” he asked. At Grannuff’s confirmation, he nodded. “Please do so at your earliest convenience.” Turning to Harry, he added, “I don’t think you should touch any of the artefacts in those vaults until a Curse-Breaker has gone through them all.”
Harry couldn’t wipe the smile off his face for the rest of the morning, even as he was changing Teddy’s nappy.
Malfoy nodded. “The Old Council are the heads of the Families. The Sacred 28, essentially. It meets once a month, except for in war time. I’ve been a few times as an heir but this is the first time I’ll go as a Head. There’s a meeting for about an hour, which is dedicated to politics and magic. Essentially, everybody decides how they’ll vote in upcoming matters of state. This month will probably be about the Statute of Secrecy and the Dementor’s Kiss.”
“Right, yes,” Hermione startled into action. “Well, I obviously don’t condone taking children away from their parents, but I understand their concerns. Anyway, with all the changes Dumbledore made to centuries old laws, combined with the overall weakening of magic, the purebloods got angry, scared and defensive. That’s how Grindelwald rose to power and that is how Voldemort rose to power. Just because Voldemort is dead, doesn’t mean the issue’s closed.
“Seriously, Harry. I’ve never seen magic like it,” Hermione commented as she buttered her bread. “When did you get so good at wandless magic?”
Harry swallowed. Kingsley hadn’t said anything directly, but Harry knew that he’d expected them to kill him. Harry closed his eyes. Could he do it? He glanced down at the wand in his hand. The Death Stick, it was called. Harry wasn’t Voldemort – he couldn’t cast AK. With the Unforgivables, you have to want it to work, and Harry wasn’t sure he really wanted to kill Greyback.
,” Harry cast, revealing a large dark red shield. Harry blinked. Although it was plainly obvious that both were constructed of similar magic, these wards were entirely different from those at Hogwarts. Instead of defensive and protective like the one at Hogwarts, this was overtly offensive. Harry could feel the malignant magic radiating off it deep in his gut.
“The next bit we do is essentially a grapevine. Potter, Weasley, you will be on your partner’s left, holding their hand with your right. We stand in a circle,” Malfoy instructed, grabbing Harry’s hand and pulling him so that they were standing opposite Hermione and Ron.
Another letter was from McGonagall, thanking the Harry, Ron and Hermione for their help at Hogwarts over the past few weeks, as well as an additional thank you to Harry for the significant donation he had made. To be totally honest Malfoy had organised all of it, and Harry had just signed off on it. Nevertheless, it felt good to be doing something helpful for a change. A further donation had been made to St. Mungo’s for those injured during the battle.
“Besides Ron, Hermione will be making enough money for the both of you as Minister or something,” Harry teased.
Several hours, three chess games, and two bottles of elvish wine later, Ron was on the floor roaring with laughter as Hermione shot-gunned a beer. Malfoy looked at her with thinly veiled disgust.
Harry glanced at Ron, who was clearly on Harry’s side, but trying to look like a supportive boyfriend. He smiled softly at Hermione. “I know you don’t want me to get hurt, but I’m their target anyway. If I don’t do this, they’ll end up hurting me anyway,” he reasoned.
Harry made his way to his locker and opened it. Inside, along with his backpack and another pair of shoes that he’d brought the other day, a black vest had magically appeared.
Harry blinked in surprise. He had almost forgotten. He nodded once and turned back to Greyback. “Imperio,” he cast easily.
Proudfoot sighed. “Well, it’s nowhere near as good as British quidditch,” he said, ignoring Kai’s yelp of indignation, “but since there are no professional games in Britain until next week, I’ve had to make do. Are you going to the Arrows vs. Wasps game?”
About an hour later, Teddy started to cry with boredom. Harry hadn’t realised how long he’d been standing there. He held his concentration just in case the threads snapped as soon as he let go, but after a few tentative steps back they remained intact. With relief, he turned to Hermione and Ron.
“Right, let’s get down to business,” Hermione said, standing up, and Harry very gratefully gave up the attention of their small group to her. “Draco?”
“You too, Professor Lupin,” Hermione said, feeling very weirded out by calling a teenager ‘Professor’.
“That’s how Lucius knew that the diary would open the chamber of secrets,” Harry muttered. It had confused them all when Lucius was interrogated. He had no knowledge of horcruxes. Bellatrix must have told him what to do with it. “Thank you, Bella. Let us through to the dungeons now. I will come back to speak with you later.”
Harry nodded, but didn’t make a move to go in. “I think I’m scared I’m turning into Him,” Harry said after a minute.
Draco looked at him curiously. “I appreciate your concern, Potter. I really do. And yes, it will be uncomfortable, and I will hate every moment of it, but that is not what I was talking about. We are walking into a war council, because every person in there is fully aware that you tortured and killed Fenrir Greyback,” he said in a matter-of-fact tone.
“Sorry,” he apologised to no one in particular. He re-erected the ward quickly with a wave of his hand (making sure that the ward would grant Draco access), before turning to face everyone.
“Merlin’s tits, this is like watching kink negotiation,” Seamus scoffed, ignoring Dean’s elbow as it jabbed into his side. “Right, enough with all that. Let’s get drunk and talk about taking over the world.”
“Can’t apparate inside the Ministry, Harry,” Hermione reminded him gently, but she was looking a bit green too. “Maybe Kingsley will let us use his floo again.”
Proudfoot, Savage and Kai were arguing loudly over some quidditch match between two American quidditch teams.
Kingsley nodded. “I’ll think about it. I’m sure we can come up with something apart from the Fidelius in the long term. In the meantime, though, I really think you should reset it. If nothing else, just for my peace of mind.”
“Young Master Malfoy is talking to me. Is telling me that Master is trying to bring back the Old Ways. Is telling me that Master is Lord Black and that I should be treating Master with more respect, he is,” Kreacher explained. “Master Malfoy is also saying that Mudblood Mistress is not trying to take me away from Master. Just is wanting to make sure I is doing what I is wanting. I is not understanding this, but I is appreciative.”
The highpoint of Malfoy’s cheeks flushed pink. “Well, since we’re both your unofficial secretaries, it seemed prudent to be friendlier. Besides, Hermione is a good name. It’s a character in Shakespeare, you know. Fits her well actually – she’s just as virtuous and beautiful as her namesake. Stronger though – I can’t imagine Granger dying of heartbreak any time soon, can you?”
Before he could chicken out, Harry lifted a hand to the back of Malfoy’s head, memorising the feeling the soft hair at the nape of his neck, and leant forward. Malfoy was soft beneath his body, and went easily as Harry dipped him, like putty in his hands.
Harry pulled her in for a hug, and, after a moment’s hesitation, pulled in Ron too. “Let’s get out of here, yeah?” he asked.
Seamus and Dean had written with an invitation to their engagement party. Harry was thrilled for them. A lot of people had been getting married recently, Harry supposed the war had made everyone realise just how short life was. Ron, Harry and Neville were to be their best men.
“Ron, I want you to be happy. You do whatever you want to do. I think you’ll be a fantastic businessman,” she said firmly.
The three of them had been living together for almost nine months. Before that, Harry and Ron had nearly always shared a bedroom. Harry wasn’t sure how he’d feel when he was suddenly alone.
Harry was taken aback. “Luna and Xenophilius? But- “Harry trailed off. He didn’t want to mention the whole imprisoning of Luna thing.
Hermione smiled tiredly. “Nothing bad. Just reporters wanting me to answer some questions. A few had ‘volunteered’ with McGonagall to help with the rebuilding, but really they just wanted an excuse to get closer.”
“You’re welcome, Lord Malfoy,” Harry smiled. “Now, onto other business,” he said, folding the sheet of paper with his new family’s names carefully before putting it in his pocket.
Remus, no doubt sensing the heightened emotions and wanting to ease the tension, broke the silence. “Ron, Hermione,” he nodded at the two. “Good to see you.”
“You should,” Malfoy said. “If it’s possible, you should host the Pledge and the Ball there. I assume you have a Ballroom?” he drawled aristocratically.
“Oh Bellatrix, you clever bitch,” Harry said as they got to the bottom of the stairs. A large painting of the witch, albeit much younger, smirked at them from the brick wall that faced them.
“You too, Molly,” Harry smiled genuinely. Something about being in the Burrow made him so happy, even if it was tinged with grief these days. “Hope Teddy was alright?”
Robards eyed him for a few more moments, and Harry could feel him still probing around in his head. “Stand up,” Robards said eventually, pulling back from his assault on Harry’s mind.
Harry smiled, thanking Kreacher as he cracked in with a bottle for Teddy. “Can I come too? Not that I know what to look for, but it’ll be fun.”
“But when it comes time for – for the end of this evening,” Hermione continued. “I don’t want to be there.” She didn’t want to see her two best friends become murderers.
Robards let out a chuckle. “Fair enough.” He glanced down at his notes, before nodding. “Alright, Potter, you can join the task force. I’m not a huge fan of your plan, but I think it’ll be our best chance at drawing them out. Come for training tomorrow and I’ll introduce you to the team,” Robards said, rising to shake Harry’s hand.
Malfoy barked out a laughed. “You’ll be glad to hear my father is no longer around to mistreat his house-elves, Roslyn.”
Malfoy nodded his agreement. Suddenly, Hermione gasped. Ron and Harry groaned. At Malfoy’s confused look, Ron explained, “That’s Hermione’s I-just-had-an-idea gasp.” Hermione elbowed him. Ron turned to look at her. “Ow. Am I wrong?”
“Hey, mum,” George said quietly, wrapping her in a hug. Harry was thrilled. The war had broken so many hearts, and destroyed so much, but they were slowly healing.
“Of course,” Grannuff said, looking mildly offended. “Lord Potter has inherited several, including this one,” he said as he produced another roll of parchment.
Harry smiled slightly. Malfoy’s laugh was deep and musical, and Harry didn’t think he’d ever heard it before. He shrugged. “She was always hanging over you at Hogwarts.”
Looking at Hermione questioningly, she explained. “Ron has decided, instead of pursuing his education, to join George at the shop,” she looked mildly disapproving, but Harry knew she was secretly pleased. Glancing at the brothers, Harry realised he hadn’t seen either of them look so happy and relaxed in years.
“Thank you,” Harry hesitated. “I’d appreciate it if this was not offered to Ron. He deserves every opportunity to join the training program – he more than deserves that – but I don’t want to put him into danger if he’s not properly trained.”
Harry nodded. He didn’t point out that he was the reason that they’d been camped out there in the first place.
Harry rolled his eyes and immobilised him before the werewolf could say anything further. He grabbed the man by his shoulder and Ron took his other side. “See you later,” he called to Bill and Hermione. “You’ll have about two minutes to fix the wards before the alarm sounds. Good luck.” Harry closed his eyes and pictured the dungeons in Grimmauld Place and tapped the ring on his right hand with his wand. Harry felt a familiar tug in his stomach and then a piercing headache as he tore through the wards of the Ministry of Magic.
“We have managed to locate the blueprints for the warehouse,” Cragg said. “It last went for sale in 1968, so we can assume it has some pretty powerful protections over it, probably made by Voldemort himself. We should be prepared to have to perform blood sacrifice to see the building.”
Hermione and Ron both loved when they got takeout, so Harry excused himself from the three people in his living room. Hermione and Malfoy were nose-deep in parchment again, and Ron was feeding with Teddy. He ran upstairs to change into muggle clothes. As he made his way to the front door, he paused. “I’ll be back. Do you like spicy food, Malfoy?”
Ron and Hermione gasped as they entered the wards. “Bloody hell, mate,” Ron laughed, clapping him on the back. “You’ve got a bloody castle!”
Hermione raised an eyebrow at Harry, glancing at the very vulnerable infant bouncing on his lap, before escorting Narcissa out of the room, asking a vague question about Pledging ceremonies. Harry considered for a minute before shaking his head and regretfully handing his godson back to Ron. It felt like eons since he had spent quality time with Teddy, but he really didn’t think he should be present for this particular conversation.
Hermione waved Malfoy off, but looked slightly pleased. “You’ve got a meeting with Kingsley at 10, and then your needed at Hogwarts to help repair the wards. After lunch you’re free.”
Savage smiled. “At Hogwarts, he used to be able to eat five slices of toast before the eggs even arrived at Breakfast.”
Ron nodded, looking almost as pale as the body drained of blood between them, and made his way quietly up the stairs. Bill came down a moment later.
Harry frowned, “Bonding sounds really extreme though, doesn’t it? It sounds like we’re going to be connected.”
“I was meant to be Slytherin, according to the Hat,” Harry said. “But I don’t think I’m particularly ambitious or cunning.”
Malfoy nodded. “That’s what my father joined for, originally. At least, I think. Also, because the Dark Lord was crazy powerful, and it was suicide in Slytherin house to go against him.” He looked at them. “Don’t get me wrong, he knew what he was doing. He didn’t have any qualms about killing muggleborns. He wasn’t a good person by a stretch of the word.”
“What do you know of Jugson and the remaining death eaters?” Harry asked. Greyback struggled to answer and, for a moment, Harry worried that the spell was breaking.
When they got back to Grimmauld Place, Ron was playing piano. Hermione was spending the morning at Hogwarts, helping with the rebuilding effort.
“I just need a few minutes,” he said quietly in the vague direction of the living room. Scooping Teddy up, he walked in silence to the nursery.
Malfoy looked up in surprise. “We’re eating in here? Why? You have a perfectly good dining table in the kitchen.”
Ron made for his wand, but Harry stopped him. “He was joking, Ron. Well, not really, but he wasn’t threatening us.”
“Why would we discuss the Statute of Secrecy?” he asked, not wanting to think about the Dementors any longer than strictly necessary.
“No offence, Harry, but you’ve been obsessed with him for forever. I could have told you when we were fifteen,” she grinned and dragged him into the kitchen, where Ron was buttering some toast.
“Yes, I think I might be familiar with the dangers of the public when yours is a household name,” Draco said wryly. Harry realised he probably didn’t want to go out in wizarding London either, after what had happened on Friday. “I shall meet you outside Angel station.”
Harry cleared his throat as he looked away. Ron and Hermione were gazing at each other in a way that Harry had never see them do before. Ron closed the distance between their lips and planted a sweet lingering kiss on her lips. Malfoy and Harry glanced at each other, and both looked away with embarrassment when their eyes met.
Ron grinned. “Well, if Hermione and I had one, I could live with you. She could live with us on the weekends. I mean, we’d have to ask McGonagall, but she’s hardly going to say no – not to Hermione. I could apparate into Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley to work in the shop.”
Harry frowned. He’d seen the Lovegood’s house and didn’t imagine they had much to share. “I will provide Narcissa with an allowance. And I’ll pay you for your work.”
“Fine. At the very least have him make a Wizard’s Oath,” Hermione said. “It doesn’t have any consequences for him, but we’d feel it if he broke it. We’d have time to…” She trailed off.
Just then, Jugson shot a blasting curse at Harry. He instinctively ducked and the curse rocketed above him. The curse blew the wall apart, the force of it knocked Harry off his feet. He found himself flat on his face in the rubble. He tried to get back up, but then, to his horror, a heavy boot slammed down on his wand arm, pinning it down. He looked up to see a wand pointe at his noise. The Death Eater stood over him, glaring down, malice flashing in his eyes.
McGonagall gestured for them to follow. “Quite well, Mr. Potter. I hardly think you need to call me Professor anymore. You too, Mr. Weasley.”
Kreacher nodded, still looking a bit shocked. Harry could sympathise. An hour ago, he was begging an infant to go to sleep, complaining that his life was hard. Now, he had an injured death eater in his guest bed and a couch covered in blood.
Harry made a noise that could be considered affirmative, stuffing his face with some chicken, hoping she wouldn’t press him for more information. Thankfully, she didn’t, although she looked at him suspiciously.
He heard Hermione’s gasp and didn’t turn around. “I need dittany and blood-replenishing potions,” he called out rather desperately.
Elfie answered. “It depends who we get and who we don’t. If we get a Lestrange, the other would be very volatile and wouldn’t wait around to lick his wounds. He’d aim for a public attack with the aim of bringing a lot of people down with him. To a lesser extent it’d be the same with Crabbe and Goyle. It’ll be easy to take them down if they’re angry, but a lot of potentially innocent victims.”
Ginny paused. After a moment, she picked up the mugs and resumed making the coffee. “Did they deserve it?” she asked.
The werewolf reached for the paper with a shaky hand. From the warring emotions in the man’s eyes, Harry could tell that he was struggling to fight the order.
When it was just the three of them, Harry reached for his wand and cast every privacy spell he could think of. He was keen to follow Cragg’s advice to develop his wandless magic, but there was something comforting about the certainty of a spell cast with a wand.
Harry sighed and drained the last of his coffee, before making his way to the kitchen and touching the door to the basement. Bella was waiting for him.
Harry shrugged. He didn’t think he was particularly clever, just often underestimated. “Do you have any other portraits?” he asked.
Harry nodded. The two never really talked about their emotions, unless they were yelling at each other - part of what Hermione called their ‘toxic masculinity’ - and knew Ron was feeling uncomfortable being so vulnerable. “I don’t want to live by myself,” Harry said quietly. “I know you want to live near Hogwarts, so you can see Hermione. I’ll get used to it. I’ll just miss you both.”
Malfoy and Ron shuddered. Hermione just rolled her eyes. “Do you really think we’d let you do something like that? It’s fine, Harry, you just have to be really specific with the wording.”
The witch blinked in surprise. “Good memory. Poor kid. Dennis has been living with us in France since the end of last year. He’s starting Beauxbaton’s this year. Colin got him to us when their parents died.”
“Nothing,” Hermione said calmly. “It has to do with wizarding tradition. No offence, but you have no idea what you’re doing.”
“Of course,” Malfoy said nonchalantly. “It’s what any sane person would do. Bloody Gryffindor,” he added the last bit under his breath.
Harry blushed, and turned his attention to feeding Teddy, who was impatiently shoving his fingers into his mouth.
Without waiting for them to react, Harry drew his wand at began working on the wards. He didn’t have much knowledge of this kind of technical magic, but Hermione had done a lot of research and explained it in detail to him.
She rolled her eyes. “I’ll look into it. I won’t be your secret keeper, though,” she said firmly. Hermione would always stay true to her morals.
Kreacher’s eyes filled with tears almost instantly. “Master Harry is kind,” he croaked. “Kreacher is wanting to stay in House of Black and serve Mistress Black and Master Malfoy, if Master Harry is not needing him.”
” Teddy stirred on his chest. Since Harry had first met him, he’d been reacting very strongly to magic. Harry couldn’t blame him – there was nothing quite like the feeling of magic in the air when a powerful charm was cast.
“Nah, mate, you were perfect. Put those bastards in their place. A lot of them volunteered to help after that.”
A few hours later, Harry was attempting to bathe his godson. Teddy cried every time he got his hair wet, but Harry had discovered a spell in one of Mrs. Weasley’s old books that died babies instantly. Bracing himself for the tears, he scooped up a bit of water to dribble onto the shock of bright blue hair but faltered when he heard Kreacher’s voice.
Harry nodded absently, his mind already filled with thoughts of vassals and lords. “Have you ever heard of the right of conquest before?” he asked as he dressed quickly in the robes Hermione thrust at him. “I think we may be able to find the Lestranges with it.”
“According to tradition, a Lord’s vassal must obey and serve their master, and follow them into battle. If their Lord is defeated, they become the vassal of the victor,” Bellatrix said matter-of-factly, almost sounding bored. “They must either swear allegiance to their new Lord or be disposed of in a manner of which the Lord sees fit.”
Malfoy sighed sadly. “It’s not just a saying, you know. Our magic becomes weaker if we don’t provide it with the proper respect.”
Malfoy shrugged. “No, but most pureblood children learn how to drink in other cultures, especially if they are the cultures of the other Sacred 28. As your elf said, the Malfoys and Potters have always been neighbours. It is only natural that the Potters would learn a bit of French and the Malfoys would learn a bit of Hindi.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know,” he said honestly. He could have easily stunned and tied up Jugson without using the Cruciatus curse. He glanced down at the wand still clutched in his hand. He hadn’t used the Elder Wand to cast it, either. With a few cursory checks, the Ministry could easily confirm that he’d used an Unforgivable. He glanced up at Robards.
Harry frowned. Since when had Kingsley be concerned with image? Figuring that he got his way, he decided not to push it. “Well, I have to get to Hogwarts to help with the rebuilding. Thank you for meeting with me, Kingsley.”
Harry grinned, plopping down next to her, and chucking her the quaffle. “Sorry,” he said, completely unapologetically. “How’s training going?”
Harry sighed. “I have to admit, Kingsley, I haven’t had much of a chance to think about it.” He didn’t mention that he hadn’t thought he’d have a future, as those sorts of comments tended to make people upset.
Draco looked surprised but shook the offered hand without hesitation. He turned to everybody else. “Despite Longbottom’s generosity, I am not worthy of your forgiveness. I know I’ve already said this all in letters already, but I think it needs to be said out loud. I wasn’t just a right dickhead, Potter. I was a terrorist and a racist. Nothing I will ever do will atone for the sins I committed against you, against Muggles, against the Wizarding World and against humanity,” he said gravely.
Teddy gurgled in his arms and, as he took his seat in an old armchair, he bounced the baby with his knee.
Bill rolled his eyes. “Harry, my job puts me at risk. I was at risk during the war. What makes you think I crave a quiet life?”
Kingsley gasped. “A blood ward? That’s incredibly dark magic. Although, I suppose Dumbledore wouldn’t have resorted to such drastic measures unless absolutely necessary.”
“Filth! Scum! By-products of dirt and vileness! Half-breeds, mutants, freaks, begone from this place! How dare you befoul the house of my fathers--" the portrait screeched as soon as the curtains parted.
Kingsley sighed, closing his eyes again. “I know we just spoke of me not being corrupt, but I- you should know that the ministry cannot identify what spells you cast with the Elder Wand,” he said after a moment.
Savage cast a location spell. “Yep perfect. Just of the A382. The warehouse should be about half a mile north-east.”
“Love can make people do terrible things,” Malfoy shrugged. “Anyway, don’t expect me to refer to Weasley by anything other than his last name, unless you want me to demonstrate my proficiency at coming up with fantastic insults. Besides, learning his first name would require me knowing which of the red-head brood he actually is.”
“Good,” Cragg said, nodding approvingly. “Keep practising. In fact, try not to use your wand for the rest of the week. If you can start to will things to happen, your magic will get even stronger.”
Malfoy gave him a distinctly weird look. “I didn’t think you’d want to do that. I sent him a letter. He’ll probably want to grieve alone tonight, anyway. I’ll stop by tomorrow.”
“It’s quite alright, Grannuff. Ms. Granger and Lord Malfoy will understand it much better than I will,” Harry smiled. “They are my…” he trailed off, not sure what to say. Friends? Hermione, certainly. Malfoy, not so much.
Firstly - thank you for all the lovely comments! I've never written this much of a story before, and I have to say I hit a bit of writer's block this week. Your comments helped a lot.
“Oh good, you’re ready,” Hermione said, noticing Harry. “Ron and I are going to drop off Teddy. Can you side-along with Draco? You have a concussion and I don’t want you apparating on your own.”
Harry looked at him with trepidation. “I don’t know, Malfoy,” Harry said, biting his lip. “I don’t even know how to dance.”
“Of course. I’m pleased to hear that Ms. Granger is returning. I have to admit, I’m hardly surprised at any of your decisions, though,” McGonagall said wryly. “I thought I should mention that if you would like to take your NEWTs, you can still sit the examinations with the other seventh and eighth years in June next year if you still wish.”
Harry and Ron made for the glass door. Greyback was sitting at a desk, his hands in silver chains, smirking at them.
“Yeah, he’d been attacked. Snape had given him a portkey to use to go to a safe place if ever he was in danger and too injured to apparate. He didn’t know I lived there,” Harry explained. “It made me realise that I have no idea how many people have access to my house.”
Harry jutted out his chin. “Fine, I’ll give Narcissa double. I have more than enough, and you don’t. Besides, aren’t you the Lord of the Malfoy House.”
Malfoy nodded. “Make sure there’s a pond or fountain nearby the bonfires. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.” At Harry’s confused look, he explained. “On Midsomer’s, everyone writes their wish for the year on a piece of paper and places it in the bonfires. At midnight, the fires go out, and every collects a piece of charcoal, which you wear for the rest of the month to bring good luck to you in the coming year.”
Harry felt mildly defensive. “No one took the time to explain it to me.” He glanced at the others at the table, and took his seat, feeling they were going to be here a while. “Since it’s so important, someone take the time now,” he demanded.
Thirdly - speaking of uni, I'm really sorry it took me so long to update. I have had a bucket load of assignments to do - to be honest, I still have a lot of work to do but I wanted to procrastinate. If only research essays were as easy to write as silly fanfictions.
“Noted,” Harry said, grateful for the excuse to collapse into a seat at the end of the table. “How’ve you both been?”
He released their fingers and Harry spun him out, perhaps a touch more forcefully than he should have. Malfoy took it in his stride and continued the twirl under Harry’s arm without prompting. Pulling Harry’s hand to his waist, Malfoy held his breath. Harry could feel the blond’s hip bones jutting out from his torso. Lifting Malfoy was easier than lifting a broomstick, but the move brought their closer together than any fight had at school. Harry could feel Malfoy’s cool breath on his lips.
“Of course you do.” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “You’ll need to invite the Sacred 28, and all of the people that belong to those Houses. Not to mention your connections at the ministry, a few representatives of the press, and all of your friends.”
“Merlin give me strength,” Harry heard Malfoy mutter under his breath. The fireplace chimed, and Malfoy snatched Harry’s wand from his pocket. “Go and get the proper one. I’ll greet the goblin. Be quick about it,” he ordered, and paced off to the living room angrily.
Harry blinked. “Why does everyone think I’m hell-bent on killing all Death Eaters all of a sudden?” he asked, feigning curiosity. He’d never been a particularly good actor, but it was important for him to find out how much the Auror’s knew of his involvement last night.
Ron sighed. “Well, this will work for tonight. It’s certainly got the right ambience. Are you really going to torture him with these things, Harry?”
Harry nodded and took off his robes, slipping the vest over his shirt. It warmed and stretched and tightened until it fit him like a glove. The almost tight pressure around his chest was almost calming in a way. Grounding. He slipped his robes back over his shoulders.
Watching Ron’s reaction, McGonagall’s lips quirked, although she still managed to hide her smile. “Well, perhaps I shall leave that up to you to decide.”
Harry could hardly breathe throughout the whole tour. He’d never really had a home before, and suddenly he had a whole castle. From the Hall of Mirrors, a wide central staircase lead to: the library, with decoratively carved bookcases lining two walls and an impressive floor to ceiling stone fireplace; a small but beautifully decorative study with even more books, and the dining room, with a wide bay stone mullioned window and an ornately carved stone fireplace. Returning to the Hall of Mirrors, they were lead to the drawing room, a light and airy room with windows offering sweeping views of the gardens, a large fireplace, a fine ceiling with ornate carved and gilded decoration, and easy access to the gardens via the adjoining Fernery and a secondary kitchen. Upstairs, there were two impressive Principle Bedroom Suites offering views over the gardens and the countryside beyond, as well as seven additional en-suite bedrooms.
“Yeah, well, I don’t want to get away with anything,” Harry said. “I just want to live a fucking normal life.”
Harry carefully schooled his expression so that he could have time to think. It was fundamentally wrong what he was being asked to do, and it was an incredibly low blow for Kingsley to use Remus and Teddy as an excuse to manipulate him into breaking the law. But, he also wasn’t wrong. Fenrir Greyback was the foulest, evilest person – no, thing – Harry had ever encountered, apart from maybe Voldemort and the information the werewolf had could make the 6% that continued to echo in the back of Harry’s mind significantly less. He had killed Voldemort. Why should he allow Greyback to continue to hurt innocents?
“I think that’s highly sensible. Harry, I appreciate this, but I am not touching a burial shroud. That’s sacrilegious.”
Hermione and Ron nodded at him. They stood in silence a few minutes longer, before Roslyn cleared her throat.
Hermione half-ran into Ron’s arms. “Who will Harry dance with?” Hermione finally said, finding her voice.
Harry nodded. He should’ve known as much himself. When silence returned, he said tiredly, “I can’t tell you how she survived. But she’s in the forbidden forest. I don’t know how alive she is exactly. She could be anywhere between a barely moving corpse and a fully functional Death Eater – maybe even saner, and cleverer than we knew her.”
Harry swayed on the spot slightly his head still aching with the effort to break the wards earlier. Ron pushed Greyback roughly into one of the cells and swung the door close. A chain wrapped around the bars like a snake and locked it in place. Harry took a deep breath and leant against the cold stone wall.
George stood and shook his hand in a manner most uncharacteristic for him. “Sorry about this morning. I’m struggling a bit with my temper at the moment,” he admitted.
“Harry Potter. Are you going to become an Auror?” a reporter asked. “Will you marry me, Harry?” a middle-aged witch shouted. “What do you think of The Weird Sisters’ new album?” “Are you going to complete your NEWTs?” “Are you going to run for Minister?” “Do you think the death-eaters should be given the dementor’s kiss?”
“Good. And remember, you’re never to punish yourself if you make a mistake, okay?” At Kreacher’s nod. Harry smiled. “You can go to the Malfoy’s now. Malfoy will need your help to pack. Thank you, Kreacher, for everything you’ve done for us. You’ve been a fantastic house elf.”
“Let’s just cross that bridge when we get to it,” Hermione laughed. “What about you, Harry? Are you going to take up Robards’ offer?”
“Instil fear in Wizarding Britain again. Gather followers by threats. Try to take over the ministry.” Harry frowned. “They’ll need a leader.”
“I was going to ask if everything was alright, but when it comes to you three it never is,” he commented.
Thank you all for your patience! Here is another chapter; an interlude, if you will. More to come soon (and much sooner than the last couple of chapters) xx
With Ron’s nod, they both used their wands to slice their hands open. Grasping each other’s palm tightly, Harry drew another circle with his wand and cast, “
Harry found himself nodding. “I always thought it was strange that we didn’t have Maths or English.”
Harry nodded. He still felt uncomfortable, but he really didn’t want to see Draco in pain like he had the other day. “Erm. Open the door for me.”
She pursed her lips as she banished them. “I am glad you managed to get some sleep, but I’ll have you know that I’m entirely against using Dreamless. You’re nearly impossible to wake up when you take it, and one of us always ends up at the nasty end of a wand.”
Harry sat shakily on a seat. Malfoy was still kneeling. Harry ran a hand through his hair. “You can get up,” he said softly, unsure if the magic that compelled Malfoy to kneel needed his permission. Malfoy stood up slowly. “For the record, Malfoy, I am, too,” Harry said after a minute.
Harry paused. Was he? George seemed to be. Hermione was staunchly against it. Ron, Ginny and Bill had seemed largely impartial, but, deep down, he knew that each of them would follow his lead. He trusted Hermione and Ron implicitly, but he knew that no matter the situation, they would always follow his lead. Hermione would break her morals for him time and time again and Ron would follow him to death’s door if Harry required it of him.
“Are there any other magical creatures here?” Harry asked, thinking of Hagrid. He would love the gardens here, he thought with a pang of guilt. Since the battle, Hagrid had been working hard to rebuild his hut and care for Grawp, who had been quite badly injured. Harry hadn’t seen the half-giant nearly enough in the past month.
Harry had suspected as much. “Pity,” Harry said. “You’re not going to like Plan B.” He closed his eyes, drudging up memories he had spent so long squashing into the recesses of his mind. Remus, screaming in agony as his bones started to break and reform into those of a wolf’s in his third year. His thin, frail frame and dark bags under his eyes after he’d been unemployed for over year, because of his curse. Bill’s face ripped open as he lay in the Hospital Wing, Molly weeping over his frightfully still body. Lavender’s body in pieces in the Great Hall. Teddy’s screams for his parents the first few nights after the Battle.
A burst of white light, and several large cuts appeared on Greyback’s body. Harry and Ron were silent as they watched the man bleed out. He couldn’t feel what was happening, Harry tried to tell himself. He’d killed so many people, he’d be given the Dementor’s Kiss, anyway, which was a fate worse than death.
hadn’t been his brightest idea. He eyed Draco cautiously, unsure as to how to respond without incriminating himself or Ron or Hermione or Bill.
Harry leant against the wall, watching the werewolf carefully, waiting for the spell to wear off. He summoned a piece of parchment and a quill and scribbled on it.
Ginny giggled and soon they were talking just as they had years before. Harry loved her, he really did, but they both knew they weren’t right for each other. They talked about everything; from quidditch to school to the war to boys and girls they found attractive. At some point, Ginny pulled out a flask of firewhiskey and they started singing along to Celestina Warbeck at the top of their lungs. Ginny was just opening a bottle of black nail polish to do Harry’s nails when George walked in.
Malfoy cleared his throat, bringing Harry out of his thoughts. “Right. When I’m done speaking, you’ll need to respond very carefully with ‘Lord Malfoy, I accept your offer of service to repay your three life debts. You may teach me the ways of the Old. So, mote it be.’ You have to be really specific. Otherwise, we could accidentally end up married or something horrible like that.”
Harry didn’t say anything. He was sure his voice would betray him if he did. He vanished the blood and cast a stasis spell over the body. His hands were shaking in a way they never had before.
Harry shook his head. “It’s okay, I can see a snake,” he said, going back in. Ignoring the image of Hermione, which was now even further forward in Ron’s mind, despite desperate attempts from both of them to push it back, Harry could see memory-Malfoy cast a snake. “
Suddenly, Hokka let out a bark of a noise. “Hokka finds you amusing,” Roslyn explained. “He lost his tongue working for his last family. Mistress Lily and Master James took him in.”
Harry grinned and leisurely walked to the local place, revelling in the cool evening breeze. On his way, he popped into an off-license and bought some chocolate. Years of staring daggers across the Great Hall at Malfoy fortunately meant that Harry was quite knowledgeable of the man’s taste in food. No matter the occasion, Malfoy would nearly always be eating chocolate, and Harry suspected he hadn’t eaten it in a while.
“Excellent. Robards is thrilled to have a full team again. I’m glad Cragg’s come out of retirement. It’s a bit of an honour, really. He left in 1959 when Ignatius Tuft took over as Minister and refused to come back until the Ministry was under a leader that wasn’t corrupt. It’s a low bar, but I’m glad he believes that I’m above it,” Kingsley said, indicating that Harry should take a seat. The Minister waved his wand in an arch and raised several privacy wards around his office. “You’re not going to like what I have to say next.”
Harry shuddered, reminded of the times he’d watched her cow before Voldemort. At least her pleas proved that she only had one horcrux. He pulled the basilisk fang away regretfully. “Who else knows of horcruxes?”
Harry raised a hand to the place where a doorknob should’ve been. The door creaked open ominously. “Something feels wrong,” he said at once. Several steps led down into complete darkness, but the smell of rotting meat filled the air. “Wands out.”
Harry rolled his shoulders, thinking that Malfoy probably wouldn’t like to hear that he downed two whole bottles ten minutes earlier. Instead he took a sip of his coffee, and said wryly, “I do have a two-month old.”
“Alright, let’s begin,” Malfoy said, removing his outer robe. Harry passed Teddy to Roslyn, who began playing with him on the floor. “This is called the Dance of the Fae. We’ll do it without music first so that you can all get the hang of it. You weren’t too bad at the Yule Ball, Granger, you can demonstrate with me.”
When the horrible sensation stopped, his headache had completely vanished, his mouth tasted like peppermint, and his teeth felt clean. Harry felt a lot better. “Thanks, Ron. You guys are going into Diagon Alley?” he asked curiously.
“Poor Neville. I was hoping we could give him some good news tonight,” Hermione commented. Harry groaned. He’d completely forgotten that he’d agree to go out with everybody tonight. He’d been hoping to spent a quiet night in with Teddy.
“You trust everybody in there, correct?” Draco asked. At Harry’s nod, he continued. “Tell them the truth. You are the King, but nobody there has any illusions that you’re not also a seventeen-year-old trying his hardest.”
Ron reached for the vial without hesitation, unbottled it and signed the contract. “I’m not so sure there is dark magic and light magic, anymore,” he said.
Draco bit his lip. “If we use the kitchen, we don’t have to go through th - the drawing room,” he said quietly. Hermione nodded faintly as Ron squeezed her hand.
Ginny reached up to the cupboard to get some mugs. “Sounds like fun. Invite me to the party next time.”
Harry grinned. “Thank you, sir. May we use your floo to depart? I don’t want to go downstairs again.” He asked politely.
There were five other aurors in the room, but Harry only recognised two of them. Proudfoot and Savage had been stationed at Hogsmeade with Tonks in his sixth year and had come to Bill and Fleur’s wedding. Their names had been listed along with those who fought at the Battle, but Harry didn’t remember seeing them. They’d also been at Tonks’ funeral.
They made their way back inside the house to find Kreacher at the front door, looking relieved. “Master is keeping Black house safe,” he croaked. “Kreacher is feeling the wards.”
Harry shuddered. “That’s horrible, Hokka,” he said, remembering how Dobby had been treated by the Malfoys.
Harry gulped, not particularly fond of the idea of being torn to shreds. He hugged Teddy closer to his chest. “Can’t I just stay here?” he pouted.
Draco shrugged. “Not especially, but you need a few minutes alone with them so they can badger you with all the questions they won’t want to ask when I’m there.”
Harry frowned. He had thought that they had removed most of them in fifth year. “I understand. Dark magic is probably not fantastic for your mother’s recovery. I can have them removed, though.”
Without speaking, he sliced his thumb open with a slash of his wand, allowing a few drops to spill onto the grass. Wards, suddenly visible to him, shimmered with gold, and he stepped through them. “Ron, Hermione, Teddy, come in,” he said.
“Oh, little sister, what has the saviour got you up to now,” he said in a fake admonishing way. With a warning glance at Ginny to hold the bottle of polish out of the way, he leaped onto the middle of the bed. “So, Mr. Potter, I have made something for you,” he said, helping himself to some of Ginny’s firewhiskey.
Harry frowned. “I don’t know. I felt the wards shift, and then he was at the door. He looked surprised to see me though. I don’t think he knew I lived here. Before I could ask, he collapsed.”
Malfoy gaped at him. “Nothing?” he asked outraged. “You’re a Potter for Merlin’s sake. Not to mention the Head of an Ancient and Most Noble House.”
“We’ll approach from a distance and attempt to take down as many protective wards as we can before they notice,” Robards declared. “Kai, Cragg, you will take the left-back exit, Elfie and I will take the right. Proudfoot, Savage and Potter, you take the front.” He looked up and caught everybody’s eye before turning and pausing on Harry. “Remember, we want them alive.”
Harry frowned, worried that Robards thought him some unkillable being. “I can die, you know,” he said. “I have died,” he added after a moment.
Ron gratefully passed Teddy into Harry’s willing arms. “I haven’t got a ring yet, but Ginny said she’s going to help. I’d never find one on my own.”
“I’m sorry?” Harry asked, surprised. They had been trying to remove her from the wall for years, unable to break the permanent sticking charm.
Harry rubbed his forehead. He really didn’t fancy going back there, but he could see the benefits. “Luna? ‘Mione?”
Malfoy snorted. “No, you’re not. I’m not either. He was my father – he was suffering, now he’s not.” He shifted awkwardly under their gaze. “You were saying, Granger.”
Harry was starting to get the impression that, no matter how decent the person was, the Minister for Magic would always be slightly corrupt. Perhaps it was the position itself – cursed like the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts.
“Excellent,” Harry said. He paused. He trusted that Malfoy wouldn’t hurt Kreacher, but he didn’t know Narcissa very well. To be safe, he said clearly, “Remember, Kreacher, I am still Lord Black. If you are ever hurt or put in danger by the Malfoys, you must come to me at once. That’s an order.”
“Ginny’s still sixteen,” Ron said cheekily, ducking to avoid the mash potatoes that flew across the table.
Kai steered them into the cafeteria and indicated to a large table. As they sat down, a plate of sandwiches floated over with two jugs of pumpkin juice. Proudfoot helped himself to two, eating quickly.
“Yes,” Bill nodded. “But it is very powerful. It will give whoever holds it good or bad luck, depending on what its master wishes.”
Malfoy shook his head. “Just because there are no wizards or witches with the last names of Potter, Black, Peverell or Gaunt walking around, doesn’t mean there are now members of the houses. Anybody connected paternally to a family line, unless they are the heir or Head of another house, is under your protection. My mother, for example, is a member the Black house.”
“Can you get him out of the Ministry?” Hermione asked. “I know you can apparate in, but you’ve never tried getting out.”
“It seems quite unbelievable, doesn’t it?” Elfie smiled at Harry’s grimace. “I’d like to clarify, I do not read that magazine. I simply listen when other people are gossiping.” She raised a thin eyebrow. “There is nothing in this world that is more important than knowing what and whom people gossip about.”
“Yes! Oh Ron, you’re brilliant,” Hermione exclaimed. “You’ll still be breaking several wards, but I’ve no doubt that it’ll work. The only problem is, you are the only person who can break those wards. It’ll be incredibly obvious to anyone who looked hard enough that you were the one to break him out.”
Potter opened his mouth to argue back, but a voice interrupted them in the doorway. “He’s right, Harry,” Hermione said quietly.
Harry had left early from their gathering that evening at Hermione’s insistence. Her intention was for him to go home and get some much-deserved (and needed) sleep, but there was just too much to do before his expedition to the forest the following afternoon. Most notably, Draco and his mother were to move in by the following morning, and Harry hadn’t even thought of starting packing yet – not to mention the horcrux of Narcissa’s sister hanging in the basement.
“Harry Potter,” one of the Death Eaters – Jugson, probably – spat. “Aren’t you a bit young to be an auror?”
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “What happened to it?” he asked cautiously. He had long since learnt that one shouldn’t simply humour Luna, but actually listen to her advice. She was a Ravenclaw, after all.
They made their way into the living room, and Ron started to unpack the food, summoning some cutlery from the kitchen.
Harry shrugged, looking at them. “I like them. Anyway, I’d best be off. I’m worried that if I leave Ron alone with Teddy too long, he’ll run away and secretly adopt him.”
“It’s warm and loving and feels like the end of the world but also the beginning of everything,” Proudfoot began while Savage made gagging sounds. Harry grinned, the adrenaline pumping through his body as they approached the warehouse.
Harry shuddered at the thought of the Lestrange brothers ‘belonging’ to him. “What about your life source, then? Can I locate it in the same way?” he asked curiously. “You told me it was in the Forbidden Forest, but I’ll need more information than that.”
As they were making their way done the stairs, Ron turned to Hermione and asked, “You don’t really mind that I’m not going back to Hogwarts with you, do you ‘mione?”
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Don’t tell me you wouldn’t have left if you could have, Finnegan. We all would have.”
Robards poured them all a glass of water, and Harry took one gratefully. “How long can you hold out on Unforgivables?” the auror asked, waving at a QuickQuotes quill as it began to take notes.
The Black ring was like its name, a dark obsidian jewel glinting under the lights. Harry slipped it onto his finger and it glowed, resizing to fit.
Harry frowned, looking at the can. He couldn’t help but think it probably wasn’t wise to drink this much the night before his first day at work.
Harry decided not to comment. Instead, he continued, “I’m not particularly fond of the idea of bleeding once a week to keep the wards strong, either. I was just wondering if there were any other wards you knew about for protection.”
“Here,” he offered, pulling out of Ron’s brain. “Take these. Keep them on you at all times,” he said to Ron and Hermione. He turned to Bill, “I’m sorry we didn’t have any more.”
“Couldn’t get in. Bastards had this place down like lock and key. Lestranges caught up to us. Both got away,” Robards said roughly. Harry’s stomach flipped. “What was all that just then?” Robards asked, just as accusingly.
“I think it’ll be easier if I just show you,” Harry said after a minute. Closing his eyes, he summoned Dumbledore’s pensieve that McGonagall had given him after the battle. He pulled the memory of his meeting with Kingsley out of his mind with his wand and tipped it into the floating basin.
Malfoy downed the potion proffered by Ron. Smoke blew out of the blond’s ears, but, somehow, he still managed to look dignified. When the potion’s effects seemed to have dissipated, he nodded his thanks and rose from the table. “Well, I can’t say I ever thought I’d be getting drunk and eating Indian with the Golden Trio, but it was actually quite enjoyable,” he drawled.
Harry spent the rest of the night alternating between staring anxiously at Teddy and staring anxiously at Malfoy. At some point, he brought Teddy with him into Malfoy’s room and sat in the armchair next to the bed. Harry had no idea what Kreacher had done to make Teddy finally fall asleep, but, given that the baby was smiling in his sleep, the tuft of hair at the top of his head changing colour, Harry was pretty confident that it wasn’t some horrible dark magic.
Malfoy smirked shakily. “I know. You’re too much of a Gryffindor.” He sighed as he sat down. He closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. “I expected it to happen sooner, actually. The magic is confused. I promised to help teach you the Old Ways, and I am, but I also pledged to be of service to you – instead I’ve mostly been telling you what to do.” He paused, and then added. “I’m also leaving out a particularly significant part of the Old Ways in my lessons, and the magic has noticed.”
Leaving the room, Harry kept glancing back at the portrait, his heart hammering in his chest. Hermione squeezed his hand and Ron clapped him on the back.
Draco rolled his eyes but opened the door. He shivered as magic flowed over him. “Eloquent as always,” he cheeked, pulling back the door for Harry to walk through.
“Malfoy – “Harry grabbed the sleeve of Malfoys arm but paused, not sure what to say. “Your mother – she grew up here, yes?”
“He’s repaying his life debts by teaching me the Old Ways,” Harry sighed. “I don’t even know how it happened, but it turns out Malfoy and Hermione make quite the pair when it comes to big plans.”
Harry stepped through the DMLE floo seconds after an owl informing him of an emergency meeting had arrived, assuming he’d be the first. Instead, he was greeted by four accusing stares.
Mordecai nodded and smiled proudly. “I’m from Philly. Auror with MACUSA for five years. I moved to the UK just three weeks ago.”
“Write down the names of every person you have killed,” Harry said again. This time he was quick to obey.
Proudfoot spoke up. “We could definitely pull off a sting, but it would take longer. We’d have to keep Potter’s employment with the Aurors away from public knowledge. Ideally, he’d move back in to his old house and draw them out by walking around visibly unprotected in muggle streets. I don’t know how long it would take before they attempt to jump him, but it would definitely be quite a few weeks. They’d suspect a trap. We would have to be hiding in bushes for months.”
Harry raised an eyebrow but ignored him. Turning to Ron, instead, he said, “You don’t have to be here.”
Suddenly, Harry felt the wards of Grimmauld Place shift. Frowning, he drew his wand, holding Teddy protectively. As far as he was aware, it was only the Weasleys, Hermione, Kingsley and himself who could see the house under the fidelius charm, but he didn’t want to take any chances. Making his way to the front door, he peeked through the spy hole.
“Well, how are you supposed to provide for the members of your house if you aren’t able to support yourself?” Harry asked.
Malfoy looked thoughtful. Finally, he nodded. “I was raised my whole life to be a noble Lord. I know how Potter needs to act, and I think I know how to use Potter’s influence to restore the Old Ways in wizarding society. If we do this right, we might be able to prevent another war.”
“Did you know elvish wine changes into whatever best suits the meal?” Malfoy said conversationally, clearly feeling a touch uncomfortable.
At one-minute past twelve, Bill, Ron, Hermione and Harry stepped through the Minister for Magic’s fireplace with plans to kidnap his most high-profile prisoner.
Harry’s face split into a wide grin. “Of course, you have my permission! I’m so happy for you!” he exclaimed.
“Lord Potter,” Madam Malkin greeted, shaking his hand. Harry blanched at the title but attempted to retain his composure and resisted asking her to just call him ‘Harry’, earning himself an approving nod from Malfoy. “Lord Malfoy has informed me that you will be hosting a Pledge as well as a ball for Midsomer.”
the plan?” Greyback sneered. “Your aurors couldn’t get anything from me. There are only a few legal ways to make someone break.”
, so you can host your ball the night before. I’ve already arranged catering and entertainment, but I’ll have to organise the other stuff with your elves. We should send the invitations by the end of this week. I’ll have to go through the etiquette with Granger, Weasley and you before then. You’ll need a date for both the meeting and the ball. Do you have anyone in mind? They’ll need plenty of warning.”
” The light went out as normal. Turning to a locked chest of drawers next to his bed that held his pictures of his parents, he cast, “
“Honestly, you’d think I’d never cast an incredibly complicated, ancient, powerful protective charm before,” he teased.
to try. Personally, I doubt it, but the Minister remains hopeful. He said he’s got someone new to try and break him.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “You could have anybody in the wizarding world in a heartbeat if you wanted. They’d put up with anything you threw at them.”
George gasped. “You mock me, oh King of Wizarding Britain!” he cried. “Have you ever known me to make a product that was that simple? Watch this,” he said proudly, shoving it into Harry’s mouth.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione sighed. “It’s okay. You didn’t. But Malfoy is right. In any case, you shouldn’t be keeping the most powerful wand in existence in your sock drawer.”
“Good, now, Potter reach for Granger’s hand and spin her so that you swap places,” Malfoy said, and grimaced before continuing. “After, we will do the same,” he said to Ron. Ron winced, but did as he was told.
Proudfoot let out a grin at Harry’s reaction. “Feels better than a butterbeer on a freezing day, doesn’t it?”
Harry was glad he had already finished his coffee, because he was sure he would have dropped it. “I’m sorry?”
Elfie shrieked with laughter. “I’d crush you, old man,” she called over her shoulder as she made her way to the showers.
Harry swallowed. “I have no idea,” he admitted. “Suppose I can’t – what do we do? Do I just try an unprotected floo?”
Hermione swallowed thickly. “The life debt. Malfoy pledged his allegiance to Harry. Harry accidentally called on it when he ordered him to answer.”
Proudfoot unholstered his wand. “Bombarda Maxima,” he cast on the rolling door of the warehouse, watching with satisfaction as it exploded.
“Can Kreacher assist Master?” the elderly elf asked. He had become much more amenable in the past year, but he’d never offered outright to help Harry with something before.
The four of them made their way to the door. “See you later, Potter,” Proudfoot said. “Good luck with the Minister. We owe you a drink.”
Walburga nodded aristocratically. “Take care of my home. It is yours now, my Lord,” she said, and this time her deferential nod was genuine. “Will you destroy my portrait, please?”
He worked in tandem with Cragg, but soon realised that Cragg was working quicker than he was. Harry frowned and holstered his wand. Closing his eyes, he willed each of the links to snap quietly. Subtly. He felt a hum of approval flow through Cragg’s magic. He worked in sections, and, in no time at all, the team had managed to bring down and replace the wards over the warehouse.
Elfie frowned. “You’re going to use Potter as bait.” It wasn’t a question. She turned to look at him accusingly. “And I bet it was your idea.”
Draco was silent for a bit. “What do you think? In the end, it doesn’t matter what Hermione, the Weasleys or even I think. You’re the King. Who do you want to fight?”
They continued in this manner for several hours, until all three of them were so tired they could barely keep their eyes open.
“I suppose you’re right. As much as I hate to admit it, you’re not little kids anymore,” Mrs. Weasley harrumphed.
They went down the steps cautiously, Ron moving to stand in front of Hermione protectively. Harry didn’t mention that Hermione was far more skilled at magic than her boyfriend and that, if they were sensible, they should probably reverse positions. He would have, if he’d thought there was a great risk, but as much as the stench was unbearable, an overwhelming feeling of stagnant magic was in the air. Anything that had occurred in these dungeons had happened a very long time ago.
Harry paused. Ginny was the only person who he had ever told that he had had feelings for both boys and girls. In return, Harry was the first person that knew Ginny felt the same way. He blushed a little but said quietly. “Yeah, reckon he is.”
Harry sighed but steeled himself. "I won’t do anything here. Give me the afternoon. I will find a place."
Harry let out a breath he hadn’t been aware that he was holding. “Why will this be a war council?” he asked, not directly acknowledging Draco’s – albeit accurate – aspersions.
Harry rolled his eyes good-naturedly. “I’m fine, Molly. Kreacher forces me to eat three times a day.”
“Hiya Teddy,” Harry greeted, whooshing him through the air. The infant made grabby hands towards the food. “Sorry, love, you’re too little for that. But we’ll have lots of curry when you’re older,” Harry promised.
“You couldn’t if you tried. No one can destroy an immortal being,” she laughed maniacally. Harry’s stomach dropped. Bellatrix’s portrait was a horcrux. He should have known! Bellatrix’s body had never been found, despite Molly and Ginny swearing up and done that the Weasley matriarch had killed her. He opened his mouth, but Ron had already pressed a basilisk’s fang into his hand.
Harry swallowed nervously as the bear dissipated into a fine silvery mist. This was it. The last of the Death Eaters were on the other side of these wards. It was almost over. He reached out with his magic again and felt for the wards.
Just short of an hour later, the three were dressed semi-formally, and were dropping Teddy off at the Burrow. Harry dressed as Malfoy had directed, and Ron and Hermione were both wearing plain black robes over some training blacks that Malfoy had procured them.
When he opened his eyes, they were standing in front of Bellatrix’s portrait in Grimmauld Place’s basement. The portrait swung open without asking questions but she raised an eyebrow when she saw their prisoner.
Ron grabbed her suddenly and kissed her firmly. Harry turned his gaze to Teddy as he strolled off to the kitchen, leaving his two friends to enjoy their moment.
After the most intense duelling session of his life, Harry was dripping with sweat in the Ministry changing rooms.
“What was Ilvermorny like?” Elfie asked Kai. Harry looked up with interest. He had always been fascinated to hear Fleur’s stories of Beauxbaton’s and Krum’s of Durmstrang when they were waiting impatiently in some tent or another during the Triwizard Tournament.
Harry frowned. What was his most powerful language? The only language he really knew was English, but he could also speak parseltongue. He sighed. “Ron, can you think of a snake?” he asked.
Ron put his head in his hands. “Let’s focus on changing the world first, okay love? Gender bias in dark overlords can wait.”
They worked in silence, with only Harry’s mutterings and the pops of Kreacher apparating in with more towels and water. At some point, the blood stopped flowing, and Hermione started bandaging while Harry continued to stitch the skin together. By the time they were done, Harry’s couch was the colour of wine, Hermione, Harry, Ron and Kreacher were pale and panting, and Malfoy was still unconscious.
“If the memory charm is activated, you’ll forget everything from the moment you walked in this room. Everything, not just things to do with Potter and his trigger-happy wand,” Draco said plainly. “This is a serious commitment. If you do not wish to sign, please leave.”
“What?” Harry asked. He blinked. He supposed, to Draco, it would be like a war council – not many people invited had particularly fond feelings for him. “If you don’t want to come, you absolutely don’t have to. But I promise everyone will be on their very best behaviour. There’s nothing a few drinks and conversations about quidditch can’t make less awkward. Besides, Neville said he’s on your side. And you know Luna, Hermione, Ron and I are.”
A few hours later, Harry and Ginny had played seven games of gobstones, and Harry was starting to feel a bit better - minus the incredible hangover that was coming on.
Robards raised an eyebrow. “But you own all three Hallows, correct?” At Harry’s nod, he continued. “I admit I don’t know much about it, but doesn’t that make you Master of Death?”
Hermione and Ron soon entered the room, the latter carrying an unbearably cute Teddy in a tiny version of some dress robes. Harry stood and took the infant, who gurgled in delight and changed his hair from dark blue to black briefly, before returning to his currently-preferred style of bubblegum pink.
Harry nodded, swallowing thickly. “Harder than I thought it was going to be. I hope Bill and Hermione can fix the wards.”
Draco shrugged. “A Wizard’s Oath doesn’t have consequences, besides warning you if I actively go against it, and I don’t intend to ever work for the Dark again. It’s fine. Hermione said it wouldn’t interact with the Life Debt.”
Mrs. Weasley nodded. “Ginny’s upstairs in her room, and, from the noises, I think George is inventing in the attic,” she smiled at Harry with watering eyes. George was clearly having a good day if his spirits were still as high as they were that morning.
Roslyn nodded excitedly. “We house several Thestrals and two Pegasai in the stables,” she said, pointing to a large stable near the winery. “As well as several muggle horses.”
Harry sighed. He still grieved for Hedwig – his first magical friend after Hagrid. “I don’t mind,” he said. “Not a Snowy. Something that won’t tire from large distances.”
Harry was especially fond of Indian food because the Dursley’s hated it, almost more than they hated magic. Harry wondered if it reminded them of his father. The Dursleys had never said anything overtly about his ethnicity, except for one time in primary school, when Dudley had tried to copy one of his friend’s words for Harry’s skin colour. It was the only time Petunia had come to Harry’s defence, although she seemed less concerned for Harry’s wellbeing, and more concerned for Dudley’s reputation. “The Dursley’s are not racist, Duddykins,” she had admonished, although she glanced at Harry with disdain.
Leaving a mildly guilty-looking Kingsley to his paperwork, the four made their way through the abandoned hallways of the ministry. The holding cells were on the second lowest level of the Ministry, just about the Department of Mysteries.
Harry blinked. He hadn’t thought that house-elves had children, although he supposed that they must. He nodded, shooting a regretful look at Hermione. “I hope I can live up to your expectations,” he said very seriously.
“I’m pretty confident it’ll work,” Hermione said after considering for a moment. “And you won’t actually have a marriage bond. I’m just warning you that it might be more … intimate than you’re used to.”
“That was incredibly stupid,” Hermione huffed as they landed (thankfully) in the living room of the Burrow. “There’s no evidence that you can travel by floo without declaring your location out loud.”
The Entrance Hall was very large but sparsely decorated with a richly embroidered rug, two bronze stag heads on either side of the door, and a large Gryffindor-red tapestry that featured a family tree, like the one in the Black House.
Secondly - I've decided to rename the work from 'Strange Bedfellows' to 'Mos Maiorum'. It's a Latin term for the unwritten code from which the ancient Romans derived their social norms. It essentially means 'Do the Right Thing', which, for the Romans, was to obey and continue to uphold tradition. I'm a history nerd and found it in one of my readings for uni. It definitely fits the story much better. Also, there is another story on AO3 called 'Strange Bedfellows', which, admittedly, I haven't read but is undoubtedly much better than my writing.
As Hermione and Harry danced, Harry couldn’t help but glance at Ron and Malfoy. The green monster that resided in his chest was pleased to notice that Malfoy was holding Ron much further away than he had Harry.
,” he said quietly. A ball of light lit up the dark room at the tip of the wand, but it was a much bigger light than he’d ever made before.
“Ow, Ron,” Hermione laughed as Ron stepped on her foot, again. Their playful argument dragged Harry from his thoughts.
Shortly after the battle, Harry had asked McGonagall if she would commission portraits of Snape and Dumbledore for the Head’s office. She’d sighed sadly. “I’m sorry, Harry, but I cannot. It would be cruel. A portrait is only as true as the painter’s knowledge of the subject. I am no painter, and even if I were, I did not know them. Did you?” she’d asked. Harry was about to say that of course he knew Dumbledore and Snape. That they were good men and that they should be honoured with portraits in the office they once belonged in. But he held his tongue. Only months before he had realised he knew nothing of Dumbledore’s life, outside of his plans for Harry. Not to mention that only a few days ago, he had believed with all his heart that Snape was a traitor. No painter could ever capture the truth of the two headmasters.
She avoided his eyes. “Okay, what you have before you are magical contracts, imbued with the power of a Wizard’s Oath,” she said, pressing on despite Harry’s splutters of indignation. “It’s really very similar to the contract I had you sign at the beginning of DA. Except, this time, the punishment won’t be some nasty pimples – it’ll be a fairly strong memory charm.”
Harry smiled. “Yeah. It’s good to see you, Bill,” he said, shaking the eldest Weasley child’s hand. “I haven’t had a chance to explore yet, but, listen, I have to tell you something,” he said gravely. “Is Teddy still at the Burrow?”
Robards nodded. “We’ll train and plan for Battle until Friday. Don’t make plans for the weekend. Keep your mouths shut about Potter’s involvement in the team until then. Since I still have you all for the rest of the morning, though, partner up. Cragg with Potter. Elfie, Kai. Savage, Proudfoot. Duel until I call time. No serious injuries, though. Work on mind invasion and defence, too. The Lestrange brothers are both scarily good at
“I don’t know, Teddy,” he said quietly to the infant. Teddy looked up at him with big, unblinking blue eyes. Harry glanced down at his hands. “I really wish I had my dad. Or Sirius. Or your dad,” he whispered, refusing to let a tear fall down his cheek.
the remaining darke objects from the cells, he took one final look at his basement before making his way up the stairs and into the kitchen. The door swung closed behind him. “
To Harry’s surprise, Ron was the one who answered. “What if you were to just explain the theory bit of it? You don’t have to actually be near it. Like Umbridge’s Defence classes.”
“Depends on how much Pepper Up you drank,” Malfoy said, frowning. “You don’t want to get too reliant on it, Potter. It’s addictive.”
Harry raised a brow, interested. “I’ve been working on it a lot – it’s far easier to control than through my wand.”
Greyback blinked in surprise before the red light hit him and dropped to the floor in pain. While he writhed in agony, Harry quickly cast again.
Harry growled. He was done trying to fight clean. Closing his eyes, he willed Jugson’s wand to drop. Catching it deftly, Harry used the man’s momentary surprise to roll to his feet. Harry levelled the wand at the man’s face.
Harry wanted to argue but caught Draco’s hard glare. He paused. Addressing Narcissa, but looking directly at Draco, he asked, “Because I’m your son’s employer, because I’m letting you live in my house, because I’m the Head of the House of Black, or because your son, and you by proxy, are my vassals?”
After a quick lunch, Harry had been hoping that he would be allowed the rest of the day off to go and play with Teddy, but Malfoy had other plans.
Ron nodded. “You will be. Malfoy has to serve you. If you ask for something, it will hurt Malfoy if he doesn’t do what you ask.”
Greyback’s face went blank. Harry ended the torture spell and waited to see if the werewolf would be able to break out. After two or three minutes, he turned to Ron.
“It’s laced with chamomile and a tiny amount of calming draught. Also, if you tap it lightly with your wand,” George explained, demonstrating with a flourish, “it shines a different colour depending on what the baby needs. For example, you need your nappy changed.”
Harry frowned. Golden was good right? It didn’t sound particularly evil. What did a dark left side mean? “Is that a good thing?”
As they walked through the castle, Harry could see the rebuilding team had been working tirelessly. There were still some scorch marks on the walls from misfired spells, and a few missing bricks here and there, but the upper levels almost looked the same as they had in his first year.
“No one,” Harry answered quickly. He sighed. “Everyone.” He rubbed his scar. It wasn’t hurting specifically, not like it used to, but he was developing quite a strong tension headache. “Everyone’s been quoting Shakespeare recently,” he said after a minute. “Bill told me about some woman who thought she had blood on her hands and went mad trying to get it off.”
Harry closed his eyes and felt out for magic in the air. Magic was always stronger in natural areas, but this area of Devon seemed so industrial that there was barely anything of note. He pushed his senses further. There. About two-three thousand feet ahead of them, an extremely powerful and darke ward stood erect, protecting the warehouse from anything the aurors may do.
Bill closed his eyes as he tapped the door with his wand several times. The door remained still, but his face cleared with recognition. “It’ll only open for the house’s master. We’d better hope that’s you, Harry,” he said.
“Coffee, then,” Ginny said, stretching as she stood up and made her way over to the kitchen. “Where are my brothers, then?”
Harry frowned. Kreacher had certainly never done that for him before. Glancing at Malfoy, he realised that it was the first time he had seen Malfoy’s left arm since that night on the Astronomy Tower. His dark mark was gone.
Ron sighed. “I’m not great,” he admitted, biting his lip. “It hurts. More than I thought it would.” He blew softly on Teddy’s forehead to remove a stray blue lock from the baby’s face. “I’m glad I’m not at the Burrow. That’d be too much.”
Harry cast a silencing charm over Teddy, hoping he wouldn’t wake up from their conversation. He watched as Malfoy started to panic. “Don’t move, Malfoy. Your skin is barely stitched together. I’ll doubt it’ll hold if you move.”
“Why does Weasley sound like he’s stomping on the keys?” Malfoy asked, shrugging off his jacket and handing it to Kreacher, who was standing at attention.
Harry nodded, grimacing. “I’m kind of rubbish, actually, but I remembered the spell Snape used on you back in sixth year…” he trailed off. He didn’t know how Malfoy would react to the time Harry almost killed him.
Harry crouched down so that he was at the elf’s eye-height. “Hermione, Ron and I are going to be moving into Potter manor soon. I really like Grimmauld Place,” he said, lying through his teeth, but not wanting to offend, “but I want to see where my dad grew up for a bit. There are three Potter house-elves – Roslyn, Mimsey and Hokka. I was going to ask if you would like to come with us, but I know you love this house. Malfoy and his mum are going to move in here, and I was wondering if you would rather stay here and help them?”
There was a sharp intake of breath, but Hermione’s voice only slightly wavered as she said loudly, “It’s a really good idea, actually. Nobody lives there, and no one would expect us to use it, even if it becomes known that Draco’s on our side.”
Harry nodded, wondering if Malfoy and his mother would want to move into Grimmauld Place if Harry, Ron and Hermione moved to Potter Manor. It would certainly make much more sense and keep the house from being empty. He’d ask next time he saw Malfoy. Changing the subject for the incredibly depressed-looking elf’s sake as well as his own, he asked, “Is it possible to mail-order an owl?” Harry wasn’t quite up to facing Diagon Alley.
Kingsley nodded in greeting at them, looking highly unsurprised at the company. “The night warden has just done his rounds on this level. He’ll be going upstairs now, so the hallways between here and the prison block should be empty, save for the guards outside his cell.” He clasped Harry’s hand. “Thank you, Harry.”
Harry had a feeling Robards didn’t often give out compliments, so he nodded politely, summoning his wand back to its holster.
The magic swirled around Harry for a moment. “I know.” The magic instantly settled. Harry and Malfoy were both left panting. Hermione and Ron jumped up from the table quickly.
George nodded, “Only if the box itself is orange.” Turning to Harry, he grinned. “Your majesty,” he bowed deeply.
She closed her eyes. “No,” she said through gritted teeth. “I was naïve to think everything would be better. We’re a team. If we’re doing this, we’re doing it together.”
“Impedimenta,” Robards cast. Harry batted it away with the elder wand and cast a strong knockback jinx instead, raising an eyebrow.
Hermione made Harry and Ron go through the removal and creation of a Fidelius five times before she was confident enough to leave them to do it. “Remember, you must say
Harry shifted uncomfortably. “Several, actually,” he frowned. “How am I supposed to know the Old Ways. No one even told me I was a wizard until I was 11.”
“Anyway, Dumbledore changed the rules. I’m not really sure why, probably he hoped we would have an appreciation for muggle culture, unlike wizards like Grindelwald. All of a sudden, muggleborns started being introduced to the Wizarding World with no knowledge of the Old Ways. The purebloods weren’t happy. I mean, of course they weren’t, their culture was being erased. Hardly any wizards and witches today practice the Old Ways. People don’t even really celebrate the holidays,” Hermione said sadly.
Harry’s cheeks were no doubt brighter than a tomato by now. His eyes started to water, but he blinked them away. He’d always considered Ron and Hermione his family, but it filled his heart to know they thought of him the same way. He wiped the formula on Teddy’s chin with a muslin wrap. “Thank you,” he said quietly.
When they left the office, Hermione rounded on him. “I thought you were just joining the training team.”
“That’s a brilliant idea! I bet he’ll come up with something,” Harry said hopefully. Mrs. Weasley passed the address back to him. “Are any of the others here?” he asked.
“Well, obviously, I don’t agree with them, but I can see why they hate people like me,” Hermione said quickly. “They’re scared.”
He glanced at the fourth person in the portrait. Short and stubby, young Peter Pettigrew seemed to be very far back in the frame and was wisely staying out of the way for this particular reunion. James noticed Harry’s gaze and shook his head firmly.
Ron slapped Malfoy on the back, before collecting Teddy from his arms. “Harry’s just trying to get out of having fun for once.”
“You wish, Malfoy,” Harry said, although his voice had none of the bite it usually had. He turned the can on its side, pierced it, and tipped it up, swallowing the burning liquid quickly.
When Hermione arrived back from Hogwarts, she was out of breath. Gratefully accepting a cup of tea from her boyfriend, she groaned. “That was horrible.”
Ron passed Harry a small bottle. “Fred and George’s hangover cure. It’ll sober you up in five minutes. Fair warning: it’s not pleasant.”
“I’ve come across it a lot in my readings on bonds recently, actually,” Hermione said, waving her wand to neatly make the bed, before primly sitting on the edge. “Lords could invoke it after defeating another Lord in battle, and the defeated Lord’s allies would become their own.”
Kingsley looked into Harry’s eyes with an expression he’d never seen the man wear before. “Harry. Greyback is a bad person. He’s killed hundreds, maybe thousands. Ruined even more lives by turning people. Remus was forever considered a second-class citizen because of what this man did.”
Harry nodded. He supposed there was nothing else for him to do. “There at a Ministry safe house, right?” he asked.
At Harry’s confused look, Hermione sighed. “When Voldemort was younger, before he went mad from making the…” she trailed off, glancing uncomfortably at Malfoy. They had decided not to tell anyone about the Horcruxes. As far as the three were concerned, the less people knew about them, the less likely they’d be to create them. Harry nodded at Hermione, indicating he understood. She continued. “Anyway, before he went properly dark, he wasn’t trying to kill muggleborns.”
Malfoy coughed awkwardly. “Anyway, there’s also Marjory Boot, Terry’s mother. I’ve never met her, but her son is quite sensible. He fought for your side.”
Harry groaned, and rubbed a hand over his face. “Look, it was just a one-time thing, alright? Kingsley asked me to do it. I’m not on some vigilante mission to kill all Death Eaters,” he whispered furiously.
Harry felt the magic settle over his bones. “More than. Thank you.” He turned to the door and cast the privacy wards from earlier.
Malfoy shrugged. “She’s destroyed her mental walls. She can’t compartmentalise anymore. It’s like she’s reliving all of her memories at once.”
“A portrait is but a glimmer of one’s true self. I do not wish to be trapped here in this temporary light. My husband commissioned this for me against my wishes. He did not know me very well,” she said. Harry understood, and he even felt a twinge of sympathy for the woman.
Harry nodded. Holding the bottom of the frame, he closed his eyes and willed it to come unstuck. It became heavy in his hands. Placing it on the ground and leaning it carefully against the wall, he took a step back.
“I’m aware,” Harry said darkly. He could see where this was going. “What has that got to do with me interrogating him?”
Malfoy positioned Harry so that he was seated in one of the armchairs. “Back straight. You’re a Lord, Potter, act like one,” he admonished.
“Mum. She went to visit when Lucius died,” Ron explained, shrugging. “Said that no one deserves to be alone in grief. She volunteers at Mungo’s a lot now, to keep her mind off Fred.”
Malfoy indicated for him to sit down at the head of the table. Harry did as he were bid and indicated for Grannuff to take his place.
In the end, they only kept five of the objects: a crystal bottle filled with dove’s blood, which, when written with, would make a magical oath more binding; a silver dagger, which could keep a victim alive forever but in excruciating pain; a golden snuffbox filled with human ashes, which could cause a person to fall into an enchanted sleep; and two gris-gris bags made from a human burial shroud.
Hermione frowned. “Voldemort is dead, yes, but he was only the figure head of the blood purity movement. You may not like it, and believe me, I don’t, but the purebloods have every right to feel the way they do about muggleborns.”
“Yeah, well, I can’t sleep if I don’t take it,” Harry grumbled, although perhaps two bottles had been an overkill.
Bill nodded gravely. “Harry’s wand can’t be traced by the ministry. Kingsley wants him to break him.” He ran a hand through his hair tiredly. “I can’t say I’m not surprised. I guess I thought more of Kingsley. He was a Slytherin, though,” he mused. “Not that that means he’s evil, necessarily,” he added at Hermione’s face. “Just that he’s ambitious. As for Greyback: I don’t want that bastard to walk free. I know she’d never say so, but I can tell Fleur hates him for what he did to my face.” Bill turned to Harry. “What do you need from me?”
Hermione frowned, reading it, and comparing it to her records. “There are 8000 galleons missing from the Potter accounts,” she muttered, handing the parchment to Malfoy.
“Okay, now, put your right hand on the other’s cheek,” Malfoy said, looking hesitantly at Harry. Harry wanted to touch as much of Malfoy’s body as he was allowed, so he reached for Malfoy’s cheek first. His jaw was taught, as if he were clenching it, and Harry could feel a light amount of stubble. Malfoy lightly touched Harry’s cheek, and Harry wanted to do this forever. They walked in a circle. After a moment, Malfoy told them to spin away from their partner. Harry did as he was bid, although he savoured the feeling of Malfoy’s face in his hand for a millisecond longer than he should have. When they faced each other again, Malfoy smiled brightly at him.
“Ah, Harry. Thank you for coming. Well done for passing Robards’ test. He was rather impressed with you. How was your first day?” Kingsley asked as Harry entered his office.
Harry pulled a face. “Yeah I am. I was really excited, but Kingsley’s turning it into a press thing. I wanted to go with Polyjuice.”
“No, you won’t be able to access thoughts you don’t want the other to see, but I just mean it’s a bit more intense than what you’ve already got. Not to mention, it’s ancient and therefore incredibly risky,” Hermione warned.
Harry blinked. Ron very rarely voiced his opinion in large groups. Harry and Hermione knew he was brilliant, of course - he always knew what to say when Harry and Hermione got too passionate. He was their voice of reason – a quiet voice of reason amidst the chaos of Hermione’s brilliance and his own fiery emotions.
. “Excellent, Madame Malkin and her assistants should be here any second,” he drawled, glancing Harry up and down. “They’ve got their work cut out for them.”
Malfoy stepped back. “Alright, Potter, I’d best be off. Mother will be wondering where I am, anyway. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“I’d still feel better if we had some sort of contingency,” Hermione piped up. “I could write up a contract but I’d need longer than we have. The only other thing I can think of is an Unbreakable Vow.”
Harry nodded in confirmation but frowned slightly. He wasn’t sure he wanted the public to find out about all of this just yet. The dressmaker reassured him. “Lord Potter, we have dressed and fitted the Heads of the most Ancient and Nobel Houses of Britain for centuries. We pride ourselves on our integrity and discretion. If you so wish, however, we can make an Oath that no one outside these four walls will hear of this meeting.”
Teddy started to stir, and Harry knew it was time for breakfast. “We’ll leave you to rest, Malfoy. I’ll have Kreacher send up some breakfast.”
“The representative from Gringotts will be here any moment now,” Malfoy told him. “I imagine we’ll spend the rest of the afternoon after that visiting your estates.”
Harry removed his gaze from Draco’s and inclined his head. “Your son is a talented instructor, Narcissa,” he complimented, lying through his teeth. “And, as ‘your Lord’, I’d ask that you call me Harry, at least in private company.”
“I hope you know that I am sorry – so much so that I cannot express in words – and I hope you know that I will spend the rest of my borrowed time on earth to try to make up for my past. But know, also, that I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness, and I do not deserve kindness. I was going to make a Wizard’s Oath, promising as much, but definitions of ‘good’ can be misinterpreted by magic and I don’t want to make an Oath that is wrong. Instead,” he said, turning to an alarmed Harry before bending a knee. “I, Lord Malfoy, solemnly swear that I will spend the rest of my life, which I owe to Lord Potter, working towards the light, and avoiding the dark.”
The room went silent as Harry realised what he’d just asked. He bit his lip. “I’ll explain in a moment.”
Kai clapped him on the back. “Well, they know now in either case,” he said and led the group down the stairs.
Harry nodded. He still felt incredibly conflicted about the whole thing. He wasn’t a murderer – or, well, he was but not properly. And he didn’t want to torture someone, no matter how deserving they were of it.
An older, heavily scarred man nodded at Harry but didn’t reach for his hand. “James Clagg,” he said in a thick Scottish accent.
Roslyn smiled at him and indicated to their left. “Through here is the family room, Master,” she said, pausing. “I think you’ll want to see it.”
Ron nodded. “Greyback is impervious to Veritaserum, and the ministry hasn’t been able to get anything out of him through legilimency. He’s claiming he only worked for Voldemort during the war under duress. Kingsley is concerned he’ll walk free.”
“There’ll always be another fucking war!” Harry said, fighting to keep his voice low. “There’s nothing I can do, anyway. Most of the Death Eaters are in Azkaban already, and the others are being hunted down by the aurors. What do you want me to do?”
The elf nodded. “I am Roslyn. This is Mimsey,” she said, indicating the elf who had spoken before, “and this is Hokka.” The last elf was larger than the other two and remained silent as he looked at Harry with scrutiny but nodded in deference as he was introduced.
Eventually, Kreacher reappeared, telling Harry quietly that it was time for dinner. It seemed to be a quiet agreement between Hermione and the elf. Kreacher would remind Harry to eat at least three times a day. Harry didn’t really get hungry – he supposed it was a leftover survival instinct from his childhood. If he didn’t notice the hunger, he wouldn’t notice that he wasn’t being allowed to eat as much as Dudley.
Harry shuddered, remembering the train station and Voldemort’s creepy toddler body. “Yeah, not sure I want to risk it.”
With a pop, Harry and Malfoy landed in a shady corner about five blocks from the muggle pub Neville had booked. He glanced at the blond questioningly.
She blushed fiercely. “Honestly, Harry. You know I’d never. I’m just remarking that its interesting.”
Cragg slapped him on the back. “You probably won’t need it, but that vest is laced with protective spells. An AK can still get through, and a few seriously powerful dark spells, but it should save you from the worst of the damage of other spells. Fair warning: it still hurts like a bitch if you get a
Harry’s shoulder slammed into the waist of the Death Eater. As they tumbled to the ground, Harry felt the man lose his grip on his wand. Harry grabbed it without pause. Turning his own wand on the man, he rolled away, back onto his feet. He ducked a stray curse flying overhead, before casting an extremely powerful stunner and incarcerous on Crabbe.
Harry frowned. He didn’t know if he just wanted people joining his family for his money, and Malfoy looked seriously dejected. “Well, I’ll end up paying for them either way. You may as well keep being the Head of your House. I don’t want to be in charge of that many people.”
Harry nodded, handing her the sheet of paper. “Come around whenever you like. Fair warning: Malfoy might be there.”
Malfoy turned around, his cheeks pink with exertion and long hair slipping out of its bun. “Potter, Granger, Weasley,” he nodded at them aristocratically, but the affect was kind of ruined by his general demeanour.
Roslyn led them down the stairs into a bright kitchen with a small dining table. Opening what appeared to be a regular cupboard, Roslyn stepped through to reveal a large potion’s lab. “She didn’t live here for long, but your mother spent a lot of time in here,” the elf said, her voice laced with regret. “Mistress Lily was very kind. She taught me to read.”
“We will talk about this later,” Hermione growled, deciding against having a full-scale verbal spar outside the DMLE Headquarters.
“Ron, what we’re about to do, it’s treasonous,” Harry said. “If we tell him what our plans are, he could report us to the Ministry and we’d go to Azkaban. Kingsley wouldn’t be able to protect us. I know he’s your brother, but are you sure we can trust him?”
Malfoy managed to down half of the can before he started spluttering. His eyes were bright as he looked at Harry. Harry couldn’t hear what he was saying, however, too distracted by the sight of Malfoy. He looked dishevelled, but in the best possible way, with flushed cheeks, sparkling eyes, and the first few buttons of his shirt undone, exposing his long neck.
“That’s amazing, Harry! He’s really showing he can understand us. That’s very advanced for an infant of that age,” Hermione started talking. Turning thoughtful, she said, “You know, this could prove really interesting for paediatric studies…”
Stepping outside Grimmauld Place, they checked for any nearby muggles or wizarding witnesses. Seeing it was clear, Ron kept his gaze on the street, wand at the ready, while Harry turned to face the house.
“I’ll have you know, I’d make an excellent Dark Lord … Dark Lady – Has there ever been a Dark Lady?” Hermione asked.
“You killed Greyback. Ginny’s face gave it away. And the blood on Ron’s shirt. I want in. For Fred,” he said plainly.
“No, Potter. We’re betrothed. One day, when I find the person I actually want to be with, we’ll get black out drunk and have sex. Then, while Pansy’s pregnant, I’ll get married to my person. When the baby is born, it’ll be technically illegitimate, but I will recognise it officially as my heir,” Malfoy explained.
Teddy gurgled and suddenly his hair turned bright orange. Harry stared at the baby in shock. Teddy had changed the colour of his hair many times, mostly to indicate who he wanted to hold him, but he’d never done it as a response to a question before. He grinned at Hermione. “I think that means you have Teddy’s seal of approval, boys,” he smiled at them.
Malfoy nodded tiredly. Quietly, he murmured, “Last year, Severus gave me a piece of paper with this address. He gave me an emergency portkey to take me here if I was ever in a situation where I couldn’t apparate. I vowed not to tell anyone of it.”
P.S. Also, I know next to nothing about Indian culture, but this is what I gathered from my friend from Ludhiana, Punjab, the other day when we were having a similar-ish conversation the other day. Please let me know if this is incorrect.
Calling goodbye to the members of the burrow, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Teddy stepped through the fireplace, calling for Harry’s first ever home.
“You’ll be fantastic, Ron,” Harry said, grinning broadly as he scooped up Teddy from Hermione’s arms. “What do you think, Teddy?”
Hermione stood up from the bed and unruffled her clothes. “Alright, boys, we’d better be off. You know how McGonagall gets.” Looking at George hopefully, she added, “Do you want to come to?”
“The same thing you did with the wards earlier. Just will the magic to do your bidding. Here, try to disarm me, but don’t think of a spell. Just will it to happen,” Cragg said.
When Harry returned to his living room, he was treated to the sight of Draco Malfoy very carefully cradling Teddy in his arms as he spoke quietly to Hermione. Harry stood still and just watched, knowing he should make his presence known, but enchanted by the sight of his once-enemy – now friend? – war hardened, posh, stoic, Draco Malfoy, very gently, very carefully rocking his godson back and forth. It was the first time Harry had seen the man interact with the baby, and, although he looked highly uncomfortable, Harry couldn’t help but think Draco looked incredibly attractive standing in Harry’s living room, holding Harry’s godson, wearing incredibly tight black jeans.
A line of fire started at the far end of the room and snaked along each wall, coming towards them. Then, there was a soft whoosh as the two trails of fire joined at the door behind them, effectively sealing them inside. The flames danced threateningly up the wall, crackling softly, and providing light to every corner of the room. Fiendfyre. Harry’s stomach flipped.
“Scared, Potter?” Malfoy smirked at Harry’s hesitation. His voice was so familiar, and baited Harry in just the right way.
Harry clenched his jaw as he took out his wand. “Let’s go, Bella,” he said quietly, and cast a strong
Harry glanced down at Teddy, and, since his face was currently smushed into his chest, he unwrapped him from the sling and cradled him in his eyes. Turning his body sideways, he said quietly, “Look, Teddy. It’s our dads.” Teddy gazed at the portrait
Hokka shrugged and moved his hands and fingers in a strange manner. Roslyn looked exasperated at him, but translated, “You are already exceeding his expectations.”
“Right,” Malfoy started. “Bow to your partner,” he instructed. Harry felt heat rising to his cheeks but was determined to not give Malfoy the satisfaction of him failing.
He surged ahead, sidestepping the next curse and allowing his shield to absorb the impact of the following one with a loud gong-like noise. He saw Crabbe draw his wand back, ready to cast another Unforgivable.
Harry shuddered at the idea of Voldemort being his counterpart, but nodded at the goblin, allowing the subject to drop.
Harry shuddered as the magic flowed over him. “You dumb shit!” he exclaimed, pulling Draco to his feet. “Haven’t we got enough bonds and vows and debts? The magic will fuck with us, and I don’t want to order you around anymore. Do you not remember what happened the other day?”
Malfoy waved him off. “Not your fault,” he grunted, gratefully accepting a cup of tea from Kreacher.
The reporters took a few more photos and asked a few more questions, but, after it became clear that Harry was not going to give them anything else, rather guiltily filed out of the building.
“Well you can’t let Teddy grow up in a world where you’re not there to raise him!” Hermione ground out.
ing them at once. Ron rushed over grabbing some towels from Kreacher and pressed hard onto Malfoy’s chest. He blanched at the blood but kept the pressure on the wound. Hermione uncorked the dittany and passed it to Harry. Harry was poured the entire bottle onto Malfoy’s chest. “
“Won’t be fun for the death eater, either,” Ron muttered. “Dad told me about the interrogations. It sounds awful.”
Ron clapped him on the back. “Well, you’re alive. That’s all that matters. Have you read the paper?”
“Oh brilliant, I’m starving,” Ron said as he swapped the bag of curries, rice and naan from Harry’s hand with his gurgling black-haired godson.
The kitchen at Grimmauld Place looked like a bomb had gone off in it. Piles of papers were strewn everywhere, and, in the same seat in which Harry had left him in, Malfoy was scribbling furiously with a quill, ink splattered up and down his arms.
Harry surged forward, ending the silencing charm and calling for Hermione and Ron. Malfoy’s shirt was drenched in blood. Quickly, he levitated Malfoy to the couch, calling as he did so for Kreacher.
Harry sighed. “I do, but I don’t know of any other protective charms. Kingsley was worried. I have to agree with him. It feels weird to say, but I trust Malfoy. I just don’t know how many more people Snape told about this place. I don’t mind one death eater popping up on my doorstep, but I’d rather not have any more surprises. Especially with Teddy living here.” He started cutting up his potatoes but made no move to eat them. “I’ve told Kingsley that I won’t do it long-term. He said he’d research some other options, but…” he trailed off, looking hopefully at Hermione.
“Luna and I became quite close while she was at the Manor. I brought her food and such. I was looking for a way to get her out. She was going to testify at my trial, but didn’t need to,” Malfoy said quietly, nodding at Harry. He cleared his throat. “Regardless, she is part of my House. Xenophilius is providing us an allowance until we get on our feet.”
This one is still a bit expositiony - sorry! Hopefully it's still interesting. The bonding will be next chapter. :)
James smiled. “You’d best finish your tour of the house, Harry. We’re not going anywhere,” he said self-deprecatingly. Harry blinked and realised for the first time in his life, his three father-figures literally couldn’t go anywhere.
“Erm … he’s not very friendly,” Harry warned, not wanting to get her hopes up. Harry wondered if Kreacher would even want to leave Grimmauld Place. He was still very attached to his memories of his old masters. Harry supposed if he didn’t, he could set it up as an office or something. Not that he had use for an office of any sort. Filing those thoughts for later, he turned to the others. “We should probably be going back now, Malfoy’s waiting for us.”
Harry’s heart flipped. All anyone had talked about for months had been the proposed bill for all convicted Death Eaters to have a Dementor’s kiss. He made a mental note to follow up with Hermione on the matter. Did he have a legal right as the “victor” of the war to request a different sentencing? He paused at that: what on earth would he counter-propose? He couldn’t ask for them to be held indefinitely at Azkaban; for one thing, as George had pointed out, the prison was far too easy to break out of, and he was sure the Ministry’s budget didn’t need such a large strain. He rubbed his scar. “Why would someone sign up to be a vassal anyway? Voldemort had plenty of followers that weren’t bound to him in that way. And people used to follow him for his charisma and power, not just out of fear. You were in love with him, and you believed he loved you too. Why did you volunteer to be his vassal?”
Harry blinked in surprise. “I didn’t realise it was that recent,” he said, shocked. He knew he’d get an earful from Hermione about not paying attention in History of Magic. His stomach curled at the thought that his mum had probably not had the chance to vote before she died.
Harry didn’t even have time to acknowledge his victory over Crabbe, before Jugson unleashed another Unforgivable at him. Harry dived backwards, landing painfully on a piece of debris from the wall. He sat up and hurled a few attacks at the Death Eater. They weren’t specific spells or curses or hexes, but they hit the man hard. Before he could recover, Harry leapt to his feet and cast a paralysing curse at him. It hurtled towards Jugson, who blocked it easily and responded instantly with a curse of his own. They exchanged curses at a phenomenal rate, which would have even stressed the reflexes of Viktor Krum. As soon as Harry blocked one attack, there was another on the way. It soon seemed he hadn’t managed an offensive spell in ages.
“I’m not surprised,” Ginny commented. “He was always second to Hermione in class,” she added thoughtfully. “How’s Ron handling it?”
“What should we do with him?” Ron asked, nudging the newly-stunned werewolf with his toe. “He’d kill us if the roles were swapped.”
Malfoy sucked in a breath. Harry internally rolled his eyes, knowing he had broken some sort of pure-blood protocol. The goblin, however, smiled in a way that Harry was sure was not meant to be nasty. “You are wise, Lord Potter, to seek forgiveness from the goblins. Many wizards wouldn’t. The hole has already been repaired.” Grannuff paused, and then added, “The goblins do not interest themselves with the wars of wizards, but I am glad to be having this conversation with you rather than your counterpart.”
The man growled and turned his attention to Harry. “Don’t talk about my son, Potter,” he said angrily, dropping the fiendfyre and shooting a stunner at Harry. “Stupefy!”
Ron, Hermione, Harry, Teddy and Malfoy were soon standing on the grassy knoll that faced Potter Manor. Harry turned to Malfoy, who was looking green.
As he let the water run over his body, washing away the blood and dust and grime and dirt of the day’s fight, Harry tried to ignore the way his hands were shaking. A medi-witch had told him he had a mild concussion. That was the only reason he’d cast the Unforgivable. He was distracted. Wasn’t thinking straight. He wasn’t turning dark. Not really.
Roslyn smiled as she took their coats. “Pleasure to meet you, Master Malfoy,” she said, curtseying. She grimaced slightly but tried to hide it. “I have met many of your elves. The Malfoy family are neighbours to the Potters.”
As Harry turned onto Islington High Street, he couldn’t help but gasp when he spotted Malfoy walking from the station. In all the seven years Harry had known him, he couldn’t recall a single time Malfoy had worn muggle clothing. Yet, here he was, strolling towards Harry with the same confidence he’d always had, but dressed in black skinny jeans, a white t-shirt and a khaki and white plaid over shirt, long hair in a messy bun.
Harry, making sure to keep his back straight, leant over Malfoy’s hand. His lips were so close to them, he could also taste the vanilla and sandalwood hand cream he had seen the man use at his kitchen table.
Malfoy swallowed. “Erm, you need to help with interrogations,” he said quietly, instantly dropping his aristocratic tone.
“You mean it’s whiskey that has the potential of tasting like earwax or disappointment?” Draco asked. “Brilliant business idea, but no thank you.”
Suddenly, there were gasps and shouts and cameras flashing. Harry looked grimly at Hermione and Ron. They smiled sympathetically. Quickly casting a silencing bubble charm around Teddy, he marched with purpose to the front gate, in front of which the reporters were gathered.
Harry nodded, but grabbed a blank piece of parchment. It was thicker than the stuff he usually used and picking up the quill resting in the ink pot next to it, he realised that it too was much fancier than the one he had found in the bottom of his school trunk. Glancing at the note to see how he should structure it, he wrote:
Narcissa Malfoy nearly collapsed as she stepped out of Harry’s floo and into the formal sitting room of Grimmauld Place. Draco emerged from the green flames quickly after and was by her side in an instant, gently holding her elbow.
Harry nodded. The Dursley’s. “Good to know how much I am worth,” he muttered. Addressing the goblin, he asked, “How many people have access to these accounts now?”
Harry laughed and chatted with the others, barely noticing when they’d left the relative safety of the Auror headquarters. Whispers followed him everywhere, so Harry paid them no mind until they’d reached the stairs leading down to the atrium, and a dozen reporters started shouting his name.
Harry shrugged. “Okay; I think his starting to warm up to him. I am too. He’s actually not that bad a bloke when he’s not …”
Harry, Ron and Bill spent the rest of the night in a whiskey-fuelled haze. Hermione had tried to confiscate their liquor at some point but took one glance at their faces before deciding to join them.
Harry knew exactly what that meant, even though he was fairly sure what had just come out of Draco’s mouth was another language. “I don’t want to be King,” Harry said quietly. “Would you want to?”
With their nods of agreement, Harry continued. “I promise that there will be an opportunity – a more appropriate opportunity – for you to ask questions shortly. Until then, I’d be most grateful if you could treat the Ministry with the respect it deserves and try not to disturb it during working hours.”
“Ah yes, I can imagine caring for a baby has been quite a challenge. You’re so young, Harry. Are you sure you don’t want to put Teddy in someone else’s care? I’m sure we can find someone suitable,” Kingsley said lightly.
“Fuck right off, Harry Potter. You cannot and will not have a normal life. You’re the fucking boy-who-lived. The Saviour. It’s not fair and it’s not right, but you have a responsibility to fix this world before there’s another fucking war,” George said lowly.
“Almost as inspiring as Henry V, Potter,” a voice drawled from the doorway. Everybody swivelled to look at Draco, no doubt with warring expressions of acceptance and distrust. Draco took it in stride, though, quietly coming to Harry’s left and placing two pints on the table. He took a deep breath. “Thank you for inviting me, Heir Longbottom,” he said formally.
Harry, Proudfoot and Savage gripped on to the boot tightly as they started to spin rapidly and blinked out of existence.
He glanced at the aurors in this room. He wondered if they’d decide follow him, like Ron and Hermione and Ginny and Neville and Luna and all of Dumbledore’s Army and all of the Order of the Phoenix had. He had no right to expect this, of course – he’d only known them for two days. He didn’t even want them to, he thought. He’d always hated his fame, had always hated that those around him always seemed to have to risk their lives for his. He thought about Fred. Glancing at Elfie, he was reminded of Colin’s still body after the Battle. He was so young – had so much in his future. He would have made an excellent journalist. A real one – not gossipy and corrupt and biased like Rita Skeeter, or as fundamentally mad as Xenophilius Lovegood (he loved the man’s daughter but Harry was willing to admit that they both were a little strange). He thought of Teddy and wondered about the life that he would grow up to have. What would he be like? Would he be a professor like his father? An auror like his mother? A criminal like Sirius (Harry certainly hoped not)? Whatever he became, though, he would be free to choose. Unlike Colin, and Fred, and Lavender, and all the other students who had died fighting for the world they wanted to live in – a world where Voldemort and his Death Eaters couldn’t and didn’t rule.
“Whatever you say, lover boy,” Ron wiggled his eyebrows from across the table. It seemed that he, Hermione, Ginny and George had been there for a while, while Harry and Draco had been talking philosophy.
Hermione rolled her eyes, but everyone knew the first thing she’d do when they got home would be to research it. She pulled out several plain gold rings and dumped the blood onto them. “These work like the coins we had in 5
“I’m going with him,” Hermione said, correctly interpreting Harry’s concerned face. “We’ll do it together.”
Robards levitated the bodies of Jugson, Crabbe, and Avery – absolutely wrecked by Proudfoot and Savage – and left Harry and Savage to be fussed over by two medi-witches.
Harry nodded shortly. Malfoy smirked, but turned to business. “I think for security reasons, we should keep the vaults at Gringotts separate. They should be under one account, though. This amount of paperwork is quite ridiculous,” he drawled at Grannuff.
Malfoy nodded once. “I’d rather not put my life into your hands once again, but I follow the Old Ways. I give myself willingly.”
“I think so,” Harry nodded. “It’s certainly much nicer than here. Plus, I think it’d be good for Teddy to be around Remus.” At Ron’s look, Harry added, “I know it’s not really him. It’s just a portrait. But I didn’t know what my mum or dad looked like until I was 11. I don’t want that for Teddy.”
Harry smiled at her. McGonagall had never struck him as the maternal type, but the soft smile on her face made him reconsider. She had always cared deeply for her students, Harry supposed. “Good to see you, Professor. How are the restorations coming along?”
On the first basement level, Harry had Ron put out the lights. He opened the door silently and peeked around the corner. To the right stood two guards chatting quietly. They were standing in front of a large glass cell in which a snarling Fenrir Greyback was imprisoned. He let the door close.
Ginny blew a raspberry. “That boy is a tornado,” she sighed, looking at Harry’s nails which were now a bit splodgy.
Something shifted in the air. The magic that swirled around him didn’t feel like his usual out-of-control magic, although it still felt familiar. It felt older – almost ancient.
“I hope you can hold fiendfyre better than your son, Crabbe,” Harry said. It was a low blow. It felt wrong to mock his son’s death, no matter who his son was. He couldn’t imagine losing Teddy. Still, he needed to end this stalemate.
Harry hesitated. “No offence, Kreacher, but why do you want to help me?” he asked, hoping he didn’t sound impolite.
Robards nodded, but Hermione coughed. “No, Harry, you need to go back down. If they don’t see you leave, they’ll stay all day and interfere with the people who work here,” she said.
As soon as Kreacher was out of sight, Harry rounded on the three at the table. “What the actual fuck are you talking about?” Harry snarled. “That sounds like indentured servitude.”
Teddy was in Ginny’s arms on the couch. She blinked sleep from her eyes as the floo chimed. “You look like shit.”
Malfoy gestured at the box in front of him. Harry opened it cautiously. Inside were five rings, each with a silver band, but with different gems.
Malfoy fished for a list that he had written under a stack of paper. Handing it to Harry, he quirked his lips when Harry gasped in shock.
“Damnit,” Harry swore, glancing at the others. He hadn’t thought to take his Auror robes off. “I don’t know if Robards wanted people to know yet.”
With a pop, the house-elf appeared. “Master called?” he asked, slightly sardonically, before seeing the body lying on the couch. “Young Master Malfoy,” the elf whispered.
Hermione grinned. “’Course not. I’ve not seen you that excited since the Canons drew with the Caerphilly Catapults.” Ron and Harry turned to look at her blankly. “Honestly, boys, I do listen, you know.”
Harry shuddered. He couldn’t help but spare a thought for his aunt, uncle and cousin. They were abusive and neglectful arseholes, but Dudley had apologised – kind of – and Petunia had done that weird thing when she said she lost a sister when Harry lost a mother. They certainly had quite a bit of nasty karma coming their way, but they didn’t deserve to be the targets of some rogue Death Eaters. He knew the Weasleys were relatively safe in the Burrow, due to the insane amount of Ministry-approved (and not-so-approved) protection spells and wards, but he couldn’t help but worry for them, too.
“Be King?” Draco considered. “As a Slytherin, I suspect I’m meant to say yes. Ambition and all that. But, honestly, no. I’m quite content to be on the sideline, using their power for my own nefarious purposes. Besides, Kings have a habit of dying young, and I’m a Malfoy first. Self-preservation is the essence of my moral fibre.”
“Well, he was doing questionable things before you were born, too,” Hermione continued. “In addition to the whole Grindelwald debacle, he changed a lot of laws about muggleborns. You know, once upon a time, we were told of our magic before we turned 11. The Ministry knows if you’re magical when you’re born. It makes no sense for us to be denied the truth. It puts people in danger.
“I’ve been doing some research, actually,” Hermione piped up. Ron and Harry worked to hide their grins. Harry could have sworn he saw Malfoy’s lip twitch, too. “I think you’ll need to teach Harry some of the Dark Arts.”
Harry couldn’t help but think that it would be much easier if Malfoy just came with them, but he couldn’t wait to see the house. Nodding his goodbye to Malfoy, and wrapping Teddy in his sling, he linked arms with his friends.
Harry decided to change the subject. “Kingsley spoke to me today. Robards is offering us all a spot in the training squad.”
“Reveal it to me,” Harry commanded, running out of patience for these games quickly. Hermione and Ron would be home any moment.
“More than Voldemort ever did,” Harry grumbled. Not wanting to dwell on those unpleasant thoughts, he pulled out the small piece of parchment that had his address on it. “Read this,” he said, allowing Malfoy’s eyes to scan it before pulling out his muggle lighter and setting it on fire.
Harry sat straight in his chair, feeling a bit ridiculous. Malfoy nodded his approval and took a step backward. Looking a bit embarrassed, he shrugged and knelt on one knee before Harry. Harry was so startled that he barely heard Malfoy speak.
Neville let out a huff. “It’s alright. You’ll get them eventually,” he said, smiling, but Harry could see a flicker of disappointment.
Harry nodded. They had discussed it at length. Hermione was keen to finish her studies, but both Ron and Harry were unsure. He thought about it for a bit. “How many death eaters are unaccounted for?” he asked suddenly.
“I should probably sit the test,” Harry admitted. “I’d completely forgotten about it. I don’t want to get special treatment.”
Harry swallowed. Without realising it, he’d sat at the head of the table. Again. “Erm. Well, he knows everything, so if you want to ask me questions about the past couple of days, you can while he’s here. It’s really weird to say, but I trust him. I don’t expect you guys to, but yeah, if it’s worth anything, I do.”
The next morning, Harry woke up with the worst headache he’d ever had. For a moment, he forgot that Voldemort was dead and raised his mental shields, not wanting to let the bastard back into his head. “Ugh,” he groaned, realising it was simply a fierce hangover from the night before.
Harry grinned. “It was fantastic! You should see it – its huge. The elves are really nice. Apparently, I have a Pegasai – can you believe it? I want to move there as soon as possible.”
The others nodded, and Harry summoned the objects. Soon, the four found themselves sitting in a circle in one of the cells, levitating each of the objects into a ‘keep it’ or ‘destroy it’ pile.
Harry nodded. “I don’t want to join the training program. If Robards is okay with it, I’d like to find them with the rest of the aurors. After they’re caught and given a fair trial, I’ll decide what to do.”
Harry, Proudfoot and Savage instinctively formed a small triangle, keeping their backs to each other as they eyed the room for signs of life. Harry was about to cast a
The elf had the decency to blush but lifted her chin defiantly. “I’m sorry for your loss, Master Malfoy.”
He was lying on the floor in his living room. Glancing up, he could see Malfoy peacefully asleep on the couch next to him. Harry moved so that he could see the blond better. He smiled in his sleep, and the forehead creases that Harry was so familiar with place had softened. His blond hair was in a messy bun again on the top of his head, but a few strands had fallen out of the tie and on to his face.
Harry chuckled, sitting down on the floor next to his friend’s armchair. “Rooky mistake.” He glanced at his watch. “He’ll wake up soon for his next feed anyway.”
Harry breathed in sharply. “An unbreakable?” Malfoy nodded. Harry sighed. “What is with Snape and unbreakable vows?”
“What’s your plan, Jugson?” Proudfoot spoke up. “There’s only six - no, five of you left. What do you possibly think you can achieve?”
Ron nodded. “If you’ll have us,” he said nonchalantly, as if he hadn’t just offered Harry the solution to all of his problems. “Hermione wants to track down her parents in the Christmas holidays though.”
Harry nodded slowly. “Bellatrix said something similar last night. But she kept saying the word ‘vassal’ – whatever that means.”
McGonagall smiled at his readiness. “I need you to help with the wards. I will not have Hogwarts vulnerable ever again.” She turned to Harry. “Mr. Potter, I’m sorry to say this but there are quite a few reporters camped at the gate. If you wish to work inside that is fine.”
“I have a question,” Hermione said abruptly. “Malfoy and Potter… Etymologically speaking, the names are very British.”
Malfoy nodded. “It’s okay, Potter. You’ll just need to boss me around sometimes so that the magic doesn’t get too cranky.” At Harry’s worried look, he rolled his eyes. “Just little things. Get me a cup of tea, Get me my coat.” Harry did not like the sound of that at all.
Kingsley frowned, nodding. “Yes, that does pose a few problems. It’ll probably be safest to remove the Fidelius charm entirely and create a new one.” At Harry’s look, Kingsley sighed. “I know you don’t like the Fidelius, Harry, but we can’t exactly have death eaters popping in and out of your house.”
“Get used to it,” Ron grunted. They’d both had their fill of emotions today. “I’m going to have a shower.”
Schooling his expression into one less of shock and one (hopefully) more cool and nonchalant, Harry greeted Malfoy with a nod, handing over his tea.
Malfoy took his glass and sniffed it. “Dry Riesling.” He glanced at Harry. “Potter, I know you’re probably the richest seventeen-year-old in the wizarding world, but you should know that elvish wine goes for an awful amount of money. It’s probably not appropriate to waste it on take-out,” he drawled.
Harry kept his wand sheathed, and marched forward with Savage and Proudfoot. As soon as they passed the barrier of the wards, Harry felt a ripple of Cragg’s protective magic envelop him and sighed in relief.
Harry felt his face flush bright, but Malfoy was apparating before he could say anything, their bodies leaving Grimmauld Place with a loud CRACK.
Hermione attempted to look sympathetic, but, in a very Hermione-like manner, quickly got to business. “Mrs. Malfoy and Draco will be arriving any moment. You should get ready.”
Malfoy nodded. “We’re betrothed,” he said by way of explanation. At Harry’s blank face, he rolled his eyes. “For heirs,” he said, as if it were the most obvious answer in the world.
Malfoy looked at him strangely. “Of course you don’t. You weren’t raised by Potters. Why would you feel the need to apologise?”
Harry smiled. “It’s better than I could do,” he said, and turned to the fireplace. “मेरी माँ और पिता और मेरे गॉडफादर सीरियस और रेमुस को,” he repeated, wincing at his butchering of the language. He spilled the wine into the hearth. Nothing magical happened, but Harry’s heart lifted a bit, knowing that his parents were still with him. “Thank you,” he said quietly to Malfoy.
“Since it gave me a reason not to touch a sheet that someone was buried in,” Hermione retorted, jutting her chin out. “By the way, you will be removing whatever memory you saw in Ron’s brain.”
Everybody nodded solemnly. Harry paused, but then decided to follow Draco’s advice and be honest. “I really don’t know what I’m doing. Malfoy told me to come in here expecting a war council, and, while I think that’s a bit dramatic, I do understand what he meant. We are a council. We advise each other. Well, really, Hermione advises all of us and we just do what she says. But I guess what I’m trying to say is, we’re a team, you know?” He rubbed a hand over his scar. “People keep asking who we’re fighting against, and I’m not entirely sure. But I know who I’m fighting for.”
Harry’s cheeks lit up. He’d only been trying to impress Malfoy and he didn’t have any wine in the house. Malfoy didn’t strike Harry as a beer person.
Grannuff glanced at the document he was holding. “According to our records, 500 galleons were converted to the muggle British pound and withdrawn every year since 1981.”
Harry gulped, remembering the magical dance they had shared that afternoon. Yes, he was. He was seducing Draco Malfoy.
Harry laughed. He turned to Malfoy, who was still making notes on the parchment strewn all over the desk. “What about you, Malfoy?”
The trio - plus Teddy – arrived in the Head’s office. McGonagall was waiting for them and nodded pleasantly when they arrived. “Ms. Granger, Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter,” she smiled at them, glancing at the tuft of blue hair smushed against Harry’s chest. “Mr. Lupin.”
Harry shook his head but raised an eyebrow at his use of Hermione’s given name. “Hermione? Not Granger?”
With their nods of confirmation, Harry took a deep breath. “Okay. Three, Two,” he nodded at Ron to push open the door quickly and take out the lights.
Harry frowned but didn’t press him. He had mentioned it was in Wiltshire. Perhaps it was too close to Malfoy Manor for his comfort. “How do we get there?” he asked, instead.
“I hate this place,” Ron commented as they walked, the sounds of their shoes clacking against dark tiles echoing.
Malfoy rolled his, catching onto his way of thinking. “No. Well, yes, but incredibly far back. A Potter-Weasley match hasn’t occurred in over four centuries. Cedrella was née Black. Your relationship with Weaslette is safe.”
“Fair warning, Granger: you will not be allowed to speak during the meeting. No matter what anybody says. Only the Heads can speak,” Malfoy warned. “Do you think you can keep quiet?” he asked, doubtful.
Kai shrugged. “Well, it was pretty cool – living in a magical castle and all that. From what I gather, though, it was a bit more like a normal muggle highschool than Hogwarts. We had to take a certain amount of non-magical subjects. Math, Literature, Science, Muggle History.”
Harry smiled. “I’m not sure ordering me to order you around is going to help the bond, Draco. Besides, do you really want to go in alone?”
This scene is heavily inspired by a duel I read a few years ago, but I have no idea who wrote it originally. If it sounds familiar to you, and you think you know who wrote it originally, please comment so I can give them due credit.
They spent the rest of the afternoon following Bill around the house as he sought out the dark objects.
year – it can display short messages,” she explained. “If you need to send a message, tap it with your wand and say it out loud. If you’re good at occlumency, you might be able to make a message mentally.”
“Yeah, I know - Hermione told me,” Harry said. He didn’t care much about titles, although he supposed Malfoy probably did. “It doesn’t really matter though, does it?”
“So, an impatient leader,” Kai said. “An unstable second-in-command who vies for the chief position, and four torturous lumberjacks for lackeys. I reckon that if we draw them into battle, they’ll probably underestimate us.”
Robards turned to Harry. “Potter?” he asked. Harry was surprised – he hadn’t thought he’d be involved in the decision-making process. “It’s your life on the line,” the Head Auror said by means of explanation.
“If we don’t start acknowledging the Old Ways now, we will either get dragged into another war, or a whole culture will disappear. I’m not okay with that,” Hermione said with determination.
Bellatrix smiled at him in a way he was sure was not meant to be threatening. “Why, of course. A vassal is an extension of his lord’s magic. In the same way one can find objects and wards of their own casting, so too can a lord find a vassal.” She paused and looked at him critically. “For you to succeed in this, you must first become a true lord – you must accept within yourself that you are your vassal’s rightful lord and that they belong to you. Is my lord Potter up for this task?”
“Your family rings,” Malfoy said by way of explanation. “Put them on your right ring-finger,” he said, showing Harry his hand. Placed on his right ring-finger was a silver band, much like those in the box, with a deep blue gem in the middle.
Roslyn squeaked a little, but nodded, leading them up the grand staircase into the hall of mirrors and through to a large but empty room with a few steps leading to a small stage at the rear. Malfoy nodded approvingly. Roslyn smiled. “We haven’t had a ball in so long!” she said excitedly. “I’ll get Hokka to start preparing the grounds. You will need bonfires, yes?”
“It’s your signet ring. You wear it on the pinkie of your non-dominant hand,” Malfoy told him, showing his own ring on the pinkie of his left hand. “When you send official correspondence, you’ll seal it with your ring.”
Harry nodded, taking his usual place at the head of the table. Ron took his place to his right, Hermione to his left. “Yeah it was weird but fine. By the way, I have to recast the Fidelius. Will one of you be my secret keeper?”
Harry found eighteen eyes staring accusingly at him. He scratched the back of his neck. “Erm, technically, yes.”
In front of the doors to the Auror Department, a tall man with a deep scar on his left cheek was waiting for them. “Mr. Potter,” the man said gruffly, shaking his hand in greeting. “Gawain Robards.”
Harry shook his head. “I can take cruciatus. I didn’t know what that spell did. It was seriously irresponsible. I should’ve just left you alone.”
Ginny scoffed. “You’re an Auror, Harry. You will have to kill again. Probably many times. It will break you. And probably, one day it will start to feel good. That’s when you come to me, and we’ll run away to a tropical island. Take Teddy. Live as muggles or something,” she said this all as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.
“There will always be another war,” Ron and Malfoy said at the same time, looking as shocked as Hermione and Harry. Harry couldn’t help but laugh at their expressions.
Robards shook their hands, too, and lifted the corner of his mouth slightly. “Reckon it’d be hard to not know your three’s names,” he commented wryly. “Sorry about downstairs. They’ve been here all morning. Probably Ambarella’s doing. I’ll have a word with her.”
Ron paused before taking him, eyeing his best mate carefully. Harry raised an eyebrow until Ron nodded and took Teddy. At the door he turned and said quietly, “Careful.”
Draco looked thoughtful. “You probably do have more evil in you than others – you spent seventeen years with a part of His soul in you. That has to add something to you. But I don’t think that makes you a bad person. Sure, you are drawn to the dark, but you actively aim for light – working against your own nature to do good is far nobler than just being good.”
Savage continued. “If we battle, it’ll have to be near Ottery St. Catchpole, where there aren’t as many muggles. Memory modification will be too hard otherwise. Harry should be announced as a member of the team. We’d go on visible patrols. We’d have to stick to a schedule and look disorganised enough that they’d believe they have a chance.”
Grannuff gulped audibly and produced four separate pieces of parchment from the pile. Snapping his fingers, the pages melted together to create one long roll of parchment. “Your inventory, Lord Potter,” the goblin said, handing it to Harry.
Neville himself had written with an invitation to Harry, Ron, Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Dean, Seamus and, notably, Malfoy, for drinks at a muggle pub local to him. He had included a brief explanation in Harry’s, saying that his grandmother had heard from Narcissa what Malfoy and Harry were attempting to do and that she was thrilled. Apparently, all of the ‘Old Crowd’ was. Harry had no idea who that was, but Harry was pleased that Malfoy was invited too. Harry penned a quick acceptance back, asking if it was alright if George came too, thinking it’d be good for him to get out for a bit.
He raised his shield in plenty of time to block a curse from Jugson before diving backwards to avoid an AK from the other. He landed deftly on his feet, before sending a Paralysing curse at the legs of Crabbe. The man conjured a small shield, batting it away to the side. Harry, engaged with Jugson, didn’t notice the AK that Crabbe shot until it was too late to cast a shield.
Malfoy looked shocked but smiled slightly at Ron’s clear acceptance of his presence. Harry grinned. If Malfoy and Ron could get along, anything was possible.
Malfoy shrugged. “Sure,” he said distractedly, his forehead creasing as he read what appeared to be a particularly confusing legal document.
The last question made Harry pause even as more things were shouted at him, but he could feel Hermione tighten her grip on his arm. Glancing up, he saw her shake minutely.
Draco’s eyes widened slightly, telling Harry all he needed to know. Narcissa laughed in surprise. “I see you have indeed been studying the Old Ways,” she said in delight, some strength seeming to return to her. “There were some amongst us who practice that were concerned you would not take the necessary steps.”
Hermione giggled, but dutifully showed Malfoy how to hold the bottle as she pierced it. “It creates an air bubble, see?” she asked. Trust Hermione to explain the science behind a drinking method.
The seven gathered around a conjured desk in the centre of the room as Cragg spread out the blueprint.
Harry snorted. “Full of observations today, aren’t you?” He shifted the baby in his arms, feeling pins and needles in his shoulder. “This is Teddy Lupin. I guess he’s your cousin.”
“If you attempt to apologise to me, I will hex you,” Malfoy said angrily. “I was casting the cruciatus curse
Malfoy quirked a smile. “I know. But you will. Always. And, to be honest, I’m glad you do. It would make my job a lot harder if you didn’t. Besides, it’s good for the people who care about you. The special treatment you get keeps you safe and allows you to be the sanctimonious self-sacrificing and stubborn-headed prat you are.”
“Hey,” Harry said quietly when Malfoy appeared. He did not look well – he seemed even paler than usual and had large dark circles under his eyes. “How are you?”
Robards grunted something that sounded suspiciously like “Dumbledore.” He cleared his throat. “Greyback is holding back information. He is able to resist Veritaserum and has fairly strong occlumency skills. We might be able to get more out of him, but at this moment it looks doubtful. As we do not know where they are, we have to draw them out. We have two options: sting or battle.”
Harry willed her to be quiet. The elderly woman closed her mouth with surprise. “I am Harry Potter, Lord of the Ancient and Most Noble Houses of Black, Gaunt, Peverell and Potter. I need you to answer some questions,” he said, trying to remain calm.
Harry rolled his eyes and quickly kissed Ginny on the cheek, squeezing Hermione’s shoulder as he walked past. “Didn’t Bill want to come?”
The shouts died down when Harry held up his hand. “I will not be answering any questions today. If you would like Hogwarts to be ready to open by September, I recommend you move backwards so I can work. Even better, you could help with the rebuilding effort,” he said firmly.
Kingsley nodded calmly. He never seemed particularly put off by Harry’s anger issues. Harry supposed that was because he’d been there to witness the episode in Dumbledore’s office in fifth year. “I can see you’re firmly against that plan. No matter. Your plans for the next year – I understand you indicated that you wanted to be an Auror?”
He looked down at his shirt. “Yuck. Okay, fine. But this is your fault. You can’t just disappear on us after what we did last night.”
Hermione and Ron entered, although they slowed down when they took in the scene. It wasn’t every day one saw Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy eating together, after all.
Mimsey squeaked. “Don’t get too close to it! It’s under a void,” she said, looking at the piece of muggle technology warily. Voids were very dangerous, very rarely used outside of the Department of Mysteries, as they prevented all magic within them. Ron wisely stepped back, but Hermione edged closer, looking fascinated.
Malfoy nodded. “I’ll teach you. You too, Granger, Weasley. Speaking of, you’ll need a date who can dance. Who are you taking?”
Harry shrugged. “We can move to the kitchen if you’d be more comfortable,” he suggested, ignoring Ron’s incredulous look.
“Thanks, Robards, totally couldn’t have figured that out ourselves,” Savage said sarcastically, rolling up her sleeves and revealing a sleeve of moving tattoos on her left arm.
“Yours too,” Harry said. At Robards’ shrug, Harry sighed. “Are you sure we can’t get more out of Greyback?”
George rolled his eyes good-naturedly. “Relax, Malfoy. Ogden didn’t want bad flavours associated with his brand. So, only the good Bertie Bott’s flavours.” He gestured at the parchments being signed around the table. No one had declined to sign yet. “Thought we might need something stronger than lager.”
Robards shrugged. “They would have found out sooner rather than later. Besides, it made a big difference that you were able to get them to leave.”
Glancing at Ron and Hermione, he grabbed a handful of floo powder and threw it at the hearth. “The Ministry,” he said, trying to muster up some courage.
Glancing down at the wand thrumming in his hand, he sighed. This was certainly going to take getting used to, he thought.
Kreacher started to twist his ears. Harry groaned, remembering Dobby in second year. “No! Kreacher you are never to hurt yourself,” Harry commanded firmly.
“Absolutely not,” Ginny admonished, plucking the baby from his arms. “Come on, Teddy, your godfather has to go and be a badass now.”
Harry thought the rings on his fingers felt a bit heavy and unusual but knew there’d be hell to pay if he tried to take them off.
The witch sighed sadly. “Presumably hundreds, but I don’t know any personally. The Death Eaters didn’t exactly keep a list of everyone they killed.”
Harry shook his head. “Apparently Voldemort’s corrupted slave bond thing that he used to make the dark mark made the Death Eaters his vassals. According to Bellatrix, since I defeated him, I can invoke the right of conquest. His vassals would become my vassals.”
The lift chimed as they reached the second level, and an automated female voice declared, “Department of Magical Law Enforcement.”
Hermione walked in but paused in the doorway when she saw Harry. Harry blushed at her as he quickly stepped away from the couch.
Harry wandered upstairs to have a shower. As he passed the place where Walburga Black’s portrait used to hang, Harry shuddered. He couldn’t wait to get out of this house.
Deciding against using the lifts, they entered a dark stairwell. Ron clicked on the lights with his deluminator, and they all retrieved their wands from their holsters. There was a cold shiver to the air in the stairwell, almost like the breath of a dementor.
“What on earth did I drink last night, then?” Ginny asked accusatorily. “It tasted like goblin’s piss!”
Hermione bounced excitedly but managed to control herself. Harry and Ron shared a look. “What do you need us to do?” Ron asked, ready to get to business.
Draco frowned. “I’m sure that’s not how this is supposed to work.” He cracked a smirk. “I’m okay, but Hermione was doing some research. She thinks she can modify our bond so that it doesn’t require this kind of thing, but, until then, she wants us to do it a bit so that it’s at least sated enough that it doesn’t come out during an argument.”
Balancing the cardboard drinks holder on the bar of the pram with one hand, Harry windlessly cast a stasis charm over the drinks so that they wouldn’t get cold. As he walked, he appreciated being out and about without too many strange looks. There were still a few – after all, a seventeen-year-old boy with a pram wasn’t a very common sight in the streets of Pentonville – but Harry revelled in his relative anonymity.
Malfoy frowned and said nothing for a moment. “Are you aware, Potter, how many darke objects remain in this house?” he asked quietly.
“She’s a Black, or at least she was, but she married a muggle. For my aunt, that was worse than marrying a muggle-born or a blood-traitor,” Malfoy explained. No one needed reminding who his aunt was. “Pity she didn’t get Bella’s tongue too.”
Harry smiled. It was definitely strange spending this much time with his former school nemesis, but he was regrettably starting to enjoy the blond’s dry wit, sarcasm and sass. Hermione was too easily offended to properly banter with, and although Ron and he exchanged brotherly ribbing occasionally, it was nothing compared to Malfoy’s insults. Surprisingly, Harry found the change refreshing.
Malfoy sat down on the couch with none of his usual grace. “She only just went to sleep,” he grunted, covering his face.
“I saw the paper. You did well today,” Malfoy abruptly changed the subject. “I wasn’t expecting there to be quite that much press. I should send Ambarella flowers. Did you get the job?”
P.P.S. I'm not sorry for all the Shakespeare quotes - warning: they will only get more abundant as this story develops.
Malfoy nodded. “There’s also Iola Hitchens, whose an incredible old, yet formidable witch. She’s 146, but when the Death Eaters tried to attack her family last year, she sent four back without their tongues.”
“He’s impervious to Veritaserum. None of us can break him. We cannot, legally, use a strong enough legilimency on him because it would literally cause his head to explode - his mental wards are too strong. We have two options. And both require you to do cast one or more extremely illegal spells so that this son of a bitch doesn’t end up prowling the streets again,” Kingsley explained. “You will not – and cannot – be charged with anything illegal; you and I will be the only people who know what you are going to do, your wand is the only one on earth that cannot be monitored by the ministry, and you can claim deniability because you do not know the law. I took an Oath. I cannot specify what spells or actions you should use, but, I implore you, for Remus, for Teddy, to not hold back. We need his information. We do not need him. If you do not, he will walk free. We simply don’t have enough evidence.”
Harry summoned a few glasses and the elvish wine from the kitchen wordlessly. Hermione raised an eyebrow as he poured but said nothing.
Kingsley nodded slowly. “I can’t say I like this plan, Harry. But I have to admit it will be good publicity.”
The older wizard narrowed his eyes. “Sting: 49% chance of capturing all of them, with 24% fatalities on our side. Battle: 87% chance of capturing all, 61% fatalities.”
Harry’s cheeks went red, mildly concerned. He didn’t want McGonagall to be disappointed in him. “Kingsley told you then?”
The day after the battle had been very bizarre. Neither Harry, Hermione or Ron had slept in over 48 hours by that point – unless one counted the 45 minutes in which Harry had been dead. Instead of grieving with his family for the loss of his brother, Ron had been forced to answer about a thousand questions along with Harry and Hermione from millions of reporters. Deciding to keep quiet about the horcruxes, too, didn’t help their case, as it meant they couldn’t answer many questions about what they were doing the year before. Hermione had spun a tale about working against Voldemort’s dark magic but didn’t go into much detail. The reporters were not best pleased, and the questioning became more interrogative. Ron had eventually given up hiding his frustration and politely told them all where to shove it. Hermione had pretended to be disappointed, but Ron and Harry both knew that deep down she was just as pleased as them when the reporters finally stopped their incessant questioning.
Malfoy sniffed, looking appalled. “Honestly, Potter. How do you live like this?” Retrieving his wand from the sleeve of his robe, he flourished it rather dramatically. Suddenly, the curtains parted, dust flew up from the rug and the room started to smell faintly of jasmine. At Harry’s look of amazement, Malfoy sighed. “I’ll teach you the household charms later.”
“What idea?” Harry asked curiously, finally taking a bite of his food when Hermione kept kicking him under the table.
Luna smiled up at him, not moving from her seat. “Sorry for not standing, Harry. This room is absolutely full with nargles, and Dad has a theory that they’re less likely to attack you when you’re seated.”
Malfoy smirked, “That much is obvious.” Harry held up a hand before Ron attacked the wizard they had just healed.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. Barty Crouch Jr. tried it on me in fourth year. It took a while, but I shook it off eventually.”
Harry sighed heavily. “Well, you’re not wrong.” He turned to Neville guiltily. “I’m definitely not meant to tell anyone this, but you should know. We almost got the Lestrange brothers today, but they got away. I’m so sorry. We won’t stop until we find them.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “I don’t know what to do,” he admitted. “Before it was easy, you know? There was a clear enemy. It was obvious who we were fighting against. Who are we fighting against now? Blood purists who are mainly just ignorant? Hermione thinks we should fight them with knowledge. Ignorance is the enemy of progression and all that. The Death Eaters? Most of them are in Azkaban. George doesn’t think Azkaban is good enough, and that we should go on some sort of vigilante mission and kill them all. Corruption at the Ministry? How does one even begin to fight that, without scrapping the whole thing and starting over again? Do we fight all of them? None of them? I don’t know.”
Harry nodded. He supposed he had the wand of the person who wronged him. Well, not really, considering Voldemort never actually had ownership of the Elder Wand, but close enough. He wondered if Tom Riddle’s old wand was still floating around somewhere.
“Granger very kindly had Kreacher retrieve Potter’s family books for me,” Malfoy drawled, accepting a cup of tea from Hermione with a nod of thanks.
Harry sighed and ran a hand through his hair. “I’d love to, but it’s probably best if I’m not seen in public with you guys until everything’s sorted. Also, I have a meeting with Kingsley.” He shrugged off his red auror robes and pulled on some plain black ones.
Harry smiled. Rolling up his sleeves, he steeled himself before walking out the large oak doors at the front entrance.
We teach those spells to kids. If you can do bad things with ‘light’ magic, why can’t we do good things with ‘dark’?”
“Don’t be daft. There are exactly five people who know the spell that you cast on me in sixth year. One of them is dead. I know it wasn’t me. And there’s precisely one of your Golden Trio who is powerful enough to cast it,” Malfoy snapped. “Do me the courtesy of recognising my general intelligence, Potter.”
Harry wasn’t entirely sure when Bellatrix had begged his forgiveness, but he acquiesced with what he hoped was a regal nod. “Tell me more about that – the right of conquest.”
They did quietly. Harry was unsure how he wanted to address the topic of his employment, so he waited for the Head Auror to start. Robards eyed him for a moment with scrutiny. All of a sudden, Harry could feel a breach on his mental walls. Instead of looking away, he simply forced his walls up, and thought calmly ‘Please get out of my head.’
Robards raised an eyebrow but pressed on. “According to Greyback, Jugson and gang have three safe houses. One of these, we already knew about, and they haven’t been back since the battle. One is in Scotland, nowhere near where they’ve been spotted, and one, a muggle warehouse, just outside Ottery-St.-Catchpole. I suggest we swarm it this afternoon.”
“It is,” Hermione said quietly. She winced when she noticed the weather changing outside. Dark grey clouds were swarming and the tell-tale sound of thunder grew in the distance. “Get yourself under control, please. You’re affecting the weather again.”
“My lord,” she said, bowing deeply. Harry felt a stab of guilt. The portrait believed that Harry would protect her, or, that he wouldn’t destroy her, and yet, Harry had all but just signed her death sentence. He mentally shook himself. The witch had murdered hundreds – tortured and orphaned thousands more; he couldn’t possibly feel sorry for her.
They trio made to leave, but Malfoy stopped Harry at the last minute. “Thank you, Potter. I think you might have just agreed to save the Wizarding World again.”
“Goyle Sr.,” Savage confirmed when he toed over the body. He’d been standing by the door when it blew; he would have been killed instantly. Leaving the body, they crept forward, emerging from the dust to the main hall of the warehouse. There were piles of clothing in separate corners, clearly being used as makeshift beds. A kettle was plugged in at an outlet and Harry almost laughed at the concept of Death Eaters taking tea. He would have made a comment, maybe, but the image of Goyle’s cold body was front and centre in his mind. Where were the other Death Eaters? The room was quiet. Too quiet.
Harry nodded. Teddy stirred in his arms and his hair turned black as he smushed his face further into Harry’s chest. Harry sighed. “I’m doing it for you, Ted,” he whispered quietly.
Taking a few steps forward hesitantly, he peered into the frame, sure he was mistaken. There they were, the marauders.
Harry nodded approvingly. From the amount the woman panicked, he was fairly sure she only had one horcrux, but he needed to be certain. “I will find your body. I will bring it back here, and I will keep it in the dungeon. You, this version of yourself in the painting, may live, as long as you do what I ask.”
They made the slow descent in the lift towards the atrium in silence. Bracing himself, Harry stepped through the doors with more confidence than he’d had earlier. The crowd seemed to sense it, too, as they all parted for him without him having to say anything. Nodding his thanks, he strode with confidence to the grate. Realising a lot of people were listening, he didn’t want them to know where he was going. He grabbed Hermione and Ron’s elbows, prayed to Merlin that his plan would work, and stepped into the flames, screaming ‘The Burrow’ in his mind.
Harry hugged Teddy closer to his chest. “You are not turning my godson into a medical experiment, Hermione.”
“I always have them on me,” he admitted quietly. Harry released a breath. He should have been just as prepared. Of course, someone else would know about horcruxes.
Fifthly - last one I promise! If anyone, anywhere, would be interested in beta-ing, please let me know! I am really rubbish at writing, but I want this to be good. It's going to be a big fic. But, no need to commit! Just one chapter would be very very helpful.
Harry handed off Teddy to him. “Can you pop him in his crib? Be careful,” Harry warned. He hadn’t really trusted Kreacher to hold Teddy yet, although he was fairly confident the elf wouldn’t hurt Teddy. The baby was a Black, after all. “Get some towels, a bowl of hot water and some bandages,” he added, ripping Malfoy’s shirt open without hesitation.
“I’ll have a word with the Prophet,” Harry promised. “Although I doubt they’ll actually listen to me. How many times have I told them to fuck off?”
Greyback’s face went black for less than a moment. He sneered. “Golden boy isn’t so good after all, using an Unforgivable,” he tutted. “Too bad that I can resist it.”
As everyone agreed quietly, Harry refilled everybody’s glasses with a. wave of his hand.  “I need to tell you all something,” he glanced at Neville nervously. “Bellatrix isn’t dead.”
“That’s a brilliant idea,” George said thoughtfully. “The wizarding world hasn’t really got any commercial baby products – most people just use the home recipes, or muggle stuff. I’d bet there’s a real market for it.” He looked at Ron, smiling slightly.
Harry frowned. “No offence, Ron, but the ministry wards are probably insanely difficult. None of us have any experience with them, outside of Hogwarts. I don’t think we’d be able to replicate them.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. Neither sounded particularly good. “If some escaped from the sting, what are they likely to do?” he asked.
Malfoy groaned and opened his eyes. “Wha-“ he started to talk, but soon remembered what had happened.
“Here,” Ron said, summoning two zip-lock bags from the kitchen. It turned out that muggles were far more advanced than wizards when it came to food preservation. He placed each of the gris-girs bags in them and put one in Hermione’s pocket. “I know it’s gross, but it’ll keep us safe,” Ron said, pocketing his own.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “I know we just went on a death-defying mission with him, Harry, but Bill is almost thirty-years-old, has a wife and is trying for a baby. He probably has better things to do than spend his evening drinking with teenagers.”
“Yeah, it was weird,” Harry said. “It was like lots of little threads knitted together. But there are a lot of stitches missing.”
Draco smirked as the magic of the Debt settled over the both of them. “Never knew you were so possessive, Potter,” he drawled.
Draco sighed. “You literally control my life. I’d rather a bit more interdependence, if that’s okay with you,” he said quietly to Harry.
“Yeah. I’m sorry if I overstepped,” Ron said. “I just thought we might need someone to help restore their memories when we find them.”
