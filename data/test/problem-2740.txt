He'd tried after school, wanting to go and look for Draco but always being held back and distracted by Ron who tended to make Harry feel guilty as he claimed that they needed to catch up their lost time together and how much he had missed his friend. There was also Hermione who would drag him and Ron with her to the library to start studying for the N.E.S.T.s, no matter how much Harry would complain that it wasn't even February yet and that it didn't make sense to start studying this early.
wasn't expecting that! Draco felt his face becoming even redder, his eyes widening. "W-what d-do you m-mean?" Draco asked uncertainly, aaand the stammering was back, yay! Draco noticed that exactly when he said those words out loud Harry's once nervous stance turned into something more confident.
Ron stared at him with a look of disbelief before a big smile slowly spread on his face.
"YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER BACK NOW!"
musings that were going on. But his mind was not up for stopping those streams of thoughts any time soon.
Ron still looked at him with disbelief but shrugged when he saw Harry's excited expression.
did want to talk to him. Ever since Harry's name came out of the goblet of fire Ron has been a real prick.
Potter had hugged him. Sniffed him. Licked him.
"Have I done something wrong?" Harry asked unsurely. Draco just huffed and looked the other way.
Was that wrong? Should he have stayed? What was he supposed to do in this type of situation?! Now he really wished he had some past experience! What was the proper thing to do?!
And, ehm, some other stuff…
"…Wait…you really think I…am in love?" Draco asked hoping his mother was joking, that she was playing a prank on him or something like that. But the only thing his mother did was showing her excitement again.
Did he use it for something ordinary? Just wanting to experience a day for the heck of it? Or had he a purpose when drinking it? Maybe wanted it for a Quidditch game or perhaps he used it for passing his O.S.L.s? But then again, Harry wasn't one to cheat. Always the fare and square, righteous idiot he loved.
before…okay, but Harry's mind wasn't really in those, so Draco didn't count those…okay maybe he did, but that wasn't the point! They hadn't really gone farther than kissing, he wasn't even sure if Harry was ready for more, hell! He didn't even know if he was ready for more!
Maybe he didn't want to be his friend after all…
"Shhh!" Harry responded, ignoring Ron.
He quickly crossed out that thought. He couldn't think that. To get his hopes up. Life had never been easy on him, from the death of his parents, to his life with the Dursleys, to the whole Voldemort drama, to the nightmares, to Umbridge, to
'Better to get this over with.'
"Lover…" Draco said breathlessly, his smile only getting wider as he thought about the fact that he, finally, found himself a lover. And not just anybody.
The whine nagging at the forefront of her mind didn't take long to surface. Consequently driving her nose deeper into the boy's column to satisfy her need in finding more of that ridiculous scent. He was talking to her -she noted- but the actual words where a mystery to her fog addled mind.
"Hey! It wasn't my fault Draco was suddenly acting like I was some delicious piece of meat, proceeding to kidnap me and snog me until I was completely overthrown, continuing until I was brought to the edge of paradise! I'm a weak man Hermione!" Harry practically screamed as he threw his hands in the air. It was quiet for a few seconds, until he turned towards Draco and whispered, while biting his lip, "You know, you can do that some more if-if you like, I won't object…"
"Harry you need to get up, you know McGonagall will kill us if we're too late. You too Ron why aren't you dressed yet?!" Neville said his voice full of worry and a little impatience.
Bingo.
Looking back at Draco, his hands clenching into tight fists as he tried to get his breathing under control, he felt himself calming down. The relaxed and dazed look of the Slytherin doing wonders. And he felt himself appreciating the beautiful outline of the boy's face yet again.
"Well, I'm very protective of this person, I don't really understand why though..." But before his mother could say her opinion, the words just flowed out of Draco's mouth like a river.
"Draco my dear, who is this
"No, no, definitely not! No matter…"
"Are we invited?"
He bit his bottom lip, sitting back up and turning around in a cross-legged position. His elbows resting on his knees as he held his arms up so he was still able to fumble with his little golden snitch. He looked up at his friends, his mouth opening, and closing.
Harry looked in amazement when the tall boy named Percy walked through the wall.
Harry heard one of the teacups break as Petunia let out a shocked cry. Dudley was looking at him with his eyes wide and his mouth hanging open. Vernon had immediately laid down his paper and looked at Harry with a horrified look.
Harry said, his voice high before he cleared his throat, "W-what gave you that idea?"
Everything that could've gone wrong went wrong. It already started when he fell out of bed,
"So. How was it?" Hermione heard Ron ask as she was reading the Prophet.
"Hello, Draco." He said, trying to calm himself down even when he didn't know why it was acting the way it did. After Draco had started calling him by his first name, he was acting off, his whole body was. He had felt his throat go dry and his legs turning into jelly. He had felt a feeling in his stomach that he couldn't identify. It was very confusing.
He really needed to be careful, to not get swapped away in the moment before he would do something that he would regret later. He just needed to get his act together and
"Really?" He asked, he was still worried and his friend's weird attitude wasn't helping with it.
After they had called a truce and became friends Harry hadn't seen him much after that. But that didn't matter really since they were going to see each other at potions anyway. Unless he was sick.
Draco's thought process being unbeknownst very much the same. He watched those golden eyes as he came, body shuddering with the force of it. His entire being. His brain not keeping up with him anymore and before he knew it, his attention was diverting, his instincts taking over as he brought the hand that was caressing Draco's face to his blonde locks, turning them to the side and exposing his boyfriend's fair throat. Without hesitation, he bit into Draco's neck, the voice that had been screaming at him finally silenced.
"Come on mister Potter, skipping class will lose your house ten points as well as detention for you young man," McGonagall said, making Harry groan and follow her as they both walked out the hallway.
"I could say the same about you," Harry countered, making Draco break their gaze, admitting defeat. He made an effort to pick up the lost chess pieces, all the while Harry cheered at Draco's surrender. When the board was cleaned up, Draco leaned back against the couch, a smile on his face as Harry watched him.
"I was just picking some wistaria for our potion's homework, you know that their effects are on their full potential when having been plucked in the rain. So I thought it would be a good idea since it may give us extra points to go and find some. But along the way, I remembered that they could only be found in this particular spot in the forbidden forest, which made my trip a bit longer then I anticipated." She sniffed, hugging the cloak closer to her as a shiver ran through her.
"No. The instructions specifically say to cut." Granger being horrified at the idea of not following the book.
' Draco yelled inside his head. Letting out a deep breath from his nose as he moved his hands up against Harry's neck, pushing himself up as he tried to deepen their kiss even more.
She knew she couldn't be always right, stupid past experiences had taught her that but she really wished she had been right about this.
needed a drink.
If he really had been this anxious why not just tell Draco?! They could have worked things out together, maybe even relieved some of his own! But no, Harry needed to rely on liquid luck to flare up their date.
"I think you do, sir. I think you slipped it into Ginny Weasley's cauldron that day in Diagon Alley." Potter exclaimed.
'I heard about him, mainly about how stupid he is.' Draco thought, looking at the man as the scent from earlier hit him. He looked over to see who it was and of course, who was standing there?
"Need help?" He asked as he stared down at Harry.
Draco smelled like a goddamn feast and as the words;
"So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. Let's practice it now. Without wands, please."
…what is life without taking risks?
It was more of the
Harry jumped at hearing Draco's voice and looked as if he was caught doing something he shouldn't be doing.
When she looked back to Ron, however, the smile disappeared, seeing Ron and Lavender. In a clinch. Kissing.
Draco moaned again as Harry sucked at the perineum just behind his balls, making circular motions with his tongue against it. His mouth staying there with the occasional move up to his balls and then back down again making all of Draco's nerve endings standing on edge.
"Ron calm down,"
"What the bloody hell happened to you?! And how do I make it, so that it happens to me too?!" Ron furiously whispered.
When it was over Draco walked down the stairs.
Draco didn't understand how somebody could smile like that when the boy didn't even have enough money for clothes.
"Really? Well... brilliant. I'll head there straight away." Harry said, a bit startled as he walked back towards Ron to tell him the news. "Good. And take Weasley with you. He looks far too happy over there." McGonagall ordered while smiling.
He was sweating, he realised. Draco equally so and it made the werewolf stand out with a silver shine on his pale skin. He could see the defined muscles clearer now. And fuck, how much he wanted to run his tongue all over them again. He kissed his boyfriend instead, jamming him into the mattress as face hit face. It was open-mouthed and messy but neither seemed to care.
"Christ, Potter! Stop playing the virgin maid and get on with it-Ah! DOon't do that wh-ile I'm talking, you dO-lt!"
. She had begged him back in the library that
Harry smiled as Ron continued to sob out words of thanks. It had actually been Hermione's idea, having planned it all out for months before coming to Harry. She'd told him it would be the perfect gift and that he deserved it. But Harry knew she most likely wanted to make it up to Ron in some way. He agreed fairly quickly and seeing Ron's reaction only made it that much better.
"Harry Potter… is death!" The monster yelled. Draco felt as if he couldn't breathe as if someone had just stabbed him. "By me, Lord Voldemort himself!"
Draco ducked his head, trying to will away his blush.
'Oh hell no.' Draco thought to himself while walking backward like the rest of the class…well everyone except Potter.
"Stubborn, aren't we?"
Harry walked slowly towards the man, looking around to see if the crazy girl had followed him.
It didn't take long for Ron to start grinding against her. Groaning as he moved his lips to cares her clavicle, giving her praises in short gasps. She clung on to those, not having any clue what she was doing nor if she was doing it right but stuck to the soft gasps and stuttering hips like an instruction manual. Much to her chagrin, her inexperience was showing. And she could only hope that it wasn't that noticeable.
But for a male werewolf to feel like this, wasn't it…weird? He didn't know if this was normal, he knew that the male was supposed to want to always be in control wanting to be the alpha male. He knew that in a same-sex relationship, of course, one would bottom…
Thanks for the kudos and reading this fic!
"Yes, Professor McGonagall." The boys said. "Well then, Mr. Filch," McGonagall said and the music started playing.
. It was incredible! He couldn't believe Harry would do that for him, take care of him like that, it made him that much more in love with the raven-haired boy.
Harry sighed. He fucked up.
"You do have a point, mind you, I've never seen Severus more frustrated with anyone in my entire life. And you should've seen him with my aunt Bellatrix," Draco said, one eyebrow raised as he said so.
"Oh really? So that's what you think?"
"Oh! I've read about this before." Hermione said, excitement replacing the anger. "Although, I don't know where exactly."
Draco was crying, his fear too much to handle especially after the last voice.
"He's my rat, sir. He's not really a rat. He was a rat. He was my brother Percy's rat. But then they gave him an owl-
"It's only Malfoy. What'd you expect?" Ron said trying not to sound angry himself.
"You should have known what they were, especially the foxglove! We've undergone multiple lectures about that plant and its effects and how hard it is to transform its poison to a drinkable protection ward against fairies. You even made a joke about how you could use it as a fly swatter instead!"
"Better to have one full day well fed, then two in hunger." He said joyously and emptied the bag of blood inside the goblet.
"Have you come to study? Or-"
Hermione made her way down the stairs, awoken by the delicious smell of breakfast. as. She was now standing at the foot of the stairs, rubbing her eyes as she stood in her wool bottom pajamas and a maroon colored, long-sleeved shirt.
As always thanks for the kudos! And thank you AnAnxiousKitten, BittyLizzy and Gisel!
Harry looked at the scrabbles and then at the other students whose beans where flying all directions, Ron's bean even bounced off Katie's head, even Malfoy was having problems. So he supposed crushing was a good tactic.
"Finally!" Harry huffed out.
Hermione's head showed again, with an annoyed expression.
It was obvious though; Malfoy was afraid of him. And how could Harry blame him!
'Shit's about to go down.' Harry thought as he eyed his friends warily. It was never good when Ron decided to yell back at Hermione, but it couldn't be helped now. Harry fully understood Rons' upcoming outburst, but at the same time didn't want his friends to fight.
"No. It's worse. Much worse. They're going to suck out his soul." Hermione explained on which Dumbledore opened the doors of the hospital wing.
changed too?' He thought, now feeling a bit curious. He looked back down and pulled at his pants and boxers so that he could look into them.
Draco bit his lip, thinking about it. This was after all his first time, it wasn't like he could take it back afterwards or pretend it hadn't happened. He was prepared, had researched into it and was pretty sure how the whole shtick would go. But shouldn't that same thought be put on the action itself? He had been waiting for this for a long time, planning when and where would perhaps make it more special - wholesome.
"Oh, we do not speak his name, the weapon chooses the creature Mr. Potter it's not always clear why… but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you, after all, He who must not be named did great things… terrible, yes, but great." The man said, his tone serious.
There already were some heat rooms for the creatures that were held back a year, but after the one year break, there had been needed to be installed a lot more, so most of them were still fresh and new. Which was good, because it didn't matter for a werewolf's nose how hard you'd cleaned, how long it had been, the traces of the last resident were still there.
"Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?" Harry asked Hermione thinking she literally knew everything.
He hadn't expected it when Draco pushed him down, thoughts creeping back up from his former rumination. Which he should probably aim a bit more serious attention towards and actually have a conversation with Draco about –not these
"Yeah, yeah, I'm fine," Harry answered.
" Ron continued to ramble, trying to do whatever was possible to...
Harry's heart skipped a beat as he looked at Malfoy.
"What an interesting necklace," Hermione said trying to break the silence.
"And guess where it was found." Ron slurred, making Harry shrug. Ron smiled before he said: "In Freds' dirty underwear!" Making them both laugh hysterically before they took another sip.
"Yes, but I'm not his roommate! And you had dinner every night with him!" Hermione said.
She smiled at him.
"Because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did."
"No, I'm not!" Draco tried to defend himself but could feel the warmth that was coloring his cheeks. He clenched the bag that was in his hand as he cursed Hermione before she started jumping up and down.
Draco regarded his own stamp on the vampire, seeing the nasty traces of his claws stretching all the way from his lover's back to his collarbone. "Oops, indeed,"
"Well, indeed Ron. I can't think of a single thing of why you would be cross with me as well." Hermione said, but much like Ron her tone of voice betrayed the meaning of her words.
Draco ignored him. Shaking his head as he put on a scowl. He couldn't believe this. Did Harry honestly think he was just going to stop on his call? That he was going to turn around and forgive him the moment he looked into those green eyes? Fuck no.
Draco let a few moments pass by as he felt his cock deflate, looking dazedly around while his orgasm subdued. He felt like laughing, a disbelieving laugh of madness. This had not been what he'd anticipated at all. It seemed Harry was good at surprises, especially when they involved making Draco's brain short-cut and just…blow his
Harry slowly walked towards her, as he noticed Rons' snoring, and immediately noticed what she was doing.
"My mother's eyes, yeah." Harry interrupted him, he'd get those comparisons a lot and was kinda tired of it.
Harry looked up at his boyfriend. The werewolf's grey eyes staring right back at him with curiosity and agitation. Which wasn't anything new, as both of them had studied hard these last few days. Researching their potion and figuring out how it could strike its maximum power. But who cared. Life was meaningless anyway.
And even though he wanted to stay, to make sure that Malfoy was going to live. He knew that it was only the respectable thing to do, so he left.
"I-I did. I mean, I thought since we're friends that I should call you by your first name. Shouldn't I?" Potter asked hesitantly.
He shook away those thoughts, a small blush heating up his face and ears as he tried to compose himself.
"And you, don't you dare to provoke him or I'll make you regret it," Hermione said as she pointed an accusing finger towards him.
Ron gripped his broomstick with clammy hands and glanced up the stances with nervous eyes.
because
Draco felt awful, why did he always manage to ruin things for everybody!
"It's the same year after year. Always packed with muggles, of course." The woman said.
'Jesus Ron, just get in here!' Harry thought to himself as he dragged Ron inside, who was whining about not wanting potions.
"You look handsome today," Harry continued, caressing Draco's cheek in a fether like movement as he tucked one of Draco's loose hairs behind his ears. Draco gave a sheepish look as he did so. Blinking a few times when Harry removed his hand he looked down to the ground, hearing his blood pulse on the inside of his ear he moved his hand towards it. Realising with a jolt that when he jumped up he must have messed up his hair. The hair he had been spending so much time to acquire!
"Can't tell you Harry, Hogwarts business, very secret," Hagrid said.
"Of course! They are the most tasteful chips I've ever eaten, they have an amazing texture and their crispiness is just right it is incredible! My father used to ban them in the house like many other products that were made using Muggle methods, but one time my mother had accidentally bought them -not having noticed the brand- and gave some to me and my father. I absolutely loved it and my father did so too, so he asked my mother from what company it was and when he found out, he was furious. He tried to take it away from me, so I, of course, told him that if he was going to take away my chipchip I was going to make him regret it. Three days later I was sitting on the sofa with the chips on my lap, my father begrudgingly taking some too." Draco smirked at Harry, happiness filled his body as he saw the look of surprise and smile on Harry's face.
He considered the arm and smiled before taking it.
They were laying on their recently purchased high-quality kings bed, not too soft nor too firm and completely custom made. Because Draco refused to sleep another night on the stiffening, worn-down mattress of death that Harry thought was
"Awooh!" Harry howled or at least tried to. And it freaking worked! But now Harry had another problem.
The only times you dared to drink more than that was when you knew it'd be empty soon. When you'd start to panic that you needed to wait for another supply for God knows how long! I am sure that if you tried-"
"That's another reason why we shouldn't do this!" They both yelled at her again.
Harry was momentarily struck by the bitterness in Draco's tone…So he hadn't imagined it after all.
but when the sneaky little wolf kept arguing that he was telling the truth, that the potion master had even made it to the headline of the Daily prophet once, all the while looking at him with such an earnest expression…Draco had actually managed to convince him. It had made for a few ridiculous questions, Harry could still picture himself blushing and throwing up in disgust as he imagined his former potion master in a tutu.
Because now everything was solved, Draco's mind was back to its normal peaceful self, but that also meant it went back to its normal train of thought which let him to Potter, of course. And when Draco thought about Potter he thought about a lot of things, like how much he wanted his love to be mutual and how that was never going to happen, or about how amazing it would feel to be curled up in those strong arms, or to be kissed by those gorgeous plump lips, or how mindblowing it would be if he could feel those
Oh, and I forgot to mention that Lockhart is still a wizard.
Yep, he was definitely going to blow this. Why did Cormac need to go for keeper as well?! Not only looked the guy hundredth times better than he did, he also needed to play the only position that Ron was not hopelessly at?! And he even had the nerve to ask Ron if he could introduce him to Hermione?!
in a relationship and that he couldn't tell Ron that: no, he couldn't date someone because technically he wasn't single anymore. Which Ron or Hermione for that matter, didn't know that.
"Because, Harry, if I go with you and night falls I'll probably just bite your head off," Hermione explained taking the part with the hourglass in it and started to spin it.
"Yes, I am," Harry confirmed, waiting for her reaction. But she didn't react, she just went on with talking.
Draco heard his mother sniff. "Thank you, Holly, I'm coming."
"I haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet Harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. People die in this tournament."
"Fuck it."
For a moment Harry kept on being oblivious to what Ron meant. Before reality crashed into Harry's head.
"Sure," Harry said a bit unsure. People started making room for both of them, even the magical creatures stopped what they were doing because they were also curious.
"…I'm not angry about that just, you know? Disappointed," Ron shrugged. "I thought you trusted me, the way I trusted you,"
"Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud." Slughorn said, still shocked by his own clumsiness of putting his new, expensive mead on the same plank as his poison.
"Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours!" He yelled. And thrusted the book into his fathers' hand.
"Erhm… muggle food?" Harry answered a bit questionable.
"Well, it matters a great deal my dear, especially since you seem to be in love with this person." Narcissa said, matter of factly.
Harry smiled up at them, remembering the night when he found Draco stealing one of them only to explain the solar system to them. He found affection filling him up as he thought back to it. How beautiful Draco looked in the moonlight, as well as the eager look on his face he had when pointing up at the sky.
He was facing Wormtail first, plunging his hand into his chest, gripping his heart and squeezing it to a pulp. Then he pulled his hand out along with the heart and saw Wormtail falling to the ground.
"What?" Draco asked in a somewhat whiny voice, even though he would never admit it. He was enjoying his time with Harry, very much so. He didn't want him to leave.
He looked at the now filled goblet, questioning himself before he threw away the blood bag. He then turned around to see if anyone else was having a dislike for his food. It wasn't like Harry was worried that Draco found his eating habits horrifying. He knew after months of reassurance that the other didn't mind that one bit. However, that didn't mean Draco found the blood in itself tasteful.
Draco bit his lip. He-he liked Draco's blood, he found it incredible. He thought Draco smelt nice. It made Draco so happy he didn't know what to do. He knew Potter probably thought Draco would be disgusted or angry, but the truth was that he couldn't be more relieved and aroused.
"NO, no, no! I don't mean… that's not what happened! She just didn't want to open the curtains, and when she did she tried to explain herself but then… a wave hit her." Ron said, the last sentences sounding a bit dreamy.
"I-I, I can't believe I- I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to- my instincts were taking over- I'm so sorry, I never wanted-never wanted to force you to-" Harry mumbled out, his breathing getting heavier as he didn't know what to do.
"That doesn't change the fact I mistranslated ehwaz and eihwaz, and I won't let it happen again," Hermione said determent, finally sitting down in front of them.
No. If she wouldn't give him some room to think, or at least a chance to breathe in some fresh air, it would be unfair to him. If she told him the moment the train left the station they could've been in for a long, uncomfortable ride, and if she told him last moment he would freak out since they wouldn't be able to talk things through before being dumped into one big room. Maybe the train ride wouldn't be long enough for him to find an answer and he would panic over that. All-in-all, it didn't seem the best option.
And God, it felt good too. The suction around his cock being one of the most pleasurable things he had ever experienced. That and Draco's moans, making him feel more confident as he drove home with enough force to make his boyfriend gasp out a lungful.
"Harry Potter. We meet again." The voice said.
He walked back to his mattress and took a bite out of the energy bar while scowling. He looked around his room again, slowly growing more bored as time past by and his bar was finished. He looked where he had dumped his clothes and robe the previous day and frowned as he saw Hermione's paper bag in the mess.
"Bloody hell Harry! Stop defending that stupid ferret, it's not like your his friend beside you only do it because you feel so guilty for sinking your teeth into him!" Ron spat, now shifting his face to glare at Harry.
"Hello Harry, and how was your talk?" Hermoine asked. Harry walked towards them and heaved out a sigh. He needed to tell them, he hadn't been sure if they would understand but he knew that he wouldn't be able to do this without them.
Ron huffed, scratching the side of his head as frustration began forming in his face. He touched his chin as if in thought but he didn't seem to get anywhere and dropped it after a second, sighing loudly.
"Thank you," Harry said, falling with his back on the bed.
She halted a moment, "You sure, you're alright? You seem a little irked,"
"Did not," He protested as he started fumbling with the green carpet his mother had send him. After he moved back into the room the first thing he did was open up the tiny window and let fresh air drive away the horrible stench of musk in the air. After that, he'd moved some things around and had asked his mother for some stuff to make it a little more homy. When he'd been placing things everywhere he found out he even had a fireplace, hence he where he was sitting now.
"Cancelled! They can't cancel Quidditch! Oliver yelled, starting to protest.
One moment they were asking innocent questions and were having fun answering them and the next Draco's mind was filled with kissing the other boy senseless. Which was definitely not good for his self-control, might he add!
"This has been going on for a while now, Harry," Ron said, sounding serious and staring fiercely at him.
Harry was following professor McGonagall. 'Oh no, I'm in so much trouble! Stupid Malfoy with his stupid face, and his stupid games and his adorable smirk… SHIT, I'm doing it again!' Harry thought.
Ron turned his gaze to look her in the eye, shrugging.
'Why me.' Draco thought miserably, wanting to run as fast as he could out of there.
Ron looked at his toes, breathing out a sigh.
"Who's there? Oh..." Moaning Myrtle said in a flirty tone.
Harry fiddled with his fingers as he looked at his headmaster. He slowly breathed in and out. He was hesitant, he didn't like to admit it. It felt like he wasn't in control of himself and that Harry hated. Because if he wasn't in control of himself, what would stop him from hurting somebody else?
charm to it but he could handle it.
"I'm… having these…
"Mr. Potter, you say. Are you perhaps the same Mr. Potter that freed Dobby from master Lucius?" Holly asked, her tone calm but still cold.
When in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. Good luck." Dumbledore said, confusing Harry and Ron… again.
He could already feel that refreshing chill off those cool lips as the room in between started closing in. Making him shut his eyes.
"I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight," Harry said.
This time, however, Hermione had trusted him into handling it responsibly and not act like a guy that had been stranded on a forsaken island for four years with no decent food or water. He'd said she was being dramatic.
"Anything! Hurry up!"
- if he really wanted this. As if it wasn't obvious! Even when he wasn't really in the mood for it, he couldn't deny that every time Harry sat in between his legs he longed for his lover to kiss him down there. To caress him in that lovely way that made his breath hitch.
Draco looked around the alley, it was quite narrow -definitely smaller than five foot- and discrete. The darkness making it so you weren't very able to look in between the two buildings. When taking one step to many, Draco stumbled against Harry who suddenly stopped and turned around. They were now eye to eye and Draco felt himself getting reluctant. But he couldn't back down now. He'd dared Harry to do it, no backing out on his part now.
All right then... I'm going to check on the Polyjuice Potion." Hermione stood up and gave the two goats to the boys. "Remember. Just make sure Crabbe and Goyle find these." Hermione said and exited.
"Reading? I didn't know you could read." Draco said wondering wtf was happening.
"Really? Honestly, I reckoned she was starting to annoy you." Harry pointed out, sitting on his bed and putting the marauder's map back.
Though, often times, it would leave Harry swallowing. Blinking dazedly as he watched Draco doing something as ordinary as reading a book. An ache of lust would form down below that grew at an exponential rate till he was unable to stop himself from marching over to the blonde and taking him then and there. Draco not minding one bit.
Even when it had been really hard the last couple of days to push his feelings aside, he had been really enjoying them and he found content as he smiled, looking over at Draco sitting next to him, their shoulders touching as they both looked into the fire. Draco's scent invading his nostrils but he was too tired to care.
"I'm sorry, are you alright?" Harry said, body freezing up.
"Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more; Believing in yourself.. Think of it this way. Every great wizard in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us?" Harry said looking at all of DA. He was proud, it was almost Christmas and they were all doing great. It was to bad that people were still scared of him but Harry just ignored that.
"Snogging? Who're you talking about?" Ron said frowning, making Harry frown as well.
"Yes, sir." Harry and Ron said in unison.
True, when he turned eighteen and hit werewolf maturity. He'd expected to have a bit more muscle, his senses a bit more heightened and his speed a bit faster. But already seeing that Potter had appeared into the Great Hall in a flash, made him nervous and self-conscious.
Harry looked up at his friend, who was inching on him in seconds.
The next couple of chapters are going to be sad/hilarious... or at least in my mind they are...
He never really cared about it before, sex that is. Thinking it would happen when it happened, but now, watching Draco take in his cock…
"Because we need to make sure it will fit with the rest of the furniture and I know you've got a good eye for those things." His mother answered proudly. Draco knew she'd just brought him with her to take him out of the house. She probably knew what was going on and Draco was grateful that she didn't say anything about it as he followed her into the shop.
unquote. Harry smiled even the thought of Draco using it, pleasuring himself with it was...absurd...
He bit his bottom lip as small moans bore down his throat. As he had fallen asleep his fangs and claws had withdrawn themselves again, but Draco could feel them growing again, as well as a bulge forming in his lower shaft.
She shook her head, waving it off like it wasn't important.
"And by the way, your back is much more comfortable than my mattress," Ron said, making Hermione laugh in between tears. "That sounded much more offensive in my head."
"If that's what you want, fine with me," Harry said simply, walking away. Only to turn back and motion for Draco to follow him. And after a while of standing there awkwardly in the middle of the abandoned street, a finger in the air pointing at no one in particular, Draco found himself matching Harry's pace. Following the other boy into a dark alley where the only source of light was the moon and stars.
"Oh, nothing just that scarhead here was snooping on my territory last night!" Malfoy yelled.
…and he really shouldn't be this aroused by that simple fact.
"C-could you get me some water? And maybe something to eat? There is a fridge on your left." She said, hoping he wasn't going to run away.
These days they had learned how to clean up their act, acting charming and polite as they kept each other in check.
"Stupefy!" He yelled and blew himself and Harry backward, both lying on the ground.
"Excuse me?" She asked uncertainly, before Ron quickly marched over to one of the common's room couches, pulling a large red blanket that was half leaning over the backrest and with the other half still under an unbeknownst Gryffindor girl, who shrieked as the thing was pulled from under her.
"Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season. Today's game, Gryffindor against Slytherin!" A commentator said.
"That's most likely because of the sound-proof walls, otherwise I'm sure the whole castle would have heard your cries by now," Harry countered, Draco blushing magnificently in response. He ground against him, making Draco's eyes roll back inside his head.
And so on.
Draco was standing in the courtyard talking with his new teammates when the captain of Griffendor team started walking towards them with the golden trio following him. "Clear out, Flint! I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today." The captain said.
"It's moving. I think it's going to…kill." Harry said, smelling the faint blood becoming clearer now.
Harry and Ron didn't know what the fuck was happening, but when they saw Peter trying to take Lupins' knife.
"Draco-"
Walking into the classroom, Ron immediately moved towards his spot and leaned back in his chair with an annoyed expression.
It wasn't a problem. Not a problem at allllllllll.
Harry opened and closed his mouth like a fish.
"Harry, I want you to ravish me," Draco said, pointedly staring at the other boy's muscles. He could already see Harry wanting to interject that his answer could be perceived in many different ways and so put his finger on the vampire's lips, stared him straight in his eyes before saying in his most lustful tone, "
Harry lifted his eyebrows, moving his head to the side as he asked her if she was sure.
"Intriguing, isn't it? Would anyone like to venture a guess...as to what is inside?" Lupin asked.
Urgh, no, no he needed to keep in control; for Harry's sake.
Swallowing, Harry blinked away the blackness that was going to overrun his eyes. Draco's words making the grip on his inner beast falter for a moment as he rammed the said werewolf into the mattress. "You sure?"
Everyone looked stunned and the twin brothers Weasley instantly flew for Draco's throat, but their captain stopped him.
She let out a breath, her wolf whining at the biting but fair remark. "I was going to tell you-" Ron huffed, shaking his head as he turned around, "I honestly was! Listen, this is not how I wanted it to go, I didn't mean for you to find out this way."
"Okay. Now could you pick some bitterroot,
"Well, I said it first!"
"I am going to kill you one of these days." Draco's tone was very matter of fact, body twisting and ready to retire to his study so Harry could deal with his erection alone. But Harry gripped his sides with a startled laugh.
Nodding to it he had said,
Now he fears it.
He just felt so left alone. Potter hadn't spoken to him for days, and he still didn't know why! It wasn't like he wasn't trying now. So why not sooner? Or when Draco could actually talk back?!
Which caused Harry to freeze. It was just like a bucket of cold water was dumped on top of him and breaking whatever trance he'd been in. As he felt Draco shiver against him, he fell into a full-on panic mode.
He'd hoped they could help him calm down somewhat, but apparently, it didn't work that way. Bloody hell, he felt even more nervous than ten minutes before, though that could also be because he was losing time. Slowly but surely.
Harry picked up his bag, feeling nerves itch at his skin as one question remained.
"Heh? I'm sorry what did you say?" Harry asked, his ears tinging pink as he noticed his awkward behavior. He quickly stood up and started walking beside Draco as they exited the Great Hall.
Harry didn't care, he was too far gone. Some other death eaters tried to outnumber him but he was to fast. He didn't kill any of them, he did hit them until they were unconscious.
"What are you looking at?" Draco asked, his voice sounding irritated as he turned back to look at the bottle. Harry then noticed he'd been staring for a little while now and almost thought he had annoyed Draco by it before he noticed the tiny bit of pink spreading on top of the werewolves ears, he swallowed up a lump in his throat.
Harry was lost as to what he should do. Neither of his friends making any effort into saying something themselves, resulting in an uncomfortable silence like this one. He didn't dare to look at Draco, not sure what he would find.
But it wasn't the main reason for his sudden willingness to do his workout now. He'd already done his necessary doses of work that week. And yes, he could use the exercise to strengthen his body for the upcoming Quidditch game. Not to forget the work-outs actually helped his mind clear up. He just…wanted to look good for his date with Draco.
"Professor Snape." Draco heard Longbottom whisper.
But as he watched that adorable expression on the Slytherin's face…yeah, he needed to work on his willpower. Because
It had been going on like that for a while now. After Draco came back from his heat and went back to his normal routine, Harry just simply didn't know how to act around him. And he'd asked himself more then ones if he was being too obvious. But it didn't seem like Draco had figured it out which made Harry feel relieved.
Harry let out an indignant squeak. His head shooting up from the table while his mouth was forming an incredulous pout.
"Yes, he is! And I'm not feeling guilty about anything!" Harry said out loud, having managed not to shout but not to keep the anger in his tone at bay.
Harry didn't respond and when Draco looked, he saw the other boy with his eyes closed, heavily concentrated on the task at hand. It was pretty cute if you didn't look at the act itself. But he couldn't separate the two for long as Harry picked up the pace, taking in all of Draco in one swallow and making the werewolf see stars. They had only just begun and Draco already felt himself close to finishing.
No! She wasn't backing out of it! Of course not!
During classes wasn't really an option either, not being in that much classes together and the classes that they
"Ron's right Harry, you're gonna need your strength today.
"Where were you Draco?" Goyle asked.
"Well you've guys have had your fun, and it wasn't even funny! I mean, how could Hermione avoiding me be any sort of funny? So you can tell Hermione that she can stop doing it!" Ron said, sounding a bit hurt and desperate.
Okay, maybe a little bit. But he would be too busy focussing on the game and giving it his all to try and defeat Harry, wanting to know what his reaction would be once they'd won.
Ron sharply turned his face to look at Harry, seeing his raven-haired friend not coping well with the situation as well. He could see his panic reflected in the boy's eyes as they darted around the whole hall.
"Relax, I've asked her permission and she said it was fine," Ron said smiling again. "Besides, you should have seen those awful looking energy bars. I haven't even eaten them and I just know that I would never want it. She's already in such an unfortunate condition, so I will do whatever it takes to make it less horrible. I mean she's all alone, and after her…" He cleared his throat. "heat wave finished, she wasn't really bothered with me being there. I will only keep her company for a minute and then I'll leave, I promise."
Harry didn't really think about that everybody knew his name, but now he did… this certainly made him understand.
"Mother?" Draco asked carefully, not wanting to disturb her.
"Narcissa! Good to see you, and I see you brought your pup in here too." A hairy looking man said as he moved towards them from behind the counter.
"Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon," Hermione said making all three laugh.
This was his chance! He needed to take it, he wanted to take it, but it was like his whole mouth had transformed into the Sahara desert.
. And that should be impossible seeing she was a werewolf.
"Alright, Time-out! Time-out!" Harry hissed while blushing furiously, successfully grabbing his friends' attention.
"You've got to be pulling my leg." Ron whispered staring at her with the same shock he had that very first time she had flicked the wand. "Is this," He pointed between them, "the reason you can do
Draco looked a little confused as he swallowed his last bite of pudding. They were sitting in front of each other on one of the tables in the Great Hall, there weren't many people there. Some first-year Hufflepuffs, a couple of Slytherin's, three Ravenclaws and a group of Gryffindor's. Harry didn't know them that well though, so he preferred to sit with Draco. Though, he couldn't really think of someone else he would rather sit with.
"Why are you..?!" Harry said also moving up in an effort to grab Draco's arm, stopping him. He turned the blonde around, immediately meeting his glare. "Why are you so mad? Don't you want me to control myself around you, to keep my vampire away from devouring you whole?"
He was happy when Harry did so, although hesitantly.
"I'm…sorry…Draco," She huffed, gripping her one knee so hard it was like she was in agony.
"I'm not hungry." Harry said.
He quickly stood up and dressed himself, smiling at Neville after he finished. Neville just rolled his eyes in exasperation before moving out of the room.
He just couldn't help but let his mind worry about his boyfriend's carelessness. They could be caught any moment! What if a teacher walked in? They would obviously be punished for getting it on in such a public space –Harry heard another screeching sound as the table moved further back- Never mind the mess they were making! He wasn't exactly looking forward to dusting off the entire Hogwarts trophy room, or cleaning up the owlery, but who knew, maybe they would even get
Or at least, that was before his alarm clock decided to ruin it.
He didn't wait for her answer, strolling towards the mini-fridge as if he owned the place. "There still something edible in here?" He asked with a hint of hope, twisting his neck to get a better view of his...friend.
It was probably 'cause Draco got bored with the conversation and didn't know how to stray from it otherwise, yeah that's it!
I'm late.
She wasn't going to listen to that part of her brain anymore, nor be controlled by it. She was going to tell him, when was still the question, but she was determined now. She would tell him when the time was right.
As Draco tried to focus on his werewolf hearing he heard people outside, down on the ground yelling; "HAPPY NEWYEAR," making him finally realize they weren't in any danger but instead were supposed to graduate each other on the new year…
"Why?"
"…yeah, so that happened," Ron huffed out, sounding a bit disappointed.
"Draco."
The study on mates I
"Hmm, that's not good," Dumbledore said, making Harry swallow in worry. "Yes, there could be a chance that you're less content with simple bags of blood after having your taste directly from the source, but you're not supposed to find them as you said 'horrible'. Tell me, Harry, have you found any of this in your book?"
Draco looked up from the pillow to stare at his watch, seeing that it was already past twelve p.m. Draco decided to stand up from his sitting position to walk towards his closet. He opened the doors to find his clothes neatly organized as they hung on the hangers, like always. He touched some of his different pajama's as he seemed to contemplate which one he was going to sleep in tonight. There was still the familiar chill from the cold weather inside the room, especially after he'd decided to spend the night at the fireplace at the Great Hall, not having been able to light his own so it could warm up the room.
"Come on we're going."
"But still-
"Bloody hell, how can anybody walk around here when Seamus's trunk seems to pop up everywhere?!"
Then they heard hoofbeats, a centaur, it was scaring away the figure.
before
"So you do think it's a good plan," Ron stated, albeit a bit flustered.
"Because…"Draco rummaged through one of the drawers, standing up straight when he appeared to have found the thing he was looking for. He turned towards Harry, presenting him with a green tie. "we need something to fasten you down on."
"What?" Hermione asked more calmly, a little thrown off as she frowned. "No, of course not. We're here to study. That's what we're here for. To study... as a study group."
"I now understand how Harry feels all the time," Neville breathed to himself, watching as the two Gryffindor's were still going back and forth for- Oh! Two hours and sixty-five seconds,
"Can I get you something?" He asked, turning around after he walked into the kitchen. Harry was momentarily at a loss for words, he couldn't help himself! No one could,
"Weasley," Draco gasped, breaking his gaze.
" The voice said again.
"Ah shut up, you hollow-horned mammal," Ron sighed, a grin forming on his face when Elliot jumped away from her.
"Yeah," Harry answered quickly, his gaze snapping towards Draco's. He only noticed then that Draco had moved from the protective bundle of Harry's arm, having moved it away to sit back more comfortably, and was no much closer to his face. Not that he registered this. He looked into the blond's eyes, searching for any hint of dissatisfaction of their earlier activities. Had he done something wrong? Had he overlooked something? Should he have stuck on their normal routine instead of changing course? He could swear the book Sirius had sent him said that it was nice to take a change of pace for the receiver, had he read it wrong?
"Of course we knew. How could you not be?!" Aunt Petunia said.
Then he heard it, more growling but unlike Lupin who was now completely silent, this sounded more fierce, louder and above all… it sounded more like a wolf. And that's' when Harry saw it, it was walking towards Lupin. A gigantic white wolf with yellow eyes.
"Wait a minute, this is the shirt you wore in your heat. The heat-shirt!"
'Urgh,' Draco thought, getting frustrated with himself. He looked back at Harry, making sure the vampire was asleep. He turned around so he could sit a bit more comfortable putting his elbow on the couch, his hand supporting his head as he stared down at Harry with a lustful gaze, unconsciously making small notes on the other's sleeping habits. Draco found that it was awfully satisfying to see his lover sleep, watching him in a completely relaxed state as those eyebrows sometimes pulled into a frown of displeasure at being disturbed or when his mouth went so slack that the edge of his fangs were revealed –in the process making his pillow a drool feast- but Draco didn't care, smiling at himself in fondness as he wiped some of it up.
Yeah, that would go down
"Really, you don't have to worry about either of us, you're forgetting that Hermione will never give me a moment of peace as long as the finals are there. I still remember her reprimanding me for not coming with her to the library to study for the O.S.L.s,
"That's right," Harry said, a bitter taste in his mouth, "That's how you're supposed to feel."
"Ron stop being such a drama queen, Hermione has already healed the wound with your wand," Harry said fondly.
'Don't look at his neck, don't think about his neck, don't imagine sinking your teeth in that beautiful, long…tasty, pale
"So that's it for this lesson. Now, we' re not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. And well done, everyone. Great, great work." Harry said happily.
"Besides, it wasn't like Harry was in love with her," Hermione said, Harry and Ron couldn't help but groan at that.
No rattling closet.
about them as well, something that made him breathe easier for sure.
"Ron seems to be enjoying himself," Hermione said grimly, she was happy that her house won, and that Ron was having fun but she still had that nagging feeling in the back of her mind.
Harry turned his head towards Draco, making an apologetic face while Draco tried to look everywhere but at the two people in front of them. Embarrassment scented heavy in the air.
"Amazing," Draco answered and smiled.
Draco frowned a bit, as he tried to not show the disappointment on his face. He shook it away as he started getting the cauldron and fire.
As time went by, and Ron got awaker by the minute. Hermione felt her body grow hot. Her breathing got slowly more elaborate and her hands started shaking a bit.
Ron quickly opened the small opening at the bottom and let the blood flow into the goblet, careful not to spill anything. When he was done he slowly handed Harry the goblet, who was biting his lip in anticipation.
Well, let's start this with my apologies. I was too tired yesterday to finish this chapter and clean it all and stuff like that. BUT HERE IT IS!
He shouldn't! Harry wasn't here for that! He looked into the mirror and saw his eyes had gone yellow again, he panicked for a moment and took a few calming breaths as his eyes turned back to their usual color. He cleared his throat and saw Harry turn around at the gesture.
It had been tough, but he was glad he made it. After lunch, he had immediately started his search for the person behind the 'love letter', which wasn't easy with the person not revealing his or her name in the letter, or Ron's not so helpful description of them. I mean, he didn't even say if they were a boy or a girl! Just gave him something vague like "violet hair, very much hair, a ponytail, a Ravenclaw kinda personny." GREAT HELP MATE! So there he was, looking around the whole school in search of this mysterious Ravenclaw. Asking some other Ravenclaws if they knew anyone by the characterization, or just walked up to people who seemed to fit it. And then finally, FINALLY! He found her, after skipping two lessons, he fucking found her! She was a satire named Mia, one class below them, and was very…how should he say? Talkisch. No, really. It was almost impossible to get something in between, when at last she stopped her rambling and he was able to properly reject her -saying he already had someone he loved- she started all over again! And this time with fake tears staining her face! IT NEVER ENDED!
"Ron?" He turned away, hands messing up his hair as he coursed his fingers through it.
"Nothing wrong my bloody ass! Your all red, and you keep shivering! Where are your medicines? What exactly do you have? Dragon pox? Wait no, you aren't green. Scrofungulus? Or-"
"Are you freaking kidding me? I hoped we passed this bullshit already!" Ron yelled out. His arms outstretched in the air before looking at Harry, frustrated. "You're not actually considering buying that self-righteous arse a gift, are you?!"
"I'll be fine, but I do need to ask; since when have you so many admirers?" Her grandmother said with a wave of her eyebrows, making Hermione frown.
She stood back up, glaring at him and walked out of the compartment slamming the door. Draco facepalmed himself while saying; "That went just how I wanted." Sarcastically.
"Cormac! That's who you invited!" Harry asked in disbelief, she always complained about the irritating Nephilim that wouldn't leave her alone, why would she even consider asking him out?! "I thought it would annoy Ron most. But he's a menace. He's got more tentacles than a Snarfalump plant." She said, looking warily towards the see-through curtains. "Dragon tartare?" A waiter appeared behind the curtain with a tray, startling Harry, and Hermione.
Neither of them said anything. Both of them deciding to stay in an uncomfortable silence as they looked each other up and down.
When he walked inside he looked over to a small statue, touching it. His fathers' cane stopped him and said, "Don't touch anything, Draco." In a stern tone.
"No idea. I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes. Over there." She said pointing to the bank of sinks. Harry and Ron hurried towards it examining the pipes below, the tile above, and then Harry saw it, attached on one of the copper taps, was a tiny snake.
"I wasn't
"Sure," Ron dragged out the syllable, frowning too as he watched Hermione's determined face. However, the look of confusion on Ron's face quickly disappeared as if it never been there, instead deciding on moving on with his tutoring. Asking Hermione various questions with Hermione dutifully, and might he add enthusiastic answers.
They were all quiet for a moment when Hermione started to speak up; "Yes. I've seen it."
made of
"Petrificus Totalus." She said while pointing the wand at Neville. Neville immediately froze and fell to the ground not moving.
After the whole biting accident, Malfoy hadn't gone back to school, it wasn't really a problem because they already had finished the most important tests. It did make Harry feel extremely guilty. After all, Malfoy didn't come back to school because his mother was too worried that he could faint any moment, it could be an exaggeration but still.
She was meeting his hips on every thrust, her wet heat enveloping him and fuelling his want. He was lost in her from her sensual gaze to her flexing toes. He didn't register the nails driving into him. Didn't pay them any mind. They anchored him, proof that she was there and that this was real, all his.
"I never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here." The spider said.
"Fine, if you really did something she wouldn't like, I'm sure she would do something ten times worse to you," Harry said, giving his friend a little smile of confirmation. Ron smiled back.
"You are so not helping right now," Draco said, trying to suppress another fit of giggles.
Instantly Hermione put her hand up. And even if she wasn't a werewolf Harry was not shocked to see it.
"GUYS!" Hermione yelled on which we both fell silent. "What are you all rambling about."
"I've been watching them for weeks. And see, Dumbledore's Army proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. They've been creating a rebellion against us. We saw your lies for what they were: A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry." Umbridge said in her sickly sweet tone, and Harry found himself asking how anyone could possibly mistake her for nice for even a second.
"You, pfft, I mean that you could fight me alright but, a werewolf and vampire? You must be nuts!" Ron said while cracking.
Ron blinked furiously as he tried desperately to will his upcoming erection down at the thought of H-Hermione in…
Yes, that felt very satisfactory, definitely.
Draco moaned, looking up at the sky as Harry loosened his belt, his lips parted. He fought back as his eyelids threatened to drop, not wanting to miss a second of what was about to happen next.
'Here it comes.' Draco thought. "Well, he didn't actually like it when I insulted his friend, Ron Weasley, in front of him," Draco said waiting for the rage of his father.
"Me too, I want you too! Please, Harry, Harry, Harry!" Draco moaned, feeling the harsh outline of Harry's cock against his arse. Draco moved his hand underneath Harry's robes, moving up towards his back. Almost there, just needed to get rid of those fucking clothes and they could-
Draco squinted his eyes together. Feeling Harry's gaze moving towards his, waiting for the werewolf's reply. It was sweet, thoughtful. Draco couldn't deny that.
"Come on Neville, I'll give you that herb book you liked so much," Hermione wiggled her eyebrows, ignoring the look of indignation from Ron.
Even Draco felt all warm inside when he saw the wonderment Dobby showed in his eyes.
She would tell him when the time was right.
Ron cocked a brow, making Harry roll his eyes.
I hope you guys liked this chapter, I have never written any smut so I hope I didn't disappoint you.
"Yes, that's exactly what I think," Ron said proudly.
Harry sighed. Why wasn't he able to shut his stupid mouth? He knew Ron was upset, and he knew that if he defended their former bully Ron would start acting up, but he couldn't help himself! It just came out by impulse. He just couldn't handle Ron insulting his...friend.
he'd just started touching himself in front of his lover. Without even a moment of hesitation…Where had all his previous sense of shame gone to?! Draco felt his cheeks coloring again, except this time he knew for sure his whole body must have been flushed by now, down to the tip of his toes!
"WOW." He said, his voice full of wonder of what he's been missing out on. He'd never in his whole life had tasted something so rich of taste!
It was as it should be.
A sudden movement brought Draco's focus back to Harry. He watched as the vampire groaned as he turned with his back towards Draco, sighing out a contented sigh as he settled himself back into the couch.
, knew Draco's deepest secret.
No other reason. No other reason at alllll. What other reason could there be?
"As in, ancient werewolf matchmake-"
"Professor, we've got some information for you- Harry said dashing inside Lockhart's office but stopped seeing two large trunks standing open and a very empty office. Harry and Ron stopped dead.
Harry considered it, feeling up the weight in his hands. He had heard of them -mostly by some hormonal succubi in class- but he had never actually seen one. Now, looking at it, he didn't understand what the hype was all about. It was just a...plastic noodle. He eyed Draco, contemplating how such a piece rubber could bring quote
He took a deep breath, seeing Hermione roll her eyes in front of him.
He could see that the place was quite full, but was relieved that he didn't see anyone from the Hogwarts castle, which wasn't that surprising since they not only said how exceptional the restaurant was but also how expensive. Claiming they only went there for anniversaries and stuff like that, and even then it was very exclusive.
It didn't seem Potter was touched by it though, he always ignored Draco.
was what annoyed Draco the most! The way Harry was talking to him, as if he wanted nothing more than to turn around and run as fast as he could, to get away from him. He missed their lighthearted talking, it always had a way of calming Draco. It was making him even more frustrated with Harry not able to tell him what was wrong, and with himself for not understanding or able to figure out what. Was. WRONG!
Over the years Draco had built a wall around his emotions. It was still lonely, yes, but now he could cope with it.
"Harry..." Ron said trying to get his attention.
What was happening again?
"Bloody hell!" Harry yelled out in shock, almost rolling off of his bed in the process as he stared at Ron who seemed very uncomfortable. Looking around the room as if seeing it for the first time.
'Yep,
Harry put his hands over his face and rubbed them against it in frustration.
Curse him and his incapability of not getting distracted by this gorgeous woman on top of him and…was it getting hot in here?
"Nothing, I just want you to enjoy it." He broke her off, body still shaking from denying himself.
She nodded and turned her head towards him, a gleam in her eyes. "Oh, yeah. I remember reading about it somewhere.
(p.p.s I will comment on you guys tomorrow)
Draco had been running through the corridors, knowing Potter was following him, and why was that?!
That was when Draco noticed how close they were and how strong Potters' scent had become. And now he was feeling nervous for a whole other reason. Having that perfect, delicious scent so close made Draco shiver.
And kissed Draco.
Right when he wanted to open his mouth though, Harry crooked his finger in a way that had Draco let out a cry instead. The vampire looked startled, asking Draco if it hurt. Which was a stupid question indeed. He kindly said to do it again, sparks blowing up on the inside of his iris's as Harry instantly obliged.
"Scabbers?" Dumbledore asked with a frown.
s and
"Seventy-eight…Seventy-nine," Harry panted, moving his arms to go faster. He could feel the strain they put up every time he moved his body further off the ground.
"-And then he asks me what the hell I'm doing in there, and I'm like: what the hell do you think I'm doing?!"
Draco watched the boy's backside with wide eyes. He saw the muscles move as he was still breathing heavily and Draco had to admit, that it wasn't
he had been able to leave the exact moment he saw those bloody dildos in his drawer!
"I'm Moaning Myrtle. I wouldn't expect you to know me. Who would ever talk about fat, ugly, miserable, moping, Moaning Myrtle?" She said and dived into the toilet.
The werewolf didn't seem to react at first, choosing instead to deny the obvious. "...Nothing,"
"The twins knew they shouldn't anger their mum, but that hadn't stopped them before, so they set the plan in motion. All night they were busy, doing God knows what -but it stank like the Hagrid's rear after he'd eaten a little too much of his rock cakes if you know what I mean- All night they lay awake working and working, keeping their little brother awake because they didn't know how to work in quietness. The following morning both of them came downstairs for a wide and delicious breakfast together with all the Weasleys, shocked when they heard a loud scream coming from the third floor, at least everyone but the twins where shocked, trying not to laugh too hard to what was to come. As footsteps came crashing down the stairs the whole Weasley family broke into a big pile of laughter, seeing their aunt Muriel with a bright pink colored face standing on the steps of the stairs. Laughing even harder when she tried to scream at them, but instead of words coming out of her mouth, it was a loud screeching bird noise. That's when the twins started laughing, giving each other a high five, pausing when they saw the furious look on their mother's face. Angering their mother hadn't stopped them before, but that didn't mean they didn't take it high into consideration. The end,"
"Not at all," Harry said. 'Good I was starting to feel bored.' Harry thought.
"One moment the snake was calm and the other moment it was aggressive, it was like it wanted to help me!" Harry said.
"Excellent…really excellent!"
It was difficult to keep himself under control, especially when seeing the smaller man squirm underneath him. Lean arm muscles moving as they tried to grab Harry's shoulder, clutching at it when he did so. He knew he needed to let Draco get used to him, his size. But he hadn't been able to stop the thrust he had been so desperately trying to keep at bay.
"This can't be good," Harry said seeing the smile on McGonagall's face.
He fucked up.
"First, Harry, I want to thank you. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. Secondly, I sense you're troubled by something. Am I right?" Dumbledore said walking towards Harry.
He couldn't fuck this up, absolutely not!
"You s-shut up!" Draco yelled but his anger had mostly succumbed and replaced it with embarrassment."It's not as if I was the one trembling with fear!" He shot back.
are you looking for?" Ron snapped at him.
"Seems you like it then?" Hermione asked.
Yes, of course, he was disappointed that Harry- no Potter wasn't with him, kissing him, hugging him, telling him he loved him. All of that hadn't happened on the Quidditch world cup, he didn't even go to the men's room! But he dreamed about those things all the time, so he was kinda used to it.
"What about my sister?!" Ron asked with rage.
"…Do tell me, Harry, …how can someone that doesn't even understand the difference between Gilead buds and foxglove, beat me in a game of chess?" Draco asked through gritted teeth, finally showing his frustration that he'd tried to conceal for a while now. When he only got a smug smile in return he immediately glared at his lover over the game set, earning a burst of laughter out of the vampire.
Bloody hell, how he loved Draco's skin. The softness of it, the warmth it radiated. He was probably being an over the top sap at this point. Practically worshipping the little blonde hairs on the Slytherin's chest. He could just picture the way they would stand up as he drove himself…
"Make a wish Harry." Harry whispered to himself while blowing at the self-drawn Cake. 'Another birthday, with nobody that cares.' Harry thought. He was still very angry at uncle Vernon, to even go as far as to move to the middle of nowhere, just so Harry couldn't read the letter that was sent to HIM.
But he didn't know how Harry felt about it. What if he wanted to wait, telling his friends? That he wasn't comfortable enough to actually come out with their relationship. Or what if he wanted to tell her himself and didn't want Draco to interfere? Or what if he didn't want to tell her like, at all?
He took a sip of his own drink when someone called for him.
"Ah, you can keep it. I mean it's not like Harry will notice, sometimes he doesn't even notice he's wearing the same shirt for a whole week." Hermione said as she waved it off. Draco moved the bag back next to his thigh as he looked at it hesitantly.
He couldn't help but clench his jaw at the thought of not being able to spend as much time with Draco as he was able to do in these holidays. He would need to go to classes the werewolf wasn't in, no more eating at the same table, no more walking around the school for no reason, no more snowball fights, no more sitting in front of the warm fireplace in the Great Hall, no more talking in the corridors after ten p.m, and of course no more giving each other a good night's kiss. Knowing how crowded the corridors usually were they wouldn't be able to even have
Ron and Harry couldn't help but laugh at it all, luckily for them, they hadn't got first period and were standing on a bench.
"Pretty good, but it mostly depends," Harry told him, making one eye of Draco prop back open.
"Wait, you didn't know that?" Ron said sounding a bit worried, now Harry frowned too.
"I'm getting fed up with everyone, Theodore, Blaze especially Pansy!" Malfoy said, which made him open up his ears even more.
'Ah please don't tell me I'm here to ease Hagrids' nerves. Did I really just gave up my free night for this?!' Harry thought while putting on the cloak.
"Why?" Harry said, despite already moving to sit on the spot Draco pointed at, right next to the wooden pole.
'Aha' thought Harry. 'Of course, it's aunt Petunia.'
"It wasn't like I willingly told him, he pried it out of me."
But then, he supposed as he looked at Draco's stiff member -drooling a bit as he did so- maybe his enthusiasm would make up for it.
Sure, the day after that most people wouldn't exactly feel
"…You want that?" Draco asked carefully, cautiously. Suddenly pouring an ice-cold bucket of over Harry's head. Because this was really happening. He wasn't just making out, playing a fantasy nor having this awesome dream. This was reality. He was actually going to have sex with Draco.
And if that wasn't enough it seemed all teachers were in a bad mood today and seemed to be aiming at Draco in particular. Scolding him for forgetting about his books or quill, or calling him out for nothing. Though, he couldn't exactly blame all on them. He found himself making rookie mistakes, forgetting about, avoiding that or picking that. He was infuriated with himself, especially when after he found half of the class laughing at them.
'Why are all these teachers out to get me?!' Harry thought.
Draco hummed, taking another sip of his drink. Contemplating Harry's answer. He was thinking about how to approach this, it was clear Harry wasn't very outgoing with this. Draco knew this from the start, after he needed to explain again and again that no, he didn't think Harry was a monster and that he
Harry felt a little guilty about the celebration party because when he'd noticed Hermione had left the room he didn't even think about searching for her. He had just drunk a couple more drinks before he went to his room to check on Malfoy again. But at least neither of them were angry at him. When he saw her hiding behind some yellow curtains, he frowned and walked over to it. Hiding behind the curtains as well.
He wanted to see it all, wanted no one else but him to see it all.
"Draco…" Hermione warned, growling a little bit. Which resulted in Harry not being able to contain his laugh anymore as his friends stared at him with confused faces.
He closed his eyes as he started moving from base to the top. Having the intention of making this go as fast as possible. Why did werewolves even had heats?! Sure, packs needed offspring as his mother had explained, BUT STILL! Heats were something for sexual creatures, so why did he have to do it?!
He watched as his mother disappeared from the orange flames as he sat there in silence. It wasn't going to be so bad, right?
Hermione looked down at her plate, caressing the side of it. Harry could see she felt guilty but also uncertain and a bit scared.
Ron gave her an inquiring look, face softening a bit before he frowned.
"…So, what you're saying is…we could have been brothers?" Ron stood up before Hermione dragged him back down.
"Please let me finish, but when you put Harry into place when he obviously did something utterly stupid knowing I'd probably forgotten I found it only right to thank you for that." She said and waited for Draco to answer but he said nothing, not wanting to let his feeling show. "And thank you for letting me into your territory last night after mine was taken." She whispered and bowed her head.
"Go on." He said folding his arms across his chest as he looked down at her. She looked nervously at him and at the people who're sitting on the Gryffindor table, trying to nonchalantly overhear their conversation.
Harry walked to his window and opened it, needing the fresh air.
When half of the tankard was empty, Ron put it down and looked at Harry with a face that said: "Don't leave me hanging here."
Draco was already happy that it had only been a scratch but not many were as lucky as him. And even if it was more than that Draco's healing would've taken care of it.
"Hey, pea brain!" Ron said throwing a piece of wood hitting the trolls' head and distracting it for a little bit so Hermione could move.
Draco blushed. Yes, his fantasies had gone wilder as time had past but he'd never actually attempted to, to… well, finger himself. And even if he told fantasy Harry that he didn't want it. Fantasy Harry was in any way you saw him, a fantasy. Created by his own mind, so even if Draco said he didn't want it, he knew he did.
It came out of nowhere! They-they'd never done things like that before- why so suddenly? He hadn't even thought of that yet! He thought Draco was going to say something like,
before!" Harry cried out loud, again going back to the pacing in circles.
"Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right.
"Know what."
Missing.
He felt strange, seeing the familiar outfit on an unfamiliar body.
"Oh! You guys…were having a moment -sorry, feel free to proceed with whatever you were doing," She smiled and slowly backed away before Draco caught her by the arm.
"I-I, I wanted to…ehm… what I mean is…" Draco didn't really know what it was he was struggeling with, or how to even ask for help about the matter, or any matter at that.
"Okay, I can deal with that."
And he always felt disappointment gnaw at him whenever he would only hear a
"Why so tense Potter?" Malfoy said sitting in a tree. "My father and I have a bet you see. I don't think you're gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. He disagrees. He thinks you won't last FIVE."
Was he taking the blame? But without him what were they going to do?! How were they going to step up against Umbridge without him?!
"I mean what does it matter anyways." Draco said, trying his best not to spill anything.
Draco huffed in response. "You haven't eaten in over two days! How long do you think you can keep that up before you'll starve?" He grabbed the vampire's face, giving him a soft kiss while tenderly brushing away the wild raven locks. "Can you at least try it?" He begged.
"Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby...wishy-washy nonsense about not beating people who deserve it." She said and turned to Vernon while Harry was turned around smirking. Recalling him and Ron being stuck in the whomping willow.
"Because I'm right! And you're wrong!"
"Yes, it's a great plan," Lucius said to himself, and Draco knew that he was going to take no for an answer.
"No. Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention we'd be breaking about fifty school rules. And it would be dangerous. Very dangerous." Hermione said.
"Master has given Dobby a sock. Master has presented Dobby with clothes. Dobby is...
Draco knew that look, with eyes already dilating he turned his head to the side, grasping the sheets below in an effort to keep steady. Twenty years of this and he was still not used to the sensation. "Go on, you know I want it,
They looked into each other's eyes for a bit, before Hermione spoke again.
"So he says." The boy said unimpressed pointing at Harry.
"No Hermione, I will not! I told them it was taco Wednesday…but they didn't listen. THEY DIDN'T LISTEN!" Ron yelled frantically, sitting down and folding himself up as he began to wail. Hermione taking pity on him, started to rub his back.
"Yes," Harry responded eagerly. His mind racing. He'd never let him do it thrice! Maybe it had been good after all, so good he wanted more! Harry started lapping his tongue inside his mouth. To warm up of course. Trying to think of anything in that book that would surprise Draco even more!
"Oh, are you doing magic?" The girl asked in excitement. "Let's see then."
He pictured kissing that annoying little smirk off of Draco's face when he tried for the hundreds of times to get Harry's attention. How everyone would react when he'd push the boy against a table and kissing the living daylight out of him. How they would react when Harry had claimed him.
His thoughts were in haywire, spinning all around in his head. He let his hand tug at the strands of his hair before he swallowed, looking over at Draco. He was standing across the room, his back turned as he was looking out of the window. Harry wasn't able to see his face nor the emotions it would display. Truthfully, he wasn't sure if he wanted to see them.
When Draco was sitting on the couch of the Slytherin common room. He was getting praises all around him.
"It certainly looks that way," Ron responded, motioning -with the slight bodily movement he could muster- at their current position. Smirking when he saw a small vane popping on the side of Hermione's forehead.
Madam Hooch couldn't even finish her sentence before Draco run up the wall climbing as fast as lightning to the top and jumping off, just like Harry. He looked at Harry with a smug grin, his eyes yellow.
"No -I mean, yes -I mean -dammit Ron, just...give me a second." Okay with that said, let it settle in Hermione. Ron kissed you, knowing how you feel, knowing you are mates. Oh boy. Is he joking? No, his left foot is stomping the ground. That suggests he's nervous, he was taking a leap. That's good, right? Definitely, probably. His heart is thumping like mad, that's a further indication. Why can I feel his heart?
"Sorry about him, he doesn't understand what it's like lying there, day after day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you," Harry said feeling sympathy for the snake.
Ron opened his mouth, ready to reply, but stopped himself as he looked at Hermione. She could see the inner dilemma that was forming in his head. He stepped closer to her, hanging his head to meet her eyes as he whispered; "What did you want to talk about?"
Draco huffed, settling Harry with a calculated gaze. The vampire was still smiling, obviously amused by how Draco was reacting. And Draco had to admit he wasn't really angry, he only liked the way they would go on back and forth. The bickering. It was something they always did, neither of them wanting to succumb to the other and instead settling for an argue-match.
Draco was laying on his thigh, knot finally deflating after another jerk off session. His eyes half-lidded as he felt contentment bubbling up inside him. Harry's shirt confining his spent cock, never leaving Draco's side.
And then Lupin howled, almost exactly like Malfoy but still somehow… different. It started to walk towards us fangs on display.
Harry had been smiling the whole time as he opened the rest of his presents; another pair of socks from Dobby, a self-made dream catcher from Hagrid, a bottle of firewhiskey with a note "Have fun!" written on it from Sirius and another note with "But not too much fun" from Lupin.
"Eh, ehm… yeah! Yeah, she's totally fine! No worries!" Ron said, but Harry'd noticed the somewhat strained tone.
"You there! D-5!" Ron said and a black pawn moved forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raised its swords and smashed the black one.
"Help!" Harry heard Ron yelling.
Bloody hell, how it had hurt. He could still recall the way his muscles contracted, cramped whatever you wanted to call it. The way his limbs felt as if they were getting snapped into a million chunks, piece by piece. How it felt like his entire body was on fire like it was getting too small, making it hard to breathe, to move. It was absolute agony.
But Draco continued to walk forward as if he hadn't heard a single thing. Call him childish all you want.
Harry eyed Ron oddly as he walked back to the window, then he glanced at the candy box at his feet. There was an envelope. Taking it, he slid out the card which said; '
"Oh…" Draco said, his voice wavering a bit as Harry kept on wishing that this wasn't real.
"So You've returned!" He said looking over at Dumbledore.
"What can I do to make it better?!" Harry yelled, exasperated. No matter how much he yelled at the werewolf it just seemed to disregard everything he said. He knew he messed up greatly, that what he did wasn't fair to Draco even when he claimed it was. But couldn't his boyfriend stop for a minute and listen to what he had to say?!
Harry watched with a fond smile as he saw Draco ravening his dinner, it was nice to know that Draco wouldn't try and act all fancy with him, trusting Harry to see this side of him.
He was still processing what Draco had admitted, all the while Ron was busy calling Draco
This was not happening. This was not happening. This was not happening.
Harry frowned at that. He looked over at Draco who seemed to be in a mood much like his own. Happy, content, satisfied. He watched as his boyfriend's focus seemed to slip, smiling as he saw the heavy lits almost close up entirely. The determination to stay awake barely winning.
"Why the hell not! You know what kind of shit he pulled us through! You even went as far as to stalk his ass for a whole year, because you didn't trust him!" Ron shouted, frustration showing in his eyes as he made all kinds of movements with his hands.
Harry looked in the mirror. He saw himself. His mirror self-bringing his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone. The mirror self-winked and put the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reached into his pocket. There was a lump, making Harry gasp.
And kissed Draco.
"It's a secret!" They both yelled in unison as they turned their faces to Neville, who almost fell from his seat.
Draco himself was on the verge of fainting. Surely the universe couldn't be that cruel?! This was all a sick joke, wasn't it? A dream? Draco couldn't help but think that as he looked at Potter.
"Fine," Draco relented, muttering out his apologies to which Ron was forced to apologise as well. Both not looking at the other as they did so to which Harry sighed. He supposed he shouldn't expect any more than this.
"Filch is gone," Hermione said.
He was getting curious now, so he stood up and started walking around the library. He stopped at an almost hidden spot, seeing Granger with stacks of books and a desperate face.
"Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. It's a rough game, Quidditch." George said.
. He immediately swallowed all the contents of the cup until there was nothing left.
Fortunately, Pansy was to 'preoccupied' with Draco to do any harm. But when Draco was away she would be just as bad. And their
"It's an amazing piece of art, I tell you, my boy. It's made by the best carver in the world and I just need to have it!" His mother told him enthusiastic while holding his arm as they moved their way past Ollivanders and into a dark street. Draco felt guilty, here she was trying to lighten up the mood while he was just being a gloomy peace of shit.
Harry groaned as he felt himself waking up, he slowly opened his eyes before quickly shutting them again. The sunlight almost blinding him, he sat up to clumsily try and close the curtains of his bed with his eyes still pinched tight.
Harry's entire thought process froze as he looked down.
"For the record, it's pretty hard to keep them under control ALL THE TIME. Okay. And who are you to start lecturing me about that I never listen to you?! You are the one who's been avoiding Ron for a whole week now, without him knowing what he did wrong! So you tell me, right now, what's up with you." Harry commanded getting a bit pissed with his friend.
He smiled at Potter, but he still didn't meet his eyes. Draco blinked a few times, as his smile disappeared and he started giving instructions to Potter.
"Why am I doing this again?" Madam Hooch whispered to herself. "For all the other students who are as stupid as Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy, don't jump off the wall!" Hooch said.
But Ron didn't let him go any further and said. "You're right Harry," Ron started sounding a bit more optimistic, "I should just get over her. I should… distract myself. It's probably not that bad, how much I'm in love with her I mean. I should forget about her soon enough." Ron said standing back up while smiling. "Thank you, Harry, wouldn't have come up with it without you." He said and walked out of the room with a happy face.
Ron let out a scream.
They approached a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. With one that has listed Harry's father as a seeker.
"Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately tricky to make especially since it's one that needs magic. Disastrous should you get it wrong. But brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers. One sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off." Slughorn explained.
He must have looked utterly foolish doing
. They had been living together for sixteen years by now, a beautiful gold ring hanging around his finger for over fifteen. He could still imagine the day, the brisk breeze, the aisle lined with heliotropes, the loud music that could only be out-voiced by the easy chatter of their friends.
than fair we all thought-" Harry said before Hooch interrupted him by pushing some runner shoes in his hands. Harry looked at them while frowning.
Another silence fell between them. Harry let his face fall into a pout, not feeling very motivated by Hermione's answer.
"So you won't stop us?" Harry asked for certain.
"Ugh, thank you, Draco for your comforting words." Hermione huffed sarcastically as she stopped pacing and said down beside him, staring at the sun that was slowly disappearing from the sky.
"Good day Harry." Harry jumped at hearing the familiar voice with the unfamiliar name. He turned around to see Draco standing behind him with a small smile on his face.
"Fuck you, Weasley!"
"Neville. You're doing it again." Harry said looking at Neville with amusement.
But still making it a promise that breaks his heart.
"So now you want to talk to me?" He spat. Making Hermione whimper slightly, she was lucky he hadn't had any supernatural hearing.
Harry slowly turned his sight away from the giggling girls and onto his friend.
"Hello Harry, and what have you been up to?" Ron asked his voice sounding tense, not really noticeable. Harry frowned a little.
Grabbing his toothbrush, Harry put some toothpaste on it before cleaning his teeth. After that, he took a quick toilet break before walking back into the room and walk up to his mirror. Scowling at his image in front of the mirror.
incapable of even understanding that two plus two equals four, so I guess it wasn't my fault." Draco said, grinning from ear to ear before standing up.
"Ronnieboy! There you are," A horned figure jumped on Ron from behind, almost resulting in the wizard falling forward by the force. "'Been looking all over for you! Listen; I got five bottles of lobe-Blasters, seven bottles of firewhiskey, two kegs of butterbeer and some special stuff I brewed myself. Now, the only thing that's left is for Lenny to do his part in finding the band while we still need to wait for Dumbledore to agree to the whole thing, and then we can finally
Neville smiled as he saw them awkwardly looking at anything except each other.
But what now?
Just like no one else did.
"Muggle?" Harry asked Hagrid.
Harry's face morphed into one of disbelief as he turned his face to look at Ron.

The next school year was approaching and Draco had spent all summer thinking about Harry FUCKING Potter.
And when he thought about it…he was. He used bullying, insulting Harry as an excuse for wanting to keep his attention. Because he felt so lonely, but…Harry was right. Draco wasn't that lonely, he had a family that loved him, more than enough money, power, a high title…
Harry's thoughts were however stopped by a cheery Lockhart walking towards the rest of the staff.
He'd been falling behind transfiguration for a while now. His work slacking as his focus started moving more and more to herbology, and it became easily evident in his grades. The subject had never been his strongest suit. But with how things were going now, he wasn't really sure if he could pass like this.
"Swish and flick!" She said while doing the movement.
"That Harry is a time turner," Hermione said pointing towards the necklace. "You need to go back in time and save Sirius."
"Yes, I'm finished. Now, stop you're whining, we're going to make it just in time." Draco said, already moving towards the exit as Harry stood there rooted to the spot. Draco grinned wholeheartedly when he heard the vampire stumble after him, opening and closing his mouth like a goldfish when he didn't know what to say.
in front of Harry. He wasn't thinking, he was too drunk on Harry's pheromones and his own that.. he'd simply lost control of his senses. It had been a stupid thing to do, no doubt about it. That he had fantasies about these kind of things didn't mean he had to
Persuasion.
Draco's head slowly lifted from his book as he gave both of them a curious glance.
possessive. And that you can get very easily overtaken by your vampire side, you know, with all the ehm... you know. And I already know how strong you guys are and how vampires can get extremely…lusty and stuff like that," God, how many times the things Hermione told him kept him awake at night, which now he realized had probably been her purpose all along. Bitch. "Fun fact, there was this vampire in the 70s-"
"Such as?" He chuckled, holding the retched clothing item in front of him, teasing his eyes in a hole to emphasise his point. Hermione instantly blushed, looking away, in a way that made Ron look at the item more closely. That's when a shining label hidden in the shirt's collar revealed itself as one of his favourite clothing brands. Holding it in front of himself he realized...
"Do what you want," Hermione said through gritted teeth.
"As if you are! Who would even call their
So yeah, that sucked too.
The train ride was almost over and Draco was into his usual compartment that he used when he'd want to be alone.
Apparently, regret came way to fast.
Potter turned around almost instantly, then turned around to glare at Draco even more fiercely.
Harry contemplated it for a second before he decided to hell with it, knowing Draco was probably waiting for him to agree like he himself always did. Argh, how was he supposed to agree to something he was sure he wouldn't-
The man was looking at some weapons when he picked up a morning star.
"I can get used to this." He said in a happy daze.
the spoiled brat. Selfish, cowardly, vile, obnoxious little Malfoy. Scaring everyone away with his horrible personality. Family of a follower of the dark lord himself. One big
It's here!
But really? Why now? What was different about Harry now?! Harry didn't even show his scent that often, so why the heck did it feel the need to reveal itself now?! The first time he smelt it they were both eating dinner, and it would show up without any sign of it! There was no pattern, it was completely irregular! It didn't even make sense where it happened! Draco would get all flustered and hard while Harry kept being indifferent, as if nothing was wrong! And here he was, sucking Draco's cock and doing things with his mouth Draco didn't even know he could do! Really! It only happened at the times where Harry seemed…
Dumbledore looked around him, seeing that there was nobody there. "Come, Harry, we'll talk about this in my office.
…Okay he was melodramatic, blame it on the alcohol.
Draco turned back towards his table. They had been here for over two hours, just another fifteen minutes before he needed to wake Harry. They spend most of their afternoons in here, the room of requirement, to catch up or to simply be with each other. After Harry's dispute with Weasley, Draco had been glad when he saw both of them walking up to him, laughing.
He rolled off of him, missing the warmth beneath him almost immediately. His breath was coming out in short puffs and he felt as if he had just run fifty laps around the Quidditch pitch. Draco observed him silently, having a sort of shyness on display that Harry thought was highly inappropriate after what they had done. He wasn't complaining though, the behaviour being awfully adorable and making Harry want to kiss him for the thousandth time that evening.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No problems I trust Hagrid?" Dumbledore asked while Hagrid was dismounting his bike. "No sir, the little fellow fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol," Hagrid said happily. "Try not to wake him. There you go." Hagrid gave the little baby to Albus while looking fondly at it.
"Non-supernatural foke," Hagrid explained. "This boy has had his name down ever since you were born. He's going to the finest school of creatures and monsters in the world AND he'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore." Hagrid said proudly.
Harry stared down at the book, before giving her a confused look.
It had warmed his heart when Harry had asked him to help search for a gift -even though he wasn't all too fond of Weasley, he knew it meant a lot to Harry. That's why it didn't stop his initial surprise when the vampire actually took his advice and picked the gift he had sought out. It gave him a sort of…domesticated feeling. And he hadn't expected how much he liked that thought.
He'd heard some stories, from rumors to facts. When he began to develop feelings for Harry he even asked Severus some questions about the vampire race, since the man wouldn't shut up about his school's nemesis 'James Potter'. Because honestly? If he didn't know any better he would say the Nephilim was more obsessed towards his dead archenemy than his dead crush.
'NO, concentrate you, idiot!' He tried to snap himself out of it. His eyes blinking back open as made an effort to speak. Alas, he wasn't making much sense, with Draco kissing him so insistingly. Only being able to produce a silent muffle while he tried in vain to pry Draco off of him. And he probably shouldn't have done that, because it seemed only to urge his boyfriend on! Making him strengthen his grip on Harry. Damn, he really did like it when Draco was acting so desperately. Anytime, but the risk was too high on it now and he wasn't ready to throw Draco for the wolves just yet. Ha! Wolves.
"Hermione?" He asked worried, making a move to open the curtains but felt someone holding it in place. "Hermione, open the curtains."
. Because he was getting hungry, like
He breathed a sigh of relief and felt his eyes dropping a bit. When he tried to lie on his thigh though, he felt pain on his neck. He brought the hand that had been lying there in front of him, seeing that his claws were red with blood. He frowned as he moved his hand back and felt two punctures left in his skin.
He pictured pushing Draco against one of the pillars of the Quidditch pitch, snogging him until he couldn't see straight anymore.
That's what he kept telling himself as he walked through the corridors, getting more and more fidgety as he neared the hidden door of the room of requirement.
"You won't, I'll kill you before that happens," Hermione said, confident.
"Is it true you fainted?" Malfoy asked him, sounding concerned. But Harry had obviously mistook that, because not even a second later the guy next to him pretended to faint which made Malfoy say, "I mean, you actually fainted?" in a mocking voice.
Cute!
Harry walked out of the station, looking from right to left, trying to recall how Ron and him had flown over the city. Which was hard, especially after six years.
Harry shook his head, chuckling. "Yes, I know that silly. I mean how do want to do it?"
Lupin looked in horror, hearing all those words by all those people and still hadn't stopped, and if Lupin wasn't mistaken he heard Lucius Malfoy's voice in there too.
Not to forget his conversation with Hermione.
"This is your heatroom," He said, or more likely stated. He felt lighter somehow, relaxed in the familiar space. This is where he had travelled through in dark corridors with a bag full of various snacks and books. Looking forward to nonsensical conversations over a steaming cup of chocolate milk. It had felt like they had formed a bond of some sorts, on a deeper level then their argumentive friendship. Like they understood one another.
"Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally..." Fred said before they walked away.
"I happen to be his girlfriend!"
She looked at him with suspicion but let it go for now. After all, there were more urgent things to discuss.
blame him for 'attacking' him in that
Their eyes all seemed to be frozen on the feather but that didn't last long. They all turned to stare at Seamus after he let his feather explode.
"Don't worry, I've got you." Ron said, his voice hoarse but not less sincere.
"Are you? Are you really? Because if you were really that sorry, why still going out with that dipshit?!" Ron started to yell.
He ducked his head for a moment. It wasn't like the things he'd said still bothered him, surely at the time they did. He'd felt absolutely miserable living with the Dursleys, had been confused and hurt by how people's opinions of him changed so quickly, had been terrified when facing the man who had killed thousands before him.
Draco lurched to the mirror, steadying himself against the sink. He turned on the tap, splashing the cold water against his face. Then, with a great, heaving shudder he began to cry.
"No problem, no problem…at all. Guess I'll see you then,"
He saw Draco bite his lip as he hesitated.
"I have no idea," He huffed out, raking a hand through his hair. "I would love to dress up for him if only I knew what he liked."
Harry, having not been able to handle all the stares given to him, had walked back to his dorm and took a nap on the couch. He was shaken awake by Dean.
. Like there was some hidden barrier between them that had been put up after their argument. It was as if everytime they were together there was some tenseness in the air and it just felt like their friendship was strained.
Stalker, pfft, as if.
It was a weird sort sensation, but pleasurable all the same. It made Harry's eyelids droop and his breath come out in small puffs. He wasn't ready to succumb though.
Harry squinted his eyes, looking Draco over as if to be contemplating if he was trustworthy enough with that kind of information. He looked around them -even though they both knew they were the only ones in the room- proceeding to signal Draco closer with his finger. When Draco was close enough he moved his mouth to Draco's ear and whispered: "Profesor Severus Snape,"
"I've heard Crabbe's review, and it seems I'm not missing out on very much!" Draco yelled back, making Pansy go silent.
"What a coincidence that I meet you here," Harry said and Draco noticed there wasn't any venom in them nor any anger or irritation, Harry was staring at him and when Draco looked up to see his face, not like the embarrassing way he did before, he was surprised yet again that there wasn't a scowl or anything on his face, but that wasn't what surprised Draco so much, no, Harry was smiling at him.
The trio looked up at Hagrid who was grinning at them, instantly making them feel guilty.
"Sorry, haven't got used to that yet, I forget about them sometimes," He tried to explain, his tone nervous and -now that Draco was paying attention to it- smelled like it too.
"Hmm," Dumbledore said as he went back to his desk, stroking his beard as he looked into space. "Perhaps, you just prefer it directly. That could be an option." Dumbledore said thoughtfully, making Harry's heart sink.
"You know where they've run off to?" Ron asked, trying to keep the conversation going.
Harry found his control slowly slipping away, on one side not wanting to yell at is hurt friend but on the other side wanting to strangle him for the insensitive comment.
Leaving Harry puzzled, because why would Malfoy even be worried about him.
'Control yourself Harry.' Harry told himself attempting to walk past him. He was lucky that the hall wasn't that crowded it would be humiliating to be called out by Malfoy in front of the whole school, especially after people had started to stop being afraid of him.
confused. He scratched the back of his head as he recounted what the hell just had happened. What?-Why did-did he really just-
"Of course not, that was simply what they were: suspicions! Therefore I didn't tell you about them because I didn't have any proof! And I'm sure that if I had; you would have told me that I'm crazy and that our friend would never want to be with
He moved the finger deeper inside of him, feeling the muscles constrict around them as he searched for
"Now, as I was saying, I've prepared a few concoctions this morning. Any ideas what these might be? Yes, Miss...?" Slughorn asked, Draco didn't even need to pay attention to who had raised there hand. He did though, he wouldn't let Potter ruin his favorite subject.
"Harry. Do you think there's any chance at all she's not, you know…" Ron asked with tortured eyes. It pained Harry to see his friend like this.
'He can't do that! Why would he want to do that?! He's great, a bit clumsy, but still great! I didn't throw a stone at Cormac for nothing! He's much better than him if he just had a bit more confidence. I just need to convince him.' Hermione thought frantically.
Voldemort's' face showed he finally understood. "You dirty bloodsucker, I'll show you."
He even went as far as to help Umbridge find the room of requirement. When Potter looked at him with those furious eyes, he felt guilty again. Not so guilty though, that he couldn't insult him on the last day of the school year.
"Well, why don't you get bitten than?! You're the one who's healing powers!" Ron asked.
"Come on, Potter," Draco smirked, seeing Harry's tongue was still out just like a dog's, "when have I ever liked being the only one without a shirt on?"
"Aren't you the one who said:
"Potter, hand me the damn Adder's Fork or the potion will fail!" Draco said a little frustrated, but still looking quite calm. He moved to look at Harry, who in his moment of surprise fell off of his chair, in panic of being caught staring.
When Hermione was done embarrassing Harry like a good friend would do, Harry noticed Malfoy and him had made a crowd. Everyone in the Great Hall was looking at them, most of them in shock. But when it finally dawned on Harry why they were, Malfoy had already disappeared.
"Harry, mate! There you are! Long time no see!" He said as he opened his arms for a hug.
"Ehm. Tadada! Isn't he beautiful?" Hagrid announced throwing a dead ferret towards the feathery beast. "Say hello to Buckbeak."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course I won't and… thank you," Harry smiled at both of them, making himself ready for spending two whole weeks without them. Which reminded him.
"Alright -but still- it's only Draco. You've had dates with him before and you seemed fine then," Hermione lifted her shoulders, not really understanding Harry's dilemma.
"YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!" Voldemort yelled in outrage. Harry turned back towards him, his eyes black and felt his fangs growing.
…His body really wasn't working with him today.
Draco barked.
"What?!" Draco heard Granger and Weasley yell at the same time. When he turned towards them he saw Granger in complete panic.
"Of course not, the weapon chooses you." The man said which confused Harry even more.
and I'm sure it won't hold it back either," Ron gritted through his teeth but didn't let his irritation show beyond that, "Maybe it will even better it! Take my mind off of things so I can view everything with a clear head. You always say how important that is, you don't drag me outside for a study break for nothing, now?"
date.
He sighed, resulting in Hermione looking over at him. His chest felt tight before loosening again as he saw her smile at him.
Draco tried to focus on everything around them, trying to distract himself before he'd lost all composure and Harry would see how much of a nervous wreck he really was. Again he thanked Severus for that, without him his mask of indifference would have fallen minutes ago and it wasn't really comforting seeing how Harry seemed to be as relaxed as ever. Feeling right at home.
"But if he does one thing suspicious, I won't forgive him!"
"It's idiotic!"
Draco was silently eating his lunch. The Slytherin table was practically deserted, much like the other tables. After Severus had given all of them an assignment to write a report about 'the history of weapons and how they're made'. It was only to be expected. And even though most were still researching everything, Draco was already done. He'd already read the most useful books about them and only had to freshen up his memory, and then had started to write.
"Really don't worry about it, I don't mind. Just send everyone my regards, and you just have fun at your uncle's party, okay?" Harry said. He had actually been hoping that he'd be spending Christmas with Sirius, but he had said they were still working on his case and that he wouldn't be able to celebrate it with him this year. The case was getting into their favor now though, so he wouldn't have to worry about next year.
His wolf had been settled too, finding the soft heart-beat coming from the other man very soothing, almost lulling him back to sleep.
"Where have you been?! Nevermind! Off to bed both of you." Hermione yelled, which frightened Harry. Hermione had never been so angry before. 'What did you do?' Harry thought walking towards him, and he could just see Ron shrinking into himself. But clearly wasn't done yet and said; "They get scary when they are older."
They were now in McGonagall's classroom. Draco was standing a foot away from the golden trio smirking, while McGonagall was punishing them by taking 50 points each from their house.
Harry walked up pretending as if he hadn't heard anything.
Harry and Ron were in the Great hall.
About the stars part, I don't know anything about it, so some things a probably don't fit. Doesn't matter lets move on.
But there was only silence.
But now? When he was three hours away from a –supposed to be- romantic date, he could feel every one of those anxieties bubbling up. Pointing out every fault, just like the Dursleys always did.
'Wait, what?' Harry thought.
Harry was...
How it happened, Harry didn't know, but suddenly there was a snake on the stage and Harry started talking to it asking if it could leave the boy it was hissing at. It worked and Harry wanted to help the boy but was stopped.
His senses had gone haywire, the sound of Draco's heart beat music to his ears, the smell of Draco's arousal slowly regaining. He raised his husband up, his arm lifted to the werewolf's back to press him firmly against him.
"Well, no. I mean... I'm just saying it could be a contributing factor." Harry said, putting the map down and frowning at himself. Why exactly did he say that? He could just go with 'she's nice hair' or 'she's beautiful eyes' or 'she's cute freckles' or something crappy like that. He could even say; 'she's got nice boobs' but Harry didn't care about that and that would certainly make Ron angry at him. Why did he choose skin out of all of them?
Why was Harry such an ass to him! He just picked up Neville's ball and looked at it for Christ sake! He didn't really want to bully Neville, and he would have just given it back, but after such a treatment Draco wanted to irritate Harry. So he challenged him, he would've just given back the ball after.
"Or at least without your blessings first. You're important to me, I love you and I wouldn't forgive myself if I hurt you, so I again apologize for what I just did and…ehm, for when I attacked you." Harry said, bowing his head in a submissive gesture. Before looking back into Draco's eyes.
"Don't worry," Harry said in a slightly mocking tone, "I'm going to give you
Draco watched on with curiosity, the sucking somehow feeling different than when Harry had bitten him. It was less forceful and more tame, giving Draco an opportunity to pull away if he wanted to. Giving him the absolute control.
"And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy," Hagrid said.
"Look who we have here, long time no see," Parkinson said in a nasty voice, she hadn't really said anything to the trio the first couple of years but came out to be hopelessly in love with Malfoy and decided that enemies of Malfoy were enemies of her. She was a Harpy, her fingernails were as sharp as knives and feathers decorated her arms.
When he reached for the belt, he made the same soundless question he always made. He knew it drove Draco mad and took a great deal in enjoying the way the blonde's face would contour into a frustrated –but loving- rage. A mix of wanting to strangle Harry to death and cuddle up to him like they were the only ones left in the world.
"Oh, how dare he,"
"Oh, alright," Draco responded, moving his shaking fingers to Harry's belt and unfastening it. He felt anticipation blooming inside him as he undid the bottom and zipper too, pulling some fabric out of the way as he now faced Harry's magnificent cock. It was…larger then he had anticipated, although he didn't really have any other model to go off on in his fantasies than his own. But it looked so much
"True, but I am curious," Draco said as he took one of the nearby books that were spread around the table, reading the title.
"…it's absolutely delicious," He sighed, looking back at Draco with a glassy look in his eyes. "I don't believe I've tasted anything that was as remotely as refined as…as…
were alright, or just now when you asked me to talk because you were worried about
He was walking next to Ron and Hermione. When Ron said, with an already annoyed voice; "Oh, no." but when Harry wanted to ask what was wrong, Crabbe, Goyle, Theodore Nott, Pansy Parkinson had already surrounded them.
"Nothing special, but..." He grunted, picking up his wand triumphantly before turning his head towards her, a mischievous look in his eyes. "I'm sure you're going to like it."
Ron looked at her flabbergasted. His hands held in front of him before he decided to stand up. Surely she would see reason in this?! It was one night of fun,
Draco couldn't help but let a laugh out at that. Harry looking around the table, shrugging as he raised his hands, shaking them in an 'I don't get it' kind of way.
BUT! But, yes there was a but. When he was playing the game, he would make his main focus the snitch. And he didn't let himself get distracted by a sweaty, huffing Potter that moved every muscle in his body to the max.
That's why he was more than a little nervous as he tried to comfort his lover, not knowing what he was doing or if it helped Harry in any way. He had been almost completely lost on what to do, never having had to deal with someone else's
"O THANK GOD," Ron said surprising Harry and the girl. "I really didn't mean to upset you, I'm truly sorry," Ron said to Harry.
"Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?" The hat said.
"I don't mean it in a bad way!" Harry quickly said as he saw Draco folding into himself. "Come on, I know you've planned something, especially on Christmas day."
Ever since their first date, the first time Harry had given him head, he had gotten this ludicrous idea to ask Draco –every bloody
Aphrodisiac that's what it was, maddening, hypnotising and exhilarating to no end. Draco's legs that where wrapped around Harry's waist tightened, his cock ready to burst as blood left his body in the most sensual way.
They were face to face, inches away from each other, both looking into the other one's eyes. Draco noticed the slight change in color in those forest green eyes, the color black invading and coloring the raven-haired iris'. A hint of a fang glinting between his cold lips as he felt himself leaning in, wanting to be captivated by that strong mouth. He breathed out a sigh of relief as a spicy scent of cinnamon filled the room -feeling himself turn into a puddle of liquid- it was getting stronger, heavier the more he let himself move into Harry. And it was just
It only angered Draco further that Harry actually thought he would fall for that.
"Hello, Harry Potter," Luna said in her normal, dreamy voice. Harry frowned he didn't know much of the weird looking creatures but they didn't exactly look so friendly. It, however, did make some noises that Harry supposed meant that it was enjoying it. So Harry walked towards it and Luna.
Hermione sniffed the air but was still unable to detect Ron's whereabouts. Perhaps she'd just moved passed him when she walked back to the dance floor or something. She had thought he would be playing truth or dare with the Hufflepuffs or drinking his socks off with the Ravenclaws but hadn't found him in either spaces. He was most likely busy trying to be a good host and make sure everything was running smoothly.
It was surprising how much he didn't care being paired up with Malfoy again. He was actually glad he was, as he heard all the girls screaming at Slughorn and him. It also gave him a chance to apologize.
Harry took a string from his pocket, he had already thought about this. But moving on, he took the string and tied it to the goats. And walking back to the statue with the other end of it. He was just in time because Crabbe and Goyle were walking towards it, only noticing the goats when Harry started pulling the string making the Goats move…or slide...yep they were more like sliding.
"Miss Granger." McGonagall continued, ignoring Draco.
Taking one more step towards it, he found himself eye to eye with the open entrance gates of the castle. No Harry to be seen.
"NO!" Harry shouted. "Cedric!" when he looked at Cedric he saw blood gushing out of his head as his last breath left him.
"I said fuck
"Riddikulus!" Weasley said and the spider was almost falling over when it found itself with its eight legs trapped in roller skates.
He narrowed his eyes in return. "You sure our famous do-gooder Hermione Granger would want to hear about such criminal activities?"
"P-Pott-t-ter, g-get a hold of yourself!" Draco stammered but Harry just growled at him, wanting that his pretty little wolf would shut up and just let him taste him. Draco couldn't help but whimper, he couldn't deny he loved this. Most of his fantasies were with Harry grinding against him, growling. And now it was happening for real, and it felt
shirt in a moment like
"Well, I don't care!"
"Well, it has some true elements of vampires in it. That's because the writer 'Bram Stoker' was a vampire himself. He of course also put some fake things in there, like that you can't see your reflection and that Dracula was a vampire etcetera. But what Bram did show very well in the book is how a vampire loves." Hermione said, looking at Harry to see his reaction. Seeing that his face had gone white she continued. "Well, it's not that precise of course, it differs by person. But vampires do have the tendency to be extremely possessive, monopolizing and obsessing with the person they love. And when you're with Cho it doesn't feel that way, if you were in love with her it would mean that you would try and spend every single moment with her, you would be extremely jealous about her even crying over Cedric, her ex. And not only that, when a vampire falls in love it's rare, it only happens when you've found your mate. I suppose it's also possible with someone who isn't your mate but yeah." Hermione finished.
As if right on cue the blackbird chirped, making Harry smile. It was a cute bird, too bad his little friend was missing.
"What'd we tell you? Complete nutter." Crabbe said.
Dumbledore quirked an eyebrow but let it go. "Take my arm," Dumbledore said, extending it. Harry was looking at the arm, noticing Dumbledore's smirk and not trusting it.
"Fighting? Why in heavens name would we be fighting? It's not like Hermione has done anything whatsoever for me to be angry with her do I?" Ron said. But his forceful tone made it sound like he was indeed, very much angry.
"What are you guys talking about?" Ron suddenly heard a voice behind him.
"Alright, I'm just gonna go ahead." Harry said but he didn't think they heard him over their 'conversation'. Harry took a couple of steps backward before turning around and bumping into someone. And again, when Harry wanted to apologize he stopped the words after he saw Draco Malfoy turning around, together with his friends.
Harry looked at Draco, seeing the tear stained face looking back at him he was surprised when he not only saw gratefulness but also awe. Well, he wasn't really surprised, he'd just helped Draco's father out big time. Maybe even so big that he made it so Lucius had a couple fewer years in Azkaban.
"Listen, Granger, I know you don't like me and I know your a mud-
"Shut up," Harry said, snapping his hips to get the point across. And Draco obeyed –if you didn't count the constant cries for more.
Draco let out a frustrated breath. It was clear Harry was playing again to work on Draco's nerves. But two could play that game.
"DRACO!" Harry yelled, moving quickly as he gripped Draco's shoulders and stared down at him, looking a little frustrated as well as uncomfortable, but it didn't stop the incredible power his gaze left on Draco.
ON TIME BITCHESSSSS!
"EASY?!" Ron almost screamed.
Harry felt his cock starting to stir at the image in front of him. Feeling a thrill run down his body as he looked down at his boyfriend. Despite having had his doubts, he found himself actually liking the position.
When Draco didn't see and traces of Potter he sighed, and realised he was smiling.
"Oh dear, you are setting up a drugs cartel? That's illegal you guys!"
"Don't get all cocky with –oh!"
"Hey, Harry?" Ron spoke up, looking at both Harry and Draco sternly. "Next time you two pull such a crazy stunt. Please realise you can get caught, by us and that me being okay with you two, doesn't mean I want to bloody see it!"
"Pfft, of course, they are. I mean, theyr' both werewolves, inp-credible smart, stylish and have those, those scary looks. They're bloody perfect together!" Ron said depressed and annoyed.
She still hadn't confessed.
"Right?!"
"Don't worry we put a breathing charm on him,"
Draco trembled from want, going back to suck at Harry's red head, tasting the pre-cum pilling up.
And the bludger exploded.
Draco hoped the dim lighting would make it unable for Harry notice the stupid blush that came over him. Dammit, why did his lover always catch him off guard? Now he really cursed Weasley for throwing his dumb party and letting Harry make him so flustered. Even when his whole body fluttered with affection for his lover's actions.
Harry watched as the Slytherins' table cheered in happiness. After their team won.
"Hold on, I didn't know they were either!" Hermione yelled back, making another group hurrying out of the common room.
Harry frowned at Ron for a moment.
"Sure," Harry answered, walking towards it and sitting down. When Ron was seated to they both got rid of their jackets. Outside it was just right with the jackets on but inside it was smothering.
"So we're good?" Harry carefully asked and saw the white wolf nod once.
of him. Harry scratched the back of his head, breathing in a sigh, not knowing what to do anymore. He never expected Draco to feel that way, never thought anyone could feel that way about him. Had he always thought of Harry like that? Always hid how lowly he thought of himself in comparison to Harry?
"Alright, yes it was but I didn't know what else to do!" She moved in front of him despite his effort to ignore her searching eyes. "It was stupid and cowardly, I'm not gonna make an excuse for that. I should've told you as soon as I knew."
"That's a boggart, that is." Someone said, and Draco's hands started sweating, he already had an idea where this was going.
They made their way towards him and sat down next to each other, they're both smiling but Ron's seemed a bit off.
(See the end of the chapter for
What was he doing? This wasn't happening, right? Not again.
Draco remembered all too well when Dumbledore practically gave the Gryffindors the house cup, even though Slytherin had obviously won. In the beginning, he thought Dumbledore was probably not so bad as his father told him to be. But he found out that his father was right, the old man had obviously his favorites.
"No, he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing." Harry said in an angry tone.
He closed his eyes almost desperately, hoping Harry hadn't noticed.
What was wrong with him? He was supposed to be happy for Malfoy for making friends. Yes, it had been an unexpected one, but who cared?!
She nodded, giving him a soft smile as she adjusted to the stretch. She knew his member was going to be far wider than those three fingers, she had visual proof of that. But until now it hadn't hurt, only a slight burn with the added digit, so she wasn't worried.
And yes, he'd tried.
"Dammit Ron, I mean if she's fine besides her predicament," Harry said, wanting to facepalm himself. Ron nodded, his flush slowly ebbing away as he began to explain.
"That doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is that YOU will make sure he doesn't!" Lucius said and stormed to the door.
"I found out last night when I talked to her in the library,"
"Now, now, Severus there isn't any reason to be so cranky on the first day of school. Harry will you please go to your table?" Dumbledore said, smiling at Potter.
"Stuff…" He cleared his throat, noticing Ron scrunching up his face in puzzlement while he himself was busy not to look at Draco. Fuck, he didn't want to talk about that now, certainly not with Ron still there. "Look it doesn't matter. What matters is that she has a crush, and no," Harry stopped Ron, "I don't know who it is, she wouldn't even tell me which house he was in or what kind of creature he is."
What was he supposed to say?
"Hey, Hagrid," Harry responded.
She had been contemplating the idea for a while, knowing heats could be very painful without someone to help her with it, but she couldn't just walk up to Ron and say: "Hey Ron. Can I ask you something, you see I'm going to fall into heat soon and would like you to fuck me into oblivion those past few days since I will be super horny and won't be able to think of anything other than you and your cock. Oh! Also, you are my mate and I've been harboring this massive crush on you ever since second year."
"Why what?"
"Oh-Oh yes, yes yes yes!" Harry moaned as he started seeing spots. "Oh yes!"
Ron watched Harry with furrowed brows, as if even the idea of being rich and not spending your days in luxury but instead going to work was something alien to him.
"Oh don't mention it, it wasn't a problem. I mean, sure we needed to know where they were first. Needing to ask both Dumbledore and McGonagall for permission to skip, calling the manager of the Chudley Cannons, who ignored us. Then we called the hotel they were staying at, who didn't want to give us any information because that was against their rules. Then we proceeded to break in, me sniffing them out with the use of their socks you stole from them, only to find out they weren't there. So we asked around, seeing some fans standing outside the building with them saying that they went to the training pitch than they proceeded to yell
"Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before." The spider said.
Draco started to fumble with his fingers as he thought of some good lie or something, anything else to distract her.
"I'm hopeless," Neville said dejected looking over at the ground.
Harry lowered his eyes to a goblet filled with blood. And felt dread creeping up on him as he looked at it.
' as well!
"Aren't we supposed to wait 'till the fireworks for that?" Harry asked, smiling as he saw Draco's impassive face after he turned to face him.
"You nodded!" Bloody hell! Hermione Granger, his crush ever since first-year,
"That's it! Oh yes!" He let his head fall back onto the pillow, the headboard pounding against the wall with such violence Draco found it a small miracle it hadn't collapsed yet. "You're heavenly."
"What are you laughing about? This is serious!" Hermione shrieked, only managing to make Ron laugh louder. "The N.E.S.T.s are coming up soon and we need to be prepared!"
'Come on. Just spit it out. Let's get it over with. After this, we will be in heaven for the next seven and a half minutes. Your pride is a small sacrifice for the greater good.'
." Emma asked, starting to play with her hair, and making Harry a bit uncomfortable. Harry looked at Dudley who gave him a death glare.
Draco opened his mouth, his words not coming out properly as his whole world seemed to flip upside down. "But...you -I thought...But how come you're so good at this then?!"
"Yes, you did."
'Almost there,' Draco thought, looking up in a silent prayer. Hoping against hope that Harry was still there, even when on this short of a distance he should be able to see him clearly. Standing there, waiting. He wasn't able to. Not seeing even a small speck of the raven-haired vampire, much to his disappointment.
"I mean, when Harry told us he had gotten detention with Snape. You know how it goes." She said as she laughed nervously. "All of my emotions have turned into a turmoil, you know."
authority over his body.
Dammit, this was bad. He didn't even know if Draco wanted to make their relationship public, or if he was ready for the confrontation or the press for that matter. Wasn't even sure if it was okay for him to tell his friends about it! It wasn't like they had talked things through, Harry had wanted to but with all the things going on hadn't got a chance to discuss it.
"Now Neville listen. We were-
"Ron was talking about a party he wanted to host, to celebrate our final year in Hogwarts," Neville replied, his face in a friendly expression as he smiled at Hermione, making Ron grumble.
"When I saw the face of Lucius Malfoy right after Voldemort had taken his mask off I wasn't that surprised." Harry began looking at the judge and the crowd. "I'm going, to be honest here, I hate the man. I don't care about him, I prefer that he would rot in Azkaban for the rest of his life…" Harry heard Narcissa's cries becoming louder and saw some people smiling, he heard some people murmuring in a happy tone about Lucius getting what he deserved. "But when I saw the mask dissolve…I saw a man terrified." The room fell silent, some smiles crumbling, frowns beginning to form. "He told Voldemort about how loyal he was to him…but when I listened to his heartbeat the only thing I heard was a lie. When Voldemort…touched my head, my scar it hurt almost as bad as the crucio curse he'd done a moment later. He was enjoying himself when he watched me writhe in pain, but he removed his finger when he heard Lucius yelling at him to stop." Harry saw people covering their mouths and saw Rita Skeeter writing it all down. "He-he yelled for him to stop. And when Voldemort focused his attention on Lucius, I can say with utmost conviction that he was threatening Narcissa Malfoy and Draco Malfoy. And I can't say that this will justify all of his wrongdoings, but I do think it justifies him working for Voldemort. He was after all only protecting his family." Harry ended. The crowd had gone wild and the judge was slamming his tiny hammer while shouting; "Silence! Silence!"
Again thanks for waiting and hope you guys like the chapter.
"I'm sorry for not telling you," Harry said quietly, Ron not responding. "I know you are angry with me, and…I deserve it,"
Potter.' Draco thought outraged. 'Ow, I'm so much better than the rest,
"…three months before I realized, probably been over a year," Harry whispered, knowing what Ron was asking. He immediately regretted everything he'd done, keeping quiet about his relationship, keeping quiet about his holidays and keeping quiet about his love. Especially when seeing that hurt expression Ron was making.
Harry balled his fist and looked over at his watch…that wasn't there. 'Shit forgot about that! Arg! Can't anything go right for once?!' Harry thought to himself remembering that he had destroyed his watch, that apparently wasn't waterproof, in the Trimonster tournament.
She silently berated herself. Telling herself to think positively and not let herself be put off. This time it would work!
Right now was one of those moments.
Putting a stopper on it, he moved out of the Hall as if nothing was amiss.
"I bet you could," Harry whispered in his ear, making a shiver pass through Draco's body. Draco's eyes getting a little diluted as he felt his lover's breath so close, to hear that deep voice dropping a few octaves-
'I can't even have normal friends let alone a lover, plus Potter didn't even give me a chance to be friends with me to begin with. If I ever told him how I feel he would surely embarrass me in front of the whole school.' He was so overwhelmed by his thoughts he didn't notice that his mother was talking about how she first fell in love and her feelings then.
"What you're smiling for, princess?" A voice behind her said and she immediately recognised it to be Elliot's. She whirled around to face him, letting a few crumples fall to the ground as she tried to answer.
It's finally here! Pfew, it's over.
"RON!" Harry yelled and Hermione wanted to walk over to him. "NO! Don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing." Hermione moved back. Harry walked the diagonal in front of the King. "Checkmate." He said and the Kings sword fell to the ground.
Thanks for the kudos/reading this fic!
"How far do you want this to go?"
"I don't know, Draco. Maybe its just my luck, I don't know if you noticed but I'm not exactly the Leprechaun in our school," Harry tried to joke but his smile disappeared from his face as soon as he noticed the serious look on Draco's face. "What? It's the truth. First I had to spend eleven years of my life cleaning up behind my pigheaded cousin, getting not even so much as a thank you, then I find out I'm a vampire and get completely overrun by all this…vampire stuff, media trying to praise me as well as tear me down, a guy that I killed as a toddler comes back to life and tries to kill me in return, then I need to kill him again because I'm somehow the chosen one and all of that and I'm the only one that can. And at the end of all of that is the stacks and stacks of homework Snape gives me."
Curiosity won, however, and Draco started asking himself; How would it feel? Draco had heard some students talk about it and how
"…And this Amortentia. The most powerful love potion in the world." Granger said looking pointedly at the cauldron. "It's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them. For example, I smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste-"
"Ah, shut up!" Harry smiled and curled himself around Draco as soon as the surrounding crowd enveloped them. The stench of sweat and arousal heavy in the air, but Draco didn't let his thoughts drift off. Instead, he giggled as Harry made him swirl.
"You're trying to question me?"
He waited for Harry to move on, knowing his lover's rhythm by now. And it being more and more pleasurable as time passed by and Harry perfected the style to shape completely around Draco's preferences and wants. Always starting with the same method of circling his glans, giving the sensitive flesh featherlight licks and kisses as he coated it in his spit. And as Draco kept whimpering at the attention he was given, he waited for the next movement. With Harry slowly moving down towards the base of his cock in one single swipe, only to completely abandon it, in favor of torturing his balls and pubic hair. It was always like this. Never being changed up, except at times when Harry tried to grasp what made Draco moan louder.
The crowd cheered and clapped, people, trying to get of the stances and thank Harry for saving their lives.
"Harry please stop," Ron begged, a frightened look on his face as he saw Draco lowering the book once more, "I don't want to know."
"I, I am," Harry said to the man.
Draco still couldn't help but replay what had happened in his head, over and over again. His heart still beating like crazy, his body still pressed against the other side of the wall of the room of requirement –the door having disappeared long ago-, his face still flushed, his breath still coming out labored and shallow, his arousal still pressing against his pants…
Harry grumbled against the glass, feeling his golden snitch necklace unfurl as it tried to cheer him up. When he stood back up, he did so with a heavy sigh. He opened up his jacket and moved his hand underneath his shirt, pulling out the necklace from underneath.
"No, no, no! This can't be!" Draco heard someone wailing.
"Keep your nerve. Steady."
Draco touched his lips as he remembered their last kiss. It had been nothing like the first one, or the small little pecks that had followed that one, it was harder more urgent, more
"So, where are we going?" Draco asked tentatively, putting his chin up in the air as he took a deep breath.
"You mean to say, that when you were in heat while I was desperately trying not to pop a boner in front of you, you had been t-touching yourself, wearing my shirt?! Getting off on me?!" He spluttered, "I have dreamt of that image for months on end, not knowing..."
"Draco, you aren't supposed to yell in the library-"
"Did you hear it," Harry said panicked.
The students looked with their mouths almost hitting the ground.
Her eyes darted around the small confined space as she held on the curtain for dear life. She could not let him see her like
Draco halted for a moment. His lips opened as he left his next sentence hang in the air…whut?
He had thought about what had happened at potions a few weeks ago and had been following Malfoy everywhere he went. He'd seen Malfoy casually helping some of his fellow Slytherins who had lost their way, noticed Malfoy holding the door for an old professor who had his hands full with some strange objects, had seen him helping a Hufflepuff collecting her books from the ground after they bumped into each other. Malfoy hadn't provoked him once, had kept his distance. Only when they were partnered up (what strangely happened rather often) did he ever speak to Harry and even then, he seemed to talk with respect and honesty.
"What were you two thinking?!" Hermione yelled at Harry and Ron. They were sitting in one of the couches in the Gryffindor common room, it being empty and having a free period. Hermione was standing though, pacing around in fury as she started her scold.
Sorry for the little delay.
That night when Harry was in his bed trying to fall asleep he couldn't help but think about who his mate could possibly be.
Draco moaned out loud, trying to muffle it with his hand as he imagined another hand squeezing at his stiff cock. He felt warm breath touching his shoulder, making him muffle out his cries.
Harry was freaked out about this but he knew that it could be a coincidence. So he tried something.
And when he read the name on the tombstone he not only got worried for himself but also for Cedric.
Lockhart began handing out papers.
"What's that? Hanging underneath?" Ron asked
"WHAT?!" Ron said.
"Yeah, that is what I think."
The white wolf turned around again and began sniffing Harry as if it was looking for injuries. And Harry just kept laughing looking at the wolf in amusement starting to pet it. The wolf only seemed to huff, looking Harry in the eye again. Harry's laughing slowed down, and then he finally recognized it.
"Again? You mean, the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?" Hermione asked.
Finally, something Draco recognized named Goyle's stupidity.
They were all quiet. Harry could see in Neville's eyes he was waiting for them to rip him to shreds, and it pained him, he wanted to comfort him but was stopped by Hermione.
He got through it though. But now, whenever his body started hurting he knew it was a warning that if he decided to not do his exercise, there
"Better out than in. Who was he trying to curse anyway?" Hagrid asked after giving Ron a bucket to throw up in.
He felt Harry pressing against his back, moving in to scent him and Draco let his head fall back, encouraging it.
He looked up at the ceiling, his hands ruffling his hair. When a thought hit him.
Sure, even if he wasn't avoiding Harry like the pest, Harry didn't know what to say to him either. He didn't know how to react to Malfoy's display of vulnerability, if that was what it was. Had Harry been wrong all along? Had his friends been right? Or was he right, and it was all an act? Malfoy did say '
"Come on, Harry. We're her friends, what if she's in trouble?" Ron said, his tone filling with mischief. Harry looked at him with both eyebrows raised.
Draco was shopping with his mother for a new robe for school. It was beautiful weather outside, the birds whistled, the sun was out, it was a great day.
"That makes sense, but then we will have an opening right there so if you put Owen right here, he would be able to watch both sides," Ron mused, pointing at the drawing with one hand while eating a sausage in the other.
"What, not even an apologie for being such a big oaf. I'm talking to you! Oh let me guess, you're just as deaf as you are stupid! No wonder you're such a disappointment." Malfoy said as Harry was walking away. Harry didn't turn around and he was proud of that, the insults weren't as harsh as normal but they still got under his skin and his once good mood was ruined thanks to Draco Malfoy once again!
But he still not stopped, instead he moved, even more, faster, harder and less precise. Which made Draco not only shiver and gasp but also made his moans louder.
"Truce," Draco said as he shook her hand. Even when Draco wanted to take his revenge he knew the girl could throw in some big punches.
"I am your mate?!" Ron sputtered after her, feet almost stumbling. Hermione walked in front of him in a steadfast pace, eyes fixed on the path ahead. Not giving him an explanation, answer or any other sign that she had heard him. Which, even by his standards, was
"A large bottle of A negative is out of the question then?" Draco brushed it off with a nervous laugh.
"Not even you, Lucius." He said and slashed him as well.
"My apologies professor Dumbledore, I didn't mean to be late, but I missed the train." The boy said, picking up the stool and sorting hat, placing the hat back on the stool while it complained about running hooligans.
He was handling it better now though, after all, he wanted to spend time with each of them equally and that mostly resulted in both of them -unintentionally- having to spend time with the other which resulted in shady looks and the occasional insult thrown in there, but he tried to keep that to a minimum. He had kind of figured out how to control himself and suppress a lot of those protective
"Okay, alright…so this might actually work," Harry smiled to himself, feeling a little giddy at the thought of finally opening up that vial he hid in case of an emergency. Which, to him, this definitely was.
He moved on to the next one seeing the words "Merry Christmass Harry! And don't forget to study." and laughing at it. He opened up Hermione's gift and saw a giant snow globe with a miniature Hogwarts in it. He shook it and saw how little snowflakes danced inside it.
"That, that…Stop doing that!" She said.
And, oh. That felt…
Harry looked at her face in a slightly concerned manner, only now seeming to notice her lack of response and flustered eyes.
He clutched at the back of the vampire's head, pulling him back towards him as he delved into him.
"Yes! Yes, now will you please stop!" Draco cried, breathing harshly after the git
"Wow, wow, take it easy. I don't mind." He held up his hands in surrender and hoped to reassure her. He didn't understand where the sudden distress came from, it was only a rag. Certainly not something to get all troubled about. "Here," He said, hand held outstretched, "I'll put it back where I found it."
"Leave him alone! He didn't want all of that!" A red-headed girl said.
"Oh, shut up," Draco replied fondly, taking hold of Harry's empty goblet. He was sure that there was still some residue from his
"Ohh, ah, nmm, nh" Draco moaned with an occasional shudder pressing his claws into Harry's skin and probably breaking it but Harry didn't seem to mind nor care.
To actually say something.
He wasn't sure if he would even want it.
"Of course, I'd do anything if you'd forgive me, I love you."
"I-we, we could ask you the same thing!" Harry fired back, pointing a finger at them while trying to sound indignant. Now, put an emphasis on
"Lovely spot," Ron said sarcastically looking at the satyr and the goat who just walked by.
Harry and Ron smiled at her.
Harry smiled at Hermione and ruffled Rons' hair a bit, before walking a bit faster to be able to walk beside Malfoy.
All the while Draco was breathing in deeply, preparing himself for what was to come. But he felt like the same nervous boy as he was the first time around on that unforgetful night. That warm and pleasurable night…
Harry tried focusing on his teeth and willed his fangs to return to normal. After a couple of minutes, it worked and Harry smiled.
"I believe I'm the one screaming my voice hoarse here."
"I rather not waste my time with a couple of idiots," Malfoy yelled back.
'Well, isn't this going to be great!" He thought sarcastically before moving to follow her.
But he didn't want to say that out loud! It was humiliating, awkward and above all
"How do you know," McGonagall asked shocked he knew about it.
She was a little stunned by that thought, she wasn't used to Ron taking so much responsibility. She wasn't used to seeing him like that. Sure, when they were studying together she sometimes saw a few glimpses or when he was discussing Quidditch with Harry. But it wasn't Ron's nature, he was known to be impulsive and
Only a few more days before the next school year began, and Draco was actually quite relieved, wanting to get out of his room and man up. So when his mother asked him for his help with some cabinet he accepted and went with her to Diagon Alley.
"Master. Thank you, master." Wormtail said holding out his right arm, the one where the hand was cut off.
But then the kid started crying, or it would go back to their parents. And Draco would never see them again.
"Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once," Ron said.
Draco shuddered as he made a disgusted sound, shaking his head as he pulled up a clean pair of trousers. His wolf starting to run circles in his head –impatient- Draco knew it wanted to find Harry as quickly as possible, it always seemed to relax and wag its tail when the vampire was close. Not that Draco minded, it actually made him quite relieved, stepping into a relationship where a part of Draco wanted to do nothing more than to rip his lover's throat out wasn't what they would call
"You called me a whore! And with the way you were going, I was surprised you didn't go on a rampage before I had the chance to!"
"Earlier today Professor Moody placed the tri-monster cup deep within the maze. Only he knows its exact position. Now as Mr. Diggory..." Dumbledore started his speech and stopped for a moment to let everyone cheer before continuing. "...and Mr. Potter…" and again the crowd cheered. Harry saw Ron and Hermione in the crowd and couldn't help but smile. "tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. Followed by Mr. Krum... followed by Mrs. Delacour…The first person to touch the cup will be the winner. I've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she only need to use their flare gun. Contestants gather round."
"And I have yet to figure out why she dumped me -I mean, sure, I was planning to break up with her a couple of days before that, since I wasn't enjoying our time together anymore. Which wasn't fair to her, it was as if I was keeping her on a leash you know, she was trying so hard and I just...I just couldn't do it," He said, sighing, "I wanted to finish it on a good note but then she suddenly comes up to me, screaming and bawling her eyes out in a way you didn't know if you should run or hold her hand, and told me we were over."
"No mister Malfoy, you may not. Not even you know everything there is to know about your species." Snape said making Malfoy huff.
"I-I'm sorry you don't have to do this if you don't want to," Draco hurriedly said, already moving his hand down to cover himself back up.
"So let's start, shall we? You all have exactly half an hour to complete this potion, good luck," Slughorn said, clapping his hands with a big smile on his face before sending the students off to do their work.
"Ahm! Nm ha ah!"
"It's hard. It's like we're some sort of couple, every time she throws her warm smile at me or her soft fluffy hair touches my arm. It's torture knowing it isn't while she's just happily talking to me about one of her books. She's acting more friendly than she's ever been in all the years I've known her, and I like that, we're having fun but still." Ron said as he put his head on top of Harry's tabloid.
Harry slowly saw some people coming in the building, whispering to each other and taking their seat. Harry hadn't got a high confidence level so of course, he felt nervous, he wasn't a really good public speaker either. So he was thankful when Hermione decided to speak up.
Harry stared up at Draco's face, his eyes wide and hungry. And Draco could feel his member stir at that. Feel it pumping and pushing against his trouser as it wanted to be let free. That look undid him every time. The way Harry seemed to look at nothing else but him, the way his eyes shone that fierce green color with a black ring staining the outside of his irises. The way they blazed with arousal and need… But even though Draco could feel his cock hardening, see Harry's clear want on the vampire's face, Harry didn't move. His hands staying rested on the couch as he seemed to consider something.
"Can I have a word?" Harry asked Cedric, who was surrounded by his friends.
much. As in, please don't stop now much. He could feel himself shake as he tried to hold back. He didn't want to act too rash, even though all he wanted was to pull Draco into his arms, lift him in the air, bent him over that stupid
"Everyone, this is Loony Love- Hermione started but stopped herself her eyes gone wide. "Luna Lovegood." She corrected herself, and a silence fell.
Because he was practically
"Anyone who isn't one themselves? No one? How disappointing."
"Hmm? Oh yeah, present from my mother. I also got this bracelet from Hermione." Draco said and shoved his wrist in Harry's face. He was thankful that his mother hadn't done the whole exaggerated gift thing, he had been pretty surprised by Hermione though, he hadn't really expected a gift from her. He had been battling with himself about if he should send it or not, and was now happy that he did.
"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great creature, you really are." Hermione assured him.
Thanks for your patience, kudos and reading this story! :)
"Take your hands off of me!" Draco yelled back, he couldn't talk, listen or look at Potter. Especially looking! God, he'd almost fainted again, when the raven-haired boy had shown up beside him at potions! Looking at his fangs glistening out of his mouth and that hair all ruffled as if he'd just woke up, and if Potters' story was to be believed, he had been.
And he knew this wasn't the same as with Cho Chang, even when he had kept saying he was in love with her. That he would do anything to make her happy. To make her smile. That he would worship her forever and that would never change…
"Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward." Hagrid said.
Unable to contain himself anymore, Harry held Draco's head in his hands as he pulled him into a deeper, fiercer and more passionate kiss. His hands working their way around Draco's body, feeling each crevasse, each line along his gorgeous body.
His heat had only been a week but he'd really missed just waking up without being all hot and bothered. Finally being able to relax and stepping out of the room without his clothes constricting him.
"How are you, Katie?" He asked, smiling at her.
"Whatever, come boys," Draco said and walked off to the Slytherin common room with Crabbe and Goyle.
She swallowed, nodding for him to go on. He smiled at her, eyes twinkling that same gold only fiercer...more alive.
Harry watched as slowly some students left the classroom, he smiled when the majority of them gave him a friendly wave as they did so. He then looked down at the small pile he'd formed, giving the desk one last examination before deciding that yes, he had found them all.
"What's that supposed to mean?" Harry said sounding a bit irritated. But she was already standing up.
That surely triggered something as her frozen spell vanished within an instant. "Nothing!" She said, dropping the bottles before snatching the cloth away from him, holding it behind her with a nervous grin. "Really, it's just a-a cleaning towel, yes! Very old, you're right, I should have thrown it out
"Potter!" She yelled, and Harry immediately stopped laughing and walked towards her as she beckoned her finger.
Am tired so don't get much to say except that next update will be a bit late and that I ehm... didn't expect this chapter to be this long, so good news on that!
"One minute!" She yelled back at him. Her voice echoing through the brick walls of the round staircase.
"Why? Because the ministry is little by little trying to control the whole supernatural world, you tosspot." Ron explained a bit exasperated.
"I'm sorry," Harry said.
He looked around the corridor, seeing that the rooms were close to each other as well as the corridor being smaller. He looked around to see numbers on the doors from one to twenty in golden letters. He looked back at the map and saw that the corridor held no name, which was a bit strange, but he supposed it was because it was recently built.
She thought about doing it the day right after the last exam. He would be exhausted any time before that for sure. She didn't want to do it in the morning since he wasn't really clear-headed in the mornings. The evening didn't seem that great either since he would be pondering over it all night for sure. So in the afternoon seemed to be her best option. He would be sober enough and not too drained, so they could have a real conversation. She would probably choose somewhere peaceful and quiet from prying ears, like in the forbidden forest.
late breakfast. He could already see the red sky forming as the sun started to set. And it wasn't even half past four!
'He's gorgeous! And he smells so good!' Harry thought to himself. 'Wait, what? Why would I think a boy is gorgeous?'
Ron's breathing had gone ragged, his mind pushing away everything that wasn't
They shot away from each other instantly, breathing hard and loud as they looked around in panic; startled by the loud explosion. Looking outside they realized it wasn't a bomb that had dropped on top of the castle (thank god), instead, what they saw were flakes of different colors bursting in the air and raining down to the ground, a whistling sound escaping them as they were shot into the air: fireworks.
She always reprimands him whenever he's not studying or curses at him when he's getting into trouble, just like a mother hen…although, now Harry thought about it…a lot of those times she had offered to help, lend him some notes or think of a good excuse.
"Thank you, Holly, you know just what I like for breakfast," Draco said.
"Here master Draco, I've got you some bacon with toast and sausages. And of course your favorite tea." A house-elf named Holly said with confidence. She knew she could only talk to Draco with that kind of confidence, but she would never do it with his father or mother in the same room. She knew master Draco was a kindhearted young man even though he doesn't show it, at least when other people weren't around. Holly meets this kind Draco on rare occasions, such as Christmas.
"I'm saying that you should make a friendship with him." His father responded.
came to a halt and the whistle that indicated people should be getting in was blown, Ron and Ginny walked towards one of the opening doors waving their family goodbye before stepping onto the train. Once inside they both moved to different directions to go find their friends in their usual compartment.
"I said- Argh, forget it I bet it was great. Can't believe it, I was with him for two weeks and I still don't know what to give him! No way you forgot about buying him a present, you don't forget about anything. I even made a checklist so I wouldn't forget anyone! Why did this have to happen to me!" Harry wailed, hands gripping at his hair. Both of his friends looking up at him in surprise as Harry continued to complain about stupid gifts and how hard they were to find.
She whined before slapping her hand over her mouth to stop the sound from leaving her mouth. She blushed as she looked at Draco.
and a dopey smile on his face.
He took a sharp breath when Harry started to suck on his skin, nibbling slightly but not enough to draw blood. Still, Draco was embarrassed by the effect it had on him. Groaning out loud as his toes curled up inside his leather shoes. He was sure he was fully transformed by now, could feel his eyes shining and his teeth lengthening.
Harry bit his lip, putting his weight from one foot to the other before mumbling, "Well, technically it's an
"What?" Harry asked frowning, making her recall all the times Draco had told her the exact same fucking thing the past full moons. Blabbering on and on about their small dates and how he needed to bring enough bacon chips, giggle water and a whole assortment of bloody crunchies.
"I haven't told you," Draco said eventually, making Harry give a cocky smile in return. Clearly pleased to be right for once. But Draco was not at all pleased. He'd freaking forgotten to tell the person he'd just been making out with that he loved him! What must Harry think of him!
"Nothing!" He said brightly but also a bit startled.
He waited for another moment before opening his eyes carefully. He got a little startled as he immediately noticed Harry in front of him with a concerned look on his face, biting his lip a little…oh.
"You're probably right," He eventually said. Waving the jeweler goodbye who gave him a tight smile in return, not quite reaching his eyes.
"You –you're…you bloody seducing…" Harry breathed out, his whole body gone stiff as he searches for the word, making a rumbling sound out of frustration when he couldn't find it.
"I remember every weapon I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the Phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your dagger gave one other feather,
Harry looked at it, his face had gone pale and his eyes wide. But he was not the only one who was watching it.
He had said, gesturing with his finger to his eyes. Nodding to himself he made his way to the bathroom leaving the dumbfounded boy alone.
Not only that though, having spent almost two weeks in close proximity with Harry meant he could understand more of the boy's mental state. He was getting used to the slight change in Harry's cinnamony but at the same time foresty scent. It could turn all smoky, like the forest itself was on fire. At those times Harry tended to be angry at something, or frustrated. It could just smell like the trees, the bark. It had a different smell at sometimes, making the feeling differ from another. When he smelled like this he could get relaxed, satisfied and content, or be sad and full of grief, agitated or anxious. When the cinnamon was overpowering the woodsy scent Harry tended to be excited, happy, pleased, easygoing.
" Harry growled. Only thinking about wanting more, more, more!
"One firewiskey, a small bottle of water and one butterbeer for myself," Harry said, grinning when he handed the drinks to them, "Anything else?"
He was-
Hell! Even his best friend was gaping at him.
She didn't know if he was big, small or average -she didn't have any experience to compare it to. Her textbooks hadn't been very clear on that, with all the different creatures and body shapes that the school consisted of, it was a long,
He smiled as he saw Fawkes grooming his feathers and seated himself before Dumbledore who pulled his chair and sat down himself. Dumbledore lay his hands on the table and stared Harry right in the eye.
"Yes, sir." They said again.
Draco noticed but didn't give up.
And to be honest Draco was a little annoyed by it. it wasn't like he was angry with Harry…he just missed the way Harry acted around him. He had been incredulous after they became friends about how carefree he seemed around him, even when he used to be so wary of Draco before. And he'd been so relieved that Harry acted the same, relaxed way when they became a couple. Doing things almost as if they came to him naturally, touching Draco, flirting with Draco…kissing Draco.
"It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something." Hermione said.
Draco's eyes widened as the book was snatched away from him.
"Now Amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course. That's impossible. But it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. For that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room." Slughorn said, seeing some dreamy faces leaning into the vapors and put the cover back on the cauldron.
Well, maybe not everybody.
"Okay, I'll tell you."
"Save it for the match." He said.
Oh dear god, not again.
'Dear God, I created a monster,' Draco thought, slightly overwhelmed. Watching as Harry's whole demeanor had changed in the blink of an eye. Gone were the confident smirk and blazing eyes, replaced by an adorable pout and puppy dog eyes. It was endearing in a way, even cute. If Draco didn't know better he would have looked into those eyes and be completely captivated by them once again.
And thanks: Gisel, Vkook_is_lifue, Snowflake, Burning Chrome, Mara_Dreger and the person who'd pushed me to finish the story by tonight: paigeymack360!
"Ron it's fine," Harry said, starring at the two goblets before going back to watching Ron. He waited again but Ron just kept rummaging through his bag, as if searching for something. "So, how did it go?" Harry asked, still nervously tapping his foot. Why hadn't Ron said anything yet?!
"That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game." Oliver said.
"Go on."
Oh, how he missed that adorable face that was still covered in slight baby fat, the dorky but still handsome looking glasses, the small hight that never stopped to impress him as it was effortlessly keeping Draco in place.
"Honey, don't try to lie to your mother, I see right through you. Besides I've got Holly as an alibi. Oh! And what about Holly, you won't be able to see her for another Christmass!" His mother cried.
"And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office," Neville said.
When he finally looked at them he noticed their silence.
She leaned back against the cushions, one eyebrow lifted as she nodded, "Then be my guest."
"I just want to look out for you," Harry ignored her comment. "Let me help. Maybe let me interrogate him for a bit, just to make sure he's safe-"
"You do not come from the forest. Your hearts beat like...
? Yep, they would freak out.
She looked down at her lap, and Harry could just see she was caving in.
He stopped a moment, bracing himself as he looked back at the station that was now blurry in the distance. He laughed to himself as he again started running at a lightning fast speed.
"Forget it I'm gonna go for a run," Draco said and walked out of the door, not even bothering asking if they would like to come with him.
He saw Draco staring at the little crying boy in front of him.
, tell each other what has been bothering you, or otherwise, I'm afraid it will destroy your friendship. The bad feelings will only creep up on you and explode if you don't know how to set them loose, to begin with." Neville said, wisely. You could practically give him Dumbledore's beard, and you wouldn't notice the difference. "I'm not a therapist though, so you probably shouldn't take my word into a professionals standpoint's view. Just, trying to help here with the little information I got from you two, still; I'm curious. Have you guys set up a drugs cartel or something?"
"Draco, I swear to God, if you don't get out of this bathroom right now I'm going to break it open," He could hear Harry say and groaned as he put on the final touches. Looking himself over in the mirror he picked up his newest designer watch, giving it a thought before he decided against it and settled for his great-grandfather's instead. It was his lucky one after all.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry felt himself getting frustrated with himself again. 'Stupid Malfoy.'
He needed it! Needed it! Wanted it! Begged for it!
He wetted his lips, his eyes moving from the ground to the ceiling as he stumbled through his words, making Hermione frown and nod her head in reassurance.
"That's not the point. Those weren't outside in a real 'date' environment, without this heavy expectation thrust upon them, without all these things you need to do to impress. They were casual in sweatpants and stuff! We never really called them
Great, now he needed to find the person, find the time -he could be spending more usefully to find the person he
He was in the library, sitting at one of the tables. Trying to read a book while having pity on himself. Potter had been avoiding him all day. Draco had tried stopping him in the halls, classrooms, outside. Now he understood how Potter must have felt the first couple of days. Maybe it was a misunderstanding on his part, but it still made Draco sad. Oh well, he would try again tomorrow.
business could I possibly do?' Harry thought.
"Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel". Hagrid said.
"You know it's not a contest," She told him, matter of factly, "I'm sure Draco will be happy with whatever you give to him, so don't beat yourself up over it,"
It would be the ultimate solution!
"I'll- I'll just leave- I'm sorry," Draco said his voice shaky as he furiously rubbed his eyes and moved to get passed Harry who'd stood up.
"Well, yeah, you could say I'm a vampire," Harry said nonchalantly.
Harry was interrupted by Hermione.
Harry walked over to his closet and opened it. When he picked up a shirt and held it in front of him he realized.
"It's good that you've already destroyed the diary and that I found the ring but we still need to find a way to-
Done!
"No, why would I?" She answered. Both Harry and Ron looked at each other with a wicked gleam in their eyes, before Harry used his vampire speed to travel up to his room to open up his drawer, a vial with a golden shimmering liquid inside of it. When he came back he saw Hermione had started pacing around much like Harry was doing a few minutes earlier while Ron had this excited aura all over him.
Oh God, how was he going to talk himself out of this? He promised Hermione he wouldn't tell
"He's using you." Harry heard Ron say to Hermione.
He was shaken back to reality when he felt a warm touch suddenly grabbing for his hand. He looked up to see Draco grinning at him, slowly calming down his breathing as he gripped on to Harry and lay his outstretched arm on the table.
He couldn't think of Harry. Wouldn't think of Harry. It was hard enough looking him in the eye after a night of pleasuring himself, but after a week of it? He wasn't sure if he ever could look at his new friend again. Besides having to endure knowing that the vampire wouldn't ever want to be with him that way hurt. Knowing he would never get to spend a heat with him…
"Is that all you got?!" Draco yelled again but quickly moved around the tree as he heard Harry's footsteps coming nearer.
Harry couldn't help but snigger at that, he knew Ron's temper wasn't something to be underestimated, though he didn't want to be on the receiving end of one again he would sometimes provoke one out of him. To see how he reacted…which mostly ended up like it had with Elliot.
"No- I mean yes! I'm fine, really. I just got a lot on my mind lately." Harry said, giving Draco a toothy grin that he knew for sure looked ridiculous. 'Great Potter, way to make your crush find you attractive,'
"Fuck, fuck, fuck!" Harry cursed to himself as he ran to platform 9¾, thirty minutes late. As to be expected, the entrance had closed and Harry was fucked. He could have strangled Emma for delaying him, why did she need to come over every day anyway?!
