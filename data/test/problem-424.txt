They stare at each other and then it hits Harry. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry. Are you…” He can’t figure out how to word it. “Are you waiting for… reasons? Religious? Or something? Or are you dating anyone?”
Harry had taken his hand, smiled. “I know that, you idiot. That’s why. Because this matters.” He’d looked suddenly hesitant. “Because you’re important.”
“I don’t want you to feel rushed into anything.” Harry feels compelled to point out, even though the sound of Draco saying words about having sex with him has him very, very, interested. “I mean, would we be doing this if we weren’t here?”
Harry’s wand, then to find the path. He casts the light again, and they resume walking, only this time, they’re side-by-side. This time, they’re holding hands.
Even though Keely lives with them at Grimmauld Place, she’s as tied to the Manor as Draco is, and always comes for the Solstice rituals.
Potter huffs a laugh, completely full of himself. “No need, the satisfaction of getting you out will be more than enough reward.”
Draco takes a deep breath before casting again, still thinking of Theo. In his mind, his hands are weaving too easily through the curls, there’s no bite of his lips, too gentle. He squeezes his eyes harder, telling himself to push, that it’ll work.
On day 24, he began examining  the wand’s design and abilities out of sheer boredom, curious to know the extent of its power and how it would adjust to his magic. When he determined how minimal his knowledge was, Draco sought to absorb the information from the books residing in the library, left untouched for far longer than he deemed acceptable.
“I am not obsessed with Potter! You seem to be the one more invested in this than I am. This match is no big deal. We’ll play, I’ll win, he’ll owe me a favor, and all will end well. There’s no need to have a hissy fit about it.”
“Yes, that’s exactly what I said! But no, instead, these idiots think that because of the tattoo on my arm, I’m capable of mass destruction despite the fact that I couldn't even complete my only mission assigned to me against my will. It should be apparent that I would be inept in this game for the simple fact that I couldn’t execute a
Draco smiles tiredly. “Greg, I’ve never been more thrilled over the idea of steak and kidney pie in my life.”
Hermione clears her throat, sobering up quickly. “Anyway, please don’t allow this to get out of hand. He takes things a bit too far with you.”
However, what truly rattles Draco is the reminder of Potter returning his wand. Potter had arrived at the Manor dressed in his usual ratty muggle attire, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else but at Draco’s doorstep. When Draco got to the door, he thought the Ministry had changed their mind, sending the Savior himself to throw him into Azkaban. Of course they would send precious Potter to have that honor of delivering Draco there himself. But instead, Potter wordlessly held out the hawthorn wand, and when Draco accepted it, he turned away, disappearing down the drive. Draco doesn’t remember how long he stayed there, staring after Potter’s retreating figure, even after he disapparated.
Hermione arches a brow, giving him an incredulous look. “Must you be afraid of someone who’s now dead?”
Draco stares at him for a moment and before he can help it, lets out an irrepressible, almost maniacal laugh. Potter stands there shifting his footing awkwardly, and Draco knows there must be more to it, but he doesn’t think he’ll be able to get it out of him just yet. “You’ve got to be kidding me, you can’t honestly be taking this game seriously? Oh, but of course you are. The Savior can’t go one moment without trying to steal all the glory and stop the Death Eater from his wrongdoings once again. Well, I’ll have you know that you are indeed my target, and you have no chance of beating me,” Draco says with his most pretentious smirk.
” Draco has to hold back a laugh, imagining Potter’s face when he was told this news. He may ask Coach Sylvester to see that pensieve memory for the sake of his entertainment.
Her eyes widen in panic. “No! I— look, I believe it to be best if we’re on… decent terms. But I can’t do that if you still consider me beneath you just because of my blood heritage.”
Draco shuts out the hauntings of no longer distant cries and desperate pleas of mercy before raising his wand arm up to the empty space in front of him. The firm grip on the wand doesn’t waver as he delicately carves a vertical line next to one almost identical to it, eyes narrowed in concentration, with only a silent whisper of the spell formed by his lips. 217. It’s not quite half yet, but he’ll get there. One day at a time, he breathes.
“So, Zacharias is such an idiot. Today I saw him walk through the corridors for several seconds before remembering to put his hat on. All we need to do is wait for him to leave class and shoot him as soon as we catch him without the hat on.”
Pansy gasps dramatically and jinxes Draco’s hat to swivel around his head with a jingle. He sends her an indecent expression as he adjusts his wretched accessory back into place.
“You’re rather quick to assume that I’m planning an evil scheme again. How presumptuous of you, Potter.”
Potter chases him, his loud footsteps close behind as Draco races up the stairs. As soon as Draco reaches the top step, his legs give out on him, and he falls face first on the floor. Jelly-Legs Jinx. Damnit.
That's a bit of an understatement,” Ron scoffs, staring at her with concern in his eyes. “Is he brainwashing you?”
Draco also can’t help but notice Potter—who is sitting a few seats over from Pansy—and the way he squints his eyes as he focuses on the words written on the board. He wonders if Potter’s glasses even work for him anymore; he can tell that he’s been wearing the same pair since he was eleven. Draco may have limited knowledge about eyes and spectacles, but he does know that having the same pair for at least 8 years is much too long for anyone. Even the Chosen One.
His thoughts scramble long enough that he realizes he has missed what else Professor Byron has been telling them. He’s pulled out of his thoughts again at the sound of such a repulsive name.
Potter cuts off his words as he shoves Draco straight into the wall, hands pinning each of his arms beside his head.
Pansy rolls her eyes. “Yes, excellent reason. Well, this will not be my problem. If you lose and decide to pout indefinitely, I will not be there to coddle you. Since Greg believes so highly in you, you will become his problem. Enjoy Greg, and as a tip, the more chocolate you feed him, the less he will whine, though not by much.”
“Yes… I’m going to see how Pansy is doing, I’ll see you later.” Draco says, practically running out of the room.
At his jibe, Potter huffs in frustration and clenches his hands into fists. His green eyes are flaming, lit up with the familiar intensity that sends a rush through Draco’s body. Potter’s eyes are zeroed in on him, and Draco curls his lips into a smirk, relishing in the satisfaction of his reaction.
The anger that floods through him at the sight of this wanker propels him to reveal himself, a devious smirk on his face.
“Wait, but do we get anything if we win?” Blaise shouts from the other side of the room. He, Theo, Greg, and Millie are loitering by the portrait in typical Slytherin fashion; standing closest to the nearest exit in case of the need to flee. In this case, with Coach Sylvester present, Draco deems it warranted. Before the meeting, Pansy insisted the two of them stand there with them as well, but he refused to give up the comfort of the couch.
“Anyway,” she says softly, shaking herself out of her thoughts and looking back at Draco with sadness behind her eyes. “I want to start a Quidditch club that’s separate from the teams where we run drills and teach the kids how to play the game. Those Purebloods get an unfair advantage over the Muggleborns by getting to learn at a young age, so they’re more likely to make the team. Plus, those who don’t make it never get the chance to play. It’ll make the Quidditch jocks less smug.”
He continues his new mantra and sets the wand onto his dresser, rubbing his fingers together absently. The wand he possesses is no longer his own. Upon the end of battle, both his and his mother’s wands were hastily confiscated by Aurors, and they refused to return them after their sentencing. The one rolling back and forth on the mahogany wood of the nightstand was given to him the night he returned to the Manor, which was made to only be able to do simple, everyday spells.
Draco shakes his head fondly, unsurprised Theo managed to cast it so quickly. He’s always been one of those people who can somehow accomplish something on his first attempt. It was something Draco deeply envied about Theo back when they first met, feeling intimidated by how gifted he was. When Draco realized that Theo never sought any attention for his abilities, keeping them mostly to himself, he realized he was no threat. Draco approached him one day, offering his hand, and that was the start of their friendship.
“Such faith you have in me. What a best friend you are,” Draco grumbles. It’s true he hasn’t been able to beat Potter yet, but that doesn’t mean he’s never caught a snitch in a game. He still has a fighting chance if Potter’s skills have gotten rusty with lack of practice. Anything is possible.
“You cannot go for your target in the Great Hall during meals or in any of your classes. If you attempt to do so, you will be disqualified from the game immediately and will receive detention. You may go after your target during free periods or after classes in the common room, dorm rooms, the halls, bathrooms, and anywhere outside the castle. You will also have free reign in the Library, but do so at your own risk, because if you receive a scolding or detention from Madam Pince, this game will not excuse you from it.”
The lack of response from Blaise unnerves him, but he’s cut off from the thought when Pansy continues their conversation. “I still think you’re being foolish. This is so terribly Gryffindor of you, Draco. Who even are you? Soon you’ll be galavanting off riding Dragons and fighting dark lords with Potter and his pals.”
The round frames also happen to obstruct his wide, blazing green eyes, which never fail to send a chill down his spine upon meeting his gaze. He thinks it's the reason he always sought to agitate him so much in their early Hogwarts days. It’s the one way to get a close view of the piercing stare that ignites every part of his body. A burn that practically swallows him whole.
Draco muffles a chuckle into his tea cup, amused at the image. Perhaps he should make that a reality. He knows Greg and Blaise would be on board, maybe even Pansy if he nags her enough. “Yes, he’s quite the celebrity now after killing the most powerful dark wizard of all time, twice. And he did it with only a disarming charm, nothing quite extravagant to warrant that amount of attention but...”
Potter looks comically gobsmacked. “Do you not hear yourself? Maybe you should come along with me and have Madam Pomphry check your ears.
“Sorry Pans,” he cuts her off before squirting her square on the chest. She lets out a startled gasp as she stares down at the droplets of water seeping into her shirt, which is rapidly becoming see-through. A second after, she lunges toward Draco and tackles him onto the sofa.
It infuriates him that Potter thinks he’s so much better than everyone else. That he just allows people to throw themselves at his feet and praise him, feeding his already massive ego.
After the encounter with Potter in the corridor, Draco can feel Potter’s eyes following him constantly as if he’s going to strike at any minute. He feels trapped, a part of him almost wishing for Azkaban only to escape Potter’s scrutiny.
After a moment, she grabs the hat from her head and tosses it to the floor, “Finally, I can take this stupid hat off. It bothers my ears.”
Draco stalks towards the door and pulls it open to reveal Reina, looking up at him with her usual exuberance. “Hi Coach Malfoy, or would it be Draco? Anyway, Coach Sylvester wanted me to give you this!” She pulls a piece of folded parchment out of her bag and holds it out in front of her.
Draco nods slowly, taking a sip of his tea to calm his nerves. “Well, The D— V-Voldemort,” he chokes out with a shiver crawling through him, “was a powerful wizard who advocated for Pureblood supremacy and sought to take Wizards out of hiding. He wanted to destroy Muggle-borns and overtake the Muggles. It was a pretty far-fetched goal if you ask me.”
“Well yes,” Draco huffs, “I’m just using it right now as a reference. But don’t say it in public, especially in front of Gryffindors.”
He has laughed bitterly at the possibility of it being a ferret, which in reality, would make him curse Barty Crouch Jr. for the rest of his life.
Pansy and Blaise laugh, and Draco turns to meet Theo’s eyes, an intense and unreadable expression on his face. Draco decides to ignore him.
“Oh, don’t get your knickers in a twist, I made sure to punch your left one. I know how important your right one is for those lonely nights when Hermione is not in the mood—”
Pansy stares at him for a second, startled, and then breathes out while shaking her head dismissively, “Oh, nevermind.
Hermione doesn't say anything for a moment, giving him a heavy look. “Well, he just wants to win, so I don’t see that being the motive,” she says.
Hermione opens and closes her mouth a couple times before stammering, “Well, do you still… believe in—”
Draco bursts into the common room, startling those near the portrait. He spots Pansy sitting in an armchair beside the fire across from Blaise, laughter echoing, without her hat on. She turns to look at him as he approaches, lighting up at the sight of him.
Pansy gasped and burst into giggles, “Draco! That’s different. PP is naughty,” she laughs again at the mention of the word, then lights up, “What about DD?”
It took a few minutes of arguing for Ron to finally relent, eventually recognizing that Ginny wasn’t willing to budge on this.
Draco knows he still needs to apologize to Granger, and now would be the perfect opportunity to do so. He would rather do anything than return to his table right now. But he’s unable to tame his mind, losing the reins as it spirals outward. Granger’s gut-wrenching screams echo in his mind, a sound that has been permanently seared into his memory. She would never forgive him, how could she? Not when he was associated with the person who did that to her.
As soon as they take their seats at the eighth year table placed at the front of the hall, he tucks into an omelet with vigor. Pansy shakes her head, laughing softly from across the table before placing some eggs and toast onto her plate. After a minute or two of silence, Pansy looks up past Draco with a startled look.
Hermione scoffs, mock offended. “Hey, don’t forget that he’s still my best friend,” she says, her lip curling up playfully.
“Oh, it’s fine Draco, save your dramatics,” Blaise says airily. “I don’t need your attention anyway, I have many other admirers who fawn over me. And you have Pansy to give you attention.”
As soon as Flitwick dismisses them, reminding them to practice the ascendio charm before next class, Draco throws on his hat and follows Pansy out the door, still glaring at her with utter disdain.
Hi guys!! It’s been a while, I know. I started school last month so I haven’t had much time to edit or write because of homework (boo), but yay new update!! I hope you guys like this chapter and let me know what you think in the comments, they’re amazing and very helpful! Thank you to
The following day, Draco swiftly exits the classroom, wanting to get as far away from Potter as possible. The audacity of him to humiliate Draco in front of everyone, and not even have the decency to feel remotely remorseful.
As he passes the table containing the irritating trio, he catches part of their conversation, which is not transpiring even remotely quietly.
“Anyway,” she says casually, as if she didn’t just threaten to hurt several students a moment ago, “I appreciate your candidness. I hate feeling left out of everything that happened. It’s like when two of your friends share an inside joke in front of you but don’t bother explaining it to you. ‘You just had to be there.’ Makes my blood boil.”
“Really?” He asks, gobsmacked. He figured she invited him here to tell him she’d be replacing him with Potter.
Hermione flushes, avoiding Ginny’s smug look. She thinks it's best she leaves now before this conversation escalates. “Um, I’m going to head to the library, I’ll see you two in class. Bye Ginny,” she says, giving Ron a quick peck before dashing out of the Great Hall.
Draco huffs “Of course I didn’t” he grumbles quietly. They both walk the rest of the way to the common room in companionable silence.
“Just that he tried to take over the Wizarding World and that little Potter boy somehow managed to completely surmount him. I don’t see how that’s likely considering how scrawny he is, but I’ve learned over the years that anything is possible.”
As they almost reach him, each of them with their arms stretched out, he moves his arm up at the last minute. Without hesitation, the small Hufflepuff girl moves her hand and snatches the snitch out of his hand, raising it up victoriously as she flies past him. The rest of them follow after her huffing slightly, but still showing their support for her nonetheless.
“None of that now,” Pansy dismisses, wacking her hand carelessly against his chest, “We have important business to discuss in just a minute, if you have managed to forget about.”
“Harry! Why did you make that bet with him? You know how easily he gets riled up by you!” She says, taking a seat across from him. He doesn’t bother pointing it out.
Ginerva falters slightly, but schools her features into a scowl. “Shove off,” she says before flying over to the nosy prat.
Later that night, while staying at Gryffindor tower, she had kissed him, pouring a whole year of separation into it, clinging to him like she never wanted to lose him again. But it didn't feel quite the same as it once did. There was no excitement, no invigoration pumping through his veins like he remembered.
The night of Dumbledore’s death, when Malfoy brought in the other Death Eaters, appears the most in his nightmares. His guilt still eats away at him, no matter how many times he has been reassured that none of it was his fault. Nothing anyone says will change what happened, and he’s reminded of it almost every night. The fear etched onto Malfoy’s face, Dumbledore’s calm acceptance of death. They’ve been seared into Harry’s mind.
Suddenly, Millie appears at the door, holding her gun out in front of her, which almost startles him off the bed. She puts it away once she examines the situation, “Don’t worry, I handled it. They should all leave you alone now.”
“Interesting…” Draco trails off, feeling a bit suspicious. From Blaise’s current behavior, Draco has a feeling this most likely won't mean anything good.
As he stands in front of the door, he questions if he should run straight back to the safety of his dorm, but the door swings open before he can decide that.
, he supposes. Draco has never seen Potter so sure of himself, with confidence radiating from him so exceedingly that it could have knocked Draco over. He hopes this doesn’t last, because it’s utterly infuriating. Nevertheless, this strengthens his resolve to beat Potter in the assassin game; Draco is dead set on being the person who finally wipes that smug look off his face.
Potter doesn’t move for several moments, trapping Draco in an unwavering, calculating stare. Draco refuses to be the first to look away, but truthfully, he couldn’t if he wanted to. Potter’s eyes are devastatingly enchanting.
“Of course she is, our darling Millie. If it weren’t for you, the ladies would never leave me alone. Your services are ever so appreciated,” Blaise gushes, batting his eyelashes.
As they gawp at her and the other eighth years stifle their laughs, she continues, her face unimpressed.
Potter shakes his head, “No, that’s not what I’m saying. You’ve done some horrible things, yeah, but I know that you were coerced into most of that. Voldemort threatened you, just like the rest of us. I don’t think you’re free of guilt from your actions, but you don’t deserve to rot away in a place like that.”
Draco’s eyes dart up from his book, thoroughly startled by the sudden voice. No one ever approaches his table, no less Hermione Granger who looks much too intense for him to handle at the moment. He was in the middle of reading Charms textbook in hopes of finishing his essay due tomorrow, but he can tell from her acute expression that that will not be the case.
At that moment, Theo appears from the door to their shared bathroom. He frowns in confusion at the sight of Pansy, “What’s the matter Pans? Did you lose an earring?” He asks innocently.
“Still can’t bloody believe Coach Sylvester picked Malfoy of all people to help with the Quidditch Club. When Ginny told me, I almost dropped my chicken. And I never drop my food,” Ron says, piling sausages onto his plate with vigor.
Draco huffs. “Just leave me alone. Is that too much to ask?” He asks, a bit of desperation unwillingly seeping through his words.
A crooked smile broadens Potter’s face, and Draco absolutely can’t stand the sight of him standing there, looking so gratified in Draco’s mortification. “I’d hope it’s not.”
Coach Sylvester ignores her and faces Draco, “I underestimated you Draco, I like your style. Don’t tell anyone I said this, but you remind me of a young, ambitious Sue Sylvester who stepped over everyone in her path in order to climb to the top. Keep it up,” She says proudly, “Now, I have to go corral a bunch of bratty first year Piffindorps or whatever their house is called and make sure none of them fall off their brooms.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “Your flattery is ever so appreciated, however, with what my family has had to donate to the Ministry as reparations for our… previous engagements, I don’t believe that most offered amounts would fail to surpass the current value of our vault.” He clears his throat, keen to change the point of conversation. “Well, don’t keep us in suspense. What is it you’re so desperate to share?”
Greg, being an even less fan of the mornings than Draco, needed to be woken up by him every morning. If Draco didn't go in there and spray him with Aguamenti or a similar charm, he most likely would never make it to his first class of the day. During their earlier years at Hogwarts, Blaise always handled it as the only morning person, but he refused to this year, claiming, “Draco, I no longer live with him, and it’s time for you to assume the responsibility of dragging the lug out of bed. It’ll help you grow up a bit.” He reluctantly agreed, but it turns out it hasn’t been too much trouble for Draco. In fact, he takes slight pleasure in his creative tactics to wake Greg from his deep slumber.
Theo stands up. “You need a perfect memory, one that is so overwhelmingly happy that you feel no sadness.”
The concern on Potter’s face morphs into indignation, his brows furrowed. “Don’t act like you’re the victim, Malfoy, you’re not the only person suffering from the war. At least you were given the opportunity to come back to Hogwarts, after everything.”
Draco belatedly swats her arm and shoves lightly at her shoulder, “I don’t know how I put up with you.”
Draco’s hand shakes as he wills himself to pull the lever of the faucet. He can’t budge, lacking the strength to face the demons scratching through the walls of his mind.
“I see. Well, everyone seems to be tight-lipped about the pandemonium he caused, and I was hoping you wouldn’t be. I can’t handle talking to a bunch of wusses.”
Draco starts at the reminder of the trials. Most of it was a blur; he was not in the ideal state after staying in the Ministry holding cells for a month. However, seeing Potter speak in defense of Draco and his mother was truly a sight to behold. Never in his life did he expect Potter to save him from punishment. Draco would have felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude if he didn’t already have numerous other debts he owed Potter. Of course, his mother had been ever so appreciative of it, going on and on about how much of a “good young man” he is. She mentioned it continuously for the entire summer to Draco’s dismay. He can’t recall there being a single day in which he hadn’t heard the name “Potter.”
” she huffs, “a game that Harry has already begun to obsessively plan for by strategizing with Ron all day about how best to go about playing this match against you.”
Harry doesn't know why he feels this way; there could be several reasons. Maybe the war caused them to grow apart, becoming different people than they once were. Maybe it’s too soon for him to continue dating again, and he can’t process his emotions at the moment. In his darker moments, he also wonders if maybe the fatal spell had also killed a part of him, the part that could love.
“Well, then I’m glad you showed up when you did,” Pansy says in relief, still looking quite shaken by the encounter.
“What do you think your patronus form will be?” Pansy asks casually, looping her arm through his own. He knows she’s trying to distract him. This is her usual method when he’s distressed about something, and part of him is grateful.
He knows that ideally, he needs someone who will save him, pull him out of the water, but what Draco truly desires, involuntarily, is someone who will fall right in with him without hesitation.
The next week, Draco is sitting at his desk in Defense, waiting endlessly for the class to end when he’s pulled out of his daydream by the last words he ever wanted his Professor to utter. His fantasy of stomping on Potter’s face a second time fades away as he darts his eyes to Professor Byron, frightened.
He throws open the door, storming out of the classroom before he can hear Potter’s response. A few moments later Pansy runs to catch up to him in the corridor.
Draco nods awkwardly, taking a long sip of his drink. He still doesn’t see how his presence in her living space at this hour is necessary.
“Potter, tell me why you’re stalking me. Again, I should add. I’m quite familiar with this behavior.”
Ron turns to Harry desperately, “It’s only the second week and we’ve already lost her to her books. Harry we need to do something! It’s been over a week since her and I—”
She scrunches her face in frustration. “I’m giving Blaise an earful later,” she says, pulling her hands back. “But do you want me to help you with your hair? I know a few grooming spells...”
“Are you out of your mind? Set me down!” Draco demands, kicking his legs and hitting Potter’s arms in protest—which are much more firm than he expected.
After a minute, he had carefully pushed her away, claiming he needed to rest. She simply nodded and walked out to find her family and go back home.
“So, you say the Slytherins have been getting harassed by those Gryffindors? Have you been experiencing this yourself?”
“But he’s fine, he’s not really here for those anyway is he? Doesn’t he already have a shiny new job waiting for him at the Ministry? I’m sure they're all shaking with anticipation at the Savior’s upcoming arrival.”
“He made it with me, mind you, not the other way around. And what can I say? Potter brings that part out of me. I can’t resist the opportunity to show him up,” he says, not daring to look up from his book.
As he gets to his feet, about to storm into the bathroom and give Blaise the bat-bogey of his life, a quiet, hesitant knock at his door halts his movements. He noticed the knock was much lower on the door than it would be for your average eighth year student, besides perhaps Finnigan, though Draco knows he would never be so polite.
Millie growls and runs straight into the door, which almost startles him away. As she continues using her body to break down the door, he hears a loud, barking laugh from the other side.
Draco doesn’t know what to say, and he is not in much of a mood to focus on Transfiguration anymore. He thinks quickly of what to do, how to fix this. He’s fucked up badly, he knows it. But he can’t stand the thought of Theo hating him. Draco’s breathing starts to become difficult, and he grips his hands tightly.
“All I know is, I can’t wait for that ferret to embarrass himself in front of the whole school, it’ll be bloody brilliant,” Ron says.
Hermione rolls her eyes, her lips curved upwards. “Are you going to ask him to help you? Or will I need to for you?”
Meanwhile, Granger looks quite relieved, although Draco can tell she is just as startled as he is. He looks down and sees the book is still on the ground. Granger—still frozen in shock—has not yet processed that it has fallen, and without thinking, he approaches her table.
Somehow, he manages to avoid their badgering questions the next morning as well by speaking as if he doesn’t hear them. They gave up once they reached the Great Hall and Draco droned on about his hatred toward Herbology. Theo never attempted to join in on their insistent chattering, which Draco greatly appreciated.
“Look away, you perverted leprechaun. You see enough of those in your hidden pensieve memory of Madam Rosemerta’s breasts.”
Madam Pince scowls at the pair, peering over her book. Her expression sends a shiver down Draco’s spine.
Coach Sylvester stays silent for a moment, considering, before letting out an amused laugh. “Well, that would explain the hordes of girls who follow him around through the corridors like a gaggle of geese.”
“Because… it’s Malfoy. When has he ever done anything with good intentions? What if he’s trying to improve his reputation? He’s a Slytherin, so of course he’s going to try clawing his way back up, and next thing you know he’ll be a Ministry aristocrat like his father bossing everyone around like when he was—”
Hermione groans, releasing seven years worth of frustration out of her system. “Oh, don’t get me started, we’ll be here all night! Anyhow, this is getting out of hand! If I had a galleon for every time he mentioned you…”
So at the mention of this idea, Ron was completely against it and thought Ginny was being completely unreasonable.
“He did? Did he tell you anything else?” Harry asks, leaning forward avidly with that glint in his eye he only ever gets when they’re on the topic of Draco.
Draco snaps his head up, gazing at Pansy sharply. “Pansy, you have a free as well, yes? I could help you with Potions too as we both know you struggle with it.”
“Yes, I did and I have to say it was quite impressive. But Malfoy here was not your assassin, it was Pansy, and there’s no rule against another person in the game hexing you. So go cry to your
“There’s no need. Neither you nor Greg are equipped to attack me at this hour, and I already know Theo doesn’t have me. Even if he did, he doesn’t sound too eager to participate in this game.”
This seems to shake Potter back to reality, because he releases his arms. “Sorry,” he says, taking a step back, the ghost of his touch still wrapped around him. Draco is finally able to regain his breathing.
“So, now you’re probably wondering why you’re here, and I’m gonna tell you,” She says, her intense gaze locked on his. She pauses for a moment before continuing. “I want you to help me run it.”
Draco flinches at the reminder of that incident—he’ll never admit it to anyone, but he recognizes now that he may have overreacted to the Hippogriff attack just a tad.
“But I don’t have any…” Pansy slowly reaches into her shirt where she pulls out a small piece of parchment, which Draco assumes was stuck in her bra. She unfolds it and lets out a loud gasp, dropping it like it burned her.
“I have been thinking about this for a long time. You do not have to decide right now, dear, but I just want to let you know in case you decide it is the right decision. I trust your judgement,” She closes her eyes for a moment before reaching out to grasp Draco’s hand. His mother carefully places the object into his palm and wraps his fingers around it. As she drops her arms, Draco is gathering the courage to look down at his hand.
Coach Sylvester stares at them unimpressed, but otherwise disregards them. “Well, that’s his problem to deal with,” she says, disdainful.
Draco turns around to see Justin Finch-Fletchley with a sour expression and notices a smug looking Finnigan following suit, “And why does Finnigan look like he got his wand polished by someone besides his own hand for the first time?” Draco questions.
“It’s alright mate, no pressure, I was just wondering. I think you two really made each other happy.”
“No, I’m just being logical. Draco is more than qualified to be a Coach,” Hermione says. She doesn’t know too much about Quidditch—to Ron’s disappointment—but from what she’s seen, Draco didn’t appear to be that much worse than Harry. His skills most likely didn’t come as naturally to him as much as Harry, but that shouldn’t be discounted.
“You will not be getting this back until tomorrow!” Madam Pince declares, holding up the water gun. “Now, off with you!” She dismisses with a huff, stomping back to her desk.
Potter huffs a humorless laugh. “I know you weren’t the one who did it. I don’t think you’d be able to get around McGonagall’s spellwork.”
He watches Potter and Weasley waltz into the Great Hall in true, unbashing Gryffindor fashion, chatting animatedly about Merlin knows what. They’re still wearing those obnoxious hats, the bell on top springing with each step.
“Yes, Potter, perhaps you should pay Madam Pomfrey a visit to have your head checked, because it seems you’ve forgotten that Draco is in fact my name,” Draco cuts in, sneering. He wants to redirect the subject of this conversation as fast as possible before Potter reminds Granger—
“Dracula? Ah yes, I like that one. Coach Sylvester is a genius for coming up with that,” Blaise says reverently.
“Oh how grand! Yes, allow me to kiss your feet, and shine your shoes while I’m down there. Thank you for giving me another chance, Oh Savior! I shall repent for my actions until death consumes me,” Draco declares mockingly, with dramatic gestures in his direction. “Yes, Potter, I may be much more subdued this year, and I congratulate you for using your observation skills that seem rather underdeveloped. But, I refuse to grovel and beg for forgiveness. If one thing still remains in my life, it is my dignity. So leave me the fuck alone, Potter, because you don’t understand—”
Harry laughs at the image of Malfoy startling the poor healer while Hermione glances up from her book, looking unimpressed at the joke. Harry quickly sobers and clears his throat, “There’s got to be a reason. Why is he being so defensive?”
Draco holds her gaze for a few seconds. “I don’t. But I don't think I’m ready to consort with Muggles yet either. This is a lot for me, you know.”
- While walking to the kitchens, Theo proposes that Draco goes with him to France after the school year, and to Draco’s surprise, gives him a kiss on the cheek
A faint, glow appears at the tip of his wand. He hasn’t been able to ever produce more than that, even while in the best mood.
“Yeah, I do.” Greg stares down at his bed, fumbling with the hem of his shirt for a moment, before finally speaking. “I mean, but Hermione was born to muggles right? I don't think she's gross...”
“Well, once I get involved, no one will even look your way without fear of meeting my wrath. They’ll wet their pants just at the thought.”
Draco turns towards the direction he came from to see Coach Sylvester chasing after him, holding two much larger versions of the muggle weapons the eighth years have been provided with in her hands.
“That you’re dropping out of school to become an escort?” Pansy quips, her voice losing the bite it normally has.
Draco breathes, he knows he has to at least try. He doesn’t want to grow old and regret that he never attempted to apologize for his mistakes.
Theo watches the light as it fades out, his expression falling slightly before he covers it with a smile. “Good, it didn’t get worse at least. I think if you practice more you should be just fine for the evaluation. There’s still plenty of time.”
Patil and Finnigan both nod meekly, looking like they’d prefer to be having a cup of tea with Draco’s Aunt Bella right now.
Pansy opens her mouth to respond but is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Blaise, which startles her. Oddly, her cheeks flush, and she ducks her head slightly.
“Yes! That’s how he was able to get them out so quickly… amongst other things,” she says, her tone indecipherable at the last part.
Of course, that's when he spots Potter sitting on the stands, staring straight at him with a look of bitter judgement. Draco sends him a crude expression that would most likely disappoint his mother before addressing the group.
Draco turns over in bed, facing away from her, “Nothing Pan Pan, I’m alright. Just not feeling well.”
“Don’t forget Pansy’s secret stash of dark chocolate digestives,” Draco calls, “I’d like to keep my eyebrows!”
“Slimy Slytherins,” A ravenclaw boy spits, knocking his shoulder into Pansy’s with such force she falls against Blaise’s side with a squeal. He immediately catches her, places his arm around her shoulder protectively. In an instant, the three boys whip out their wands, pointing them at the perpetrator. This immediately startles the boy, causing his bravado to falter.
,” Potter stresses, stepping into his space, “I’m not a savior, the war is over, I’m tired of talking about that—”
“He should be revising for his NEWTs! Not spending all his time plotting to eliminate you. He won’t stop talking about the game now. He’s so focused on getting you out that he hasn’t been eating, and Ron swears he sees Harry with his light on for hours in bed. You have to call this off, because he won’t listen to me. I’ve already tried.”
A small group approaches Draco reluctantly, all of them avoiding his gaze. He tries his best to keep a pleasant expression, but he knows it’s futile. If anything, a smile from a former Death Eater would only be more terrifying to them.
Pausing for a moment, he takes in the largely increasing number. 147, he counts. He stares for a second longer to absorb the detailed petals of the gold and scarlet hollyhocks that grace the surface before adding a new addition to the collection. Even the designs of his room took part in the molding of his whole identity; the flower representing ambition. If Draco had any ounce of that trait within him to begin with, nothing remains now.
“Draco, trust me. You’ll want to know now stop being difficult!” Pansy exclaims before leaning in close to whisper, “I have Zacharias Smith.”
He’s been standing in the middle of his dormitory for over an hour, casting this incantation repeatedly, remaining unsuccessful.
Draco runs straight to his room, avoiding any calls from Pansy and Blaise as he passes them in the common room. He’s in no mood to speak with anyone, seeking to brood over Potter in peace. No one would say anything that would make him feel better anyway.
The players all scramble to fly away, and Draco notices how fast they all move on their brooms. He’s quite impressed. Draco waits eagerly as they all loop around the pitch, heading back in his direction. He smirks, gripping his broom tightly as he dashes away from them. He hears their protests, which makes him smile brighter. Draco zooms past Wood who gives him an odd look, and heads towards the trees.
Draco squeezes his eyes shut, pleading with his mind not to provide the visual once again, as it does almost every night without fail. It creeps up on him, like shadows from the afternoon light, as he stares at the canopy above, or from the sound of running water, the water that streamed down as he lay, a pool surrounding him with the flowing of crimson.
A gentle knock breaks Draco out of his reverie, and he turns to see his mother standing at the doorway, her eyes filled with an abiding sadness that has rarely left her face since the day of the trial. Her lavender, silky night gown is as pristine as ever, as she refuses to lose her elegance even behind closed doors—out of principle.
“Theo, I can’t,” Draco says sadly. He could never leave his parents behind. Or Pansy for that matter. He couldn't live with himself if he did
“Oh ok.” Greg looks away thoughtfully, clearly considering something that he’s reluctant to speak about.
Draco nods, unsure of what else to say on the matter. It’s not like changing your beliefs is as simple as waving a wand. He just doesn’t… know. It’s all very overwhelming.
Harry looks away. “I know,” he says quietly. Malfoy explained everything that occurred in Malfoy Manor when Voldemort first moved in. It was disturbing, and despite the horrors Harry went through himself, he shivers at the thought of having to stay in the same house of emotionally unstable maniacs for any period of time. Harry doesn’t think anyone deserved to go through something like that, even Malfoy.
Draco closes his mouth, scowling pointedly at Pansy, communicating that they will discuss this later. He turns to Greg with a reassuring smile. “Yes, of course.”
“Thank you, Malfoy. And... just call me Hermione, if you would. I think we’re past the frivolity of surnames at this point, don't you agree?”
Eventually, once Pansy regains control of her breathing and wipes the tears away, they make their way back to the eighth-year common room. Upon entering through the portrait, they receive a mix of death glares from the Hufflepuffs and conflicted, suspicious expressions from the other houses; most likely due to the fact that everyone thinks Smith is an insufferable git.
The three hours Draco has had to endure before meeting up with Pansy in his dorm have been nothing short of torture. Draco excels at many things, but patience is not one of them. As someone who was once spoiled with anything a child could ever ask for, and given things the instant he demanded, those skills never quite developed in him.
It’s pointless, Draco knows. He’s been practicing this spell for weeks—even before it was assigned in class. He hardly has any good memories to choose from and he’s never been particularly proficient at Defense. The only reason he passed with high marks in the past years was due to the many incompetent teachers he had. Only Lupin was actually adept at teaching the material, so he actually learned a lot that year. In fifth year, he was fortunate to be one of Umbridge’s favorite students, so he had no difficulties in that class. Unbeknownst to anyone who was not in the Inquisitorial Squad, Draco loathed the rotten woman as much as everyone else in that school. But at the time, he couldn’t resist having some power—as well as lording something over Potter—for once. Perhaps he took things a bit far, but it’s too late to change anything now.
“Hello Blaise, that’s because you scream every time one of the cards snap and halfway through the game you’ll get distracted by something else, or someone else.”
“Actually, no, I don’t care to know. I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear you,” Draco says, staring ahead into the dancing flames as a distraction. He winces as the fire crackles, but forces himself to concentrate on it, telling himself that it’s not a threat.
Draco’s mind whirls, the new information setting him off balance like a storm sending a boat off course. Draco isn’t sure if he’s understanding her correctly, as it’s impossible for her as a Quidditch Coach to be a Squib. Though he thinks back, and he doesn’t recall ever seeing her using magic, or even welding a wand. It would explain why she makes tea by hand.
“There will be a piece of parchment posted on the wall with all your names and it will update itself when someone is eliminated from the game. When a person is out, their name will be crossed out.”
Hermione rolls her eyes at him, as if he’s the slow one. “Forget it. How much have you been practicing?”
Potter quirks a brow. “Malfoy, you were getting groped by Smith just a few minutes ago. If I hadn't been here, he would’ve...” Potter trails off, unable to finish the sentence. Draco shutters at what could have been, but he sets those thoughts aside.
Draco narrows his eyes, not allowing her to shake him. “What proof do you have?” He asks, just to be contrary.
Draco doesn’t know what possesses him to do so, but he reaches up and flicks Potter’s scar, most of which is somehow unobscured by the monstrous hat on his head. Of course Potter can’t manage to wear a hat correctly. Draco should expect nothing less from him, but Potter somehow manages to reach new levels of stupid every day.
He looks around the pitch and sees that all the players have gone to their groups. Draco looks at the students standing a safe distance away from him and counts 5 in his group. All of them look younger than fourth years, with bright, eager eyes despite looking a bit timid. There are two Gryffindors—a boy and a girl, an eager looking Hufflepuff girl, and two Ravenclaws. He’s shocked by the lack of Slytherins. He remembers in first year when most of the Slytherins a couple years above him all tried out for Seeker, wanting the position with the most power. Perhaps they deem this club below them, as most have already learned to play at home. Draco knows he would feel the same way.
Pansy simply rolls her eyes, as she tends to do rather than argue with Draco in the mornings. She knows there’s no point to it; it’s a futile effort. Blaise laughs as he leans in front of Draco to reach for the porridge, which Draco hands to him because he seems to be the only person not determined to irritate him this morning.
Draco can hear Theo’s heavy sigh, slightly muffled by the door. “I can still enter through my own room, you know. I was just trying to be polite.”
On top of the motivation for Pansy, now he has an extra motive of staying in the game just to spite Potter and his pet Weasel. He doesn't mind it one bit.
“See this little orange lever here?” He points, looking up at Greg to see if he’s watching. At Greg’s slow nod he continues, “I have brilliantly discovered that if you pull back on it, it releases water. Don’t worry, you can do it too. Look, it’s like this,” He explains and aims at Pansy’s face, the water hitting her on her forehead.
Pansy shakes his shoulder to reclaim his attention, most likely aware of what he’s doing. He turns to her, shifting his mind back to reality, and almost laughs at the faux annoyance on her face.
Draco scowls but Theo goes on. “Any from your childhood? Getting your first broom? Winning a quidditch match? A favorite birthday.”
“Ok, first order of business, I gathered some new information for you after you left breakfast this morning.”
Draco stands with Pansy in the corridor on Friday afternoon, waiting anxiously, and each second that passes causes his heart to pound harder in his chest. They’re hidden behind an alcove, out of sight, watching the trapdoor leading to the Divination classroom. Pansy keeps a firm grip on Draco’s shoulder, whether to ground him or reassure herself, Draco doesn’t know.
“What’s in the letter, Draco?” Blaise asks, reprising his place against the doorframe of the bathroom.
Draco doesn’t actually know if Finnigan has that in his wank bank. At least, he didn’t until now. He only heard from Blaise that he has the same, which Draco personally finds quite disturbing.
Draco rolls his eyes, accepting that his afternoon has been officially compromised and there is no hope of getting any revision done now, “Always the hero aren’t you, Potter? Here to stop the wretched Death Eater from his nefarious crimes.”
“At least I don't have to wear that awful hat anymore,” She says with a flourish, chucking the hat off, landing on the bed with a jingle.
Coach Sylvester turns to him with a pleased smile. “Well, I don’t usually like to say this, I prefer not to brag,” she starts with a smug smile that tells Draco she tends to do the opposite, “but I’m espoused to the world famous Quodpot player, Duke Puffstenburg. We’re currently long distance. His brother is the founder of Puffstenburg Broom Company, and he was willing to make me my own personal broom.”
As Draco sits on the edge of his bed, leaning over his knees, Theo knocks gently on the door, which Draco wants more than anything to ignore. But then Theo begins to speak, saying he has Draco’s bag that he left behind.
“Yes, that’s correct. So it’s exactly why I know who her target is and you don’t,” Draco smirks. Blaise flashes him scowl, which draws a laugh out of him.
The portrait opens again to reveal Millie who’s repeatedly clenching her fist. She sits on the floor next to Greg.
Harry Potter, the most famous orphan of the wizarding world, may have lost the chance of experiencing unconditional love from his parents, but he will never understand the pain of bearing the knowledge that you have caused your own mother such deep, unresolved sorrow.
Draco bristles at the threat, realizing Pansy may have been right about needing to avoid Slytherin tactics in this game. But in his defense, it's practically second nature for him to resort to those techniques; It’s hard to break such a habit.
One hot, scorching day when they were eight, they were eating ice cream in the grassy field behind Malfoy Manor. Pansy turned to him, mouth full of vanilla, chocolate swirl, and said, “Draco, you’re my best friend.”
“Well, Monroe, I believe that is an unfair assessment. We only got to play three matches out of the six we were supposed to, so we truly don’t have the most accurate information to determine the better seeker. We also haven’t played against each other in three years, so he could have greatly regressed in his skills,” Draco explains. “Besides, being a good player does not guarantee being a competent coach.”
“I saw you and that other Slytherin scum, Nott, having a little moment in front of the kitchens. So pathetic. He wouldn’t be nearly as good as me and you know it.”
He ignores Pansy’s calls for him, and assumes that Millie held her back from following him. Draco’s just not in the mood for her pestering reassurances. He walks down the corridor, his mind racing to think of a place that would be most suited to his need for the world’s absence. A place full of peace and quiet. A small pocket of this castle where he can forget his overbearing guilt and self hatred for a while. He once had a place to himself here, a place open and wide, high enough to mute the noise, the quiet ambiance broken only by the flaps of owl wings and murmurs of the Forbidden Forest.
As Draco is pulling his nightclothes out of his wardrobe, ready to call it an early night, the door of his room is spelled open, slamming against the wall with a loud clatter.
“Well, my whole life my father preached about how much better purebloods are than Mud—Muggle-borns. Of course, I believed him, because why would I think otherwise? They didn’t have two magical parents, so in theory, it makes sense for their magic to be less powerful than a Pureblood’s. I looked at my father as my idol, my ideal role model, so anything he said was fact in my mind. But then you see…. Voldemort wasn’t even a pureblood himself, and our entire side was essentially wiped out by half-bloods and muggleborns. So really, it’s hard to see how it makes much of a difference anymore, whether or not we really are superior.”
Draco hides the shock that courses through him and curls his lip nastily, “You realize the Great Hall is off limits from the game? Unless someone casted a permanent sticking charm on them, in which case please inform me of who, so I can thank them,” Draco taunts.
The three of them make their way to Draco’s room due to its proximity and they lay on his bed, the boys on either side of Pansy. She curls into Blaise, releasing her pent up tears on his shirt, and Draco strokes her back soothingly.
“It’s Reina Sullivan!” the young voice answers back, but Draco suspects this may be a scheme of Millie’s doing.
“But you cheated! McGonagall said you can’t attack your target, that the magic prevents that!” Weasley shouts.
“No, I haven’t,” Draco pauses, considering, “I suppose I should probably apologize to Granger, though.”
“Hello my darlings, have you heard the news yet?” Blaise cuts in, slinging an arm around Draco’s shoulders.
Draco ignores the quip and quickly finishes combing his hair in order to get away from him as soon as possible. He hears someone greet him—presumably Theo—as he walks out of the bathroom, the door swinging shut behind him. He doesn't bother turning around to return it though and acts as if he didn’t hear him.
Draco raises his eyebrows, impressed with the idea. He’s starting to wonder why Coach Sylvester didn’t come here sooner. Another reason to resent Dumbledore. “That sounds like a great idea.”
As Draco is pulling out his wand to hex her, a spell hits him on his forehead and his head rapidly begins to swell up, causing his hat to slide off. As it enlarges, it becomes too heavy to hold up and he falls back onto his pillow with a grunt. Draco hears a deep, malicious cackle sound from the bathroom, and it hits him that Blaise hadn’t left.
Today was different though; He could feel her stare burning into him, but when he would glance up she would be reading her book once again, as if he had imagined it. It seemed like she was trying to solve him like a puzzle. But unfortunately for her, Draco is not a simple game of wizard’s chess.
Draco hums thoughtfully. It would explain many odd instances the day he got Goldstein and Patil out. Though the question of his charming persona and… the way he carried Draco. He shakes the thought away, wanting to avoid any more Potter-related confusion.
He turns back to his group, who all look ready to hop back on their brooms. “Well, that was a good start, and congratulations, what is your name?” He asks the Hufflepuff girl.
At the end of class, Pansy follows Draco out the door, keeping pace with him before he can disappear down the corridor. Draco was hoping that he could get away with not being questioned by Pansy about Potter, but he should have known she would be determined to accost him.
“You’re resilient, you know that?” Theo comments a few minutes later, keeping his tone casual, not daring to look directly at Draco.
Theo gapes, his casual demeanor dissolving instantly. He quickly collects himself, and forms a neutral expression, “Do you want some tea and biscuits from the kitchens?” He tries.
“There’s a book I need. I’m going to get it now,” He croaks, scrambling out of his seat towards the book stacks before Theo can respond. He almost jumps when he spots Granger staring at him questioningly from a nearby table, his heart picking up speed. Draco could swear that he didn’t see her there when he first arrived. But as he studies her face, he concludes she must have been listening to their conversation, being as nosy as ever.
After having to fight off Blaise who attached himself to Draco like a leech, begging to let him come along, Draco knocks on Coach Sylvester’s door, which swings open almost immediately.
Theo pushes on, leaning over the table and lowering his voice. “Draco, you just need to hear me out.”
Draco can speak English, French, and even a bit of Gobbledegok, which he overheard from the goblins his father spoke to when he was a child, but he still has no idea what Professor McGonagall just said.
There are still too many open wounds related to the war, and sometimes they unintentionally push the wrong buttons. Last summer at the Burrow, Harry accidentally mentioned Ron’s absence during the horcrux hunt. Hermione cried, and Ron didn’t speak to him for the rest of the day.
“Don’t underestimate me, Malfoy. There’s more to me than you know,” Potter says, his low voice sending a shiver through Draco’s bones.
As they both walk through the large doors, entering a room full of students, hundreds of eyes lock onto them, faces morphed in bewilderment. It’s a bit refreshing to see them a bit confused at the sight of them rather than with looks of disdain.
“No, that’s not— Smith was assaulting you for God’s sake. I was only trying to keep him from hurting you.”
Draco leaps to his feet, his cards flying across the table. “Well, I am going to call it an early night. See you all tomorrow,” he says hastily, running straight for the stairs to the dorms.
Draco almost chokes on his tea, covering his mouth with his hand. Of all people to help with the Quidditch Club, she wanted him. “I’m flattered, Coach Sylvester, but how does that have anything to do with Potter?”
Despite the countless hexes and threats he sent him, Smith never seemed to get the hint that Draco wasn’t interested; nasty, stubby, dirty-blonde Hufflepuffs aren’t his type. Smith could get kissed by a dementor for all he cares, and Pansy shares the same sentiment.
“I had an arch nemesis once. He was like stubborn gum under my shoe that wouldn’t unstick. He kept trying to sabotage my team, taking away our funds for his stupid club. He’d walk down the hall, acting like he owned them, and I just wanted to smash his stupid chin-face into the ground,” Coach Sylvester glowers, holding her mug tightly as she stares into the fire watching the memory flicker in the flames. “Potter reminds me of him… with his messy hair and self-righteous attitude, God I can’t stand the sight. He could be his twin,” she grumbles.
“Yes, but when it comes to you, any bit of common sense he has is thrown out the window. Nothing I say will convince him to let this go.”
Eventually, his mind started wandering outside his body into places so terrifying that he felt as if the snake was still sliding throughout the cavern, its tongue poking into his ear, accompanied by a hiss.
Draco returns to his book, and a heavy silence surrounds them as Hermione stares intently at him, clearly aching to say something to him—presumably something he won’t like; He has an inkling of what the topic could be. After a beat, she finally speaks up. “Can I ask you something?” Her voice is cautious yet her curiosity slips through enough for Draco to detect it.
“Take your own advice, because the only shining gold you’re going to see is the sight of my arse as I fly past you and catch the snitch.”
“Alright,” He says reassuringly, patting her back before getting off the bed to follow Theo out into the hall.
“None of us have told her or anyone else. We don’t see the point in doing so, it would be impossible for the Professors to monitor every corner of the castle, so nothing would really change. And it would only make us look weak,” Draco explains.
Draco barely resists rolling his eyes. He knows this is directed at the Golden Trio. She might as well say it out loud, and praise them once again for saving the entirety of the Wizarding World.
“Understand what?” Potter growls, taking a step towards him. “Being ostracized by the entire wizarding world? Having people stare at you constantly, harass you? Try half of my time at this bloody school. Second year? I was the Heir of Slytherin, summoning a Basilisk to attack muggleborns. Fourth year? I was a fraud, and I put my own name in the Goblet as a way to gain glory and even more fame. Which you so happened to be a part of when you slandered me in the Daily Prophet. Fifth year? I was considered a lunatic for claiming Voldemort—Don’t you dare flinch at the name—returned. Oh, and I recall that you were part of that too, serving as Umbridge’s little pet in her Inquisitorial Squad from hell. So, no, bully me for not having much sympathy for you.”
He thought perhaps it was because the battle had just ended, and he was too overwhelmed with grief to feel anything else. But then weeks had passed, then months, and he still felt the same subdued affection he had for her before they had dated.
that and the last thing we need to do is fulfill the role they expect us to play as evil former Death Eaters and Death Eater children,” Pansy insists.
“No, I— I feel like I don't really see you much anymore. You’re always with Pansy. I just wanted a moment to talk to you alone, is all,” Theo admits, pausing beside him. He glances at Draco for a moment before looking away.
Draco and Pansy turn to each other and nod in triumph, smiles gracing both their faces. This reminds him of fifth year when the Slytherins caught all the members of Potter’s stupid defense club. He beams at the memory.
“If I win, I want a favor,” Draco says. If he’s going to participate in something so absurd, he might as well get something out of it.
Draco remains silent for a moment, and he quickly loses his resolve. He’ll just help Pansy get Smith out and then he’ll quit.
Greg steps into the room cautiously as if expecting something to jump out at him. He scans the room and once he seems to decide he is not in danger, he nods and walks past Draco towards his bed, resting his back against the headboard.
“Erm, no,” he says, shaking his head, “I mean, he’s never really been quite good at being evil in the first place. He couldn’t even kill Dumbledore.”
The pair make their way to the Great Hall, both fashioning their unsightly hats with Slytherin arrogance. Draco tries to blink the sleep from his eyes and adjust to the early morning light passing through the castle windows as they walk through the bright halls.
Draco feels a tingle shoot through the back of his neck, which he tries to ignore. He resists the urge to rub it, convincing himself it’s nothing. He isn’t fearful of the corridors at the moment. Only the eighth-years get released early from class, and it’s impossible to hide the jingle of a bell.
Draco bursts into laughter and falls back onto his pillow, feeling significantly better about the situation.
As he recites the plan to himself for the 50th time precisely, word for word, he decides it’s finally time. With his heart pounding wildly, he recognizes that if he does not leave now, then he never will. He takes a few minutes to collect his belongings and take a few needed breaths. He decides against saying good-bye to his mother, reassuring himself that he will see her again in a blink of an eye. Draco has never been a brave person, but in his heart he knows this is what he must do. He looks down at the golden pendant placed around his neck, held up within by his hand, his eyes narrow with intent.
Something inside Draco drops. He blinks and after a moment, continues up the stairs to his dorm, controlling his breathing.
Draco knows it’s better to end the discussion now before it gets too complicated. “Kitchens?” He offers.
“This game is a survival of the fittest. Only the strongest will last in this game, so honestly, doormats, you don’t even stand a chance of winning,” She says in the direction of the Hufflepuffs, who frown at her disapprovingly.
“Harry,” Hermione interjects, frowning slightly, “I think you’re looking too far into it. He just happened to be standing there in the stack over and noticed my book fell. I highly doubt that Draco planned for Seamus to storm in here and cause a scene just so he could approach me.”
Harry sends her a smile he hopes is convincing and makes his way to the doors—but not too quickly—and begins plotting his course of action.
Potter just looks at him dumbly, of course, with his mouth open while Weasley’s face scrunches in aggravation.
Draco turns back to his wardrobe to avoid looking at her terrifying face. “My apologies, I’ve never heard of him. You have the wrong man.”
“Awful,” Draco responds, which he knows is not comprehensible. With a grown, he turns over on his side, facing Greg. “Completely and terribly horrible. Worst morning of my entire life.”
“Oh please, plenty of people would pay thousands of galleons to get the chance to caress my smooth, luxurious legs. There’s no need to compare mine to yours, Draco, I believe if you wanted to, you too could charge people to touch your alluring calves and earn more than the fortune you currently possess.”
Draco panics and scrambles to think of how to reassure her, “No, my Pan Pan, don’t cry. Potter is too noble to think anything of it. He wouldn’t call you a slimy Death Eater if you tagged him. And… it would be good to show him he’s not the best, wouldn’t it?” Draco tries warily.
“And yet your Gryffindor impulses took over so you could save the day once again, ultimately blowing your cover.” Draco smirks.
Harry doesn’t want to say that to anyone, however, because the last thing he wants to do while the Weasley’s are grieving Fred’s death is produce any more bad news. Harry knows how much Molly especially loves the idea of him and Ginny as a couple. She even dropped him hints on a few occasions last summer when she caught Harry alone, reminding him of how happy they were when they were together. Each time, Harry indulged her with a smile and nod, unable to cause her any more heartbreak.
“You’re choosing to waste time on this farcical game instead of revising? Millie, where are your priorities? Don’t you want to become a member of the Wizengamot?” He asks desperately.
“Ah, Malfoy,” Ginny says, turning to Harry with a smirk. “Still butthurt Coach Sylvester picked him over you Harry?” she teases, punching his shoulder a bit too rough, causing him to wince slightly.
Madam Sylvester—or Coach Sylvester as she prefers to called—holds her intense stare a beat before walking to the bags she brought with her placed in front of the fireplace.
for beta reading this chapter, you are fantastic and I appreciate you so much!! :) Now, enjoy the chapter!
Draco grins in delight, glad to have regained the upper hand. “Well, that was quite effective, as well as enjoyable. I believe Gr—Hermione would find good use for that as well.” He moves his arm up to do it again. However, Draco’s second attempt is stopped by Potter’s swift grip around his wrist.
“You’re being so terribly dramatic that you’re making Blaise sound like a humble, sensible person,” Draco drawls.
“Fine.” Draco sighs, getting in position. He flicks his wand the way he’s done countless times—grudgingly how Potter instructed to do it—and only a faint glow appears before flickering out again.
Theo locks eyes with Draco. “Well, Draco, not everything has to be complicated,” he says, his challenge subtle enough for only Draco to catch.
Pansy jerks her head back as if she had been slapped. “I’m just being realistic. You’re going to humiliate yourself.”
“So, you didn’t even tell us,” Pansy says, breaking the silence, “how did he even manage to do that so early in the morning?” Her eyes are still glued to the smirking idiot as he sits down next to Thomas, slapping the palm of his raised hand. Whatever that means.
“Well, then they used to be. I remember you always begged me to run to the kitchens with you to grab some,” Theo counters.
Draco startles from his thoughts and drops his quill on the floor. Theo sets his bag down on the table and bends down to pick up the quill for him. When Draco accepts it with an eye roll, he sits himself across from Draco, staring at him inquisitively.
A ferret? That was one time! He’s not surprised that Weasley is throwing around the fact that he was a Death Eater—he’s not particularly wrong. And of course the Weasel would, because he’s always been such a tactless brute. But calling him a ferret is cruel, especially when he was so viciously abused by Crouch. The bruises on his body from being slammed to the ground didn’t fade for weeks.
He is also rather curious what form it would take. He eagerly wants it to be a dragon, as it would be entirely fitting, but he knows the chances are slim.
A few tense minutes later, they hear the opening of the latch, and students start climbing down the ladder one by one.
He keeps his head down towards his food but looks up at Draco from beneath his lashes. “I’m pleased by the offer, but I must refuse. I have to talk to Professor Flitwick about my project.”
Of course, he would want the right to brag that he managed to get a patronus out of a Death Eater, it would only add to his board of achievements—one that he is sure Potter has hung beside his bed. Draco bets it helps him go to sleep every night, looking at all the various plaques marking his successes.
“Excuse me, where is your loyalty? I’ve been your friend since we were in diapers and you broke my toe by dropping a rock on my foot.”
Draco made a vow recently to never lie to Greg, so, “Yes,” he says softly. “I just needed to complain. He’s going to beat me and humiliate me even further.”
Normally, Draco would be grateful for the defense, however, he doesn’t needs Potter’s pity, “Oh so everyone listens to the Chosen One when he says to stop, but not Blaise. How—”
Pansy wraps her arms around herself and looks back down, shaking her head, “I can’t do this, there’s no way. I don’t want to play anymore,” She whimpers, her eyes welling with tears.
“—Then what is it you want? The deepest desire in you, what you are deprived of from the She-Weasley—”
“We’re not Hufflepuffs, Draco, we have a sense of self-preservation. Something you seem to be lacking currently,” Blaise says.
There’s light, brighter than he’s ever gotten the patronus to be. But it dwindles away as fast as it appears. He opens his eyes slowly to see Theo smiling brightly at him.
Draco startles to see McGonagall holding out the bag, peering down at him with an unimpressed look. He reluctantly reaches into the bag and quickly grabs a name. She continues looking at him for another moment, her face calculating, before continuing on to Pansy. He looks down at the small piece of parchment and unfolds—
Although Draco has been questioning his entire perspective of Muggle-borns lately, he doesn’t want to impose a crisis on Greg just yet. He decides it’s best to play it safe by relaying his previously held beliefs.
Draco hums, avoiding her gaze as they walk. “Not necessarily. Perhaps I was feeling more irritated by you that day than normal.”
Draco stands there frozen in shock as Potter catches his breath from his heated rant. Potter has officially lost his mind. Draco wasn’t prepared for this—he didn’t sign up to be his punching bag. Potter needs to dump his baggage on some other poor sap, because Draco has more important things to do.
Draco doesn’t get a chance to tell her he will absolutely not be meeting with her as she runs off, continuing her pursuit for Thomas.
“You never play this game with me when I ask! I thought you just didn’t like this game anymore.” Blaise plops himself beside Draco, leaning his elbow on his shoulder.
He sits in pure agony in his charms class, counting down the minutes and waiting for Flitwick to release them. After Pansy’s comment about the professor’s “appealing stature,” Draco can't look at him the same without picturing horrific images in his mind. Every time Pansy looks up at the board, Draco sends a scowl in her direction, occasionally sticking his tongue out at her if he can get away with it.
As they all rush onto their brooms, Draco begins making his way over to the chest. Once he gets closer he spots She-Weasley bending over in front of it to grab the quaffles, and she turns at the sound of his footsteps.
He recalls feeling so enamored by her in sixth year, and how she quickly became the only thought occupying his mind. For those last few, blissful months, all Harry wanted to do was spend every waking moment in her presence, with his hands tangled in her soft hair, taking in her warm, flowery scent. They were the final untainted months he had before everything in his world collapsed as Dumbledore died and the Death Eaters had taken over Hogwarts.
Ginny snorts loudly, leaning her elbows on the table. “You say that as if you weren’t fighting a basilisk at age twelve.”
“So, you think I’m up to mischief and you’ve decided to follow me? Quite understandable, considering I have proven to be capable of mass murder and misdeeds. But I’d say you’d be better off staying away from me in that case.”
“Is this an interview for the Prophet? Planning to get a good chunk of galleons for this scoop?” Draco snaps, glaring at her. He regrets it as it comes out of his mouth, but he can’t fight his defensive nature.
“Draco, eat your food. There’s plenty of time to focus on Transfiguration later. Such as maybe, Transfiguration class for instance?” Pansy says, yanking the book from his hands.
They fall into a comfortable silence after that, Draco pulling out his Herbology textbook to read. However, the few, peaceful minutes are soon shattered by the loud clatter of the bathroom door swinging open, a signature motion of one specific person.
Theo scoffs disbelievingly, “That’s like saying Potter actually put his name into the Goblet of Fire for the Triwizard Tournament…”
The spell heads towards Theo who quickly moves out of the way, and it hits the window behind him instead. After a moment he shakes his head, turning towards the group. “That was a close call,” Theo says, keeping his voice even.
?” She demands, noticing his foul mood. She grabs his arm, gripping tightly as they walk out of the classroom, “Don’t think I haven’t noticed you glaring at me all of class.”
—of all the terrible things he’s done and causes her to renew her animosity towards him. Draco would be back to square one.
Weasley unconsciously drops the bacon back on his plate as he stares back at her, fear displayed plainly on his face.
“I have half a mind to take them away from you. Make you run a bit to get some exercise. That bacon isn't going to make you any fitter, Weasley.”
A part of him almost wishes that he had gotten Potter as his target so he could finally knock him down a peg. He is so sick of hearing all about how he saved the entire Wizarding World from the Dark Lord’s reign. Their lives are so insignificant that all they have to discuss is the scrawny bespectacled git and his ability to cast an Expelliarmus charm. How miserable.
The entire week he’s been practicing but even the pressure of having to show his classmates has not been enough to produce any results. He’s surely doomed.
Draco watches as a significantly large group of girls bound over to Wood, giggling amongst one another. Of course, with Wood coming back with the reputation as the star player on the Falcons team, he’s bound to attract a bunch of fan girls.
Coach Sylvester scoffs. “No, I don’t have the energy for that runt. I just like you better, you’re not a bumbling, smug idiot. The first meeting will take place a couple weeks before tryouts, and I’m planning to postpone those so we have enough time. So, what do you say?”
“That was uncalled for, you know how difficult it was to get rid of that putrid smell. That was the worst week of my life. But anyway, I don’t recall such an instance of you—”
“Don’t be sorry, it’s just a matter of survival. We have to convince the entire Wizarding World that we have reformed and become muggle-lovers for the sake of our own self-preservation.”
“Hermione, Potter can make his own decisions, he’s a big boy now. If he wishes to partake in a competition with me, then he should be allowed to do so if he chooses.”
“Hardly. Not when all I have to do is shoot air into your hair for you to shriek and run off like Peeves is chasing you with dungbombs.”
“Then I resent you for at least not letting me in on it so I could watch. You’re cruel.” Pansy crosses her arms and scowls.
Abruptly, she jerks forward as if to attack and Draco flinches away towards Pansy, moving her body in front of him. Coach Sylvester smirks before leaning back up, facing the rest of the students again.
“Did you insist I tag along with you just so you could come onto me?” He stops walking, the last of his minimal patience gone.
you come in here and disrupt the students studying in my library! I told Minerva not to allow students to participate in this crude excuse of a game, but she refused to budge from her inter-house unity nonsense. Both of you, OUT, or I will make you dust off every corner of this library until you can no longer feel any of your fingers, understood?”
“Sod off, I’m not risking anything, because some of us want to win. How do I know you won't find a way to steal my hat without getting caught?” Weasley snarls, “And you look just as ridiculous in that hat as we do when you have it on you slimy Death Eater!”
Theo sighs, letting the emotions drain out of him. “It’s fine, we’ll just talk about it later,” he says sullenly.
He is starting to accept the idea of Muggleborns, admitting to himself that Granger is more skilled than he will ever be even with her blood status. Clearly, blood does not define power; that has been demonstrated. However, he still can’t shake his bias towards them that has been ingrained into him since the minute he was born.
your target, you never told me.” Pansy asks, wiping her tears away as she turns to look at him, her eyes wide.
Immediately after crossing through the doors, Draco snatches the hat off to card his fingers through his hair, trying meagerly to style it slightly. As they approach the eighth year table, Draco feels Potter’s gaze on him. Draco sends him an icy glare that goes unnoticed as Potter’s eyes are glued to his hair.
They both laugh breathlessly as they tumble and fall to the floor, wrestling each other like they did as kids back in the fields of the Manor.
“How did you get involved? You’re just a teenager. You’re all normally too busy with your heads between each other’s legs.”
A smile grows on Theo’s face, and he shoves Draco’s shoulder playfully. Draco can’t help but release a soft chuckle.
“Actually, runt, it wasn’t cheating,” Coach Sylvester appears unannounced, “That was called skill, which, unfortunately you seem to lack. It’s not their fault your penguin legs can't do more than waddle a few feet down the corridor. Now get up or you’ll squash the egg you’re carrying between your feet,” She demands impatiently.
“Yes, but I can do my studying another time. And frankly, it’s none of your business,” Millie says curtly, stabbing her sausage with her fork.
“See? Thank you Greg, you’re a true friend. Get off my bed you traitor,” He says, half heartedly shoving Pansy’s shoulder.
She knocks a book off the nearest table to her, startling the Hufflepuff girls seated there, “they’ll shoot you! No hesitation, friendship completely off the table! If any of you want to even consider winning, you’ll need to eat this game for breakfast, digest it, empty the waste from your system, and repeat the next day. You understand? Good, because I won’t repeat myself.”
This throws Draco off, bewildering him. Why does Potter sound so sure of that? He keeps his expression hard.
His words are cut off as Smith collapses to the ground and Draco is released from his restraints, the ropes falling to the floor. He turns to see who his hero is and—
- Meanwhile, Ron is rooting for Harry and Ginny to get back together, but—awkward—Harry doesn’t want to and keeps it to himself
Some nights, despite the nightmares that follow, he lights a candle on his nightstand and stares at it for hours until he cries, the rekindling of the memory becoming unbearable. The next morning, Draco always asks himself why he does it to himself, and a small voice rationalizes that he deserves it for what he’s done in the war. Draco can never find it in himself to argue against it.
“Well, I’ve been struggling with Potions and you with Defense, so I was thinking we could help each other out?”
“What am I supposed to do? Back down? Absolutely not, we already shook hands on it. I will beat him,” he says resolutely, though he doesn’t fully believe his own words.
Weasley and Potter both scowl at Blaise before taking their seats on the other end of the table, grumbling lowly to one another.
Since the incident in the Room of Requirement, faced with near death, the threat of being engulfed by flames imminent, he jumps at the sight of fire; whether it’s a candle lit on Greg’s nightstand at night or a flaming torch in the corridors. He thinks it’s a stupid thing to fear when he has seen and experienced much worse, but all he can do is try to work through it a little bit at a time.
“I just,” Harry had run a hand through his hair, more artfully tousled than messy these days (he really does have a spectacular stylist). “I’ve made that mistake before, jumped into bed too quickly.”
This is wrong. This is so wrong. This isn’t how the story goes. He doesn’t realize he’s shouting until Hermione falls to the floor next to him. Wraps her arms around him, sobbing.
Malfoy is groaning now as he describes what he’s doing to himself, and Harry takes advantage of the noise to ruck up his shirt and undo his trousers and shove them down. Just to get more comfortable, he assures himself. That’s it.
They’re laying down now, Harry tucked between the vee of Draco’s thighs, chest to chest, and Harry props himself up to take a look at Draco, who’s flushed and tousled beneath him on the couch. Harry gives him a wicked grin and then begins kissing his way down Draco’s chest, marveling at the feel of the soft skin under his tongue.
Which brings them to now. Harry had opened the door, pulled Draco in. He’d barely shut the door behind him before Harry had been yanking at Draco’s clothes. They’d almost met disaster as Harry had tried to remove Draco’s trousers while leading him up the stairs by his tie, but they’d sorted it out.
Draco obediently drinks, and when he’s sufficiently warmed, he takes himself upstairs and into the bedroom. Harry’s left the drapes open, and Draco can see the first blush of dawn outside as he carefully strips down to his pants and slides into the bed next to Harry.
He follows as Potter turns, waiting for Draco to catch up before starting to walk further into the maze.
He has to press a hand to his own aching cock. It’s true, he does want this, but not more than he wants Draco to want it.
Malfoy looks away, and Harry would almost swear that he’s blushing. It’s hard to tell in the moonlight.
“Fuck,” Draco says and gives a wordless cry as Harry does it again, mouthing at him through the fabric. “Potter.
Malfoy has owned his mistakes, spoken passionately for reunification and healing, and most of all, he’s put in the time and the sweat. Like the rest of them, over the summer, he'd worked hard on the restoration. It had been rough when the term had started, but by the time the Winter break had come and gone, Malfoy and the other Slytherins had been folded back into student life at Hogwarts. It hasn’t been easy for him, Harry knows, but the grudging respect he’d given Malfoy for the way he’d stood up and done the right thing has shifted into something else now.
“You were in luck, mate,” Ron says solemnly. “Her charmwork is for shit. The curse was supposed to hit you and her, get you sent to the Forest together.”
They stand, plastered together, and Draco winds his arms around Harry’s body, feeling the way Harry is fighting to keep still as they kiss.
By the time they’ve made it to the clearing, Harry’s so tired he’s having trouble keeping his eyes open, and he only realizes they’ve arrived when he hears Draco mutter, “Thank fucking Merlin,” and, dropping Harry’s hand, Draco hurries away.
“Don’t you dare, Harry. Don’t you fucking dare.” Draco pulls Harry up and quirks an eyebrow at him as he reaches for the hem of Harry’s shirt, and at Harry’s nod, pulls the garment up and over Harry’s head.
Harry glances back and catches the flash of Malfoy’s teeth as he grins, casting some complicated hex
They head back in and share the shower. Draco rests his hands against the tiled wall as Harry scrubs his back, tilting his head to the side as Harry kisses him gently. When they emerge from the bathroom, Keely’s been and gone, and there’s a lovely tea laid out for them.
“Not to me,” Harry says quietly, watching as Malfoy approaches him. “It’s really not evident to me at all.”
He slows a bit, lets Harry ride it out, and Harry sighs, a long, low exhale, and opens his eyes. He looks stunned, Draco thinks, his chest heaving.
Malfoy gives a soft groan, the kind you make when you’re stretching, and Harry pictures the length of Malfoy’s body, and the way his skin would look against the dark velvet of his comforter. Malfoy gasps, and yeah, Harry can hear him. Harry can hear
Draco grins, and it hits Harry, he’s beautiful like this, flushed and tousled, face so soft and open it takes Harry’s breath away. Draco sits up and yanks his shirt off over his head, tossing it to the side. Harry sees the faint lines of scars across his chest and reaches up to run his finger gently over them.
Hermione says nothing, and there’s nothing to be said, is there? Draco knows that for the rest of his life, this will be the defining moment. The moment that separates before from after.
After the luncheon is cleared and the lawyers have taken their leave, Draco goes upstairs to get ready. He looks up as Harry walks into the bedroom.
He wraps his hand tightly around his cock and begins to move, gently at first, but it’s good, it’s so fucking good, the way Harry is spread out beneath him, arms wide as he stares avidly at the show Draco’s putting on.
He manages to urge Draco back a step, and can’t help the thrill that runs through him. Draco’s eyes are wide and he’s panting as if he’s just run a 10K race, and he looks as undone as Harry feels.
Draco’s wearing soft cotton pants, and he moans as Harry drags his thumb along the length of his cock.
Draco ignores him, steps closer, and sees the way Potter freezes, his throat bobbing as he swallows.
Draco frowns. “I really don’t… I can’t say as I’ve ever heard of anyone using that particular technique. Generally, things are over very quickly in these situations, one way or the other.”
“So, I heard something curious,” Harry says, striving for a casual tone that belies the way his heart is pounding. “I heard you like me,”
Draco takes Harry deep even as he pushes in, reveling in the way Harry opens up for him, the way Harry’s body jerks and his eyes fly open when Draco crooks his fingers just so.
Harry can’t help himself and leans in to kiss Draco again, now that he knows it’s allowed. Now that he knows it’s
This time, it’s Harry who leans in, Harry who traces the delicate curve of Draco’s ear with his tongue, Harry who nips at the tendons in Draco’s neck that stand out in stark relief as his head tilts back.
He starts moving forward, and hasn’t gone very far when he hears something up ahead of him, and throwing caution to the wind, he hurries forward, following the twists and turns of the maze, chasing the sound that he can’t quite identify, until a voice pulls him up short.
The door closes but, Draco notes, as Harry leans in again, and urges Draco to lift his hips so Harry can slide down his trousers and briefs, the door isn’t closed all the way. And it’s absolutely not locked.
“Hmm?” Draco says, and Harry sighs. He looks exhausted, and Harry just wants to bundle him up and carry him away.
. Those words that are still here in the room, echoing off the walls. They hadn’t even been fucking, they’d just been in bed. Sitting quietly, not doing anything. Draco had been reading, Harry had been watching him. And he’d just said it.
Hermione rolls her eyes and sighs. “Thank you, Draco, and you’re looking, well, smashed really. I just went to the loo, where did you find the whiskey?”
Ron moves, rolling over so he’s pinning Harry down with the familiar, comfortable weight of his body. “Fuck that, mate. You’ve done enough.”
That there are Slytherins included in that group no longer surprises Harry in the slightest. He’s seen the way they’ve worked, he’s heard the anguish in their voices as they recount their own pain, and ultimately, Harry knows, they just want to move forward in this post-war world, the same as anyone else. As much as Harry hates his role as the
“You’re so fucking amazing, Harry, I can’t believe this. Never thought I’d get this with you. God, you’re so beautiful,” and Draco is pressing kisses to the top of Harry’s head.
Draco knows how wrong they were, how wrong he’s been. How hard he tries now, to be better. To be worthy, especially of this. Harry’s mouth on his neck, his hands on Draco’s body. Harry knows too. Draco’s sure he does.
“Lift up a sec,” Harry whispers, and as Draco does, he slides down the layers of fabric, just far enough so he can wrap his hand around the hot flesh that jerks under his touch.
Draco swallows and opens his eyes. “Nothing. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Now that I’ve seen you, I’ll leave you to your…” he makes a vague gesture to the neatly trimmed hedges around them and turns to go.
They kiss for long moments, until finally, Harry eases back, feeling shattered, like he’s been turned inside out. Draco’s not much better off — he looks dazed, his mouth swollen and red, and his hair definitely looks like someone’s been running their hands through it enthusiastically.
Draco realizes he’s been quiet for a while now, and when he looks at Harry, Harry’s right there, looking back at him.
The man is like an octopus, Draco thinks, not for the first time, as he extracts himself from the bed. Five years, they’ve been doing this, and he’s still not sure how Harry manages to hold on to him.
Draco lets go of Harry’s cock with a momentary flash of regret, shifts so he’s bracing himself on both arms, and leans in, trying to keep that angle that makes Harry’s head toss back, makes Harry groan. Harry’s a talker, it turns out, a litany of “
Harry looks up and gives Draco a mischievous grin. “Really? Because it looks to me,” and here he carefully eases down Draco’s zipper, “Like we can.” He breathes out, heat and moisture onto the soft skin of Draco’s belly, and Draco’s head slams back against his chair’s headrest, “Like we are.”
Harry groans as Draco’s mouth touches him, and Draco loses himself in the taste of Harry’s skin under his tongue. He nips and licks and presses hot, wet, open-mouthed kisses, working his way higher and higher until he can’t scrunch up the fabric anymore. Harry has slid down on the lounge chair and Draco can see the sizable bulge he’s sporting as he pants.
