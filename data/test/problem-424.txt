And Harry had to admit that he was and then once he noticed he couldn’t stop noticing, but just because someone is attractive doesn’t mean that you blurt out an invite to a game like an idiot. And Malfoy was an annoying git. Being flirty and then as soon as Harry asks him out, acting like he had better things to do.
“That’s what Mione says.” Ron said, shaking his head as if surrounded by fools. “She actually brushes them and then charms them too.”
“It’s not like that.”  Harry said, but he didn’t know what exactly it was and wasn’t like.
“Yeah, I guess so.”
Harry woke up the next morning once again in the expensive sheets and comfortable bed of Draco, only this time he didn’t wake up alone. Harry shifted carefully so not to wake up the sleeping figure. Draco was spread out as if use to sleeping alone and for reasons Harry wasn’t ready to analyze just yet, the thought that Draco wasn’t use to sharing his bed made Harry irrationally happy. Harry sat up carefully on his elbow and looked over the sleeping blond, he was on his back with his arms above his head, the death eater mark in dark contrast to the pale skin of his face.
“Are you?” Bisexual?” Draco asked, biting back, the retort he really wanted to say. He wanted to grab Potter closer and suggest they get to know each other
Harry shrugged. “I guess old habits die hard.”
“Anyone I know?” Ron asked.
“Hmm.”  Draco, unleened himself from Potter’s desk and with practiced grace sauntered to the pudgy man’s desk, two rows back, he could feel Potter’s eyes following him.  At least that was one win today.
“I think something darker.” Pansy suggested, walking away to gather, a few more selections.
Teddy looked thoughtful for a moment, but the excuse must have worked because he jumped into the next topic with his usual six year old attention span. “That would be fun. Did you know that Draco means Dragon.” And so on and so on. Teddy filled Harry in on everything he knew about his cousin Draco, apparently he did go visit Teddy and his aunt. Making Harry glad that he had partaken in the charity, because Harry had no doubt that Draco would have spun Harry’s decline to make him look bad and he could only imagine the look Teddy would make when he asked him, why he didn’t want to help orphaned kids, like him. Draco really was an arse.
Draco looked unimpressed.
Draco nodded his head and downed his drink.  “Weasley babies.”  He said with a shudder.  Harry laughed, then realizing he wasn’t going to make it anywhere near Ron and Hermione anytime soon.  He leaned forward and suggested, “I should probably distract you from such thoughts.”
“What?  George says things.”
“Come through.”
“Might be tougher to recruit him than you think.”
“That’s good.  Not the inability to sleep, but that you weren’t having bad dreams.”  Draco had a small scowl on his face as he returned to his chair, with Harry’s tea.
“Hopefully you are a better keeper than seeker.”
“Uncle Harry could shrink it and it could stay with my other stuffed animals.” Teddy turned his attention back to Harry. “Right?” Harry looked between Teddy’s hopeful face and Andromeda’s wondering what the right answer was.
“Draco, hope we aren’t interrupting.”  Pansy said, gliding her way into the kitchen.  They even tried to make walking look like they didn’t have to pick up their feet like normal people.
“Without his hobby, he’s going stir crazy.”  Nott said.
A short fifteen minutes later, Malfoy returned to Harry’s desk, holding a stamped piece of parchment. “I have my permit. It was quite quick and painless. I am happy to inform you that your department isn’t completely incompetent like many of the other departments.”
“Pansy.” Harry greeted her, trying to be as casual as he could muster.
“Not all the spots are filled yet and I’m still waiting on replies, but I was thinking about asking that Weasel...ey.”
Draco shot a glare at Zabini, who let out a huffy sigh. “Fine. I'll delete it.” He pulled the small camera out and pressed a couple buttons.
“If the rest of the place is as hopeless as this room. I don’t know if I want to see.”
Harry picked the letter up, his curiosity finally getting the best of him and he broke the wax seal.
“I found that couch on the curb, someone was throwing it out.”
After their victory the entire team had huddled together in excitement and comradery. Hugging and cheering. It was fun until he was forced to come face to face with Harry, whose face turned red as he awkwardly stumbled his way through giving Draco a pat on the shoulder and a job well done. Draco rolled his eyes just thinking about it. Harry wasn’t going to just let this go, he was going to make it a drawn out process of stuttered ers and stiff shoulders and instead of avoiding Draco he would be all Gryffindor about it and most likely go out of his way just to prove something that Draco wouldn’t even begin to understand. Draco caught the left side of his mouth begin to rise, but he put a stop to the motion before it was able to become a full blown smile. He huffed and shut the water off, before stepping out of the shower. He cast a quick drying charm and rushed to get dressed.
He'd turned them down instantly.
“Your
"Of course you'd remember that Albus." She scolded him slightly, but Harry didn't miss the fondness in her voice.
The moment they were out of the room, Hermione turned on Ron. "What in merlins name was that?"
"Oh I don't know, I heard Jessica Houston has a new ferret who could replace you just fine." She replied dryly and Draco gasped indignantly, drawing away from her and pouting whilst Blaise laughed at him.
She folded her hands on the desk authoritatively. "I'll get straight to it. I've recently been in contact with the Minister regarding your plans for when you leave school. They've already offered you various jobs at the Ministry haven't they?"
“Thats not what I- never mind.” Harry stuttered, picking it up and taking a tentative sip. It tasted like mint.
And then they were gone and Draco’s wrists were free.
and the familiar feeling of someone entering his head. It was subtle that if he’d been in the street, he could easily mistake it for a gust of wind or the beginnings of a headache. But he knew better.
Malfoy nodded slowly. “That’s great Aunt Walburga's house, isn’t it? I think I visited as a child. Is that appalling display of elf heads still there?”
Malfoy simply raised an eyebrow and took another sip of his drink. Finnigan, I’m a lot of things but a hypocrite isn’t one of them.”
of all people inside his head,
“Alright then,” Zabini said, deciding to risk it. “We’ll buy you all a pint.”
"Charming as ever I see Weasley. Oh, how I've missed our little chats!"
"Excuse me?" Hermione snorted.
He inspected his body briefly in the mirror, he was in better shape than he'd ever been before and his skin was vaguely tanned from the long days he would spend sitting outside of the burrow with Ron when the grief in the house got too claustrophobic.
“The vow usually takes a few days to settle.” He explained, standing up and smirking at Harry. “Unless you’d like to spend more time in my charming company?”
"Are you forgetting that he was actively trying to kill Dumbledore! I was doing the right thing!" He protested, glowering at all three of them.
Before Harry finally broke and decided that he might as well come along after all.
"Yeah." Harry agreed at the same time Ron nodded.
"It's fine Pans. You can say his name don't worry- I'm over it, really." He can't stand her sympathetic gaze, she means well but he's not ready to talk about Theo. Not yet.
“Well,” Malfoy breathed, running a hand through rumpled hair. “That was pretty good for a first attempt, as good as can be expected anyway.”
"But Mione..." It came out as whine, that in any other situation, Draco would have laughed at him about. "Whatever."
Zabini swore loudly. “Fuck, I left him with Theo and Daph.”
He turned away, grabbing his least embarrassing pyjamas out of his trunk and stalked towards the bathroom to change. There was no chance he was going to strip down in front of the Slytherins.
“Fine, but I don’t want to watch that stupid cartoon with all the vulgar jokes in it.”  Draco said, throwing himself down onto the other side of the bed, his feet up by the pillows.
She let out a huff. “This doesn’t have something to do with Potter does it?”
“I thought the other captain was going to be here.” Potter commented. He was sounding bored and sulky, that would not do.
“You are late darling.” His mother pointed out, leaning in so that Draco could give her a kiss on the cheek.
Harry had been surprised when he showed up to the second practice wearing actual training gear. The color plain brown and his shirt loose fitting, hauling a bundle of pads behind him. The most surprising thing of all was the bright red ring around his neck that he wasn’t even trying to cover. Harry had painstakingly been reading everything written about Rubert’s disease and the sight of the cursed ring left him unsettled. Draco had looked confident and determined when he entered and Harry had later admitted he had looked even better than usual, when it was clear that for once he wasn’t even trying to.
“Seems like a pattern.” His father commented, eyeing Harry beside him. Clearly thinking that it was his fault and a bad influence on his son.
“That I wanted to kiss you and that probably meant I liked you.”  Harry was starting to get frustrated.  “It’s not like I go around getting tossed and kissing people just because.”
“That explains why he agreed to participate in the Quidditch game.” Harry had been surprised when he had seen his name on the list of his team.
The other captain arrived with Pansy on his arm. “Draco, darling. Sorry we are are late. We lost track of time.” She gave Draco an insinuating wink.
“I didn’t know.”  Draco practically whispered.
“I was drunk, but that didn’t mean I didn’t like you.  It meant that I was drunk enough to actually have the courage to do something about it.”
It had been Draco’s idea to throw a party to celebrate making it through ‘The Lock Down’.  Harry didn’t think it had been much of a hardship.  He never ended up getting any renovating done as he had hoped, but that was okay.
Potter stumbled only slightly upon landing in Draco’s living room. A small thing that gave away that he wasn’t born into the wizarding world. He was wearing full muggle attire, but Draco had to admit for once he didn’t look frumpy. His dark green jacket was fitted and brought the green out in his eyes, and his jeans showed that he was fit below the waist as well as above.
Harry ate standing at the island, the table too cluttered to sit at, while Draco continued to announce what he thought were important highlights from the broadcast.  “They said that the hospitals are starting to see a rise in cases, but it’s not putting a strain on them as of yet.”
“You know musicians, they are never on time.” Draco waved offhandedly towards the door. He had told Pansy to keep him occupied as to get some alone time with Potter, but so far it wasn’t turning out as planned. Potter always found a way to spoil Draco’s plans.  “Now before you turn the idea down completely. What about green?” Potter made a face, and Draco quickly pushed on, “It doesn’t have to be Slytherin green, but a nice jade, or maybe a teal?” He pulled a square of fabric off the wall and held it up to Harry, then put it down, picking up the one next to it.
Well, well, who could that be but the Golden trio!
Draco turned towards the court and saw people nodding. Humming. Considering.
Draco shuddered away that thought. If the savior said, there would be no question, he knew it.
"As for Malfoy...Draco Malfoy, " Potter began again, once the court had relatively silenced, " He saved my life, I saved his. So I dont think I owe him anything. And he did make way to allow the Death Eaters to infiltrate Hogwarts, which lead to Bill being mauled by Greyback,"
Draco's heart ached in ways he couldn't even explain. After all that he had gone through to save them, this was how it was going to end. All of them out of their minds in misery.
All Draco could do was wait.
Draco thought it was over, all of it.  The dark mark was enough of the evidence really. He was going to be following his father's footsteps yet again.
"And this also was what led to Professor Dumbledore's death, " Granger took the reigns, " But we also know that he had no choice. It was either that or his family's death. We believe that had he and his family known something, anything about muggles, they wouldn't think they deserve to die. It was nothing but a mistake in ideology taught to a child."
"Nevermind nevermind," the latest minister of magic, Kingsley Shacklebolt interrupted.
He knew what all things he might see, when the dementors will surround him. Never had Draco thought in all his life, that anything of his childhood could cause him torment. Oh! How naive was he!
It was Weasley who spoke first, "You have said quite a lot of things that hurt us. You have targeted our family while speaking and insulted them many times," he said, then looking in his eyes, Weasley continued, "But we forgive you. All three of us."
Everything was over. He was reunited with his mother. But tomorrow he would leave for the muggle world. But right now, they That was when the golden trio came to them.
Draco knew he would now see everything he had done to Dobby. The guilt would be the thing to kill him. After all new creatures now swapped the Azkaban - Gythur. They fed on guilt.
Draco couldn't stop his eyes from widening or leaning back in sheer shock. Of all the things, he would never have expected this.
He turned to Draco and continued, " I nearly killed my friends in my attempt to save my godfather." He sighed, " Ironically enough, that was what led to his death." His voice was gentle. Painful.
"We are sorry about being late," he forged on, " but Hogwarts..."
"Harry Potter...Mr Potter, Mr Weasley,  Ms Granger," Someone bleated. Clearing his throat he continued,  " how can we help you?"
Draco seethed. Did she just, say that he was not raised well. He was....wasnt he?
"My life was saved by countless people over the course of my seventeen years, begining from my father and mother's sacrifice to my friends support. But the most unlikeliest people saved me this last year, and if it weren't for them, I...we would have died," he said, glancing at his friends, "and these people are none other than, Narissca  Malfoy and Draco Malfoy."
"So we think, Mrs Malfoy should be under house arrest for six months, where her wand must be tracked, and in this time, using the Malfoy money, an orphanage must be opened for all the wizards and witches, irrespective of their blood. Muggleborns who have no one, children who lost their parents in this war or otherwise and now have no other family who want to take them, everyone can stay there. Mrs Malfoy, once the six months are over, will be in charge of the orphanage. She will be directly under the minister of child welfare, and hence will report to them." Potter finished.
"Er...um..yes.." He stammered, clearly having forgotten where he stopped.
Unknown to the turmoil, her words had put him in, she forged ahead, " For one year, he must live as a muggle."
Potter glanced at his two friends and  they nodded. Granger quickly leaned in and whispered something in his ears. Potter nodded.
He felt an emotion, so foreign, so strange he didn't realise what it was for a few moments - Gratitude.
Potter cleared his throat, clearly uncomfortable with the many eyes trained at him. His eyes flicked to the chair Draco was sitting, though be never looked at the said man. Weasley placed his hand on Potter's shoulders and Granger squeezed his hand.
"There are countless times I have wished to have a mother. I would never steal you from him," Potter said, glancing at Draco. His voice brimmed with sincerity. There was no doubt that he meant every word if it.
"We are here to give a testimony about Mrs Malfoy and Draco Malfoy." He said.
As if there is anything to be confused about, this is Potter and his friends. They hated Draco and he was very aware of that. They were probably there to ensure he recieved the Dementors kiss.
He paused, unwilling to say further. Perhaps that is why the red head continued, "Exactly what she did is something we are not very thrilled to recount, but you will have to trust us when we say that she doesn't deserve a lifetime in Azkaban. And Malfoy didn't kill  Dumbledore, like you think. The only other person present there was Harry and he says so."
Bloody Potter and his determination! Bloody Granger and Weasley always supporting him.
"She?" Someone asked, "Then what do you reckon should be done with Ms Malfoy."
Potter looked at Draco's mother and smiled. Draco felt as if someone had stolen his breath, and quite possibly his heartbeat too. Because never, in his entire life had Draco seen such an honest smile. He was used to the smile people plaster on their faces. Looking at his mother's startled expression, he knew she felt the same.
Granger held his hand and Potter paused to look at his friend. Weasley smiled in gratitude, but motioned for potter to continue.
They nodded to the court. But it was already filled with whispers. Everyone looked confused.
Granger spoke next, " Even I forgive you, Malfoy," her eyes seemed to pin his to the wall. The amount of guilt he felt as she continued was something he couldn't explain. "You have made me cry countless times by your words, and the thousand times you have called me a mudblood, making me feel lesser than my worth. But I forgive you, malfoy." She whispered the last part, and without a word followed her boyfriend.
“On you or me?”, Draco answered grinning widely.
When he felt steadier again, he slowly got up, rinsing himself and leaving the shower. He went to his bathroom again, smelling Harry in the air, he went to his closet and decided for a midnight blue lace string along with the suiting midnight blue lace corset. Because it wasn’t too warm in his flat, he decided to wear a loosely knitted grey over-sized sweater.
Harry put his hand his and they got up, and dried themselves with those huge fluffy towels, Draco reserved for his special self-care days.
Draco slapped him on his chest, but smiled. “If you insist on calling me that, I will think of something to call you too.”,
“I guess we should get going, don’t we?”
He started kissing down Draco’s stomach to the brim of his panties. He started licking the cum from between the black lace. In the meantime, Draco sought out Harry’s pants and began opening first his buckle and then his pants. He soon realized that Harry wasn’t wearing any sort of underwear. He took out Harry’s cock and started slowly wanking it to full hardness. Harry got Draco out of his leather pants and rid himself of his skin tight jeans. He lay back down to Draco, cuddling into Draco’s overly large cardigan.
And Harry began letting go, he folded Draco in half and pushed his cock as deep in Draco as he could, prolonging Draco’s orgasm with mildly moving the rod inside his urethra.
“Who would have thought, the both of us ending up in the middle of the night in a bathtub, after fucking two nights in a row, would be the best thing that happened to me in a long time.”
“Yeah, you’re right, come on”
Putting new sheets on his bed, he left the bedroom. Taking his coat from the rack he got out the door and walked to a nearby apparition point and disappeared with a pop.
“Or you could just give me the name of the restaurant?”
They stumbled inside, still kissing each other fervently. Harry quickly carried Draco over to his bedroom, getting rid of his shoes and Draco’s jacket on the way.
A strong arm was wrapped around Draco’s waist and he was pulled under the shower spray, a hot series of kisses was placed over his neck and his face. Harry felt himself getting hard, by the power Draco gave him.
Nah, not really, but thanks for checking in. Sleep tight.
“Rimming”, Draco wondered aloud, “makes sense.”
And like that they fell asleep.
Remembering the way Malfoy tensed up, shortly before his orgasm, the way those light-grey eyes focused in on Harry. He thought about the few glimpses of Malfoy’s cock that he got walking over to the dancefloor. The way those long and elegant fingers held the stem of his glass. The way his lips curled when he said ‘Potter’.
He had to pause and concentrate, not to come too fast.
He got out of bed opening the window and letting the fresh air stream inside. The warm summer air filled his lungs and he breathed in deeply.
Before the alarm for his Pizza went off, he heard the bell from the elevator chiming, unsure of who that might be he put his leather pants on and opened the elevator. The open doors revealed a tousled looking Harry, with red cheeks and snowflakes on his hair, scarf and jacket. ”What are you doing here?”, Draco said, completely taken by surprise, about Harry’s unannounced presence. “Is that how you greet all your guests?”, Harry asked, inviting himself in. ”Not necessarily, but first of all I don’t receive many guests, and second of all I didn’t expect you coming over, before you even called.”,”Well I thought I could just as well check-in in person, but I can leave if you’re not in the mood for company ? Just wanted to make sure you’re alright after our rather intense last night.”, “That’s very nice of you, and of course you can stay, if you want. Just had a pretty crappy day. Have you already eaten? I can get you a pizza in the oven, along with mine?”, “No, not hungry, but thanks.”, they went and sat down on the sofa, next to each other. Just then the timer for the pizza went off, and Draco went to the kitchen to get it.” You want anything to drink?”,”Yes, please. Whatever you’re having is fine.”, “Alright, coming right up.”,”You do realize your sweater is kind of see-through,yes?”,”Yes, I certainly do. You gave me quite the fright, ringing that late in the evening. To be honest, I wasn’t even wearing any pants until a few minutes ago.”,”Don’t keep it up on my account.”,”Well, fine if you say so”, he put his pants off, took the plate with his pizza on it and went over to the couch, sitting down, next to Harry.
When paying close attention, he could see one of Draco’s hands circling his rim and the other one massaging his balls. He completed the play by softly cradling his cock, making a few strokes up and down. The hands playing with his balls were moved away and he angled his pelvic, so that Harry had easier access.
“Everything alright? What’s going on?”, “ Well that sometimes happens when I came real hard or was a bit too deep into my head. But don’t worry I live right across the street, I can get home alone as soon as I feel steady, you can get going, you must be freezing.”,
“We can stop if I want to, right?”, Draco asked after thinking about it for a while.
Slightly pushing against his cock, he moved it inside his hole. It felt amazing, finally having a cock inside him, and feeling his velvety insides on his sensible cockhead. The forbidden feeling of it only added to his arousal.
He started frotting against him, slowly and trying first but when Harry moved his other hand from his waist under the cardigan all the way to his back, he stopped second-guessing what he was doing and just went with it. Harry’s fingers were cold at first but after he pushed his hand inside his jeans and panties, they gradually warmed up. He grabbed his left arse cheek and massaged it with his hand as good as he could while Draco pushed his cock against Harry’s through their trousers.
They stopped a few times to kiss some more, but continued making their way along the street.
“I can see that. You mentioned going to France later this week, so I suppose that’s one of the other places you’re talking about?”
Since he had over an hour left, he decided to draw himself a bath. One of the reasons he had fallen in love with this appartement was the separate and very spacious bathroom, with its large windows and the skylight above the bathtub. A citrusy scented essential oil seemed to be the right choice for the early spring evening.
“Why didn’t you just pull it out?”, Harry asked
“Two days in a row, doesn’t seem much like a coincidence, don’t you think?”, Harry said.
He felt his prick swelling under the sheets.
He got up and silently slid into his walk-in closet picking up a fresh set of lace panties, in a dark blue today, dark-grey dress pants and a light-blue shirt. He took his clothing and, without disturbing Harry, went to the bathroom. After using the loo and brushing his teeth he thought about the plug, still stretching and grazing his prostate with every move. He decided to leave it for now and after several refreshment charms, he put his clothes on. Going into the kitchen, he packed his lunch and threw two pieces of toast into the toaster. He ate them, while skimming over the files of the first client he had scheduled for today. After finishing his toast, he thought about Harry, and whether he should wake him, but decided against it. He wrote a quick note, and went to his bedroom to leave it for him.
After stretching the insides for a while, he opted to go deeper instead. A new portion of lube now coating his wrist made his descend into Draco’s body  go smoother.
He paused for a second, taking in the view of Draco, laying on his grey sheets. His hair laying wildly around his head and only his arms were covered by the shirtsleeves. A hint of his abdominal muscle showing under his fair skin, his shaved, pink cock pulsating in the air.
“Always”
Thinking about how the years had passed, having quit his job at the aurors, taking up his passion of teaching as a part-time DADA teacher at Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and Ilvermony, giving courses at the local BDSM club and travelling the most unlikely places on his weeks off. He had flats all over the club but London and especially his flat in Soho, he called home.
It just didn’t seem to fit when an idea popped inside his head. He scrambled through his nightstand drawer, finding what he was looking. A bottle of oil, originally used for wax play and a douche with a pump ball he had never used.
Harry moaned silently, and Draco continued his way up to the source. He attached his lips to Harry’s hole and sucked.
They walked a few buildings down the street, turned to the right, and there they were. In front of Bill & Fleur’s restaurant. In the entryway a waitress asked them for their coats, and brought them to their table in a separated booth in the far left corner. Piano music was playing softly in the background.
Draco’s cock had already started leaking precum in a steady stream. It only took a few strokes from Harry’s hand and Draco was coming, throwing his head back and moaning Harry’s name.
“Didn’t seem like a very longtermed relationship from my point of view, but if you say so.”
Draco looked at him with huge eyes, only slightly blushed and smiled broadly at him.
“Do you think you can walk?”, Harry asked. Draco who was shaking the glass in his hand, slowly shook his head, so Harry picked him back up and carried him to the big bathroom.
As soon as Harry let go of his cock, Draco’s tongue was on it, cleaning it with kitten like licks.
“Alright, kitten.”, Draco blushed and turned over to hit Harry on his arm, but Harry caught him and pulled him close for a very soft kiss.
“Never be embarrassed, it’s only your mind limiting your options.”
The sponge, Harry had brought, was dipped into the hot water and spread some sort of soapy cream across Draco’s chest, his breaths becoming deeper and slower. When every inch of Draco’s body was washed, Harry dipped his hand under the water, cautiously touching the plug, still stretching Draco’s hole.
Dinner went by without much talking. They enjoyed their food a great deal and after eating all 5 courses they both felt rather full.
“Alright, you may cum when you can.”, Harry said, stopping the stimulation of his cock entirely, only squeezing his balls in the palm of his hand.
Harry nearly came from the view he was granted. The pink plug sat snuggly in Draco’s clean shaved hole, covered in sticky, shiny cum. He stretched his tongue out, anxious for his first taste of there combined body fluids.
Fortunately, time passed faster in the afternoon and he was on his way home sooner then expected. After taking the elevator into his flat he realized that he could still smell Harry in the air. His minty, fresh, and clean smell lay in the air like an afterthought.
During that time, he also realized he was gay, which made him go to that club in the first place.
“Are you asking for permission or are you asking whether it’s possible?”, Harry asked back.
“Do you want to touch ?”
stomach and Harry seemed to be talking to him.
Harry slid down a few inches, kneeling between Draco’s legs. He put Draco’s foots on their soles, as far apart as possible and grabbed the lube from the nightstand.
He dozed off for another hour and when he woke up again, he got up searching for his clothes. He found his shirt on the couch along with his jeans and boots. He started the coffee machine, while returning to the bedroom, searching for his socks. He looked through the sheets, and along the floor but didn’t seem to find them. He went to the bathroom to use the loo and found them laying in front of the bathtub. He cleaned his teeth using his finger and looked through Draco’s excessive assortment of creams and beauty products. He also found several skin care products and decided to try them on his eyeliner. It was a magical brand, that didn’t smudge overnight or on long nights out. None of them worked so he decided cleaning it off with magic, even though he always got dry eyes when doing that. Since he was also in desperate need of a shower after cuddling a sweat-soaked Draco all night he pushed several buttons on the rain-shower and after a few minutes, he seemed to get the hang of it. The problem with it was, that it was one of those spiral stonewall kind of showers, with the buttons on the outside. So he always had to go back and forth, until he found the right setting.
The kiss was getting deeper now and he could feel Harrys hand wandering from his shoulder to his cheek, to the nape of his neck. His tongue was doing wicked things in his mouth, it was like he wanted to learn every detail.
Harry nodded and lifted Draco up, kissing him on the nose. “Of course, kitten”,
Harry leaned down to whisper in Draco’s ear, “You alright with this?”,
“The same you are I presume”
The day went by and he was getting hungry, so he got in the kitchen, making himself a few tortellini with a creamy cheese sauce and peas. He enjoyed it while watching something on his television.
He handed Draco the plug, and helped him place it inside, without letting any cum escape.
Draco didn’t answer, but continued to explore Harry’s inside. Since it felt quite good, Harry leaned back and enjoyed the explorations. After a while Draco asked,
He whimpered and mewled, taking his other hand and stroking his cock rapidly.
“I slept pretty long, and when I left I went directly to the uni. Since it is Saturday,I only had two classes that afternoon, so a pretty easy day. After that I spend some time marking essays for next week’s class. I was done real quick, since it is only a small course. I went home, to eat something, and then I thought of you. I wanted to see you again.”, “Well, you could have called, you know.”,”Yeah, but I ain’t such a big fan of phones, so impersonal, you know?”, “If you say so.”,”And I figured, on Sunday you must be free, right? So, I thought maybe you would like to spend the day with me?”, “You figured right”, Draco answered grinning. He took the last piece of his pizza, and chewed thoughtfully. “So what did you think we might do?”,”Well, I don’t know yet, but maybe we could sleep in, take a long bath, have breakfast and see what the day will bring.”,”Sounds good to me”, Draco answered, taking his plate to the kitchen. “Join me to bed ?”, Draco asked ”I would love to”, Harry answered, getting up from the couch and walking to Draco, but Draco started running along the corridor, Harry chased after him, caught him and picked him up from around his hips and threw him over his shoulder, and Draco protested, trying to wiggle himself free but to no avail. Harry carried him threw the door and threw him on the bed. They were giggling loudly, Harry jumped on Draco tickling him all over, Draco squirmed on the bed but stayed put under Harry.
“Both, I guess?”
“Before it starts getting to sappy I should better get going.”, Draco said and got up.
“If you think that is a new world, then I can’t wait for you’re opinions on what’s to come. But to answer you’re original questions, yes I would let you fuck me, although I’ve got to tell you, I don’t receive as much pleasure out of it as you do.”
“One can do that, but the question is, do you want to? It is quite painful at first, and it stays loose for a few hours, you know.”, Harry answered, unsure, whether Draco was aware of what he was asking him.
“Good morning, daddy. That does look divine.”, Draco greeted him, with a wink.
“And making out in an alley is way classier, you think?”,
The first time Harry saw Draco after the trials, was in a muggle club in Soho.
All of a sudden Draco stilled and his moaning stopped.
Hope you enjoyed the story so far. X
But it didn’t took long until Draco went from relaxed to horny. Harry was working on the angle to get it fully inside Draco’s bladder, so that it could press directly against his prostate, but Draco already squirmed so much it took him a few tries to get it right.
He turned around, he remembered as if it was yesterday, he dropped the pack of potatoes in his hand as he saw her face. Her eyes sparkled as they only do when she had had a very good day and there were several hickeys looking out from under her collar. She tried to feign innocence, but she realized that Draco had seen the man climbing down the tree. And that was the day when he realized his wife had an affair with his ex-boyfriend. And how to tell that to his parents he hasn’t figured out by now. He was sure they would encourage him to make it work regardless, at least to keep up appearances.
He fully leaned back, Dildo still inside him, watching the jets washing the hot cum away. He didn’t feel like slipping the dildo out quite yet, so he started washing the rest of his body with some of Draco’s expensive looking body foam. It smelled citrusy – just like him. After having nothing left to do, he slowly slid the dildo out of his arse, feeling empty already. He put two fingers inside, feeling his hole slowly closing, the gaping around empty air making him feel uncomplete. He disinfected the dildo and went outside to turn the shower of.
Harry woke up several hours later, from the sun tickling his nose. The snow outside still hadn’t faded and so the room seemed to be glowing white. He turned, searching for Draco, but found the bed to be cold. He looked up, seeing a note on the nightstand: ‘Sorry, I had to go to work. I enjoyed last night very much. If you want, give me a call. 310-356-3710. Coffee, tea and toast is in the kitchen, help yourself.”, after reading the note, Harry turned around, cuddling in Draco’s pillow. Inhaling his scent.
Harry went and sat down, and Draco pulled him down on his collar and kissed him hard. Harry put his hand on Draco’s stomach and reciprocated the kiss.
He relaxed back into the large tub and breathed in deeply. It had been a nice day enjoying the weather, getting things done in regards of his markings and the evening promised to be entertaining in the least.
Since he wasn’t a big fan of orgasming standing up, he sat down on the bottom of the shower. He leaned back against the wall and pushed his feet on the shower glass, far apart so that he had enough room to fuck his fingers back inside himself.
“Tell me if it get’s too much” Harry whispered, and kissed the shell of his ear.
“I moved in a flat here about two weeks ago. Unpacking was a real pain in the arse but now I am beginning to explore the area, so that could also be the reason.”
“Yeah, you were pretty knocked out.”
“No, don’t worry, everything was perfect.”, Draco interrupted him, still feeling around inside Harry’s hole.
Hours went by unnoticed, as he made his way through stacks of essays and tests, the sun wandering across the horizon. It started getting colder and he realized it was already half past 5. He collected his stuff and put it on the dining room table.
“5…4….3…2…1”, on one he pushed, with a little added force, past the tight muscle.
“I won’t, don’t you worry.”, Harry answered, pulled all the way out and rammed it hard back inside. Draco nearly screamed with pleasure, trying to reach down for his cock, but Harry held his hands tightly against the mattress. He fucked into him relentlessly, Draco pulled his legs further up, and Harry hung them over his arms, folding Draco in half.
“Yeah, but stay anyway.”, “I don’t think that’s a good idea”,
Because of the width, Harry couldn’t reach as far inside, but the stretch alone seemed to satisfy Draco for the moment. Draco’s pushing back got more, and, in his pleading voice, he asked for another one.
“If done stuff with girls, not with myself. Didn’t thought it would make that much of a difference.”, he said, slowly looking back up.
“Well, yeah” Draco said, “it somehow felt right.”. Harry grinned widely, softly touching the gem, that was pressed snuggly against Draco’s hole.
“Yes Daddy I am fine, could you please move?”
The next morning, Draco woke up, startled by the noise of his alarm clock, his brain went into overdrive, trying to process the events of the evening prior. When he felt his heartrate slowly normalizing he registered an arm hugging him tight to a warm body behind him. He tried extracting himself, without waking up Harry, who seemed to be fast asleep, despite the alarm.
“Of course, haven’t you ever tried?”
When he felt relaxed enough, he slid one then two fingers inside, eager to put his cock there. He fucked his fingers in and out quickly, scissoring and turning them, to stretch his rim as quick as possible.
Then he leaned down, licking all the cum from Draco’s chest, following it up until he reached his face. He licked his chin and cheeks clean, until all that was left was his lips. He dived tongue first inside his mouth and licked over Draco’s tongue tasting the remainders of the cum.
When they caught their breaths, Harry stopped the still vibrating plug, with a wandless Finite Incantatem.
“Yes, I’ve got one in Place Cachée in Paris, one in the outbacks of Norway, one in Massachusetts and one in Hogsmeade, although I must admit that the one in Hogsmeade is a shared space since I ain’t there that often.”
“Would you let me fuck you?”,
“You have to tell me those things, if we aren’t honest with each other we can’t keep doing this. It’s not working for me that way.”
“Well, I suppose you could call it stalking.”, Draco answered sarcastically.
“Go on boy, make you’re daddy cum.”, he commanded. And Draco complied repeating the previously taught motion fast and hard.
After spending a few hours marking theses from his Durmstrang students, he changed into his pajamas, lit a fire and grabbed the book from his nightstand to read in front of the fire.
He turned the corner to walk in the direction of his building, when a hand grabbed him and pulled him into an alley. He tried to scream but his mouth was soon covered with warm, soft lips. He opened his eyes to see that it was Harry who he had talked to moments prior.
Theo who'd fucked him all the way through last year.
Harry soon began to feel the effects of the fire whiskey, everything felt a little lighter and there was a strange sort of haze filling his brain.
He didn’t speak to anyone, didn’t let himself stop until he reached the nearest bathroom.
Ron paled and looked at the floor bashfully. "Well I didn't know that did I?"
Draco had always been good at potions. Perhaps it was natural talent or the way Severus had been training him since he could carry a cauldron, but he'd always had an affinity to the subject. The only person who'd ever even gotten close to rivalling his grades was Granger. Perhaps that was why Skyes had thought it would be prudent to pair the two of them up.
Seamus pushed his chin up, voice challenging. “Why? Got a problem with that?”
“That was mental.” Harry observed. “I won’t lose my magic if I break that, will I?”
"You've got to be joking!" Draco exclaimed at the same time Pansy rolled her eyes.
“What are you doing here?” Harry growled, fingers tensing around the sides of the chair.
“It wouldn’t work Harry. I mean, almost everyone can be taught basic Occlumency but Legilimency is far more complex and it’s rare for someone to be able to master it. They probably think you could can handle it because of the link between you and Voldemort.” She explained.
But then I went to Hogwarts and was suddenly surrounded by the people I’d be warned against my entire life. It was quite the culture shock to be perfectly honest. I was all set to play the part of the perfect Malfoy heir, when all of a sudden there’s this tiny boy with the most infuriatingly messy hair and clothes three sizes too big for him who everyone’s fawning over instead. You might not believe this but I was actually incredibly excited to meet you.”
- attention.
"I'll be fine Ron!" He heard Granger hiss from the other side of the classroom and he repressed the desire to roll his eyes. If anyone was in danger, it was him- his nose still hadn't recovered from it's meeting with the girls fist.
"Can you blame them?" She raised an eyebrow and he swallowed heavily, hating the trickle of shame which filled him at her words.
She smiled, unaware of the confused looks being shot her way by everyone in the carriage. "Draco's my cousin. We owl a lot."
Typical.
The war was over, the dead weren’t going to come back and choices had already been made. What was the point of falling back into the patterns which had started everything in the first place? He was so damn tired of holding onto this resentment.
“I meant- well obviously I hated you but I sort of respected you at the same time.” He said quickly, but Harry had the strangest feeling that he wasn’t telling the full truth. “Anyway, we’re getting off topic. Two days before the end of fifth year, my mother took me out of school unexpectedly, but instead of taking me back to the manor, we went to a house we owned in Italy. It was there that she told me that Voldemort was staying in my home and that I was going to become a Death Eater. It wasn’t a surprise, I knew he was back and that it was just a matter of time.” He laughed bitterly. “Do you know, I was almost excited? I thought, ‘Here’s the chance I’ve been waiting for, now my father will finally have a son he can be proud of.’ I felt that way for about a month. Then I realised I was trapped. I had nowhere to go, no one I could ask for help-“
A few carriages down sat Draco Malfoy himself, stretched out across the plush velvet seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson's lap. Blaise Zabini occupied the other side, leisurely resting his long legs on Draco.
"We are talking about the same man who faked all of his achievements and then tried to obliviate the both of us right?" Harry said, raising his eyebrows at Ron who shifted guiltily.
Malfoy! I’ve been focusing this whole bloody time!” Harry bit back furiously, the frustration that had been slowly building inside of him for the past hour finally reaching breaking point. “Did you ever think that maybe it’s your fault not mine?”
"I thought as much. Well as it happens they've got much larger plans for you now."
"It doesn't have to be some ploy. I'm suggesting we make a genuine effort. That way our actions will look natural. They have the most influence, especially Potter and his crew. Going against them would be publicly painting a target on our backs. " Blaise replied cooly, and its moments like these where Draco can see his mother coming out in him.
Harry had the feeling that he was on the losing side of this particular battle and sighed heavily. "Fine. But who would teach me anyway?"
However, what he was not expecting to see, was Draco Malfoy strolling in, glancing around the classroom with a critical eye.
There was a moment of silence before Ron interrupted it with a sudden thought. "Wait, surely Malfoy's not back?"
Harry settled in the chair, relaxing his mind as best he could. He began to visualise a lake, cool and glittering when the sun hit it at certain angles. Malfoy had explained to him earlier that it helped to create a space for your mind to go to when starting out, like a waiting room between your thoughts. If anything went wrong, that was the place to go back to.
“Cowardly, vile scum. They should have given you the kiss, no one would miss you, not even your whore of a mother.”
“No. I used the tongue-tying one so you won’t be able to break it all, your worlds will get all jumbled up if you try.” Malfoy said, sitting across the chair with his legs hanging off the side. “Alright Potter, same time next week?”
Harry suddenly felt a random burst of resentment towards Luna and Malfoy. So he'd taken the time to apologise to her? And not him? How many more of his friends were secretly bonding with Malfoy?
Seamus and Dean took great pleasure in teasing him about the teachers blatant display of favouritism but Harry was secretly suspicious that she was trying to train him up as the next defence teacher. He’d be lying if he said the idea wasn’t tempting, he’d forgotten the way it felt to teach, to see when someone finally managed the spell they’d be struggling with or the adrenaline which flowed through him during a duel. Maybe he was missing the DA more than he had realised.
The last time he'd seen him was across the courtroom at his trial. Malfoy had looked younger than he'd done in years, his face pale and hollow with dark circles under his eyes as though he hadn't sleep in days. There was something haunted in his expression, Sirius had it too. It was the look of someone who'd spend too long in Azkaban.
It was a movement which Hermione clearly didn't miss, tugging his arm back. "Come on Harry, let's try to have a year free from Malfoy obsession."
"A speech? No but I'm sure that can be arranged if you wish."
"What the fuck did you just say?" Millies voice was like ice and Draco remembered with a jolt that she had lost her little brother in the war.
“We were just discussing our plans for after school.” Luna dressed them with a strange sort of familiarity, and Harry realised that this wasn’t her first conversation with the trio, if the fond look in Malfoy’s eye was anything to go by. “What are you lot thinking of doing?”
Draco sped up, willing his feet to move faster- to outrun them. His fingers curved instinctively around his wand, it would be so easy to turn around and jinx that smirk off Zacharius Smith’s stupid face. But his mother's voice reverberated in his head, begging him not to give the Ministry more ammunition. To them it wouldn’t be self-defence, it would be the last stop on the road back to Azkaban.
He repeated like a mantra, focusing all of his attention instead on the water. The feeling of it between his toes, the rays of sun on his back. The surface rippled and he knew Malfoy was there too, that he’d finally managed to enter Harry’s mind.
She moved away from the board and they all surged forward, desperate to get a look at who they would be forced to share a room with for the rest of the year. Harry found himself being pushed to the front, where he spotted his name easily.
It took weeks for Draco to function properly again, weeks of waking up screaming, drenched in his own sweat with Pansy held him close and Blaise made tea. He wouldn't have survived without them. The pain subsided eventually, he stopped having panic attacks every time he saw a dark hood in public or flinching whenever a wand was raised. It happened bit by bit and then all at once. His humour came back, his appearance improved- he felt like himself again.
Harry didn’t have a clue what that meant but Seamus seemed to understand perfectly, letting out a shout of amusement and clapping the blonde on the back.
Draco’s blood went cold, his heart hammering with panic and bile began to rise in his throat. He was trapped again, trapped like a canary in a coal mine or a sparrow in a vanishing cabinet.
“Should we…you know…invite them over?” Hermione asked softly, looking around the table to gauge the reactions of the others.
Theo who'd told him he loved him.
Harry developed a certain routine over the next few weeks. He would wake early, determined to spend as little time around his new roommates as possible and meet Ron and Hermione in great hall for breakfast. They had discovered that by eating early, they would manage to dodge the crowds of younger students who like ambush them right when they were least expecting it. The novelty of going to school with
and Ron asking
Potter.” Malfoy said, looking as though he was trying very hard not to hit him. “For the vow.”
“Really Potter, I thought we’d moved past this. It’s not poison I promise.”
“Dumbledore!” Harry cut across him. “Dumbledore offered you help.”
"It's nice isn't it?" She said as they sat down next to her. "Does yours also have the ceiling?"
“Um yeah probably. I’ve got Grimmauld place waiting for me so I won’t have to worry about houses.”
“Trust me, Potter. It’ll be worse for me than it is for you. You’ll be practising in my head after all.” Malfoy assured him, and he couldn’t help but feel a slight bolt of curiosity at the idea of seeing some of the things Malfoy might keep hidden. “I suggest that we both make a vow, so we can’t tell anyone else anything that we may see in the other's mind to someone else.”
As if one cue, the common room door opened and the golden trio walked in, completely unnerved by the way the Slytherins bust into hysteria at their entrance.
He ignored her, instead leaning down to whisper in Draco’s ear. “You better look out scum, because when no one’s watching, I’m going to rip you to fucking shreds.”
Draco seemed farer gone that ever but when Harry passed his pelvic bone from the inside, and his the silhouette of his face shone through Draco’s abdominal skin, his panting and babbling became erratic. He started scrambling again, but every move he made was followed by a long moan, since he was rubbing his prostate against the far diameter of Harry’s lower arm.
“I thought you said you did this before?!”, Harry asked in surprise.
Today he hadn’t brought home any take-out, since he had wanted to get home as fast as possible. He put the dirty dishes from the morning in the dish-washer and realized, that Harry must have eaten something before leaving, so he must have felt comfortable being alone in his flat. His mind slowed done a little at that thought. After starting the dish-washer he set the oven to pre-heat and went to the bathroom, cleaning charms just weren’t the same as a real shower. He remembered the reason why he got so sweaty in the first place and felt the plug sitting snug at his hole, slightly grazing his prostate. He thought about pulling it out before showering, but decided against it.
Harry smiled at that. His cock was already rock hard since he hadn’t cum all evening. He put some lube on his free hand and started playing with his own hole, looking Draco straight in the eye all the while.
The lube seemed pretty cold, so Harry put a warming charm on it, before letting a generous amount run down Draco’s perineum on the finger he had already inserted in the still loose hole. A second and third finger soon followed and he was moving them in and out in a quick motion, making sure to graze Draco’s prostate on every second stroke.
Draco picked out a box from the drawer of his nightstand and offered it to Harry. Harry took and opened it. He looked at the different sounding rods and quickly decided for on one of the medium width Van Burren sounds, since Draco’s cock didn’t seemed to be hard by now. He showed it to Draco, questioningly, and when Draco nodded, he put it aside and sprayed it with disinfectant.
Draco’s face lay on his shoulder, eyes closed and a content smile on his face.
“No, it’s alright, just didn’t expect it, is all.”, Draco answered, the panic in his eyes calming a little.
When he felt the stream from Draco’s hole coming to an end, he put two fingers of his other hand inside, forcing the hole to gape open with a scissoring motion, making sure nothing was left inside.
“Maybe I should take a closer look at what seems to be the problem”
“17th, but it’s fine you can go.”,
He watched for a few seconds, taking in how much Malfoy had changed in the last few years. His face, and skin looked as young as ever, but his appearance was way more mature than it used to be.
Harry laughed, but accompanied Draco to the door. Unsure what would be the appropriate way to say goodbye to a former school nemesis, now guy he had slept with, he decided for a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. Draco seemed to find that appropriate, since he reciprocated it.
“Well I am into experimenting since I moved in here. Sue me.”, Draco answered.
“Daddy, let me cum, make me cum hard, pleeeeaaase.”, he said, looking up at Harry.
He dried himself with the fluffy, oversized towel from the night before, and got dressed. Back in the kitchen he filled himself a cup of coffee and put two slices of bread in the toaster. After they were done he put some jam on them and ate them strolling through the flat. As he didn’t pay much attention to the flat last night he discovered that it was way bigger than it seemed to be at first sight. There was a rather large dining room behind the kitchen, also there were two more rooms on the corridor leading to the bed- and bathroom. On the left side there was a completely empty room, it also had huge windows overlooking the city. On the opposite side was a room that seemed to be used as a makeshift office. There were several stacks of files, placed on a large desk facing another glass wall, overlooking the city.
They were laying sideways facing each other, kissing and groping, touching and moaning. Pressing his cock against Draco’s Harry started pushing Draco’s panties further down, so that he had good access to his soft buttocks. He started massaging and squeezing it in random patterns. Draco seemed to enjoy that very much, so he searched out his hole and after circling it for a while he put his middle finger in the center and started pushing rhythmically with the thrusts of his cock. He alternated between kissing Draco and nibbling along his jawline. Draco nearly felt overwhelmed with being touched in all the right places, he alternated between pushing back against the finger massaging, only slightly breaching his hole, and pushing forth to get more friction on his cock. They rocked like that for a while, until neither of them could stand it any longer. Harry tucked his cock underneath Draco’s balls and between his legs and came. As Draco felt Harry’s huge cock pulsating on his balls and his perineum he began shuddering and came all over his cardigan and both their stomachs, moaning Harry’s name. They lay there spend for some minutes or hours, time seemed to float by. After they came back to themselves Draco suggested a bath.
“Well, maybe. I really enjoyed it too, just so you know. But about the fucking myself I might take you up on that idea.”
He washed his hair and soaped up his body, still thinking about Draco the night before. While cleaning up his crack he pushed one finger inside. Enjoying the feeling of his tight hole, imagining it was Malfoy that he pushed inside.
“Alright”, Harry said and continued his motion, folding both his hands together with Draco’s on the bed. When he bottomed out, he leaned down and kissed Draco softly. “You are so tight, it feels amazing how your hot wet channel grabs my cock. And every time you moan or talk it is like the most intimate massage. You’re doing amazing.”, Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. It made him blush a deep crimson red, but he didn’t stop looking up into Harry’s eyes.
“Hello Potter, fancy meeting you here.”
Harry made a O shaped ring around the base of Draco’s balls, squeezing them lightly. The mixture of the pain and pleasure seemed to turn Draco on, so Harry took both balls in his hand and squeezed them rhythmically, along with his hand moving up and down Draco’s cock.
“Good boy. You have been so good, thank you. I am so proud of you, enduring all that prostate torture, and keeping all my cum hot for me. You have been so good.”, Harry rambled, falling into his praising habit, wanting to make sure he got his appreciation across.
When he let the spent cock slip from his mouth, he accioed a small silicone plug, together with its remote. He held it up, silently asking for permission. Draco still in post-orgasm state nodded lightly.
“Leaving you alone for 5 minutes to get coffee and breakfast was not an invitation to go through my things Potter.” Draco drawled sounding only mildly irritated.
“I would rather not.” Harry said, sounding pained.
One night close to graduation, most of the returning class had gone out on the weekend to celebrate the nearing end of the year.  A lot of alcohol was involved and when they had made it back to their room Harry had kissed Draco.  It hadn’t been a deep kiss, just a spontaneous moment of joy that Harry hadn’t felt in a long time and had wanted to share.  It had felt...right.  But when Harry had pulled back to look at Draco expecting to see his joy mirrored in Draco’s eyes, instead Draco stepped away with a look of betrayal on his face.  “Don’t do that.”  Were the words he had used, without elaborating he had left Harry standing alone.  The next morning neither one mentioned what had happened the night before and Harry had never done that again.  No matter how many moments, like the one now he wanted to.  Instead he satisfied himself with brushing the hair out of Draco’s face and tracing the line of his cheek down to his jaw.
Potter let out a sigh of frustration. Honestly, he needed a keeper. Someone that wouldn’t let him leave the house wearing...well anything he owned. Draco had turned down every suggestion Potter had made for good reason.  “Your input is valued, Potter.” Draco gave Potter a light pat on the shoulder, letting his fingers linger slightly. “You just need a point in the right direction.”
“Of course”, Harry said and smiled broadly, “I really enjoyed it too, I am glad I ran into you the other day.”
“I don’t know.”, Draco admitted, blushing and turning his face down.
“Technically there wasn’t that much fucking involved yet”, Harry answered with a smirk.
Harry gaped at him, then smiled.
He felt his channel pulsating around his cock, Draco stimulating his prostate in an unrelenting rhythm. His cock started pumping hot cum inside his arse and he was screaming Draco’s name, with it.
When half an hour was over the rational side of his brain took over and reasoned, that if it was vibrating, he would have written by now. So he put out the television and went to his bedroom, throwing his shirt in the laundry room, when he heard a knock on the door. Checking the time he walked over to the door, looking through the peep hole he saw a very worried looking Draco in a large grey coat standing outside. He grinned to himself and opened the door,
He closed the distance between them and greeted Malfoy with a wave of his hand.
He could feel Draco still playing with his swollen rim, after a while of their combined play, Draco started moaning and moving with Harry’s strokes.
“Fine I guess I’ve got some time left, but I need to use the loo first.”
He carefully picked up the sound and put lube on it. With his other hand he took Draco’s member and slowly positioned the J-shaped end of the rod at the tip of it. After the first few millimeters he felt Draco flexing his muscles, so he paused, looking up at Draco until he seemed to relax a bit. He started going deeper, knowing full well how it felt in the first few minutes.
"Well yeah, obviously he was a massive prat and all...but selling your autographs might not be a half-bad idea. I'm sure there are kids out there who'd be willing to fork out a couple of galleons for one."
“I can neither confirm nor deny that.” He told her, but there was a telling glint in his eye. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see you running for Minister in the next couple of years Granger.”
Harry gaped at him slightly. “Are we…are we not going to talk about it?”
"I believe they're worried about you being taken advantage of. Being a legillimens would allow you  to uncover the true motives behind certain individuals action. I really must agree with them, it's a wonderful tool."
Blaise chuckled. "It's a shame we're not rallying against them this year. I feel a second verse of Weasley is our king just bursting out of me."
She’d mentioned something about Malfoy, Greengrass and Nott as well, hadn’t she? It only strengthened Harry’s theory that there was tension between the three of them and he subconsciously filed that fact away in his mind, to ponder at a later time.
“What’s going on here?” It was a new voice, angry and authoritative.
"Oh, I've heard of her! She played for the Hollyhead Harpies before becoming a teacher!" Ginny exclaimed, looking at the new professor starry eyed.
"Well, there's certainly no need to sound so disappointed Granger." They whirled around to where Pansy Parkison was stood, eyes glittering mischievously. "I'm sure we'll have a wail of a time."
Harry just ignored her, instead opting to cut up his chicken with a little more force than necessary. Ginny slid her hand under the table, wrapping their fingers together. It doesn't give him the butterflies it used to, nor does it bring him any warmth. Instead, a prickle of irritation ran down his spine. That had been happening a lot lately. He loved Ginny, he really did. She's perfect for him, everyone said so. She was gorgeous and funny and loving her was easy. And easy is all Harry needed at the moment. Molly's had already begun dropping engagement hints at every opportunity she got.
"Do shut up Blaise." He still refused to meet Harry's eyes. "You'll scare the saviour."
"Excellent. I'll make sure Mr Creswell keeps you updated."
“Oh erm right.” Harry gulped. “I do. And do you, Draco Malfoy, swear not to divulge any memories or emotions that you may encounter in Harry Potter’s mind during these lessons?”
"Are younger students allowed in?" The question came from Susan Bones who Harry knew had a sister in the fifth year.
The ministry had been eager to swipe him up as quickly as possible, they loved the idea of Harry being their poster boy- to use him as a way of fixing their rocky reputation. They wanted him to attend fundraisers and give interviews to the prophet on their behalf, to stand up and defend them. In their eyes, he was the perfect puppet. Because if the boy who lived said the ministry was doing good work- well the rest of the world would follow.
Hermione looked horrified. "But Luna, they kept you captive in their basement!"
Ron crossed his arms moodily, "They were being prats."
If Harry didn't know any better, he would say that this years feast being based entirely around his favourite foods was just a coincidence. However, he does know better and after seeing twelve enormous treacle tarts on the Gryffindor table alone, as well as all his favourite side dishes, he is growing slightly suspicious.
“Aren’t you that kid who trailed around after me all of sixth year?” He drawled, with as much dignity one can muster when pinned to a wall. “Like a little puppy?”
“Talk about what Potter?” Malfoy said, so offhandedly that Harry would think they had just witnessed a completely different thing if it wasn’t for the way that Malfoy’s hand’s were shaking slightly.
“Seriously? No comment about the saviours shitty childhood or something like that? I thought you’d love to be able to lord something like that over me.”
Ron faltered a little at this but only for a second. "Well...well Bulstrode didn't need to get her knickers in a twist about it!"
"Ron shut up." Weasley turned to face Granger who had gone very pale.
"Pardon?" Harry spluttered.
Hermione looked vaguely scandalised whilst Neville turned a brilliant shade of pillar-box red. Everyone knew he nursed a soft spot for Luna, who had turned him down gracefully at the start of the summer, saying that she couldn't possibly be in a relationship at that time and besides, Hannah Abbot was interested in him. Neville had taken it fairly well, and last Harry had heard, he'd been writing to Hannah all through the holidays.
Harry nodded slowly at the suggestion, testing out the idea in his head. “Yeah alright. That could work actually.”
“Of course I knew it was you. I would recognise you anywhere.” Malfoy said and Harry felt a slight shiver run down his spine. He was overwhelmed, trying to imagine it from Malfoy’s perspective.
Granger went pink with the praise and Draco couldn't help but feel a slight swell of pride inside of him at the teachers words. Before the war, he'd wanted to play quidditch professionally but now no team would ever allow an ex death eater. Now, his best option was to get a potions mastery and hope someone would take him on as an apprentice.
Unfortunately, Harry didn't hear any more as that was the moment that the common room door opened and he promptly forgot how to breathe.
They pulled up chairs and Harry found himself almost directly opposite Malfoy.
All it took was a few more weeks of Hermione pointing out that
“Obviously not.” He groaned this was the last thing he needed to be dealing with right now. “Look, can you bugger off? I’m waiting for someone.”
“What, that’s it?”
"Harry?" He broke out of his sulk by Hermione, who was watching him with a strange expression on her face. He squirmed under her gaze, feeling like a child who'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
“I wouldn’t have taken you to be the kind of person to hang out in a muggle club on a Saturday night, and least of all alone.”
“Everything alright?”, Harry asked,
In the meantime, Draco made quick work of Harry’s trousers and pushed them down to his knees.
“Stay” Draco repeated.
Draco climbed in after Harry, so that he could sit in front of him and lean onto him. Harry started washing away the cum on Draco’s chest and stomach, after everything seemed clean he went lower and started getting his balls and perineum clean.
After a while they both felt like cumming. Harry turned around again, getting down to work on the butt plug, still in Draco’s arse. In one swift motion he pulled it out, and took it in his mouth, sucking it like the most delicious lollipop, it tasted so intimately like Draco, it was incredible.
“Be my guest Draco answered”, throwing a great arm gesture in the general direction of the night stand. Harry really seemed to consider his offer and, after putting Draco softly on the bed, went to check out his collection. He lifted somethings up, inspected them and put them back down again.
One finger soon became two and then three. He was moaning loudly while fucking inside his own body. His prick had gotten hard again and the 10” sticked proudly out in front of him.
Draco was now squatting over Harry’s face, the cum trickling in a steady stream down into Harry’s mouth.
After moving away from Tori he threw himself in his work and most of the weekday evenings he fell asleep on the couch over several take-out boxes. It was the rare Sunday that he got to enjoy himself, wearing one his corsets, reading a good book by the fire and cooking an extravagant meal just for himself. Those were the days when he sometimes had used his huge Spa bathtub or all the functions of his rain shower. From those days he also had several essential oils nearby, with which he now made a concoction that he poured into the bath water. It was important to not use anything soap based, because the jets would produce so many bubbles that his whole bath would be swimming in them, as he had to learn the hard way.
Draco had his bearings back and swallowed everything Harry had left him. He panted inside Harry’s mouth, being air-deprived from the gagging. Harry cleaned his tongue, gathering every little droplet that was left, finally sucking Draco’s tongue into his mouth.
Draco saw Harry getting unsure, whether he should dress himself or stay stark naked, so Draco made the decision for him. “Carry me to bed?”,
The music was vibrating in the air, hundreds of people moving close to each other on the dancefloor. Harry was sitting at the bar enjoying whatever concoction the cocktail of the evening was, observing the people around him.
He always loved doing it during private wank sessions or before he was married on some crazy nights out in some of the gay clubs. But nowadays he does it everyday and enjoyed it a great deal, on some days when he was wearing big sweaters he also wore some corsets or braletts suiting with the panties. It made a simple Sunday with reading a good book and cooking himself a fancy dinner just that much better. And wanks after a day of secretly wearing corsets all day while meeting clients where just that much hotter.
Harry pressed the button for the elevator, and thankfully no one was inside. They drove up to the 17th floor and they stood in the middle of Draco’s living room.
He had just settled in when his phone rang.
He turned it down to the lowest setting and activated it. He wrote:
He tried to get away, but those lips were to inviting. It was like he was getting warm from the inside.
He started his shower, hopping under it to clean of the stress of the day. As he entered the shower he saw his black dildo hanging from the wall, and while massaging his expensive eucalyptus shampoo into his hair, he wondered whether it was higher on the wall than it usually was. He stood in front of it and decided that it definitely was higher. So, Harry must have used it or at least touched it. He hadn’t realized that someone had used the shower at all, but now that he thought about it, the toy disinfectant had stood outside on the shelf over the sink. Feeling the excitement rising in his belly he knelt down and took the fake-cock into his mouth, and although it tasted mostly like the berry disinfectant, he imagined he could taste Harry on it too. He put his cock in his fist, his other hand reaching back to play with the plug, still inside of him. I didn’t take long for him to cum with the dildo all the way down his throat, tears rolling down his cheek, his hole spasming around the plug and his cock shooting cum all over the wall. He leaned forward, his head pressed against the wall and he breathed deeply, collecting himself from the post-orgasmic bliss.
“If it is in London in the winter, then yes. But to be completely honest I didn’t want to make out. I got so hot seeing those lace panties I could barely talk to you. And then you said those things about your wife and how complicate everything is for you right now; I didn’t want to be just one more complicate thing to add to it. So I wanted to go. Leave. Forget about it. But I couldn’t. I had to wait up for you to at least see where you live. And you looked so damn cute in that cardigan and that thick coat I just had to try and see if you would kiss me back. And you did.”,
“Tastes different then earlier.”, he said, but sucking the fingers inside his mouth nonetheless.
“Against better judgement, I must admit I really enjoyed spending time with you, even apart from the phenomenal sex, of course”, Draco said solemnly.
“I have always been someone to enjoy a good meal.”
“You have done so good, cumming untouched, just from me rubbing your pussy. I am so proud of you. You are daddy’s good little boy”, Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, making him smile broadly.
“More like giving courses and teaching clubs, but yes.”
Unnoticed by Draco’s occupied mind, Harry had slipped four of his fingers, flatly on top of his arm. Contrary to his mind his body had noticed and broke out in a cold sheen of sweat. Harry slip both his arm and fingers another inch deeper inside Draco’s body. After shedding another sheen of sweat Draco’s body seemed conquered and there was urine flowing out of Draco’s momentarily soft cock, soaking the bedding and mattress in pee.
“Do you want to spend the day with me?”, Harry asked.
“So, you have been stalking me.”
He slowly laid down Draco, who was still babbling and squirming and talked silently to him, while holding him tight to his chest. He put blankets over the both of them and waited for Draco to calm down and Draco’s cock to swell down, since he couldn’t remove the rod while his penis was still erect.
When Draco began whining and turning from the need to come, Harry moved his free hand down between Draco’s arse cheeks, rubbing the swollen rim, like a clit, from side to side, roughly.
And then he came. He felt the semen shoot out of his cock, in long spurts. The strokes soon got too much, and he relaxed, enjoying the tingling sensations all over his body.
After a while he realized his eyes starting to drop close, so he got up and held his hand out to Harry, “You coming?”,
After a while he realized he was reading the same sentence over and over without understanding anything. His mind was wandering to Malfoy and that feeling of arousal he felt while watching him being sucked.
Draco froze for a second, then started feeling around inside Harry’s hole.
Someone next to him ordered a glass of Moet, recognizing the posh voice he looked up.
“I moved here after the war ended and never had a reason to move. I am travelling a lot and therefore have several places around the globe but coming here is always like coming home.”
At seven o’clock on the dot, there was a knock on his door, so he went to open it. Draco stood in front of him in dark-grey suit, only showing the collar of his white shirt. The hole outfit complimented his fair skin astonishingly well. His hair was tucked up in a neat bun on top of his head. His grey eyes sparkling with the reflecting lights from his flat.
Draco slowly began eating his pizza. It was a classic Margherita, but from a fancy brand, so it did taste pretty good. Harry just looked at him, and since that made him uncomfortable, he asked him about his day.
When he slipped fully inside, he noticed a dildo with a suction cup hanging on the inside of the spiral wall. It was a black, average sized one with a velvety smooth texture on it, he went back outside, to get the toy disinfectant he noticed on the shelf above the sink. He cleaned it and started showering.
The big bathtub was illuminated by the stars and the moon, shining through the window. Harry sat Draco on the chair in the corner and went to fix the bath, with a few essential oils that enabled blood flow and had a calming effect to them.
What would be a must-have for you ?
It was the first real smile Harry had seen since they met two days ago. He made a mental note, to praise Draco on a regular basis.
With the empty water glass in one hand and Draco in his arms he walked to the kitchen. He sat Draco down on the counter, and filled the glass with fresh water, handing it to Draco. While Draco emptied the glass in small sips, Harry took a banana and mashed it into a mush.
He had gone to that club ever since moving to his first Appartement in Soho, only a few blocks away. And over the years he realized that he slowly went from being on the rather young side to the rather old side of the clubs frequenting publicum.
Draco pointed the way towards his bedroom, forgetting that he might have left out some toys  to ‘play’ with, later in the night. Since he was living alone and never had friends coming over he had his collection gathered on his nightstand. He realized that the second Harry pushed the door open. So there were only to options, hurrying to put them away, or playing it cool. He decided for the latter. Harry took in his spacious bedroom with the huge windows, one of them directly over Draco’s bed. The door leading to a walk-in closet, a cozy armchair in front of the windows next to a huge shelf with books. And the two nightstands, one of which was covered in dildos and vibrators in all sorts and sizes. Next to them stood an half empty bottle of lube and a long chain with anal beads hung over the edge of the upper open drawer.
