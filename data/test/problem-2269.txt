thought Draco, trying very hard to ignore every single person’s eyes on them as they went to the eighth year table.
“Oh, look at that,” breathed Draco, his eyes shining with wonder as he gazed up at the sky. Harry followed suit and his mouth parted in awe. The meteor shower had started, and it was breathtaking. Arcs of light raced across the deep blue sky, and all of the normal stars were out in full force, making a kaleidoscope of dots and patterns.
“I did not look lonely.” he answered, and he knew his tone was rather standoffish but he couldn’t help it.
They stayed out a bit longer, letting Draco practice, but he wasn’t able to get beyond that first stage. By the time they finally went inside, they were both shivering from the cold.
She nodded warily, and Harry stepped back and let Daphne carefully levitate Malfoy and followed her out of the common room. As they stepped out of the portrait hole, Hermione rushed around the corner with the Headmistress behind her, and they stopped short at the sight of Malfoy.
“I’ll meet you there in a few minutes, I have to go meet one of my professors first.” explained Draco. He’d asked to meet with his Healing Magic professor, because he was starting to get an idea for Harry’s christmas present but wanted to ask his teacher about one aspect of it.
“Sure,” replied Draco, pushing aside the tapestry covering the other end of the passage and holding it back so Harry could come out. “Just us?”
“Harry, wake up.” he said, but when the other boy doesn’t stir he does it again. “Harry.” Finally Harry’s eyes shoot open, and he took great, shuddering breaths. Draco retreated back to his own bed and let Harry have some space. “Nightmare?” he asked quietly.
“How absurd.” Draco muttered. “I’m not tickling the pear. That’s weird.” He wrinkled his nose and Harry sighed when Draco didn’t move, then lifted his own hand and tickled the pear. The pear started giggling and as Draco watched the painting swung open, revealing a stone passage from which came a blast of hot air, smelling of food.
“Sod off. How did you find me, anyway?” asked Malfoy as Harry started up the hill. Harry smiled ruefully.
“I’ll be right back,” said Harry loudly over the music, tapping Amelie on the shoulder. She nodded at him, and handed him his jacket. He grinned in thanks and wove his way
“Well I refuse to be levitated, you are not calling down more people, so we’re walking.” insisted Malfoy, and Harry sighed, trying to think of an alternative.
“Leave it.” she chided softly, and met Draco’s eyes. He could see that she knows why he went off by himself, because he had done the same thing in sixth year and in a moment of
Draco’s mouth parted, he wanted to say more, show Harry why this was such a bad idea, but all of his thoughts were slipping away when faced with Harry’s words. The other boy was still cupping Draco’s face gently, reverently, and Draco had never felt like this before.
“Alright,” the professor announced ten minutes later. “The spell is Ferula, with a spiral and flick, as such-” he demonstrated, and the class copied him. “-now, practice on each other’s legs or arms.”
The school itself was a gargantuan chateau, as large as Hogwarts or bigger, but far grander. It had white walls and rounded towers topped with grey roofs, and Draco could spot more carvings and sculptures adorning the entrances and sides of the school.
“Chudley Cannons.” Weasley paused, but seemed inspired to say more when his bishop smashed Draco’s pawn. “You?”
“I always smell like mint.” responded Draco dryly, before his face fell slack all of a sudden, like he’d thought of something that surprised him. The expression was gone in an instant, smoothed over, but Harry wondered about it.
The two are greeted by a cacophony of noise, as 9 year old's yell and chatter and send random things flying across the room, including each other. It’s wonderfully chaotic, and Harry has to smother a grin. Amelie sighed.
sure, practice.” Draco continued, a note of sarcasm in his voice. “Maybe that’ll be my extra Christmas present, getting my Patronus.”
Harry sighs and leaned his head against the cool stone. He’s been trying not to think of Malfoy, but the more he forces himself not to, the more he does. He couldn’t help it. He knew it was probably a bad idea…
“Welcome, exchange students.” said Madam Maxime grandly, also with an accent. “We are so pleased to have you here, and hope you enjoy your time at our humble school.” Draco suppressed a smirk. If this was humble, his manor was a hovel. How very French. “After we have dinner, some of my students will lead you to your dorms, and then tomorrow morning you will shadow students with the same schedule as yourselves until you know your schedules and classes. Now please, this way.” She began to walk toward the school, and they all trailed behind her like ducklings following their mother.
Draco didn’t say anything, but chose to keep what he probably saw as a dignified silence. But Harry saw the corners of his mouth turn up slightly, in the small smile that Harry adored.
“Your hands are fucking freezing, Draco, damn.” complained Harry. He laced both of his hands with both of Draco’s, under the unspoken pretense of warming them up but also just to hold his hands, since Draco rarely let him do that. Especially in public.
“Yeah. We had lots of fun. Mrs. Weasley is the best cook I’ve ever known, and they all seemed to enjoy having me around, which was a right sight better than the Dursley’s.” he
“How’d it go?” asked Hermione. She had enchanted a pair of knitting needles, which were clacking busily in front of her, making something that looked- like a blob.
“I was not doing any of that. I’m not a lovesick Hufflepuff.” he said indignantly as they began down the final hallway to their Healing class. She poked his cheek.
It was hard to try to change how he thought about this, though. To not call people weak for showing emotions and vulnerabilities. For trusting.
“They promised to do my makeup as well, so this isn’t that bad of a price.” he replied, and Draco shook his head with a grin. Daphne and Camille flounced over to his and sat down on either side of him, while Amelie and Simon joined Harry.
“Not the ones I know. If we eat outside it’s still a fancy thing, and definitely no one sits on the grass.” replied Draco. Harry chuckled, and for a while the two boys ate, watching the stars come out above them.
“No, because when the laws are applied to all basic and advanced elemental charms you see that the second law is the most widely seen and….” Hermione began a long and windy explanation, but when she’s done, Malfoy embarked on an equally complicated tirade and soon the two of them are bickering back and forth. Harry and Ron are left in the dust, the fancy words flying in one ear and out the other.
Theo stepped up to him, bracing an arm beside Draco’s head on the wall. There was a slight noise in the hallway, like the scuff of someone’s shoe.
“Thanks.” Harry said softly. “I think I needed to hear that.” Draco nodded. They stayed like that for a little while, each supporting the other. Physically and mentally.
“I’ll fix it,” promised Harry. “You start the next step.” Malfoy blinked, probably because for once Harry is telling Malfoy what to do in Potions and not the other way around, but he nodded and began pouring a measure of some blue liquid. The two boys work together in silence, occasionally saying something to the other in regards to the potion. But Harry didn’t mind the quiet. It’s a comfortable silence, like when he and Ron had finished talking before bed, back when they were still in the Gryffindor common room.
He walked over to Harry’s bed. “Harry?” he whispered. The other boy’s brows are furrowed slightly, and a sheen of sweat gleamed on his forehead.
Harry wondered if Draco liked him, too. Was that what he and Daphne were keeping from him? He wasn’t sure. It would make a certain amount of sense, what with the Pepper-Up incident, or the random french whispers.
“It’s not a necklace. Well, it is, but not really. It’s imbued with a Calming Charm. Whenever you get panic attacks, just hold it and it’ll activate the charm and help you calm down.” explained Draco somewhat hesitantly, watching Harry’s reaction carefully. He was rewarded with a smile, small at first but growing delightly.
He did want to go apologize to her, though. Yes, he would, decided Draco, because Luna deserved that much. She was his cousin, after all, even if her father was a bit loony.
The phoenix sung again in response, before emitting a low humming sound. Draco reached out a tentative hand and when nothing happened, lay his hand gently on the phoenix. He gasped.
Draco snickered. “That’s almost worse than my story.” The pair talk for a little while longer over breakfast, before leaving when people begin to enter in full force.
“I don’t care about that,” replied Harry. He stood up slowly, tugging Draco up with him. Draco felt kind of bad, now, for crying like a child all over Harry, and Harry could see this in his eyes because he wrapped a comforting arm around Draco’s waist, a steady presence that helped to center Draco as they walked. “And it’s alright to cry, Draco. That’s part of being human. It doesn’t mean you’re weak.”
“Ok, my turn.” he said. “Crinus Muto.” There’s a red glow of light and Daphne’s eyebrows turn red. “Red eyebrows are an interesting look on you.”
“There’s a map that I have. Long story, but basically it shows all of Hogwarts and has everyone’s names, and where they are.” Malfoy blinked.
“Not a chance, Malfoy!” came Harry’s reply, and Draco rolled his eyes quickly before flying for the Snitch again.
“Yeah,” Draco replied, and they started up the cobblestone walkway to the front door. Harry knocked. A few seconds later the door flew opened and Andromeda was there in front of them.
“Yeah.” Weasley answered flatly as he directed a bishop. Draco frowned. Can Weasley even speak more than one syllable replies?
“I’m really sorry, Draco,” began Pansy forlornly, and Blaise and Daphne quiet. Draco stared stonily at her, his happier mood dissipated. He'd forgiven Daphne, but he considered what Pansy had done to be different. He'd thought he could trust her with something personal.
So Harry has taken to watching the world outside through the window, which felt like a view to a totally different world. A place that had never known conflict, a place of peace. Serenity. Safety. Because while the grounds of the castle certainly withheld that appearance, Harry knew otherwise.
“Come help me with lunch, Harry,” said Andromeda, standing up, and Harry exchanged a smirk with Draco as he followed Andromeda, both of them knowing what was up.
He walked out of the bathroom, finally dressed, to find Harry sitting in the armchair with two cups of coffee sitting on one of the bedside tables. Harry held out a hand and when Draco took it, pulled him down next to him on the armchair. It was not made for two people, and Draco’s legs were over Harry’s thighs while their shoulders pressed together. But it worked. They worked. And that blew Draco’s mind.
He leaned in to press a quick kiss to Harry’s lips, but gasped involuntarily when Harry surged forward, his hands coming to Draco’s waist and pulling him closer, his fingers tight, like he thought Draco would disappear if he let go. Draco parted his lips and stifled a moan when Harry’s tongue tangled with his, but soon realized that this was not their normal sort of kiss. Harry was taking control of it, pressing Draco into the bed and kissing him intensely. Draco’s head was spinning, and he couldn’t stop himself from whimpering when Harry licked at a spot on his neck.
“That’s classic you, you know. Making your moment about someone else.” He nudged Draco with his shoulder. “And it doesn’t matter to me if you like guys or girls. You’re still one of my best friends.” Draco had his head turned away, but Harry saw his lips curve up into a smile.
“Well, if you need anything to help with them, come talk to me, ok? My mom had panic attacks, so I know which medicines help.” She mussed his hair affectionately.
Draco’s lying awake, captivated by the bright moonlight streaming in from the window. He does this more than he should, even though he isn’t tired. Draco liked listening to Harry’s soft breathing, watching the moon and the trees make shadow patterns on the wall. It calmed him.
“Yeah, I’d love to go to Beauxbatons.” Harry sighed. “Maybe there I could be more inconspicuous.” Hermione shot him a sympathetic look.
“Thanks.” he replied. They’re both quiet. He wondered if this change in Malfoy is around to stay. He wouldn't mind, it makes him easier to talk to; and the moments of vulnerability in the other boy remind Harry that he’s not the only person with scars, visible and not. Thinking on this takes his mind off of his nightmare, and eventually he rolled over and succumbed to sleep once more.
“Yeah, I know. Not great. I wasn’t so much treated like an extra son, more like the unwanted bug in the corner of the house. They hated that I was a wizard. That’s why I always stayed at Hogwarts for the holidays.” said Harry. He’d almost forgotten that Draco probably didn’t know about his times at number 4 Privet Drive, but hadn’t really deemed it essential to tell him as of now. He knew it would come up sooner or later, though.
“Correct, Ms. Granger. You will get more information in a week, but it would be a three month exchange only for the eighth years of Hogwarts.”
“Like his soul,” finished Harry, and Draco remembered the many times he’d said that back at Hogwarts, and the two boys grinned at each other. Camille laughed.
The words were flames, burning through him. It felt like- like he could grow wings if he wanted. Like he could do anything.
“Yeah, that’s good. I’ll send it off this weekend.” Harry replied, and Draco rolled his eyes, flopping back onto his bed.
“Oh please. You are not a Death Eater. You wouldn’t kill anyone. And anyway,” she continued, a more serious expression settling on her face, “You aren’t the only Slytherin that’s going to be hated on. Pansy’s the one who told everyone to arrest Potter last year, and Blaise and I are Slytherins from families associated with Him.”
“I could work with you on it, if you want some extra practice,” offered Harry. Draco shot him a tentative smile.
“Bye,” replied Harry. “Oh, hey- Patronus practice later?” Draco chewed on his lip absentmindedly. He wanted to spend time with Harry, of course, but the Patronus thing was so frustrating. Not to mention it made him tired.
“I still don’t know why you’re asking me. It’s not like I have a clue what I’m getting Harry, either. You should ask him. He’s better at this relationship stuff.”
“Alright.” he said, for once in his life completely sure of something. Yes, he wanted to be with Harry. Harry was the one he loved, the person that kept him going, that had helped him and listened to him and understood him and forgiven him. The person that had shown him a better life.
Hermione and Harry found Ron in one of the very last compartments on the train. The only other compartment nearby was opposite theirs, and looked to be empty, but Harry couldn’t see through the glass. They turned into the compartment and close the door. Harry put his trunk up on the rack quickly before greeting Ron.
“I’d never really thought about it, to be honest. But now I have, and I think I’ll at least try it.” Draco admitted. Harry saw his lips curve up into a rueful smile. “Not that many places
“What about you two?” Camille looked at Draco, then Harry, and Draco swapped a look with the Gryffindor.
He ran his fingers over the vivid colors inked over his scar. The phoenix tattoo. He thought of it as a symbol. A symbol of how he’d changed, a symbol of hope. Of better things. Just like how Dumbledore’s phoenix, that day in the clearing, had reminded him that just because there was dark in the world didn’t mean it blotted out the light as well.
Harry blinks, just as shocked to find someone else in what he’d thought of as his space. The two boys stare at each other, and Harry’s hand drops from the wall. He couldn’t help but think that the other boy looks ethereal in the glow of the moon.
But he couldn’t do anything about it, only to wait. So here Harry sat, trying his hardest to take legible and useful notes, although he knew his were not up to standard with Malfoy’s. The Slytherin’s notes, like Hermione’s, were always neat and extensively knowledgeable.
Draco had been a little stingy after they finished the potion, though, mused Harry as they entered the Great Hall, but forgot all about Draco when he beheld the Hall.
“Yeah, alright.” responded Harry, and the two walked up to the Defense class that they shared, along with Potions.
“Yeah, she said about as much over the summer. Mum was a bit disappointed, but Ginny started seeing Dean again and brought him ‘round and Mum likes him too. Mostly because he let her fill up his plate as much as she wanted.” added Ron.
“Mr. Johnson has been expelled,” said the Headmistress gravely, appearing behind them. “And I have spoken to the students. Anyone who does anything like this again will also be expelled.” Ron nodded mutely, looking intimidated by the presence of the Headmistress. “Good to see you back with us, Potter.” McGonagall said more warmly, and Harry smiled.
“He got thrown into a wall. Hit his head.” answered Harry, wincing a little as he remembers the awful thud. Madam Pomfrey let out a great sigh and began casting little spells.
“Oh- yeah.” He tugged on the heavy wooden door and she levitated Malfoy through it. Inside, neat rows of hospital beds lined both sides of the room, and Madam Pomfrey was leaning over a small girl with a cast on her arm. She looked up at their footsteps, and when she saw the unconscious Malfoy she quickly strode over to them.
“I thought I was going to die,” he replied, and suddenly tears were streaming down his face, and Harry was clutching him tighter, and Draco could hear his own quiet, snuffling breaths. “I thought I was going to die,” he repeated, his voice trembling, and he was too tired and scared to be mad at himself for sounding so weak, though he hated it.
Harry felt very protective of him at the current moment, though he knew Draco would balk if he told him. But when Draco was in his arms, he just felt so precious, so amazing, and Harry wanted to keep him there as long as humanly possible.
“You still taste like mint.” said Harry, now kissing and sucking a tender spot on Draco’s neck, sending pleasant tingles up and down his spine, making his brain go fuzzy.
When he reached the top of the rock spur that the tower is perched on, he entered and found the window that looked out over the Black Lake and sat, his legs hanging out of the window. The school owls hoot softly behind him, and one of them flew inquisitively to perch on Draco’s knee. It’s a handsome owl, with tawny feathers and keen yellow eyes, and he stroked it softly. The owl hooted quietly in appreciation.
Harry didn’t know if it was worth it to go ask the other boy for the book. Malfoy had been more snappy today, reminding Harry of the spats they used to have when they were younger. It had irked him a little. He’d been trying to be nice-ish to Malfoy, and up until Potions Harry had thought Malfoy was doing the same thing. But then he’d fallen back into his insults, and Harry didn’t want to put up with that. They’ve already seen enough of each other today.
“Yeah, of course we’ll write,” replied Draco, throwing an arm around Camille, who gave him a slightly watery smile and leaned into the hug.
“I wasn’t going to put that in a letter!” he protested, and Pansy let out an impressive drafty sigh.
“So. I’d like to.. apologize.” muttered Malfoy, and Harry can almost see him forcing the words out. Was this why Daphne had brought him here? So she could make Malfoy apologize to them? But why, what did she get out of it? wondered Harry.
“I’m testing ways to get you up in the morning without me having to do it myself.” he replied, and Draco narrowed his eyes. It was the morning, for Merlin’s sake. Too early for this shit.
A feeling of exhilaration tingled through him, and he grinned, doing a loop as he tracked the little golden ball. Harry flew up beside him, shoving him aside with a smirk.
“Did you get one of these?” asked Draco, holding up the slim envelope as he sat down next to Daphne. She tapped his hand, tilting her head and glancing at Harry as if to ask if last night had gone alright. Draco gave her a slight nod, and she smiled.
“I couldn’t think of anything to get Draco for Christmas,” Harry began, leaning against the wall. “But I was thinking of doing like, something else. Instead of buying him something, I mean. Do you think he would like it if we went, like, star-gazing? There’s supposed to be a meteor shower the night of the ball,” said Harry, well aware that he was babbling but unable to stop it. Daphne gave him a knowing, searching look.
“I remember that one you sent me, Harry.” she said. “What was it that she said? Oh yes-” Hermione pulled it out of her bag to Ron’s laughter and Harry’s spluttering- “I’m your biggest fan, I even have a tattoo of your name, so if you ever need a girlfriend, or a hookup, just know I’m here. Kisses, Julia.” They all snorted.
“Well anyway. Maybe we can find you a French girl to cheer you up.” Draco cleared his throat somewhat nervously. Some people know he’s bent, but he’s never outright told anyone. Blaise and Pansy only know because they were part of the crowd that walked in on him and Theo. Daphne probably wouldn’t know, though, since they just got close.
“I studied with her today. Daphne and the other girls from my dorm,” responded Hermione conversationally. “She said something about Malfoy being missing all day.”
Draco thought he knew what Harry was feeling, even as ridiculous and overhyped those feelings were. Or he could take a guess.
“A round of Firewhisky, please.” said Simon, propping his elbows on the bar. Harry snorted. He didn’t have much experience with Firewhisky, all he remembered about it was that it burned going down. But hey, what the hell. It’s one time.
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy.” said McGonagall, and gestured to a chair in front of her desk. The room is filled with bits and bobs and oddities, although Draco could see a large bird stand adjacent to the ornate wooden desk that seemed actually in use, red feathers laying randomly at the base of it.
“What’s wrong?” he repeated. “I- I’m Draco fucking Malfoy, I’m an ex-Death Eater. You’re Harry Potter, the Savior of the Wizarding World-”
“I think that the second law is the most important,” announced Hermione, her arms crossed and a firm set to her jaw, obviously not expecting anyone to contradict her. Harry
“Not so much unexpected as bloody insane,” Ron replied. “I reckon you two might be onto something, he has changed some. Still a git, though.”
Draco sighed heavily and got dressed. He was walking over to the bathroom when he spotted a slip of paper that had been slipped under their door, and picked it up. It was an envelope, decorated with delicate silver snowflakes, and embossed in silver cursive were the words:
“Actually, neither.” said Harry slightly nervously, finishing the (decent) french braid and tying it off with a hair tie, his fingers resting at the base of Draco’s neck. Amelie had gotten him a pack of hair ties for Christmas, so Daphne could teach Harry how to braid Draco’s hair. Or so Amelie had said. “It’s more of a so, can we talk about you blaming yourself for every single bad thing that stems from the war?”
I definitely think there are some more things that could be explored in this AU, and I may eventually do that, but I really don't know at the moment. I also don't plan on doing anything this big for a while; at least until after all my grades have been submitted (still don't know what's going on with the A-levels, but anyway).
“You had to drink the potion again?” Hermione asked quietly, but Kreacher vigorously shook his head, tears flowing freely.
“Are you doubting my calculations?” Hermione put her hands on her hips, glaring at Ron who was looking extremely nervous.
wards, and since it’s keyed to my mother, f–Lucius can’t get in.” Harry glared at Draco, but sighed and nodded at the point. Harry realised that he’d perhaps been staring at Draco a moment too long when Ron spoke.
“Remember all the little things that were wrong with that letter, ‘Mione? They probably forced him to write it.”
, Harry thought. “Nope. Hey look, there’s Ron, we can finally go down to breakfast!” Harry wasn’t hungry, despite having been up for four hours, but was happy to change the topic from Malfoy.
ways of the Slytherins he’s chosen to surround himself with in his youth, but it also tended to catch him off–guard.
me.” He muttered, but turned around to give her a hug anyway. “How’re you holding up?” He added gently.
Hermione hummed, looking between him and Harry. “He’s got a massive magical core, so it’s not surprising he’d use all of your magic — the amount of magical interference that comes with him casting a spell is unreal.”
After a quick breakfast, they ran back up to the dorms as neither of the boys had thought to bring down their money (“Honestly, I don’t know how you’re going to pass your NEWTs with this level of organisation.”
“Yeah, well, glamours aren’t that hard. What about Harry?” Ron pulled his chair back under and grabbed an apple.
A light drizzle had started up when they left Dervish and Banges, so they hastily put up umbrella charms as they walked over to Gladrags. Pansy rushed over to a witch in the dark blue uniform of the shop, who gave her a hug before pulling out a rack of clothes from seemingly nowhere, which Pansy efficiently started sorting through.
Harry huffed and rolled his eyes, looking sideways at his classmates. Indeed, a few of them were staring at him with narrowed eyes, the most worrying of which being Hermione.
He’d hurriedly pulled on a pair of dark blue jeans that were scuffed, but not quite ripped (yet) and a dark grey hoodie. He then pulled on a pair of odd socks - one was bright blue with a snitch pattern, and the other was Chudley Cannons orange - both clearly presents from Ron.
. He couldn’t remember anyone caring about him like that since Lily — he would curse Dumbledore every day for influencing him to make the decision to stop talking to her, to get closer to the death eaters, to be his willing spy. It hadn’t been
Hermione fondly rolled her eyes. “Harry’s the master of the house, so he’d be able to apparate in no matter
He didn’t know what to think about the blonde-haired man who creeped into his dreams that night, nor the pale hand tilting his chin upwards to meet soft, smirking lips, nor the grey eyes staring into his own.
Bracing himself for the name calling, he yelled “Granger! Weasley! I need to talk to you for a minute.”
“Thank you,” Draco surged up and wrapped his arms around Severus, who stiffened, before relaxing slightly and patting Draco on the back.
“By relying on you, of course” Ron had replied, while Harry nodded in agreement), before racing back down to the entrance hall to meet Ginny, Luna, Neville, Hannah, Seamus, and Dean.
, ready for any threat. These particular episodes, Harry found, were the worst, as he could think that what he was doing was stupid, and Voldemort wasn’t in his kitchen he was
A booming voice echoed through the room. “All we want is Hermione Granger and Ronald Weasley. Give them to us within fifteen minutes and we will leave everyone else unharmed.”
Then Harry turned Draco around so he was staring at his reflection in the mirror while Harry rubbed salve into his back. He was taller than Harry, so he couldn’t stare at the other boy through the mirror. His front was completely flawless - Harry had evidently applied dittany to the cut on his cheek while Draco was staring at him.
Grumbling, Draco climbed back on the sofa, practically vibrating. When his wand chimed, he shot up, startling Theo so much he dropped his book.
“Actually, while we’re here, we should probably test if both mine and Ron’s magic hurts him. Ron, you first.”
Pansy appeared, as if summoned, two seconds later, in a short grey skirt, knee-high black boots, black tights (which must have warming charms imbued in them, because the only person who hated the cold more than Draco was Pansy,) and a low cut maroon sweater showing a
Remus frowned. “And how do they get out? It would be a bit difficult to smuggle massive piles of paper out, and in the case of an emergency, they’d need an extraction plan.”
“We’re not going to be late, we have ten minutes to get downstairs. You coming Harry?” She added, looking over at Harry, who hadn’t moved from his seat, wondering whether there was any excuse for him not to go.
Kreacher took a shuddering breath. “It had all been starting when Master Regulus said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”
Draco thought, his eyes) and how he hadn’t “had a proper butterbeer in over a year, Draco, how ridiculous is that?”
He worked from Harry’s face downwards, Harry watching Draco relax before his eyes. At the start, he’d been the perfect pureblood — hair in neat waves, perfect posture, movements measured and controlled. However, as he continued healing Harry’s cuts, he started to fidget, running his free hand through his hair multiple times in a way that reminded Harry of his father when
Everyone got in easily enough, and went around their daily jobs. Albert Runcorn was knocked out using the twins’ fainting fancies, and against popular opinion (“obliviate him and send him on a one–way portkey to Argentina”, suggested by Ron, had been most popular by a landslide), would be released back into London after the mission was completed. Snape went to Runcorn’s office and had a snoop around, but didn’t find anything other than a disturbing amount of anti–muggleborn propaganda, and some homosexual erotic magazines. Interesting information, but not useful for the mission.
Over the racket, Kingsley shouted, “has everyone finished their sections?” Everyone nodded. “Alright then, move out!”
“He just said the potion is speeding up the curse on his hand. He’s going to die before he finishes it.”
All these questions whirled around Harry’s head as he bolted upright, trying his best to control his breathing. It didn’t take as long - around two minutes - so Harry opened the drapes around his bed, checking on Draco.
Why in the name of Merlin did McGonagall think that putting him in a room with Potter was a good idea? She knew about their history...but she also knew Potter’s character. He was probably the least likely in their year to hex him in his sleep, which was a relief - he’d get enough of that in the corridors, probably. After seeing his name on the sheet, Potter would likely spend most of his time outside of the room anyway.
“Cheers.”’ Harry clinked his glass against Draco’s before taking a large sip, and immediately regretted. He swallowed, wincing at the burn, before pulling a face at Draco.
Apparently deciding that he had been adequately tortured for the day, Bellatrix turned on her heel, the two men following closely.
! You’ll wake him up!” Weasley hissed, and Draco raised an eyebrow as the door opened anyway. He could make whatever expressions he wanted — he was facing away from the door, anyway.
and joined everyone at their defence lesson, despite Draco’s protests, and proved himself to be a very good dueller, despite the wand not being his own — until his magical core was depleted. His magical core was around the same size as Hermione’s, but he still had the habit of using excessive amounts of magic for spells. He also had the habit of hiding when his magic was being depleted, which meant that Remus didn’t notice anything was wrong until Harry literally collapsed onto the sand.
“I — as a matter of fact, I did, Miss Granger. He was a death eater — perhaps the smartest and most sane one, other than myself. We were friends, of sorts — we often paired up for missions, since there was no one who provided better conversation, and our ages were relatively close — he joined a couple of years after myself. Towards the end, he mentioned something about having second thoughts. I dismissed it, perhaps a little too quickly, since he was from the Black family, who were notorious for turning out as death eaters — for example, I’m sure you’ve heard of Bellatrix Lestrange?”
“Not that bad, am I? You’re full of compliments today. Best not give me any more lest my overly large head cause me to float away.” Draco said quietly once Harry had turned around and everyone was practicing their bonding spells.
No; there was Draco’s pulse, a strong, pounding drum against the overwhelming fear and sorrow; his chest rose and fell with even breaths; his eyes were open and staring at Harry.
Harry tried to keep his tears in, he really did, but the thought of Fred just opened the floodgates. He still blamed himself for Fred’s death - how could he not? - and the idea of facing the Weasley’s when the lack of Fred’s presence would be so obvious…
“Us elves be making lots of food, so Master,” Kreacher smirked at Harry - it was an odd expression on the elf, “should only be waiting for five minutes”
Harry clumsily climbed in, Dumbledore followed with much more grace, barely rocking the boat. As soon as he’d sat down, the boat began to move across the unnervingly still lake, Dumbledore’s lumos casting an eerie light around the cave.
“I can’t apparate.” Harry sighed, before looking at Malfoy, who looked oddly pensive. “Any ideas, Malfoy?”
“A little experiment of mine,” Lucius tried to purr — his voice was still dry and croaky from Azkaban, but he got his point across. “It leaches the magic from the wizard inside. Not enough to kill them, probably, but enough to weaken them considerably. And the door can only be opened by someone of Malfoy blood.”
“We heard Pansy squealing and decided we couldn’t wait for Blaise’s terrible retelling. Also we were eavesdropping outside.” Millie walked in unabashedly, and Theo followed, slightly bashful.
Harry struggled to sit up, and he was surprised when he was able to hold the glass of water without much trouble.  He took a large sip, and then another, and quickly drained the glass, before grimacing at the horrid feeling of an empty stomach filled with water. Feeling slightly nauseous, he took one slice of bread and carefully nibbled at the side.
He appeared in the forest that he’d spent an entire year in, learning to accept his werewolf side, frantically following the scent of his pack.
Draco frowned and looked up from his meal, scanning the room - what had everyone been betting on? But nothing seemed out of place - the Ravenclaws still had their various books, likely nothing to do with what they were learning in their lessons, the Hufflepuffs were still giggling away or writing letters, the Gryffindors were still loud and raucous and the Slytherins were civilised. A few random sixth and seventh years approached Harry, and Draco purposefully unclenches his fists. Harry could date whomever he wanted. He watched as Harry’s face momentarily morphed into confusion, before he nodded and said “thanks.” Hopefully not an offer for a date on the next Hogsmeade weekend, then.
“Yeah.” She pulled a face. “I’ll clear out another room so you don’t have to put up with me for too long — none of the rooms are particularly bad since it’s only been abandoned for a year, instead of twelve.”
Potter’s eyes widened behind those hideous glasses of his, before betraying an emotion that looked like...relief?
Harry frowned at it, before shaking his head; this was something to consider later. He couldn’t apparate home one jump — it was literally at the other end of the island — so he apparated to Edinburgh.
Draco finished the rest of his food and walked outside, into the grounds. The ground was still damp, and there was a breeze cooling down the temperature as the sun set, turning the sky a striking orange, fading into a bruised purple.
Draco shook his head. He could consider the consequences later, but Potter was not taking it well. Draco could feel him panicking at the other end of the bond, and then he felt a wave of nausea. Brilliant.
“I wouldn’t feel guilty if you were.” Harry leant into Draco’s side, Draco leaning back to stop himself from falling off the bed. They stayed there in silence for a while, just enjoying each other’s company.
Draco must have stood in the entrance hall for at least five minutes after Harry went sprinting down the corridor.
Remus studied the little crescent–shaped marks his nails had left in the wood of the dining room table with detached interest as members of the Order continued to file in. He’d been allocated as the designated talker for their circle — he was the oldest, save Severus, and had never been a death eater, meaning he was the most trusted in the group. Of course, his
Ron looked as if he was going to say something, but then just grimaced instead, before changing the subject. “So…what actually happened? Y’know, on the mission with Dumbledore, and then these last six weeks…”
Harry leant into Draco, allowing himself to be encircled in long, strong limbs. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco. He knew they were both crying, could feel the shuddering breaths Draco dragged in as he nestled his face into the soft skin just above his collarbone.
“I have a few with me as well.” Malfoy cut in. Hermione turned to him in surprise, and he rolled his eyes. “I do read, Granger — I was second in all my classes, after yourself.” Hermione was surprised to hear no bitterness in his voice.
Once the story was finished, Hermione said, the picture of innocence, “You know I don’t like to say ‘I told you so’—”
Harry twisted and turned through the teetering stacks of junk in the Room of Requirement, fiendfire hot on his heels. A right here, a left there and...there it was. The ugly bust which he now knew was supposed to be Rowena Ravenclaw, and on top a shining diadem, oozing magic as dark as ink. He grabbed it and tossed in the fire, which hissed and spat and...changed.
Draco slumped down - Harry was just being nice. After Draco had looked after him, he felt indebted to Draco.
Harry didn’t know what to do with himself on Halloween this year. Previously, he’d always been busy - between trolls, Death-day parties, ‘mass murderers’, trials, Umbridge, quidditch and being on the run, Harry had never had much time to consider what this day meant to him. At the Dursley’s, he’d always nicked some sweets from Dudley if he could get away with it - often Bounties and Parma Violets, which Dudley said ‘tasted like soap’ and ‘weren’t real sweets’, but Harry liked them all the same. He’d found out that his parents had died on Halloween when Hagrid had picked him up, but had always put off mourning until the day after due to whatever happened that year - last year he hadn’t fully realised he’d missed the anniversary until he and Hermione went to Godric’s Hollow that Christmas - and even then Nagini had prevented him from fully taking his time. This year, none of that was in his way. Halloween was on a Saturday, so he didn’t even have lessons. He’d do his homework tomorrow.
Looking back, he was very sure Dumbledore had known - why else would he have put up wards to stop Harry from running away? - and Snape probably found out during those occlumency lessons, if he hadn’t guessed from what he knew about Petunia’s situation before then, but Harry had made sure that no one else knew. Harry had had no intention of making other people worry.
Harry grimaced at the corpse on the floor — it was a bit anticlimactic, in his opinion, but he wasn’t complaining — and nudged it with his shoe, before swaying slightly; he didn’t have an ounce of power left.
He’d already wandered down to the entrance to the dungeons twice, and there always seemed to be a death eater at the entrance, which was irritating, to say the least.
Potter glared at him, but Draco’s words were clearly working as his breathing became more even. Draco decided to take a chance and rub small circles into Harry’s back — it had always helped him when he was younger, after a nightmare, when his mother would rub his back. He felt a pang of sadness at the thought of his mother, but no, now was not the time to be feeling sad. Now, he had to be there for Harry.
Severus took it from Ron and looked over it carefully, casting a couple of spells to make it gleam and filling it with a shimmery liquid. “It’s safe to use now. I take it Draco and I aren’t allowed to see?”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.” Ron waved a time-out sign with his hands - Harry wondered where he’d got that from, since it wasn’t a common gesture in Hogwarts. “Both of you have been cosying up to Malfoy? What shall we do next, invite him to Hogsmeade with us? No, Harry, that is not a genuine suggestion” Ron added, as Harry perked up slightly.
Harry offers him a small smile, feeling a nervous fluttering in his stomach. Malfoy looks at him a second longer before walking past him, leaving the courtyard. Harry gets the sense it would be alright if he followed. So he does.
“Malfoy.” Draco snapped out of his thoughts and met Potter’s eyes. They’re wide and earnest and so different from the glares he’s usually directed at Draco.
“It’ll be alright. You two will make it work.” said Draco rather awkwardly, and Harry had the sudden urge to smile, as Draco reminded him of Ron at this moment. They were both not quite in their element when trying to comfort crying people. Although Draco was better at it than Ron.
Transfiguration passed agonizingly slow, and Draco cold-shouldered Daphne the whole class. He did feel a bit bad about it, but he’s waiting for a better apology. At lunch he only talked to Blaise, still furious that Pansy told Daphne about something that was none of her business.
“Well, have a good rest of your day, you two. And Mr. Malfoy, I’d appreciate it if you refrained from hitting my patients next time.” she chided, and Draco felt his cheeks warm a little.
“His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad,” sang Draco, smirking, and Harry flushed from embarrassment while Hermione and Draco laughed.
“So how’d it go?” he asked, and Draco smiled, his face still more peaceful-looking than Harry had ever seen him.
Draco couldn’t look away from him, but his frantic heartbeat steadied at the other boy’s words. Not a bad person. We’ve forgiven you. Maybe it’s the fact that he called Draco by his first name, or he had told Draco the words that he so desperately had needed and really meant them, but Draco decided to trust him at this moment. To trust Harry. His friend.
It was December 31, New Year’s, and Harry had just burst into the previously quiet dorm room and announced that they- meaning Draco, Harry, and all their friends- were going ice skating on a nearby lake. And now here they were.
“Hey Ron.” Hermione stood and kissed Weasley quickly, and Draco almost snickered at the expression on Weasley’s face, but figured that’s not such a good idea. Don’t antagonize people, he reminded himself.
“Maybe.” he replied, trying a little too hard to be casual. Harry smirked a little at him, and motioned to his face.
First he went down to the dining hall, where Draco grabbed a pot of tea and Harry’s favorite breakfast- toast with marmalade and scrambled eggs- before dropping them off back with Harry.
“I would ask you how last night went, but I’ll hazard a guess at well?” asked Daphne as they jogged up a staircase. Draco flushed but didn’t say anything, and Daphne playfully knocked her shoulder into his.
“Well, if Harry Potter says I’ll get it, then it must be true.” quipped Draco, and Harry smirked before letting go of his sleeve. His fingers brushed Draco’s wrist, sending his heartbeat into overdrive. Draco smiled again at Harry, a little unsteady. “Bye.”
“Does he like you?” Daphne finished the eyeliner, and Draco felt a lump in his throat as he chuckled, trying to be nonchalant, to seem like that question wasn’t one he pondered night and day.
“I don’t give a damn what other people think, Draco!” Harry said, not taking his eyes off of Draco’s wide grey ones. “If you like me, and I like you, then that’s all that matters. Forget everyone else.”
“That may be a setback, true enough.” acknowledged McGonagall diplomatically, and she peered over her glasses at Draco. Her gaze is very motherly, but also very stern, noted Draco randomly. “But I do suggest that while at Beauxbatons you consider taking the Healer program. At least then you could perhaps gain some experience in a field, and decide if you like it. And I believe you would, at least, be better suited to the Healer career than the teaching one.”
“Put me down!” Harry’s arms were holding Draco firmly, and his chest was warm against Draco’s side. Draco ignored the flush rising in his cheeks and battered at Harry’s chest.
Draco stood in the window, watching the dark shape of the school owl he’d chosen get farther and farther away until it melted into the ever-darkening dusky sky.
“You’ll be fine,” he replied, and Draco shook his head sadly, making Harry laugh as they turned into the dining hall. Harry spotted Daphne, her long blond hair tied back in it’s usual green-ribboned ponytail; Simon, sitting close to Daphne with a fond smile on his face as he looked at her; Camille, in a creamy sweater, chattering away to Amelie, who was eating her croissant with a pensive expression as she listened. All their closest friends at Beauxbatons.
Harry bolted upright, panting hard. He could feel sweat beading on his brow, and he’s glad for the curtains around his bed so no one will see him like this. It’s pitch-dark, and he could hear the soft breathing of the other boys, asleep around him. Harry sighed quietly and pulled his knees to his chest. He knew sleep would not return to him that night. So he lay awake and watched the shadows flicker on the ceiling.
“I’m so glad they didn’t strangle each other,” whispered Harry to Hermione as they walk down to the Great Hall. The two of them are slightly behind Ron and Malfoy, who are arguing over whether the Holyhead Harpies would still be top of the league without Gwenog Jones. Hermione smiled a little as she watches them.
The flames flashing vivid green, bright and blinding, just like when Harry had died and the last thing he’d seen was a green light, overtaking his vision as Voldemort laughed-
“Go ahead, then. You need to think only of the memory, let it fill you up. Remember vividly how you felt.” he instructed, and Draco raised his wand.
But the thing that scared him the most is that he still wanted to confide in someone, even now. He wanted someone to comfort him, to understand him, to tell him it’s alright. His mother stopped doing that a long time ago, but Draco missed it. Tears seep down his cheeks and he swiped at them, disgusted with himself for crying like a weakling. He’s shaking. The longing and anger and disgust sweep through him, leaving him empty, alone.
“Yeah, it is. Steam’s rising in spirals, mother-of-pearl sheen.” he agreed, sitting back down, and Harry congratulates himself on not messing it up.
Potter fell to the side with a grunt and they both struggle to sit up. Draco’s eyes are drawn to the other boy almost instinctively, against his will, looking at pink lips and tan skin and those damn green eyes. No, no, no, thought Draco frantically. He cannot find Potter attractive. He hated him, for Merlin’s sake! He hated everything about Potter, from his black hair to his chiseled nose and oh god this needed to stop.
“I just miss them.” Harry whispered. “Sometimes I miss them so much it aches, and other days I’m so mad at them for leaving me.” He could see Sirius, Remus, Fred, Dumbledore, Tonks in his mind. Remembered the warmth of their hugs, the sparkle in their eyes, the timber of their laugh. Draco said nothing, but leaned into Harry slightly, a silent, steady presence by his side that helped center him. “And some days I’m so angry with myself for messing up and causing their deaths.”
“I asked him the same thing on the way back. He just said something like, I don’t hate Malfoy, I just dislike him, but I wasn’t just going to not help him when he needed it.”
Don’t fight him, don’t get baited, chanted Draco’s mind as he stared coldly at the other boy, struggling to clamp down on his anger. He knew this would happen eventually, he’d expected it. Draco whipped around without another word and headed towards the boy’s dormitory.
Those words had stayed at the forefront of Draco’s mind and given him the strength to fight through his panic and finally show his scar to someone, to talk about one of his darkest days. And Harry hadn’t been disgusted, or cruel, or anything that Draco had feared. When Draco had searched his green eyes, he’d seen only compassion, empathy.
Had he been talking about Voldemort? What if Draco did die and it was Harry's fault? His fault for not stopping Draco in time, for not figuring out this secret mission Draco seems to be on, his fault... Draco had been forced into this, after all. With his father being a Death Eater, the whole family of Malfoy a group of pureblood Slytherin maniacs, with no one to guide him out; steer him right. Voldemort is
The task is done, but without Draco having to live with the guilt of killing another person. Without that one act to taint his soul for the rest of his life.
Now, this makes things a tad bit complicated. In fact, it's a bloody mess. Whenever he's around Malfoy, Harry doesn't quite know what to do with himself. Naturally, he keeps up appearances for he isn't one to become flustered in the face of his enemies, but internally he is constantly screaming when Malfoy is around. It happens that the two get so caught up in their constant bickering during class, it is more often than not the very main reason for Harry's continuously failed potions. Of course he's going to ruin Harry's grades as well. Git. Even worse is when Malfoy decides to get up all close and personal, trying to act cool by shouting his insults mere inches from Harry's face. The (questionably imaginary) sexual tension drives Harry
“Probably not,” agreed Draco conversationally, and when Harry pouted he gave him a quick kiss. “You do have nice eyes, though. Distinctly un-toad like. Very green.”
“I just think having all this animosity isn’t good for you. Any of you,” she added when Blaise and Pansy glance at each other skeptically.
“Hey, you- this is all of my favorite foods and shit!” exclaimed Draco, giving Harry a surprised grin. Harry gave him a smile, suddenly glad for the dim lighting that concealed the flush on his cheeks.
“So,” commented Draco nonchalantly. “Why did Potter tag along with you last night to bring me to the hospital wing, exactly?” A trace of amusement flashed across Daphne’s face.
He made his way to the Great Hall, dodging Peeves, who was cackling as he dropped inkwells onto the shrieking students in the hallway. A few prefects were bellowing at him, and some people were screaming as they dove out of the line of fire. Harry held his bag over his head and ducked around a corner before entering the Great Hall.
“None of your business. And stop looking at me like that, Potter!” he exclaimed. Their eyes kept meeting and Potter had a gleam in his green eyes like he’s trying to figure Draco out. It made him uncomfortable.
“Did you know that there are five different variations of the Chinese Fireball dragon?” said Hermione suddenly, and Draco scoffed.
“Hello, Draco.” came a mild voice, and Luna turned round. Draco saw she was stroking the bony nose of a thestral, and slowly walked forward.
Harry pointed to the two broomsticks that he’d retrieved earlier that day from their spaces in the broomshed, and Draco smiled, looking as wondrous as any of the stars overhead.
“I told you I don’t care about that! You’re not that person, Draco, you never were!” exclaimed Harry, his thumb stroking Draco’s hand, trying to comfort him. I hate that he’s
“Yes, but the way you were cutting, you would’ve chopped off a finger and not even noticed. I’ll finish.”
Harry arched his back and yelped again. “Jesus, that’s freezing,” he exclaimed, and Draco smiled, examining his nails in a façade of boredom as Harry batted at his jacket.
“We love your hair, ‘Mione.” he said. “Especially when you’re in Potions and it puffs up, like the cat’s.” Hermione feigned outrage and punched him gently, and Harry laughed.
The next morning Harry arrived at Charms class with Ron and Hermione. Professor Flitwick’s standing on a tall stack of books.
“I can’t explain it to you right now, it’ll take too long.” he said, lounging in his seat with an easy grace. Harry frowned.
“Alright.” he finally said cautiously, eyeing Harry like he thought he would announce it as a joke, and they pick up their bags and walk out of the classroom. Harry saw Daphne watching them leave, and she smiled a little when he met her eyes.
“I liked it though.” Harry said suddenly, not totally sure why. Draco looked up at him, and Harry studied his wide grey eyes, still framed with smears of gold.
And Pansy, with her confident, brash, uncaring way of life. She was quite cunning, and always would happily join Draco in nagging this person or that. She was also the one he had been closest too, and confided in the most. She had understood his problems, understood him. She still did, and Draco was oddly comforted by that.
“No problem.” She gave him a small, subdued smile and Harry and Daphne walked down the empty halls to the Hospital Wing. It’s dimly lit, with only the flickering torches on the wall providing light. The windows that they pass show the dark mass of the Forbidden Forest, and Harry can just barely make out Hagrid’s hut at the border of the forest
Draco blinked at the weirdness of the situation that had just occurred, and quietly moved to the other side of the group, behind some Hufflepuffs.
“What if we visited together? You could see your mom, and meet Andromeda and Teddy. And I could see Andromeda and Teddy. And we could tell them about- well- us.” Harry suggested, plunking down next to him on the bed. Draco tilted his head.
“...so eight of you will be taking the Floo Network back to Hogwarts,” Madam Maxime was saying in her heavily accented English. “Minerva has informed me that two of you will be Apparating together back to the castle in lieu of the Floo Network, Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter.” she finished, and Harry exchanged a surprised, but relieved look with Draco.
“It was,” she agreed, and they all laughed. Amelie coaxed the story out of Harry, which distracted him until they got to the primary school.
“How was it with Greengrass?” Hermione whispered to him under the noise of scratching quills, and Harry glanced at her.
“Me too,” Malfoy says quietly, before walking away and out of the library. Harry stares after him until he disappeared from view. He slumps back in his seat with a sigh. Well, that hadn’t gone
“So,” began Potter after ten minutes of silence, sweeping a hand through his dark hair, “You’re going to France?”
There was a gorgeous phoenix tattoo, inked in abstract swirls of vivid reds and oranges that greatly resembled flame. The tattoo had its wings outstretched, and covered almost all of Draco’s burn scar.
“Why do you care?” Draco asked quietly, warring with himself. He wanted desperately to confide in someone, in the boy sitting next to him. At the same time he was trying to restrain himself, because some inner voice still protested that no, Draco shouldn’t tell him anything.
“Hell yes. I want to go on that trip. The Healer program’s supposed to be top-notch.” she replied as he pushed open the portrait and they step out.
Hermione grinned, her eyes brightening. “I don’t think I want to do that either, but there are so many options! I mean, you could study something, like wandlore or Transfiguration, or you could be a shopkeeper or go abroad, or I could even take SPEW further, or-”
“Oh, nothing.” Draco replied nonchalantly. She gave him a look, but he ignored it. “So ready for France?”
“The unicorns like hanging out here. There’s one, o’er there.” commented Hagrid, pointing at a silvery-white shape that canters into the forest.
“Can’t sleep. Or I don’t feel like sleeping.” Harry replies, and Malfoy quirked an eyebrow before standing up gracefully. The table before him was clear of all of his things. Harry hadn’t noticed him cleaning up to leave.
“Cologne, something flowery, and snow,” lied Draco, listing random things off the top of his head. Harry nodded, before going to get two phials for them. Draco watched him walk off, his fingers digging into the edge of the table. God, Harry Potter would be the death of him.
“It’s going to be fun, and you will show up. Knowing the two of you, you’d probably try to skip it,” she declared. “And you have to wear nice clothes, Harry.” Camille eyed him sternly, and Draco snickered.
His eyes fell on the other people at the eighth year table, all chatting away merrily. It was so surreal, being back here, eating in the Great Hall, when the last time he had seen some of these people was in the Battle of Hogwarts facing off against Death Eaters.
“It wasn’t a real Patronus, though.” Draco sighed. It had taken much more energy than he’d expected, and only for that? He was a little disappointed in himself.
Falling in love, and Draco could already tell that nothing either of them could do would stop him. Part of him shied at the thought, because caring that much for someone… it took a different kind of courage than the courage needed to fight. Something more like the bravery it had taken Draco to confide in someone else.
“How did the four of them make it?” questioned Draco, fascinated with the map. He glanced at Potter and saw a small, wistful smile on his face as he watched the map.
And sing it did, about most of the usual things; the traits of the houses, the four founders. A song more like the first one Harry had ever heard, and less like the ones more recently, when the hat tried to advise the school. After a round of applause, the Headmistress opened a long roll of parchment and began to call forward the first-years.
But Theo was in France now, and that was one less friendly face at school. Draco’s carriage rolled to a stop and he pushed open the door and stepped out, moving quickly so he won’t have to deal with the three Gryffindors in the carriage behind him. He strode up the steps, following the trickle of students still making their way to the Great Hall, and set down his trunk with everyone else’s luggage.
The first thing he noticed was that he was glowing. His skin was glowing, and glittery, and his eyes were outlined in gold.
“Alright class, today is the weekly trip down to the primary school, so everyone follow down to the carriages.” announced the teacher, and Harry was distracted momentarily.
“Fuck you, Potter.” Draco snapped, and Harry chuckled. They resumed walking to Potions, walking near a Ravenclaw boy who was pale and drawn and gave Draco a hateful glare, which Draco ignored pointedly. The blond took it a step further and grabbed Harry’s tie, pulling him in for a long, slow, burning kiss that made the hateful-looking boy cough in
“Hey, Hermione.” he replied, noticing for the first time the boy lying on the bed next to him. Draco. He looked as if he were sleeping, but there were dark circles under his eyes.
“Hermione!” Harry replied, hugging her back as much as he could. She finally loosened her grip on them and stepped back to see them, beaming. Ron walked up behind her, grinning.
“Yeah.” replied Draco. He was not looking forward to rejecting Theo, not to mention he was way too drunk for this. His head was spinning, and the flashing lights and sounds from the dance floor weren’t helping. Theo began walking towards a hallway, beckoning Draco to follow him, which he reluctantly did, stumbling occasionally. “God, I hate being drunk.” Draco muttered, and Theo chuckled as they stood in the dark hallway, which was blessedly a little quieter than the main room of the club.
“Draco,” said Harry softly. “It’ll be alright. Stop overthinking it.” He squeezed Draco’s hand reassuringly, and Draco nodded silently. He was still a touch apprehensive about what lay ahead of them, whatever Harry said.
“Yeah, of course.” replied Weasley, ever the gentleman around Hermione, and gently steered the two of them back down to the pitch. Draco and Potter follow and hop off their brooms, and the four head back up to the school. Draco walked with Potter, behind Weasley and Hermione. The night vision is wearing away, and it’s pitch-black out. Draco can barely see the Gryffindor next to him.
“Well, Harry, I don’t think that-” Granger cut off her words as she spotted him over Weasley’s shoulder, and they all turned around to face him. Weasley scowled at him, and Granger had her lips drawn together and her arms crossed, and Potter was obviously attempting to school his face into neutrality.
“Of course I can walk, Potter.” Malfoy sat up with a determined expression and struggled to a standing position, leaning on Harry heavily with his foot held off the ground.
Harry held out a hand from where he was standing on the edge of the ice, and Draco grabbed it, clinging to him like a lifeline as he stepped on and immediately slipped. Draco yelped, his feet moving wildly for a steady surface. Harry was chuckling, and Draco glared at him when he managed to stand, his arms held out wide in the hopes he would stay balanced.
“Brilliant. You coming, Hermione?” Harry looked at her expectantly and she smiled and shook her head.
“I could see them together, actually.” Harry said thoughtfully. “Wait. You can take people? Damn, this really is the Yule Ball all over again.” he commented with a sad shake of his head. Parvati Patil leaned over from where she was walking with her sister.
“Come on, we’re falling behind.” he exclaimed, and the two of them ran toward where Draco was holding the door for them. “Thanks, Draco.” said Harry, out of breath as they entered the building.
Malfoy blinks rapidly, and Harry decides to leave him be. So he turned and left, glancing one last time over his shoulder at the other boy, who stands still against the wall.
“Well,” he said. “The things I remember most- most fondly, I suppose, were teatimes with Mother. When it was just me and her, things were much simpler. No expectations, nothing to be worried about. She always asked about my day, and let me talk and talk as much as I wanted. We used to sneak out at night and she would spread a blanket on the lawn and point out my constellation.” Draco reminisced, a soft smile on his face.
The next day Harry goes to Transfiguration, accompanied by Ron, who’s deep in a monologue on this year’s Quidditch Cup.
Harry walks aimlessly around the castle, poking his head into forgotten classrooms or dusty hallways, gradually making his way to one of his favorite spots. It was quiet, secluded, and he’d come to think of it as his spot. He went there to think, and just to be somewhere by himself. Whenever he travels the corridors at night it always reminds him of being eleven years old again, wandering around under his father’s Invisibility Cloak. How he misses being so young, looking forward to the years ahead of him.
The Snitch suddenly dropped and resumed flight a foot from the grassy ground. Harry and Malfoy follow it without hesitation, both speeding downwards and pulling out of the dive with seconds to spare. Harry grinned. He’s never played a Seeker’s game like this, with someone who’s just as skilled as him. It’s bloody brilliant. Harry stretched out his arm, the tips of his fingers mere inches from the Snitch, just like Malfoy’s.
If Pansy and even Greg had figured it out, maybe others would notice and that was the last thing he wanted. Fortunately, his friends hadn't brought up the subject again and Draco was also pretending that the conversation with Pansy had never happened. It was easier to run away from his feelings than to face them. Perhaps it had been a mistake to return to Hogwarts after all.
At dinner he couldn't stop staring at Potter again. He waited for a sign. He had to ask for something in return for giving Draco a new life.
As he was packing his things for school, Draco saw his mother watching him from the doorway. Draco turned and gave her a questioning look. She just smiled and walked back out of his room. Draco knew she was happy that he was going back to Hogwarts and inwardly Draco knew it was the right decision. He would probably go insane in this flat. After all, he couldn't sleep all day. At least not without sleeping potions and he couldn't get his hands on those at the moment. His old friends were coming back to Hogwarts too. Although he wasn't sure if they were still his friends. He had received letters from Greg and Pansy, but he hadn't seen them after the trial.
"Of course," Draco lied and returned his attention to her. He read through the notes she held out to him and compared them to his own.
The tutoring went better than Draco had imagined. Potter learned quickly and he had to admit to himself that he enjoyed the lessons. However, Draco also noticed how he was becoming more and more fixated on Potter. Whether in class, at dinner or in the common room. He couldn't stop watching Potter and even his friends were beginning to notice. Pansy rolled his eyes when he spoke about Potter and Greg just nodded with a strange expression on his face that he couldn't interpret. Draco knew it wasn't good for him. Potter had enough friends and people who cared about him. When school was over, they would probably never see each other again, so it was probably best to end the tutoring again. Potter had learned a lot and didn't really need him anymore and the sooner he ended it, the sooner he would get rid of his obsession.
"Not everyone always expects something in return. Why don't you just thank Harry?" Granger said impatiently.
Their classmates had taken longer to accept it. Even after weeks, Draco could still hear whispers when he walked down the corridors with Harry. They had debated for a long time whether to make it public or not. Draco wanted to keep it a secret. Even though he was sure about his feelings for Harry, he wasn't ready for the whole world (his mother included) to know. Harry had seen it differently. He was one of those people who didn't care what others thought and preferred to snog all over the place. Eventually he had given in. After breakfast he had waited for Harry and kissed him. The looks from his classmates unsettled him, but when he saw Harry's beaming face, he knew it was worth it. With Harry he was happy after a long time and the dark thoughts had left his head even during the day.
Draco looked at his sleeping face and regretted all the previous years when they had hated each other. It had been wasted time. Slowly, he reached out and touched his curly hair. Draco felt wrong about it, like he was doing something forbidden. Which was actually true. He wanted to pull his hand back again but suddenly Potter held it tightly. Apparently he had just woken up, Draco realised awkwardly. Potter was still holding his hand and he didn't dare pull it away. Slowly Potter rose from the sofa and released his hand.
"Everyone please find a partner" he heard Professor Slughorn say and looked around. He usually worked with Greg, but he didn't want to leave Pansy alone. Not after pustules had been conjured on her face last week. Besides, accidents often happened in potions, so he didn't want anyone deliberately cursing her again. Looking around, he noticed that Potter didn't have a partner either. Draco got up to join him quickly before anyone else did and luckily for him, he had secured the seat next to Potter before Longbottom could. Potter looked at him in surprise but said nothing. He put his book in the middle so Draco could peek in and got up to get the ingredients.
Draco couldn't stand waiting any longer and made the first move. He said goodbye to Greg and Pansy and followed Potter and his friends. Weasley was the first to notice. He stopped and said something to Potter and Granger, whereupon they also stopped and turned to him. Draco was annoyed that he hadn't taken Greg with him. He had never faced the three of them alone. He had always been surrounded by Greg and Vincent. He hadn't thought about Vincent for a long time, but he knew that Greg thought about him every day. Why had Vincent been so stupid he asked himself and swallowed the rising sadness.
As the first days of school passed, Draco slowly got used to the school routine again. He hadn't been to school for a long time and inwardly thanked his mother for pushing him. To his surprise, he was really popular. Not a day went by without students he had never spoken to greeting him in the corridors and even the teachers were unusually nice to him. However, it was particularly strange in the common room when others asked him how it had felt to spy for the Order on the Dark Lord. At first Draco had ignored them, but at some point he had started to play along. He enjoyed the admiration of his classmates even if he didn't deserve it. Greg, too, was settling in. Draco spent most of his time with him and in his presence, their classmates were also friendly to him.
He handed them to Potter so he could try. Draco knew he was a failure at brewing and secretly, he was glad that at least he was bad at one thing. In the past, he would have used that weakness to bully him about it, but he wasn't like he used to be.
"How did you know I was here?" asked Potter in surprise when he recognised Draco. He no longer played for the Quidditch team, but Draco had watched him fly and had to admit to himself that Potter really had always been the better of them. Actually, he had wanted to talk to Potter after he landed his broom, but he had marched straight to the changing room so Draco had decided to wait.
Draco nodded and followed him. They walked down the long spiral staircase from the south tower and slowly Draco grew impatient.
"They would have send you to Azkaban if I hadn't lied" he said, brushing a wet strand of hair from his face.
Draco thought a lot about Potter's words. He now had the chance to make up for everything. But how was he going to do it?
Pansy, however, was having a particularly hard time. She had been the one who wanted to hand over Potter to the Dark Lord. No one had forgiven her for that and almost daily she was the victim of curses that made her school life even harder. But Pansy didn't want to go to McGonagall, her pride wouldn't allow it and Draco admired her for the way she endured all the bullying without buckling. She stood by her actions and was prepared to accept the consequences. Unlike himself.
Malfoy clears his throat softly, and Harry looks up from his study of Malfoy’s hands to meet the other boy’s gaze, reddening slightly at being caught. The blond has a barely-there smile on his face when they lock eyes again.
“Yes.” confirmed Harry. “It didn’t hurt at all, either.” he added, and Draco nodded slowly, his hand moving almost unconsciously to his left forearm, where the scar lay. “Do you want to go get dinner?” asked Harry, and Draco frowned a little. “Or we could go grab something from the kitchens.”
“Well than get off your whiny ass, Draco, because I am taking you ice skating.” ordered Harry, staring at him pointedly. Draco sighed.
Pansy poked his cheek and went upstairs, and Draco wearily walked over to the three Gryffindors sequestered on a sofa in the corner of the common room, sitting down next to Harry, who curved a steady arm around him and tugged Draco against him.
“Yes,” replied Draco without hesitation. He didn’t mind talking about this with her. He’d known her for so long it was like talking to a sister, and she never judged him. She nodded slowly, thoughtfully.
“Details, details.” he said airily. “Don’t worry, I’ve heard worse from Pansy.” Pansy kicked him and he laughed at her as Daphne immediately began trying to pry the story out of her.
“I love you.” he said, and Draco’s answering smile was wonderful. To think that he could make anyone so happy, let alone Draco Malfoy. His gorgeous, charming, witty boyfriend.
Twenty minutes later, Draco strolled out of the bathroom in his pajamas, and Harry sat up indignantly.
“Seamus, you can’t go around attacking people!” exclaimed Harry. When Seamus looked up at him defiantly, Harry threw up his hands and walked over to where Malfoy lay against the wall, Daphne kneeling next to him. Malfoy’s obviously unconscious; his eyes are closed, and Harry saw red staining Malfoy’s blond hair and with a jolt, remembered the fight in the bathroom in sixth year. There was blood in his hair then, too.
“Quite good. You know, you have less Wrackspurts around your head than you did before.” Harry smiled bemusedly. “Well, this is me.” said Luna, gesturing to a spot at the Ravenclaw table. “Goodbye.”
“Are the core classes the same at Beauxbatons? Like Potions, Transfigurations, Charms, etcetera?” Harry smothered a grin. Only Hermione would actually use the word ‘etcetera’.
They went down to breakfast, sitting down with Daphne (sitting cozily next to Simon), Camille (wearing the new sweater Draco had gotten her with a smug expression on her face), and Amelie (waggling her eyebrows at Draco and Harry suggestively). Draco sighed and rolled his eyes at Amelie, snagging a flaky croissant from the middle of the table.
“Nice to meet you, we like this place too.” said Camille, and the other two Beauxbatons students echoed her. “We’ve heard about you from them.” She chuckled.
“It’ll be weird having other people in our dorm again,” said Harry, sighing as he dumped spellbooks into his trunk. Draco resisted the urge to make him pack neatly, instead of just throwing everything in.
“Mint sprigs. I add them to everything I brew, because the only effects it can have on any potion is to make it taste good or to counterbalance the side effects. For instance,” continued Draco, nodding at the potion Harry held, “no steam will come out of your ears.”
Draco let Weasley win; it’s not too hard, as Weasley’s as good as him at Wizard’s chess. After that Weasley is significantly friendlier to Draco, and the four of them sat in the common room, talking about classes and Quidditch until people start trickling back in before dinner.
If he was lucky, thought Harry, maybe Malfoy’s indifferent mood would stick and this wouldn’t be any harder than it had to be. He went and sat at the desk assigned to him and waited for the Slytherin to join him.
“Come along, Draco,” called his mother, snapping him back to the present. He walked to her side and glimpsed the outside lawn, to the Aurors waiting under a gray sky to bring him to the school train. He felt a great dislike for them, for the shame of being walked to the train like a dog. But he was Draco Malfoy, ex Death Eater, and of course could not be trusted out of house arrest by himself. Narcissa set down his trunk and gave him a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek. “I’ll see you at Christmas, darling.”
“Not my fault?” he repeated scathingly. “Of course it’s my fault. If I wasn’t with him he wouldn’t have been hurt. It was me that boy was aiming for.”
“What did he say?” asked Daphne, coming over from the window. Draco sat up and stared Amelie down, but she kept going anyway.
But then someone was pressing kisses to his neck, and Draco smiled, rolling over to see Harry, grinning.
“Greengrass, you don’t want to be associated with a Death Eater.” If he was being honest he did kind of want to get to know her. She seemed like the type of Slytherin he would enjoy hanging out with. But he didn’t want people to bully her as well as him.
“Honestly, I forgot about that,” Harry said, leaning on the armrest. “I haven’t really thought about it. But I don’t think I want to be an Auror anymore- I’ve had enough of that life.”
They left their school bags in the classroom and went down to the carriages, tramping through the empty hallways.
Draco looked around and saw Daphne standing beside his chair, a concerned expression on his face. He swallowed.
“Hermione’s the exact same.” replied Harry somewhat carefully, and Blaise snorted and shook his head in amusement.
“Harry, you’ll be shadowing Amelie, she’s over there.” Camille waved to a pretty Asian girl sitting at another table, and she waved back. Harry nodded, but gaped when Draco stole his bacon.
Ron snorted into his tea, and glanced at Harry with amusement. The last time Hagrid had wanted a lady friend for one of his charges, it had been for Grawp.
“Don’t worry, I’ll style you.” Camille waved her hand, and Draco blinked. Harry snorted at the expression on his face.
“Maybe,” Harry replied, drawing out the syllables. He was sitting cross-legged on his bed, wrapped boxes and packages scattered haphazardly around him. Draco sighed. Might as well get up all the way, now that he was fully awake. And he was curious to see what he’d gotten.
“That’s wrong, Granger. Third law is the most important.” Hermione looked him up and down with thinly veiled contempt; she might’ve accepted his apology but she still didn’t like him, especially when he was telling her she was wrong.
“GO!” shouted Malfoy, and kicked off. Harry cursed and did the same, hearing Malfoy laugh ahead of him. Once Harry flew up high enough, the two boys circle the pitch, eyes scanning for the telltale gold glint.
“So tell me,” said Draco drowsily. “What did Harry Potter do before he came to Hogwarts?” Harry smiled slightly and shook his head. They were cuddled up together on Harry’s bed after dinner, and Harry was warm and fighting to keep from sleeping, and Draco seemed to be doing the same.
That got Harry a small smile. “You wish.” He moved his wand along the cut as he said the incantation.
Kingsley sighed. “Alright, but use your portkey at the first sign of trouble. Here, give your bag to Remus, so you can be quicker and have more manoeuvrability.”
Twenty seven days of glamours because Harry had been reasonably sure he didn’t look that bad when he went to the Weasley Sunday lunch. That was before the concerned looks from Bill and Percy - the same ones that were directed at George - before being pulled over by Ron and Hermione (who were inseparable now, and did everything together), and then Arthur, and then Ginny - before being fed enough food for three fully grown men by Molly because he was “looking terribly pale dear, what is that elf of yours feeding you?”
“Okay, so hold your hand out.” Hermione glared at Ron expectantly, who held out his hand, blushing to the tips of her ears when she took it in her own.
As a purple spell from Fleur barely missed Ginny’s ear — she’d promised not to use anything lethal, but she was also getting increasingly angrier as Ginny kept slipping away, her Veela powers flaring in a silvery glow, and Remus was getting concerned — Remus stepped in, casting two shield charms. “I think that’s enough for today.”
Voldemort skimmed past the method, listed in excruciating detail, and went down to a section helpfully labelled “
Any other words were incoherent as Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words.
carrying him, rather than levitating him — and set him down heartbreakingly gently on the bed, before pulling up the covers.
“Well, you did it yesterday despite your magic being depleted, so that shouldn’t be an issue. Do you know how it works, exactly?”
Remus took a deep breath, as the last of the Order filed in. Bill laid a hand on his shoulder and nodded, murmuring under his breath, “it’ll be fine.”
“It’s okay.” Potter almost whispered, before raising himself on his toes to reach Draco and...kissing him.
“Anti apparation wards.” Bill’s face was quickly draining of colour, as he watched the black figures outside of their house, increasing in number by the second.
A month and a half isn’t actually that long, but I’ve never been very good at sticking to projects anyway, and am quite proud of myself for not abandoning this. I’m currently writing a short fic that’s being posted on my instagram, but I will be posting the completed thing on here once it’s done.
“Number nine being within ten metres of a quidditch stadium during a match.” Blaise glared at Draco.
“Tomorrow, you can teach her.” Bill had suddenly appeared in the doorway. “It’s dark outside and we’re not having hexes thrown around the house.”
“Excellent.” Draco opened the door, and after making sure that Harry could, in fact, walk, closed the door.
So he had to apologise. That couldn’t be too hard, really. Never mind that he had never apologised in his life, to his recollection.
“I -  they - sorry” and then Potter had surged up and was clinging to Draco, still sobbing, head tucked into the crook of his neck and was murmuring “I’m sorry” between sobs, trembling like a leaf and refusing to let go. Draco brought his arms up - there was nothing else to do - and ran one hand down Potter’s back, the other at the nape of his neck, for about half an hour, until Potter stopped shaking. He purposefully ignored the words still bouncing around his mind;
Draco thought. He hadn’t wanted to be hexed, but handing Potter his cloak in front of this many people would spark all sorts of rumours.
“I’ll have a lot of fun. Don’t know about you.” Greyback grinned, showing yellow teeth and various black holes where teeth were missing.
“Well I’ve been in the library doing some research, and it doesn’t say why we would still be bonded, since I used the right incantation and hand movement.” Malfoy’s eyes flickered away from Harry’s gaze for a second.
Two days before the wedding, Scrimgeour arrived at the Burrow, where The Weasleys greeted him from behind layers of walls, whether they be walls of silence and indifference, or loud chatter and jokes to drive the silence away. He got no information regarding Harry Potter’s whereabouts, and left feeling downhearted that the ministry wouldn’t be receiving any support from the Saviour, since no one knew where he was.
Surprisingly, the Gryffindors had easily welcomed Draco into their ranks, likely following Harry’s lead. The most trouble he’d had was when the Irish one - Seamus? - had thought Draco was on his way to stealing his boyfriend. He’d been obviously relieved when Harry had kept stealing food from his plate.
Severus' gaze snapped to the left as Draco walked in. Severus was glad to see the boy was okay — he’d been concerned about leaving him alone overnight in the manor, but was quite convinced that Lucius maybe, and Narcissa definitely, would protect him. He didn’t look very well — he was shivering slightly, and his hair was dirty, which was odd. Severus’ gaze travelled downwards, noting the rumpled clothing, and…
TW: some death (I.e. recap of Dumbles’ death from the first chapter, and another description by someone. Not too gory, though).
Draco flung his hand out, magic coursing through his body alongside the adrenaline, negating the need for a wand. The gate opened with a creak, and Draco and Severus flung themselves around the corner of a wall to get out of the line of fire. Severus tightened his grip on Harry, placed his free hand on Draco’s arm and apparated into the night
Draco didn’t sleep the first night back in the manor, rather spending the night carving runes in his doorway against snakes and freezing every time a shadow passed across the thin shaft of light along the bottom of his door. He smiled grimly as the sun came up, illuminating the delicate carvings. No snake would be getting through this door.
But students started to file past him as he stood there in shock, and he closed his oddly dry mouth as he was jostled for the fourth time. He knew for a fact that he wouldn’t have something as mundane as being jostled in a dream.
. A bit of rock won’t stop it,” Severus replied, already moving. Millicent started murmuring quiet spells at a section of wall while he quickly blasted the chains holding it to the floor, before using the clankers to corral it upwards. The dragon quickly realised it was free, and climbed up the wall with more agility than one would have expected of an animal that big.
Voldemort quickly repeated the same process with the mudblood, pleased to hear that she hadn’t told anyone else. And since Potter hadn’t told anyone, and Dumbledore was dead...his secret was safe. Slughorn may suspect, but that idiot wouldn’t say anything, at the very least due to his Slytherin self-preservation instincts. If he even remembered.
“S-sure.” Harry looked at Draco - he never stuttered. Of course, the prat had forgotten his cloak and was shivering.
He was Fed Up of having to skirt around corridors to avoid being hexed (or at least reduce how often it happened). He was Fed Up of the professors being condescendingly fair, especially when his new wand was acting up (which it did on a regular basis, thanks to Draco having to go to a sub-par wandmaker, what with the Dark Lord making the idiot decision to torture Ollivander until he couldn’t produce wands for a while yet).
“Three brothers travelled down a lonely, winding road by twilight. They came across a river — too wide to jump or levitate over, with no bridges to be seen for miles. Being talented wizards, they simply crafted a bridge and crossed it.
Draco sat on a rock, watching the sun set behind the Forbidden Forest. He loved the image of black silhouettes on a sunset background - there was something about the crisp lines and block colour over a gradient that appealed to him. When the sky was mostly a dark blue-grey, surprisingly not revealing many stars, Draco headed back up to the school, shivering slightly. He walked quickly through the common room - now, rather than glaring at him, everyone ignored him, which Draco preferred - and walked into their room. The drapes around Potter’s bed were tightly closed, and there was a strong silencing charm around them.
A shudder went around the room, apart from Kreacher, who began muttering something about blood–traitors.
He’d registered this in the split second he’d bought as a masked death eater fell, petrified, while two others flailed as bright flames ate at their cloaks.
AHHH ITS THE PENULTIMATE CHAPTER!!! I’m going to save my extra long note for the end of the next chapter but I’d just like to say I appreciate every single kudos, comment and DM I receive from you all, they mean the world to me ❤️
, never mind an extra two fully grown wizards.” Ron nodded at Harry, and then the two fully grown wizards in question. As if that sentence triggered something, Malfoy swooned, almost collapsing onto Snape.
Voldemort gazed at his old wand, for a moment. It had served him well — allowed him to get this far. And it had been the first thing he’d gotten from the wizarding world — the first physical sign he was special. But he’d always
Narcissa and Bill discreetly removed the wards at a back entrance, and all the Weasleys crept across the lawn. The plan was for them to look for the snake while causing general chaos across the grounds.
Draco had nodded, but done the rest of the cuts on Harry’s torso in silence, not speaking until he saw Harry’s back. Harry shivered slightly as Draco’s fingers had run along the old scars.
He hadn’t planned for Draco to see his scars, but it hadn’t been as bad as expected. Draco hadn’t expected anything from him - even when Harry had offered, he hadn’t asked anything.
They arrived at the potions classroom just as the class were entering the room, and Ron and Harry joined the line of eight years - they were red-faced and panting, but on time.
He realised it was very close to the Feast, so Draco power walked down to the Great Hall, thankful for his long legs. He slid into a seat at the end of the Slytherin table - more sparse than usual, but not as bad as Draco was expecting. The song was terrible, but it always was. Draco was furious at the lack of enthusiasm from his house when the children were sorted into Slytherin, but he refused to draw attention to himself - it wouldn’t do any good for anyone. He tried for comforting smiles - until his gaze was drawn to the Gryffindor table.
The four conscious people stared at each other for an uncomfortable five seconds, before Hermione broke the silence. “We should probably get him down somewhere.”
Finishing off the bread, he went to the bathroom. The door was a bit jammed, so Draco threw his shoulder against it, a bit suspicious, but it easily gave way.
“Of course — right this way, my Lord.” Lucius strode off into the west wing of the Manor, leading Voldemort to the library nestled on the third floor.
“Bad luck again, Harry,” the Weasel said, dropping a look at Draco that rivalled Flitwick’s for subtlety, or lack of.
Potter mimicked Draco’s expression, raising one eyebrow, before rocking back on his chair (that boy is a hazard) and saying “I could leave.”
) before turning to his friends and muttering something to them. Granger looked satisfied, and dragged along the Weasel, who looked...shocked? Whatever Potter was planning to do to him must be bad, if it disturbed the Weasel.
Harry sighed - he didn’t want to have to order Kreacher to do anything he didn’t want to, and Kreacher enjoyed calling Harry ‘Master’ to spite him so he tolerated it. “That’s fine, Kreacher.” Harry leaned against the wall, a glass of pumpkin juice in hand (it had floated right to him straight after his and Kreacher’s conversation) and let his mind drift again. No sooner had he zoned out than the door opened, revealing Draco, who was clearly trying to hide how out of breath he was by taking overly slow, deep ones. However, the blush on his pale cheeks betrayed his exertion.
“The last thing is we need is a better way to communicate. I think I’ll leave this to Hermione.” Remus stepped backwards, to make room for Hermione at the head of the table.
they followed the Dark Lord willingly, after he did this to them on a regular basis, she would never understand.
It was doing Harry a great deal of good - he’d gotten used to the hall, at long last, at the start of November (he’d outright refused to do anything on Halloween, but thankfully the pair were quite understanding considering that that was the day his parents had died). He didn’t feel as anxious, talking to people outside of his group, since Draco was always there to help him. He hadn’t gone to the October Hogsmeade weekend, but Hermione and Draco had insisted that they all go down on the November weekend.
It sounded oddly like Snape’s voice, which Harry decided to ignore. That little voice kept him alive during the last year, and while there wasn’t a need for it, Harry found himself suddenly on edge at the weirdest of times - while they were sitting in the common room, in the middle of an impromptu test from McGonagall. Normally, Draco was on hand to ‘casually’ rest his hand on Harry’s shoulder or knee. These casual, public touches meant that most of the student body was convinced that the pair were secretly dating. The people who didn’t think so were Ginny, who was in denial about Harry being gay, mainly due to him not coming out or explicitly breaking up with her - Ron, who still secretly harboured hostile feelings towards the Malfoy heir - Terry Boot, who wanted Harry for himself - and Zacharias Smith, who was oblivious to anything that didn’t explicitly involve him. There were also various bets in the teaching body about how long it would take for the pair to come out, with McGonagall betting by Easter, Hagrid betting by the end of the year, and Flitwick who said by the end of November, to name a few.
Harry frowned. He actually hadn’t thought about the event that had led to him being captured. Actually, he couldn’t get his head around the fact that Dumbledore was dead.
She spared a glance to the side, disappointed at the lack of emotion she felt at the sight of her husband — the man she was supposed to love — being tortured. Then again, it wasn’t a surprise. The little amount of love she’d felt towards him had dissipated; maybe when he took the dark mark, definitely by the time he’d forced their only son to.
“There’s one I can do which shows the state of a person’s magical core, which will be needed since Potter spent at least six weeks in a cell that drained his magic.”
He shook his head, heading towards the bathroom. He took a long shower, relishing the scalding water on his skin, scrubbing it raw as if he could scrub the guilt away.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Fine.” He cast a disillusionment charm on himself, shivering at the feeling. “On an unrelated note, how’s my disillusionment charm?”
Harry didn’t know how long it had been anymore. He didn’t know who brought his food, or how often it was arriving. He was weak, barely able to sit up to drink some water, and always shivering.
“I’m so proud of you, my son,” he said, reaching up with one frail hand to cup Draco’s face. Draco carefully schooled his face into a neutral expression, not sure what he felt towards his father. Love, of course, but only the kind that was expected between family. Hatred, at what he’d forced Draco into. Disgust, at the unfounded beliefs he’d drilled into Draco. Draco carefully turned the corners of his mouth upwards into a small smile, forcing his eyes to soften at the edges.
Hermione had been less sure, but had allowed Ron to tell her to wait for at least a day, especially since neither of them had known what exactly was entailed in horcrux hunting.
“Actually, that would be good — all the big safehouses are too far away to get to safely, and have stronger wards that can't be manipulated as easily, so it's been a bit cramped.”
“Well, it’s small, and no one would notice it being missing…I’m willing to bet he has it in that nest of his.”
“Only if he’s killed by the Dark Lord,” he made a face, “but the potion relies quite a bit on Ancient Magic, so of course
“Well, there was the whole Chosen One thing. And that prophecy.” Harry’s words felt distant; he might as well already be under the Manor, walls closing in, bars slamming shut over the door. It was just him and Voldemort; except this time, there was nothing stopping Voldemort from killing him.
, exactly, but a couple had gone awry and Severus had had to heal his arm multiple times. Severus was still mad at him for testing on himself, but he
“It’s fine, we had a nice walk in the rain.” Draco smirked, before dragging Harry to their dorm room. He had no intention of getting caught up in a conversation with anyone else when he’d just kissed
A plan was quickly formulated around the now heavily crowded dining table of how to break into Gringotts, the one place in the world it was supposed to be impossible to break into. Other than Hogwarts, Harry remembered — but then again, he would probably be breaking into the castle soon as well.
. Furious, Ron went through the rock into an eerily green cave, mostly taken up by a massive lake, which was completely still, and a small island was situated in the middle.
; it would take him a week at most to be confident in using it on Potter. He’d already tried dittany on them, but the potion had as much of an effect as water would, meaning they’d either been caused by dark magic, or cursed objects; likely Bellatrix’s silver knives. He didn’t know what curses she put on them, but he hadn’t sensed any dark magic around them, so they were likely the basic ones to make the tissue immune to healing potions, rather than relying on residual magic. Thankfully, Potter had no damage to his organs, which would have been even more difficult for Draco to heal.
“I’m freezing. Can we go back now?” Draco was shivering under Harry’s hands. He cast an umbrella charm over both of them, before casting a drying charm over their clothes. The
To their dismay, they found no one; just a pair of small footsteps that twisted slightly at the end. Bill and Percy arrived to shouting, running, and a body on the ground.
A few days and many kisses later, Draco had admitted to his friends that perhaps he was in love with Harry after all. Instead of a surprised reaction, Pansy had just rolled her eyes and Greg had asked why it had taken so long. Harry had told his friends too. Granger had been quite understanding. Only Weasley hadn't taken it so well. He had kept muttering "Why Malfoy of all people?"
"Too much fluid is lost when you use that much power" Draco explained calmly. Even though he would have liked to mock him a little, he didn't.
Potter looked at the potion with satisfaction and Professor Slughorn, who was standing behind them a short time later, also looked pleased.
"What happened?" asked Draco, looking at her black hair, which looked as if she had reached into a socket.
"Five-grader," she replied grimly, trying to brush her hair downwards, but it bounced back into the same position as before. Her expression became even more grim.
"Draco are you even listening to me?" asked Pansy as they sat in the common room doing homework together.
Before Draco could think about it further, the door to his compartment was opened. Just as Draco was about to close it again with magic and then lock it, two girls entered. They were from ravenclaw, but Draco did not know their names.
"I was just busy. I had a lot to think about" Draco said after a while and leaned against the wall, sighing.
"And if the Dark Lord's mother had asked you to spare him, would you have done the same?" asked Draco mockingly.
Draco watched him go for a while longer until Pansy and Greg came up to him and asked how the lesson had gone.
"If you want to keep your reputation as a model student, I can help you" Draco said surprised by his own words. Potter had Granger. He didn't need any help from him and Draco doubted if he even wanted it.
For days, his eyes had been on Potter, but there had never been a reaction. Sometimes their eyes met, but Potter always broke eye contact quickly and turned back to his friends.
The next Thursday Draco decided to talk to Potter. They had agreed to meet later today, as Potter had some things to do, and they were alone in the common room at that time. Potter was already sitting on the sofa in front of the fireplace with his textbook. It was pleasantly warm and he had again to admit to himself that he liked the new common room.
When they added the last ingredient to the potion, it turned into a rich purple and Draco exhaled in relief. So they had done everything right. It would have been embarrassing if the potion had failed.
"I was just chopping it like you said" Potter replied, sounding like an offended child. So he was incapable of criticism too, Draco added inside to his list of Potter's weaknesses.
"Greg thinks so too" Pansy replied unimpressed. He didn't know what should make him angrier, that his friends were talking about him behind his back or that they were accusing him of being in love with Potter. Draco stood up and walked into the dormitory without looking at Pansy again.
Draco had thought it would die down after the trial. The trial in which he was declared innocent of all charges. Thanks to Potter. However he hadn’t just tried to justify what he did. No, he had simply lied. Because of his hero status, veritaserum wasn’t used out of respect when he testified, and even if he had taken it, that damned Potter would probably have been immune to it too.
He didn't know what game they were playing with him. All he knew was that he didn't want to play it anymore. Everyone should know that he had become a Death Eater by choice and had almost killed Dumbledore.
Draco looked at Potter open-mouthed in surprise. His mother had never mentioned ever talking to Potter.
"Whatever," Draco replied, frowning as he finished reading Pansy's notes. Had she really confused ginger juice with ginger peel? It looked like a tiny mistake but, if she brewed the potion like that, it would burst into flames.
"I-" a brown haired girl began, stuttering a little. Her friend put a hand on her shoulder and she continued speaking.
Sceptically, Draco entered the common room behind the painting, closely followed by Greg and Pansy. The room was much larger than his old common room in the dungeons. It was also warmer and somehow more invitingly furnished. There were a few armchairs in the corners and a brown sofa in front of the large fireplace in the middle of the room. Draco liked the large windows that flooded the room with light. It had always been gloomy in the dungeon and he had enough of darkness. The only thing that bothered him was that he had to share the common room with the other students. Fortunately, at least the dormitories were strictly separated from each other. Large wooden doors with the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff crests were on the left side of the fireplace. On the right were Ravenclaw and Slytherin. At least they were as far away from Gryffindor as possible, Draco thought, opening the door behind which was a long corridor with two branches. The tower was bigger than expected and Draco guessed that it had been enlarged with magic. The first corridor led to the boys' dormitory and Draco entered it with Greg to put his things away. A short time later, Blaise and Theodore also entered the room.
"Thank you," he murmured and an awkward silence fell. The two girls said their goodbyes and left his compartment again. Draco sighed and rested his head against the window. He hadn't been spying. Nor had he been forced, as Potter had testified in court. He had made the decision voluntarily and, ashamed, he had to admit to himself that he had even been proud that the Dark Lord had chosen him.
He had passed his exams in fifth year, but it was not proper for a Malfoy to drop out of school prematurely. He had only just managed to refrain from saying that it wasn't proper for a Malfoy to live in a ramshackle hut either. Even though he and his mother had been acquitted, they had had to donate most of their fortune to the families of the war victims. They still had the Manor, but returning was unthinkable and selling it was also proving more difficult than they had thought. His mother had hoped there might still be Death Eaters interested in the cursed house, as the Daily Prophet liked to call it. But no one wanted it. So Draco had been living with his mother in a small flat near King's Cross station for a few weeks. They lived among Muggles, because the ministry thought it would be safer if they had some distance from the wizards and the remaining Death Eaters.
"You haven't even looked at me" Harry replied, looking hurt. Draco immediately regretted it. He hadn't meant to hurt him.
Draco looked at her, aghast, and choked so hard that he started coughing violently. Loud enough that he drew the attention of the other students as well. Granger turned to him, whereupon Draco quickly averted his eyes. He stared at Pansy, stunned, and shook his head in disbelief.
His compartment door opened another time and Draco startled, but luckily for him it was Greg and Pansy who sat down with him. Pansy's hair was rising and she looked rather unhappy.
After searching the entire train and finding no familiar faces, he sat down in an empty compartment and closed his eyes. He really was returning to Hogwarts. He wondered if it had been rebuilt yet or was there still signs from the battle in the halls?
He tried very hard but he couldn't stop thinking about what Pansy had just said. It was absurd. It simply couldn't be true. Yes, he thought about Potter often and had grown to like him, but not like that. Or did he? He tried to imagine that he was kissing him. And he was surprised to find that he felt no disgust. A pleasantly warm feeling was building up inside him. That couldn't be true.
Draco decided he needed to speak to Potter again as he walked back to the south tower. He looked for Pansy and Greg, but he couldn't find them. He looked again in the common room, but there was no sign of them anywhere, so he gave up the search. If he couldn't find them now, he might as well go to sleep. Dinner was about to begin, but Draco decided to lie down now. He wasn't hungry and he needed a break from all the brooding.
"When you chop the tubers, you have to be careful not to lose too much juice from the root" he explained without Potter asking.
"It's okay," Potter muttered, but it wasn't okay. He nodded goodbye to him and kept walking. Draco noticed Weasley giving him another angry look and he exhaled in relief. At least Weasley hadn't gone mad.
"Mr. Potter, I expected nothing less from my best student," he said, throwing Draco a beaming smile as well. Draco screwed up his face. He didn't like Slughorn and he hadn't liked him neither before Potter had made him a war hero.
He had slept badly the previous night. He had been thinking about Potter the whole time. He had wanted to use the previous meeting to end his obsession with Potter and now he had made it worse. But he didn't want to avoid Potter either. That would be unfair to him. After all Potter had done for him, he couldn't go back to acting like his old self. Besides, Draco didn't have enough friends either to give one up just because he thought about him a little too often. At least he thought they were friends now. They had never worked it out exactly.
"Can you read from the book?" asked Potter, lying down on the sofa with his head resting against Draco's leg. The sudden closeness confused him and he cleared his throat a few times as he read from the book. Potter didn't seem to mind and closed his eyes as he listened to him. His quiet breathing told Draco that he had fallen asleep. Draco closed the book again and placed it carefully on the wooden table so he wouldn’t wake him up. What was he supposed to do now? If he got up, Potter would wake up. He looked so peaceful, like he needed the rest, so Draco didn't have the heart to wake him. The war had changed Potter too. He had become quieter. Draco liked the new Potter.
— give him a hug, maybe? — but Draco vigorously shook his head ‘no’ and she rolled her eyes, straightening.
The end of his last term had quickly turned into his last week, and then his last day, and then he was packing up his room. This was
Harry hastily blinked away the tears blurring his vision, not noticing the transformation of the memorial until he’d opened his eyes for the third time. The small obelisk had disappeared, replaced by a statue of a couple, holding a baby. The woman had long hair and a kind face with delicate features, while the man was a spitting image of Harry. That meant the baby…
The corridor finally led to a room blocked off by thick metal bars. He frowned and stepped closer — his instincts told him that this was the right room — and recoiled. A boy was curled up on the floor, dressed in rags that did nothing to protect the deep cuts and lacerations that littered every inch of his body. He had his face tucked into his arms, but it did nothing to cushion his head, as he was all skin and bones. His shoulders, elbows, knees — every bone in his body pressed painfully into the stone floor. Even as he slept, he was shaking. And his
that had killed him. The light wasn’t good enough to be able to see any injuries, but he was sure that he was just running off adrenaline, or something.
“Come on Draco, we need to be fast. I think everyone will be asleep, but that’s no reason to let our guard down.” Severus pressed a flask into Draco’s hands. “A rejuvenation potion. We don’t know how long he’s been in there—”
Draco was surprised when he’d got the letter inviting him back to Hogwarts, and had spent several days deliberating whether or not to go back. He’d flooed Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Milly, Tracy, Daphne and Theo - he would be the only Slytherin eighth year. Hopefully this would mean he’d get a room to himself this year. If he didn’t, hopefully he’d be rooming with Ravenclaws, or even Hufflepuffs; definitely not Gryffindors. Arrogant bastards.
It was an awkward trip to the classroom - Harry wasn’t quite sure whether to walk beside Malfoy or behind him. He ended up in a mixture of both, on Malfoy’s left and about a pace behind him. He watched how Malfoy walked - gracefully, his arms loose by his side, shoulders squared and head held high. Harry, next to him, looked even shorter, shoulders curled inwards and generally facing the floor.
he remembers me,” Pansy rolled her eyes at Blaise, before turning to Draco. “Maybe you should ask Potter.”
The pear giggled before allowing him entrance, and a soft smile broke out over Harry’s face as he saw Kreacher, happily bustling about with Regulus’ locket and Winky in tow. Winky also looked a lot happier.
“Better, Harry?” Draco asked gently, and Harry sat up, surprised. Draco’s hand stopped moving, in fear — maybe he shouldn’t have talked? Harry needed to heal, and being paranoid about Draco’s weirdness wasn’t going to help—
There were some other places to fill, he was sure. Muggle Studies, since he’d killed that muggle–loving bitch, Burbage. And Defence, since Severus…
A bottle shot out of Draco’s trunk, and Harry hurriedly conjured a bowl and ran back into the bathroom, tipping the contents of both bottles into the bowl before grabbing Draco’s arm and shoving it into the bowl. In order to get his arm fully submerged, Harry had to get Draco lying sideways on his lap, which took a bit of maneuvering. As Harry watched, the wound on Draco’s arm started to close up, and Harry removed the stasis charm. Eventually, Draco’s breathing evened out, and Harry’s evened out with it. Harry grabbed the wand off the sink - it was Draco’s, the one Harry had returned in the summer - and it sparked and heated in Harry’s hand as if recognising an old friend. Harry vanished the contents of the toilet, and the sink, before
Draco, deciding that he’d heard enough, shifted his legs, trying his best not to rouse Potter while making them know he was ‘waking up’.
The four of them sat down at their usual places at the Gryffindor table. Luna, Seamus, Dean and Neville were already there, and all but Luna were very confused when Harry and Draco were exchanging chaste kisses every two minutes.
The Weasleys had broken off into two groups to cover the grounds quicker; Fred, George, and Percy had gone one way, and Bill, Ron, and Ginny had gone the other. The scent of blood was strong, even though the ground was bare, with only the occasional snowdrop peeking through the damp dirt.
Harry snuck a glance at Draco, who had been silent throughout the conversation. His face was paler than usual, and completely devoid of any emotion; it broke Harry’s heart. But he’d meant what he’d said last night — this was bigger than both of them. He couldn’t let his feelings get in the way when they were this close.
Ropes, not unlike the ones Voldemort had used, wrapped around Harry’s hands and ankles. Bellatrix left the ball of light hovering in mid–air, illuminating the harsh angles of her face — she hadn’t quite recovered from her stint in Azkaban.
“Yes, but — wait, what?” Hermione turned as Ron strode past her, almost out of the door before he replied.
Draco crossed the room in a few long strides, trapping Harry between him and the wall. He brought a hand up, holding it a couple of centimetres away from Harry’s face. “I still can’t believe it’s really you.”
Fleur huffed and stalked back to Shell Cottage, her silvery glow fading slightly as she got to the gates. Ginny stared after her slack jawed, and Remus snapped his fingers in front of her nose.
He drew the curtains around his bed, casting five different silencing charms that would hold overnight, and curled in on himself, and dropped the barrier holding his emotions back, crying for what seemed like an age before he went to sleep.
Breakfast was waffles, so Draco grabbed a couple for Harry before going back upstairs. The Gryffindors eyed him up suspiciously as he left the room in a hurry - maybe they thought Draco had killed Harry? Kidnapped Harry? Locked him in a sex dungeon? Who knew how Gryffindor’s minds worked.
Once he heard Potter’s breathing even out, Draco crept down the stairs. Honestly, how could he have forgotten when Potter’s birthday was? Granted, he hadn’t been planning on getting Potter anything, being part of the death eaters and all, but the least he could do, after Har—
That shimmering, iridescent white thread that had led to Draco had disappeared, and there was a tiny, black spot on Harry’s magic.
“We do not mean to cause any arguments. We only found out about Potter earlier today and had to get him out.” Snape’s words were carefully chosen, and clearly directed at Hermione.
towards Potter. He looked forward to when he woke up, finding that Potter’s humour was surprisingly Slytherin, and had found himself referring to Potter as
“Kreacher, you’ve been very helpful,” Hermione said gently. “When you feel up to it, please sit up so I can ask you one more thing.”
— to go to a healer and sort out all of his bones. He’d done well with them so far, but he had enough basic knowledge to know that over time, they could cause significant damage, especially around his joints.
So Harry gets woken up by Vernon Dursley, pretty much a similar drill to the start of the Philisopher’s Stone (Harry is forced to make them breakfast). Because he’s so small, he burns his hand and wrists on the hob, and despite rushing around and trying to make everything perfect it burns anyway. The scene ends with him being whipped by Vernon, being spat on and called a freak. During this, he thinks he sees Draco, but dismisses it as his imagination. The scene is also described from Draco’s POV, who was actually there but viewing it similarly to a pensive memory in that people in the memory couldn’t see him and he couldn’t manipulate the situation in any way.
, which forms a transparent shield around him, before power walking back to the library, since he didn’t have a lesson for another hour and had no intention of running into Potter. He managed not to get hexed, and settled in a window seat in the farthest corner of the library, opened a book and began to read.
Harry still tried to convey his distrust via facial expression, and Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Honestly, Potter, how idiotic can you be? We just
He came to in the forest, kneeling in wet dirt, a layer of frost sparkling under the crescent moon. He didn’t know how long he’d knelt there, but, with a massive effort, drew his wand and incinerated the bodies. Perhaps not the best send off, but better than being left to rot.
If Bill cried himself to sleep that night, no one had to know. He had to stay strong for the good of the family now.
Left to answer their questions, Bill told the Weasleys what Percy had done in the Ministry, and everyone begrudgingly decided to welcome Percy back into the family with open arms. They had lost too many already.
Malfoy shot a glare at her, before taking a couple of steps towards Harry. Harry tried not to react at the wave of warmth and comfort that came with the proximity of Malfoy’s magic, but was quite sure he let out a little sigh anyway. Malfoy raised an eyebrow in amusement, before pointing his wand directly at Harry’s chest. He heard Ron and Hermione gasp slightly, but surprisingly, he didn’t feel any fear.
— sending letters every other day about how there were no students, everyone was hidden, and the rest of it. And of course, he couldn’t entrust Hogwarts to any of his other followers; they’d probably leave him too.
“That’s why I get you to do it,” Harry muttered under his breath, turning to the Professor at the front of the room.
“I’d have to agree - I’ve never been much of a social butterfly, never mind what my father tried to forge me into.”
Harry nodded sadly, as she gently patted his knee and went back to the pile of parchment. “So Draco, you’ll have to learn some healing charms as well. Just the basics —
“Granger, Weasel-ly,” Draco sweated under the weight of their stares. He’d already called the Weasel Weaselly. He’d have to start calling him Weasley in his head, otherwise this would turn nasty very quickly. “I want to apologise for being a horrid prat these last seven years, calling both of you various horrible names, hexing both of you, and generally being a pureblooded ponce.”
“What about — what about the Burrow?” Ron looked nervous under everyone’s gaze, before steeling himself and continuing. “There are plenty of bedrooms, and if we remove everything of value — sentimental value — and store it here, or in Grimmauld, we can set up wards around the Burrow and have it as the main house.”
Low murmuring — Harry was surprised the Malfoy hadn’t said anything yet. He’d likely been ordered not to.
“What’s happening?” Hermione watched anxiously nearby, clearly stressed because she didn’t really know what to do.
“People don’t get through life by ‘winging it’,” Draco pointed out. Harry might have laughed at his posh interpretation of air–quotes had the discussion not been so serious.
But no one was there, and all Harry got for his efforts was a hand across the face, and he lay there on the pavement, defeated, bleeding, and alone.
Harry ran a finger along the cut along his cheek. Previously, cuts deeper than this would have healed in three days, but it had been a week since it reopened, and it was barely scabbed over. Apparently, his magic had been speeding up the healing, a benefit he wasn’t receiving now.
, regardless of Potter senior’s accusations. It was taking all of his self control not to just take Draco and
He sighed. Recently, the time at which he woke up was quite close to when Lucius came to bring him his potions and food, but he’d been awake for a while, and still hadn’t heard those footsteps.
This chapter contains graphic descriptions of self-harm. From Draco’s point of view, it starts at “Shaking, he looked at his arm” and finishes at “Thank Merlin Harry was still alive.” From Harry’s point of view, it starts at “He panicked again when he saw the empty bed, the open trunk” through to the end. All of these phrases are in bold, and there will be a brief description in the notes at the end of what happened.
Ginny screamed, advancing on the snake and casting spell after spell. Chunks of wood flew around as some of her spells went wide, but she managed to distract the snake long enough for Ron to grab Bill and get him out of the shed.
Leaving them in the wall, she produced two more knives, stepping closer to Harry. He didn’t flinch, staring deep into those unnervingly emotionless eyes.
Later that day, Hermione and Dean went out into London, coming back with an uncannily accurate, black wig. Kreacher brought down a set of Bellatrix’s clothes — her taste hadn’t changed much, thankfully — and with a bit of altering, Narcissa was dressed up, with her own face, but everything else resembling Bellatrix. Harry took one look at her, and his face immediately drained of colour. Draco found him throwing up in an upstairs toilet.
He walked along the path, the damp leaves barely making a sound as he stepped on them. Good. Today wasn’t a day for noise.
He tore his eyes away from the sleeping figure and went over to his bag, removing the books and setting them up in neat piles in the corner, cringing as they settled on the dusty floor. There wasn’t anywhere else for them to go, but he still hated mistreating them. He’d have to clean them when he left.
“Yep, that’s the bond. Now try sending something down it.” Draco was impressed by how quickly Harry had found the bond - especially given how terrible he’d said he was at occluding. Then again, looking into your mind and actively defending it were two different things.
Hermione was on the floor, sobbing, Bellatrix having already carved the ugly word into her arm and was starting on her other arm. There was so much blood, seeping out onto the floor, into Bellatrix’s robes, at Malfoy’s feet.
“Harry — Harry, what’s wrong?” Draco murmured softly, rubbing small circles into Harry’s back. Harry retched again, before sitting back, violently shivering.
At lessons that Monday, Harry had been surprised to not be approached by anyone, other than a couple of knowing smiles as they looked at him and Draco. Harry hadn’t been to breakfast, instead having a panic attack and then some bread Draco brought up. Really, his diet had been reduced exclusively to carbohydrates, which perhaps wasn’t ideal, but he
The emotion reminded him of the darkness radiating out of the void he’d witnessed in the charms lesson. He drew back into his mind. The rope was still there, straining even more, and the void had...grown. Like it had been contained before, but was now unleashed. Waves of darkness pulsed out, and in time to those Draco felt the emotion hitting him.
The Dark Lord sneered at Draco, who was lying face down on the floor, breathing shakily in and out. “You’re dismissed.” He turned to Severus. “Go with him. Tell him what he’s to do. I need more healing potions.”
harm, running around with his friends. He knew about the horcruxes, sure, but Dumbledore was a secretive wizard — Potter had no idea about the location of the horcruxes, and only a vague idea of what they were. And he wasn’t
However, she’d been quite shocked when Draco had come strutting across the common room in her general direction. He’d tried his best to come across as calm, but he had nervous ticks everywhere.
Voldemort checked through the rest of the book for other options for the potion — there were none — before rereading the section. He wasn’t about to fire a killing curse at the boy, so there were no issues.
“I’ll be fine, just need a bit of salve and dittany.” Draco made to reach for the bottles in Harry’s hand, but Harry caught Draco’s wrist in his other hand.
Remus downed the potion, relaxing slightly as it took effect. “So what’s been happening? Moody doesn’t tell me shit.”
“Really. We saw Madame Umbridge apprehend someone trying to break into her office not five minutes ago.”
Draco fidgeted all the way through breakfast. He’d gone down relatively early, so there was barely anyone at the tables. He didn’t eat much - a slice of toast and a cup of tea. He’d checked Harry’s mind repeatedly - the shadows were higher, held by an invisible barrier. The usual hedges were nowhere to be seen, but the darkness was clearly contained. Draco tried, once, to go and see what was happening, but he simply pinged off the barrier. He tried talking to Harry, and just got an echo of what he’d said - as if the words had reflected off the barrier as well.
He put a few charms and wards up, to keep Draco out. He didn’t want to have any conversations with him about what happened with the Dursley’s - he wouldn’t understand, he’d just pity Harry, who just couldn’t deal with the pained facial expressions, the softly spoken words and sad eyes.
That night, Ginny received a message from Hermione that new intake and transfers at Beauxbatons were at an all time high. Ginny, in turn, had told Hermione about the gaps at the tables, the meagre handful of first years, and their plans to have the Room of Requirement as their main place of operations. Ginny had noted that, walking up to the Gryffindor dorms, new passages had appeared, betrayed only by how tapestries rippled slightly, and she was willing to bet that they all led to the Room. She’d never heard of the Room reaching out before anyone had even asked, but perhaps the Castle was more intuitive than anyone had thought.
“Whatever you want, just that it has to be non-verbal. I know you started non-verbal casting in sixth year defence, but non-verbal charms are generally considered to be harder because they are often object manipulation, rather than general casting. Now go ahead, and try not to kill anyone!” A look at Finnigan, who despite his knack at blowing up various objects with basic charms, had continued to NEWT level.
“Don’t worry, I’m sure you’re a great roommate.” Ron really hoped he wasn’t blushing, but was pretty sure he was as Hermione’s gaze flicked to his ears and she smiled softly.
After Harry had rubbed salve dangerously close to Draco’s arse, he asked “Are there any more?” In a low, gravelly voice.
He felt a twang in his chest at the memory of ‘not’. He pushed the sadness and guilt of Sirius’ death deep down, into the cocoon of emotions he kept tucked around his heart, and started skimming one of the books. It was quite informative, and Harry reached down to pull out some parchment to make some notes, before noticing that some Ravenclaws were exiting the library.
After I’ve posted the next fic, called The Egregious Engagement, I’ll be inactive on here for a while. I have plans for a seventh year fic *cackles evilly* which I am unbelievably excited to write, and I’ll start posting once it’s reached around 25K. I don’t know how long that’s going to take to write, probably at least two weeks, but I’m reasonably active on my instagram and tumblr so if you want to follow me, harass me, or make friends, you can find me there :)
Draco became increasingly unnerved, however, as the same people walked over to the Slytherin table, despite none of them being Slytherins. They walked straight over to him, and the leader - a short, stocky Ravenclaw - said “we just wanted to congratulate you two on finally getting your heads out of your arses.”
Severus jumped — internally, of course — as a high pitched squeal and a thump sounded from the corridor.
as he drained the last of his tea. Quarter to five. He dragged himself back upstairs, and put his trunk in the middle of his room, open and empty. He levitated the books that he’d owl-ordered into the bottom, before piling clothes on top - school robes, old, baggy t-shirts of Dudleys that he used as pyjamas and underwear, mostly. He also packed his going-out jeans and joggers for the common room. Then he put in the snitch Dumbledore left him, the Marauder’s Map, his dad’s old cloak and other various personal items. Then stuff required for school - potions ingredients, spare quills, ink and parchment. After he’d finished packing, nothing of his own remained in his room, except his Firebolt in the corner. He stared at it for a couple of minutes, but felt none of the emotions he’d felt before seventh year - the freedom a broom provided him with, the happiness he’d associated with being up in the air. Nothing. He shrunk it and tucked it into his trunk anyway - he didn’t want to be on the quidditch team, and didn’t think they’d be allowed anyway, but it was an escape plan at the very least. The thought made him feel a bit better.
“Yes.” She crossed her arms, and they had a short staring competition, which Harry knew he wouldn’t win, and only participated in to make his displeasure clear.
He opened the first book, sitting on the dusty, velvet stool at the end of the bed. That should be close enough to Harry.
Draco suddenly realised he was awake, but he didn’t move a muscle as he tried to figure out where he was. A dull pain was radiating from his left arm, so he didn’t attempt to move it. His bed was hard, and cold, and the painful arm was...wet? It was hanging off the bed inside a bowl of something. His pillow was oddly warm, and lumpy.
He took a deep breath, trying to remember what Death had taught him, in the final moments before he’d come back.
Voldemort scoffed. “Dumbledore really taught you nothing, did he? Dark magic is inherently more powerful than light, because you have to
to have a jumper in your bag.” Draco pulled the jumper over his head, the muscles in his back shifting, his grumbling muffled by the soft material.
“Yes, dear. The magic of the room cannot be interfered with at all, meaning even making the painting move like a wizarding painting would have rendered it useless. It stands out like a sore thumb, but I guess no one’s discovered it until now.” Narcissa moved her wand in an intricate pattern, and the wall rippled, as if it was made of satin. Then, she simply
