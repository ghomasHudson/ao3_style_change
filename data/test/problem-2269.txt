Well, maybe it could be more accurately described as a feeling of superiority. Not even the most powerful wizards could read his mind, so now he can go through any task with a straight face. He can buy his food ignoring all the glares, can walk straight to a free table in the middle of the room with Harry by his side, as if it’s something that has happened hundreds of times before, as if it’s a part of their routine.
“I just don’t, for Merlin’s sake!”
“Anyway, how are you, Draco?” Granger asks him. “It’s been a long time since we talked.”
“So… yelling
“You know what I struggle with? I don’t know whether I deserved it or not.”
“And I was exactly like him.”
Well, he sees some bits. He sees scars on Draco’s neck and jaw, and that’s more than enough. He tries not to look, though—Draco notices that. Harry glances and stares at his eyes, lips, cheekbones whenever they spend time together, but rarely below.
Draco needs a few more days to put his messy thoughts into some kind of order. Eventually, he decides it would be better to talk with Harry than to write him a letter.
Draco can’t believe that he’s almost forgotten Harry’s there, even though he’s clinging to him, even though he can feel the warmth of his body through his clothes and skin.
Draco tries to distance himself from the sting these words cause him. “You went to the Chamber of Secrets one year later to save Ginny Weasley, even though you knew it was guarded by a basilisk.”
Harry instantly looks regretful. “I’m sorry.”
Some people would say that he’s faking it, or that him acting this way is unfair, but Draco has his reasons. There are things he has to deal with it, and he’ll deal with them, in his own time.
“I owled you. Twice! And I was at your door yesterday, and you didn’t answer.”
“Did you need to act quickly?”
He also can’t stand looking at Harry’s chest because it reminds him that his own chest is covered. He doesn’t know why it matters today, as it has been a long time since it used to matter, but he doesn’t want to think about it now. All he wants is to get off.
“Yes, and he kept Madame Pomfrey under Imperius for the whole time I was there.”
Harry tells him that everything takes time.
Draco covers his ears up. “Don’t say that.”
Draco shakes his head. “My arm—”
He still can’t think about his father without feeling deep sadness or anger. He still doesn’t know how to talk with his mother. Maybe he doesn’t know how to talk with anyone. Clearly, talking with Harry hasn’t been going great lately.
“Look at me,” Draco finally confronts him.
He thinks about how he wants to shed his skin and be pure.
“I knew that one day you’d take offence with my limits. That it would all become not worth the trouble. That respecting my unusual wishes would become too hard, and then you’d simply give up,” Draco says, as if he’s had this whole speech ready to go for a long time.
“Then
When he reaches his bedroom, he’s still cautious but less paranoid. Quietly, he opens the door and sees that the room is empty.
Harry wanted them to go somewhere for the weekend—away from their flats, away from the familiar surroundings—so now they’re in a small town on the Yorkshire Coast, taking endless walks on the beaches.
By now, Harry knows exactly what he can and can’t do. He can’t touch Draco’s forearms, can’t grab him by his wrists. He can’t reach under the shirt to touch his skin. Harry has never questioned it—after all, he knows what Draco is hiding, even if he’s never fully seen it.
He hears a rustle of a chair being pushed back, footsteps, and soon Molly Weasley is right by his side, cautiously pulling him into a half-embrace.
Draco leans in and asks Harry in a whisper if he could leave them for a moment. It isn’t exactly the best manners, but he figures neither the Weasleys nor Harry would particularly care. Asking Harry to give them a moment alone is certainly better than dragging the Weasleys somewhere. It’s the best chance he has.
“Do you think it’s likely to be nerve damage?”
“I wanted to stay here.” Harry reaches out to grab Draco’s hand. “How are you?”
about him. Would Harry be upset? Is it one of his expectations—to know everything, to have the full picture of who Draco is? Is it even realistic to have such expectations? It’s not like Draco’s hiding any dark secrets anyway—he just doesn’t share the full extent of the sadness he feels. His life is full of white lies—that he’s happy, that he’s satisfied, that he’s stoical and strong, and that he doesn’t struggle. Draco pauses to consider whether these lies can even be called white.
Draco doesn’t even hesitate. “No.”
“I cared about the detention Snape gave me. I thought it was unfair.” Harry laughs bitterly, and Draco is scared of this laughter. “Do you understand it? I almost killed you through my own stupidity, and the only thing I cared about was the fact that those detentions collided with the Quidditch matches.”
Maybe, under closer inspection, he has less control over his life than he thinks he does. He still has to go to regular appointments to prove that he doesn’t slip back to his old habits and beliefs and to ensure that he has the tools to cope with the challenges that come with living as a resocialised individual. Those appointments have turned out to be a great source of support for him, but they were never his choice.
“How’s your arm? Did it stop hurting?”
The next day, Harry knocks on his door.
“I know, Draco. I know. Don’t worry.”
“Not worth the risk.”
Molly only hugs him tighter. His body burns in the places she touches him, and he’ll let it burn.
“Why?”
After breakfast, Draco goes for a walk. He doesn’t do it often, but he feels like he needs it today. He needs to clear his head.
Draco feels something pleasant but scary spreading inside his chest. “Am I?”
“Does your job make you feel more stressed than usual? Maybe it’s more physically or intellectually demanding?”
“And I know that you regret the things you did,” Harry assures him.
“I won’t look at it.” He points at the square of paper Harry’s holding in his hand.
Then, Draco had to explain to him that going out to buy food was
Harry doesn’t answer. Doesn’t move.
“I’m perfectly well, thank you. And how are you?”
To make the matters worse, he catches Arthur glancing at his neck—he quickly looks away when Draco notices.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. They stare at each other for a moment, until Weasley cringes and turns around with the intention to leave.
“It doesn’t change the fact that you did it.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, this time much softer. “I know it’s hard.”
“It is. You think you’re evil.  You think you’re a horrible person because you’ve made mistakes. You can talk to me about that. You don’t have to deal with it just on your own.”
Draco finds himself unable to protest. Somehow, his brain twists Harry’s words. He hears—
“Hello,” Draco says and then takes Harry’s glasses from the coffee table and gently puts them onto his nose.
He would look so
“Why would I think that looking at you is disgusting?” Harry asks angrily.
“It’s not that simple. It’s not equal. It will never be equal.”
He sits down at the table and waits for Harry to finish up frying. Plates and cutlery are already set, and they are all in the wrong order, but Draco won’t say it. He isn’t allowed to say it because it isn’t good manners. He’s only allowed to smirk knowingly at other guests when the host isn’t looking, but there are no other guests here. He closes his eyes.
“You don’t believe me,” Harry says before Draco has a chance to come to any conclusion.
Draco laughs. “Calves? Why calves?”
He thinks back to the dream he had not long ago–the flames, the impossible heat, the inability to talk. Black puffs of smoke coming from his mouth. He feels like if he doesn’t calm down, he’ll start suffocating. It feels like the smoke is already inside his lungs.
Harry doesn’t argue with her—he just gets up and grabs it. He places the camera on the coffee table, adjusts it, announces that they have ten seconds and gets back onto the couch, next to Draco. He doesn’t touch him, but he looks at him for the first time since he brought him the tea, with the same careful, hesitant look.
Draco laughs bitterly. “Please, don’t call me good.”
They don’t talk about it immediately. Harry suggests they eat something, and Draco agrees.
“Sorry!” Harry quickly apologizes and retreats his arm. “Sorry, that was stupid.”
“Yes, you are!”
It turns out to be surprisingly hard to find other words to express himself. “I worry you might think I’m lying or simply imagining things.”
Then, he goes to the bathroom to change, just like he always does.
“Interesting,” she mutters.
“What are you talking about?”
“Have you been working more lately? Staying after hours?”
Draco almost tells him the whole truth, here and now, impulsively. It boils under his skin, aching to get out. “I can’t—” he chokes out.
“I might have asked Harry what you like.” She smiles again.
Draco can’t bring himself to look into Harry’s eyes, but he holds onto his hand as if it’s a lifeline.
Now his mind is filled with vivid images—the Ministry officials yanking up his sleeve. People in the Ministry halls shooting him angry looks on the daily. The first time Draco looked at the fresh scars on his face, in the Hogwarts’ hospital wing, trying to not cry.
“Uhm, Hermione, I’m sorry, but maybe you could—” Harry starts.
He grabs the photograph by its corners and rips it in half. He doesn’t look at Harry—in fact, he isn’t sure if he would be able to look at him right now as his vision becomes tunneled, and all he can see are the pieces of laminated paper in his hands.
“I can imagine. It’s okay.” Harry pauses. “I just… Look, I don’t think I’m very good at talking, but you can talk with me. About anything. Really, anything. Don’t think I’ll leave you alone with it.”
Draco takes the amber from Harry and holds it up. Now he can make out the shape of a tiny creature trapped inside the fossil. It’s sad, he thinks, to have your corpse accidentally preserved and exposed to anyone who finds it for hundreds or maybe even thousands of years.
“Is something wrong?” Harry asks, rubbing the skin above his right eye and looking at Draco suspiciously.
When Draco crawls out of the fireplace in his living room, he gets startled by the sight of Harry sitting on the couch.
He reaches out with the intent to grab the book and carry it to the section it belongs to, but when his fingers are mere inches from the hardback, he stops.
“Hello. Can I come in?”
Draco looks at the row of bookshelves behind Angelique, at neatly arranged shelves of books and binders. “I’m anxious.”
Harry looks confused. “What do you mean?”
“Harry,” she starts, “Draco says he’s still plenty annoying, do you confirm that?”
Draco hears some commotion, and when he opens his eyes, he sees Harry getting off the bed. He stands up, turns around and looks at Draco with what Draco assumes is strenuously mustered neutrality.
“No. But it could start at any moment.”
“Almost nine.”
“I’m sorry,” he utters before he even says hello.
Harry nods and doesn’t press the subject.
“Draco,” Harry repeats softly.
Draco doesn’t know what to say. He thinks about Harry, on a broom, in the burning Room of Requirements. He remembers Harry trying to pull him onto that broom, remembers his own sweaty hands sliding out of his grip. He remembers clinging to Harry’s middle so tightly, so desperately. The memory alone is almost enough to make him suffocate again.
“I don’t know.”
It only gets worse from there. Draco can’t keep looking at Harry. He leans in for kisses with his eyes closed which results in them bumping their noses or him hitting Harry’s glasses—generally him not being able to find Harry’s mouth at all.
“If you have nothing work-related to communicate to me, get out.” Draco is almost scared of the coldness of his voice, of the ruthlessness he possesses.
Only a few seconds pass, and his left forearm starts to burn. He bends forward, trying to not cry out from pain. His heartbeat immediately goes up because he’s panicking. He knows that he has to be calm, that he can’t let his fear run free, but he has no idea how to achieve that.
Draco’s hands are quick and steady, and he’s at the fourth button when Harry speaks again.
“It isn’t.”
“I would do the same for you now.”
He’s crouched in front of the couch, watching a slight frown on Harry’s face. He wonders if it’s because of yesterday, if it’s because of him.
It’s in the evening when the feeling of inadequacy comes back, or maybe it never really leaves.
“I’m sure that if anyone else experiences that, we will know by tomorrow.”
“Why would I not be? And, honestly, I’m not going to talk with you
“I didn’t think you would do it.” When Draco looks up, he sees that Harry’s eyes are shining with excitement.
Later in the evening, when their bodies are pressed to each other on the narrow couch in Harry’s living room, Harry asks, “Wait—how do you shave? Or style your hair? It always looks so good.”
“Yeah. Just… fetch me some shirt with long sleeves.”
“Why are you telling me that?” Draco blurts out before he can stop himself. “I mean, you and Harry work together, and me and Harry—”
Draco shakes his head ever so slightly. “I don’t deserve that.”
“You don’t leave this bloody place,” Harry says quietly. His voice doesn’t carry the spite that Draco almost misses now.
“You know that’s not what I meant.”
, to get up and run, to flee.
Eventually, he opts for simply sucking Harry off, but even then weird thoughts clog up his mind.
“Very,” Harry adds.
“After I cursed you with Sectumsempra,” Harry interrupts him in a harsh tone, “and after you were taken to the hospital wing, I didn’t care about you or what I did. At all.”
Draco glances at his forearm again. It still looks exactly the same.
Angelique’s office is distinctly cosy. Everything is in blues and beiges, the curtains are light and move with the slightest windblow, and the armchair Draco’s sitting on is plush, soft to the touch. It’s the exact kind of decor his parents would turn their noses at. It’s not that Draco particularly cares about what they think—it’s just a habit to take their opinions into consideration, for the smallest of moments before Draco remembers that it all doesn’t matter. Maybe he’s a sponge that has soaked in all of his parents’ thoughts and now needs to slowly release them. Maybe one day he’ll get rid of them all.
“You know what the worst thing about these scars is?” Draco asks, ignoring Harry. “They’re so raised. I hate touching them because of their texture. The way they feel under my fingers actually makes me nauseous. It’s so disgusting.” He traces a finger along one of the scars that runs across his chest trying hard to not shudder.
Draco shrugs. He doesn’t really care about anything at the moment.
But instead of asking any of these questions, Draco’s thoughts circle back to his own pretty dysfunctional family, even though he hates thinking about it. Growing up, he didn’t have a full picture of the world around him. He knew things his parents wanted him to know, and many of the things they shared were incredibly biased.
There was the time when, at the start of one of his first interrogations, three Ministry officials came into the white-walled room, one of them holding a camera. Perhaps it’s the thing Draco remembers most vividly from his prison time—them yanking his sleeve up and taking pictures of his Dark Mark, pressing their hands to it. They asked about the scars on his face and neck and didn’t believe him when he said it was Harry Potter’s botched attempt to kill him from the time they were in school. They requested that Draco take off his robe. Then, they were taking pictures of his chest, neck, and face from different angles, commanding him to turn around, to put his arms up so that they could have a better look at his scarred sides. It all felt so incredibly long, almost never-ending.
“Hasn’t been long.”
“You need just the right amount of force to crack the shell and not completely smash it.”
He can’t sleep because he’s terrified that he’ll wake up with the burning in his arm that could only mean one thing—the Dark Lord will command him to do yet another unforgivable thing.
Draco hesitates for only a second. “Good.”
“Why?” Harry sounds impatient.
“Not really fair of me to put you in a situation where you need to face something you might not want to or be ready to face.”
“Was it because I broke your nose at the beginning of the year, on the train?”
He swallows Harry’s come because it’s something that comes from within him, because it is protectively hidden behind his skin and flesh, not tainted by the human gaze, because it is pure.
“Sleepy?” Harry asks. Apparently he’s done cooking, and now he’s hovering over the table, putting the rest of the plates there.
“There’s nothing to apologise for. You didn’t know.” Draco buries his hand in Harry’s thick hair, strokes it back. “I should’ve talked to you about this a long time ago.”
Harry starts to sway him, making them dance in silence. Maybe there is some song playing in his head, as he seems quite committed to the movements.
Every time Harry gives him head, Draco is surprised by how intense it feels. The worst thing is that it’s not like he gets phenomenal satisfaction from engaging in any sex acts—it’s rather that the rest of his life is surprisingly bland. Any time he experiences pleasure, he’s almost shocked that he still has the capacity for it.
Harry waves his hand, looking away. “You don’t have to be sorry. You were right, and we should’ve talked about it way earlier. I needed to... face it, eventually.”
“What?” Weasley turns around once again to look at him.
Draco rolls his eyes. “You know what I mean.”
“What?” Harry asks, audibly confused.
“That’s okay. You don’t have to figure it out alone.”
Draco wonders how slow-thinking a person can be. “Yes, Harry, that includes mirrors and every other surface that can reflect your image.”
He wishes he’d at least still have some pride or maybe just enough courage to not hide himself. Sometimes, he foolishly wishes he could be his younger self, sleeping in his underwear every night, not even a shadow of self-consciousness falling across his mind. He wishes he could roll up the sleeves of his robes in summer, let Harry undress him and suck his hard nipples during cold winter nights, take them to a lake and go skinny-dipping, just do anything to feel carefree again.
“I have some at home. I’ll go grab it. I’ll be right back.”
“You can look at me.”
“Identify your emotions. We’ve worked on this. What are you really feeling?”
It’s completely bright outside. The sunlight illuminates the room, making the worry on Harry’s face seem even more pronounced.
“I love you so much, Draco. I know that everything between us is complicated, but I’ll do anything… anything to help you. If you let me, and if you want me to.”
Draco thinks about it. “It kind of sounds like you’re mocking me.”
“You were just trying to save your friends, right? You would do anything to save them. You would never even hesitate.”
, his father said, yanking his hand away.
“I was clutching at my chest, trying to stop the bleeding, and you did nothing.”
“It’s not that hard after some practice. You need a sharp edge, like the edge of a bowl. If your counter has square edges, you can do it there. I prefer to do it this way.”
Harry looks him in the eyes. “You’re just… so beautiful, okay? I thought it was—”
“Blimey,” he says, scratching his nose. “Uhm, hello, Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry gets up and comes up to him. “Didn’t want to scare you.”
When he brings his gaze back to Harry, he realises that Harry isn’t looking at him—he’s staring at the bedsheets on the other side of the bed. Draco is both relieved and terrified at this sight. He wants to beg for comfort as much as he wants to yell at Harry to go.
“It’s not stupid,” Harry says with conviction. “Draco, come on, it’s serious.”
When Harry reaches for the egg, the thin lines of scar tissue shine on the back of his right hand, and it’s all Draco can focus on. It feels wrong to be looking at it—nevertheless, Draco can’t bring himself to look away.
“All right.”
, because he needed to keep his guard up the entire time in order to predict possible attacks. Harry looked so dumbfounded—Draco will never forget that expression.
Draco nods hesitantly.
“Did it start before we got together?”
“You’re not a Death Eater. You only became one because—”
He had to recall every crime he committed or witnessed and then describe it in detail. He had to talk about the involvement of his parents in those crimes. He had to re-imagine every detail of the Battle of Hogwarts, his every meeting with the Dark Lord, the day he almost killed Dumbledore.
The bed is all he needs right now—soft enough to soothe the pain in his legs that came from a few minutes of kneeling, with the bedspread perfect to soak in his tears.
She looks at him patiently, and after a moment of getting no further reaction, asks, “How are you feeling?”
And just like that, he’s back there again—in his own house, lying on the ground, his muscles spasming with a lingering shadow of pain. He’s listening to his mother’s screams, to those horrible sounds of suffering, wondering who’s going to be the next victim. His heart is beating fast as he’s anticipating the moment the curse hits him once more, and he can’t stop thinking that it’s all his fault, that it all could have been so easily prevented.
“No, I’m not, hit me” Harry smiled at him and Draco punched Harry’s chest gently. As soon as he did it, Draco began laughing when Harry acted melodramatically like he was punched hard, he stepped back a few steps and leaned on the wall, his hand clutching on the spot Draco just punched, his face twisted with fake pain.
think?” Draco chortled, letting his shirt fell on the carpet and reached for his trousers, Harry found it harder to breath, his hands were glued on the bed, he didn’t dare touch Draco without  permission first
“Uncle Draco likes you” Rose argued, which Harry chuckled at, there was no way Draco would ever think of Harry as more than a friend, or else Harry would have known “I’m going to fix it”

“I want to, Draco’d want me to” He said and watched Potter rustling inside his robes to pull out a box

the room” Hermione nudged her by the elbow and laughed “Sorry guys, all the nearby suites are for couples so there’s only one bed, and you two have to be close to us” She shrugged and pulled a piece of parchment in front of them “Here’s our plan for today and the next few days, we will go on adventure, hiking in the forest, swimming under waterfalls, kayaking, spa, cooking class, drinking by the beach, watch the sunset, stuff like that”
“Did you just—…”
“Well, for what it’s worth, I’m sorry” Harry said and extended his hand “Wanna be friends, again?” Draco looked at Potter for a minute before putting his cocktail glass in the Auror’s hand “Grab me another drink, Potter”
“Girlfriends? What about Weasley? Didn’t he date Granger?”
“Better than the first day” Blaise said “They weren’t as stiff, so I’d say it’s good”
, I thought Luna was wrong, but now, I’m not so sure, maybe both of you blondies have a point”
“Why are we even leaving?” Lucius asked but Narcissa only smiled at him when they were back at the Manor “Narcissa, Cissy, tell me”
“Yes, you did everything, Pansy, it’s all because of y—what is this?” Hermione stopped and pointed to a spot on the carpet “Don’t tell me…”
“Oh, oh thank you” Draco exclaimed and pulled Harry in a hug “Oh
“Alright, what’s wrong with your hand?”
talking” Ron looked down, hiding a smile at Blaise’s words “I can stop interacting with them, I can even act like they’re strangers. I won’t look at other guys when I’m with or without you. I have stopped doing it with other guys from the moment I knew I like you, I swear, ask Draco, or Pansy” Blaise tilted Ron’s chin up by his finger and smiled “I will do
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, what you’re saying is…you
“Excuse me?”
?” Draco uttered shyly, his breath hitched when Harry licked his earlobe and pushed the fingers in as deep as he could, arching it up and making Draco moaned. Harry pulled the fingers out and sat back on the bed, removing the last piece of clothing on him, his cock sprung up heavily, he couldn’t even believe he’d last that long.
“A scratch?” Draco asked, narrowing his eyes and looking down at Potter’s arm again “What scratched you exactly?”
“You’re still Draco, right?” Potter said, waiting for Draco to slowly nod “I want to give you this, because you’re still Draco, and I love you”
“I am
be in such a close quarter with Neville like this “I won’t tell them”
“I can’t believe we are graduates now, we are practically adults” Pansy said as they emerged from The Great Hall. The ceremony had started since morning and ended before noon so the students could prepare to go home. All Professors including the Headmistress have made speeches. Even some students, like Granger and Weasley have each made one, and Harry one as well. Draco knew about it of course, since he was the one to help Harry come up with what to say and they had spent the night before together for him to rehearse it “Have you heard Granger’s speech? It was inspiring, wasn’t it?”
“Wait, here?”
“You’re
“Fair point”
“What she
“I’m sorry you had to go through that” Harry told him, it made Draco look up at the detective and realised his eyes were green, it was so alluring, Draco couldn’t stop staring
“Oh, you don’t know?” Pansy chuckled and smacked his shoulder “Guess a lot of things changed in a world where you and Harry aren’t together. In this world, anything Harry knows, you know, well, Draco knows, still you, same, but also different? Wow, I’m getting myself confused”
“Er, hi everyone”
“I have one” She smiled at all of them, suddenly putting a parchment on the table “It’s called Guess What I’ll go around with my eyes closed and give each person a pet name”
” Harry jolted and the ring fell from his hand down to the floor, he bent down to pick it up and looked up at Draco only to realise he was on one knee again
“Yeah?” Granger looked up from her books and smiled at Pansy “What’s wrong?”
“I think it’s the best friend” Auror Boot cut in and Draco glanced at them before glaring at the pair of Aurors who were still whispering the whole time again
“It is”
“Hey” Pansy tapped him from behind and Draco gaped, watching Pansy and Hermione sitting down next to Neville “Why don’t you sit down?”
Draco tried to divert his eyes and focused on his face instead “What are you doing here? Did I forget to give you the file for that murder case?”
He cursed and grabbed the towel nearby to put on the puddle of apple juice, he looked down and swallowed hard when Harry stood up and walked to the kitchen to stand in front of him
“Thank you, Headmistress, I’m so sorry.
“If it’s the Mirror of Desire, it tells us what we wants most, that’s what Sirius told me. So, it must have been that…you have feelings for me, or the other me in the world you were in. That’s why you saw us kissing”
“You’re even better” Harry chuckled, if he knew Draco, the blond would hold on to this story forever “In fact, you’re the best, no one can beat you even if they tried”
Pansy chuckled and leaned back on the couch, smiling “It’s been a while since I heard you call Harry by his last name, I think a few years ago you guys got in a huge row and didn’t talk to each other for a week, that’s when you called him Potter. And yeah, he’s your boyfriend, he’s your best friend since you two were kids, now you’re boyfriends”
“Potter’s my boyfriend?”
!” McLaggen exclaimed when he saw the scene
” Ron kicked Harry’s legs and they finally pulled apart “Wasn’t the performance in the bedroom enough for you two?”
be true” Potter said softly next to him, Draco took a deep breath to calm himself, because he just found out his former rival has feelings for him, so much that his friends complain about it. What was Draco going to do with this information? What would he do with Potter? What would…
“I am” Neville said, moving closer to intertwine Theo’s hand with his “And Hannah kissed me, I pushed her off as soon as she did it, you just didn’t see it, I-I don’t want her at all, I want you. And I know that, because it hurts me every time a guy was near you, because it hurts me when I saw you hurt yourself” He put his other hand on Theo’s bandaged hand and continued “I know, because when Hannah kissed me, I wanted it to be you, I want to kiss you. When Roger was on you, I-I feel furious, and when you told me to go, I-…I feel the pain, in here” He said, putting Theo’s hand on his heart, he could feel it beating, fast “I really do love you”
“I think he likes me” Theo shrugged his shoulders, leaning back on the table, his eyes scanning around the room and stopped at Roger Davies’s spot. He can tell there were still hesitant in Theo’s eyes, he still hasn’t gotten over Neville yet, maybe that was good…
meddle, they will
” The boy gave Blaise a wink and Ron tried his best to hide his anger. He didn’t turn back to look at Blaise, he just sat there. He knew it, Blaise was just always the same, he would always be the manslut Ron knew he was
“Even the spot that Ginny spilled her drink on” Draco pointed at one of the chairs and Harry chuckled. It looked exactly like that day, and he couldn’t believe it’s been twenty two years that they’ve been together, Draco became a Healer, occasionally seeing Harry every few weeks at St. Mungo’s though with an injury on him, and Draco’d end up scolding him for it. With their three kids, a pair of twins, James and Scorpius, Draco was overwhelmed with happiness every day “I still can’t believe I almost kissed you that day”
” He emphasised on his last name “
“No one can tell him to stop” Ron complained “And next time you bring a guest home, put up the Silencing charm, please”
“Okay now you’re just saying bollocks” Pansy slammed her drink on the table and pulled him by his shirt close “I know deep down in your so-called cold, dead heart, you want a boyfriend, you keep saying you don’t want or don’t need them but actually you do. You want someone you can come home to, someone to care about you and for you to care about them, someone to be the big spoon to your small spoon, someone you can kiss before they go to work and kiss before you two go to bed. You want someone to fight and bicker with and to make up with, you want to have that firing and passionate love but it also has to be soft and domestic, you want someone to love you and you want to be loved badly. Isn’t that right, Draco?” The blond swallowed, he should have known Pansy would be the one to know him best, because she was right, he wanted one, but sadly, he hasn’t felt that kind of attraction to anyone at the moment, or ever.
“That’s all?”
” Ron scoffed “No bloody way”
“Not a chance” Draco replied, he could smell the alcohol again
” Harry said, looking at Draco, his eyes full of lust and his hair were even messier than before, falling down gracefully behind his back, sweats were forming on his forehead and running down his temples as Harry wiped them away, his lips were swollen from all the kissing and his cheeks were pink, his mouth won’t stop letting out wanton moans and incoherent words, his skin was filled with marks and he was taking in all of Harry “I don’t think I can love you more right now, you look flawless”
“Okay, yes” Harry gave up, Pansy and Hermione were probably the two smartest witches he knows and no lies could get through them, and Harry wasn’t good at lying “Maybe, it’s just a stupid thing, I never did it anyway”
“It’s been two minutes into the lecture and you’re already talking about him” Pansy rolled her eyes and glared at him while professor Binns went on about history of magic “You couldn’t wait at least five minutes?”
Why couldn’t he just elaborate? Draco sighed, he could have just explained a little so he could see the resemblances too.
” He grabbed her robes but she only ruffled his hair and smiled
“Come on, do you think I’d
“He agreed” She answered softly and Ron screamed in excitement, his mission didn’t fail as bad as he thought, well only because Pansy helped him “He’s just preparing himself, he needs a minute, it’s been a while”
I heard something!”
“Yeah?” Hermione said, sitting up and making Ron flinched, he got scared whenever he did something wrong and has to face the two scary married witches, they were already powerful and scary alone, now they just became a force to be reckoned with “What did you do?”
my kiss was perfect, Potter”
Potter paused as soon as they spoke over one another, they both chuckled and the Auror spoke first “Er, you say it first”
behind him, he kept walking slowly and grabbed his taser inside his bag once he felt the person behind him walking faster
Harry grumbled in his ear, making Draco chuckled in between his wanton moans. It was winter, it was supposed to be cold, but he could see drops of sweats falling on the carpet of the stairs from his forehead. Harry’s hot body stuck to him like glue, with the sound of skin slapping on skin echoing in the house. The portrait of Aunt Walburga must have a blast hearing this from the closet where they have put her in years ago because she wouldn’t stop blabbering about how they were the filth and scum that were living in her house.
I will…I will think about it” Theodore sighed, getting on his bed and closed the curtains, seemed like Draco’s words really got to him, as it should be. The blond looked at the parchment on his bed, sighing deeply.
“Neville turned her offer down, of course, said he was already having feelings for someone else, then she cried a bit, Neville comforted her, then after she went home, Neville then just rushed away, then Seamus fell asleep at the bar and I had to bring him home”
“I don’t say I love you to a lot of people, you know” Draco mumbled to him and frowned a bit when Harry pulled out to lie down next to him, he draped Draco’s leg over his waist and pulled Draco close for a hug “Just my parents, Pansy, and you. So you better keep that promise, Harry Potter”
“Draco, I…I’m not sure how to say this, I’ve been trying the whole day today, and even before that” Harry said, still holding on Draco’s hand “You know that I love you, right?” He slowly slid down from the couch and crouched down on one knee, watching Draco’s expression turned from sleepy into shock “We’ve been together for so long…”
For the past hours, he has been talking to the people he didn’t expect to, like Weasley girl, who he now called Ginny because she seemed cool about everything,
for helping him realised what he should have seven years ago. Do you know your friend’s oblivious as hell?”
, yeah sure” Draco stuttered “Yeah, that’s, er, I’m available, I mean, I’m free tonight”
, Granger agreed to go on a date with me”
“Yeah, but, he has a nice body”

his cock twitched in Harry’s hand and he came
“Please, just a minute”
“Sorry” Draco smiled while being embraced by Harry “Thank you, again, for covering up for us”

“Oh, forgot” Pansy said “Alright, I’m dressed, plus I
“Okay, wait” Ron raised his hand up and looked around before yelling “
, oh right” Draco said and pulled out a pen from his pocket “Do you have a piece of paper?”
“I better tell Ron that” Harry hummed, stopping them suddenly as Draco looked at him “Oh, do you remember the time I broke my shoulder?”
“Here’s our free dessert” The nice waitress said with a smile, setting down the plate of chocolate soufflé “For the
“But now I’d say my greatest achievement is having Draco as my boyfriend” Brandon said, shutting everyone up, Ginny even stopped drinking, his friends all knew his feelings for Draco, they knew how awkward this must be.
“I am, my crush
“Yeah, I think it’s something I’m destined to do” He said, he could sense the tone from Potter’s voice, he was determined “I feel like I should save people, I think I enjoy the feeling. When I’m out there, I feel all…excited in my stomach, and when I fight the bad ones, it feels good”
“I’m going to come” Theo breathed out and stilled himself when his entrance was left empty “Wha-…”
” Draco murmured, looking at his door…now was broken in two pieces by a guy, a tall guy, who was wearing firefighter’s outfit with a fire extinguisher in his hand. Draco watched as the guy put the fire out quickly in seconds.
“Hey, I’m Brad” The guy extended his hand and immediately touched Draco’s while smirking “I noticed you earlier and I just wanna say, you look extremely hot and I can’t wait to strip your clothes off. What’s your name?”
“Like how you like Granger”
“That’s true”
“Why are you panicking? It’s perfectly fine, go big or go home”
“No, I believe you, I do” Harry grabbed him by his hand and pulled Draco flushed against his chest “Come on, hit me”
I’ve found the solution for your
“I told you he is not my future boyfriend”
“He asked if the mirror would ever be broken” Pansy said, her eyes looking up as she tried to jog her memory “Granger said it’s impossible, she mentioned some stuff proving her points. Potter listened, I got really bored”
“Miss P-…”
! The water is amazing” Hermione called and Pansy added “
, like a
“Oh, yeah sure, yeah” Draco said “So…do you want to go in?” Draco opened the door and walked in first. He turned on the light and Harry finally got inside, he forgot to clean his house,
“It’s so sweet” He commented
know when I fell for Pansy exactly, it’s the things that add up to
” Harry’s eyes widened and he spun around to see Draco on the other side of the open door, his hand clutched tightly to the doorknob, he was shaking, his eyes were teary and his nose was red from all the crying, even his cheeks were pink. He was in his robes, it looked like he was just at a fancy event earlier
“Hi, aren’t you supposed to be organising books with Pansy now?” He asked, watching her flopped down on the couch with a small frown on her face “Did she cancel?”
He said, turning on his right to face Potter. For once, he was serious about this, he wanted to have that feelings again, to know whether or not his own mind was tricking him into believing that he didn’t have feelings for Potter. Maybe he did, maybe Pansy was right…was she always right?
“It’s almost midnight” Hermione heaved softly as Pansy continued kissing her, their tongues intertwining, she could taste the Firewhiskey from her wife and she could drown in it. How long have they been kissing in Harry’s guest bedroom? Pansy couldn’t remember, she just knew she couldn’t stop. Pansy reached her hand under Hermione’s silk dress and slid up to her breast, only to be stopped abruptly “
“I’m disgusted” Draco sneered, pulling his hand away and leaned back on his chair. This guy so far was the creepiest one, and he’s only talked to five people until this moment, Lilian, a nice guy who was straight, a teenage girl that sneaked in this place that Draco had to tell Theo about, the guy before and then Brad
Draco rushed out of the room and started running. How did he return? Did the other Draco do something? Or was it just time to go back? When he got to his own dorm, it was empty, there was still one of the magazines Pansy would always read left on his bed, she was here. Draco grabbed the small mirror on his study and looked at himself. He was slightly different, his hair was styled another way. Draco’s eyes immediately saw a folded parchment on his table
He just got a date with a person who was
“It’s really important to him” Pansy cooed softly close to his ear, her fingers twirling the hair on the back of his head “They work really hard, Ron didn’t get much sleep, this is a
“Well,
“Is that why you got uncle Draco a ring?” Rose asked him again, kids really do know how to ask tough questions now “My mummy says you only give rings to people you love and want to marry. My mummy gives my mum the prettiest ring, they got married, and then they had me” She smiled, playing with her orange stuffed dragon that Charlie got her as a baby, which she always carried around “Do you want to marry uncle Draco?”
, and I’m saying this because I mean it, if you don’t fuck me right now, I will kick you off the bed, I didn’t save my virginity for 27 years for nothing”
“Trust me, I don’t even remember what I just said” Harry confessed, his hands helping Draco unbuttoned his shirt “I just…really want to kiss you more”
“Maybe we could beat him up” Ginny added in, leaning into the screen with a grin, making Draco chuckled “I could take him down easily, break him in half, if you’d like”
“Believe me now?”
Draco squealed when he was picked up by Harry and placed down on his back on the floor, changing their position
“Draco, what’s the matter with you? He’s just not my type, that’s all” Theodore said, making Draco groaned frustratingly “Why are you getting so upset?”
“Kiss me, Potter” He said, and received what he asked for, their lips met for another sweet kiss, Harry sucking on his lower lips as his hands moved down to the blond’s arse, squeezing his globes apart, Draco moaned into the kiss, arching his lower body into Harry’s arms, yearning for more,
“I know” Pansy pushed him away and continued “I’m a wonderful wife, you guys shut up about it, alright?”
“Alright, anyone got any
“No, no, I mean, well, you can say whatever you want” Harry stuttered and Draco cleared his throat, moving a little bit to get far from the Auror
“Maybe” Harry answered before leaning down and kissed his cheeks “Maybe I just…” He planted a kiss on his nose and forehead, making the blond giggled “Really love you”
” Draco grumbled “I’m ending this call” He quickly shut his phone off and looked back at Harry, who was still standing awkwardly in the room “Er, sorry, I didn’t…I didn’t know you are friends with them, they rarely mention you”
, Hermione” Draco said “How could a normal person have a normal bulge
, and then we could
” Hermione nudged Pansy by her elbow
“Spill it”
“It’s no big deal, alright?” Ron said, his cheeks wouldn’t stop reddening
“Isn’t this party for graduates only?” He looked at her, she looked tipsy, he had only just arrived for five minutes, later than everyone else, since he had some thinking to do.
Draco tilts his head and weighs his options.
“I’ll stay,” Harry says. “I’ll be right here.” He points at the couch. His hand doesn’t even go back to its previous position before Draco is out of the room.
“Just, I hope it’s not much, but, please, er, don’t avoid me” Draco glanced at Potter when he said the words, so he knew something was wrong, but still, he was being understanding enough to wait for Draco to be ready to talk to him. Would the Potter in his world be like this too?
“I’m not sure,
Hermione added “Harry, would you mind helping me putting the food out on the table? And Rose, you know it’s dinner time”
“Do you regret leaving twelve years ago?” He asked, trying to stop himself from acting like an Auror at this moment and interrogating Draco right now
“He kept asking why you apologised to all of us and not him for the past week, then a few days ago, he got even more upset somehow” Ron shrugged, putting away the chess “I’m not sure what happened too, he doesn’t say, I told him he’s obsessed…er, I mean, he just doesn’t say” Ron stuttered when he realised he had said too much to someone he hasn’t trusted yet. Draco was satisfied with his answer anyway, the blond nodded and left the Common Room, Harry’s eyes still on him the whole way out.
“When did you get out of that tie? That was a perfect single column tie” Draco gaped at him, moaning loudly when Harry pulled his shirt down and latched down on his nipples, sucking and grazing his teeth lightly, just teasing him “
“I don’t think she meant alcohol-
will no longer have my nice skin if you keep digging your utterly hard nails into my flesh” He pried her hand away and rubbed his sore arm “How’s planning the party? Did Granger let you bring alcohol in the party?”
don’t stop” Draco lifted his head and mumbled  hoarsely “I can take it, don’t worry about me”
“Potter?” He said and Potter looked at him, finally, he swallowed hard before speaking up again “Er, so, here’s the thing”
“Sounds like you’re jealous” Ron snickered, and for the first time, Ron actually might be right
“We will go up and change our clothes, then we’ll go down and have a taste of Luna’s cake, alright?”
“Alright, I’ll go” He replied “Should we go to the Common Room? Our friends are waiting”
“Pansy, why did you light up candles? Did Rose break the light—…” Harry looked up at the entrance and saw Draco there, in a black sweatshirt and a pair of black trousers “What is going on?”
“There’s a myth, Hermione told me, although she doesn’t believe in it, she said—…”
“You’re just grumpy because you can’t get Neville to like you” Pansy pursed her lips into a smirk and flipped a finger at Theo, which earned a gasp from him
“Draco deserves the right to know, right?” Pansy nudged Hermione and continued “It might work out fine”
He groaned, pulling all of Draco’s hair up so it won’t fall into his face. Though everyone always praised him and calling him the most powerful one in the wizarding world and shit like that, he felt powerless whenever he was with Draco.
get mad because you told Ron” Hermione reasoned
“I did” Harry confessed, he did travel to Paris the next day, figuring out where Draco stayed, but it was simply too hard, until he
But that’s what I think, I’m not sure” Pansy used just the same boost she used on Harry for Draco, hoping he’d choose the right one “So, Draco, you can either choose Harry, or Cormac, or Celeste.
“I’m so sorry” Draco apologised quickly
“Cormac is here” Pansy said, realising she had noticed Cormac flirting with men and women in the room just hours ago “I don’t know who invited him but we all know he has been tailing Draco every time he got the chance to for the past years, I’ve told Blaise to keep an eye on him so he won’t bother Draco tonight but for all we know, Cormac could be out there cornering Draco right now” She explained, she wasn’t sure where Cormac got the obsession for Draco from, but the wanker hasn’t stopped trying even though Pansy had threatened him no more than ten times “
“Yeah”
She called and tilted her head to the side “The bubbles are not covering anything now”
“What are you staring at?”
“I might be” Draco blushed when Harry suddenly asked “You were half naked with only the shoulder holster on you, Harry,
“Pub night, tonight” Pansy announced “Everyone has to be there”
“We’re leaving” Theo said, dragging Roger away out of the room, but as soon as they were out, Roger pinned him on the wall again, Theo sighed deeply, letting the Auror did what he want to do. He told himself this would be the last time he followed this stupid crush of his, he was never able to stop, Neville was the first man he ever had real feelings for, but the man didn’t have feelings back for him, so this was what heartbreaks felt like.
“No, he doesn’t, shut up”
“Er, unless you want it to be more than a peck, I don’t—I…whatever you want, I don’t mind”
“Wait for it” Harry leaned close again, his head touching Draco’s “Ginny will pass out first”
“That’s my favourite boxers” Harry pointed out and Draco gave him a flirtatious wink, he licked a stripe up Harry’s cock, tasting the bittersweet, burning of the Firewhisky in his throat and the salty taste from Harry’s length. Draco licked him clean, stroking the cock with his good hand, hearing the sound of Harry’s breathing quicken every second. The blond swirled his tongue around the head, teasing him and knowing Harry could burst any second now with the way his hand on Draco’s long hair was starting to tighten. Draco finally swallowed it in but he could never fully suck it whole unless Harry thrust in his mouth, he craved it bad. The blond started bobbing his head back and forth, sliding his hands up Harry’s thighs, teasing him with featherlight touches.
“Potter” He said tenderly “Potter” Draco nudged the guy but he didn’t move at all, the blond sighed and pinched Potter’s cheek hard “
“Oh, right”
here” Harry rolled his eyes, his hand digging into the bowl of popcorn on his lap as he continued watching his movie while Pansy and Hermione bickered behind the couch as if he wasn’t here and couldn’t hear them “You can stop fighting because of me”
Draco gasped when his best friend turned around and splash water at his face, the girls laughed louder and even Hermione joined to splash more water on both of them, Draco covered his face with his hands until he felt someone covering for him, he opened his eyes and looked up to see Potter smiling at him
him in the loo?” Draco gaped, pulling Brandon to his spot “How could you, Harry?”
“Don’t worry about it, I’m glad you like it” He said, he knew she’d love it, just the red cheeks showing on her face now expressed her gratitude enough. He couldn’t believe one day he’d hear these words from her, a Weasley, and it felt nice.
“You two are weird” He said, Blaise was extremely protective of Ron so it was scary for all of them whenever Blaise was mad “Aren’t you scared he’s going to do something bad?”
“Harry, what do you think?” Draco turned to him and Harry stared at the blond. What the hell was he supposed to think? Draco intended to go on a date, and Harry couldn’t do anything about it “Do you think these guys are being unreasonable? Should I go on this date?”
” Pansy waved at them while standing next to Hermione and walked to their spot “Fancy?”
“Haley, can we speak outside?” Harry stood up, leading Haley out of the restaurant, he needed to draw the line
“I thought you cleaned it” Draco elbowed Harry and the guy shrugged
“Alright” She held her arms up in defeat and opened the door “Just finish this quickly, alright? I’m not missing my Thanksgiving at the Burrow because of you two, Molly’s gonna make me my favourite yam”
” He cursed softly, unable to form any other word when all of Harry was fully inside him
” Draco exclaimed and looked at them with shock “Hello? Why are you guys here?”
“You know?” Pansy asked and Ron nodded at her, she chuckled and continued, leaning on the wall and watched as Harry carried Draco up the stairs “Well, years ago, he said his last wish before going to Paris was to see Harry, and he did, they even fucked, so that went better than he ever expected. But he got transferred back here this year and from what he has been telling me, he’s still not over Harry”
“I thought I was obvious” Harry chuckled quietly, and brought the soaking wet towel to the sink, he squeezed the water out of it and Draco almost lost his balance when he saw Harry flexed.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s obliviousness. How could a guy be so hot and so cute at the same time like this? He watched Harry slowly realised what Draco meant, his mouth forming an “O”. Draco waved his hand, signalling Harry to get inside, and the Auror obeyed.
“You recognised his wand?”
“So, what was code red today?” Pansy spoke up first when it was getting too quiet in the booth
“Er” Draco started blushing “O-of course, I mean, I just di—…” Now this time he was ambushed by Potter, he pulled Draco closed and pushed him back against the wall, he heard the door close and opened his eyes when Potter slid his tongue in, the blond ran his hands down Potter’s bare chest and closed his eyes again, feeling Potter’s hand on the small of his back, his other hand holding Draco’s neck. Draco felt weak in the knees already, with Potter’s tongue deep in his mouth, their skin touching each other, he also realised he was wearing his bathrobes, but he couldn’t care anymore. Draco rubbed himself against Potter’s crotch, which was only covered by a thin piece of towel, he could feel Potter’s bulge, grinding against his. Pansy was right, it
“It’s not a true vacation if you don’t get tanned, Draco” Hermione said with a smirk, he knew she was smirking “Just get out of the umbrella”
“I think I heard him saying he wants to shag Draco just half an hour ago” Hermione said, unfortunately it wasn’t a lie, Cormac did say that “So he will have no problem kissing Draco at midnight”
“Yeah, I know that” Harry touched his hand and planted a kiss on the centre of his palm “I just want to be with you”
He answered, looking away and nodding his head “Yeah, absolutely, I only did it for the game, of course, Potter. Why else would I do that?”
“Can I have a shower first?”
“Where’s Pansy? She said she’d grab us another drink, it’s been more than half an hour since she left and no drink”
Hermione glared at her and pushed Pansy back up, both of them sitting up on the bed and she watched as Hermione fixed her dress again “What do we do?” Pansy groaned loudly when she realised what Hermione was asking her about, she rubbed her face into the crook of Hermione’s neck while they sat there, her arms slinging around her wife’s waist and she felt like a baby “It’s fifteen minutes until midnight and we gotta find a way for them to talk to each other. You said you want them to be together”
“That’s weird, you’re not smoking anymore” Pansy cocked her head to the side, resting her arm on the chair near her
“You did?”
He called, seeing Blaise walking in the library, carrying his bag “What are you doing here?”
“Oh, okay” He said and looked down. Potter just knew what to do, about everything, he was such a loser comparing to Potter, in every way. He sighed and played with the bowl nearby, maybe it would be better if Potter just went out with that girl rather than Draco, at least
“They hate you?”
“Absolutely” Pansy said “Yesterday, I asked the staff the decorate the room with roses and everything, when we came home after the opera, Hermione and I had the best bath ever, and yes, we had sex in it”
“I need five minutes, sir, that’s all” Harry put his foot in between the door when Lucius was about to shut the door in front of him. It was barely a few weeks after he and Draco got back together, things were back to the ways they were, but Harry wanted more to happen, he wanted to get married to Draco
” Draco yelled back
idea” Pansy gasped and nodded immediately “I burned stuff of my exes all the time, or I cut their clothes. Hermione, thoughts?”
“Yeah?”
“Then I will go hold Hugh’s hands!” Jamie said cheerfully, hopping away to find Pansy and Hermione’s son before Draco could stop him.
“Glad to know that’s your choice” Pansy smirked, smacking him softly before sashaying away to Hermione’s spot. For Potter, he was practically skipping to Draco’s place with joy. He wondered if the Potter in his world would also show this side of his to Draco.
“It’s not like you and Blaise don’t do that” Pansy pursed her lips and pulled out a lipstick from her bag “Seems to me, you and Blaise get it on real
“That was fun” Hermione said when they walked back to the resort with the chocolates they made wrapped in a cute small bags. The chocolate macadamia nuts candies that Potter made were perfect, the moment Draco had a taste of it, he had to bite back a moan “This is for you” Hermione said, handing a bag with a piece of chocolate shaped like Pansy’s head “I tried my best”
“No! No” He mumbled and Weasley nodded his head “I’m just wondering, that’s all”
“I’m going back, my break is over” Pansy gripped on Draco’s shoulder and walked away. The blond sighed and rested his hands on his thighs, his legs couldn’t keep shaking, he could he fired,
masterpiece” Harry closed their distance and landed a kiss on Draco’s collarbone “
So he knew Draco didn’t trust him, the blond eyed him carefully and listened. Draught of Living Death was indeed one of the hardest potions to make, he couldn’t even make it to perfection back in Sixth Year, but somehow Harry did it, so perhaps he should listen. Draco held tightly to the dagger and crushed it like he asked, earning a really small smirk on Harry’s face.
“Yeah, I will give it back to you later” He looked away, avoiding the Potter’s eyes and clutching at his robes “I forgot about it, sorry”
in the bedroom”
“You, you were going to propose?”
” He corrected himself, and Draco’s heart might have skipped a beat hearing his first name rolling off Potter’s tongue so easily “Look, I like you too, I
He was a part of Luna and Ginny’s family just five years ago, the two of them have been together way before that, since Eighth Year in Hogwarts to be exact. They were
“Go, we’ll catch up” Potter said, gestured for the girls to go first, while Draco still tried to calm his breath, it was too much, he rested his hands on his knees and closed his eyes, he needed a rest. When he opened his eyes, Potter was crouching down on the ground for some reasons
” Theo scoffed “Except one” Draco groaned, Theo wasn’t always the brightest person in their group, but he would get it, eventually. Draco looked back at Harry, and quickly diverted his eyes when he noticed Harry was looking at him

“Is there anything you two would like to share to the whole room?”
” He mumbled when Harry took his glasses off and put them on the sink nearby “Your eyes” He said, mesmerised by Harry’s eyes up close, the first time he got to see these green eyes so close was probably the time back in the war, when he was asked to identify Harry. Who could possibly not know that it was Harry? Even if he was turned into another person, Draco could sense it a mile away. He cupped Harry’s face and stared into those eyes, the way his pupils dilated when Draco smiled, he realised how much Harry liked him.
“You didn’t run away from Voldemort, why would you run away from Draco?” Hermione asked, and it did make him wonder. Why would he throw their relationship away so quickly?
He said loudly, it was comfortable now calling her by her first name, he didn’t know he’d feel this good about this…about being nice. Draco dusted his robes and walked back to his dorm. Luna was the first person, he still got more to apologise for, but he reckoned they’d come looking for him soon.
“You’re ruining the mood” Theo sighed and leaned back “Stop worrying about others. With them, it was just
” Draco asked, leaning his forehead on Harry’s and showed him a satisfied smile once the Auror finally pulled out “Am I as good as the actors in those videos you were watching?”
from you—”
“What are we baking?” Draco asks, stepping closer.
He sighs quietly and decides to get up and change into his sleep robe to feel at least a bit less silly. Still, he sneaks out of the room to do it because even though the chance of Harry waking up right now is small, and even though it’s dim, Draco isn’t going to risk him seeing anything.
Draco doesn’t really know what to do with that. He takes one egg and turns it in his hand pointlessly.
“Beautiful? You’re beautiful.”
Harry’s stretched out on the bed, naked, as always, and Draco is sitting on top of him, half-naked, as always, and it shouldn’t be the beginning of a problem, really—in fact, they’re both horny and hard, so it seems like a good thing.
“Because I’m bored.”
Draco shudders at the name and closes his eyes briefly. “No. Never. Why would it ever happen? He’s dead.” He spits the last sentence angrily. “I went to the Ministry last week, and they performed the spells to check if my Mark shows any signs of activity.” He finally looks back at her. “It’s inactive. I guess we can all sleep peacefully.”
because of it. Carrow was a pig and turned Hogwarts into a Dark Magic School.”
Draco nods.
“I was bleeding out, and you just stood there and watched.”
It was scary, but on top of inducing fear it was also humiliating. There was something in that moment that made him feel less human, and Draco didn’t understand that. These people hadn’t done anything horribly bad to him. They hadn't caused any physical harm, hadn’t threatened him. Yet, when he was putting his robe back on, his fingers were shaking, and when he was back in his cell, alone, he felt dirty.
Draco has his mouth full of cake, so he only shrugs.
“What’s your point?”
“Do you have some?”
Draco tightens his grip around Harry’s hand. “Not yet.”
Something rises within Draco’s chest—anger or maybe simply desperation. He doesn’t answer, instead he clenches his fists and continues breathing deeply, trying to calm himself down. Now that he’s more aware of his surroundings, he can also feel his robes clinging to his sweaty body. If it wasn’t for Harry being around, he’d take them off. This thought makes him even more angry.
Draco looks down at the table. He can’t keep eye contact with them while he’s saying it.
“Draco, let me remind you I cast Cruciatus on Amycus Carrow for spitting in McGonagall’s face.”
“I can go with you,” Harry proposes.
“Hey. Hey,” a voice calls to him, and Draco can’t place it. It seems to be coming from nowhere and everywhere; maybe it’s a voice inside his head; maybe it’s the Dark Lord speaking directly to him.
Draco yelps, and only a second later he realises he’s actually dangerously close to crying—his chest is clenched so tight he can barely breathe.
When he wakes up, he can already smell food. Sausages and fried onions—Merlin, he hasn’t even known he was that hungry.
Draco is familiar with all of this. “I’m sorry—”
Draco doesn’t remember much of the few months he spent in prison. Every day seemed exactly the same, so the time kept merging into one big blur. The only moments that stood out were his interrogations and his hearing.
Draco wavers. He could talk. He could try to explain himself. As he keeps looking at Harry, though, rage keeps growing inside him. Rage at Harry, rage at himself, rage at his parents. Rage at the whole world, at all his mistakes and all missed opportunities.
She considers it. “Maybe.”
Draco falls quiet. He has never dreamt of that specific scenario.
Angelique is at a conference in France, and Draco needs to wait more than a week for an appointment. That’s fine. He had decided to notify the Ministry about the pain in his arm, and doing it was
Draco shakes his head.
“Nightmares?”
“Could you recommend me some books on potions’ interactions? Particularly ones including Horned Serpent…”
When Harry and Draco get there, they are greeted by Molly and Arthur. The two introduce themselves by their names to Draco, and Arthur even shakes his hand. Draco is slightly surprised by this gesture but tries to not show it.
“I’ll owl Angelique to make an appointment, but I want to drop this subject for now,” he says, his arms still tight around Harry.
“You were unhappy that I didn’t want to go to their dinners.”
Those are the people who either don’t look him in the eye, presumably scared that he still poses a serious danger to society, or who look at him with so much hatred and disgust that Draco needs to summon all his willpower to not curl in on himself.
Harry’s right hand travels to his face, trembling as if belonging to an old man.
He looks at Harry again. Harry looks completely real. His messy hair falls onto his forehead, and a couple of loose strands stick out in various directions. His eyelids are puffy from sleep, but his eyes are open wide, alert, like he’s ready to face any danger.
“I can do two things at the same time, you know? And I told you, you don’t get to decide what I’m doing with my body.”
“What are you on about?” Harry chimes in.
“I had dreams in which my Mark looked...active. Why have I never had any dreams in which he–?” He looks Angelique in the eyes, still trying to find any answers. “It’s been ten years.”
Harry doesn’t answer.
with you? You know, the one where I explain to you how you’re the Jesus of all wizards, and I spent all my youth tormenting people and then joined a fashist organisation—”
He starts going for walks, every day, dragging his heavy legs forward and forward, wherever they take him. He makes discoveries exploring the Muggle area around his house. He didn’t know the town he lives in has more than one bookshop. He didn’t see the cosy-looking cafe just around the corner of his street. He doesn’t recognise any of the faces of the people he passes by—why would he?—but he can’t help but wonder how it would feel to know some of them.
“I wasn’t—” Harry starts. “I just wanted to hold your hands.”
“Or yours.”
“But maybe I should. Maybe I should, because—” Draco’s voice gets stuck in his throat. He’s barely able to finish the sentence. “Every time I look at it, I get reminded of what you did, so I think it’s only fair that you get to experience that, too.”
“Do you want to look at me?” Draco asks. “Or rather not? Would it feel appealing or scary? Or maybe disgusting?”
Harry takes Draco’s hand. “Oh. No, you don’t,” he says, but when Draco gives him a doubtful look, he adds, “not to me, anyway.”
“That’s not true—”
“I’m sorry.” Draco tries to make it sound as powerful and honest as he can.
“Yeah, but it’s easier with a mirror.”
“I think we make a good pair,” Harry adds quietly. He sounds a bit like he’s expecting rejection; his voice is shy, and even his words somehow appear small. Draco already knows this conversation won’t be easy.
“You mean—my trauma from ten years ago?” he asks dryly.
He watches Molly levitating dishes onto the table and sends her a hesitant smile when he catches her gaze. She smiles back.
“As if it isn’t something you would do.”
“Do you want to stay here for the night?” Harry asks when Draco gets to the point of nearly dozing off.
“Also, I told Weasley that I will come to their dinner next week. Forgot to tell you.”
“I’m not doing things on your command.”
Harry shifts closer, and Draco does everything in his power to not jump back or flinch. His arm is trembling, but he’s able to hold it out.
Harry comes up to him. His smile is so loving, and he looks so proud. He cups Draco’s jaw and leads him to a kiss.
“This is not easy for me,” Draco admits.
“Good?” Harry whispers, and this time it’s him burying his hand in Draco’s hair, slowly massaging his scalp.
“You’re making no sense. Is it because you feel guilty?”
Harry grabs his hand with both of his. “What do you want to do?”
“I imagine.”
Harry realises his mistake quickly. “Oh, have you never—? Do you know how to crack an egg?”
Without surfaces that could reflect his image, he closes his eyes and unbuttons his shirt. The act, after all these years passed, still feels almost reckless. Theoretically, it should be comforting to be able to change his clothes without having to overly pay attention to the surroundings, without the fear that someone could see his Dark Mark and discover his big, nasty secret. Practically, he hasn’t reached the stage yet when it all feels like the past, not the present.
That is, it seems like a good thing until Harry raises his arm to push his hair all the way back, exposing his forehead and the scar that Draco—once again—has trouble to ignore. This time, however, Draco’s staring doesn’t go unnoticed.
“Please, just talk to me instead,” Harry says.
“Just like in the old days. Just—don’t punch me, please.”
“That’s your solution? Just telling me to fuck off? Merlin, Draco, don’t you see that I’m trying to help?”
Draco recognises the stiffness in her voice—it’s the same tone he uses when he’s uncomfortable, when he tries to mask his true feelings.
“Why would I not be doing it? Don’t I have the right to undress myself in my own house?” Harry doesn’t answer, so Draco continues, “Do I have no right over my body?”
She shakes her head. “It’s possible that you may have experienced something we call a pain flashback. The nightmare triggered you, and when you woke up, your nervous system was stuck in re-living the time when your Dark Mark was still active.”
“You don’t have to scream at me,” Harry says coldly.
“Do you want some eggs, too?”
Harry doesn’t answer. Draco figures he must have made him uncomfortable. This whole conversation might have been one huge mistake.
So many people could look at him now, at the pictures of his body. He would never know who has seen the scars on his chest or the Dark Mark on his arm; he was stripped of all the control of the situation. Someone could hang those pictures in their office or even in their bedroom if they were feeling particularly insane. Someone could sell those photographs to a newspaper. The idea was almost nauseating.
Draco rapidly loses his patience. “Of course we talked about my Mark, that’s why I went there!”
He’s sitting at the desk in his office, staring at the files he’s supposed to study, not able to read more than a few sentences at a time. Instead, he thinks back to the time of his arrest.
“All right.”
“Anyway, I tried to use an Unforgivable on you. You had the right to defend yourself.”
When Harry doesn’t answer, Draco continues his tirade.
Draco tries hard to not roll his eyes. “Not family drama again.”
It all doesn’t make sense. The Dark Lord is dead. Is it possible that he found the secret to ultimate immortality? Or is Draco still inside the dream, and none of this is real?
Draco shrugs.
“You’re being aristocratic again.”
. They wanted the bad to be punished and the good to thrive.
Draco nods. He doesn’t trust his voice.
“Harry, don’t go over your limits just to please me. Or because you think you have to. It’s all bullshit. If I start saying stupid shit, tell me to fuck off.”
Draco reaches out and gently touches Harry’s shoulder. The gesture wakes him up almost immediately. He looks straight at Draco in a moment of sleepy confusion.
“Maybe,” Harry hesitates, “but I did not tell Ron to do anything, okay?”
“Weasley.”
Draco takes a deep breath and puts his hands down. When he speaks, his voice is shaky. “I don’t know what to do, Harry. I guess I deserved it all. All the nightmares that I have, the fact that I can’t stand looking at myself, that I can’t stand people looking at me, that I feel like I need to hide all the time… It’s all just the price that I pay for my mistakes.”
“Lumos,” he chokes out. “Lumos. Lumos.”
Harry goes back to stroking, this time picking Draco’s arm to rub small circles on. He never touches his forearm, even though it’s Draco’s right hand—not the left one, even though his arm is covered with a long, long sleeve.
“Let’s say that I could look past it. Still, how can I talk to you about it when you’ve had to deal with the exact same problem even longer?” He looks at Harry’s scar, then back into Harry’s eyes. “How dare I talk to you about it? I served the same person who did this to you.”
Harry shakes his head. “Why did you try to use that on me?”
Harry pauses mid-taking a bite. “What do you mean?”
Harry looks as if he’s debating what to respond. “All right,” he says eventually.
“You’re making me out to be a damn puppy. Harry, I’m a war criminal! As if me doing one nice thing now can compare to any of the crimes—”
Once again, it turns out that having a casual conversation with Ronald Weasley isn’t actually that hard of a task. What worries Draco more is that Harry appears quiet and withdrawn the entire time. Draco spends the whole evening glancing at Harry over and over again, but Harry never looks back.
Draco shakes his head violently and pulls up his left sleeve.
Draco carefully adjusts his tone of voice to a polite, official one. “Oh, no, he does. I did receive a few, and you can tell your mother that I appreciate them. Unfortunately, I’m pretty busy these days, but I’ll make sure to send her some cake as a thank you.”
The flash goes off, and then it’s over. Draco catches out of the corner of his eye Ron pulling his arm from behind Hermione’s back. He feels so jealous of them for posing for a picture like any average couple, while he and Harry can barely even look at each other.
Harry pulls up the sleeves of his robe. His forearms are hairy and veiny; they look strong in a way Draco’s arms will never even get close to resemble.
After the dinner, Draco wonders what Harry must have said to Arthur and Molly for them to have reacted so positively to his failed apology. Maybe he didn’t say anything. Maybe the Weasleys have acquired some kind of good, redeemed picture of Draco from the way Harry’s been talking about him.
Draco remembers this book specifically, remembers the red cover and frail, yellow pages. He remembers his father sitting in his reading chair with this book in his lap. He remembers how he—being too young to understand the gravity of his action—reached his fingers to touch the fire-breathing dragon on one of the pages, wanting to check if the flame would be hot.
“You matter more.”
“I don’t know what needs improvement. Maybe I need improvement.”
Draco laughs before he’s able to stop himself. “It was a common courtesy to ask you. I’m not afraid of your germs.”
He brushes his teeth and thinks—
“Draco, I see you at my place less than twice a month.”
“Yes.”
He doesn’t like Harry looking at his body either. He knew since their first date (if one can even call it such) that he would rather let Harry see his dick than his arms or chest. So, the first time they wanked each other, Draco had his shirt on. Then the second time, and third, and so on.
“So, the dinner went quite well, don’t you think?”
Draco only hums. Within a few minutes, he’s asleep.
Well, there it goes, him being
“No, I mean—yes, but there’s an insect inside it.”
“Great.” Harry’s face and voice are marked with anger. “Well, let me know when you’ve made up your mind.”
He goes straight to the bedroom to grab his sleep robe and then follows to the bathroom. His hands fumble with the buttons of the robe he’s wearing on the way there, but only when he locks himself in the familiar room with blue tiles and foggy mirror, he takes it off fully.
Mrs Clance, the librarian, definitely belongs to the third category.
He visits him in the evening, briefly, just to bring him some of the leftovers.
“Yeah, she barged in an Auror meeting to announce that” Ron added, which only made Draco more horrified.
“Look what we got here” A familiar voice whispered in his ear, he felt annoyed, but let McLaggen put his hands on his waist anyway, he knew how to protect himself. He remembered how it felt, and if he was being honest, McLaggen was one of his one night stands, but he couldn’t stand someone who’d talk
“Weird tactics, but I get it” Draco said “I can do it, relax”
“Oh, already sleeping” Pansy pouted when she saw Potter “So cute. But I mean, this vacation”
“It’s alright” Harry smiled “We have nothing to hide, right?”
“No, I
“We are awkward towards each other because we were
. That must be it! Because Potter
“I, er, I guess, kinda”
“So, I’m done with my stuff. Are you? We should head home” Ron stood up and started closing all the files on his table before pilling them up and walked to Harry’s spot “It’s a
“I kind of fell because…I saw you” Harry explained, Draco’s mouth fell open as he let out a gasp “I was flying, and I saw you in the hospital wing. You looked…really nice under the moonlight, it’s the first time I’ve ever thought of you that way, and it might be the reason why I lost balance”
“Pansy, you can do this” Hermione said from behind, touching her wife’s shoulder gently
“I bet you can’t”
He mumbled as Harry pushed the third digit in, curling it up and earning a loud moan from him. Harry has been fucking him long enough to know where his sweet spot was and he kept pushing at it. When he leaned down and licked around the rim while his fingers were inside, his other hand stroking Draco’s cock, the blond grabbed Harry’s wrist immediately, it would be too much for him to handle “
“Okay, time to pack” He said, putting the box to the bedside table and standing up “We will start with my clothes, separate them into shirts, trousers, robes, pyjamas and others, then we will continue with my books, parchments and quills. You need to be careful, because we will put them into boxes, don’t do it wrong”
“Yeah, it’s your thing, I never really get it, you say it’s the closeness you two share, the whispers, the laughters you two have together back then were what made you like him” Draco looked down on his shoes while listening to Pansy talk, he didn’t know how much the Draco in this world meant to Potter, it seemed like they both shared a great bond with each other. And maybe, just maybe, he could have had that with Potter in his world too, if only he hadn’t messed up his first meeting with him. But that was all in the past “
“Okay Ron, listen to me, you look
“Okay, because if you kiss me, I will hex you” Draco stated, watching the way Potter chuckled and nodded at him. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath, he could hear the rustling sound in front of him, then Potter stepped forward.
“And?”
” Potter smiled, fiddling with his beer, his eyes avoiding Draco “Still, thank you for doing that”
“Of course” Draco played with the rim of his glass and breathed out a heavy sigh. Of course he remembered, that was the night he
Harry murmured into his ears, lifting Draco’s left leg up and thrusted in faster
“Is it okay to Apparate with him?” He heard Neville spoke. And though now he could easily get out of this situation with wandless magic, he figured he’d still have to go anyway “Would it Splinch him or something?”
“No, what is it?” Theo asked and Draco stood in the corner of the room, he knew Pansy’s intention already, he just didn’t want to spoil it
. Draco read the dates and words on it carefully, his body quivering but not from the cold, it was from the surprise he has received from Harry.
“Do you like snow?” Potter asked him, pulling his attention back to the boy in front of him, he nodded and touched the snow that fell on the Gryffindor’s shoulder.
“No, not really, the N.E.W.T.s is next week and we just have to focus on it now” Pansy shrugged, flapping her robes in the air “But after it, apparently we have a post-N.E.W.T.s party to host, and a few more for just the students, no alcohol allowed”
” Draco’s hands came up to cover his mouth again “I’m sorry, the chips really tickle my throat” He cleared his throat and gave Luna a weak smile, pointing at the plate of chips in the middle of the table
“Are you sure I’m allowed to be here?” Draco sat down near the table in the Gryffindor Common Room. For some reason, Ron had asked him for a rematch in chess two weeks after they had at the party
“Are you using that as an excuse for me to swim?”
“It’s Hogwarts” Potter said and wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulder, pulling him close “
“You like ripping them apart” Draco chuckled at him and leaned up for another kiss, letting Harry’s trousers fall down the ground and getting out of his robes, leaving his upper body naked. He jumped up and wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist, holding him tight and didn’t even break off the kiss as Harry carried the blond to the living room “
” Draco gasped when his phone died, the screen went black and he clutched it tightly, Draco was scared. For the first time in life, he was scared, his hands were shaking uncontrollably.
“I was…” Harry said breathlessly, he chuckled and remained on the ground, not moving an inch “I was going to surprise you”
“Bee, bee, bee” Luna chuckled and nodded “Harry, Draco, would you mind?”
“Alright, good night”
“Draco, care to join us for breakfast, son?” His mother asked and he forced himself to smile.
“It’s alright” Hermione put her hand on top of Pansy’s, pressing a kiss on her rosy cheek “I will convince Robards again”
“No, I’m good” Draco gestured and the girls nodded before going out, Draco glanced at the stupid git still sleeping soundly and his hand unconsciously touched Potter’s messy hair “You better not drool on my robes” Draco murmured quietly and trailed his hand down the sharp jawline of the Auror. He should
“Should we go to—…”
“Turn around, I, er, I want to try something” Theo furrowed his eyebrows but turned around anyway, showing his arse at Neville’s face
“I’m not.
“You are the best thing that happened to me” Harry confessed “That night, the alcohol only made me say the words I never could out loud, I wish I hadn’t been
” He said, smiling at Harry and his husband leaned down to kiss his forehead
“We should get back, there’s a long way back” Hermione suggested and looked at the Muggle watch on her wrist “And we need to be in time for dinner, chop chop, everyone”
“Nothing is easy to forget” Hermione said, sighing deeply “Do you want to go back?”
“Er, no, I didn’t mean…” Potter said, standing up and stuttering like a kid “I just thought…no, never mind that” He exhaled and headed for the door, he looked at Draco, eyes focused on him and the corner of his lips turned up for a small smile “Er, thank you, Malfoy”
“Miss Parkinson” Robards stood up and cleared his throat “You can’t just barge in an Aurors’ meeting like this”
“They didn’t bail, they are planning their wedding”
“You’re just talking nonsense”
you, and I-I didn’t…I thought…can you please look at me?”
Draco watched the steam spiralling in the air from his cauldron, the last potion, Amortentia, he had made this back in Sixth Year. At that moment, he smelled broomstick handle, chocolate, and another smell he could not figure out what it was. He didn’t care much for it back then and just thought it was about himself. But now, as he leaned closer to the cauldron, he could still smell the broomstick handle, chocolates, and another scent he’s been smelling. It was an earthy smell, the only kind that one could get after hours at the Quidditch’s field, Draco had smelled it every night when he slept next to Harry, back when he was brought to the other world. The blond breathed out and stood up straight, he was done with his potions as there was still five minutes left.
“I…I never knew that”
“Then why is he there waiting for you?” Theo pointed out with glee in his tone, Draco huffed and looked up only to see Harry was indeed standing and waiting for him just a few feet away, already waving at him “
“Ask you what?”
“Oh…” He mumbled
Draco almost bumped into him on the way out, his hair still wet, droplets of water trailing from his neck down to his collarbone, and disappearing under the dark red satin robe he was wearing, tied at the waist and showing just enough skin to make Harry covered his lower part “
“Maybe a little” He grinned at him and Draco leaned over to press his lips on Harry’s, sucking on his bottom lip gently and touched the nape of his boyfriend’s nape, a sensitive spot of Harry that he found out after a few kisses on their graduation day. Harry pushed him back until the back of his knees hit the bed and they both fell on the mattress without breaking off the kiss. He has his hands on Harry’s chest, sliding down his hard stomach, arching up to deepen the kiss.
Harry chuckled at him and laced their fingers together as Draco continued “I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m your son’s boyfriend, and I promise to love every piece of him, I hope you will come to love me”
“You can, but, but don’t squeeze me too much” Draco answered, watching Potter slowly came up to him, draping his arm over the blond’s stomach, with his head rubbing against Draco’s shoulder, his leg on top of Draco’s “Potter—I mean Harry, I’m not the Draco you know, I mean, I still am Draco, but not the person you know” He said, his thoughts were all in a blur. He wasn’t sure how to explain it to him
“Although we stumbled upon a few rocks in our path, I still find myself being in love with you, deeply, I can’t stop” He said, looking up at Draco, who’s cheeks were turning pink, his lips trembled “It was this day two year ago I realised I can’t imagine living without you, for it’d be a dreadful life I’d suffer every day. I can’t imagine not having you by my side, looking at your beautiful face, seeing your cheerful smiles, hearing your sweet voice, caressing your body and loving you. Whenever you tell me you love me, I feel like I’m the happiest person in the whole world, and my love, you are the only one for me” He pulled out the box and opened it, showing the ring that Narcissa had given him
“I asked for two best Aurors though” Pansy hooked her arm around Hermione and said “Was a bit surprised he didn’t pick Ron”
“You go here, Harry go there”
like Harry more than you. You know what Ron told me last week? He said if Harry ever gets you as a boyfriend, it’d be fucking amazing because Harry is a real mess”
“Good” Pansy smacked on Harry’s chest while Hermione nodded and they both left to get to the other side of the room “
“Take your seats, boys” He pointed, there were only two empty seats left. One was next to Blaise, and one was next to Draco, because obviously everyone was afraid of Blaise, and Pansy already took her spot next to Millicent. Hermione was next to Neville since Harry and Ron were late. Somehow, Draco already knew how this would go.
Harry’s reaction was fair, to be honest. Draco only ever saw his grandparents wearing robes like these—Victorian, with lace accents and ruffled sleeves. Even his parents who respected tradition steered towards modern clothing, accepting that some things simply go out of fashion.
“It’s distracting,” Draco says and tries to pretend he doesn’t see the hurt on Harry’s face.
“There are days when I would agree with you. I guess you caught me on a bad day.”
“Yes. I’m here.” Draco shifts his weight to the other foot, trying to stop himself from commenting on Weasley’s weird behaviour.
He glares at the shelves. The easiest way would be to start by finding any information about the Horned Serpent, as it’s the most distinct ingredient of all. It’s been quite a long time since he needed to find any information about snakes, so he simply crouches next to the appropriate section and glances at the titles.
“Now, you try it.” He hands Draco another egg that he carefully takes.
Harry looks like he’s weighing his options. “So, Angelique thinks this is what happened to you that night.”
Draco shakes his head.
“What’s wrong?” Harry asks.
Draco thinks about the answer for a moment. What are they even doing right now? It’s been mere minutes since he came back home, and they’re already arguing. But Draco doesn’t know what to do—he doesn’t know how to de-escalate the situation, how to silence his own angry thoughts that Harry is against him, that Harry is attacking him.
because he doesn’t cry. He doesn’t allow the tears to fall; he desperately holds them back through not blinking and breathing in and out as carefully as he can. He only stares at one point of the carpet he kneels on, knowing that the smallest move could break his endurance, and he’d fully break down.
“I don’t know.” He sighs and looks as far away from her as he can. He decides to get straight to the point now instead of postponing this conversation. “It happened only once. I had a nightmare in which I was at home—previous home, I mean, the one where I grew up—and it was during the war, and I felt a burning in my left arm. When I woke up, I could still feel the pain. It only subsided after… maybe half an hour? It fully disappeared in the morning.”
Draco exhales deeply once more and mutters, “Yeah.”
“No, and don’t tell me that that one time didn’t matter.”
Harry was supposed to be at work at 6 a.m. then next day, but when Draco wakes up, he’s still in the bed right next to him.
Harry doesn’t say anything for a moment. Then he asks again, “Why?”, except this time he sounds hurt.
“Oh, actually, if you don’t mind, Hermione…” he says at one point. “I have a question. It’s not a personal one, don’t worry.”
Harry slowly reaches out and takes his hand. “Do you think we should notify someone now?”
“Draco…”
Draco takes a step back. “Oh, now it’s starting. I knew it would come.”
“You defeated a troll when you were eleven.”
Harry is by the stove, flipping the sausages with a flick of his wand. When he realises that Draco is in the room, he smiles at him.
“But I’ve had nightmares before,” Draco interrupts impatiently. “I’ve had many nightmares over the years.”
“It was a responsible thing to do, to notify the Ministry.”
Draco turns his head away.
“Because he’s in prison? And you haven’t seen him in a long time?” Draco asks, trying to not sound disappointed.
Being emotional and crying exhausts Draco to the point of falling asleep. He wakes up alone. He hopes that Harry knows he isn’t terribly mad with him—after all, if Draco was truly angry, he would have left Harry’s flat altogether.
Draco is surprised that this thought even crosses his mind.
Harry puts his toast back on the plate and stares at it hollowly. “When did it start?”
“Your Dark Mark is hurting.”
Draco leans back in his chair. “Merlin, I’m not going to talk with you here, don’t you understand? I thought you grew out of being so dense.”
Harry’s shoulders slouch forward. When he speaks, his voice is quiet again. “I never wanted to do that.”
Draco nods. “Do you think He’s back?”
“Do you not want me to ask?” Harry adds after a moment of silence.
“I baked a cake with Harry. Once.”
Nothing like this happens. Instead, the sound of the front door being slammed shut makes Draco jump.
Sometimes people stare at him. He’s not stupid enough to wear robes when he goes for walks in Muggle areas—obviously—so unusual clothing is not the reason why they pay so much attention to him. He actually thinks he could pass for a regular Muggle, with the jeans and jacket he borrowed from Harry.
But Harry’s hands move quickly, and soon he cracks the egg on the edge of the counter and empties the insides into the bowl, and the whole thing is over.
Draco looks down at the table. He doesn’t believe Harry. Even though he’s aware that it’s slowly destroying him, it feels like a small, insignificant issue. Who cares if he doesn’t look at himself? Isn’t that just a pathetic coping mechanism that a person as weak as him would develop after a while?
“If nothing works out, it won’t be your fault.”
“I’m also at work.”
“—but I don’t know who I am.”
“Why are you doing this?” Harry asks, his voice shaking.
“I know.”
“Draco, I know what I did to you. You really don’t need to show me—”
“Well, I planned to bake one and bring it here, but then I changed my mind because I thought it would be better to come here as soon as I was free.”
Things quickly get back to normal after that one verbal confrontation. Life goes on, and the first thing that deviates from the routine is the Sunday dinner at the Weasley’s.
“It means that I deal with shit on my own.”
And Draco appreciates it, even if he would never admit it out loud. At least one person acting respectfully makes him feel just a bit more comfortable existing in his own skin. He wouldn’t want to resort to wearing scarfs everyday to protect himself from snoopy gazes, especially if they were to come from someone he spends so much time with.
One look at Harry’s face, and Draco knows he’s being completely honest.
Harry’s tone of voice is level and neutral as he interrupts him, “Just thought I’d ask.”
“Yes, that’s good. Just breathe.”
“You told me it did.”
“Draco…”
Draco sighs. “I’ve forgiven you for what you did to me, but it doesn’t change the fact that I still have to live a life knowing that you almost killed me. And I know that you have to live bearing the same knowledge. I know that you feel guilty for what you did. Guilt feels so horrible, doesn’t it?”
It’s like the feeling of dread never leaves him. He walks through the halls and thinks—
“How’s your relationship with Harry?”
These people must be simply wondering who the hell he is.
Under the table, Harry takes his hand and squeezes shortly before letting go. Draco turns his head to look at him and realises it might be a mistake. Harry’s eyes are so full of love. He looks at Draco with indescribable tenderness, and Draco has no idea how to deal with it.
He only realises he’s shaking when Harry shuffles towards him, tugging at their joint hands in the process. He looks at his skinny fingers trembling in Harry’s grip, trying to stop them from moving on their own accord, but it’s all for nothing. Actually, the more he tries to take control over his body, the worse the shaking becomes.
“Are my questions annoying?”
“Draco.”
Draco looks outside the window. The red brick of the building opposite of his shimmers in the strong midday sunlight. “I don’t suffer.”
” banner on the walls, the big cake on the side of the room with a long table of food and drinks, his family and friends all in the room, his kids standing with Harry’s parents, and especially, Harry right in front of him, Draco’s heart seemed to stop for a second when his husband smiled at him, it felt just like the first time they met again, without the fire of course.
buy this one
“I’m just asking” He said, shrugging his shoulders while his eyes still set on Draco, making him look away, it was awkward “Have you casted a warming charm on?”
“Ready?” Harry asked, earning a nod from Draco. He Apparated them both back to the Grimmauld Place, right in the middle of his bedroom
“You were too” Pansy smacked his arm and poked his chest “You listen to me, Draco Malfoy, you better talk to him tonight or else there won’t be any more chance for you and him to get together”
“I…the beginning of this year” Draco confessed, his hands clutching on Harry’s wrists “I didn’t know how or what to say to you, so I told Pansy to keep it as a secret, I was scared to face you”
their humour were still on point every time “I mean I bought new brooms today. Don’t I get a toast too?”
“You’ll be fine, and no one comes early to a party, it’s common sense” Pansy hooked her arm around his and smiled “Your look is on point, do not worry” Draco nodded and hoped he looked good enough, he was wearing a black mesh button up shirt tucked in his black trousers with a pair of black shoes, the shirt was partly see-through so it was both revealing and discreet in a way, Pansy had even curled his hair so it looked a bit wavy. And
to go”
” Draco bit his lower lip, contemplating the man in front of him, Harry was always a good man, an even better husband “I love you too” Harry showed him a goofy smile and pulled Draco forward, their chests hit each other, his husband looked down at him and he knew Harry was going to kiss him, Draco closed his eyes and waited for it like he was a teenager all over again
“Okay, so bossy” Harry huffed out a breathy laugh, leaning down and placed his lips on Draco’s bare chest. He made love bites from Draco’s neck down to his abdomen, wherever Harry could suck, he’d make sure there’d be marks the next morning, he felt the need to mark Draco up every way possible. The Auror latched quickly on one of Draco’s pink nipples, making the blond gasped and gripped tightly on Harry’s arm. He slid his hand down and held Draco’s hard length. The quicker he stroked Draco, the louder the blond got, Harry slipped down further and as soon as his mouth wrapped around Draco’s heat, the blond arched his back, letting out a loud moan, his hands flew to Harry’s head and grabbed his hair tight.
“Ginny and Luna are bringing their kids to mum, so they’re probably stuck there for a while, since mum always do that” He said, she’d always keep them for an hour or two to give them something to talk. He couldn’t blame her, all her kids have grown up and sometimes she wanted to talk to them “Blaise is on a business trip and he’s supposed to be here an hour ago. I’m so going to kill him” He huffed loudly and folded his arms together, he hated when Blaise didn’t show up on time. On their first date, Blaise arrived thirty minutes late and he received a one hell of a nasty fuss coming from Ron for not respecting him. Ron was in a bad mood that day, he couldn’t help it, but after they got married, Blaise revealed that it was
just kiss” He clarified as Harry laced their fingers together again. He loved it when Harry held his hand, as it fitted perfectly together, he felt safe “We’re boyfriends now, also, you taste like mint. Did you come prepare?”
“Actually, yes, I am” He said and Potter’s face fell, but the Auror composed himself quickly and diverted his eyes
“You’ll be wearing only the robes and nothing inside, the trousers you’re wearing now is fine” He said, handing Neville the robes without looking at him, keeping his eyes on the ground
“Er, did I…bite you?” Harry touched the teeth mark on Draco’s shoulder and wondered it himself. Did he at one point bite Draco when he came?
“Well” Draco chuckled “Save the best for last?”
, they will tag along with me and my wife’s fifth anniversary trip to Hawaii tomorrow,
” Draco groaned in desperation, it has been hours and only a few let him spray on them “I sell none, Marcus came by to check earlier and he gave me a glare, I think I will get fired”
“Wait, stay for a while”
“Alright” He turned around, swatting Harry’s hands away, opening his robes and unbuttoning his shirt “I’ll show you why I didn’t apologise to you, out of all people”
“Why do you think I’m taking care of my skin now, it’s for special occasions only” Theodore said, fanning his face with his hands. When he said special occasion, it would be the chance for him to dress up to kill someone with his charms. After the party, Draco noticed Theodore was visiting the Greenhouse more frequently than before, once he even saw the two of them walking together in the courtyard.
“Really?”
“I get that your pride is huge, you don’t want to confess and be rejected, it would destroy you” Pansy explained exactly what he felt, she knew him a little too well “But if you don’t, you will never know what he feels. Oh, do you want me to ask him?”
” Theo groaned and covered his face with his hands. Draco looked around in the pub and sighed, his life was boring these days, he went to work, he got back home, sometimes he went to pubs with his friends, and that was it, he hasn’t had sex in months, almost a year, and he missed a lot. Unfortunately, since Harry, no guy has ever been able to catch his attention.
“You enjoy making me cry, don’t you?” Draco chuckled between his tears, he took the other ring and put it on Harry’s finger, fitting it perfectly “I promise I will make you happy too” Harry took Draco’s hand to his lips, pressing a kiss on his knuckle as Draco tried to finish his sentence “I hope one day I can say yes to your question, I will undoubtedly be crying again then” Harry wrapped his cold hands in his hands, closing their distance with a kiss. It wasn’t a heated kiss that led to sex, or a quick kiss before they go to work, this kiss was a symbol of their love, a promise kiss that they’d be together, an Unbreakable Vow between them. And even though it was the coldest day of the month, Draco still felt warm in Harry’s arms, and his only.
“Harry, I’m so tired” Draco yawned, covering his mouth with his hand and blinked a few times to look at Harry “What’s wrong? Can we talk about this tomorrow? There were a bunch of Cursebreakers who got hurt during a mission, and we had to heal them, it was so exhausting, Harry”
“Show me? How?”
“Come on, don’t you think I’m charming?”
“Okay” He said, his heart thumping and he tried to gather his courage, he looked at his own parents and began “First, I’m gay. Second, I’m dating Harry, as in Harry Potter. Third, I’m moving in with him” He finished his sentence quickly with his hands balled into fists and his eyes were shut tight. He expected some instant yelling from his father, or his mother dropping her teacup, but it was pure silence around him. Draco opened his eyes slowly to see his father gripping tightly on his knife and fork, but still didn’t look up at him while his mother placed her teacup safely down on the table “Aren’t you mad at me?”
see-through lingerie on at the moment and Draco might have seen some
“Well…then…”
“You’re my everything, Harry, you’re my everything” He repeated himself, pressing a kiss on the wet spot under Harry’s eyes, his chest felt full. He turned to the tombstone and kneeled on the cold snow along with Harry. He breathed in deeply and composed himself first before speaking “I’m sorry I came unprepared, Harry wanted to surprise me”
“Here, you have to chop it” He did it as an example and placed his hand on Goldstein’s, helping him prepare the ingredients “See? Steady hands, alright?”
“Stop, you sap” Draco sniffled quietly but jumped up and wrapped himself around Harry’s body. The Auror took it as a sign and carried his
“Well, I saw Theo and Neville holding hands earlier, so that’s good. And,
“Yes, mam” Theo said while Draco chuckled and nodded
know that you and Harry are going to be great together, I see your history, I also see your chemistry, so what if you guys breakup? Fuck it. Ask yourself, what if you guys got married? And grow old together? Because that’s what I see every time I look at you two. Anyway, just…
Draco mumbled, there was no need to think about this one, he already knew the answer. Draco moaned when Potter pushed him inside the house and pressed him on the wall, closing the door wandlessly as he kept ravishing Draco.
! No” Harry shook his head and stepped forward, Draco took a deep breath when Harry cornered him and put his arms on the walls on either side of Draco’s head “I don’t want you to go home with him” He said, and Draco stilled himself.
it! The bulge!”
He mumbled the words out loud, this was different again.
” Hermione nagged, she was the fastest of them all “We’re almost there”
“You can’t play it like that” Ron whined when Draco asked “If so, I should have changed when Romilda got wrestling with the bloody giant squid”
“Although I don’t know why he chose you” Lucius huffed softly and Narcissa cleared her throat, subtly telling him to stop being grumpy “I can’t do anything about it. But…” He turned his look into death glares and pointed his cane at Harry “If you dare make my son feel unhappy, if you make him cry, if you hurt him, I will do things you cannot imagine, even if it means I’d get my soul sucked out afterwards” He said, and Harry nodded, Lucius was a father after all, he has the rights to be protective of his own son
“Because it’s appropriate, Potter, but you won’t be able to understand that” Draco sighed deeply and stood up “It’s a music lounge, not a night pub”
“Yeah, I want a girl” He said, and Draco thought, a girl would be nice balance for their family
“I love you” Harry kissed him and quickly ran out of their house, Draco settled down back on the couch and breathed out heavily. It’s been years, more than fifteen years they’ve been together, twelve years as a married couple, Draco has gotten used to it, used to the fact that Harry could not always be there for him. He never hated Harry’s job, saving people was always what Harry loved doing, and Draco loved that about him. It was Draco’s 40
“No, but, er, you can just write on my arm” Harry beamed at him and extended his arm. Draco stared at the guy for a second before writing his phone number down on the palm of Harry’s hand
“I just want you and uncle Draco to be together” Rose pouted, leaning on Hermione’s legs and hid her face, she looked guilty. Harry sighed and ruffled her hair, he’d never want to make her feel guilty like that.
“No” Ron smiled, looking down at her before looking at the crowd again “I believe you, they’re going to break the bed tonight”
crush on Draco” Ron turned to him with the widest smile and spun the computer around for Harry to see
“So, you mean Weasley and Granger are finished?”
“Neither will I” He said, waving his hand at the board “Come on, show me what you got”
“I never like him” Rose frowned deeply, folding her arms together “I don’t get to play with uncle Draco anymore because of him” She pouted, Hermione had told him about it, Draco didn’t get to babysit Rose as much as before and always got an excuse, and all of it were about Brandon “I want you with uncle Draco”
“You started it” He said, touching Harry’s cock from outside of his boxers, he was already half hard from all the kissing. Draco rubbed the bulge with more strength, leaning closer to put his mouth on it, licking Harry’s length through his boxers. Harry has his eyes on Draco, his hand at the blonde’s neck, the blond slowly pulled the boxers down, revealing the now hard cock in front of him, leaking precum. Draco grabbed the bottle of Firewhisky on the table nearby them and poured it all over Harry’s cock
” Harry’s voice broke a bit, he cleared his throat and sat straight up “Er, how-how, how did it happen?”
“It’s not good enough” Draco said, sliding the razor up and down his leg “Did you bring my clothes?”
much?” Draco frowned in resentment as he stared at the bottle, it was from this morning’s ride, there was still a little water left in it. Draco opened the lid and pour it into the fire, he never wanted to erase his memory of the jerk more than this moment
it, I think I found the love for horses since then”
“Erm, so, what’s next?” He moved closer so his chest touched Potter’s arm, the Auror looked at him for a few seconds before replying
“You pushed me” Potter shrugged and stepped closer to him
“I have one question to ask you, Harry. Do you love Draco?”
” Draco balled his hands into fist, retreating from the previous position and standing straight up “Sorry, my hands are always cold”
“Who needs that when I can have soft, passionate sex with you,
“Aren’t you a sweet talker?” Draco’s lips formed into a smirk but quickly fell open when Harry slipped his fingers back in Draco’s loosen hole, which was overflowed with Harry’s fluid, he pushed all of it back inside and pulled his hand out. What he didn’t expect was Draco catching his wrist and lifted his hand up in front of his face, his eyes gazing at Harry’s as he poke his tongue out and started licking the cum off of Harry’s finger, the Auror’s eyes widened and his still half hard cock seemed to know what Draco was thinking even faster than his brain, it soon rose up again. Draco licked a stripe of his fingers and swallowed them all in his mouth, his tongue working on cleaning his fingers off, but his eyes were hinting something else.
“Draco, does this guy have a problem with you?” Pansy asked
Ron gaped at them
“Good point”
“Or maybe you can sit on Harry’s lap” Ron chimed in with a devilish smile, making Pansy jumped out of Hermione’s embrace with a beaming smile on her face too. He didn’t know how or when, but at one point Pansy and Ron have become close friends. And that wasn’t even the weird part, it puzzled him more that both of them were the most supportive ones to encourage Harry to make a move on Draco.
She cooed soothingly “I won’t tell a single soul”
“Draco, are you alright?”
“So you are really sorry?” She asked, he figured people would think he was joking at first. But having gone through all of the things for the past weeks, he realised a lot of things, including the fact that he was the biggest arse in Hogwarts, he just wanted to change
“Warming you up” was all Harry could murmur in his ear, a low grumble emerged from his husband’s throat when he nipped on Draco’s neck. He doubted Harry was warming him up based on the bulge under Draco right now.
on the desk in
“Yeah”
“Really? Roger?”
“Oh, nothing” Theo shrugged it off, looking at his bandaged hand, the one he used to punch the mirror. It was two days after the second photoshoot, Colin was
“Yeah, it is” Draco nodded “What are they talking about?” Draco pointed at Potter who was discussing something with Hermione
“Er, what?”
in there” She tilted her head playfully “Uncle Ron said you’re playing poking. Can I play too?” Draco became speechless at their daughter’s question while Harry just started laughing
“Yeah, Hermione told me Harry found you in the Room of Requirement, seemed like you fainted there” Pansy said, finishing everything and finally looked at him “Are you alright?”
“See you tonight” Draco pressed his lips into a smile, preventing himself from being too excited. When Harry finally disappeared, Draco jumped around on the spot and squealed quietly.
“I was just thinking”
“No way”
“Coffee?” Draco said, immediately grabbing Harry’s mug and drinking it himself. It had started three years ago, exactly on the last day of August, Harry remembered because he was panicking on what to buy Hermione for her 21
just save you from the fire” Harry grinned again, and Draco liked it, he really liked it when Harry smiled at him and showed his dimple “Do you want to?” Harry asked again, opening the door to his apartment
“Are you thinking about how hot Harry is?” Hermione startled him with the question and Draco scoffed softly at her. Next to them were Luna and Fleur, indulged in some topic related to magical creatures.
“I just, I was wondering if you want to have dinner tonight? You know, er, my boyfriend’s busy tonight, and I thought maybe you could join me…perhaps we could do a fake proposal to get free dessert again?” Draco said, his voice soft, Harry missed it so much. They haven’t had dinner in weeks, probably a month, Harry stopped caring for a while now “And, er, I sent you a few voicemail things, but I wasn’t sure I did it right, you know me and Muggle contraptions. So you probably didn’t get it anyway, but I, you know, do you want to join me?”
“Sex?”
of the Wizarding World, and it has made all of this harder than it should be. Ever since he woke up, Potter has been receiving thousands of love letters, chocolates, sweets and one even tried to give Potter her hair. Draco should have seen it coming, Potter was far too famous, he wouldn’t even care about Draco’s chocolates.
“Don’t…don’t let the reality in my world affects your feelings, Pansy, I’ve got enough of it with Potter here” He sighed, rubbing circles on her back as the trio got back to the table
” Harry groaned, his hand cupping the nape of Draco’s neck. The blond pulled his mouth away, swiping his wet lips with his hand and slithered back up from under the table, he straddled Harry’s thighs, feeling the Auror’s hard cock poking at the cleft of his arse from outside of his trousers
soothing” Neville scoffed and leaned back on the door of the lift
“I should mark mine then” Harry gave him an evil smile and lunged in, Draco yelped in surprise as Harry attacked him, he laughed so hard that his stomach hurts. This was indeed one of the best fucking day of his life, and he knew, being with Harry, he’d have more days like this in the future, he just…
“Sorry, got a date, with a man, who will remember me if he kisses me” He said and disappeared in a second. He arrived back in his house soon and realised he could have just taken the Floo in the Ministry instead of running like an idiot to the Apparition point. Draco sighed and shook it off, he needed some time alone
“Malfoy has a point” Ron said, and somehow Draco felt kind of proud “You go”
“You are acting strange, Draco” Blaise said without looking at him, he pulled out two quills and parchments softly, making Draco’s eyebrows furrowed
“Hey, you’re here” Potter beamed at him, grabbing a glass of blue drink that the Hufflepuff have made and giving it to Draco “Here, your favourite”
” He exclaimed, startling Luna “No, no, I still got my drink here” He pointed to the glass of Firewhisky and laughed softly “You go, Ginny could be sleeping on the floor right now”
“What are you saying?”
a good reason” Harry said, scratching the nape of his neck before getting a bite of his dish before continuing “I avoided you because…er, I didn’t like Brandon”
“Wha—
“Tell us, Draco”
“I could never get used to this” Draco grunted, it was always a bit dizzy for him when he used Portkeys
“I suppose, are you alright with that?”
“Come on, Theodore, work with me” Draco grunted, throwing Theodore’s arms over Neville’s shoulder as the Gryffindor held him up by his legs “Thank you so much for doing this, I could not really carry him up by myself anyway”
Weasley called out for them from the Hogwarts courtyard, waving his hand at them
“I know they will” Harry said, pressing a kiss on his head, his other arm wrapping Draco close “You’re more loveable than you think” Draco laughed quietly at his words, and noticed Harry was pulling something from his pocket, surprising him even more “Draco”
“I did…well, I cleaned our bodies, I didn’t think…I’m sorry” Harry said, pulling Draco in his arms and kissed his hair
“What are you staring at, Potter? I have a flu” He faked a cough and covered his mouth, Harry stared at him for a few more seconds before he left. The blond stood there, taking one last glance at the mirror before leaving too. The Mirror of Erised has now become the Mirror of Nightmare for him, it was simply unbearable to look at now.
“No, I get it, I will keep my distance from you from now on” Draco shook his head and leaned back on his chair “I’m very understanding, if you want space, I’ll give you space” Draco said and continued eating, Potter didn’t say anything after that. Draco put up a brave face, but inside maybe something in him just…ached a bit, of course Potter has someone else in mind, probably Clearwater, she was pretty close to Potter in the Auror break room recently.
“Really? I forgot the time” Granger turned to her and let out a yawn too, smiling and closing her book. He could never imagine a day where Pansy would be this kind to someone, but now here it was, he wondered if that could happen in his world too
“You won’t” He replied, picking up the concealer “We will have you all nice and charming for this”
left you for an emergency, but why would you lock Brandon in the loo just because he was talking to you? You never do this kind of stuff”
Draco opened his eyes slowly to see complete darkness in front of him. Has he gone blind? He couldn’t see anything, his hands were tied together, and he was in a moving car
“I have a girlfriend to take care of, she can bump into a lot of places while reading, I’ve seen it” Pansy snapped back at him as everyone started leaving after finished eating. Draco looked down, kept his head low and clutched on Pansy’s arm when she stood up “I’ve already reassured Harry a bit that your problem is for you to solve first, then you’ll tell him when you’re ready, but he’s still your boyfriend here, he should know about it”
? Because I
“I don’t see why I have to put up with this” He said, flipping over the pages of his book. Draco could only assume their relationship hasn’t improved yet
horrible”
“What?”
Pansy, Pansy, Pansy, we love her so much!
“I wanna go dance, anyone wanna dance?” Ginny stood up with a frown on her face, Draco slowly put Harry’s cock inside his jeans and zipped it up again
“Yeah, why?” Draco arched his eyebrow. What’s this game Potter playing at right now? He put the freshly peeled shrimp in his mouth and chew it all before speaking “Stop. You should eat too”
“Yeah, he’s getting ready”
“Harry, what’s going on?” He asked, it was weird, all their friends acting like they were in the past
going to leave”
“Oh my god” Pansy gasped with her hands on her chest, Hermione showed her the two silver charm bracelets on her palm with a bright grin
“So I liked you
“I can’t believe you collect articles about me” Harry grinned, showing him the articles in his hands “You like me and you’re obsessed with me”
” Pansy threw her hands in the air and squealed loudly when the sight of the waterfall appeared in front of their eyes “
“Like giving you flowers” Harry said, pushing Draco’s wet hair behind his ear, trailing his fingers down the blond’s jawline “Bringing you on dates, making you meals, say I love you to you every day, and more”
“Oh, come on, even you would know that’s a lie” Pansy kicked his leg teasingly. Draco avoided her eyes and looked at the hallway of the other side instead. He knew it was a lie himself. It’s been five months since they have acted like this…like friends. It scared him, but he knew there was something in the way Potter looked at him. Especially after that night when Potter held his hand for hours, it made his stomach warm.
“Can I…”
“I just don’t want a boyfriend right now, Pansy”
“If he cheats on you because of that, he’s a piece of shit” Ginny shrugged, Draco should have known they’d react like this, none of them liked his
He whimpered, he had to stop sucking to take a deep breath, the pleasure Neville was bringing to him was too much, it was unbearable, his untouched cock was leaking precum on the Auror’s chest
When he thinks he has adjusted to the pain well enough, he straightens up and starts walking in circles, trying to somehow mentally prepare himself for the meeting, to clear his head. Every second of delay means that he’s making the risk of enraging the Dark Lord higher, but he’s not ready. He can’t face Him. He’s not ready.
, and Malfoys don’t show weakness, not like this.
Draco pauses the conversation for a moment. He notices that he interrupted Harry, that he didn’t let him talk—that’s not how he wants it to go. Only after he calms down a little, and only after it’s clear that Harry isn’t going to say anything, Draco speaks again.
“Draco, you’re so clever, and so good—”
“I will always live with conflicted feelings. I will always—” his voice gets stuck in his throat, and he breathes through it, trying to unclog his airways somehow. He still sounds choked when he slowly says, “I will always love you.”
Then, there is the third category, consisting mostly of people who have no connections to him or his family. They look at him with a hint of suspicion, as if he’s a strange animal that they’ve never seen before, captured in a cage he doesn’t belong in. Alternatively, they eye him with gentle curiosity, as if kindly wondering who has let him in here.
He can’t leave the country. He got his job because the Ministry deemed his knowledge useful, and because his counselor stated that the danger of him getting back on the path of the Dark Magic was minimal.
“And you told me that You-Know-Who is dead, and that it’s impossible—”
Harry smiles at Draco from across the table. “Fish is good.” He points at his plate with his fork.
When he’s inside, he casts a quick Vapour Charm on the mirror—an old habit—so that it’s covered in a layer of condensation. Looking at himself is not a good idea, neither right now nor—honestly—ever.
It should be enough, but Draco can’t stop himself from looking at Harry and then at the couch.
Harry closes his eyes. “I didn’t know what that spell was for, really, I told you—”
Weasley appears quite dumbfounded. “Don’t worry. Hermione says I’m not contagious anymore.”
“Sorry I’m interrupting,” he says. “I’m about to go home and was told you were here.” He runs a hand through his hair, looking incredibly awkward and out of place.
Angelique smiles. “How did that go?”
Harry still doesn’t move, so Draco has no problem yanking the photograph out of his hand. He looks at it, for a brief moment, short enough to notice only a few details. Ron stares at Hermione with an expression of slight uncertainty, while Harry’s eyes wander from Draco to the camera, over and over again.
Harry moves his hands down—as if he wants to either grab Draco’s hands or hold him by his wrists—and Draco immediately yanks his hands away.
without really caring what it meant
“No. Not yet.”
“I wasn’t good to you for many, many years.”
“Maybe it didn’t.”
Draco thinks faintly that she shouldn’t be saying that. He thinks that it all shouldn’t be like this—he doesn’t deserve comfort, and he definitely didn’t come here to be comforted. Too little was said today—he only uttered sorry, and it’s not enough to forgive him.
Draco takes it. “I’m sorry for destroying that picture,” he starts.
“Nothing’s wrong. I think something fell into my eye…” Draco rubs at his right eye, trying to appear convincing.
“No.”
Harry says nothing else. Draco stays quiet for as long as he needs to make sure he won’t cry—then he gets up and walks towards Harry’s bedroom.
When they part, Draco sees the familiar desperation in Harry’s expression, in the way he glances from Draco’s lips to his eyes, over and over again. He knows it would be best to stop it now.
“Exactly.” Harry smiles at him. Draco doesn’t like this smile—it’s too cautious. “How did it go?”
“What do you think you could improve in yourself?”
Harry sends him a letter, and a few days later another one. Draco doesn’t answer. He doesn’t feel like he can deal with it right now. He needs some peace of mind, some serenity. He needs to think things through, be more responsible, more careful moving forward.
Harry nods.
He would look so ridiculous.
“I work, you idiot. I spend a lot of time at your place, too.”
, he wants to say, but he stops himself. “I appreciate it, but I’m sure everything you cook is delicious.”
“Yes, please.” Draco offers Harry a smile.
“It’s important. I won’t let you suffer.” Harry looks at him with such intensity that Draco has to look away.
He hesitates for a moment. “Good?”
Draco knows he has to do something. Well, he should have done it at the very beginning, but now, as they’re in the middle of the dinner, it looks like he has to wait. He waits until everyone finishes their meal, and then he waits a bit longer.
Draco, instead of answering, says, “You wanted me dead.”
“How is refusing to talk with me about serious things the right choice?”
Draco doesn’t answer. Harry leans back and closes his eyes.
“I was worried about that. I was worried you would tell me it’s all in my head.”
Harry sighs. “All right. We don’t have to talk about it.”
“Don’t come in,” he says, not looking at Harry, and soon disappears behind the door.
“Open—” he pants. “Open the window.”
Harry inhales deeply. “I see… Draco, I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry I did this to you.”
“I know.”
“It didn’t have much luck,” he says, putting the stone back into Harry’s hand.
Only after a moment he dares to take a deep breath. Then, he grabs his robe from the hanger. He puts it on quickly and lets the light material fall, watching how it swishes and stills around his ankles.
“Good morning,” he mutters.
, stands even though all he wants to do is collapse onto the couch.
“What is it all about, then?”
“Do you want me to have a look?” Harry asks quietly.
Draco’s arm no longer hurts, but he’s still scared it will. He’s terrified that if he pulls up his sleeve, the Dark Mark will look the same it did ten years ago.
“I’m not angry. I don’t know what I’m doing.”
“That’s okay.”
Draco laughs. “I can assure you I’m still plenty annoying.”
Baking doesn’t exactly turn out to be a success. Draco wastes a couple more eggs by either completely smashing them or getting too many shells into the bowl. The sponge comes out of the oven a bit too dry, and the cream they make is too runny, so that the assembled cake looks like a mess.
Draco answers with a similar smile.
Draco gets up. Harry follows suit, this time without trying to help him, without touching him. He keeps his distance.
“I don’t want people to compare me to him.”
The feeling in his chest doesn’t disappear, so he decides to let himself indulge in it. “All right,” he agrees. “Just give me an hour.”
“No, uh, I was alone, I…I wanted to be alone for a bit. I kept flying, trying to search for something, I don’t know what I want to find, but, er, I just feel like I’m missing something” The blond was taken aback again by what Potter said, because it sounded like him. Potter didn’t look at him anymore, his eyes glued on their feet on the floor. Draco held his wand tightly and raised his arm up, pointing it at the Gryffindor’s shoulder.
“No?”
“It’s okay, Poppy, I like it here” He said, calling her by her first name like she had insisted after they have been working together for months now “You can visit the Headmistress, I can stay here to see if anyone needs me”
” Draco let out a lewd moan when Harry pushed in the second finger and began scissoring him, his mouth still sucking on Draco’s shoulder, it would sure create some fucking marks tomorrow, but it would be so worth it. Draco reached to his hard cock but his hand was swatted away gently by Harry
“I want to cherish you forever”
“We’re discussing an important matter to him” Lucius said firmly, his hands holding the cane and staring at Ron suspiciously “About marriage”
“How did that happen exactly?” Hermione sat up straight and cocked her head to the side
“I thought I could help, your father unfortunately is still having an attitude” She said, placing the boxes down on the floor and casting a spell to make them big again “I’m glad you and Harry are done kissing”
” Ginny shrieked loudly “Luna, I can’t believe he lived here and
have sex with him…let me explain, after I saw the girl, Haley, wearing the ring you were supposed to give me, I…I was mad, and then you telling me Brandon was bad news, I was still mostly mad because of Haley, so, er, I did kiss him, I did
Harry growled when his cock touched Draco’s throat, he thrusted up without thinking and grabbed at Draco’s long hair, pushing him down. It reminded him of the night they fucked, Harry was worried he’d break Draco, so much that he pulled out when Draco tried deep throating him, which made Draco smiled and put Harry’s hand on Draco’s head, pushing his own head down back on his cock again and telling Harry it was alright “
” He uttered when Potter was standing behind him with a curious look. It wasn’t weird to see Potter, he has been visiting the hospital wing for more times than Draco could count “What’s wrong now?”
“Really? You mean it?”
“I can’t believe you’ve been mine for more than twenty years” Harry said, holding up Draco’s hand and planting a kiss on his palm “It’s surreal”
“It’s…” Theo took a deep breath and stopped fidgeting with the clothes, he replied without turning back, but he could feel Neville behind him “It’s none of your business” He grunted each word out “Please, just, please go somewhere else, I can’t see you right now”
“How do you know?” He said, his eyes still looking at Potter, who was smiling brightly in a crowd of students, he would notice that smile anywhere
Draco moaned, his elbows resting on a step of the stairs while Harry was behind him, with his tongue twirling inside Draco, opening him up. How did this start?
“Er…”
“Oh, sure, Seamus likes me shiny too” Dean replied with a smug grin and did as he was told, Draco quickly finished his part and patted Dean’s shoulder after he was done
“She gave me this” Draco sniffled, showing him the sweater as Harry wiped his cheeks dry with his warm hands, and Draco leaned into his warm touch like he always did “It’s adorable”
“So, you got horny because I spoke Parseltongue right?”
“We better be hurry then” He smiled, planting a soft kiss on Theo’s sweaty forehead “Maybe we could get back to our house?”
“It’s alright”
“I think I just want to be alone” Draco sighed, but looked at his phone before continuing “But I mean, I still want to talk to you girls”
“What? I am not going to do anything inappropriate”
“I’m not sure—
“Er, sure” Dean replied and walked to Theo’s spot to get his outfit ready. Draco glanced at the corner of the room, Neville was standing there, Ron was patting his back. So, Draco was true, Neville likes Theo back, probably he was just too shy to tell, and like Ron, he was too insecure about Theo, with Theo being fucked by every guy every week.
