I'm barely aware of my sighs through the amazing feeling, especially when he massages in the balm into my back. And find myself hating the moment he finishes because I loved the slight massage. I turn to face him with a grateful smile.
"Oh wow it looks so pretty now! How long does it last?"
D: [really? You- you like me?]
Your wish has been granted. You have been given a chance at redemption and to save those close but at the price of something dear to you. Love is a powerful motivator but it can also be someone's greatest downfall.
I couldn't believe what Draco is telling me while we sit in history of magic class, as professor bins drones on about what ever goblin war was next in our curriculum. I felt shame at knowing a version of myself had been one of the people who thought such biased opinions, even though it technically never happened. I couldn't do anything about that but I would at least try to make a difference this time around so that he wouldn't be faced with as much animosity as last time.
She gasped and hugged me, "oh thank you Draco it looks absolutely beautiful!" I told her the spells I used and and she memorized them easily, as she smiled happily.
"I feel like such a jerk now. I thought you were pretending to be nice this whole time and now I feel like complete rubbish for thinking it."
"Hey guys!"
I had the feeling it might be worried despite not being able to tell from its face. The only clue being its hissing in rapid succession.
"Draco what brings you here?"
Mione being the only one to show her giddiness at the thought of a personalized gift is smiling and bouncing slightly in her steps back to the common room. I smile at that and laugh. Once were sitting and settled, Mione politely excited and the guys nervously fiddling with clothes or their fingers waiting.
"Your right, Draco can get through this, and if he can't he has us. It's just hard to focus knowing he isn't where he should be. Bribing professors with food and sliding smirks at me throughout lessons, or meeting with me at the astronomy tower and talking about different problems in Wizarding society. I feel sad even though I know his absence won't be permanent."
And I was in such a good mood from the progress I'd gotten done so far that I automatically tried to speak on instinct, and unlike every other time sound actually came out.
We all make our way to breakfast and I put aside my anxiety to encourage Harry.
Now that we all knew everything
"I was just feeling off earlier but I'd like to talk to you later in private." I nod my acceptance and that's how Harry and I found ourselves in the dorm by ourselves while everyone else was in the common room. We sat on my bed facing each other and then Harry started talking.
"I'm healed Harry. I came as soon as I was fixed up, didn't want to waste time. What happened?"
I say as Harry nods and patiently waits for me to continue. I bite my lip and think of how I'm going to put this all together.
Was that really the answer? I wasn't sure and by how Draco looked I could tell he didn't know either. He seemed to be in deep thought and almost agreeable to that answer but he was still silent in his reasonings. I decided to keep it in mind and be open to other reasons since at least for now, all that mattered was that we defeated Voldemort's attempt, and survived together.
I clench my teeth at having to walk by another group of girls openly staring at me. I gave up being cheery and polite to them a long time ago after years of them only wanting to shag a war hero. It all started when I dated a girl named Cho Chang after the war was over. As we shared a kiss behind one of the taverns I overheard her group of friends talking loudly about wether or not she had already won the race of sleeping with me. Lets just say that the kiss ended abruptly and was filled with shame and guilt on her end before I left, trust broken. After that incident I have had countless men and women offer to spend the night with me as if it was the most casual thing to ask in the middle of grocery shopping. I quickly closed myself off to the majority of the villagers and only spent time with my family. The Weasley family took me in when I was a child after my parents died only a summer after I was born, and I saw all of them as my real family despite still having Potter as my surname. Molly and Arthur were my mum and dad, and William, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron, and Ginny were my siblings.
By now Peter was trying to leave the cage and wouldn't stop squeaking but I just smirked.
Harry, Neville and Ron where there now. Ron being genius enough to make the trolls club float up and knock him out. We all smiled at each other and Hermione came back with McGonagalle , Severus, and Quirrell in tow. We were each given 10 points after Mione explained what happened and we were told to go to our common room.
I just brought him even closer ruffling his hair and teased him.
"Hello, so you're going to Hogwarts then?" He looks at me and nods yes timidly. I'm not sure if it's just because he's new to the wizarding world or for school. So I give him a faint smile and say, "it's alright you don't have to be nervous, Hogwarts is an amazing school. You'll find some friends really fast, I can tell." His green eyes stare at me and something flickers in his too wide eyes for a moment before he holds out his hand, "my names Harry, would you like to be my friend?" For half a second my heart skips a beat and in the next I give him a sad smile as I shake his hand. "My names Draco , and yes I would like to be friends." He gives me a dazzling smile and his glasses tilt to one side making me chuckle.
I did my best to refuse but I found myself walking through the forest with him next to me in a somber silence. My mind felt numb as I walked without clear thought. All I felt was emptiness at how everything was turning out. I didn't want things to end like this. I wanted to be able to hear how his voice really sounds. Is it soothing? Does it sound like a methodical melody when he laughs or does he give a hearty laugh while throwing his head back in uproarious joy? Does he really like to dance? Or imagine us dancing, by the lake, in the moonlight like in his daydreams from a child? Does he imagine it like I do? Would he be taller than I am or short enough that I could curl up around him.
Harry is smiling like a fool and I smile in victory. Now Harry can live with Sirius instead of his Aunts and uncles. My gaze goes to the professors table and I see how Remus' face changes into desperation and longing. I smile softly knowing what he must be feeling. His eyes lift from the newspaper and catch my eyes. His gaze turns sharp and I look away before swiftly making my way out of the great hall. I decide to skip breakfast and make my way to the quidditch pitch.
Blaise always one for following along goes while keeping to his fake character.
"Please. I don't want to loose you."
"I see. Then you are like me then cousin?" Sirius says and Draco nods with a soft smile.
The sound of Cedrics body hitting the ground only registers as a footnote in my mind as I run over to Draco's side. His breathing is labored and I'm crying as I take in the damage not daring to remove the sword. His scales are soft and delicate not in any way there for protection and I find myself hating the world as I take him in as much as I can.
He cast the counter spells for whatever dark curse made the injury on my sternum, and my once bated breath turned into half choked sobs that wracked my whole body. The gaping ripped up flesh once absolutely grotesque and hideous, knitted back together into it’s original flawless pale canvas. The only hint to what it had once been is the faintest seam of nearly invisible white scar tissue.
D:[Harry?] I turn my head to him in surprise and answer, "yes?"  Making him grin widely.
The memory was so intense but I pushed it to the side and quickly unclasped my cloak to wrap around his body before the light was fully gone, leaving me with a lithe white haired human Draco in my arms. He looked more beautiful than I had ever imagined/remembered as I took him in.
"Well then I'll leave you to get a little more comfortable. I'll be in the tea room. I hope to see you again Mr. Malfoy."
"I know you said we should keep our distance but, we don't have to talk about anything that's going on. I swear I won't ask anything. Just- lets just talk about classes or anything else. I don't think I can go any longer with just saying hello and goodnight to each other. Without you the guys aren't the same....... I'm not the same."
He just waves goodbye with a thin smile and I didn't have time to even protest before they were both gone.
He nods saying, "ohhh I get it. Is it okay if I bring some things then?"
“Over time you will wear the amulet less and less until you are able to maintain a regular level of anxiety. The second item is a crystal with therapeutic aura medicine. You will need to meditate with the crystal every day, as many times as you need during the day. Doing so will make your magical aura become surrounded by healthy waves of healing magic coming from the crystal. The last item is a eucalyptus candle to help you when you meditate. Not necessary but I thought it was a nice touch, works wonders.”
It had been a horrible idea that we would split into groups in search for whatever killed a unicorn, but it happened. So Ron and I faced the Forrest at a slow pace when we saw something disturbing. A figure hunched over a dead unicorn as if it was eating. I thought I was going to hurl the dinner I had just eaten in the next minute, when the figure looked at us. Ron screamed and in any other situation I would have laughed at how girly it sounded, but all I could think of was of the pain in my scar and the thought of,
I let out a breathy exhale as I turned around to see Draco and all I could say was.
"Of course Harry. Now lets get out of here for now. Um, I don't know who that guy is but I'll just levitate him along."
In the morning I woke up to an alarm on my wand telling me to get the hell up or I'd be late. I opened my eyes and saw that Draco left already but had the thoughtfulness to leave a note.
"If you could perchance send notice to my dear cousin Tonk's, that her cousin is wanting to see her for an urgent matter, that would be marvelous."
It's finally the day I leave for hogwarts and I tell the snake today is the day, and that I'll have to hide him and his home for the move. He complies and I place all of my last minute things in my packed trunk with his things. He slithers into my leather satchel and I carry it on my shoulder. I take a look in the mirror to see myself.
"Hello? Is anyone here? My name is Harry and I got lost in the forest. Hello?"
I've gotten maybe a quarter into the giant tomb when my eyes start to droop as I become hyper aware of the fires smell and warmth enveloping me. I try to keep reading but the plush carpet lulls me further into comfort as the soft fluff rubs against my uncovered arms and waist. It isn't long until I'm closing my eyes and beginning to fall asleep when I feel something warm curl around me. I softly blink only to see pearly white scales. I smile, before snuggling in closer to Draco, my head resting on his surprisingly comfortable tale. All I feel is warmth and safety, something I always had to give others but never expected to receive.
I'm trying to get off Blaise while my eyesight blurs and immediately refocuses sharply from the rush of adrenaline sloshing through my veins. I stumble to stand as I hide the left side of my face from view, with my robe, and ignore the screams around me. They could obviously see blood all over Blaise and were in shock from the bright red covering his white uniform shirt. I just rushed out of there with the echos of Hagrid taming the creature and trying to calm down the students while hauling Blaise up from the ground. I could hear Hagrid calling out to me while Neville, Ron, Mione, and Harry were giving chase after me. But I had to hurry up and make it to Sev before my burst of energy left me and I passed out.
I always made sure to sit next to him when I could, and give him food when he forgot in his haste of reading and note taking. It was in those moments I would see his tired eyes shift warmly as an affectionate smile bloomed on his lips. It made my heart skip a beat every time it happened which brought on those rare moments of calm where Draco's shoulders would droop slightly and he relaxed for a few moments.
"Uncle Sev I'm really glad you wanted to keep talking to me even after being sorted into Gryffindor."
He looks so much like James that it hurts but I know that I would do anything for him. We are all each other have left and I'm not going to mess this up a second time, he already grew up once without me it won't happen again. I rub my face and try to organize my thoughts the best I can.
"You will now be known as Sir Zabini knight of Hogwarts!"
"I know Tom, it's why we can talk like this. The only thing I don't know is why you felt the need to do it."
"To be honest I don't know much about what happens these first three years, I basically know what you do. Though you should know that Harry is the one to defeat whatever plans are being made so that's some good news."
Once he tucks the edge expertly snug his hands linger there and he tears up.
embrace.
I look at the others and they nod in agreement. She smirks, and nods.
The scream that ripped from my throat caused Sev's wand hand to tremble slightly but never stop his precise healing movements. I felt shame for causing him to feel guilt and once the spell was over leaving me with an angry red slightly raised crescent moon scar, I apologized.
"Draco this is amazing?! How can you do this?! This is like seventh year stuff! Are you secretly a genius?"
I reach my room locking the door out of habit, then start writing a note for Harry.
"What?" He implores after turning on his side mirroring me.
I turn to Harry and swing an arm around his shoulders, "well Harry it looks like you just became the youngest quidditch player in a century."
"Draco! Are you okay?! Oh no your shoulder, I'll go get Severus."
He asks and I tell him. "I got him that day in Diagon when getting my supplies, but he's actually a present for you."
It's only moments later where we all start laughing that I think to myself, there’s no where else I would rather be. It's moments like these that I feel like everything will be okay. That it's worth any dangers that may come our way. Because they will be with me all the way.
They all had faces of comprehension.
In a few days we would be buying our school supplies and I hoped that this year there wasn't another fight between Lucius and Arthur.
He just smiles, "laugh all you want, but it's so worth it, Draco makes the best food ever! He has like some kind of gift for it or something."
A week later it came in and I was ecstatic at just how perfect it was. It was a hogsmead weekend and so we all went together minus Blaise as it would ruin his whole facade. Neville, Ron, Hermione, Draco and I all went to get butterbeer and enjoyed a nice serving of it as Draco polished a basket of chips with his.
It wasn't until we were in our dorm room beds surrounded by darkness, that I realize I was going to leave hogwarts in a few days time. I frowned at the sadness filling me up but pushed it away to sleep. I could only hope good things would come next year.
I rub his back comfortingly, "don't worry Blaise I'll always be there for you no matter what, I promise. You don't have to be emotionless with me. Emotions don't make you weak, they make you human. They can bring you the most magnificent happiness if you let yourself. Just be yourself with me and I will be myself with you."
"I'll go see if Draco will be coming down this evening. Don't worry Harry I'm sure he will come down. I'll just go up and give him a little push."
I raise my eyebrows filled with disbelief. He can't mean, actually telling me right? I place my quill back to the journal once the ink fades.
And though Harry was either annoyed or worried over me for this whole year I knew this was necessary. I couldn't be close to him in any way in fear of letting potentially important information slip. That could ultimately change the events.
As the weeks continued he was such a main part of my life that I couldn't imagine not having him in it. It made me continue my search for a cure despite the sad affection in Draco's eyes that persisted the closer we got to his birthday. I couldn't handle looking at the resigned glimmer in those wonderful silver eyes the more time passed.
As I thought. It was Blaise. And I was ready, or I thought I was. Apparently I am a bit more dramatic than Blaise, or in other words I made a big show of dragging out any attention I got when it involved Harry. Meanwhile he was steadily rushing forward to Buckbeak and on the fast track to getting injured, due to him being steadfast and not yelling about how easy it must be if Harry succeeded.
- that's all that has been noted on this bond that I know of.~
I keep biting my lip to the point it starts to bleed and I immediately stop, focusing more on the flour, sugar and all of the other ingredients I'm mixing into the mashed potatoes. I just let my raging thoughts go as I begin to put the extremely thick “batter” in the waffle maker. It isn't much longer that Blaise comes into the kitchen with a swagger that only he could have.
I said to one then turned my gaze to the other girl.
I place everything in the bag with the extension charm except the blanket and the wizarding tent, as I plan to go out into the woods to set it up and sleep inside for the rest of the night. I first write out a reply to the mysterious sender and offer the owl the only food I have left. It hoots happily and cuddles into my cheek before cooing and swiftly fluttering away. I smile brightly and go out to set up the tent.
I say out loud and turn around to see something huge slink past the door. I feel my heart jump at the knowledge that whatever just passed by was not a person but an animal. I tip toed softly to the door thinking back to the voice that spoke to me before. It was rough and rumbling despite it being said softly, and no matter how scraggly it sounded at first I could tell there was something delicate underneath. Something soft and smooth trying to fight off the thundering scratchiness.
Draco's POV:
It was only a few minutes until Sev passed by with a slight limp and Harry pointed it out with some concern. It was then that an idea occurred to me. Maybe Uncle Sev was trying to figure out what Quirrell was up to yesterday. Was he figuring it out on his own? I didn't have any knowledge from the last time so I'll just have to figure it out as I go too.
Is the general consensus I'm hearing from the others. I turn to them and just tell them to wait for me. I get exclamations to wait but I dart out of there before I get too held up in explanations.
I watched him run off and everyone began asking me when I was going to make any attempt at getting him. To which I kindly reminded them that I was just me and he was way more amazing. They were not agreeable to my reasons and said that Draco definitely felt the same way much to my skepticism. I just kept it in mind and went back to my rooms when they had to leave, but caught myself giving a lingering look to a shaggy black dog who was hiding behind some buildings.
He asked the dog and the dog itself just licked his hand and went back to eating. So draco just made a hand motion and the fur was instantly clean and smelling of strawberries.
D: [it's just the way it is Harry. Iv'e lived with it for the past what? nine years? I can handle the ones to come. Besides I have Sev to help me this time around.]
"Well lets try to be quiet. It seems he's sleeping." Neville says,
I stand up and lead the others to the great hall since it was dinner time. And though there was still some tension in the group from earlier I held my head high and strode confidently to our usual spot. I just ignored the girls that stared dreamily at me and whispered giggles to their friends. As I sat down Harry grumbled about how weird other girls were being and that seemed to break the tension as Mione's grumpy face became a smile and bubbly laughter. I just sent her a smile and we both laughed.
Harry's brows furrow but Before anything else could be said Tonk's comes in looking confused as all hell. Her wand in hand and I stand up, as do the others. The secretary stands up and gives a slightly smitten smile and says,
Draco shakes his head saying, "mmmmm not really, I don't think it's a wise decision for you to come with us into the chamber, since I do need someone to inform the adults of what were doing. But only after we are gone for thirty minutes of course, we can't let them interfere with our mission. So you up for being the informant?"
-Sirius black who is innocent escapes Azkaban
I snicker at that and Ron just sticks his tongue out at me.
and Mione just says, "His bag. It says R. J. Lupin."
I take in a deep breath and put on an older pair of pants and button up that I know will have to be discarded. I frown at the thought but nonetheless make my way out and prepare for what happens next. I squeeze my eyes shut before entering the drawing room.
I walked into the restroom since I didn't want to leave Hermione vulnerable to the troll that was supposed to show up. As I walk inside I hear her sniffling and I get a bit sad hearing someone I now consider to be a good friend sound hurt. I walk up to her stall and knock softly calling out her name even softer. She takes in a quick breath and opens the stall door , letting me see her glistening eyes and tear drops delicately shimmering on her youthful cheeks and dark lashes.
I bite my lip and nod in defeat.
I hear yelling......... it's, Harry's voice and someone I don't recognize. Oh, I must be in the chamber of secrets then, I think as I look around.
Dobby came in with a pop and quickly took my note somewhat in distress, and with a concerned thank you on my part he winked out of existence once more. I took a shower and stared at my reflection, after wiping the condensation from the reflective surface, for a few moments. I had definitely hit a growth spurt over the summer thanks to being able to eat on a regular basis and I couldn't help but like how I was coming along in my physique.
She looks at them but she's as lost as can be without any other clues to help, so Draco uncorks one and pours some on his hand! The reaction is immediate and begins to burn him.
He mirrors the smile and continues to speak to the snake for a while as all I'm left with is hearing a bunch of slithered words. Harry makes a laughing sound or what I would guess is a laugh and nods along with the amused snake. Harry's bright eyes look at me as the snake slithers to his rightful owner and Harry hugs me tightly while thanking me. I return the hug and tell him I have his tank in my trunk and his food in my bag.
Until his eyes landed on me.
-Dobby is gone for reasons unknown
" I want to go back in time as myself with my memories intact, to fix my mistakes and save my mother. I'll accept any repercussions just let me fix everything and save her." Seconds later I feel myself start to sleep as I float off the ground completely serene and calm. Then darkness.
He answers, "Well if we were on opposite sides I can't imagine we were very friendly with one another.”
Neville just shakes his head. "I bet you could charm anyone you want, and yet right after you get flustered because of what you said. I cant believe it."
She narrows her eyes and looks as though she's about to smack him upside the head, when he guards his face and yells,
I have a godfather who by the sound of it wants to see me so much he breaks out of Wizarding prison! I grin at the thought before grimacing at Petunias shriek for me to make the food, for aunt Marges arrival. Ugh I can't imagine how this day will end.
D:[ oh, okay.]
"Yes, lets!"
I yell to the guys to go on ahead and I'll catch up, but when Crabb and Goyle tried to follow I harden my face to my ice prince mask and say, "stay here and don't follow us". Everyone is completely stunned at my sudden change that I use it to get Blaise and I away.
We're making our way to the kitchens with damp hair and fresh clothes side by side. Once we get there I show Harry where everything is and he surprisingly knew what it all did so I didn't have to explain it. We both decided on making brownies and honey scones. We worked extremely well as a team and moved as if we've been doing this for years. We would talk about anything and everything, and I learned new things about Harry I hadn't ever known. Like how all his clothes aren't actually his, they're hand me downs from his over weight cousin.
I groan, and roll over so my face is smothered in my pillow, at my own thoughts and just hug my pillow to my chest waiting for either sleep or for Draco to get out of the tub. I slip into a peaceful sleep and hope that classes tomorrow aren't terrible.
He says with a sharp smile and Draco gives him a thankful smile. I grin and put an arm around Draco's shoulders, making him lean into me comfortably.
It's finally time for the game and I'm ready. Patiently waiting in the cheering stands with Ron, Neville, and Mione. We had already said our well wishes and good lucks earlier so now we cheer excitedly as gryffindor is called on the pitch. The whole game is filled with funny commentary making me snicker throughout the whole game.
I just caress his hair and repeat my words making him curl towards me unconsciously. I decide I might as well stay here in case he has another nightmare. So I slip in and as always bring him against my chest with a smile blossoming on my face at the comfyness. It was times like these I didn't mind so much that I was starved of touch growing up because it made these moments feel that much better.
Remus' POV:
"I know that you and I weren't friends before, in your past. So that means that when this happened last time you were not the one that was being possessed by the horcrux."
It's close to the end of summer and I've lost count how many times I've taken my pepper up potions, or how many times Sev has to secretly come patch me up. But I know deep in my gut that this is the last time I'm going to be given a "lesson", since I go to hogwarts in a week. I give a grin once I'm all healed. I'm not bothered by any scars I have littered on my body. They're barely visible thanks to having an actual potions mater to fix me. And this time I didn't have very many to get healed just three gashes and some burns that turned to nothing but soft even pale skin. Almost like nothing happened.
He quickly vanishes it and says a spell that makes the burn go away. Much to everyone's horror he simply puts the burning one down and lifts the other one.
I immediately respond. "Oh! thank you so much I'm so sorry to be a bother and just barge into here like some heathen. I promise I will repay your kindness."
He held me tightly and I felt the joy emanating from my chest mixing with my own shock, as he twirled me in the air with a grin gleaming brightly on his face. He set me down after I came to my senses and began to laugh internally with a matching grin. He hugged me tightly once more and I tried my hardest to say something else. And boy did it take all my will power to make it not croak as badly,
"An animagus, is someone who can transform into an animal. But it's really difficult and very few manage it, though James and I managed it. Along with that traitor."
"I have a god father?! Does this mean I can leave the Dursley's?"
"Why are you in Gryffindor? I know you don't act like one I've known you since, well we were toddlers, not well, but enough to know you are Slytherin. What happened?"
"That my friends is Blaise Zabini, Slytherins ice prince, I think I caught his eye and we have a complicated relationship. He isn't bad honest, he's just in a very bad spot and has to pretend to be something he isn't. He's a friend. But no one other than us can know this do you understand, this is very serious and if people find out we're friends it's not going to be pretty. So can you guys keep this a secret please?"
Draco
Draco's face is buried in my chest as his trembling body presses against mine . I can only sooth him by trailing my hand down his back and soft hair while humming a quiet melody. The others are still wide awake watching the scene silently with varying expressions. Seamus in fear, dean in horror, Neville's borderline devastated, and Ron is down right furious. I try not to focus on it and bury my face in his hair, letting the smell of mint sink into my very core as I feel the tracks of tears on my face dry.
By the end of it I'm crying about how useless I am at not being able to help him, all while wrapped in a warm embrace. I just let everything out and was soothed by his affectionate actions. The lull of encouraging words was all I heard, all I felt, as I drifted to sleep. All the while something horrible was happening to the person I held dear to my heart.
Ron and Neville's eyes widen. Harry asks what they are, and I respond.
I smile, "me too."
-inquisitorial squad
Draco grins, "finally he did it."
"I won't let that happen. I'm going to do everything in my power to stop this curse and give you guys your rightful bodies back. I promise. You guys will not be stuck like this forever.... not if I can help it. So don't worry about me leaving because of that. I won't leave until everything is set back to how it should be. You have my word as a knight Draco, everyone here does."
"Oh! Are you gonna tell me?" He asks excitedly.
Sirius grimaces, "I feel for you then. Have they disowned you?"
He gives me a fond look that I could look at all day before asking for a minute. I nod and watch as Draco asks for Dobby to bring a full dinner and a pair of fresh clothes. Dobby grins and comes back with what Draco asked for, and with a thank you from Draco, Dobby leaves. He passes the food over to a surprised but grateful Sirius. I can only give him a warm teasing smile. Draco just blushes softly and with a wave of his hand the pair of clothes become bigger. Then he hands them over to Sirius all folded, socks and briefs and all. He looks at me and says,
I'm not sure if I'm stepping over a line here and if I am I'm sorry. I'm just happy that I finally have a real friend, and I want to make sure you are okay. Please don't feel embarrassed or feel like I'm pitying you in any way, I just want to help. I know that you might not want help and you might get upset or angry with me because of this, but the most important thing to me is that you are happy and healthy. I am the type of person who will do anything to keep those I care about safe and you are now one of those so I will not give up on you ever. So please work with me on this and if you really can't bring yourself to eat the food I make without guilt, then I promise to go to you when I feel I need to or want help. I know you don't get enough food, I don't exactly know why but I don't need to, unless you want to tell me one day. So please eat the food that gets placed in the basket. It's charmed to be connected to a basket in my house so whatever I put in will be sent to yours once I close the basket. Keep the basket and when your done put the empty dishes in and close the top so it will transport them to me. When something arrives the it will make a soft ding so be on the lookout for that.
"Just trust me on this okay? I'll tell you guys why one day but not now. Please just trust me."
He smirks at me and he nods. "Yes I do, and I'll get it for you once you let me go." He said teasing.
-cabinet is fixed
"You look different?"
At the answer Ron wrenched his eyes away from the fighting scene and bellowed a laugh as Harry snickered. Fred and George who were cheering on the fight raised identical brows at all of us but smirked when they came to the conclusion we were, somehow despite all the odds, friends.
He ran his fingers through my hair, "don't apologize. I'm always here for you dragon."
By now his eyes looked tired and his breathing slowed down rapidly making me panic.
He swiftly picks me up bridal style and carries me to his sofa. My shoulder is jostled making me gasp but I keep my pained groans in so as to not worry him too much.
- the ministry gets broken into , to get a prophecy? Not sure.
"Draco, I find myself wanting to confide in you on a certain matter, yet I'm afraid of what your reaction to it will be."
"Alright mister 'I can't help but flirt with every cute person I meet', Harry is off limits." I say pointing at him.
"Woah"
We wish each other a good night and I'm very aware of the contentedness coming from the prefect bathroom where Draco is taking a soak and reading. The other guys chuckled at knowing he was doing it and I just rolled my eyes at them. If it relaxed him then he could do anything he wanted for all I care, except maybe cuddle with someone who isn't me........
Quidditch and food really did wonders especially since now is when guys start to gain more muscles and hormones. I put on a pair of clean jeans with a fond smile when I think back to how Draco bought me this entire wardrobe back in first year. I was thrilled to know that it was magically adjusting to growth spurts so I wouldn't have to buy any new clothes this year. Though for fifth year, I might just have to get more because I have a feeling I'm going to grow taller, or maybe its just hope.
"My Draco, is friends with mister Harry Potter?! Oh my! My name is Daisy Nice to meet you!"
Draco's POV:
He takes the paper back and goes back to writing.
"Why?"
I translated for Draco in their discussions, in between tasks. All while Blaise just sat on the stool chuckling at my bouncing between three things at the same time. He knew all about the subjects but decided to watch me fluster around helping translate and making food instead of help me out in anything. Draco repaid me with thankful glances and sneaking me food we had prepped while working. Which made up for it in my mind, no matter how many times Blaise shot me knowing smirks. The strawberries were my favorite and Draco favored it after finding out how much I liked them.
-third task, the maze, Cedric dies; need to save him
I wiped my brow clean and placed a cloaking charm on it to hide all of the carving and gave a nice long sigh. I had really needed to finish this today since tomorrow is the big day and it made me grateful on how fast I recovered from the last session. I put the cage in my packed trunk and decide to go down to the kitchens and start baking some food for today and tomorrow.
At my sigh he gave me a concerned look and asked if I was feeling alright making me smile in confirmation. He returned it and went back to listening in on a story of a prank Ron, Fred, and George pulled on Ginny last year. I just daydreamed about kissing Draco after giving him his present for a while until I felt a sharp feeling of shock. I quickly turned my head to Draco and if I didnt know any better I would think he was determined to not look at me so I did the only thing I could. I spoke to him through our connection.
All I heard was a whispered, "You'll always have me." As my eyes fluttered closed and I drifted off into a warm sleep, filled with that wonderful holly smell.
His now translucent hand almost caressing my face tenderly despite me not being able to feel anything, and an emotion I never thought would be directed towards me. But was now glaringly obvious by the way his face tried to near my own.
Draco Malfoy,
Draco's POV:
Anything would look wonderful with his green eyes I'm sure. I'm about to turn again when I see a shadow pass over the sky above the shed and I jump to attention when an owl comes, fluttering his fluffy wings right into my arms. He seems to be holding a pretty large package that now that I look closely at, seems to be shrunken. Merlin, it must be huge then. The owl trills and when I untie him of the burden he's been carrying he burrows into my neck. I smile and get joy from the simple action of just being given affection.
"You...... you took her place?" Ron asked and when I nodded again he put his face in his hands.
He turns to me with grief in his eyes and I place a hand on his shoulder.
I nod rapidly, "oh yes thank you professor, I would love to have this opportunity. I do get bored rather easily and helping was surprisingly fun."
"If Harry trusts you then so do I. Besides you came from the future to help us not the other side, so I think that lands you in my good book."
She smiles widely and takes my hand in a way of saying, were cool with each other.
"Where are you little boy?! I feel like having some fresh prey and you'd be perfect! Haha haha The dark lord promised me I could have you if you fail him again, and from the way your going now I can't wait. I will ruin you little Malfoy."
"Harry."
So with those thoughts in mind I sighed and let myself forget about the future and just take in the scent of my shampoo circling around me before getting out and spelling myself dry. I summon my pajamas and change as I charm my mouth clean. I'm so tired I trudge through the room and fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow. It would only be a few hours later before I'd realize my mistake.
It was more breathy and broken than how it should be but I actually managed sound. I was so shocked at it that I froze, but Harry on the other hand came rushing down and practically pounced on me.
He gently scolds me to be careful and not be an idiot when Harry shows up, freaking out with both of the items Sev instructed him to bring.
"No! please Draco, dont leave. Please, please it wasn't supposed to be this way. I was supposed to find a way! You cant- no- Draco........Draco please."
I tie the letter and the shrunken basket to the newly grown owl that hatched this year who I now own as a personal owl, Aristotle. This was his first delivery and he was excited from the way he rubbed against my cheek and puffed his chest out. I affectionately stroked his honey brown feathers mottled with random white and gave his wing a kiss. After that he shot off after I told him to find Harry Potter on a street called Pickett and that it was muggle, not really knowing where exactly he lived. But Aristotle apparently understood so I watched as my Saw-Whet owl flew off. Now all I had left to do was unshrink my supplies and read my cookbooks. I decided that after I knew more on cooking I would start writing everything I knew about the future and remember as much as possible.
-Dumbledoor returns, Umbridge gets arrested for blood quills
"You reopened the wounds so please don't move while I cast a sealing spell. This will scar now since its been reopened, so do be careful with it. It's delicate enough as it is."
I knew I wasn't in any way going to let him feel like he should be ashamed of his appearance and make sure to give him all of my gratitude for treating me so well. I frown as I think about the curse on everyone here. Was there a way to break it? Maybe I could help in some way? I don't want to leave here without at least trying to help them after being treated like this. I was sure only royals were able to experience such luxuries. So after I bathed myself thoroughly I dried off my body and curls before going to the bedroom. Then gently put on the clothes still in awe of the high quality. The shirt was a deep blue silk that paired nicely with the charcoal grey dress pants. I pulled on matching charcoal grey socks and warm brown oxford dress shoes glad to note the lack of tie and vest.
but we're both torn away from each other as a battle cry rips through the air. Harry has slayed the basilisk and was brandishing the Horcrux in his hands several yards away, before locking eyes with Tom and slamming the book down on a basilisk fang.
He was fiddling with his hands and hesitantly looked towards me with an anxious expression on his face. What he said next almost made me fall off of my seat and want nothing more than for the floor to open beneath my feet and swallow me whole.
Professor just lead us to the Gryffindor quidditch captain, "I think I just found you a knew seeker and a chaser, they have exceptional skill, I never would have believed it but it happened right in front of me."
She smiled as she let go of me.
"The next time I have a glass throwing session I'll definitely invite you. I just had to let off some steam and well that was a better alternative than anything I could have self inflicted in some lapse of judgement."
Once I put my hand inside carefully, he coils around my arm snugly and nods. I grin and then peruse the shelves asking him what he would like for me to purchase for him. He flicks his toungue out in thank you after every item especially when I grab dozens of frozen mice for him as food.
It was enough to put me at ease for the first time, that is until early December came and with it another black out. Justin Finch-Fletchy and nearly headless Nick were found petrified.
Harry, Hermione, and Ron looked afraid and worried while the Slytherins were practically cackling with glee. As Harry and I were leaving our friends he looked so anxious I decided to give them a mischevious smile and a wink, which made them confused. I just smirked and followed professor with a bounce in my step knowing I successfully got Harry on the team.
His eyes are pleading for me to comply and though I let myself rush over to him and burrow into his calming scent, I shake my head.
I only said "hello." Out loud and then continued to speak through my Link with Harry to answer her questions. She just said to continue meditation and try to use the amulet less to continue to see progress and practically dismissed us as quickly as possible.
Everyone looks distressed and I feel guilty and upset that they had found out. "I can run, and fast I might add. But I would need a potion to boost my energy if I where to run from one side of Hogwarts to the other."
His hair is spread around him in an endearing way, lips slightly parted, giving an innocent look. I was close enough to see the faint spread of freckles across his nose and it made my heart pound louder at seeing a part of him not many would get the chance to, as I had a suspicion he covered them up. I just let my eyes close and smile at being able to be with him in this moment, instead of alone somewhere in that manor of a prison, cold and uncaring.
"That's amazing! I'm so happy for you! We have to celebrate!"
"Scabbers." We say facing each other with grinning faces.
His eyes were so warm and full of life I became so distracted by them to the point that I hadn't noticed his fingers threading through my curls until our noses were touching. I look at him in question and all he does is smile happily before pressing our lips together. I held him closer and savored the sweet taste of him not caring about anything other than the man in my arms. As we parted he burrowed into me and whispered,
"Um just to be sure, I'm not imagining seeing magic or talking to a living candelabra right? This place is magic? I never knew there was any other kinds of magic other than the battlefield kind. And Miss, Parkinson u-um where is the host? I haven't really been formally introduced and I don't want to be trespassing. Someone left me some clothes but I couldn't see anyone despite a voice telling me I could stay and change."
Tom the owner of the Leaky cauldron would apparently be keeping an eye on me for now and I honestly didn't care. I was given a room key and quickly wrote a letter to Draco telling him what happened. I asked for Dobby since Draco told me to ask for him in emergency situations, and I thought this sudden change could be counted as an emergency. Really, I just wanted to see if I could see him sooner but those were details.
I listened intently to her explanation and felt sadness at how everyone here was given such a horrible thing. I couldn't imagine being turned into anything and living with it for years like Pansy has. I thought back to the Host, Draco, and felt sympathy and anger on his behalf. It saddened me to think he found himself so scary that he hid away from me to not frighten me. I wanted to meet him and thank him in person for the help. It didn't matter what he was turned into on the outside, the inside is what matters.
"I wish them luck in their efforts to try and be Draco's girlfriend in the future"
Now all I need to do is go check it out on my own so as to make sure I'm right. As well as make sure Harry and the others aren't hurt. They are such trouble makers it honestly wouldn't surprise me that they will try to help get rid of the troll. I sigh and think of what spells would be good for facing a troll or what might be useful. Shielding spells definitely, maybe I can use some more domestic spells since no one has ever thought to use those , which is honestly a giant mistake on everyone's part.
He exclaims when the dog jumps up at the name Pettigrew and looks at both of us quickly, before the dog begins changing all of a sudden. Draco pulls me off the bed and gets in front of me with his dominant hand extended at the dog.
Harry who had come over to me grinning happily was so excited at our new agreement that he hugged me. And though I cherish every hug from him I couldn't stop myself from flinching in his arms as they tightly wrapped around me. He immediately noticed and backed off while looking at me in concern. Hesitating he said.
I grin from under my invisibility cloak gifted to me by Dumbledoor if Draco is to be believed, and I feel my heart beat fast. I had taken to going out and wandering the halls at night while Ron and Neville sleep, and Draco is nowhere to be seen. I knew that if I went to the kitchens I would see him and always made my way down there once I finished sneaking around. It wasn't long before my thoughts of finding something new turned to what happened a few months ago. The year felt as though it had gone as fast as it came, and soon it wouldn't be much longer until the train taking me back to Surrey would leave the station with me in it. And even with that thought in mind I couldn't find it in myself to worry about my situation when all my anxiety was for Draco. Ever since that night Draco was never quite the same.
"Is this anywhere near as scary as what Draco sees when he closes his eyes?"
~time skip~
He doesn't sound like a Malfoy at all.
I stare at the letter trying to see if I can get some other clue to the writer. I don't know anyone who's handwriting is this neat or who would do this. D? How peculiar. I say a soft thank you out loud to the person who sent this and the owl trilled once again. I smile wondering if the owner is just as nice and affectionate as their owl. I open the parcel with cold fingers and my eyes widen at the items I see just at the top. Small pieces of parchment name certain items inside with instructions all in the same penmanship as the letter. A wizarding tent, a bag with an undetectable extension charm, sleek filtering water bottles, and several other items for cooking and storing. After taking those out I find literally an entire wardrobe. Robes both casual and dress, shirts of several styles and colors, trousers all in the latest fashion style. I'm absolutely astounded as I reach the shoes and under garments near the end. The socks are designer for goodness sakes. Who ever sent this payed no mind to expenses that's for sure. I found several toiletries and even a self heating blanket at the very end. The only thing left was a small burgundy velvet pouch tied with a leather strap. I open it up after marveling at the feel of the item itself for a minute, to first grab a note.
Now though, well, now I don't care if I live or die.
I just laugh and say, "something like that. We should probably get back to the others now, we don't want them getting suspicious." With that I put a bruising charm on my cheek and I put one on Blaise's right hand knuckles.
He just grabs my head and shakes his own,
"You are a slytherin, playing the system. I want to know more though, more of your thoughts. I never even thought about peace with magical creatures, and I don't want to be blind to these kinds of things. Growing up with narrow minded parents doesn't really help, but somehow you were able to do it. You know for an 11 year old you sound awfully wise......... Hahaha, Maybe you are our only hope in getting awareness and peace, and Potter is the golden boy who made sure we survived to have that peace. I wouldn't doubt it, you're incredibly advanced like some sort of prodigy and wise enough to rival someone Dumbledoors age. I'm sort of envious but I know that I wouldn't be able to handle the consequences of being in the rival house. Not with all the Slytherins against you and your parents punishments. Are you sure you'll be alright?"
He stops and glances to Harry but I shake my head and wave my hand with an air of nonchalance.
He keeps holding me and nods saying, "I'm not leaving."
~I've gone to bake in the kitchens, I'll be back before breakfast.~
"Then there are those that treat house elves horribly, those are mostly very harsh traditional pure blooded families. It isn't right but there's nothing I can do for them right now, but that doesn't mean I won't in a few years once I'm seen as an adult and can influence others to see how cruel it is. I won't let it continue if I can do something about it."
"I went through all of that and I still couldn't save the one person I did everything for. I failed at everything. Keeping her alive, being a Malfoy, resisting orders, being who I should have been, being who I wanted to be."
"Your beautiful."
"You said you knew we weren't friends in my original time line. How did you figure that one out?"
There was a ledge above to block the rain and I took a moment to thank the heavens for any help they gave me, before looking at the huge doors. This place was a literal castle and I was wondering what could have happened for it to be abandoned like this, but I just bit my lip before knocking. I didn't expect an answer really but the door did open, which made me startle a little. I hesitantly looked inside before stepping in and taking off my soaked coat.
"It's a surprise!" I say to the others.
As soon as I get out of the classroom the group ask me why I was asked to stay for transfiguration and potions. So I explained about being an intern for McGonagall and that Snape is my godfather so he wants to meet up later for tea. Everyone was surprised except Harry since he already knew, and Hermione was busy asking about what being an intern would entail. So as everyone was busy eating lunch I was too much on edge from all the noise to really eat so I just nibbled on some apple slices and strawberries.
Sev's face changes and he is both confused and concerned.
"Are you sure that is wise?"
He opens his door in regular fashion, scowl and glare on full "why have you dared to disturb me?!", mode. But as always it melts off his face quickly when his eyes catch mine as he ushers me in.
He gives me a smile and hands me the potions to drink, which I do.
I handed her the potions and we both watched as her poofy hair became silky smooth and her locks glossy as they fell down to her mid back.
He pauses and I can practically hear the smile in his voice.
"make sure you get rid of the flour in your hair!"
"I'm so sorry I forgot about this. I should have remembered, I- I don't know how....."
By some miracle we arrived to a familiar wall of bushes I would forever remember, the ones at the library. It was the only thing between my old life as Harry Potter the war hero, and the only person who saw me for who I was. My old house, and the person I came to see as my actual home. I had always been searching for home thinking it was a place..... but when I fell for Draco I realized home for me was not a place, but a person. A person who I came to realize was fragile despite being trapped in the body of a magnificent dragon.
He holds on tightly before releasing me and I get a hopeful and encouraging , "good luck!" from them as I walk through the flames.
I knew that i most likely looked positively insane and it wasn't until I had thrown mug number six and had lucky number seven clenched in my right hand, ready to come crashing down, did I see a figure in the door way. I stopped mid throw, the mug dangling precariously, to try and analyze the situation I've just landed myself in.
-black breaks into hogwarts
"I know this is pretty out of the blue but, please ask if he is the one who was the secret keeper of the potters, and if he framed Sirius Black would you?"
He tightens his hold on me and I bask in it. I go to classes after this with a skip in my step much to the surprise of everyone.
I wrap my own arms around him and enjoy the warmth as I begin to tell him about what I knew of Next year.
I open my eyes to see a bloodied Sev get hot water along with potions and balms. I give him a smile once he settles next to me, "oh you know I just went on a nice stroll to the third corridor. Nothing too dangerous...... I had to so I don't regret going."
"Harry I want to tell you so much.... I just didn't want you to have to worry about anything an eleven year old shouldn't. I want you to be happy and have fun. To be a kid while I deal with the other things."
I wait patiently watching him, softly smiling, as he diligently works to communicate his no doubt remarkable thought process. Once he's done he looks up at me in anticipation and nerves and I take the parchment lightly to read.
I take in a big breath before continuing.
Once Harry came out he sat down on my bed and both Neville and Ron followed his actions. I was glad to see they had become closer through this whole ordeal even if I was excluded at the moment.
It's almost as if I can hear Regulus' screaming floating up from under the polished floor of my bedroom again. My heart beating loudly and body shivering from being awoken in the dead of night by my little brothers cries. And I knew in my heart it was death eater training. It wasn't a week later I was blasted from the family tree and I ran to the Potters. I couldn't do anything to save him, and in the end no one knows what happened to him........ not even the death eaters.
I give him a grin and a comforting embrace before telling him that we would meet up again at the secret base in two days to catch up, despite our normal hang out being later in the week. He nodded and gave me a parting hug with a thank you before leaving to his common room of snakes. I felt myself become proud of helping a close friend when they needed me and made my way to my house common room in wait of news from Siren. The others found me there soon after and we all spoke to each other in whispers about what happened, and our class assignments, much to Rons distress.
I give him a sharp smile.
"Pansy, you do remember what needs to happen for the curse to break right?" He asks in a resigned manner.
I never knew house elves were so possessive, but it made me feel warm anyways. I asked daisy if the others could keep it a secret that Blaise comes here to help out and learn all about cooking and baking, because he would be in really big trouble if others found out. She nods with determination and puts her hands on her hips.
"A Malfoy?!" Sirius sneered slightly and I couldn't let this whole Malfoy thing start so I hardened my gaze at him and tilted my chin slightly upward. Especially with the way Draco's face became that expressionless mask I knew he used in an effort to make people think he wasn't hurt.
I couldn't help but love having someone to talk to about all of my theories and telling him my findings after testing the experiments. For example my research in looking for a cure for lycanthropy, or how to help vampires walk in the sun. Or How to find a cure for those who had gone insane by torture.
I hug him tightly and I feel his hand come down to smooth my crazy curls in a soothing manner. The others look at the scene with wide eyes and soft smiles. Well Mione and Neville had smiles, Ron was just gobsmacked at what was happening.
Once Sev was satisfied he nodded and carded a hand through my hair before Dobby came in with a pop.
But I quickly sigh, "Now if only Hermione will forgive me when she wakes up."
He nods with sad but determined eyes. "I'll help you with it any time. Do you want me to bandage it for you?"
"Blaise listen there's something really important I need to tell you. I swear to you I'm not lying, I'm telling you this because I trust you and I don't want to lie to you. But please you really can't tell anyone, ever, no matter what. It's no joke, this could literally cause a full fledged war if this gets out."
"Hey guys I'm going to go take care of something and then go have some tea with Severus. So I'll see you in the great hall for lunch yeah?"
I smile at him, "you're such a sweetheart you know that?" Harry just blushes and grins at me.
After a while I begin to come back into full coherency and I realize what's going on. My arms which were motionless by my sides quickly go to hold Harry back, and my breathing picks up from my slow monotone to furiously intense in both panic and the need for reassurance.
I pause from eating some of the amazing cheesy potatoes to put those dark thoughts to rest.
I cast a shield only for it not to appear and I quickly forgo trying to cast it again. Resulting in me running to him and tackling his body to the ground right as the claw was going to strike him. Unfortunately because I wasted time in my failed shield I was hit by the claw instead and it wasn't on my arm like last time but my face.
Through the whole speech I'm traipsing and pacing while waving my hands about as if that could help get my ideas out better only to turn and see Zabini looking so in awe, and it was as if he could finally see that there was so much more to the world, the possibilities in life. He was grinning and had a bright glint in his eyes.
She was paralyzed for a second but looked at me and nodded in determination, probably thinking to get help once out. She made her way to the door trusting me to keep her safe. So when the troll twitched to move towards her I sent a spell that Dobby showed me to move furniture. The troll flew into the wall hard making rubble fly as the trolls spiky club hit me. I hissed in pain as it had clipped my shoulder pretty bad but I just covered it with my robe and faced the troll again.
And in an instant I'm yanked to the fireplace inside a store and we travel by floo back to the mansion.
He sucks in a breath, "did he curse you? It looks like a stinging and bruising curse. It's made the skin very irritated and I'll need to use a soothing balm for this one as well. Oh Draco"
"No Harry I've got it from here, thank you."
I sigh before complying with his request.
I nod my head and he furrows his brows.
I see the glint of his sword and I don't even hesitate in shooting the weapon in my hands. But its too late even with the arrow now sticking out from Cedrics chest, his sword is buried into Draco's underbelly to the hilt.
-Remus is a werewolf ; I should help him with a few things
"Harry potter and Draco Malfoy come with me right now."
So here we were opening the door to the three headed dog that was the cause of Draco's injuries so long ago. Draco nods to Hermione who begins to sing a lullaby her own mum sang to her and the animal gradually dozed off into a deep sleep long enough for us to open the trap door.
"Something horrible happens in the future and I came back to help you and anyone I can from what happens. In a few years a war will break out and I don't even want to talk about the things I've witnessed”
- let each other know their thoughts if they focus hard enough.
I'm lead by Pansy through the mansion and up a stone spiral tower to a bedroom, and find it utterly beautiful. Precious gold is adorning the room as if it were as easily attainable as wall paper. Carved vines and flowers made of gold hung from the ceiling making it look like a priceless forest from a fairytale when taking into account the hand painted forest themed walls. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen and I think Pansy could tell, as she startled me with her laughter. I crack a grin at her clear amusement until she's pulling out even more extravagant clothing items. I'm staring at shimmering silk and satin dress shirts, vests, overcoats, and pressed pants of every style that were each no doubt more expansive than my own home. I shuffle self consciously but Pansy just tuts at me and guides me into the connected marble and gold bathroom. She sets up a bath that smells amazing. All while ordering me to get in before she leaves, calling out that she will leave my dinner clothes on the bed. And that she will and come to get me for dinner to eat with Draco, after running a few errands. I thank her loudly from the bathroom and sigh out in pleasure at the warm water containing essential oils and roses. I let myself soak in the luxurious bath already getting nervous to meet Draco.
I like being with him and though he is concerned he only asked what was going on once, and never tried to pry when I said I couldn't say for fear of changing something. He just nodded and kept me company while ignoring the chaos happening around us.
He had an affronted look at what I had to say and frowned as I continued to retell all of my adventures in getting help from healers because the matron was so biased in treating certain students. In the end I just give a shrug and say.
He pulls me in for another hug  before closing the door and saying.
I felt cold as those words left her mouth. It was like my world was shattering to pieces all over again. I now understood the note, to save my mother, the only happiness and love I had growing up was my price. My eyes stung and my throat was closing but I managed to rasp out, "I'm not hungry can we leave now?" She just looked at me with contempt and turned around, "come along then". I just followed unable to do anything else as my mind felt numb. She walks in front of me as I look at her with longing. Mother is still young and untouched by war, so calm and blissfully unaware of the horror we went through not even a month ago. Even if she doesn't love me I still love her and if it takes her hating me to save her from that pain then it's worth it. With new found resolve I stand up straight and think about what happened during first year and the steps I need to take from here on out. From what I remember the inner death eater circle saying, was that professor Quirrell was somehow a vessel for the dark lord, and he was looking for a special artifact for something. I'll need to write everything down once I get a journal with my supplies so I don't forget anything.I'm brought out of my thoughts as my mother throws floo powder and says Diagon alley, I follow after her. She turns and leads us to Olivanders for my wand.
We're about to enter the great hall when I hear a group of voices I'm intimately familiar with. My old Slytherin group. They were never friends, we were only allies, which made me feel sad and alone last time. Trust. Something that is so simple can be both strong and fragile. Slytherins have grown up thinking trust is a one way street when in reality it goes both ways. We were taught that it's better for the weak and foolish to trust us. But that isn't trust. That people are only valuable if they have something you want or might need later. But that's wrong, not having friends or trust is a lonely road. One that I have no intention of going down again. I give my old group a wistful look until Blaise looks at me and his eyes get this glint in them.
Harry's POV:
I then apply some of the bruising balm on him. I stand and hand him two warm scones , he smirks and gets a house elf to make us the tea. As soon as we're both comfortable and sipping tea in between bites of our pastry I ask him.
Self blame was never a good thing and it was bad enough that Draco had it from his old life, we didn't need anyone else to fall victim to it.
"Alright I think right now we need to just get our stories straight okay?"
"Oh well two years ago I had long hair and used all of those things myself in private. My mother used to love doing the styles and seeing me with it all. But don't worry I
As we waited for the last batch of toast to finish I thought about the quidditch game that was going to happen today. I know something happens before Harry catches the snitch with his mouth, but I don't know what made his broom act up. I kept thinking and it wasn't until I had been making my way through the hallways to the common room that it dawned on me. A hex!
Blaise smiles softly before saying, "Thank you Harry."
I nod as I take in the information and after a few seconds of silence Draco takes a quick glance at me and smiles softly. My cheeks feel a little warmer and I try to distract myself with what he's doing to not do something embarrassing.
Fifth year:
Ron being Ron exclaimed, "bloody hell!"
They all nodded but glanced at each other and looked determined, for what I don't know but it's better than them being upset. We all head back to do our potions homework, with me helping the others out on some things until Its time for my meeting with Sev. Once I see it's time for me to go I tell them that I'm not sure when I'll be back.
Classes pass with ease, especially Sev's and McGonagals classes due to being 'an outstanding student'. Though I think the dessert had played a big part of that. I even snuck two cookies to Sev all while seeing Blaise trying to contain a smile. Sev decided to partner us with Slytherin students and luckily Blaise was assigned my partner. We had a brilliant time making snarky comments to each other and due to my advanced skills in potions we were the first ones done.
Mum ignored how we comforted each other which was a small mercy, as I didn't know how to explain I felt safer with a prisoner than with her. Maybe it was because Luna would scream for the Carrows to stop inflicting pain on me while my mum just stood there silently.
His eyes are wide, lips slightly parted in surprise as he runs his gaze over my face. Almost like he's looking for any discrepancies in my words or feelings and I can feel something light in my chest coming from him.
Everyone nods hesitantly almost unsure but Harry says.
-Dumbledoor dies; I need to disarm him to master the elder wand
We lean against each other and don't leave until our first class is about to start.
I cheer while shaking him. He laughs at my excitement and gets back into our earlier position so I can continue.
I smile and open my arms. Barely a second passes and she's in my arms letting a few tears spill. I just hold her and move my hands in circular motions on her back.
"So have I."
-important artifact is being hunted down
"The journal that Harry destroyed was a horcrux. I've been in possession of it the whole year because I needed the events that happened in my original time line to have happened again this year. I needed the chamber of secrets to be opened again, and for Harry to beat him this year. I know people got petrified and that one of them was Hermione, but I knew that they would be okay. I really do feel terrible about it but I would never let anyone get hurt, I swear."
He gives a somewhat dazed laugh and I start to worry for him, so I carefully sit him down on the bed next to me again.
He was silent before answering.
I take out two galleons and charm them like the DA's communication method. "Alright here take this, it can give and receive messages now, so if we want to talk quickly or meet up in private we just use these. This way we don't get caught like we could by sending notes. All you do is hold it and think of what you want to say and I'll get it. If your on the receiving end of a message it will get warm, so make sure to have it with you at all times."
I'm running and once I'm at the owelry I send Hedwig off and wait. She comes back in five minutes and I grin while thanking her as I rip the catalogue open and search quickly for what I'm looking for. I see them and I say, "yes!"
"As do I Ms. Cohen. Until we meet again."
But when I look around I don't see anyone in the room making me wonder if I really did hear anyone speaking.
But the prince was still naive and hopeful in matters of the heart. He wanted to be in love and could not marry a stranger for the sake of his parents wishes for an heir. He refused the princesses hand in marriage and it sent her in a crazed bout of madness. She placed a powerful dark curse on not only the prince and his parents but his entire kingdom. The kingdom forgot their just and kind rulers now hidden by a magical, life threatening, forest. The king and queen died of terrible sickness and the prince was turned into a monster. His once pale skin became white scales, wide silver doe eyes now angular and reptilian like, his delicate and small body no longer like a humans. He was now a dragon. He spent months curled up in solitude reverently wishing this was all just a nightmare, only barely surviving with the encouragement of his bubbly servants and boisterous friend, Pansy. All those in the castle where turned into living inanimate objects, much to the horror of Pansy who was obsessed with fashion and turned into a candelabra. The prince mourned for his parents, for his people, and any wishes of living happily with a special person. For who could learn to love a beast?
He would get through the door way and curl up in the open space at the front while I wandered the aisles for a bit and then sat down next to him to soak in the small bit of nature. We would talk about anything and everything that we could think of, small things like our favorite foods or funny stories when we were kids. But we would also whisper about the darker times we went through knowing the other would be there to pick us up if we fell into pieces.
Sev's breathing is a tad bit off its normal speed but I can pinpoint the exact moment he comes to accept the possibility of certain things needing to happen, even if I am to experience a life threatening outcome. I put my hand on his forearm in comfort and he gives me a sad smile.
To the point where it grazes his shoulders in fluffy layers but its bloodstained and makes me freak out into checking him over quicker.
"Yes It's not good, the problem is that once they do this,  they become mentally unstable, and so he went from someone.....Tom. That was his name, he went from being Tom to..... Voldemort the insane megalomaniac. From what I understand Tom was driven to this idea of making a horcrux because, when he was growing up it was during a war.”
"Hey don't listen to them Hermione I for one find your hair to be adorably youthful. If the reason your crying is because you don't like it, I can help you with that. But if you don't mind it and you're only upset because they said it then there's is no reason to be upset. They are only saying mean things because they're jealous. Trust me you have such a cute face and you're intelligent. You my fair lady are just too much competition for them."
So we make our way to transfiguration on time and as I pass McGonagall in her cat form I wish her a good morning, before we make our way to some seats together. Harry and I sit in the third row all the way to the left as partners. Neville to my left with another Gryffindor, and Ron and Hermione sit in front of Harry and I. As class begins McGonagall turns back into her human form and everyone gasps and murmurs all while she looks at me with a sparkle in her eye. As the lesson goes on she has us do very simple exercises. Our first lesson was changing the color of a button. I naturally did it with ease and since I was getting bored I changed the button in the sequence of the rainbow one color after the other. McGonagall saw and her eyes lit up from excitement.
And though he didn't say a word It's like I can hear the words being whispered in my mind, though it didn't sound like anyone had said a word. More like the words appeared in my mind but I know with everything in my being that its Draco.
From a friend
"Oh Draco?! I was about to go down, I thought boys couldn't come into the girls side?" I just smile slightly and move into the room as she opens the door more for me.
I roll my eyes at Vernons yelling through the walls of my room as I write my letters to Mione, Ron, Neville and Draco. I sigh both in happiness at the thought of not needing to spend much longer here and dread at how Draco is. I can't help but worry all the time at how he's holding up, while feeling horrible at not being able to help him at all. Especially with how he still manages to send me food through the connected baskets three times a day with snacks as well. He cares about my health and I find myself in a constant battle with my emotions at how his own health could be suffering. Shaking my head, I get back to writing the end of my last letter and beckon Hedwig to deliver my letters for me. I watch her fly smoothly and expertly through the wind, making me smile. Turning to my room I sigh and run my hands through my hair at my boredom. I decide to lay down and go over what Draco told me before the summer in my head with excitement.
"This all happened because of the headmaster not being honest with him and keeping information that he should have been told. I can't do that to him especially when my main goal is to make sure the golden trio have all the help they need."
"Draco, you can rant to me all you want. Trust me I know exactly what it feels like. I know it's not about attention or seeking pity, sometimes you just need someone who knows, who understands. You're so alone for so so long and finally you have someone you connect to, and it's like you're desperate to feel that connection. And we both finally have each other as that connection, so it's okay. I understand you perfectly."
But Harry got my attention, "Draco you need to eat more you've barely eaten since the train."
"Harry, I can walk you know. Though I appreciate the lift honest, now how much do I owe you for the ride?"
"I'll make it out in no time. Don't worry about me, besides your here to help me not do everything for me."
I put on some nice soft socks that are designer much to my amusement, along with some plain White House slippers that are probably super expensive knowing Draco. I made sure to take care of all my things almost to the point of thinking I was wearing hundreds of dollars worth of clothes, and honestly I very well might be. I go to grab a soft pine green knitted jumper, folded neatly, on top of my trunk when a pop goes off again. I give a start and turn around quickly, to watch as Draco stumbles from the action of being Apparated and on the fast track to falling on his face.
I grab my things and head for the shower. It seems that this will be my daily routine. But as I go back into the dorm to drop off my stuff I hear noise from two beds. I pause for a moment but continue to tie my shoes and run my brush through my damp hair. I quietly leave and head down to the kitchens after taking a pepper up potion from the bag.
Everyone was very understanding and volunteered to join him in meditating if he felt it would help, and he agreed quickly. From there we all began to tell Draco of what had been going on before moving on to playing a few games in our common room while he read a book Dobby brought for him. He had to write down what book he wanted and I had to ask Dobby. Even if he was reading he was practically glued to my side and deep down I really liked that he felt safe around me. So I put an arm around him so he'd be more comfortable and played games with my other hand, which he blushed at but curled up into me anyways.
Is the mans answer. His voice hoarse as though he hadn't spoken in a long time.
So I once again had somehow gotten flour in my hair. It definitely had nothing to do with the fact that me and Daisy were flinging flour at each other, none at all. And once it was ready for me to leave I had the pastries all packed and I hugged Daisy farewell. So with that I make my way back to the common room and go to the bathrooms to meet Harry again. Though Neville is here as well, hmmm interesting. Neville laughs once he sees me and Harry looks concerned but humored as well.
I paused. But Harry just blurts it out. "He's scabbers."
Draco sighed with a delighted smile and thanks us for coming to check up on him, making sure that we know he would be getting
“I KNOW Tom. I know better than anyone else how it feels like to fight with everything you have to just touch the rays of sunlight under stone rubble. To desperately try to escape the heavy feeling of death from every corner and forget the pained screams of those just right next to you. But you don't need to use a persons life force, what about an animals? Please, Tom you already have one persons blood on your hands don't make it two."
I risk a look towards him and he's looking at me with wide eyes only to duck his head again in a definite show of bashfulness. The heat on my cheeks builds after he looks up and softly says, "thank you, Harry. That's very kind of you."
"I'm sorry........ please don't feel guilty. I don't know what I would do without you."
I feel my blood rushing to my ears as the scene plays out in front of my eyes. I try to voice out to him to stop but it all happened so fast. All I can see is Draco casting a shield charm.
I thank her with a hug. From there Blaise and I help Daisy make French toast and before we leave I package the eclairs and cookies. Blaise and I eat a few before leaving, agreeing with me about the salt , making me wink at him before he burst out laughing. Blaise took two eclairs and cookies with him and I took the rest for the gryffindors.
"Harry your preaching about prejudice to me? He is the Malfoy here."
I read it over and feel myself smile, "Lets do it."
I just laugh and say, "I'm not the ice prince this time around Blaise you are."
I smile at him and realize I did feel a bit weak so I go to my bag on the table and drink a pepper up. "Don't worry about me I just have anemia. And I think I'm going to eat before we all go to the great hall for breakfast and probably come to the kitchen after dinner to eat. I'll try to eat during lunch in the great hall, but I'm sure that by eating breakfast and dinner I'll get my strength back."
I just ruffle his hair as I say, "Harry I know you and the others see when I flinch and tense up even if you try to ignore it. I just can't handle loud noises, it brings back memories I'd rather forget. I'm sorry you'll never see me relaxed in a hall full of loud cheerful students but I can't do it, I feel vulnerable and I get defensive when I think someone will hurt me. And Blaise knows that."
I go sit on the edge of the bed when I remember I have no shirt on. I put my jumper on quickly and blush a bit at the thought of him seeing me like that.
"I would love to be there with you in reality as well Draco. I can imagine it perfectly."
She turns to look back at me and I can tell by how soft spoken she is about it that Draco's birthday is soon.
I say, "why thank you. It's near impossible to break I'm certain, and as a precaution I have the only key to open it."
Well, I certainly didn't expect to blow her up like a balloon, is what I think as I watch her float away.
I levitate him and Zabini follows me to the infirmary, stubbornly refusing to leave even after threats from Pomfrey. The kid has guts. From what I had seen these two were rivals, but it seems as though that might not really be the case if the loyalty the Slytherin is showing to the Gryffindor is anything to go by.
D:[who were you thinking about? I could........feel your affection for someone?]
As expected I shot up in my bed screaming. I was sweating and trembling from reliving aunt Bella putting me under crucio and then trailing her hands all over me. Whispering about how young and pretty I look and if I wasn't careful she wouldn't be able to resist having fun with me. I hide my face in my hands as I gasp from the pain pulsing in my shoulder from trying to catch my breath. I was so out of it that I didn't notice everyone was awake. I felt a hand on my arm and I jerk back violently yelling.
Both Draco and I realize just who has been Ron's rat this whole time.
I pout but follow his orders. He turns and grabs a potion and balm from the near by counter.
He tells me to show him as he gets a bruising balm from his bag so I pull up my sleeve first. He just narrows his eyes as if he can hurt Lucius just by glaring at it, then very gently rubs some on. After he's done I take off my tie and unbutton my shirt letting him see my bruised shoulder and chest.
"Alright I admit I like him okay?! Just please stop Pansy, he would never like me in that way anyways. I mean look at me I'm not even human! He's so nice and caring already too-but-I-I'm just........ I'm just a weak person trapped in a dragons body Pansy. What on earth could he even like about me? Besides, I doubt he would even like me enough for the curse to break and I'm not going to manipulate him into liking me either."
"Bring it on Draco!"
Hermione's steps faltered and held onto me tighter as if to comfort me.
He climbs onto my bed and places his hands on either side of my face, and i cant bare to do anything much besides staring up into his amazing emerald ones. I don't want to do anything. Feel anything. I just want to stay empty..... but Harry’s face crumbles and he just lays down on top of me pressing down on me in a tight embrace whispering,
I knew he couldn't possibly feel the same way, especially when I'm just 13. I hated the thought of not being able to act on my feelings since he didn't feel the same way, not to mention how much more amazing he is. How could a time traveler ever want to be with me? He's helped me so much already but I can't do anything in return.
After Dumbledoors announcements and warnings of the third floor and forbidden forest the feast began. Everyone enjoyed the food and happy atmosphere but I couldn't help but be disconnected from it all, I would flinch at loud yells, laughter, and fast movements, always reaching for my wand out of reflex. I tried to do my best but everyone noticed anyways. I was extremely happy to note that all five of us were now close friends. All throughout dinner I couldn't bring myself to eat much and nibbled on some mashed potatoes and juice as everyone else ate their fill. After dinner we were all lead to the dorm where the prefects gave us the password, "chocolate frogs". We all got settled and ready for bed, and soon everyone was sleeping soundly as I stay awake thinking of what tomorrow would bring. I knew I would either be getting a howller meaning a reprimand and public embarrassment, or I would get an official Malfoy letter telling me I'm being disowned when morning came. If I get disowned hopefully I can convince uncle Sev to let me stay with him during the summer and I'll have to ask Dobby to bring me the picnic basket as well if he can. I sigh and try to meditate to calm me down and soon find myself slipping into sleep.
Draco's POV :
One who is against pure blood supremacy, so that's okay. The problem, that same Malfoy is being tortured just like my little brother Reg was. Now, Malfoy is important to Harry almost to the point I think he loves him, and that in its self is strange. A thirteen year old knowing what love is and feeling it for someone else romantically.
That black book wasn't in there before........ and just like that I piece it together. It's Ginny! I ignore the fist fight beginning to happen and take my chance now that Lucius is distracted to take it back. Ginny who is watching the scene with giant eyes startles when I get in front of her but I just make sure to put on a charming smile, and quickly grab the book.
it didn't look like English.
"I have a feeling that whatever Hagrid took from the vault at gringots is there because someone is trying to steal it. Someone who needs it desperately, and I..... I think I know who it is. So I went there to investigate and found myself facing a three headed dog, as you can tell by the scratches."
And finally Harry. He's been given the bare minimum all his life and doesn't know how to feel when given things with the thought of kindness and affection. He longs for that but is so afraid of the kindness leaving one day that he tries to protect himself by not asking for anything but tolerance. Well I'm not going anywhere and I'll always stick around for Ron and Neville for as long as they need me.
by the end I’m almost whispering because my words hit just a little to close to home for me and when I look up all I see is a keen sense of knowing in his eyes.
Only for Draco to point at himself and mutter.
Neville nods and continues for me,
And this is what brought me to my problem at the moment. There, by the trees facing outside the window I was looking out of, was Cedric. Iv'e been tailed by him for the past hour through town and I could feel it in my bones that today he was going to do something to me whether I wanted to or not. I looked out the dusty window and the predatory look in his eyes proved that gut feeling. I looked around but no one was this far out where the library was located, and to get back to the bustling part of the village, where my house was, I'd have to walk past him.
"Okay so your dad had a friend group of Sirius black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew. And If Sirius is innocent then it had to be Peter, especially when I saw him in the manor. Yes, okay, one piece of the puzzle is solved."
I immediately look to where he pointed and I see just what's going on. The dementor is getting too close to someone who is on the ground. I run over uncaring of the freezing sensation around me and become horrifyingly aware of the blood curling screams leaving the boy as though he is dying in a grotesque way. I quickly cast my Patronus and the dementor leaves reluctantly. Zabini is now on the ground kneeling next to the boy I now recognize as Malfoy.
I just nod and we spend a few more moments in companionable silence before parting ways.
He frowned at the information and then proceeded to ask for them much to the witch's displeasure. She just plastered on a fake smile and said of course to Harry without so much as an extra glance my way, and gave him the potions with a slightly strained smile. He thanks her while she just nods.
I was close now and I've narrowed it down to four very old somewhat Archaic Latin rituals. Archaic in the sense that its very old and very dangerous, something only pure bloods and some ministry sections would even find out what they were.
I just hug him tighter and bask in the warmth his body is giving off as my eyes become heavy with sleep. I nuzzle my nose close and breath in the smell of holly as I whisper a soft thank you to the boy that was quickly becoming what I cared for more than anything in this world.
As if he had been with me through the battle of Hogwarts himself and he couldn't bare the thought of me being injured after rescuing me from a mountain of blown up stone that was once a tower instead of Blaise.
Still Harry could easily get severely injured or die by either the troll or drinking the wrong potion bottle. This is honestly ridiculous and despite hating the fact that Harry is being trained and manipulated into his role for this war it has to be done. But it doesn't mean I like it and it doesn't mean I'm going to let him do it alone. No I'm going to be there for him until I take my last breath fighting by his side. This world better be prepared because I'm an unstoppable force that is going to aid the one who will destroy that maniac once and for all.
He gives a relived breath and I smirk at him. He raises a perfectly plucked eyebrow on his golden tan skin and I take out a raspberry tart. He gives me a charming smirk and says, "I see today you were feeling raspberry huh? Well I would never resist one of your delicious pastries. Thank you true heir to the ice prince crown."
”Now during this coming summer Sirius is going to break out of Azkaban and come looking for you. In my time line he was never caught after breaking out, which is why I say he was never found innocent........He never got the chance because he was killed in a fight against death eaters two years later."
She started to get excited and super happy the more I spoke and we were both chatting about what we should try first. When we smelled something unpleasant making us cover our noses.
And with some amused cackles she rushes out of the room not waiting to see Draco's reaction. Which is not surprising now that I see him shrink from view across the table.
So I had left in the hours where no one seemed to be awake. In truth I could do this during my baking time but I'd rather not loose those few hours of peace in my otherwise nightmare filled days. So here I am trudging through halls with the destination of the showers in mind, while reflecting back on what I'd been doing not even an hour earlier.
- build a stronger bond between the two people.
It was a great day all in all and I was secretly enjoying being able to know how Draco was feeling constantly. Not to mention the silent chatter we were able to have all throughout our classes with no one knowing was a tad bit exhilarating. I couldn't wait for the order to come in and was looking forward to giving it to Draco when it finally did arrive.
Harry nods once everyone is paying attention and he continues. "My god father Sirius found me at the Leaky cauldron and he's staying there until we clear his name."
" Alright, well Harry there is a such thing as magic being able to do everyday tasks but not many can do it. It's normally only those who were born knowing they had magic and have been taught how to control their magic with their will. The Host is actually my best friend and he.... well, lets just say he had a powerful curse put on him and everyone who was here in the castle. His name is Draco in case you wanted to know, and he...... he is very self conscious of how he looks. He thinks that because he was turned into a monster he is one........ I'm positive the voice you heard was his. You see we were all humans once but when the curse was cast everyone who worked here was turned into objects like yours truly. It's been a nightmare for me, can you believe I used to be a fashion model and now I can't wear anything I used to! It was agony the first year!"
Once Sirius was finished he thanked Draco again and we waited for Sirius to take a long warm shower before talking about the plan. He looked so much better after the warm soak and he was happy which made Draco and I smile.
She gave a small laugh before continuing.
"No wonder your house elves would always request so many of those potions, I thought they were merely clumsy and broke them often, or were kept in a temperature that would make the potion useless much too fast. Now I see. Well then come to me for potions, I'll always have several in stock for you. I'll give you some before you leave to have on you alright? Then just come to me for a restock."
Blaise just sighs in resignation, "is there anything you need me to do then?"
I caress his hair. "Nothing this extreme has happened before. It scares me but it's okay, it's over now. You helped me come back, and that's all that matters. So thank you."
It isn't long before I'm in the shower. Hot steaming water rushing down my slight body. I missed the developed muscles my sixteen year old body had and I knew wishing for a them was futile until at least third year. Even then I had been more willowy and lean than almost every single male. I had resigned myself to being the more delicate type in fifth year when everyone else had the typical muscle physique men were known for.
I wait patiently for him to start with minimal squirming. And after what felt like hours he finally lets out a shaky breath and I can feel his hesitant fingers spreading balm on the scars. His movements light but precise, lining the whip marks as though trailing them from start to end. I close my eyes at the sensation of cool soothingness taking over the fiery itch.
I felt indignant anger on their behalf and wanted to hunt down this woman for being so selfish. How could she condemn so many peoples lives to end. I couldn't stand by and do nothing after knowing this and became overwhelmed with need to help. I was a knight and my duty was to serve and protect everyone in this kingdom. That included everyone here. Especially everyone here, because they've been isolated for so long. So with this, a new energy lit up inside me and I gave a grin to Pansy as I opened the grand doors. I was ready to finally meet Draco, but only see one chair at the elaborate table. I blink at the scene and turn to look at the delicate golden pansy when hearing her give a sigh of resignation.
I hear a soft sniffle and watery laugh from Pansy as she says.
"Hermione your hair is always pretty, and it'll last a month no matter how many times you wash or brush your hair."
I enter the common room and see Mione sitting there waiting for me by the looks of it. She comes over and smiles as I put on a charming smile with a bow. "My fair lady, do you know if the others have awaken from their slumber?"
"You still have your developed magic core don't you?" I grin and just wave my hand for my tea cup, and it flows to my hand.
She answered no and they looked at me.
As I sit down at the great hall table Harry immediately pounces on me and I flinch hard making him hesitate, but he just grazes his fingers over the fake bruise and he gets upset.
But by now my eyes are tearful at the intimate moment I just walked into and couldn't stop the way my heart tugged at the seams. God I really did have a soft spot for those who need help. I bite my lip and softly walk back where I came from for a few feet before making my way to Draco and Pansy a little louder than usual. My shoes are making a Pitter patter sound on the floor and I can clearly hear Draco whisper to Pansy I'm close by as I round the corner.
What I didn't understand was that instead of getting up and leaving me there alone injured on Sev's sofa like I thought he would, he was in my arms in less than two seconds. I held on like he was my life line, hands bunched up in his robe and face hidden in his neck as tears leaked from my eyes. I let myself cry silently with a few sniffles and gasps breaking the quiet.
"Your PTSD isn't just your parents abuse is it? It's from an actual war. You already went through it once and you came back again to help people. Draco why?"
I accepted it and decided to use it as another thing to use for my cover of “being a Malfoy”. No one cared to look deeper or find out why, they just made judgements without proof. And though it made me feel alone and hated, its all I knew.
I knew in that moment he knew.
Out of the first three the third looked the best in matters of success with the least amount of moral misconduct. In other words it was the only one where I didn't need to kill someone or something, only needing to get my hands on some wizard’s/witch’s pureblood, but I couldn't get ahead of myself just yet. Because even if I hated to admit it blood always made it more powerful and gave me a higher level of success. So I began to decode the last ritual until I heard soft footsteps come down the stairs, which made me look up.
"Who was that and why on earth did he hurt you?!" Harry exclaimed all while everyone else just nods wanting to know as well.
"Come on let's go get our robes. Is anyone else up and dressed?"
He nuzzles my cheek at that and I respond, "I'll make sure my friend knows you like these best. Alright anything else you'd like? We've got your tank, some supplies to set up your habitat, food, food bowls, and the charms guide for your tank temperature and humidity spells."
"Draco it's okay. You won't remember everything." Mione says gently while giving my hand a small squeeze.
"Woah, that looks really nice! Wow your really good."
Draco leads me to the library and we pick out a few books on curses he has there before making our way to a couch perched on a giant throw rug in front of the fire place. He easily breaths fire to a few logs placed inside the hearth and in a few seconds there's a roaring fire to help keep us warm. I'm about to sit on the couch when I see Draco lay down on the rug making me follow. I sit criss cross with a small stack of books to my right and Draco to my left. He looks at me in surprise but gives that small quirk of his lips confirming it was a smile. I return the sentiment before propping open one of the books and laying down on my stomach to start my research, content with having his silent company.
I didn't know when it happened but my eyes became watery and I knew from my heart rate I needed to get out of there fast. I quickly excused myself rushing out of the hall, unable to stop until I got to the room of requirement.
"But er Don't worry I have it all planned out! Anyways just a heads up."
“I just want us to live in peace. All of us, not just light and dark wizards but magical creatures as well. They deserve to be able to work and own property, they have needs and feelings just like us. How can they support their family when wizards refuse to hire them? Werewolves only change one day out of the month and if they had money from jobs they could easily afford the wolfsbane potion. It's simple! And vampires they could work the jobs with grave yard hours, the ones no one wants. Everyone is afraid of vampires because they think they will suck people's blood dry but that's totally wrong! They only drink from their mate! This whole thing is a complete mess, we need to help one another not oppress the ones who are struggling. I don't understand, the "light wizard, muggle borns" are oppressed by pure bloods, so you would think they would help magical creatures right? But no they oppress the magical creatures more than pure bloods! If they know how it feels then why would they voluntarily do it themselves? Is it because they don't understand the whole facts and are governed by fear? I don't know.”
I knew it was what he needed most from the grateful looks he gave me. And though I don't expect to ever know what happened in those three days, he told me he would tell me one day. I just nodded and began to tell him about some muggle fantasy stories as we drank hot chocolate with a blanket around us.
Okay so there are more traps along the way to stop those who are looking for it. I want to jump in and try to map out the challenges but my vision is getting a bit worse and my already bad shoulder is soaked with red. So I turn off my lumos and close the door leaving a red hand print. I spell it clean and leave the room quietly, breathing unevenly from the pain and loss of blood.
(Perfect for Ron.)
"I see you are being honest with me and acting pure of heart, now, the only question is where to put you. You have more knowledge than seventh years but I see that is not where you want to be. Definitely you don't want hufflepuff haha okay, so either slytherin or gryffindor . What will you choose Draco Malfoy? Oh that one? Well look forward to a howller."
He held my hand and I didn't feel embarrassed at all. I was immensely overjoyed at the touch of affection and support through this.
"you can't hit a patient!"
I make my way to Sev's quarters slowly not wanting to pass out or pump too much blood in my body. I stumble a bit but I'm able to balance myself just in time before hitting the floor. I'm clutching my shoulder and biting my lip to avoid crying out and I can't help the sob of relief I let out once I'm in front of Sev's room.
Only for me to wake up screaming bloody murder at 4:00 in the morning. Tears stream down my face as I remember watching Fenrir rip people apart on the battle field that was Hogwarts. My clothes are sticking to me as usual and my breathing is ragged.
Oh how I miss harry.
- Fluer and bills wedding gets crashed
"Your welcome", I say back.
"Yeah, seven times. The thing is this kind of magic- to make Horcruxes, well it is really dark. And for him to do it he had to kill someone."
I wonder if Draco felt the same.
It was used centuries before to make sure two people who were engaged weren't fooling around with others during the courting process. There aren't many side effects other than having a better relationship with the other person. The reason why I think it could help is that when this bond is in place, it can link one persons thoughts to the other if one of the two have a powerful magical core. It's also known to transfer faint echos of what one is feeling to the other person.... and well I still have my older selfs magical core. What I'm trying to ask is if you would be okay to do this? I'm not sure how long I won't be able to speak but Harry there is absolutely no pressure at all, I can always just write things down.~
But I smile now that my first mission is done and I can go down to at least say a hello to them. I'm right behind them and laugh at how Harry is once again covered in soot like last time, making them spin around quickly. I tried to hold it in but Lockhart practically dragging Harry to get a picture taken was the last straw.
"Don't worry he has us to help him. We are stronger together so don't loose hope or happiness, because everything will turn out fine. We'll all be stronger by the end of this. So don't loose sight of the friendship between us."
I put my face in my hands and respond.
I just give him a sympathetic look and he turns somewhat green.
I decided to sit while I waited for Pansy to come back, hopefully with the mysterious mansion owner. I felt almost a bit ridiculous at how badly I wanted to help a man I felt I already knew, but hadn't even met yet. But the way Pansy spoke to me about him, made it seem like I did know the man. I could feel the pain that seemed to drown him.... and deep down I thought we weren't all that different. I too wanted to find love. Maybe...... we could both find what we needed in each other. I know that even now I would do anything to help those cursed here become humans again, and maybe I could finally just be seen as Harry. Not war hero Harry Potter.
"Ugh and don't even get me started on Pansy! This girl is an absolute menace with the boys now. She really seems to be looking for someone to sink her claws into and keep forever. I've been at the end of her devious smirks and raised eyebrows at least four times in the past two weeks!”
I look up into Sev’s horrified eyes.
I see Harry holding a sword all while he and siren hiss back and forth to each other, Harry with his eyes closed. I turn my head quickly when I hear a giant slithering sound come from where he is, in an effort to not die from the basilisk. When I do, I see a random student passed out a few feet away from me and a translucent image of a handsome guy becoming more opaque. I furrow my eyebrows slightly before seeing the journal by the handsome boys feet. My eyes widened and I call out to him.
I didn't want to think about it too much otherwise I would get angry at how unfairly he's treated, so I changed the subject to one of my favorite classes. I couldn't wait for it to start after this boring lecture. I was just glad I could have time with Draco in secret during this boring lecture, even if I barely passed this class, because I couldn't get enough of talking to him. It wasn't long before we were walking outside and waiting for Hagrid to come with the new creature we would be learning about ,and interacting with, this time!
That's when I look at the others and say.
I smile happily and hug him carefully so as to not jostle my shoulder, as he runs his hands through my hair. I look at him and ask, "Sev do you happen to have a hair de-frizzing tonic and a shine potion?"
His eyes widen, "wait, for me?"
"Okay, if you promise me that you won't ask about what's going on then it's okay. God, I miss you guys. I don't feel like myself at all without them or you either."
H:[don't worry I've got you now. You'll be alright okay? I'm taking you to Severus' classroom. Not much farther now!]
"Of course I do. And I think its completely possible! So what if your a dragon at the moment, you deserve to find love Draco! I can't .... I don't want my last moments of life to be filled with you being alone and not having been able to love someone. Ever since we were kids I made a promise to help you find someone who makes you happy, and I think Harry is the one. Please just try Draco."
D:[yes] in my head.
So he takes out the candle and lights it up before bringing the crystal out and setting it in between us. We lay down side by side leaving space for only the crystal and begin to calmly relax, almost to the point I was going to be lulled to sleep. It was soothing and a nice warm feeling surrounded me and the bond of Draco inside of me.
"It's sad I know. He was a child making decisions that were desperate and in the end he became something other than the human he was. Though I wish it was different, it isn't and so now we have to stop Voldemort from taking over."
I just laugh. "It's okay Ron. I know everything is a bit too complicated and all over the place. So don't be hard on yourself."
And despite realizing I'm actually following a walking and talking candelabra I do follow her. I feel my mind whirling and decide I might as well ask my questions now rather than go insane thinking I'm imagining everything.
Her face went from stern and heated to absolute shock and mortification. And that by itself made me feel better. Though now Harry was swiftly leading the way to the common room and I dutifully washed up quickly. I waited for Harry somewhat tensely because Ron and Neville were there waiting for us. Apparently, Harry left both of them behind because they were dealing with a fraud Lockhart. Ron was watching my every move, from his bed, unsure where we stood and what was going on at all.
It's always been like this.
I slowly stood up not wanting to frighten it in case it was a baby and ran away. I took a few cautious steps wanting to keep them calm and hopefully get acquainted with it. As soon as I was in front of the dragon I gave a warm smile at how it looked up from the ground with caution. I could tell by how it was somewhat curled up that it was definitely a bit frightened and I couldn't have that. So I placed a gentle hand on its side and started talking softly while petting.
Sirius just looks between us in question,
"How do we know it works?"
"Sev I need to tell you something and it's dangerous. Just what ever you do don't yell at me please and just wait until I'm done......... Okay I- there's no easy way of saying this. I'm from the future. I came back in time to help and save people who died, to save mother."
She surprisingly hugged me and I felt choked up at the feeling of a warm hug from a mum. For a second I looked into her eyes, her own widened and took on a gleam of sad realization. I stood frozen unable to move from the hurt emotions rushing through me at how I never wanted to go on without another hug from a mum. But the touch of a soft hand on my arm from her tore my gaze from her understanding eyes to the ground, and I rushed into the train without so much as a glance back. Even with the sound of her voice calling out my name I ran, and I felt like a coward again. Running was all I could do if I didn't Want to embarrass myself in front of the Weasley matriarch.
He immediately agrees and I grin while closing the curtains with a silencing spell. I cast a cleaning charm for my mouth while I'm at it and lay down on my back, Harry following my lead. I reach for my wand and cast a fire fly charm so that it looks like Christmas lights are hanging around the air. We both grin at the light show and I start a topic that might be deeper than I thought was best but was too curious about.
Harry, Ron and Neville are all showing different levels of anxiety and it makes me acknowledge the reasons for it. Neville, because he's never given anything with the intent of hoping he likes it. Anything his grandma gifts him is a reminder of how incompetent he is or how different he is from his parents. Note to self, get him a wand.
Only it doesn't work!
He says and it makes me look up through my blurring vision that I desperately try to clear so that I wouldn't miss a single moment of him alive.
"Sirius said Pettigrew was an animagus and he could transform into a rat. He saw the picture of your family in Egypt and said he would recognize Peter anywhere, even in his rat form."
Tom returns his gaze to me and he looks utterly betrayed and lost.
Which is how the dour potions professor was gifted the opportunity of having four gryffindors knocking on his door.
"Father, mother this is Harry Potter. Harry this is my father Lucius Malfoy,and my mother Narccissa Malfoy" at Harry's name the hand on me was bruising but I kept a straight face and father turned me around nails digging into me. "Now remember our expectations for you Draco, you may go to the station on your own now." With that he let go of me and I rushed over to Harry who was glaring daggers at my father and for a moment I felt warmth from his actions making me soften. I lead him to the barrier and I hold his arm gently as we quickly go through the barrier since I could tell he was nervous, and I loaded his trunk with mine, so we could get on the train. As we settle down in a compartment we talk about how each other's Summer's were but Harry keeps on fidgeting and looking at my arm. I ask him what's bothering him and he slowly grabs my arm and pushes up my sleeve to reveal a hand print bruise, ohhhh , I forgot about that. He lightly trails his fingers over it and looks at me with sad eyes, I just pull his hand away keeping it in my grasp and smile reassuringly at him. "I'm alright Harry, it doesn't happen often he was just really angry this time." He hugs me and sticks to my side like glue as though to protect me from anything that might hurt me, I just wistfully smile and ruffle his hair earning a laugh from him.
"of course!"
"Oh Draco, can't you see he already likes you! Maybe not a lot but he does. Look I know it might feel impossible but what if Harry really can break the curse?"
The last part was coming and I knew this was the part that made it a grey magical casting. Draco pricks his finger and I do the same on my opposite hand. We both drag the tiny bead of blood on each others palm and then hold our bloody hands together while Draco silently murmurs the words eyes closed. He once again opens his eyes as my signal, and I say the second magic phrase before ending it with,
"I said, It's not my fault Ron is always hungry! And besides you always eat when I offer too. Your growing and need food."
I frown at that before we continue our talk on the vampire potion. The rest of the day I spend it thinking about what he said, and I have a feeling of doubt at that statement. Could Tom do something to actually be a real physical person in his horcrux state? I shrug and go about my days much the same. Baking, going to class, homework, writing to Tom, and experimenting. It's all smoothly going by until one night I find myself blacking out. And when I wake up I have a gut feeling that whatever Tom is trying to do,  it’s starting.
"That despicable man will pay for everything he's done. Draco maybe I can convince him to let you stay with me over the summer. I will try my best I promise. What if you got disowned? I can take you in Draco, you'll be safe."
"Harry......"
"They guard prisoners in Azkaban. They feed on people's happiness, and leave you feeling depressed and full of despair. In rare cases you could relive your worst memories."
Blaise's shoulders seem to fall and he first takes out the dessert from the oven before sitting across from me delicately poised as we always are. But seeing how I seem to be in a melted puddle of distress gets up and sits next to me so that in seconds I'm in his arms. I dig my face into his robes in search of peace for a few minutes, grateful for the calming silence Blaise is giving me.
