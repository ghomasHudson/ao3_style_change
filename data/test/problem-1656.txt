“Alright,” I say, and then, he spins, and with a disgusting squeezing sensation, we’re hurtling through blackness, and landing with a stumble outside a tidy little cottage, complete with picket fence.  Ron touches the rosebushes that are climbing up the porch steps with a fond gesture that looks habitual.
wanted him.  Draco hasn’t acted like a cruel little twat since he was a lot younger, but as he hits his breaking point, he reverts to old habits.
The full moon arrives, and with it, a parchment clutched in the claws of a fairly bedraggled looking owl.  It simply says,
“Oh, you poor dear.  I have just the thing.  Sit, sit.”  She bustles us to a nearby kitchen table, which is covered with papers, and a teapot.  We sit down, and Mrs. Fortesque brings two dishes of ice cream.  “It’s called ‘Cheerful Cherry,’” she says.  “It has a mild cheering potion in it.”
“Of course,” Harry agreed hurriedly.  “You don’t owe me anything.”  For some reason that caused Draco to give him a look somewhere between pained and exasperated.
“That is strange,” Draco concedes.  “You’re their Great Saviour.  I’d expect that you’d have a whole wing of the Ministry cordoned off and full of researchers.”
“Harry.” Draco’s unfocused eyes make their meandering way to his mouth.  With a lurch, he throws himself at Harry, and they’re kissing, until suddenly Draco pulls away with a look of panic and is violently, disgustingly sick over the side of the bed.  With a sigh, Harry vanishes the sick, and casts a slightly more violent cleansing charm than was strictly required on Draco.  “I’m sorry,” Draco whispers unevenly.
I shrug.  “I wouldn’t know.  Is that the only reason you came to see me?  Or were you here to get a kiss before work?”
“Erm, Malfoy, I think that bit’s clean,” Weasley said, and indeed, Draco had been scrubbing the same tile for rather a while.  He gave it three more wipes for good measure, and sat up.
Ron reaches out and I hand him the parchment.  He reads it out loud, which I find, in a detached, shocked way, quite charming.  “Mister Potter.  We had an agreement.  Surely, conduct of this nature is directly opposed to what we agreed to.  I would hate to have to provide you with another lesson to remind you exactly how serious I am.  I’ll expect your owl no later than tonight with an agreement that you’ll be more conscious of the attention you draw to yourself.
Draco has just enough presence of mind to recognize how much Potter has grown up.  He doesn’t sputter, his face doesn’t redden at the abuse the woman is now hurling at him.  He merely blinks at her for a moment, and then, in a calm but quiet voice says, “You don’t know what my parents would think, and you don’t get to tell me your opinion.  Remove yourself, madam, or I’ll floo the Aurors.  Take your filthy words and your disgusting opinions somewhere else.”
“It’s brilliant, Draco.  You’re…” Harry broke off for a moment, lowered his eyes, blushed.  “You’re good.”  Draco felt his smile widen as he basked in Harry’s admiration.  It was sweet torture.
“They’re hypothetical conceptualizations of important mental functions,” Hermione says.  She takes in our blank look and sighs.  “Okay, look.  Imagine that there are three different factors that keep your mind and your behaviour in balance.  The id is an unconscious, impulsive part of your psyche.  It wants what it wants.  It’s all about your basic needs and desires.  If you think about a baby, they’re purely id.”
I wanted to say thanks so much for reading, and for your lovely comments and kudos.  It's really been so wonderful to see that you're enjoying this story as much as I enjoyed reading it.
Kreacher, who nearly wept when he found out that Draco was coming over, appears with two glasses of dark liquid.  “Master Malfoy, Kreacher wishes that he could be welcoming the true Black heir to the Noble and Ancient House of Black, but it is still being an honour to see you here.”
Harry’s smile was tight.  “They don’t all live here full-time.  After you-  well, after…I wasn’t really in a very good place, and Hermione and Ron started staying over to make sure I ate and got out of bed and stuff.  They were happy to get a bit of privacy; The Burrow is worse than here, most of the time.  But, eventually, they had school, and work and stuff, and I was…well I wasn’t really okay.  So, Nev and Hannah moved in too.”
“Your day will come soon,” Draco said.  His eyes met Harry’s, and he scanned anxiously to see what conclusions he could draw of Harry’s emotional state.
Harry did so, and it was a very surprised Hermione who opened her front door to let Crookshanks out some time later, only to find a man sitting on her front step.  Although his back was the to the door, the tousled hair was a dead giveaway.  “Harry?”
Draco wasn’t sure, actually.  He hadn’t left his home in well over a year, aside from flooing to therapy.  His increasing need for isolation had been what had prompted Paul to finally break up with him.  Since he’d moved out, the idea of being beyond his wards had horrified Draco.  Still, it was the Manor, and despite the figurative ghosts that now haunted it, it felt like home.  His Mother was there, and familiar elves, who would do whatever Draco needed to keep them all safe.  “Let’s go,” he said decisively.  “Go and clean up, get dressed, and we’ll leave when you’re ready.”
“Excuse me, Potter.  I have to go.”  Draco pushes past him, ignoring how firm Harry’s thighs are as Draco scoots across them.  He shouts a quick goodbye, ignoring Blaise’s always-laughing eyes as he raises an eyebrow.  He apparates home, ignoring the visions of Harry sweetly kissing Dennis Creevey that he can’t get out of his mind.  He stands on his balcony until his hands are numb, enumerating all of the reasons why he doesn’t deserve someone like Harry Potter.
“No, I can’t, not if Scorpius is so unstable.  He’s going to be devastated.  He’s been so looking forward to it.”  He placed his hands over his eyes, looking uncharacteristically vulnerable.  “God, I’m really cocking this parenting thing up, aren’t I?”
“Honestly, I’m not sure.  Not to be rude, but I didn’t actually ask for you to be here.  Luna just dropped you here.  I could send you back.”
“It’s nothing more than hard work, and a bit of luck, I suppose.  Mental health isn’t always the same as physical health.  You can’t predict how quickly or slowly someone’s symptoms change, or if they will at all.  I’ve done a lot of things that I didn’t expect I would over the last while, and I’ve come a long way.  I imagine I’ll always have the odd intrusive thought, and be prone to some compulsions under stress, but they’re much easier to overcome right now.”
Because Thursday's chapter was a little short, and this one isn't much longer, I'm posting a little Saturday morning bonus.  Make sure you haven't missed one, because I think the story would get a bit confusing without them in order!  Thanks, as always, for reading, kudo-ing and commenting.
“No.  No, Ron.  It was all me.  I just…Even though it was a big surprise, I was so excited when I learned I was going to have a baby.  It felt like a miracle, and I was scared, absolutely terrified about becoming a Dad, but I knew that if someone made me feel like a freak, that it would break my heart.”
Draco, on the other hand, had been far more cautious about any public attention.  At first, Harry had been easily contented by Draco’s protests of, “Don’t you see, I want something that nobody knows about, something that’s just for me.”
Much had changed since that day.  Draco had focused on taking care of Cass.  They flew a lot, and played chess, and the two of them had become a fixture within Diagon Alley, spending hours poring over books in Flourish and Blotts, and animatedly discussing Quidditch over ice cream at Fortesque’s.  If Draco hadn’t already been entranced by this child, the time spent together had finished the job.  She was so like Harry, loving wholeheartedly, and when her eyes lit up with passion over whatever subject had recently captured her interest, it was almost an embodiment of her Dad.  But, Draco saw many of his own traits in the little girl.  She had an innate ability to read a situation, and turn it to her advantage.  She was quick-witted, and her dry sense of humour delighted Draco.
“Your co-parent explained that there have been some changes lately.  It’s okay for you to avoid making any final decisions on that until you feel a little less hopeless.  For now, it’s enough to know that Cass is safe, and very much loved, as are you.”  He must have made a face, because Miriam laughed.  “Oh, Harry, don’t doubt that you’re well-loved.  I’ve had messages from five separate members of the Weasley family this morning alone, as well as a floo call from Minerva McGonagall, and Draco and Cass have spoken to me several times each day since you arrived.  I’ve also spoken to a Ms. Lovegood and a Mister Longbottom, who also send their love.”
Draco cast a wild look at Hermione, who was staring back, equally baffled.  “Kidnapped?  Harry, nobody kidnapped you.”
“Well,” Draco said.  “let’s see what the toxicology potions tell us.”  As part of his consultancy with the DMLE, Draco had developed a screening potion that scanned for common hallucinogens.  He’d added Harry’s blood to the potion earlier, and had been simmering it all afternoon.  Ladling some into a clear vial, he compared the colour of the potion to the laminated chart he had posted on the wall.  It didn’t match any of them.  “Well, he’s negative for Gillyweed, Angel’s Kiss, Euphoria, Devil’s throat and Sundance,” Draco said, reading off the list.  “I hadn’t thought to test him for a love potion, but, unless there’s a new strain of hallucinogen, I think your theory has merit.”
Was it a kindness to try to make amends, when you don’t know if you’d do it any differently if you had the chance?  This, it seemed, was the crux of the matter.  At the time, Draco couldn’t have turned his back on his family.  If he had been asked now to choose, between a partner and his parents’ honour, he would grapple with the issue, but he liked to think that he wouldn’t have capitulated so readily.  The definition of family changed, over time, he realized, and his responsibilities were different now.
“No, you idiot.  I know where he is.  And everything isn’t okay, actually.  He’ll kill me when he finds out I’m here, but there’s nobody else who will help us.”
should know, damnit.  Especially since they apparently died trying to protect me.  If nothing else, they look happy.  The woman has a sparkle in her eyes that suggests that there’s more to her than her wholesome good looks suggest.  The man appears to be a cocky shit, but there’s a warmth in his smile that makes me wish to know him.  I leaf through the pages.  There’s a ripped photo of a baby that must be me, followed by the legs of a man, as I ride a broomstick through the frame.  There’s another picture of the hot godfather again, surrounded by a bunch of other people.  I pick my parents out, but can’t place anyone else.
“No!  No, I don’t think that you’d try to hurt me," Harry hurried to explain.  "But how long would it have lasted, Draco?  You have your parents, and you got engaged right away, and you and Astoria would have known how to raise a child in a traditional wizarding home.  How long would we have managed to share her back and forth before it just made more sense for you to take her full time?  How long before you, or your Mother, or Astoria would kindly take me aside and tell me how much better it would be for Cass not to have the confusion of two homes?  How long before the poison of being famous Harry Potter's child would have made it a burden to be associated with me?”  Harry put his head in his hands and mumbled, “I just wanted a chance to experience what a family could be like.  I know that makes me selfish.”
They found a subtle spot behind the rink to apparate and before long they were in Draco’s condo.  He threw his hockey bag in the closet; he’d deal with that later.  “Beer?” he asked
Pansy led him down a dark hall, and Draco swore it felt familiar.  They were about to go down some stairs when a familiar voice said, “Draco”.  Draco turned to find Blaise standing at the other end of the hall.
I throw my hands up in the air.  “It’s not about that, okay?  I don’t know why I was an asshole to your classmates, and I don’t know why I cared about them just before I lost my memory.  I don’t want to be involved in any of this!  I have no idea why I walked to my death like an idiot, and I don’t know why I was throwing myself in the path of murderous assholes.  I want nothing to do with the fucking Ministry of Magic.  I want to work at an ice cream shop, and I want to shag you, and I maybe want to go build a cabin in the woods, and I want to be fucking
“True,” he acknowledges, “and yet it’s the most widely read publication in our community.  Accurate or not, the general public will accept what they say without question.”
He doesn’t say anything, and I finally nudge him with my foot.  “Do you think my personality is missing its
He looked up into Greg’s earnest, scowling face.  “I’m not sure, Greg, but I have an awful feeling that it didn’t go well.”
Hearing Lara say his thoughts out loud was a jarring experience.  It made them seem all at once ridiculous and also somehow more real.  “I never said I was attracted to Harry.”
“Choices are everything,” Scorpius agreed, and Harry suspected that this was something that was repeated often between them.
“Been flying all morning.  Tryouts for the Harpies soon,” she says.  I assume she means Quidditch, which, I’m told, is brilliant.
don’t forget everything that’s happened between us.  In the meantime, though, I’d really, really like to kiss you properly.  May I?”
And so we do.  Ron and Hermione, still clutching her beaded handbag in one hand and her wand in the other.  Pansy, her face fierce beneath her hooded cloak.  And Draco, clutching me tightly as he side-alongs me.  I consider protesting that I can do this on my own, especially in light of the fact that he’s down a third of magic, but the panicked, pained look in his eyes convinces me otherwise.  Nobody’s bothered to tell me what can go happen if an apparation goes wrong.  How bad could it be?  It turns out not to matter, because the trip goes fine, even if I stagger around trying not to vomit afterwards.
“Um, yes,” Harry said.  “Narcissa, I’d like for you to meet Cass.  Cassiopeia Narcissa.  Cass, this is your-”
Harry took her hand.  “Come here for a sec.” He led her over to a quieter corner and kneeled down in front of her, looking up into her face.  Draco made half-hearted conversation with Astoria and Scorpius, but watched closely.  Cass was nodding, and Harry spoke earnestly.  He smoothed down the front of her robes, and then stood, and pulled her close.  He said something else, and she laughed, and nodded her head.  They began to walk back to where Draco was waiting, but she stopped, and then threw her arms around Harry again.  Their last hug was short, but fierce.
“Alright.” Harry looked pleased.  They apparated to the Leaky, and it was…nice.  Awkward as hell, of course.  But Harry was funny.  And yes, he was still the honourable Gryffindor who couldn’t be catty if his life depended on it.  But he was smarter than he’d seemed.  And, despite everything, he was so fucking hopeful. As though this fresh start were all that was needed for the Wizarding World to put aside old grudges and start anew.  Draco supposed that dying and coming back to life would do that to a bloke.  But somehow, listening to Harry talk about his hopes for the future, the ale sloshing out of his pint glass as he gestured, Draco could see why the world followed his lead.  He wasn’t arrogant, as Draco had once thought.  In fact, when people came and gushed over him, he turned crimson and became nearly inarticulate.  But he had a special kind of magnetism, and Draco felt that, even though he personally didn’t have any hope for the future, he might be able to borrow some of Harry’s to tide him over.
“I’m not sure,” Harry said honestly.  “I don’t feel like I’m crawling out of my own skin anymore.  I guess that’s something.”
Taking a quick look at his surroundings, Harry freed the huddled trio from the enchantment.  “Hello,” he said gently, as they regained awareness.  “My name is Harry.  I’ve been asked to come and sort out what happened.”
“Whose fault is it that I’m a stranger?” Draco glared at Harry, who closed his eyes and tried to breathe.
Draco puts a hand on my cheek.  “I’m probably not the best person to advise you on this, you realize.”
I lay him onto the bed, gently, and ruck his jumper up over his ribs, revealing a taut, flat stomach, with just a smattering of dark blond hair leading to his waistband.  I pepper gentle, open mouthed kisses on his ribs, plunge my tongue into his belly button, push his jumper up higher and suck one of his pink nipples.  My tongue dances across his clavicle, and, desperate for better access to more skin, I pull his jumper up, over his head.  Draco’s arms lift above him and he helps me to remove his shirt.  For a moment, I simply kneel beside him, looking at his pale, beautiful torso laid out for me like a feast.  “You’re exquisite,” I whisper, and he shudders, his wide grey eyes locked to mine.
It was only later, when he was standing by the lake at Hogwarts that Harry realized.  He hadn’t even told Draco about the baby.  For a moment, he had been suffused with hope.  Maybe if he told Draco, it would change everything.  He would change his mind, realize that he and Harry
Draco felt his face fall before he hastily erected the mask that he’d been taught before he’d emerged from toddlerhood.  He attempted to produce a decent sneer, only to find that he couldn’t.  He was exhausted, and he just wanted to leave.
“He was,” Draco agrees.  “But empathy, or loyalty…not so much.  He killed Severus Snape, who he believed was completely loyal, to win a wand.  He didn’t regret it in the slightest.”
coming to my cabin in the woods. His pace slows, and eventually, he slips out, dragging himself to my side and wrapping his arms around me.  I turn to face him, kiss his lips.
Now though, he had pride at stake, and picturing Draco’s outraged face wasn’t making things any easier.  Despite his efforts to subdue his mirth, the giggles bubbled up inside him, and he was unable to suppress a little snort, which fed his panic and before he knew it, he was shaking with silent laughter.  The absurdity of the situation made everything funnier.  Tears rolled onto the pillow, and he gasped, and shook, and giggled until suddenly Draco snapped, “Oh for fuck’s sake, what’s so funny?  Lumos.”
“Forgive me, Aunt, but I’m not certain I understand why this is your concern?  And why wouldn’t you voice those concerns to Harry, not me?”
“You’re a fool,” Wendell remarks.  “Do you really think that this isn’t sanctioned by the Wizengamot?  By the Minister?  I’m simply taking care of a lingering problem that the Ministry doesn’t want to face.”
“Everybody else sees something I’m not.  The Chosen One, the paragon of…I dunno, righteousness or something.  You always saw me exactly how I am.  I…I have to go now.”  Harry had been dangerously close to tears, and he was desperate to leave before they fell.
“Draco, I never thought you were a coward, but how dare you?  At least be honest about this.  You just left.  Andromeda didn’t say a thing.  She didn’t know anything.”  Harry’s voice wasn’t angry, just desolate.
“Good.  That’s important.  Now, should we go inside and see whether your Mummy has ruined the cooking?”
“Potter,” Pansy’s voice was friendly, and something about her tone made Harry feel a touch unsettled.  Pansy didn’t really
It was several hours later that Greg had floo called.  He looked shaken and exhausted.  “What’s going on?” Draco had demanded.
Draco heard a pained noise escape him, and he frantically tried to reassemble his facial expression.  It didn’t matter though, because Harry was looking down at Hank as though the secrets of the universe were buried within his fur.
“We’d use a pensieve.  It’s a magical device that allows someone to experience memories.  You’d pour the liquid memories into the basin, and then plunge your face inside.”
I read it more closely.  “‘Saviour seduced by Sinner’?  I’ll give them points for alliteration, but it’s a bit hyperbolic.”
Harry looked at the elf, complex emotions crossing his face.  He looked as though he was about to say something once or twice, but eventually just shrugged helplessly.
They get spectacularly pissed, dancing to David Bowie records that Sirius left behind.  As the night winds to a close, and they create a little nest on the couch, with blankets, and a bucket just in case, Harry whispers to her “I loved him.”
anywhere else, other than Ron and Hermione’s, and I assume they’re at work.  As I stroll down the street, there’s a bit of fuss, people clamouring and coming up to me and whatnot.  I smile, and shake a few hands, pleasantly refuse to sign anything, and soon enough, the crowd dissipates.  There’s a big bookshop, and that consumes an hour.  The saleslady is kind enough to shrink my books for me, and I place the tiny bag in my pocket, wondering how I’ll get them big again.  It’s still better than having my arms full.
“Yes, Aunt Bellatrix seemed to enjoy other pastimes,” Draco said carefully.  Torture, for one, his mind supplied helpfully.
“I got an email from him yesterday, saying as much.  He needs some time, he said.  He asked me to keep an eye out for you.”
Draco’s voice was stilted, in that formal tone he adopted when he felt that he was in the right.  Harry pictured the look on his face as they lay quietly in the dark.  Despite the fact that he’d mellowed since the war had ended, Draco was still awfully proper, and insisted on adherence to manners, and tradition, and order.  Harry thought of the angled lines of his face, and how he adopted a look that was eerily similar to his Mother’s, any time Harry took things a little too casually.
I laugh.  I like this one, even if something’s telling me not to turn my back on him for long.  “Considering I’ve a sum total of three days worth of information in my head, it’ll be a short catchup.”
Despite the lack of conversation, caring for a concussed snake takes up a surprising amount of time, and so Harry’s tired when he climbs the stairs and crawls into his bed.  It’s a different bed than the one he shared with Draco, and it feels lonely and impersonal.  Harry sighs as he snuggles beneath the duvet.
“Yeah.  I should have warned you that you’re constantly getting papped, but I sort of thought that you’d stay out of trouble.”
Harry laughed, and it was so joyful that Draco’s heart leapt.  He hadn’t heard Harry laugh like that since he’d been a baby.  “You got that, huh?  I honestly don’t know what possessed me to send that.  I was rummaging around an antique store in Brighton, and I saw it, and it made me laugh, and I was missing you, so I just sent it out to see what you would do.”
His chin rises for a moment, and I think he’s going to say something haughty, but instead he buries his face back into my neck, and says, “I fancied you something rotten, Harry Potter.”
“Is it really?” Draco asked, his brain short-circuiting as he tried to connect the plump infant with the strapping Auror who had just destroyed his lab.
Some time later, quite some time, if his wrinkled fingertips were any indication, he looked up to see Harry standing quietly at the counter beside him.  He was very still, and was watching as Draco cleaned the cup, over and over.  Embarrassed by the audience to his ritual, Draco put the cup down.  “Sorry,” he said, “got a little carried away.”
Draco is sleeping next to me, and purple smudges underneath his lashes suggest he’s been sleeping poorly.  Careful not to disturb him, I edge out from under the covers, and perch on the windowsill.  Alone, and coherent, I survey myself.  My memories seem to have slotted themselves back into order.  I remember a dusty cupboard, ‘You’re a wizard, Harry’, Phoenix, and basilisk, and Sectumsempra, and a skinny ex-convict, and a lonely walk through a forest, and a train station.  I remember how fighting a troll means best friends, and that bossiness can mean care, and jealousy can mean being valued.
They managed, well enough, during the day.  Harry remained fairly quiet, but answered when spoken to, and played a few rounds of Exploding Snap with Ron.  He didn’t seem to like the way the cards exploded, and he seemed to shrink into himself a little when Ron’s voice got loud, but it was fine.
How had this all gone so wrong?  “You’ll thank me someday, Harry.  I’d be terrible for you.  I’m not the easiest person to be around.”
Harry was suddenly reminded of a time, long ago when Mrs. Figg had been busy, and the Dursley’s couldn’t find anyone to watch Harry while they went to church, so he’d been dragged along, and warned of certain death if he didn’t behave.  It had all gone fine until he’d sneezed.  The way that Vernon and Petunia had whipped their heads around in unison and glared at him had struck him as so unexpectedly funny, that, despite the impending punishment, he’d gotten a fit of the giggles.  As their expressions grew increasingly furious, he’d giggled harder, until tears were rolling down his face, and he was frantically biting the inside of his cheek to try to stop.  The beating and subsequent week-long exile into his cupboard had been a trial, but since then, Harry had always had a hard time suppressing giggles when in tense situations.
Cass gave her father a beaming smile.  “Go say hello to Grand-Mère.  I’ll come see her in a bit, if that’s okay.”
So what would the Slytherin do, when forced to accept that he’d never have what he wanted, that he would never atone for his previous sins?  For a while, Draco had no idea what the Slytherin would do, but eventually, as dawn streaked across the sky, he understood.  The Slytherin would forget about Harry.  The Slytherin would get busy making a life for himself, one that didn’t need to include something he couldn’t have.  So, Draco resolved, he had his answer.    And he would do so, as soon as he’d had a chance to regroup, find his footing again.  The Slytherin would also indulge his disappointment and hurt feelings a little.  He’d go home to his Mother.
“I’m fine, Potter.”  He can barely get the words past his lips.  All he wants is to be alone in his humiliation.
The woman’s face went through a miasma of expressions: fear, revulsion, a hint of shame, finally settling on bitter resignation.  It sparked a reaction in Harry, and he struggled to keep his face neutral.  “What about him?”
“Exactly.  I know that having a family has always been really important to Harry, though, and the idea of disappointing the Weasleys, of not being a part of that family, it haunted him.  So I have no idea whether he’d just had too much wine when he confessed that he had sexual thoughts about-”  Her voice cut off and she blushed to the roots of her hair before taking a breath and continuing, “a man, but had decided that he was straight, or maybe bi, and ended up falling in love with Ginny.  I don’t know if he still doesn’t feel that way about Ginny, but is forcing himself to be with her to keep the only family he’s ever known.  Or…”
Ron, who had been happily working his way through the jam tarts that Harry had brought, cleared his throat.  “Harry, mate, have you time to go for a pint?”
Turning away from the crypt, he noticed a cluster of people standing behind him.  Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Granger and Weasley, Longbottom and Abbot, Lovegood and her nutty father.  And Harry, standing resplendent in a set of black dress robes, his hair uncharacteristically sedate.  His resolve faltered a little at the look in Harry’s eyes, but he bit his bottom lip and regained control.
“When we arrive, the house elves will take you directly to your quarters.  I’ll join you there, and then we can discuss final details,” Minerva reminded them.  Cass nodded, but Harry didn’t say anything.  He was watching his daughter.  They were cresting a hill, and if memory served, she would be getting her first glimpse of the Castle any moment.  When it happened, Harry was glad he’d made a point of watching for it.  Cass’ eyes widened and her mouth dropped open as she gaped at the place she’d only ever seen pictures of.
Draco merely grinned, and focused on getting the laces to his skates tied tightly.  He pulled a practice jersey over his head to stay warmer, since he’d been sitting around a while, and grabbed his gloves.  “Let’s go.”
“Maybe,” Harry said.  “He used to be the sort of person who got mad right away and later, but we’re older now.”
Because, it’s clear, I’m a member of this family, if a foundling one.  The second I stepped through the floo, the matriarch, who keeps insisting that I call her Molly, enfolded me in a hug that just dripped with love.  She squeezed hard, as though trying to keep me from pulling away, and I felt so
Draco has a look on his face that Harry’s never seen before.  He draws closer, and for a moment, Harry thinks that Draco is angry with him.  He seizes him by the arms, and gets right in Harry’s face, and for a moment, he thinks that maybe he was wrong that he and Draco were friends.  For a moment Draco looks just as he did after countless spats after Quidditch matches, and Potions classes and…oh…Draco’s lips seal on Harry’s and for a split second, Harry doesn’t think at all, so overwhelmed by sensation and the abstract notion of a key fitting into a lock perfectly, and
“I’m afraid we don’t,” Draco said.  “We were only made aware of the need for a discussion with the Head yesterday evening, so there wasn’t time to make one.  I understand that she is likely very busy, and I hate to presume, but the matter is time-sensitive.  Is there a possibility to make any time in the Head’s schedule today?”
Although he looked reluctant, Scorpius obediently climbed down and stood in front of Harry.  He was trembling.  “I’m not going to touch you, Scorpius, but I want you to watch the way that my shoulders and chest move when I’m breathing.  All I want you to do is to try and breathe like this.  Can you try that for me?”  Scorpius nodded, and his eyes focused on Harry’s shoulders.  Harry led him through a breathing exercise, counting inhales, held breath and exhales, until he could see the little boy start to relax.  “That’s brilliant, Scorpius.  Thanks for doing that.  Go ahead and sit down again.”
“Not much.  Harry was undercover, and he was in a warehouse,” Ron says.  He’s obviously cadged a biscuit from the kitchen, and he speaks in between bites.  “He was an idiot who didn’t call for backup, and, because he’s an idiot,” this said with a fairly dark look in my direction, “he went in alone-”
“Of course I’m sure.  It sounds like it sucked, from start to finish, and I don’t want any more things blindsiding me.  Right now.  You, and you,” Harry looked at Draco.  “Tell me everything.”
“I see,” Draco answered, rising to greet the new arrival.  He placed a kiss on her cheek, and whispered in her ear, “You good, ‘Tori?”
“I don’t hate you either.”  His face looks very young, suddenly.  “And what happens after I break the curse?  When you remember that you hate me, and remember all of the things I did?”
“I’ve never tried one before,” he answered guilelessly.  “It’s so much better than a cot in a cupboard.”
“No,” Hermione admits.  “But I think that public opinion would still have swayed in the direction of the Ministry.”
He shrugs, wondering how he never noticed that Draco’s own eyes were grey, not blue as he’d always thought.  “At the end of sixth year…after…I stood up here, terrified, because I knew that things were about to change, that something big was coming, and I didn’t think I was strong enough to face it.  Feels the same now, but worse.  With Voldemort, I wasn’t sure if I was going to get to live through it.”
He’d noticed that, from time to time, Hermione would give him an appraising look, as though to gauge his emotional stability, and she did this now.  Draco gave her a tight smile, and she quickly looked away, but he was secretly grateful that she understood that this was beyond a stretch of his fortitude.
She leaves behind a scent of jasmine, and the day passes quickly.  We play with Scorpius, and talk Narcissa out of some of her more murderous scheming, and watch the house elves chase away Ron and Hermione’s owl, who seems intent on delivering a letter.
“And you know that I cannot guarantee his safety?  If I accept your offering, I can lead you to him, but he may not be whole.”
“I am happy.  Honestly.  I don’t need anyone to complete me.  I’m fully actualized, all on my own.”  Harry knew that he was oversimplifying things.  True, he didn’t
“I set up the Probation and Rehabilitation Department.  A number of people, including the children of convicted Death Eaters did break laws during the war, even if it was just aiding and abetting their parents.   They had to answer for their crimes, but public opinion didn’t support sending them to Azkaban. Nevertheless, nobody wanted them participating in an uprising, either to try to reincarnate Voldemort or to replace him, so I was able to convince the Wizengamot to create the department, and I personally supervised its efforts.”
Having mastered her elegant, expressionless gaze long before Harry had even been born, Mrs. Malfoy’s lips curved into a small smile.  “I thought we’d agreed long ago that we were to be Narcissa and Harry.  Unless you’d prefer me to call you Mister Potter?”
Harry wasn’t looking at him.  Draco suspected that Harry wouldn’t want to see him again.  He stood.  “Harry, I’ll go. I’m so desperately sorry.  I just wanted you to know that I never stopped loving you.”
“Indeed.”  I quirk my lips at him again, and say, “In order to be absolutely certain I understand, let me restate what I understand.”  He nods.  “It would seem that we’re at a bit of an impasse.  If I wish to pursue the opportunity of Head Auror, I’ll need to be especially careful about who I consort with.  Namely, being seen in the company of Draco Malfoy would make me ineligible for consideration.  Have I gotten that correct?”
Cass again tried to say something, but Harry squeezed her arm gently.  “Just let me finish, Cass, and I’ll listen to what you have to say. Voldemort, the bad wizard?  He could look at my thoughts.  And sometimes he used that to hurt me, or to hurt other people that I cared about.  And so even though you do these things with the best intentions, it is incredibly painful for me when you do it.  So I’ll ask you, one more time, please, allow me my own thoughts.”
Harry’s like a short, lithe octopus, arms and legs surrounding Draco as though he’d like to climb inside him.  Draco accepts the armful of passionate Wizard joyfully, and staggers backward onto the bed.  “Harry,” Draco breathes frantically into Harry’s ear.  “I want you to fuck me.  I want you to fuck me so hard I feel it for days.”
“I’m brave when it comes to risking my life to save people.  I’m absolutely chicken when it comes to this sort of thing.  I’m…I’m emotionally stunted, Draco.  It’s not that I don’t want to reach out to other people.  It’s that I have absolutely no fucking idea how.”
Harry liked Healer Clarke immediately.  She greeted him warmly, but her eyes didn’t flick up to his scar the way that most people’s did.  She also had far more interest in Cass than in Harry, which was exactly as it should be.
“I’m certain that I'm going to regret it,” Harry said ruefully, “but I can’t believe that we’re over a decade from the stupid war, and people are still going after Draco.  This place is so messed up.  They’re still casting me as a hero, because I blundered my way through staying alive when I was a kid, and they’re still casting him as a villain because of choices he was forced to make when he was one.  Both of us born into our roles, and because I was lucky enough to have been on the winning side, he’s vilified.”
“You seem like you are feeling upset,” Draco said, unconsciously using a phrase that Lara used all the time, when the anxiety was too great for him to speak.
“Ron!  Hermione!  George!” Harry’s voice was joyous, as he took them all in.  Then he looked beyond them, to where Draco stood awkwardly, unsure of his reception.  “Draco,” he said, his voice softer, and his expression transfixed.  “Draco, you came!  You came to rescue me.”
“Why do people keep saying that?  I guess?  Just take the money, and go take Violet to the zoo or something, okay?”  I want this problem to go away, and I really don't want to talk about it.  If I'm being honest, I kind of want Mill to go away, because she's got a bunch of pent up emotion going, and I don't really know how to deal.
“Well, when the noise of your thoughts wake me up at five in the morning, and you come to breakfast looking scared, I don’t have a choice!” Cass snapped.
“Of course it does.  And I believe that you’ll find happiness with Miss Greengrass, just as I did with your Father.”
Harry’s heart stutters for a moment, but he recovers quickly, and says, “I’m very sorry to hear that, sir.  My condolences.  I know that you knew each other.”
“No, Harry, be honest for a second.  If not with me, then with yourself.  You wanted to avoid attention, and you wanted someone who couldn’t choose anyone over you, who would love you most of all.”
It had been lonely, sitting under his tree, realizing that he had nobody to confide in, nobody to help him.  Looking back now, Harry realized that his friends and the Weasleys would have helped him, wouldn’t have judged him, but with his confidence lower than it had ever been, and his freshly broken heart thudding in his chest, it had seemed the bleakest moment of his life.
A week later, Draco enters the Leaky Cauldron, where a sizeable crowd has assembled to celebrate Ron’s birthday.  He’s gratified by the shout of welcome from the large corner table, and Hannah waves from behind the bar, sending a large Gin and Soda floating his way.  He sinks down next to Blaise, exchanging a grin with Ginny.  Harry arrives several minutes later, not that Draco’s been watching for him.  He flops down next to Ron, and Draco watches  Hermione lean over Ron until she can reach his cheek.  She kisses him, and whispers something that makes Harry blush.
“Bien sur,” Madame Lefebvre said.  “Come, little one.”  She led them into the back room, and Draco looked around in interest.  The space was meticulously organized, but full to overcrowding.  A small pile of wand blanks sat on the table.  Cass looked at them curiously.
“Alright.  Before I go, I have something for you.  A little ‘welcome to Hogwarts’ treat.”  Harry opened his trunk with a wave of his wand, and wordlessly summoned the gift.  The fabric still felt like spun silver, and Harry ran his hand over it fondly.  “This is one of the few heirlooms that I have to pass along to you.  I was only a little older than you are now when it was given to me, and believe me, we will discuss some guidelines for its use when we return home.  In the meantime, let me show you what it does.”  Harry put the cloak on, grinning at the gasp of shock from his daughter.
Draco’s yawn nearly split apart his head.  “That’s it,” he said.  “I’m knackered.  I’m going to bed.”
“Mr. Harry is right,” Malfoy said, an expression on his face that Harry attributed to his discomfort with agreeing with Harry Potter.  “All of that can be addressed later.  For now, I want you to rest comfortably.”
And then, Harry was nine, and he was more like the boy that Draco remembered meeting in Madame Malkins.  He was thin and knobby-kneed, but a determined little fire lit his green eyes.  Somehow, the boy who’d been neglected and unloved by his family had decided he would take care of himself.  This was, if anything, more hurtful to Draco.  A younger Harry had been desperate to land on the correct behaviour to make his family love him, and blamed himself for every failure.  This child had given up on being loved, but was just as determined to keep himself together.
Harry was watching her face carefully, and so he had the dubious pleasure of seeing the exact moment that Cass’ trust in him shattered.  There was a split second of desperate pain, and then her expression became very cold, and very measured.  She stood up, smoothed down her t-shirt and ran a hand through her tangled curls.  “I think that I will spend time alone in my room, now.”
“It would be a shame for all of the hard work since the war ended, if someone let their old grudges and suspicions create problems for a family.”
together.  When her dad was admitted to a live-in program in an outplacement facility of Janus Thickey, (Xenophilius’ war-related trauma being too much for the man to deal with), Harry spent nearly a month sleeping on her couch, so she hadn’t had to sleep in an empty house.  He’d helped her tend to the Dirigible Plums, and painted walls with her, and made her childhood home her own. Luna has changed, since the war.  Where once she was gentle, with a head in the clouds, she’s now much more direct.  She’s harder, with a keen intolerance for bullshit, and Harry finally understands why she sorted Ravenclaw. Happily married to Rolf Scamander, she is heavily pregnant with twins, and falls prey to the tendency of coupled-up friends to try to force Harry to find someone.
“I should go.  Nobody knows I’m gone.”  Draco stands, casts a glamour on his face to hide the ravages of his tears.
“Oh,” Draco said, “she died, actually.”  Draco chose not to expand on that, unable to find a way to explain that it was Harry’s surrogate mother who had killed her.
“Do you need me to tell everyone?”  It will be awful, he thinks, to have to reach out to their friends, and tell them this news.  But he’ll do it for Draco.
“Draco!  That’s enough.  This is what we are going to do.  Today, we will not be discussing anything that took place before Cass was born.  That is a discussion that you and Harry will have separately, in private, on another day.  Today, we will get to know one another, and make some plans about helping Scorpius.  Is that understood?”
“As long as Malfoy keeps clean, we have no interest in wasting our time on him.  But you must see that it will impact the way that your character is viewed, if you spend time with him.”
“Yes, of course, Cheri.”  She rolled her eyes at him, and he gestured helplessly back, unsure how to fix anything.
It wasn’t easy to floo to Scotland and back in the morning, but Draco knew that the treacle tart sold at the bakery in Hogsmeade was Harry’s favorite.  He packaged up the box, and picked up a quill.
“She's got a point, though,” Astoria said cheerfully.  “It’s good for you, having another woman to call you on your crap.”
Harry looked relieved, but a bit confused.  Draco continued, “But, every time you gain a new age, you also seem to gain the memories of everything that happened to you since your previous one.  And so, even though I can promise that you won’t be actually hurt between now and then, I don’t really know much about what happened to you before Hogwarts.  So while you, this you, won’t be hurt, I’m afraid that you might remember some upsetting things.”
We part at the lifts, and when I arrive home, I look at the pantry and the cold cupboard, dismayed, as I realize that I don’t actually remember how to cook anything.  Unsure how this sort of thing works, I feel like an immense prat as I say to the empty kitchen, “Er…Kreacher?”
I’m not really sure where guilt comes into the equation, but we’re making ground towards reconciliation, so I say, “Maybe we just leave it there?  That we both acted poorly, and we’re both sorry?”
Narcissa laughed.  “They know that they’ve elves, darling.  And yes, sometimes they do help me, especially when I’m doing something particularly difficult, but I greatly enjoy working with my own hands.  Perhaps you’d like to join me some day, and I can show you how to plant a garden of your own.”  The worshipful gaze that Harry returned was answer enough.
I’m not really sure what he means, but asking questions will prompt one of those ‘poor simple Potter’ looks, so I merely nod.  “It doesn’t really matter anyway,” I say finally.  “I’m different now, it seems, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing.  Old me seemed completely fu-” I catch myself just in time as Narcissa raises an eyebrow at my language, “....messed up.  Who wouldn’t want a clean slate if they’d had the sort of life I have?”
I can’t look at Hermione.  I knew that something wasn’t right, but I trusted her, and somehow she was involved with the evil bastard that hurt Draco’s baby, and…she was supposed to be my family.  Because I didn’t have one, and somehow along the way, she and Ron became my people, and even when I woke up, confused, with no memories and no idea what was going on, she felt safe, but she isn’t.  This whole time, she’s known who the person who hurt me was, because it was her.  Because she thought I was turning into a Dark Lord.
Harry couldn’t suppress the giggle that escaped him.  Malfoy looked at him with an odd expression, and Harry schooled his features quickly.
I have no idea how I would deal with a crying Millicent, so I just say, “Listen, old me would have gone into the Ministry, caused a fuss and gotten you your job back.  And then rode away on a Chimera or something.  I have no desire to do that, so just take some stupid money and let’s not ever talk about it again, okay?”
Harry snuffled, burrowing his face closer to Draco, who stiffened, but secured the little bundle on his lap.  “It’s been a hard day, hasn’t it?” Draco said gently.  “It’s only to be expected that you’re a bit unsettled.”
Unsure whether it was the right thing to do, but deciding to take a risk, Draco reached for Harry’s hand.  He looked startled, and his wide green eyes met Draco’s, but he didn’t pull away.
dance, on a table, and there’s an ill advised bout of skinny dipping in the pond after the adults have gone to bed.  Harry’s last coherent thought, before he passes out under an apple tree, is that even when things change, they’re going to be just fine.
“Yes, obviously you are.”  Harry is desperate to distract Draco.  His hands steal down to Draco’s cock, encircling the flesh and stroking it to hardness.
“That I’ve deliberately miscalculated the formula, so that when I administer it to Harry, I’ll kill him.”  Saying the words filled Draco with a shame so great he wanted to weep.  He saw a vision of Harry, lying, tiny and still, on the floor of his lab.
“I’m not, Harry.  Draco continues to know nothing of your life, and the decision lies with you.  But, I wanted you to know that you had the opportunity to help, and be able to make the decision with all the information.”
Draco looks at her.  “They knew that if certain people got wind that they were targeting people who had committed, at most, misdemeanour crimes, while underage, that the backlash would be enormous.  Do you really think that if you, or Harry, or any other Gryffindor had gotten wind of this, that you’d simply let it happen?”
It was another worry, on top of his already churning thoughts.  He adored his daughter, and was incredibly proud of her, but he feared that he allowed her too much latitude, treated her too much like an adult.  It caused him to question everything about the way he’d parented her so far.  He bit his lip, and cast a glance at the doorway through which his daughter had stormed.  “Harry,” Draco said softly.  “Go ahead.  Go talk to her.”
Hoping that I’ll finally get some movement on the wanker that removed my memories, I get ready for bed and, as I lay in bed, waiting for sleep to claim me, I only think of Draco a little bit.
“I don’t.  I don’t know if he’s well, and I have no idea where he is.  I’m sorry, I wish that I did.”
Harry heard a noise, and it was as though a separate, detached part of his brain was registering it.  Noises didn’t matter anymore.  Darkness mattered, and Blanket, and Safe.  Harry absently registered the sound of talking, and frowned.  He didn’t like when he heard voices.  They made him cry, and Harry wasn’t allowed to cry.  He burrowed deeper into Blanket, making sure that his head was covered.  It wouldn’t be long before the voices would go away.  They always did, just like the shadows that descended on him with angry, sucking mouths, and the red eyes that lurked in the corner.  He waited patiently, but the voices kept making noises.
Watching Cass’ face as she spotted Diagon Alley for the first time was one of the most glorious experiences of Draco’s life.  She was quiet as they approached the Leaky Cauldron, her big, bright eyes darting around to take everything in.  As Draco raised his wand to the bricks and the archway opened, her face alit with wonder.  She followed Astoria and Scorpius in a daze looking as though she wanted to see everything all at once.  Draco remembered seeing a small boy in a robes shop, his face wearing the same expression.
“Ugh, Malfoy, can’t you possibly avoid being a prick for even just a minute?  And you,” Weasley rounded on the baby, “why do you
to these people?  It had been bad enough the first time I showered, discovering a roadmap of scars across my body.  I know they’ve told me I’m in law enforcement, but I must be absolutely
Draco puts his arm around me.  “I think that we should do this in one of the spare suites.  I expect that you’ll need some time to recover from having your memories restored so quickly, so this way we won’t have to levitate you anywhere.”
“I don’t love you.  I love…well I don’t love you, that’s for sure.  Besides that, nobody’s cursed me, but you’ve assaulted me.  I know all about the stupid potions.”
It’s incomprehensible to me.  As fond as I am of Draco, I couldn’t imagine making a sacrifice like that for him.  Maybe it’s different with someone’s child.
“No!” The woman shouted this, before exchanging a wide-eyed look with her husband and saying, “Everything’s fine.”
Draco nodded his understanding and the Healer left.  He reached out for Narcissa’s hand.  “Thank you, Mother.  I’ll be okay, you don’t have to hang on anymore,” he lied.
“Here, of course,” The Unspeakable waves his wand, and the bubble dissipates, revealing a tiny, blonde baby.  His eyes are closed, and he’s very still, but I’m relieved to see his chest rising and falling with his breaths.  Draco makes a strangled sound and tenses.  Pansy holds his arm tightly.
“Right, that was how it happened.  Afterwards, I pitched an enormous fit in Dumbledore’s office, broke stuff, yelled at him.  We talked, and then, I just…went to bed.  I went back to my dorm, and everyone else was asleep.  Ron, Hermione and Neville were in the infirmary, Dean and Seamus had already gone to sleep. I was on my own.”  Harry looked at Draco for a moment, his dazzling eyes soft and full of compassion “It was the loneliest night I’ve ever spent in my life.  And I’ve known lots of those nights before and after.  But it was the worst.  I cast a silencing charm, and cried, and just lay there, empty.  Nobody should sleep alone on a night where they lose someone.”
Draco stared at Harry for a long moment, his gaze piercing.  Suddenly, he smiled, and his face was beautiful and open, and happy.  Having never had such a smile directed at him, it took Harry aback for a moment.  “You’re something else, Scarhead,” Draco said.
“Once Kingsley reassured you that there was a body who was responsible for their conduct, I looked into it further.  The Probation and Rehabilitation department has four full-time staff members, one of whom is the Team Lead.  His name is Dennis Creevey.  Gryffindor, lost a brother in the battle.  Creevey reports directly to Gawain Robards, but unofficially, Zach Smith reviews and signs off on his reports, with Robards rubber-stamping them afterwards.  Creevey doesn’t seem to do much of anything, as far as I can tell.”
Finally, the meeting broke up, and Harry paused to snag one of the nice pastries before they were all gone.  He settled on a jam one, leaving only raisin ones in the box.  “Potter,” a smug voice said in his ear.  “You’re still here then?”
“Potter, you figured out how to find the Philosopher’s Stone when you were an ickle firstie.”  Pansy doesn’t seem to be giving up on this.
The snake has found a rat in a corner, and is thrilled by the impromptu snack.  As it digests, it wraps its now-lumpy body around Harry and falls asleep.
Harry’s heart sank.  Again.  He’d thought that the day had gone well, had hoped that a seeker’s game, and their awkward talk a few nights earlier had begun to thaw their interactions.  He braced himself for the inevitable.  “Oh?”
It was nearly Christmas time when Lara looked up at him expectantly and said, “Well then, Draco, I wanted to discuss something with you.”
His bulbous eyes light up, and I swear he’s crying a bit.  “Master Harry is no longer with the Blood Traitor?  And he wants Kreacher to cook for his date!  And Master Harry will have a child for poor old Kreacher to take care of!”
“No, of course you didn’t.  Nobody did.  Anyways, I was heading to Knockturn, and I noticed that there was a new shop.  And through the window, I saw this flash of white-blond hair.  I didn’t go to Knockturn that day.  I went home, and spent the whole night wondering what sort of shop Draco Malfoy would have opened.  I came back every day for a week, trying to catch a glimpse of you through the window.
“And, you know, it’s the funniest thing,” Harry continued, in a voice that suggested it was anything but, “but I’d gotten used to things being uncertain, and fairly horrible, here in England, and when I moved to Canada, they got better.  A lot better.  And I got arrogant, or complacent or something.  And I sort of thought that I’d used up all my bad luck.”
“She’s fine.  About to be completely furious with me, when I tell her that I’ve just gotten us grounded.  She was looking forward to seeing Diagon Alley.”
I try to go easy, honestly, but I overestimate my ability to hold my drink.  Hannah convinces me to eat some chips, and stops serving me after a while, but the damage is done.  She seems to find it hilarious that I’m completely sozzled.  “Harry, let me call Ron and Hermione to come fetch you,” she says, when it appears that I’m falling asleep on the bartop.
Someone pulls on my wrist, and I turn to confront whomever is foolish enough to delay me.  When I see that it’s Draco, I lower my wand.  “That?” Draco says, slamming me into an adjacent wall, “was really fucking hot.”  His mouth is on mine before I can respond.  I kiss him eagerly, my hands touching him anyplace I can reach while hindered by his robes.  In my desperation for contact, I can’t settle on caressing any one part of him for long.
“Alright.”  The drinks were poured, and Harry sat, uncomfortable, unsure why Draco was making the gesture.
“Of course there isn’t,” Andromeda says.  “Harry wouldn’t have trusted just anyone with something for Teddy.”  She scrutinizes him.  “There’s something between you and Harry, isn’t there.”
“Honestly, Mister Fortesque, there aren’t very many people who treat me normally.  As though I’m just a regular person.  I appreciate that you do, and I’d like to see that Louise gets a chance to follow her dream.  Once she’s on her feet, she can do the same for someone else someday.  Alright?  Please?”  Now that I have this idea in my head, I’m reluctant to let it go.  I can’t keep hanging around the house, and I feel like this is the only way they’ll let me come and hang out.
Miriam smiled.  “It would be lovely if it worked out that way.  I care about all of my patients, but there’s something rather special about Harry.”
“Not at all.  I’m sorry to keep you both from your day, but I wanted to make you a bit of a proposal.”
“I don’t know about that.  It’s not even really about Pansy, I don’t even remember her.  I’m just pissed at the idea that I died for a society who can’t stop letting their prejudices get in the way of sense.”
“Well, I never!” The woman seems to double in size, filled with air, and affront.  Her cheeks grow pink.  “Of course I bought it here.”
“I’m okay,” she said immediately, and that was when Harry knew that she wasn’t.  Cass was an exuberant child, who was prone to fits of drama over trifles, but when she was actually hurt or upset, she adamantly insisted that she was fine.
“It’s not bad,” he admits.  “Subtle enough, but not allegations that the Ministry can avoid.  Especially…” he trails off and I look more closely at him.
After learning that even Severus was fond of Potter, Draco had resolved to stop speaking ill of him, at least in front of his daughter.  It put her on the defensive, and it made Draco feel things he didn’t wish to feel.  He was about to suggest that he show Cass the Library, when an almighty howling emerged from the bedrooms upstairs.
Her Papa listened when she talked about it, but he didn’t offer to help.  It made her feel lonely.  Papa was good at making sure she ate enough, and did her lessons, and he brought her books and potions ingredients, once she learned that she was good at brewing them.  He would patiently explain the new things she was learning, and tell marvellous stories about his childhood, and listen eagerly when she told him her own stories.  But he never asked how she was doing.  He didn’t notice when she needed a hug, the way her Dad did.  And even though she was getting more and more worried about her Dad, he never, ever brought up the subject.  She started talking about it more, to see if he’d give something away, but every time it was the same.  His face would grow stiff, like a mask, and his tone would become clipped, and distant.
Harry thought about not answering her.  It was a horribly intrusive question, and it seemed particularly rude to ask it under the circumstances.  “You don’t stop loving someone like Draco.”  Her face turned a little sad, and he hurried to say, “Please don’t worry, Mrs. Malfoy.  I have no intention of interfering with Draco’s family.  I won’t ruin things for him, I promise.”  Her face turned a lot sad when he said that, and he was struggling to figure out what he’d said wrong when Astoria returned.
She grinned, “The half is very important.  My daughter gets quite offended when we forget to add it.”
Nobody had been as calmly accepting of him as Harry.  There was no judgement, no impatience at all in the thin little face.  He’d simply accepted that Draco needed to do these things, and resolved to keep out of his way while he did them.  Draco could imagine how he would have reacted at nine, if someone had kept him waiting for something so stupid, so pointless.  With great resolve, Draco ignored as many of the panicked voices that were clamouring for his attention as possible, and gave Harry the biggest smile he could manage.  “I think I’m finished, for now,” he said, and Harry looked at him hard, as if to make sure he was telling the truth.  “Let’s go have tea.”
So they did.  It took hours, and Harry was exhausted by the time they finished.  He’d cried a few times during the retelling.  When Hermione told him about Sirius.  When Draco told him about Dumbledore.  When Ron, who had shown up midway through, and made them come sit by the fire before they continued, surprisingly gently, told him that Harry himself was a Horcrux.  To be fair, Draco cried then too, but he managed to spell his tears away quickly and hoped that nobody noticed.
“He should be up from his nap shortly.  Shall I make tea?”  Without waiting for an answer, she swept from the room, and Harry and Draco made themselves comfortable on the sofa.  Harry squeezed his hand and snuggled against Draco.  When Andromeda returned with a tea tray, she paused for a moment, eyeing their closeness with her sharp, dark eyes.  “Well, this is unexpected,” she remarked.
The Healer leaves nearly as quickly as he came, leaving Draco kneeling on the floor next to the sofa where Scorpius lies.  The sleeping spell has worn off, and Scorpius seems no worse for wear, but Draco looks a wreck.  Pansy and I glance at each other, and I'm just a step behind her as she moves to his side.
“Severus, you’re being house-ist again.  Gryffindors think.  We just don’t get caught up in it as much as snakes or ravens.”
As Rose and I are sitting at the table, waiting for Ron and Hermione, I say, “This place looks like fun.  Everyone’s happy here.”
Andromeda and Teddy lived in a tiny cottage on the outskirts of a Wizarding Village.  They apparated there hand in hand, and walked the short distance to the cottage.  Harry threw the door open joyfully, calling “Andy?  I’ve brought a guest.”
“Um, yeah, I think.  I mean, I have to go home for a bit, sort things out, but I thought I’d maybe…come back?  If you…”
Then, he remembered that Draco didn’t want him, and he drew away, his cheeks flushed and his fingers on his lips as if to hold the feeling of Draco’s there.  “I…I,” he stammered.  “I’m sorry.  I can’t-”
She laughs.  “And when has that ever stopped you before?  You’ve always carried the weight of your responsibilities on your shoulders.”
“I know that you and Ron were right by my side, fighting Voldemort, but I don’t think I’m completely incapable of taking care of myself.”
“But you know what happened.  We slept together.  We made promises to one another.  We had hope for a future.  Then you left, and I tried to owl you, but they kept coming back.  And I talked to your Mother, and she said you’d left the continent.  That’s all.”
A few weeks later, when we’re lying on his enormous, ostentatious bed, Draco sighs into my neck.  “What is it?” I ask.
“Very well,” Draco sighed, trying to keep the worry out of his voice.  “But you’ll have to eat a little more at lunchtime today.”  Scorpius eyed him with the face of a child who had no intention of eating more at lunchtime, but Draco didn’t have the ability to climb that particular mountain at present.
“You may stay,” Draco said.  “But it’s important that you don’t touch anything without asking.  Can you do that?”  A nod.  Harry walked over to a corner of the lab, and sat on the floor, watching Draco, who was examining the results of the diagnostics.  “Hermione,” he said, keeping his voice light, “come take a look?”
Once they went inside, Teddy disappeared to his room to read, and Harry made his way to Andromeda’s kitchen, where he gratefully accepted a cup of coffee.  His kitchen had already waged war on the latest coffee maker, and he’d had to settle for a powdered instant abomination that morning.  “How’s work?” Andromeda asked, as she always did.  The older woman had been incredibly supportive of Harry’s career choice, and she loved hearing stories about young witches and wizards who were learning about their abilities.
“Well, we could settle this once and for all.  If only I had my wand.”  She looked at him wryly, one wild curl falling down over her eye.
He threw off his apron, set his tools aside, and hurried into the house, where Minerva McGonagall stood, beaming at Cass.  “Min,” he said thickly, emotion crowding into his voice.
Harry chuckled.  “Frankly, yes.  I’ve just disrupted all of your paradigms.  It’s an enormous shock, and some people struggle with accepting something so surprising.”
“Yes, Papa, thank you!  Mama, I’m getting a broom of my own!” Scorpius called out excitedly.  Cass was grinning at her brother, clearly excited for him.
“If the hat had a lick of sense, it wouldn’t sort kids at all.  It’s a stupid system, and the last thing a little kid needs is to be fed a bunch of nonsense about preordained characteristics.  Minny is sick to death of me nagging her about it,”  Harry grumbled.
“Harry,” Draco said gently.  “Do you remember why Ron and Hermione are here today?”  Harry shook his head.  “They’re here to help me give you a potion to help you grow big.  It's a bit like medicine, but when you’re done, you’re going to have grown quite a bit.  You can have the potion in your room, or down in my lab.  Which do you prefer?”
“But…” Draco was truly wrong-footed now, and he wondered if maybe he were drunker than he thought.  “No, Harry.  You must have ended up with her.”
Astoria laughed.  “Scorpius has been lying in wait since six o’clock this morning for her arrival.  When she arrived on Greg’s arm, he practically exploded with delight, and dragged them both to his room.”
“I hope to fix this before he has a chance to call me anything,” Draco answered.  Harry’s enormous eyes fixed on his, and he extended his hands towards Draco.  With a sigh, Draco reached over and, surpassing a shudder, took the baby, nearly dropping him when he noted that his elaborate dress robes were encrusted with food.
“I…yeah,” Harry said.  He stood, and as Minerva looked closely at his eyes, she saw the same look that had haunted him through the final years of the war, as though he bore the sole responsibility to save everyone.  In these moments, he always looked impossibly young.
“What on earth were you thinking?  I know you’re not a stupid man, Potter.  You somehow managed to defeat a Dark Lord.  You’ve raised a lovely child without her being eaten by a Hippogriff or something.  What could possibly have possessed you to assault a member of the press in front of
“He grew up in a cupboard.  He had a Dark Lord living in his head.  His girlfriend has been secretly potioning him,” Hermione countered.
“You need help.  You don’t have the political influence you once did, and they’re obviously not going to contact you.  This has gone on long enough.”
“Okay,” Draco repeated.  “I’m not sure whether you’re ready to hear it yet, but I wanted to apologize for the way I acted the last time we saw each other.  I know that I lied to you, even if my intentions were good, and I know that lying is something that you simply can’t tolerate, even if…especially if, it’s being done to protect you.”
“Potter, Weasley,” Draco replied.  He directed Weasley to the chair, and began to prepare to administer the vaccination onto Weasley’s freckled neck when he caught a flash of crimson robes out of the corner of his eye.  “Don’t touch that,” he said sharply, and Potter yanked his hand back so quickly that he stumbled backward into a rack of vials that were cooling.  The rack fell to the ground with an almighty clatter, and a series of brightly coloured vials hit the floor.  Most of them had already been spelled unbreakable, but the blood thickening potion, which was still cooling, and an earlier batch of inflammation reducer that had to cure under the a full moon, hadn’t.  Draco watched, his thoughts detached, as the vials shattered, and the potion spattered all over Potter.
“Really?” Her head cocked, she reminds me of a little, curious bird.  “You’ve always had good judgement.”
Once we’re settled with our drinks, Draco says, “I’ve been thinking about your memory loss, and I think we need to confirm whether the memories have been removed, or just blocked.”
“We are,” Harry agrees.  “If we’re intruding, you need only say, but I brought some groceries.  Didn’t want you to have to go out to the shops if you needed anything.”
“Poor Harry,” she says, patting my arm.  “It must be awfully confusing when you have so many ingrained responses, but no context for why you’re feeling that way.”
“You know something about Harry?”  Her face changes completely at the mention of Harry’s name.  “Is he well?  Do you know where he is?”
“I want to know, obviously.”  Her delivery of the word ‘obviously’ was a deadpan Severus impression, and Harry flicked his eyes to the portrait to see his reaction.  Severus emitted a long-suffering sigh, and motioned Harry to continue.
That prompted the ghost of a smile.  Miriam continued, “So?  Are you there with me?  Living in a world where you could have anything you wanted?”
“Yeah.  We both joined up after the war.  I quit when Hermione got pregnant, though.  Went to work with George.”
The ceremony goes perfectly, and Ron and Pansy accept their godparent roles delightedly.  Harry is beaming throughout, and, if his eyes aren’t on Scorpius, they’re on Draco, full of love, and pride, and a happiness that Draco can’t get enough of seeing.
Harry still couldn’t speak, the tension of being unable to suppress his laughter, and Draco’s irritated, tired expression as he rolled Harry over to face him making everything worse.  He laughed and laughed, and Draco’s annoyance quickly turned into…hurt.  “Fine.  Whatever,” he said, and rolled so that his back was now facing Harry.
“Where do you get off, Blaise?  This is none of your business.  Potter doesn’t want anything to do with me, and it was
“Oh yes, that’s true.  I think you’ve gone nearly a week without calling me ‘little duck’ and getting that wounded deer look.”
At first, Draco couldn’t understand what the problem was.  Without question, he’d been stupid and thoughtless, at the dinner table, but why would Harry be upset about taking his daughter to Diagon Alley?  Why would he begrudge Draco one moment of his child’s magical upbringing?  Stifling a groan, Draco rephrased the question in his head.  Why would Harry Potter, wandsmaster, be offended that Draco had taken away a moment that he’d likely dreamed of his entire life?
“So it is,” Draco agreed, stretching and giving a final longing glance at his fluffy duvet.  “Shall we have pancakes for breakfast?”
“Draco Malfoy, don’t you dare start that shit again,” Astoria said fiercely.  “I know what you’re thinking right now, and I won’t let you.  This isn’t your fault, you’re not being punished, and our baby is not going to die.”
“I don’t know,” he mutters.  “I think so.  I’m going to call our private Healer.” He stomps over to the floo, and casts an incendio.  As he grabs a handful of floo powder he suddenly turns back.  “We will be talking about what just happened.”
Too late, Draco realizes that Dennis Creevey sits to his left.  He stifles a sigh, and says, “Hullo, Dennis.”
“Nor will I.  I like to think that I’ve never abused your trust in me, except about this, which was more of a decision not to overwhelm you with information than a desire to lie to you. And I know that you’re well aware that our magical abilities give us some obligation to use them responsibly.  But yes, you have the power to find out all of the information yourself, and I won’t make any effort to stop you.  I will say that sometimes when you go looking for information that isn’t freely given, you learn more than you wanted to.  I promise to tell you as soon as I can.”
It was this confluence of events that had Harry nearing his breaking point as they flooed back to Draco’s house.  Cass had been ordered to take it easy, and she’d insisted that if she was going to be stuck inside, it wouldn’t be at Hogwarts.  Draco had offered up her room at his house, and Harry had hesitated.  His reluctance to leave her alone must have shown, because Draco had said, “You too, Harry, obviously.”
“Cass, that’s amazing. I’m so happy for you.”  He was, Draco could see.  Because he was looking for it, Draco also saw that there was just a hint of longing, but mostly, Harry was thrilled that Cass was playing, that she was having fun.  His smile was wide.
Draco resolved to ask some more specific questions about Harry’s Muggle relatives, but decided that this might not be the right time.  He motioned to a stool, next to him, and Harry awkwardly climbed up.  He sat, swinging his legs a little, before he noticed Draco watching him, and quickly stopped.  “I imagine this must be confusing,” Draco said, after a while of mutual scrutiny.
The incongruence of being called ‘Mr. Malfoy’ by someone whose nappies Draco had changed, well, nearly changed, struck him.  “Why don’t you call me Draco,” he invited.  Harry nodded.  Draco plunged on, a little desperately.  “Do you remember that I cast a spell on you a few days ago?”  Another nod.  “I’m going to do the same thing now.”
“Well, I will be, shortly.  But off-ice training is important too.  I need a strong core to support me.  I just have one more thing to finish before I hit the ice, okay?  Do you want tea, or breakfast?”
She pours a clear liquid into a glass, followed by another, carbonated clear liquid and plunks a lime wedge in.  “There you are.  Gin.  Soda.  Perfect for a night of dancing.”
But, there was no time for woolgathering today, as they both had appointments at Hedwig House.  They apparated into the gardens, and Draco steadied Cass, who always stumbled upon landing.  “Ready?”
“I know that you had the chance to be happy, and you decided that self-flagellation was more important than your future.”
not realize I’m gay.  He’s smirking up at the camera, leaning against an old motorbike.  Too bad he’s dead.  He looks like a lot of fun.
Harry’s words dislodged something in Draco that he hadn’t even realized existed. To his immense horror, he felt a prickling in his nose, and, before he knew it, enormous tears were rolling down his cheeks.  A sob popped out, followed by another, and suddenly, he was weeping, his forehead on the floor, feeling that he might die from the pain he was feeling.  He sort of hoped he would.  His crying was undignified, loud inelegant wails, but Draco was pretty sure he was never going to be able to stop.  Harry hovered above him, eyes wide, and impossibly green, unsure what to do, unprepared to deal with such unfettered anguish.  Tears swam in his own eyes, and finally, as no other options present himself, he settled next to Draco, wrapping himself around Draco’s heaving form and held on.
He spent the rest of the day, after a shower and a calming draught, by his mother’s bedside, reading poetry aloud.  As the late summer sun sank below the horizon, flooding his Mother’s room with crimson orange light, Draco dared to speak.  He was certain his Mother couldn’t hear him; her periods of lucidity seemed to be increasingly infrequent.  In his loneliness and desperation to have someone who understood him, Draco poured out the whole story, finishing with the awful night he’d just spent with Harry.
The next morning, I sleep late, drag myself into the sitting room and practice spells for a while, until, hungry, I manage to convince Kreacher to sit and have tea with me.  He grumbles endlessly about the amount of work he’s missing, but I ask him to tell me more about his original family, the Blacks, and so he’s quite happily describing the way that good house elves got their heads on the wall when they died, when the floo goes.
I feel celebratory that night, and so I pull on a pair of tight camouflage combat pants and a t-shirt that hugs every angle.  My pride is still pretty bruised at being an inadvertent home wrecker, and I conclude there’s no better remedy for a broken heart than some positive attention.  I return to the club I went to the night I got out of St. Mungo’s.  Just like last time, there’s a long line snaking down the sidewalk, but the doorman catches my eye and nods me over.
“Thank you,” Draco said, seeming surprised to be saying it.  “I’ve been worrying about this for a while, and I’m relieved to have some help.”
“It’s very simple, Draco.  You were, as we’ve discussed many times, a pawn in a war fought by adults.  Your actions, whether well-considered or not, were the best choices that you could make under the circumstances.  I’ll remind you that the Wizengamot itself cleared you of all charges, due to your status as a youth offender, and your attempts to rehabilitate during your probation.  Your continued self-flagellation is unproductive, given that it doesn’t help you manage your symptoms, or find peace with your circumstances.”
“What did you do?”  The awful voice thing is contagious, it turns out because my voice doesn't sound okay either.
“Great, how’s Reginald?”  She beams, and I placidly listen to tales of her wayward Crup while she plies me with biscuits.  Fifteen minutes later, Kingsley comes to the door, and beckons me inside.
“Yes. Yes, that’s…yes.” Harry said, and took Draco’s hand, leading him to the back door, holding the puppy with his other arm.
“Why would I go for lunch when I have this lovely cupcake to eat?” Draco parries.  He can’t bear to sit across a table and look at the only person Draco thinks he has a chance of loving.  Not when Draco is the last man Harry would actually consider.  “Off you go, Potter.”
When he finished with the Powers’, it was still early, but since Harry was on-call that night, he decided not to return to the office.  Instead, he popped into the Granger-Weasley back yard and rapped on the door.
“My Mama,” Harry echoed.  Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was agreeing with him, or inquiring after his own mother, but he edged closer, and petted Harry’s hair back off his forehead.
“So, my family had sworn their loyalty to Lord Voldemort, as Riddle came to be called, long before I was born.  When Harry and I were babies, Voldemort disappeared, and Harry was whispered about as the Boy who Lived.  My family, threatened by the notion that a half-blooded baby could vanquish their great hope, told me that Harry Potter was nothing more than a piece of propaganda, used to frighten Purebloods.  I grew up at my Father’s knee, hearing that the Dark Lord would someday return, and that he would crush Harry Potter beneath his boot.”
“I don’t think that you should be alone right now.  I know the look on your face very well.  Will you go to your friend Granger?”
“It seems wrong, somehow, to wake him up,” Draco said, despite his better judgement.  “Leave him, Hermione.  We’ll be fine.”
Draco felt a long-forgotten sense of indignation at being unjustly accused.  “I’m not up to anything, Weasley.  If you recall,
“Of course I am, Luna.  I know that I’ve been viewed as some sort of public property since I was a baby, but I didn’t think that she bought into that.  I think that old Harry was too trusting.”
“Neither was I…It wasn’t done, you see.  It wasn’t dignified.  I knew my parents loved me, but they didn't touch me much.”
"Oh no?  How well do you think your little...relationship with Harry would survive if he knew that I was preventing him from seeing Teddy because of you?  I'm sure that he'd stand up for you, at first.  But would you really be able to survive his resentment of you?  Robbing him of his dreams like that?"
“It’s a little much.” Pansy said soothingly.  “It started as a joke, but it’s gotten a little out of control lately.  Hannah’s really got a thing for those fucking cushions.  The rest of the house isn’t that bad.  Come, we’re all in the kitchen.”
“I don’t mean it that way, Draco, but you have to see my point.  Scorpius was so wanted.  I love him so much, but something doesn’t seem right about this.  And, we don’t know if a half sibling would even match Scorpius.  But then I just look at his little face, and I’d do anything in the world to get him better.”
“It’s Hermione, and it’s nothing, at least, I hope it’s nothing,” Hermione said, biting her lip.  “Only, something doesn’t add up about Harry’s potion use.  He’s certainly been a little different since the war ended, but I don’t see any symptoms that suggest that he’s abusing any potions.  He doesn’t display the behaviour of an addict, and Harry is terrible at keeping secrets.  I’m not sure, if Harry is in fact under an influence, that he knows about it at all.”
“Well, if we could brew Polyjuice in a bathroom, I’m sure she could find a way,” Hermione said, as if thinking to herself.  Draco had many follow up questions to that statement, but resolved to get answers later.  “She couldn’t be sneaking back to Hogwarts.  Do you think she was renting a space?”
, Draco.  You worked hard, and you managed to reevaluate the lessons you’d been taught, and you learned to define things differently.  Harry Potter didn’t do that for you.”
It’s a week before Harry returns to the shop, and Draco has spent much of it snapping at Grace over trivialities and
She gives me a look that I can’t quite place.  Part annoyed, part sad, and a hint of something else, but she says, “Chaser,” and I nod as though I know what that means.
At 5:55 am, exactly, Draco’s wand buzzed.  He silenced it, and lay, perfectly still, waiting the requisite one minute before he was allowed to get up.  Counting the sixty seconds off in his head, he heard Lara’s voice there too, gentle and encouraging, “And, Draco, I’m curious about what would happen if you
“I don’t know,” I say, honestly.  “But hopefully, I’ll remember how much I don’t hate you right now.”
“There’s very little understanding of what comprises a soul, you know,” she says.  I'm used to her unexpectedly starting an entirely new topic of conversation so I nod.
the time to daydream what a Lord can do.  “Now, Unspeakable.  Do you accept the challenge, or will you cease your research and leave the Department of Mysteries?”
The afternoon passed…tolerably.  Kreacher, as Weasley had pointed out, was mad as a brush, but he was entranced by Harry Potter in baby form, and was able to care for him for several hours while Draco worked.  After liberating some blood and hair samples from the baby, and placing them into a potion bath to scan for toxins, Draco took advantage of the time, noting down precise formulas in his notebook, and only occasionally casting a slightly desperate glance at the portion of shower he’d not yet cleaned.  When he’d finished with the complex arithmancy required to determine the exact stage the inflammation reducer had reached before mixing with the blood thickener, he finally allowed himself to scrub down the shower before entering it himself.  His self-cleaning rituals, left unchecked, often took a great deal of time, but, noting that it had been suspiciously quiet in the flat above, he rushed through his ablutions, and summoned a fresh set of robes from the wardrobe.
He looks as though he’s about to tell me something more, but Pansy makes a strangled noise, and they exchange a conversation conducted entirely through glares.  He sinks his head into his hands.
Thank you for thinking of my Mother and sending the draught.  Tell Hermione that it eased her discomfort and that she seemed to sleep well last night.  I’m very grateful to you both.  Thought you’d enjoy something sweet to remind you of happier times.
Harry’s smile was lovely, Draco noticed absently.  It blossomed across his face, leaving behind an enchanting flush.  “I like hearing that,” he admitted.
Just then, a little wail came from a bedroom above them.  “Oh good!  Teddy’s awake!” Harry cried. “I’ll just go get him.”  He took off at a run, and Draco could hear him chattering away to the baby.
Ron takes her hand, his eyes suspiciously shiny.  Hermione continues, “But you became an Auror.  And you were amazing, and so dedicated, but it’s impossible to prevent every loss.  Each time you were too late to save someone, each time a criminal got away, it weighed on you even heavier.  Your magic has always been powerful, and after Voldemort died, it became more so.  At the time, we didn’t know if the Horcrux had transferred his powers to you when you died, or if you just came into your magical maturity.  Regardless, when you experienced high emotions, your magic reacted.”
“So,” she begins.  “The three best friends need to get the cursed goblet in order to destroy the worstest wizard of all time.  They search far and wide, and learn that the terrifying Bella has locked it away in her Gringotts vault.”
“Everyone who knows me says that I was different after I lost my memories.  What if I go back to how I was?  I don’t want to be old Harry.  I don’t completely want to be new Harry.  How do I balance?”
“I’m sure he’s disappointed too, but he has a lot on his mind,” she says softly.  “He likes you very much, you know.”  I look at her in surprise.  I haven’t told Luna that I’m gay, and I didn’t bother mentioning Draco either.  I feel like Hermione would have warned me if Luna was a mind-reader, though, so maybe she’s just scarily perceptive.  Funny though, that my two best friends were gobsmacked that I’m gay, and Luna seems to have known all along.
“Yes, certainly.  What was your biggest concern with getting back your memories, and with them, the ability to truly feel your emotions?”
“‘Mione!”  Harry launched himself, as best he could, into her arms.  She held him tight, and then gripped him by the arms and thrust him away from herself.
“Well, you’ve made your choice, haven’t you?  I can’t help it if you’re completely behind on the gossip.”
The green eyes darken a little, and he sweeps his eyes over Draco appraisingly.  “You’re a smart lad, Malfoy.  I’m sure you can figure it out.”
“Teddy?  The Weasleys?  Minerva, who’s died, because you’re obviously here to tell me that someone has.”
It’s my first day of work at Fortesque’s and it’s barely eleven o’clock when the shop gets so busy that I don’t notice the time passing.  At 2:30, Louise throws me a big smile.  “Go take a break, Harry.  You’ve been going steady since this morning.”
I bury my face into the crease between his leg and groin, and lick, taste the sweat, feel the velvet soft skin under my tongue.  Leaving his pants on, I mouth at his cock, his balls, through the fabric.  Gently, I tease one finger underneath the leghole of his pants, stroking his soft skin.  “Harry,” he says urgently.  “Let me touch you.”
“And your…coaches were okay with you leaving?” She still struggled with the uncommon Muggle word.  She didn’t understand why Draco left, why he was playing Muggle Hockey, of all things, for a shitty minor league team in Canada.  She couldn’t understand that he was just Dray there, that the name on the back of his jersey didn’t engender fear or loathing in those who read it.  She couldn’t see that it was just a cool looking tattoo on his wrist there, not a symbol of his weakness, his foolishness.
“And this is the best way to do it?” He pulls me over to a shady arbour, and sits me down on the bench, straddling it so that he can look at me.  “Do you think that a fresh slate will really work?”
Lara’s statement so unnerved Draco that he flooed to his lab instead of to his living quarters.  He stood in the lab, the sterile order soothing him, and then climbed the stairs.  He could hear Harry saying, in a worried voice, “…but you’re sure he’s going to come back?”  With a little smile, Draco lingered outside the sitting room to listen.
?”  I’m smiling, but he won’t look at me.  “Oh, you do.”  The way he's acting makes me realize that he expects me to feel…something.  I mentally shrug as I realize that I don’t have much of any reaction.
She calls Rose, gathers the floo powder and stands facing the flames for a moment.  Mill has remained silent through the exchange, and I glance at her.  Her face is tight, her expression completely closed off.  Just before Hermione throws the powder, she says, “I’ll make some inquiries.”
“Here.  I kept it safe for you.”  It was Draco’s wand.  He gasped, barely believing it.  His hand, as he reached for it, trembled.  Gripping it, he felt the familiar, exhilarating surge of his magic.  It was like coming home, and Draco’s eyes filled with tears before he blinked them back.
“Well, my favourite subjects are math and science.  Muggle subjects.  Would he be able to teach me those?”
“Do you think we’re the kind of people who will be friends after they break up?”  I sort of hate how vulnerable I sound.
Harry had just gotten into the story of his first encounter with Draco in Madame Malkin’s, when a knock sounded at the door.  It was a house elf, bearing a letter from Hermione.
She glares at me for a moment, and then says, “No.  Of course I wouldn’t feel okay about it.”  She rattles off rapid-fire instructions for Ron to go fetch Molly to watch Rose, and disappears in search of some books she thinks will help.
“I was the parent who carried and delivered Cass.”  The murmurs gave way to gasps and exclamations of shock.  Harry took a breath and kept his eyes fixed on Cass.  He didn’t want to look at the reporters gathered, didn’t want to see the looks on their faces.  He was pretty sure that Pansy wouldn't let them get away with calling him a freak to his face, but he didn’t want to see them thinking it either.
sake.  “Thank you,” I say, and I’m thrilled that I betray none of my annoyance at her cryptic story, which helped in absolutely no way at all.
“That’s true,” Papa said, “but he likely didn’t tell you that they weren’t kind to him.  Not at all.  They hated magic, and they hated Harry’s parents, and so that meant that they hated him too.”
Since then, any time that things had gotten tough, he’d find his way to Luna’s and they’d listen to Nina Simone.  He put the record on now, thanking Merlin yet again that Luna had agreed to go through the training to become a foster parent, and that her home was open to children who needed her boundless kindness.
“Scorpius, you don’t have to apologize.  Every single witch and wizard does accidental magic.  You won’t be in trouble for it.  Magic is brilliant, but it’s hard to learn, and we don’t punish kids for the things they can’t control.”
“Yeah, Boy who Lived, Voldemort,” she said, with an impatient wave of her hand.  “That was like ten years ago or more, right?”
He gasped a breath, and when that seemed to work, he tried another.  “Daddy?”  Cass grabbed his hand, looking very young, and very frightened.
“No idea.  The Fidelius wouldn’t have stopped her, because she’s known the secret since we moved in, but Hermione’s wards are strong.”
Astoria stood, and crossed the room to stand in front of Harry.  Her eyes were bright, and tears were streaming down her cheeks.  She gripped Harry’s face, much as she had in Harry’s quarters, when he’d nearly passed out, and touched her forehead to his.  “Thank you, thank you,” she said quietly.
“Oh, Harry, it’s not your fault,” Hermione started, the condescending tone putting Harry’s teeth on edge.  “With your upbringing, it’s no surprise that you are still experiencing trauma from your own abuse.”
He was relieved when 8:00 arrived, and he could step through the floo to the Malfoy’s.  He looked around quickly, his heart settling a little when he spotted the familiar blonde curls bent over a chessboard.  Draco was sitting opposite her, watching her as she contemplated her next move.
“That’s the best part,” he said, and she snuggled into his side and told him all about the things she’d seen in the Castle the day before.
“The edges of everything, Harry.  You have friends, and that’s wonderful, and you have a job you love, and so is that, but who do you share yourself with?”
“When I wasn’t her Dad anymore, I didn’t have anything left.  Being a parent to Cass was the first thing that I ever wanted so much that I took it.  Without asking, yes, and that was unfair, but it was the first time I had ever wanted something for myself more than I wanted to please other people.  I justified it to myself, saying that I’d never get caught.  That I could steal her away, and she would be just mine, and I’d never have to admit to you that I took from you.”
“No,” she says, but she’s not looking at me.  “I can’t say I’m shocked, though.  There has been a lot of ill will towards anyone affiliated with Voldemort and his lot, since the War ended.”
“Listen, you git, Harry spoke up for you during your trials.  He kept your mum out of Azkaban, and he’s the one who insisted that you be taken on as potions consultant to the Aurors.  He never asked you for a single thing in return.  He saved your life, Malfoy, and this will wipe the Life-Debt clean.”
And yet.  Harry wanted to see him.  Draco longed to be himself again, whole, like he’d been before his terrible sixth year, when the stresses of his tasks had finally twisted his mind.  Before the eventual defeat of the Dark Lord had made him realize that his every action had terrible consequences, and that he wasn’t the man he’d thought he was.  Before he resolved, with no doubt whatsoever, that his judgement was so flawed that he couldn’t be trusted.
“Master Harry is not remembering Kreacher’s name?”  See?  He does look hurt.  My first day as a slave owner, and I’m already fucking it up.
“I wonder,” I say, going to the floo and calling to the Granger-Weasleys.  “Hermione, you’re a solicitor, right?”
Harry smiled wider.  “Of course they would.  I haven’t told anyone that I’ve been in touch with you, not Luna, who’s taking care of Malcolm, or Ron or Hermione, but they trust me.  It’s been a long time, Draco.”
“Most days,” she says.  “We all hate when August comes, because everyone gets their Hogwarts letters, and then the lineup is down the street.  It’s hard though.  Being a family-owned business, we’re pretty much always here.”
Harry had watched the exchange with curious, wary eyes, and when Kreacher had disappeared back to Grimmauld place, Harry examined Draco from behind a slice of toast that he was nibbling.  “You clean a lot,” he remarked.
Harry can’t stop the laugh that rings harshly from his throat.  “Ironic, isn’t it, that Snape has been the most reliable parental figure in my life, and he hated me from the first moment he laid eyes on me.”
“How did your family manage?” Draco didn’t seem disdainful of his relatives at all, merely desperate for a solution.
“Malfoy, wait!”  Draco was leaving the Ministry of Magic at a hefty pace, terrified that if he lingered too long that someone would change their mind, and he’d be placed in Azkaban along with his Father.  He turned at the sound of his name, only to find Potter, running up behind him, clutching something in his outstretched hand.
“Yeah.  She’s screwed.  One of our friends, Blaise, left England as soon as the war ended, and became a solicitor in Italy.  He’s been trying to get back to try to do something to mount a defense, but his portkey applications keep getting lost or misfiled.”
“I believe so, yes.  The approval process is a two-stage one.  If you receive first stage approval, I’ll meet with the Muggle Doctor who is leading the trial, and, if the meeting goes well, you can proceed with all of the testing required to ensure that Scorpius is a good candidate.  After that’s taken place, we can grant stage two approval, which will allow us to create the necessary agreements.  The Doctor will need to have his knowledge of the Magical world obliviated when the trial is completed, and he’ll need to agree to that.  He’ll also need to agree to share his results with our teams at St. Mungo’s.  The approval process isn’t a quick one, I’m afraid, but I’ll do everything I can to fast-track it.”
Draco considers getting offended, or dressing Grace down for insubordination, but he merely says, “It isn’t like he’s seriously asking.”
The Ministry is, as I should have predicted, a madhouse.  Draco learns right away that they’ve called an emergency session of the Wizengamot, and that Kingsley will be testifying as to his involvement in the conspiracy.  The Atrium is packed with reporters, employees and citizens, and when they see us, the chatter rises to a roar as everyone seems to clamour for a statement from us both.  I start elbowing my way through the crowd, but Draco casts a much more effective spell that pushes people back by a few feet and clears a path to the lifts.
“Harry?  Are you ready to start to name some of the themes that have guided your behaviour over your life, and how they prevent you from achieving your goals?”
The club is packed, even though it has to be after midnight.  The doorman takes one look at me and lets me in with a surprised nod, even though I’m pretty sure everyone else is giving him money.  Maybe I’m a regular here.  I slip through the crowd, and onto the dance floor, which is writhing with bodies.  I feel the thump of the bass in my chest, down to my toes, and I start to move to the beat.  I’m just getting into it when I feel a presence behind me, a solid chest that presses up against my back.  I undulate my hips backwards, and a pair of lithe, but strong, arms grip my shoulders and turn me around.  He’s nice looking, a bit slimmer and taller than I am, and he gives me a look of startled recognition.  I really must come here a lot.  He’s still holding my shoulders, so I loop my arms around his waist, drift closer.
He laughs.  “We don’t all dress like we’re homeless, Potter.”  He looks me up and down.  “Although, it seems that someone finally taught you how to buy clothing that fits you.”
Draco grabs his arm, and they’re both crying and kissing.  With a little giggle, Harry pulls away.  “Baby? Your mouth tastes awful”  He casts a freshening charm, and they’re laughing and crying.  Draco pulls Harry down onto the bed.  They’re frantic, clothes being tugged off with urgency and still they’re kissing and tasting and biting.  Draco tries to remove Harry’s t-shirt but it gets tangled around their heads and even still, neither can bear to allow their lips to part, so they leave the shirt tangled around Harry’s neck while they pull off pants.  Harry’s lying on top of Draco, elbows propped around Draco’s head on the pillow.  It’s all he can do to make sure that their skin is touching as much as possible.  He grinds his cock against Draco and he releases a strangled sound through their entwined lips.   A few moments of desperate frottage, and they’re both coming.  Harry howls as his seed flies all over Draco.
“So you’re suggesting that you simply substitute the judgement of your Father, for that of someone else?”
Ron quickly sent a Patronus to his boss, and then they searched the house, but to no avail.  Harry and Ginny were both gone.  Ron apparated to Harry and Ginny’s flat, but returned with a shake of his head a few minutes later.  “No sign of them.”
“If I leave this up to you, Harry’s going to reach his proper age on his own, through passage of time, while you ‘check your numbers’, Draco.”  Hermione’s voice was filled with laughter, but her face was serious.  “Why are you so hesitant?”
“Draco.  Don’t be a fool.  If you allow Harry to return to Canada without telling him how you feel, you’ll spend the rest of your life regretting it.”
Nodding to himself, Harry returned to where his daughter was sitting on her bed, watching him thoughtfully.  He pulled her into a tight hug, stroked her curls, kissed her forehead.  “I love you, little duck,” he said.
“Indeed.” Severus narrowed his eyes, and heaved an enormous sigh.  “Harry Potter, you listen to me now, because I will be unlikely to repeat myself.  The child that sleeps upstairs is a remarkably well-adjusted and happy little girl.  Her childhood has been as joyful as yours wasn’t.  She is safe, and healthy, and intelligent, and, most shockingly, likeable.  You’re an excellent father, Harry.  You are not failing her.”
Harry was blushing, and it was so poignant that Draco wanted to prostate himself at Harry’s feet, beg for forgiveness.  Instead, he simply said, “Hi Harry.  Did you have a good week?”
Draco nodded, feeling absolutely wretched.  “Draco, I understand why you decided to leave, even though I’m pretty sure I’ll never be able to love anyone ever again.”  That strangled noise left Draco’s throat unbidden again.  “What really fucking annoys me is the fact that you just made the decision without talking to me about it.”
The journey to the Auror offices doesn’t take long, but I don’t say much on the walk.  I’m deep in thought.  My intuition is telling me that there’s more to the story than Kingsley’s letting on.  As we arrive at the large, open concept office that houses the Auror Corps, I immediately notice something.  There are young people working here, but there are also a lot of people who are older than me.  Surely there’s someone who’s more suitable amongst these experienced people.  At twenty-five, I can’t possibly be the most qualified candidate.  Also, I can’t imagine why I’d want to do this.  Surely I deserve a quiet life after all the shite I went through.  Can’t someone else stabilize the world?
“Hermione is brilliant,” she continues.  “She knew from her first day on the train that she’d be discriminated against because of her heritage.  And she’s brave.  She faced the hatred head-on, and she met their eyes, and she advocated for sentient creatures who didn’t have the same rights.  She wouldn’t be part of discrimination like that, Harry.  She just wouldn’t.”
“Draco,” I say, stepping closer and putting a hand on his arm.  “I want to help you, but I can’t, not if you don’t tell me what’s going on.”
As the night progressed, more people arrived.  The group at the kitchen island finally figured out that the blender needed to be plugged in to work, but didn’t realize that the pitcher needed a lid.  The ensuing shower of sticky orange drink covered the kitchen and its occupants.  Everyone was in hysterics.  Pansy was draped around Seamus and Dean, tears rolling down her cheeks as Dean licked a stripe of orange from her forehead.  This unexpected group had an easy-going manner about them, reminding Draco of the after-game parties that had formed with his team.  He felt simultaneously excluded and homesick for the Wolves.  Although, in fairness, during the off-season, there weren’t many Wolves to find, as most of them had summer jobs that required their attention.  Minor hockey paid pitifully, and the landscaping and golf course jobs kept them afloat during the season.  Draco himself was a coach, coaxing tiny little helmet-clad toddlers to shakily make their way across the ice, and running drills with future minor leaguers who would someday take his place on his team.
Hermione has been sitting at the same spot at the table since she arrived.  An untouched cup of tea sits in front of her, and Harry has replaced it with fresh, hot brew three times.  She is holding her wand, he notes, her knuckles white, her arm shaking.  Harry isn’t at all surprised when she leaps from her chair like an explosion, and stomps out to the balcony.  Ron makes a wounded sound, and half raises from his chair, but Harry meets his eyes, and in the practiced exchange of glances they’ve developed over the past seven years, they agree that Harry will go.
“Who knows?  Anyway, that didn’t make her nearly as mad as she got when I told her I was in love with someone else.”
Cass’ eyes were enormous, filled with fear and sadness.  Draco wondered how to explain.  She was a little girl, and for her, the world was still dark and light with no twilight in the middle.  She hadn’t yet been exposed to the cruelty of life, the pain that exists in the hazy grey in between right and easy.
“We thought we’d come downstairs and see you,” Hermione said cheerfully.  “Harry, can you say hi to Draco?”
“Draco, don’t,” she warns.  “He needs to face justice for this.  If you kill him, the rest of the people who are responsible will go unpunished.”
“Oh,” Draco said, unsure how to answer.  “Well, we didn’t want to worry anybody, so we’re keeping you here as a secret.”
“Is it dangerous?” Weasley asked, the first thing he’d said since arriving. “What’s on Harry, anyway?”
With the morning comes resignation, of a sort.  Draco grieves the end of his family’s bloodline with dignity (which really just means that he doesn't discuss it at all), and has turned his mind toward the practical.  “It’s not as though the Malfoy name is anything to be proud of anymore, and he could do a blood adoption if he really wanted to,” he reflects over his breakfast toast.  Scorpius seems unharmed, aside from the sterilization.  He sits opposite me at the table and seems delighted with the world, as a house elf feeds him disgusting-looking cereal and he grabs everything that comes into his reach.
Pureblood funerals are…involved, Harry realizes.  The next three days pass in a haze of ceremony, and specific outfits, and politeness.  Harry hates it, but he is a solid presence for Draco, instinctively knowing when to enter a conversation and use his notoriety to distract some snobby old witch away from his friend.  Ron keeps Hermione occupied, and away from Harry by educating her on all of the traditions, and Harry is grateful for her distraction.  Neville is a godsend, as he talks Harry through the rituals and keeps him from committing any newsworthy faux pas.  Harry doesn’t give a fig about whether the press catches him doing something embarrassing, but he cares about Draco, and genuinely liked Narcissa, and so he’s glad that her memorial is dignified, just as she’d have liked.
After the guests had all departed, and the House elves had completed tidying up, Harry found himself gratefully nursing a fire whiskey on a comfortable sofa.  Cass and Scorpius had been persuaded to bed, the novelty of sleeping at Grand-Mère’s the only bargaining tool that had gained their compliance.  Astoria had gone home, with a promise to catch up with them the following evening.  She’d been neglecting her clients, she’d explained, but looked forward to seeing Harry and Cass soon.  Narcissa too, had excused herself to bed, Lucius having been banished shortly after dinner, when his creative explanations of Wizarding history had been deemed too impolitic to allow to continued unchecked.  It was just Harry and Draco now, and the silence loomed, uncomfortable.
Harry felt tears welling up in his eyes.  He didn’t deserve their concern.  He’d let them all down, run away again, abandoned his daughter.  “Harry, let’s focus on what you can expect here over the next little while.”
“Hi Dad,” Cass was shy around him now, and the tentative note in her voice caused Harry’s smile to wobble a little.
“I suppose that’s true.  I didn’t thank you.  I don’t think I would have gotten through this without you.”
Harry nodded.  “It does.  I think it’s a good way to give him an understanding of many cultures.  Do you like his school?”
Later that evening, Draco stood in Scorpius’ doorway, watching his son in slumber.  His tiny rosebud mouth was wide open, and he was snoring deeply.
“I am.”  It had never come up before in their sessions, and, before Hermione, he’d never told anyone. His Father would be horrified.  But, his Father was locked in Azkaban.  Lucius had made so many terrible choices, and had put Draco and his Mother in danger.
“Wendell may be on to something, Potter.  I think you might be showing signs of latent Dark Lordiness.”
“That’s a good question, Scorpius, and one that I’m here to help you work out.  I don’t have the right answer, not right this minute, but I promise that I’ll help you sort things out.  For now, the important thing is to make sure that you get better.”
“Seriously?  You don’t already have something for me?  Usually you pick out my gifts months in advance!”
Hermione arrives, Ron in tow, late that afternoon.  I don’t look at her.  Ron seems awkward, but grasps my shoulder and says, “Alright, mate?”
Eventually, his tears run dry, and Draco stands, holding out an arm to help Harry to his feet.  “I think I might actually sleep after all that,” he says in wonder.
Draco stepped through the door, and with a calculating gaze, took inventory.  Rose petals, lavender, Irish moss, feverfew.  And, a tiny vial of nearly-empty Ashwinder eggs.  He gave a short nod to Ron and Hermione, and Ron called out, “Hey George?”
And Lara seemed to decide to poke that particular Hippogriff later, because she moved the conversation smoothly along to Draco’s compulsions.  Draco was surprised to realize that he really hadn’t been indulging them much over the past week, but he figured that potion-making and all the arithmancy, and taking care of Harry had used up a lot of his normal compulsion time.
He sighs.  “I don’t think anything will be enough, really.  Scorpius’ life has been altered, no question.  This will affect his marriage prospects, amongst those who care about bloodlines and such.  It’s not that I care, really, but…” he trails off and looks up at the ceiling.  I understand immediately.  Narcissa Malfoy will care.  In truth, I’ve barely seen her since Draco and I have exiled within the wards of Malfoy Manor, and she’s been coolly polite each time, excusing herself nearly immediately.  She’s taken every meal in her quarters since the breakfast we shared.  Resolving to deal with that problem another day, I return to the matter at hand.
“And if I don’t?  Is someone else intervening?”  He looks away again.  “Damnit, Draco, what’s going on?”  I’m frustrated, and I take a step closer to him.  The angry expression on his face falters for a moment, but returns in force as his grey eyes meet mine.
Sorry guys, this is a bit of a short one, but it otherwise would have broken stuff up funny.  It's entirely possible that I'll feel guilty about this and post another chapter mid-week.
A healer, summoned by the monitoring charms, bustled in.  “Good morning, Cass.  How are you feeling?”
Andromeda laughed outright.  “Nice?  I’m not certain that there’s anything nice about maintaining the Black family legacy.  Or the Malfoy one, for that matter.”
“No!  Please, could you just let me…Alright.  After the war, the cumulative trauma started to take an effect on you.  You were an abused child who never learned to depend on adults to keep you safe.  Once you came to Hogwarts, that pattern continued.  And you lost people.  So many people, Harry, and every single person who died during the war weighed on you like an anchor.  You carried an incredible amount of guilt, and obligation.”  Her breath hitches again, and she continues, talking fast.  “Ron and I watched you grow from this wide-eyed child, who was fascinated by a world that gave you magic, and friends, and a purpose to…a man who carried that purpose on his back.  The war changed you, changed all of us, but you were determined that nobody would ever die on your watch again.”
against the rules, but if his magical vows allowed him to speak, it couldn’t be too bad.  “I haven’t seen Draco in years.”
“How about this,” Draco said, realizing that they were going to continue peppering questions at one another, not bothering to properly answer each other.  “You can look at your robes and wand, and then you will answer some questions honestly for me, okay?”
She was so like Harry, standing there, her emotions all over her expression, but trying so hard to keep herself contained.  She wouldn’t come to him, he realized, but she desperately needed him to cross the expanse to her.  He slowly approached, and her eyes were wary.  He’d asked, “Can I hug you, Darling?”  Stiffly, she’d nodded, and he’d gathered her into his arms.  Then, the floodgates opened, and she'd sobbed like the child she was.
“Of course I am.  Thank you for your help.  Do you think that one of you could get up with Harry if he wakes up?”
“Partially,” I allow, “but something tells me that my strengths are in the field.  From what I can tell, I rely on others for the strategic thinking, and succeed because of a lack of self-preservation and dumb luck.”
Finally, he spoke.  “I don’t,” he said seriously.  “I don’t regret it at all.  I call magical abilities a gift, because that’s truly what I believe that they are.  It changed my life, if I were to lose my magic somehow, I would feel like I had a hole inside of me.”
“Really?” His face is suddenly joyful, and Draco can’t take another moment of watching this unfold before his very eyes.
“Your opinion is noted.” I say, and my voice is stiff.  “Thank you for your help to this point, but I’ll sort myself out from here on.”
“Good,” Cass said.  “Okay,” she amended.  “I miss my Dad, though.  He’s not coming back when he said he would.”
“In a minute.”  Cass pulled his arms tighter around herself, and Harry relished the contact.  He wasn’t sure how long he’d have the opportunity in the future.
“Nope.  And I could get fired, or maybe sent to Azkaban.  But if I can get her to tell me who she’s getting the potions from, or where she hides them, I could get the evidence, and then get Hermione to memory charm the illegal stuff away from me and Gin.”
Narcissa completed her telling with a compliment guaranteed to please Harry.  “Harry, you must be awfully proud of Cass.  She’s so mature.”
Returning the file was easy, although the fellow in the Auror Administration Office gives me the willies.  He watches me with a hungry, acquisitive air.  I purposely keep the small talk small, and Mill and I escape painlessly.  As I say goodbye to her, it occurs to me that this society is completely fucked up.  I might be better off just going and living in some cabin in the woods somewhere.
“Is it?  He explained how house elf magic works, and how their magic increases by being bonded to a home, and its wizards.  I offered to free him, and he cried.  Just seems like he deserves a bit of agency to decide for himself.”
“The potion that makes you look like someone else, yes.  Anyhow, they take the Polyjuice and they sneak into the bank, and ride the cart, and go into the vault.  The evil Bellatrix does not like to share!  She makes all of her treasures fool the best friends, and burn them.  They look and look and find the goblet!  But!  Just as they’re leaving, they hear a terrible noise!  It’s a dragon!  And it’s so mad, Uncle Harry, and it’s just about to eat them.  The Goblins try to scare it away, but it gulps them down!  And so the three friends, who need to escape to go get the bad wizard and stop him, decide to rescue the dragon!  The dragon has been underground for so long, his eyes are tired and sick, and so he can’t see!”  Here, she covers her eyes and gives a sad growl.  I try not to crack up.  “They jump on the dragon’s back, and it flies up, up, up in the sky, and through the ceiling!  Crash!  And they’re free! And the dragon is so happy that he’s free that they all go swimming in a lake.  And that,” she finishes with a satisfied smile, “is the story of the dragon.”
“Right?  That’s what I would have expected too!”  In my relief that someone else agrees that this is odd, it takes me a minute to interpret the knowing smirk that has crossed his face.  “Oh, stop,” I chide.  “Not because I think I’m special or anything, but it just seems strange that one minute, Kingsley is talking about my imminent appointment to Head Auror, which sounds dead boring, for what it’s worth, and then the next minute, he’s brushing off the fact that I’ve forgotten every memory I have, save a few outliers.  He’s talking about putting me in intensive remedial training, and nobody seems to care that one spell can rob someone of their whole life!”
“No,” he protested.  “I want this for her, I do.  She deserves to know them.  They deserve to know how amazing she is.”  He rubbed the back of his neck.  “I’m just being a bit childish.  Feel a little left out.  Never had to do this before, yeah?”
, Draco.  I can’t be safe if I don’t know.  The truth is always more important, because then we can work together to stay safe.”
“That’s yew,” Madame replied.  “Good wand for healers, necromancers.  A resilient wood, a wand for rebirth, change.  This wood is used to light the Beltane fire.  The holder of this wand will shed the world of old pain, and welcome a new dawn.”
Draco is disgustingly drunk.  His shirt is halfway unbuttoned, and his hair bears evidence of someone running their hands through it.  Somehow, he’s lost a shoe.  “Harry,” he whispers urgently.
And that was why, the next morning, Draco found himself in a set of carefully tailored robes, standing by the breakfast table next to a weeping Scorpius.  Draco’s son almost never cried, even when being subjected to the most painful medical procedures.  Today, however, his grey eyes looked at Draco pleadingly, and his bottom lip trembled.
“Um, yes, Draco, I’m fine.”  Harry seemed to understand the crippling need behind Draco’s question.  Somehow, he intuitively knew that Draco needed to be reassured.  “See Draco?  Look at me.  I’m fine, I’m here talking to you, and I’m smiling at you, look.  Do you see me smiling?”
“I’m sure it’s taken some time for business to pick back up, since the Alley has reopened, but I have every faith in your continued success.  I’d like to invest in your company.”
count the sixty seconds.  Do you think you could challenge yourself to simply wait for about as long as a minute or two
I’m grateful for the support, but there’s a part of me that secretly hopes that there’s a simple explanation for this.  That somehow, I misheard Draco.  That he didn’t actually say ‘my son,’ in that resigned, defeated voice.  I shrug.  “So should I reply to this guy?”
The woman’s shoulders stiffened.  “I could take her away,” she said, her voice low and harsh.  “I could take her away from you people and all of this.”
There’s a naming ceremony for Pansy’s son next week, and Harry doesn’t know what to do.  “Think they’ll notice if I don’t come?”
“Why did we bother fighting a war, Hermione?”  I bang my fist on the table and she jumps.  “Sorry,” I say hastily, “but it’s true.  If we’re just going to replace their prejudices with ours, what’s the point?”
Scorpius looked down at his knees.  He worried the hole in his pants, ripping it a little, and then a fat tear rolled down his cheek and dropped onto his thigh.  “I did magic again,” he said softly, and then let out a little sob.
A few pages later, there’s a picture of a much tinier Ron, Hermione and myself.  We’re grinning widely and our arms are slung around one another.  I look closely at my face, wondering what I was thinking about.  I look chuffed to be hanging with my best mates, but it’s clearly at least first year, so I was already being hunted by a madman.  I think I see a tightness in my expression, around my eyes, but maybe I’m projecting.
“He’s alive, Draco, safe at St. Mungo’s.  He’s been injured, and the Healers are looking him over, but I think he’ll be fine.”
To those of you who wanted to bounce Draco's head off of the nearest wall for just being so fucking CLUELESS and STUPID and oh god, Draco just use your head and your WORDS for once, I hope that his character arc has been a satisfying one for you too.
Draco retreated with his drink to a safe-looking corner, hoping to figure out just what the fuck was going on here.  It seemed that Blaise and Pansy had somehow become friends with Hannah Abbott.  And Neville Longbottom, of all people, who had his hands wrapped around Hannah in a decidedly non-platonic way.    He noticed Seamus whats-his-name from Gryffindor, and the guy that was always with him, Dean?  And in the other corner, nursing a bottle of Muggle beer, quietly watching him…was Gregory Goyle.  When he met Draco’s eye, he raised his bottle in silent tribute, then took a long swallow.  Draco raised his own cup and drank, wondering just how this group ended up together.
One little boy seemed to be an oasis in the storm.  He was carefully holding something that appeared to be wriggling in his hand, and watching the chaos unfold.  Harry quickly transfigured his outfit into a Police uniform, and strode into the fray.  “Excuse me,” he said calmly, “we were called for a noise compliant.  Is anything the matter?”
most recent hit stuck in his head for the past three days, and his kitchen had taken violently against his coffeemaker again, but on the whole, things were good.  He had a job he loved, he had friends who truly cared about him, and nobody had made a credible attempt to take his life in over ten years.  Harry felt like he could finally say that he was in a good place.
She’d refused to speak to him, and said that if he came through to the Burrow, she’d go somewhere else.  She was going to her Dad, whether anyone helped her or not.  Draco had begged Molly, tears streaming down his face, to let him through, but she’d extended her hand through the flames and patted his hand.  “Draco, dear,” she’d said.  “I know how worried you are, but I’ve raised seven children, not including Harry.  She needs a little space, and she needs to see that her Dad is okay.  Let me get Hermione for you, and you can discuss arrangements.”
“We agreed that I’d be allowed an exception on very emotional days.  This counts,” Harry argued.  He kissed the top of her head.  “Let me look at you.”  Cass spun in a circle, her Hogwarts robes billowing behind her.  “Oh yes, you look a proper little swot already.  You know that you’ll be on the train for hours, right?  You don’t need to wear your robes until you’re close to arriving.”
Harry promptly bursts into tears.  “Yes.  Fuck.  Yes, Draco, I’ve been so miserable, and I thought I’d never get any better.  I-  Yes.  Yes, I’ll have you.”
“That’s the problem.  Before you lost your memories, you didn’t want anything to do with me.  You were, ostensibly, straight, and with Ginevra Weasley, and would have likely hexed me if I even tried to talk to you.”
Draco wondered for a moment if her easy forgiveness would be rescinded once she realized that they were going after her daughter, but gave her a weak little smile.
“I do,” Draco replied.  “The staff there is inclusive, and Scorpius has been happy there.  Maybe a little less happy this year.  He's had more conflict, he's come home with stories of mean children occasionally.  Once he told me that the Head Teacher didn't like him.  I'm not sure how much of it is normal for his age, versus actual issues.  His teacher says he does well, though.”
Grace blows her bright blue hair out of her eyes and gives him a petulant look.  She’s only a few years younger than Draco, but some days, it feels like he’s an entire generation older than her.  Her eyes roll, hard, and she says, “See what you want, I suppose.”
“It makes sense, given how angry his scar looks,” Granger added.  “and feel free to call me Hermione.”
“Hermione’s enacting a getaway plan,” Harry says, his grin lighting up his features as though he's just discovered happiness.  He drapes the snake around Draco’s shoulders and comes back to wrap his arms around Hermione.  “‘Mione.  I love you so much.  You are…you…”
Floo travel hadn’t really improved in the years Draco has been absent.  He stepped through the grate feeling more dizzy and disoriented than he had in his drawing room.  The word ‘Grimmy’ had sparked a vague sense of unease, but Draco passed it off as nerves and floo travel. The living room that he entered was spacious, with squashy couches, and a riot of house colours.  The drapery was a rich Gryffindor red, while the carpeting, a bold Ravenclaw blue.  The couches were green, Slytherin-coloured, and a number of battered yellow throw cushions and beanbags were scattered around, a nod to Hufflepuff.  “Wow,” Draco said, his nausea somehow enhanced by the violent eruption of colour.
“I’m sorry, Kreacher,  I didn’t remember anything, not even important stuff like…house elves. Not Ron or Hermione, or…anyone.”
Malfoy smiled at his son, who was looking hopefully between them.  “Well, you’re right that I don’t require any assistance in getting home, but I think Scorpius would be very pleased if you joined us for tea?”
Hermione and Ron looked at one another and laughed.  “Remember what I said Draco?  We don’t plan anymore,” Hermione said, through her giggles.  “Harry pointed out once that we plan, and then it all goes to crap anyway, and we just blunder through.  The appeal of planning rather wore off after that.”
“Yes,” he answers, and I marvel at his ability to sound smug while all dreamy and stupid-sounding from the potion.
I suspect that old me would be so incensed at how the recent turns of circumstance have affected Draco’s family, that I’d be tirelessly doing…something, to try to fix it.  Instead, I lay on the floor on the other side of Draco.  Scorpius, tucked under his opposite arm, has drifted off to sleep.  “I don’t think I want my memories back,” I say.
“Okay,” Harry said.  “It’s fine.  I wasn’t kidding about having to go back and settle some things.  We left in a bit of a hurry, and I need to make sure the house is still standing and find someone to take care of it, finish a few wands that I’ve promised to clients.  Would you be willing to be here on your own for a little bit?”
“Then that brings us to the end of our time together, Draco.  As always, I’m available for consultation by floo as needed.  I’d like you to keep your journal, and pay particular attention to the way you’re framing things.”
Mill laughs again.  The lifts have spat us out onto a long corridor, and she’s leading me along as we talk.  “You aren’t a dumbass.  You care too much, you throw yourself in front of danger to protect others.  You’re also shockingly lucky, so that helps.”
Ensconced in the warmth of Ron and Hermione’s little cottage, their daughter Rosie toddling around him, Harry starts to emerge from the fog that’s surrounded him since Draco left him.  Harry practices telling himself:
So he’s surprised when, at a picnic that he’s managed to convince Minerva to allow him to host at Hogwarts, Luna sits next to him expectantly.  He’d been, as had become his custom, sitting off to one side, watching his friends and family playing in and around the Black Lake.  The squid is delighted to have the company, and it waves a lazy tentacle in the direction of George and Charlie, who are launching off of one another’s shoulders and cannonballing under the surface.  The children are running around screaming.  Molly is fussing over the picnic baskets, which, Harry knows, have been stocked with never-ending food, coming directly from the kitchens.  Teddy is aloft the new broom Harry bought him, tentatively trying to do a loop.  Luna’s gaze is uncharacteristically sharp, and instantly Harry knows what’s coming.  “Luna,” he says warningly.
