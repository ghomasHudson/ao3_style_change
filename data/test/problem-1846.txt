"You scratch my back, I scratch yours. Yeah. I'm really sorry, mate," Ron said, and it sounded genuine. Harry closed his eyes again, and this time, before he'd opened them, Ron's lanky, broad body was enveloping him in a hug.
"No, that would have been before Hogwarts," Draco said. He smiled absently. "It's actually quite a good story."
A hush went over the table, which made Harry want to laugh because that was by far the least interesting of his news for the night.
"Erm, well, lucky you, I know a spell to deal with this. Here," Harry gingerly removed Malfoy's hand from his shoulder and took a step back, the calm of distance clearing his head immediately. He flicked his wand at himself.
"Nothing that can't be dealt with tomorrow," Harry hedged his answer, and then let his head fall back, eyes closed against the warm orange glow of the fire blasting in the grate. The room was uncomfortably hot, and in combination with the warmth of the rug, he wished he were naked, between cool sheets, and on his way to sleep already. "I'm just tired," he added.
Harry wasn’t looking at her at all, though. He caught sight of the domes of feet under thin waffled hospital blankets. Something panged in him. Longing, muffled, but there.
"Sure you do," Ron frowned at his empty drink and grabbed Harry by the arm to drag him back to the bar. "Here, help me get a fucking round and bring these over and stop your scowling." He leaned over the bar, yelling, "Oi! Harry Potter down here, and he's mighty thirsty," which had the beneficial effect of getting the bartender to look at them and walk over, and the negative of every other set of eyes within 50 paces doing the same.
"You decided," Malfoy speaking over Harry, "on your own mode of dress to sleep in and, for whatever reason, promptly banished the majority of your clothes. Which is both when and why you lost wand privileges."
Draco continued to look as calm as the surface of a frozen lake. Harry could strangle him but read between his lines too. Today had been hard for him, but he refused to stay home and hide when that would look like guilt incarnate. So he'd come, and held Harry's hand, and sat with his head held high, and done what he'd needed to keep the facade up.
"Stop. I want you." The words tumbled out from someplace, sounding just like his own voice. Draco pulled his fingers free from the vice of Harry's arse.
His heart rate spiked, even though he was only touching the fawn-coloured leather of driving gloves. He wished it wouldn't do that.
"Maybe that's the version of me that you know," Draco whispered into his neck. "I've been known to be a pushover and a coward, but I'm glad you think I've changed my spots."
A pull at the string flicks the filament in the bare bulb on, and immediately there is the thundering of footsteps overhead, stomping faster, closer, and Draco squares his jaw and tightens it to keep from screaming when the swinging light reveals Harry, arms hugging his knees close, his eyes the same at ten as they are at twenty.
Draco nodded, placing a quick hand at his chest and a frozen peck to Harry's cheek as he stepped inside, spelling the bit of snow collected on his boots away.
"Er—" Harry's eyes shot open into a mane of orange obstructing his view of the sky. Ron had gone in for the hug with gusto and held fast, even as Harry struggled out from it.
"Yes. I, er, do. And one of the first obstacles I have to get past is convincing him of that, which will also require me being able to say it without throwing up all over myself."
"The ill-informed shagging, yes, how could we forget that. Oh! And the silence that’s followed it." Ron’s words landed and lodged deeper into his skin than Harry let on. It had hurt doubly to still feel the twinge of Draco having been inside his body when he sat astride his broom that morning and not a word in the interim. The words
“You need to trust that I’ve got your back or this will never work.”Malfoy—he was still Malfoy, then—more serious at twenty than he’d be at thirty.
"Yeah, well. January's my big chance to get away." Harry drained his beer, wishing that he could get away immediately to see the time inscribed on the coin. What if it was for right now, right this second?
Malfoy blinked. A long moment passed, the only sounds Harry's hard breathing. Malfoy wouldn't stop staring at him.
"I want to see you, Draco," Harry ground out his words. "I want to see you and not be constantly reminded that it's an arrangement."
"I mean, I'm already going that way. If it's not trouble?" He cleared his throat, realizing the waitress was watching them with an overly amused look on her face from across the room. He must be radiating awkwardness.
"Do you..." Harry plucked at Draco's shirt, and Draco gave him a curt shake of his head and spun him around by a hand at his shoulder so that he faced the sideboard, a new addition to the hallway, not so much as looking him in the eyes. Harry's hands didn't fumble as he loosened his trousers and pulled them down along with his pants, his prick falling out, thickening at the promise of Draco's touch.
"Andromeda," he said, "it was Andromeda’s doing. I told her I was seeing someone, someone fantastic. Someone incredible—"
"Everywhere," Draco answered sincerely. "We're going to all my favourite places. Seville, and also maybe Madrid, Istanbul—this isn't in any particular order, mind you—Kyoto—"
"I'm not always as brave as people might like to think," Harry said carefully. "Ask me again in a week."
"I know, Potter," he said before letting loose a deep sigh. For a moment, blink, and you'd miss it, his eyes met Harry's.
"You like that, do you?" Draco murmured, nudging Harry's legs together by tapping at the outsides of Harry's feet with one of his own, pulling his hips back until he was bent over at an easy incline, feet planted one directly next to the other.
"Here," he said, the word exactly as hoarse as he knew it'd be. With a wave of his hand the thick brocade curtains drew open, revealing long, leaded pane windows. The light of the moon was bright enough, touching skin and sparkle alike with a soft white, interrupted by the zig-zags from the thorny rose bush growing up, up towards the third floor. Harry unzipped his trousers as Cissy grabbed his face and angled him to accept her kiss, tongue probing in, taking control of his lips and mouth, owning it. They stumbled until the backs of Harry's knees hit the sofa—tufted, rigid leather, and wide enough to accomplish what he needed it to support—so he sat heavily, Cissy a tangle of limbs on top of him.
Draco made a sound and nudged him forwards, onto his belly. The sounds of birds joyously announcing the break of day filtered in to the room. They'd taken to sleeping with the windows open a crack, and Harry smiled to smell the fresh scents of spring on the air.
"I can't hold your hand?" Harry said with a pout, asking with as much mock sincerity as he could muster. Draco froze before the mask dropped back into place.
Blaise turned and jabbed at the air, a boxer's move, growling. "Yes, the bint. We weren't to—not like this.” He went back to pinching the bridge of his nose. “Well, the kneazle’s sprung from the sack now, no point lamenting that we couldn’t be having this chat over scones instead of here and now. I take it you didn't know?"
good it felt, Draco's fist squelching lube, making a tight hole for the head of his cock to pop through and then spreading the liquid down to the base, and back up again. Harry's face scrunched up as though pained, though he loved the slide of it, Draco's palm and fingers gliding along him like silk.
They all stood in silence, Harry doing his best work, not remembering the moment in any vivid terms. That was then; this was now.
"Yes," Harry breathed the word, and Draco dipped his head to kiss the spot. The softness of his lips was electric, sending tingles down Harry's spine. It reminded Harry of his first time with another man, toe to toe against a parked lorry. Just kissing, but like magic itself had set all the hair on his body on end.
"Malfoy, wait," Harry found himself standing before he knew what he was doing, "my, er, publicist is asking about those glasses. Any chance you have them on you?"
he mouthed the words into a microphone fashioned out of a handful of serviettes. Snow was falling, fat, wet flakes gathering on his shoulders and in his hair. His eyes sparkled, revealing how he felt when he looked at Harry.
"How do I make you feel?" Harry asked. Draco bit his lip, his eyes wet and pleading when he finally looked up into Harry's.
"I don't know what I see in you," Draco said. That he stared at Harry's mouth negated his words, tenfold.
"I started with written invitations, you know, so that even people who'd never visited before could come, and then I just started to wonder why, you know? Why all the secrecy?"
“In my dreams, then,” Draco says, and he’s far away. High on whatever it is that gets him off. It’s not just the pain—he gets plenty of that without Harry’s help at all.
. Harry knew that they couldn’t again, and every second he stood there, leaning against Draco for support was another second Draco would use to humiliate him, and Harry would be left with that cheap feeling, a hollowing out in his stomach and—
The teeth marks from where he bit down into his hand wouldn't fade for an hour afterwards. The slide of Draco into him was delightful, though he soon pulled out and started as he had before, slower this time, tracing the puffy rim of his hole with the pad of a fingertip while mumbling soothing things. Next came his tongue flat against Harry's furled hole, lapping at it, occasionally swiping up his crease. He kept this up for what felt like forever, pulling off to spit and then spread it from Harry's sac up the crease, noisily, wet, obscene. Then he used the very tip of his tongue to swirl around the outer edges of his rim until Harry's cock was dribbling precome down the blanket, and Draco sat back and marvelled at him, using that wet to tug the length of Harry's prick from between his thighs, purring encouragement all the while.
"Tom made a request to her about Malfoy back in the summer, and she assumed it had something to do with you. Then he tells her to keep mum about it, and clever woman that she is, she filed that away for later. Now comes the part you're not going to like." Ron took a deep breath. He didn't shy away from saying it; he'd delivered worse news than this before. "At some point, someone within the Ministry took an interest in tracking where you were as well. More often than not, these tidbits were being passed to the press."
The size of Cissy's smile made her eyes nearly shut, and then she was shaking hair from her face, pushing it up and over, resting one hand on Harry's shoulder as the wet fingers of her right reached behind and found their goal.
But Hermione wasn’t there—she had double-potions Tuesdays, the psychopath, and didn’t bother the long walk to lunch in the Great Hall in between.
"What the fuck.” His words were sharp as he approached, but by the way his shoulders dropped it was clear that seeing Harry relieved some of the tension carried in his body. "Couldn't use the front doors like a regular person? I've been looking all over for you."
"And without the position at the apothecary, you can’t put in for a transfer. You’re saying you’ve been sacked."
Draco shook his head to clear it. "Oh, yes, right. Call everyone together, won't you? It's ready," he said, and then he disappeared back into the room.
"I'm going to the front desk to file my report and if I'm able to make out any colourful words between there and here, I will relieve all of you of your visiting privileges and you'll be welcome to wait for news from home." She eyed Harry. "You've got five minutes before you're back in bed or I'm transferring you out of the ward."
Pansy pursed her lips momentarily, which Harry figured was as close as he'd get to the admittance of cool from a Slytherin.
He walked steadily and entered the toilets, well aware of their layout from previous pub nights. He was three drinks in, buzzed but not yet drunk. Without that liquid courage, he'd have walked straight for the door and sicked up in the street from the stress of it all.
Draco remained quiet, but Seamus wasn’t really looking for an answer. After a fair bit of hesitation and squawking, applause and laughter erupted around them.
"Out with what?" He continued to dissect the crumb of his slice of fudge cake with utmost scrutiny. She scoffed, elbowing the throw pillow at her side into submission.
," Harry gasped, head knocking back into the arm of the sofa. Draco used his fingers to coat the head of Harry's leaking cock with his own spit before curling to make an 'o' for him to slide through. They were connected now at their mouths, locked in a groaning kiss, and where Draco's hair tickled Harry's cheeks and kept getting in the way, and where his hand tugged slickly, and it was perfect, but it also wasn't enough. When Draco leaned back to catch his breath, he left Harry panting.
"Yes," Harry said, his voice rumbling low into Draco's ear as he straddled him again. Jumpers and t-shirts came off in an uncoordinated jumble until Draco’s fingers could roam Harry's bare chest, but he didn't crowd him, didn't card his hair or kiss his neck as he had before. Harry waited, tense beneath him.
Draco sat up to fluff his pillow, resting heavily back onto it, the deep blue of his nails in stark contrast with the white of his hands. Harry stared at them—he had such lovely hands. Pretty even—if they weren't as wide as a vinyl record when stretched, they'd pass for a girl's.
Draco preened. "I know it's good, isn't it? I thought it up." He sipped his drink, little pink tongue on the short red straw and Harry
"Shut up. I just—We're grown now." Harry's eyes darted down again. Was Malfoy not wearing any pants? He wouldn't—
"What about your back?" Harry tinged his tone with misunderstanding like he had no idea that Draco's cock had been leaking precome for long minutes, like his grip in Harry's hair hadn't tightened until it was near-painful.
His fingers were so strong, gripping Harry’s wrist. An excellent partner, Draco. In fifteen long years, his unwavering protection of Harry was above reproach.
, Potter," he continued, eyes focused intently on selecting the perfect sandwich from the pile, "and sugar? That's for coffee, obviously. It's criminal to put it in tea. It's you who should be tried for crimes against wizardkind."
She cracked a broad smile, revealing the gold teeth that Harry envied. Hermione had forbidden him from driving Sirius' motorcycle, full-stop, and this had become his second-best option at having something, anything, cool in his life. He had wished all through Auror training that he'd have a tooth knocked loose if only to have an excellent excuse to request a gold replacement, but people regularly pulled their punches around him, so he'd had no such luck.
The dozen roses wrapped in paper crinkle when Harry tapped them against his leg. He was breaking his own rule about never doing home visits, but the Manor was on his route. He contemplated leaving without saying anything, but Draco cracked an eye open and fixed him in his stare.
"You're still an eminently capable young man. You'll be able to achieve anything you set your mind to, though the timetable won't be what you expected. I'm sorry I don't have better news, and I'd love to be proven wrong. I won't be precious about the likely outcome, and it's that you can expect to have a full life. Only, at an altered rhythm."
That he'd ended up in the white t-shirt Hermione said made his biceps look nice, and the stovepipe black jeans that Reza told him were "the new silhouette," that he felt like he was trying—
Able to see clearly, he ascertained that he was, indeed, alone. Nothing felt broken, and he wasn't chained to anything. A peek under the covers confirmed that he was naked save for his pants and socks.
"Does that mean you cleaned your come out of my mouth too?" Draco asked coquettishly, batting his eyelashes, and fuck if Harry would ever get that image out of his head.
"I think," Draco said with a final daub of his napkin at the corners of his lips, "that we ought to talk about some things. Set some ground rules." He folded his napkin into a neat square, whereas Harry had created a crumpled pile of haphazard mess. Harry swatted at the pile of garbage with his wand, banishing the lot.
Harry was heartsore at the sight of him—Draco Malfoy, endlessly chic, rolling about on the floor of his kitchen in a homely sweatsuit covered in dust and worn, fleecy pink house-slippers that he'd been hiding from Harry all this time making an appearance as he'd rushed about the house. Harry wanted to abandon his work and join him on the floor, press him into the stones, who cared when the guests would arrive?—but he stood and enjoyed the view instead, heart swollen full.
He tugged Draco close as they rounded the corner. It wasn't easy work, side-stepping wide puddles of run-off and garbage juice while trying to look thrilled to do it. Only a dozen steps to go as more shots were snapped, their entire journey down the block having been lit tungsten yellow and halogen white in turn.
Draco nodded, hooking an ankle behind Harry's left leg to hold him close enough to whisper in his ear, "And what do you want, pet?"
Harry directed his smile into his lap while he pushed at his cuticles with nails that, while pitifully short, weren't a complete mess.
Harry wrinkled his nose, let his arm fall off the sofa to his fingertips grazed the carpet, covered in Gillyweed crumbs. Luna had fallen asleep, a soft snore punctuating the conversation. Harry smiled—he was safe here. His lies were taken at face value—he didn't need to protect himself overly much.
"Not taking the bait on that one," Harry outstretched a finger from around his tumbler to point at Draco. "You sound like Hermione when you say that, you know." Draco grimaced, and Harry felt absolutely vindicated in shoving him with his shoulder for it. The touch, though brief, was electric. Magic rippled with anticipation along his skin, tingling, and he wanted more of it. More of the feeling he only got when Draco was around.
"Don't answer that last; I don't care—I'll have Tom arrange to have the electronics, and some of the potions sent round yours. Would you be interested in a sponsorship deal?"
"Who would have thought that I'd be in charge of Harry Potter's Big Gay Adventure," Draco quipped when they arrived at Shinjuku Ni-Chome. The rainbow flags hung from doorways and windows loudly announced that they'd found their intended destination. Harry was dizzy from choice by the time they made it past all the cramped bars and restaurants to find the specific izakaya in a sub-basement that Luna had raved about.
"Of the loser, silly," Draco chided him. Harry frowned, and Draco only smiled wider, swapping to stretch his other hamstring. "In the shower."
“Next Sunday, then,” Draco said, his fingers making quick work of his shirt buttons. “Is that your literal social calendar?”
Harry said, "Choke me please, sir. A five," he knew he’d never forget that moment. The flare of Draco’s nostrils as he exhaled, lust written purely across his face.
, but Harry remained quiet, so he leaned back onto his elbows, took the question seriously, sucking at the last of his tiny squares of bitter dark chocolate.
Harry tugged the chair closer to the edge of the bed. It was a smidge too short, but the seat raised at a tap of his wand. He wasn’t sure if it was Narcissa or Draco who reduced it between visits, and wouldn’t give either of them the satisfaction of asking.
Ron sipped his tea and took a breath. "A couple of hours. Hermione came by around five and you were gone. It's just past seven, now," he anticipated Harry's next questions. "Clearwater's released you. I figure we ought to go back to Grimmauld."
A contented sound escaped him. Harry was happy to run the backs of his fingers over the soft fur beneath him. Physically, he was spent; emotionally, on hiatus. Everything could wait till tomorrow; the dishes in the sink and the detritus of the night on the tables, and the news that had pulled the curtain back on Draco's oldest secret.
When Draco spun out of the way, he flinched, pulling his arms in tightly to his body. Harry saw the look, and it stopped him in his tracks, just as the fire in the hearth shuddered, and the lights dimmed. It was like a wound to either of them had become a wound to the house; it couldn't maintain the bright cheer in the face of the sharp pain Harry felt like a stab to the heart.
"So full," Harry managed, arching his back, leading his sticky cock to rub against the washboard hardness of Draco's abs, a twin pleasure to the one growing inside of him, and he was lost to it. It was slow learning for his body and mind to work as one to welcome the feeling of fullness, even as it threatened to be too much. Draco thrust carefully, and in the mirror, Harry watched as extreme pleasure curled his toes, pleasure that he meted out in waves, not giving in to the urge for frenzy.
He clicked his tongue inside his cheek. "He's been thrilled to fill the daytimes with open studio, instead, though, at least until he can go back."
"Not yet," Draco said, his voice tight, "not fucking yet," he repeated and held himself in place as Harry keened, his back and neck arched at incredible angles, every nerve ending from his brain through his spine and out through his cock screaming to be tipped over that edge. Shivers wracked his body, and they didn't stop, and it was on the edge of painful not to come when everything in him begged to, but somehow, he held on. They were both panting as Harry's lower back met the floor again, Draco lowering along with him.
"I was accepted by the Ministry, by the way. I quite nearly signed the contract, and that's what dredged all this shite up. It's got to do with this," he said, brandishing his burned arm with a look of boredom.
Eventually, he was spent and collapsed where he was, two bodies panting in time. Draco himself seemed beyond recognition or care; both of his knees remained locked over the tops of Harry's shoulders, though the one of the left slid off to the side from the sweat built between them. Harry turned his head to stare at it, folded so casually.
"Nothing." Ron chewed the inside of his lip. "Only that you throw yourself into the middle of things without a lot of looking both ways."
"Oh, come on, Harry!" He crouched, doubled over with his hands on knees, wheezing. "No need for all that," he said, gesturing at the dent left in the sapling’s spine. He winced upon standing, and Harry was glad for it.
"It went well, thanks, can't complain," he answered Arthur, cupping Teddy's tiny chin inside the soft divot of his fist and smiling at him, quietly mouthing, "Now eat your pudding before you make Grandma Weasley sad that you don't like her cooking."
Harry swallowed thickly. He turned to look at Draco and found him staring, a little frown rippling his forehead.
Above his head, Draco's hands were busy unbuttoning his shirt. Harry had never navigated undoing a belt with his teeth before but found it a welcome challenge. He managed to pull most of the leather strap free from the loop, but it wasn’t his most coordinated effort, even he could admit that.
How did I not know this?" Ginny asked Harry, but didn't wait for him to actually reply, a common format of asking questions at the Weasley table. "What did you study?"
"Privacy, you're entitled to. But it's not one secret, Draco. It's a nest. It's a—a network, with you. These things, they're connected, and you can't keep secrets when you're with me. Not really."
"Don't be so demure, darling," Draco drawled. Harry shook his head, eyes trained studiously at his feet—white socks today, matching ones, at that.
"I won't forget it, mind you," Draco continued. He was pretending levity, as though they were only joking. "I wouldn't mind more of where that came from. You want to shag me like I'm a thing you own? Like you own me? Go right ahead."
Generally, Harry found it fun; sometimes, even, depending on the outfit, a little arousing. Today was not one of those days.
"I'm dating Draco Malfoy, and have been more on than off since about September. As you can imagine, he's changed a lot since you last saw or heard of him, and it's, it's—great, really wonderful, and I'm glad to finally feel like I can say that to all of you."
He booked out the back-room to the Leaky Cauldron for Ginny and Neville's return from their holidays, hosting most of Dumbledore's Army and the Weasley clan for a casual evening. It was an overcompensation, and he knew it—going above and beyond to radiate that his relationship with Ginny was healthy and normal and that he wasn't in the least jealous that she'd fallen in love within six months of their breakup, gotten engaged within another three.
Harry continued staring at Ron, really letting the weight of his displeasure be made plain. He had a mulish look, something dark and angry stewing within him too. It would come up, and they'd hash it out soon enough, Harry was sure. He was dickish, and Ron had a short fuse. They both did, really. How'd they'd managed friendship so long was kind of a miracle.
When he looked up, Blaise was so close that Harry could make out the pores in his perfect skin. A chair was summoned, and Harry sank into it, grateful for something sturdy to hold him up.
"You know they're unreliable, and we can only use them to exclude, not include evidence," Ron spoke in low tones. It was as though Harry had disappeared; this was a conversation they'd had before.
"Ah," Draco said. "Come here, please. I've got Pansy and Blaise and Matilda here, and they know too."
"Yeah," Ron heaved a sigh. "He came yesterday for the vigil. Staying the week. Mum's thrilled; Dad can hardly string two words together to say to him. And he's still, well, you know. Percy."
That spontaneous moment, how she knew a touch would calm him; Harry craved that. To be able to touch Draco in public and not have it be a headline, not be political; how could he explain how jealous he was of his friend's easy relationships, outside the public eye?
"You really don't know?" The look she gave Harry finally made all the sense in the world—annoyed and resentful, but under all that was unvarnished, green-eyed jealousy. Draco had been Pansy’s first, and she remained his longest-held friend. And in becoming a part of Draco’s life, Harry had stolen the version of Draco she had relied on from her.
Harry motioned for Draco to raise his arms and soaped under them, shuffling closer, pretending that it wasn't an electric feeling when their cocks mashed together. Draco bit his lip and watched as Harry slathered his stomach and sides, an embarrassment of suds.
"Thank you," he whispered up at the cracked plaster ceiling. The shutters to the cabinets rustled appreciatively. Harry didn't bother correcting the house about who he was thanking.
"Sorry," he mumbled. "Bit strong." He pocketed his wand, flustered and tongue-tied again, though he knew he couldn't stand there staring at his nail-beds all night. He needed to say something quick and witty, a
Harry pressed up to rest on his forearms, confused. He was sure that Draco's words weren't meant to hurt, and yet they did.
"Malfoy," Harry said, reeling back from the grate. A familiar look of mutiny pulled Malfoy's features taut.
"That went well," Draco said as Harry let out an exaggerated yawn. Harry watched as Draco scooted towards the edge of the bed and threw a cashew high into the air. Rocking back, he expertly caught it, hummed happily as he chewed. Harry had long since stopped counting how many cocktail nuts he'd managed to capture in this way, though he continued to watch because he liked to see the long column of Draco's throat exposed each time he tilted his head back to do so.
"T-ten seconds, please. And— thank you," he added. He could feel Draco's smile against his skin before he repositioned so that his pointy jaw was pressed into Harry's shoulder.
, Harry," Parvati pulled him by the arm towards the rickety chair she'd set up in the centre of Luna's living room. "I'm fucking
He ran a hand over Draco's cheek, and it was cold too. Down to where it rested on the cold stone they'd both rolled to a stop on, and it was cold there, cold muck and mud wet against Harry's fingertips.
"Bit out of practice, are we?" Harry said, and Draco’s chuckle sent warmth through him, even as his insides tensed around Harry, making him gasp.
Draco scoffed, slid his hands down the coverlet until they came to the tear Harry had made in the fabric.
"Shhhh." He shushed Harry back until he lay flat again, and Harry had to turn his face away and bite his cheek to keep from writhing around at how
much trouble with her. "Will do. Thanks, both," he added, which was enough to have Tom beaming at him.
He raised a knowing eyebrow to Harry, the first time even a second passed between them that felt truly serious, instead of the never-ending lark that seemed to be how Blaise sailed through life. Harry nodded, refusing to drop his gaze.
"'Tis. I used to be one of those practically hairless gays. When we met, I still was. Thought I had to, to be attractive."
he said and stopped short until the rising tide of pain subsided. He rarely even spoke their names aloud.
Harry looked up to Draco's knowing smirk as the healer retrieved a scroll from the deep pocket of his scrubs and gave it a tap, creating a duplicate, which he handed to Draco.
It was Arthur again asking Harry for that, nodding at the door, and Harry grit his teeth and forced a smile for Hermione, her brown eyes far too kind, and accepted the squeeze to his unfeeling fingers from Angelina, before he turned to the top of the table and nodded. He'd accept his fate, even if it wrung him dry, even if it was a stab wound to the heart he'd only just learned how to let love, really, truly, deeply.
The tiny woman confronting him softened, though not by much. The tension with which her hands gripped her crossed arms loosened, at least.
"You, apparently," Harry said. Draco’s frown turned to something else as he looked briefly mortified.
Harry let his head fall into his hands, trying to shake the feeling of dread off. Roger's was memories of a blistering hot summer day, and of Draco, Draco, Draco.
"I'm sorry I'm like this," he said, head bowed. Harry cupped his chin to pull it up until they saw eye to eye.
The last thing he saw before he fled was Justin's dazzling smile, handsome face a picture of glee. He liked Harry, and Harry was performing according to his wants, and Harry was ever so good at being what people needed, wasn't he?
Harry ran a hand distractedly through his hair and then pressed the button to roll the window down, heart hammering in his chest.
"Not quite," he said with a half-smile. "By keeping me small and making it clear that I wasn't consequential."
Miranda straightened in her seat. "It is being new, sir. Stands for the British Union of House Elf Employees."
; to just be, for a minute. He lay in the grass at the end of the night, staring up as the sky melted to midnight blue, fingers laced together across his chest as he drank it all in as though it were for the last time.
Harry wondered where the sound was coming from, and only after opening his eyes—when did they close again?—and taking in the startled look of Malfoy's face, he realized that the source of the sound was himself.
"Don't talk to me like I'm a child!" He screamed it, and Harry was thankful for the silencing charm he'd put in place just in case and saw all of a sudden the more likely reason for Draco's throat sounding like it had been grated raw. "I'm not some fucking charity case, Harry. You don't get to
"So what they say about you and wandless magic is true then? Show off," Malfoy said. He lit the cigarette with a snap of his fingers, and then pulled his wand out to cast a charm to siphon away the smoke as it rose around him.
"Ron, then, my apologies," Draco conceded as Ron removed his hand. Ron enjoyed his interjection a little too much for Harry's liking, in a playful mood, an impish smile on his face. Harry could practically smell the practical joke waiting for them around the corner and only hoped that it wouldn't be too compromising.
"Ah," she cut him off with a shake of her head. He looked as pale as the night he'd lost a quart of blood to holes punctured by Nagini. "We'll talk about me afterwards. I may not be a very old woman, but I'm an increasingly tired one, and I need to use my energies wisely these days."
"What in the fuck are you doing?" The blond swatted away Harry's hand. His hand, he realized too late, that had reached out without his brain permitting it.
Harry blew out air, the puff rising soft as candy floss, pure white in the air. It was always like this—spectacularly cold and bone-dry on sunny blue-sky days, warm-ish but wet under your collar when the sky blurred under the blanket of clouds. He preferred the cold—everything was easier with a spot of sunlight. And now Ron had come, and he'd ruined it.
That Victoria spoke about these things as though they are of equal importance pushed his headache into migraine territory. Harry smiled graciously. It was probably his most useful skill, this.
overtaking him; half cologne and shampoo and half sweat, all of it unbearably intimate. This was Malfoy's bedroom, a sight he never dreamed of seeing as an adult. He stepped back, looking to the only other door left ajar, leading to what he assumed to be the bathroom.
"No." He sighed deeply and slouched, looked wistfully at the reassembled pile of glass and pottery, a sight not unlike a modern sculpture, heaped as it was. "I’m still in the breaking-things stage."
But no. Ron paced the front hall, speaking quickly to someone on the phone. Giving orders, asking questions, making decisions. Harry could make out his hand shooing him up the stairs, and he realized that for once, everyone wasn't turning to him to make things right. Ron had stepped up, would be his glue for the day or the week or as long as it took to bring Draco home.
"No, it's nothing. It—if I go somewhere Muggle, I've got to be careful that they don't pick me up on radar. I try and avoid the press, so half the time I end up so high that I freeze right through warming charms." The words burst forth, all the annoyance and anger he never had anyone to complain to about launching out of him in a word vomit stream. "The Quidditch pitches, well, don't even get me started. They're more trouble than it's worth with all the security these days, not to mention there's a mole in the fucking Department of Transportation which they
“Well, I—” Draco’s comeback was cut short by a cough that brought tears to wet the spaces between his lashes.
Draco smiled at his food. "I wouldn't call my integration seamless, not by a long shot, Mr Weasley. I had a decent cover story going into the centre in Surrey, of having grown up in a cult, which helped to explain my absolute ignorance of the most basic facets of Muggle life. More importantly, I had a deep willingness to learn. I was ashamed of how narrow-minded I'd been and took the opportunity at a second chance. I knew it was a rare thing."
"Look, I'll never be cross with you for saying it," Harry gestured towards the front room and followed Charlie inside. "I've got to ask though, was there anything else he wanted to say? Cause it's not me he should be passing messages along to."
He expected her to say something about how he was always a nuisance, but instead, she said, "This wasn't your fault, Potter. He's going to be absolutely, utterly fine, and we'll all look like idiots for worrying."
"You did well, pet," Draco continued, and Harry folded his chin down to his chest to look at him again, saw him catch a peanut this time. He chewed it, watching Harry thoughtfully from behind those serpentine eyes. "You've been very quiet," he added, "is something the matter?"
Harry met her eye and held it. A spike of nervousness rose in him that his friends had popped over unannounced and hadn't found him. He'd increased the chances of them popping over with the intention of meeting his mystery lover, now. Well, more than his lover. That he'd spent the night at Draco's—two nights, in fact—and that he hadn't stayed for the sake of an orgasm, what was that? That was serious, that was
He pushed off of the chair, nodded at them as a whole. "Longbottom," he said seriously, then looked at Justin and sighed, clearly unimpressed, "Justin."
"Yes. It's better this way. Don't want to go fucking up things at work or," he covered his face with his hands and laughed coldly, "gods, the idea of telling my mother that I'm seeing you."
He watches the back of Harry’s head and dares to slip his hand over the small of Harry’s waist, fingers like spider legs, crawling up his belly. He presses his palm flat over Harry’s heart and finds it rushing.
crisply the way he now knew Harry liked it. It worked—his cock somehow stiffened further, filling out. Something must have passed over Harry's face because Draco's eyes lit up, recognizing the effect he had on him. Harry’d pay to have Draco talk dirty to him all day if he could.
, leaning against the counter, long legs stretched and crossed before him. "Ten past nine. You thinking about getting out of here?"
Harry tipped back most of the drink on his second go. He was going to need another, and another after that, to make it through the night. He examined the mysterious drink-buyer—he had white teeth and dark, smooth skin, and kept flashing a smile that Harry could find charming. Harry had to hope that his first conversation of the night wasn't with a bigot.
. He had an almost fanatical concern about Kreacher's well-being, and the treatment of house-elves in general, nudging Harry to care too, as though his de-radicalization from the Death Eater's purity mania hadn't left him neutral but had instead planted him firmly in what was seen by pureblooded society as radical, left-wing thought. Harry bit his tongue from saying what he thought regarding this about-face—that this was partially a late-blooming bout of teenage defiance against his parents, and partly fuelled by guilt. Harry was smart enough to keep these thoughts to himself, and honestly, what did it matter, why Draco had come around to reason, to goodness, to the concept of equality?
He sipped his drink, and he must be doing it on purpose, Harry thought. The way he grazed his teeth over the tip of the straw before he pursed his lips to suck, only he couldn't be, this wasn't
"Say it again," Draco said, voice breaking around the words, like watching himself come into Harry's mouth was a sweet torture. "Repeat it, and say 'sir.' Would you do that for me?"
"Sit," he said. "If I were on molly, I'd be liable to agree with you. This isn't the Calming Draught—don't worry. It's the day. It's this place."
. She was warning me that no one would be able to love me with the Mark, and I was too scared to admit it to myself, but for years and years, I did believe it. I didn't just believe it—I knew it. I never wanted it, and I failed to uphold what it meant, and so my parents hated me. But I still have it, right there, black and angry on my skin, and so everyone else hated me too."
Facing Draco wasn't a good idea, he realized, as it made him want to touch him. To taste his lips and make his breaths come raggedly, not smooth. He tentatively moved his hand to rest on top of the blanket, rising and falling with each of Draco's long, sleepy breaths.
"Yours, all yours," Harry said, and Draco was grinding and barely pulling out anymore, pushing as deep as he could, snaking a hand between them to fist at Harry's cock, stiff against his belly. Draco's hand pulled frantically, jerking him to the point of no return.
"I haven’t come since you left, you know." Draco's admission was said in his low, slow voice, and when he slid his fingers from Harry's forehead back to grip into a fistful of his hair, Harry shivered properly, that line of spit hitting his chin. He looked up and knew what a depraved sight he made for Draco—mouth ajar, lips wet, shivering with want and jerking himself for Draco's pleasure. He was panting and opened his mouth wider, made a sound, a begging sound, and Draco smiled down at him, his benevolent master in this, the kind of sex he'd never even dreamed of.
Harry made a noise and nodded, and Draco's look of alarm escalated, somehow, as he went very pink in the face and redoubled his grip on Harry, and kept blathering, only faster now.
of his own and then he was coming, coming, coming, like a rubber band had been holding him back and had snapped, coming into Draco's tight, hot, shaking body for what felt like forever.
"Nothing," he said. "It’s getting late. See you soon, pet." Harry watched, confused and strangely hurt as he walked out the door without a backwards glance. In this way, whatever was happening between them was complicated. They still found ways to break one another, but it was like playing that game
"What's wrong with that?" Neville asked, pulling back. He'd started growing a beard, and Harry was reminded to tell him that it was a good look when he had the chance to later. It suited him and, combined with his thick woollen sweaters, gave him the hearty, hipster-lumberjack look. He seemed right at home in the bar, with its decorative axes and tartan accents and faux-Troll paraphernalia littering the walls.
"Sort of," Harry hedged. He couldn't walk the whole statement back now. But he could attempt some damage control. He wasn't drunk, and yet the word-vomit had come.
Harry scoffed. That was a given; hardly news at all. Irritation flared up, sure as anything, like acid reflux crawling up his throat. He swallowed it, a snarky "Bully for him" rolling off his tongue. When he cricked his neck again, he got an even more satisfying crack than the first time.
"I only call you that when you get to acting so bloody old all the time. I've got almost a decade on you, and here I am, nagging you to get out there and have some fun. Try to be like a normal bloke your age for a night. Who knows," she said, in an undertone, "you might even like it."
"Malfoy." This time Ron's voice had a slightly steadier quality. He stared dazedly at Harry, as though waiting for the rest of the joke to be revealed.
Harry let out a breath he hadn't known he'd been holding, and Draco gave a dim laugh, a dark little thing with no joy in it.
"I'll have to burn that pillowcase—it's MAC, it'll never come out." He gave the pillowcase a private smile, remembering something sweet. "Don't worry, I cleaned you up last night too. You looked like you'd been mauled by a horny clown." He shared his smile with Harry, covering the fingers on the lipstick stain with his own; warm, always so warm. "I cast a couple other spells on you too, just so you're aware. Calming. Healing. You might feel a bit groggy for a while, and dry-mouth is common. Nothing a juice with breakfast won't solve."
The edge of a moan made its way to him, and Harry pressed his ear against the door, hand at the doorknob. The rhythm was one he knew because it was Draco's preferred speed of jerking off; the sound of heavy drops of water from his knuckles to the floor of the bath at the end of each stroke. A pulse of interest passed from Harry's brain directly to his cock, and before he knew what he was doing he rapped twice at the door.
The Healer drew his wand and started on the diagnostic spells, evidenced by the cast of their characteristic blue glow on the ceiling. Draco straightened up, tapping the fingertips of one hand against the pad of his thumb in quick succession. It was his only acquiescence to how odd the spells felt on the skin—Harry would always shut his eyes and hold his breath when they were performed on him.
until he was cry-laughing, finally pushing Harry onto the landing and slamming the door shut behind him.
"I didn't know about these," Harry said. He had that terrible feeling he used to get before his Uncle would unleash on him for ruining something he'd never known about in the first place.
Harry contained his sigh, responding instead with a long blink and an indulgent, close-lipped smile.
"Fuck," Draco said, momentarily losing himself as he stared openly at Harry's exposed cock. His soft prick and bollocks hung heavy between his legs, the shaft just beginning to thicken under Draco's salacious stare. Draco palmed his own through the thin wool of his charcoal grey trousers, the outline growing mouthwateringly thick.
Harry made a sound as he collapsed back into the cushions, aftershocks wracking his body like tiny electrocutions. Draco grinned up at him and kissed the middle of his chest, then lower. Harry watched, entranced as he licked a wet spot clean, his tongue a fabulous pink against the deep even tan of Harry's skin. He lapped like a cat at the dark trail of black hair that started at his navel, cleaning the little spill left behind by his precome above the nest of black curls surrounding Harry's cock.
Except for Harry’s tools—his forceps during the daytime, and now, at night, his blunt fingernails scratching their way in. Harry’s fingers break through the moist barrier of petroleum jelly, lovingly daubed on Monday, and now it’s Friday and Draco’s not supposed to be here, and Harry’s fingers find the warmth of a saturated dressing.
"Honestly, it's because my therapist told me that I need to speak to another person at least once a day—literally anybody. And," he motioned a hand around in a gesture that was all poise and grace, "my mother is constantly on about '
Malfoy held his eyes a moment longer before erupting in belly-deep laughter, the sound pounding Harry's brain into submission.
"You think that I don't care?" Malfoy asked. For once, he seemed genuinely asking, not putting on a show.
"—right, my mistake—Hermione figured it out—and you should all know that I already threw a strop big enough for all of us, and it was stupid." He sighed and eyed the dregs of his pint of ale, no further liquid courage to be found in the glass. "Now that I've met the bloke I actually kind of, almost like him? Like he's, well he's not a prick, and I find that annoying, that he's
," Victoria paused and gave Harry a pointed look. He managed a stiff smile at her shite pun, teeth gritting against an oncoming headache.
“I hear they're going to screen a film later,” Draco said, pulling his hands free from their pockets to mime air quotes. It was such a Muggle thing to do, novel. Harry found it adorable. “The grey-hairs are positively a titter with anticipation."
"Wait, I'm nearly at the good part. So he came in and said this, and not only that but that he’d heard through the grapevine that I've been spreading my legs at filthy mixed bars now—"
"I cancelled," Harry swallowed, the real answer harder than he thought it would be to admit, "and I just really, really needed to see that you're okay," he stated, his voice somehow smooth and calm, even as each beat of his heart grew louder in his own ears. Draco opened his mouth to retort, and then deflated. Harry thought he must look particularly pitiful to shut him up so easily, lips smashed together in a thin line.
Draco’s heart is suffused with tenderness to see him behind those bars. The way he kneels, holding still and oh so quiet, is a quiet kind of respect. Draco’s glad he’s done this today, after a string of accidents the week previous. Regurgitated chicken liver on the Savonnerie carpet Louis XV gifted to the Malfoy’s seven generations past wasn’t an ideal situation, ever, but it was worse because he’d shat on it the day before. The manor was large, after all, and full of secrets. He hadn’t been in the house long enough to learn its halls, and the carpet-ruining seemed to be connected to hearing Lucius’s voice. They’d work on that.
His hands were clammy as Harry pulled him to his feet, and when he swayed forwards, Harry meant to steady him by the shoulders and then let him pass. He wasn’t sure, therefore, why he reached up, instead, and lifted the drape of blond hairs stuck with sweat to his brow.
"Pity," Draco said, annoyed now. "I mean, I, for one, wouldn't mind throwing on a Slytherin tie every once in a while and playing detention, but we can't all be exciting, I suppose. Some of us have grossly underdeveloped imaginations."
"I'll have you know," Draco panted, "that I left cowardice in the last century. I'll see you for fucking dinner at the Burrow, next Sunday, and you had better be ready for the performance of a lifetime. By the end of it, there won't be a Weasley that doesn't like me."
. The pitch of your thoughts—most of the time, it's like white noise to me. When you're pleased, they're smooth. Soothing, almost. Like when I'm giving you head, I can practically hear your brain purring, and it makes me feel so good to hear it, and then I just want to make you feel even better."
"We don't have to talk about it," Harry interrupted. He worried his lip, looking to his bare feet. "I know better than to go asking about people's scars."
Draco snapped a saltine, chewed it as he spoke to Harry only in his mind, like a ventriloquist’s trick.
"Great. So. Get talking," she looked at him expectantly. Harry let a huge breath fill his cheeks and blew it out.
He was drawn to the collection of framed photographs, a blend of Muggle and magical, hung just inside the bedroom door. Most were photos Harry had found within Grimmauld or had been gifted to him over the years. In the centre hung one of the Order from the early Eighties, his parents smiling out from the ranks of so many witches and wizards now passed; another of him with Teddy at barely six months old, cradled in Harry's arms. Harry was gaunt in that picture, but when he looked at his gurgling godson and smiled for the camera, his face was briefly less haunted. Below was his favourite of he, Hermione and Ron, eating takeaway curry on top of cardboard boxes from when they'd moved in together at their flat, a photo taken by George, and on they went, a short collection of memories from the last couple of years mingling with those from decades ago.
to how he lived his life, to the very notion of his romantic partners. As though they’d earned themselves a right to have a say. But he swallowed that anger down, went home to stew, and finally to pass out.
"Implying what, exactly, Victoria?" Harry replaced his glasses and folded his hands in his lap, hesitant to sound too defensive. "I'm good for it, I've already said so. I've got my outfit picked out and—"
As though they were tallying up the orgasms they’d had and given one another on some cosmic scoreboard—tit for tat.
"I know," Harry said, savouring how Draco's stomach went taut under his touch as his hand wandered up underneath his nightshirt. He smoothed it back down, slowly, until his fingertips snuck past the elastic of his pants.
"He's the first person I saw die," Harry said, "the first classmate." He didn't cry that night, but he did until he'd felt empty the next time he saw his Healer, and
"Have you had anything to eat?" Draco asked. Harry pretended deep interest in the dregs of his glass, rotating it, so the foam formed a thin white line around its circumference.
meant. He turned to face the forest and, and up-close could tell that it was differently dark, here. The blackness was complete so that no stars were visible, blinking through it.
"I don't adhere to your silly rules about these things, and I don't even know what the silent auction is in support of—”
"But, I don’t—" Harry bit his lip, and Draco smiled, drew one of Harry’s hands down and pressed it into his cock through his pants, eyelids fluttering at the touch. Then he placed the loose length of the strap in Harry’s empty palm and wrapped his hand around it, tightening it along with him.
"And why is that, Victoria?" he'd asked, the headache characteristic of their meetings settling in behind his eye.
"Speaking of romance," Draco interrupted, the little frown returning. He kept his eyes trained on the sunset. "Maybe it's about time I told you about my wedding."
"Harry?" Draco said. "Remember that you can say 'no' to things, and no one will die on account of you turning down the offer of one more NGO, alright?"
"You want it all, don’t you? You want the ease of sex and none of the trouble with the rules," he laughed hollowly. "I should have fucking seen this coming. You always did think that rules were beneath you. Like back in first-year—"
Water feels impossibly good when you're high, and he ends up with palms to cool tile, and you finger him without intention. He winces but holds your hand still and pushes in for more. A swirl at the rim makes him hiss, his eyes smouldering pits of black.
Malfoy’s forehead shone with the unfortunate lighting of his bedside lamp. His bottom lip was plump and it shone too, slick when it was released slowly from the grip of his teeth. At Harry’s whispered words the light in the room lowered. Dim lighting didn’t add any pounds to Malfoy’s frame, but it was easier for him to open his eyes, and Harry wouldn’t pretend he hadn’t spent years hunting for their attention.
"Hi," said Luna, and it was then that Harry realized that Draco wasn't even looking at him, hadn't addressed him at all.
"Fucking bag of laughs tonight, isn't he?" Noah twisted his neck to watch as Draco rounded the corner. He was sweating more than the temperature of the room called for, a bead gathering at the tip of his nose. Harry concentrated on it, more disgusted than he’d usually be by this very human act.
"Could you dress up? Are you asking me if I'd find you attractive in a dress? Because the answer, if it was ever unclear, is a rousing
"How so?" Harry sat in his favourite chair and began to unlace his boots, grateful to see Draco cross over to the wet bar and start to assemble something involving ice cubes and lime wedges.
"I was going to ask you if—it's only, I saw you two talking, out back." Harry nodded, wanting to speed up her story, though it was clear she couldn't speak any faster if she tried.
He stopped as lightning split the distant sky, and thunder made its slow roll towards them. Draco looked up, unblinking. The rain above their little island in the grass rolled off an invisible dome above them.
Draco nodded again, licked just the inner ridge of his lips, freshly glossed. They tasted like pixie dust candy and crushed rose petals in Harry's mouth. "Okay. What do you have in mind, pet?"
They unfurled from the couch and shuffled towards the stairs, shoes hanging from fingertips, hair in disarray.
Draco exhaled through his hands, covering the entirety of his face. He crossed over to the fridge, swung the door open on its hinges and pulled out a half-empty bottle of red wine. Harry held his tongue even as Draco summoned a clean glass and filled it halfway, brought it back to the dining table as he retook his seat. He took a gulp and closed his eyes.
"Stop taking the piss. Why the fuck are you here?" Harry shrugged and rolled his neck until it cracked loudly.
Draco Malfoy, am I actually watching you snog Harry Potter, or have I died and gone to pervy gossip heaven?"
In a bubble where no water fell, and where a soft warmth permeated the grey day, and amongst all the sounds, there was something like silence for Harry to confront what it might mean to untangle the knot of memories and feelings that threatened to consume him. What that might free him from. What he could become, released from the burden of carrying those heavy, rotting memories around. And what it could mean to have someone there, not to do the detangling for him, but to hold his hand on the way out of that dark place.
Having recovered his composure, Alex quickly exposed himself to be quite the laugh. Built like a Weasley and with the colouring to match, he seemed like a long-lost, hyper-femme cousin of Ron's, without the freckles. Harry had interrupted the application of a full face of make-up, which Alex apparently required for his work later that evening.
The extended Weasley clan was spread across three rooms—the studious were in the kitchen, watching over the washing and drying charms, laughing over shared mugs of mead that Bill had brought with him, while Molly and the older generation of Weasleys and Prewetts still sat around the kitchen table, sneaking one more bite of gingerbread cake onto their dessert plates, Arthur pouring one more tipple of Firewhisky into the assorted glasses on the tabletop; and the younger set had retired to the sitting room, children at play with all manner of assorted Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes under the heavily-lidded eyes of their parents, the childless at play with their own games—sneaking out for puffs of gillyweed-tinged rolled spliffs, taking up and abandoning card games on a whim. Harry hadn't realized he'd been staring at Neville and Ginny tucked together on the couch, an enchanted map of Europe spread across their laps as they charted their dream vacation for next summer—the gift he'd gotten them, after their conversation in Flourish & Blotts those months ago—and he was struck by a loneliness so deep that he thought he might start crying right there, where he sat.
Instead, he rolled the wood between his fingers before unleashing a complicated-looking set of flicks in the laundry's direction, face pinched. Harry couldn't believe how much the expression he wore reminded him of Hermione when she tried to bake.
The daisies looked too lonely on that windowsill. It was enough to make anyone pity the person forced to stare at them.
"I heard about George," Harry said. Happy sounds emanated from the living room, but he wasn't listening to that. Harry tried and failed to ignore the continued sound of running water from the washroom down the hall.
"Oh, sorry," Harry snapped around to face Ginny, pulled from his reverie of watching Draco arrange his luncheon.
Harry sat up and stared directly at the elf, not three feet away from him. Kreacher, unperturbed, promptly turned and left, speaking at an incredible volume about how he forgot his wash basket and would be back soon to cleanse the filth from his dear departed mistresses lodgings. Harry couldn't tell if he was actually so senile that he hadn't noticed him or if this was a ruse to get him out of the house. Either way, it worked.
Harry stole away, up a flight of stairs (not too dark, no, it was fine, he wasn't likely to trip and die here at all) and into a second bar (better lit, room to breathe, but only marginally).
"Yes, you're my first and only. Person," he clarified, "that I've spoken to today. You should feel proud."
There was work, mountains of it. Around and after work was research, at his flat or in the Ministry library, hidden under the imposing Barbican Centre, where he somehow grew paler. Mondays meant contemporary, and ballet was Tuesday and Thursday, and every other night there was stretching or class prep or reading for Pansy's new-year's-resolution of starting a feminist book club, or the time he re-dedicated to his houseplants. Saturdays included lunch with Narcissa, and every night but Sunday they ate together, Harry experimenting with new cuisines unless Kreacher beat him to it.
yes," Draco said, voice strained, as Harry bollocks finally connected with his arse, and wasn’t that the feeling to end all feelings? Harry lost track of time as Draco steadily pled for more, first with his body, then with his mouth. He rocked back to meet Harry's thrusts, little grunts punctuating each push.
"Alright," he said, "best get on that right quick. Fancy a pick-up game sometime soon? The boys would love to have you on as Seeker."
"That's good, isn't it?" Harry asked the tabletop. Why was having Malfoy admit simple information so like pulling teeth?
Draco hummed, put down his own tea and leaned in close. His fingers found Harry's throat and he tipped his head back, examining with a touch soft as down where he'd applied exact pressure and force.
“Harry, come on now, readers were dying to know. How’d your ex take the news? Is it true she caught you with her brother, causing the breakup that shook wizarding Britain? Harry! Harry!”
Harry reached for his wand and went to send a charm at the pile of detritus, but Draco pulled his own and hexed him so quickly that his wand was swatted free from his hand.
When the news came on at half-eight, Harry sat back in his chair, brushing crumbs from his t-shirt. With a full belly and a caffeinated mind, he dared to glance over at the mountain of mail looming from the far end of the table.
A flash of white; Draco's hands at the edge of his vision, taking his glasses from him, following up with the vision-correcting charm. Harry was so worried that he'd look up that he pressed his eyelids shut on a gasp, bringing a throaty laugh from Draco.
"An opportunity," Justin said. He looked at Harry with admiration, even as one of his eyes kept cringing shut.
"No, I like it. I'd prefer you to call me Draco. That's—" Malfoy paused, head bobbing left and right, weighing his next words, "—friendly. I understand what you mean, I think. About having something that's only yours."
"You know it too. You drive yourself sick with worry for others. You're always saying yes to anything that's asked of you."
Harry’s fingers wrapped around the metal, still warm from Draco’s skin. He nodded, his mouth saying, "Understood," adding the "sir," exactly slow enough to be on the edge of sass. Draco raised a brow to signal that he'd notice it and then rubbed a palm along Harry’s shaft, drawing a breath from him.
Draco smiled indulgently. "For a while there, I thought I'd fucked language out of you forever." He sipped his own tea, and Harry could hardly believe that he'd lain there, in the very same bed the summer previous, watching an enigmatic Draco watch him back. Of all the changes that had occurred in his life, that he and Malfoy had become Harry and Draco was easily the most wonderful and bizarre.
"You want to do that with me inside?" Draco tilted his head in the direction of the club, and Harry found himself nodding.
"Sure." Ginny gave him a wry look, gold eyeshadow dotting the insides of her eyes, a wicked cat-eye lending her an added dose of mischievousness. "I'd love to have a drink in my hand first. And one for Nev, too—something
Just as Harry decided to go with his gut, which always seemed to pick left, did a harangued looking witch exit from that direction. Before she had a chance to catch a look at his face, he jerked to the right, rapidly descending one staircase after another, taking the treads two at a time until the sound of more voices coming up at him slowed his speed.
"Er. It would be nice to have someone to talk to about—oh, fuck it—about blokes and stuff, and I—maybe it's stupid, and maybe I'm making a huge mistake, but I feel like I can trust you now."
He opened both eyes, flexed his fingers. Considering the pain in his skull, the cocoon of bedding around him, and the crinkle of down under his head, he probably wasn't dead. He wasn't sure about how hell was outfitted, but he was confident that they didn't stock sheets anywhere near this soft.
"Oh," Harry said. Draco watched him finish his beer and then pushed back in his seat, breaking the contact under the table. Harry was bereft without it. He wanted more, not less.
"I'll tell you later," Draco said before letting out a growl of annoyance. "I can't believe I let her corner me into anything, and now two weddings in one year. Two!"
"I've never known you to be decent before, Malfoy," Harry said, "colour me fucking surprised." He rarely sounded so spiteful as he did now.
They both pulled faster now, on the path to come again before the sweat on their bodies from the first round even had a chance to evaporate. Harry hooked a leg around Draco's hip to hold him close, his free hand cupping the back of his head.
A hot tear surprised both of them. Harry, that it fell, and Draco, that it existed at all. Harry was drawn closer to the bed and laid the roses down in the space next to Draco’s feet. Another tear fell, and it was Draco who reached out, hooked his pinky finger around one of Harry’s.
"Lucky for both of us, you didn't. Don't look so scared! I'm fine, I'm really fine. I'm just glad you didn't scar my face." He knocked their shoulders together, and a feeling rose in Harry; this was an important moment. That he'd been granted this slip of time where whatever he said wouldn't scare Draco off, and he could just say what he needed to. What he was being asked to.
Draco had become something of a rock to lean on, had taught him about self-worth and what it meant to truly be independent. He quietly went about working harder every day than Harry could give him credit for. Harry watched as it took him a steady campaign of being the first one in and the last one at the apothecary out until Leon, a curmudgeon of a man who worked behind the counter and had lost a cousin in the Battle of Hogwarts, asked him to go round with the rest of his coworkers to their local the coming Friday. How Draco had slid it into conversation like it was a terribly unimportant detail of his day, barely worth mentioning, but had fussed over which of two shirts in an identical colour to wear to work that day, his only concession to the nerves he surely felt. Or how he must have been overflowing with pride when Mordred, a venerated potions master from the Department of Mysteries, sent him a memo that a research assistant position in her was opening in her lab in the new year and had Mr. Malfoy put any thought to putting in for a transfer?—that Draco hadn't even shown Harry the memo, had simply pinned it above his desk, looking over at it when studying some nights before making a fresh espresso, sitting down, and forcing another paper into his brain.
“Yes, well, there might need to be some modifications. You'll need half of the cupboards in the bath, obviously, and a promise to share the use of the floors and windows with me.”
He had all the time in the world lately, so he took it. Washed his hair twice. Brushed his teeth the Muggle way under the stream of the hot jets. Sometimes he'd even catch himself humming as he scrubbed with one of the many soaps and concoctions littering the tub's edge, trinkets sent by companies trying for an endorsement. Today was something spicy with sandalwood in, and it was good. The humming stopped as he gave in, his right hand dropping lower until he was wanking and came fast, too fast, the way he always did in the morning. Water sluiced over his chest, washing spunk from his fingertips, and he stood there under it until his breathing slowed again, evened out. It never lasted the way he wanted it to. The way it happened, there was barely enough time to fantasize about any one person at all.
"And what if it was?" Draco turned to face him. "What if Justin was the last good, hard fuck I've had? What about it?"
Draco finally turned to face him, only to stare at the opening of his robes. He went on so long that Harry looked down, rubbing nervously at the skin at the top of his chest.
"It's alright." Draco inspected what was left of the apple, shiny black seeds suspended in white flesh, and balanced the remains on the tabletop between them. "I don't mind being the brains
"I'd accuse you of being a lot more than just foolish during the war," Harry said. He couldn't help it as his tone grew more biting. Malfoy didn't flinch.
?" Harry was on his feet before he realized it. He caught sight of himself in the glass of the cabinet on the wall opposite, all wide-eyed shock, complete with his jaw trying to meet his chest. "Excuse me, he—
, into the conversation. So much of what they'd shared was physical, and the carnal throbbing for Draco's touch still surged in him. Things between them were very nearly always good when it involved fingers in mouths or twisted in each other's hair or holding on to gain leverage or pressing into flesh with enough abandon to leave bruises. Harry couldn't pretend that he didn't still
"None that I'm keeping from you. I have memories I haven't shared, but they're not secrets. We just haven't gotten to them yet."
Something about the idea of actually walking into Draco Malfoy's bedroom seemed a step too far, and Harry couldn't chance the additional thoughts and questions that might come from it. Not to mention that he was caught somewhere between total exhaustion and the feverish need to act, to do something. Injustice rubbed him the wrong way.
"Maybe a Pepper-Up Potion is called for to get you back to speed," Harry said. He looked up into Malfoy's face, which was a mistake, because even wet, perhaps especially when wet, it was a face to behold. Water glossed his lips and glued his lashes together into dark golden spikes. Sure, he looked hazy and exhausted, but under that was the austere framework, the delicate bone structure so rare and eye-catching. It was unfair that Malfoy had become so pretty since the trials. Or had he always been pretty, and Harry had simply been too busy to notice?
charm over both of them. His magic was getting stronger, though he wasn't doing anything to hone it, particularly. Even through his annoyance he noticed the flare of Draco's pupils as Harry's spell fell over his skin—he loved the feeling of Harry's magic, and it never failed to turn him on, little shows of power.
When the thought slammed into Harry's mind, it clicked. Harry knew where he'd seen this before. He'd pushed this feeling down, gulped around it for a single breath, screamed into empty rooms from it. He'd spent hours stubbornly ignoring the signs, attempting housework until the breakdown was all-consuming.
Everyone started speaking at once, and the healer—Xu, she went by her last name, he remembered—held a hand up and closed her fist. She looked into each of their faces in turn, her scowl brooking no bullshit. She was an old hand on the ward.
"For...well, for curse scars. Not burns, necessarily. I've just got—I've got a lot of them, and I've never given the creams and stuff a chance to work. To—well not to heal them, I know I've got them forever—but I've heard some stuff can help make them recede, or itch less, or hurt less. I've never bothered to try anything before."
Jessica's look was apologetic. She understood the needs of an overworked system in a way that Harry was only just getting acquainted with.
"He wasn't himself, and wasn't doing well, and he wasn't talking to anyone, really." Harry rubbed at his arms as though it chilled, friction warming his skin. "It wasn't just me. But he's working on it now, and he's apologized, and I accepted. I believe him."
With that, he grabbed a leather jacket and his wand, took a pinch of Floo powder and threw it into the hearth, stepping into the green flames while announcing, "Gollybean, East London," and was off.
They kissed in the loos and when he, Oliver, when he reached for Harry's fly, Harry pushed his hands away, because the feeling was off. But he didn't want to disappoint, asked if he had a flat they could go to instead and Oliver had given him a cheeky yes and brought him back to the place he shared with two other men, themselves no more than boys, both of whom eyed Harry hungrily, eyes heavily lidded from the joint they were sharing over a plate of nachos in their tiny kitchen.
Draco snorted. "If my parents could have found a rug big enough, they would have swept me under it. Or had a house-elf do it. As it was, we didn't talk about my obvious decline. Lucius and I barely fought."
"Yes," he said resolutely. "Yeah. There's a lovely someone, actually. He brought me here, originally."
A touch landed on Harry's thigh, but this time it wasn't the brush of a knee. It was Draco's hand delivering a painful squeeze.
When he turned back and looked at him, Harry realized how bleary his eyes were. Unfocused, seeing not Harry but through him, to the overcast night. That though he didn't sway precipitously the way Pansy did, Draco was still standing there long seconds after he should have said something barbed or moved along, was alternately mumbling and silent because he was drunk.
"He doesn't like it." Draco spoke like it hurt his throat to manage much more than a whisper, and Harry had the terrible, uncharitable thought that perhaps his throat hurt from having had it fucked by someone else, the way his used to go gravelly for Draco. That maybe Noah had—
“Oh, goody,” Draco turned onto his side and fanned his fingers over his eyes. “Did you remember my order?”
Draco chuckled. "Wherever you like, pet, as long as I find you here. Will you wait for me, please? Promise me you won't run off?"
"Do you feel grown?" A smile tugged at Malfoy's lips; he must have caught Harry looking. But if he'd noticed, why wasn't he bothered? "Because you sure don't act like it," he added.
He flicked his eyes over to Draco nearing them, grinning at him, like Draco was a chip at the casino for him to bargain and play with, and Harry had had enough. He gave himself to the count of five to give his anger someplace to
"As you can see, our little Edward has taken a fancy to someone who thinks pink hair is a good look," Andromeda said, pulling Harry in to drop air-kisses to his cheeks. Her tone was jokingly severe; she treated Teddy's abilities as the exceptional and wonderful parts of him that they were.
"No amount of charms or prep is ever one hundred per cent effective, and our bodies are living organisms. Everything to do with sex is filthy—“
"I thought you didn't drink," Harry answered. Draco shrugged and swirled the wine in the glass, letting it go still and watching the legs form.
"I had meals pulled for days at a time." He winced at the memories of bars on the window and locks on the outside of the door. He didn't usually let his memories stray so far back. They were muted by time, but they were there all the same.
The bodies approached, and the conversation became very suddenly subdued, and then went totally quiet.
“No?” Draco blinked, pressed a fingertip to the place where the hole had been. The digit was palest pink again, a signal of life.
"I can't." He struggled to find the words good enough to describe what he wanted to say, found that Draco's were the only ones he thought would do. "Remember when you told me that I deserve to feel good? To be happy? You deserve to feel good, too."
Harry waited to be flooded with thousands of harried thoughts that buzzed like bees, but instead, his mind was blank. It felt like that moment following an explosion when the high-pitched whine was everything, the screen behind your eyelids white or black, or worse, red if there was fire beyond them. There was nothing to do but wait until the sound and sensation all crashed back in. He always did go numb when someone died. It was easiest that way, but now he didn’t know how to stop it from happening. He wanted to be in the room. He wanted to
"Jesus, Draco, I'll come in a minute if you keep this up," Harry warned. Draco, forever devilish only moaned and took him low, almost to the root, and Harry pushed up onto his toes, trying to force the last half-inch. Just as Harry's balls pulled up tight against his body, he sucked off, having brought him to full hardness only to leave his cock ruddy and wet, bobbing free in the space between them.
Draco was ready to answer but stopped when plates with freshly steaming food popped into being before them. They took the time to place their napkins in their laps and raised a glass in a toast.
"And you?" Harry asked. Malfoy shrugged. The furrow in his brow deepened as he turned his attention on sugar crystals spilt near his plate, pushing them into the pads of his long, pale fingers.
Harry stared at it. "What about the counting. You're still counting everything. Could you stop that?"
"Need a hand?" Harry offered his arm and surprisingly, she took it, allowing him to escort her to the sofa closest to the boy.
"Next time, I want to wash your hair," Harry blurted as they towelled off. Draco made a light sound, tossing Harry a wide-tooth comb that he believed might detangle some of his more unruly curls, turning a boar-bristled brush to his own locks.
His heart rate spiked, and he pulled his wand, assuming a fighting stance on instinct. The air in the flat was still, and Harry detected no sudden movements. He walked quickly, grateful to be in socked feet, clearing the rooms on the main floor one at a time. Nothing out of the ordinary was revealed, and his diagnostic spells didn't detect anything living, save the plants. He took the stairs lightly so that he didn't make a sound.
"Get out of here," Harry said. Tears welled in his eyes, but he'd fight Ron with his fists before he let him see them drop over this. Ron settled back into his previous position, standing his ground.
Beckoning him out of the garden and into a kitchen full of light, his voice full of love. Grey-violet eyes radiant, open. Asking where he’s been.
It took Harry a few seconds to process his words before their possible meaning came over him. This was the nightmare scenario he'd assumed all gay sex would be like when he'd started imagining it in his late teens. Sucking cocks—sure, he'd had a firm grip on how that would start, progress, and end. Fucking someone in the arse—the
Ron heaved a breath. "Why are you still being like this?" he asked. He coughed again, not so bad as the first time, and popped another lozenge in his mouth. Harry could smell it up close—sweet honey and lemon, the spice of ginger. "I just don't get it. I don't get you, sometimes."
"Your letters were beautiful," he breathed, "I don't deserve them. Even before Christmas, I wanted to take it all back, but by then there was—" He broke off and fumbled for another cigarette, perching the arm that held it on the table while the other tucked around to squeeze his knees in tighter.
Grimmauld Place smelled effusively of roses, and the source was revealed to be the front hall littered with bouquets and cards.
"Never?" Malfoy said, looking him directly in the eye, a challenge. "I suppose pretending not to recognize a face I'd known for years hardly counts for much, at least not when you're me." Harry opened his mouth to retort, but Malfoy continued, voice quiet and pained. "Even after all my years of indoctrination and training, I couldn't go against the innate sense everyone but snake face and his most loyal followers felt—to protect Harry Potter, at all costs."
A raindrop fell on Harry's forehead. He wrapped his arms around his knees, hugging them close for warmth.
“Oh, yes, quite,” Malfoy answered brightly. “Who am I to turn down one of the brightest in the field?”
At that moment, enraptured in the timbre of Draco's voice, Harry felt something at his shoulder. He went to swat at it as Draco's hand darted out and caught his.
"Maybe this article and your little memoir will finally give you the attention you so obviously crave," he added, a smile curling one corner of his lips.
"I, for one, can't wait for that divorce to be finalized," Draco muttered under his breath, watching her trample back to the house.
"Let me stop you right there, mate. The last time you said something was not a big deal—do you want me to do it, or do you want Hermione to?" Ron said.
"I'm so glad to be the first to do this to you," he said, mouthing at Harry's neck until shivers wracked his body. Harry was silent, his heart full even as the pit of embarrassment stayed lodged deep inside of him. Even after all they'd done, this seemed salacious and dirty. But Draco didn't seem to mind it, so who the fuck cared, really?
"It's my plan. For gaining a stone." He was twitchy, eyes flicking to meet Harry's and then back to the chart.
"Fuck, Merlin, Christ is right," Harry said at last, and Draco hummed, then gave a breathy laugh, his cock jumping inside of Harry in time with the tensing of his stomach. He turned to look once more in the mirror as Draco pulled out of him, gently, holding him aloft by his armpits. Within a few seconds he muttered the incantation that vanished the conjured belt, and once he determined that Harry was sturdy on his knees, undid the one at his wrists and laid him, facedown on the clean side of the bed.
"I went with anybody—remember when I said I couldn't remember everyone? How many? And sometimes when I got really low I did go with wizards, but they were—it was awful. It was—very bad, early on."
." Draco chose that moment to press his finger inside of Harry and it ravaged what little self-control he had left. His neck arched and in the heat of the shower, gooseflesh broke out over his entire body.
"I—" Harry coughed and rubbed at the back of his neck as a deep flush came over his entire body. "I don't know how."
"The fire exit is to the left of the stage, before the loo," Draco said, "and it's good to know that even the mighty saviour gets nervous over trivial things sometimes."
Harry’s eyes lower to the knot of pale blue silk keeping Malfoys meagre attire together at his waist and then they lower further still.
She spoke with the surety of someone with a hundred years under their belt, the lines around her mouth a deep set of parentheses that widened when she smiled. Harry could tell instantly why Draco was so enamoured with her—she radiated poise and her gaze was sharp to the point that it was like being watched by a tiger—a being stronger than you and suited to take you down, deciding on your usefulness at each new moment.
or get defensive, or look at him funny and make an offhand remark about his old friend paranoia cropping up. Instead, he sidestepped the insinuation completely and said, "We're going to be okay," and pulled Harry in for a hug. It stifled, he needed to
Harry was after was, and now this, his friends taking notice and poking fun where fun oughtn't to be had.
"Good. Neither will I," Harry breathed into him, soaking in the feel of his eyelashes soft as moths' wings at his cheek.
Because Draco Malfoy didn’t want to hold hands with him. Him with his bad hair, lack of worldly experience, insipid thoughts. Him—
She laughed, placing the quill in its stand. "What brings you this way?" She sat back into her enormous green-leather rolling chair. Ron called it her throne; Harry was apt to agree.
"Um, not necessarily anywhere anyone at this table would know. I went to a Muggle school—Imperial College, in London."
"By your reaction," Harry spoke slowly, careful not to grip the bottles he held too tightly for fear of smashing them into little bits, "I'm going to guess that Pansy's telling the truth, and not being awful for the fun of it?"
"Like...a mental break?" Parvati held her spoon in her mouth, eyes round with interest, and Hermione stopped scraping, clearly hanging on his every word. What could he say of Draco's state? What should he let on—what was required, and what was an overstep? The hair on his forearms rose as his skin rippled with gooseflesh.
Harry’s thoughts stuttered to a stop. He tried to speak, but no words came to him. He cleared his throat and tried again.
The Healer took his wand and drew a squiggly line of white light with two pronounced humps, like mountains on either side of a deep valley. He drew a line through the first of the two, at the height where one would typically draw in snow. It reminded Harry of the drawings Teddy left littered everywhere he went. All it needed were some fluffy clouds, a house with four-paned windows and a dragon flying up next to the sun.
"Okay, bloody off her rocker, then," he rolled his eyes. "People in rocking chairs won’t be offended, right? Coming, Harry?"
Kreacher so thoroughly matched the colour of the outside retraining wall that Harry hadn't noticed him join them outside. He heaved a great sigh and turned to face the elf.
Hewitt sighed. A few years out from retirement and it showed in the curve of his back. The work tired him now in a way it hadn’t when Harry had first started training under him.
"I don't want you to hide them from me, Harry," Draco reached out and rubbed his cheek, his thumb scratching over his stubble. "I'm asking you to tell me what you're thinking."
Harry let out a puff of air and rocked, gripping Draco's arm because it grounded him, kept him from floating back off into the night sky. His eyes filled with tears of their own accord, and if he blinked, the tears would fall, and he was a man who had not cried, not in years, not for anyone. Not anymore. Surely, never for himself.
Harry recognized the voice as Penelope Clearwater's, a voice he connected with the hospital intrinsically. She worked the Auror unit, and if he had the energy to laugh he would, that this was the exact location within the complex that he'd instinctively jumped to.
"I'm not—" Harry started before he realized that he absolutely had been able to tailspin into a marvellous brood. "Tell me more, then," he said instead, "I'm listening now."
Harry could laugh, but it didn't quite make it out of his throat. He huffed, breath like a puff of smoke.
"Harry, I know this is all very new to you, but you hired a cracking administrative team to launch and run the place," Draco's voice took on some of the lilt he used to rile him up, his patented Let Me Explain Like You're In Primary School
didn't they have an outpatient wing for substance abuse? A third of their year at Hogwarts clearly had PTSD, but—
so thick that it blurred all sound coming at them from the street, cutting off the shouted refrain of a reporter mid-word. His most practised smile pulled into place as easily as if curtain strings were attached to the corners of his mouth and had been pulled out and up.
"No?" Harry arched a brow. It was more than alright if Draco wanted to prep him instead; his tongue in Harry's—
Harry took calls from the team at the construction site and reluctantly read and responded to the letters he'd gathered from home, glad to stand still and cold and most importantly alone for a few minutes in the hospital's owlery. Even the vinegar-scent of bird droppings and the sharpness of the wind didn't bother him—inside, he was constantly on display, but here, he was just another bloke with a bit of treat and softly whispered words and a scroll.
"I mean, he told me what he remembers, which is getting blind drunk and wandering out to the pitch in the back for a fly, which is a new level of dense, even for him. He found some old junk in the shed from when we were in school. He and Fred used to hide the Wheezes prototypes out there." Ron smiled at the tabletop, a memory of old times lighting up his blue eyes for a blissful moment. Harry remembered too; the wink from Fred and waggled eyebrows from George before a stink bomb went off in the shed while Ginny was inside searching for fairy lights.
He closed the distance between them and leaned his back against the wall next to Harry, gloved hands pressed against the hot brick.
Draco groaned at the ceiling. His voice was abandoning him completely, odd stops and starts that he spoke through even when the sound was little more than breath forced out over vocal cords. Anger gave him an uncanny strength.
Draco squeezed him. "And you, Harry Potter, the saviour of our world, philanthropist playboy with green eyes that melt ice and lips that can make can make me come on-sight." Draco punctuated his sentence by grinding into Harry, and he gasped
With Bill gone, Harry followed a gut feeling out to the garden instead of back upstairs and that’s where he found Draco sat directly in a pile of dirt.
charms in the lamps flickering slightly as a spike of anger pulsed through him. "That he'd try to infect Teddy with that thinking, though? How dare he?"
"It's not so bad as all that," Harry said. He had to get out. He couldn't stand it, wanted out from playing pretend. He wasn't on an even keel. He wasn't alright; he didn't want to be here, drinking with Justin; didn't want to be in this castle, thinking about dead things; didn't want to be praised by people who thought he was good and sweet and something close to holy when they didn't
Rage spiked in Harry's chest, and the confusing twin sounds of firecrackers discharging outside as something shattered inside, falling heavily to the floor in what sounded like a thousand pieces. Draco turned his head in the direction of the sound but didn't flinch.
"Don't do that," Draco said, "don't diminish it. May I?" Harry nodded, and Draco reached out, smoothed a finger down the centre of the stripe. "I hated that bloody snake," he said, lip curled in a snarl, and Harry could kiss him, wished even though it would have been impossible that they'd been something other than enemies when the blasted thing was alive and could have shared that hatred. It was refreshing to have someone else haunted by the same memories as he was, as dreadful as that sounded, and as much as he'd never admit so out loud.
"My favourite therapist once told me that she liked seeing me because I arrived bitter. Some people, the smart ones, they like it. Talking to me. Anyway, stop pulling me from my train of thought," Malfoy frowned at Harry even though he remained silent, and it was Malfoy who was interrupting himself.
"I'm only a few blocks away," Draco mumbled over his shoulder, easily keeping pace with Pansy, who looked like she was walking through honey. Harry stuck his hands in his pockets and shadowed the three of them, comfortable to follow.
, I'm going to come all over you, and I want to you come inside of me, help me come, Harry, fuck me, now, now, now—" and it was like invisible cords that had been holding him down were cut at the same time, and Harry's hips couldn't help but buck up to meet the soft flesh of Draco's arse as he slammed back down onto him. Draco squeezed his fingers so hard that the knuckles cracked as the first jets of his hot come spilt between their frotting bodies, and Harry shook, a grunt turning into a groan that ripped through his throat, his hips crashing as he met Draco's every bouncing downwards thrust with an
magic," Draco retorted, catty, even though his tight grip on Harry's fingers spoke to his nerves. The flashbulbs went off and Harry thought, weirdly, that he was glad Draco was wearing a soft colour—a light grey jumper with overlong sleeves, and lilac coloured stitching—because it would soften him. As though a hint of purple would keep the papers from calling him a demon.
“Get that blood off your shoes the moment you step out of my operating theatre or I’ll send you back to first-year healing school,” was what he’d originally said after Harry’s first surgery. Not the most tactful, Hewitt, but it was the sentiment that mattered.
"You should look into a career as a bodyguard," Harry quipped as they sat minutes later in a booth outfitted in ripped orange pleather seats.
"Very well. Go upstairs and undress in the bedroom. Fold your clothes away, neatly. Prepare yourself, and then kneel beside the bed."
"He's taking the Night Bus home with us, that's all. Trust me—I've got my head on straight here." Ron's eyebrows made clear that he categorically didn't trust Harry on this score, but he didn't say anything further. "He just needs to get home. That's all that's happening."
"Mione was saying something the other day about how he's been helping out with her department on, um," Ron scratched at his chin, squinting at the group playing enchanted darts in the corner. "Well, to be honest, I can't remember what about, it was dead boring. What's this you were saying about running into him again?"
"You first," Harry said when they parted. He knelt down—bum knees be damned—and relished the bump of the head of Draco's prick against his cheek. He stroked him to full hardness with his right hand, left tugging gently at his sac.
mattered. I learned how to survive, and that took concentration, and I did it. Focused on my studies, which were my ticket out of penury, and out from under my parent's thumb. That meant staying away from drugs and drink and keeping my weight up enough that I didn't land in there again, which meant structure. Decorum. I'm great at decorum," he nudged his shoulder against Harry's, trying to dig a smile from him. "Lest I ruin my teeth or worry Pansy and Blaise again, and it's worked. I've been fine. Better than fine, I'm—right now, I'm fabulous. I'm great."
"Didn't want to be too obvious," Harry said, his voice a low rumble. Draco arched a brow, his forever gesture of
"Remember," Harry panted out between thrusts, holding on to the memories while enraptured in the pleasure of this new one they were making, "remember how often you were inside me?"
There was pressure in the body's mouth—teeth clamping down on a slimy, moving thing. Like a snake had crawled inside the body and tried to get out through the hole in its face.
Draco shook his head, suddenly demure. "Sure, if you've got a thing for disfigured, emotionally unstable war criminals—"
That same night, as soon as Draco exited the Floo and retrieved his order of a virgin cucumber Tom Collins from Kreacher, he turned to Harry.
“Clever enough to get what I want.” Draco raised a brow and dipped his gaze to the situation emerging below Harry’s belt.
Harry walked faster, redoubling the grip on his hand. One woman had held still, knelt on the floor, while the other dripped molten hot red wax over her thighs. The woman taking the wax drippings panted out the word
approved to run for print." When neither Harry nor Ron responded, he dropped the paper and sighed dramatically.
"Yes, I'm sure there's something that needs minding in the kitchens," he said, as Harry veritably bolted for the stairs. He was thankful to find the kitchen quiet, most of the food and drink and good times to be had upstairs, only Kreacher toiling away in the far corner, too deaf to hear what went on around the corner. He worked on some baked good he was making in Draco's honour, to be served in three days time, apparently.
Harry did, flopping onto his back. His own cock remained dusky and so hard that it slapped flat against his belly.
and still hasn’t spoken to you in two weeks a plush job, by negotiating what is effectively blackmail with the Minister of Magic." Ron's self-satisfied look was only outdone by his tone.
Not Draco curls up on the bed, staring like his reflection is going to crawl out of the frame and throttle him.
Harry internally recoiled at the thought. If he'd learned anything in therapy, it was that healing didn't have anything to do with winning or losing; the opposite of positive reinforcement wasn't meant to be punishment.
"That was so fucking illegal, beyond just being rude," Harry spat. "Find what you were looking for in there?"
"That's a yes, then. As usual, foisting the real work on others." He turned and looked down the room's length, taking in the low stone ceiling and kitchen off to the side. "How do I get out of here, again?"
"What's brought you to me on this bright, shiny day?" Harry turned his back to empty space beyond the building, resting his weight in his bent forearms, casual as he could pretend to be. He raised an eyebrow at Ron, who refused to look directly at him. Instead, he unwrapped something from a bit of wax paper and popped it into his mouth.
Harry closed his eyes, basking in the warm glow of Draco's praise. It made him heady and weak, and he wanted more of it, before the sweat collecting in the crooks of his body cooled.
"I said it would hurt. You shouldn't cast on yourself when you're inebriated," Draco said softly. His wand clattered as he dropped it to the table.
"You two are the fucking worst friends, it's friends off after this," he muttered, "I'm never telling you anything again." Hermione merely increased her volume to speak over him.
, but a party lives or dies on its refreshments, and," Draco turned back to Kreacher and crouched down so that they could see eye to eye, "I don't think I've been explaining myself adequately to you, Kreacher, and I really do need your help here. We both do," he added, giving Harry an imploring look, to stem further outbursts.
"Ronald, you sweet dear, I'd love to do this part; it's only my favourite. To which you," Hermione leaned down to poke at an exposed strip of Harry's belly with her dessert fork, which Harry, unsuccessfully, blindly, tried to kick away, "you, you weird little oaf, to which you said 'It's only that I'm thinking of taking up that post with the Hogwarts Board of Trustees and I'm gay.'"
"Another time, Pans! The longer he stands here, the higher the chance that he sicks up all over your Jill Sander, and how would you like that?"
"You're welcome, you curmudgeonly old sod. So, yeah, that's the long and short of it. You've got all your players who knew about you and Malfoy—"
"Limber," Draco said, turning to him, and even though they'd only just fucked in the shower, it was on again.
"Yes, start times," she said, her annoyance clear. "Some of them have a morning start, and for a few, you'll need to work with Reza on outfit changes; I'm sorry, but yes, sometimes it's better if you stack a couple of events in a single day and don't give me that look. We'll do the tell-all interview in a few weeks."
"Forget I said anything. Let's not dwell on that. The point is, this is a friendly gathering. Nothing more. Can you blame your friends for trying?"
"Your bottle of sherry is looking a little low there, Pansy, so I'll get some G&T’s going in the pitcher, limes on the side if you’d like,” he gestured at the glassware he was wandlessly assembling on the countertop as he set about slicing the limes by hand, tea towel whipped over one shoulder and ice appearing in the bowl as soon as he thought about requesting it of the house. He would kill her with fucking kindness and make her like it if that's what it would take for all of them to enjoy a fun night out.
It was so bright that Harry had to squint to see. He cupped his hands to make a cap-brim over his eyes.
"I can tell you that I am not the person now that I was back then, and if there's anything in particular that you wish to hash out with me, I'm available, anytime." Draco paused again, leaving space for them to react, and Harry took a look at their companion's faces. To say that they were speechless would be an understatement. Susan's mouth literally hung open, her jaw attempting to find a spot to rest against her throat. And perhaps he was simple, or maybe his cock's wants had gone to his head, but he understood then what Hermione had meant when she said that Draco's apology seemed genuine. It was nothing short of shocking to watch in real-time because he seemed so sincere.
"Well. I know that we're not supposed to—" Harry closed his eyes. It was easier this way, speaking to the abyss. "I know that I shouldn't go asking for more than what I've been given, and we only just talked about,
"And just because you are the proud owners some piddly cocks doesn’t mean that one has to be involved for it to be
And so Harry was shuttled back to St Mungo's, past the blinking beetle eyes and yelled questions, quickly developing the itchy feeling between his shoulder blades from being surrounded and watched.
"You're totally insane," he said once he was within speaking distance. "A two hundred quid tip! What are you on?"
He blinked, the way he did when he was preparing a lie or stemming the need to cry. "What are you talking about? It's not that complicated. I was addicted to a whole bunch of things, so I went to rehab. End of story."
to the heir! And no gifts, and the house would provide Harry Potter with such gifts, gifts worthy of the heir’s status." Kreacher crossed his arms and sniffed. "Kreacher has seen generations of Blacks, all at courtship. This is not how courtship is being done properly."
"Are you?" Draco made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a strangled cry. "Is this any better than if I told you later that I’m a failure?"
him those things. What if he relapses?" His throat was tight, and the lights in the hall flickered; too many feelings bubbled inside him, rising too fast.
Draco laughed, biting his lip the way Harry knew meant that he was thinking of him naked, or getting there.
"Are you alright?" Draco removed his sunglasses and looked at him as he applied Chapstick, the furrow of concern between his brows. When Harry didn't respond, he shook his wrist to reveal his wristwatch and looked to the corners of the park.
"You’re going to have ninety days, Draco. You’re going to have a hundred, and a thousand, and I’ll keep counting them, forever. Okay?"
"I don’t think enough was done to socialize you Gryffindors when you were young. I’ve always thought this," Draco said, straight-faced. Harry scoffed.
"That fucking note is the longest thing I've written since November, and it's trash because I'm trash." He gave a crooked smile at something Harry couldn't see. "I'm not good for much, you know."
"Thanks, Parkinson. I needed someone reasonable to make me do that this morning. Have you, erm, any plans for tonight?"
Harry picked up another bulb and held it between his palms, the warm magic that he knew to be powered by love and love alone flowing into it, fixing the dead parts, strengthening the whole.
He was letting anger, the pure, blue-hot kind bubble up in him, and that was always a scary route to go. His anger had a way of making him feel dirty, reminded him of his time as a conduit—a Horcrux. It was misplaced, but he needed to rid himself of it or he knew it would turn inwards, or be directed at the people he actually cared about.
A toasting seed on the stove popped, and Ron turned to take over from the automated movements of the spatula, breaking something stuck to the pan off and lowering the flame under it with a flick of his wand. Hermione looked from him to Harry, back again, and huffed, entering the room properly.
"You're older than me," he huffed, but Draco only shrugged, smirking as he turned back around, feet wetly slapping the pavement beneath him, propelling him ever forward.
“Who says I’m not,” Harry replied, kissing his wrist. He shrugged one shoulder. “But I still want to. Do you?"
Harry exclaimed, "I’m just not so stupid as to think that you might want me! As a—as a date. For more than—this."
"Brilliant!" Ron whooped at the sky before turning around and getting into an argument with his sister, and Harry turned around to jog across the grass to his godson, knowing that there was little more magical to a child than the snitch that won the game.
Harry feigned dumb, a tactic that always boded well for him around political types. Well, if he was honest, with just about everyone.
"I'll take that as a yes," Draco sighed. Harry couldn’t help but hiss when he prodded a gash; it felt like it cut down to the bone. "Let's get you upstairs so I can clean these up and put you to bed. Here." He stripped from the t-shirt he wore and wrapped a portion of it around Harry's fingers. The cotton smelled like him, was still warm. Harry held the big wadded ball of it up to his nose and inhaled greedily.
"Thanks a mil for that." He looked down and forced himself to keep from grinning. "Anyway, half of the job is getting your picture taken, and if they wanted a model, they should well hire one. I could go on, but long story short, I'm not the man for the job."
"Beautiful," Draco whispered, and Harry allowed it. Watched as his whole body went tight when Draco added another finger to stretch him, pumping his hand leisurely, like he could do this all day, like it wasn't obscene. How obvious it was that he needed to be Draco's. How he already was.
Options fast fading, Harry wanted to round the corner and rejoin his friends, end the awkward, painful nightmare that he'd landed in, and that's when it came to him.
"Firewhisky or..." He let the sentence dangle, trying to glean whether Harry would recognize the term.
It seemed that Narcissa had enough love in her to look mollified, but not enough to admit she was wrong, apparently.
Draco’s fingers wander deeper into the black thicket. His hair is silkiest there, just behind the ears, and sure, it’s a risk to put his whole hands and wrists through the bars, but a little praise and a soft touch off the top usually calms him down.
“You picked out box seats for an entire season of the Cannons all on your own, I’m afraid. Need I remind you that I would
"I mean, I miss this in the morning." He licked his lips, wishing that the look of shock would fade from Draco's face.
Martin leaned back, satisfied. He was growing out a moustache, and it highlighted when he was pleased—he wiggled it under his nose, not unlike a rabbit. Harry was careful not to tell him this because under no circumstances did he want to hurt Martin's feelings. He liked Martin. Martin knew about his
"Will do," Harry demurred. "And thanks for allowing me to cook for you while in an apron; it's ever so kind of you." He thumbed at one of the circles under Draco's eyes, thought of asking him how he'd been sleeping, and if he'd been eating, and well, and what was it that had robbed him of his light—but he didn't. He wrapped his arms around him instead and hugged him tightly, and hoped. Sometimes it was all he could do.
"I know you said we could do more next time, but I want to visit New York City in the summertime. I think we're overdue a shopping trip if I recall correctly."
to take seriously, which is utter shite on their part, railing on about health and safety all bloody day, and yet my location goes to the highest bidder. Can't go in under the cloak or Polyjuice or a glamour and, I—I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I don't get out as often as I'd like, is all," he finished lamely.
"Wondered where you were," he said, and the brows relaxed slightly. Something was off, though—Draco didn't return to his shower. He felt the need to watch Harry, and the why of it became the question running through Harry's mind.
and closed her eyes in a state of bliss that Harry recognized, and in an instant, he'd needed Draco in a way that felt immediate, desperate.
"Now, please tell me what the fuck is going on with you tonight. I'm scared that you're—" Harry looked at him, and his clear grey eyes were wide with fright. He stopped to clear his throat. "That you're going to do something that you regret."
Ron clucked. "Not true. Malfoy was the first we thought of, and you don't see us trying to set you up with him, now do you?"
Draco barked a laugh that made Harry's shoulders release a bit of tension he hadn't known to be growing in them. The gin was creating a warm, squirmy feeling in his stomach.
"There was a crack—someone was there, and Apparated away. A photographer, I bet," Harry said, and Ron scratched something down. "Likely on staff or does spec work for WWN or The Prophet, considering they had it on-air so bloody fast. No one else I could see. I checked basic diagnostics and no Dark magic was at play, at least not the common kind. But there was something he said, it—"
"Cool. Awesome, yeah, that's great," Harry shook his head, as scoffing turned to laughter around him. At least Draco looked pleased, popping a olive into his mouth and smiling around it.
Harry slapped Malfoy’s hands away and waited for a beat to ensure that he’d given up. The floorboard creaked as he knelt, and he stilled every part of his body other than his hands. Malfoy sat up, allowing Harry to unwind criss-crossed cord from the upper hooks of his boots before he continued down to loosen the rest.
From behind closed lids, Harry rolled his eyes. He relented, though, and promptly turned over and propped himself up to take the mug from Draco, who held a mug of milky tea in his own. He was draped in a house robe, amazingly not dressed yet.
"Well. He's still got one until next February, I think," Harry said. Molly and Arther shared a look that was mostly concern. "That's good, isn't it?"
Harry was dithering over a Charms essay when she had him read over her careful cursive one last time.
"You look adorable," Harry said, blowing on his tea. There was nothing like a well-placed compliment to throw Draco for a loop, and now was no exception. It stopped him writing, pen tip pressed deeply into the paper, unmoving.
"You are Harry Potter. And I'm Draco. No, I'm not Draco, I'm Draco's friend. Because I'm Alex. Turner. I'm Alex Turner, I'm—oh my god, this is so embarrassing," he said, belatedly dropping Harry's hand and replacing the mascara wand in its tube. His eyebrows appeared missing behind a thick coat of make-up, but his eyes were fanned with the thickest, longest eyelashes Harry had ever seen on a human face. He was pretty sure that whatever he'd been planning to do with the mascara would be overkill.
"You can swallow alright? It doesn't hurt to talk?" Harry shook his head and Draco, apparently satisfied, crawled to sit next to him. He drew his wand from where it had been abandoned to the edge of the bed and cast
Something heavy scrapes the floor above them, and Draco closes his eyes. If he’s lucky, it’ll be the rubber ended mallet and not the crowbar. He hates what happens to his teeth with the crowbar.
"I'm sleeping again. I was becoming afraid after you left, that I might never sleep properly without your Dreamless Sleep again."
They moved in unison as Draco rocked deeper. Harry squeezed his free hand under his body and took himself in hand. He stroked the velvety-hardness of his own shaft with a loose fist, the nerves endings in the head too sensitive to bear touching for very long. Pleasure radiated out from his centre and down to the tips of his curled toes. From the way Draco gripped him, he knew that he was losing himself to it too.
"I retain value so long as there’s a chance that I make a name for myself in reputable society—pureblood society. To marry, to produce an heir, those are things they need from me to love me the way they want to. I’m spoiled goods if their people know that I’m disfigured, sick in mind, you know—" he placed a chaste kiss to his cheek, cold and dry like tissue paper, "—more than just experimenting."
And then there was a moment in the summer of 1999 when the photos stopped—radio silence. Harry turned the articles over to make sure he wasn't missing anything—he looked up to find that Gertie had left during his review, implying that she didn't have any further messages for him secreted away in her feathers. The papers weren't about to bring Harry the clue he was looking for.
Harry kissed the tip of Draco’s leaking cock one last time and rejoined him, accepting the bite to his bottom lip as punishment for pulling out in the first place. To be honest, there was nowhere he wanted to be more than inside Draco, and this time, when he lined up, he slotted nearly home. Both of them moaned at the feeling.
"What can I say? I was born with two left feet," he said. "The real question is: when did you become so good at it?"
"You're bluffing," Harry said. He huffed a laugh, but Justin only cocked his head, stepped closer, dangerously close. Harry could smell him now, like musk and gasoline over the petrichor smell of rain, and the tang of blood running down the back of this throat. A dangerous combination; explosive, deadly.
"We went to school togeth—Well, you already knew that and, I've, um, we've seen one another sometimes. With work stuff. He's a good guy, these days and it's just, I hadn't thought before, how he and Teddy are, er, related. Maybe they should meet each other? That seems, uh, fair. Good? That seems good."
That was what it took for Draco to relent. "Good boy," he whispered, nudging inside, and then, because he knew he could take it, sliding all the way in.
“What—” Draco went to speak, but his question was lost as Harry's eyes closed, and his lips landed first, stealing the words from his mouth. Eyelashes fluttered against his cheekbone, soft as a moth's wings as Draco seemed unsure as to whether he should close his eyes or not. He’d been caught by surprise and went stiff, the momentum Harry proceeded into the kiss with landing against an unmovable force.
He stepped forwards to close the distance between them, hands sliding around Draco's hips to clasp around his lower back.
"Thanks," Harry said, though it was muffled, his cheek pressed awkwardly into Ron's chest. He was in shoes and Harry was barefoot, so their height discrepancy had never been more obvious. Harry was glad that Ron instinctively ducked down a bit to make the angle more comfortable. They shared a deep breath, and Ron didn't pull away when his phone vibrated from his pocket.
"There's nothing the matter with you," Ron said, brushing it off. Harry blinked hard, making tight fists, thumbnails finding soft flesh, willing himself not to lose control.
"What kind of threats?" There was the rustle of paper. Harry realized dimly that of course there would be notes, a report, everything. This wasn't for him to sort out on his own. More than a friend, Ron was an Auror, and that made what he was doing his initial statement.
Draco allows his head to fall back into empty space, his neck a perfect match for the width of the sofa back. He closes his eyes and bites his lip. Resisting the urge to pant like a dog.
"Harryyyyy," Ron warned, drawing his name out into a long, annoying sound. Harry huffed, covered his face with the blankets. He'd be safer from the ensuring smacks, this way. He opted to speak very quickly, like maybe that way Ron wouldn't be able to pick up on the details.
“S’my journal,” Harry mumbled into his chest. “And, and—s’bout me. It makes me happy if you’re happy,” Harry said. “You need anything,
Really, he didn’t like the fact that living things slobbered and shit. Couldn’t abide whining, be it Draco for a toy or a barnyard cat looking for spot of attention.
With a strength that belied his six centuries on the planet, Kreacher pushed at the backs of Harry's legs, causing him to nearly trip over himself on his way to the table.
Harry thought about it, of the times Draco recoiled from his touch with a hiss or when an unknown strain drained from him when he sat in the bath, submerging the waxy skin of his arm in hot water after a long day of working with his hands and forcing those tendons to flex and stretch. He was about to say
Harry, nearly twenty-one, pushed, unaware and laughing, into the fitness equipment storage room after a game of shirts and skins. Expecting a stash of gillyweed and a quart of gin.
“Oh come on! Please? If it’s a secret, you can whisper it to me,” Harry said. Draco’s smile sparkling, eyes all mischief. He pulled in close, lips to the shell of Harry’s ear as Harry held his breath.
"I, er. I can't tell you that. Yet," he added, at her raised brow. "I'm waiting until I'm sure it's serious."
He stopped, swallowed the thought. He hadn't had a day's rest all month, because between work, and voluntary positions, and Victory Day activities he hadn't felt able to say no to, and on top of that, Draco's needs, Harry hadn't had more than the handful of hours each night to sleep before the next thing was due. But he couldn't start complaining to Draco—couldn't complain to anyone, barely even his therapist, with whom he'd skipped his last two sessions anyway.
Next was the sitting room, filled with the scraggly sunlight of an overcast day. A dark purple plant in a low pot pulsed with a soft, ominous light, throwing shadows around the simple furniture. Curiously, a television's blank screen acted as a mirror, reflecting Harry's serious face back at him. Harry backed out of the room and shut the door behind him—one wasn't friends with Neville Longbottom for as long as he'd been without developing healthy respect and fear of magical plants one didn't know the names of. That, and he didn't want to know how, or why, Draco Malfoy had a television. Whatever the reason, it couldn't be good.
." She gave him a serious look, but Harry's enthusiasm for what it felt like to have the person you loved say it back burned off whatever remnants of uncertainty he had about the meeting of his two worlds. "Where is Draco?"
Draco gave him a look from beneath low lids. "Try again next week, and Victoria sends me our press clippings."
The man’s right hand hasn’t slowed in his wanking in his stretchy trousers throughout the conversation. He shakes his head.
"I know," Bill said, then frowned. "Well, actually I don't. All I know is I feel like a right bastard for even repeating it, and I
"You know what they say," Draco started, but Harry cut him off, needed their mouths connected, fingers working the little buttons of his shirt open. The cuffs frustrated him; clothes were a nuisance anyway, and as he huffed and pulled at the sleeve the rest of Draco's clothes fell to the floor literally in stitches.
"You do that. I'm sure this lass has a mother that wouldn't like to learn how she came to get a ticket for lewdness in public now, would she?"
Noah closed one eye, peering at Harry with the other. Joviality still pulled his facial muscles up into a loose smile, and whatever cocktail of drugs and drink he was on made him unobservant of the changes in the atmosphere. He hadn't caught on to the sourness within Harry—Harry was fairly certain that he didn't practice much empathizing.
"Is that what you think of me?" He exhaled, took another puff and held it. He craved more of anything, more than how he usually felt. "That I'm undead?"
"Potter, my good man, honestly? Honestly? The best, happiest we've seen him in years has been during this whole clandestine tryst he started up with you. You've got to understand that you're not what makes him better, or what makes him worse, but that he clearly has an easier go of—I dunno,
"Yes, really. Otherwise, I look like a ghost haunting the streets. Do you think a straight man has enough sense to ask for this haircut? These are this season's fucking Tom Ford sunglasses. You and I, walking together, it's obvious that we're—"
"Here," Harry snapped a hand out to grab them from her and held them in front of her squealing face. This kept her from stealing his glasses, the true reason she'd started patting his face, and placated her from the impending meltdown she'd been facing.
Draco spoke slowly, like what he was telling Harry required explaining. "What I'm telling you is that I'm actually alright."
and lets on that you're making a lot of calls and SMS messages to a single unknown number in Chelsea, that he hopes she can figure out who that person is—and at some point, she brought the possibility of a story about you and Malfoy to Barney—"
Memories of Sunday night flashed through the forefront of Harry's mind and he set his jaw tightly, urging himself to hold steady. He was glad of Ron's presence at his left shoulder. Like a guardian angel, it felt good to know that he was there.
"Or something? Is that so?" She hummed a sound, mashing her lips together to keep from laughing outright at how flustered he obviously was.
The pitter-patter of conversation dried up all at once, making it all the more obvious when Andromeda lowered her cup and took a bracing breath.
Harry watched as Malfoy struggled not to laugh, which would be conceding the point. "Second, you like that? Fighting?"
"You want to get to know me," he said at length, pulling up tufts of fabric only to collapse them with a loose fist.
He looked to Draco, watching him expectantly. He'd get exasperated with Harry, eventually. It was essential to give him these outs, Harry decided. To let him know that he wouldn't have to feel guilty once he grew bored with him.
“We can’t make any promises now. It’s all about taking it one day at a time and letting your symptoms and your progress guide your recovery plan. But,” this word was enough to get Draco’s attention again, “in my experience, you could be able to return within about ten weeks if you continue to show signs of improvement.”
, if only they tried, that things, one day, would be normal. This would be normal—they would be able to rib one another, and Draco would slot in alongside Harry's friends who were indeed his family, and Harry would come to know more of Draco's very secretive past, learn the names of the friends he rarely mentioned, peel back the layers until he was invited to know the Draco that existed at the core of the one that the world got to see. Harry could picture his future, and it was wonderful.
Harry shook his head, no. It wasn't that he didn't care—he feared caring too much, and to that end, what he'd do to Noah next he saw him if he knew the depths of his degeneracy.
Because Draco's hands were on him too, and his scent was in his nostrils, sweet and clean, and he made the most decadent sound when Harry's hands held him closer. Draco pushed him roughly back so that Harry fell to the couch, and then he was on him again, straddling his lap. His mouth was a hot, wet thing against the stubble of Harry's jaw, that wonderful place where ear met neck. His bare hands cupped Harry's face and roamed his hair freely, tugging.
"I'd rather be careful," Harry mumbled, barely realizing what he was saying as he added his ring finger to the mix, and he honestly
"I'm serious." Ron was looking directly at him now, doing a poor job of containing his anger. "Answer the goddamn question."
In typical Bagman fashion, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Littered with Quidditch stars and their nubile partners, sponsored by Blishen’s Whisky (with free-pouring fountains of the stuff to be found in every room), the night ended for most party-goers the next morning with last-minute portkeys to dance parties in Berlin.
"I feel like a frog," he continued, to Draco's answering chuckle. Checking for enough space for circulation, like they'd been taught in Auror training.
"Ran into each other over the summer. Figured that we ought to try to bury the wand, so to speak." Draco turned his sparkling smile on Harry, his eyes telecasting mischief. "Potter's magnanimous like that."
"Pet," he said, eyes lighting up as he recognized Harry on his approach. His smile was short-lived. "What are you doing here?"
When he finished, they were both very still. Harry’s heart was in his throat, his breathing unexpectedly laboured. He hadn’t been so close to Malfoy—hadn’t knelt, gaze in line with his lap—in a very long time.
The table which Draco Malfoy, still bespectacled, was lounging on and smirking at him from, not unlike a very expensive cat. His shirt had fallen slightly more open, revealing an expanse of milky white skin and jutting collarbones, and Harry had rarely wanted to lick or suck a part of a person's body more than he did during that moment.
Ron pushed away his empty bowl and tilted his head, giving Harry a look that didn't require the added, "Come on, it is, and it doesn't hurt my feelings to admit it. Just—did he apologize? Was he hopelessly incapacitated, frozen into an iceberg? Not that I'm hoping for it, but was he at least attacked by werewolves, or something?"
"What are you on about?" A prickly feeling came over Harry's skin. He didn't like this word being thrown around—
“On my signal,” Draco said. His fingers loosening their grip on Harry’s, and that was a sign. Letting go.
On Harry's second visit to Victoria's office, she greeted him with a wet kiss for his cheek, giddy as he'd ever seen her.
, huh," Harry teased, playfully pinching his side. "I may be shorter than you, but I think you'll find I have no trouble in throwing you around."
"Free." Harry finished the sentence, and Malfoy snapped back to himself, the smile fading slightly. He tucked a strand of hair that'd fallen loose from his little ponytail back behind his ear.
"They're not nearly up to being judged yet, let alone by a Malfoy," he said. He gave in against his better judgement and rested the pads of his fingertips on Draco's outstretched palm.
He leaned in, leading with firm lips. Harry could feel his magic swirling, prodding at his own. He could
"Yes, it was necessary because the party was an introduction of sorts. I've been seeing someone, and we thought it best to finally introduce our friends to one another—"
"You say it like it’s a bad thing, not fighting," Harry said. When he squeezed his fingers, they didn’t squeeze back. His eyes had gone steely, staring out, not really seeing what was in front of them anymore.
"I wondered where the tartan had gone," he murmured. Harry made short work of the belt and fly between him and his goal, nosing at Draco’s growing erection through his pants until he popped the head free of the top elastic band. Draco hissed as the cold winter air hit the sensitive skin.
"The best you've got is a shared desk in an open office where they've crammed in all the other interns."
, he'd said again, fingers slipping into his hand at they stood at the perfume counter in the centre of the shopping mall, enunciating the
"Only if you promise to stop slathering me in that Muggle suncream every day. That stuff's a bloody nuisance, is what it is."
The cigarette was already lit, so all it took was a pull and your head was full of spun sugar. Fibreglass cutting brain mass into a bloody mist.
"I know," Harry said. The pain was a flare, there and gone in an instant. He blinked again; his eyelashes were wet, but he wasn't crying. He wouldn't, couldn't, not in front of Draco. "I do it all the time."
"Why can't we go back inside?" Draco asked as another flash went off and he turned to face it, remembering too late not to look directly in the camera. Harry fought the urge to wince—
He stood in semi-darkness, blinking blindly at fuzzy shapes. This wasn't home, but it was familiar. The smell of linseed oil and the feel of cool linoleum tiles underfoot. No birds chirping, no breeze from the window, but the murmuring of voices in the hall.
He pulled the blankets down and sat up all at once, face to face with a peeved Ron, both of them puffing angry breaths. "It's—I wanted to do it! Don't give me a hard time, okay? I'm trying. This is me really,
"Fuck," Draco whispered. His movements became jerky and fast, and he dragged his wet hand over to Harry's hip, his own orgasm now clearly unstoppable. Harry braced himself with a hand at the headboard, watching between their bodies as Draco disappeared into him again and again.
He didn’t get a chance to finish the thought. When the flush came again, and Malfoy slumped, spent against the wall. He accepted the glass of water Harry conjured and nudged into his hand.
If someone had asked him earlier in the day if he expected a letter from Draco, he would have told the truth—he wasn't sure. And he'd done a valiant job in not fixating on whether or not he'd receive a response. But there was something of finality to this silence, on this, the day after he'd shown his hand. It was now Draco who held all the cards—he could go to the press with Harry's letters, his naughty, hand-written notes, asking,
“Tell me about it,” Harry sighed, eyeing the growing inbox of voice messages, half personal, half work-related, all considered urgent by the sender. Their bags and papers and jackets took up an ever-increasing amount of space, though they were yet to be told off for having installed themselves in the canteen—Harry thought of it as
"Joking!" Harry said, hands up, exuberant as he was supposed to be. His lungs were barely working, he thought—he felt like he was drowning in plain air, but he could pretend. He was so very good at pretending, and he had to. He owed them this—an evening together without him being the center of attention, without causing them to worry. "I'm only joking. I'd crash it anyway if I weren't invited."
Hermione rubbed his back and they sat in silence that was eventually broken by Neville's enormous yawn, setting off a chain reaction of people calling it a night. Eventually, Mrs and Mr Weasley returned—"Molly and Arthur, we don't stand on ceremony," they said, with a set of hugs for Draco—and they were off, back at Grimmauld before they knew it.
Ron cricked his jaw, tossing the still unfinished paperwork out of the way. "I'm bloody furious with him, but fuck, he's not cut out for jail. Not even cushy Norwich barracks, and that likely won’t be his last stop."
Harry sighed again. A pressure headache was building behind his left eye, and he'd need something substantial for it when he got home. Was there ibuprofen back at Grimmauld? A pain potion? He'd be fucked if he had to Apparate into Diagon for a fresh bottle of Ogden's anytime soon, though, frankly, he couldn't imagine heading out for anything during the coming week sober.
"Yes, but I'm just saying," she said, directing a rather powerful charm to send the open bottle of red wine into her waiting hand, splashing a healthy pour into her glass.
"He is, isn't he?" Cissy responded, pulling Harry by his roots down to his natural limit and holding him there, and Harry
His mobile phone smacked into his fingers, smarting them. He hadn't consciously summoned it, yet there it was, obediently floating less than a foot above the tumbler, and he knew then what he was going to do.
Harry pulled his wand from his pocket and said the spell, cleaning not only his hand and Draco's stomach but apparently the entire stall as well, judging from the gust of lemon-balm scented air and sudden gleam to the metal fixtures of the toilet.
And then Harry couldn't be sure that what was happening was real anymore when Draco repositioned so that his thigh slid between Harry legs, his body a fiery mass, the thigh presenting something for Harry grind against. And Draco's cock was insistent, the head bumping into the skin above his hip, stamping precome into his skin.
They sat in stunned silence for a while, the ticking of a clock from another room clearly audible. As the seconds ticked on, Harry became increasingly aware that he was only covered by his pants and the blanket covering his lap, which he had to force himself not to clutch at it to cover the rest of him. He wasn't ashamed; he just preferred to share his body with people in near-total darkness, usually. Or better yet, with clothes on, where they couldn't trace the locket-shaped scar, for example, and ask
I keep it miniaturized," he defended the choice when Harry pointed out that he'd already started the journey with two suitcases to Harry's one. "It's not like I'm making you lug it about for me."
And though Harry hadn't any clue what kind of damage could be done to his bank vaults whilst on 5th Avenue with Draco Black, née Malfoy, he was sure there wasn't an amount of gold on the planet that could buy him happiness the way the smile that broke out across his face did at that moment.
That stopped him moving at all. His jaw clenched—Harry's answer angered him, somehow—maybe because it made him more sympathetic, or maybe because he assumed him to be lying. Either way, Draco's icy demeanour was fearsome.
He licked his lips, biting the bottom one. "I had favourites. Do you care to know which ones I liked best?"
? unspoken between them, but it was a cover. A cold wriggly thing moved through him, twisting around his insides.
Harry did, grinning, wiping come from his face with the heel of a palm, the back of his hand, eyes never wavering from Cissy's.
"Nothing." He sucked in that bottom lip to catch a drip. "I'm not hiding anything if that's what you're insinuating. At least not in here."
"I finished the book," Draco said. He rolled his wand and cast wordlessly, the hot breath of a warming charm enveloping them.
He wasn't running off, and he wasn't yelling, so Harry knew it was his time to pour it out—everything he'd stuffed down would be brought up and out, into the light.
"Cause I went and got pissed with the boys, and thas not good," he mumbled. Draco lowered his mangled hand—all patched up now—and raised his good one to his lips, kissed his knuckles.
"Dead boring to be honest, can't hardly tell what's he's been dragged in for. Not that I wouldn't normally be all for raking a Malfoy over the coals or anything—I've still got the scars from my stay at the Manor—but it's brutal."
He makes no sounds, teeth finding new holds to bite on that lip as he sinks down, tense as though he's taken it all even though the ring of muscle at his entrance will barely permit two fingers, let alone your cockhead.
of his own resurrection, making the knowledge of their deaths newly difficult.
