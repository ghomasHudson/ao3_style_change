Time stands still as I let my eyes rove over his body, finding it both familiar and new. Not only is he wearing Muggle clothes, but it’s a tight t-shirt and jeans. Beyond the long teal hair up in a messy bun, tattoos cover his arms. Is the Dark Mark still there, hidden amongst the black ink, or is it long gone?
“Harry… Is everything alright? I shouldn’t have poked fun the other day, but am I missing something? It only occurred to me today that you’ve always avoided the lake. I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.” A hand tentatively touches Harry’s rounded spine.
She moved around 12 Grimmauld Place as though she lived there: boiling water in a kettle, grabbing their favourite tea, and choosing biscuits from his cupboard. He had offered for her and Ron to stop by anytime, but it was rare for them to take him up on it. His friends had their own lives, Hermione with Viktor and Ron with Luna, but he loved the domesticity of sharing his home.
“You’re wondering if there’s something to the ‘Robin Hood’ reference that the Prophet used today?” she asked and, at his nod, continued, “I think it could be a trap, but it is odd to add protections and complex ones too. What does your gut say?”
Malfoy advances slowly, as though approaching a wild animal, picking up a menu along the way and sliding it to me.
I want to cry all over again at his words.  I love how Draco, who always masked his true feelings with layers of insults and arrogance as a child, became a father who pushes for open communication of emotions.  I asked him once about it, and he said that our son would only really understand happiness and right from wrong if he understood that all feelings are acceptable, even anger and sadness.
At the mere thought of those long, powerful limbs, Harry feels his body react and his eyes snap open. Draco rolls over to face him, but Harry curls up and turns away.
My questions multiply as time passes, and it’s infuriating. What else have I missed? Why is Potter being so pleasant to me? Why is he
A wall? He looked around, mindlessly taking the glass of water that Draco pushed into his hand. He took a shaky sip. The gardens were gone. He was in a bedroom: crisp white bed sheets on a single bed as the focal point, with a wooden desk and a beige armchair in the corner. There was an open suitcase at the foot of the bed.
Closing my eyes to the near-blinding stadium lighting, I breathe in the unique combination of broom polish, leather, and grass that has become so familiar. Then, grabbing my trusty Firebolt Xtra, we start the march to the pitch.
“What if it’s like security experts in the Muggle world? Someone hacks or breaks into a system to show its flaws,” he countered.
I’d shrunk it and kept it in the breast pocket of that awful, uncomfortable suit that Coach insisted on after watching Muggle footballers in the Premier League give press conferences. How one can pay hundreds of Galleons for customization and layers of complex spells, and
“Taking your chances today? Not sure how Dray does it, but these books are always a perfect fit for their readers.” The employee grins as he inputs the price into the cash register.
The Weasleys are leaving, so I’m out of time to rewrite the letter.  I fold it and put it inside my bedside table with my travel bag.
Draco enjoyed the casual banter throughout the meal and relaxed as it felt like all the other outings they had been on together, even if those almost always included one or a couple of their friends.
She spoke in broken English, and Harry used his Muggle credit card to pay, frustrated at the paper trail it would leave, but there was no way to exchange his pounds to euros otherwise. He hoped this trip was worth it.
rubbish. Blood purity? Rubbish. We lost a lot, and I became head of the family and had to focus on restoring our home.”
Black fringe matted to his forehead, Harry’s face was unguarded and raw. Draco’s eyes devoured every twitch of the muscles. Harry’s emerald eyes widened every time Draco’s cock hit his prostate.
“Draco, we believe you and we will fight back. As long as organisations like VILE exist in the shadows, there will always be the next Voldemort waiting to rise. Harry wasn’t sure how he’d be received, so I stopped by to suggest a meeting between the five of us on how to proceed from here. We need manpower and a plan.” She gently reached over to put a hand on his shoulder for a moment.
I read the letter several times.  I feel numb, but I can see that my tears are dripping onto the parchment, blurring the words, and joining the tear stains from when it was written.
“I’ve lived here almost my whole life… and it’s never… Oh no. Oh no. Harry get out. I don’t want you to see me like this.”
“Okay,” Harry replied, gripping his wand, monitoring the entrances for any sign of a wizard. He had only seen Muggles pass by.
Draco, on the other hand, went straight to the warmer hues and pulled several shades of red and pink off the wall. After all, red is the colour of passion, and if their rivalry at Hogwarts had been anything, it was passionate. Even now, years later, when their tempers flared, it was a sight to behold.
“Because of a bloody question on a post-it?” My voice rises and our coworkers start to look over, so I flick my wand to slam the door to our office in their faces. Then I add some privacy spells for good measure.
“Malfoy, don’t mess with me.” Harry’s frown was back, and his brows knit together with anger. “I’ve read all the reports hundreds of times. I’m giving you one chance and if you lie… that’s it.”
He flushes a little before muttering an “Excuse me” and going off to help another client who’s just sat down. Satisfied, I drain my glass as I watch his retreating back. This Draco with his tattoos and piercings blushes
He wanted to crow with victory as Harry’s pupils dilated further and his hand moved faster. The sound came out as a gasp instead.
store, however, seems to be a standalone. The picture window shows a display of current bestsellers and a written promise that “Every book opens a new world — like magic!”
I steal some of kitchen’s energy to turn the sink on. It was a well-intentioned reminder, but instead he looks terrified.
He smirked as he adjusted his emerald green bow tie in the mirror. He ran a hand over his hair, the signature platinum gleaming in the light. While he didn’t admire his father for his views, he did admire his father’s style. Both Malfoy men maintained their hair’s silkiness with a pomade brewed from a secret family recipe.
Harry was not the one-night-stand guy, nor the guy who usually shagged on the first date. He had always felt vulnerable exploring his sexuality, exposing his body to others, and trusting them to take care of him. He overanalyzed everything in bed, and nights often ended with him unsatisfied, even if he’d come.
Everyone on the house team had known their captain was gay and protected that secret carefully. His temper was infamous and he would have retaliated without hesitation. Over the years, Draco hadn’t heard much about the Chaser’s private life, so he didn’t know if Flint was single or not.
Harry let out an audible moan of pleasure as he lowered himself into the water. Letting his head fall back, he actively focused on releasing the tension in his muscles. His back had been hunched over a desk for too long.
Harry was transfixed, wondering how all the couples flowed so seamlessly around the room. The music shifted, and everyone on the dance floor took a break, talked amongst themselves, and greeted friends with kisses on the cheeks.
“Two votes for that’s flirting from over here,” came a distant laughing voice: Neville, this time. Draco was glad they couldn’t see the slight flush on his face at their words.
“We were kids then. I had a crush on you, and I was stupid back then. We all were and were dragged into a shitshow of a war. Can’t we just move on?”
I had been greedy, letting myself accept Harry’s love and falling in love with him.  I knew I didn’t deserve him, and I still don’t, but I took advantage of his kindness and his heart.
“I know you must’ve been really scared because you were lost.  Just like I was that time at the store, but we found you!  I didn’t even get to hear a bedtime story last night so can you read Babbitty Rabbity to me twice tonight?  I love Dad, but he’s not you.”
Out of the corner of my eye, I spot a large basket, painted with green and grey stripes. There’s a sign hanging from the handle: “Let the Book Choose You.”
“I’ve been restoring Malfoy Manor and learning to take over the estate. Otherwise a bit of this and that,” he waved his hand airily, hoping to discourage further discussion with his vague answer—no such luck.
Cursing the Weasleys, he grabbed the bright red fedora with a black trim. The Headless Hat was as tacky as every other product in the joke shop. He tried to charm it black after he had worked tirelessly with Blaise to strengthen the invisibility field beyond the head. He suspected, however, that the twins intentionally made Colour Change Charms incompatible; it was cherry red no matter which incantation he tried.
The sound of approaching footsteps on stone echoes against the walls, crescendoing as his husband walks into the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. Harry doesn’t move a muscle, willing the blush on his cheeks to die down.
Draco sat with his hands propping him up beyond him, and Harry kept his hands in his lap, trying to hide his nerves. He leaned into the bare shoulder of the man next to him, enjoying his solidity and warmth.
Out of all the plans that had fallen by the wayside, at least he still had a fortune and the Manor. Their ancestral home, however, had been corrupted by the presence of the Dark L—Voldemort. It had taken a considerable amount of the money leftover in their coffers to restore it.
I wipe my eyes quickly and pick him up.  Regulus Hyperion Potter-Malfoy. He’s the best gift you’ve ever given me.  He’s so little in my lap, and I can’t help but wrap him in my arms, holding him to my chest.  He’s a physical embodiment of our love, and just like how I refuse to let you go, I can’t let him go.
supposed to be a wedding. He felt even more daft thinking back to his thought process during the ceremony.
Harry had been so dominant in their entire interaction so far, yet now he seemed ready to willingly surrender that control and let Draco take care of him. Draco’s chest warmed at the show of trust. As they stared into each other’s eyes, he instinctively knew they’d be equal partners in their relationship.
I write on a post-it (Hermione’s gotten Draco hooked on them and he considers them one of the best Muggle inventions ever) and leave it on the counter:
“Malfoy?” I breathe out the name, unable to believe that thousands of miles away, in Muggle Boston, we’d meet again after a decade.
Everyone mostly left him and Harry alone as they went back to their conversations or greeted people as they arrived. People were surprisingly pleasant to him, despite knowing his past. Still, he could not stop himself from self-consciously pulling on his sleeve to make sure it hid the faded Dark Mark.
And so Draco found himself on the back of a motorbike, his fingers digging into James’ worn leather jacket. He’d let Draco borrow an older jacket of his, and he couldn’t help the warmth that had bloomed at the gesture.
I gasp and stop in the doorway.  I see my son, my adorable son, stare back at me.  There’s a terrified look in the eyes that match mine.
It took all of Draco’s willpower not to grill James with questions every time they saw each other. He’d found out little tidbits, like that he lived with a young couple on a dairy farm in Bristol, that he worked on motorcycles in his spare time, and that he knew nothing at all about his childhood or his birth parents.
Draco wondered if he should have brought gifts for everyone when the presents were distributed, and even he had a package.
Harry let Draco take over, sliding two fingers in and out. Harry’s eyes slid closed, hips bucking at the intrusion.
Draco’s face hurt from his grin when they landed, his fingers still curled around the Snitch. Harry hugged him tightly despite losing, and they could feel each other’s heartbeats still racing from the residual energy of the match. Harry had likely given countless victory hugs before, but it was the first time with Draco.
“Today’s been amazing, Draco. Work has been so stressful, I haven’t been able to relax and have so much fun in a long time,” Harry stated, bumping his shoulder as he dragged a chair over to join Draco’s table.
A small murmur of, “Go back to sleep,” is enough to send me rocketing out of bed and diving for those black briefs. As I hop and jam both legs successfully through the correct leg holes, I zoom around the room to collect the rest of my outfit.
“Draco! It’s such a pleasure to see you again! And you! You must be Mr Potter,” a petite woman entered the room, her white hair pulled back in a messy bun. Draco leaned down to kiss her on both of her papery, wrinkled cheeks.
I’m running to the station, then packing into a train full of tourists who are asking, “Is this the train to Fenway? Kenmore?” Because, of course, there’s a Red Sox game on the day I actually care about getting somewhere on time.
He only heard an echo of, “Bro was that a fucking red hat?” and the call for backup before he landed back next to the small single bed.
I see the shame and pain on Master Malfoy’s face. Sweat is shining on his brow from discomfort. He looks exhausted.
The tears do fall this time.  You can’t tell a child that his beloved, but occasionally idiotic Daddy loves him so much that he thought he wasn’t good enough.  I hold him close to my chest again until I can recompose myself.
Dad laughs for the first time in two days, and he helps me get ready quickly so we can head out.  He makes me count the full 2 minutes when brushing my teeth, even though he only runs a brush through my hair twice.  Daddy would be horrified if he knew.
The couple took the two remaining seats, and Harry had to stifle a laugh as Ron’s wife clearly tried to distract him by handing him the plate of biscuits from the nearest side table.
Swirling his hands through the water reminded him of how long it had been since he had left his ex. He mentally calculated: 2 years and 3 months (give or take) of single life. Not that he couldn’t pull, but it was hard to find a suitable match with his job and fame.
The heist in Seville wasn’t just a hot topic in the wizarding world; it also had made the Muggle papers for weeks now. Everyone was speculating about the man in the red hat and matching trench coat. The rumours were wild, especially when they had finished adding the protection spells and anonymously returned the chalice.
Malfoy, his childhood nemesis and secret crush, was a thief. The man he had lusted over and had even imagined bringing back to his hotel room that very night… a criminal. And Harry, despite the rumours that he was a shoo-in to be the next Head Auror, had been duped. Like a fool. Worse, he wouldn’t have even known if Malfoy hadn’t transported him out.
I remember on a trip to New York City before we had kids, he once mentioned how nice it would be to live there and be able to slip into anonymity.  We seriously considered it, but then Reg came along, and we wanted to be closer to family.  If it’s a place in Britain or on the Continent, he could easily get there, but he probably wouldn’t have risked crossing the Atlantic.
Harry ordered a “couple’s combo.” Draco started, and his heart jumped at the implication, but then he looked at the pricing. The combo was the most cost-effective option for getting popcorn and drinks for two. That’s all it was.
I just stay in bed and eat the toast that Harry left for me while I was asleep.  It’s cold now, but the nausea is gone, and my body needs sustenance, so I gobble it down.
“So… what? We’re not having enough sex for you? You’ve had to use your hand more than before because I’m not there to fuck you? Fucking Salazar, Harry!”
“Ah! Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter, please come this way to choose your colours for the evening,” he welcomed before ushering them to an open door.
“God Save the Queen” plays as we take to the sky, circling the stadium while a giant lion with a mane of fire roars in the center of the pitch before twisting and morphing into a whinnying unicorn, then finally transforming into a dragon. The dragon breathes out a plume of fire, heating the entire stadium several degrees warmer before flying out into the sky. My eyes can’t help but follow its twisting path until it’s just a speck in the distance.
Harry let her drag him into a whirlwind of introductions since everyone already seemed to know his former housemate. He was glad when she let him sit in one of the chairs along the wall when dancers gathered again in the open space: hands pressing into hands and arms wrapping around shoulders.
“Isn’t that the one that promises to be a ‘full-feature gastronomic experience’ or some pretentious bullshit like that?”
Maybe someday I’ll be able to share all of that anguish, hope, and desperation that the painting evokes in me with Harry, but not today. He’s made his interest clear in me, despite the meager encouragement I’ve given him, and I wonder if he sees my soul as worthy and light.
Oliver squeezes my shoulder as the rest of the team lines up behind us. We might be rivals in the National League, but today we’re a united front, playing for the bragging rights of our country (and of course, the 10,000 Galleons each that go to each of the winning team members).
Today was one of those days when he believed that career counselling at Hogwarts misled students. McGonagall had warned him about the lengthy auror training program and the necessity of reacting well under pressure. Sure, even after the war, there was the occasional Dark Lord wannabe or a manhunt for a Death Eater who had managed to escape in the confusion of the Final Battle, but most days, there was just a lot of boring paperwork.
Harry Potter looks extremely fuckable, especially as he tugs off his suit jacket and rolls up those crisp white sleeves…
For the first time in years, Harry’s training failed him, and he was too slow to react. Malfoy took an earpiece from his ear and shoved it into Harry’s.
“Hold up. Are you seriously trying to tell me that there’s an international big baddie organisation out there and no one knows?”
Draco stopped and stared as their fingers intertwined. The contrast of their skin, the hair on Harry’s knuckles, the calloused palm against his own. He forgot to breathe, then gasped shakily when his body demanded oxygen.
I’m intrigued, maybe from the unique combination that reminds me of Slytherin, maybe because the basket is comically large for the table that it rests on. Nestled inside are books wrapped in plain brown paper, each with a brief description or a miniature illustration to demonstrate the key themes and the genre of the work. At the very bottom is a small blurb from an employee (“Dray”) about why they recommend it.
But the way he carries himself, the nervous way he taps the fingers of his left hand against his leg, the wrinkling of his brow when he’s frustrated or confused… none of that has changed.
“Draco?” Harry sits up and rubs his eyes in the same innocent way that a child does. It’s enough to make me hesitate in my quest to find a shirt, because there’s no way we’re avoiding that awkward chat now.
The ministry hadn’t allowed Draco to use his wand, so he’d seen no other choice than to lug his heavy trunk up to the second floor by himself. By the time he reached the top, he could feel sweat beading on his brow. He didn’t see another student until he was halfway down the second floor corridor.
“Hey Longbo… sorry… Neville,” Draco greeted, catching himself on the name when Blaise’s eyes flashed with censure. The blond added a practised, charming smile, earning yet another warning.
“He’s really changed. So has Draco. It’s been about five months. Sorry for not telling sooner,” Neville blushed.
,” Harry thought. The t-shirt clung to the muscles his friend had gained from working outside, and his skin was tanned. While Harry had never been and would never be interested romantically, Neville was undoubtedly attractive.
Flower sculptures in the shapes of the bride and groom flanked the entrance to the topiary garden. His first thought was that Blaise’s boyfriend would have loved to see them. Maybe Longbottom had grown on him after all.
The past month had been unexpected. As Draco laid on his bed, he threw the charmed Galleon up in the air with one hand and caught it with the other. Back and forth, up and down. The Order meeting was in a few hours. Hermione and Harry had been encouraging, but he and Blaise still felt like they were walking into the lion’s den. Literally, given that most of those invited had been Gryffindors.
Draco pulled away and licked his lips, and Harry could only stare. He wished they weren’t in public so he could finally lean over and kiss him.
“It looks like the ceremony will start soon, but I would love to discuss it later. Perhaps during a dance at the reception?” Draco softened his voice, channelling the commanding presence he had learned from watching his godfather.
But it’s only an instant of confusion before there’s gentle prodding and a tentacle slips in, and it’s more tantalizing than Harry even imagined. So full. The wicked promise of a stretch. The helplessness of trusting the Squid to not push him too far. So. Fucking. Full.
So they’d cracked open a bottle of wine James had snuck in and settled on Draco’s bed for a game of Rummy. If James had thought it strange that he’d had to teach Draco how to play, he didn’t mention it.
“George! Don’t be so rude to a guest!” Molly Weasley barked at her son, before softening, “Of course Harry dear, you’re family so any guest of yours is welcome. Welcome and thank you, Draco. Let me know if you need anything.”
Blaise had learned precisely how to toe the line of Draco’s temper over their years of friendship. The only other person who riled Draco up so quickly was Harry Potter, but it had been months since they last met and longer still since they had talked.
“Little Dragon Lover, of course! Do you not love his ‘little dragon’? Ow, Hermione!” Blaise cut out, and they heard Hermione’s angry whispers in the background. “Anyway, the cathedral’s closing soon, so you should be able to walk in with the Muggles if you hurry.”
My unlikely savior was Oliver Wood, who came into the Hog’s Head one Monday evening after meeting with Madam Hooch. Dressed all in white, he looked like a very fit angel to my inebriated eyes. And, in the end, he’d really been an angel, in a way.
“Er... that he needs time to himself.  We can’t just search everywhere and I want as few people to know about this as possible,” I explain.
I sit next to my son on the couch, so I can stroke his hair and feel his solidity while I brainstorm a list of places Draco could have gone.  I know all of his friends, and I can’t imagine any of them accepting the situation.
Couples held each other close, moving in sync. One wizard stood still, letting his partner wrap her leg around him, showing off her talents and her purple strappy heels. Another couple moved around the floor, gracefully pivoting to avoid other couples. Some embraces were incredibly close, barely any distance between the bodies.
Unexpectedly, he swears. A long stream of “fucking hells” and “there’s no fucking ways” and it hits me that he cut off all contact with the Wizarding world when he’d moved. The Ministry acquitted him and his mother of all charges after the War, and then he’d disappeared. Apparently, he went to the Muggle world, a full ocean away.
Draco had to look away from Harry’s guarded face. He raised his arm to run his fingers through his hair and winced as pain shot through him. With the adrenaline pumping through his veins, he hadn’t initially registered any pain from the spell that had hit him seconds before leaving.
I try to wake up.  I pinch my thigh and then dig my nails into the flesh until it’s so obviously painful that I can’t deny it.  This is reality.
The room reminds me of the Manor, from back when I’d thought money and status were all that mattered. Back when I’d
Yes, I’ve heard of the little boy in my mother’s letters. Those same letters always beg me to come home, even though I always say no. She, Pansy, and Blaise are the only ones I still have any contact with from my former life.
I look at our things: the Moka pot we bought on our holiday to Florence for our six month anniversary, the formal portrait from our wedding and bonding ceremony over the sofa, the misshapen clay bowl Reg made in art class, the armchair that I hate but Harry insists is too comfortable to give up.  I close my eyes, savoring my last moments of being surrounded by
“No, no, please, go ahead,” says Lupin, apparently completely out of it.  It’s at least five minutes before he cottons on.  “Wait.  Who else is here?”
Harry’s not sure if this is better.  “It’s important!” he complains, trying to get them back on track, trying not to say it so loudly that Rose and Hugo overhear.  “A gay man fancied me.”
Both Draco and Harry were going to father children and repopulate their names.  It was two-and-a-half years since Draco’s parents had died, and they would have pointed out long ago that neither he nor Harry was going to get anywhere if they only spent parties in each other’s company – don’t make me spell it
The chat with James Potter is postponed, but Draco can’t avoid the summons to breakfast, the Saturday after Lily Potter returns.  He understands why.  He can’t leave Teddy Lupin to meet his father on his own, even if he’s not sure at all what comfort the boy will derive from a formerly estranged cousin.
Or – that’s not quite right.  It seems clear, more accurately, maybe less, that Sirius Black is someone whom Harry never knew, who never knew him.  So there’s no way for the person he remembers to come back to him from the dead.
“We will?” Harry asks, still brushing soot from his jeans.  The fire in Andromeda’s house is gas, so who even knows how that got there.
,” he spat, “to dream of being Mr Ginny, of proposing to some girl-woman that my family barely knows, a few nights out and a bit of bunking up all I get to decide that it’s serious.”
“Draco,” Harry tells him, meeting his eyes and trying to explain, before he’s looking at James and he sees it, how angry the man is, how upset
“Get in,” he instructs, shuffling back on the mattress, hooking his head to the side, not sure what he’ll do if Draco doesn’t.
” Molly asked him, looking concerned.  She must have been listening to the radio, Harry thought at the time, because this wasn’t the pronoun he’d been expecting, no matter that it was the one he’d been using.  “Hogwarts must be keeping you…”
It’s by accident, then, really, that the fifth person Harry comes out to after his wife and their counsellor and Ron and Hermione is his twenty-two-year-old orphaned, teddy-bear godson.
A bolt of laughter comes out of Ron, and it is utterly wonderful to see him so happy, his face heavily freckled with the summer, affection sparkling in his eyes.
“What is it?” Harry asks, looking at the phone.  “I need to give the kids my number,” he accepts.  He likes the mirrors; they feel personal, and they don’t rely on signal or power.  They’re secure.
He remembers that he can speak.  “Draco,” he says, as a prompt.  He doesn’t want to be seduced; he wants to love him.
“Every time I think about not coming home, I think about the fact that I won’t be able to give it to him,” he says about the feather, spinning it again in the light, looking down.  “I think about what Dora would say,” he goes on, looking towards the horizon.  “And then I think about the fact that she never did stand up to me, and it’s likely that she wouldn’t say a thing.”
Potter cuts straight through it.  “I might as well be on my own for all that you’ve deigned to talk to me.”  He snaps, actively angry, “How long do you intend to hold Peter over us, Remus?  Or will it be me alone who gets this
With a wry smile, Hermione rolls her eyes.  She’s entirely poised, Ron’s engagement ring glinting on her finger.  “Like life,” she suggests, before giving him a look.  “We told Molly that we thought we’d leave the wedding till after –”
McGonagall’s been looking at him strangely, maybe because of the pudding, more likely because Harry and Neville are being cool with each other.  It’s not Neville.  Neville’s clearly forgiven Harry for the wedding; Harry’s annoyed with him for it and freezing him out.
“And I too,” Kingsley replies.  Somehow it’s clear that the joke is on James.  “Indeed, I heard such an awful many good things, once upon a time.”
“I’ve got my Firebolt,” Harry says, feeling the weight of his hands on his knees.  It’s difficult to raise his eyes from the shape of the broomstick.  It’s difficult to speak.
Fuck it, Draco thinks, full of some emotion that he knows he shouldn’t feel.  Fuck it all, Harry; don’t you see?  What’s so special about this one rule, when magic ignores so many others?
Neville and Luna and Liz are out in the gardens somewhere, looking at Narcissa’s old plants with Gary (“It’s like Frank and Al had a baby,” Gary said on seeing Neville, sounding amazed.
James looks over his shoulder at the witch cleaning her rose-covered cottage.  She doesn’t seem to be bothered by a word of what they’re saying, either entirely deaf or wearing headphones, Harry thinks, which would be absurd.
thought that I was joking – thumped me on the back so hard, I nearly fell over.”  Potter laughs to finish his story  “But I think I made Moony cry.  Lily looked at me and she said, ‘Potter.  How many years are you going to spend asking, if I say no?’  Best moment of my life, because that was what she said when she meant but wouldn’t say yes.”
unpacked…” he reaches his point, no irony at all.  “You took over the bed; I had to sort it out before I could sleep.”
Harry’s forgotten that this is where they were, a place with glittery bears.  They're dating, he supposes, but the word doesn't feel special enough; it feels too real.
“I couldn’t tell you,” Draco replies, risking a glance.  Though he imagines that it’s exactly what he would do himself in the same situation.
Moony’s briefcase comes next, brown and tied up with string, and Harry dashes to grab it, because it isn’t his to be laid bare.
The words come out clipped, not in a sneer but something scathing nonetheless, the WWN turned waspish.
smug-looking Sirius emerges in black jeans and bare feet and a t-shirt that isn’t his, its colour an odd sort of grey-mustard yellow.
With a look of pure malevolence, Draco crossed the floor and Harry let go of his knees, receiving Draco’s body on the bed as he smothered Harry backwards with every stitch of stuffy embroidery.  Heat and something like happiness bubbled over Harry’s every nerve, to be kissed, finally, when their faces were an inch from each other’s, and what was that?  Sexual arousal?  Sexual arousal was what made his dick twitch when someone he didn’t fancy decided to snog him in a club.
Harry’s shaking his head.  He was like this sometimes, in the first few years after the war.  He needed everyone he loved close around him, and if Ginny wanted his hand up her robes, he decided, what better way to keep her close?  “Stay where I can see you,” he orders Teddy now, and he knows that he’s being a shit.  “We’re having lunch.  Kreacher!” he shouts, because he needs Kreacher too.
He remembers the tension between them, outside the pub.  He told Teddy that he and Draco weren’t serious, but he remembers the counsellor working them through Ginny’s feelings, not too far off a year ago now, them both sat prickling around Ginny’s phone on the table.  He remembers the feeling in his chest, because he knew when she was talking – he just knew.
“I know, I know…  It’s Harry,” he apologises, as though Buckbeak is asking him what’s wrong.  “You see,” explains Sirius, turning to Harry, his tone hardening, “I needed support for this conversation.”
“I imagined that he had,” agrees Harry’s dad breezily, as though they’re having lunch.  He sighs.  “I’ve told him; it’s terribly unhealthy, working at the weekend – but what can be done?  Will you be going to see Teddy?” he asks Harry.
Sirius forces hair out of his face, fighting against the wind and still pacing.  “Sirius Black and Remus Lupin,” he declares in a haughty tone of voice, and this seems to be an easy one.
“Well, go on, then,” Harry suggested, even though it was a bit odd, really, the idea of someone fancying Hermione.  Almost as odd as someone fancying Ron.
The curtains are closed, so there’s no way for anyone outside to see as Malfoy stalks over the rug, throws an elbow over Harry’s shoulder, idly, presses their faces together and snogs him thoroughly.  It feels obscene anyway.  Harry’s not sure that he’ll ever get used to doing this in the morning.
Lupin is looking at him reprovingly, and Harry isn’t sure why.  He acts as though Harry hasn’t said anything.  “I read a book about Dutch painting, once,” he begins, nodding back to the canvas on the wall.  “Can’t recall most of it.  I believe that oranges are supposed to signify prosperity, because traditionally they were difficult to come by.  The equivalent of a really nice box of chocolates, which you can only afford when things are going well.”
“Maybe we won’t come home at all,” James retorts, clenching his jaw.  His eyes flash, accusing, and Harry knows that he shouldn’t make promises about Christmas.
the ballad of Harry’s beloved Ron and Hermione, and Draco wonders if this is the full or real reason for the scowl on Harry’s face.
On the way home, Harry stops for a pint at the Leaky.  He leafs through his book, sitting at one of the sad little tables in the alleyway.  The wind is cold and rushing, but he’s grown used to fresh air.
Something repressive in her expression makes Harry’s thoughts turn to Draco.  He’s here somewhere, Harry suddenly remembers.  He looks for him, glancing around through the crowded hall, the hundreds of people all talking, but he can’t see anyone he knows.  There are only unfamiliar eyes, swivelling to meet his.  Too many hats.
” he commands, tossing his head for Harry to follow and then turning on his heel as though Harry will.
“Oh?” was Luna’s vague reply.  She was switching away grass from her feet with a branch of birch, which was no good for a wand, but which she said was about halfway there.  A dozen whippy twigs diverged from its main stem, which Luna was holding, and they bore handsome glittering blossoms of young Maytime leaves.
“What?” Harry asks like a dullard, pushing his glasses up his nose.  He’s not offended, Draco thinks.  He doesn’t know the word means in this context.
Hermione’s mother is Senegalese and her unmarried name was Faye, like the footballer, which is a reference Hermione likes giving witches and wizards when they ask.  Harry’s certain that Teddy’s colleagues assume that Petra’s a witch, because her surname is Thompson, and Petra Thompson sounds like a witch’s name.  Also, she’s with Teddy, who must get mocked for going out with someone who has the same surname as his old head of house.  Harry recognises her, he thinks, from the group of Hufflepuffs – and apparently their muggle friends – who went on the BLM marches last summer, and Harry likes the idea that she and Teddy met there unexpectedly.  He also likes that they’re here.
Under the cloak, Harry wants to ask what else Arthur has said, because he didn’t know that he knew – but he can’t, not without giving himself away and ruining the whole evening.
In any case, Draco strides contentedly naked to the door, because this is his bedroom, isn’t it?  This is his flat, and he has no call to wear clothes if he so chooses.  The air is a little chill, because it is still April, and this is what happens in rooms with high ceilings.  He pulls his thick black dressing gown from the hook and throws it around his shoulders, immediately warmer.
“You only get better,” Harry pretends that he isn’t admitting, looking down at the space between their noses.  He wipes the grease off Draco’s chin.
rather than pure dumb luck in a magical world, or whatever else has been the reason.  Draco thinks that Granger understands that, and what it means.
Their pace is steady, but it’s June.  The sun is high in the sky and the air is fragrant with leaves.  By Draco’s side, Potter has the first touch of sweat glistening around his temples.  There forever in Draco’s peripheral vision, he’s either brushing hair away from his forehead or pushing his glasses up his nose, fidgeting and frowning and it’s distracting, really, like the exertion colouring his cheeks.  Birds are twittering, rustling through branches as the breeze dapples Harry Potter and Draco himself in shifting patches of shade and sun.
“We’re having lunch,” Harry insists, counting them up.  He misses his children, his ex-wife, Draco Malfoy.  Dead people, who are difficult to count.  “Kreacher, do we have things in for lunch?” he asks his elf.
says Mrs Figg, to see him on the step.  Margaret Thatcher, Harry thinks.  That’s who Mrs Figg’s glasses remind him of.
Draco isn’t sure where he is, what year it is, or why he can hear Harry Potter.  He’s kneeling on grass, over a set of casting stones.  His hawthorn wand is in his hand, tingling as though it’s reading something.  There are screams in his ears – muggle screams, he’s sure.  But he isn’t sixteen; he’s in his twenties.  He’s twenty-four.  It’s 2004, and the Dark Mark lurks in shadows on his arm.
“Sleep,” Harry tells the smell of him, finding collarbone.  “It’s not late.”  He plants his mouth on the ridge.  “You can wake up for lunch.  It’s all right.”
“No,” Lupin says simply, turning to face him.  His expression is shuttered.  “No, I could not begin to imagine…”
It takes a certain level of effort, on top of what has been a very testing day – or two days, since it now seems to be morning again – but Draco ignores them, working his way through his pastries, which taste far too sweet.  He floos into the Ministry like a good employee, and takes the lift down to the Department of Mysteries, uncertain who all these
Instead of responding as he should, Harry laughs a little wetly, turning into their hands to scissor their fingers together and kiss Draco soundly on the mouth among the stems of spring flora, getting mud all over their toes.  He tastes like the turn of morning into afternoon.  Draco’s eyes fall shut for a moment, because, yes, all right.
He finds the slightest nick of scar tissue before the collar stops stretching.  It’s is a surprise, though Harry knows that it shouldn’t be.  He knows not to ask.  Imagining Draco’s body again, for the first time at this age, Harry imagines that he might be muscle and vinegar too.
Draco tended to find her face difficult to look at, for many reasons.  “You’ve not been coming to the pub,” he told Harry.  It was true.  “That’s not my fault.”
“Steady on,” Potter jokes.  “I did cop it, once upon a time…”  A twitch in the man’s smile suggests that he understands the full of what they’re saying to each other.  They would both say the same things again without hesitation, if the situation called for it.  “You and I should have a chat, wouldn’t you say?” Potter continues now.  “There was some positively disgraceful muggle scotch, last I inspected the library.”
By the time that he’d come, he’d about stopped complaining, and Draco could feel it on his jeans, a job well done.  Harry Potter then rolled Draco underneath him, solid and heavy and considerate, fumbling with Draco’s belt.
“I’m not being irrational,” Harry scoffed, pressing a finger into the point of Draco’s nose to see if it would prick him.  “I’m being strategic.”
The warm arm pulled across Harry’s shoulders and he didn’t think to resist, drawing into the hug as his dad kissed him on the crown of his head, them both the same height.  If Harry failed to pull away afterwards, well, he failed to pull away afterwards, allowing himself to exist in this dream, a very healthy dream, undoubtedly, the feeling of his dad beside him warm and jostling as he laughed and told jokes and pointed at people – and Harry focused on the way the light hit the floor, shifting.
“I’ll get in these,” Malfoy’s promising.  He looks awkward, and Harry’s not sure he owns a phone.  “I’ll go to the bar and have someone come to the table.”
And it would be a very curious thing to know, if the living form of James Potter remembers anything from his previous states of resurrection, but it doesn’t seem as though today is going to give Draco the chance to find out.
would never lead a woman on.”  He snorted, to imagine it.  After all, if Harry had been leading Ginny on at Christmas then he’d been leading her on for years, hadn’t he?
At the touch of him, Harry startles harder, gulping, and Draco grins to stretch a thumb and swipe the bead that appears at the end of him.
“We were all certain that his was Lily, but now she was a fox, now she was a doe, now she was a hawk…”  Lupin rolls his eyes, just a touch, as though this is a very James Potter thing to have happened.  “The doe seemed rather egotistical and she was a fox by the exam, so that was what we went with.”
The first stage is to successfully vanish an item to the Nowhere Room.  For this, Black is working with one of the leather boots that Draco remembers from the vision of his afternoon with Lupin.  The man’s first attempts achieve nothing out of the ordinary, but this is as expected.  In fact, it’s quite reassuring: one of Draco’s fears has been that Black would have lost his
Harry looks down, and he finds himself vowing, out of time, “One day they’ll make me Head Auror.”  Then he’s holding Draco’s jaw, because his own happiness was never why he took his job, and it was a snap decision the first time too.  “Yeah?” he demands that Draco listens to his promise, sweeping a thumb.
Sirius’s expression is unyielding.  “He would have seen you killed, Harry,” he points out, sounding as though he’s been brooding on this for weeks.  “You don’t get to be killed.”
and you have a responsibility.  You have a son who needs a father,” he states, “who’s still recovering from Merlin alone knows what, right along with the man he’s…  He has no
Ginny found it frustrating that the bastard still worked for the Ministry and she wasn’t even allowed to know who he was.  They knew people whose kids were starting jobs with the Ministry, she always pointed out.
He conjures a bird into the real world – a canary, for tradition – and then he vanishes it, with concentration.  Another flick of his wand, and Draco disapparates to the Nowhere Room.
“That’ll be us, I reckon.”  The words came out of Harry in a choked whisper, tempering his movements even as his hands held tight enough to bruise and his nose was in Draco’s cheek.
They keep meeting up, when they’re free; it’s something to do, Harry finds.  He stops asking Malfoy if he’d like another drink, whenever their glasses are nearing dry.  The interruption seems unnecessary; often he’s lost in his head – and sometimes Harry remembers that he’s trying to woo him, so he’ll smile at him when there’s a pause.  It’s a bit awkward.  He gets in crisps and portions of chips, when he’s hungry or Malfoy seems so.
“I don’t know what you want from me,” Harry tells her directly, glancing around for his lost silver tray.  “I can’t hear myself think in here…”
“You won’t have heard of it,” Draco dismissed, stepping in close and raising his arms to rest them on Harry Potter’s shoulders.  “It’s Bayswater, really.”
he jokes, surely barely holding himself together.  He’s glaring at Dumbledore as though he wishes that a sword would fall out of the sky and pierce him through.
with their deaths,” Draco tells Harry Potter, crossing his legs, appealing.  “Cursed by wizards.  Shot with green light that tore them asunder and left them to accept death as the way of things.  The resurrection stone, I am certain, cannot make a person
“That’s why I love you, babby owl,” she says calmly.  “The way you feel things.  We were all half numb by the end of it, but you’d feel so much joy, so much sadness…  I only had to look at you, and I’d remember what they felt like.”
“He passed through,” Draco says.  For the first time in this whole adventure, the conversation feels easy, and he has no idea why.  He really does hope that this is the last of them, apart from Black.  “Our encounter here involved more of a duel, I’ll admit.”
When did they talk about this? Draco thinks.  He doesn’t even remember.  “Exactly.  Your parents, Black and Lupin – are they the same people as the wizards and witch who died in 1981, 96, 98?” Draco leaves the question hanging in the air.  “They no longer have the same bodies, but neither do I have mine from those years.  Their thoughts are their own business, as are their souls.  There is no reason to assume that their presence in this world causes any greater cosmic problem than our own, as wizards, given that we vanish in and out of existence on a day-to-day basis.”
“And the rest of us,” Narcissa confirms, as though it’s quite the joke.  Draco sometimes wonders about the way that his mother was raised.  “But we cannot let the
“She must live around here somewhere,” Moony tells him, looking to the mountains.  “I found it on my bench, when I woke up after the August moon.  I’d chained myself to it,” he admits, and Harry doesn’t comment on this.  He’s twirling the quill, so that the feather ruffles and gleams in the sun, entirely magical, magnificent.  “I was terrified that I’d eaten her, or wounded her –”
“Dumbledore didn’t know until you went to prison,” Harry tells him, in case this hasn’t been mentioned.
With a slap of her hand to her expensive coat, Pansy shrieks, a grin breaking open her face as a wicked laugh clangs down her nose.  It’s not a nice sound, but it’s oddly genuine, and Harry’s not sure what to make of it.  “Oh Potter, you’re too easy,” she declares, and Harry would believe that she felt no real emotions at all.
It makes Harry force himself to a conclusion.  “That’s what we should’ve learned at the end of the war,” he says solidly, surprised by the depth in his voice.  “There’s not one of us who’s not affected someway somehow by all these efforts to put people in boxes and shut ‘em away, whether they’re people we hate or people we love or just…”  Ourselves, he wants to say.  “There’s all these…”  He can’t quite remember Hermione’s word.  “Wizarding supremacism is only one part of it.”
“Just curious about it,” Harry replied with a brush of fingers before he let go.  He smiled, wrinkling his nose so that his glasses nudged upwards.  “I mean, you’re all full of secrets, aren’t you?”  There was something in his eyes.  “It’s interesting.”
And Pansy shrugs her shoulders at him, as though this should be obvious.  “Using anything and everything money can buy to raise my children better than those pieces of work who raised me.”  She flashes a smile.  “Sasha’s very supportive.”
“It’s true,” says Harry’s dad evenly, and this isn’t what he said to Sirius.  “It’s unnerving when he looks directly at you, but he’s nothing like the person you describe and he’s nothing like his father.”  He goes on, and it might be the beer; George is listening, bemused.  “He reminds me of Sirius’s brother, the more I get to know him,” he admits.  “Though don’t tell either of them that I said that.  And Regulus would never have been caught sounding like a
It’s pointless, saying these things, Harry tells himself.  Dumbledore’s white tomb will sit on Hogwarts’ grounds until the castle collapses; his portrait will hang in this office with the others for centuries – but neither of these things can give him answers, and this memory never will either.
“The Office doesn’t get a say in that,” Harry finds himself swearing, glaring deeply into grey eyes.  It’s nothing different from what he ever promised Ginny, who’s always been loud and loopy on elf wine.  “If they want a party, they get who I’m with.”
At Ollivander’s side, against the wall, not sitting on a chair, hidden in the depths of the corner, there’s Draco, looking small and like he wishes he was smaller, dressed in black, holding wine, pointy and sharp and silent, most likely.
Harry finds him when Draco goes home one day to his flat.  It’s past nine in the morning and not yet four: he should have been fine.  He’s annoyed that his calculations aren’t correct, not here and not at work either, and he’s
“I stole a massive jar of it from school once, when I was nine, and I basically lived off it for a week.  Don’t talk to me about beetroot.”
is what he told the trainees, his voice somehow filling the room.  He fears he really meant that they are.  He must sound like a squishy yellow pikachu around his children, given that this is how they see him.
“Draco, I’m taking her home in my suitcase,” Pansy then interrupts, talking over the top of Luna’s head.  “My friends will love her.”
And he didn’t say it was Draco, but he confirmed that he’s been seeing someone, because he couldn’t let it go
“You wanna play the toyboy,” Teddy promises, nodding.  “He’ll buy you presents and call you Harrietto.”
James is doing an impression with this word, his tone turning arch and effete, his head lolling with a sigh – but then he cringes as though he regrets bringing up Regulus, and Harry decides not to dwell on it.
“He does that,” comes the easy observation.  Then she’s frowning at Draco again.  “Malfoy,” she repeats, and he hopes that she isn’t going to hex him.  “All right.  Whatever happened to Lucius?”
When they arrive downstairs, Teddy’s chopping onions under Kreacher’s supervision.  At the sight of them, Kreacher disapparates –
“Everyone’s taste is different, sir.”  The jeweller is clearly offended, and yet also amused.  It feels like power.
Topsy’s one of the Malfoy elves, Harry knows.  She comes to Grimmo sometimes to review the accounts with Draco and Kreacher and Hermione.  It should be Harry, really, instead of Hermione, but Harry doesn’t trust himself with numbers.
“He has left shortly after Master Harry, Master Harry,” Kreacher tells him, congenial.  It seems inevitable that one day Kreacher will lie to him again, and he could be lying now.
Really, Harry’s always found this straightforward.  He used to get annoyed with other aurors he was working with – the senior wizards – who had no grip on what made a man handsome or compelling to the people around him.  For two decades Harry thought that this was simply a skill that he had, to be aware.
Sirius is short, resistant.  “He’s less fragile than you think.”  He’s working himself up, pacing across the path and back.  “He’s done it before.  He did it for ten years; he did it on Saturday, the shirking cunt.”
Throwing the digestives he’s found into the canary’s cage, crushed and crumbling from his fist, Draco disapparates to the Ministry’s atrium.  There are a couple of other late workers, and the lights are still on, but on the whole the place is empty.  One of the lifts is moving, according to the lights, and Draco takes the risk to wait for it, because the journey up from Level Nine is long – longer, he thinks, than the time that he spent in the kitchen.
“Master Harry is home now,” is all Kreacher says, his small body warm.  He pats a frail hand on his.
“I haven’t done a blind thing,” Draco tells him.  Like son, like father, it seems.  “She’s most likely back
Whatever Harry’s dad is expecting from Harry’s visit to Teddy, Harry thinks, he’s going to be disappointed.  It’s clear, once he arrives, that this won’t be a long day in Essex.
She’s on her own, but that’s no surprise.  Ron will be caught up with something and Draco will have lost track of things, Harry imagines.  He went in late because Harry kept him up until dawn; he’ll be home if and when he remembers.  Harry’s not sure that he wants him to.
“What the fuck are you doing here?” he hisses, full of Gryffindor adrenaline.  It’s not a feeling that he enjoys.  He’s holding a bag containing thousands of muggle pounds’ worth of jewellery and it’s supposed to be a secret.
“I mean,” Harry says, swallowing the last of his sandwich.  His expression is hot again, jealous, perhaps.  “You tell me, why didn’t I know this?  And what gives him the right to commandeer Sirius’s room?  He was
“And he’s managed it all on his own,” McGonagall humours him, before waving him out of her office.  “At least among those who matter,” she adds like a snob, and Harry assumes that this is a joke, or else that he must have misheard.
Emerging from the floo, the first thing Harry does is call for and cry all over Kreacher, pulling the ancient elf to his hip for a hug.  Because the house is loud and huge, but so clean and tidy compared to how he left it, and Harry loves his loyal house elf of a loyal twenty years.
He’s standing by a set of shelves, holding a photograph which must have been tucked between two runs of books.  Draco has seen it before.  It bears his image, among others, and it annoys him because he doesn’t think that Granger should own an image of his face.  The thing was taken at a party for Ginny Weasley, with Granger, her boyfriend, Harry and him at a table in the beer garden of a countryside pub.  The freckles on Granger’s boyfriend’s face suggest high summer, as do the long streaks of orange and pink in the sky.  The photographer is clear from everyone’s behaviour – Granger’s easy grin, her boyfriend’s rolling eyes, their best friend’s flirtatious perch of his chin on the back of his fist.  Draco is drinking his pint.
Abruptly, awkwardly, then, with a noise of frustration, he pulls back one of the spindly chairs and sits down.  He doesn’t even sprawl, though his arm is on the table, his fingers tapping as though he wants a cup of tea to fiddle with.
“I can do the talking, if you like,” Draco offers despite himself.  The mood is rubbing off on him, making him feel underdressed in his slim trousers and shirt from a man named Reiss.  His coat is black wool, and he’s beginning to think that it’s too warm for this time of the year.  It’s a fine day: if they were heading to the pub, Harry might have insisted that they sit outside, as he does, and told him,
This isn’t true, in Harry’s experience.  He can think of a dozen occasions when his first time came out all right, not least because it had to.
thinks that three months is enough.  “And you’re helping.”  This seems to be almost as startling.  “Interesting.”  He nods towards the kitchen with a whiskery grin.  “Should I put the kettle on?” he suggests.  “You’ll want to stash that somewhere safe.”
He’s holding Hermione’s hand, Harry notices, the gesture half hidden between them.  Hermione looks rather drawn and serious, to Harry’s eyes, as though she doesn’t want to speak until the whole thing’s over, no matter that she has no official speaking to do at all.  Her brown eyes meet Harry’s, and they’re very loud.
, when Lily Potter’s Order of the Phoenix was clearly about friendships on the front line.  “First to fifth year.”
“I don’t…  I don’t know what I’m doing,” he cursed, apologetic, kissing to the count of three, intense and acid.  “You’re – you’re Draco Malfoy.  Oh hell…”
“I didn’t know you were coming!” she protested, earnest and easily flustered, absolutely half cut.  “I…”  She swallowed whatever it was that she’d been going to say, looking at him warily.
“I’m always outnumbered,” Harry’s dad replies, his expression amused behind his glasses.  He’s clearly missing Harry’s mum, but he makes a joke anyway.  “It makes me feel special.”
“He looks just like my grandfather.”  James Potter’s expression now, today, is lost, his back still rod-straight, his brimstone wand still in Draco’s hand.  “But those eyes…”  He’s divided again.  “
So far, so predictable, but the important turn of the myth is how it ends.  Prince Momtin was duly glad to be alive again, enjoying a season of feasting with his family and friends.  But Veyra was not so happy.  After so much time in the black ocean depths, she found the sunlight harsh on her eyes and she spent her days longing for the shadows of Tanemoha’s kingdom.  She found her duties to the court unappealing, and she spent her nights remembering Tanemoha’s capricious games of skill.
The next thing that Harry remembers, he was talking to Matías in a corner of the ball room.  They were by the glass doors which led to the corridor with the loos.  He was embarrassing himself.
Sara Chaudhury of Salisbury said yes to everything, because she wasn’t a ghost, by the strongest definition.  She wasn’t here to haunt them; she was just here.  That afternoon, she pushed her child’s buggy into the sacred circle, concealed by the traffic island’s flowerbed, and only smiled as Harry Potter threw down the ashes and bid her farewell.
Harry shakes his head, on an edge.  It feels like he’s giving in.  “Draco, if you’re not fucking me in the next thirty seconds –”
With this golden cobra, it feels like, deadly poisonous and untouchable, a broad hood and a slinking tail.  He wants to ask the thing its business, where it’s come from and what it intends to achieve.
Granger herself emerges next, laden down with bags and a harried expression on her face.  “Kreacher insists,” she says to Andromeda, as though they’re mid-conversation.  “If you and
They start arguing, inevitably.  Harry would like to say that he’s a stranger to such intimacy between his best friends, but he’s known them very nearly thirty years.  Fuck if he doesn’t crave this feeling of closeness.  Besides, it’s not exclusive to him – the Granger-Weasleys argue in public.  They’ve always been the ones suspected of trouble.  Harry has to explain that this is just what they’re like.
” she asks, completely ignoring this cue and making Harry startle, blinking her huge dark eyes and their eyelashes – and Harry knows it’s all make-up, but it’s mesmerising.  “He came out of the womb needlessly dramatic.”  And Harry agrees that this is
“Let me read it, James, and I’ll tell you,” said Harry’s mum, a warning in her tone as she sat up straight, brushed off his arm and held the paper directly in front of her.
“Yeah,” Harry rasps just like he does, his hands both warm now and holding Draco tight, one of them pushing him loose with ever more ferocity and a fidgety thumb.  “Yeah, love, I told you, it’s nice, look around.”
Throwing on fresh robes – because yesterday’s have already been taken by the elves – Harry treads into black trainers and makes his way out and down the grand marble stairs to the entrance hall, past the massive suits of armour.  “At ease,” he murmurs as he passes them, because they answer to all of the teachers and the old Gryffindors most.
They don’t tell Harry.  They fob him off for the rest of November, and he’s stupid enough to think that they’re cooling down.  The day after term ends, when they’re due to come home, he finds himself stood up on the King’s Cross platform, waiting with Ron.  Hermione’s at work, like Harry should be; he left on time to be here for this.
He kicks off before the branch is even horizontal, letting it take him into the air and pushing down with his hands to make the leap.  The broomhandle pushes back, secure.  It offers a warm and growing murmur, approving – not like Luna, its creator, but like something more familiar.  Harry’s weight is distributed differently from when he was a teenager, but he’s not calling on muscle memory, he doesn’t think.  It’s something else.
“Aren’t you fun?” Teddy reflects coolly in his cream-coloured puffer jacket, his hair rippling bright blue from honey blond, which had a good run.  He looks away and then he’s looking back, clenching his jaw while he sniffs.  “It’s like you’re getting divorced.”
one of Ron’s, then no one would kick up a fuss.”  He looked, for a moment, like a force primaeval.  “If Fred was here, and he was living with George and Angelina, and he had a job up at Hogwarts, Grimmo would be about the price of London housing, the bloody great size of the place.  The situation would be, you know,
“And you’ve never said, what you’re really working on.  But I…”  Granger’s drinking her own tea now, her eyebrows knit in a frown as she swallows.  “You don’t have to do this, Draco,” she insists.  “I’m worried about you.  You’ve taken out everything there is on apparition and I’m not sure that you’re thinking straight.  You
There are charms all over Grimmo to prevent noise cutting through doors or walls or floors.  The third-floor flat’s internal partitions are an exception, Harry and Draco were gradually coming to realise.  They’d been forgotten about, Harry was starting to expect, because no one had imagined that the flat’s front door would ever be taken away.
It’s unduly irritating, watching him, that Harry’s salmon tastes oily and meaty and perfect, the potatoes crisp with sour cream.
Now he’s sat up, Harry’s jacket is lying over Draco’s knees.  Harry tucks his hand underneath it to squeeze his leg and make him twitch.  “We’re surviving,” he whispers, and pops him a kiss on the jaw.
“I saw Pansy,” Draco tells him defiantly, curling hair behind Harry’s ear.  His confidence seems to be returning, and he’s making Harry shiver.  “She said that the only thing you’d left was yourself.”
It was pity, ultimately, though it still felt a lot like spite, that made Draco cast hot air from his wand, testing his control to see how much water he could blast away without burning Harry’s skin.
“Oh James,” Lily laments, dropping her chin and still clutching her pink dressing gown.  She’s frowning at her husband, then glancing at her son.  Her tone is startlingly fond, just for a moment as she shakes her head.  “If you could’ve
Draco turned to Granger, because he too had learned new information since his adventure down in Wilts, though this had come from Vespers.  “How are the Grangers?” he asked.  “I hear that you finally succeeded in reversing the charm.”
Absolute bollocks!” he declares, laughing.  Harry feels indignant on his mother’s behalf, but also something else; he’s not sure what.  “Spoilt rotten like a princess, that’s you.  Give that over –”
to Sirius.”  Draco says it so easily, so close, and Harry doesn’t know how he’s ever come to this conclusion.  “You think that you’re responsible for him, or maybe he’s responsible for you.”  He says it all calmly, clear-eyed.  “You’re worried that he’s going to run off with Lupin and leave you; you’re worried that Lupin’s going to break his heart and you’ll have to pick up the pieces.”
Lupin’s watching him, Draco then realises, his jaw ticking.  As if he’s about to fucking say anything.
,” Lupin declares, as if into a void, as if calling on the first thing that he can think of.  “A great arse-faced twat of a stag.  And
Mrs Potter doesn’t hesitate to accept Draco’s elbow, still talking.  “Of course he does,” she says, the words lilting.  “I bet he’s a wonder.”
“Get that out of there,” Harry instructs, unstoppering his own vial, determined.  He doesn’t want to see Lupin with Sirius, because they were both supposed to be like Harry, surviving alone, not desperately needing each other.  But he’ll persevere.  All knowledge is power.  “Let’s get this done,” he insists, shutting off his instincts as he pours.
At Black’s side, the hippogriff stirs, bristling at Lupin’s tone with the pride that Draco remembers.
Draco fumbled around for the man’s cock, feeling more in control than he had the whole evening.  Potter was half hard – almost certainly against his will.  “Then don’t tell anyone I said it,” he suggested, taking the man’s hair for himself in his other hand.
,” Moony scoffs, looking away.  He tilts his head to his shoulder.  “Though maybe a little, when I was fifteen…  He used to play quidditch remarkably well –”  He cuts himself off, and Harry’s not sure if he’s joking.  “I mean monsieur Black,” says Moony then, with a self-mocking frown, lamenting.  His gaze trails off towards the cliff path, and he sighs.  “The edgy one, with the arms and the leather and the dark sense of humour.”
It’s a simple enough route home, and the journey should have been simple too.  By the time that Draco’s recovered his wits, he’s certain that he’ll do no useful work that afternoon, so he commits to popping into his office only to check on the canary before he heads back to his flat.  It’s after lunch but before Granger’s tea break, so she won’t be looking for him.  He can most likely find something in the staff room to complement the digestive biscuits.
,” Harry tells it, his breath heavy and his muscles pounding now he’s not running.  “I’m not trying to
There was a photo taking up a third of the page, which seemed to delight Harry’s mum.  It had been shot through the coffee-shop window, at the moment when Sirius had reached out to touch Harry’s wrist.  The picture showed Harry’s head flashing up and him blinking, his mouth closed and eyes round in round glasses.  He looked ridiculous; he looked
“If you break your promise, I’ll step in,” Harry goes on, not trying to threaten him, or guilt-trip him, or any of the other things he used to find himself doing, unthinking.  “Whether it’s now or in the future.  Maybe I won’t let you talk to Teddy on his own,” he suggests.  “Maybe I won’t let you see him until he’s seventeen.  I dunno what’ll be fair, because it’ll depend on what you do,” Harry acknowledges.  “But you don’t get to know the rules at that point,” Harry emphasises, because he saw what Moony was like in the pensieve.  “And I will enforce them.”
“I will bite you,” Harry insists, pulling off his glasses.  He throws them to the bedside table on what has long been his side of the room.  It’s a good distance, but he lands them true.
This makes Harry snort, because wizards took up that technology fifteen years ago.  Ron’s the only one who jokes about it, after what happened.  Harry casts a few spells and finds a note, no threat of curse-magic explosives.
Teddy turns pinker than the streak in his hair.  “Hello Cousin Draco,” he says, long-suffering, nonetheless failing to contain an oddly pleased, embarrassed grin as they greet each other with a hug.  Malfoy pats Teddy on the back as though he remembers, like Harry, when Teddy wasn’t this tall.
“If you’ve got nothing to say,” Harry tells the man in the doorway, ignoring her, “you can go away and leave us alone.”
There’s a bathroom and a bedroom off this living space.  The bathroom is heavy pipes and a claw-foot enamel bath, which Harry’s set up to stream bubbles that smell like seaweed and sunshine.  The bedroom houses a bed which is much like the one he spent six of seven years in, maroon with four posts and curtains, just as Godric would have wanted.
Granger’s boyfriend frowned at him, toying with the last inch of his pint.  “Thought you were mates now,” he said, as though this were qualification enough for Draco to share an
Harry can imagine it, and it’s a dickish thing to have said.  “Are you taking her to brunch?” he asks to change the subject.  He doesn’t want to talk about Snape anymore.  Not Snape or Dumbledore or anyone.  He wonders what else Pansy told Draco, if he knows that Harry admitted to her…
“Well,” James doesn’t accept, “I suppose that that’s a reason to salt the earth on a highly convenient word.”
Black isn’t listening to Draco, and seems to think that his godson is hilarious.  His laughter is deep and rough as he ruffles Harry’s hair, or splats it with his hand in any case.  “I proclaim you one-hundred-and-five!”  He’s completely off his head.  Harry slouches down beneath the force of his palm.  “Supreme Mugwump!”
Arousal forgotten, Harry clinks his golden knife and fork against the edge of his hovering plate.  It will hold for a few minutes more.  “You don’t
They were kissing then, Draco the child deviant and the boy from the cupboard.  Draco had his hands in the boy’s hair, and it felt right that their bodies were tangled between them.  The mouth against his own tasted of dinner and wine and something familiar, bitter and saline.
Gary ducks his head, before he looks up again.  He seems to accept this forgiveness.  “Is there really no hope for Frank and Al?”
“We’ll have to discover next year whether these crises are annual,” is all Draco says while reading the paper, not wearing any clothes, and there’s been one night in the past two weeks when they’ve fallen asleep without having sex.
Summer is always back and forth to different mates, and now the kids will be going back and forth between number 12 and Ginny’s.  Whatever else might be said about Hogwarts, it makes children independent, it brutally cuts that cord, and it’s clear that even Lily will declare by the summer what it is she wants to do.  James will decide on collective decisions, and Harry’s been told that these days he’s fair.
James tuts, and they’re flirting again.  Harry can imagine them looking at each other, his mum sitting at the Blacks’ bone-inlaid desk with a glint in her green eyes.
“Harry, it’s been fifteen years,” now Sirius is saying, a figure in black, directly opposite him.  “You’re allowed a new broomstick.  We’ll go out and let your mum and dad see what you can do,” he suggests, posher than Harry remembers.
Sirius seems to ignore this.  “What’d you ever do with that type-machine I fixed?” he comes out with, and Harry guesses that he means a typewriter.
And I lose it at the casual phrasing, the shard of hope blossoming inside me at the idea that Harry might stay nearby for more than just a day or two. That maybe I’m part of Harry’s reason for extending his stay.
True to his word, Draco arranges everything for Harry’s birthday. Anticipation sizzles over Harry’s skin as they stand on the shore of the Black Lake. Stark naked.
“Salazar, the house is bloody watching me have diarrhea. And all because Harry couldn’t watch where he was going in the apothecary. He wasn’t even bloody supposed to be there in the first place. I
“You know Potter, you say ‘fuck’ an awful lot. To put it similarly, he’s fucking Blaise. His boyfriend.” Draco smirked as he knew he had the upper hand for the first time since the interrogation started.
“I’d rather just get takeaway on our way home from work.” He flashes me a look that’s hopeful, but afraid to be turned down (yet again). My chest tightens at the obvious pain in those bright green eyes, and it’s even worse knowing I put it there, no matter how busy things have been lately.
It was difficult for him to get the words out. He and Theo’s friendship had always focused more on their work and interests instead of their emotions. As he confided his love for Harry, Theo’s eyebrows lifted, and his lips twitched.
Picking up the book that thrums with the magic that made it choose me, I take the stairs two at a time to check out the bar. Hermione will appreciate the picture, and if I’m ever going to drink, today is the day.
When I wake up to exercise and head to work, Draco’s not in bed next to me.  I run my hands over his side of the bed, but it’s cold.  I hope he’s not in the loo throwing up like in his first trimester.
“He might have been a bloody prick, but at least he had good taste when it comes to self-care,” Harry thought wryly while watching the bath bomb fizz. His back relaxed with the release of the lavender scent.
He had heard rumours of Harry’s trysts over the years, but he wasn’t sure how much was fact or fiction. How many relationships did a person usually have by 25?
He pins me to the bed, kissing down my neck, tonguing at my nipples, then slowly making his way to my belly.
Cars honk behind us as I fish Muggle money out of my pockets, slowly counting out the unfamiliar coins and bills. The taxi driver drums his fingers loudly against the steering wheel. A few drivers even shout expletives while passing by, and the driver stops waiting for me to fumble with payment, instead snatching the money directly from my hands.
“What have you told R-E-G-U-L-U-S about Draco L-E-A-V-I-N-G?” Narcissa asks, shooting a glance at the little boy sitting on the sofa to watch the telly.
“I tried dinner! He didn’t get it. So, if I want to win him away from Flint, I need something romantic that leaves no doubt of my feelings.”
Put that way, Harry understood his friend’s logic. There was a reason she was the smartest person he knew, and it wasn’t just “books and cleverness.” This was also her way of seeing how Blaise and Malfoy would interact beyond their small group, and he nearly smirked at the cunning of it.
Draco hadn’t realised how tense his shoulders were until they relaxed at the realisation that Harry wasn’t a complete prat. He looked down as Harry put a small envelope directly on top of the half-opened box.
Draco considered it. He knew a painter who could teach them, and he could choose a love theme. Add in some romantic music and wine, and it would be a thoughtful, unable-to-misconstrue-as-anything-else date.
“I have a confession.” Hermione reached up to pull the pen out of her hair, only to put her hair back in a bun seconds later. The familiarity of his friends’ habits and ticks always comforted Harry. Hermione always put her hair up while she worked. “I invited Luna and Ron, and they will be here in five minutes.”
“I don’t…” he starts, before struggling to continue. Draco’s warm hand rubs circles on his back. “I don’t think it would have… taken
Draco brings his hand to his hair, running his fingers through the strands, then abruptly letting go when his fingers hit the bun. A silver ring in the form of a snake wraps around his index finger.
As soon as they entered, the witches downed shots at the bar before taking to the dance floor. They were in their own little world, possessively wrapped around each other and ignoring any attempts to encroach on their fun.
The flight was difficult. Draco didn’t feel comfortable moving around the plane after turbulence hit, and he gripped the seat until his knuckles were white during every rough patch. No one else seemed to mind the shaking of the aircraft, but he wondered how Muggles could stand it.
Draco watched hungrily. Harry came undone with Draco’s name on his lips, head thrown back, hips stilling, fingers digging into porcelain flesh. Spurts of warmth hit their stomachs.
“He… he lets me be me. He helps me be confident and go for what I want.” He reddened further, took a sip of his drink, and added, “both inside and out of the bedroom.”
“I want the artefacts preserved, but it takes time to add extra protection spells. I’m planning on giving this back too,” Draco said and gestured vaguely towards the diadem, a priceless object left carelessly on the floor in the confusion.
All I can do is coach Draco through square breathing, counting off the rounds of four steadily. I’ve learned a thing or two over the years of visits with Mind Healers unpacking trauma, painful memory by painful memory, but I’ve never helped someone else with those same techniques.
“Of course,” Draco said, turning to glance over Harry’s shoulder, sure his smile was strained. It was too painful to look at him directly. “Best friends. Now, pardon me, I need to use the loo.”
I feel a gentle tug on my sleeve, and those beautiful grey eyes are staring back at me innocently.  Our son’s the perfect mixture of the two of us.
knocked into that shelf and destroyed all those potions. And I will literally divorce you if you don’t bloody get out of here so I can preserve what’s left of my dignity.”
“Well, that’s good. I’d hate for someone to mistake me for being straight…. You doing alright there, Malfoy? I’d offer something to drink, but you’re the bartender here.”
He had restored the physical structure of his family home, but it lacked the warmth of a loving family. He still pitied the Weasleys for their lack of money, though. Not that he would say that aloud.
Malfoy came back from the loo and settled into the other armchair, his entire frame tense. They needed to have a long conversation alone after this meeting and clear the air. Harry still didn’t agree with Draco’s original decision to face VILE alone, but he understood it.
After trying two meals, Draco couldn’t wait to see if the dessert would top the entrees. A mix of red and green would be brown — chocolate, maybe?
Harry’s last letter makes a lot more sense when my mother tells me she’ll be visiting with my aunt and my cousin, Teddy. And Harry fucking Potter. Can’t forget that somehow
“Oh! So sorry to run, but look at the time! Right, Gin?” Pansy grinned as she tugged on her wife’s sleeve. Draco knew the smile meant they were leaving to give him “privacy,” but really would spy on the table from outside the restaurant.
He didn’t stay long because he was too excited to get to planning, starting with an owl to Marcus Flint.
Harry shrugged. “I just thought they’d look nice together. D’you reckon it would be rude to use my fingers?”
“Someone’s eager, huh?” Draco laughed, running his tongue around Harry’s flat brown nipple, causing him to arch up into the touch. Draco ground his cock against the erection in Harry’s trousers.
“I can’t be everywhere at once. I thought you knew that and understood that. I’m busy. We’re busy. I’m bloody trying.”
Blaise shot him a quizzical look while Harry rose to his feet and took the American’s hand. Draco wished he’d dared to ask Harry first. There was no way Harry would go home with some random American Muggle, right?
One night in the middle of the semester, Draco found out James was gay. He’d been passing by a group of students in the dormitory lounge who were playing a game of Never Have I Ever. Maybe he’d lingered around the shared kitchenette a bit longer than necessary to see whether James drank to the prompt of “I have never had a crush on a member of the same sex.” And James had taken a drink, blushing hotly as he caught Draco’s eye. Draco had held his gaze, brought his glass of water to his lips, and taken a drink. He hoped the message was clear, even though he didn’t really know why he did it.
He remembered their last encounter at Florean Fortescue’s Ice-Cream Parlour. He had fixated on how Malfoy had licked his cone, while Harry internally berated himself, unable to taste the pumpkin flavour he had ordered. Adding to his embarrassment, Hermione had noticed and tried to subtly and non-verbally ask if there was anything between them. Tactless, Ron didn’t get the hint to be subtle. Instead, he loudly asked who they were gesturing to, and that caught Malfoy’s attention.
Why did I stop looking for my shirt? Why am I just wading neck-deep into the awkwardness of this moment?
My eyes trace over the lines and planes of the face only inches from my own. The Boy Who Lived Twice looks vulnerable, mouth ajar and drool forming a small wet spot on his pillow. Light wrinkles mar tanned skin and there’s a smattering of grey hairs already sprouting at his temples.
It was clear Ron wanted to argue, but the words were slowly percolating through his brain. What if, once again, they couldn’t rely on the Ministry to react?
We didn’t talk as much yesterday as I would have liked. Still, if anyone else can understand how much I have struggled to get away from my past and the expectations that were built around me, it would be the wizard who had gone from spoiled Pureblood brat to someone who turned his back on magic.
He decided he had enough time to relieve himself before he had to leave, so he did. As he basked in the afterglow, he wondered if Harry liked to cuddle.
I picture Reg’s cherubic face: the messy hair he inherited from his other father, the round and rosy cheeks, the big, crooked smile.  I can’t condemn my children to a life with me as their father and watch their spirits dim as they face the real world.
came to life with a burst of green, the church bells of the nearby Muggle church faintly rang seven times. He was grateful for her punctuality, which allowed him to pretend that he was engrossed in the book in his lap.
“Well?” He crosses his arms over his chest. And wow, what a broad chest that is — that past decade was
“It’s not…” he started before realising that finishing that cliched phrase was a definite mistake. He tried again, “After the war…”
Walking had never been such a sensual activity. After a few mishaps, Harry learned how to feel the press of Draco in their embrace, showing that he would take a step forward so Harry could step back.
Ginny came over with drinks for her and Pansy, but Pansy just passed hers immediately to Draco. He muttered his thanks but knew that alcohol wouldn’t fix anything. Still, he hoped it would help the time pass a little faster until they could go back to the hotel.
Running was his time to let go of stress, meditate on life, and, of course, maintain his trim physique.
The man was tempting — water droplets running down his skin, a sleepy smile on his face, and the cock Draco had tried not to think about after seeing the bikini, hidden behind a thin layer of fabric. Draco willed himself to keep looking at the ceiling and not to ogle. He wasn’t sure if he could stop himself from reaching out otherwise, and this was the wrong place to get rejected because there was nowhere to escape to.
Harry stopped pacing the small hotel room to grab a glass and looked through the minibar for Firewhiskey. He needed a drink to sort out his thoughts as he obsessively mentally reviewed and catalogued Malfoy’s facial expressions and words. He took a swig, and it burned.
If I were to report his disappearance to the Aurors, there’s a chance the press could catch wind of it and write a scathing story about a Death Eater abandoning his child.  They did so once already when Draco went on a promotional trip abroad for his book.
He desperately wanted to read Harry’s thoughts. Was the hand-holding just for convenience or a signal of interest?
I grab the first pair of pyjamas I find in his room while he’s brushing his teeth, and he spits the toothpaste directly onto the mirror as he starts laughing.
Hermione stood in front of the mantel with a friendly smile. As she often did in school, she had a smudge of black ink on her cheek, as though she had just been hard at work on an essay.
Our son is ashamed of me.  I don’t even know how he heard about my past, but it’s a reminder that people will never forget.  Our children will forever be marked by my name.
“Didn’t you used to have more time to plan these heists?” Harry frowned. His instinct was telling him that the short notice could be a trap.
“So, what exactly are reddish-purple foods? Beets? You definitely got the more traditional option,” Harry laughed.
I can’t bring myself to pick up any of the books on his bedside table.  My throat is too raw.  I do, however, look under the bed for monsters because I remember that’s a non-negotiable part of the nighttime ritual.
When I think of bookstores, I usually think of Lockhart signing his novels at Flourish and Blotts. Or I think of shelves and shelves of thick tomes about obscure topics like Kneazle mating. I don’t picture anything like this.
Their legs tangle together, no longer needing to tread water to keep afloat. They can focus on the sensations: on the movement of cock against cock, tentacle against nipple, mouth against mouth.
“Walk with me?” Harry asked. Malfoy nodded, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in his clothes and stopping for a quick inspection in the entryway’s mirror. Harry’s heart quickened as he wondered if the blond did that every time he went outside or if the other man cared what he thought.
By the anguish in his eyes, something else happened to him all those years ago besides the Ministry trials.
“If it’s close to here, it can’t be shit. You’re also wearing a lovely suit. Honestly, I never expected based on how you dressed at Hogwarts that you actually have good taste in fabrics and understand tailoring. But, anyway, that suit screams you can afford to treat yourself, and, more importantly,
I hadn’t realized that a little, battered corner of my heart was harboring hope until I saw the golden ring with a snitch engraved on it. And then he confirmed it. My consciousness drowned in the possibilities, even as my rational side tried to restrain my emotions.
The Americans come out with a bang of fireworks, flying intricate loops as confetti shoots from their brooms. With each trick, a swirling tornado of red, white, and blue swirls in the center of the pitch. It grows taller and spins faster until no one can see where the illusion starts in the sky. Finally, it explodes into falling stars as the anthem climaxes.
“It sounds crazy, right?” Draco’s heart seized a little at the apparent disbelief. Blaise and Longbottom thought this would be easy because they weren’t the ones who had to convince Harry. He sighed, “The hairpiece stolen in London was them. We had seen it written, but did not put two and two together until we saw the news.”
“For what? Shits and giggles? To best other thieves? I guess it makes sense that Red Hat is just fucking with everyone. That explains becoming visible just enough to be seen but not recognised and wearing a fucking bright red hat,” ranted Lewis. In his head, Harry preferred to refer to him as “the loud American who swears a lot.”
Because this was something else.  This was a dream that he’d had.  This was all possible, now that he was alone in the world.  Now that his parents – his
It’s Saturday again the next morning.  Teddy’s bounced back, now that September’s coming to an end.  He’s been surly and Harry’s been playing Xbox with him mutely, which has suited Harry fine.  This week, he’s biking again, and Harry knows better than to say anything which might rock the boat, even as his heart sinks.  He forgets, sometimes, that Teddy has to grow up.
Malfoy looks at him solidly, cold in his coat, as though Harry’s not realised what he’s getting himself into.  “Why not?” he asks ominously, making a joke only he understands.
Vivid eyes are staring at Harry, surprised, and there’s the crackle of burning robes, a hundred flames.  The heat is unbearable and Harry’s face feels burnt.
”  The man reforms his jaw, focusing on the task of finding an Ah.  “Harry.”  Hari, he ends up with, as if trying to say hara-kiri.  “Ha – how
“We’re going out,” Harry tells Hermione later, fresh from the shower, because he’s decided.  He’s borrowed some of Ron’s cologne, barely used, a gift from Rose and Hugo for his fortieth.
The only answer he gets is pair of rolled eyes.  “I’m annoyed that those fuckers ripped you off,” comes a strange sort of admission, Malfoy’s expression like there’s been a bad smell.  “You shouldn’t be embarrassed,” he says, despite contradicting this every time they talk.
“– but I don’t see why he gets to rummage around…  He could have had any of the spares.  It’s not his
“I’m going to find Remus Lupin,” Harry says, because that’s the plan.  He’s Harry’s child, by law.  A dependant.  A foundling from the snow.  He’s very fit; he’s Harry’s uncle.  He’s something or other; he’s family.  “I think he’s gone to stay with a bloke called GD.  Gary.  If I can read the rest of his letters, I might find out where he lives.”  He might find a load of pornographic fantasies.  “Or at least where he was living ten years ago.”
Harry snorts as the room turns dark.  “No pie for you, then, I take it.”  He leaves the bed, the mattress shifting.  “I s’pose this is sweet dreams.”
“Do you want me to go?” Draco interrupted, finding this conversation distinctly uncomfortable.  They were entirely wrong, after all.  He knew what the end of things looked like, and it looked like Harry Potter’s arm around Ginny Weasley’s waist.
This year, somewhere halfway through the Summer Exhibition, Harry finds himself looking at a still life.  It’s nothing special, he doesn’t think; the ones in the National are nicer, more complex.  It’s a round-bottomed, Mediterranean-blue vase containing a spray of leaves and flowers, sitting next to an orange on a sludgy brown table, against a black background.  His eyes are drawn to the flowers most of all, each a puff of long, floppy petals, white against fronds of leaf green, veined and pure.  The piece is only the size of a textbook, an unframed canvas.
It never feels like Draco’s stealing Harry's wand, when he takes it.  He stretches to drop it with a clatter on the bedside table, and by the time that Harry’s out of his shorts, he’s found his own hawthorn wand and zapped at their clothes on the carpet.
“My babby Harry James?”  Lily Potter lurches forward, grabbing Draco’s wrist in tight fingers.  She looks into his eyes, holding his wand hand up between them, her own eyes gleaming in the chamber’s gloom.  It doesn’t feel like legilimency, her looking at him.  It feels like something much more effective.  “He survived it,” she says, as if this is a deeply pleasant, unbelievable surprise.  “You’re joking – no, I want to see him.  Nobody else.  Not a soul, not before.”
“Fuck you, Harry,” Neville said, ruffled, on his feet, colour high in his cheeks.  He didn’t seem to know what to do with himself.  He’d never tried this before, kicking off; it was all of it new.  “I’m worth twelve of you!” he came out with, before storming away.
“It will give him something to do with that father of his,” Andromeda finishes about Teddy, looking content.
There’s a fierce look on Remus’s face, and Harry wonders if he knows this too.  He seems to think better of suggesting any familiarity with Sirius’s motivations or moods.
Draco leans into the cool glass behind him, shutting his eyes.  “I cast my first patronus in 1998,” he describes, because he wants Lupin to know.  “It was around this time of year.  Maybe a few weeks before.  My mother was very proud.”
The fields open up here, the trees falling away and in the distance there are farm houses, big and small, though none of them are castles like Draco’s promised that their hotel might as well be.  Harry loves castles, their thick walls and turrets.  He feels a grin steal broad across his face; he wants to put the roof down.  He feels far from home, but as though he knows the way back.
Weirdly, she clocked Malfoy years ago, when he and Harry weren’t serious and Teddy and AJ hadn’t long become friends (“So, who’s the blondie?  I see the way you look at him.”).
It’s been a long time since Draco last encountered the kind of fury on Potter’s face: complete and excoriating.  It takes him aback, because Potter’s tone is different from the one that he’s been using to argue with Lupin.  It’s darker, stronger, harsher, crueller, drawing on a deep swollen pit of emotion that has been to this point restrained, just.
Draco’s never thought about where house elves come from, which he attributes to never listening to his mother.  Beside him, Harry’s blood is high in his face, and he’s on the edge of being turned on, Draco can tell.  He always picks the most perverse moments possible, Harry.
“The three of us only ever wanted to put the war behind us,” says Hermione, short-tempered.  “Now that
“Hm,” James reads between the lines, a frown on his unscarred forehead in the mirror.  He’s increasingly canny as well as competitive, less rowdy since Lily started at school.  Harry expects all of his children to choose Ginny, when they have to.  “There’s rumours here,” is what James says.  “I think they’re getting Lily down.”
“Your ex-wife,” he says, not looking up.  “That’s what I do now, when you say something ridiculous.”
It strikes Draco, in this moment, that this is why he should be Ron’s best man, and Harry Hermione’s, and that Ron likely knew it all along.  Because he loves Hermione the way that Harry loves Ron.  Her magic is something that he never knew he was missing, and it is precious to him like nothing else.
It feels like returning to reality after fantasy, and Harry has a feeling that this is what the past six weeks have been.  A fantasy he’s dreamt up in his head.  Or maybe that’s the past twenty years.
It’s Boxing Day and Harry’s spent the past forty-eight hours mediating between Teddy and Andromeda.  It’s getting easier, sort of.  No one called anyone racist.  Apparently Teddy spent ten days of December dutifully in quarantine, because one of his mates had a positive test, and Harry really should have noticed.
was clipped and northern – from one of the cities, not Longbottom’s North.  She had three bottles of butterbeer in her other hand, her fingers spread-eagled around their necks.  “Here you go, Draco,” she said with a smile, pushing one into his hands.
Not sure what else to do, Draco stands up.  He steps away from the bed, and Harry steps away from the chair, rather more urgently.
“JAMES SIRIUS, PUT THAT GIRL DOWN!” Ginny yells towards the pitch, leaning over the barrier and slapping it with her palm.  “SHE’S JUST WON A CUP, FOR FUCK’S SAKE; SHE HAS MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO THAN SNOG YOU!”
Lupin says, nodding at Mildred, now sounding desperate to Harry’s ears.  He’s not breaking eye contact with Mrs Figg.
Harry Potter is lying on his side, curled up and relaxed with his head nestled into the other pillows, taking up the side of the bed that he prefers.  The dark grey duvet is around both of their middles, which leaves Draco feeling a little cold and he imagines leaves Harry feeling a little warm.  The man murmurs as though he’s been half awake for a while.  “I should be saying that you look beautiful in your sleep,” he says like a dick, his voice rough with the morning, “but mostly you look like a twitchy little mole in its hill.  It’s cute.”
Because he’s sitting on this grass with these people, the sun rising into hazy sky to cast light on this manor house.  Harry sees his face, he sees a crowd around and behind him, his Draco on his left and Ron and Hermione on his right, four people not ghosts acting up behind his head.
Harry looks at him, hoiking him close so that they can feel what they’ve done to each other; Draco’s face flushes and his grey eyes are a much deeper colour than usual.
“One day you must fuck me when you’re like this,” Draco says bluntly, the walls around them warm pink.
me.  You’re much more interesting.  Sneezy –” he shouted over Harry’s shoulder, distracting himself, presumably aiming for George.  “Describe me in a word.”
Unfortunately, before they can get much further into this conversation – much further into this date, Harry thinks, because they were on a date this morning, maybe – Draco’s phone pings, and when he pulls it free from his pocket, the pocket on his arse, which Harry is watching, he says, “Ah.”
Dismissively, George waves a hand.  “Oh, Gin’s fine; she doesn’t care.  Worried that the thing was going to be
“Ron…” Granger began cautiously, and she knew, Draco recalled.  She knew that his parents were dead.  She didn’t seem to know the full of it – Potter, it seemed, had kept their liaison a secret, unlike Tilda from Accounts and her lipgloss – but Granger knew nonetheless that the Malfoy name was mud and finally, at last, only his.
“Do you know what it takes,” he demands from Lupin, who’s holding his cigarette like a teenage rebel, the thing ashing down to his knuckles, “to turn a mountain lion into the dragon’s miniature form?  One has a beast already quite capable, but what one
Draco’s twilight-grey eyes flash with something like sunlight.  “What, and you watched?” he asks, filthy, and Harry can’t look away from his face.
But when he thinks about the forest, these days, Harry doesn’t remember feeling love.  He remembers feeling the strength of those who loved him, his parents and Sirius and Moony.  And Ginny most of all, who won him for a few weeks through sheer bloody-mindedness – which was good going, Harry thinks, because all evidence suggests that he is more gay than bi.  A bit repressed, at least.  Difficult, when it comes to all that.
Oh, he was a joke, Draco Malfoy.  A joke because he felt relieved, for Pansy if not for himself, if she was happy, if she really was.  A joke because he felt riven with guilt, for all of it since 1996, when his aunt had killed her cousin and his father had taken her place in Azkaban.  He was a joke, he was gay, it was almost 2008 and he loved Harry Potter, a year and a lifetime not enough to occlude the feeling away.  He loved him, he loved him, he loved him, don’t lie.
He’s grown rather tired of denouements in the drawing room of number 12, Grimmauld Place.  A nice quiet reunion between Harry and his mother…
before Draco acquiesced to touch him, and he was crying out, quite incoherent, the times after that, as Draco worked his hand and worked his mouth on the man’s hot neck.  He should have gone to his knees, probably, but the point was for Harry to feel vulnerable, and realise what it meant, to be doing this with Draco Malfoy.
“Dunno,” answers Harry, in his way.  “It’s Thursday.  McGonagall said that she won’t have me back till next week.  Sirius was saying that he wants to go for a run and and a swim and a roll down a hill, but then he picked the tiny spare room by the library, and I don’t think he had
“What am I supposed to do with it?” Draco demands.  He realises quite suddenly that this is all actually happening.  He’s become Ronald Weasley’s best man and he’s agreed to enchant Hermione Granger’s engagement ring.  He has no idea what he’s going to do.
Emboldened by a long discussion and fortified by a light lunch, Draco and Granger’s boyfriend find themselves at an independent jewellers that afternoon.  The address is a short walk from Bond Street, which ultimately means Mayfair.
The age difference could have been a problem for Molly, Harry supposes.  It seems a bit daft; Percy and Audrey have three children these days and are clearly very happy together, being pernickety.  Audrey makes excellent cake.
