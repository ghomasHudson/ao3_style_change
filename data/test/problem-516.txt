“Severus?” Weasley speaks for the first time in a few minutes. “Why are you on a first-name basis with that git?”
“Why not?”
"Not bad." Draco cleared his throat. "How old are you?"
“If you aren’t busy, you should come with me. It’ll be fun,” he says, fingers curled around Draco’s thin wrist.
With that, he bolts.
Harry elbowed him, though he seemed to find it amusing, as well.
"Beautiful, beautiful..." Draco applauds. As he claps, his eyes catch on something near Potter's feet, and his heart stops.
Draco nodded.
“What’s wrong, Mr Malfoy?”
Draco rolled his eyes, and crouched down to pick up the book he'd dropped. Zabini doesn't move, though he does continue to watch. "How come you're not in class?"
"I've just noticed a lot of Wrackspurts floating around you lately, and didn't want you to be lonely," Luna explains, because she’s an angel and Draco loves her. "Are you sure, then?"
It took him even longer to get past the riddle with Potter breathing near his ear, though eventually he managed. Draco ran up to his empty dormitory, and sat down on his bed, back straight. A memory from first-year surfaced, just for a moment.
Draco poked his head into the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom. Umbridge was sat at her desk, wearing a fluffy pink cardigan over her shoulders, a pristine white quill in her hand. She was too focused on the parchment in front of her to have noticed Draco, who had gotten to class early and was now waiting outside. He had sprinted from breakfast to check for any evidence of them doing a practical lesson, as he had already decided he'd be leaving before it even began. First Lupin, and then fake-Moody... He refused to be traumatised again, even if it affected his O.W.L performance.
, his magic screamed.
"What the bloody hell was that?" Corner said. His face was an unnatural white.
Draco inclined his head, anxiety bubbling in his stomach. Teddy wasn’t there, which meant Potter had come for some other reason. There wasn’t anything visibly wrong with him, so maybe he wasn’t here for Healing.
The tunnel seemed to never end. Draco crawled and crawled, but the darkness didn’t have a finish in sight. His knees were aching, and concern for a Weasley was making him feel confused. Potter murmured something he couldn’t quite catch and kept moving. Finally, the tunnel began to rise, twist, and Granger’s stupid cat was gone from view. A faint light showed up in the corner of his eye.
past..."
It continues like a memory, only with blanks in the narrative. Draco doesn’t know what diary it is that Riddle is yammering about (and something about a snake?), nor why he’s there in the first place. He had definitely not actually fallen into a Pensieve, and he doesn’t think Potter had gone up against
“I have friends,” Draco says. “From my house, but we’re not like, close or anything.”
He was in a graveyard, of some kind. Headstones erupted from the ground every couple metres, but the stone of each one was so old the names were practically impossible to read. Draco brushed a hand against one, and though it felt mossy and wet on his skin, his fingers went right through it. He turned around, small puffs of air falling from his lips, and found Cedric Diggory peering right at him.
After his little epiphany on what it was that was so often used in his dreams, Draco hung around Harry a lot more. He was the only one who could know, after all, as nobody else had realised Draco was a Seer. Except, perhaps, Professor Trelawney, who was acting battier every lesson. She had them doing horoscopes this year because apparently space was fucking omnipotent.
"You're not meant to be in here, you know," Draco murmured. "It's against the rules."
The Gryffindor trio enter their own world after that. Draco is tempted to leave them to it, but he’s curious (stupid Ravenclaw habits), so he decides to stay, at least until curfew. He watches Granger disappear between one of the aisles and come back with a dusty old tomb. He watches them whisper, bouncing ideas off one another, but they all circle back to Snape. A feeling of dread curls in Draco’s stomach.
“Would’ve been against the rules,” she said. “if I started using it for things other than my studies.”
“As long as you don’t tell a teacher about it either,” Granger adds. “We aren’t meant to know anything about it.”
been simple, yet Draco still wished Potter had had a reason to stay for a bit longer. Suddenly annoyed, he pushed himself up and returned to work.
The pendant is sculpted into the shape of the flowers Draco usually associated with Valentine’s Day. The connection makes him blush, for some reason.
Granger and Weasley had beat him there but wasted no time in including Draco in their conversation. Once Granger hurried off in a fit of hysterics, Weasley retold Diggory, Fleur, and Krum's efforts in getting their egg. He made it all sound very dramatic, when really it had just been terrifying. "Come on, let's go see your score."
"So, Mr Malfoy, what would you say is your greatest fear?"
“Draco, are you well enough to stand?”
"I can never get those things working," Tonks said.
A series of bubbles reached the gloomy surface. Draco straightened up, hoping, but it was only Cedric Diggory who popped out from the lake. He had Cho held tightly in his arms, a worried look on his pretty face.
? Because, to me, it seems that you’ve not been meaning to at all.”
“Good afternoon,” he whispers, approaching them. “Mr Malfoy, correct? Which is your wand arm?”
“What?” Potter interjects, finishing his tirade about Dobby and Colin Creevey and who-knows-what else. “Dobby is yours?”
Severus opened the door anyway and found Draco standing right behind it.
His heart stuttered.
His room was clearly owned by someone who had never struggled for money. The bed was large, with silk pillowcases and soft sheets, pressed up against one of four grey walls. A tall cabinet rested near the door, filled with items that Draco hasn't touched for years. On top of the cabinet, a box of glittering jewellery and books were placed. In particular, a necklace from one Harry Potter— the rose pendant hanging off it had been rubbed at so often by Draco, its metal had gone an ugly dull.
don’t care.” He snatches it from her grasp. “Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to
He moved to look out and investigate, but Luna held onto his wrist before he could stand. She shook her head minutely.
"Nothing at all," Weasley adds, as if that made it more convincing.
Draco could only muster up a handful of pity for her, especially after seeing a blush spread along Harry's thin neck. "Hey."
Draco frowned at his lap, where his hands were fiddling with one another. Half the contestants had their romantic partners taken. Fleur had her sister, which made sense, yet Harry had Weasley. They weren’t related, nor were they dating.
He’d been right. Back at his office, there was a whole lineup of people waiting to get diagnosed in the chairs Draco had set up in the corridor outside. Most of them looked like easy cases to solve, but a few were probably serious.
Tonks laughed.
Draco could’ve vomited. Instead, he pulled away from Snape, and said, “I’m not a Seer.”
"Malfoy's not a Seer, Harry. That's impossible."
“What triggered it?” Severus asks. He sounds merely curious, but Draco reads the meaning behind his words. He’ll need an explanation for Draco’s parents, since the school will be contacting them about his visit to the Hospital Wing. “Well?”
Mortified, Draco dropped into the seat beside Potter. He also shoved Luna's flower into his bag.
He pressed a hand over his mouth and took a step closer to Potter as if it would help. But, no. Not even the most handsome man in the world could stop the memory from flushing through him. Severus would die on this very floor, perhaps tonight...
“The Hospital Wing. I’ll have Madam Pomfrey give you a sleeping draught if you think you need one.”
, though. Draco wished it hadn’t happened at all.
Draco had missed her with his entire being. "Gurdyroots... Are those the things you make tea with?"
"What?" Potter practically shouts. "Who is he? We've been looking for weeks but no book seems to mention him! Even Hermione doesn't know who he is, and she's, like, the smartest person in our year."
"Has Mistress' house been saved? Has Kreacher finally found a worthy master? Oh, let it be so, let it be so!"
Draco, suspicious, hastened a glance into the compartment behind him. "She's in there! Move out of the way, Longbottom."
"Oh. You're not? I'm not totally sure, but it seems unlikely for the Potter family to have Slytherin blood in them. Not impossible, obviously. But..."
The bell rung out across the library, signalling the end of class and giving Draco an excuse not to prolong the encounter any longer than necessary. "See you around, Zabini."
• • •
Weasley sat on a huge four-poster bed in the middle of the room, his leg bent in the same way Draco’s had been in the Chamber of Secrets.
Severus disappears around the corner. Draco sighs, shoves his face into his hands and tries to put out the anger burning through him.
Voices whispered around him. He ignores them, and continues to rock back and forth. He imagines his mother’s soft hand running back and forth through his hair, and his father’s reassurances.
“Hold on...”
Draco’s breathing was coming out short and sporadic. Not now, he begged. This was the worst time for a panic attack. Harry needed him.
The scratching of the students’ quills stilled as soon as Draco bounds inside, but he takes no notice. He walks right past the tables and to Severus, who had been making notes on the board, and whispers, “I need to talk to you.”
The boy shrugs, disinterested. Draco frowns. “Do you - do you know what house you’ll be in? My parents want me in Slytherin, of course…”
Hermione smacks him on the shoulder. When Potter makes a wounded noise, she gestures furiously in Draco’s direction. “Okay. I think that’s my cue to leave…”
“I’m going to go,” he announces, despite none of them appearing to listen.
“Please,” Draco begs through gritted teeth. Severus passes him a cup of icy water that he probably summoned with his wand. He takes tiny sips, each one calming him down bit by bit. Eventually he asks for his blanket.
make sense. But, Draco still had bloody morals. And, also, maybe, an unrequited crush on his best friend... "No. Absolutely not."
"Yeah, probably." Draco laid down and turned his head so he could face Luna as he slept. She did the same.
Unwillingly, yesterday’s memory resurfaces in his mind, of Potter’s unexpected appearance at the hospital. Logically, Draco had known Professor Lupin had had a kid before he’d died (he thought briefly of Aunt Bella and the Dark Lord), but he’d never quite processed what that meant. He wondered why Potter was looking after Teddy if the kid was Lupin’s. What had happened to his mother? Or uncles and aunts?
"Don't be afraid," Professor Lupin began, "I had Dumbledore find a few boggarts for me so I could teach you all how to repel the creatures. So, let's begin. Does anybody know what a boggart is?"
“You most certainly can not!” Draco said, clutching the diary to his chest, cheeks pink. “The future must be kept secret, you fiend!”
On Christmas morning, Draco wakes to a pile of presents at the end of his bed. The bigger ones sit in the middle, with the smaller gifts circling it like some sort of strange cult ritual.
It's too late now.
A few days after Harry was picked for the tournament, Draco has his next lesson with Moody.
This is where things start really going downhill.
"So you lied instead? Look, you don't owe me anything, but friends shouldn't keep stuff from each other. Not big stuff, anyway. Like, you were there for me when I was a wreck about Black. I wanted to kill him."
"Well, you could be with me, then," said Zabini, crossing his arms over his chest. "It makes sense, no? Our parents know each other, we're both Pureblood and you're handsome enough."
He resisted the urge to hex her. Cho was a perfectly nice girl, if a bit boy-crazy. Unfortunately, Harry fancied her, which obviously was enough to erase all those positive qualities and leave Draco with a burning jealous whenever they spoke. "Is that so? Well— well, go on, then!"
“Loads of people,” said Harry. “Some Bulgarian ministers, Cornelius Fudge, Draco and his family.”
Percy Weasley appears beside Draco. He snatches the diary from his grip and chucks it back to Potter. "There you go. Now, everyone back to class! That's an order! Show's over, everybody!"
“My brother works for Crouch. He claims Crouch has overworked himself,” Weasley commented.
Draco turned his back on them, walking down the narrow aisle between two lines of seats. There’s a family of goblins huddled together in the front, and a pair of Aurors playing Exploding Snap over a circle-shaped table near the window. Draco found a seat in the back, purposefully out of view from the Aurors. Through the glass, his cottage sped out of view in a blur of green and blue.
Before she could answer, Luna sat down in the seat beside Draco. Her wand was placed behind her ear, and she was wearing a new charm around her neck. Neither Draco or Granger commented on it, as they were used to her strange accessories by now. "Have you two read the new Quibbler article yet?"
Oh. Right.
"Not just that," Potter said. "Fred and George gave me this map of Hogwarts. It's got a bunch of secret passageways and tells me where everyone is at."
“Don’t try anything,” Draco found himself saying. His voice didn’t sound like his own. It was protective, brave. “You’ll have to go through us first.”
Draco blinks away the tears lining his eyeballs. “You don’t know him like I do, Potter.”
Draco doesn’t know what to think about the whole evil-Professor-Snape aspect. He doubts his godfather would bother with such a confusing plan… But, then again, Harry claimed his scar had hurt the first time he’d seen Severus, and the man
, a voice reminded him.
“I can’t change things.”
“Yeah, well, food runs out, in case you’d forgotten,” said Draco grumpily. She rolled her eyes and grabbed a bag of his usual cat food from the shelf above her. Patil dumped it unceremoniously onto the counter.
means.” Potter laughs.
The worst thing was, it
Although … he would prefer some simple patients for once. Draco often got stuck with curses and exploding illnesses.
"Let's see what's in your future, Malfoy." Weasley turned the cup around a couple of times, squinting at one point. "Now, I suppose that could be an artichoke, which is meant to represent..." He paused and looking down at his
Severus raised an eyebrow, seriously doubtful. “You really should stop hanging around Gryffindor’s so much. They’re making you act incredibly stupid.” With that, he left to go find Potter, Granger, and Sirius.
The next morning, as he was preparing to leave, Snape caught him and requested for them to speak. Draco agreed, only so he could get away from Terry and Luna’s questions. They walked up and down an empty corridor for a while, until Snape finally found his words and said, “You understand my position in the first war, don’t you?”
After buying a bowl of soup each, they find a secluded table in the corner to sit at. Draco crossed a leg over the other and thought of Potter for what felt like the hundredth time in the last three days. It was completely insane; Draco had managed without the git for years, and suddenly they speak again for ten minutes and it’s all his mind can focus on. He had thought— hoped, foolishly— that his childish infatuation with Potter had gone away with the Dark Lord.
When Draco finally reached the Hospital Wing, Madam Pomfrey didn’t bother with too many questions and just set to work at fixing Ron’s broken bone. It looked painful, so he looked away and hoped the others would be okay. He had been a bit mad when they attacked Severus in the shack, but it would be worth it to let Sirius walk as a free man, again. No innocent witch or wizard deserves to rot in Azkaban for the rest of their lives.
“Yes, yes, alright. You can have the wretched book, as long as you don’t…” He visibly shivers, hastily shoving a few galleons into Borgin’s hands. “Don’t ask that stupid oaf anything.”
“Then Harry had some kind of epiphany about the entrance being inside Myrtle’s bathroom, so we found Lockhart and went in. The place sort of crashed around us, though, which is why we were separated.”
He thought of Sev’s counting exercises and his mother’s soothing voice. One, two... Five, six...
He grabs the wand from it’s fancy box excitedly, but it does nothing except force Mr Ollivander to take it back. “That’s alright, that’s alright. Perhaps a rowan wood, instead. Bit longer, too. Yes, yes, go on.”
“It’s… extravagant,” Draco whispers. He snaps himself out of it and addresses Hagrid. “I’m assuming you brought the trees in?”
Granger shakes him awake as they pull into Hogsmeade station, urging him to change into his robes, while Luna is busy tucking her wand behind her ear.
In one of these particular lessons, Harry leaned over and murmured in his ear, "You should be the teacher, instead."
my book of interesting creatures for the rest of the trip! Do not interrupt me unless it is the trolley lady with her delicious chocolate frogs, for Mother had me sworn off them all summer!”
“That was ages ago,” Draco says. “But I forgive you.”
It was quiet for a moment. Everyone knew he meant Draco.
Harry was dragged away to sit with the other champions to eat. Draco noticed Granger's absence, then, and glanced around for a glimpse of her bushy hair, but he couldn't see it anywhere. They found a table for themselves, and ate in awkward silence, as Weasley refused to make conversation with Padma, and Luna kept humming Muggle songs that she called 'elevator music'.
Weasley was flushed bright red. Draco jerked his chin at him and asked, “What’s wrong with him?”
“Maybe it’s a coincidence.”
"I don't know, Potter. I was thinking about just taking a nap."
"Hi, Malfoy," said Weasley, "Has Umbridge been in an of your classes yet?"
are on the tip of his tongue, but Draco allows them to fizzle away before he could be bothered to utter them. He knows the Gryffindors will reveal themselves eventually (and his fellow Ravenclaws are probably waiting for him somewhere) but Draco sort of would liked some time to himself. Maybe this girl could give him the peace he craved. So, Draco decided, it’d be best for her to stay. “No. I’m not.”
“You look like a vampire, Malfoy,” Weasley comments as they approach.
The diary is starting to give him the creeps, too. Some of its replies are worryingly vague, while others bordered on threatening. But every time he tries to tell someone about it, a strong wave of fear pulses through him, and he can't get the words out. Draco will have to rid himself of it over Christmas and to do that meant staying back at Hogwarts. Luna volunteered to as well, to keep him company.
Potter raises an eyebrow, doubtful. “Right. Why are you two dressed up like Snape again?”
Teddy shook his head. Draco smiled and continued, “Well, do you think that might be the issue? When exactly did the problem start? Around dinner, before bed …”
As promised, the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang parties arrived the afternoon before Hallowe'en, in their fancy, horse-drawn carriage and gigantic ship. Draco had watched with Terry Boot beside him, curiosity fluttering in his stomach.
Potter’s face breaks out into a smile. His green eyes shine with something. Relief, maybe. “I’ve been trying to talk to you, but we don’t really have any classes together.”
Later that evening, Draco arrived at the Entrance Hall to find a large crowd milling around a large sign hung up at the staircase. He pushed through the students, and read-out-loud what had been posted. "
"Er, non. Je suis English, désolé," Draco said, the words unfamiliar in his mouth. She giggled, probably due to his horrible accent. "Au revoir?"
"You can't. I know you must be missing your father."
The ugly creature threw itself at Draco's feet. He flinched away from it and said, "Get off me!"
“My apologies. I think my father might’ve…” He grabs the strange book. It was definitely a diary of sorts. Not one of Draco’s (thank Merlin) but he still decided to take it back. “Yes, sorry! My father must’ve accidentally misplaced it. Goodbye!”
Once Draco’s showered and in a Muggle turtleneck and jeans, he headed for the kitchen and conducted a half-hearted search in his cupboards. He already knew there wasn’t any food in the house though, since he hasn’t quite kicked the habit of simply assuming a house-elf will come and restock it for him.
The rest of the morning went very enjoyably. So well, in fact, that Draco only shot the Ravenclaw one longing look! Terry had noticed and sent him a cheery wave in response. Once breakfast was over, Draco was forced to separate from the three. He had Muggle Studies, which Granger dropped in third-year, whilst they had Care of Magical Creatures. Briefly, he regretted never choosing it.
Draco shouldered past the throng of people, and slowly reached the edge of the forest. He looked over his shoulder, searching for a head of blonde hair. What seemed like every tent was on his fire, giving the busy field an orange glow. He couldn't see Luna anywhere, though, so he kept moving.
As if summoned, Helga appeared and weaved herself between his legs. She yawns at him, evidently having just woken up herself.
He felt, inexplicably, like crying. It explained a lot, though— why his house has been ignoring him, why students he's never even met before seem afraid of him. They're all under the assumption that Draco's going to become a fucking Death Eater. And Zabini had tried telling him... No, that wasn’t right. Zabini had been trying to
here to sell items that may look… Hm, suspicious, if the Ministry were to find them in the Manor.”
"Stop it!"
He choked.
“Peter Pettigrew was killed twelve years ago!” Snape snapped, suddenly angry. “I don’t know what Black has told you, but he proved himself capable of murder when he was sixteen-years-old! He deserves exactly what he’s going to get, so I won’t hear any more nonsense about his innocence! What would your father say? He’s already mad you didn’t want him to speak at Hagrid’s trial.”
Draco wakes up on a cold floor with Harry Potter bent over him. His hair is somehow even more of a mess than usual, and he’s caked in a layer of dirt. “Have I died?”
He mumbles unintelligibly in a response, then gestures for Potter to slide open the door himself. He does, entering with a loud creak, and plops into the space across from Draco. They sit silently for a few moments, simply glancing at each other, before Potter says, “I’m sorry I missed your birthday.”
had unexpected written all over it. Really, what kind of ice-cream was Astoria getting that was worth owing a favour to a Slytherin? Though, it might be more about the company she’s getting it with …
Nine, ten.
"I'll get us some light," whispered Tonks, and no sooner had she said it did the tip of her wand put the narrow hallway they had entered into a dim light. Draco was sure his breathing sounded heavier than usual. "Now, stay quiet, Draco. Oh - and don't touch anything."
He receives a silky blanket from his mother, some rings, and two new journals to write in from his father. A few books from various relatives, and then sweets from his Ravenclaw friends. Nothing from Potter, since their friendship only began a few days prior, but Draco wonders if they’ll still like each other enough for presents next year. The idea has him smiling, for some reason.
"Oh, please don't bring up—"
, a voice whispered.
That... hurt. Like, a lot more than Draco expected it to. He’s tried so hard to be more than a Death Eater’s son, to be more than Lucius’ gross ideals. It had taken months for him to even think of challenging what he’d always been taught— but he had done it, eventually. And sure, perhaps without the dreams, he never would’ve bothered, but Black had no fucking right to just assume he was some carbon-copy of his father; that his friendship with Harry was clouded in something malicious.
“You’re just jealous,” interjects that twerp first-year kid. Draco briefly ponders if he had looked so small last year.
• • •
“There he is!” Luna said, pointing out at the lake. Harry burst from the water, breathing heavily, with a little blonde girl in one arm and Weasley in the other. The three seemed physically alright, but the girl had a very scared look on her face.
"Not even a little," Draco chirps helpfully. He doesn't let go of Potter's hand, and starts dragging him further down the corridor. "Come on, then. We're almost there."
The two of them start for the door. Draco watched the back of Potter’s head out.
Draco blushed. He went to bite into his toast but missed his mouth, and crumbs fell to the table. Harry laughed, and things felt okay.
“No, I mean, from the robe-shop,” Potter elaborated. “Don’t you remember? We met, and you saw Hagrid with the ice-cream. Did you know who I was, then?”
Severus pulled something from his coat pocket and handed it to him. It was a piece of scrap parchment. "Memorise that. Quickly, please."
Draco stood up and rushed down the middle of the crowd. Luna followed after a moment of hesitating, and soon the two were talking with the four champions and their rescued persons on the ground.
"What— what d'you think is going on?"
“Indeed,” Snape said, and they walked for a couple more minutes of silence. “Dumbledore expects me to return to my position as a spy, and ordered for me to go to the Dark Lord the same night he returned.”
His eyes were slipping closed. His grip on the book weakened, and it fell to the carpet floor. Draco's head leaned forward, and there he slept; there he dreamed.
“It is,” Draco said. “Because this time you were meant to be meeting with Sirius at the station, to spend the summer with him. Only, it got all fucked up, and now you aren’t. So, yeah. Sorry.”
A sound upstairs stopped Harry from replying.
Granger narrowed her brown eyes at him. “What’re you up to, Malfoy?”
“The werewolf would be deep in the forest by now, I won’t be anywhere near it.” He stood up and conjured a stretcher for Ron. “I’ll go fetch Black, though the dementors would’ve sensed him by now.”
He heads back up to his dorm after that.
“Diagon Alley, please,” he said, passing her a Galleon. Jessie returned him some Sickles in exchange.
"Nothing," Granger says, voice pitched high.
Pansy and a boy called Blaise sit with him on the train. It had been a boring journey, filled with stilted questions and uncomfortable silences. When they finally arrived, Draco quickly separated from them into the endless sea of students.
A thick, green snake floated in the air behind them. It hovered in an orb that radiated powerful magic. Draco’s breath caught. The knowledge of what was about to happen comes to him as easily as walking does.
The next two months passed quickly for all the students. By the time the second Hogsmeade weekend was announced, a layer of snow had fallen over Hogwarts, a pretty reminder of the holiday ahead.
"You're meant to stir it, dear," Trelawney muttered as she walked past them, probably noticing Draco's confusion.
Ginny raised an eyebrow at him. "And I doubt you would've noticed either way Malfoy if I'm right in remembering you were drunk for the better half of that night. What d'you want with a pair of earrings for anyway?"
Draco startled back, reaching blindly for a tree to hold him up. The Dark Mark stared down at him, making the stars look green and cruel. The trees rustled as more people noticed the smokey skull come into existence. He squeezed his eyes shut, and bit down hard enough on his lip for blood to seep out. A terrible thought came to him as the darkness behind his eyelids hid the scenery around him; one that chilled him to his very bone— Lucius, Draco's own father, was probably out there, not helping to round up the rogue Death Eater's but aiding them, instead. He'd be fighting under the same moon, under the same stars that Draco was hiding under, without any care for the Muggles they were torturing.
Potter notices his tearful eyes and panicked expression. "Please don't cry, Draco. It's just some diary from fifty years ago."
It doesn’t.
Draco bites his lips and puts the necklace on. “Thank you.”
“I’m not,” Draco denies hotly. It’s a lie. They’d both witnessed it last night. “At least, I wasn’t… I haven’t since I was nine.”
“Incest-y?”
"Don't protect him!" Snape snarled, and glared right up at the staircase where Harry was probably standing. "That is Potter's egg, and that piece of parchment belongs to him, too! I saw it last year! Potter is here, in his Invisibility Cloak! And, you!" he whirled around to point at Draco. "Were you planning to meet with him? Try to help him figure out the clue, despite it being against the tournament rules?"
“That’s what we are going for, so thank you,” Draco says. “They are just the most
Draco thinks irrationally.
Weasley sneers, but there’s a twinkle in his eye like he thought it was funny too that betrays him. “Malfoy…”
Edward is seven years old and has come in before for a few seriously minor injuries. One time, he saw, for a Muggle spider bite. Draco almost chuckled at that, because. Well,
There’s some halfhearted grumbles, but they eventually go back to bed. Draco still has his eyes closed.
"Why is that boy so wet?" Luna asked no one in particular, staring over at the Gryffindor table, where a tiny first-year had just sat down at. He was dripping all over the floor, buzzing with excitement ... or the cold.
She glanced up from her pile of rattling artefacts and stared at the pearl earrings dangling from his fingertips. "I wouldn't wear them."
He frowned and didn’t feel particularly hungry anymore.
“That’s alright. I’d still like to see.”
Potter is also there, which he wisely ignores. The git hadn’t responded to any of his owls over summer, despite promising to stay in touch after they’d reconciled on the train in June.
Draco sticks his left arm in the air. Ollivander then measures from Draco’s shoulder to little finger, wrist to elbow, knee to armpit, and eventually around his head. He didn’t really know what all that has to do with getting a wand, but Ollivander must’ve been doing this for years and probably wouldn’t do something just for the fun of it - hopefully. “Let me think… Yes.”
“I don’t care.” Potter hesitated and then laid down beside him, so they were both facing the bed’s navy blue canopy. “I don’t want to get you worked up again, but Trelawney always refuses to start class when you’re late. She doesn’t do that for anyone else.”
For starters, Terry insisted on arriving early so they didn't risk missing anything. The other Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had a similar idea, and soon the corridor was filled with excited murmurs of what Professor Moody would have them be doing. Draco just hoped it wasn't anything practical, like the boggart that Lupin had shown them. He wasn't prepared to experience anything too traumatising this early into term.
Draco stared at the ground. “Sure. You were Dumbledore’s spy.”
Based on the watch that one of the goblins is wearing, it’s 7:13 A.M. when they finally skid to a harsh halt outside the Leaky Cauldron. Draco jumped from his seat immediately, keeping his head down as he made for the front. Jessie gave him a friendly wave as he left.
Snape's hands dropped back to his sides. Draco let out a relieved breath and watched his godfather step back down to their level. "I merely thought that Potter should be heading back to bed. For - for his own safety."
Weasley clicked his fingers. Draco’s stomach clenched uncomfortably. “The Malfoy’s! I bet it was your dad, Draco!”
“This book is dark!” she hisses, finishing a page about magical poisons. She sounds remarkably scandalised for a girl who’s fingers are itching to read the next chapter. Draco rolls his eyes. “I’m serious!”
"Did he tell you personally he wouldn't be here?" the second voice replied, with a hint of irritation. Severus continued after a beat, "Because if not, I think I'll be ignoring your advice."
Weasley and Potter glance at each other. “Well, we were visiting Hermione in the Hospital Wing when we found a scrap of paper in her hand that said what had been attacking the students. A basilisk.”
The end of lunch bell rung, and he stood and could see the heads of Weasley and Potter heading in the direction of Trelawney's classroom. He sped up and matched their pace. "Hello."
Potter brown skin flushes pink. Draco throws his head back and laughs.
Potter wants to go, though. He slips Draco a note during Astronomy on whether he’d like to meet up beforehand. They still haven’t had that talk about why all of his carefully crafted letters went ignored over the holidays, but it was bound to happen eventually. Draco decides if Potter is too busy dreaming about duelling, they could get through the chat quickly.
"You can dance," a voice— Harry's— said by his ear. Draco jumped and sloshed half his drink onto the front of Luna's dress. She simply shrugged and floated away. "Why didn't you say you could dance?"
After first period, he had Divination. Harry passed him a note saying that they were to meet Sirius on Saturday, at Hogsmeade, and it’d be nice if Draco came. Nice wouldn’t be the word he would use— Sirius didn’t like him— but he agreed, anyway.
The next morning, Granger is nowhere to be seen. Draco questions the two Gryffindor's about it, but they’re set on keeping it a secret. He is sure it had something to do with their behaviour the night before, but isn’t sure
“I don’t want to be part of the dumb team!”
He’d picked up smoking from Blaise in sixth year. He and Pansy had fucked off to America after the war, but the habit persists. Draco preferred not to think of them, so he cleared his throat and moved to finish his visit to Diagon Alley.
Half an hour passed like that; Draco calling for patients, figuring out their problem as quickly as he could, and sending them back with a cure or some advice (“Derek, this isn’t a magic problem. You’ve just stained your skin with hair dye.”), and then he’d call the next one in. At about 2 P.M., something finally interesting happened.
"Hello, Draco." She smiled softly at him. "Did you have a lovely summer?"
Lucius sweeps out of the shop. Draco waits till he’s completely gone from view before stepping towards Ginny.
“Er, yeah. I reckon so.”
They stopped in front of the trapdoor leading to the classroom, and Draco went first to climb up. Trelawney was talking to two Gryffindor girls, and didn't look up when the three entered. Harry led them toward a table near the back, and they sat down in silence.
Draco could feel everybody staring at him. He seemed to have lost his voice.
"What? No. I'm just saying, I genuinely can't think of an instance in which the potion could be used for good and not some evil plan. Or, how about something sexual? What if you drank some and turned into your crush or whatever, and just wanked yourself off? It's an invasion of privacy, is what it is! A form of, of possession!"
“This is quite the rare type of wand, Mr Malfoy,” Ollivander explains as he packs up the failed attempts. Mother starts counting her galleons to pay. “Lime-wood and unicorn hair, ten inches. Lime-wood wands often choose wizards and witches who are blessed in the arts of legilimency and divination.” The man smiles. “That is two very curious wands sold today! How exciting.”
Finally, they reached the castle entrance. He trailed after a group of gossiping sixth-years and was soon seated at the Ravenclaw table, stomach rumbling. Draco had only eaten a few Chocolate Frogs on the train, and as such was extremely hungry. Yet the feast wouldn't start till after the Sorting, which was always very boring. It was so repetitive— except for the Hat's song. This year, it sang a very long one, which made out Ravenclaw to be one of the better houses, Draco noticed (and agreed with). The cleverest would always be the best.
Draco privately thinks he’s a little scary-looking. “That’s, um… He looks very nice?”
“Why aren’t you in class?” Sev replied in his ‘I’m-teaching-you-have-to-leave’ voice. “Nevermind, I’ll speak to you at lunch, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco licked his lip and nodded.
The title read ‘Harry Potter’s Secret Heartache’ and was all about Hermione Granger’s horrid affair with Viktor Krum, just as Draco had predicted it to be. “Well, well, well. I have never read something so tragic! How could you, Granger? Harry adores you!”
.. "Where did you find this?"
"Try putting a carrot on a string, then. It'll complete her collection."
The end of the summer came alarmingly fast once Harry was cleared of all charges. Draco spent his last few hours at Grimmauld Place double-checking he had packed everything for the coming months, and making promises to Mrs Weasley that he wouldn't be a stranger. Tonks, Moody, and Lupin escorted them to the station, as well as Sirius, who insisted on coming along in his dog-form.
"Are you alright?"
Right?
"I think you should go up to bed," Harry replied. He placed his palm on Draco's cheek. "You're burning up."
She flushed an indignant red, and pulled the magazine from his hands. Granger read through it very quickly, getting angrier with each line. Harry and Weasley read over her shoulder. “What utter rubbish! First, she went after Hagrid, and now me! And— and how did she know about Viktor asking me to...”
"Tell me what it is."
"Wotcher, Severus," the witch said. "Is this—?"
"Maybe he's mad at you, for saying you imagined your scar hurting," Draco suggested. He'd been informed about Harry's dream a few days ago and was frankly horrified at what it might mean.
"It's a powerful curse, that. You could all try to point your wands at me and say the words, but the worse thing I'd get would be a nose-bleed. Of course, none of that matters. I'm not here to show you how to do it, but to have you appreciate what the worse truly is."
. That never happens. Usually I’m just watching conversations happen.”
"I don't get it," Harry said, in disbelief. "I got hurt. Why a ten?"
to. "I like to think I'm a real expert in all things future, and I've not got a bad feeling about your hearing, okay? So stay positive!"
A loud crash from another compartment made Draco flinch. Another moment passed and all the lights went out, plunging them into a pool of darkness. Luna's fingers on his wrist moved into his palm. He squeezed her hand, she squeezed back.
"I'll just be heading to bed, now." Snape gave each one of them another glare, and sauntered off down the hall, black dressing gown billowing behind him.
The library, usually, is pretty empty on Friday evenings, so it is with great surprise that Draco discovers Harry, Weasley and Granger huddled around a pile of books sometime in February. Their backs are turned away from him, practically begging to be snuck up on. And sneak up he did.
She laughs a tinkling little laugh that reminds Draco of sleigh bells. She does that a lot.
"Oh, yes. They can ward off Gulping Plimpies, too."
Sirius snapped out of his daze immediately, and a snarl came upon his lips. "What're you doing?"
Was that all Draco was ever destined to be? Lucius Malfoy's only son... An ex-Death-Eater's child...
Where the blanket doesn’t fully cover him, a light breeze floated across the room and takes shelter, leaving a ghostly imprint of goosebumps on Draco’s skin. He shivered and pulled the blanket tighter around him, but it does little to return him to that blissful state of deep sleep— the curse of consciousness had already taken root, which meant he could either waste a few minutes in bed or get up to have a shower and prepare breakfast.
After that, Draco doesn’t know. He can’t recall who moved first, though both his father and Mr Weasley gave as good as they got. Punches were thrown, customers watched. Embarrassment floods him the whole time, and makes him realise Lucius was acting like a hypocrite. Honestly, you can’t insult someone’s reputation and then fight them in a place where everyone can see.
Severus doesn’t bother saying anything, but he does nod when everyone else is turned away. Draco supposes that’s the closest thing to affection that his godfather can manage.
For the next few weeks, people would stare at Draco with either pity or alarm; sometimes both. And worse, whenever he closed his eyes, that same image came to mind; Severus turning pale and still, his chest growing still. After one particularly awful night of this, Corner forced him into the Hospital Wing so Pomfrey could give him a Dreamless Sleep and Calming Draught. He only left feeling worse.
“Sorry, sorry,” Potter says, although he didn’t sound particularly apologetic. He allows Draco to duck backward a little, but doesn't entirely let him go. Their faces are incredibly close. “I just-- I thought you were dead. We all did. You looked like a corpse when I came in, and Riddle was there, and he almost…”
Mr Crouch must've been hiding his stupidity behind that fancy Muggle suit, because no half-way-intelligent wizard could believe that Harry Potter had conjured the Dark Mark. In fact, Draco doubted Harry even knew what it was, what it meant.
"Sad?" Draco supplied. He got comments like these all the time, especially after the whole Boggart incident last year. "Well, unfortunately, that's just my face."
Draco rolled his eyes. "Why're you complaining? You're tied for first!"
Draco shook his head, lying. The last thing he’d wanted from today was to see Granger and Weasley swapping spit, albeit in the future.
Number twelve Grimmauld Place was a black-painted building, with grimy windows and a neglected garden. There was an overwhelming sense of unhappiness about it, and already Draco was dreading stepping inside. However, as Severus tapped at the doorknob with his wand, he knew he had no choice. It was either this, or going back home where You-Know-Who could find use of him at any moment.
The next few days passed in a numb, forgetful sort of way. Draco kept himself busy up in his bedroom, reading books and doing any last-minute homework. Only the house-elves bothered to make sure he was still eating, as neither of his parents ever knocked on his door to make sure he was okay— Lucius was rarely home at all, lately. So, when September first finally came around, he was glad to have been done with summer. The castle's twisting corridors and moving staircases had never seemed so alluring in Draco's mind.
Honestly, Draco knew it wasn't himself that was important. It was the futures planted inside his head. "How come you're so nice to Tonks and not me?" he asked, as it had been haunting him since the day he'd arrived.
Potter shakes his head. “He isn’t bothering me. Not really. I’m just worried. How does a house-elf even know so much about the Chamber of Secrets? Ron reckons your dad helped open it, and that’s what all the attacks are.”
“You’re talking about Crouch, aren’t you?” Draco said, despite knowing full-well that Sirius wouldn’t want to talk to him. “Everyone’s saying he’s sick, despite having never been so ill to miss work before. Plus, he hasn’t been turning up for the tournament.”
“Right, cause you’d never do that.”
"I know who he is."
Luna popped up beside him. "You can see them?"
Hardly aware of the sob that came from Padma behind him, Draco ran for the doors.
Moody raised his wand, and the spider stopped rocking in pain. It relaxed, barely, still twitching slightly. He put it back in the jar, after putting it back to its proper size. "You would be Lucius Malfoy's son, eh?"
Draco whirled around, only to knock right into the girl herself, as she had already spotted him and begun to walk serenely in his direction. "Luna!"
"Right. That's why you all look like you'll run off at the slightest sound," Draco grumbles, feeling left-out. "Potter, you're not actually the heir of Slytherin, are you? Is that why you're so nervous? Planning another attack tonight, perhaps?"
Stifling a grin, Draco tiptoed over to the shut door. Septimus was a little shit most of the time, but he could also be quite amusing.
Never before had Draco felt so relieved to hear Ron Weasley's voice. He scrambled over to them, got a glimpse of Harry's face with Granger's own glowing wand, and immediately fell to the forest floor himself.
“You killed my parents.”
“Teddy,” ventured Draco. He hastened a glance at Potter, wondering if the nickname was okay, and received a short nod. “Could you try changing something for me? Something simple will do.”
Harry spoke first, “What’re you doing here, Sirius?”
Dumbledore glanced at the maze. The creases near his eyes had tightened the longer Draco spoke, and when he looked back down at him, it was quite clear that he believed him. “Very well. I find it impolite to cut our talk short, but it’s important for me to fetch Professor McGonagall and Professor Snape.”
"—I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts—"
, he thought. Draco had been reading way too many romance books to have taken that in a different way.
“Hey!” Cho threw a piece of bread at his nose. Draco flinched. “Where’d you go? I had to call your name like, a million times.”
"You're such a fucking Ravenclaw," Draco interrupted, half-way through a rant about the morality of using Polyjuice Potion.
“I missed your potty mouth,” Potter laughs. They huddled together on the grimy floor for another minute. Then, “We should start heading back. Ron will be waiting.”
On Halloween night, Granger invites him to a ghost’s 500th Deathday party. He attends, obviously, and also brings along Luna so he has someone to complain to the entire night.
Luna insists she needs to ready herself for bed, despite it still being early. Her roommates like to play pranks on her otherwise, like stealing her clothes or hiding her school stuff in random cupboards. It’s nasty business, but Draco knows it’s not his responsibility to intervene. Not yet, anyway. So he went up to bed himself and pulled his diary out. He’s only about half a paragraph in when things turn black.
They launched at Black as a group. Harry went for his chest, while Granger scrambled for their wands. Weasley, with his broken leg, staggered over and stopped Crookshanks from interfering. Draco got a hold of his wand and pointed it at the man. The others followed suit.
Potter hums, knits their fingers together, and drags him through several corridors. They only need to head up one flight of stairs before arriving at the hall, where a few kids that are staying at school are hanging around. Potter makes a beeline towards two students talking with Hagrid near the front, his grip unrelenting in Draco’s hand. “Guys! Look who I found!”
“You’re my best friend, of course, I’ll keep it a secret,” Luna replied. A serious light had entered her eyes like never before. “And I think I’m rather fond of girls myself.”
He nods and swallows it whole. The potion immediately gets to work, making his tongue feel thick and eyes hazy. Draco lays on the thin bed, staring at the white ceiling, and welcomes sleep.
“Jealous? Please. Of what? I’d rather give my entire fortune away than have to suffer being the great Harry Potter for a day.”
Slowly, the students trickled back inside the numerous classrooms of Hogwarts. Draco is one of the few who didn't, because it seemed his feet were glued to the floor. Potter tucks the diary back into his bag and steps closer. "That was you, wasn't it? That stupid poem?"
"Welcome to Divination, my children," the teacher said, clasping her hands together. "My name is Professor Trelawney. You may not have seen me before, as I find that being around the main bustle of the school tends to cloud my Inner Eye."
He can’t place a moment when liking
Word spreads around school that Harry Potter isn’t returning home for the two weeks, either. Rumours are common in the corridors of Hogwarts, and whispers of his rough upbringing have already gone through them. Draco doesn’t want to believe silly gossip, but with the way Potter had been dressed in the robe-shop… Those baggy clothes? And now that he thinks about it, the boy had been far too skinny as well. Draco instantly realises he’s being childish for getting upset over having to stay when other kids have spent entire childhoods with shitty parents.
“Viktor Krum truly asked you to visit him over summer? Scandalous,” Draco whispered, smiling.
“Perhaps, but I can count on one hand the number of accidental magic episodes I had before starting at Hogwarts. Now.” Draco stood suddenly. “Is that all you had to talk about? From what I’ve seen, there isn’t a thing wrong with Teddy.”
“Oh, Draco,” Potter murmured. He grabbed the pillow and smiled sadly at him. “I get dreams too, that I’m sure are real. Perhaps we’re both insane.”
As they bickered, Draco took the time to admire the place. Although, perhaps admire wasn't the right word. He was more sneering at every little decoration, as the interior ranged from age-blackened portraits to a chandelier covered in cobwebs. There was also a terrible stench of piss. "It's disgusting in here. Walburga had house-elves, didn't she?"
Draco rolled his eyes and took a dainty sip of his drink. "I'm planning your untimely demise. What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?"
Draco paused. “What kind of favour?”
“We only sit like that for important things. Like dinner with a governor or something,” Draco explains. He wants to be defensive, which is silly, since they’re just messing around. Still though, it’s his family they’re making fun of, and Draco loves them despite their various faults. “It’s better than slouching.”
So, he spends his morning making a list of who he would be spending his Christmas money on. Potter is at the top, obviously-- his reaction to a singing card will be hilarious. He also buys one for Severus, Luna, and Professor Flitwick. "I think that should do it. Do you have a camera? I would love to immortalise my godfather's face when one of those... troll-baby things come and start serenading him."
By the time break finished, Granger is still hidden away somewhere. Draco guesses it was the Hospital Wing, but could never get a look inside when he walks by. Several weeks passed.
“What happened? Where’s Sirius?”
“I don’t know who that is,” Potter admits. Weasley nods beside him. “And I don’t know who
“Uh, I just wanted to make sure you were okay,” Harry Potter mumbles. “Are you?”
Snape breathed heavily at him, and started walking up the stairs, arms put out in front of him. Draco cursed, and waited, and waited for the inevitable...
Perhaps he could try mediating the situation before it really begins, though. Draco wanders over, and hopes this will work.
“I’m not surprised. What were you thinking, rolling off the bed?”
Umbridge clenched her jaw, narrowing her eyes, before seemingly scribbling an entire paragraph onto her clipboard. Finally, she stepped toward Draco— he held his breath— and shoved a piece of parchment his way. "You will take that to your head of house immediately, thank you."
a drama-free term. When Draco got back to Hogwarts, he quickly realised that Granger's fight with Weasley had gotten worse, as it now seemed to include Potter as well. He'd gotten a Firebolt for Chrismas, only for it to be taken away that same day. Such poor luck. Though, Draco didn't really blame Granger for wanting to turn it in. Potter hasn't had much luck in Quidditch so far, and it very well could be cursed.
Later that afternoon, Draco is leaving Charms class, and discovers he would actually get to watch Potter receive his card. He'd mostly just been planning to hear about it through the school’s grapevine.
“Of course, Father,” Draco lies. He’s secretly rather fond of Hagrid, despite his strange obsession toward magical beasts.
Helga’s soft meows bring him back to sanity, and Draco is out the door a moment later.
The man wanders toward a shelf in the back while Draco goes cross-eyed from staring at the tape measure between his nostrils. “Try this, Mr Malfoy. Hawthorn, and unicorn hair. Ten inches, reasonably flexible.”
Potter's caterpillar eyebrows furrowed. "Then where were you? Hold on, have you been ignoring me? I've been inside this castle all morning, by myself, and you just left me to it?"
He sits with Boot in the corner of the room, only half focussing on the world around him as he daydreams about the comfortable, silk pillows back at Malfoy Manor. He’s tired (though Draco is used to that feeling) and homesick. He almost misses Potter’s grand entrance.
The compartment door slid open with a soft creak, Cho Chang's face appearing behind it. She smiled a little uncomfortably at them all. "Sorry. Is this a bad time? I just wanted to say hi. So, hi."
Draco's breath came out sharp as he looked up and down at the creatures standing between each carriage shaft. They looked like the kind of horses that a dark wizard would want to ride, with their black wings and skeletal bodies. Still gaping, he turned back to see if anyone else was shocked at the sight of them, but it was only Harry who seemed to have noticed their presence at all. "What the fuck are those?"
Hurrying after the horseless carriages which had been preparing to leave, Terry Boot gave him a hand up into one. Draco pulled Luna in right after, who was still going on about Hagrid. "I'm most interested in unicorns, of course. From what I've read they are just the most beautiful creatures."
Draco was actually attending his classes on time, too. Muggle Studies got more interesting with each lesson, along with Arithmancy. Divination was harder to explain. Granger was set on hating it, and Weasley and Potter always treated it like a joke. Trelawney
“You probably deserved it. Ever thought of that?”
"The Goblet of Fire?" Draco said, "I've never heard of that."
"These diaries, I've been writing in them since I was little. I've dated most of them, so you can see that it's been going on awhile. It's one of the reasons why Riddle's diary enticed me so much."
She patted the side of his head and hurried him over to the train door. There was something far too knowing in her gaze. "You're a good boy. Don't lose that."
Tonks' smile widened.
Granger looked between them both. "Why is her dad writing about your cousin? Who's your cousin?"
He pushed his chair backwards, forcing Trelawney to move with it. She hissed questions at him, unconcerned about the students around them. Draco breathed in through his mouth, out through his nose. “What have you seen? What was it? Was it the Grim? What have you seen?”
“Of course,” Severus agrees, and orders one of the other boys to grab it. Soon his mother’s silky Christmas gift is being wrapped around him. It somehow smelt like her. “How do you feel now?”
“They’re the same thi--”
He slumped onto Harry's chest and yawned into the warmth he found there. "I'm just gonna sleep right here. Yes, right here."
(See the end of the chapter for
“Professor,” Draco murmurs, bopping his head slightly. “How are you?”
“Getting the dementors kiss, I expect,” Severus said, blandly.
"You should still be sleeping," Harry murmured, not sparing him a glance.
He seemed to be talking to himself now, so Draco didn’t bother with a response.
, almost killed yourself in the process, all before Riddle drained my life source beyond repair. Should I be thanking you?”
As he backed up and watched the station become a blur of colour through the window, Draco felt winded, but in a pleasant way. He relished in it for a moment, before tuning back into Harry, Granger and Weasley's conversation.
He’s pretty sure there hasn’t been a Malfoy not in Slytherin for years, so it certainly isn’t ideal. Morgana, what will his father say? Probably something about family and expectations that Draco has undoubtedly not met. There’s probably a whole line of Black’s staring at him from their graves in disappointment, too. Yikes. He best start an apology letter as soon as possible.
Severus shouldered pass the man, interrupting his spew of nonsense. Draco hesitated and then did the same. As they walked down the aisle, he saw sleeping witches and wizards, a pair of goblins, and a younger-looking girl with lightning blue hair, and a heart-shaped face. She caught sight of them, and gestured, quite enthusiastically, to the empty seat beside her. After sharing a glance with Sev, who grimaced, Draco took the offer; his godfather not far behind.
At the end of the train ride, Draco let Granger and Weasley leave before blocking Harry from doing so. Something had been bugging him about this whole thing, and it had only occurred to him what it was a minute before.
Draco stretched out along the cushions, belly full and back popping. He briefly considered moving to his bedroom to sleep, but a loud meow from the floor distracted that thought.
The biggest photo has all Draco’s friends waving down at him in it— Hannah, Cho, Astoria and, rather surprisingly, Neville Longbottom. The smallest picture is from the day he’d finished Healer training.
Professor Moody had a real rough, confident voice as if he was always nursing a sore throat. Although, it could've just been a side-effect of constantly yelling, 'CONSTANT VIGILANCE' at them.
Tapping his chin, he thought. Draco went through a mental checklist, and then remembered— "Hold on! Let me just..." and, wrapping his fist around Potter's necklace, Draco said, "Now I have everything. Where are you taking me?"
Finally, blessedly, Potter's hand is ripped from his own. Draco wipes the sweat that had gathered on his palm away. It's quiet for another moment, until Hagrid says, "You three should drop it, anyways. It's none of yeh business on what that dog's guarding."
around?"
Draco was still tying his hair back when he came flying out from the Healer fireplace and onto St Mungo's floor, decidedly more covered in soot than he’d like to be. He ignored any looks he got from colleagues as he began his trek to the ground floor.
Draco gasped, only to realise Diggory wasn't actually looking at him, but something behind him. Again, he turned around, but could see nothing except dark fog and twinkling lights. Then, very suddenly, a harsh, green light snapped through the air and hit Diggory in the chest.
Surprisingly, Weasley answered. “He’s our friend.”
“Well, I had a gross case of a jinx that made an apple tree grow out of a woman’s ear if it’s any consolation. It was making her brain rot.”
From there, the lesson went rather smoothly. This lasted until Lupin decided it was time to actually use their new knowledge and had Draco go up first.
, he thought. They deserved to be concerned. Zabini wasn't about to beat him up just because he has green and silver on his tie. "Can you stop beating around the bush?"
“Sure, but it won’t work.”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He knew what was coming.
The sound of turning pages flipped through the room. Potter grabbed a second notebook and landed on another dream he recognised, “And I suppose this is a coincidence, too? Why didn’t you say you’d dreamed about Riddle before any of it even happened?”
“It won’t come until it is called.”
"Same as you, I expect." Draco wiped the sweat from his forehead, still slightly breathless from his run. "Woke up from all the screaming, and made a break for it. Have any of you seen Luna?"
"No, it wasn't," said Potter. "Draco's a real Seer. Why d'you think he was at Sirius' house for the summer? Voldemort wants him to see into the future, and his slimy dad would've been willing to sacrifice him if Draco hadn't left."
Just then, Cho Chang appeared a couple of seats down. She smiled over at them, pretty in every way that Draco wasn't, and said, "Was that French? You know, I know a little bit as well. My mother has me attend classes in the summer."
Draco thinks, and then remembers Ron and that other girl Potter mentioned. Harmony? Hermione? Whatever. It’s enough to remind him he shouldn’t be hanging around Harry Potter, and again he tries to walk away. Potter catches his arm, though.
"You do need a haircut," she said, reaching over to tuck a fallen lock of white-blonde hair back behind his ear. "Are you trying to grow it out like your father's?"
How embarrassing. Draco wasn’t aware he’d been doing that often enough for the others to notice. It’s just that walking helps him calm down, as he can concentrate solely on getting one foot in front of the other rather than lingering nightmares. “Thank you, Mr Boot. I would suggest getting some last hours of sleep, now. Don’t worry about Mr Malfoy.”
Not even a Floo visit from his mother helped to cheer him up. She'd gotten permission to call and tell him that he was to start having sessions with Terra, his old Mind-Healer, again— apparently all the teachers were getting concerned, mainly Lupin, so it was necessary that he wastes some of his own weekends to 'talk about his feelings'. He hadn't liked these sessions when he was younger, and he definitely wouldn't, now.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Two weeks of detention! What on Earth for?"
His bed is pressed into the corner, with navy-blue sheets and far too many pillows. It’s in this bed that Draco collapsed for the day, feeling as settled as an ex-Death Eater could be with their life.
Potter looked embarrassed. He ran a hand through his perpetually messy hair, avoiding Draco’s eye. “It’s not any different to usual.”
Draco slowly backed away. He had a feeling if any of them caught him eavesdropping, he'd be getting the blame next. It would even add up in their eyes— "The boy's father must've taught him the spell!" he imagined Crouch's cold voice saying. "Oh, yes, the evidence is all there!"
In the fridge, there’s some leftover spaghetti and a bar of chocolate that Cho must’ve brought over the last she visited. “Bless you, Chang,” he murmured, grabbing both the pasta and chocolate to eat. Draco closed the fridge door with his ankle and struggled off in the direction of the living room.
"Knew you'd be familiar," Moody said. He grabbed another spider, held it tightly in his callous hands, and pointed his wand at it. "Imperio!"
They seem fidgety the whole evening. When Draco asks Weasley to pass him the pot of gravy, he flinches and spills it all over his own plate of food. Very strange. Very strange, indeed.
“It’s your birth month’s flower, according to Hermione. Whatever
"No! I just never got around to cutting it. I don't think that's it, though. Look around! I feel like everyone is scared of me or something."
Dumbledore stood up at the front of the hall, smiling around at them all. "So!" he said, "Now that we are all fed and watered, I must once more ask for your attention, while I give out a few notices—"
“My dear, it has been obvious ever since you stepped foot in this classroom that you do not have what it takes to be successful in the noble art of Divination,” Trelawney said, her wide eyes glaring down at Hermione. “And frankly, I don’t ever remember a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.”
A few minutes later, Draco looked up to see the door opening, and four adults coming in. He shoved Potter underneath the table. "Stop squirming you idiot! The teachers are here, and... And the Minister?"
Five minutes later, Draco gapes openly at Potter. “Okay, wait. I need to recap. You killed the basilisk, got rid of the Dark Lord
Only one door was open. As the three stepped closer to it, a pained moan and loud purring came from inside. Draco hardened his jaw, swallowed any fears, and went first.
"Fuck, fuck, fucking-fuckity-fuck."
Draco blanks. What? “I’m afraid I don’t entirely understand, Mr Lupin.”
“Colin Creevey…” Draco murmurs, listening to the Ravenclaw table gossip about the incident. “That sounds familiar. Have we met him?”
He grabbed a jacket from the floor, and tucked his wand inside one of the pockets. A crash sounded somewhere nearby. Draco steeled himself and ran right into the chaos. Immediately, he was swallowed by a crowd of terrified people.
He ignored him. Zabini was terribly rude and had done all sorts of cruel things over the years. Draco doubted he'd ever forgive the guy for trying to have Buckbeak executed the previous year. "So. You actually like history, then?"
Draco walked away.
He stuck his wand out in front of him, leaving it hanging for hardly a second before bringing it back to his side. The Knight Bus arrived a short wait later.
“Er,” the boy says, as Draco continues scrutinising him. “Hi?”
Granger made a strangled noise. The students nearby had gone quiet to listen. Draco's cheeks began to feel very, very warm.
Wisely, he didn't say that part out loud. Potter seemed a bit annoyed at being excused so quickly, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to care. The faster Potter was out of his office, the faster he could get on with his life and pretend this stupid crush had never existed.
Finally, lunch arrived. Draco’s feet were sore from walking around so much, and he’s not sure he could listen to another case of Accidental Magic even if it killed him.
Potter notices Draco immediately.
“Neville kept forgetting the passwords, so he wrote them all down. Black got a hold of them,” Potter went on. “I think you were right about what you said months ago; about something deep inside the guy being wrong. He’s come all this way, but somehow mixed up the beds?”
He nods.
"We'll take the Knight Bus. I'm not entirely convinced on its anonymity, but we can't exactly fly to London on broomsticks, and the Floo network is a no-go, as the place we're going doesn't have an open Floo. Hurry up, Draco, we don't have till Christmas!"
Potter props him against a wall, careful not to jostle him too much. Meanwhile, Lockhart began asking increasingly ridiculous questions that had them all snorting.
"It's Mad-Eye Moody!" Padma Patil replied.
“Nicholas Flamel has got the only known recipe for the elixir of life,” Draco says, talking before his courage can waver. Their heads whip toward him. Granger’s face does something strange. “I’d guess he would be around seven-hundred years old by now. I think he’s living with his wife in Devon.”
“Chicken?” said Sirius, pulling the newspapers from his mouth. All of them tugged open their bags and revealed drumsticks and bread inside. Draco had nicked his own horde at dinner the previous night. “Thanks. I’ve had to rely on rats, mostly. This is a welcome change.”
"What do you want, Zabini?" asked Draco.
He thought about his dreams, the ones that showed him battles and death. They were scary, sure, but not his greatest fear. Perhaps a snake, then. Draco definitely didn't like those much, especially after last year. Although, that man could show up— the one with the scarlet eyes and paper skin. No, that wouldn’t happen. Surely. Draco would just settle with, "A basilisk, sir."
Draco stared down at his expensive shoes. "It takes away the victim's free-will, and gives total control to the castor."
Somehow, Draco knew exactly how this was conversation was going to go if nobody stepped in.
The next few days were ones that Draco lived through with great pride. Harry seemed much happier with Weasley back on his side, and the first task over with. This lasted up until the Yule Ball was announced, and suddenly both Harry and Weasley were worrying about who to bring. Draco had immediately asked Luna, who agreed, under the condition that they only danced to two songs. Apparently, she wasn't a fan of dancing. Draco agreed, because it was better than going on his own.
"What are you two gossiping about?" said Weasley, whose parchment was bare of any predictions.
“Hello.” Her tone is dreamy. “Are you waiting for anybody?”
. He rushes toward Luna, who also looks pleased with the display.
The man had his usual cloak pulled over a blue nightshirt, and immediately noticed Draco lurking behind him in the corridor. For a terrifying moment, all they did was stare at each other, until Moody said, "What are you doing out of bed?"
Harry’s hands tighten into angry fists. “You’re really that blind? Snape is a horrible person. Do you know what he did to me in my first potions class? He insulted me, badgered me with questions that almost no one in the room could answer. I didn’t even know I was a wizard before last year, let alone the difference between stupid monkshood and wolfsbane!”
The castle had stood tall in the late evening, looming over all of them with its lit-up windows and flickering shadows. A Weasley boy accidentally knocked into him and muttered an apology. Everyone went in. It all goes a bit iffy for Draco after that. He remembers pacing up and down through the throng of first-years, and the hat might’ve whispered something about the ‘potential’ for wisdom when Professor McGonagall placed it on his head. That’s when the dreaded shout of, “RAVENCLAW!” filled the Great Hall. His ears were still ringing.
Immediately she levitates him toward one of the beds, Potter and Weasley quickly following. “What a mess! What a mess! Someone go fetch Minerva, she’ll be in her office.”
"That's right."
So now he’s stuck here, in a dorm with lame roommates and realistic stars magicked to the walls. He stares angrily at his bed, and the blue on the sheets seems so much more significant now that it stains everything around him. A light breeze flies through from the open window, which reminds Draco how bloody high they were situated. Ravenclaw’s common room just
“What a night it has been,” a new voice announces after the commotion has finally died. Professor Dumbledore stands at the foot of Draco’s bed. He claps his hands together. “Harry, Ron, it’s time I talked with you both. Young Mr Malfoy, I’ll come by tomorrow morning, yes?”
“Who is
“Hold your tongue, boy.”
"He's a useless old fool." Severus hurried them further inside, and let the door fall shut. For a moment, they faced each other in silence. Then, "I've told your mother you'll be spending the rest of your summer with that Luna girl. She wasn't happy, of course, but had no reason to forbid it."
The main girl laughed again and waved him goodbye. As Draco walked on, he thought he heard her say, "Joli garçon, terrible français!"
Weasley’s rant stopped. He was staring over Potter’s shoulder, mouth dropped open in a comical O. Draco spun around, and with a lasting bang, the door snapped shut. A man emerged from the shadows, black hair grew out to his elbows, and arms so thin they looked like they belonged on a corpse. Worst of all, he was grinning.
Perhaps it was Granger who needed glasses, not Potter. Luna didn’t even look
Draco decided, and promptly forget to. He’s been doing that a lot lately; forgetting.
“It’s probably just a simple jinx. Anyway, thanks for this, Healer Malfoy. See you for dinner tomorrow night!”
"What's the—?"
"Luna's birthday," he answered, throwing the pearls in the direction of the garbage pile. "I always give her the worst presents, so I've started planning earlier. Last year, I bought her birthday present with her Christmas ones!"
Holding up a hand, Draco says, “Stop right there! I don’t think we can talk about it.”
“That’s just plain rude,” he says belatedly. They were closer to the Great Hall now. “What, because my father did a few bad things in the past means he’ll do bad things again? Such disrespect! And anyway, the Malfoy’s would never be caught dead mixing with Slytherin blood, so how would he have opened it? It’s like, all incest-y and stuff.”
It was
Draco paid her and shrunk the cat food when she handed it over, stowing it in one of his coat pockets. “Thanks.”
Resisting the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose, Draco wondered what it was that he’d found so endearing about this awkward man back at Hogwarts. His bravery? His tendency to assume anything Draco associated himself with was evil?
He turned and revealed three jars sat on his desk. Each one had a spider inside. Moody waved his wand, and the one in the middle grew larger and larger, till it was about the size of a small dog. "Pay attention. This curse was very popular at one point in the War..."
Falling asleep that night had been like dipping his head into a Pensieve-- or, at least, what Draco guessed it felt like. As if he was an outsider looking into something private.
knowledgeable on the subject, you know. He even looked after a three-headed dog last year. Yes, Father, maybe you’re right. I don’t need the book at all.”
He pointed his wand at the last spider, and said with a tone of finality, "Avada Kedavra!"
draco malfoy, ladies and gentlemen...
The Welcoming Feast was a busy affair. The Beauxbatons students— six girls, six boys— quickly took residence at the Ravenclaw table, much to Draco's annoyance. Word about his ability to speak French had gotten around the school, and as such everyone expected him to translate for the students who hadn't bothered with learning too much English. This was a tedious task, as the girls spoke in such high-pitched tones, and the boys all got distracted so easily, he had to listen very hard to understand half of what they were saying. Terry eventually put a stop to it, by waxing poetry about Viktor Krum.
Tom Riddle, Draco notices then, is twirling a familiar wand between his pale fingers. He doesn’t give it back to Potter. His grins broadens as he murmurs, “You won’t be needing it.”
A dozen hands were shoved into the air, including Draco's own. He may have been freaked out by the man, but he wasn't about to miss out on potential house points ... Moody's magic eye darted around the room, before landing on Anthony Goldstein's outstretched palm. "You, boy?"
“Buckbeak,” said Granger, and bowed low at the creature. Harry and Weasley did the same and encouraged Draco to, as well. He did so, a little nervously, and internally took back ever wanting to be in Hagrid’s class. Magical animals were all so awful.
The three of them crept forward slowly, wands raised in front of them. They emerged inside a dusty, disordered room. Draco instantly recognised it.
Standing and tapping at the window is a giant of a man, with a tangled beard and messy brown hair that hides half his face. His eyes, however, are small and kind compared to the rest of him. The man is smiling at Green-Eyes and gesturing at two ice-creams in his hands in a way that Draco supposes means he isn’t allowed inside.
“Alrighty, then. Yeh hear that, Ernie? Another one for Diagon!”
The relief of having Harry permanently in the house quickly fizzled out by the time his trial came around, though. Draco left Regulus' room early one morning to find Harry sat at the eating table, a plate of toast untouched before him. The sight of him sent a flutter of worry to tiptoe around his stomach. "Hey."
“If Diggory had to rescue Cho... and Fleur was supposed to get her sister...”
He narrows his eyes. “Then it’ll be for the greater good.”
? That time he disguised himself as a house-elf for a super dangerous, top-secret Auror mission. Obviously. Alas, Draco only got one thing right.
Grumbling the entire time, Draco walked the short distance from the front door to the kitchen, absently flicking his wand so his hair magically falls from its ponytail and across his shoulders.
The result was instantaneous. Karkaroff snapped out of his weird, Potter-induced daze, and quickly lead his students out of the hall. The Gryffindor's left next, with Draco and the Ravenclaw's just behind. They all hurried up to the Ravenclaw tower, eager to talk late into the night about possible champions for Hogwarts. He privately hoped it would be a Slytherin, just to see the looks on everybody's faces.
“Why? Because you pathetically refuse to let go of some rivalry from your childhood? And now you’re letting it dictate the fate of an innocent man. What. Is. Wrong. With you?”
"It's been great getting to know you, Draco," said Tonks. She was disguised as an old lady today, a hideous purple hat placed over her grey hair. "Just wish it was under better circumstances, yeah?"
He isn’t sure what to say to that, so he settles with nothing at all.
“Oh yeah, terribly wounded,” Draco says dramatically. He shimmies further into the blankets. Harry smiles. “Only kidding. I should be fine for Astronomy tonight.”
Draco pulled out his potion as an explanation. Snape responded with the tiniest nod.
Madam Malkin was friendly enough, aiming different fabrics over his head and humming whatever tune is stuck in her as she works. Draco normally can just ignore her, and be done with it in a couple of minutes-- not on days like these, though.
"As I was saying," Dumbledore continued, nonplussed. "Hogwarts has been given the honour to host a very important event over the coming months. It is my great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts over the coming months."
He woke at the usual early hour and donned his lime-green robes, using a Cleaning Charm for his teeth to save time.
Potter held his arms up, grinning. A second later, Granger and Weasley appeared by the door. Their injuries had all healed, and both looked almost entirely back to normal, except for the secretive twinkle in each of their eyes. The four of them had a secret now, and it’s brought them closer together. “You don’t mind if we join you, Malfoy?”
The dreams had become stronger over the last year. They weren’t so much flashes anymore, they were more like scenes from a play or something, and Draco was watching from the audience. And, by that analogy, the green-eyed boy was kind of the main character.
“Not that you have to, of course,” Harry interrupts. “It’s your decision.”
“Oh?” Draco replied, knowing very well what he meant. Some of those entries talked about his dreams of Potter’s adventures, well before they’d even met. “I have no idea what you mean.”
Draco wasn’t going to deny it. He screamed. Sirius Black’s grey eyes were familiar and filled with satisfaction.
"I don't give two shits what your latest gossip is."
The evening of the third task came with a sense of foreboding. Draco headed for the grounds quite unwillingly, hands shaking and head hurting as he tried to think about why everything inside him was screaming to turn the other way. He found a seat with Luna at the bottom of the stands, practically already in tears. The moon sat at the bottom of the sky in the distance, waiting for its signal to come up. Draco, briefly, remembered that night so many months ago, when he had found the moon comforting. Now, it was anything but.
“This probably doesn’t help, but it’s good that Teddy’s magic is so out-of-control at the moment. It’s been widely established in the wizarding community that children with more bouts of accidental magic tend to have stronger control over their magic in later years,” Draco said slowly. “I mean, think about your childhood. I’m sure you can remember many incidents where your magic went ‘haywire’ as you put it.”
She tilted her head at Draco.
In the afternoon, all of them started emptying out the glass-fronted cabinets to the floor and gathered up the items they found inside. Nothing they found seemed particularly keen to move, which became the most obvious when Black suffered a bite from a silver snuff-box, which made his hand look like a tough, brown glove. There was also a box that issued a slow, pleasing melody which Draco realised was making them all sleepy, and promptly shut; a locket that forced a shadow of a ruby-encrusted sword flash in his mind; and a spider-like thing that crawled up Harry's arm in an attempt to puncture his skin, until Black slammed it with a book on Wizarding Genealogy.
He brought his wand to the bathroom with him, mostly out of habit, and undressed. The water is given time to warm up as his enchanted mirror winks lewdly at him.
"That hardly helps. I doubt you even wore earrings at the Yule Ball last year," said Draco, not unkindly.
She tilted her head at him. "If you say so, child. Now, do you have anything specific you'd like to talk about? Your dreams? Girls, perhaps?"
They left the room, ignoring Septimus' indignant shouts of kidnapping. When Severus replied, he spoke in a hushed tone, as if he didn't want any other portraits to overhear. "The Dark Lord may want Lucius to hand you over soon, what with... Well." He coughed. "So, Dumbledore arranged for you to be moved to a place where neither of them will think, or be able to look. Some of the Order doubt you'll be at the top of You-Know-Who's list of priorities, though, so don't get too worried."
Ollivander disappears to the back and returns a beat later. “I haven’t sold a wand with this wood since I took over the shop, but perhaps…” He passes it over.
Abruptly, Potter stops. Draco doesn’t notice and continues walking. “So no, my father would never-- Potter? Are you alright?”
Draco couldn't. He grabs the diary's spine and holds on.
Harry spent the next day inside the Hospital Wing, along with the real Mad-Eye Moody. Mrs Weasley, her eldest son, Ron, Granger and Draco stayed with him the entire time. Even if Pomfrey had wanted them to leave, none of them would’ve budged.
’ on the train when a blonde girl slides open the compartment door. Her silver eyes burn into his own.
Lucius turns back to the man and raises a perfectly unamused, blond brow. “I’m afraid I haven’t, Borgin, though I am tempted to if you use that tone on me again.” Both sneer at one another. “However, I
Mrs Weasley's efforts to hug each of them became more frantic as the train whistled overhead, urging the students still on the platform to hurry up. She was looking teary-eyed. "Stay out of trouble! If you've forgotten anything, we can owl it over... Ginny, please write to us weekly..."
He grimaced, fleeing, and prayed that Luna was searching for him as desperately as Draco was her.
“She’s the best,” Draco adds.
"Ooo, aren't you tough?" said Septimus, and Draco imagined the man waving his little walking stick around. "Don't you dare open that door! There are the darkest artefacts hidden in there..."
Whispering breaks out among the class. Snape glares at them over Draco’s shoulder and they shut up. “It’s urgent, sir. You don’t understand.”
It’s obvious he has won when Lucius’ eyes widen in horror at the mention of Hagrid’s pet. Draco may have blue and bronze on his uniform, but he was still a Slytherin at heart. When you grow up around snakes, you pick up a few tricks.
Potter is stuffing a pile of Lockhart’s books into a redheaded girl’s cauldron, and she is quite flustered by it.
He shook his head. "Not yet. I've got her for Defence tomorrow morning, though."
The boy grins, moves to reply, but then Madam Malkin taps him on the shoulder to say, “That’s you done, sweetie.” She pulls off his new set of robes off him, and the boy ends up having to settle on shooting a small, almost secretive smile at Draco.
"How can you not know?" hissed Draco, glaring at Harry. "You take Care of Magical Creatures, don't you? Surely they've appeared in... in a textbook or, or... Fuck, I know what they are. But why can I—?"
The bus gave a sudden lurch, and both Draco and Tonks fell off their seats and onto the sticky floor. He had just gotten up again when the bus turned, and he was right back down. "D'you reckon our clumsiness was inherited?" Tonks yelled over the increasingly loud complaints of the other passengers.
"Ah. Is your face always wet with tears, too?"
Sirius flicked a fallen piece of silky hair behind his ear. "Cause I knew her mother. She was always my favourite cousin. Yours, however..."
Red sparks flew through the air in the distance. Draco narrowed his eyes. Perhaps they had caught whoever conjured the Mark, although he doubted the culprit had stayed to watch. He crept forward until he was close enough as he dared, and crouched behind a bush to listen.
"Meet our newest staff member, Professor Moody," Dumbledore said into the silence. "He will be teaching DADA."
Draco fluttered his eyelashes at Granger. “If that part is true, have you really been using Love Potions?”
The boy made a strange face at the sound of his name. Draco mentally filed the moment away, so he’d remember not to use the name again.
“It’s amazing, Harry,” Draco says, not even noticing his use of Potter’s last name. It only seems fair-- Harry has shown him something personal; something risky. Wizards worse than Draco would try to steal it. “Who gave it to you?”
"Stupid— fucking— book," he muttered and threw it in the direction of his bed. It landed just short, and fell to the floor. He rolled his eyes, not bothering to go and pick it up.
"No! Of course not! I was— I was doing something. Away from the castle. My, er, mother has taken ill, and I went to visit her."
Draco stared at her, thinking of his own mother's curt farewells every September. "Thank you for looking after me, Mrs Weasley."
“That Fleur Delacour girl kissed us,” Harry explained. “Um. On the cheek, I mean. She was very grateful for us helping her sister.”
Draco blinked and watched her disappear down the corridor that he assumed she’d come from. Looking down, he began reading through the clipboard’s notes—
“Expelliarmus!” Black shouted. His voice was dry. Draco, hysterically, wondered if he should offer the man a glass of water. Three wands flew into his hands. “I knew you’d come and help your friend, Harry. It’s what your father would’ve done for me.”
Potter stared at him, silent. Draco fell back onto his bed and pulled a pillow over his face. “Suffocate me, please. I’d rather not exist, anymore.”
When Saturday dawned on them, the sun was weak and not particularly helpful, so Draco pulled a thin cloak over his shoulders and hoped it wouldn’t rain. He’d spent the night before explaining to Luna that he wasn’t abandoning her, just running an errand. She knew he was going to spend the day with Harry though, and didn’t need much convincing.
"Nevermind her," said Ginny, pulling out her wand. "We can clean this up easy.
"You heard me, Malfoy. If we date, we can graduate Hogwarts with some experience under our belts. This is a chance of a lifetime, there aren't any other boys who would be up to your parent's standards."
Draco, of course, already knew what these notices would be about. Still, he placed his chin in his hand and listened.
“Auror Potter,” he said after a moment and moved aside to allow him in. Potter entered his office cautiously.
“Of course!”
“It’s really, really important.” Draco stared at Dumbledore and allowed all his desperation to enter his face. It worked immediately. Maxime shut up, looking concerned herself, and the other men avoided his eye. “Please, Professor.”
Trelawney nodded, seeming disgruntled. Draco felt something roar inside him, like pity for Trelawney. It disappeared after a second.
He disappears without waiting for a response. Potter gives his hand one last squeeze before going after him. Weasley waves a quick goodbye too.
Draco, as he avoids the judging eyes of his peers, notices his father doing something strange. Sure, he shoves Ginny’s tattered book back at her, but there’s a second, thinner book tucked underneath it. It resembled the diaries Draco stored beneath his bed-- leatherbound, with brown paper like it was old.
Before the year started, Snape had given him a note that would allow Draco to visit Madam Pomfrey in the night without getting in trouble for sneaking around past midnight— mostly due to his mother's insistence. Draco hadn't wanted to use it, but on one particularly restless night in January, he crept out of his dormitory and headed for the Hospital Wing, note held tightly in his hand.
Sometimes, Draco wished he had never befriended Harry Potter, simply so he wouldn’t have to get caught up in the inevitable drama that came with each year.
A moment later, a heavy body jumped onto his lap and scratched at his chest. “That hurts, you blasted cat,” said Draco quietly, running a hand through her ginger fur. Helga relaxed immediately, even letting out a long purr. “Always so spoiled, aren’t you?”
“You probably won’t believe,” Potter opens with-- a promising start (not). “But I swear it’s true. And it only got weirder that night I had to spend at the Hospital Wing after the game.”
“Can we go flying, now?” Teddy chimed, tugging at the bottom of Potter’s Muggle shirt. Draco looked away. “Come on! I’m all better!”
“One of those Ravenclaw boys. The half-blood,” Severus explains. “I’d been on hall duty and he came running down, yelling about you having some kind of fit.”
"Well, if you get home from your family thing early, you can spend some time with Harry. He's not going, either."
A group of Ministry workers surrounded Harry, Granger, and Weasley, their wands tilted down at the three.
? No!” Potter says quickly. His eyes are green and pretty in the early afternoon sun.
He melts into the gathering crowd starting to circle around them. As he runs, Draco notices Professor Lockhart making his way over, which only strengthens his resolve to avoid Potter at
"You 'Ogwarts type are so uneducated!" a girl who had introduced herself as Fleur Delacour said. She had silvery blonde hair and was attracting a lot of attention. "At Beauxbatons, we are taught all about ze Goblet of Fire! Pah! And your French, eet is worse than my Eenglish!"
Draco decided it’s time for him and Luna to go. Any respectable Malfoy knows to never stay till the end of the party-- the key was to leave sometime in the middle, to successfully make an appearance and consequently not create drama, but to avoid still being there when people started getting drunk.
Draco didn’t have to think before hugging each of them in turn. “I thought you were all dead!”
A silence similar to the ones from their awkward robe-shop encounter occurs, then. Draco’s social skills have improved somewhat, so he has half an idea on how to proceed this time. “How’s Hagrid?”
Draco wishes he hadn’t asked to be part of this. He wants to go back to Malfoy Manor and pretend he’s not a Ravenclaw yet, pretend there’s still hope for his Slytherin qualities to win out. He wants to cuddle with his mother while Father reads books to them, the sun slowly setting to give the moon an opportunity to glow. Draco yearns to be small and stupid and not have to deal with any of this. He never should’ve fucking asked.
They abandoned his search for chocolate frogs and found a compartment with Boot and Corner, quickly joining a conversation about whether Arithmancy would be a better class than Ancient Runes. (Luna opened up the latest Quibbler, instead.) Draco must have fallen asleep at some point because when he woke up it much was darker outside the window, and colder inside the train.
"You've got no right to talk to me like that, Malfoy," said Sirius, "If I had any say in it, I wouldn't even let you stay here. You're just lucky Dumbledore thinks you're important enough to protect."
“Are you alright?”
"Oh? What eez her name?"
Umbridge found herself a seat on a cushioned sofa near Trelawney's desk, and sat down ramrod straight in it, waiting for the class to begin. Trelawney, with a small shake in her movements, clapped her hands together. "Today, we'll be continuing our study of prophetic dreams. Split up into pairs please, and interpret each other's latest nighttime visions with the help of your Oracle books."
He grumbled under his breath and sped-up his pace.
He fell into the mountain of pillows with a satisfied sigh and uses a simple heating charm so the food is no longer grossly cold. Draco ate it with total abandon, and can easily picture how his father would react if the old man was still around.
, he thinks, not quite nastily.
“Er,” the boy says, shy, as Draco continued to scrutinise him. “Hi.”
much like him. She lacks all the Pureblood traits that Malfoy’s have spent endless decades working on, as well as most of the Black attributes from his mother’s side. “I’ve known her less than ten minutes, Granger.”
“That’s quite enough,” a new voice murmured. Draco blinked and watched Dumbledore take a step between them, like a shield. “Severus, I believe the Minister wishes to speak with you about tonight’s events. Mr Malfoy, walk with me.”
When they spotted Draco, one of the girls asked, "Avez-vous vu Madame Maxime? Nous l'avons perdue—"
Granger seemed confident in her statement. Draco was too lazy to defend himself.
She squeezed her eyes shut, scrunched up her nose, and all-around just looked to be in pain. Slowly, her blue hair faded into a silvery grey, and her face created wrinkles from seemingly thin air. Draco, gaping, said, "You're a Metamorphmagus?"
“It’s rude to walk away, you know.” Astoria grabbed onto his arm, halting his steps. He scowled and pulled away, ignoring the narrowed eyes that glared at him in response. “Could you just do me a favour?”
tell me how to send one."
"Merci," Cho said and turned around to face her friends, again.
Taking his usual seat in the darkest corner, Draco pulled out his copy of A History of Magic and began to flick through it. The Goblin Rebellions, combined with Professor Binn's terrible teaching was almost enough to put him off of the subject, but being able to read ahead made it much more interesting. He knew in sixth-year, they would learn about wand-lore, which surely would turn out to be better than what they were doing now. Truthfully, anything would be better than what they were doing, now.
Quietly, they moved out into the hall and took the stairs up onto the second floor. Draco was afraid one of the floorboards would creak and that evil man would jump out, blasting them with green light.
“You’re always so mean to me,” Draco replied, feigning a wounded expression. Patil made a tutting sound. “How much?”
Draco is just finishing a chapter in ‘
Wizards of all ages rushed past, yelling obscenities. He cursed himself and then stepped back inside. The tent was large, overly so, and empty. Lucius had disappeared sometime during the night, and his mother had run off somewhere as soon as the attack started, leaving Draco on his own.
Harry hummed and scribbled something down on his parchment. Draco went to continue, but Umbridge was talking to Trelawney rather loudly, and it was impossible to not hear them. "You're great-great-grandmother was the celebrated Seer, Cassandra Trelawney, correct?"
"I wouldn't bet on that," Draco said, nervous. He stood up and then crouched down on the ground. He reached his hand under the bed as far as he could manage and pulled out a pile of notebooks. Each one was filled with careful recounts of almost every dream he'd ever had. As well as other things; things that Potter most certainly could not hear about. "When I was eight, I started getting these... dreams. They were really bad, so my parents started taking me to therapy sessions. I stopped going after a while, but with all the dementors being at Hogwarts, I've had to start going again. That's where I was today.
Dumbledore murmured something to the newcomer, which made him nod his head. They shook hands, and then the man was moving over to the empty seat which the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher usually sat in.
“Surely eet can wait till after ze task, little boy,” Madam Maxime said, when Dumbledore failed to reply.
Draco, belatedly, shook the offered hand.
And before Potter, Granger or even Weasley could call out, Draco runs. (He means Ron, by the way. There are so many of them, he’s not yet sure how to make the distinction in his head.)
“Sell?” Borkin chokes on a gross laugh. He pushes away the box Lucius had placed on his counter and says, “I don’t do business with you anymore, Malfoy. You’re either buying or leaving. Whether it’s at your own will or not doesn’t matter to me.”
Severus had said. This has stupid written all over it though, and Potter’s grip on him isn’t relenting anytime soon. Maybe, if-- “Professor Snape already knows who Nicholas Flamel is.”
“Me, too.”
“You just did, but sure.”
“Oh, no. I’m such an idiot,” Draco says. A memory surfaces in his mind, from before the school year started. That awful dream had had the answer in front of him all along.
Draco crosses his arms. “Because - because it’s all ridiculous. Severus isn’t like that. He’s not
With that horrifying sentence, Moody pointed his wand at the enlarged spider and muttered, "Crucio!"
“The Daily Prophet would be in chaos if they heard you say that.”
Draco didn't really like the sound of that. He wasn't a fan of anything that seemed sentient after last year. "Maybe you should have McGonagall look at it."
Fleur blinked at him, and then said to her friend, "What eez wrong with the little boy?"
Weasley and Harry showed up with the Patil sisters. Both couples looked supremely uncomfortable, which set both Draco and Luna into another fit of giggles.
He was dead.
Severus answers his knocking with a bored frown. He raises an eyebrow at the sight of Draco. “Are you supposed to be up?”
A new thought occurs to him as he looks at his surroundings. “Are we in the fucking Chamber of Secrets right now? Ugh, it’s disgusting.”
“What? But they’ve got the wrong man!”
The village turned out lovely. Draco spent his first hour wandering into shops to find things he could buy for Luna's Christmas present. Just as he'd been deciding whether she'd prefer a box of Jelly Slugs or some Peppermint Toads, Potter's head popped up beside him.
Draco decides to sit alone on the train back to London. He leans his head against the window, staring at the blur of scenery outside. Students near his compartment run up and down the narrow corridor, laughing and making early farewells. That tinge in his chest, which he felt on his first day at Hogwarts, comes back. It has him wiping away tears.
Draco had no qualms getting rid of the Dark stuff, but privately thought it was a waste to throw out everything else, as well. Just because Sirius had bad memories of the place didn't mean the heirlooms were any less valuable... So, he didn't fault Kreacher for sneaking around and trying to grab a few things.
Draco shivered dramatically. "I don't like that one..."
A third attack— a double attack. Sure, ghosts can't technically die twice, but Draco didn't know how they’re supposed to heal something that they can't touch. Plus there's that Hufflepuff boy, who he's sure Potter has mentioned in passing before.
Granger throws her head back and cackles, though he isn’t joking. Vampires are amazing; he’d thought so since his mother read Dracula to him for the first time.
They entered the warm Inn. Potter was right— Weasley and Granger were sat at a table near the back, sipping on Butterbeer. They headed over.
She disappeared, again.
“Healer Malfoy.”
Harry spent a long time working up the nerve to ask Cho, only to be rejected. Draco wasn't all that surprised about her already going with Diggory, as they'd been flirting with each other for months.
"So, what? I'm not meant to go to Hogsmeade without a permission slip signed, yet I still went, anyway."
He grinned.
Something worse than the shadows passed by their door, making loud wheezing sounds as it moved down the train. It was like somebody had taken Draco's very soul, and pulled apart the fickle joy which had gathered there over the summer. He had to blink away the tears that began to gather in his eyes.
Draco wanted to curse him. "You're mad! What would Potter be doing out of bed? You know I was getting my potion, or do you think I was lying about that?"
"I know what you act like when you're lying, Draco."
"Like if you were alright?" Zabini said. "Yes, I can see how I overstepped, now." There was a hint of amusement and sarcasm in his tone. "My sincerest apologies."
"I don't understand, sir?"
Some time later, six people come running in. He’s relieved to recognise two of them as his parents, while the others take another second to remember. Severus, McGonagall, Flitwick and Weasley crowd around the bed.
"Oh, right. Oui, oui!" He grabbed the gravy for her and handed it over.
“I didn’t.”
Draco despised Harry Potter, and whoever else decided it was a good idea for a second-year with practically
been starting to think the day was going better than expected.
“I was getting to that.” Draco pulled a chair from the corner of the room and dropped into it, crossing his legs. “A child his age rarely has much control over their magic, so I’d guess it’s a simple incident of accidental magic— but in reverse. Perhaps Teddy was feeling a bit stressed from the number of guests, and his abilities reacted accordingly. If the problem persists, I can prescribe some Calming Draughts. But, for now, I recommend for him to get some sleep and to avoid any crowds.”
Once more, Draco waves the wand around and again, nothing happens.
Zabini raised a neatly-shaped eyebrow. "I was just going to ask if you've been with anyone."
. A dash of sauce dripped down his chin that he only wiped off when he’s done.
“Er, I didn’t check.”
Then, as if somebody had simply needed to flick their wand, light surrounded them again. Draco's breathing came a little easier.
“Are you saying whoever cast the Dark Mark stole Harry’s wand in the Top Box?”
, inside of a seemingly destroyed stairwell. “Nothing! I saw nothing!”
Draco chews on his bottom lip and trails after him. “I’m not sulking,” he argues. “But I thought we were going to buy my school books today, not get rid of a bunch of garbage you’re unnaturally attached to.”
The stranger who had spoken let out a wince of his own, "Sorry. I wasn't thinking. You just looked so..."
"I'll take that as a no..."
“Things are changing, darling,” she whispered into his hair. “Things are changing for the worse.”
“Malfoy, wake up!”
The afternoon before his roommates are to leave is also the afternoon that Severus finally speaks to him outside of class. The man has always been rather cold with Draco-- except for that year his nightmares were especially bad-- so he’s unsure of how the interaction will go. Probably not great, considering Severus doesn’t even care enough to acknowledge him during Potions. Sometimes he wonders why his parents made Sev his godfather in the first place.
At the station, his mother murmured a short farewell before Disapparating. Draco sighed, and half-carried/half-dragged his suitcase up onto the train. It was heavier than usual, with the dress-robes he'd had to bring, and some extra books for History of Magic, which he'd taken a newfound liking to during the holidays. Professor Binns would likely have him lose interest all over again with his droning lectures, but for now, it was interesting enough.
”I’m sorry you have to go back to those Muggles.”
Only two of the boys are in the five-person dormitory, sitting upright in their beds and chatting. Draco collapses on his own blue canopy without care and ends up slipping right off. “Fuck.”
"Professor Snape and I heard noises, Professor," Filch explained. He noticed Draco. "A student out of bed!"
“Sure did,” Hagrid says. “All by myself.”
“No,” the voice says. It’s Terry, Draco realises. Sweet, kind Terry. “Well, sometimes he wakes me up cause I can hear him like, pacing in the middle of the night, but nothing this… bad.”
"Um... What secret?"
Breakfast is a tense affair. Draco can tell all of his housemates have already decided not to bother with him, which makes his chest tinge a little with hurt. No matter, though. He’s above these nerds - he’s a Malfoy.
In the cafeteria, he found and lined up with Cho for food. Her black hair is cut shorter than the last time they spoke, and when she smiles Draco realised with a jolt that it’s been over two weeks since they properly spoke.
He feels himself flush. The other boy, Michael Corner, joins in, then. “I always thought Pureblood families would sit like this.” He makes his back go grossly straight and tucks his hands into his lap as if they were doing a family portrait. Draco rolls his eyes. “Obviously I was wrong.”
Pomfrey kicked them out then, so they continued speaking outside. “But I’ve just told you he didn’t kill anyone! It was all Pettigrew!”
“That’s very progressive of her,” Draco agrees, thinking of his own father’s long hair and excessive ring collection. He can also recognise an olive branch when he sees one. The necklace is meant to make up for all those things they’d said to each other-- and it does, in a way, because it proves Potter is willing to make an effort. “Why the rose though?”
"What's Looney Lovegood wearing?"
“You never told us your mum was barmy, Malfoy,” Weasley murmurs just for him to hear. It chokes a dry laugh from him.
“Are you insane, Potter?” he mutters into his neck. “You all of all people should know I don’t do hugs!”
“Hey! I’ve been meaning to write…”
"Don't look so sad, Draco, the dementors aren't going to hurt you." Luna pulled him up, hand still holding his. "How about we get some chocolate frogs? I know you missed out earlier, and those always cheer you up."
He licked his lips. He had no idea where any of that had come from, and could not explain it if somebody asked. Beside him, Potter sent him a confused look.
Once the hour had run out, Viktor Krum appeared on the shore of the lake. His head was Transfigured into a shark, though it returned to normal as the crowd jumped up and cheered for him. In his arms, Granger was held, her hair darker than usual from the water that dripped from it. She gasped, and both of them struggled onto to dry land, where Madam Pomfrey immediately set to work at warming the two up.
Luna, of course, noticed. She didn’t have much tact on a good day, so it wasn’t surprising when she sat down in the Great Hall one morning and asked him, straight-out, if Draco had a crush on Harry Potter.
Luckily, there weren't any sobs coming through the wall when he arrived. Draco put on his patient-face and swung the door open, purposefully swishing his robes as he did so.
“Who told you to come by last night?”
They found Sirius in his animal form not long after. The four trotted after the black dog, who was carrying some newspapers in its mouth. Sirius led them up into a cave hidden in the mountain that shadowed Hogsmeade, and then Transformed into his usual-self. Draco was rather breathless from the long walk, and didn’t immediately notice the hippogriff tied to the back of the cave. He jumped away from it, letting out an emasculating shriek. “Is that—?”
Inside, it was warmer and louder. Torches lined the halls that they all walked through, and once they'd made it to the Great Hall, the students' voices rose even higher in volumes. People called out greetings and spoke eagerly with those surrounding them. Draco waved at the Gryffindors before drifting off to the Ravenclaw table with Luna, who'd already started a running commentary about her newfound passion for sewing. He listened with an alert ear but got distracted by a group of girls giggling behind their hands at him. A well-done scowl shut them up, though it didn't shut off the bad feeling that had stirred in Draco's gut.
“Potter!” he called. “You’re giving out autographs now, are you?”
They stood like that for another second; Moody looming over Draco, who was embarrassingly close to falling asleep whilst standing. "It wouldn't do well for a student such as yourself to be found wandering around after curfew, nightmares or otherwise."
grand. Draco supposes he just thinks everything Harry Potter does is grand, despite them being the same age and most likely less educated. Most young witches and wizards these days grow up with Potter’s story constantly being retold in the paper, so much so that he’s become something of a myth. Harry Potter is anything but.
Why Weasley?
A fond feeling spread like vines across Draco’s heart. He smiled into his drink and said, “No, nothing wrong. Just thought it was time for a little change in scenery.”
This was all making him very uncomfortable, so Draco just started describing Potter's dregs. "This blob here might be a hat. Maybe you'll work at the Ministry. I'm sure that would be fun." He laughed.
Harry shrugged, a grin playing on his kissable lips. The fire that Trelawney refused to put out had forced Harry's own face to become flushed, which Draco privately thought was a good look for him.
“Only if you tell me what’s so important about Flamel in the first place. Hagrid mentioned something about a guard dog…?”
"It was absolutely wicked, mate," Weasley interjected. Draco talking back to Trelawney seemed to have changed their friendship for the better. "The centaur thing was a bit random, though."
“Voila!”
Again, somebody appeared at the compartment door.
Draco stifles a gasp, blinking away more tears. He wonders how he still has any left.
His opportunity to rid himself of the diary came by in early January. He'd been carrying it around in his bag and felt a sudden, exhilarating freedom from it. He rushed to the first bathroom he saw and chucked the blasted thing as far in as his arm would allow. He heard it land in one of the toilets with a splash. Draco ran for it.
"How could he have gotten inside at all, though?"
A wisp of white-blonde hair fell over his eyes. Draco tucked it back into place, vaguely aware of the stare Potter was giving him.
"The Killing Curse is not something you can avoid with a Shield Charm. If you ever encounter it, you dodge. No spell blocks it."
Potter shrugged and turned his head so they were staring at each other. "It can't be that bad."
“Yeah, Ron reckons it’s a bit of a girly present, but I remembered you like wearing stuff like that. Plus, Hermione told me jewellery isn’t confined to gender.”
Once she’s decided he isn’t about to drop dead, she waves the boy over. He wanders to the stool positioned beside Draco’s. A second witch levitates a set of school robes toward him to start pinning the fabric to its proper length.
“You disgust me,” Draco said.
Severus taps a rhythm onto Draco’s shoulder as he thinks. Draco focuses on it, hoping it distracts him from everything. It works, sort of. The words from his dream at least backs away from the front of his mind. “It hasn’t happened before?”
"Anyone in here knows which curses are the most heavily punished by wizarding law?" Moody asked, after rambling on about curses for a good ten minutes.
“Kind of,” says Potter. “I said I’d meet him at the Great Hall. He wants to show us the Christmas decorations he helped set up.”
“Can you move?”
Draco woke a moment later, face suspiciously wet, and body shaking underneath the table.
"Give me a curse, Malfoy. You would know them?"
"Hello, Ginny. Harry... Malfoy. I can't find a seat, everywhere's full."
When the Duelling Club was announced, Draco couldn’t summon more than a halfhearted cheer. He’s always exhausted recently, and his marks have been reflecting that. If he were to attend the club, he’d probably only make a fool of himself.
Granger smacks herself on the forehead, and the boys’ attention is redirected to her. Draco breathes out, relieved they’re no longer staring. He hopes he won’t regret this, but already Severus’ words are returning to him.
The three of them began to yell out denials. Weasley's voice carried the clearest as he asked, "What'd you attack us for?"
“What? No! That’s just— ridiculous. I’d rather eat my own puke than fancy that idiot.”
"What's going on here?" he shouts over the excited crowds, pushing through and finding Potter on the floor with a cupid-dressed dwarf sitting at his ankles. "Oh, I see."
The sound of a new voice startles Draco from his musings. He glances over at the new incomer and promptly falls off the stool. Ouch.
"You didn't know?" Harry asked, sounding apologetic. Draco shook his head. "People have been saying it all term. I mean, it's not as gossiped about as me being completely insane, but it's still a pretty well-known rumour. Not that we believe it!"
It was silent for a long beat. And then, “I’m actually not an Auror.”
is my godfather,” Draco answers. Immediately, Hermione and Potter’s argument stops.
He tensed, unaware of this.
As he disappeared down the corridor. Draco slumped back onto the stone wall, a red flush dotting at his cheeks. He let his chin drop forward onto his chest, absently going through Sev's breathing exercises.
"I wish you'd stop calling me that. But, fine. Come on, we might still be able to find seats," said Ginny. Once Harry had sent one last look over his shoulder at Granger and Weasley, the three of them struggled down the corridor; peeking into compartment windows in search of empty seats or, in Draco's case, Luna. Eventually, they ran into Longbottom, who was standing uncomfortably at a carriage door, his pet toad, Trevor, struggling in his grip. "Hello, Neville."
“Of course I approve of it!” Harry yelped. “I mean. It’s fine. I don’t mind at all... Does anyone else know?”
“Yes, child, it is me,” Professor Snape whispers. He was crouching down so they were at the same level. Dark, greasy hair covers most of his face. “Count to ten with me.”
There was stomping downstairs as Draco collapsed onto the emerald sheeted bed. He thought he could hear some cursing from Sirius before silence engulfed the house, thankfully. He dropped his eyes shut, but sleep didn't come, no matter how many Hippogriffs he counted. Giving up, Draco stood again and directed his attention to his suitcase. He'd never got around to unpacking it, even after Sev had returned it to its natural size, as the reality of the situation had never really hit before that moment. Grimmauld Place was, for now, his home. At least, the safest place he could call home at the moment.
Again, he nodded, though now he spoke. "The Imperius Curse."
“Oh, my!” Madam Malkin immediately rushes over to help him up. Draco’s face feels very, very hot as he reorients himself, and his bottom already has the beginnings of an ache. “Are you alright, dearie?”
He nodded, moving further in.
Draco was sulking, he could admit it. According to Professor Flitwick, Umbridge has assigned him two week's worth of detention with her for threatening the livelihood of a teacher. He really hoped it didn't get back to Severus, somehow. "I didn't do anything, Granger. She asked for a prediction and I gave her one."
Harry Potter was waiting outside his office.
A month into term and Draco isn’t feeling especially wise, though. With each that passed, he grew more and more tired. Even Severus had sent him a note one morning, asking whether he was feeling alright, and perhaps he should visit the Hospital Wing to pick up some sleeping draughts. The whole ordeal is stressful, and Draco’s only refuge becomes his diary, which he hides in his pillowcase.
"Don't stop now! Your family history is so interesting!" Luna said brightly.
, he thought. That black dog had done a real number on him.
Potter sat down beside him. He pulled the cloak off himself. "It's nice in here. Very blue. Pretty stars.”
“You know me?”
Well, maybe not none. Harry moves in front of Draco, blocking the exit. “You can’t leave! You’re part of the team, now.”
“Are you gonna tell us who Flamel is?” Weasley says, unaware of the agony occuring inside Draco’s head.
Draco looked away, embarrassed. "It's a secret. I don't really want to tell you."
Pomfrey, apparently finished with his bone, takes on the job of clearing away the blood that Potter’s arm is coated in. There had been no physical wound there, but she still is required to double-check.
“Obviously I’m okay,” Draco snaps. Potter flinches and steps away. “Sorry. I was just… Nevermind. Leave me alone, Potter.”
“Nah, my place is further down the sewers,” Weasley replies nonchalantly. Draco giggles, incredulous. “You just have to take a right, and you’ll see my smelly old chamber. I keep my cows there.”
"I reckon I'm the most beautiful creature," Draco mumbled, just loud enough for Boot to hear it, as he let out a low chuckle. "Luna, what other electives have you chosen?"
"What the fuck!" he screeched. "How are you here? I thought— of course. I should've realised you'd use your invisibility cloak."
Draco crosses his arms over his chest. "I'm not saying. Severus said to stay out of trouble, or he'll be sending an owl to my parents."
“What are you lot going to the library for? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?” Hagrid asks.
bad-guy over summer. So, with sudden clarity, Draco realises what he’s watching. A nightmare.
"Lover!" he crows, "Hogwarts has never celebrated Valentine's Day before!"
“Huh? Nothing. Nowhere. I’m fine,” he stuttered. “I’m going to get back to work. I’m sure there’s a long list of dumbasses waiting to be saved by yours truly.”
In the next few days, they moved from the drawing-room to the dining room, where Sirius seemed to make it his personal mission to get rid of anything bearing the Black crest. Kreacher put up a good fight; appearing wherever they gathered and attempting to remove things from the rubbish stacks, though all his efforts were mostly futile in the end, as Sirius would get so mad he would pick up the elf and chuck him from the room.
She giggled. “Whatever you say, Draco.”
They arrived outside Pomfrey’s doors. She swings them open with a scream.
“Yeah,” the boy replies, eyes flickering between Draco and the charmed tape measure whizzing around them.
“Oh, I got you something!” he says abruptly, rummaging through the pockets of his pants. Draco waits patiently. “There you go. A late birthday present.”
“Ginny, it’s alright. That’s just how he is,” Potter says. “Look, Malfoy, I’m serious. I haven’t been ignoring you, and if you let me explain--”
Draco put on a mask of the utmost innocence. “Feel free to correct me, Miss Granger, but I think it's for reading. Oh, yes, how interesting!” He turned to a page dedicated to the most recent winner of the Most Charming Smile award. “Gregory Cotton? Never heard of him, though I can see... Ah, what’s this?”
When Christmas finally rolls around, Draco spends half the morning finishing up his first full night of sleep in months. He opens his gifts a little bit before dinner and then heads to the hall for the feast. Potter, Granger and Weasley are already inside, waiting.
The wandpile becomed larger and larger. His mother’s scowl deepens as her impatience grows, but Mr Ollivander only gets happier with each fail. “Another tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, I’ve just had another kid who took quite a number of attempts before finding the right wand. Now, I wonder…”
"Well, it depends. Many would say mentally I have the mind of a child, but I was born in '72. Of course, there's also the fact I can appear as old as I like. Watch this!"
Tonks sighed but didn't disagree. "Sorry, got a bit excited. So, Draco, how's life been treating you?"
“Are you going to kill me, Harry?” Black asked. Potter’s hand didn’t falter. “You’ll regret it. You don’t know half the story—”
“My arm hurts.”
Luna happily trotted into the Great Hall. She was much more pleased with the announcement, as she had a lesson with Moody that afternoon, and was also under the impression he seemed a bit dodgy. Draco was very glad to have picked her as a best friend.
On Friday afternoon, he had Professor Lupin for the first time. The man arrived late, with a set of robes that looked far too old to even be worn. His hair was a light brown, and though he looked young, his eyes were old. Draco didn't know what to think of him.
Granger shared a look with Weasley, who then seemed to become more interested in the floor than them. Awkwardly, Granger said, "Actually— er, Ron and I are supposed to go to the prefect's carriage."
Draco rolled his eyes. “Buckbeak was innocent. Zabini insulted him.”
“It could’ve come in handy or something, you know?”
Her face takes on a look of relief. “I’m meant to be meeting Cho for ice-cream, but they’ve given me more patients than usual today, and I don’t want to waste any time on minor injuries. Will you please, please take a few of them off my back, just for today?”
Draco perked up. If that was true, he'll have to look into his own great-grandparents blood...
Draco stood up. He was so angry all of a sudden. "Don't talk about my mother like that. And, you know, for someone who hates their family so much, you're awfully like them in the way you're so quick to fucking hate someone based on who they're related to."
Some of that he’d never even let himself think about, let alone say. Yet Draco knew it was true. Because, the reality was, the dreams terrified him; not because they were bloody and elaborate, but because they might be
"Good lad," Hagrid says, clapping him on the back. Draco falls to his knees from the force. "Sorry, sorry."
for?”
Frantic footsteps that weren't his own echoed in every crevice, every shadow. It hardly bothered Draco. He had been through worse.
His father guides him to the side of the crowd that has gathered inside the store. Apparently, some famous wizard is visiting, although Draco didn’t really care for celebrities. He’d never had much need for a role model.
"It's very exciting, isn't it?" Terry said as they sat down at the Ravenclaw table. He seemed adamant to be better friends with Draco this year. "I wonder what they'll be like. I've heard the Durmstrang students are taught about actual Dark Arts, rather than just the defence for it."
It was only Harry's confused, puppy-dog like face that reminded Draco this was a bad thing. As they headed in the direction of the horseless stagecoaches to take them to the castle, he wondered where Hagrid was. The darkness of the night and upbeat conversations circling around him distracted him, though, and Draco forgot all about Hagrid when he caught sight of the carriages. They were no longer horseless.
Cho looked a little shocked at being challenged, but her gentle smile didn't falter. "I suppose I could. Um, it's probably not as good as yours, but... Pouvez-vous me donner la... Um. Gravy? Sorry, I don't know gravy in French."
He got an annoyed frown in response.
Draco pursed his lips, looked down at Ron’s still figure, and began levitating him up the hill they were on.
“It’s true?” Weasley said, outrageous. The tips of his ears were burning red. “What did you say?”
"That's a shame. It's one of my favourites."
. Oh, but what a dream it was. Flashes of green, so curiously bright in the endless abyss that the night sky is, while shouts and cackles floated in the air. The cruel man’s words bounce around Draco’s head the most, real and evil;
”It’s a shame you don’t have the Time-Turner, anymore.”
Filch and Snape stood at the bottom of a staircase, arguing in angry hisses, with that very golden egg sat at their feet. Draco gaped at it.
Draco found Luna in a compartment at the end of the train, looking entirely well, if a bit peckish. She had sent him a short note promising she'd not been hurt during the Death-Eater attacks, but Draco couldn't help but worry. Sometimes Luna was so unaware of certain evils in the world, like how it was her classmates stealing her belongings and not some new creature her father had told her about. Hopefully, this year would be better. Draco's own third-year was far superior to his first two, after all.
"What the hell is wrong with you three?"
"My father wanted me to go there." He scooped some vegetables onto his plate. "Though it was more likely I'd end up at Beauxbatons if Hogwarts wasn't an option. I mean, I don't even speak Russian!"
She strode over to the trapdoor, kicked it open, and disappeared down the hole. The class watched in amazement, right until Granger was completely out of sight. Thankfully for Draco, everyone then became too distracted to even remember what had started the whole thing. Potter, however, did not. He turned to Draco, and said, “Did you really See something?”
Draco pushed the door open and doesn’t dawdle as he went to the rear of the pub.
A few minutes later, everybody was swapping cups. Weasley took his, while Draco grabbed Potter's. Granger stared into Weasley's, and Potter got hers.
Draco rolled his eyes and looked over his shoulder. The Gryffindor's were huddled on the opposite side of the Hog's Head together, looking a little worried, now.
a more mature whispered back. Draco bit down on his lip, effectively shutting both voices up.
So Harry would be saving Weasley, then.
As they approached the doors to leave, they were held up by some kind of commotion at the front of the line. Draco got on his tip-toes and found Harry being stared at by the Durmstrang headmaster, Karkaroff. "Some of us are trying to get to bed, back here!" he shouted.
“Both Granger and Weasley are missing. Surely Harry isn’t meant to rescue both of them!” He was mostly speaking to himself, now. If that was indeed the task, it made sense that Harry hadn’t come back, yet. Perhaps, if he was supposed to rescue two students, then he’d be awarded extra points. That would be the only way for it to be fair. “Maybe... maybe...”
Draco hated getting fitted for robes.
"These things often, er, skip three generations."
The doors squeaked open, revealing a wizard who must've only been in his early twenties. He had large ears, and pimples in sizes that Draco had never seen before. "Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stra..."
“I was wondering if you had any books about magical snakes…”
? The kid either had a hypochondriac for a parent or was one themselves. Either way, he had no second thoughts on agreeing as he headed for the hospital’s fourth floor.
She waved a careless hand in front of her and said, “Better than alright once I got to them.”
"Wait," Draco interrupted. He let his instinct take over, and it wasn't him that was using his mouth to speak, anymore. "Professor Umbridge, I can See some of your greatest desires come about very soon... But not for long, and certainly not without a cost... You should ... You should watch out for, erm, centaurs? Yes, centaurs. They are not fond of High Inquisitors, and are not against violence to - to drive you away."
"You must've visited before the last owner died," Severus said as they walked up the front steps. "I'd be surprised if you actually remember the inside, though."
Draco grinned, relieved. “Just Luna. My parents probably won’t care too much, if I told them. As long as it doesn’t eventually get in the way of me providing them with an heir. And surrogates exist, and stuff, so.”
A bird chirped outside, distracting him from thoughts of deadly spells and scarlet-eyes.
He hummed a little no. Weasley made a joke about there being lots of fog tonight, just as Trelawney came sweeping past. She tutted at the four of them. “You won’t be Seeing anything like that!”
"Malfoy?"
Draco smiled. "Are you referring to the one where your father theorises that my cousin is secretly the lead-singer of the Hobgoblins?"
Moody clunked forward on his wooden leg, fake eye staring right through Draco's terrified face. "What are you afraid of, Malfoy?"
Resisting the urge to throw a stinging hex at a teacher, Draco went with Dumbledore.
“That’s nice.” Luna smiles. “Are you also a first-year?”
Draco ignored Potter's head whipping up
Draco lowers his head, ashamed. They lapse into a short silence. “I was under the impression you weren’t having panic attacks anymore.”
He cut himself off. Heart skipping, Draco stared into the infuriatingly green eyes of one Harry Potter. His skin is tanner than it had been at Hogwarts, and his back is visibly less tense. Draco noticed the smaller boy beside Potter a beat later, placed delicately atop the hospital cot, with his little legs dangling over the side.
could be a bully at times. But-- evil? Surely not. The word doesn’t match with Sev; not the Severus that helps Draco through his panic attacks and can read his journals without being repulsed by the things written in them. Surely not
Draco chuckles dryly at the comment, ignoring the betrayed look his father sends him. When his dreams had been at their worst, his parents became desperate and decided he was cursed with something. He hadn’t been, but it’s still a funny memory.
He was speechless.
"Why are you creeping around in that thing!" Draco shouted, groping the air for the stupid cloak. He finally found it and pulled it off of Potter.
He hadn’t been able to find Granger and Weasley that morning. The two had been absent during breakfast, as well as Cho, whose friends had been worrying all the way to the Great Lake. Draco had been, too... He really hoped Harry wasn’t dead, having drowned or frozen to death as soon as he jumped in.
Lucius approaches next, placing a solemn hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I’m glad you’re alright.”
“Right,” Draco echoes. He flops onto the edge of his bed more carefully this time. Boot notices and grins a little.
Harry is busy helping Granger with her dropped things, so Draco cocks his hip in Weasley’s direction and says, “What are you even doing here? It’s the last place I’d expect some Gryffindors to be.”
But a basilisk is not what came out. It was something much worse. Severus Snape came toppling to the floor, blood leaking from the wounds on his neck. A weak, hurt gasp came from the man's mouth. Draco's breathing came out short as the nightmare he'd tried so hard to forget became true right in front of him. Severus was dead. Dead, dead, dead. And now everyone else knew, too.
It’s not actually
Draco pointed in the direction they’d gone. “They went to help Sirius, I think he’s injured. But be careful, Professor Lupin is somewhere out there...”
Draco fiddled with the note between his fingers, letting out a shaky sigh. He sits in the long nook of his bedroom window, knees pulled tightly against his chest, an open book at his feet.
Bowing his head obediently, Draco follows his father inside.
“Who was sitting behind you?” Sirius asked.
A little terrifyingly, she set her large grin on Draco. Her eyes wandered over his white-blonde hair, his pointy nose, and the necklace still cupped in his hand. Embarrassed, he shoved it into the same pocket with his trunk. Her attention lingered on it for half a second, until she abruptly thrust her hand out and said, "I'm Tonks."
“He’s brilliant,” the boy proclaims. “He gave my cousin a tail.”
Quiet again, until they both spoke at the same time.
"Narcissa Black," he said, and waited for some kind of recognition. It didn't come. "Seriously? You don't know the Ancient House of Black? They're only, like, the most famous pureblood family ever!"
“I’m on lunch break,” said Draco. He chucked his half-drunk coffee into the nearest bin and tried to walk away. He has no desire to spend the last ten minutes of lunch with Astoria-fucking-Greengrass who, although is very kind, almost exclusively talked about her girlfriend. Draco only gets about five steps away before she’s running after him, though. “Why are you following me?”
, a voice whispered back.
"Give me a second," Draco mumbles. He flips to the front page, and, yes, it was his diary. "Potter, how—?"
That evening, all the students were once more taken to the Great Hall. He rushed over to Potter, who told him the summary of what had happened. Black got into the castle again and had tried attacking Weasley. Everyone was already whispering about how he’d mistaken Ron’s bed for Potter’s.
“That’s hardly important! And anyway, I was far too busy making sure you and Harry were okay,” Granger said, going red as well. “Maybe she has an invisibility cloak. She’s banned from school grounds, after all...”
“Seven galleons.”
"Sure, but I'm not going," Draco said. "I've got a... family thing. I'm allowed to leave the grounds that day."
Draco rubbed his thumb over the metal rose hanging on his neck.
Astoria grinned. She disappeared for a moment and returned with a clipboard in her manicured hands. The name
“Professor?”
Draco could remember, now. He’d spent the last month of his life hiding from Potter, even after Granger was petrified. That was around when he realised who had actually been behind all the starks. Resisting Riddle’s diary was too difficult even once he’d figured it out, though. He vaguely recalls a handsome boy erupting from the pages before… blackness.
"What are you implying?"
He hasn’t ever really
A painfully long moment passed. Finally, Dumbledore stood and gestured for them to speak closer to the entrance of the maze. “I assume you would like privacy?”
He picks it up. Potter makes grabby hands for it, but Draco is insistent.
"You should give that thing to Dumbledore," Draco blurts.
Draco sighs. He changes into his pyjamas and then gets into bed. The other boys’ whispers thankfully fade away, and the last thought that hits him before sleep comes is, rather depressingly,
Or, really, he doesn't, because the man wanted to use the Imperius Curse on the students, and Draco felt no reason to take part in such a cruel activity— even if it was a waste of an hour. He could try catching up on some homework, take a nap ... So, after feeling Moody's fake-eye follow him out of the classroom, he headed to the library, only a pinch of regret fluttering around his mind.
“Oh. I hear she’s part Veela,” Draco said conversationally. He wrapped an arm around Luna’s waist— she was about to fall. Soft snores flooded into his ears. “You don’t seem too affected.”
The man swept away. Draco could’ve laughed if he hadn’t been so terrified of what was about to happen. He ran back to Luna, who grabbed onto his hand again, and it was like that they watched; like that, they waited for the inevitable.
"I hope she's alright," Draco murmured, almost to himself. "You three best be off. Those Death-Eaters will be looking for other people to play with, and I'd bet Muggleborn's will be at the top of their list."
. "What's this?"
I spending the rest of the summer there?" Draco asked, eagerly.
“I’m fine,” he says automatically. Severus opens the door further and they both go inside. The place smells of potions and neglect, exactly how he expected. Draco forcibly stops himself from making a face. How could anyone live in such a state? “May I ask you something?”
Draco’s feet knew where to take him. He rushes toward the dungeons, where Snape would be teaching a class-- that doesn’t matter though. Some potion lesson with the firsties wasn’t more important than this. Somebody is planning the man’s demise, after all, and he’s determined to stop it.
“Teddy’s magic is working, but—”
He’s so caught up in cussing his parents that Draco doesn’t notice Harry Potter before he’s standing right in front of him, a curious tilt to his stupid, ugly head-- just when he thought his day couldn’t get any worse. “What do you want?”
"I wonder if he would've gotten the riddle right if he tried Ravenclaw tower," Luna mused quietly, tying her long hair into a pretty bun.
He started off again, briefly entertaining the hope that Luna had gotten away before any of this even started, but it was unlikely. She'd written him weeks before about the Cup— the Lovegood's had planned to stay the night, just like everyone else who had bought tickets for the occasion. It seemed like such a stupid idea, now. Like, yeah, alright, let's round-up wizards from all around the country and then not expect something to go wrong. Brilliant plan.
Sirius Black's words from months ago echoed inside his head. Malfoy's boy, is it?
"Just that Dumbledore would be mighty interested in who has it out for that boy. And I am, too... Very interested..."
Teddy tapped his chin. “I think maybe dinner.”
“You sold them out to Voldemort, killed all those Muggles. They trusted you. They fucking trusted you!”
Once at the station, his mother was there alone to pick him up. She engulfed him in a warm hug that had them both on the verge of tears and then Apparated them away, leaving Draco no moment to say his goodbyes.
"Ah, Kreacher recognises the young master! He has visited Mistress' home very long ago as a baby, before blood-traitors and Mudbloods ever stepped foot inside it! Thank you, sir, thank you!" the thing wiped fat droplets from its wrinkly cheeks, only to take notice of who had arrived with him. "Master Draco brings... brings the unnatural and greasy half-bloods with him?"
He fidgets with his fingers. Draco is wearing one of the rings he’d gotten for Christmas, but it’s a little big and slips off when he isn’t careful. “It was a dream, like always. A man was talking to me in it. Like, to
They served a more variety of dishes than usual, for the feast. Draco tried a little of everything because his palette always got so dull when he went to school. Luna was a large fan of a French pudding that popped into existence on their area of the table.
, he thought.
to make conversation with someone his own age, either.
“What do you mean? Look, give me my wand back. I might need it,” Harry Potter says, his tone fading into something resembling suspicious.
Potter flushed, fiddling with his hands. “You said ‘Auror Potter’. I’m not an Auror, though. I haven’t been for almost a year.”
His fingers curl around the spine. It's a copy of Omens, Oracles & The Goat by Bathilda Bagshot, which Draco had gotten as a late birthday gift from Sev. He's had no inclination to read about the history of Divination, though, and had only given it the barest of his attention before losing interest.
As Snape’s blood seeps into his vision, Draco startles awake.
Luna shivered and pulled her cloak tighter around her shoulders. “What is it?”
Frankly, Draco didn't know what to 'reckon'. He was so shocked at the discovery of having an actual cousin (not that third, twice-removed shit) who was semi-normal, he doubted he'd ever get another word out.
Draco ignored them, looking up and down the train's corridor for Luna. She must've already found a compartment, though. "I suppose I'll be off, then?"
“Do you know, Teddy,” Draco said, “that a Metamorphmagus’ abilities are linked to their emotions?”
He shook his head. "I don't know."
"Very funny," she replies, not laughing. "And, you know Draco, they're your friends, too."
"Ancient Runes, and Divination," she said. "I wanted to do Muggle Studies but it wouldn't fit in my timetable."
Ron opened his mouth to reply, but a man appeared from somewhere and beat him to it. "Out of the way, Arthur," he said, and Draco recognised it to be Mr Crouch. They'd met hours earlier, before the game. "Which of you did it? Which of you conjured the Dark Mark?"
“I don’t…”
Truthfully, he had a session with Terra that day, but he wasn't prepared to admit it to anyone. It would be seen as a weakness, and Malfoy's didn't do weaknesses.
Draco’s not sure how he hadn’t come up with it himself. Potter and Weasley hitched a ride to Hogwarts in a flying car, slammed right into the Whomping Willow, and then got quite the earful from Mrs Weasley the next morning. It all played out like some book.
More voices came from ahead of him. It sounded like a group of French girls, and Draco could pick up on a bit of what they were saying. His mother had tried teaching him French from an early age, but it had seemed so useless that he'd stopped showing up for the lessons at some point. He could speak it alright now, as long as he did so slowly, but if you asked him to translate something written? It just wouldn't be happening.
"Defeated, huh?" Moody whispered, looking almost mad, before straightening up, again. "What are these nightmares about, Malfoy?"
get along. “But I reckoned you seemed a little lonely sometimes, and Hermione always says that you’re only ever at the library alone, so I thought maybe you needed a friend, and… yeah.”
He shared a look with Weasley. Potter finally went quiet at his feet. Granger levitated a Christmas tree to hide their table from view.
Zabini's jaw clenched noticeably, and his eyes turned sharper. Draco swallowed, regret filling his veins. "That's a point taken from Ravenclaw for swearing, Malfoy. What would your mummy say? And, by the way, if you knew what was good for you, you'd give a lot more than two shits, because my 'gossip' isn't pretty. But if you don't care? Fine. Suit yourself."
, Draco thought. Sirius Black might see it as an opportunity to attack.
Umbridge glared at him. Draco resisted the urge to shrivel back. Surprisingly, Trelawney looked grateful. "A student, you say? And I suppose you'd like that to be you? Fine. Go on, then. Predict something for me."
"Maybe." He scooped a bit of mashed potato onto his plate. "Have you finished your essay for Muggle studies yet?"
is scribbled at the top.
Draco blinked. "Terry, you might actually have a point, there."
Draco takes the tomb from him almost hungrily, rubbing his thumb over the front cover. “How much is it?”
Granger’s bushy head enters Draco’s line of sight. Her nose is scrunched, indecision sewed in her furrowed eyebrows. She exchanges a glance with Harry. “I’m not sure, Malfoy. What if you run off and tell Snape?”
Many evenings were spent falling asleep early just to escape the suffocating loneliness that followed him everywhere around the house. One night, after waking from a dream he'd rather not think about, Draco ventured outside his room and into the kitchen, where he found Sirius sat at the table with a collection of expensive wine bottles surrounding him. His dark hair had been groomed since his escape from Azkaban, though his eyes were just as lifeless as the day they'd met. Draco hesitated when he caught sight of the man, but his dry throat painfully reminded him why he had come out in the first place.
“Perhaps she was onto something. I think, maybe, possibly, you might be a Seer. A real one.”
“Because it scares me!” Draco shrieked. He grabbed the diaries back and placed them back under his bed. “If my dreams are meant to come true, then what about the really bad ones? The ones of war, and my fucking godfather bleeding out in front of me? When I told Severus about that, he said I was wasting his time with silly stories! That’s why I, I even go to the therapy sessions! They manage to convince me I’m only paranoid, if only for a few hours.”
Draco almost refuses to repeat it. What the man had uttered, it was important. They were some kind of key for a lock that he hadn’t gotten his hands on just yet. But he has to tell Severus, or else his parents will be even angrier than they already are. “He said… he said ‘you are so small for a power so big’. Over and over again. And, the way he said it was pure
“Please don’t tell anyone. I’ve heard it’s not exactly... accepted among Muggles for boys to like other boys,” Draco said, afraid. Luna reached across the table and held onto his hands.
“I don’t really believe you,” Potter continued. “But I won’t bring it up again.”
Potter smiles. Draco smiles back.
"They're not on a date," Potter said, oblivious.
"I'm really looking forward to Care of Magical Creatures, you know," said Luna in that enchanting way of hers. "I've heard wonderful things about Professor Hagrid."
This was a terrible idea. A terrible, no-good, awful idea. Draco was rarely the type to help people. He was a man of routine, and
Terry patted Draco's shoulder, "You're sounding a bit like a blood supremacist there. I'd reign it in if I were you."
The doors to the Great Hall banged open, just as a rumble of thunder rippled through the room. Draco swivelled around in his seat and saw a man stood in the doorway. He was leaning on a long staff, and was more shadow than person, what with the black travelling cloak pulled over his shoulders. Draco watched him begin to walk up towards the teachers' table, a clunk ringing through the hall with each of his steps.
OOTP will probably be split up into 2-3 parts, cause of how much plot there is to cover. same goes for the rest of the books :-)
They played around with her appearance for a little longer, only stopping when the bus pulled to a halt outside a gloomy-looking Muggle street. Severus stood up and headed for the doors, Draco and Tonks just behind him, chatting the entire time. As they got off, he gave the street a proper look, and felt a strange familiarity to the place, though could not precisely place why.
The three snuck out of the tent just in time to see the judges putting up their marks. Madame Maxime gave Harry an eight, Crouch and Dumbledore a nine, Karkaroff a four, and Ludo Bagman put up a ten. "Brilliant!"
A few things happen in the next couple of seconds. For once, Granger drops a thick book she’d been bent over, which leads to an array of flowery language coming out of her mouth. Weasley falls onto his backside in surprise, while Harry lets out an extremely emasculating shriek. To summarise, it’s certainly a memory Draco plans to hold on to. “Priceless, absolutely priceless. You guys should’ve seen your faces.”
Just then, the bell rung, signalling the start of their first lesson for the day. Everybody stumbled into the classroom in relative silence, except for the odd giggling girl or two.
"The final curse," Moody whispered, "is the most deadly. Only one person has survived it, and he goes to this very school.
“How’s the little one?” She asked, leaning on her hand.
“Look at this one.” He shoved the book at Draco and pointed to a line that spoke of green eyes and baby dragons. “You’ve practically rewritten exactly what happened to Hagrid’s old pet, Norbert. But— no one ever told you about that. Not properly, at least.”
He reads and tidies up his notes for almost two hours before deciding it’s time to leave. He checks out two books-- one on wand-lore, the other about potions-- and heads to the Ravenclaw Tower to prepare himself for dinner. It's a long walk, courtesy of the stairs, and he arrives sweaty and likely red in the face.
This is getting confusing. He should’ve just stayed in his dorm.
He sighs. "I'm leaving. For real this time," Draco announces, and walks off before Potter can try to stop him. He hears their argument resume as soon as he’s a few metres away.
"Harry is coming over," Luna said. A couple of dirty blonde strands had fallen from her hairdo, framing her youthful face very prettily.
Tonks nodded her aged-head. "Sure am. Hey, I've an idea."
“And I’m also sorry about… you know.”
Draco had had a whopping two conversations with the great Albus Dumbledore. Once, in second-year, when he wanted a quick recount of how he’d gotten hold of the diary. Draco had lied, of course, and said he’d found it in a bookstore. The second time was in third-year, when Dumbledore requested for him to keep his dreams a secret. And, as he walked over, those words repeated in his mind.
“Yeah.” He avoids Potter’s amused gaze, his cheeks feeling hot all of a sudden. “Not even the good kind of incest either, like the Blacks. The Slytherin’s didn’t do it to stay pure, they did it because they were selfish. They didn’t want anyone else to have the ability of talking to snakes, you see, so they only had offspring with people who already could. It’s all very gross.”
On February twelve, Draco resigned himself to missing a second Hogsmeade trip for another appointment with Terra. They talked about utterly meaningless things for the hour, and when he finally got back to Hogwarts, he was ready to climb into bed and forget the rest of the world. His plans were interrupted by an invisible Harry Potter, who knocked right into him and pushed them both to the floor.
A small frown-line came between Draco's brows as he tried to understand what Moody was getting at. "He defected, sir, before You-Know-Who was defeated. Dumbledore trusts him with his life."
Somebody poked at his shoulder, and Draco hardly stopped himself from jumping in the air from fright. He turned, ready to scream at someone, only to come face-to-face with Blaise Zabini. His smug, big-headed smirk was as prominent as ever. "Morning, Malfoy."
A loud screech echoed from somewhere further down the corridor. They both whirled around, and as soon as Moody rushed off, Draco followed; consequences be damned. That sound had been awfully similar to the one that came out of Harry's golden egg.
"That's no way to talk to a prefect." Zabini wet his bottom lip. "I just came to warn you about what some of the Slytherin's are saying."
Potter rolls his eyes. “You would love to be me. Don’t deny it,” he teases. Draco resists the urge to stick out his tongue. “Malfoy, can we please talk about the letters now? I know it seems like I might’ve ghosted you, but--”
At the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore went through his yearly farewells, only this time he spoke of what had happened— the truth. Not the rumours that had been spreading since Harry appeared that night, clutching the lifeless body of one Cedric Diggory. Draco’s tongue felt heavy through the entire thing, and couldn’t even muster up the energy to applaud when the rest of the school did. He was strangely numb.
Draco nodded hurriedly, and they went over. He caught Luna watching a little worriedly, and tried for his best smile. She focussed back on the maze.
are either.”
Someone came sprinting past Draco, in such a rush they didn't notice him sat at their feet. "Stop!" they yelled. "Stop! That's my son!"
“Well enough,” he repeats.
After the meeting was over, Draco ignored Granger whining about his inviting the Slytherin's— as if that was fair in any way. Just because they got saddled with some shitty family didn't mean they were less entitled to better education. Anyway, afterwards, Zabini wanted to speak with him alone. Draco went, if only to avoid Harry for a little while longer, who had been even madder about the Slytherin thing than Granger.
"That you're queer," said Zabini casually. Draco let out a breath. That was hardly a secret, anymore. He'd been slowly telling people since the Yule Ball, last year. Harry first, then Granger and Weasley, Severus... Luna had always known, so she was the easiest to come out to. "And don't deny it. I noticed last year."
Today, he was being measured for Hogwarts robes; his new uniform. Mother had insisted on getting three sets a size too big, in case he grew over the school year, as well as a set one size too small, in case he somehow shrunk! Of course, there were also the sets that needed to fit him as he was now. Altogether, it was taking too damn long. Draco had been stood on this stupid stool for almost half an hour.
Snape hesitated. They stopped in the middle of the hall, and Snape turned him so they were facing each other. “I told him about your status as a Seer.”
Draco gnawed at his bottom lip, stomach flipping painfully with each movement in the water. Terry was half-asleep beside him, and Luna’s head had fallen onto his shoulder almost as soon as the second task started. Harry had disappeared into the lake almost thirty minutes ago, and there was no sign of him coming up soon. Fleur let out a dry sob a couple of seats down, just as Draco felt the tang of blood seep onto his tongue, likely from biting too hard on his mouth.
“Good afternoon. I will be your Healer for today, how can I—”
Without waiting for a response, he stormed back upstairs and headed for Regulus' bedroom— the one that stupid Sirius had assigned him. It was smaller than his room at the Manor, but still relatively big. It was also covered in green in whatever direction you looked.
“What are you doing?” Terry Boot hisses beside him. “Class hasn’t finished yet.”
"So, what'd you wanna talk about?"
“So, what was the problem today?” and—
“Figured out what?”
They don their darkest, most depressing clothes for the event. It’s Luna’s idea, but Draco hadn’t needed much convincing to agree. They both look fetching in their Snape-reminiscent cloaks.
“Seen anything yet?” Potter asked.
He startled, smacking his shoulder against the wall. A fierce ache blossomed under his skin, but Draco sucked back the grimace and turned around with a smile. “Astoria. Hey. What’s up?”
“Nine Sickles.”
“So, yeah, I reckon I could kill you, but you deserve a fate worse than death for what you’ve done. I think I’ll just leave you to the dementors.”
Wary, the boy squeezed his eyes shut, nose scrunched in an almost adorable way. Draco watched silently, noting down any signs of pain that crossed Teddy’s face on the clipboard Astoria gave him. When nothing happened, Teddy’s lip forms a pout reminiscent of one that Draco used to resort to as a child. “See? Nothing! What if I can never do it again?”
A couple of minutes later, as the watch on his wrist reaches 7:33 P.M., Draco hears footsteps from down the hall and two voices. The first, he recognised, because it belonged to the wizard who lives in the portrait just outside his bedroom. "Lucius isn't here, boy! He won't like it if he finds you've been lurking about!"
