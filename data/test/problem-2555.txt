“What about you, Malfoy? Have you told your wife? Is that why she’s not here with you? Found you sucking someone else’s cock, did she?” Harry shot back. Malfoy’s face went cold.
Harry’s face blazed.
"Malfoy and I were never in a relationship." He finally argued. He couldn't bring himself to mention the rest of it.
“Oh, worried he’ll end up liking me better, cause I’m more fun?” Harry teased, speaking the words down at the baby in his arms. The baby smiled good-humoredly, and kicked his feet as Harry spun in a circle. Malfoy lurched forward as Harry danced away, keeping his son from him, smiling at the sheer joy of holding the tiny, but somehow incredibly weighty, little person. He’d always wanted one of his own. He’d wanted to start a family. But Ginny hadn’t been ready, She’d just gotten OUT of a big family. So Harry had waited. But now, holding Scorpius, with Draco chasing after him, he felt a surge of pure emotion, and happiness. THIS was what he wanted. He wanted a baby smiling up at him as he sang off-key, and hopped repeatedly out of reach as his partner gave chase. But that wasn’t right, Draco wasn’t his partner. He’d really never been. Harry slowed, his smile falling as he kept staring at the child that looked JUST like Draco. They’d been intimate, but… they’d never been public. They’d never been honest, even with themselves.
“Yes?” Hermione eyed him inquisitively, and Harry felt like she could probably see exactly what he was going to say. He took a breath and said it anyway.
“So… You like cuddling?” Harry finally gave up, and teased Malfoy for his actions. He let his arm drape across Malfoy’s cotton-covered stomach, just as useless as it had been at pushing him away.
Malfoy went still, forehead resting on Harry’s sternum, hands still holding Harry’s waist from his last few desperate thrusts, and Harry felt his breath cooling the sweat all down his stomach in harsh bursts. The burn had faded, leaving him feeling burnt out, and exhausted. He let his arms drop to the bed, and took in a deep shuddering breath. He could smell Draco, but the scent had changed. It was no longer filled with lust. There was no trace of the irritation he’d been worried about, either. He smelled… satisfied. He smelled of finished sex, stability, warmth. Harry turned his head, rubbing his nose in soft hair, letting the smell wrap around him in a comforting embrace as Malfoy settled closer, pressing his weight to Harry as he relaxed.
Harry glanced up, involuntarily looking for the eyes he knew would be watching him. Grey eyes looked away when Harry met them, and just seeing Malfoy made anxiety wrench in his stomach. Sure, he and Malfoy had agreed to just… get on with things if this happened again, but now that it was happening, Harry wasn’t sure how to go about it. Was he supposed to invite Malfoy over to his room? Should he send him an owl? Go over and ask if he wanted to work on Transfiguration homework together?
As he suffered through his first real unsuppressed heat, he noticed the frequent looks of interest and intrigue from both Alphas and Omegas. There were whispers, he was sure, but he couldn’t seem to hear them over the pounding in his ears when he realized that Malfoy was watching him too. His pupils were too large, his face unreadable, and the sight of it sent Harry right back to that night. He met Malfoy’s stare for several long, weighted seconds, until Hermione pulled his attention away, leaving Harry feeling warmer than before, and equally chilled when he looked back to find Malfoy had looked away, too. He was glad for that. He didn’t like what looking at Malfoy did to his stomach. Or his loins.
“She’s making a mess of your hand, Potter.” Malfoy observed. Harry smiled down at the sloppy mess of his hand.
“It was a
“I know things! Just… not… Omega things.” Harry mumbled defensively. Draco laughed again, and Harry glared up at him until he explained.
“Well then, that should give you PLENTY more options, if you’re interested in Alphas at all. I mean, I know the draw is there for all of you, but you’re not
“Master Potter, Master Malfoy is expecting you. Right this way.” She led him through the familiar house, and as Harry followed, looking around, he felt constant pangs of nostalgia. His first few times walking through here, he’d been reminded of the war, but now, he was reminded of a more recent past. He was reminded of arguments, whispered desires, and angry, desperate wanting.
Ron was silent for several minutes, and Hermione spoke up.
“Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.” He answered with a completely straight face, Harry wasn’t sure how he managed.
“Go.” The single word rang with menace as Draco stared unblinking at Zacharias. Still choking and struggling to stand under the onslaught, Smith fled. He went as fast as his shaking legs could carry him down the hall and away. Only when he was out of sight did Draco turn to face Harry.
been trying to be polite… or at least absent enough to avoid conflict. He thought of the quiet way he spoke with Hermione during their charms work, the way he’d stayed after waking up that first time. He thought of Malfoy, sitting here, inside of him, having a chat like it was the most normal thing in the world. He wanted to try overcoming the past, too.
“I’m not in heat. I’m… Going to shower!” He declared, and with every ounce of his willpower, he pushed back, yanked the door open, and slammed it shut between them, shutting the Alpha and his pheromones out until he could wash the scent and the words out of his skin.
me to mark you?” He asked, sounding shocked.
“What are you doing?” He stomped over, and yanked Harry away from the door, eyeing it as if it held a monster.
“I think maybe… I’ll just have to do what Pomfrey said. Find an Alpha and have some sort of arrangement with them, so we don’t… Pretty sure  you’ve ruined Smith, though. Maybe Charlie, Ron’s brother, or…”
“It was an accident.” He began, but that seemed to set Ron off further. His scent was clogging Harry’s nose, making him uncomfortable, desperate to soothe his friend. Harry’s mind was thrown back to earlier that morning, consoling Draco’s irritation, the urge to comfort him. He felt the same thing with Ron. Something inside him was straining to be free, to
"Thank you. Why don't you rest for a bit." He listened to the small, breathless elf's outrage at his suggestion all the way up the stairs.
"Yeah, fine, just thinking. I can see how that might've tipped you off." Harry nodded. "Why didn't you ever tell me you knew?"
“That’s the rub. I can hide, sleep with Malfoy, or get pregnant. So, if you don’t mind, I think I’ll stick with my current plan.” Harry sighed, rubbing the back of his neck. He was tense, despite his calming potion, and worried about Draco. He was probably suffering, on his own, burning up. Harry listened to Ron admit that Malfoy was a better option than being stuck with a kid so young, and Hermione insisted that they would support him no matter what, but his mind was elsewhere. He nodded absently, and let his thoughts wander distractedly throughout their homework, and dinner, and their usual post-dinner gathering.
“I already had an earful from Pomfrey.” Harry interrupted, and Hermione finally gave in to Ron’s tugging, allowing him to pull her back to her seat. “Anyway, I didn’t know. And I built up a tolerance, and now I can’t use them, or… the emergency ones might not work when I need them to.” He explained, feeling his cheeks heat with a blush. Hermione nodded seriously, having already thought of all of this, but Ron let out a low whistle.
"Oh, well, that changes everything! Somebody call the papers, Saint Potter has feelings!" Malfoy barked. Harry stared, not bothering to defend himself from Malfoy's verbal assault. "I suppose, since it means a lot to you, I'll just let it go. Because YOU feel bad, I'll forgive you for absolutely wrecking my life! I'll forget everything that happened, and we can pretend we never STOPPED hating each other! How's that, Potter? We can stick our heads in the sand, and forget anything EVER happened. Does that work for you? Merlin knows we have to cater to whatever works best for YOU! In fact, I don't know why I even came back! I have no idea what I was thinking. Things were fine as they were. Should I be gone by morning, or do I have until the end of the week to get back to France? Is France still good for you? I can go farther. I hear New Zealand is nice. Or maybe I'll be the first wizard to build a mansion on the moon,  just so I NEVER have to see your stupid face, EVER again! It would actually be perfect. I could get a new wife, and the moon would be so cold, I wouldn't even notice the difference in sleeping alone! FUCK you, Potter, and FUCK your apology, and FUCK your sudden need to be absolved of being a piece of shit!"
“Of course.” He agreed, and Hermione immediately began drawing up a time table of what he needed to learn, and how long it should take. Harry let her, entirely out of his depth already, and just wanted to know what he was doing before Malfoy could overwhelm him again.
"I'm not waiting. Tell me where he is, please." Harry asked, as politely as he could. His heart was racing, and he felt the need to move, to finally head in the direction he wanted.
“We can ask to change groups, if you want.” She offered. Harry shook his head.
“Potter… You are clearly inexperienced with Alphas, so I will warn you now. Do not just casually speak of fucking another Alpha when one is knotted inside you.” Malfoy’s voice was low, full of danger, and Harry felt the hair on his arms stand on end. He forced the irrational fear down. Malfoy’s wand was across the floor, with their clothes, and with them locked together, there was really not much he could do without hurting himself, too.
It had been three days. Harry had been suffering for three bloody days. He was finally ready to give in and ask for a sleeping potions, but on his way to the infirmary, he was stopped by an unlikely figure.
“Pomfrey says there
, sent his stomach twisting again, and instead of anger, there was
“Sorry, I didn’t… Harry, are you alright?” Hermione was in front of him, and Harry met her brown eyes, frowning.
“I was… just…” Harry found the words faltering. He had no idea what he’d been doing. Checking on Malfoy? Visiting for a chat? Horny?
"No, Hermione! I did not cheat on Ginny. Why would you even ASK that?" Harry refuted defensively. Thinking about cheating was another thing.
“Fuck you, Potter, it’s a fine name.” Malfoy declared, crossing his arms. Harry’s grin slid from his face. He could feel it coming. The moment it all became too much, and one of them would leave. He knew it would probably be him. His chest was already starting to ache from looking at Malfoy. But Ginny was right inside, his whole family was in there, and he was out here. With Malfoy. There it was. The moment he realized he was alone with Malfoy, and he had to leave before something happened.
"Apology not accepted. Will you be leaving, or would you like to sneak around my house more?" Malfoy asked sarcastically. Harry sighed. He should have known it wouldn't be that easy. He closed his eyes, and tried to find a sliver of patience.
"Yeah, I can tell. Though, I kind of wish I'd been there to watch Malfoy shove his pheromones down Smith's throat. Pompous bloody git." Ron muttered. Harry gave him a curious look, wondering if there was some offense he'd forgotten about. Ron shook his head to dismiss it, as Hermione let out a huff of exasperation.
“Mixing your pheromones, so they are literally embedded in your own scent. It makes Omegas less susceptible to the pheromones of other Alphas, and vice versa. If it’s one-way, it warns off other interested parties, and puts the bitten under the power of whoever bit them. It’ll fade after a few months, or can be replaced by someone else’s mark, but if it’s mutual, if an Alpha and Omega mark each other… they become bonded. It’s irreversible and makes you completely immune to the pheromones of others.”
“So an Omega interested in Draco, or an Alpha interested in me can tell, but not one whose… uninterested?” He felt a bit like an idiot trying to articulate it simply, but Luna nodded.
Malfoy’s lips were demanding as he pushed Harry back into the room, his body hard and his hands firm as he led Harry straight to the bed. Harry sank back without argument and Malfoy climbed on top of him, kissing, tearing clothes off, growling obscene things that Harry was sure should make sense, but he couldn’t seem to understand them. He breathed in the heavy scent of Malfoy and moaned, his own hands pushing at the cloth covering cream colored skin, demanding it be freed. Malfoy yanked his own clothes off next, and before Harry could beg for it, he was filling him, sinking deep into Harry. They both shuddered at the feel of it, and Harry watched Malfoy’s face transform with the same need that was mirrored inside him. He grabbed Harry’s hips so hard his fingers left bruises, but Harry didn’t complain. Harry didn’t complain when teeth scraped his shoulder, or a tongue laved at his neck. He couldn’t seem to remember any words, anyway.
“But… That’s the middle of the night. Why are you taking a suppressant in the middle of the night?” She sounded thoroughly flummoxed, and Harry shook his own head, confused.
"And… you're not one, right?" He asked, just to be sure. Hermione huffed.
He was still sitting at the Slytherin table, fork in hand, smiling a saucy, playful smile at Theodore Nott, and pushing food around on his plate. Harry didn’t think too hard on what Malfoy not eating might mean, either. He knew Malfoy had his own scars from the war, his own nightmares. It never did him any good to dwell on which might be the worst, on which he wakes up from the most frequently.
“So… Why is it that some people’s smell makes me want to…” He trailed off, waving a hand suggestively. Ron barked out a laugh.
not fair how good Malfoy biting him felt.
He wandered back down to his next class, Charms, and sat through it, barely able to listen. He was hard under the desk, and glad for the robes that hid his unfortunate erection.
“Not necessarily. If you were anything but an Omega, Potter, I’d have walked out the minute you ran from the bed.” He muttered. Harry stared up at the side of his face, trying to determine if he was joking or not. Draco sighed, looking back at him with a look of suffering.
Harry glared at her. He didn't want to be told how lucky he was. He was likely the least lucky person alive, in fact. He dropped his head to his hands.
“I felt like I learned a lot from Al, and all that he showed me,” Harry concluded as he finished retelling everything about Al’s memories to Draco.
Yet the strangest and most terrifying thing about the whole ordeal was that George was forced to realise that he didn’t actually have any friends outside of his family. When he didn’t have Fred, he was utterly alone. They had always joked that the road of humor was a lonely one, and that as jesters, they were comparatively alone. It hadn’t actually bothered George until he realised that he couldn’t approach any group without them eyeing him suspiciously, or removing everything from his reach. Everyone was expecting a trick or a joke, no matter if George did nothing, or if he asked for help with something. Most people didn’t even want him in their midst, which led George Weasley to experience loneliness for the first time in his life.
When Ron woke up with enough energy to remain conscious, he was informed by Madam Pomfrey what had happened, as well as given assistance to the bathroom. When he was slowly eating his dinner, staring into the nonexistent eyes of the cast which entrapped his once again broken leg, the same leg, of course, he was visited by his friends.
The Room of Requirement appeared much like it had last year, a long table was surrounded by two sofas and an armchair, all of which were made out of soft, yet old and broken leather. Beyond that was Hermione’s Dark Arts station, and immediately to their left was Teddy’s tinkering area. On the other end of the long table, opposite to the armchair, burnt a fire. Hermione saw her favorite pillow-plushie, a large lion, waiting for her in one of the sofas, yet her immediate attention was drawn to Draco and the huge, black snake which shared the sofa with him.
“It’s worth everything in the British Mage community… And I guess I squandered it on not liking people very much.” I admit in a quiet voice.
Underneath, it read: ‘suitable for all ages 5-18’. As Hermione would later point out, no matter the educational subject, nothing with less than 300 pages could possibly cover such a large and diverse age group.
The people who worked were the vast majority by far, and the system worked as thus they should provide for the other two categories in return for physical respectively spiritual protection. The aristocracy functioned as the military leaders, and their role was to serve under the regent and protect the area. In turn for their loyalty to the regent they were given the opportunity to collect taxes, escape taxes themselves, to rule certain smaller areas and other various boons.
“Angie is busy today, do you wanna do something? We can go paint one of the statues! Or change the color of the Slytherin banner in the Great Hall. Hah, imagine Umbridge’s face if they are suddenly all pink!” Fred laughed at the image, yet when he noticed that George wasn’t laughing, he turned to him with a somewhat annoyed frown. “Hey, what is the matter with you?”
“No…”
The Dark Lord’s strange face reflected surprise for the seconds that the memory overtook him, but then it settled into an expression of slight disappointment and amusement. He shook his head, as if to state that Severus had been the one to overact while he remained unaffected. Had the mind reader not seen the memory of the violent man who was definitely not Albus, as he neither resembled Albus in silhouette, nor would Albus ever raise his fist against anyone, he would have believed the Dark Lord to not be affected in the least by him hitting his hand away.
Draco did not appear well.
Vince was going back home over the Holiday break, likely to spend time with the real Death Eaters who he belonged with. However, Pat couldn’t quite leave, as Professor Slughorn was organising a rather grand party over the break. He had already spoken about the people he was inviting from outside of school, and it was an impressive bunch. Famous authors, researchers and even Quidditch players were invited. Pat might have wanted to go home and sleep in her own bed, far away from the world of magic, but she couldn’t pass up on the opportunity of meeting real life Quidditch players.
Only Lucius had changed, and Arthur wanted to as well.
Late in the development of aristocratic feudal societies we believe that some of the ancient Pureblood families were aristocratic mages who served similar roles, and might even have protected the very vulnerable mages of the time.
He nodded in response and turned towards Harry, “he does indeed smell like a werewolf.”
Harry was further forced to denounce the name he wanted in favor of being referred to as Harry Potter during class, if he wanted to commit to the persona he was trying to uphold. It had been absolutely and horrifyingly wrong to correct every teacher in front of the students, telling them to call him Potter rather than Lupin. The strain on forcing the person Harry was not into reality was so heavy on him that Harry suffered from a collection of breakdowns during that week, ones he hid in his room to avoid anyone knowing about them. He knew that he could talk to his friends about it, but he found himself scared that they would convince him that he didn’t have to be Harry Potter to make a change. For the moment, Harry couldn’t stand the idea of being offered a way out when he couldn’t take it. When he had made up his mind to not take it.
it. And he grudgingly admitted to himself that he had probably
“Yeah, but I thought you were joking. I mean… You said you and Ginny…” Harry broke off, suddenly realizing that GINNY must have been an Alpha, too. The thought made his head spin.
Harry managed to sniffle himself to a stop, and pulled away from his best friend, nodding when she asked if he was okay. He looked at Rose, still sleeping soundly. He thought of a perfect, white-haired baby, sunlight filtering through high windows, shining off of long blond hair, a rose-covered gazebo, and devastated, storm-colored eyes that stared at him as he explained why he was marrying Ginny.
“Hm? Oh, yeah. Fine.” He said, looking back to Hermione. She looked all too knowing, and he didn’t doubt that despite not being able to smell him, she hadn’t forgotten what Malfoy was.
“With you… Your pheromones make me feel like I’m half in a rut already when we have sex. I imagine if I smelled you while I was in a rut, it would feel rather like jumping in front of the Hogwarts Express…”
A dull throbbing pulled his attention to his own body, and he looked himself over, seeing bruises and bitemarks littered across his skin. His fingers came up and he pressed them to the bruise he could feel but not see at the base of his neck. His eyes grew wide, but when he pulled his fingers away, there was no blood.
“Oh yes. You probably can’t smell it very well, since, well, it’s coming from you. But it does smell lovely. Almost like you were made to go together.” She said it wistfully, and Harry felt a shiver go up his spine at those words. He knew she was just being Luna, but the thought made a tingle of apprehension pass through him. He couldn’t quite place what bothered him so much about her rambling thoughts, though.
“No! I… I came back… I don’t want to start skipping class already!” He thought of how Hermione would have his head if he skived off their third week of school.
Harry was silent, turning those words over in his head. He compared what it had felt like to be on suppressants constantly, to now. The thought of no longer being able to read the Alphas as he could now, not being able to know when one was near made a tingle of anxiety thrill through him. It would feel like being blind, he thought, like losing an entire sense he hadn't known he even had. The thought of being so cut off from his pheromones again made him feel sick.
An elbow in his ribs brought his mind back to the present, and he realized that McGonagall was speaking again.
“Of course, Harry.” She answered with a smile. “Though, I suppose you just have, haven’t you?”
like cinnamon.
“He is. Maybe he should come nanny for me. Scorpius is a handful.” Malfoy mused, looking down at Rose thoughtfully. Harry glared at him. He knew that Malfoy had said it in front of Ginny, knowing he’d be unable to refuse without looking like a monster.
“No, it’s not too bad. Just surprising.” He admitted, feeling his cheeks go pink. He turned to Ron, curious. “He smelled… less than I thought he would.” It wasn’t a question, but Ron shrugged and answered anyway.
He turned, looked into familiar, burning eyes, and was thrown headfirst into memories. He'd hoped to put all recollection of this man from his mind, but at the sight of him, he could nearly still feel the warm hands on his skin, the short nails digging into his lower back, and slow, wet kisses that had left him breathless, and aroused.
The potions classroom was always warm. It always made him sweat a little to stand so close to the flames, to lean over a boiling cauldron. The trickle of sweat down his nape was entirely due to the heat of the room, the flames, the sweltering oppressive humidity that the potions were creating. The shiver up his back when the trace of spice wafted past his nose had nothing to do with Malfoy. The strange empty feeling inside him was due to hunger. He was sure.
“Being married make you soft, Potter?” The blond taunted, and Harry lifted himself from the breathless body to glare down at his newest guilt. Teasing silver eyes met his, and Harry felt his stomach lurch at the provocation that filled them. It’d been so long since he’d had sex at all, and even longer since he’d felt so intensely aroused. He’d finished too quickly. He wasn’t done with his lover yet, and it seemed Draco, though he’d also cum, wasn’t ready to quit.
“We weren’t talking. I slept there.” He sighed, and took a seat in a plush chair adjacent to the couch that Ginny occupied. He couldn’t bring himself to sit next to her just then.
As Draco stood, still in the bathroom doorway, Harry watched the hardon stiffen to its full length, and Draco’s eyes darken as he took three short steps into the room, to stand directly in front of Harry, who sat on the bed. Harry felt the frighteningly familiar thrill of power at being able to so easily arouse Malfoy. He looked up into stormcloud eyes and tried to fight the urge to pull Draco back onto the bed with him.
‘I’ve never smelled you before’ seemed a bit strange to say, so Harry shut his mouth instead.
“Hello, Harry. How have you been?” Luna was still smiling that wisp of a smile, but the way her eyes stared at Harry, almost
“Huh? Why?” Harry asked, leaning back, shuddering slightly as he felt the knot slip deeper into him. Draco made a noise as if he felt it, too, and his hands slid down Harry’s hips to squeeze at his thighs. He bit his lips and stared up at Harry, considering his answer before he spoke, eyes narrowed with suspicion.
“That’s what Hermione said, but… All night? What on earth were you talking about so long?” Ginny asked, crossing her arms petulantly. Harry swallowed nervously. He could beat around the bush, but it had never really been his style. He preferred the blunt approach.
The second door revealed a lavatory, small, intimate, with a sink, toilet, and standing shower. Maybe the extension charms only went so far, he thought to himself amusedly. He went back out to the sitting room and looked around more, seeing bookshelves to either side of the door, half-filled with quidditch and defense books, and half-filled with knick-knacks that Harry thought looks oddly familiar. He stared at one spindly silver gadget a moment before he could place it. It was one of the curiosities that had been in Professor Dumbledore’s office. He felt tears choke him up at the memory in such a strange place, and traced a finger over it, wondering what it did. At his touch, it let out a small puff of dark blue smoke. Harry gave a small sad smile and took a deep breath, pushing the emotion far back, where it couldn’t be seen. He went back out into the hall and plastered a huge smile on his face as he saw Ron standing at Hermione’s door, arguing to get in.
, but his face was lighter, suddenly more relaxed as his head fell back to the wall briefly.
"Sure." Harry muttered, sure she'd get to the point eventually. He sipped his tea, keeping an eye on the clock as they exchanged pleasantries. She made it three whole minutes before she finally came to something of substance.
anything. I hated it. I’d rather fuck you a thousand times over than feel like that ever again.”
sleeping with him for weeks, have you?”
“I’ll manage.” Harry insisted, thinking back to fifth year. His scar had hurt so much, then. Now, he wondered if this might just be worse.
“Scorpius, this is Harry Potter. Potter, this is my son.” Malfoy introduced, sitting the baby upright in his lap, for a more formal introduction. Harry grinned. He couldn’t help it. Babies always got right into his heart.
As he fell, exhausted and spent, into slumber, all the guilt he’d felt had vanished. He held Draco’s limp form in his arms, and for the first time in years, he felt peaceful. He knew tomorrow would be rough, filled with harsh emotions, but he didn’t care just then. For that moment, everything was perfect.
“Oh, er, yeah. Sorry. Anyway…” Harry tried to collect the jumble of his thoughts, what Luna had said, what Pomfrey had said, what Hermione had said. What Draco had said. “What do you think of… Draco? Do you think it’s a bad choice to… have sex with him?”
too. There really wasn’t a surplus of Alphas in his age group, he thought, catching a whiff of some underdeveloped hormones. They smelled almost like baby powder to him. Soft, fresh, and unappealing. He had laughed out loud at the fourth year Alpha that had tried to pheromone bomb him into a corner. He hadn’t even bothered to retaliate.
“Forgot to eat lunch.” He replied, rubbing a hand at the back of his neck, and wiped the dampness off on his robes.
“Yeah. It’s still really strange, actually.” Malfoy gave a small, private smile, and Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight. It was a loving smile, and one that made him long for the past. “Doesn’t feel quite real unless I’m holding him.”
“I’ve been wonderful. I was glad to see you’ve finally come out as an Omega. It’s good to be honest with yourself, you know.” Luna said, her smile stretching a bit wider for a moment. “I’m glad to see you and Draco are getting along better now.”
"Yeah, I mean, not really the Betas, but, all the Alphas and Omegas, yeah." Ron replied, looking even more sympathetic. Harry groaned. All the scents mixed together in the Great Hall had been starting to give him a headache. Ron's tangy scent was less potent than it had been the night before, and with just the gentle traces of it wafting around the room, Harry found it almost comforting. It wasn't overpowering, the way Malfoy's scent had been, and even though he was certain he'd never smelled it before, Ron smelled familiar,
Harry held the sleeping blond bundle, and sang in a whispered voice, letting the tiny face and even tinier breaths soothe his breaking heart. Here, at least, was one person who he could easily please.
idea how good you feel?” Malfoy groaned, biting at his earlobe. Harry couldn’t answer. Malfoy was all the way inside him, pressing into everything that made him want to fall apart. “Fuck… Harry…” The mutter was all he heard before Malfoy couldn’t stop himself from moving. The first few thrusts were slow, testing, and then he was slamming forward, as deep and fast as he could, grinding into Harry’s sweet spot with every thrust. Malfoy’s mouth was on his, sharp teeth pulling at his lower lip, nibbling at his tongue. Harry felt his whole body tense, and he came again, trembling under Malfoy’s unceasing force of pleasure. His pounding thrusts and biting teeth and squeezing hands made Harry come twice more before his pace slowed. Harry was limp, shaking, barely able to merely hold on to the savage Alpha that drove into him, but when he pulled out, Harry whined. Wordless, keening, and needy. Malfoy growled and bit his chest again. Harry cried out at the sudden sharp pain, but then Malfoy moved, pulling Harry around, lying down so Harry was on top, straddling him.
It would if he never left me alone again.” Harry tried to argue. Malfoy laughed, nuzzling his neck, nipping. Harry gasped, hands braced on the door for support as his knees threatened to collapse. It was
“The wife really didn’t come?” Malfoy asked, his warm smile changing to one of cunning and suspicion. Harry shook his head, and slowly approached, keeping his eyes down on the baby. He was so tiny! Smaller even than Rose, and he already had a head of white-blond hair. His dark blue baby eyes found Harry, and returned the big smile Harry gave him, gurgling happily up at him.
, but
Sweat trickled down Harry’s neck as he walked back down to lunch.
“No, I’m good.” Harry insisted, finally pulling his textbook out and opening it. The class fell into its usual bored silence, and Harry was glad for the time it gave him to straighten his thoughts, and try to emit just enough of his own pheromones to cover Smith’s, and more importantly, Malfoy’s. He wasn’t sure if it worked, but he noticed at least three people in class look at him with expressions ranging from curiosity to annoyance. He offered apologetic smiles, and ducked his head to his book. He wasn’t sure how long he could keep the ruse up, but he hoped his heat cycles evened out quickly. An arrangement with Malfoy could quickly become more trouble than it was worth…
“Not everyone has good intentions, Potter.” Malfoy breathed in a tired sigh. Suddenly, Harry thought about what might have happened if Malfoy was more interested in abusing his pheromones. If Harry was under his command. He shivered, and felt as if this version of Malfoy, the Alpha, wasn’t so bad. Harry thought about how he changed when he came near Harry in heat, how he seemed to lose control the same way Harry did. He almost felt guilty for steamrolling him with pheromones, but couldn’t feel too bad about it when Malfoy was clearly not displeased enough to take suppressants. Harry felt his curiosity rise, and it refused to be pushed away.
“Molly,” Andromeda spoke gently but firmly, “you have to talk to him. I’d normally advocate for all kinds of alternative solutions but it’s been years. You truly need to. I wish I could pretend that I believe in other options, but at this point, I think you need to hear the truth.”
“Do you think that… Do you think that the Ministry might turn towards werewolves next?” The son of a werewolf was too aware of the predicament of those infected with Lycanthropy to ignore the fact that most mages considered werewolves to be dangerous by default, but also prone to Dark Magic. He knew well that throughout history, the minorities without a clear place in society tended to be the ones to lose their rights first, and who weren’t listened to when they attempted to speak up against it.
The phrase was haunting Percy’s mind, appearing when he least expected it.
“It proves that somebody loves me,” Lavender objected, almost meekly.
I cannot answer in anything other than hiccups, sobs and nods, all of which come out rather at the same time, making me appear quite the buffoon. What dignity do I have left after having cried in front of the entire school in the Great Hall.
“Lupin,” Ngo-Kwang corrected her. She then appeared surprised that she had, as if the response had been automatic and she couldn’t hold it back.
“Too far?” Draco’s voice asked from somewhere within the covers. Harry thought that he could see the outline of his blonde hair silhouetted against the dark pillow.
“How about just chocolate then? You could probably get some raisings by the side to try it out if you’d like.” I offer him my hand and we walk back downstairs together.
“Uh… there… there is…!” Goyle continued to gesture as he pointed this way and that.
“Still,” Harry agreed in a quiet voice. “I do like you. Probably more than a friend, but I don’t think I’m ready for another boyfriend, not when I’m unable to stop comparing any boyfriend to my relationship with Draco. However, that makes me feel like I’m using you for my own gain. It’s not that you couldn’t possibly compare to Draco, but right now, I don’t think I could have another boyfriend without contrasting you with Draco.”
It wasn’t that he had no family, his closest friends and the Weasleys were very much family to him, and had become his family, but he couldn’t quite connect to the feeling of being bound to someone… Perhaps there was no difference. Narcissa looked no different from Hermione’s face upon finding that he was alive after the battle, maybe he had just been overthinking it. He really would have to think deeper about that at some point.
Harry, Hermione and Neville nodded.
“You will have to show me that later,” Draco nodded at Harry, then returned his attention to Kreacher. “There is now a snake in the terrarium in Harry’s room. She is expected to be fed, and I want you to make certain that there is food prepared for her. You are not to feed her while Harry is at home, but should he be unable to, you are to care for the snake in his stead. Understood?” Draco was clearly used to handling servants, he naturally began issuing orders like he did to his own House Elf and servants. Harry was a little taken aback by the formalness and almost aristocratic air which was evident in his boyfriend, even if he had seen it many times before.
“Air sounds nice,” Neville agreed.
“Thank you, that would be great,” Chang smiled and nodded at her. “I won’t let you down, Captain.”
“I wasn’t given any ink.” Harry spoke up in a barely audible mutter.
Harry leaned back against the sofa with a deep sigh before he smiled at Luna. “People want me to be all these... things, and they are always telling me who I look like and who I remind them of. That isn’t necessarily bad, but at the end of the day, the person I see in the mirror is me. Not James Potter, not Regulus Black, not Harry Potter. I don’t even see my own dad, I’m just Harry. And I get to decide who Harry is, even if other people decide that I’m something else, that doesn’t make them right.” He finished with a shrug and a smile.
“Some people are happier like that, but I do agree with you.” Draco’s gaze found Harry’s and he smiled weakly, honestly and lovingly. “It’s been good to know that you haven’t been isolated and alone this year.”
Remus covered his ears, curling together as he pressed his head to the floor, magic all forgotten as he suffered from the fallback which came with seeing Greyback once more. With seeing the beast who had infected him.
Between the two of them, Ron held a very cheesy sandwich, which he was showing to Neville in an attempt to prove that his mum’s cooking was not ideal to maintain the figure he was striving for. The first exhibit in that argument was the very cheesy sandwich which Ron presented to his friend.
“You forgot to give me ink.” He tried once again to reason with her, despite becoming increasingly annoyed by the childish behavior. Even Sirius had never been this bad, and he had pretended to be an animal to get out of unpleasant situations.
the time? Even when we were meant to be on dates, you’d burst out into the old ‘Malfoy looked suspicious today’ or ‘Malfoy didn’t say anything to me in the hall today.’”
Harry’s curiosity was piqued.
Warmth spread through Harry’s chest. He put his glass down and met George’s gaze.
"What in Merlin’s name are you thinking?" Draco hissed.
“I mean it though,” Ginny frowned. “That I want you to get along. Blaise and I – we’ve talked about marriage. And if it
“I reckon there’s more to let out,” he laughed weakly. He ran a hand through his greasy hair and said, “Fuck...how did this even happen?"
Draco’s watch was still on his wrist, thankfully.
“Of course,” Draco said seriously. “That’s what normal people do.”
“Yes, I did,” Draco confessed. “I feel…bad about what happened, and I suppose I wanted to clear the air.”
He gave Draco a sad smile, and Draco’s heart ached. Why couldn’t Draco just be
Harry wasn’t sure how long he’d been in that position, trying to hold back sobs, before he heard muffled footsteps stalking away. When he did, though, there was no use in attempting to stem the tears. He let out a choked sob as he pictured Ginny walking away, leaving Harry (like she should, like he deserved). He
“That mysterious bloke, Draco,” she said, grinning as she nodded at Malfoy, who was across the room. “It’d be fun, wouldn’t it?”
“And you slept well?”
Harry opened his eyes and raked a trembling hand through his hair. Barely aware of what he was doing, he stood and walked into his bedroom. Stopping by his bedside table, his hands searched automatically for the photo album Hagrid had given him so many years ago. It was buried at the bottom of the drawer.
“Hey, Harry,” said Ron, where he was still sitting at the table. “Malfoy, you came too, huh?”
Harry shrugged when Cait looked at him. “I got too ambitious. Anyway, I’ve really got to get home, I’m knackered…”
Draco took them from the landing to the kitchen. He set everything down on the island and examined the coffees.
“Rubbish. You’re brilliant, George, and that’s what makes you successful,” he said firmly.
“I didn’t until now, though I had guessed…” Blaise said. At the look on Draco’s face, he smiled and said, “Calm down, I’m not going to tell Pansy.” Blaise considered him a moment, the smile still playing at his lips. “Potter, hm? He is handsome…a stubborn Gryffindor, but still, I can see the appeal.”
Malfoy looked at him with something that
“I count on my friends to do nice things for me,” Potter said. “Like you, and Hermione. You remind me of her, actually. You’re tall and white and a man, but still.”
“I’m going to make myself coffee,” Draco said, breaking the silence. He looked round at Potter, who was standing uncomfortably near the table in the center of the room. “Would you like anything?”
He did so, savoring the way the hot water pounded on his knotted shoulders. He exited his bathroom after clothing himself, pushing his damp hair out of his face as he made his way to the kitchen. His one-bedroom flat was certainly different than his childhood home, but he liked it very much. It’d become home after all these years, and Merlin knew Draco needed a new one.
to show all of them to her. It had to be at least a couple of hundreds of pounds’ worth.
“Yeah, she did.”
“Not that great, Malfoy,” Potter said evenly.
“Good, yeah.” He hesitated, then said, “Thanks. For forcing me to talk about it. I, er, probably wouldn’t’ve otherwise and I guess I needed it.”
“You’re,” Draco said, his voice coming out in shallow breaths. “
“Nothing,” Harry said. He held out his hand again. “Come on.”
“Harry.”
“This happened yesterday?”
“Harry, what the hell were you thinking, asking if I could go to – what is it, anyway?”
“Good morning, Mr. Potter. Betty, what’s happened?”
They were in the middle of taking a sip and finished before replying.
“I liked it too,” a white woman agreed, nodding. Her mousy brown hair had streaks of grey in it, and there were tired bags underneath her eyes. “I’ll have to remember it so I can use it at home.”
“You’re mental anyway and it’d be easy,” Harry told himself, retrieving his glasses and shoving them on his face. “But you shouldn’t. You’d disappoint everyone. Again.”
“I dunno,” he said, pushing Malfoy out of his mind. He tried to think of what
"My feelings are rather muddled, too. But there's still a time and place."
Instead, he settled for shaking his head and telling Potter that he was unbelievable.
. A few moments later, Harry came too, his body shaking and shuddering underneath Draco’s. Draco pulled out, his chest rising and falling, his fingers trembling as he released his hold on Harry. He zipped himself back up with effort.
“Yeah, uh, don’t say anything to her, alright?” Ron asked.
She flushed in response. “Thank you – erm, I mean, you’re welcome, Healer Malfoy.”
Before Harry could say anything more, Draco kissed him.
He felt horror and shock and disgust wash over him, like all his emotions had just been stuck behind some wall but the dam broke and he was finally absorbing it all – the numbness was gone and in its place was all these emotions, painfully visceral and overwhelming. And now, finally, he realized just how much he’d fucked up, just how
“No, you don’t,” Draco smirked at him.
“Well, you were right,” Harry grumbled.
Startled back to the present and faced again with the now properly-buttoned Malfoy, Harry cleared his throat and told him no.
“Yeah,” Draco breathed out shakily. “Wow.”
It was five in the morning when he woke up again.
Draco’s breath caught in his throat. A year ago, he would have pulled Leonel into his office where they’d have sex, rough and quick. But now, he didn’t know what to do.
“Mr. Potter, sir, is you looking for a snack, sir?”
“No, not embarrassing. Cute,” Harry said. He was definitely smiling now - Draco was relieved to see it. “Merlin, I never knew.”
“Oh, good,” muttered Draco.
She did, and within minutes the two of them had opened every window in the flat.
“We checked on him at seven and again an hour ago. He’s doing as well as can be expected,” Betty said once Leonel had finished his bit. “His vitals are fine, considering, but he’s shaking terribly and he said he vomited a few times during the night. It’s all in his file.”
“I guess you’re also a Slytherin, so it makes sense there too.” Sirius nodded to himself.
Professor Slughorn sat silent for a while before he slowly began to speak honestly as well. “You… are the very image of Tom Riddle, the man who would later become he-who-must-not-be-mentioned.”
“I don’t think it would be any good in a life or death situation, but most people don’t have to worry about those very often,” the smile on Draco’s lips was still there, yet it had become somewhat bitter.
“But this isn’t about me,” my son insists. “Are you trying to switch focus to-”
Harry and Draco separated from each other as if they had been burnt, their earlier desire completely smothered by fear. Draco was furthest into the room, and his cane had fallen to the floor. He was essentially trapped.
“I should think at the very least up towards 100 galleons to 500 galleons, with additional costs for maintenance,” Severus answered simply. “Yet overall, the gesture is considered paranoid, as there truly are not that many mind readers. It could perhaps be described as purchasing insurance for your tavern when you do not own a tavern.”
“Secret boyfriend?” Harry leaned closer and bumped his nose against Draco’s cheek, eager and honest.
Professor Slughorn fumbled with a button on his coat as he looked at something else which most certainly caught his attention so completely that he couldn’t pay attention to Neville. Neville waited.
Draco considered the proposal, then took a look around them before he nodded, quickly and shortly. “Yes… It’s a bit of a risk, but as long as we are careful…”
“You could always make it green to suit your Slytherin lifestyle,” Harry helpfully instructed his boyfriend from behind his hand. This was a new, yet not entirely unexpected side of Draco. Harry enjoyed it to some degree. He certainly enjoyed it for the moment.
“That really doesn’t matter either,” Harry scolded the man softly. “It doesn’t matter why you do good things, if the things you do are good for real rather than seeming good. It also doesn’t matter if your intentions are good if the consequences are bad. There can be circumstances, explanations and forgiveness for bad actions, but having good intentions isn’t an excuse to continue causing harm. There is no good or evil, there are only actions and consequences. Positive and negative ones. Not everyone will agree with me on that, but the truth is that you have helped many people throughout your years. You have saved lives. That is worth something, even if you failed to raise your son in the manner you should have.”
“Hi Harry,” Neville bent over to hug him. “You look great.”
“I was… and still am,” Harry’s gaze had been looking for Draco after the Magical History class, but he hadn’t been able to spot him. He had in fact been listening to his friend all along, but his attention was elsewhere despite him wanting to be better. “I’m sorry to hear that you miss Ron, have you talked to him about wanting to spend time together?”
“Come inside,” Umbridge called through the door.
Their guest room consisted of a square space with a bathroom connected to it. There was a wardrobe, a fireplace and a desk, both of which were no doubt older than Remus yet far sturdier than he. The most notable piece of furniture was the canvas bed which was large enough for two people, yet not overly grand. It was very soft, almost too soft for the man who was far more used to his bed being hard, although not really hard in an unpleasant manner.
“Pardon me, si-, Albus, but that is rather an ignorant statement,” Harry gathered his courage and spoke up. “It is true that Tom, I mean, the Dark Lord might not have risen and started a war, but the Pureblood ideals are a little too prominent in the British mage community to simply ignore. They have the most money, and they are the most focused on their heirs and the next generations. It’s rather ignorant to think that there would never have been a war, if only the Dark Lord didn’t rise when he did.”
“Oh my. Are you experiencing a heat presently?” She asked, pulling him to sit on a bed at the end of a row, as far from the doors as possible. She pulled the curtains around them, and Harry knew now that they were warded against eavesdropping. He relaxed slightly.
"Not even a little. I never told anyone, but… he showed up to my wedding.  I'd thought he'd understand, that we were friends, but… I was sooo wrong. He was furious. Pretended to be all cheery and even congratulated me, until he got me alone. I thought he was going to curse me, or Ginny, or…. Set the place on fire. He was out of control. I was actually a little scared of him, of what he'd do, or say. But… he just screamed a lot. He tried to get me to call the whole thing off, tried to get me to… um… anyway, I didn't, and… he left, and… I didn't see him again until this past Friday." Harry felt a heat in his face, and a pricking behind his eyes. A moment later, a sniffle escaped him. Hermione practically jumped to her feet, and darted around the baby and the table, and wrapped her arms around him, smothering him in comfort, and the scent of family. Harry tried to push her away, tried to hold back his stupid, uncalled for tears. Neither worked, and in moments, he found himself sobbing into her chest with his arms wrapped around her. He felt like a giant baby, sniffling and bawling, but as he cried, and tormented himself with memories of a perfect white smile, glittering silver eyes, and a furious, jealous explosion of platinum and alabaster, cloaked in black, BEGGING him not to do it, he felt relieved. At last, he wasn't the only one carrying the knowledge. Hermione knew. He knew. Draco knew. Draco's wife had known before she died. By the laws of probability, he knew more people were bound to find out. One person could keep a secret. Four people was an uncontainable leak. It felt as if the secret was already out. All that was left was damage control. His life was already miserable, he couldn't imagine how it could get worse, except, maybe, if Malfoy left again.
Severus could only imagine how the other man wanted him to feel guilt for his relationship to Albus, which simply wouldn't be happening. While there were a great deal of matters which plagued Severus' conscience, such a thing would not have a place there.
When the world finally stopped spinning, he spoke, “has he come to you with wounds?”
Somehow, the teenagers were alive. Sirius might not have survived the battle, and Draco was likely to be scarred for life, but at the very least, they were alive. What later became known as the Death Eaters’ attack on the Ministry of Magic of 1996, was over. The casualties might have been minor in terms of numbers, yet the loss of Sirius Potter could not be considered minor by any means, not to the people involved.
“Lucius!” Bellatrix yelled at the empty spot as she jumped to her feet.
I feel a throb of guilt in my chest, causing me to avoid his gaze yet again. I was correct in feeling as if he could see right through me as if the skin and bones around my mind were simple glass panels. I bite my lower lip to keep from answering in an unpleasant manner. When I feel secure enough that I will not bite towards him, I answer.
“Muggle, yes…” he nodded before he continued to speak. “It was a curious, yet happy time. As you know, Euphemia worked hard and often, and I would come to have long periods of work as well. Hogwarts was a very good choice for our living situation, and we were both relieved to know that James would have plenty of friends and food at his school, rather than having to remain lonely in this house. As you know, he met you and your friends, as well as his future wife. When he brought you home after you ran away from your family, we were surprised, yet had no trouble whatsoever financially to welcome you to our home.”
The group of friends exchanged glances before beginning to laugh merrily once again. They all enjoyed being back together again, with everyone being there in a safe environment which in some aspects reminded of Hogwarts.
There was another shift and Harry found himself even further away from the closed door and his wounded dad. He looked down the corridor upon the steel door with the cruel handle and noticed the sign upon the wall which spelled out ‘Department of Mysteries’ in white letters upon a black plate. Harry felt as if he couldn’t breathe, as if his head was being squeezed too tightly for the rest of his body to function and then it was over, and Harry found himself standing in the middle of the Room with everyone’s gaze upon him.
“It was a long time ago, and it wasn't exactly your fault even if what you did wasn't alright,” Harry assured him with a weak smile. “I’d rather not remember it either.”
“Really?” Dobby straightened his clothes, still smiling. “You’re much too young for me, Harry.”
“How kind,” the Dark Lord’s body appeared to be falling asleep, despite what his mind wanted. He was evidently exhausted from his defective body as well as the duel with his own father. As Severus carefully shut the door behind himself, the Dark Lord was already asleep.
Albus stared at him before shaking his silvery head in a weak objection. “That is one of the few things I cannot understand… Tom was never a Pureblood. He never believed in those ideals, and he was only obsessed with his own blood because he wanted to find his family. Or rather, the family which abandoned him. No matter how I think it over, I do not understand why he would want to eradicate the Muggle-born population. He should know, he should understand better.” At the very least, he appeared to be calming down somewhat as he clutched his necklace to his chest.
There was ice cream on the line, after all.
Harry was feeling a lot of things in regards to hearing how his dad had come to earn a partner in his youth. Almost too many, which was why he wanted to focus on something more concrete than the general happiness and soothing relief which filled him. He needed a more direct outlet for his feelings than to simply be happy.
Sirius was such a huge presence that he couldn’t possibly just disappear without any kind of impact on the entire world. Without Sirius, how could the world still remain standing as if nothing had happened? It was impossible that he would just leave and that the world would keep on spinning.
He came to realise that Arthur was good at speaking.
Kreacher met his gaze before yet again turning to the cup before him. “Kreacher concluded based on the fact that Remus remains with an unstable and slightly psychotic former prisoner in an abandoned home, rather than with trusted family members.”
Harry looked up from the newspaper and past the people in the Great Hall, looking towards the teachers’ table. Severus wasn’t there. Harry knew without a second thought that there would be no Potions classes that day, as Severus must have left Hogwarts to be with Remus.
, which, according to Sirius, was the only book worth his time in his family library. Harry found this to be untrue, as the library did have a copy of
. The page spoke of a mirror of… erised? Harry wasn’t sure how to pronounce the word. He wasn’t sure how to pronounce a lot of words, he learned most of them through reading, rather than conversation. According to the book, the mirror would show the viewer what they desired most. Harry wondered what he might have seen if he looked into the mirror. Would it be his parents? Alive and well? There was no way of knowing for sure.
Hope you enjoyed!
"What do you mean,
"Father." He greeted him with a curt smile, remaining stiff as he walked into the embrace.
The attendance flew past in a blur. As usual, when Harry's name was called, people stared, even the teacher, who had added a snarky remark. As the teacher, Professor Snape, as Harry had learned, began his introductory lecture, Harry furiously scribbled down notes. He would be diligent and studious. A few ink splotches fell on his parchment as Harry was still getting used to the sensation of writing with a quill. His attention was called to the front of the room as his name was called. He looked up, his green eyes watching the teacher as he continued.
“About the size of my hand, I reckon. Why?”
Hermione seemed to think that the theory was preposterous, “No — he wouldn’t.“I know he’s not very nice, but he wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe."
“Do you have any idea what my father would do if he found out you had an invisibility cloak? He’s not really a good person.”
Harry sat down, "Do you think Ron would still want to be my friend, even if I'm a Slytherin?"
Harry frowned, "You aren't mad?"
Harry gulped and turned back to look at the furious professor, "I just wondered if I could have my book back."
Draco quickly retracted his hand, spinning around to see the mud- no-
Harry felt pressure squeezing his right leg, and looked up, only to be met with Draco's icy eyes. Draco backed away, smirking, cheeks tinting red a little bit from the laughter.
"Stupid mudblood..." The Slytherin girl sneered.
“Draco!” He burst out suddenly, interrupting the long-standing silence.
Draco's face turned red, "Fine. Let me clean up first. It's a mess."
He hoped Harry would forgive him.
"Yeah. Okay. Got it. Yep!" Harry confirmed.
"So what if I am? It's better than being a Malfoy. Your father's a Death Eater!" Ron retorted.
Draco's face grew red, and he bristled. The hall grew silent.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, ”Yeah, but I thought it would be-” he glanced at the muggle-born, ”alone.”
"The letter my aunt and uncle will get when I'm sent home for being a distraction."
Draco hacked out a bit of toast into the sink before grimacing, ”Y-yeah, let's just go.”
"What, exactly, were you thinking? An absolutely terrible idea to come up with. Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter, I'm afraid-"
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
"Yes, dear?"
"Get out!
His housemates didn't know what to do at first. Not one of them had gotten onto the Hogwarts Express, suspecting that the Chosen One would be living in the green-lit dungeon alongside them. However, they soon got used to the mass of untidy black hair and mostly ignored him unless his scar was showing. He looked just like everyone else, for the most part. He was, however, the only one with eyeglasses, which perplexed him quite a bit.
Draco quickly went to hide the packaging, which had the return address along with a note on it, “Oh, there wasn’t one. Must have been a pra-”
"Is there... any reason why?" He questioned hesitantly, breathing shaking a bit as he paused.
Harry nodded, "The stairs- they're so confusing!"
His hopes slowly deflated as class drudged on, proving that wizarding history was just as dull as muggle history. He found himself creating a new narrative, one much more magical and exciting. The visuals started to flood into his mind, a battle of dragons and trolls-
"Oh, like I care about your little cat fight. Potter- what is that?" The greasy man reached his hand out for the book in Harry's lap.
He found himself staring at Draco's hands as they moved to set out his cloak, undershirt, and green tie. They looked to be about the same size, so if Draco thought his hands were huge, wouldn't that make his own big as well? He debated bringing this topic up, the thought coming to an abrupt stop as the alarm stopped ringing. Everyone else was awake, and Harry scrambled for his robes.
"I've no idea why people think Slytherin is the bad house," She remarked, shocking the boy, "If anyone actually bothered to read, they would know that each house produces about the same amount of dark wizards, save Hufflepuff, but it's the fact that Slytherins are so ambitious that they are the most noticed. I hope the stigma ends soon now that you're in Slytherin," Harry tried to interject, but she kept going. "Yes, I know all about you, even though I'm a muggle-born," Harry didn't even know that- "You're in almost all of the history books, though still, nobody knows how exactly you survived Voldemort, I do have a theory about your scar! Would you like to hear it?"
"He knows something, Potter."
"Don't matter now, don't it? Nothin' was stolen!"
"Calm down, Potter."
Ron. The lanky ginger stared at him before walking right past him. Harry gulped before continuing. At least Ron wasn't glaring at him anymore. A few moments of quiet deliberation later, he found that he was outside. He hadn't meant to, of course, but it was lovely out, and Potions wasn't for another hour. His gaze traced the rim of the central fountain, marveling at the smooth stone. His cycle was interrupted when a cloak blocked the rock below. He led his gaze upwards towards the mane of frizzy brown hair, the face covered with a thick book. He stepped toward the student, a Gryffindor, judging by her robes.
“So?”
“Uh,” Draco looked around, disappointed to find that he had already procrastinated as much as he could, “I could save it for later. Don’t want to be too greedy, yeah?”
"But someone tried to steal something. Nobody tries to rob Gringotts."
Harry looks forward to the Quidditch game of the season as Draco and Hermione meet to teach him about the sport. A shocking revelation comes to light about a certain professor, and Draco seems to suspect that one of Harry's closest friends may be behind something sinister.
"Everyone."
. He stepped off the train, bracing himself to see his father again.
He sat beside the blonde, smiling at his additional two friends, Pansy and Blaise. At least, he considered them to be friends. They didn't insult or glare at him, at least. He looked up as he heard the sound of flapping wings, eyes snagging on an owl he recognized as Azazel, Draco's owl. The owl dropped two letters, one in front of Draco, and one in front of Harry.
The ginger and the blonde stared at each other.
Harry hurried after him.
It was not going to be fine, but Harry didn't need to know that. As cute- as
"Like you could understand, you're just a-" Draco glanced at Harry for a moment, "Erm, you're just a bookworm. To truly understand you need to play the game- not read about it."
Harry could hear the scratching of quills against parchment. Draco raised his hand.
"We're going to get in so much trouble, Draco."
Remember that even though this is a slow burn, Harry gets comfortable with Draco rather quickly, courtesy of not having friends before.
Ron just raised his eyebrows, a knowing smirk crossing his face. Why was he okay with it? Something had to be wrong.
“Ron? As in Ronald Billius Weasley?”
The class flew by, the resulting potion being a lump of grey goo rather than the smooth silver liquid it was meant to be.
The dormitory door creaked as it swung open, revealing the two boys. It was nearing lunchtime, and Harry was apologizing profusely for Draco having missed his morning mail.
He walked out of the hall, bumping into someone, "Oh, sorry about that-"
Harry didn't even have to answer, just give her a glimpse of a smile, "I studied the killing curse, and I discovered that your scar is the shape in which a wand moves when casting it!"
"Troll in the dungeons!" a voice boomed out, and Harry traced it back to an unconscious Professor Quirrell.
"Seriously, Malfoy? You're just like my cousin," Harry shook his head, disappointed, at Malfoy.
"So, it's true then?" A voice snapped him from his thoughts, "Harry Potter is going to Hogwarts this year. It's you, then?"
Wait. He shouldn't say that- Harry would be upset.
Quidditch.
Harry picked up the piece of parchment delicately, savouring the rough feeling between his fingertips. He flipped it over, grinning when he saw Hagrid’s messy signature at the bottom of the note.
Draco pursed his lips self-consciously, "Okay, so I may have heard something about a three-headed dog. I didn't know that it had anything to do with the school, though."
Harry frowned, going to give it to Draco, but he saw his name written in thin cursive letters on the front. He glanced at Draco, who signed in approval. So this was for him. He tried his best to open it without tearing the envelope it was in and managed to do well until the very last moment. Nevertheless, it was open, and Harry pulled the letter out.
Mrs. Malfoy stopped in a few times, offering the boys hot chocolate. Harry had refused at first. He was clumsy and near books; He didn’t want to ruin them. Mrs. Malfoy gently reminded him that even if it were possible to damage the books (which were enchanted), a simple spell would fix them up right away. Harry eventually gave in to the kind gesture, and marveled at the fact that the cocoa was burning hot but not damaging his mouth. He then reminded himself that: duh,
Draco held out his hand, and Hagrid looked at it for a moment before taking it, "'Ullo Draco."
Madam Hooch crouched beside Neville, her expression as grim as his, "Broken wrist. Come on, boy... it's all right, up you get," She stood, turning to the class, "None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are, or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."
"Guarding something? I dunno, let's go to bed."
Harry frowned. It came to his realization that where Draco had once stood was now a bitter bully.
Harry looked at him, confused, "Yeah, I thought you knew."
“No, no… I know who he is, I just…” Draco sighed as Harry frowned in confusion, “Father always told me that he was no good. Dangerous and stupid.” He braced himself for his friend’s uproar, only to be pleasantly surprised.
"It'll be
His father's gaze seemed to soften, "Well, of
Once they had reached the fated corridor, they had slowed to a snail pace, their hands still clasped as they waited for their 'most horrible death' that had been promised to them. Nothing happened.
!" Snape demanded.
"Indeed I do, Potter."
"HUFFLEPUFF!"
”A faggot?”
"I hope you adjusted okay. I hope Draco helped?"
Harry sprinted away to tell Draco about the encounter, hoping that maybe his father could get his book back- and also that he knew what Snape was talking about with three heads.
Hagrid sniffed, "I say it don't matter. Now, just enjoy yer tea!"
”Nope! You and Hermione are teaching me.” He seemed oblivious to the tension between the other two.
"The third-floor corridor. You know, the one where we're not allowed to go?"
”I'm sorry, ” Harry apologized, breaking the slice of toast in half and offering a piece to Draco.
Hagrid frowned, glancing at his bare wrist, "Oh, look at the time! Ye should prolly go and do some 'omework or somethin'!"
"Yes, I am. Who are you?"
Harry frowned, "This is your room?"
"I'm not sure what it was, it was just about the size of my hand, and it was the only thing in the vault," He paused, "A really big vault."
"Ron! Hermione got me this book about the history of Qui-"
"Okay, so you can't show that you're human; how does that excuse you acting like such a jerk?"
Just a lil check in
hit him.
"Where are your parents?" Harry scrambled across the carriage to look out the window.
Harry glanced at Ron, then trudged up the stairs as gasps scattered throughout the great hall. Professor McGonagall set the hat on his head.
“My birthday,” Harry answered, a bit confused.
"My head..." He hissed out, "It feels like it's burning..."
"I was just wondering how you were adjusting? I heard you lived with muggles before you came to Hogwarts."
. Now he was downstairs. Alone. Opening his presents while Harry was upstairs in his room opening presents. Draco wasn’t exactly alone, though. He just wished he was. Especially since he recognized this wrapping pattern as the same pattern on one of Harry’s presents. The present from the Weasley family.
? How could you
Draco glowed and waved at Harry as he ran towards the Slytherin table. Harry applauded, cheering for him, but his heart sunk. Ron would be in Gryffindor. He would have to pick.

He looked fearfully into his father’s gaze, knowing exactly what was coming. He knew exactly what was happening before it hit him. Before
"Hagrid, this is my friend, Draco." Harry pulled away from the hug, smiling.
Mrrrow
"Oh. Oops," Harry couldn't see why it was so important.
"So," Hagrid grunted as he took a seat at his table stacked with rock cakes and cups of tea, "'ow's yer week been goin', Harry?"
Harry froze, the red draining from his face, "That was the vault we got the... thing from."
“Well, I’ve met him, and he isn’t like that at all! He’s very nice, and he’s one of the smartest people I know! Professor Dumbledore even trusted him to make a withdrawal from his own personal bank vault!” Harry assured him, “Maybe your dad is wrong. We all make mistakes, you know.”
Harry glanced to his left. Ron was glaring at him. He tried not to take it too personally, but it still hurt. Why couldn't he just be himself without calling attention? Half the world loved him for being Harry Potter, and the other half hated him, and, well...
"Oh! Sorry!" Harry blushed, how stupid could he be?
Ron snorted.
The banquet that evening was colorful and splendid. Harry gorged himself on turkey and pumpkin pasties as the tension between Draco and Blaise tightened across the table. Draco and Harry hadn't spoken of the earlier events, both deeming it too awkward to approach. Questions sat on the tip of Harry's tongue, but he just swallowed them down in favor of ignorance.
Blaise shook his head, letting out one final snort before explaining, "Honestly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you were a faggot."
He shoved his covers off of him and sat on the edge of his bed, looking at the sleeping forms of his dormmates. He slipped a pair of slippers on that he had stolen from Dudley and stood. He crept to the door and pushed it open, walking through the common room before exiting the Slytherin Dorms completely.
"There you are!" A voice piped up from behind.
Harry's eyes centered on the strange object immediately; It reminded him of a crystal ball like one would see on the telly, but it was smaller. It could fit in the hand of the boy who held it, and as Harry drew his gaze upwards, he recognized him as Neville Longbottom.
They were blue at the moment, their color nearly as deep as the ocean under a sunny sky. They always seemed to be changing, though. While he had deep blue eyes now, they could be a brown color in only a couple hours from now. He imagined them to be, at default, this blue color. He had recently woken, and his eyes weren't exposed to any stimuli quite yet, so this had to be their real natural state, right?
Draco watched as Harry left the hall, getting up to follow him when Zabini blocked him, "Leave it, Draco."
"No? I mean, she asked if you helped me adjust, but that's all. Why?" Harry frowned.
The previous Charms lessons had all lead up to this one, where they would actually be attempting the levitation charm. Harry struggled the first few times, much to his dismay, but he eventually got it. Ron struggled as well, but finally got help from Hermione, much to his dismay.
"Okay, now just come out a few seconds after me, okay?" Draco ordered, placing his hands firmly on Harry's shoulders, nearly toppling the boy.
No, he didn't. He didn't know anything about Harry. He didn't know how he faltered in his steps every time the stairs moved, staring in wonder. He didn't know how his hands were always covered in ink because he didn't know how to hold a quill. He didn't know that his son had held those hands.
"Wh-? But-" Harry glanced over at Ron, who had been listening in.
Harry's eyes flickered with confusion. Of course, it would be friendship, what else could it be? Before he could continue this internal consideration, Draco spoke again.
Grammarly says it sounds anxious.
"I'm off ter the Great Hall," The half-giant cleared his throat, "Have ye seen the Christmas decorations yet?"
"Stop apologizing, dear. You're doing wonderfully." She gestured to the guest bed, "May I sit?"
"Up!" The class chanted.
Harry grumbled as he emerged from the bathroom, turning to find Draco waiting for him outside the entrance. Draco looked up, and Harry smiled. Now his eyes were green, very like the lights of the dungeon they were in.
Harry gulped, hoping that he could remember what page he was on, "Sor-"
"Well, considering it was in a very high-security vault, then yeah, probably." Hagrid's note had been set aside, forgotten as Harry tried to think about what could be inside that package that Hagrid had retrieved.
"What?" Harry was thrown off by the sudden turn of conversation topic, "I dunno, maybe Hagrid?"
The Gryffindors were late. Harry stood stiffly next to Draco, unsure about their friendship status at the moment. His gaze slipped as a flash of red stood in contrast to the lush field.
Harry watched as the marble was tossed into the air, and everything seemed to go in slow motion. He raced backward, eyes staying focused on the ball as it glistened in the sunlight. He slid across the grass, the blades scratching against his leg. The marble landed in his right hand, much to his surprise. He was never much for sports, or at least he never had a chance to be.
“Holy shit.”
"Library? Didn't know you four were so gungho about studyin'!" The half-giant chuckled.
Draco has a solution for Harry's scar predicament
"First in the ingredient stores, sir, but if it weren't there, I would look in the stomach of a goat, sir. Though I would hope that it would be in the ingredient stores, given as it cures most poisons, sir."
"The thing?" Draco raised his eyebrow.
Dinner that night was uneventful, in Harry’s opinion. The dining table was large, and Draco had insisted on Harry sitting across from him. Harry agreed, still confused as to why the dining table looked large enough to seat about 30 people. Everybody was distant, both physically and emotionally. Hardly a word was uttered, and Harry appreciated it. At least the Dursleys weren’t berating him. Draco was right about the library- Harry saw books that went into detail into things that the books in the restricted section hardly even touched upon. Harry had brought up asking Mr. Malfoy, but Draco quickly knocked down that idea, insisting that he was busy and it was best not to bother him. So Draco and Harry resorted to searching the library themselves, Draco going through the title of each book and handing books that had a chance to mention Nicholas Flamel to Harry so that he could read it.
"What about Nicholas Flamel?" Harry reminded him.
"The Quidditch match is starting soon." Hermione said, brushing off the theory.
Pansy smirked, "A bold claim, considering Dumbledore's still up and kicking."
"What if Snape is after the thing in that vault?"
“Told you,” Draco said, and Harry snorted.
as he looked when flustered, Draco didn't want him to worry about
"And then that bludger went-"
"Hello, Mrs. Malfoy. I didn't see you there, ma'am. My apologies." He fixed his posture quickly, clasping his hands together in his front.
"Uh... right... there." Draco pointed to two vague figures in the distance, the only distinguishing feature being the platinum blonde hair that rested on the tops of their heads.
"Three heads, huh?"
The ball turned a red smokey color, and he turned to Draco, "What exactly is that?"
Hermione sped off, leaving the boys alone with the professors in the bathroom.

pacing swiftly towards him and Harry.
"I thought that was you!"
I have a tumblr now- theforbiddencouple-official.tumblr.com !
The air seemed bitterly crisp in the dungeon, despite the water of the lake keeping them humid. Draco sat next to Harry as they did their homework, but Draco found himself distracted for multiple reasons. The first was the fact that Harry's arm kept brushing up against his as he wrote. The second was that his friends-
He slid into the seat next to the redhead, muttering, "It's Halloween, not Christmas."
Draco scoffed.
"Don't. Please, it's nothin'! Jus' enjoy yer Chris'mas!" The half-giant blubbered.
wizards celebrate. Not the... vermin that's allowed at Hogwarts."
Harry frowned, subtly looking at his hands. He didn't believe his fingers to be big, but he had previously only had one pair of hands around his age to compare them to, and Dudley's hands had been an outlier in the data.
Pansy eyed them suspiciously before returning to her meal. Draco nudged him, whispering into his ear, "Train."
"Since it meant facing a massive three-headed dog!" Blaise snapped.
On the first day of classes, Harry felt many eyes on him, though they were mostly on his scar. He was thankful for his first class, History of Magic, as most of the first years were staring at the teacher rather than him. Harry found himself staring at him, too, much to his dismay. He should know better; he was experiencing the same thing. Well, instead of being dead, he was stared at for... not being dead?
"C'mon in!" Hagrid moved out of the way to invite the boys in, and a large dog jumped up excitedly.
When Harry woke, he found Draco’s bed empty. He sighed, slipping a sweater on as he rushed down the stairs to the common room in hopes of catching up to Draco. Harry caught a glimpse of the boy and called out, ultimately getting ignored as Draco rushed away again. His sudden cold demeanor reminded Harry of the cold weather, and he rushed back to his dorm to put more layers on. As Harry dressed, he heard murmurs of the first Quidditch match of the season, and his heart began to leap. He never really cared for sports, but magic sports? That was something he could get into. He turned to Draco’s bed, yearning to share his excitement with him, but his heart dropped as he stared at the empty bed beside him.
"Indeed."
Harry thought for a moment. This must be a trick question; they were the same thing. "Nothing, sir. They're just two different names of the same thing, which can also be called aconite, sir."
"Whatever it is, Snape's definitely after it." Draco finally contributed.
Was it karma? All he had wanted to see was how Professor Binns would eat his lunch. He clutched at his forehead, trying not to make a scene. He, being Harry Potter, ultimately failed.
"There was a robbery." Harry looked at Draco as he uttered the first words other than a greeting to Hagrid, "It was emptied the same day you and Harry were there when you made a withdrawal."
"Stop breathing so loud," Draco hushed.
Robes! That's where he knew the boy from. He had met this boy while getting his robes for school.
"Oh! Oh, yeah... but you didn't. And I wouldn't care if you put yourself in danger. Why would I care? That's dumb. Stupid." Draco insisted.
. Harry gently set down his mug, drawn in on a section of the book he was currently reading:
He flipped the page and resumed his skimming, jolting with excitement when he finally found it. Nicholas Flamel.
"And Draco." Harry chimed in.
, he's welcome to join us! Narcissa and I could never say no to such a," his nose wrinkled, "
"I offered you my hair gel."
“Why?”
"I didn't say that he did, Harry! I'm just trying to say that something happened on the same day! And I said it was attempted robbery. On Vault 713."
"Very well, off you go." She stood up, extending her hand to help Harry up.
He looked at his bare plate, standing up, "I'm going to get ready for potions."
"What? No! This is the guest bedroom!" Draco explained, flabbergasted.
I did what I could to salvage it. This was originally written when I thought good writing was using weird verbs.
Harry's face maintained its troubled expression as Draco unfolded his glasses and slipped them onto his face. His nose twitched as the cold metal brushed against it, and he found himself staring into his best friend's eyes.
Harry thought,
"Of course I'm sure!" He scowled, but seemed to take Harry's advice on his next try, "Up!"
Almost as soon as the hat brushed his sleeked platinum blonde hair, it called out, "SLYTHERIN!"
“That’s a good question…” Arthur rested his head in his hand, chewing absentmindedly at his lower lip. “Any… idea?”
“You left all this for me?” Ted mumbled, “I’m a very lucky man.” He shook his head before chuckling. “Big time.”
Draco, Harry and Neville tried their best to help her study again, which offered comfort to her, and she was soon able to help them in return as her love for studying began to resurface. Nonetheless, she wasn’t fine, just like Harry hadn’t been fine. They all knew that she wasn’t, and they offered her the same comfort and assistance which they had offered to him.
Thus, it was with heavy dread that he sat down at the meeting, readied his quill, and held his breath as Arthur Weasly began to speak.
To his great shame, but also overwhelming relief, Ron felt how tears shaped in his eyes and dripped down his face. He carefully grabbed Hermione’s hand so as to not frighten her with his strong grip, and he met her beautifully brown eyes with his own. “I’m sorry…” his voice sounded so very loud in his ears, but it had not been more than a whisper. “My parents are divorcing. I’m so sorry…” he repeated it again, with more complex and negative feelings clustering every syllable.
Madam Pomfrey’s voice met Harry as he entered the hospital wing which was just outside of his bedroom. It was rather early in the morning the day after the head nurse had managed to convince Harry to return to his room. Thus, the young wizard was hoping to meet his beloved before he had to go to breakfast and then attend the rather noticeably empty classes.
The exercise was to show the children how hard it was to actually recite something accurately out of memory, especially during sudden interactions, shocks, emotional experiences and similar. Thus, the Police officer had the children try to report back to her what had actually happened, what the teacher had looked like, what he had said, and what the objects he had thrown looked like. In the end, the children barely got half of the information right.
Harry readjusted himself, sat up properly and turned towards Ron, giving him his full attention. “Welcome back, did something happen?” It was surprisingly easy to offer assistance to Ron. Harry wasn’t precisely sure why that was, but he thought it might have to do with the fact that Ron’s problems were usually very far removed from Harry’s, which made them easier to speak about.
George shook his head. “Not yet. I checked after I got Fred to deliver the P-juice to Lupin and his boyfriend. But don’t worry, it’s not like he’s actually late.” George added quickly.
Harry pulled his head back and took a deep breath, feeling as if he had just resurfaced within a busy, strong river. The memories which were not his became memories in his own mind, and the emotions which came with them caused his breath to hitch and his eyes to water. His legs felt weak after experiencing the rejection of his own son, who was of course not Harry’s son, and the desire and love for his partner, who was not Harry’s partner. The latter feeling was easier to handle for him, as he knew the very same emotions from losing Draco due to another rather likely war.
“Secrets?” Harry called into the mostly empty chambers. “Secrets, I need your help!” He hoped that he was speaking Parseltongue.
Vincent Crabbe was standing with a group of students, all of which formed a sort of circle, blocking the rest of the world off in a simple display of rejection. Harry didn’t know anyone’s name with the exception of Pansy Parkinson and Gregory Goyle, and some faces were utterly unfamiliar, leading Harry to think that they might be older or younger students.
With a startle, the boy-who-lived noticed that Al had come to sit by his side on the floor, worriedly gazing down upon him.
“Now, for your assignment of the evening,” Umbridge moved her wand and gave both of them a piece of parchment, a quill each, and this time, she remembered ink, even if it was still the one smelling of roses. “You are to write an essay each about rules and regulations. I want you both to write why we have laws, and why you both feel like you are entitled to break them at your leisure. Write about why you are so special as to not be required to adhere to the same laws as us normal mortals.”
“If one wanted to protect such an object, how would you theoretically think that one would go about it? I’m thinking that an excessive protection charm would make it evident that there was something special about the object, which should ideally be protected without notice, but leaving a horcrux without anything appears foolish. Not to mention reckless. Do you have any suggestions, Professor?”
Harry could almost hear his heartbeat race in his chest despite their distance to one another. “And yours are brown,” Harry noted with satisfaction.
Peter glanced down at the silver hand which the mage had shaken. The silver hand which had been created for him by the Dark Lord. The hand which wasn’t really his at all. He sighed and allowed the hand to fall by his side as he glanced at the grandfather clock in the entrance hall. It was late, he should probably not go back out again. Peter realised that he hadn’t eaten for a long time, and thus elected to make his way towards the kitchen, which was likely empty by this hour. Maybe he’d make a sandwich, one with tuna and mayo. He had used to love that combination, but there was no reaction in his body or mind to the prospect of such a sandwich. Maybe there was some peanut butter to put on a piece of bread…? No, that thought didn’t make him any more excited to eat either.
“You are still doing it.”
“I am, Madam.” Harry nodded, feeling very humbled in front of someone like this woman. If she was guarding the Gryffindor common room, like Harry correctly assumed her to be doing, then she must have been someone very impressive when she was alive.
“It could be protected by some manner of magic,” Al responded. “I truly do think that I should come with you.”
Percy hadn’t intended to, but when he came to his senses, he was already hugging the stranger. Bartemius Crouch Junior did not resist the touch, but simply allowed himself to be moved and touched by someone he had never even spoken to. Percy hoped that he wasn’t crying on his shoulder, but he wasn’t entirely certain.
Hermione wasn’t so much jealous as she was uncomfortable with Brown’s attitude towards her. She still had feelings for Ron, but she was learning to cope with them without allowing her heart to prompt her into bad decisions. Her primary source of comfort was studies into Dark Arts, as well as her general homework and preparation for her NEWTs. She was foremost attempting to focus on things which distracted her, rather than allow herself to feel.
She giggled into her hand, trying to not disturb Draco’s reading of the page about the black mamba.
Harry recalled that Colin’s reasons for coming to the hospital ward back then had been for somewhat unclear and slightly dubious purposes involving Harry’s person and Colin’s camera. Yet it had been very long ago and Colin had changed a lot since back then. Harry considered him a friend, rather than just an acquaintance, as the other was very pleasant to be around. Colin may have been different in the past, yet he had grown up into a person who was overall reliable and fun.
Draco moved his shoulder to gain Crabbe’s attention. He pointed to the carriage which had slid up to them silently as the thestral which was pulling it had made no sound as it approached. The reptilian horse was standing as still as a corpse, its white eyeball staring at the students as it waited. It was the type of creature which could wait for years and not move, although it wouldn’t. It had better things to do than wait forever, despite the fact that it could.
“It’s fine,” Colin objected as he reached out to pull slightly on Harry’s sleeve, trying to bring him back to the moment as Harry was becoming increasingly stressed by talking. “You don’t seem ready for a relationship yet. You don’t seem ready to move on. I have been thinking about this a lot, and I rather think that dating you would be, well… really nice. It’s not that I’m going to go wait for you all my life, as that would be frankly idiotic, but I don’t mind waiting while you get over Malfoy.”
“Uhm…” George searched for the correct pamphlet and handed it to his twin. “A few magical science and mixing magic and machinery classes, I guess? Teddy makes it sound pretty interesting and I’m rather curious to check it out.”
Another, more hesitant applause filled the room as the students welcomed the centaur with some suspicion. Harry and Draco made a point out of applauding loudly for the new teacher, who neither of them actually had lessons with. Teddy joined in, seeing as he understood well what his friends were doing, not to mention that he found the idea of a centaur teacher to be a most excellent addition to any group of faculty of staff. Goyle applauded heartily as well, as he had come to know the centaur and was happy to be taught by him.
“Two and a half.” The Headmaster sighed deeply once more. “While I am not directly opposed to their opinions, it is a fact that the Hogwarts budget does not directly allow for the replacement of a collection of teachers over a short period of time. But I won’t bore you with such things. I actually wanted to speak to you, Mr. Lupin, your timing is most excellent.”
“Everyone!” Ginny announced as she entered the Room of Requirements, grinning from ear to ear as her cheeks heated with excitement and her eyes were aflame with happiness. “Allow me to introduce my new and second girlfriend,” she turned around and spread her arms, showing towards the person behind her.
