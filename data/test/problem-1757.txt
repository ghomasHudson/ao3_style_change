“Weasley agrees with me that keeping him as far from the actual case as we can is the best course of action to protect him and close the case,” Draco repeated what he’d told him back when the decision was made.
“It migrated away from the wound, we’re clear and the patch has maybe another day, day and a half in it anyway.” Draco explained
“Because of how her sister died.” Malfoy cut it short, and Harry caught up. Greengrass. She was Astoria’s older sister. She nearly became Malfoy’s sister-in-law. “But that wasn’t the point of the exercise,” he added, the annoyance simmering down when Harry didn’t push for more. “Did you pay attention?” he asked.
“Sounds rough, mate,” Ron commented. “You want to play?” he asked, pulling the chessboard between them.
"Siddhima Gupta, she'll be joining us for dinner," Granger confirmed. "Trust me, you'll like her. Speaking of, are you ready to head down to the restaurant?"
"Hush, Draco, Hugo is a great kid," Astoria chastised him. Her chuckle made the reprimand less than effective and Draco allowed himself a private little smile behind the glass.
I'm trying to add tags as I go, if I forgot to tag something sensitive please let me know and I'll fix it.
Out of an unspoken mutual agreement they didn't speak of what happened during Holi again. Things went back to normal, with teaching, restoring old parchments, and surreptitiously advising Griffith on how to spot curse damage without equipment. After a particularly gruelling week isolating and cleansing the ground and animals affected by an accidental curse, Draco approached Hermione to ask for a few days off to travel north.
"Sure, Potter," Draco sighed with a shake of his head, throwing his free hand up. "Let's go to Mumbai. When are we supposed to leave again?" he asked Granger.
I've been working on my owlpost entries and sirius black fest as well, so stay tuned for those when they drop.
"Good job, Rosie," Ron commented before going back to the kitchen to finish making dinner while Harry examined her handywork.
He poked his head through the door to see if Malfoy was done packing and found him carefully folding a set of semi-formal robes, which made him wonder what kind of business he had in Amritsar.
“You’ll tell me when you do.” It wasn’t meant as a question and Harry didn’t take it as such. He didn’t question how easily he took Malfoy’s orders, it just was more comfortable than fighting him every step of the way. Maybe he liked when Malfoy looked at him with approval instead of disdain. “Do you want to try for yourself or do you need to see it one more time?” he asked.
It took three weeks for Miss Rana’s teasing nickname 'Sādā sāpa' to catch on, and soon after that the elders started calling him 'Sāhab-ji'  bowing their heads and smiling whenever they saw the tattoo on his forearm. He was used to it, the way communities prostrated by tragedy flocked around a Healer or a teacher. He only tried once to dissuade them from using honorifics for him. His feelings about it mattered very little, what was important was bringing comfort to them when he couldn't bring health. He tried to deflect the attention towards Healer Gupta during meals. She was doing the actual life-changing work. He was only putting plasters on cuts after all, and she was working to exhaustion with her trainees, balancing the magical cores of kids and adults, moulding misshapen magic grown wild and without control in elders, twisting the environment around them. Her work was what would make a difference once they left.
“Suit yourself.” Draco told him, taking his wand out and casting a sanitization spell on himself while Dana arranged the monitors to keep track of Potter’s blood pressure and oxygenation, setting all the other vitals in the background.
“Not approved by the British Order of Healers,” He sighed, sipping a little more firewhisky as he slowly slumped down on the couch.
“I never said I’d do it here. You get me the ingredients, I’ll do my brewing at home. Say that after our latest mishap the Ministry is supplying the potions to treat their own. Wouldn’t even be that big of a lie.”
"I thought it would be an appropriate moment to attempt to corrupt your virtue." Malfoy's sarcasm didn't stop Harry's cheeks from heating up at the memory of that stolen kiss, the taste of his lips still vivid in Harry's mind.
"Well done, mon bonheur, now lean forward slowly and come here," he encouraged him. He did his best not to laugh at the look of intense concentration on Scorpius' face as he very carefully shifted his weight. The broom propelled forward a few feet before he slid too close to the tip and upset the balance of the broom. It dipped down, making him plop face-first into the grass with a yelp, the broom spiralling off a few feet away. Draco held his breath for a moment until Scorpius rolled over giggling and Hugo ran up to him to help him up.
“You know why,” Draco replied, not bothering to hide the desolation he felt about the question. He didn’t even put up a token effort to keep his glass, all the fight drained out of him.
He avoided the pool and the noise of splashing water, favouring the stone path along the garden, enjoying the cool air provided by the trees. He could carve out an hour of his day, or even just half that to come out here and do yoga. He wasn't a fan of indoor gyms and the view was gorgeous out here. He could come out around dawn when the heat wasn't stifling yet…
“The available evidence points to yes.” Draco conceded “We still don’t know how it came to be since every single test we ran turned up negative. Nothing in your recent missions could have caused something like this, residue doesn’t just migrate on its own.” He started before realization hit him.
“Yeah, well, maybe when you were young and beautiful, but I hate to say it, you look like shit,” Blaise replied, just a hint of concern in his voice as he read through the notice.
“Sit down, Draco, talk to me,” Harry told him, shifting a little to make space for him on the bed. “What’s the problem?” he asked once Draco sat down, the envelope sitting between them on the sheets.
Draco's knees gave out from under him and he crumpled into Harry's arms. "I'm sorry." It was a broken whisper against Harry's neck as his tears drenched Harry's shoulder.
"I started out by draining Harry's energy enough that Murphy couldn't draw on it to cast against the team. But that was only a temporary fix. To sever a bond I would have had to either kill him or drain him to the point of extinguishing his entire magical reserves," Draco started explaining to a captivated Hermione.
There were so many things Harry wanted to explore Draco didn’t know where to start. In the end, he left himself with the options open, setting out a couple candles, ropes, and a couple other toys he’d seen Harry eye with open want.
He'd left in a self-imposed exile, dedicating every day to training and working for free to offer relief to people hurt by the system he'd profited from since before he was born. And yet it wasn't enough. It would never be enough for Potter's anger to stop being justified. But that didn't absolve him from trying.
He looked the same he always did. Same pale face and high cheekbones, same slender fingers and elegant wrists, same long legs and straight back. How could a man carry that grief without his shoulders curving under the weight? Without it showing somewhere on his body?
Draco quickly summed up the events up to the morning, laying out his working theories on why there was no residue decay, asking how they could work around whatever was causing it and eliminate the residue if the host’s body wasn’t collaborating.
“I hate how you aim the curse at your own foot” Blaise said once the door was closed between them and the committee. Draco sighed, Blaise’s voice pulling him back in the present. It had gone much better than he’d expected, it was just a three day suspension and they weren’t going to find anything more than they already knew from his reports, there was nothing else to find. Three days and then he’d go back to normal, or three days and then he’d be out of a job.
“I’m not going to lie and say that it’s ok, because it’s not,” Harry replied honestly, taking a moment to process Draco’s roundabout words. “And that
“Welcome back to the land of the living, Auror Potter.” A cool somewhat familiar voice greeted him. Something inside him was pushing him to recognize the drawl of the man speaking to him. He squinted a little to put the mint green robe into focus, looking up at the face framed by platinum blonde hair escaped from a neat ponytail.
"They can't communicate with other magical communities reliably and can't find each other in time of need." The image of bars across a window and a lock on the door he couldn't open came back to Harry.
Harry shook his head. "You…" Harry wiped his eyes and then smiled at Taranjit. "My cousin. My cousin has kids, magical kids." He laughed at the bubble of sun-warm joy at the thought of it.
"We all testified under Veritaserum, and the scrutiny on our testimony was rightly scrupulous. It was a fair and unbiased proceeding, as much as you would have liked it to be otherwise. It was what we needed to close that chapter of wizarding history," she insisted, as if that
“You two are becoming the same person and I don’t know whether it’s funny or creepy.” He shook his head, slipping a finger under the knot of his tie to loosen it. He unbuttoned his collar and his cuffs, rolling his sleeves up a bit before pouring himself a glass of firewhisky.
“That and the fact that your husband and I are constantly lying to him. Feels like a less than ideal way to start a relationship. Make it illegal and base it on lies.”
It's an actual Christmas chapter on Christmas day. You're welcome, I know, I'm spoiling you with all this content but it's Christmas and we're all a little nicer.
"Well, you could start by defusing the curse. There is an artefact on the bottom of that pool. I've seen one like it before. It leeches off people's magic, funnelling it into a specific spell, hence the isolation around the room. It was widely used during magical warfare by the empire, but was deemed too unreliable to use between civilised people."
“Interesting mail?” Harry asked, noticing the conflicted look on Draco’s face as he turned the envelope over and over in his hands without making any move to open it.
Tvarika nodded. "She is, and she's been trying to reach the isolated magical communities for some time, but the bursts of wild magic are unpredictable and always pose a high risk for anyone trying to approach the land. That's why the government made it Unplottable."
Meeting Healer Gupta did wonders to smooth animosity, she emanated an aura of quiet power that Draco could appreciate. She spoke calmly, picking her words carefully, aided by the young woman sitting to her right. Her intervention was needed less and less as the conversation turned more technical. The deeper Draco's questions probed into her style of healing practises the easier Healer Gupta’s words flowed in a warm accented English that made the conversation that much more pleasant.
"You're right, mon chou, I'm sorry, I'm just teasing." The ease with which Malfoy bent to Teddy's reprimand made Harry's breath catch in his throat. Who was this man? "Truth is your godfather was the better seeker, but that's just about the only thing he bested me at." He amended.
"I'll be the judge of that. If you drop dead your containment is going to fail in short order and I don't look forward to either being found in a cave with your cursed corpse or being dead myself, so I might reevaluate the priorities between the ceiling and you. Show me some skin, Potter."
"He's growing up so fast." She sighed as they walked under the pergola on the stone path, the plants casting mottled shadows on them. "You did too. I was holding you in my arms for the first time, then I blinked twice and you were a grown man." She shook her head, her shoulders dropping as sadness crept into her voice. "You were all grown fighting a war before I even realized."
"What are we listening today?" He asked. It was a well-practiced ritual by now. Pansy would come over, have breakfast or lunch with him, present him with her latest creation, everything to a choice musical background, apparently this time it was opera.
Draco sighed and ripped the envelope open with a precise flick of his wand, pulling the parchment out. His eyes scanned it quickly but his face gave nothing away as Harry waited for any kind of reaction.
“And I think I need boundaries. I can’t believe I’m saying it, but ever since I left Hogwarts rules have always been a bit of an option for me,” he ran a hand through his hair. “Not that it was much different while I was at Hogwarts. McGonagall put up a good effort to keep me in line, but Dumbledore...” He shook his head, chuckling at the distaste written all over Draco’s face. He still wasn’t over Harry’s early admission to the Quidditch team, or their first-year house cup, or the million small privileges Dumbledore allowed Harry. “Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts no one really pushed back or made me experience real consequences for my actions the way other people do. I didn’t ask for special treatment and I always said I didn’t want it, but the fact of the matter is that I received it anyway, and I didn’t exactly complain when it happened. It probably made my impulse control even worse.”
“And you love me,” Harry replied, fumbling with Draco’s belt before deciding things would move along much more quickly if they just undressed themselves, instead of each other, so he quickly shrugged off his trousers and pants, hopping up on the bed with an excited grin.
"We all are at the beginning." Draco shrugged. "You're used to a fully stocked hospital, with state-of-the-art machinery and infrastructure. It's going to be an adjustment to have only your wand to rely on."
Padma smiled and shook her head. "Hermione knows exactly who you are, and I'm sure you'd be on top of her list even if you
“Can I help you, Healer Moreschi?” he asked, taking off his robes and hanging them. It was clear this was going to take more time than he would have liked.
He woke up to voices in the room, bickering. As he blinked, Ron and Draco came into focus, arguing over a newspaper. For a moment his brain misfired, struggling to compute why it wasn’t Nurse Hanson the one in his room early in the morning complaining about the news.
"This is part of Sikh practise. In every temple, there is a communal kitchen that serves simple food to whoever comes in. Anyone can help prepare it and we all eat together as equals. Same food, same table, same seats, no questions asked," he explained as the metal trays were brought out.
“Yeah, at least I got to sleep tonight.” He replied, pushing himself up a little “Anything new on the prophet?” He asked.
They'd been going down for some time; Harry wasn't sure how long, but the way had been steep and it had gotten cold and dark enough that Vikram's spell didn't quite reach all the nooks and crannies of the rocks around them. But this corridor was different; the darkness there had a different quality, it was thick and almost palpable, it rejected light and at the same time it beckoned one closer, in a way that reminded Harry of the shade under a Dementor's tattered cloak. It was a danger that didn't try to hide, and at the same time had an irresistible allure.
That explained Ron’s foul mood when he came by later that afternoon. Harry’d been feeling woozy all day, in and out of sleep, but Ron coming in for lunch brightened his mood, except once again he was lacking in the details department. He just knew that some suspects had been released, and that the last dregs of the investigation around the sting gone wrong were wrapping up with very little in the results area.
“You have no idea.” The desperate hunger in those four words sparked a fire low in Harry’s belly, making his cock twitch in his briefs.
“Good morning, miss Hanson.” He replied, a little groggy, reaching up to rub his eyes. It only took him a moment to locate his glasses and he managed to slide them on with minimal struggle. He had a crick in his neck as if he’d actually spent the whole night brewing.
Of course, Murphy would be out, and Draco seriously doubted he was actually dealing with the emergency. Draco flipped the book open and slowly slid his finger down the column of ingredients, checking the regular shipments and the amounts, nothing out of the ordinary… except they couldn’t possibly be accurate, there was too much coming in and no stock to show for it. Even imagining that the department was in the hands of a moron who couldn’t tell his hands from his arse and was a wasteful brewer (which Draco was convinced to be the case ever since Andrews handed over the reins to Murphy) it still wouldn’t explain the inconsistencies. His finger stopped at
Harry's eyes narrowed but he couldn't get a word in. Malfoy had him pinned in place with the weight of his disinterested gaze.
When the door clicked open again it was a welcome distraction from the annoying itch he had on his right arm.
Draco nodded along, that's why the Potters weren't among the Sacred Twenty-Eight despite being undeniably of a pure-blood line; they weren't English enough. No, that wasn't it. The Black family was notoriously French in ancestry; the Potters weren't white enough to be considered peers by the rest of high society.
“Are you coming to Sadistique this weekend?” Blaise asked after a while. He let Draco mull over their conversation for a bit before moving on to lighter topics.
“Daddy planted them special for me when I was born and now, they’re so big.” She smiled, motioning with her hands approximately how big those plants had gotten.
"Do you think this could be replicated up north?" Potter asked after they took a tour of the village.
"That's not my name." Draco couldn't find words when he turned around and pinned Draco down with the weight of his gaze, "I was meant to be Hari Poddar."
"It seems there was a bit of a mix-up. I imagine the communicating rooms were meant for you and Granger." He waved a hand in the general direction of the room Hermione was currently residing in. "Security reasons."
Harry had spent the morning being poked and prodded by strangers, making him feel like he needed a shower to get the feeling of weird stuff out of his skin, they’d poured at least three different potions all over him and vanishing spells didn’t take away the unpleasant slimy sensation. Usually he would jump at the chance to stop the process and maybe charm his way out of it entirely, but now that it was just him and Malfoy he found he didn’t mind the idea too much, he could deal with Malfoy’s cool hands on him. He’d always been gentle and he never lingered too much, leaving just the ghost of his fingers on his skin.
“Do you think any of those two things have changed since you two took that decision?” Blaise continued stroking Draco’s hair.
"What do we know about the community in Jahwar?" Malfoy asked, rolling up his socks and carefully placing them in the backpack.
"Here, try it with the mango chutney." Potter dipped a bit of pancake into one of the chutneys and held it out for Draco, looking at him expectantly.
"All done, Uncle Harry!" Rose announced, twisting the nail polish bottle shut. "Dad can you dry them, please?"
something deeply personal that he had no right to be privy to, but that raised the question of how Ron got involved in it in the first place.
The aching tenderness in Malfoy's tone was too raw for Harry, still too comfortable with their jabs and barbs, hiding everything else beneath them. When Malfoy held out his arm for Harry to undo the cuff, he hesitated with his fingers just shy of Malfoy's skin, his eyes drawn towards the faint scar lines crossing over his chest, now exposed by the open shirt.
Harry’s night was uncomfortable, he struggled to find a comfortable enough position and for some reason he felt wired. It wasn’t just because of Seamus’ disconcerting comments about him and Malfoy, about everybody knowing about his (apparently not so) secret unrequited crush on the man. It was something else. It was a pervasive sense of urgency that kept him from falling asleep well into the night.
“Uhm...” McReary gave him a hesitant look and for a moment Draco thought he was going to say no, it was a strange request, after all, and he was pushing his luck. “It’s on the table but Murphy’s out talking with our suppliers to see if we can get some extra to cover the emergencies.”
Draco hummed softly. Imagine was all he got to do. He was already aching at the thought that he would never know the specifics of Scorpius' wand and wouldn't get to buy him his first actual owl.
"I'm not leaving, Griffith, I'm going to be a good yell away at any point, and I have complete confidence in your ability to handle things without me. I
He put on his best kurta, shaved his face clean, and ended up sitting in a stuffed chair in a medium-sized office at the Bengal branch of the Indian Ministry of Magic. He had a chance to argue the fact that educating the entire population would reduce the international sanctions imposed on India for potential breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy, and it would free a lot of resources when they’d be able to resize the Obliviation and Muggle-Worthy Excuses Department, syphoning off personnel from every other department. He hated taking such a utilitarian approach when he wanted to grab the man by the lapels and shake him until he got that every person deserved an education, but Hermione was right to say they needed to court the public officials. She spoke about public support for humanitarian causes, and how no one would be against supporting magical children, how much international interest it would garner, let alone the national notoriety for being the one to start reform in all of India.
It might have been the potion, the pain, the intoxicating touch of Malfoy’s hands or the hypnotizing lilt of his voice repeating sharp syllables over and over obfuscating Harry’s better judgment, and in all honesty it was a bit Malfoy’s fault as well for demanding he keep talking because Harry found himself saying whatever came to mind.
“That’s a lie,” Blaise tutted “you would forgive him literal murder. In fact, you have. And when has Potter ever been known for doing what he should?” he asked with a small chuckle.
“Something dangerously half-assed, I have been hanging around too many Gryffindors lately,” Draco replied before launching into a detailed report of what he did to Harry and the wards, stopping to answer Hermione’s questions to the best of his abilities.
What he didn't expect was Potter shedding his kurta in favour of a tank top to help mop up water, shovel mud and dispose of broken tree branches. The exposed arms did nothing to help Draco's concentration on the task at hand and Miss Rana had to repeat herself more than once, much to Draco's chagrin, and her knowing smile wiped away any hope he had that she might be oblivious of where his attention was exactly.
Malfoy walked in bright and early with the results of his latest exams. He didn't look too pleased with what he was reading.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Harry offered, unable to find words of comfort to soothe the ache he only got a glimpse of. There were no words that could possibly bring relief.
"Under and then up," Harry replied. "There's an opening under the waterfall that's going to take us on top. From there it's going to be just a few minutes until we cross into Unplottable land if the directions are accurate."
He walked half a step behind the man, letting him feel the full weight of having his back to a threat, he knew how to project danger, lean into the perception people had of him.
The day had started so well, too. This odd tentative truce with Potter had carried through their months apart and it felt fresh and hopeful, like there was a rope bridge thrown across what was previously an impassable canyon… or maybe only a door in a previously impenetrable wall. Draco had woken up early and did his morning yoga in his underwear in front of the window overlooking the city. His precious few minutes in savasana were interrupted by Potter's gentle knock on the door between their rooms.
He could feel the weight of his eyes on his skin as Draco dragged them up, as if trying to consume every inch of Harry’s body.
Also, there is talk about Scorpius moving out of Draco's house and into Parkinson House. It's a particularly painful conversation.
Harry dropped the papers on the floor and pulled Draco in to kiss him, trapping him against the banister and messing up the perfectly styled hair he maintained despite the humidity. He nipped at his lips until Draco parted them, melting into the kiss with a soft sigh. He made Harry feel greedy, offering everything up for Harry to take and have without fear of losing.
Once they got to his office she was all caught up, he delegated to her the task of getting in contact with Finnigan while he penned down a few lines to ask Bonhomme for a consult. The man was a pillar of modern medicine, he was pushing 100 years and his research on magical interaction had brought healers into a new era of medical practices, unless you were English and too puritan to go anywhere near a patient’s magical core.
“The glamour has nothing to do with how well rested he looks, then.” Ah, there it was, the bite behind soft spoken words, Soup had been a Malfoy much longer than Draco after all. He should have known something was up when he spoke in third person.
After a while he had to resign himself to the fact that Ron was a great player and the pieces could tell, unlike himself who was adequate at best. But he was too distracted by Malfoy’s face to feel bad about it. He was entirely focused on the board, his lips pursed as he considered Ron’s move, a finger tapping on the table as his eyes flitted from piece to piece until he called out his own. Harry looked at Ron, slouched in his chair, frowning at the board with the kind of concentration he’d seen only when he was studying the instructions to build a crib for his firstborn.
“As you know, I’m the hospital’s interim Chief Medical Officer while Healer Andrews gets investigated over his involvement in the crimes committed in his department,” she started, clasping her hands on the desk. “Even if it should result that he wasn’t directly involved in them, his gross lack of oversight destroyed his chances of ever leading a department again, especially not in this hospital.”
“Only the prompt intervention of Daphne Greengrass, fellow model, prevented the tragic accident from turning fatal.” She read out loud before turning The Prophet towards him so he could see the shot.
With every step and every breath his simmering anger subsided, mellowed by something sweeter, like the knowledge he was in a place where his family had prospered and in some small way, he was there to protect it and give back what he'd received. When he found himself in front of a gurdwara he stopped, suddenly wondering how far he'd got from the hotel. More than that, the sounds and smells coming from the temple kitchen made him question exactly how long he'd been out. His body was still set on the London timezone, so it could have been fifteen minutes just as easily as an hour. As much as he wanted to walk inside, cover his head and sit down for langar in the middle of a crowd of faces, brown as his own, where he could disappear for a moment, he was technically working, so he turned around and retraced his steps until he found the hotel.
“Care to share any more details so I can try and fix that for you?” Draco prompted after a moment of silence. He needed to exercise all of his patience, even if it was Potter, Draco was a professional, dealing with patients was what he did for a living, the calling of his life.
“Kneel, Potter,” Draco ordered, his face hard and assessing as he took in Harry, standing in front of him, solid and grounded like chiselled stone.
“There was someone else in the building you raided; it stands to reason they should be connected to the ring, no?” Ron replied.
Harry clenched his fists and was ready to bite off his head at that. Of course there was a point. If they could save even only one of them it would be worth it. But Malfoy held up his hand and continued.
"He's going to be great," he murmured. He took a swig of lemonade and wished it was something stronger and distinctly inappropriate for a five-year-old’s birthday party. "You and Pansy will make sure of it."
At least he had a chessboard now. He picked up the white queen and placed it on the board, the rest of the pieces sorting themselves out on their own. He made a mental note to ask Ron for updates on the operation when he and Hermione next came to visit. Maybe they could play a little, it had been ages since they had a good game.
"Can't you shut up and trust me for once?" Harry chuckled, pushing the door open to the big room, already filled with people stirring huge cauldrons of curry and lining the roti station.
“You like losing to a live person better than an artefact?” Malfoy teased, rotating the board so Harry would have the opening move. “To each their kink, I suppose,” he added with a sly smile.
Malfoy took a few gulps and then closed his eyes, resting his head against the rock wall, trying to catch his breath.
“Did she or did she not save both of your foolish arses?” Soup snapped. Draco had no argument against that. Neither did Harry.
Draco woke up early that morning. He wanted to check on Potter before his rounds, see how the elbow was doing after a night of rest. He was constantly worried about going in one day and finding Potter had grown a new limb or turned neon pink. His response to treatment had been fairly predictable ever since he’d been fitted with the collar (and that image inspired a plethora of other thoughts Draco couldn’t afford to linger on) but it was always there at the back of his mind, the worry that something horrible might happen as soon as he turned his back. Potter did have that tendency after all. He had documented evidence of it now. Extensive documented evidence, with multiple witnesses. Him being intimately connected with a person in a criminal organization didn’t make it easier for Draco to rationalize his worries away.
“We both know you want this, Potter,” Draco’s voice steady and smooth. “I’m not giving you an easy out. You’ll have to look inside yourself and show me just how much you crave being at my feet. You will have to subject yourself to the abject horror of asking for what you want and reaching for it,” he explained, his eyes never leaving Harry’s, watching the struggle building inside of him, tension mounting and releasing in his body. Draco waited quietly for minutes, while Harry stared longingly at the spot on the floor right in front of the chair. Until the tension broke.
“Draco, look at me,” Blaise told him. “What’s the goal here? What is it that you want?” he asked softly, resting a hand over his heart, searching his eyes for an answer.
Turned out Potter had been in a number of high-risk situations, which surprised absolutely no one. Turned out also that Murphy never bothered to record or check up on after. Which was even less surprising, although exceedingly worrying. Honestly, there was lazy paperwork and then there was criminal endangerment due to negligent reporting. Draco ended up spending the afternoon sorting through mission reports with Dana and Finnigan, trying to match them up with Potter’s visits to st Mungo’s and ranking them in order of exposure to potentially triggering events. They had to classify them by likelihood of exposure and probable effects.
Draco hummed. “I will adjust them anyway, you might be developing a sensitivity to them,” he decided, better safe than sorry. Before exploring anything else he wanted to go with the simplest solution.
“Everything alright, Harry?” Andromeda asked, arranging the tray next to the bed in reach of Harry’s good hand.
"Why are you going through this much trouble to track this side of your family tree?" Malfoy’s question broke the silence, startling Harry out of his idle musing about food.
Malfoy scoffed "I let him win because his life was just tragic." He replied, the glint of amusement in his eyes unmistakable and so foreign that Harry did not have the processing capacity to find a suitable retort. Teddy narrowed his eyes at him.
Teddy insisted on getting another hug and managed to extract a promise from Malfoy to come and have a look at his new potions equipment and test his new quidditch gear. Malfoy agreed easily, too easily, indulging Teddy’s request as if he wanted to look at cauldrons and scales during his time off. He even ran his fingers through Teddy’s hair, looking down at him with infinite fondness on his face and Harry didn’t know what to do with that as Malfoy left the room.
The obvious choice would be handing him over to Murphy, but Draco needed someone to have his back in that room, and while he could trust Healer Dana he couldn’t say the same of Murphy, obsequious little man in the worst way possible.
When they emerged from the arches back into the midday sun Potter turned to him, almost hesitant, an expression Draco had yet to see on him.
Harry reached out, hesitating as Malfoy flexed his shoulders, as if preparing for a blow, the simple outline of an egg sitting unassuming between his shoulder blades. As soon as Harry's fingers brushed against the ink, it cracked and unfurled until a phoenix emerged from it, fiery and golden, raising its head over Malfoy's shoulder and its tail rolling down his spine to curl around his hip. Malfoy whimpered as if in pain when it spread its wings, feathers reaching down his arms until the elbow. Harry had never seen a tattoo, even magical, look so real. It seemed like it could take flight any moment now, its feathers ruffling as if caressed by a gentle breeze.
She lives to write once again, I am acutely aware of how late this is, but I hope the content will more than make up for it.
"I've learnt not to underestimate you, Potter. You're a devious shit with the face of a Gryffindor." Malfoy almost sounded impressed when he said it, and Harry knew to take it as the roundabout compliment it was meant as.
“Yeah, but it’s more fun when there’s another person in front of you,” Harry replied, his amusement clear on his face. For all his complaining, Malfoy was still agreeing to play with him.
“Healer Gupta is fully able to hold this class without me at this point, but enjoys indulging my ego, much like you.”
From the moment he stepped into the room, Miss Rana didn't leave his side for a moment, as dignitary after dignitary came to congratulate him on the job, forcing him to deflect any merit towards Healer Gupta, the one who actually did the work that would have long-lasting impact on the health and wellbeing of the local magical community by grounding their magic and balancing the energies in their bodies.
"I know, it's just… I'm not sure if I'm up for it," he admitted. "It's obvious they want me just because I'm desi, but I'm really not, you know? I grew up in a white household, completely removed from everything, and I'm only starting to figure things out now at twenty-seven. I only went once with you last winter. What if they expect me to have everything together?"
“It’s just my job, but I’ll be happy to share some stories later.” Harry offered, more than glad to take a stroll down memory lane and recount his more impressive stories on the force. Then he noticed Malfoy’s murderous glare.
"Debatable, you’re just all about power." Malfoy replied, barely sparing a glance at him as he ran his fingers through Teddy's hair, smoothing down the mess Harry’s hands had made of it. "You've been spending a lot of time at the Burrow, haven't you?" He asked, smiling at the bright orange colour he was sporting today. Teddy grinned and nodded.
“It’s highly likely the ritual I performed caused the residue to form a pseudo bond with Potter’s magic.” Draco admitted through gritted teeth. If the unsanctioned magic wasn’t going to get him fired, then this would, and he’d fucked up a perfectly good Auror too.
"Thank you for your patience, Sāhiba," he replied, bringing his hands to his chest and bowing his head to her.
“I guess I’m not.” Draco couldn’t pretend he hadn’t seen what he had inside Potter’s mind, or how he looked at him. “Can I offer you some tea?”
Except Ron didn’t show up until after lunch, and he came with Hugo in a baby carrier and Rose in tow, so shop talk was out of the question. But he couldn’t stay mad about it when Rose climbed onto the bed and started telling him all about the flowers growing in the garden.
“Oh, that feels so weird” Potter chuckled, looking down at himself, reaching up to poke at his own side, giggling at the sensation “What is this?” He asked.
“Yeah, but why did you let me stay there? It was...” intimate? private? “personal.” Harry settled on the supremely unsatisfactory definition for what he’d just felt. He looked up at Malfoy, trying to understand why he’d be so ready to show that kind of vulnerability so openly, without reserves. He had no doubt Malfoy could have kept him out if he wanted to.
Andrews placed his elbow on the table clasped his hands and leaned closer “I wouldn’t call it abundance of evidence. All the reports are from Healer Malfoy himself. We have no guarantee they are accurate.” He raised an eyebrow in challenge at Blaise.
The shifting light, catching on the iridescent tiles, was almost hypnotising and Harry might have ended up spending more time than he realised under the spray because when he stepped out, newly dressed and feeling refreshed, there was no trace of Hermione. He wasn't too worried about her safety but he hadn't paid enough attention to the path they took to get there and the corridors all looked the same. He opened the door he guessed led back to the front desk but he found himself in a massage room, clearly occupied. He was about to apologise and leave when he recognised the man slumped shirtless in the chair with a woman working at his back and one at his hand.
had been her exact words. It slid on like a glove, settling on his shoulders like a second skin. As he buttoned it up he felt his breathing slow down, the tension loosening from his shoulders and coalescing into something solid in his chest. With every piece Pansy handed him his armour hardened, every button done closed a crack, a new vulnerability covered as the sharp lines of Pansy's clothes hugged his body, containing his rage, caging his frustration and infusing him with a strength he didn't have. He stood still under Pansy's hands as she adjusted the fit and connected the chains of his waistcoat. Then, he finally met his own cold stare in the mirror for a moment and saw his father's face staring back at him.
Draco found a secluded corner of the garden where he could see a small stretch of the horizon between the trees, the clear sky above him turning grey before the colours of dawn flooded it. He rolled out the mat, took off his shoes and stepped on it, flexing his feet for a moment to get a feel for the ground under him. He took a slow breath and then another before he started, slowly flowing from one asana to the next. One by one, unhurriedly, he activated each muscle, stretching and pushing past the stiffness of sleep and old injuries until a thin sheen of sweat covered him and the sky was ablaze with reds and pinks above him. He allowed himself a bit longer than usual in savasana, staring up at the sky and preparing to face the day, then he pushed himself up, rolled up the mat and resized it to slip it in his pocket.
"Can you imagine once they go to Hogwarts?" She mentioned, adjusting the bit of ruffle falling casually around her arm.
“We’ll keep an eye on it. It looks like the bond is strengthening, you might be starting to share sensation, and we still have no idea what is on the other side.” He pinched the bridge of his nose and took a slow breath. “I’ll talk to Healer Dana and we’ll figure it out, in the meantime we might have finally balanced the brew for your freakish magical core,” he mentioned, pulling a grin from Harry.
“The universe doesn’t make sense, Draco. But we’ll fight this, Potter is alive and as far as I know he’s not pressing charges, this is frivolous, I won’t let it mark your career. You’ve got London’s finest attorney at your back, you’ll keep being a boring nerd for a long time.” He raised his glass a little in a toast.
Draco  fixed the collar of his kurta and neatly rolled up the sleeves, giving a neat crease to the cream-coloured garment and exposing the geometric tattoos snaking up his forearms. He trailed a finger down the clear path from the inside of his elbow to his wrist.
Harry shook his head. "Nothing. We're good, I just didn't think we would celebrate quite this traditionally."
Taranjit laughed, a full-bellied laugh that made Harry smile even though it was at his expense, "Oh, no, Hari, I couldn't maintain such a house with my business. Sādā Sāpa owns it now, I only oversaw the restoration."
“Next, you corner them and distract them. That’s what the pulling closer was for, when you’re in a particularly emotional memory it’s easy to overwhelm an untrained intruder by pulling them closer in, you already know those emotions, but for them, they are new,” he continued. Harry nodded along, trying not to get distracted by the thought of that younger Malfoy, full of love and happiness, fulfilled in a way Harry found himself longing for.
"You did good work today, Griffith," he mentioned when he noticed the other man staring sullenly at his food.
As soon as the thought crossed his mind he felt guilty. He already did make something just as good. James wouldn't have been there without him, even giving Luna and Ginny the space to be his parents without Harry butting in, his dark hair and brown skin were all Potter. And the girls had gone ahead and used his other sample for another pregnancy. It would still be Ginny's eggs but she would also be the one to carry. He had no right to feel sorry for himself. He had made an impact on the world, if he died tomorrow, he knew he'd done good and would leave people who loved him. And he still had two years, maybe a little bit more if he was lucky.
Harry trailed his fingers down the v of Draco’s hip and hooked them under the band, tugging it down carefully to reveal his cock, hard and wet at the tip, bobbing slightly when Harry freed it from the confining fabric.
"Same as you, check in with them," she replied, nodding towards the other houses visible through the window. "You got here first and acted like fools so I had to come rescue."
“Come on, let’s get you to bed. One of us can’t afford to go to work hungover tomorrow, and it’s not the sober one.” He carefully helped Draco to his feet and made a slow stumbling way to his bedroom. He made sure he was tucked in and left a vial of hangover cure for him, along with a glass of water.
He wasn't left wanting for quality time with Potter. Much as the man had liked pretending Draco didn't exist for the first month of their stay, now he seemed to monopolise Draco's free time. They walked the length of Calcutta several times over, visiting pieces of painful history and celebrations of freedom, from the Victoria Memorial to the Dakshineswar Kali Temple. Several times Draco felt like he should have taken his shoes off and walked lightly in order not to disturb the ground he placed his feet on. He saw the same reverence written on Potter's face, but the fire of suppressed anger that lit up his eyes whenever they stood in front of undeniable traces of England's passage didn't disappear in the smoke of incense that clouded the temples they visited. Draco could feel Potter's longing closing his own throat when they rested near the riverbank, watching the sun dip down and turn the sky into fire.
"Any chance you can contact Granger from down here? I'm fairly confident this constitutes 'something bad happening' and warrants a coin message."
“I want to see you come, Draco,” he purred, tightening his grip a little. “Are you going to come for me?”
Potter gently pushed the gate open and took the three steps to get inside the cold rectangular room. The ceiling was domed, completely decorated in a stunning mosaic of a starry sky, each star in golden tiles, at first seemingly random, but soon enough Draco started recognising constellations and wondered about the dedication to detail of whoever made it.
“Is it supposed to do something?” Potter asked, looking down at his torso sceptically. No sooner than he’d spoken the words the grains started rearranging themselves gathering over the patch and farther up, clustering at his sternum, moving slowly in an amorphous crawling cluster folding in on itself. Draco groaned tugging at his hair and flicking his wand with a little too much force, slashing through the parchment.
“Pas besoin de me remercier, mon jeune ami. Je suis toujours heureux d'aider les guérisseurs qui travaillent dur. même les anglais.”* The man chuckled jovially, waving a hand, dismissing Draco’s pleasantries. Draco relaxed immediately, offering a small smile of his own. He was about to start explaining the situation when Dana cleared her throat, pulling his attention.
Share your love in the comments, it keeps me going and I love hearing your thoughts on this beautiful trainwreck
"Three days before the decision." He replied with a small tentative smile. He couldn’t be too mad at the situation if it put a smile on his mother’s face.
“Malfoy,” he called after a while; when he grew bored of pretending to be asleep. Malfoy’s eyes snapped up to him immediately.
So there we go. First chapter out. What do we think? Let me know, I'd love to hear your thoughts on where this story is going I only have a moderately clearer idea about that than you. Love it? Hate it? drop me a line.
“Right, as we were. Brown and Bingley are here to assist me on a series of tests, thanks to your partner’s input we made a list of possible causes for your current condition.” he explained, showing him a roll of parchment he’d brought with him.
“Forgive me, Potter, but if you don’t mind I believe it’s my job to decide that.” Draco argued, sitting down and crossing his legs at the knee “So, when did these weird dreams happen before?” He asked, getting comfortable in the chair next to the bed.
“So, that’s what they mean when they say Slytherins are good with their tongues,” Harry eventually managed, rolling on his back, away from the wet spot.
"And Edward. He is a ward of the Blacks, he'll grow strong and flourish and he won't know anything but peacetime." He squeezed her hands and smiled softly at her for a moment before conjuring a handkerchief for her. He gathered her in his arms, letting her have her moment, collect herself leaning against his chest.
and I have no doubt he’s going to take good care of you, I don’t need to tell you that, but there are two things I feel like I need to make very clear before you jump into it head first like the Gryffindor you are. First is that the relationship goes both ways, he takes care of you and you do the same for him,” Blaise gave him a very meaningful look and Harry nodded dutifully. It was odd to see him suddenly so serious and protective of Draco, given the context of their discussion and the light teasing tone he’d kept all afternoon, taking exactly zero topics seriously.
"I'm sure you'll survive just fine, Sādā Sāpa," she replied with that mild teasing tone that made Draco miss Pansy dearly.
“Happy to be of service, Master Malfoy,” Soup replied, pulling a smile out of Draco. It was the worst fake obsequious tone he’d ever heard. With a snap of his fingers the elf filled a mug to go, earning himself Draco’s undying gratitude for the third time since he woke up.
The gurukul was gorgeous in its simplicity, the domed roof and many arched windows made it elegant and the red bricks made that elegance welcoming to scholars looking for a home to learn and grow in. There were torches all around, giving a warm glow to every room, and somehow the men and women dressed for a formal occasion didn't seem out of place.
“She has too much power and no Master, she saved you and then you left, Harry Potter,” Soup tsked, dripping with disapproval. “No respect for this house, no wonder she’s bent out of shape.” He shook his head, glaring daggers at Harry, Draco suspected Harry was only the most recent of a list of people on Soup’s shit list for disrespecting his house.
It was addictive, hearing Harry lose it over every single move he made. He wanted more, he wanted Harry to lose all coherence, to just feel.
“I suppose so. Oh, before I forget, Mother agreed to lend me the Pensieve. We can start tomorrow, Dana’s going to administer the next round of potions and I have to keep an eye on you while they work so we might as well put the time to good use,” Malfoy mentioned as he got up.
He only opened his eyes when he heard the quiet splash of water, indicating Potter had joined him in the water. Only then he realised he hadn't even thought of bringing along his wand. The last time he'd been alone with Potter in a bathroom he almost died. This was much more pleasant. Whatever was growing between them almost felt like friendship, but Draco didn't want to push his luck. Potter had barely started to tolerate him.
The question surprised Harry, and he stopped to think about it for a long moment without finding a satisfactory answer, "Do I?"
“Then trust that things will work themselves out when the moment comes. Harry could do a lot worse than you. Isn’t it every mother’s dream? Your child to get hitched to a doctor?”
The breakfast spread waiting for him on the table did marginally better. He inhaled the first cup of coffee before even touching the food, but the progress he made in raising his spirits was balanced off by the front page of the
“Not that I’m complaining at all, because this was some great sex, but what brought this on?” Harry asked eventually, a finger slowly tracing the crisscrossing scars on Draco’s chest.
"Very slowly and one at a time. We couldn't get to the entire population before our energy was too depleted to continue safely."
“You could start by formulating it as a question instead of an order, assuming I’ll just do whatever you please,” Malfoy mentioned casually.
When he made it to Harry's navel, a dark trail of hair leading down to his cock, Draco stopped to glance up at Harry's face, to enjoy the glazed over look in his eyes and the bitten puffiness of his lips and think that he did that. Just like he made Harry's cock hard and leak enough precum to start dripping from the round head. He couldn't resist the temptation to swipe the tip of his finger through it, watching a vicious string stretch and eventually break between his finger and the head of Harry's cock.
“I’m not afraid of him not forgiving me, Blaise, I know he won’t. He shouldn’t. I wouldn’t.” The cold measured way the words fell from Draco’s lips were a very well-crafted shield for the storm tearing him apart behind clear eyes. Blaise knew when Draco became so detached, it was usually two steps away from breaking, one way or another.
“Did Healer Dana decide when you’re going to get released?” Draco asked halfway through a chess game.
“I mean...” Harry shrugged. “Sounds a little reductive for the amount of history between us but I couldn’t think of a better word. Too early?” he asked with a small smile.
Harry didn't mince his words and Malfoy didn't reply, simply sat watch next to him, waiting for a man who might as well be wandering lost somewhere between the falls and the caves.
Malfoy's hands were white and unmarred again, as if they hadn't been burned red just a few hours prior, but when he met Harry's gaze, they both knew he'd looked like an idiot and there was no way to hide the blush on his cheeks. No amount of tan could save him from the way he turned red and avoided Harry's eyes in favour of discussing the day's work with Hermione and Healer Gupta.
Harry bit his tongue for Hermione's sake, but his blood boiled whenever he saw Malfoy surrounded by simpering people, falling all over each other to express their gratitude. It was a mockery of what they were doing, a distorted mirror, and a disgusting repeat of the same prejudice and privilege structure that destroyed their community. Two women of colour were doing significant work to rebuild the community but it was the white fascist putting plasters on scraped knees and kissing babies that got treated like a hero. And Malfoy let them. He must have missed having his crew of yes men; this must be a nice nostalgic moment, feeling like the big man around.
Comment to shame Harry for the fact that he couldn't resist dragging Ron even while Draco was asking him out.
“Are you trying to get me to go off, mr Potter?” Hanson replied, with a fire already igniting in her eyes, a grin already tugging at Harry’s lips. He didn’t even have to prompt her before she sat down to enlighten him on the fresh nonsense the press was pushing.
"At the beginning of April. We'd stay there for three months, halfway into the monsoon season, but Hermione said she couldn't fit it any other way so we take what we can get."
"I'm sorry for the delay, Taranjit, thank you for your patience. Let's go inside, I'll need to do some introductions before we talk business."
“It’s just… He said the exact same thing when he came by earlier,” He tried to explain, realizing how odd of a question that was.
you were the one to make this a real thing. You coming into my DMs was what made me realize this would truly affect people, maybe just one or two, in a meaningful way. You changed the game and for that I couldn’t be more grateful.
Seamus coming to visit around lunch perked him up a little, he finally had the chance to get caught up with work, actually
“Malfoy?” Harry tried again to get Malfoy’s attention, he needed to know what exactly he’d seen to make him react like that.
"Take my shirt off, Potter," Malfoy whispered, a gentle finger trapping his wrist and prompting him into action.
Whatever happened, the entire population seemed to be affected to different degrees. The few who still were strong enough tried to care for the rest, bedridden and struggling to eat and drink as white whorls slowly overtook their limbs, closing in on their magical cores, leaving their skin bleached like bones under the sun. They went from home to home, witnessing unchanged scenes behind each thin door.
"Are you going to be the one to teach me?" Draco asked, trying to keep his scepticism out of his voice.
Harry pushed himself up and went in the general direction of the entrance and called out Vikram's name to make sure he was okay. Once the muffled reply came through, Harry realised there was little he could do besides go back to the surface and warn everyone not to go back in.
“How else are you going to learn, Potter, from staring longingly into my eyes?” Malfoy asked, unsheathing his wand and pressing it to his temple. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a second. He slowly pulled a long, silvery strand from his head, his shoulders sagging when it detached, hanging from the tip of his wand before he dropped it into the swirling liquid of the pensieve.
Malfoy glanced at the imposing column for a long moment. Harry gave him time to work out his thoughts.
“You’ll be good as new by tomorrow morning.” He said, straightening up and reaching for a towel to get rid of the slimy residue on his hands. “The skin discoloration might linger for a while, but it usually fades with enough time.” He added.
“I am” He replied, stepping back away from the bed. “I’m sorry for interrupting, I’ll leave you to it.” He added, a little stilted, squeezing Teddy’s shoulder once before letting go of him and turning to Andromeda. He bent down to kiss her cheek “I’ll come by for tea another day if you’ll have me.” He murmured. Andromeda nodded, cupping his cheek in a way strikingly similar to what she did with Harry.
“As delightful company as you are when you sleep, I have to stop by the Manor to pick up the Pensieve and I do have a life outside of these walls,” he replied.
"I'm fine," he lied, but couldn't bring himself to reject what little comfort she still had to offer him.
"Unplottable," Yuvarani provided, "and locked them under heavy Muggle-Repelling Charms as well as strict confinement spells. After that they let the cities grow as they pleased, which is how we ended up with these insular communities so close to Muggle cities.  Some are even inside city limits but cut off from the world."
“A tiny stasis field” Draco replied “This way we don’t need to knock you out and it preserves your brain from adverse reactions to total stasis. That said we can still sedate you if you’d rather sleep through the procedure.” Draco offered, people didn’t necessarily like to see healers work on their bodies, and the disconnect from one’s own body wasn’t always a pleasant experience.
But it was too late, Malfoy was already crouched over the water, and a tendril of it was slithering around him like a viper poised to strike.
Harry traced an arc over the frame of the oval mirror with two of his fingers and the surface shimmered for a moment, moving like disturbed water. As soon as the waves settled Draco stood from the bed.
Draco nodded, "She seems nice, mentioned there being a Healer expert in Ayurvedic medicine collaborating with us?"
“I’m sure Potter is more than comfortable.” Malfoy replied, narrowing his eyes at the trainee. His voice was cutting and smooth, as always, but his posture was rigid instead of the usual relaxed grace he wore effortlessly. Something was very wrong with the whole situation and it was making Harry tense.
Harry watched summer turn into fall and then edge into winter, the leaves turn different shades of red and orange and fall down on his windowsill, leaving the trees bare.
“He’s sleeping” Ron said, nodding towards Harry. Malfoy weighed his options for a moment before walking in anyway.
Malfoy sighed and closed his eyes, leaning back against the wall as all the fight left his body. "I suppose I shouldn’t be."
"The tidal bore always does some damage when it gets this high, but not always to this extent. People have learnt how to prepare for the monsoon so the storm doesn't take them by surprise anymore, but the surge in water and air energy can affect the magic. The storm and the tide are a kind of power to be harnessed or avoided but their magic isn’t controlled enough to do either. The wild energy inside them calls to the wide energy outside," Miss Rana explained.
He didn't realise immediately where they'd docked. He was too busy keeping track of every member of their enlarged delegation and trying to spot the consulate employee meant to come and welcome them to pay too much attention to the architecture. It dawned on him when a man with a camera asked if they wanted a polaroid of them walking through the gate.
“The one thing you can do is get better soon and give morale a boost, you’re sorely missed around the department.” He replied “Checkmate. You’re distracted” He commented as his pieces cheered on the board.
He should have known throwing Potter in the mix would do nothing to lessen the pressure, but what alternative did he truly have?
“You know what? Maybe I won’t,” Draco replied, walking up to the bed, looking down at Harry with an air of challenge.
“I have a battery of unusual tests to run on a patient, you’ll be doing most of them, it will be good practice for procedures you might otherwise have to perform in emergency situations.” He explained as they went to the lab to get all the instruments they needed.
“Do you need something?” he asked, walking back up to the bed, when he got there Potter seemed to regret everything about his choices up to this point, avoiding Draco’s eyes at all costs.
Three hours later Harry knew more about Draco’s friends’ sex life than he ever thought he would, and discovered a few kinks he never imagined he could have. And he couldn’t wait for Draco to just come back from France so he could have one on one time with him in the ridiculous king-sized bed he’d seen in the master bedroom.
“I have maybe two of those...” He rubbed the back of his neck, tugging at the collar of his robes as he glanced back at the cabinets lining the walls.
“They have a leg to stand on,” he admitted, running a hand through his hair, exhaustion starting to catch up to him now that he didn’t have to put on a façade for the world.
"Yeah, in school, ten years ago! Then I went in a line of work where I had to learn to rely on my wand alone. Even if I knew how to brew them, we wouldn't have ingredients or time to make them. These people are actively dying."
“You could lose your arm, Potter. Permanently,” Malfoy told him, urging him to reconsider, trying to bring home the reality of the situation.
He let out a slow breath and as his magic expanded to soothe the burn in his palms, he stopped trying to deny Potter was ultimately right about his motivations. He'd been running away and trying to make himself feel better without facing the reality of the effect of his actions. Merlin, he hated to be wrong. Especially when Potter was the one who was right.
“What you asked for, Master Malfoy,” he said handing him the board. “And what you didn’t,” he added, dropping the lunch on the table before disappearing.
“I promised you a good fuck, didn’t I?” Draco hummed, running a soothing hand down Harry’s side. “Are you ok bottoming?”
She recognised the order and simplicity of a low resource operation as they slowly made their way through, past the Magizoologist pavilion and the kitchens, towards the medical tent.
“Yes! We went on Saturday and I have so many new books. I can’t wait to start classes again, and Ginny helped me train a little more when we went to the burrow. You’ll see, I’ll make the team, Kenny, our seeker, graduated last year and Ginny said I got much better this summer. She thinks I’d be a good seeker.” Teddy beamed as he reported his progress to Harry. He barely took a breath before delving into detailed recounts of his latest training session with Ginny and asking about Harry’s time as a seeker for Gryffindor. Harry was more than happy to indulge him, retelling the most exciting games and sharing strategy and techniques he’d learned during his years on the team.
Harry hummed and helped her get rid of her scarf and coat, shoving them unceremoniously into her pouch, still envious of the ease she had around Extension Charms, then he headed out to the dock with the rest of the delegation. Foster caught up to him as soon as they stepped out into the late afternoon sun.
He wanted to scream. Twenty-eight tests run and not a step closer to figuring Potter out. He set the list on fire, watching it burn with a grim sense of satisfaction that for a precious moment overcame the pervasive sense of desperation filling his chest. It didn’t last long, soon the list was in ashes and Potter was looking at him with concern shining in his eyes, he was losing it in front of a patient, in front of Potter. He was better than that, he was supposed to be in control, comfort his charges no matter how desperate the situation looked. He took a slow breath re-centring himself.
Malfoy was his old rival, one who’d shared a lot of trauma with him and now an accomplished healer working on him, nothing more.
mentioned was the involvement of a St Mungo’s Healer in international organized crimes,” Draco explained. “I’ll give you three guesses on who among the people in this room the press assumed that Healer is.” Draco shot Ron a murderous glare.
Draco walked inside the hospital easily sidestepping the small group of reporters still waiting to get news about their fallen saint Potter. He only had one day before the preliminary hearing and he had to make the most of it. He had a long list of possible causes for Potter’s conditions and he had to test for each one.
"Well, that was interesting," he commented, chasing it with a bit of tea. The mint and spice reminded him of long days in the Maghreb, of couscous eaten around campfires. "How much do you know about the job ahead?" he asked, buttering a piece of toast.
It was nearing Christmas when Draco got back to France to his warm home and a thick envelope from Pansy, full of the transcribed old scrolls he hadn't dared hope she could track down.
The Privacy Charms around their table allowed the conversation to flow easily, undisturbed by the other patrons of the restaurant and, as captivated as Draco was by Healer Gupta's recount of the end of her field training, channelling the change of the season and oncoming monsoon to cleanse an entire family's curse damage, Granger's self-satisfied smile didn't escape his notice.
The last rays of sun tinged the sky blood red, orange and purple when he stepped out on the perfectly trimmed grass. The light of the dying day lined in gold the few clouds dotting the sky above him, and the lights of the city started painting the view as the sky grew darker.
There was a niggling sensation in the back of his head telling him something was wrong, and he couldn’t put his finger on it, which only made it more annoying. He read through the list while he rode the elevator down. It was standard stock, almost nothing tailor-made, he should have asked what the procedure was exactly. Either way, there was no conceivable way the hospital could have run out of stock for all the brews marked missing. Sure, they had a few more poisonings than usual but nothing catastrophic enough to warrant this level of stock depletion.
Malfoy was right about jumping to conclusions, Harry needed to be careful about his case, gather an overwhelming abundance of evidence to build a case that could withstand the closest scrutiny. He wanted it to be closed for good.
“There are safeguards that prevent any magic from interfering with the mark. From what we know of the man that crafted it, probably lethal safeguards. Muggle was the only way I could get it,” he explained.
“Fine, I’m not averse to the idea but you’re not worth putting my career on the line over.” And wasn’t that a bald-faced lie. Why was Malfoy lying to him?
I'm not entirely happy with how this chapter turned out but at least we got into some plot and things are moving along a little bit.
“But it doesn’t erase Healer Malfoy’s responsibility. And until the investigation is over we believe reasonable to suspend him without pay.” Andrews stated. Draco took a slow breath, it was fine, if Dana could fix Potter quickly enough he would be fine.
“I don’t have to,” Blaise replied with a soft hum. “Draco, you’re my brother, I want to,” he told him softly, getting a vague sound of assent from Draco. He wasn’t sure he was going to remember this talk at all in the morning, but what was important was that he knew it now.
"I'm doing my best, Potter," he whispered, "But I can't change the past any more than you can. I can only go forward and do better, be better."
Potter lulled him into a false sense of security. The illusion of being a valued member of the operation, where his opinion would be valued and his expertise respected popped like a soap bubble on concrete as soon as they reached the summit and crossed into Unplottable land. Potter had been right to say it was much bigger than what they worked with before, which meant setting up operations in a smart way. As soon as he started giving directions on how to divide healing stations and where to set up the bit of hardware they had, he realised there were too many Brits for his authority to have any kind of weight.
“Say, McReary, is there any chance I could take a peek at the logbooks to know when the next shipping of ingredients comes in?” he asked, as polite and agreeable he could manage, unthreatening as he could ever be.
Hermione clutched the piece of parchment in her fist and stood up. She got him on board, now it was all a matter of pushing bureaucracy along and she'd made a career out of that. The drive back to El-Tarif seemed much shorter, she was too caught up in her machinations to notice the changing scenery as they got back in the city and to her hotel. She sent a message to Blaise back in London through the Direct Diplomatic Pouch to start drawing up the project plan. She was going to need security, and to make contact with local government, local Healers and activists.
A gentle push of Draco’s hand sent Harry flat on the bed, bouncing a little on the mattress. He stared, hypnotised by how Draco could manage to somehow still look graceful crawling out of his trousers and Banishing his thick socks somewhere on the floor.
Potter could reasonably still be recovering from the tap, he’d have to check in at the end of the day or even the next morning and see if anything changed.
Draco nodded, "I'm not that boy anymore, Granger, and I think you know it or you wouldn't have put all that effort into tracking me down."
"One usually doesn't stack the odds against oneself," Draco countered. "How bad did Potter take it? He looked ready to Apparate directly back to London when he saw me."
Draco was fascinated by the sculptures dotting the border of the magical wards, as if they were guarding and protecting the community from outside influence.
Harry hurried back up to his room to shower and get down to breakfast. He almost asked Foster to switch groups, given how Malfoy had managed to stay behind the previous day, and Merlin knew who he met and what he did after they left him and Griffith behind on the island. Hermione's stern look made him reconsider. He needed to gather more evidence of Malfoy's misdeeds so she would be persuaded before he made a move that blatant. He held back and tried not to step on anyone's feet, content to observe as Hermione gathered all the elders, the ones who were less removed from the last guru that survived in the community after Britain swooped in, destroying gurukuls and eradicating gurus. Yuvarani worked hard to translate the fast-paced speech of Professor Chambers. He tried to keep up with what they were talking about, charms were charms after all, but soon enough they went into the harnessing of weather and life force that was too far outside his field of specialisation to make heads or tails either in English or Bengali.
Even just with the help of a Structural Support Charm easing the weight of her chest the girl seemed to breathe more easily. He cast a simple Deeper Vision Charm on himself and got to work.
"Is this a sick joke?" he asked, his eyes flitting between Draco and the man in front of them. "I… We… you know that it isn't possible, right? I made you study the family tree."
Blaise nodded “Testament to their authenticity, Healer Malfoy has nothing to gain by submitting them if they weren’t true.”
Granger hummed. "I think he will try to be civil at least for a while and I would like you to do the same. I'll keep him out of your hair as much as possible but you know how he is…"
He talked to Foster and Hermione and they agreed to let him stay overnight instead of hiking back. He expected Malfoy to be a lot harder to convince, but he agreed as soon as Harry proposed it over breakfast.
The island had been hit with a tidal bore of 16 feet that badly damaged the docks and some of the buildings, among which was the field hospital, not sturdy enough to withstand the combined attack of the sea and the storm.
Harry dozed off a little when they got too technical about energy transference and magical signatures, waking only when Hermione was getting ready to leave, Draco stood to help her with her cloak.
Harry was glad he’d picked some plain black briefs. A lone thought was spared for the duckies-patterned boxers in the bottom of the backpack, back at the hotel. This would have been a very different scene; he couldn’t help but suspect Draco would be merciless in his teasing if he caught Harry wearing those. A giggle escaped Harry’s lips at the image.
It took a couple hours to finish closing his wound, Healer Dana told him so when he asked. Two hours with Malfoy curved over him, the strangely familiar spark of his magic washing over him, making him whole again. She helped him drink down the blood replenisher while Malfoy vanished all the blood from his torso and lifted the stasis by taking off the tiny cloth squares from his body. Harry shivered as sensation immediately flooded back into his body, it was hot and cold and then like his entire torso had fallen asleep and was now full of ants. It only lasted a couple of seconds, thankfully.
"You know he doesn't collaborate with the British government. He's here at the pleasure of the Maharashtrian administration," Hermione reminded him. "Besides, you won't be wanting time to pester him, we're scheduled to be here until the monsoon."
“What does it mean?” Harry asked, looking back down to the sharp crisp lines and the intimately realistic feel of the scroll on Malfoy’s skin, the curl of the paper, the warmth of the shadows.
Once they were all sitting at the sturdy kitchen table, with Ron's delicious food in front of them and the warm light of the afternoon bathing the room in a way that made it feel like a perfect memory than a real moment, Harry knew he had to break the news now or he never would.
“This is where my roots are, Blaise, I won’t be eradicated by malicious use of bureaucracy of all things,” he declared, the steel coming back to his voice for a moment.
“I believe I have heard somewhere that sleep is beneficial to a wizard’s health, Master Malfoy, but I’ve yet to witness any behaviour from you to support that claim. Wouldn’t it be interesting to test the theory?” Soup mentioned, clearing out the empty mugs somewhere around two a.m.
"Poddar," Draco repeated, the softer syllables falling easily from his lips. He glanced at the small table between them and the papers where the family tree was growing, each name etched in Draco's tidy calligraphy with blank spaces where Potter's heraldic research had failed him.
The weekend was spent in various states of undress, in various rooms of the house. It took three days for them to make their way down Draco’s extensive list of kinks, negotiating boundaries between them, sharing any previous experience they had and any desire to explore unknown territory together. The progress was hindered by the frequent breaks they took, whenever the clear-headed discussion got fogged over by irresistible arousal. Funnily enough, their discussion of orgasm control and maybe denial was interrupted by Harry sucking Draco off to a very satisfying end against the kitchen island.
Malfoy hummed, slipping the list in his pocket. “You’re right, you shouldn’t, I’m sure you have everything Andrews needs,” he replied, leaning closer to the window and rattling off a few potions from the list and a few he suspected would be missing from stock. McReary’s cheerful smile slowly twisted in a grimace.
Draco should have known better than to let himself get slightly buzzed on champagne. If he'd kept his guard up, it wouldn't have been so easy for Granger and Blaise to ambush him as the party got in full swing after midnight.
"Let the people rebuild their hospital and help me teach them how to protect themselves," Healer Gupta replied simply.
“We messed everything up but I think it was because we tried to do the right thing the wrong way around.” Harry offered Draco his hand with a small smile. “Do you want to give this another try?”
"Saving your ungrateful arse from unknown curses! What I was hired to do," Harry replied, cradling his arm close to his chest as the burning sensation settled deep in the muscle, already starting to spread from where the water touched him.
“I have plans for you,” Draco whispered. His hot breath sent shivers down Harry’s back and he could already taste another kiss on his tongue.
“Don’t worry about it, I love the little rascals.” Harry grinned, tickling Rose with his good hand. “‘Mione’s been complaining about your extra hours, were you down at the office this morning too?” he asked, unable to resist the temptation to ask.
“Are you going to take it?” He asked with barely contained excitement. Draco had told him how much he’d wanted that job.
"Fine, if you're that desperate. I'm on board. Send me a letter when you have your ducks in a row and ready to Portkey out. You know where I live." He stood and picked up his empty glass to return it to the sink to wash.
“You can’t. You don’t have access to the potions lab here, which is how we find ourselves in this situation,” Weasley pointed out, more tired than anything else, the worry in his blue eyes painfully clear. It wasn’t lost on Draco how Weasley was implying that if he’d had access to the lab, they wouldn’t have illegal activities being run there. He wanted to linger on that unspoken trust and let it warm him through, but there was something more urgent to focus on.
He stared back at his healer, a multitude of emotions swirling like storm clouds inside the grey eyes fixed on him but looking a thousand miles away.
There was some kind of commotion going on outside and he wondered if there was another major emergency being dealt with right outside his door. It was unsettling being so acutely aware of the world going on around him while he waited. It was weird in the worst way because it felt
Much as he would have liked to spend his time off watching Potter and Foster set up better protections for the village against the fury of the river, he thought his time would be better employed tagging along with Healer Gupta and Professor Chambers to see what he could pick up in the ways of Bengali magical practises. He sat with the children, watching as they carefully applied henna to their hands and arms, mimicking the pattern on their parents as they practised patience and precision needed to harness the wild energy that grew within them.
Draco nodded, drawing small circles over the back of Harry’s hand with his thumb, encouraging to go on.
“Fair, anything else?” Harry asked once the pain subsided, pushed aside by a different warmth filling his chest as he gasped for air.
Harry touched the polished banister, barely registering what Draco was saying. This was his house. There was a place where his great-grandparents had lived, generations before him, and it was still there, with the same magic, Draco had put it back together.
Draco left Harry’s room after giving him his pain relievers, with death in his heart, about ready to get into a bottle of Firewhiskey. Of course, Potter would serve himself up on a silver platter right when it would be immoral for Draco to reach out and take him, and when it would stop being against any and all ethical and deontological rule in the book, he was still lying to Potter on a daily basis, gaslighting him. That wasn’t the best basis for any healthy relationship. He knew by the time Potter would be discharged he’d hate Draco enough to want to kill him, let alone date him. He couldn’t put words to the twist in his guts as he thought about those bright green eyes on him, clear and open and vulnerable.
“You also hoped it would allow you space to experiment with questionable magic completely legally,” he added not even bothering to turn. Draco squinted at his back, he was definitely rubbing off on him.
“Alright, alright, I’m going to bed.” Draco relented with a sigh, waving his wand and sending all his notes neatly inside a folder before heading to bed for a few hours of sleep.
Hermione hummed, “Always pegged Harry for a bit of a masochist,” she commented. Draco couldn’t disagree, but there was no way to politely agree with a statement like that.
Draco couldn't help the smile that came to his lips at the cheerful accusatory tone she took. "I wouldn't dare, Miss Rana," he replied.
Harry raised his eyes to look at Malfoy and he didn't need an apology, another one. He didn't need words anymore.
“And who knows, maybe he will actually put some pressure on the central government now that he has a finger in the cause,” she mentioned.
"Is this a joke to you? A paid vacation where you could go enjoy the stay and live like a gentleman of leisure at England's expense?"
“You feel so fucking good, stretched around my cock, Harry.” He set a slow sensual pace, trying to drag it out as long as he could, but soon enough he could feel himself drawing closer and closer to the brink.
Ever since he first started he’d been under constant scrutiny and consistently denied the leeway to make mistakes that was afforded to his peers. Spite was mostly what moved him to excel. Spite and pride and a deep-seated desperation to make something good of himself. If they were going to question his every move he was going to give them nothing to question. He built up an impressive survival rate among his patients and he knew protocol like he knew his own name.
“You’re going to be fine.” Malfoy told him, the hard steel returning to his voice as he got up and touched the tip of his wand to the hospital crest on his uniform “Dana, I need you in Potter’s room immediately.” Harry could hear the woman’s voice confirming she’d received the message and she was on her way coming back clear through the communication spell.
“Alright, mr Potter, we’re fixing your chest today.” She announced with a bright smile. “I’ll go get a blood replenisher and the stasis delimitators and leave you in Healer Malfoy’s very capable hands for a moment.” She added, gently squeezing Draco’s shoulder.
Harry offered up his arm, pinned down by the dark eyes of the phoenix peeking out between Malfoy's neck and his shoulder. He didn't notice the golden flames surrounding Malfoy's hand until it closed over the point of impact of the curse. The cool comfort of Malfoy's palm soothed the stiffness and burning of the curse spreading through him, and minute by minute the white tendrils insinuating around his chest started to retreat, leaving behind brown, unmarred skin, as they it had never been there. He wasn't sure how long it took, too mesmerised by the changing light of the heatless flames surrounding Malfoy's hand as it burned every trace of Dark Magic from him.
"Are you going to tell me where we're going or should I treat this as a kidnapping?" he asked as soon as he spotted Harry coming towards him.
It took a bit of manoeuvring on Malfoy's part, switching hands of his wand, but eventually, he dropped the shirt on the wet cave floor.
“Yes Potter, I favour hardworking trainees over entitled little prats. You should have seen that coming, even though it might be somewhat of an alien concept to you.” Malfoy replied, refilling his glass before sitting down on the chair next to the bed, leafing through the notes as Harry ate. Harry dropped the topic, he knew when not to push, despite what the record might show.
They emerged from the gorge and the gentle slopes of dunes met them. Hermione squinted against the glare of the sun in the perfectly clear sky above them. Skilfully hidden under privacy and Muggle-Repelling Charms, was an entire camp. One moment there were only sand and sky in front of her until they kissed at the horizon, and a moment later, they crossed the limit of the wards, and a small city of tents and temporary infrastructure appeared like a mirage in the heat haze rising from the ground.
“I’m here quite often to be honest.” Harry replied with a friendly smile “But it’s good to know at least someone is happy about it.” He added.
Warnings Harry feels left behind by his friends/family finding their soulmates and building families of their own. To make himself feel better he gets drunk and has a horrible hook up.
“Auror Potter’s safety has not been compromised by Healer Malfoy’s actions at all, quite the opposite in fact.” Blaise stepped in again, pulling Andrews’ attention “As the reports clearly show Healer Malfoy followed procedure to stabilize him and stepped outside the sanctioned limits only when Auror Potter proved unresponsive to conventional treatment, effectively saving his life. Auror Potter is suffering no negative consequences from Healer Malfoy’s actions.”
“I will do my very best,” Harry promised. He was too invested in his own recovery now to do something to jeopardise it. “Oh, and, Malfoy?” he called when the man turned around to leave.
Draco’s right hand was absently rubbing his chest, a comforting gesture Blaise had watched him pick up soon after he got the tattoo. Blaise thought he’d never have to see that kind of uncertainty in Draco’s eyes, certainly not over Potter.
“Fine, but I get to pick where you take her,” Malfoy replied with a smile. He didn’t seem too upset about losing, Harry would almost say he looked satisfied, which was not at all the reaction he expected from Malfoy being bested by Ron at anything.
“It’s not a done deal yet, but I want to explore the option seriously,” Draco replied honestly. “Don’t look at me like that, France is not that far. I could fly there on a broom and back in a day trip and we have direct Floo lines,” Draco defended when he saw the helpless look on Harry’s face.
“As soon as I get out of the hospital we can go flying together again,” He promised “so you can show me all the new tricks you’ve learned.” He smiled, squeezing his shoulder.
We're veering into angst territory and we got a glimpse of what happened during that 14 years gap between hogwarts and the present. The pieces will come together eventually but I look forward to hearing what theories you have on it, and of course where I'm taking this.
“He just passed out while I was telling him about finishing the investigation into his accident, must be exhausted,” Ron commented with a chuckle.
A young woman poked her head in and smiled at him. She couldn't have been older than twenty, a colourful hijab in vibrant shades of green was neatly wrapped around her head. "I hope I'm not bothering you, Draco ji, I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Tvarika Rana, I'll be your interpreter for your stay," she introduced herself.
“You were the one to say I needed practice,” Harry replied with a shrug and a small smile, “and Ron’s not around to play,” he added a little morosely. Ron’s absence grated him. He should be happy, it meant there was progress being made at the Ministry, enough to keep him busy; but it was progress he was cut out from. Now that they found a way to keep him involved, his inability to work made him even more anxious to get back into it and made his idleness even more insufferable.
having any more of Draco’s teasing, pushing back against his fingers like he would die if he didn’t get something inside him sooner than yesterday.
"Siddhima ji, it's wonderful to see you again. Can I introduce you to our head of medical personnel Draco Malfoy?"
Saying that he’d forgotten all about the tabled discussion with Harry by the time he got home would be a lie, but for sure some new topics of discussion had come up, and Draco needed celebrations, the kind that didn’t need extensive negotiations first.
Malfoy frowned in concentration, probably trying to recall the name."Bhang Thandai?" It sounded almost like a question as his lips tentatively tried to shape the syllables.
"Didn't want to be associated with a certain snot-nosed, tiny blond arsehole I'd met a week prior." Harry grinned to himself.
"It's not a question of how, Malfoy, it's a question of why," Potter interjected. "It's the new fashionable thing to do. We need someone committed who isn't going to baulk when things go wrong, who's going to know when to tread lightly."
Harry resigned himself to being a lab rat for a while, trying to keep up with the exchanges happening between Malfoy and the two trainees after every test that turned out negative or unhelpful. As they crossed things off the list he could almost taste Malfoy’s frustration growing, which did nothing to help his unease with being constantly touched by strangers that had a tad too little regard for being gentle.
They stopped in front of a wrought-iron gate, the metal spikes curled and twisted into delicate vines and the hinges moved silently when Taranjit pushed it open. The garden was bare, with newly planted flowers dotting the aired soil, along with what looked like an ancient tree a little ways away from the house. They walked along the stone path up to the steps leading to the arched entrance.
"The British Ministry of Magic has never addressed the damage done to other magical communities during the colonial empire and some, most I would say, are still struggling to get back on their feet after gaining independence. I want to do something about that now that I have the resources, and I'm going to start with West Bengal. I'm going to help the development of schools, try to rebuild traditional magical practices the empire tried to eradicate, reach out to isolated magical communities and promote their inclusion in the education system," Hermione started to explain her plan of attack.
"Not yet." Pansy summoned a stool in front of the mirror "Sit." she ordered. He did, still staring at himself in the mirror. The perfectly creased trousers, the belt, the hair, he was only missing the darned cane. He took a deep breath, feeling the waistcoat resist against the push of his chest, giving him something to focus on.  He closed his eyes, focusing on Pansy’s hands in his hair and the music floating in from the living room, the slow build and flow of the strings lulling him back into calm. He gradually settled into the weight of his clothes, embracing the feeling of being contained, protected, held up, his friends were lending him strength and he was going to welcome it, let it fill him.
“I just want to make things better,” Draco whispered, his voice raw with the effort not to let go, his eyes getting watery as he tried desperately not to cry in front of the enormity of that task, one he could never measure up to.
He ended up staying for a light dinner and only left when it started getting late for his appointment with the others. He imagined Pansy would not appreciate his tardiness. He found her already waiting in his living room, chatting with Soup. He instantly felt the stab of guilt for not warning he wasn't coming back for dinner.
The worst of the angst is passed, we're heading towards happy ending zone and we're doing it through Luna's intervention.
“I think I know what happened there too.” Draco admitted, tugging on the strap of his holster, not quite meeting her eyes “I believe the residue hasn’t been around Potter’s wound ever since he got out of surgery. We didn’t notice it had moved because we were monitoring its quantity not its position. We assumed that residue doesn’t just migrate on its own.” He started laying out his theory, it was the only one that made sense “Potter flatlined while I was elbow deep into his core, and as soon as he started dying all the power in his body retreated back inside him, including the extraneous magic I had connected him to by opening his core. When I pulled out and his heart started beating again it must have settled where it was, coagulating around itself and Potter’s core.” He finished, looking up from his hands to her face.
“We’ll go down the list until we find the hat that fits the head if you know what I mean.” sent the parchment floating over the head of the bed and arranged the tray in a corner.
Harry sighed and aimed his wand, carefully levitating the thing out of the water. As the dark liquid sluiced off it, slowly, as if trying to cling to it, an intricate tiger shaped brooch came to light, and Harry encased it with the strongest Containment Spell he could manage. As soon as the last line was drawn around it and it was cut off from its environment, the water cleared up, going back to its stillness and transparency.
"Malfoy was a child soldier like any of us, he had the misfortune of ending on the wrong side of a conflict much bigger than him. When the chips were down, he refused to identify Harry, buying us the chance to escape. At the end of the Battle of Hogwarts he defected in front of everyone and joined the fight against Voldemort. Too little, too late, but I believe it shows his potential for change."
In the following few days, Draco felt the mayhem the sting unleashed on the delicate balance of hospital politics. Andrews had to step back and actually manage his ward, instead of networking to get the Chief Medical Officer nomination, leaving the rest of the sharks scrambling for it. Then he heard he’d been taken off the leadership of the potions and poisons department entirely, and Moreschi had been nominated interim CMO. He tried to stay as far from it as possible, focusing on his trainees and praying that the labs wouldn’t crap out on him again due to inconsistent leadership. Soon Hogwarts students would come home, and he couldn’t have an understocked hospital when that happened.
There's a lot more Draco, a little more Teddy, almost nothing of what you actually want. But there is a little bit of plot so I consider this another win.
The table was much smaller than the one from the previous night. Granger and Potter were already there, chatting with the translator.
“I wouldn’t call them fun,” Harry replied with a small smile. “Do you and Malfoy coordinate greetings?” he asked after a moment.
“You’re thinking very loudly, Potter,” Malfoy hummed, wiping the excess soap from his face and applying aftershave.
to be bigger and better than everyone else in the room, so you go around and play hero to feed your ego, don't you? This is your little game, fix some bones and be worshipped like some kind of messiah."
“Do you play chess?” he asked, taking pity on him. Potter nodded enthusiastically at the idea. “I’ll see if I can get you a self-playing board to keep you entertained,” he promised, watching Potter’s face flood with relief before turning around again and actually leaving to check in on his other patients.
They did end up getting street food, because Potter was like that. Draco ran a few diagnostics before he allowed either of them to eat anything out of a cart, but he had to admit the panipuris were indeed delicious, almost worth getting caught halfway across the city when another storm set in. Umbrella Charms were completely useless. They Apparated to the closest spot and ran the rest of the way, the warm rain sluicing down their faces as they ran full pelt against the rising wind laughing with the roaring of the approaching storm. They both looked like drowned rats when they finally made it back to the hotel and the receptionist offered to arrange a restorative soak at the spa to make sure they didn't catch their death. Still completely out of breath and full of unexplainable energy, as if keyed into the storm building right outside, Draco could only nod, knowing Potter was doing the same behind him.
“I...” Harry reached up and covered Draco’s hand, threading their fingers together. “I want you to have all the power, at least for a while,” Harry replied, pulling Draco’s arm tighter around himself. “I want… I want you to take me in hand, and set the rules of the game.” Harry breathed slowly, he knew Draco could feel his heartbeat with his lips lightly pressed against Harry’s neck and his palm against his chest, he had to know how fast Harry’s heart was beating as he prepared to speak again. “I want you to call me ‘Potter’ like you used to, like you owned that name, like you owned
"Shut up, she is, and she was stunning in the costumes I made for the royal opera house." Pansy lifted her chin defiant.
“Potter. Did I wake you?” he asked, almost apologetic, his hands still marking the spot on the books.
He pressed the tip of his wand to it and in a few moments an address in the south of France was burned into it in Malfoy's loopy handwriting.
“I just want to see you happy,” Blaise told him, letting Draco tuck his head under his chin. “I will set the world on fire to protect you, but I can’t protect you from yourself,” he murmured, slowly rubbing his arm.
Comment and let me know if you knew who Kópakonan is or you had to google her when you read it in the tags.
Harry had taken his godfatherly duties very seriously and his hair braiding skills, while still not on par with Ron's, were more than adequate.
“I’m just glad I didn’t have to deal with the unspeakables. They had to go out and obliviate half of London. Muggle law enforcement got involved. It was a whole mess.” Seamus mentioned, chuckling as he shook his head.
“Thank you.” He kissed Harry’s cheek and touched the surface of the mirror, letting his hand sink in. “Good luck, Guru Hari-ji.”
"Not if I have a say in the matter," Draco conceded. It seemed to be enough of an answer for her to be satisfied.
Draco couldn’t help the weak chuckle at that; he pressed the heel of his hand against his forehead, thinking of the near heart attack Potter gave him when he decided it would be a good idea to leave the hospital to have dinner at the Weasleys’.
Harry turned to look at his face, the hesitance and anticipation swirling in his grey eyes couldn’t be masked by a tentative smile.
"Can you heal them?" he asked Malfoy, the weight of the people's hopeful looks was too much to bear alone.
“How? You have a boner so big for protocol it’s not even funny,” Blaise joked before catching on to the extent of Draco’s worries about the situation. “Ok, walk me through what happened,” he told him softly, leaning closer, resting his elbows on his knees listening to Draco.
He told him so explicitly when they went to visit the enclave on Gharapuri. They were on a speedboat flying over the waves towards the island when Potter brought it up apropos nothing.
Harry couldn’t resist the temptation and leaned in to bite at the soft skin of Draco’s neck, sucking until a mark bloomed under his lips, darker than the pink blush reaching his chest.
"Allow me to dispel the notion that England is paying for me in any way. While it may have been Ambassador Granger who tracked me down personally to recruit me for this diplomatic mission, I'm here at the pleasure of the Bengali government, who is paying for my stay. But that's not what got your golden panties in a twist, is it, Potter? You don't care about something as vile as money."
Draco is just tired with life in general, Harry is bored and things just can't seem to go Draco's way.
They stared at each other in silence for long moments, only Harry's panting breath between them and the shock coursing through them at the raw truth spilt between them.
Draco nodded and gestured for her to take a seat. "It's a pleasure to meet you, and I have to thank you in advance for your invaluable work. I'm afraid I will be wholly dependent on you." He smiled a bit self-consciously as he took a seat in front of her at the small table beneath the window. He usually tried to learn at least a little bit of the language before leaving for a mission, so as to not be entirely helpless, but there just hadn't been enough time for it.
The flicker of hope for something besides work that sparked in Draco's chest in that moment was quickly squashed the following morning.
And then there was Malfoy playing hero, gloating and showing off, laughing with the locals like this was some kind of game to him, a different kind of vacation.
By the time they had an organized list it was the end of Draco’s shift, Dana had left to take care of an emergency a couple of hours earlier, letting him and Finnigan finalize the list.
Where was Pansy when he needed her? Living fancy and seducing French models, leaving him and Soup to keep this vaguely Draco-shaped mess together while he did his best to self-destruct.
"I'm aware. Have you been talking to my mother? Are you going to offer me some young virgin in marriage as well?" Draco replied.
“Healer Malfoy, we’re here to open the investigation on your misconduct regarding the care of Auror Potter, in particular the use of unsanctioned magic during his emergency procedure.” Draco stood straight under the scrutiny of the committee while Andrews read out the allegations.
Draco sighed, tracing the flourished curls of the P taking over the bottom side of the parchment. He loved Pansy dearly, and he certainly appreciated her craftmanship, her art, but he’d wished he could spare her the trouble this one time. There was going to be no triumphant exit from the hospital the following afternoon, radiant in Pansy’s elaborate garments. Not even Blaise could save him this time. He’d slipped. No, it hadn’t been a slip, he’d known what he was getting into, it was no mistake. He’d taken a calculated risk to save Potter’s life and ended up setting his career on fire.
He didn’t even realize how familiar those patterns were as he slowly fell asleep in the gradually darkening room.
"Look, if things go wrong Griffith isn't going to hesitate to reach out to me, but his underlings don't know that, and they don't want to remember that whatever Griffith is doing he learnt from me. You're getting the best of both worlds, really."
Malfoy surprised him again by actually getting up and heading towards the discreet door connecting their suites. "I look forward to our breakfasts, Potter," he called before disappearing back into his room.
“He’s in a terribly inconvenient position, you see, he usually has Hermione to discuss academics, but she absolutely refuses to consider divination in any academic context.” She explained with a fond smile, making Harry giggle at the memory of Hermione’s contentious relationship with the divinatory arts.
As he walked out Draco was plotting a course of action. Supposing Potter had a bond with someone it could be interfering with the recovery. Bonds, especially accidental ones were unpredictable and messy affairs, so he needed to understand how this one came to be. And then there was the decay of the residue or lack thereof. The patch was still holding but it wouldn’t last forever.
Harry woke up with a gasp, reaching for his notebook to try and write down all the details before they escaped him.
Malfoy hadn’t nicked him once so far, and Harry was sure he wouldn’t. But he could. He could do anything he wanted, and he was giving Harry a thorough shave, telling him in a low soothing voice how Pansy and Daphne were about to leave for France and then Milan to showcase Pansy’s new collection. He caught some mention of Blaise missing his wife terribly and becoming mopey and needy and clingy whenever they left… There was an unexpected fondness in Malfoy’s tone, but Harry was too busy ignoring his embarrassing erection to pay too much attention to the finer details.
He breathed slowly, meditating to pass the time; they were going to have a lot of it to kill. After a while, he carefully clenched his fist and shook out the stiffness settling in his fingers.
Thank you to Jay for the beta work on this chapter and for being the voice of reason that made me stop fussing and just post this already.
He walked slowly along the same street he'd taken that first afternoon, carrying around the weight of the day and so much more. The air slowly cooled around him, bringing some relief from the sweat beading his forehead. The Gurdwara was exactly where he remembered it, and the same aching nostalgia squeezed his heart. How he could miss something he never had he couldn't quite explain, but behind those doors there were years of his family's traditions that he was robbed of. He took off his shoes and covered his head before taking a further step inside. He followed the sound of cooking and the steps of other temple goers until he found the kitchen and he could sit down among strangers he could barely share a couple words with and do his part to prepare langar. It didn't take long for people around him to understand he didn't speak Bengali further than
“I have it under control, don’t worry,” Malfoy replied with a placating wave of his hand. “Go wrangle the trainees, Aadhya.”
“Cleanup can wait, come here,” he told him, tugging gently until Draco relented and laid down, wrapping an arm around Harry’s shoulders as soon as he cuddled up against Draco’s side.
He did end up visiting Paediatrics once or twice and, much to everyone’s delight, he lost a few more games of chess, not all of them on purpose.
“Next time you decide to risk your life for mine without telling me, you better die because I’m killing you myself as soon as I find out,” Harry threatened.
Malfoy had brought him his own board. He picked up the white bishop looking at it, wondering what it meant. Did Malfoy had it laying around? Did he usually play chess at the hospital? What did Malfoy do with his downtime anyway?
"Yeah," Harry stirred his soup slowly, the clench at his stomach prevented him from enjoying it, not even the warmth of it in his belly was any comfort.
“I have to go back to work, not all of us get extended vacations just for dying a little,” Draco replied, standing up and straightening his uniform.
He pushed himself up on an elbow and reached out hesitantly. The last curl of the phoenix’s tail curled over Draco’s hip, brushing right above the elastic band of his underwear.
I'm preemptively notching up the rating because my outline reads "boning" at some point but it's a long way away still.
He knew Potter hated it, hated the admiration and show of gratitude the people insisted on bestowing on him. He carried it written on his face as much as he avoided looking at Draco as if he was transparent, a ghost of an unpleasant memory. That's why he noticed when Potter's eyes snapped to him and he bristled when he heard the man serving them food address him with their nickname and such a high honorific. There was no way he was going to let it lie.
Draco covered his mouth with a hand as he gasped and struggled to remember. "I have absolutely no recollection of it happening." He shook his head. "But I don't struggle to believe you. Merlin's balls. I blew two separate chances of being your friend and I can't even remember the first."
"Harry, this is Taranjit Singh, Taranjit, this is Harry Potter. You two are cousins, too many times removed to bother to count, but you're of the same blood."
“Well, I have two functioning arms and an intact torso. I still look fresher than you.” Malfoy shot back.
"She got sick and the supplies of potions that could have saved her were contaminated. After she died the quality control standards got raised to avoid less than reputable suppliers getting inside hospitals at the very least," he explained.
"You never failed me, Mother, never. You did everything you could to protect me, went to unimaginable distances to ensure my safety and happiness. I will never forget it and you shouldn't either." He held his mother's eyes, watching her face twist as she tried to fight tears back, even alone she’d still try to keep her front in place.
“I don’t have an office anymore and the trainees are getting on my nerves with their scrambling for their exams,” Draco explained. “You have a quiet private room, you’re technically my patient since Dana assigned you to me and I’m working on your case. So, I have reasonable cause to be here.” He finished folding up the parchment with his notes and sliding it into one of the books.
"What I need, you cannot give me. I need for my roots not to have been burned out of the ground. I need for my house not to have been destroyed and torn apart, for my family not to have been eradicated."
It was Sunday, Ron’s day off, so soon he’d be able to wheedle news of the case out of him and finally stop feeling so horribly cut off from the rest of the department while such progress was being made.
“I’m just really bored… going mad kind of bored,” he admitted after a long moment of embarrassed silence. Draco hummed, a smile tugging at his lips at the obvious discomfort Potter found himself in, confessing something as frivolous as boredom.
“Should I be expecting that kind of proposal as well?” He joked, spreading a hand over Draco’s chest, a small smile tugging at the corner of his lips.
"About a decade outdated, but I suppose fairly accurate," Draco finished for him, ending his misery.
“Then?” It came out in a rushed breath, the question suspended in the air between them until Malfoy averted his eyes again.
“It’s ok, it wasn’t a bad split, despite what the prophet reported.” He replied “Anyway, I’m pretty confident I didn’t get married recently either.” he added, his eyes fell on the ring on Malfoy’s finger. Did he though? He was about to ask but Malfoy was talking again.
And then Potter stormed in, taking the stand as if it had personally offended him. It was clear he wasn't any happier than Draco about being in that room. His gaze leveraged accusations against him that the Wizengamot could only begin to imagine as he was subjected to the indignity of taking Veritaserum and being interrogated about the incident in the Forbidden Forest the night of the Battle of Hogwarts. Draco could see him fight every word that spilled from his lips. He could see the distaste burning his tongue with every concession he made about his mother's involvement in the vanquishing of the Dark Lord. He didn't stay to hear the sentence being passed; all their English properties being repossessed, save for Malfoy Manor, on account of it being an ancestral home, and three-fourths of the non-cursed content of the Malfoy family Gringotts vault being devolved to the war reparations effort. Draco imagined he heard it from Granger before the papers. They were free but stripped of everything he'd known most of his life. Their name was less than worthless and the considerable amount of gold they still had was no good in the United Kingdom, not then, not after the re-education programme, not after the community service hours.
“I can assure you Healer Malfoy is more than capable.” Dana caught the tail end of the conversation as she walked back in.
When he made his way back inside to the bar there was no trace of Potter or Granger anywhere. He ordered half a glass of champagne and toasted to the good luck of this endeavour; he would drink the other half of this drink once the job was done. It was like a promise, something Bill Weasley had taught him when they crossed paths in Egypt for the first time. The team adopted it and Draco felt for the first time terribly alone toasting on his own at a hotel bar in Calcutta about to embark on a mission with people who could barely look him in the eye.
Draco smiled at Pansy pulling “Healer’s orders” on him and dropped the note on the floor, sinking lower into the water. They were worried for him, enough to get Daphne involved, he almost expected his mother to jump in any moment now, Soup was definitely in league with them. He rubbed absently at his chest, feeling a familiar ache bloom behind his sternum. They loved him and he was making it exceedingly hard for them to care for him. He should have some things figured out by now, like how to properly deal with his job situation. Or how to get his personal life on track, he wasn’t getting any younger, at his age his mother was happily married, having had him already.
“Breakfast is protein heavy, I felt it would be appropriate.” Soup greeted him, floating a mug of coffee to him as soon as he walked in the kitchen.
Draco’s smile widened minutely. “You gave me a pretty good idea of it, actually,” he replied, trailing his fingers up Harry’s arm.
Draco ended up reducing the field of stasis when he started working on the last lobe so it wouldn't affect the girl as much, and sent Griffith off to eat. He had his own lunch at around five in the afternoon, leaving Griffith to take care of minor Transfiguration mishaps. The broken bones, disfigurations and accidental poisonings forced Draco to tap into the limited number of base potions he brought along. He couldn't avoid giving a dose of Calming Draught to the woman who got her leg crushed in a house explosion. The woman who had accidentally Vanished her pelvic bone during childbirth got his one dose of Skele-Gro; the rest of them he could deal with his wand alone. A lot of it was soothing burns and testing for accidental curses and leftover jinxes.
When he opened his eyes again Healer Gupta was standing over him with an inquisitive smile on her face.
When they stood up from the table and parted ways Draco realised that, despite the vegetarian nature of the meal he'd just had, he hadn't missed meat at all. Each dish had been hearty and filling without weighing him down, and the spices had tickled his nose all the way through. He spared a glance towards Potter's retreating back, his head bent to speak quietly with Granger as they made their way towards the bar with Healer Gupta. The rest of the British delegation hung back with Yuvarani in the foyer but Draco decided to lift the imposition of his presence on the group and headed out towards the hotel gardens, determined to finally explore his surroundings and decide how his precious little free time was going to be employed. He had to admit the luxury suites were a pleasant change from his usual accommodations, but after speaking with Healer Gupta about the state of the communities they were supposed to support, Draco doubted he would have many chances to enjoy the many amenities the hotel had to offer, or be a tourist in Calcutta for that matter.
Potter sat down on the floor and Summoned a bottle of water to drink. "We're starting with the library."
Draco was lucky to have half of that steel inside of him. He wouldn’t have been able to endure the years after the war otherwise.
Harry and Draco took a slow tour of the house, it was cleaner than Harry ever remembered it being, even after renovations it had never looked so welcoming and warm. Everywhere it was buzzing with Harry’s own magic, making him feel more settled in his own body than he’d felt in months.
Despite the warm, sweet vindictive pleasure of seeing Potter cut down irritating British Healers, Draco's mood was ruined for the day. That little episode made it clear to him that for this operation to work he needed to not be the one in charge, which left only one viable option really. He needed Griffith to take the lead of the medical team. As green and under-trained as the guy was, he was the only one Draco could trust to come to him should he get in over his head, which Draco told him to do in no uncertain terms at lunch when he informed him of his decision. Griffith turned a pleasant shade of sage green as panic settled in when he realised Draco was dead serious about him leading operations.
“And yet here I am.” Malfoy echoed him, holding his gaze, waiting for Harry to point out some more obviousness.
“Good morning, Potter, how are we feeling this fine morning?” He asked, the smooth drawl spilling from his lips in what Harry could almost call an amicable tone.
"You're not making it very easy on me," Harry commented. Finally, Malfoy took his eyes off the view and looked at him with an amused glint in his eyes and the tiniest hint of a smile. He’d cut his hair since the last time Harry’d seen him. It was again short at the back, a utilitarian cut that didn’t sacrifice the length on top that made Harry wonder whether it was as soft as it looked.
Trust him to just casually cut through Draco’s privacy charms. Looked like their discussion was tabled for now.
“It’s a fairly recent technique, or well, recently rediscovered, it was developed by a research group studying Celtic and aboriginal body painting traditions.”
He pulled back when Harry turned his head, burying his face in the pillow. “A-ah, Harry, eyes on me,” Draco told him, running a hand down his stomach, smiling with twisted delight at the needy whine coming from Harry’s lips. “As long as your eyes are on me, I will keep sucking your cock.”
“Any chance I can speak to your partner about it?” He asked Potter, doing things informally would avoid him the headache of making a formal request to the ministry and the bureaucracy that came with it.
“He’s stable, but his bond is strengthening, and I suspect whatever’s on the other side is interfering with the treatment,” Malfoy replied with a sigh, looking down at Harry’s sleeping form.
“Let’s get you into bed,” Draco murmured, pulling back a little to manoeuvre behind Harry’s back to open the door and stumble inside. “Where there are pillows, and no hardwood for you to crack your head open on,” he added, kicking the door closed behind them.
He woke up from a nap one day to find Malfoy perched on the chair with two tomes balanced on his lap and a parchment floating in front of him, a quill lazily taking notes as he dictated in a low voice, he had another quill behind his ear and kept flipping his hair back whenever it fell over his shoulder. Harry kept quiet, watching him work, completely absorbed in the material. He was transfixed with the precise movement of his long fingers, trailing slowly down the page, gently tapping when he found something interesting and he cross-referenced with the other tome, the small furrow of his eyebrows as he concentrated, the thin line of his lips when he stopped dictating to the quill.
and tell me there isn't something magical about it. Pansy's crush might be based on real life events, sue me.
“I’m not sure, Potter’s description of potion ingredients leaves something to be desired, it could be a stimulant of some kind but...” he tightened his lips and looked up at Harry, “the last dream you had, you mentioned a greenhouse and plants looking like snakes?” he asked.
Harry nodded and took Draco’s hand. He breathed in deeply before taking a resolute step through the wards. He held his breath for a moment, every muscle tense as he waited for the pain of wild magic to hit him, but nothing happened for several long seconds. When he opened his eyes, Grimmauld Place was standing straight in front of them, the spring sun shining over it. It looked better than it ever had, almost glowing from the inside.
Malfoy hummed. “That’s what slashed him open and burned him down,” he concluded with a nod, he’d seen the aftermath of it.
“I would love to, but I can’t.” Malfoy replied, and he looked like he truly regretted not being able to stay. “I was looking for Healer Dana, I hoped to find her here.” He finally, finally looked up at Harry, the question clear in the tilt of his head.
As he ran a hand down his chest, feeling the light silk under his palm, he didn't regret letting Potter take the wheel and bring him to buy a sherwani. It fit him perfectly, and the pale blue-grey complimented him, bringing out his eyes. At some point in the last decade, Potter had acquired some taste, apparently. He did up the buttons in the front, appreciating the way it closed up to his neck. He fixed a pocket square and brushed his finger along the delicate stitching of the embroidered trees in deep blue over his left shoulder.
“Do you really think he was delighted when I informed I’d be his healer?” Draco shot back. It wasn’t that hard to say no to Potter, people just didn’t want to, which in turn gave the man leeway to do whatever he well damn pleased.
As soon as Potter stalked off, Draco slumped down until he was sitting on the ground. He could still feel the magic crackling in the air where he stood just a moment earlier, leveraging all the accusations that Draco thought were secluded only in his head. He allowed himself a moment to breathe and stop the trembling in his hands before pushing himself up and running his fingers through his hair. He walked back to the field hospital and waved away Griffith's questions. Avoiding Miss Rana's enquiring gaze was a lot easier when he got to work but he couldn't ignore it forever when she was right at his shoulder, translating his words to patient after patient.
“And until it’s gone you can’t fix this.” Harry concluded, pointing at his chest, hoping Malfoy would say there was some creative way to work around it. He just nodded. Harry sighed “Alright, lay it on me, why’s it still there?”
“Fine. You can play spy until I find a way to account for the new information,” Malfoy conceded, making Harry smile in triumph.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to intrude, I didn’t know you had visitors.” He apologized to Harry, still not letting go of Teddy, who didn’t seem to mind at all.
But it was never enough. He also had the highest number of summons in front of the disciplinary board. Probably in the history of the hospital.
“Shut up, don’t look so smug about it,” Draco chuckled, sliding the belt out of his trousers, and kicking off his shoes.
“I’m not sure I’ll go back to active duty. I’m struggling to cast, and I don’t feel 100% even physically, I still have tremors every once in a while,” Harry started, looking down at his hands. “And watching Ron at work so closely made me realize I’m not that good at detective work either, I jump to conclusions too fast and I’m unwilling to let a theory go.”
Harry didn’t have much time to get bored once Malfoy left, almost immediately nurse Hanson came in to check on him.
“I would know if you did, I would have had to release the statement.” Seamus countered “come on, stop being dramatic and play with me, I’ll have to speak with your healer about your ridiculous history on the field in a while.” He mentioned
There was always someone in his room and Hermione made sure to stay until dinner. Healer Dana and she made quite the pair discussing his treatment and each new development while Malfoy quietly fumed in a corner, jotting down notes as if they’d personally offended his mother. If one ignored the constant monitoring and experimentation, Harry wasn't doing so bad; a little bored maybe, sometimes the potions they tested him with had unpredictable reactions, but they were more on the fun, whimsical end of the scale rather than the gruesome, painful one.
“I’ll have you know what distinguishes a proper gentleman is dedication to perfecting a craft,” he purred, jostling Harry a little as he blindly kicked off his boots.
"Not even a little bit," he replied just as jovially. At least, save for Professor Chambers, the entire old team was present, which meant at least four people he didn't have to worry about. Three and a half. He wasn't that sure about Griffith.
He looked away and took an unusual interest in the potted plants on either side of the door to the restaurant until they finished their small talk. He could bite his tongue for a while, at least in public.
Malfoy nodded, clearly pleased, an almost proud light in his eyes and the hint of a smile curling his lips that made Harry feel accomplished.
Harry grimaced at the thought of the last time he and Soup met. “I should. So, you decided to take the job in France?” He asked.
There is very practical talk of Scorpius' guardianship after Draco's death between Draco, Astoria and Pansy
“Does the ministry not have a protocol for risk management?” Draco asked, leaning back in his chair looking at the impressive list they’d written out.
It was still early when he got back in. There were people hanging out at the bar, and late diners still filled the restaurants. Hermione was sharing a drink with Professor Chambers in the lounge and she waved him over as soon as she spotted him.
He saw himself in every small brown face, the same unfairness, the same power that burned and killed everyone around him, a power he never asked for and that nobody explained to him.
“So what you’re saying is I was right from the very beginning?” Potter asked, not even trying not to be too smug about it
Harry tapped his fingers on the couch cushion thinking about it. This was probably the first real conversation he had with Zabini and it was going distinctly not how he could have ever imagined it. But there was something exhilarating about being able to speak freely about these things with someone who really got it.
Draco’s smile softened. “I don’t plan on there being a next time. You planning on getting into mortal danger again very soon?” he asked, still holding onto Harry’s hand.
Malfoy nodded. "As ill-advised as that is. We're going into an unstable, recently collapsed, and probably cursed cave system."
“Yeah, thanks” Potter replied, looking up at him with a small smile before looking back down at his arm. “What now?” He asked, with an eagerness he did not expect from a man who’d been subjected to twenty-six different diagnostics in the span of one day, some less pleasant than others.
“Ok…” Harry replied just as easily. He was starting to learn this dance with Malfoy, about him setting up clear boundaries. Malfoy would say no, Harry would take a step back and then Malfoy would take a step closer. This time though Harry didn’t have the patience to wait “Why?” he asked softly, he knew he couldn’t push Malfoy on it, but he’d never denied Harry explanations, and Harry needed one of those now.
“Suck it Malfoy!” Ron grinned after calling out his move. “You’re going to pay for my next date with my wife,” he declared as the pieces on the board cheered for their glorious victory.
Soup was a gift from Merlin, steaming coffee waiting on the table when he walked in. The elf assessed him with his big dark eyes for a long moment “Did Master Malfoy get a good night sleep?” He asked eventually, his eyes searching his face.
"I suppose I should take you not running for the hills as a win." Granger sat down at the table and fixed the skirt around her legs.
"What is this?" Harry asked, when Draco invited him inside. Everything was polished and new, but the architecture was old, the geometric decoration of the floors, the shape of the windows, it was a perfectly restored house, and it was massive, bigger than Grimmauld Place. The figures in the mosaics waved at them and there were statues in every nook along the wall, delicate and detailed enough that Harry expected them to breathe and start moving at any moment.
The case seemed to have come to a standstill recently, every lead he managed to unearth through dreams or very careful, very discreet digging through the bond seemed to fall through after a while, which would normally frustrate Harry to the point of breaking something, but, but, but!
“Good,” he purred, a pleased smile tugging at his lips. “Was it so hard?” he asked, running his fingers through dark hair.
Harry shrugged, smiling back a little. “You got something for me?” he asked, nodding at the vials on the bedside table.
Harry left Hermione's suite and knew immediately that if he went back to his own room, he would just stew and then bite someone's head off at dinner, which would satisfy him for a moment but compromise the rest of the mission. He sighed and softly thumped his head against the door to his room before pushing back and heading down the corridor towards the elevators.
"I know, 'Mione, if anything bad happens you'll know through the coins, otherwise, wait for our letter," Harry reassured her with a smile. "I'll see you in a couple of weeks."
"You took me to a temple for dinner?" Malfoy asked, his eyes flicking between Harry's face and the temple door.
“Far be it from me to doubt your medical expertise on the matter but it could be a million of other things, Potter, that’s what we’re here to find out today.” Malfoy pointed out.
He didn't get an acknowledgement back but he had bigger things to worry about than Potter's pissy mood.
“Could you get me a book? Any book, or just paper and a pencil, just anything to do,” Potter asked, just a hint of true desperation in his voice, and Draco had to admit in the privacy of his own mind that hearing that edge in Potter did something for him. It awakened something dark and predatory and wholly inappropriate towards a patient under his care.
"I appreciate you defending my honour, Potter, but it's in the interest of the mission to prevent internal conflict," Draco pointed out, taking off his sunglasses. He slid them in the breast pocket of his linen shirt and sat down on the small bench, looking up at Potter.
"You weren't even done with training at the time. It's not your responsibility to vanquish every single evil in the world," Malfoy replied sounding annoyingly reasonable. Harry wanted to argue that maybe not every evil but this specific one was his responsibility to vanquish, but Malfoy was already asking about the night and any change after the last rounds of tests.
Remember to comment if you're having a good time. Or if you're having a bad time and like it that way, we don't judge.
“It’s supposed to track magic flow, but you’re too bafflingly powerful and your core, as partially depleted as it is, still makes it cluster, so I can’t get a read.” Draco replied, ignoring the hair that had slipped out of the knot at the back of his head as he went to check on the blood, which was of course inert.
I had to lull you into a false sense of security with the last chapter so I could hit you with this.
"I don't think I have anything to wear with this colour," Harry commented. "I will have to go shopping."
When he did manage to doze off he found himself in a softly lit room with a mess of papers in front of him. He knew what they said, he’d gone over them multiple times but each time he made a new note in the margin in a neat loopy handwriting. There were potion ingredients, names, places all tightly organized in spreadsheets arranged in front of him and a sense of not having enough time that pushed him to work so everything was ready before the morning. There were people depending on him finishing his work on time and a sense of impending doom hanging over everything that made focusing on the work that much harder.
Harry’s arm wrapped around his thin waist, grabbing at the soft linen of his shirt. He was never going to let him go, he was drunk with the feeling of Draco bending himself to fit perfectly around Harry, the gentle tug of Draco’s fingers in his hair, the planes of his torso under Harry’s hand, the roundness of his shoulders… And his lips… They were as sweet as lassi, and Harry could drink greedily to his heart’s content.
"In the end, I had to wait until my third mission to start doing any real medical work, but that's the nature of emergency healing, isn't it?" He smiled at Healer Gupta's amused nod.
After some deliberation he decided to take out most of his childhood, the worst parts, and his sex life with Ginny, it seemed like something best kept to himself. He considered taking out some of the war, the torture, the death. But he realized it would be pointless. All of that was already in Malfoy’s head too.
"I thought you worked for Gringotts," Draco commented, still baffled by the warm greeting the man reserved for him.
"If he had to pick a Weasley he could at least have gone for the elder one, she gets her brain from her mother."
There were no more words exchanged between them until they finished eating and left the temple. There was nothing Malfoy could offer and Harry was satisfied he was starting to understand. When they gave back the scarves and slipped their shoes back on, Harry knew that something had passed between them, that the effort of making himself seen by Malfoy was paying off. In the end, Hermione might have been right again, it looked like there was something salvageable in the man, after all.
“So, have you figured out where you’re going to be staying until Grimmauld gets sorted out?” Draco asked, propping his feet up on Harry’s bed as they shared lunch.
“Has this happened before?” He asked as he flipped the chart to check that they didn’t change the ingredients of his painkillers, but no, they were the same Murphy used and the dosage was the same. Potter could have started developing a sensitivity to it, given the frequency of his visits to st Mungo’s.
“Salazar help me, I really do,” Draco sighed, taking a small sip of his tea, the warmth of it seeping into his hands as he cradled the cup.
“A-ah, don’t get sidetracked. You have classes to hold,” Draco reminded him, heading to the closet to get dressed.
Draco turned around, almost spilling his half-drunk flute of champagne at the sound of Potter's voice.
"She's getting good, have you seen my nails?" Ron asked, poking his head out the bar window, wiggling a set of sparkly lime-coloured nails at Harry. Suddenly, matte purple didn't seem so outrageous.
“You want to come with, Soup?” Harry asked over tea, “You probably have more experience with magical houses than any of us, that one specifically,” he pointed out.
His throat closed up with a suppressed need to yell at the unfairness of it all. It was injustice that screamed vengeance in the face of God; there were families, generations of people whose footprint on the earth was being inexorably wiped away by England's greed and indifference.
"You're not going to make me eat street fish, are you?" Malfoy asked, eyeing the carts suspiciously.
“Healer Malfoy is just a delight and so am I,” she replied, “Has no one ever been nice to you?” She joked. Harry just shrugged, unsure how to answer that, plenty of people had been nice to him but there was always a layer of performance to it. He let her work in silence.
“I should talk to the department head about it,” Harry considered. “It’s not a bad idea,” he hummed, a slow smile coming to his lips as he thought about it.
Now the update on my life you did not ask for: I am starting my thesis. As you can imagine that is going to considerably limit my free time so for the foreseeable future I'm NOT going back to posting weekly. That said I'm not abandoning this fic.
“Good evening, Soup, how are you doing?” Blaise asked, the warm lilting tones of his voice instantly relaxing Draco as he listened to the exchange. They’d done this dance before. Blaise had his back and as long as he was there he was safe.
“You can keep the vest and the shirt, but you need different trousers.” Pansy decided, heading straight to his bedroom to find suitable clothes for him.
Harry raised his hands in a placating manner and smiled. "Seriously, though, I want to show you a place and you've barely been anywhere that isn't the hotel and the village."
"No, at least, I don't think so. She's launching this ambitious project to start amending colonial damage. She’s going to West Bengal and she wants me on the security detail."
Draco had learned very quickly he’d have to walk on the straight and narrow, be absolutely impeccable or be cut down. Just getting into the training programme had been a struggle, he’d been five years too old after serving his sentence and his face was too well known to just glamor the dark mark and pretend to be something he wasn’t.
"I don't know if you have them in the west, but here we keep in contact through this ancient practice called writing letters," she mentioned. "You might want to try; I'm sure Healer Gupta would be happy to teach you this practice as well."
Draco stepped out of the shower to find Harry still fidgeting with his clothes. He'd changed at least three times, judging by the array of clothes strewn over the bed.
Draco frowned, unsure where this questioning was going. "Not really, no, I can schedule it more or less whenever in the next two weeks."
“Nonetheless the committee cannot ignore the fact that you used unsanctioned procedures on a patient. That is not something we take lightly.” Draco nodded, fully aware of the cost of his actions. “It compromises the safety of our patient and we cannot abide that.”
for listening to me ramble about it endlessly and just being a general champ about this whole thing.
"Are you really that surprised that a suburban English family was eager to pretend their mixed-raced ward didn’t exist?" Harry asked, with a touch of disbelieving amusement in his voice.
Harry could hear the steel in his voice, hard and cold, covering the vulnerability he’d just witnessed. Why had Malfoy let him see that?
As much as Harry hated to hear it, something deep inside him knew that Ron might be right; that fourteen years had to count for something and that he now owed the man his life, two times over,  but Malfoy was still an annoying prat, that was something Harry could hang on to.
Draco slowly pulled out, when Harry weakly pushed at his hip. The sight of cum slowly oozing out of Harry’s puffy used hole was enough to make Draco’s cock give a valiant twitch of interest, but alas he wasn’t twenty anymore, it would take some time to recover.
“Tell me what you want, Harry,” he whispered, one of his hands working its way under Harry’s shirt, making him gasp when his cold fingers touched the warm skin of his stomach. “I will give you everything you ask for, and more,” he promised.
“I’m perfectly capable of running the last tests by myself, mr Bingley, your presence is required elsewhere.” Malfoy reminded him coldly. “I doubt Healer Andrews will accept your need to fawn over Auror Potter as sufficient cause to miss his seminars.” He added, gesturing to the door and stepping aside, a clear invitation to leave, in case his gritted teeth and the waves of displeasure he was emitting weren’t evident enough.
Draco felt his cheek heat up and he tried pointlessly to hide it behind the flute of champagne, draining the last of it. "He said that, hasn't he? Well, it might be stretching the truth a bit, but I suppose I could in a pinch. It's not my expertise."
"I wasn't sure what you wanted," Potter mentioned, lifting the cloche to reveal a varied array of foods. There were hash browns, bangers and a cup of steaming earl grey, along with toast, some odd-looking pancakes and fragrant coffee with several small containers of chutney. It wasn't hard to figure out how the tray split down the middle. Clearly, Potter had paid at least a little bit of attention last time they shared meals, enough to pick the parts of an English breakfast Draco favoured.
Eventually the fire extinguished and Malfoy let go of him, leaving Harry with the ghost of his touch lighting up his skin. He watched Malfoy sit down gingerly, still holding onto his wand with an unsteady hand.
“Yes,” Draco sighed, rubbing a hand down his face, “No?” He shrugged, “I don’t know, Blaise, I just knew I couldn’t allow him to die pointlessly, so I saved him. Of all the things I should be punished for is that really the one that gets to me? How does that make any sense?” He asked, the ember of anger reigniting for a moment.
“Your mother’s favourite flowers. They’re daffodils, aren’t they?” Harry elaborated. Malfoy smiled and shook his head.
“You’re no bother, Draco.” Andromeda replied with a smile “Would you like to join us for tea?” She offered. Malfoy declined politely as Teddy pulled back a little from where he was nestled in the dark folds of Malfoy’s robes.
Hermione insisted on accompanying them to the embassy and as they prepared to step through the fire, she recommended one more time to be careful and to keep in touch.
"It's not about England, you won't have to put a foot in the UK if you don't want to, but I know of your training and I need your kind of expertise." She took a sip, letting the cool water refresh her and the zing of lemon chase away the sluggish feeling that accompanied a long journey.
“I’ll leave instructions for the night shift about your pain management regime, if you get uncomfortable just ask to up your dosage.” Malfoy picked up the chart and jotted down the appropriate annotations about the procedure, he had Healer Dana sign off as well and put it back in place and then finally looked Harry in the face.
“I was just ensuring the patient’s comfortable.” The trainee -Bingley- replied, straightening up and hovering next to the bed. How was he unaffected by the clear displeasure written all over Malfoy’s body? Did the man have a death wish? Or maybe he was just completely tone deaf.
Draco nodded, knowing Potter’s penchant for disarming people it would make a lot of sense. If he’d had a run in with the person that cursed him there could be a divided loyalty in the wand and his body may have a hard time recognizing the residue as extraneous.
It didn't take long at all for things to go south. Draco got one good dinner because he pointedly ignored the existence of the majority of the new members of the British delegation. He got one good night, sharing half a glass of champagne with Potter, where he told him about Hawaii, and listened in turn to him detail the celebration of Parkash Utsav Dasveh Patshah he got to attend back in London with the Patils right before they left, and then all Draco's good mood and goodwill evaporated suddenly under the harsh light of day.
Harry still wasn't sure what in the world possessed him to sit Malfoy down and bare himself in front of him. Maybe Hermione was getting to him with the idea that he might be worth the effort, maybe the ferret
They were set up in an absurdly luxurious hotel smack in the middle of the business district. Hermione scored the diplomatic suite but if his room was anything to go by, they were all in luxury rooms. Somehow it didn't feel right. Neither did the marble under his feet as he walked through the foyer to get out of the perfectly weather-controlled air of the hotel and into the sticky warm air of the afternoon in the city. The sounds and smells of the city assaulted him all at once and pushed every other thought aside for a moment. It felt like being in Delhi for the first time: the giddiness of being back in his family's home country; the thrum of a different kind of magic in the air; the colours everywhere, vibrant under the warm light of the sun starting to lower towards the horizon. He picked a direction and walked, wide-eyed and hungry to get his fill of images, of women in colourful sarees, of men in kurtas, of rough streets under his feet, of white buildings shining under the yellow sun. He filled his lungs with the smell of spices and flowers the deeper he went into the city. Even the smog seemed sweeter somehow, and the sound of car horns less discordant.
"I wouldn't expect you to. What about Healer Gupta? I hear she's an expert in her field." Draco had been relieved to hear he would have an expert in Ayurveda at his side while leading the local team of Healers. He was many things, an exceptional emergency surgeon for sure, but knowledgeable in Ayurvedic healing wasn't one of those things.
Harry wasted no time before flopping over, away from the wet spot, and grin up at Draco, the complete picture of satisfaction and indulgence. Draco smiled down at him and finally got rid of his clothes, damp with sweat and other bodily fluids. Once he was just as naked as Harry he reached for his wand, but Harry’s hand closed around his wrist.
Harry made a vague gesture towards him and smiled when he felt the flow of magic through his fingers curling in the shape of a Cleaning Charm around Draco’s hands.
This came out a little longer than expected but I needed to get that last scene in. Enjoy. We're finally getting into some actual plot. My new favourite character gets introduced, there are some feelings getting discussed.
“I’m sorry, mate, I don’t have any details. I got to deal with the press and since you’re out of commission I’m on desk duty and support.” Seamus told him, flopping down on the chair, smiling apologetically at Harry as he groaned in frustration “Besides, you should be resting, if I’m benched so are you.” He added, setting up the chessboard for a new game.
"You have six years of experience on me," he pointed out, as if that meant anything in the face of Draco's name when it came to dealing with British wixen.
"A winning decision, I'm sure. Looks like the British influence is still strong, judging by the unfortunate governmental choices," he muttered, glancing out the window to allow himself a moment of bitterness about the management of his country while he was growing up. He sighed and turned back to look at his companion.
“She married Blaise, she’s practically my sister,” Malfoy replied. “Besides she was in our year and my house, Potter, it’s a bit hard not to get to know each other when you live together for seven years,” he pointed out.
The worst is over, how does it feel to have everything in the open and Harry headed back to the hospital?
"During the British reign over India the tracking of lower-caste magical children was disrupted and the installation of colonial education left a lot of untrained magical practitioners that end up harming themselves or others in bursts of accidental magic."
Harry nodded, she was on the right track, they couldn't just come in and teach English practices, wiping out the tattered remnant of the local style of magic use.
“You see something you like?” Harry asked, crossing his arms behind his head with a grin as if he didn’t know exactly how good he looked, dark against Draco’s cerulean sheets, looking like a goddamn renaissance painting.
“Of course I am, are you kidding? I just want to make her sweat for a bit, make sure they don’t take me for granted.” He chuckled.
He washed his face, the water lending warmth to his skin for a fleeting moment. He moved with practiced precision as he shaved. Each kiss of the blade left his jaw smooth in its wake. when he moved down to shave under his chin he slowed down his breath. A familiar stillness filled him, all his focus narrowing into measured movements in a perfect economy of power as he leaned into the ritual to find a center. He washed off the excess soap and ran a finger along his jaw appreciating the smoothness left behind by the goblin steel before picking up his brush to take care of his hair.
Draco grimaced, knowing Weasley’s concerns were founded, but he still couldn’t let it happen. “He’s not ready yet and he’s my patient, he’s at a delicate stage right now and I can’t interrupt the treatment.”
"People don't usually have very friendly reasons to try and get a hold of me, not people from my home country at the very least," he mentioned, holding open the flap of a tent for her to walk in.
Andrews didn’t seem fazed by Draco’s display, if not for the subtle way his eyes didn’t seem able to linger on his robes, flicking back to the papers in front of him or to Blaise. Draco felt a little of his nervous energy drain away, as though his unease transferred out to the spectators. The right clothes did hold power after all.
"Trevor is in Hawaii, dealing with the fallout of a dragon-induced volcanic explosion, I'm going to catch up with him there, and then wherever the next disaster strikes. You know how I operate these days."
"I nearly got sorted in Slytherin, you know?" he mentioned as they walked close enough for their elbows to nearly brush against each other.
We got to finally see Draco's highly anticipated tattoo (I know some of you were waiting for it) what do we think? good? bad? are you curious about the other one he's most definitely still hiding? What's up with Harry not speaking Latin?
"I have protection against Dark Magic, Potter!" Malfoy got up and dusted himself off, and as Harry looked at him noticed a shimmer around him that couldn't be attributed to the light glinting off his hair; it was distinctly magical in nature. "And a Protection Charm would have sufficed, no need to blast off half the room."
Harry spent a week being poked and prodded and watching Malfoy get more and more aggravated by the unusual power of his magical core and the inconsistent response of his body to treatment, which was highly entertaining when it wasn’t deeply worrying. Having Malfoy’s attention on him all day long was nice though, brought him back to his school days when his only worry was surviving
"Come in," he called, pushing himself up and Summoning a robe, quickly tying it around his waist as Potter walked in with a covered tray.
“They’re using cobra lily, it’s poisonous as well as illegal; more accurately venomous, since they’re classified as beasts instead of plants.” Malfoy tapped his notepad, frowning in concentration. “How’s your hand, Potter?” Malfoy asked after a moment.
“Ok, let’s put this man back together.” She nodded, determination filling her voice as she turned around.
“Malfoy? no, it was something with a D, Dennis, Dawn, Dana. It was Dana.” Seamus said “Malfoy’s your healer?” he asked, his lips twitching, trying not to show how absurdly funny the idea was.
The process of regrowing lungs was slow and fiddly, and as he made his way through the first lobe he spoke calmly with Griffith, explaining what he was doing to compensate for the lack of potions.
Harry hesitated under his expectant gaze. A new warmth was burning low in his stomach, not entirely unwelcome, at the thought of how intense Malfoy's scrutiny could be, and what stupid decisions those eyes could push him into. He turned his back before pulling off his shirt, the illusion of privacy immediately dispelled as he turned back around, bare under Malfoy's examination.
“It’s not your handwriting,” Harry noticed, studying the letters once more, they weren’t nearly as slanted as Malfoy’s handwriting, but they had the same sharp angles and tight loops.
“Thank you, Teddy, I have been a little bored here,” He admitted “and I missed you when I didn’t make it for tea, I’m sorry about that.” He apologized. He never skipped his weekly tea at Andromeda’s if he could help it, especially now that Teddy was away most of the year at Hogwarts. He only got to see him during holydays and the summer, but now Teddy had endless stories about classes and out of class shenanigans to fill the days. He was growing fast and in a safe, peaceful world like his parents wished for him.
Draco was glad to step into the perfectly weather-controlled environment of the hotel. With no disrespect to the embassy's effort to make its rooms liveable, there were too many open windows and stone arches for any Weather-Control Charm to have any significant effect. Draco wasn't made for the humidity; he could already feel his shirt sticking to his back with sweat. Not even months in the rainforest made him get used to it, he much preferred the desert.
Thirty minutes made a world of difference. The hotel was already buzzing with activity as he slipped in through a side entrance and headed straight to the elevator. Businessmen in suits hurried through the lobby, a conference on the effects of monsoons on potion brewing was setting up the welcome desk in a corner, and the delicious smell of food wafted out of the restaurants. He nabbed a lift and got up to their floor with just enough time to shower and change before breakfast. As soon as the lift doors opened Potter's face greeted him from the corridor.
“I’m ambidextrous.” Malfoy corrected him “Any other questions about my style choices?” He asked, crossing his arms and looking at Harry waiting for him to say something else about how wrong he was going through life.
"There is no reason to worry, Draco ji, it's my job to make you and the medical team as comfortable as possible. I'm happy to work on Ambassador Granger's mission," she reassured him, and the glint in her dark eyes showed genuine enthusiasm.
“It’s your house now,” Draco smiled, awed at the change. “It’s still got a me-shaped hole in the wards,” he chuckled, sifting through the layers.
Draco shook his head. "I should be thanking you, Granger, for bringing me along. Trust me when I say I got more than I gave."
Malfoy nodded and then his eyes settled on Harry. "Potter, were you looking for me or is this a lucky coincidence?" he asked with a casual tone that set Harry's blood boiling.
“It was during the war” Potter said softly, his hand twisting into the sheet “Not many know about it, but I had a connection, a…” He gestured vaguely to his head unsure how to word it “Some kind of soul bond to Voldemort.” He struggled to get the words out as Draco listened quietly and intently “I got these headaches and visions of what was going on around him, feel his emotions when they were particularly heightened, things like that.” He described the feeling as best he could.
“Thank you” he managed, relief flooding him. Malfoy was willing to let it go and pretend it never happened. He still felt like he had to explain himself though. “I know it must be weird for you… well… I… but it’s not…” Malfoy’s questioning head tilt made Harry forget where he was going with it. “It’s, you know, you’re straight and… ”
Granger cornered him one morning at the end of May and told him in no uncertain terms that he was taking a day off and he was going to spend it at the spa surrounded by crystals so he could recharge his magic.
Harry watched him roll up his sleeves up to his elbows, his eyes falling to the faded curves of the dark mark peeking out from under the leather straps of a wand holster. He looked up at Malfoy’s face, looking right back at him.
The way the light from the window caught on the stray locks of Malfoy’s hair was much more interesting anyway. The arch of his wrist as he traced slow spirals with his wand, gradually healing the slash was more fascinating than anything that could be happening to his torso, so was the way Malfoy’s teeth closed around his wand when he slipped it in his mouth to have both hands free. That was a horrible habit to have, there were holsters for that. It was so completely out of character that Harry started wondering what other absurdly improper quirks were hiding behind Malfoy’s perfectly polished exterior. What could he find prying apart the cracks in Malfoy’s mask? But it was such a pretty mask… Maybe Harry didn’t want to break it per se, maybe just have a peek at what was behind it.
“Anything else you need?” He asked, helping Harry get the far corner of his sheet after he struggled to reach over his left shoulder to cover himself.
“It’s not necessarily bad either. You’re just not bouncing back as quick as I expected, but it’s not like I have an abundance of cases for comparison. You are for all intents and purposes a category of your own,” Draco explained, halfway between frustrated and amused. He lived for research into new phenomena but why did it have to be Potter? “If things don’t change by the end of the day we’ll start looking into what’s causing it.”
Six months apart hadn't prepared him to see Potter again in the least. His hair was longer, and he wasn't clean-shaven anymore, undoubtedly pushing department regulation with the beard he was growing, but it suited him, enhancing his strong jaw instead of making it disappear. He looked refined in the red gala uniform, the gold buttons and the collar patches glinting in the light of the candles. He stood… well, not exactly tall between Weasley and Granger, but straight. He filled his frame instead of trying to disappear by hunching his shoulders and curving his spine, and Draco couldn't help but think he looked like he'd found his place.
Draco’s hand settled, cool and strong, on Harry’s neck, his thumb rushing against the angle of his jaw, scraping against the beard. “I was always listening.”
“It’s the first two elements of my vow of non-maleficence,” he replied, “it’s very similar to the one muggle physicians take, I’m told; except in my case, much more binding. The first part means ‘do no harm’ the second says ‘care for’. There is a third part that calls for healing.”
After the first day, Draco joined the reconstruction team, working on securing the structural integrity of the mountainside, fixing the houses that were damaged in the latest accident, but soon enough he was directed to the restoration experts to recover the content of old manuscripts and from there shuffled to the education team where he finally settled. He checked in on Griffith once every day, on the hike to or from the community but, as predicted, he had things handled and Draco could relax and teach kids the grounding techniques he'd learnt from Healer Gupta, or sit and learn from the tiny ancient woman Granger had managed to get on board to revive Maharathi magical practises, buried under the sprawling prescriptive English conformism. He got a lot of henna stains on his clothes and fingers as he watched teenagers reapply the ritual designs on their arms as they faded.
“Yeah, we’ve been putting him through the wringer with all the tests we ran on him,” Malfoy agreed. “You finished the investigation?” he asked looking up at Ron.
"Harry asked me for leave to go to Amritsar to celebrate Vaisakhi. You're going with him. You leave next week and you'll make a stop for me to check on the Jawhar community. We've lost contact with the local activists working there and I want to know what's going on. You have three weeks; it should give you more than enough time to do everything."
Blaise hummed, letting the silence stretch between them for a long moment, giving Draco time to settle the dissonance between what he was feeling and the facts that Blaise had him speak out loud.
“Let’s try again, and be careful when I shut you out, I’ll do it slower this time,” Malfoy recommended, his face relaxed and patient, not an ounce of the frustration harry was expecting showed in the gentle curl of his lips.
"Don't do anything stupid. If there is something wrong in Jawhar send a message back, I'm going to say the same to Harry but I think you are the one who might actually listen."
“Sorry, people are usually asleep when we lift the stasis” Malfoy apologized, carefully applying a salve to his chest. The skin was pink and tender under his fingers, feeling almost fragile, like a barely healed burn. Malfoy’s cool fingers on him felt great, alleviating the tightness and bringing feeling back into the area. He wrapped him up in bandages, smoothing the edges down with a gentle swipe of his hand before addressing him.
Mind the tags and read responsibly, the angst, self loathing and self destructive tendencies are only just starting.
“He may be a bit of all that but he’s not what he used to be,” Ron decreed, the image of Malfoy reaching out to him
There is a vague passing mention of self harm, no one actually hurts themselves (on purpose) but for a hot second someone is worried they did.
They brought him to Sadistique for the first time when all of his choices had been stripped from him. Draco quickly learned that, whatever happened outside, once he crossed those doors he would find people willing to put the power back into his hands with an open trust he wouldn’t find anywhere else, that he could dole out pain and pleasure and care without having his motives questioned, that he could slip on a mask and be his most honest self for a while.
"Ah, training with the professionals, I see. Soon you'll be leaving me in the dust." Malfoy was joking around with his godson and Harry started to think he might be hallucinating this one.
“Have you ever tried saying no to Harry?” Finnigan asked, equal parts amusement and disbelief in his voice.
“Good morning Healer Malfoy. Your favourite patient is awake and fed, the new painkillers seem to agree with him.” She mentioned, giving him the efficiency he’d come to expect and welcome from her.
"Wouldn't you like to know," Draco replied with a small grin. Some things never got old, trying to get on Potter's nerves was, despite everything, still his favourite sport.
Hermione had a one-track mind when she worked, the fact that she was even thinking about massages and flower baths meant something was up, and there was only one way Harry was going to find out what.
As usual I'm a free range beast going through life with no beta so any mistake you catch and release into the comment section will be killed humanely.
For once Harry woke up feeling well rested. He could breathe more freely and even though his chest still felt sore and somewhat fragile he felt better than he’d been since he woke up in st Mungo. It felt like recovery was an actual possibility and the sight of his left arm, lying limply at his side wasn’t quite as jarring. Nurse Hanson brought him a stack of letters along with breakfast, apparently people were starting to write him well wishes for a speedy recovery and she thought he’d enjoy having something to read.
Harry didn’t need him to repeat it. He rolled over and shoved a pillow under his hips, hissing when his cock brushed against the cool silk case.
Draco was catching Harry up to the latest from Teddy’s little celebrity crush on Pansy, when Hermione came by with news the following morning.
“Actually, no.” He looked up at him with a small grin. “I don’t hate to say it at all,” he amended before continuing a little more seriously. “You look like shit and you need to take care of yourself. There’s only so much Soup can do for you. Pansy and I are worried, and so is your mother.”
Draco worked quickly and efficiently, first setting up the tests that needed time to react before moving on to the ones that would give an immediate result. With every precise flick of his wand scratching off another line from his list his frustration grew exponentially, his hands tugging at his hair as time ticked by bringing no new information to light. Of course, it had to be the last thing he checked to turn out positive, because it was just how things went for him lately. At least Potter was being quiet and collaborative, maybe a little too quiet, watching him work with an intensity he rarely saw even from first year trainees.
"It served me well on my second go-around. We went for a brief stint in Afghanistan and I did nothing but cast Protection Charms against stray Muggle explosives. I think I might prefer curses to be honest." At that point, even the British delegates were enraptured by his tales.
He had another long day ahead of him. He just knew they would be under siege by reporters looking to get a piece of Potter and he would get caught into it too. He considered disillusioning himself to get in undisturbed, but he would still need so get past them which would be a hassle. It would give him a good excuse to be a dick to a reporter, he didn’t have many of those these days… Except he couldn’t afford any more bad press than he already got.
“A choice borne of need. What’s your excuse for picking adverse circumstances for yourself, Master Malfoy?” Soup glanced at him, knowing he was stepping into dangerous territory.
Draco looked up at him, trying to parse out if he was just having him on “You were engaged, Potter, how do you not know?” He asked, unable to hide his bewilderment at the whole situation.
Draco raised his hands in surrender. The line of her shoulders relaxed when he acquiesced and a smile touched her lips for a moment.
You know the drill by now, I'm my own beta so if you catch typos you know I'm the only one responsible.
She pointed at a tree stump and Draco flopped down with a sigh. He could have fixed his hands with a quick charm but the pain reminded him to pay attention to what he was doing.
“Why do you keep it covered?” Harry asked, watching him roll the sleeve of his uniform back down covering up, until it closed just under the handle of his wand, locking away any sliver of skin above his wrist. Malfoy didn’t show much skin at all, he never had, Harry realized. Even back in school, his uniform was always buttoned up to the collar and his sleeves down to his wrists, even in his flashier outfits he’d never seen Malfoy unbuttoned, physically or figuratively.
As soon as he stepped through the almost physical border of the Weather-Control Charms and took a couple steps in the foyer, he was spotted by Yuvarani who waved him over.
Malfoy chuckled. “I didn’t, Potter, you did,” he replied with an amused smile. “You didn’t go look for anything in particular and I simply let you be where you landed. You were talking about last night when I got in, so that’s what you went looking for and from Daphne to Astoria the jump was short.”
As promised, the slippery rock behind the waterfall melted away at the touch of Harry's hand, revealing a narrow corridor cut into the mountain and lit by a magical glow. As they ventured deeper, the climb got steeper and the sound of the waterfall, almost deafening when they stepped in, got further and further, muffled enough that their laboured breathing filled the space, drowning it out.
Harry’d been very vocally against Teddy visiting Malfoy Manor back when Andromeda had been reconnecting with Narcissa. The place was too filled with darkness and bad memories, it was no place for a child. Andromeda had given him a little time to sort his feelings out and then put her foot down and that had been it.
“I am,” Draco confirmed with a short nod. “And my perspective looks very promising,” he added, hoping it might motivate her to drop whatever was in that ominous envelope.
They ended up spending the afternoon playing scrabbles with Rose and trying to keep Hugo from eating the tiles. At one point, Hugo decided he wasn’t getting enough attention and decided to grace them with a song that Rose declared resembled a Kneazle’s mating call. Nurse Roberts was delighted enough by the show that gave Hugo a lolly, and it was of course a token of appreciation for his singing, not a device to occupy his mouth otherwise.
Draco moaned softly at the wanton display, the elegant arch of Harry’s back called to him to trace each knob of his spine with his tongue, and Draco wasn’t one to deny himself simple pleasures. He didn’t resist the temptation to kiss one of Harry’s perfect plump buttocks either or to give the other a little nibble. The bottle of lube abandoned and forgotten as Draco got distracted worshipping the perfect shape of Harry’s arse until Harry was positively begging him to get a move on.
"Sometimes a lady doesn't kiss at all." Draco shot back. Pansy didn't dignify that with an answer but teasing her about her very obvious, incredibly unsubtle crush on the opera singer distracted Draco enough to finish his toast and have another piece with his coffee while Pansy polished off her clafoutis, showering Soup with much deserved praise for his cooking.
He went back to the hotel after sharing a simple meal with a sea of strangers, feeling more connected than he'd ever remembered feeling since his first dinner in the Great Hall at Hogwarts.
Try as he might he couldn’t remember a single thing he’d read on those papers as he woke up. Dreams were strange like that. All things considered thought, as far as weird bond dreams went, better this than the lingering images of torture that used to come back every time he closed his eyes, or the feeling of dark magic clinging to him as he woke up clammy covered in cold sweat back during the war.
They were sat in a comfortable booth and Draco let Taranjit order for them. He pulled out an envelope from his pocket and discreetly resized it before setting it on the table. As soon as the steaming tea was brought to them Draco decided it was time to start explaining.
“I spent fourteen hours operating yesterday, and ten more today, with virtually no break because the only other Healer England bothered to send hasn't completed his training and has only the most basic skills in the field we're working in. Ah, by the way, despite being thrust unprepared in the deep end of the pool I haven't heard a single complaint from Griffith. He's doing his best to keep up and learn what he can to be of use."
“More or less, I feel like it’s the same thing just less severe. I might be paranoid, I mean it’s just dreams, but it’s how it started last time. But it can’t be the same thing. Nobody hit me with a killing curse in well over ten years” He told him with a tentative smile.
Harry didn’t waste too much time trying to rationalize away his less than professional feelings for Malfoy. It was an exercise in futility. The man made those obnoxious healer robes look like high fashion and what Harry felt about it was violently un-platonic, Malfoy was self-assured and unyielding in the most attractive way, he’d grown into his features wonderfully and Harry was a hot-blooded bisexual man. He just wished those feelings weren’t quite so public domain. Was he being that obvious?
