“—though it appears you could stand to take a short break. How about I get started inspecting what you’ve just done, then you could join me after.”
, Potter—
Charming chocolate-coloured covers down, Draco crawled with exhausted grace up the bed to stretch out on his front, and Harry followed after, flopping down beside him with a bit more
Draco looked slightly annoyed.
He often wished for the power to wave his wand, and solve it all at once—but Harry knew they had a lot of work yet to do. That they were actually making progress was one silver lining to help get him through his week. Another, that at the end of the week not only would they be making further progress but he’d get to see Draco again as well, and possibly even pay him back for that parting tease of his.
They both summoned their clothes, cast a few cleaning charms, and dressed in relatively peaceful silence.
They were laughing and poking fun, but he was always on the lookout for an opening, and he threw for it every time—even if Ron caught two out of every three throws. He really was an excellent Keeper. Harry supposed he might’ve gone professional too, if George hadn’t needed him so badly at the shop, without Fred.
“Am I really that bad?”
“Alright,” said Harry. “I’m following you so far.”
"It’s just completely mad to me that no one’s even considered what magic could do for the least fortunate living without it."
By the time August’s second Saturday arrived, Harry was really looking forward to exploring London when he wasn’t having to relive his parents’ deaths.
A glance down between them made clear Draco was already hard again but Harry shifted down to suck at his cock for a bit anyway, until he moaned so much Harry was achingly hard too. Then he was moving back up, his mouth in search of Draco’s, and Draco greeted him tracing Harry's lips with his tongue, teasing slowly between them.
He pulled out momentarily to capture an escaping trail before pushing back in, wriggling around inside until Draco writhed back on his tongue.
When Harry appeared in his sitting room that evening, in a cloud of soot, Ginny was already home from the Burrow.
“Could we get back to work now?” Draco drawled irritably.
Harry smirked. “You’re welcome.”
Of course he remembered the Malfoy trials that January following the war, and the horrors those trials had forced them all to relive, all of it rushing by again in a painful flash of harsh reality. It had been nearly a year since the start of them—though it felt like so much longer since they'd had to fight for their lives.
“Thanks for the daring rescue, Potter. Now we’re even,” Draco drawled with hoarse amusement, rising to his feet and stepping closer for too-clever fingers to work his cock gently back into his pants, doing up his trousers, belt and all by hand.
Cassie chose that moment to return.
“I ought to leave you here,” Draco drawled, gently pulling himself off Harry’s cock with a quietly hitched breath.
Draco’s breathless cursing cut into a throaty moan, shuddering stiff against Harry, and coming hard as he spattered their stomachs with each hot spasm of his cock.
Harry tried to help, but his hands kept wandering, and he was caught up in the bruising heat of Draco’s lips on his.
Somehow Draco managed to put it as though it were simply an inevitability, and Cassie promised to see them tomorrow, wishing them a very good afternoon.
“…your hair is blinding in the moonlight.”
“Good luck, Gin. You’ll be brilliant as always, I’m sure of it.”
Never one to mince words Ron Weasley, though even he seemed disinclined to fight Harry any more on the matter.
“Yes well, finish your coffee, and we’ll go sort it out.”
“The mug is charmed; it’ll stay hot if you’d like to sleep longer.”
As they worked to breathe again, Draco nevertheless nudged his lips softly to Harry’s, not fully a kiss, as they were both too pleasure-shocked to find the sense for it.
Annoyed at himself, Harry re-read his letter before he scratched out a quick signature at the bottom, and took a long swallow of the fiery liquid in his glass. He attributed the letter’s warm closing to the drink he was enjoying, and that was excuse enough to call it done, and send it off with Ginny’s golden barn owl.
“You were flattered. Let’s move on, shall we?”
“Well, I thought it might inspire you to reciprocate, you know.”
“I’m just borrowing them for a bit, it’s really not a big deal.”
Friday was the soonest he could find a spare moment for anything, and it was his lunch break—right in the middle of his day Field Training in Muggle London.
The silence stretched out between them before he couldn’t help but ask the next most obvious question. “What for?”
He leaned in, biting a slow kiss into the soft underside of Draco’s exposed thigh—and kept at it until he’d left behind a dark pink bloom on pale skin. Draco’s moans pitched deeper between every quiet gasp and tight breath, the sound of him testing Harry’s patience not to pull out his wand and fuck Draco into the chair, but then—
“I’m not understanding the point—feels sort of annoying actually,” Harry mused, straightening his shoulders a bit as he adjusted to the potion.
“...Good.” Malfoy sounded a touch distracted himself now, rolling up his sleeves and pausing a moment to eye Harry a bit expectantly.
Draco caught at the ladder’s iron rail for balance, hooking one leg over Harry’s hip to give him wider access to thrust into. He moaned into Harry’s mouth, who groaned back, driving his cock in deeper.
“'Of course you did,” Harry muttered.
It was nice to shift focus for a few hours—though Harry still felt the chaos always looming on the next day’s horizon.
“You wanted to do about half today?”
“Brilliant.”
“Malfoy.”
“What?” Now he was quite lost.
“What the hell?” Harry whispered, a little embarrassed that he had to bite so hard on his lip just to quiet an unsatisfied groan when the touch and the feeling vanished.
“It’s a matter of principle. Your hair is defiant,” Draco drawled casually, but his ears were looking a little flushed.
That was enough to pull Harry’s focus off adding to the already impressive display of lovebites he’d left since yesterday. “How many days?”
“I’m really not. It’s been—”
As they prepared to leave Draco instructed him to straighten out his shirt, and spent a minute or so fussing at his own hair in the mirror-wall, pointedly ignoring when Harry outright laughed at him.
Harry tensed when Malfoy caught at his sleeve, but he only tugged him a step closer. The feather-light tracing of Malfoy’s fingertips slipped beneath the cuff of Harry’s shirtsleeve, brushing against the inside of his wrist—sparking tendrilled bursts of hot, pure pleasure from every ghosting touch.
Harry was rather distracted watching the process, and Draco snuck in behind him to nip into the curve of his shoulder. He started, fighting off a shiver.
“How very sweet. Now keep going.”
If Draco minded Harry talking about his engagement, he didn’t let on, only shrugged rather disinterestedly.
He surveyed it more closely, now that his mind was focused on the task at hand, and not on Draco’s…everything.
“Have I just
“Your stamina is improving, Potter,” Draco eventually taunted.
“If you wouldn’t mind, I might join you; I'd no idea you had a garden.”
“Not as if you don’t need it, the way you’ve been sleeping lately,” she chided him.
“You’ve already promised to feed me, you’ll need to work way harder than that to get me to leave now.”
“Fine,” Harry agreed. “What sort of soup?”
A few slippery drops slid down Harry’s arse, and Harry was now so incredibly hard again he couldn’t keep from stroking himself to the feeling. His moan drew out, hoarse with aching need—
this place was considered dodgy even in Death Eater circles?”
“Twenty times? Why?”
what you want out of life, Potter?”
They relaxed their holds on one another in the uncertainty of the moment. Harry let go of Draco’s arse and plopped down on the tartan settee with a tense sigh. After a quiet beat, Draco sat down beside him with a small frown, though Harry’s frown had gone far more troubled.
His mind was torturing him.
“He wasn’t
Draco looked as if he couldn’t tell if that was a meant to be a compliment—and Harry didn’t really know either.
As close as they were, when silver met green, a chill danced down Harry’s spine that he found utterly maddening, given he had to walk away.
was he doing this to himself, and more importantly, why was he doing it to Ginny. Why was he being such a terrible fiancé?
Draco’s tongue slid tauntingly past his lips, not far behind in following him to feverish heights. Short sharp nails drew firm over Harry’s back, pulling himself in closer to thrust faster into speeding strokes until he came hard between them, the heat of it mixing with the cooling water rushing over them. He moaned through his orgasm, as Harry kissed and stroked him unrelentingly.
Draco tightened deliberately around his cock, squeezing through the last twitches of Harry’s climax. Harry’s vision flashed white with pleasure.
Draco smirked at him. “Perhaps quite distantly. I wouldn’t worry your messy head about it.”
Rocking his hips up, Draco worked himself closer to the edge of the desk, and more firmly onto Harry’s cock.
He had also dropped his pants.
“Found it in the back of the attic. I think it’s just an ordinary Muggle one—will it work for a tester?”
“…Pretty sure,” Harry lied, and hitched a gasp when Draco started biting repeatedly just beneath his ear—sharp enough to be punishment, only it felt so perfectly incredible that it was really a reward.
Before he got around to fucking him, Harry dragged him firmly over his lap. Draco’s cock prodded stiffly into his thigh, twitching enticingly when Harry forcefully smacked his arse.
“What’s the matter, Potter, don’t want to come so soon?”
Draco was frowning, and Harry wondered if he’d offended him somehow, or if he was only thinking.
Harry leant a bit sideways, only enough to dig into his robes on the chair, searching for his wand one-handed. He cast a quick cleaning charm on them, enough to take care of the worst of the mess, although—
Fucking take me.”
Inexplicably, Draco’s reaction to his speechlessness was something akin to a quiet growl. Draco pushed off the desk, and Harry quite quickly found himself shoved into the nearest armchair.
“Draco,” Harry murmured, and Draco kissed him.
He really needed to stop having thoughts like that.
Draco summoned them a couple bottles of pumpkin juice from the kitchen, along with a couple of scones, an apricot for himself and, after consulting with him, a banana for Harry. It was a bit impressive to Harry he always managed so many simultaneous summonings and somehow didn’t lose anything along the way.
“That I’m not listening.”
“What are you doing...?” he drawled apprehensively.
Harry rubbed tiredly at the back of his neck, trying to find words that might reassure them both, though he knew they probably did not exist.
“Tea?” Harry offered.
Once he’d wiped his mouth a bit, he waited for Draco to find the focus to look down again, before he jumped right into taunting him.
Somewhat over-eager again, when they swapped, Harry immediately sunk to his knees to suck Draco’s cock into his mouth with a low hum.
“What?”
“Maybe we should take turns,” he suggested.
Harry took a deep breath, hoping he sounded nice and casual, as if he hadn’t just recently spent several hours naked with the man. He was caught somewhere between being proud of himself, and concerned that he was getting so much better at lying to people.
“What are they doing here? They like misery and whatnot, but hadn’t we cleared them all out after the War?”
Lifting up to help, Draco huffed out a short laugh.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Stop flattering me and get on with it.”
And he wasn’t exactly afraid; the thought of what Draco might feel like inside of him turned Harry on a rather ridiculous amount—but he wasn’t yet certain about it either, and it felt like something he really
“You said it yourself, Malfoy. We need to get back, we don’t have time to explore every mystery in this place.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry smirked at him, but he stepped readily back. Draco was already neatly charming his dropped book back up onto the shelf, not quite meeting his eye.
Draco eyed him a long moment before he went on. “By the way, I’ve got something for you.”
All he’d been told was he’d be training in Muggle London that day, and that he was to come dressed appropriately for the task, so that he might better blend in. It was one of the few fashion decisions Harry had ever made confidently, turning up in a pair of jeans, beat up trainers and a simple shirt just tight enough not to catch on things and slow him up in an emergency.
Draco pushed his trousers down to release him, and immediately kneeled down to capture Harry’s tip on his tongue—a perfectly surrounding heat as Draco’s tongue danced over his shaft in a taunting play that left Harry clutching at the sides of the ladder for purchase.
Malfoy’s head fell back, his eyes slipping closed as he fucked up into Harry’s tight hold.
“I’m sorry for worrying you,” he started, because he was that.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I’m ready to tear my hair out over it honestly.”
“Well I wasn’t happy with it, was I? But I think I’ve finally got it right—it’s a good balance of leek to parsnip, and you need the apple and mustard as well, or there’s no depth to it at all.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Of course, eventually they did come around to the subject he had been dreading so.
“I’m not much of a housekeeper.”
“Any day, Potter.”
Harry layered on his lack of enthusiasm, but on consideration, if Draco was willing to teach him how to avoid embarrassing himself, maybe they were lessons worth learning. He thought all the pretence horribly tedious, but what with the eyes of most of Wizarding society tending to be on him at all times, it was hard to argue it wouldn’t be a useful skill to have.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Potter, are you actually aware you’re incapable of taking your eyes off of me?”
“What? Why not?”
There were all sorts of things about Malfoy that Aberforth might’ve been referring to, given how rumours tended to spread in such a small community—and also how much time Aberforth had spent talking to Dobby—but he felt a bit flustered at the warning anyway.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“If I can find the time,” Harry promised, hedging a bit.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Firewhisky?” Draco offered coolly, walking back toward the tent they’d shared the night before, what would soon be their new office, drawn by the promise of the spirits they’d left in its kitchen.
“You knew I was following you,” he said, more realisation than question.
“I’ve no idea. Possibly both. You must’ve wanted to fuck me quite badly.”
Having only been once before, and under duress at the time, Harry was nervous he might Splinch himself trying to get to Malfoy Manor, but when he popped into being he was standing at its gates. A peacock squawked at him from behind the gate, and Harry looked at it warily as Draco waved his wand about with some quiet murmurs.
“I can certainly give it some thought. Nothing is coming to mind just now, of course, but if I can find anything I’ll—oh, dear. How will I get in touch with you?”
“I’m hardly going to force you.”
Groaning again, he bit into the flushed center of Draco’s back where his mouth had landed, and Draco shuddered in the aftershock.
All over again the heat inside Draco was nearly unbearable. It would have been so very easy for Harry to come, but he found the will to do what they had gone to all the trouble for—he pulled Draco back against his chest to see as he gripped tightly around his cock, tugging with aroused fascination when he could watch the milky drops of precum swelling at his tip.
” Hermione chastised.
Even if it hurt, once they started kissing they couldn’t stop, and they went on fucking each other’s fists with growing urgency. Draco caught at the soaked mop of Harry’s hair to keep their lips hard together, muting their moans. Harry’s grew steadily rougher and deeper the closer he got to coming, and Draco’s grew longer, and more wanting—but they never stopped kissing.
“How much longer do you think we should go tonight?”
Honestly, Harry wasn’t sure which he would rather it be, but neither was preferrable.
“You want to come, Harry?”
What was Malfoy’s idea of ‘fun’ anyway?
“I’m not wearing a coat, Potter. Also, I gave them all fancy new clothes when the house passed to me. Most of them have moved on to Hogwarts.”
“Mostly?”
Harry wasn’t sure he believed Malfoy, but found he was instinctively swaying a bit in his direction anyway. That seemed dangerous.
Unable to stifle a rather loud snort of derisive laughter, he ducked back to avoid the impact when Draco tried flicking his forehead in retaliation.
“…I might’ve had a thought earlier.”
“There now, we’ll be able to toss about whatever spells we like without alerting anyone else. What’s the latest then?”
But when Harry closed his eyes in his tensest moments, what came to him was not red hair and soft freckled skin but blond and hard and breathlessly moaning Harry’s name. He thought Ginny undeniably beautiful too, he had for years, and she only grew more so every year that moved them further away from the darkest moments of their lives.
“You’re awfully curious this morning.”
Draco’s hips jerked rewardingly back on him, and Harry had to find the rhythm of his impact again—but then he did.
“Long-term, secure, unrestricted,” the former Slytherin repeated, almost more to himself.  “Well we knew about the secure bit, but this should give us, or me really, somewhere to start with the enchantments…Not sure how we’ll manage balancing security spells versus not restricting access, but I’ll give it some thought.”
“It’s nothing,” Draco dismissed, nodding his head to the door they’d come through. “Let’s get back to it, then.”
“Promise?” Harry prompted.
It was decidedly difficult to break, now they’d started—but Harry managed.
Draco appeared to be waiting for him to elaborate. When Harry only shrugged in lieu of an explanation, he gave up and went back to his menu. “Right. Fish. Grand.”
“Sorry,” he apologised.
“I’m sorry, Gin. Only at least let me get another drink or two before you ask me to make a fool of myself in public.”
Then Draco whispered another charm, one he had never heard before.
When they arrived to the Burrow, Ron wanted to use the Floo to head home, but Molly caught them at the door and obliged them to stay and eat. She also insisted Ron take home food for Hermione as well (‘
Harry nodded noncommittally, tasting his own again. “Sounds right.”
Not an easy task, when Draco was a bit taller than him, not to mention his mouth was teasing at Harry’s ear all the way. He nearly dropped him halfway up. A Feather-Light Charm might’ve helped, but the weight of him rubbing against Harry's cock was purely sinful, and Draco was doing it on purpose.
Then Draco would pull up until Harry very nearly slipped out of him, gasping as Harry squirmed beneath him.
“Hmm?” Ginny hummed blankly, glancing up from her paper, where the Harpies’ newest Chaser was jetting across the front page of the Prophet’s sports section on a battered-looking Thunderbolt X.
“You’ll need to put some clothes on—I can’t have you distressing all the portraits on our way to the kitchen.”
,” Draco gasped, the force of Harry’s hips rubbing his cock into the hot sticky mess of his sheets as he spilled inside him.
“I didn’t ask you to pretend. I
For one thing there was a mouldy-wood smell permeating the house which neither of them could manage to expel, no matter how many cleaning charms they used. There was also the bath tap that never entirely stopped dripping, and the rough stone walls of the cellar, which was always flooded after any extended bouts of rain.
“That’s what you’re here for. It’s your job to keep me alive.”
“Did you want to go over the spells now, or—?”
Obviously, trying to put it all from his mind was not doing him any good.
He felt an internal rush of embarrassment that he had not thought to check—pondering self-deprecatingly why anyone had allowed him to become an Auror in the first place, given his general lack of vigilance.
“Deeper,” Draco pleaded, tight with want and stunningly desperate.
Draco trailed off, intently scrawling a note on something at the far corner of the page. Harry sipped his tea, waiting for him to finish writing before he continued.
And Draco was right there, even and controlled as he walked Harry through the spell’s complexities—and he smelled so intoxicatingly good that Harry was getting a little hard, even before Draco pressed firmly against him from behind, brushing his lips at the nape of Harry’s neck.
Coming from Malfoy, Harry thought that was incredibly rich.
“Bastard,” Harry cursed.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Hang on, there’s more,” Harry promised. He used the marker to draw a simple HP over the little dome, and it drew itself on its partner in tandem. When he erased the P on the other light, it erased on both.
It honestly hadn’t occurred to him that Malfoy might actually keep his word and attempt to assist him with his intoxicated (and probably unwise) notions of making the world a better place. Malfoy taking to heart
When he thought about it, the realisation was a rather painful punch to his emotional core. He had to blink back a sudden mistiness in his eyes, clearing his throat, and scrambling to think of anything to say that wasn’t the truth.
In that moment he was almost painfully cognisant of exactly what the right and moral choice would have been. And yet—
But he was losing all sense of time, and found himself feeling out the long length of Draco’s swelled cock as he stroked him, the weight of it and the way he grew ever stiffer each time Harry pressed into that place inside that sent Draco into an arching writhe against him.
Draco even made to pull away, but Harry pulled him back again, and that quickly they were kissing each other—for a little too long.
“You designed the potion, Malfoy,” Harry intoned, but he was shifting closer anyway, stopping poised just over the slimmer, slightly taller man—not quite yet touching, though it was taking an incredible amount of his restraint. “You know exactly what it’s telling me to do.”
understand, Mr. Potter. I don’t want to get into any trouble with the Ministry. I can keep your visits to myself, and whatever else we discuss.”
“It was pecking incessantly at the corridor window. I’ve tried collecting the letter myself, but that only starts it screeching at me. I wasn’t sure if I should wake you, but I thought it might be important.”
Harry thought that only seemed likely to worry everyone more. He recalled how Ginny had reacted to the books—and the way she’d looked at him at the Ball, like she couldn’t trust him not to be reckless.
“I’m so sorry about that! Always a new crisis. Now where were we?”
Enjoy!
“Er, yes. It is a bit weird,” he admitted. Ron had no idea precisely how weird.
Draco drew in a sharp, controlling breath—but then he sneered. “You knew
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Alright, whatever. I won’t tell her.” It looked as if it pained him to say it, but Blaise was still staring at him. “…Unbelievable. Fucking
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“You’re ridiculous,” Draco responded with a rather snide scoff. “Are you taking this seriously or not?”
“I think it gets you off that I’m always watching you.”
They cleaned up after themselves, and Draco gave the whole place a proper inspection before they headed back out to start the next round of extensions.
“I know how to read, Potter, that’s not the problem. Let me try again.”
“Potter. What is it?”
“He’s helping me with a project.”
“Serves you right,” Draco derided with an insolent laugh.
“Cheers then,” Harry offered instead, laughing when Draco gave him a light shove out of the alley.
Ginny frowned. “Are you alright? You two didn’t fight, did you?”
“Potter’s fucking
“I imagine he does—which I might add, will have no effect on whether or not I decide to do so. I was raised to respect my father…I’ve learned not to trust his judgement. His plans for my future very nearly got us all killed.”
Harry watched a shift of shock and recognition cross Malfoy’s expression before he pulled his usual superior mask.
By the time his meeting crept up on him Harry was very ready for a break. He waved off Savage’s offer to buy him a butterbeer at the Cauldron, and set off in the opposite direction.
“We’ve been making good progress. A few more hours tonight and we could probably finish by late tomorrow, couldn’t we?”
He had made plenty of impulsive choices in his past, but he thought this might be a crowning achievement in rash decisions. Had the Memorial that morning hit him so hard that he completely lost his mind?
There was a hardness in her voice that made him a bit sad, but she was right. He shrugged as they joined a short but scattered queue of guests for an open Floo home.
Malfoy’s magical signature was all over it, dancing about with the travelling spell—but there was nothing else there to set off any alarm bells. It was oddly calming actually, and Harry found his lips quirking somewhat inexplicably.
“That’s…an adjustment,” Harry reflected.
“The longer this takes, the longer it drags on for the Muggles, the Ministry, the whole lot…” Harry was torn. “But if you really think you could pull it off, I haven’t got a better idea. We can’t very well go around Obliviating everyone involved.”
Snorting a laugh, Harry felt suddenly a bit flushed. Perhaps he did know.
“Right then. Which way are we headed?”
“You must’ve had a lot of practice then.”
They went on challenging each other for more than an hour, and at some point Harry lost track of the time.
The frustration was too much, and he was shoving to his feet, and matching him eye-to-eye.
The first location they examined had been too sloped, and the next one too obviously flooded to be a good candidate for their needs—because of course, it was raining on the day they had set aside to go look at Cassie’s lot suggestions.
was very wrong… but Draco had been unusually un-snarky when he left that morning, and Harry was a bit worried he might’ve upset him somehow.
“Ginny says that you’ve been working on something with Draco Malfoy. She said he’s been owling rather a lot… I’m sure you can understand why this might be a bit concerning for anyone who knows—”
“Something wrong?” he tried instead.
Beyond being an insufferable prick, and often a hateful one, there was also the attempted poisoning that had nearly killed Ron, and the necklace which had nearly killed Katie. They were unsuccessful murder attempts, but Draco’s intent to kill had been undeniably there.
Groaning quietly, Malfoy hurried his buttons open, in a rush he had not been in when he'd undone Harry’s.
Unperturbed, Draco broke the seal and poured a proper two fingers of tawny liquid into their only glass.
“We’re quite late you know.”
“Night,” Harry muttered somewhat sulkily.
Harry fucked him at the same hard, slow rhythm, until Draco moaned Harry’s name warningly, and gasped his next “
Harry thought her frown was only tempered by the fact they were in a crowded pub.
“But she did it anyway?”
It was all too much, was the problem. It was hard for him to see the whole occasion as anything other than a painful revisiting of his least favorite nightmares, and Harry felt a prevailing desire to be anywhere else.
“Goodnight,” he murmured.
“Let me do it then.”
After everything Harry said to him last Saturday, it was too harsh.
The tables they passed on their way out were much more sparsely populated.
“Should we talk properly about what happened yesterday?”
Draco’s cock had crossed Harry’s mind and his dreams, a few times. On length alone it was nearly impossible for Harry not to consider the thought of it being somewhere other than his mouth. It seemed almost a waste otherwise.
Draco’s smirk sharpened. “Pleasure. Now if we could only do something about your hair...”
Draco huffed impatiently at his ear. “One at a time, Potter.”
“Draco Malfoy? I didn’t see him anywhere at the reception, are you sure?”
“Potter. You look as if you’re about to eat me alive.”
“You’ve done this before,” he managed to say breathlessly. If he were one to believe in the concept of sin, he could only have called the inside of Malfoy’s mouth sinful—a perfectly surrounding wet heat, swallowing around him every time Harry thrust slowly in.
?” Harry was proud of himself for switching to Parseltongue mid-sentence, and was rewarded watching the flush painting high on pale cheeks. “Afraid you can’t control yourself?”
He blinked surprise when Malfoy chose two flutes of something bubbly from a small tower of them, and immediately handed one his way.
“Right…I’ll do my best. If you don’t hear from me by next week, send a search party.”
On the other hand, Harry reasoned, after everything he had ever been through—perhaps it couldn’t hurt to give himself what he actually wanted while he had the chance. No one suspected a thing, and why would they? Draco was pretty meticulously discreet about all of it. So long as no one knew, what could it hurt to indulge a little longer?
“Malfoy?” Harry shot back with bewildered amusement.
Then he Apparated home—before he could give in to the impulse to stay and sort out why Malfoy was so reluctant to accept a simple ‘thank you’.
But it was growing to be quite late, and Draco asked him to leave everything behind, until he had the energy for casting such a complicated spell.
Draco eyed him critically. “You’re slouching again.”
“Merciful fuck. I might be sick.”
He wasn’t sure how much longer he could stand it—living at this level of wrong, all the lying. When he actually emerged from the comfort of his denial long enough to examine any of it—Harry had to wonder
Recently the Dementors presence in the city was less overwhelming than it had been when Harry’s training began last October, but enough of them remained to be troubling. Encouragingly, Harry’s Patronus had come out luminously bright that morning—only he wasn’t exactly admitting to himself what he’d thought of when he cast.
“I want you.”
“Only one I’ve got packs quite the punch.”
“How should I…er.”
And Harry hadn't got off as easy as he’d thought.
Harry let out an appreciative sort of groan, really not bothered about the cleanliness of the wall, and fully content to let Draco ravish his lips, as he seemed intent on doing just then—biting and sucking, tracing each with a talented tongue only to bite a little harder. It felt pretty incredible, and Harry’s hands travelled unhesitantly to his arse to pull him in even closer. The persistent adrenaline of fear was still raging through him, but it all quickly shot southward as teeth pinched sharp and impatient beneath his ear. It was incredibly distracting.
“You know what you’ve done, Potter.”
Draco shot him a sharp look over his wine glass and Harry only laughed.
, it supplied, but he couldn’t quite voice it.
Harry snorted laughter despite himself, but Hermione’s concern tempered him.
It was about quarter-till-one in the morning when Harry realised how very easy it would be to see him. He also recalled how direct Draco had been about coming to see Harry on his birthday—as if Harry were the only gift he had wanted.
“Then—you’re still in?”
“Crafting antidotes for poisons which can’t be identified using Golpalott's Third Law.”
Whether or not they would have any success moving forward really depended on getting started competently—and Cassie would be integral to that plan. He knew there was no practical way to accomplish what they were setting out to do without the input of someone who properly understood the community. Involving her further was a precariously calculated risk, but one they needed to take.
As he Apparated into the village, the taste of cinnamon lingered still at the tip of Harry’s tongue.
“You’ve just watched me make it. It’s primarily wine and cherries—though I’ve had to alter the recipe some. As written, it has a tendency to come out far too bitter.”
think I might want, Potter?”
“Wha’thefuck,” he ran together, still sleepily lacking the coordination to peer back over his shoulder.
Draco’s arsecheeks were still so
As a sweat built over them both, Harry fucked him a bit harder.
And evidently they’d done very little to upgrade the security in the intervening years.
It could not really be who Harry thought he saw; he couldn’t imagine Malfoy ever turning up on a day like today—
“I was just thinking over the illusions we’re using for the façades and wallpapers and such—and d’you realise what we’ve forgotten?”
“Isn’t it just what you say?”
Draco smirked pointedly. “You’d rather I didn’t bite you then?”
Yet he found himself taking a step closer.
“Yes, alright. I suppose it’s time for bed, isn’t it?”
“How would you feel about duck?”
When he’d finished at work, Harry spent a couple of hours running errands in London, then hurried home after to pack a bag with several changes of clothes, and his toothbrush.
“I thought you liked my arsehole,” Draco drawled back.
Harry had just been curious, but given the writhe of Draco’s hips—he decided to just go with it, and discovered he rather enjoyed lingeringly fucking Draco with his tongue. He pulled out occasionally to brush his lips over the sensitive ring, or rub the flat of his tongue against it before he would press back in, each of Draco’s tight quiet moans compelling him on.
It was starting to occur to him that he might be in real trouble.
Of course, some of what he’d seen through those mirrors had been pretty unforgettable—like the way Draco’s expression went all blissful when Harry—
Harry coughed his doubtful amusement. “You’re suggesting that we don’t work ourselves to complete exhaustion this time?”
It was quite dark, but even without lighting his wand, Harry could never have mistaken that wry drawl for anyone else.
“Shut up, Potter. Don’t move.”
Malfoy looked as if he doubted that, but Harry proceeded to bring him up to speed on what he’d learned thus far, and about Cassie, her sister, and her agreement to be a point of contact in future. He thought he might’ve been going too fast but Malfoy seemed to be following—pacing through the grass as he did.
“That’s for me to know.” Harry tried to use his authoritative Auror voice.
He’d no sooner finished than Draco was starting in about the windows.
“Should I add a bit of pain potion then?”
“I won’t make you wear a tie, but I’ll have to insist on trousers, also a proper shirt and a belt at the very least—you can borrow mine. Oh, and obviously you won’t be wearing your filthy trainers.”
It was approaching noon, but Draco summoned what they needed for a late morning tea, and they ate in the garden with the peacocks.
He was finding it very hard to think past the feeling.
Hermione tugged Harry around to the table behind the stairs leading up to the Inn’s few rooms. It was always just a touch quieter there.
“I’ll be fine,” Harry tried to reassure her.
“What time s’it?” he asked warily.
“Don’t call them that, Malfoy.” Harry was too tired for his nonsense, and yet— “Let me guess, in
It would seem Lawrence had learned this lesson the hard way, and did not want anyone making the same mistakes.
They watched the crowds disperse, many people already making for Hogsmeade—all of them trying to beat the rush, and creating the rush in the process. Ginny looked as if she might say something to him, patting Harry’s shoulder gently, but then they were interrupted.
When Draco freed his wrists, he went right back to exploring with touch, something claiming in the trace of his hands down the path of Draco’s spine, straight to his arse, which he proceeded to smack quite hard.
“Bastard,” Draco panted eventually. Sitting still on Harry’s softening cock, he shot a look of exhausted frustration over his shoulder.
“Fuck’s sake, not yet. Do you ever want to finish this?”
“It’s how we’re going keep in touch,” Harry explained. “And it is magic, only hopefully a little subtler. Here, I’ll show you.”
The ballroom’s floor was white marble, inlaid with an intricate mosaic of mother-of-pearl stars. It was all distressingly familiar for a room Harry was sure he’d never been in before.
“I’ve already cast the spells,” he drawled, pushing up into Harry’s friction.
He wasn’t even certain he’d read her properly at first, but now she had gone a bit giggly and he became even more certain—however, he was also disinclined to come right out and ask.
As they moved past a noisy pub, and several shuttered businesses, Harry noted the street looked a mess, even more so than it had the first time he’d ever come to the Ministry with Mr. Weasley. It had been nearly four years since that day, but after all that had happened in the world, it wasn’t terribly shocking that London was a bit worse for wear as well.
“What happened?” he murmured.
Draco made a long moaned noise then that Harry never heard before—it was visceral and uninhibited and painfully fucking hot.
“I’m not worried about it. It was just weird, sort of. Not bad really, but—”
“Where Black died?”
“Honestly Malfoy? Here?” Harry very much enjoyed throwing his words back at him.
Harry had a nearly negative desire to be at this wedding reception. There were a number of reasons for this, chief among them being it was too stuffy, too formal, and too few of his friends had been invited. Unfortunately, as a friend of the bride, Ginny had felt somewhat obligated to attend, and she hadn’t really given Harry much choice in the matter of whether or not he would be joining her.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
When he did answer, his tone was quite deliberate.
He was only in jeans and a t-shirt—what he always wore to hunt down Dementors these days—but Harry swallowed tightly watching the corner of Draco’s lower lip catch between his teeth for the briefest of seconds.
“My skin is exceedingly sensitive, Potter.”
Ginny stared at him disbelievingly. “Draco Malfoy is lending
“What’s Lovegood got to say then?”
Malfoy surveyed the rounded brass box curiously, turning it over in his hands before he prised open its lid. It clinked slow notes at them, the key having not been wound.
Their formal outing wasn’t as torturous as he’d expected, their earlier meeting had been quite encouraging, and they’d only been caught out in the rain a couple times. Overall, Harry thought it was a pretty successful afternoon.
They were hardly the most comfortable clothes he’d ever worn, but they certainly fit well, and inarguably they looked good.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I want to. Stop talking.”
“That’s completely irrelevant,” Draco sidestepped with a hinted smirk. “Either way I’m right, so you might as well just do as I say.”
“Fuck off,” Harry laughed.
After breakfast they headed back to the ballroom.
“Just look for clocks,” he repeated. “Hall of Prophecy will be through there—if there’s anything left of it.”
“School might be over, Harry, but we’re still in this together. If you need us, never think we’re too busy to help, alright?”
Cornelius ignored them both in favor of the scatter of snacks Harry was distributing.
Now Harry could put the proper force into pushing his cock in past taut muscle, sliding stiffly deeper. Driving in so gradually felt devastatingly good, and his cock twitched hard inside, drawing dulcetly low moans from them both.
How much longer his better judgement could hold out was a real concern for him—
Malfoy turned a wry look on the canvas-walled chamber—which might have fit within it several regulation-sized Quidditch fields, comfortably.
Draco pushed back on him willingly. “
Harry had spotted the concerned crinkle of her brow even from a distance.
“What’s all this?”
Curtains and meetings, danger and trauma, also blow jobs, or at least one.
Draco requited with a harder bite to his trapped prick, and left Harry throbbing in protest when he sat upright, taking the heat of his mouth away from where Harry wanted it so badly.
By the time he reached the gates, Harry was mostly decided on an excuse—he just hoped he could deliver it without letting on how close he felt to falling apart with guilt.
Sighing, Draco gave in.
Harry had no real hope of swallowing it all, not with Draco’s shaft still shuddering in his throat, but he gave it his best effort.
Draco arched into the steady impale of Harry’s cock, his own proudly stiff against his stomach.
Draco drew in a short anticipant breath as Harry tossed the spoon aside, not caring where it landed, too busy surging down to suck the honey off of Draco’s nipples, which he had been certain to cover especially well.
“My tur-
He caught Harry’s tangled hair in a tight grip, and Harry gladly gave over control—even when Draco pressed in deeper than he thought he could take and he choked a little. His cock ached sympathetically, all his remaining focus on controlling the sharp edge of his teeth, and fitting his lips sorely around Draco’s thrusting prick.
“Er, that’s alright. Honestly it’s already more sleep than I’ve got all week, combined.”
Malfoy scowled out at the grounds while Harry waited for an answer, and once again found himself admiring the extraordinary reflectivity of platinum hair.
In the bedroom he watched Draco stripping down to his pants before he did the same, removing the perfect fit of borrowed clothes, and sensing the gaze following him as he did, before he was crawling into bed to join him.
“Hmm?” Harry hummed.
But the details were already fading away from him, and by the time he was half into his morning tea, Harry could only recall the cool glow of the prophecies, and the reflection of that same light in a pair of silver eyes.
Clever fingers moved sultrily over Harry’s—and on to the supple holly of his wand. Draco stroked lingering and firm where their fingers met on its handle, almost as if he were touching Harry’s cock instead.
He slouched in his chair, a growing uncomfortableness in his pants, completely unable to get Draco out of his head.
“I’m not worried. You’re worried.”
“What the fuck, Potter. What does that have to do with anything?”
“You’re mentioning it again,” he pointed out in faint annoyance.
“Drink?”
But then Ginny Disapparated to Holyhead, and Harry stood in his sitting room a while longer, alone with too many of his thoughts and worries once again.
“It’s for Cassie,” Harry tried to explain. “I was planning to try a Protean Charm to keep in touch with her.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco’s moan went guttural and low, and Harry groaned back, grinding down harder before he was aiming to find the best spot. As he rolled his hips for it, he found the coordination to tug his shirt over his head, press the sweat-sheening warmth of his chest to Draco’s back and feel him arch when Harry found what his cock was searching for.
Except Harry was certain it was him. For a split second, Malfoy glanced back over his shoulder and Harry thought he might’ve looked right at him before he disappeared into the Forbidden Forest’s thick tree line.
“I wasn’t asking you to come,” Harry pointed out frankly. “I’m not trying to make this any harder on myself than necessary.”
“Right here.”
Draco let out a whining moan, and Harry chased it relentlessly against the impact of a pale arse shoving back with as much force as Draco could whilst being fucked into the settee cushions. Harry fucked him stubbornly hard, until the swollen length of Draco’s cock, rubbing against the rough upholstery under them, covered it in sticky spurts of seed.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Still gasping, Harry nevertheless pushed his tongue past Draco’s lips to slide against his tongue, and their moans intertwined again. He got in a bit of residual thrusting too, drawing out their searing afterglow—impossible to resist when Draco’s ensuing noises were so enticing.
Draco’s footsteps echoed purposefully off the marble as he crossed the room. In the nearly ten years Harry had known him, Draco had always seemed to walk that way. At times he had been running purposefully away in fear, or even purposefully striding toward trouble, often up to no good—but always his steps were sharp and certain, carried with the sort of confidence Harry often wished for, yet only seemed capable of channeling in the direst of circumstances.
Harry shut his eyes, and let it happen—momentarily afraid to move, or open them—lest she see the war of emotions in him. He felt worse still when Ginny smiled into their soft press of lips, and then it was over, and Harry had to take a deep breath before he opened his eyes.
“Shhh.”
“…Moral support?” he suggested, at a loss for a better excuse.
come. Not until I say.”
As he made his way around the far end of the lake, covering familiar ground quite quickly, he forgot all about going down to The Hog’s Head for lunch.
“You’re fucking Harry Potter.”
Harry's birthday is here, but will he get what he really wants?
As they parted breathless again, much of Draco’s smugness had faded behind the deepening desire in his eyes. “Tell me.”
Draco panted heavily over his lips, speeding a rhythm to ride him properly, hard, until Harry came for him—right when he asked. He kept up the roll of his hips as Harry stroked him more roughly, until he was shooting hot between them—moaning louder as he tensed all around Harry’s spent cock.
Harry snorted. “Who’s faffing? I’m still eating.”
“Alright then. Show me what all I’m meant to be practicing.”
Harry made Ginny’s tea, but he didn’t feel like a prince.
“We’ll go with that then.” Draco rose from the table, and finished off his tea.
When Harry found Draco napping on the settee by his desk, something very deep in him stuttered hard—and Harry was pretty sure it wasn’t anything to do with his cock.
“Why even bother to say sorry when you’re not?” Draco prodded.
“But you don’t anymore?”
“It very well might…” He frowned at it a moment longer before patting Harry’s cheek lightly. “Come with me, Potter. The spells can wait.”
“What is it? And what are you doing out here?”
Being still inside him at the time, he could feel Draco’s soundless laugh.
“All clean?” he drawled wryly.
Draco made a complaining noise, then let slip a small sleepy hum, apparently not yet ready to open his eyes, in the same way Harry was not yet ready to stop touching his hair now that he’d started.
“You’ve got such a dirty mouth,” Harry whispered, slightly awestruck.
Malfoy let that hang between them in a beat of long incredulous silence before he replied, as always, the bearer of biting sarcasm. "That's a lovely sentiment—"
It was so
“I’m glad you find my misery so amusing.”
He flushed. “I don’t know—what if I don’t like it?”
The quiet noises that fell from Draco’s lips then were more pained, but he kept up his unrelenting friction, until Harry’s cock twitched and spilled between them one more time. He was too wrapped up in coming to notice Draco watching him with a half-lidded sort of possessiveness.
It was a short walk, and as they approached the squat and otherwise unremarkable brick building, it became clear the shelter was experiencing a bit of a rush. The only other time Harry had seen the queue this long was when he’d visited with Savage on very early mornings.
Harry’d had to pop up to the attic for a bit to take care of it before he finally went to bed.
The last thing Harry needed was the press finding out what he was up to, and broadcasting the entire thing to the Ministry and everyone else.
“I suppose. Although it’s frequently me doing the sorting, isn't it?”
“I didn’t fucking start this. You did.”
Harry’d thought to ask again about the shared magic what’s-it Draco was so reluctant to talk about, but he held back.
“Sorry about all this…it was the easiest way for me to fit you in.”
“Not yet then.” Draco shifted up to press into a kiss, his tongue teasing distractingly where Harry was just biting.
"I'm not suggesting the Ministry do anything at all. In fact I’m fairly positive anything of the sort would break most of the International Secrecy Codes. It wouldn’t be easy."
Even in a room so unnaturally cold, Harry’s robes suddenly felt much too heavy, and he hurried to shrug out of them. He had to focus just to breathe evenly as Malfoy stepped close enough to hook narrow fingers into the waistband of Harry’s trousers, playing at the buttons there.
Rubbing against his thigh, Draco panted a quiet moan. “Don’t stop.”
“No Elves to take your coat, Malfoy?”
“Hermione was always better at the Undetectables but I could give it a shot,” he considered. “Unless you think you—”
“So that I can fix your face, Potter. This way.”
“I know I was hateful.” Draco cut him off sharply, not quite meeting Harry’s eye. “Only I thought I was right. My father, my aunt—really, everyone I had ever respected or loved thought you all disgustingly naïve and stupid, and I believed them.”
“Why not?” he contested.
“It’s the right way… just watch your step.”
Harry snorted, heading for the door. “I’ll be quick.”
As he had been directed, he kept on until he’d found the third office down on the left side of the hall. The door was already cracked, so he knocked lightly on its open doorway instead.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
doing all month.
“They’re push lights, and dry erase markers.”
Probably it was good for him to have something new to focus on. At least now he wasn’t thinking about how soft Malfoy’s hair was, or what he looked like when he—
There were also very real reasons not to forgive Draco.
“Fucking Merlin, it’s almost as if you want us to fail.”
But he had to abandon all hope of charming him back into bed when Draco stepped just out of reach.
“Right yeah, but it’s definitely the right thing to do. People really need the help, and the Dementors are only getting worse.”
“Oh, well you’ll be wanting Cassie, love. She’ll be at the back offices this time of day.”
He only needed to give him a bit of lift and Gordon took off at top speed, out through the corridor’s open window into a greyish morning sky.
He wanted to throttle him for his attitude, but ultimately Malfoy’s point had sticking power. Helping Muggles with magical solutions would generate an enormous amount of red-tape and headaches for him at best, at worst he could wind up jobless, or even arrested himself.
Harry was just packing up what had survived of the objects he brought with him when a throat cleared quietly behind him.
“I’m sure you could do it just as well again. Better, even.”
Harry tried not to make a face. “Sounds lovely.”
“Just fuck me, Potter—however you like.”
“Perfect, then.” Harry was kind of surprised it could be that easy. And a bit suspicious. “And that won’t be a bother to the people who actually should be there?”
“How do we subtly cast a Patronus?”
“There was nothing they did for us that I can’t do with an enchanted mop, a recipe spell or a proper
He searched out Draco’s lips again to kiss him more slowly, anything to pull focus off the tight grip stealing his senses.
There on his knees, Harry had the best view he could possibly imagine seeing this from.
When he let her in to perch on a stand by the wardrobe, Malfoy’s owl hooted at him perfunctorily and presented her perfectly manicured talons for Harry to remove the attached message.
Finally giving in to his fight with gravity Harry let himself fall back, head finding a spot pillowed somewhere beside the vicinity of Malfoy’s hip. If there were any complaints to be had, Malfoy didn’t voice them, and as they fell into silence, both men seemed to find some contenting distraction in the vast carpet of stars above them. Harry was half off the lounge, but it was comfortable enough.
“Right, no. Not the naughtiness in school bit. I meant, does he expect you to do the same? Get married and…carry on the family name, or whatever.”
Harry spent most of Thursday throwing himself into planting a number of herbs and potions ingredients in his pitifully small garden, and trying not to dwell overly on his problems.
Harry laughed, though the sound was strange and hollow to his ears.
His eyes had to adjust to the dim inside-light before Harry spotted Hagrid sat in his chair, wrapped in a quilt, and soundly asleep. He looked peaceful at rest, despite the ear-ringing snores.
“That’d be perfect actually, I’m awfully sore—Puddlemere’s new beaters have scary-good aim.”
Ginny was smiling down at her bag as she picked it up, and pulling out her wand to Disapparate.
They lost the evenness of their rhythm to mounting lust. Harry knew by the strained stuttered pitch of his moan how close he was, thrusting faster through a volatile ache in his own prick to push him there.
“If, by some fucking miracle, we make it through the rest of this weekend without reverting back to totally hating each other, then I might reconsider accepting the favour. Eventually.”
“I think it’s adequate. A decent option...and the only one at the moment.” Draco paused to look over the map Cassie gave them. “There is the one more place to look at if you’d like to—”
Grateful for the change of subject, Harry launched into a summary of the latest office politics and gossip for the last bit of their walk to the house.
, Potter?”
If he was pretty enough, perhaps someone would want him for a paperweight.
“Sorry, I wasn’t thinking. I didn’t mean to bring up bad memories.” Harry chewed his lip anxiously.
“Potter, aren’t you in a hurry?” Draco complained impatiently.
“You as well,” he muttered, his frown oddly ambiguous. “Good evening, Potter.”
He felt a catch in Draco’s breathing when he nudged the tip of his nose along the shell of his ear, getting a bit lost in the increasingly familiar scent of coconut and something spiced, so much stronger when they were this close. Harry could also feel the growing tension in Draco when he trailed his palm down Draco’s chest to the top of his trousers.
In fairness, he didn’t really know why Malfoy agreed to help him; though he doubted very much it was only out of the goodness of his heart. It hadn’t escaped Harry’s notice that Malfoy might have an ulterior motive, he just couldn’t sort out what it could be.
Draco needed a moment to collect himself, and he carefully tucked his important bits back into his pants before he got around to addressing the question.
Draco was clearly offended.
When Harry finally knocked on Hagrid’s door there was no answer, save Fang’s rumbling barks, and rather than wait Harry pushed the door open to greet him.
“It would take more time, but obviously we’re having to develop highly specialised spells either way. I’ll already be adapting most of them from their original purposes—in this case, the theory is out there to study. To master it will take time…but I don’t think ‘impossible’ or even ‘hopeless’ are the right words.”
“Hello? Sorry to interrupt—I was told out front that you might be able to help me with some information.” He poked his head through the crack in the door a bit awkwardly. “I’m Harry, by the way.”
Harry hesitated, but decided to be honest. “I’ve got the house to myself tonight…I was planning to attempt properly repainting the attic.”
Harry yawned just thinking about it all, but Draco was waiting for a reply.
He did not think very hard about reaching out to run his fingers curiously down the length of it. He told himself he was only testing his sensing skills, searching for any hint of magic beneath the surface, a trace of the evil that once had been. Obviously or not, there was nothing left to sense, only the fading ghosts of a lubrication charm, and whatever spell Malfoy used on his hair to make it so shiny.
“Sorry, yeah.” Shrugging easily, Harry didn’t press at the obvious sore spot he’d just accidentally hit. If Ron wanted to talk about it, he surely would—at the moment it seemed he wanted to fly off his frustration.
“No one knows. No one can.”
“A bit,” he hedged.
“I really wouldn’t mind.”
Draco slipped around to face him, his lips only just brushing Harry’s, barely any contact at all—beyond the captivating lock of their eyes.
While Draco whispered a spell to prepare himself, the tip of Harry’s cock brushed between pale thighs, and then Harry slid himself up between Draco’s arsecheeks in a slow tease. When Draco tried pushing back on him properly, Harry rather enjoyed playing with him—after all of the teasing Draco had done the last time.
Draco went on riding him a bit longer yet, trailing rather sticky fingers up to trace over Harry’s lips.
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco intoned at his ear. “I know what you need.”
“I’m not saying no or anything, but I’ve got to be honest with you, I might be too tired for thrusting.”
“I don’t mind…it was only an observation,” Draco clarified drowsily.
“I suppose that’s your job, isn’t it?”
his wand as the torches within lit themselves with sapphire flames. As Malfoy pulled the door closed behind them, Harry immediately shut his eyes to prepare for the inevitable disorientation he knew was coming when the walls started spinning all around them.
Given their history, he supposed she had good reason to be wary.
“Careful. Wouldn’t want to go toppling off into the hedges now, would we?”
. S-slow down.”
“There might be a way.”
All Harry really wanted then was sleep, but inevitably they stayed too late—chatting and drinking—and would surely be miserable the next day. Harry and Ginny had said their goodbyes—hugs and handshakes all around, and took the Floo from The Hog’s Head home.
“This might be a bad time,” Harry submitted hesitantly. “But d’you think you could feed me again?”
When Draco flicked the tip of his wand, his question vanished, and Harry followed suit.
“Ah yes. Ironically I’ve got my own hideous scar now.”
“I can’t see why not. It’s secure and I’ve got the room to do it. We’ll need the tents.”
That sneer itched under Harry’s patience, but he wasn’t there to argue with Malfoy about not being an utter twat. Aberforth had surely seen more intimidating clientele by far, although Harry wasn’t sure it was the best idea for Malfoy to go around insulting the people preparing his drinks.
Caught just as deep in the snare of his own lust, Harry naturally pressed back. His tightness only barely gave way—but just enough for a final burst of Draco’s heat to get inside—and then Harry was coming very suddenly too, adding to the mirror’s sticky mess.
Harry’s cock twitched warningly as he went on intoning low in Draco’s ear. “Two days, then we’ll fuck your sheets filthy too.”
Setting his book aside, Harry watched the other man a little more lingeringly than necessary before he went for the bag he’d brought with him, pulling out a small collection of things and laying them out randomly on Draco’s desk.
hard and he could feel the heat of Draco’s mouth, so close and yet not where he needed it to be.
“Really well…” Harry nosed in to nip rather possessively at his throat. “I also wanted to see how you were getting along with the intent problems.”
There was that infuriating smirk again, like Malfoy knew a big secret he was deliberately keeping from Harry. “Come here then. You won’t have to do that.”
“It’s a matter of paring down to the essentials.”
Harry pushed up to his palms for more thrusting momentum, his breathing growing more uneven with each penetrating press.
Having recently resigned himself to the reality that he actually quite liked when Draco was being an arsehole sometimes, Harry couldn’t fully hide his smile as he rushed to catch up. Although he missed his trainers again, doing his best not to fall flat on his face trying to run through the rain in smart shoes.
“Wondering about what, exactly? If I might’ve change sides before the end of the war? If we would’ve fucked sooner? I doubt it. You hated me.”
“Did you get it all?”
"So not money, no. But why not comfort? A home? The smallest wizard tent could house a family of eight in a pinch."
“Sorry for your luck mate, but I wouldn’t volunteer to work with a toff like Malfoy if you paid me a whole dragon’s hoard of galleons for it,” Ron dismissed. “How’re things at the Ministry then?”
Harry sighed frustratedly.
“What’s left to do tonight then?” Harry asked a bit tiredly.
They were all rather relieved when George passed a flask down the line and everyone indulged in a sip—even Hermione, who Harry noted looked very tired. He would need to ask her later how her work was coming along.
Harry dropped down on a long bench. “Er. Not sure if I’ve ever had it before.”
Harry frowned thoughtfully, and stood to stretch. They had been working for quite a while now, and his brain needed a bit of a break.
Hadn’t he already said that? As they entered the lift, the flush of intoxication staining Malfoy’s cheeks became harder to miss, and Harry wondered if he looked just as flustered.
“I remember.” The green of Harry’s eyes shone rather intensely amused—and a little naughty.
“If I did, no one told me what I was eating.”
He felt a strange flash of nerves when she joined them, looking as elegant as she ever did, in an appropriately-festive gold dress. Of course, Harry knew from experience any combination of Malfoys and Weasleys was a precarious tinderbox of eggshells, even in peacetime. On the other hand, he’d been talking to Malfoy for quite a while by then, and hadn’t felt the urge to strangle him even once.
“Doesn’t sound so bad.”
Harry nodded, and scribbled down the chapter number and book name as Draco went on.
Malfoy arched a slow eyebrow at him, and with a lazy wave of his wand, the tent removed itself from Harry’s hands and began erecting itself.
“Just don’t sit on my robes, doubtless they’re worth more than your house.”
Unable to argue with anything Draco had just accused him of, he lashed out instead.
“Hasn’t stopped you spending time with me, has it? If I’m wrong, tell me how you really feel about it.”
“Satisfied?”
While he waited for an answer, Harry finally received his drink, but his question had prompted a look of faint trauma to overtake Lawrence’s otherwise churlish expression, at which point he proceeded to bequeath a lesson.
“Good afternoon, Potter.”
Harry slipped out his wand, tapped his own board, and beneath Draco’s careful script, Harry’s unruly scrawl spelled out:
Draco’s hips faltered beneath him when Harry held steady, and Draco’s cock twitched for him again. Harry watched it almost hungrily as he curved over Draco to thrust roughly and press until he could watch Draco’s cock leak another few drops down his shaft.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Alright?” Ginny checked, peeking her head through the archway.
Though he needn’t’ve worried on it now.
with you. You’re gay. Or…something near enough to it.”
“G’night,” he whispered back.
Groaning deeply, Harry tugged his fingers out and smacked firm at his arse again. Draco cried out loud, working back on his hands and knees toward the edge of the bed with a pointed lock of silver on green.
“Oh—sorry, I thought I’d told you—she’s put together a small map for us. I was thinking I might go and have a look at them soon, in person…”
“Only because you’ve asked so nicely,” Harry snarked back, but had already started working his mouth exploringly down again—
“I am. We’ll also need to seriously consider how we’re planning to shield it all from the powers that be—Wizard and Muggle. That is probably the most pressing thing I haven’t fully sorted yet. There are all sorts of Muggle-deterring spells, but that won’t do us any good if Muggles are meant to be living there.”
Standing together in a drizzly alley as the rain patted down steady on the umbrella over them, Harry very nearly kissed him when Draco finally did look at him again. He felt the draw of it, and was sure Draco saw the way he couldn’t keep from staring at his lips but—
With an extremely tight moan, Harry risked shoving deeper for several thrusts as a devastating ecstasy found his break point, flooding hot from his bollocks to the tip of his cock. Easing out slowly as he came, a final bolt of heat moved through him as Harry stroked to urge his last drops over the already sticky centre of Draco’s arse.
Malfoy waited for him to open his eyes before taking in the tip of his cock for his tongue to roll against, and Harry discovered it would not be easy to stay upright. His knees already felt weak, and that was before Malfoy started teasing him to the point he felt like he had to thrust in a little deeper.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“You’re sure? I promise I’ll only be an hour, or so, it’s just—”
Draco’s narrow fingers dug into his shoulders and Harry grabbed at his arse possessively, but he was still thinking about what happened when it was over. He was thinking about that moment when he had to go back home, and Draco told him to have a good evening, and he went back to an empty house, and thought about what a horrible person he was being.
“I know, I—well I stopped in for some food and had a drink at the pub and then I was there for a while and—”
The line of Draco’s shoulders stiffened, and Harry was treated to a nasty sneer he had not seen properly in years.
“Apparently I don’t rate high enough for fancy chairs.” Harry was amused, despite himself.
Internally, some part of him was likely mortified at the inanity of the statement, but the firewhisky helped Harry very much not to care.
Harry flushed, and though he wanted to, couldn’t deny that he’d been jealous, or that he was surely the reason Draco wasn’t presently back in his library working on the spellcraft.
“Twice, actually.”
In Harry’s wandlight Malfoy’s expression could only be called pure curiosity. It wasn’t a side of him Harry recalled ever seeing before, but he couldn’t shake the feeling their plan was rather unwise. He was not an Unspeakable, and he did not have a good excuse prepared should anyone ask what he was doing wandering drunk through some of the Ministry’s most closely guarded secrets with Draco Malfoy.
Like the bit where he admitted to Draco that he was having a difficult time with the cheating—and the part where Draco had shrugged it off like it was nothing at all for him to be concerned about.
Pushing himself up, Draco went thoughtful a moment before he shrugged.
Draco had a lot of opinions, and Harry took them into consideration, but he had a few opinions of his own. They certainly didn’t agree on everything, not by a long shot—but they managed to reach some sort of compromise most of the time.
“There’s plenty of room,” Draco drawled.
He pushed the stack of books at Harry, as if bequeathing ownership of the problem to him again—but Harry hadn’t missed the number of times Malfoy just said ‘we’ like this was a project he intended on seeing through.
Draco hummed low and open-mouthed against his lips when Harry pressed his tongue in to taste and explore, lost in how much he had missed the taste of him since last Saturday. He’d gone over a month that summer without seeing him, and yet suddenly a week felt too long.
“I suppose not,” Harry agreed, an affectionate quirk to his smile at the both of them.
She opened one toward the bottom, full of several flat stacks of folders that had just enough clearance for the dome of the light, and they tried it there. It was faint, but when the light was on it was visible from the outside—and Cassie promised to check it on occasion as well.
Rather than argue, he ignored everything else to sit down in the chair and pull Draco close enough to eagerly draw the softness of his cock past his lips. As he went about determinedly sucking off every bit of lingering come, Draco moaned darkly, shuddering in the overload, but pressing deeper anyway.
“Come here, then. You have far too many clothes on.”
“Just a few blocks up this way.”
“Dracogod
He knew he ought to have been completely exhausted, they hadn’t napped for very long at all, but their excursion in the shower had been oddly energizing, and Harry made pretty good progress whilst Draco was gone.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
The thought had no sooner crossed his mind than Draco was slipping his arms around Harry’s middle beneath his robes, catching hold of his arse, and pulling him very much closer.
“Not long. It’s still quite early.”
Harry snorted and winced simultaneously at the thought of them exploding at all. “Suppose that’s something to be thankful for?”
Harry may have grumbled a bit, but he acquiesced, and went off to find himself a small tumbler of firewhisky.
“You want—
Harry sighed quiet relief. “Hoped you’d say that—think I fell asleep halfway through casting this last one. I’m shocked it hasn’t come out upside-down or something.”
“Harry—thank fuck, mate!” Ron immediately dragged him into a hug that was more akin to throwing himself into Harry’s side.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It didn’t matter how many times Harry heard him say the word, it sent an ache through his cock every time.
The gasped incoherence just followed Draco’s tensing arch, flooding his throat with seed in several steady shots.
Seated on a spindly wooden bench in his attic to read it, Harry Potter was smiling—try as he might to stifle it.
“I can’t see why it wouldn’t be.”
Harry didn’t have it in him to refuse an offer like that. Draco shrugged his robes off, tossing them over the back of a chair and Harry followed suit.
Even as he sunk in he tried to work his jeans further down before he picked up thrusting properly hard and—as Draco requested—quick.
Harry hummed, pressing more at the taut ring of his arse, wetly prodding for Draco to relax open for him, so that he might carefully slide his middle finger in, slow and tight. He whimpered as Harry curled to touch at his sweet spot, and then he was whining even more.
Harry pulled back a bit to quirk an eyebrow at him. “Your positively thriving social life?”
“Is it bigger now do you think?”
Thankfully, thus far Draco hadn’t voiced any objections to Harry’s décor choices, but he wasn’t exactly voicing his approval either.
“Alright, Potter? Ready for your first day of Field Training, I hope!”
An underlying lust lurked in the dark amusement of Draco’s answering laugh, and it had a rising effect on Harry’s cock.
Probably he ought to have objected further, but he couldn’t bring himself to—not as Draco slowly surrounded him in searingly sinful slickness, suckling hot on his cock and rubbing at the swell of his bollocks still trapped in his pants.
“—I’m taking every precaution. He’s helping me with some spellwork, the research and a few other things.”
Harry wanted to kiss him all over again, and his stomach flipped with nervous anticipation—but he resisted the urge. He really did need to go.
“Usually,” Draco intoned without hesitation, nicking the glass back for his own substantial sip.
On Wednesday he spent his entire day at his cubicle, revising essays for his classes. Which was when he discovered that the notes on Poisons and Antidotes Draco had written were pretty invaluable. They were clear and concise, illuminating a few sections of his essay where whatever Harry had written was completely wrong.
Blaise shot him an odd look before swiftly disappearing into the bedroom.
It was before he’d ever had a reason to meet Andromeda as well, when she was only a singed-off name in gold thread under a black scorch-mark, and whatever vague notion he’d had of what Tonks’ mum might be like. He was brought out of the memory of it when Draco started talking again, determinedly looking at his menu rather than at Harry.
“Arsehole,” Harry muttered.
“I’ve got a few more than just the one now, if it makes you feel any better,” Harry offered.
