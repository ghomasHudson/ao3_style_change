. She apparently asked them not to tell me because she wanted to see me. She missed me – as a friend, she made it clear – and wanted to remain friends but that I kept avoiding her.
‘Do you? Really?’ I whisper back, scared he will think about it more, deciding that no, not really, running away, never seeing him again.
‘Look! Harry! Cool right?’ Teddy screams from above on his broom. He’s quite good on it, I must say. I made sure there were safety charms set on it on top of the ones it already came with. He’s about four meters high and thank god it cannot fly any higher because Teddy would definitely try.
‘But you wanted me to tell you what happened and I am here and ready.’ She sits next to Blaise and they both stare at me.
He came on time to the designated spot this morning, he didn’t say a word and touched the portkey when it struck exactly four in the morning. We landed in the safe house where the rest of the team was already stationed.
'Okay now, mate. No one's taking your love away,' I say and Ron throws a peanut at my head. Ginny and I laugh, Ron scowls.
'Fuck me now.' He's so blunt sometimes, when he wants something he just says it. And I'm so in love I give him everything.
...I jerk awake in the middle of the night, my head on his chest and our legs intertwined. I watch him sleep, breathing in and out.
I am warm and in a good mood in no time. I try to talk to everyone, we sit in groups, chatting and drinking and eating. It's nice.
‘You help us lot more than our lab does. Why not? I’ll talk to Kingsley about it,’ he shrugs like it’s no big deal.
and I jumped in, said it was fine, laughed, a bit mad, wished him a good evening and left, Parkinson was standing outside, I said goodbye to her too, she said goodnight and I disapparated right on the spot.
He throws them on his chair and pushes his sleeves up. He’s wearing that light blue shirt Harry can’t stand because it makes his eyes glow or something. Harry can see the sweat under his arm when he rakes his hand through his hair. He would like to just go over and push his nose into it, as strange as that might sound.
'As I was saying, I was thinking, Clo and Bono adore each other so much that it breaks my heart when they're apart.'
So, I said that I was just trying to make Malfoy mad, I apologised and I said I would also apologise to Malfoy.
I don’t know what just happened. I was having a perfectly fine afternoon and now in two weeks I’ll get all sweaty playing quidditch with all the Weasleys imaginable and Potter? I think not.
He keens when he slips out and starts caressing Harry’s back and lower, until he reaches his hole where the cum is already spilling out. “Did you?” he asks, licking Harry’s skin.
'And I cannot stand that aftershave you started using, I hate it, I hate it! I hope you are happy, you know it all now. Fuck!'
She laughs and oh, how it grates on his nerves. “He does, of course. He’s very nice. But you can show me something too.”
'What is with you? You're constantly mad. About every fucking little thing, you just want to argue. What's going on?'
Robards called me in today to send me to another abroad assignment, two days, but at least this time with Jonson, in Switzerland, so it’s fine.
“That’s great,” he smiles, and he thinks he doesn’t quite manage it when Malfoy frowns at him. “We were just heading out to lunch, so,” Harry points to Ron.
When I was leaving, I apparated in front of his gate and could see in the distance that the lights were on downstairs and almost reverted back to dismantling the wards to enter the grounds. But I didn’t.
After three long, agonising weeks, it’s almost done and over with and Harry feels an immense relieve. She is leaving tonight, and Harry cannot wait.
Then I waited outside until he closed. He saw me and exhaled a long-suffering sigh. I thanked him again and walked with him to the corner he’d usually disapparate from, but he kept on walking.
“Potter, let me introduce you to our new colleague, Coraline Auclair. She’s the temporary exchange for Craft,” Malfoy smiles down at her, and she extends her hand towards Harry. Harry shakes it, thinking she’s just Malfoy’s type. Short, long brown hair and blue eyes.
‘Hey, Malfoy!’ he looks at me, his hair now pale blond and his face a weird, distorted mix. ‘Good job!’
'But I want you to complain and of course we will still argue. About work or us or this place. I don't want us to lie to each other.'
‘Darling, welcome! Come in, come in,’ my mother greets me and I am sure I know what this visit is about. But why? New year just started, why can’t everyone just take a break for a second?
'Appropriately, of course. And then, when the reception is over and we will be left alone, we'll do all sorts of inappropriate things.'
First work - the paperwork is seriously getting ridiculous -, Malfoy – another complaint, the same thing, and he keeps grating on my nerves and this time he even
Blaise thinks and then answers: ‘No, I liked him. We weren’t best of friends, but he was tolerable.’
‘What?’ I jump in, all pretence forgotten, and all the blood rushes to my face. ‘You must have heard wrong, I would never… Blaise, did I really say it?’
I can’t believe in a week, my life will be endangered, and my girlfriend and friends are going about their lives like nothing’s happening. I don’t care what they say, I am right about this and it will serve them right if I'll come back damaged.
Thursday, I was babysitting Teddy and left there at 10pm and still went to the Manor and still kissed him before he pulled away.
‘You were so good,’ Pansy grabs her and then murmurs something in her ear. I take my leave to get mother and go home. The match is over so I don’t see a reason to socialize any longer.
When we finish, I pant, looking at the ceiling, my fingers still gripping his thigh and waist. When I can finally catch my breath, I release my hold on him and lie limp underneath.
‘Are you going to write to him or call to see what happened? I mean, that, for me, would be very important. What if…’ Pansy doesn’t finish her definitely atrocious thought because I cut in.
‘God. Let’s go,’ he exhales, pulling me behind him. I follow, close to his back. I kiss his nape and he laughs. He takes me into his bedroom, closes the door and watches me, leaning against it.
‘Are you going around and gossiping to everyone about my failed relationship? Why did you tell Lovegood?’
He nods again when Malfoy leaves and Harry hears his retreating steps. He has no idea what he just agreed to.
He already came to terms with it couple weeks back. No matter how hard he tried to suppress it and find a cure, it persisted.
“If it’s so horrid, maybe you can do all the paperwork from now on. I know how you just love doing it.”
I’m just thinking about leaving without telling anyone – I’m so completely weirded out – when Teddy shouts from his room to ‘come and bring me a piece of pie, please’.
“How very forward, Potter,” Malfoy smirks but does as asked. Even though it’s not far, they stop every two seconds to continue kissing and touching.
We finish setting up the table and Andromeda goes outside to fetch Teddy when I hear a Floo in the sitting room. There are four plates on the table.
I nod. 'It was... you've been gone for a month and we had this party. I got drunk because... and she was there, kept... talking to me, and laughing and... and I went with her.'
After some time of nothing she takes my hand and holds it, her thumb making circles on my skin. I look down and I wish it was someone else’s hand and just like that the stupid tears start rolling down my face. She doesn’t say anything, her fingers tighten their hold.
'No it's not. You're still young and you can work for yourself or something. You have choices, so many of them.'
We met yesterday evening as well. I suggested it and he said he was free and so I thought we could go flying or something. We didn’t. Not that I didn’t like what we did, this time on his fancy blue sofa, where, for the first time in my life, I had a cock in my mouth. In fact, I liked it very much.
‘Is that…’ Ron starts but Hermione interrupts him, putting her hand on my wrist. ‘Harry, are you sure about this? You do remember how it was when you broke up, don’t you?’
Am I an asshole? I don’t think so, I’m just doing what’s right and he behaves very suspiciously, with all the straight posture and that gleaming (slightly wavy) hair of his and those sneers and smirks… he’s odd and suspicious and a Death Eater and I am doing the right thing!
She showers, I am too lazy so I stay in bed, drifting off to sleep. When she comes back she curls around my back, smelling like honey.
He just stands there for a moment, looking at me with the sneer still on until finally, he grabs my forearm and I turn on the spot with him right beside me.
“I did not sleep with her, you slow idiot. And I didn’t want her to sleep with you either. There you have it. Hope you have a good night, Potter.” He rushes away from Harry in a strop.
‘Oh god, thank you,’ she says and laughs. ‘I must be drunk!’ That’s when Potter appears out of nowhere and glares at my hand still on her arm.
'Yeah, okay, maybe you will but if you won't? You will be pathetic... good crup. Again? Okay, catch!'
'I don't but he asked very nicely and I was too drunk and said yes, so. I am polite and am not going to cancel last minute.'
Just as yesterday, I waited until he closed, he didn’t stop for a meal, so I asked if he wanted a drink, he made a strange face but said
He stares at me, incredulous. ‘You do realise I have to work, right? I can’t just go, gallivanting through Berlin whenever you set your mind on it.’
Harry’s being dismissed and it’s so not how he imagined things going when Malfoy kissed him back. “All right. Good night, then. And sorry, for, well, you know.”
‘What?’ he blinks several times and looks down at his watch. ‘It’s seven. Are you joking? I only slept for three hours.’ He lays back down and turns his back to me. ‘Go away.’
I can't help myself though, I know there will be no embrace, no sweet whispers in my ear, no kisses, but I still try. I kiss his shoulder, the closest part of him I can get to, just a brush of lips and he's sitting up.
, looked around more, laughed when he found a shelf dedicated to only Quidditch books, magazines and memorabilia with
Pathetic. At one point I really thought he would drag me with him. We would get back together and...
‘Hello Harry. You can put the bottle on the table, dear,’ says Andromeda as she pushes Teddy inside.
'Is that why you were huddled with Weasley all evening? Talking to him about things you can't talk to me about? Or where you just whining to him how depressed and pathetic you think I am?'
‘Yes, I really did. Do you think we could talk more about it? I don’t think I can focus very much right now, I am a little tipsy,’ she giggles.
She laughs at this, like it’s the funniest shit she ever heard. ‘Yes, you can buy me a drink, Malfoy, thanks. Are you alone here? Would you like to join us?‘
‘Yes. She had to work this evening, unfortunately. But she told me she ordered a cake for her work party?’
‘It really is, when you give them,’ he answers and bites into the cherry muffin, chewing noisily. ‘But maybe you can go and buy some yourself, hm?’
It takes some time until it adjusts and he’s able to determine that he’s in a sterile smelling room of St. Mungo’s.
‘Do you? Then why do I need to be present?’ His fist hits the desk and his mouth flattens in a thin line.
and so I did and that’s something I need to get used to, I guess. He slid down to the floor, pushed me on my back on the carpet and he sucked me too and oh my god, I missed it. It was so good I barely managed to stop myself from thrusting up, but he was holding me down with his arm on my hips. I watched him. I think he’s never done it before, also. I didn’t ask of course, it just looked like it to me. Made me feel better about myself, too.
‘Yes, Potter,' he snaps, 'my apologies if it offends you. Believe me, if I’d knew you’d be here, I wouldn’t come.’ He hits me with his elbow - judging by its sharpness, .
He even came to mine when I asked him, twice. And every time it ended in bed, on a sofa, on a floor, and once in a chair in my kitchen.
‘You!’ he yells and tries to shove me off. ‘You think you can get away with everything, our Saviour, don’t you?’ I push harder and his head hits the tree trunk. But it is still not enough for Malfoy who wheezes but still manages to kick me in my shin.
My mouth is on hers the whole time, not really kissing, touching lips and tongues, moaning and whispering dirty things to each other until I come inside her, shaking and groaning.
I wish I’d feel like suffocating because I’m uncomfortable, pinned down by another warm body. But I’m suffocating because I vaguely remember the things I said and revealed.
'I don't care anymore. I'll go back, work, be out of your hair for most of the day and won't be wasting my days away.'
We're silent while there's noise all around us. He drinks his coffee, finishes and then slumps back in his chair.
He guides himself to Harry’s entrance and starts pushing in while their mouths remain slotted together in an open-mouthed kiss.
Whatever. If it will result in solving the case, then it’s worth withstanding Malfoy’s ire and presence. I hope.
He stands there for a second until it’s clear I won’t be saying or confirming anything, then he strides out of the room, keeping the door wide open.
‘Thank you, I’ll think about it. So far I am satisfied with my muggle atrocities, as they say at home.’ She slowly picks up a biscuit from a plate and dunks it in her tea.
We go the Burrow for a family dinner and Ginny makes the great announcement at the table, dramatic as ever. No one bats an eye, Ginny always does this with every relationship. She says it’s because the more obnoxious she is, the less people want to hear about it and ask questions. Which, of course, does not apply to Molly, who asks all the questions on behalf of everyone.
Harry’s frown deepens. He wants to comment but Malfoy speaks up again. “I just want to go home, shower and sleep this fucking night away.”
Harry glares at him, or so he hopes. His eyes still sting, maybe it’s just a weird grimace. “What’s going on?”
‘Would you like to leave?’ I look at the man whispering in my ear. So handsome. Andrew, the man I am fucking tonight because I need a rest from the week from hell. Plus, I don’t care, I tell the voice in my head that is ready to reprimand me and is very similar to Hermione’s.
‘You stop it, Potter! This is all you fault! If I will get just one bruise!’ He threatens but it falls flat.
‘Give us the box!’ one yells. I send Incarcerous his way, but he dodges and it seems like he sends Bombarda my way. I use a shield and I bristle as his curse hits with quite some strength.
We engaged in the most awful small talk of humankind. It probably was only about four minutes of torture but to me, it seemed like forever, I hate small talk. I was scared that if I would ask some real questions, he would just disappear, and then my chances of learning something about his devious pursuits would diminish. So, I suffered until he sighed, said
Pansy splutters but I have to agree with Blaise. ‘That’s seriously it? Pansy, I was literally just about to come,’ cue Blaise’s groan, ‘when your owl almost broke the window.’
‘Really?’ he asks, grinning. ‘Can it be the normal one, not the big for kids? Can it be gold?’ He grabs my sleeve and pulls me inside the shop. He keeps chattering and once we’re inside he’s carefully considering each snitch on display. Once he points at his favourite one and the shop keeper gives it to him, he smiles, his eyes sparkle and he holds it close to his scrunched up nose, inspecting it and finally nodding contently and putting it in his pocket. ‘Thank you Draco,’ he smirks. ‘Can we also get ice cream now?’
He feels the sensation as Malfoy whispers several incantations, loosely holding his wand and then discarding it again.
She looks at me, highly unimpressed. ‘You said Blaise’s attorney approved it. And I don’t see anything wrong,’ she flips through the pages again, ‘they guarantee your safety. Do you know what would happen if they let any harm come to you or Merlin forbid, if they let you die?’
'I don't know. You have more experience with these things than I do and based on that I think it's very possible.'
This week, I only saw Malfoy once, when I was walking home on Thursday. True, I didn’t have to go through Knockturn, but some habits die hard. I was passing his shop, so I looked inside through a window and he was sitting behind a counter, perusing through some book, his chin propped on his palm, eyes down. His hair was falling over his forehead and had an orange hue to it, probably because of the light inside or something else stupid. He looked up and saw me and I kept staring like an idiot for good five seconds as his face changed from calm to bemused and scowling until he got up and I bolted.
She natters away, at this point to herself. Harry just hums here and there, happy the water boils magically and pours itself just as fast into the cups.
‘Of course, I don’t want you to fall asleep somewhere in a ditch,’ I say as I sit at the table as he grumbles and makes his coffee. ‘No thank you, I already had one,’ I say as his sits down and drinks it, not asking if I wanted one too.
‘Okay. Then really, seven minutes, boys. Should I sing to you to release that none sexual tension?’ Luna asks.
I didn’t enter the grounds today because I remembered I promised to babysit Teddy from 5pm and was an hour late. I apparated straight to Andromeda’s, apologising profusely. She was a little miffed, understandably so, so she greeted me in the doorway and left.
His hair is longer than last time. He's got a beard again. He's wearing jeans and I want to go and bury my face in his hair. I want to know if he smells the same.
‘Okay. How then?’ I don’t let him answer when I slide my tongue in his mouth, savouring his taste, his heat and gasps.
She sees me but looks at Potter who’s sitting on the armrest of the sofa. ‘Be a darling, Harry, and give this to Draco.’
I take the pie from the oven and place it in the middle of a table. I think mother is now peacefully sleeping, no dreams, no emotions, in a void, it was one of those days for her. ‘Yes, she still does. We used to have it every Sunday when I was younger. She just felt a little under the weather. Probably cold, I made her some Pepper-up.’
‘I will, but surely the teams have a cook, or a house elf. Right?’ He turns to Potter for confirmation.
It’s pretty hard to keep this diary consistent. I don’t think it needs to be, however, Hermione is of different opinion. Don’t care, I’ll write what I want and whenever I want.
Malfoy makes a quick work of his jeans and underwear and when their cocks brush together, it sends a jolt of pleasure through his whole body.
'You know...' he starts and I'm dreading what will come next. 'I almost wish you'd end up with her or something. Because then it wouldn't be my fault.'
I apparated from the toilet right in front of his gate, behind a bush on the side of it. I was crouching there for couple minutes until I heard a pop and watched him opening the gate, waving his wand after he closed it. I went home when he was inside.
Pansy huffs, her wand raised and pushes inside. ‘You utter imbecile!’ she hits me on the head. ‘We thought you were lying here, dead or possibly drunk! Why weren’t you answering our letters or calls?’ Towards the end her voice raises to dangerous levels.
Once the tour ends, I sit in one of the pews, looking at the altar. Potter takes the other side and we sit and look. I glance at him from time to time, he keeps turning his head this way and that, looking at people and the ceiling, looking everywhere.
I devour him. I push and pull and he goes. He gives back the same to me. He tugs my head back, deepens the kiss. I moan, shamelessly, paying it no mind. He pulls back, I guess to take a breath, silently opening his mouth but I chase after him, putting my lips back on his. He doesn’t protest, he lets me. And when he wants to take some air in his lungs yet again, I allow him the smallest inch of space between us before I kiss him anew.
Their tongues slide together, and Malfoy melts into him, opening his mouth wider and breathing faster. He slips his thigh between Harry’s and that’s when he realises that they’re standing outside and that it would be much nicer inside, maybe somewhere warm, in a bed.
I push away from the bar, aiming for the stairs. I wait for Malfoy when I reach the top, who is still slowly marching up. It’s less crowded and noisy here, but while waiting, I’ve already spotted two couples having sex, right there near the banister. When Malfoy finally arrives, his breathing heavy, he spots them too.
Only after, when I lie in bed and he’s putting his clothes back on, do I wonder whether Malfoy and the woman will be in the club the next time I’m there too.
‘Well then,’ I interrupt him, ‘plenty of time to go sight-seeing, don’t you think? We have about ten hours.’
Malfoy was not happy when I came around and I felt nauseous for some reason. I put the bust on his countertop, and he grimaced.
‘We can do it now,’ I try to shrug and at that there is cold air on my back and then he turns me on my back, positions himself and kisses me. So sweet and slow, morning breath and all and I don’t even care.
‘By the way,’ I start, ‘we have a meeting tomorrow, there was a new fraction detected in Aberdeen, we think it’s the same group. Will you be able to come?’
‘You are both so heartless! I am about to break up with my girlfriend and all you care about,’ she points her finger at Blaise, ‘is my negligible amount of tears I shed when you came and you,’ she points at me, ‘just want to get your dick wet!’
Sunday, there will be a party at the Burrow, Molly insisted. I just hope she won’t be there. What if I’d get drunk and cry
I was told keeping a diary or writing in general helps with emotions, dealing with them. Well, Hermione told me that. But I don’t know. So far, I still feel like
He frowns. ‘No, someone must come with you. Plus, of course, the charms.’ We stand there in silence for few beats. ‘Unfortunately, I cannot go with you, but you can wait until one of the others wakes up.’
'You should feel sorry, ashamed, a good person would.' There is no point. I know him well enough. We were friends. Somehow we found a way out of our school animosity into, at first, reluctant friendship. Then we started sleeping together. And then something happened and he started with the dark magic again, opened a shop under the pretence of honest business, selling objects of questionable origins... and the relationship changed, sour, even worse when we fucked. Worse because it was good and I wanted him, wanted to talk to him, kiss him, fuck him. I despise him for wanting all of it still, for disregarding everything I don't like about him.
“If you’d rather, you can fuck me. I like it.” He licks his neck as he says it and continues the torturous movement with his fist.
We made it to the park we ended up in the last time, sitting on a different bench, and he ran out of words, it seemed, because suddenly there was silence and I didn’t know for how long no one said anything until he exhaled noisily and said
'You... fine... god, yes... I got a month long... mhmm... holiday... and I... got you... I talked to... and you can... so we... oh fuck...'
'And I know, I know, we argue a lot, especially these last months but that doesn't mean I don't love you. I love you and I want to argue with you and then make up and do it all over again.'
‘Sorry, Draco. There is a charm on, so you can only open the closet after seven minutes. If you don’t want to make out then maybe you can talk. I noticed some tension between you two. Are you sure it’s not sexual? Because in my experience…’
So I speed up and try to catch the ball, Malfoy steers into my side and I almost loose my balance. ‘What the fuck Malfoy?!’ I scream and somehow the snitch is there and flying into my palm.
‘Potter,’ he says, ignoring my question again, ‘you have to tell them that I didn’t curse you. I keep being questioned, every day, the same thing all over again.’
Harry loses his glasses,  jumper and t-shirt, and Malfoy’s trousers are unzipped, and shirt untucked when they finally reach his room.
The smirk disappears and his fingers tighten around the door knob. 'By all means, Potter, you can fuck off.'
Potter sighs and presses his fingers on his temples. ‘Fine. I just wanted to know because you didn’t say or write anything. And I know how you love to write,’ he scowls.
Hermione’s birthday party went well, considering Ginny was invited as well. I managed to avoid her as much as possible, at least.
'Yes, whatever you want. Inside of me... inside of you, I don't care...' I kiss him and push down on his fingers, just twice. I take his wrist and withdraw it away.
. The truth is, I am not in love with her. Not any more. She broke my heart when she chose to leave to advance her career. I was happy for her, of course, but I hated her too. It was months until I managed to get over her. And now she’s here, beautiful as ever and I feel nothing. We slept together (I am still attracted to her) but do I really want to start over again? No, I don’t think so.
‘Of course. Let me pack you the pie and the tarte. There’s so many leftovers.’ Andromeda busies herself, so I also say goodbye to Teddy.
‘Ron told me he couldn’t say, George swore him to secrecy, apparently,’ she whispers and sips her wine.
‘You are so annoying Potter,’ he yells but then I can hear him catching up with me. ‘I’m hungry and this wall was a big let-down.’
Twinkle pops in, summons us to the dining room. I lead Astoria through the corridor, thinking if not married, we might end up being friends.
He sniggers. ‘Oh, so we’re calling it long-term now, having been together for, what, barely a month?’
‘Pleasure doing business with you,’ I say as I go for the box, thinking it was fairly easy and almost according to plan, now just to take it, put some tracking charms in place, even if wandlessly and get out of here.
I watch his face as he comes, eyes squeezed shut, mouth open on a silent scream and I halt all my movement, just looking.
After, my head rests on his stomach and his fingers play with my hair, stilling when he falls asleep.
'I did not. I tried to help and yeah, maybe I snapped from time to time, but not because I resent you! I hated I couldn't help you. But this is not a solution.'
Pansy comes, plops herself between us, almost in my lap. ‘Nothing darling. Astoria is lovely and if you love her that’s all that matters.’ I can see Blaise nodding but he’s still grinning like and idiot. ‘She’s for sure an upgrade from Tim.’
So, yesterday, I found a suspiciously looking locket, gave me flashbacks, so I decided Malfoy should take a look at it and brought it to him. He gave me a bemused, very reserved smile, cast few spells and announced it’s not cursed.
'And I'll try to be less sloppy. I know I'm messy and that you hate it. I will clean after myself more. And I will get rid of the aftershave if you hate it so much. If I'd knew I would do it sooner, but you never said anything.'
Once we’re finished and we’re outside, Malfoys walks immediately. We don’t talk, he walks in front of me, definitely not lost. After an hour we make it to the column, it’s tall and golden and Malfoy looks up and opens his mouth like he wants to say something but doesn’t and instead walks closer.
She sighs, again, and it sounds more exasperated the more she does it. ‘Draco. What could happen, honestly? Seems to me you will just sit next to some auror most of the time under a Polyjuice and Disillusionment and write notes.’
and so I told him I just came to look around. He said he would be closing soon, to go. I asked him whether he planted the potions into the old witch’s basement and he, of course, denied it. So I asked then, whether I can look around some more, maybe behind the curtain, the back room. He said no and to quote he also said ‘fuck off, Potter’. I left, but not without ‘I’m keeping my eye on you, Malfoy’ which I think was a
As soon as my fingers touch the wood, a shudder goes through me, some sort of yanking sensation and I feel the Polyjuice wearing of. I hear a gasp somewhere on the right. Jacoby is not smiling anymore and her fingers on the box tighten just as I am about to jerk it away from her. There are some shouts and people disapparating, and it’s all happening so quickly I barely notice someone is pointing a wand at me and yelling a spell in German.
'I had to review like hundred contracts the goblins stacked on my desk. I did not leave my chair for the whole day. Yours?'
However, he likes to torture himself. He’s barely been with him in a same room recently, always hanging out with her. Harry just wants to see him, even if it must be in her company.
“I was confused, and you were so close! I wasn’t thinking clearly.” Harry waves his hands wildly and some sparks fly out of his wand.
Just as I’m about to protest he can still have his tournament with Potter and all the Weasleys he wants, not needing me there, Potter speaks. ‘We are… friendly, we can definitely play quidditch together with whoever you want. Okay?’
Andromeda just hums. She knows I’m lying but doesn’t say anything else about it. ‘Shame Astoria couldn’t come either.’
I stand still, not moving an inch. It started settling in several hours ago, when they questioned me, when I was filling in the report, when I was eating my dinner. And now there's an urge to be rid of it, the emptiness of not feeling guilty.
Malfoy stands up and waves his hand vaguely in the direction of Harry’s shelves. “Look into that mess, I remember it was poking from somewhere.” He puts on his robes, waves his wand and all things on his desk put themselves in order. It even smells nicer there and Harry grits his teeth.
‘Stop whinging. It’s just seven minutes, I think you can make it,’ I tell him and try to adjust in the small space.
“What?” he turns to his desk. He wants to do at least a bit of work today and forget all about Malfoy.
“Yeah, hope to see you around,” Harry says at the end. He hopes he can finally leave, all niceties done and over with.
I thank Salazar when Teddy decides to jump between us and chatter, it serves as a very good diffuser of that loathing tension. Until he says: ‘You see? This is not so bad, and you always avoid each other. I like this so much more when both of you are here! We should play some quidditch when it’s nice outside, it’s more fun with more people playing. Oh! And we can invite aunt Ginny, uncle Ron and George, Victoire! Also the little kids, they can watch! I thought aunt Ginny was having me on when she told me you were friends now, I didn’t believe her, I said to her she must be off her rocker! But she wasn’t.’ He pauses and takes a breath. ‘Okay, can we go play Gobstones to my room?’ His eyes dart between us and I think I’m getting a headache. So much information in so little time.
It didn’t go on for as long as I’d want, he pulled away, blinked and then pecked me on the mouth, stood up, straightened his clothes, said goodnight and left while I was still sitting on the bench, completely out of my mind.
Their flat was full, some people I didn’t recognise but which allowed for a covert experiment: seeing whether there are some lingering effects from Malfoy’s deviousness. And sure enough, there were.
The man takes them and passes it to the other man toweing on his right. Then he points his wand at us and before I can even say a word, he’s lowering it back down. I only feel light air twirl around me for a second. I don’t think it was anything malicious, so I don’t comment.
When Harry comes to, it’s with his head on Malfoy’s chest and a leg thrown over his hips. His spine tingles and he’s warm under the covers. There are fingers in his hair, carding through them. Malfoy’s fingers.
After a while, when I was a bit too excited about the situation, I whispered to him if he wanted to stay the night – because in my mind it was an okay thing to ask when you were grinding with another man against a hard surface for about a fourth time – and he kissed me again and pulled me closer and then pushed his hand down my pants and said
“Come!” She grips his elbow and starts pulling him after her. People part as she walks through them, and Harry loathes her even more.
“No, I like it,” he whimpers, and he cannot continue because Malfoy tightens his fingers at the top and Harry’s hips drive into it.
'No...yes, maybe, I don't know. I think about you, what you might be doing and with whom... The doubt is there and it's huge. I can't just... make it disappear.'
I stayed for a bit, drank one beer and I couldn’t do it anymore, Ron looked pained, Neville too, Luna was her usual unperturbed self, which helped, but only a little. So I left and am now wallowing in self-pity.
Harry admires Malfoy’s ability to say this in one breath. “My mouth wasn’t open, and I was thinking about something.”
'Potter. I don't care. We will be sitting at the same table, next to each other. I want to match with my best friend.'
Malfoy opens his mouth, but Harry doesn’t hear anything because there are people rushing inside, Hermione and Ron, Molly and Ginny.
Malfoy goes to work, works, then at about 6pm closes the shop and then at about 7pm goes home. He lives in the Manor. I tried to follow him inside, but he has wards around the monstrosity, and I didn’t want to dismantle them in case he would notice.
‘Oh okay. I call you or something,’ she says as she’s taking their glasses and handing them to Potter who is just staring between us. She goes into the crowd and stumbles into  someone. Potter wants to say something, he’s opening his mouth and I just know it’s going to be stupid. ‘Your friend has some difficulties there, Potter. Maybe you should help?’ I nod behind him and he turns and finally sees Granger wildly gesticulating at a stranger who has an arm around her waist.
I couldn’t, so I went up to the attic and pulled out an ugly copper bust of a face of some witch, possibly Black, which was, surprise, cursed.
'Yeah.' He doesn't smile or frown. His face is blank, void of anything. There's nothing for me anymore.
‘… was because of an occasional long-distance portkey to see your girlfriend? Honestly! At least your alcohol is good.’
Harry licks his lips when Malfoy now opens his mouth, brows set low above his eyes. He wonders about that tongue. What it would feel like in his mouth or on his neck or his shoulder or chest or cock or thighs-
'I haven't and I am. Oh, wait. What about the wedding? We said it would be in a year. Should we postpone then?'
‘Yeah? Well two can play this game. Let me... I need to stretch.’ I get an elbow to my shoulder, knee to my thigh and he finally stomps on my foot. I fucking hate him!
Andromeda comes back carrying a tray. ‘Why aren’t you sitting? There’s a space on the sofa. I believe you boys can behave while sitting meter apart?’ she puts the tray on the table and I see Potter’s red face.
I watch as Teddy flies up and down, catching a snitch and then throwing it away just to catch it again. We played a seekers game for two hours. I swear, this boy’s energy knows no limits, he’s been doing this for at least another hour now. I don’t think I’m old, but that much time on a broom, when not done regularly can be a bit tiring.
He catches up to me and we continue in silence again. I should’ve taken my camera. The sun is up and the city is nice. Tomorrow then. I pull out one of the papers from my pocket. It’s one with museums, one of the pages in English.
We fall on his bed, rutting against each other. His finger finds its way to my ass, lower and inside. 'You want to fuck me?' I ask him, licking his bottom lip.
“I’m not,” Harry rolls his eyes, and they land on Malfoy again. Malfoy, who is walking towards him. With the woman grinning next to him. “Let’s go,” Harry suddenly says, wanting to avoid him at all costs.
He grabs my thighs and turns us around, pinning me down and I grin at him, reaching up, wanting to kiss him some more. He lets me, for a bit, then he puts his cheek next to mine and I can barely hear him through the pounding of my blood when he whispers
‘Is it?’ I ask him and watch him as he squirms a little. ‘I don’t remember you wanting to learn about muggle things back at school.’ I can’t help myself. It still grates on my nerves that people were so quick to forgive Malfoy for his bullying and being a prat when he was younger. And why not asking him, while we are waiting for our food to arrive?
‘You are supposed to agree with me,’ I tell her and flop down next to her on the couch cushions, laying my head in her lap. She pushes her fingers in my hair and starts stroking.
'So? You know what happened last time. I complained, you were gone all the time, we argued and I cheated! I wanted it to be different this time.'
‘Why can’t you just stop fidgeting?’ I grit through my teeth. It must be ten minutes by now. I knock on the door. ‘Hey! Let us out! It is seven minutes already!’
I yank my arm from her grip. ‘Of course I didn’t. I’m telling you he’s drunk. It’s not my fault he can’t hold his own.’
‘No Rosie, stop hitting your brother! No. That’s not nice,’ Ron takes Hugo, who is surprisingly not crying, into his arms and scolds Rose. ‘You can’t hit him, he’s just a baby.’
Ron nods and finishes his beer. ‘I trust you mate. More wine, Mione?’ he stands up and takes my glass too and I nod.
'You didn't but it still happened, didn't it?' Yes. Now the anger is clear in his voice and eyes, too.
I was lying in the bed when he woke up. There was a hitch of breath and stiffening of shoulders. He turned around, I said good morning. He said it back with a scowl.
'Oh fuck!' He's close and he's gripping my hair tightly, pulling me off. I go, reluctantly, kissing my way up to his mouth, slipping my tongue inside, swallowing his breaths.
‘Don’t be stupid, Harry,’ Andromeda says a little exasperated, ‘you’re always welcome here. Sit and I’ll bring you a pie and tea.’ She leaves to the kitchen. Finally Teddy notices him, runs and starts showing off his catching skills. ‘Amazing Teddy, you’re getting better,’ Potter says and then addresses my mother. ‘Good afternoon, misses Malfoy,’ he reluctantly looks at me and only says ‘Malfoy’ like it’s a hello enough. ‘How are you?’ He asks her, clearly suffering, judging by his pinched expression.
Poor Hermione doesn’t catch the sarcasm. ‘Really? How lovely you’re finally trying to be friendly with each other,’ she says distractedly while turning back to her mound of books sitting precariously on a coffee table.
'Yeah.' He doesn't look at me and I need to see his face so I reach out and touch his arm. He flinches and stands up.
‘So. Ginny is thinking of taking a position in America, in some amazing quidditch team they have there. She would move there, for two whole years at least.’
and maybe that made me mad because I pushed away more forcefully than I intended and he squawked something when I practically pushed his face into the pillow.
, it was so funny,” she laughs. Harry thinks it isn’t that funny. The story, just as her – truly dull. Malfoy, on the other hand, chuckles and continues writing in the file.
Today I decided to take a day off and spend it with Neville at Hogwarts. Luna was there too. We mostly helped him with some plants – which I didn’t know that was what we would be doing when he invited me to come – but then we went to the lake, visited Hagrid and went to Hogsmeade and it was a very nice day indeed.
‘I knocked.’ He shrugs and tosses a stack of parchment on my desk that knocks back my tea which spills everywhere.
and I wanted to say yes but then I remembered I was going to the Burrow and then I promised Ron we could test that dream charm again, and I started saying
But, eventually, he slows it down, shifting to my neck and only then do I realise I really need to take a breath.
‘She just had her first child, so you know, she’s pretty busy now,’ she answers and her smile is a bit strained.
I eat a piece and it’s good so I tell him: ‘You should stay with aurors. You lost touch with the snitch and this pie is abysmal.’
She doesn’t even let me finish. ‘Alright, Harry, whatever you say. Now come, let’s watch the spectacle the guys prepared. Here you go,’ she hands me a camera, ‘go stand there so I have it from different angles.’
‘Cheers,’ I say. And really, this has turned up to be a good meeting. Granted, I will have much less free time, but then again, what would I need it for either way.
I’m wrung out, lying on top of him, feeling his fist stilling between us. I look down and he’s still hard. I knock his hand away and once again I suck him in and suck him off, I push my fingers inside of him, making him come in my mouth on a beautiful raspy groan. It really sounds incredible.
‘Yes.’ She thanks Ron when he puts her mug and three muffins next to her on the table. ‘Maybe if you two would talk things out or change both your attitudes towards each other, he might be prompt with you two.’
“… and how they ended up bloody. I will never understand. It was just a missing kneazle.” Malfoy sighs and runs his fingers through the blond strands again. He stands up and says: “I’m going to get lunch. Can I trust you’ll do it?”
‘Wonderful. Here,’ I take out the pouch with the agreed sum of five thousand galleons. ‘We have the money, so maybe we could see the merchandise now?’
Finally, after what feels like forever, I see him striding to me. He smiles and orders as well, sidling up to me, telling me how dirty the loos are here and I laugh, saying I hope he washed his hands otherwise I won’t let him touch my silk shirt. He whispers in my ear ‘I want to touch much more than just your shirt,’ and then he kisses my cheek, lingering, grinning.
Two, Harry has not spoken about it to Malfoy. Malfoy isn’t stupid so he must know what she’s like, she hasn’t tried to hide any of it. Harry doesn’t understand why he still wants to spend time with her when she’s so obvious. Even now they’re together – where, Harry doesn’t know because no one told him, just as many other times these last weeks.
‘Well I thought it was given that sometimes… we’ve been sleeping together for five months, fucking hell! You could stay!’ I can’t believe what’s pouring out of my mouth. I’m essentially begging him to spend mornings with me. ‘Sometimes,’ I finish, trying to save face.
‘Great, thanks for help,’ he mutters and stands up. ‘I came here to take this actually.’ He takes a picture of me, him and Hermione from my dresser.
Harry really tries not to think about it. When he does, he feels this weird ache in his chest and stomach, and he doesn’t care for it. But sometimes, he can’t help himself. He imagines them together and he wants to go back several months. When he and Malfoy had barely any relationship beside being partnered. When Harry didn’t find him ridiculously attractive.
‘You started it! Thinking you’re the best person in every room, that everything wrong you do will be forgotten and forgiven!’
Today, I was testing the new Wheezes dream charm and it wasn’t what I was expecting. I was thinking I would see a meadow or a beach or something else calming and nice, place I would like to visit. Also, as I was told by George, the purpose of the charm is to provide
'Well then, no time to waist. We're having sex for the rest of the night and then all day tomorrow I don't want to see you leaving the bed.'
“So, you heard absolutely nothing of what I just said?” Harry shakes his head and continues gazing at the words in front of him, trying his hardest to make the images of Malfoy on his knees to disappear. “I said Robards just sent a memo we are supposed to go on patrol again tonight because Smith and Passel are apparently incompetent and cannot handle even one minor scuffle, the idiots. The shift is from eight to midnight, so at least not the long one. But seriously, can you believe it?”
‘Excuse me, Ron,’ comes Potter’s voice from behind me, ‘what about the annual Auror Quidditch Tournament? My team always wins.’
'But seriously. I have nothing against one night stands, in fact it might be beneficial for you in the state you're in. Relax, have some fun, no strings attached. You'll see, it's great.'
He sighs, turns his back to me. ‘Since you’re in such hurry, I let you go now. The door is at the end of the hall, to the left.’ He starts washing the dishes, muggle way.
‘Yeah, ditto. Just… stop moving, idiot! You keep hitting me.’ So I hit him too, I think a shoulder. He pushes me and then I shove him and there's a thud when his back hits the closet wall.
I needle him about it. ‘Never been in a gallery, Potter? You can’t just grab everything with your greasy fingers.’
“Potter,” Malfoy grumbles just as Harry is few steps away. Harry turns and watches his mouth open and close multiple times, until he settles on: “I’m just tired.”
‘Shame. Lynxar is in the position for six years now and she is absolutely useless,’ he says while chewing. Gross.
‘So, since when are you going to muggle galleries?’ Potter shakes his head, most probably in disbelief.
“Hilarious, Potter.” Malfoy takes his wand and points it at his shirt and trousers, vanishing the smell and drying himself. “Hope you’re happy. Now, scram.”
I nod. ‘Of course, I do.’ I involuntarily look down at his chest and he catches it and rolls his eyes.
Harry moves so that there’s no contact between them and Malfoy steps away. He puts the glass down on a table, refills it and walks to the door. Harry has time to watch him, his long legs and swaying hips, and he has to ask a healer what they did to him that he’s pondering Malfoy’s body.
'I was lonely. You were away all the time, we were fighting a lot, which was my fault, I was stressed, that wasn't a lie. But I never told you why, because I didn't want to bring more tension.' Now that I'm talking, I don't think I can stop. I will tell him everything.
When I ask her again, after she stops writhing under me, she says she did. ‘Next time I will come on your cock, I promise.’ There’s silence and then we’re laughing and she says more dirty things and it’s ridiculous.
I spent today with Teddy and Andromeda, and very innocently inquired about Malfoy. She said he visited last Saturday. Played with Teddy. (And now that I think about it, he probably mentioned it Friday when my mind was foggy.)
I told him no. I just know I would do something stupid again. So I said to Ron to wish her good luck for me, he said he will, we drank some lemonade I had in the cupboard, listened to wireless and then, after two hours he left to say goodbye to Ginny.
'That's not fair! I just want you to be happy and content. It's so hard recently to talk to you about anything. Everything sets you off.'
“What are you grumbling about again?” Malfoy swivels on his chair to face him. “It’s your turn today.”
Turns out Malfoy hated the idea of Harry getting it on with Coraline just as Harry did. Her first concern apparently was whether she would be working directly with him. And when Malfoy confirmed it, she went on saying she fancied him and wanted to seduce him.
‘Are you serious? Just because someone said it might be another poison?’ I look at him and he’s suddenly the twelve-year-old brat who must have everything.
‘No,’ she shakes her head just as I hiss ‘no’ as well, ‘probably just the not so suppressed hatred.’
He stills. ‘You do realise, you imbecile, that you are holding my hand? Release it right this second.’
Ginny came home, visiting, exactly the moment as I was leaving the Burrow. It was awkward, for me. She said hi and hugged me and I could smell her hair – she changed her shampoo, I didn’t like it. She tried for some chit-chat, I tried to chit-chat back, but it was stilted and the whole family kept looking at us and Ron was visibly cringing just the way I was on the inside. I ended the whole painful situation with
‘In fact, I’m your first cousin once removed, it is more than possible you have other cousins, for example…’
That's why, because my heart is breaking all over again. And it's, once again, just my own fucking fault!
Harry thinks Malfoy might wank him again or that he would rub himself on Malfoy and spill on his chest.
All breath catches in Harry’s lungs when Malfoy just puts them on Harry’s nose and hooks them gently behind his ears. Harry sees him clearly now, wet hair and rosy cheeks, rapt expression.
he said, his fingers pulling me back by my hair, kissing my neck while I was putting the box on the countertop, missing it and hearing as it fell on the floor.
I asked Malfoy today, why he was looking at that Wheezes display. He just closed the shop, I was lingering in front of it only for few minutes because I had to stay late in work, and I walked with him before he apparated.
'The goblins hired new people, to delegate some less important work. There was a woman, we were supposed to work in the same office.' I hear him breathe out. 'It was fine at the beginning, she was nice enough...' I pause because his fingers grip the glass just a bit tighter. 'But then she made it obvious she liked me, she started flirting with me...'
‘Are you joking?’ he looks at me like I’m mad. This kid, I swear, where does he get this cheek from? ‘But you are not my gran. You are Draco, my most favourite cousin!’
‘Is this idea so brilliant it warranted such a dramatic reaction, Pans?’ asks Blaise, unimpressed. ‘Besides. Tomorrow’s Monday. We cannot get sloshed.’
Because Malfoy is still Malfoy, but from time to time he is Draco in Harry’s head. He is fun and prickly, posh and spoiled, smart and competent. He can brew a great cup of tea but horrible coffee. He argues with Harry about little things which lead to the bigger ones, and they do not speak afterwards, sometimes for days, until one of them apologises. Malfoy is still the git from school, but he is also Draco, the prat Harry wants to kiss.
At one point, he was convinced Malfoy hexed him while he was laying unconscious in the hospital bed. Harry thought maybe Malfoy wanted to embarrass him. But then, two weeks ago, he saw him kissing some woman outside the Ministry and nothing made sense, once again.
‘The fuck you do! You insult my work, my morals, everything I do, you disrespect me! I bet you hate I still breathe the same air as you!’ I grip his wrists harder.
He stays quiet for a beat and doesn’t answer. ‘I only came to make sure you’re really not dead. I see now. Even though you’re grey enough to be. Good.’
‘Excuse me,’ I murmur when I stand up. To my utter horror, Potter just smashes the last remnants of his pie into his mouth and follows me.
So I just snuggle deeper into the sheets. Whatever happens, happens. If he wakes up and says it was weird, fine. If he recoils from what he allowed me to do to him, painful but still fine.
‘It’s none of your business, Potter,’ he spits and put his hands on the table, his knuckles are white and I think he’s about to get up and leave. ‘If you don’t believe me, fine. Don’t. We’re not friends, I don’t care, but…’
‘Harry!’ he screams and frankly, there is no need for such volume since Potter is already walking towards us.
'Looking for a good position. It's only four, I'm not getting up yet. Maybe like this... Jesus, you're warm.'
'This. I want to be with you. Properly, not just fucking. I know you still don't trust me but I want to try and earn it back. If it's possible.'
‘There would be an investigation if something were to go wrong, under Veritaserun. Guess you skipped that part, too?’
I add sugar and sip. It’s horrendous, but I finish it. Then I make myself tea and that is only a little better.
And her accent! Harry hates it, it’s annoying because it’s coming out in her shrill voice. He especially hates when Malfoy starts speaking French to her. He imagines all sorts of things. He probably tells her some sweet nothings. But Malfoy’s French - Harry likes. Possibly too much.
Apparently, the vials were saved by Malfoy and now they’re in the Ministry’s lab (if I have to say something about it, they won’t remain there for long, I hope they’re not messed up). He was also the one, they said, who saved me and brought me out. I don’t know any details; I haven’t seen him since and Julie just said I was unconscious but breathing when we got outside the room. It’s all very mangled in my mind, still.
I let him go abruptly and shove him away from me. He gasps and slides down a bit, still standing. ‘You have no idea! You don’t know me!’ I step backwards, trying really hard not to just thump him and break his fucking face. ‘I have nothing to apologize to you for! Just because you can’t handle the truth! Fuck you Malfoy and fuck your so called morals!’
Harry’s voice is scratchy when he asks Malfoy again why exactly he’s there. “I was nearby and just wanted to make sure you were still breathing. It’s your turn to do the paperwork.”
He laughs and turns his head towards me. 'You can dream, Potter.' He kisses me and I slowly push inside. I muffle his groan with my tongue in his mouth.
When he finishes, he gulps his beer and I’m half expecting he’s going to burp, but thankfully no sound comes.
I think about how soft his skin is, how good he smells when I kiss up his stomach and chest and neck and lay myself down on top of him. His hands roam my back and his fingers tangle in my hair anew. We kiss for a while, two minutes, ten minutes, half an hour, I can't tell. Time is not important when he's so hot and solid under me, when I can't think of anything but him and his warmth.
I really wanted to just say no and to just talk about what’s going on, but I stepped back and said okay instead.
Potter goes on, ‘I want to help you so that doesn’t happen. Please, give me all of it and other means or devices of communication, if you’re hiding any.’
“It sure looks like it. Crumbs everywhere, your nails,” he shudders, “you’re just so disgusting it’s lucky that desk didn’t just run out on its own.”
It is lovely. It fascinates me how something so muggle can be so beautiful. I never thought I would admire an unmoving painting by muggles. Art that is clearly not magical but still incredible.
‘Maybe when you’re older,’ I tell him again, since apparently my previous answers were not good enough.
I turn to him and he really looks like it personally hurt him. ‘You should read it, it’s actually very interesting.’
‘You may not!’ I try speaking over Pansy’s chortling. ‘You are losing the ‘best’ quite quickly right now, both of you. And I thought you hated it when I was talking about my sex life with you, Blaise? Or was I wrong, and should I tell you how I was balls deep in her…’
Malfoy bites on his bottom lip so harshly Harry tastes blood. He lets go of Harry’s cock and puts both of his hands on Harry’s arse. He grabs the cheeks, nails digging in the muscles and Harry likes the idea of being marked in the morning. Malfoy squeezes few times, spreads them and pushes them back. Then he fucks so hard inside Harry that he has to catch himself from falling over. But Malfoy holds him, guides him on his cock, faster and faster, ramming his prostate each time. Harry’s cock brushes against his torso and Malfoy’s mouth latches on Harry’s throat.
Malfoy shakes his head. His face is flushed pink and so close Harry can see few freckles on his cheeks. “Tell me how you like it. I want to make it good for you.”
‘Was I supposed to send a formal letter? By all means, Potter, it will be the first thing I do as I get back home. Is that good enough for you?’
Malfoy snorts and continues stroking Harry’s back. It lulls him slowly to sleep again and he’s completely powerless not to succumb.
‘That’s what I meant.’ I am speechless for a while and I don’t notice the waiter when he delivers my plate. I look at Potter and he is already eating his shepherd’s pie.
There’s silence and then Pansy claps loudly and jumps up. ‘I have an idea! How about we get drunk and forget all our worries?’
This morning I got an owl from Parkinson to come and entertain her with my presence this evening at some muggle club. This is a great opportunity to know more about her and Malfoy - if he’ll be there.
It’s stuffy in their office today. Harry shed his auror robes as soon as he entered this morning. Malfoy has persisted, until now.
She looked good, happy and pretty and confident as she always was, and I think I might love her less for it.
'No, it isn't. It's not at all how I wanted to do this. I've been planning it since may, obsessing and looking for the best moment, but you're being a right prat so... I want to be with you, for as long as possible.'
There’s a knock on my door just as I am about to start writing back an answer, immediately followed by Potter stepping in.
. I tried to push it away by pushing my face in a pillow as forcefully as possible, but it was still there, mixing with Bill’s face and the guy’s who gave me his phone number and Ginny’s and Hermione’s colleague’s and Cho’s  until it finally settled on Malfoy again and the only thing I wanted was to go to sleep.
He slaps me on my thigh all of a sudden, pretty hard. ‘There you have it! If he wouldn’t be okay with it, he wouldn’t ask for it again, right?’ Ron cringes. ‘That sounds wrong.’
Malfoy is standing in front of my bed, black robes on and some sort of a grimace on his face. ‘I am. What are you doing here?’
He makes a nonsensical sound and licks my chin, probably aiming for my lips but missing. I almost stop moving altogether when he finally speaks. 'Merlin, I can't believe you want me to stroke your ego right now when
. I died then, just a little, froze completely. I don’t know how, but I was already tucked in when Malfoy pushed me away, put his robes back on and said
‘Yeah, mate. Thank you. It was so good to take a breather from them,’ Ron sighs and Hermione glares at him. ‘I love them, so much,’ Ron hurries, ‘but I mean, everyone needs their alone time sometimes, right?’
‘What in fucking hell are you yelling for?’ she appears from behind a corner in nothing but a towel, her hair wet.
‘Yeah!’ he yells, ‘be there in a second!’ He tosses the golden ball again and it’s like I haven’t said anything.
We parted ways probably at about midnight, they left together arm in arm, Parkinson kissing my cheeks and Malfoy just grunted a very poisonous
'I'm going to do the dishes so it won't bother you when you come back since I didn't do them yesterday and the day before. And we're not sleeping in one bed today. I cannot stand you right now.'
We ended up in his bed again. I arrived and I was determined to talk it out, whatever his problem was, but he just opened the door, grabbed my hand, led me upstairs, got us naked and we proceeded to bed where we did about the same thing as before.
I kick the door, his eyes blazing with anger when they bang into a wall. He lifts his wand to my face. 'If you don't get out right now, I will hex you right in your fucking face. And then you can say I am responsible for maiming you.'
‘Well, you’re alive so obviously you did not kill each other and considering you spend several minutes together in a closed closet at Luna’s few days ago, one is wondering, you know?’ He grins even wider.
‘Aunt Ginny said what?’ Potter asks when exactly at the same moment I say ‘we’re not friends’. Potter glares at me and mouths something at me which I think is ‘shut up’. So I mouth back at him ‘fuck you’.
‘Did you see him, Malfoy? He was so happy, how could you crash his hopes to have his family together?’ he asks and is he trying to make me feel guilty? Well, tough luck!
‘Since you are already reading it, I hope I don’t have to explain my presence any further,’ he comes closer, turns few pages and points at the last line, ‘Bloodroot Poison. And I included a very in-depth examination, in case someone would have any objections to the result.’
more than anything. He’s so close and yet so far. His palms on my hips, flexing fingers. He barely dances, just moves from side to side. I can dance for both of us, then. But if I do, he will let go and I cannot stand it. So, I move from side to side with him, barely dancing.
He then kissed my thigh and hip and stomach, and I grabbed him by his arms and kissed him. I was thinking we would just lounge there, in front of the fire, maybe he would bring something sweet and maybe we would do it again. He was so pliant; his hands were everywhere, and we were kissing for a long time and I just wanted to kiss for longer. But then,
‘Ts, in such rush, no fun with you, British people,’ she sighs and motions to the man who brought us here, speaking German. He nods and leaves. ‘Stefan will bring it. It will take just a moment.’ She then proceeds to strip the man of his shirt, smiling sweetly.
I stay put. I think if I stand up I might just fall back down. Because this can’t be. It’s moving way too quickly.
‘Accio wand,’ I say, extending my arm, hoping it will land in my hand soon. I see it flying away from the guy who took them.
'Because of me?' He was red in the face, angry. 'How am I responsible what people do with their purchases? Did I...'
when Parkinson strutted over, greeted me with overly sweet smile and a bizarre apology for wanting to hand me over to Voldemort, I said
We moved to the sitting room where all the others were and it was warm and cosy, everyone was talking and laughing, and I couldn’t be happier.
I don’t know if I can take it anymore. Yesterday I was on the brink of mental collapse when Potter just appeared in the lab, looking determined. Thank Merlin I persuaded Celeste to come, she was acting as a buffer, but she flat out refused today, so it’s just me and him. And if we survive, I’d consider it a success.
He steps closer, letting his arms fall by his sides. He’s holding his wand. ‘Malfoy. You’re lucky none other than me saw the owl. You and all of this mission would be put at risk if someone was to expose the whole thing. Mainly you, however.’
He nods and sits up. He takes us both in hand, watching. ‘How would you want me?’ he asks, not looking me in the eye.
I agree and, delightfully, see Potter frown even more. ‘Yes, indeed. Maybe when you’ll be older you will learn to cook it, too.’
'Well, have a good evening and see you Monday, I have to go to the Ministry, we can have some of that disgusting coffee.'
The second time he wakes up, he’s laying on his side with Malfoy behind him. They fuck again, slow and lazy in the early hours of the morning. Malfoy keeps him close the whole time, touching him everywhere he can reach. Harry keeps him just as near when Malfoy pants in his ear.
Hermione said I’m not an asshole but that it is not the best way to go about things when I asked her, because I was having second thoughts about the whole thing.
‘No, Draco. You can cry for however long you want, it’s normal. You are heartbroken still, no matter if he was an asshole or not, I know it hurts. You don’t have to pretend with me.’ She is so earnest I almost start the waterfalls again. Instead I just gulp and nod.
'Mhm,' he hums in my mouth, backing us towards his bedroom, only stopping kissing when walking up the stairs and resuming once off them.
'You should go.' He starts putting on clothes and I feel so out of place. This is all so abrupt, my heart is beating hard and I can barely stand up.
I told Malfoy about the patrols – because it is my fault they’re happening – to be careful what he does. He gritted his teeth, cursed me all the way to hell and told me it was all my fault. I agreed of course and apologised again. I didn’t know what else to do so then I left.
“Why do you want to get rid of me so much?” Harry asks jokingly. Malfoy doesn’t react, just looks ahead, jaw set. Harry continues, good humour disappearing. “But yeah, I suppose. If you want to be alone, I’ll leave you. See you Monday.”
I breathe. Calm, deep and slow, just so I don’t barge through that door and do something very unseemly.
‘I am never drinking again. I have no idea, I don’t remember any of this and neither anything after.’ I massage my temples in hopes everything will suddenly come back to me. It doesn’t.
and then he came closer, started kissing me and pushing me backwards until I was sitting on the bed. He then started undressing – it wasn’t a long affair, he was only wearing robes and
She sits on Harry’s desk. She keeps doing it and Harry hates it. She perches there and talks to Malfoy, loud and voice high like hyena.
At this point, he would take a nightmare over a sex dream. It’s excruciatingly difficult to go to work and pretend he doesn’t dream of Malfoy almost every other night, naked in his bed, doing all sorts of things. It’s also still hard to believe that he wasn’t hexed.
‘I want to go here,’ I turn to Potter and show him a picture of an old looking building, which is apparently a national gallery.
‘Yes, I told him I am meeting with you about possibly working together. And since this is just part-time, we should be fine.’ We agreed on sixteen hours weekly, based on my current work load that’s maximum I can do and Granger was totally fine with it, saying she expected less. ‘I will of course tell him about what we agreed on and once the contract is signed of course.’
I don’t have to revert to secrecy, it’s apparently enough being friendly-ish with Malfoy to get him talking. Even though I think I still have a long way to go. I’m planning to stop by again today, to see how much more he will let slip.
'It is you who is selling it so it makes you accountable. You are the enabler, Malfoy.' I want him to feel bad, because it would make me feel better about myself.
'You'll get over it. Alright, I think it's time to step in, Blaise is getting overly intimate with that bong.'
Teddy looks at him, his lips twitching up in a smile. ‘Yeah, I guess you can try. But leave the writing to me, I don’t want to correct your mistakes.’
Naturally, Harry follows because he wants to explain. He can’t have him think that he wanted to break them up. Well, he might have hoped they would, but he hasn’t been actively doing anything.
One, she’s kept hitting on him whenever there’s been an opportunity, whenever they’ve been alone. Harry’s tried really hard to avoid such situations, but somehow she’s still sniffed him out. What was even worse, Malfoy has appeared each time, frowning and taking her with him somewhere. Harry still hopes against all, it wasn’t to go and fuck in some cupboard.
'I don't know, it's weird. You never do it unless I make you and suddenly a garden needs pampering and you come running. Should I turn into a garden?'
'Hm. Yeah, looks pretty. Granger's dress is beautiful... not the worst colour with that ginger hair...'
, and I do it just for a bit longer until he tries to push me away with his hands against my shoulders. I take his wrists and pin them to the bed and I fuck him, hard, just like he wants, the only way he can stand it with me now.
He’s managed to unbutton my shirt and we’re now chest to chest, his arms around me, no space, no air between us.
'Mulled wine might do you good. There is a Christmas market nearby, I'm headed that way, so if you want to join.'
‘Ride me, yeah?’ I say. She straightens and she does, moves up and down. I keep touching, her thighs, back, breasts, arms.
This is so not going according to plan. Malfoy was supposed to be mostly quiet the whole time, not instigating a fight.
I snort. I really do like Teddy, he’s hilarious, smart and can take Potter down a peg anytime. I listen to them talking when Lyra flies to the window and sits there politely. I open it and take the parchment tied to her leg. She immediately flies away, well behaved owl that she is.
‘Please! No one will even spare you a glance,’ she says, closes the folder and throws it on the table next to the fireplace.
Malfoy grabs him by the jumper and pulls. Harry can’t really see what’s happening because a ball of ice breaks his glasses. It hails on his head as Malfoy keeps dragging him somewhere.
This morning, Malfoy came to the DMLE offices to make a complaint about the witch that keeps complaining about him. Jonson told me when I saw Malfoy leaving her office in a strop, so I asked her and she said he suspects the witch is selling some illegal potions.
‘Fine, when I see her I will shove this to her face, screaming, how she could ever think it might be anything else than a Bloodroot poison.’
Wednesday, I saved ten crups from the hands of smugglers, I went off on Davies for barging into my office without knocking, I interrogated a witness in our obliviation case and then I waited till Malfoy came home and took me to his bed.
I’ve been so busy this week. Work. But honestly, mainly Malfoy. We’ve been meeting every evening, never walking or eating together anymore. I don’t remember having this much sex in one week before.
, she said. I felt pretty uneasy. She was nice and all, my age and pretty, but all the same, it was awkward. I mean, it was for me, she looked at unbothered, but I was fidgeting and constantly sipping on my butterbeer and looking all around. I was glad when she decided to go grab a cupcake and with
‘Do I honestly have to be this person the whole time here?’ he asks, inhaling loudly. ‘This cannot be good for my health. Six fucking days. Fuck.’
'I...was lonely and drunk that evening and... I don't know how much you want to know.' I don't want to go into detail, it would be upsetting. I tried to forget so hard.
he said once he finished. I sent the plates over to the sink and came up to him, kissed him. He put his hands on my waist and suddenly I was on his lap. We were kissing for a while when he said
And, yeah, I must I liked it. It was definitely sloppy but he didn’t complain and it was really arousing when he moaned and tangled his fingers in my hair. He came in my mouth, warned me, but since I was already doing it
I slam my palm on the desk. ‘Enough Blaise! This is not funny. Just tell me what happened at the party.’
So, yeah, we jerked each other off in my kitchen and I don’t know how to feel about it because once we finished, I still wanted to take him upstairs and kiss some more. But,
I am silent, just chewing and trying to burn a hole in Potter’s forehead, right next to his scar, but Andromeda looks at me and says ‘and you, Draco?’ and so I answer her. ‘Very much so. Can’t wait.’
We talk about how Teddy’s flares of accidental magic are getting better and how he manages to control it. We talk about Andromeda’s new venture – baking as a business. She says it’s going well but she doesn’t feel like opening anything officially. I think she should. I would never say this out loud, especially to Molly, but Andromeda’s baking is next level.
‘Plenty of times, Potter. More times than you, for sure. Unlike you, I at least know not to smell all the paintings.’
And then the closet opens and I’m blinded by light. ‘Seven minutes up, mate,’ I hear Ron’s cheery voice, my eyes trying to adjust to the brightness. ‘Why are you holding hands with Ferret?’
He knows almost everything there is to know about her, he thinks. Malfoy might know even more, considering he appointed himself as her personal guide around London. Harry wonders if they’ve already slept together. Sometimes he gets an unbelievable urge to just ask and quench the curiosity.
Somehow, she still managed to persuade me. I just got ready, Ron and Hermione are waiting downstairs and I decided to write a little just to delay the inevitable a bit.
From then on, it all went fast. We were basically just grinding against each other, only used our hands, and it is embarrassing how fast I came, now that I think about it. Once he came too, he rolled off next to me, breathing heavily, I turned to him and we kissed for a while. I was getting sleepy, and we were still tangled together, I had my face in his neck because he just smelled so good and then, when I was
‘Lovegood, best advice, really? So what did she advise you in this case? What was the big revelation?’ My hand is shaking with the effort not to send a stinging hex her way.
She laughs and it sounds lovely, like some stupid bells or something. “You will, Potter. She’s assigned to us,” Malfoy explains with pained expression.
I’m finally alone. I have a constant headache, third day running. There’s been so many people and questions – especially from the Ministry.
'I don't want to talk about it! I don't want to hear anything about it. I don't want to see you right now. I need to think.'
‘Are you ill or is this still about Tim?’ Pansy asks while going to the bar and pouring us some whiskey. I take it and even though I've already consumed more than enough these couple of days, I take a generous swig.
I just grip him tighter. ‘No. You are getting on my nerves and if I have to hold your fucking hand for the rest of time for you to be still, then I will.’
I nod and hand over the pouch to her. It’s Stefan who takes it, points the wand at it and then nods to her. She closes the box, stands up and extends her arm to me, her eyes narrow and her lips lifted on one side.
‘No, you don’t, Draco. You’ve barely spoken to me or looked at me this morning. Usually you at least snark or something.’ He goes on glaring at me.
‘Enough with my mouth already,’ he says and flushes pink. ‘I liked it well enough. I bet you thought I would hate it.’
Robards told me yesterday that he assigned a team to monitor suspicious shops in Knocturn because of me!! The aurors will do patrols, if they suspect something, they can search the shops as well.
‘Come on mate. I know why it’s confusing but obviously he didn’t have any second thoughts. So will you meet him again?’ Ron asks at the end.
He busies himself with making the drinks and eventually, because he does start feeling like a jerk and he doesn’t appreciate it, he asks her if she wants something too.
‘So do you hate this as much as I do?’ she asks as soon as there's just us and I snort, very inelegantly.
He rolls his eyes. ‘What’s next on your crusade to annoy me? So far, mostly unsuccessful, I must say.’
'Yeah, of course. She's my friend, we've been friends for so long. I want the best for her. I want... yeah, soon...'
‘Have fun in Germany,’ he says as he hugs me. ‘I heard there’s some famous wall. Maybe you can go see it when you’ll have time.’
'Is this you breaking up with me, Potter? Because in that case you're not getting any shepherd's pie I made.'
And it’s like nothing happened. She sits down on Harry’s desk, swings her legs, yaps about nothing and laughs way too loud.
Gradually, his smile stills. ‘I mean, you don’t have to. I just thought… I wanted… but it’s okay, we can do anything else. What do you want to do?’
I go back to my room. I lie down, close my eyes. But it’s no use to try and sleep so after an hour I dress and go downstairs again. I want to go for a walk. When I try to open the front door, it’s locked. I use my wand but that too, fails. I’m thinking of other spells when I hear footsteps behind me. It’s the auror from the kitchen, wand in hand.
‘Yes you are darling,’ Pansy smiles and sits down on my desk, turning back to Blaise. ‘Did you tell him?’
Today, I went to apologise to Malfoy. He was just finishing with a customer. I told him I won’t follow him any longer. He smirked and said he should’ve complained sooner.
And that opened a whole lot of questions, like: what is wrong with me, am I feeling sick, do I have unexplained empty spaces in my memory, any sickness, did I still not stopped with stalking him and what do I mean by seeing Malfoy?
Malfoy’s hair sticks to his skin in places and his lips look pillowy and soft. Harry wants to lick that glittering space above them. Harry wants to smell and kiss his pink cheeks, put his own cheek next to it to feel the skin.
'So sorry this inconveniences you, Potter. I will try to take my existential crisis in another room when you're here.'
, went to Malfoy’s shop today, because the whole sex thing left a sour taste in my mouth and he didn’t send an owl or fire-called or anything since then.
We are quiet, I’m waiting for her to continue and Blaise is just nodding as though he is too. Before I have time to do anything at all, Pansy snaps. ‘Wow, thank you guys, great advice!’
I went babysit today and Andromeda told me that Malfoy was visiting over the weekend, like it’s no big deal!! He apparently brought some toys over for Teddy and stayed only for an hour or so.
He looked around, disgust clear on his face, crease between his brows and said: ‘I expected nothing more.’ Then, when he walked into his bedroom: ‘I see you decided to put me back in the closet, Potter. It’s curious this twin bed even fits here.’ I left him there when he shut the door right in my face with a sneered: ‘Let me unpack in peace, at least.’
Harry strides out towards the kitchenette at the end of the hall and hears her rushing after him. He wishes he would be a certified jerk. At least then he would be able to tell her he can’t put up with her anymore. Sucks being always polite.
'Oh my fuck.. yes, yes... oh god,' he chants over and over. I add fingers and he buries his face in his pillow and lifts up his ass more.
He doesn’t know what to say. He doesn’t want to talk about her at all. Silence overcomes them as they walk. Harry should really be going home and not
Malfoy’s mouth moves, but Harry can’t hear. Just as he wants to help, send a Scourgify at him, Malfoy also stomps away without a single word.
He shrugs. ‘All right. She will be taken care of, and you can pick her up only back in England. Come down at 6pm, we have to go over tomorrow’s meeting.’
‘Good answer,’ she nods and takes me back in her mouth. She pushes at my hips so I don’t move and I want to, so much. I don’t. I just look and grip the sheets.
Robards huffs for several more minutes, yells at me a bit, gulps a glass of water so he can yell a little longer and then I am leaving his office with a permission to get the Minister’s approval to engage Malfoy, ‘
He comes out, dressed in his awful clothing and glares at me, arms crossed across his chest. ‘I’m having coffee first,’ he says and shoulders his way around me through the door.
When I look at him, I see perfection. His perfectly styled hair, immaculate style, great cologne, wealth and security, his fit body. I want him, right now. Shame we’re in the restaurant. So at least I rub my ankle on his calf under the table. He grins, his perfect teeth on display.
‘You do realize everyone will carry wands, right? Someone could kill me at any time.’ It is true and I will repeat it no matter how many times anyone says otherwise.
‘Draco bought me ice cream and a snitch. Wait, I’ll show you.’ He takes out the snitch and gives it to Potter.
‘We just have to wait a bit longer.’ We’ve been sitting here only five minutes, so his wailing is really uncalled for. But I keep it to myself. ‘They are waiting for both, would be suspicious if it was just me.’
'I'm sorry about today, I am so sorry. I was supposed to be here and I wasn't. Yes, I chose work because I thought I had to be there and I would do it again.'
It was a great evening, the morning though, not so great. The whole day was a little hazy, but I managed to finish all my reports, talk to Robards, avoid Davies when he tried to eat lunch with me and catch up with Hermione in the atrium – she said Ron looked even worse than I, and I felt so much better!
There is only one exit, it seems, unless something is concealed with a spell. When patrolling the building days previous, we were not able to detect these rooms. I think we might have to update our procedures in the future. Or maybe the room was not there yet. I keep thinking what we missed, what can happen tonight, whether the team is stationed near the mirror or if they got inside.
‘Do you think, Mione, that there’s that sexual tension like Luna said?’ asks Ron, panic in his voice. I almost choke on a blueberry.
I imagined I would do it slowly, savouring it, because it’s always way faster than I would like. Alas, I almost rip it all off him in my haste to get to more warm skin.
‘You know why, I told you and you read it and they just explained it to you in there,’ I motion vaguely around us and he starts opening his mouth again so I keep on going. ‘I am sorry if it causes you distress,’ he snorts, irritable, ‘but I had to do what was best for the case in order to finally move somewhere with it. Thus, I guarantee you will be safe and will return home with no harm done. I really am sorry.’
‘I’m not an idiot. Yes, Potter, I still remember the plan and the hundredth time we went over it  just an hour ago.’ He lifts the beer to his mouth and drinks.
‘Prude or he thinks he’s in love again,’ Blaise points at me with his glass and watches me. My face is a mask. Then he grins. ‘Yeah, definitely the love thing. Remember, Pans, with Tim, at some point he was so secretive and then when he told us he loved him it just poured out of him?’
‘Sometimes,’ I sigh, ‘a simple yes or no would suffice. And if you’d remember, you’d stop using my name.’
He tilts his chin higher, looking down at me, smirking. 'Why would I? You made it clear the other day.'
‘I will try to make it.’ The lift stops, Malfoy gets out and I, again, follow. And I know why he’s here.
He hums, his breath tickling my shoulder. He kisses me there and I stiffen because he’s awake sooner than I’d like him to be. He strokes my arm, my waist and stops on my stomach, petting there. He pushes his thigh higher, bent over my hip.
'... the museum, Potter, I don't want to hear any complaints and then we can do something you want and at sunset, the edge.'
I roll on top of him, sudden and quick, making him gasp. ‘I want you. I want it. Of course I do. Sorry, I spaced out.’ He nods and the smile returns, but just a small one. ‘I adore you, Harry. I want you however you let me.’
‘Don’t know, we’ll find out.’ We start walking to the corner shop to apparate, Malfoy stomping heavily next to me.
‘It’s morning and I need shower and fresh clothes; hence, I should go.’ My insides turn. The sooner I’m gone, the better.
‘I’m going to pretend you didn’t say anything.’ She stands up, still holding my hand and drags me to the kitchen. ‘It’s your favourite, filet mignon.’ We enter the kitchen and I can smell only a slight odour of burnt meat. ‘Sit down, I’ll get you a plate.’
Sometimes I see Granger and Weasley here, other Weasleys or people I don’t know in front of his door and that’s when I turn and leave. I don’t need to talk to them. I already have been interrogated and I don’t need any more inane questions.
‘Potter. What the actual fuck?’ I watch him as he strides in and paces from one end of the room to another. ‘I am waiting for an explanation!’ he snaps after I don’t say anything.
His brain is probably damaged from the beating from the hails, because there’s no other explanation for what he does next. Because Malfoy just had his heart broken and Harry is an asshole who doesn’t know boundaries. Because he leans in just as Malfoy’s fingers are still touching Harry’s glasses. Because he kisses him, out of nowhere with a pounding storm around them. Malfoy’s lips are cold and soft as Harry’s lips finally touch them.
He laughs and raises his brows at me. ‘You must have left the garden when Teddy started organizing again. Get ready for next week, Malfoy.’
I interrupt her. ‘It doesn’t matter I signed the fucking thing. What matters is that it is illegal.’
When his breathing calms he finally opens his eyes and I move, not looking anywhere else, just him and all that green. I think I come because he's finally watching me.
‘Well, this is interesting,’ my mother smiles pleasantly at us and then raises her brows at Andromeda.
Ginny fire-called at about two and I was about ready to flee. Everyone huddled around the hearth, I stayed put on the sofa, listening. No one mentioned I was there. Ginny was talking about her team and practise and Wales and how amazing it all is after she finally ditched me and blah blah blah. Okay, she didn’t say the part about ditching me, but it was given. It was amazing and wonderful and peachy because we aren’t together anymore and she’s finally living her best life.
'No. They are your family and you are theirs. Don't make me go all nice about the Weasleys, Potter. All of them love you like you'd have their ginger hair and this is the only thing I'll say.'
'It happened. Yes, sometimes it comes up in my mind and yours too. And that's okay because here we are now, I hope stronger than before. I trust you that you won't break my heart like it anymore.'
‘Potter!’ He motions for me to come to him. He’s crouching under a table. The others notice us and start directing their spells at him.
‘I didn’t know what you were expecting,’ he says, stepping away from the sink. ‘I wasn’t sure how you’ve felt. I’m sorry if we misunderstood,’ he’s close now, so close I can feel his heat, ‘each other.’ Closer. ‘But I do know. Now.’
I love him. I want to tell him. I want to whisper it to him among all other sickening things that come to my mind and make me go all red and anxious.
'But, I would call and let you know. You're right, it is inexcusable. I will do my best next time. I will do my best with delegating my work, because I want to spend more time with you and our friends. I don't want to make you feel like you don't matter, because you do. I love you and I will do better.'
The pain at the beginning is almost too much. His insides burn with it, and he feels like he’s being split in half. But when Malfoy takes his cock in hand again, it becomes easier to move into it. He speeds up and pain slowly becomes pleasure.
He waves at me one last time and they’re off. He is scared of deep waters but he still dives in... I don’t understand him sometimes.
I make Potter to pay an entrance fee, he grumbles a lot but finally does as I say. We go inside, there is a guided tour and it’s so beautiful inside that I’m sorry Astoria isn’t here. She would love it. Golden and light and peaceful. But it’s Potter who’s with me, looking around like he’s never been in a cathedral before, mouth hanging open and eyes wide.
I am officially 21. I had a lovely dinner with my friends, I was given a very beautiful plant which name I’ve already forgotten from Neville, a flowery silk robe from Luna, 2 books from Hermione, Quidditch season tickets from Ron and he also brought a gift from Ginny – a bottle of Firewhiskey (don’t know what to think about it, whether it’s some dig at the whole crying and pleading with her when she was breaking my heart or she just forgot and sent the first thing she saw).
'No, but one tends to hear things when they're living in the same house with another person who never bothers to close the door behind them.'
So, I went, we played for about two hours and then I almost came in my pants, pushed against that stupid shed wall (I cannot be blamed, it’s been, what, 6 months??). I wanted to cry when he pulled away and said
I interrupt him in the middle of his never-ending rant. ‘I will get the clearance. The mission is in two weeks, plenty of time to file necessary paperwork.’ I hold up my hand when I see he wants to speak up and he goes exceptionally red in the face. ‘Lynxar and all of her team are just not competent enough for this job and, frankly, even for the job they’re doing now, as I’ve been saying for some time. Let me get the authorization and I will be the one responsible if something goes haywire.’
“God! You’re such a pain, Malfoy.” Harry growls as he rakes through the files on his desk Malfoy dumped there this morning without asking.
'Yeah yeah. Get ready to get yelled at when you come home today. You left three pieces of underwear under the coffee table. Three!'
I laugh because he is honestly ridiculous. ‘Since when? I thought I was only your personal chaperone.’
‘You’re not a pain, please keep badgering me.’ She slaps my shoulder with a laugh. ‘So do you know what is the big plan with the invisibility project?’ I nod towards where George, Ron and Lee are huddled on the sofa with my cloak in their laps, waving their wands over it from time to time.
I’m waiting here everyday after work. I want to know immediately if he wakes up or dies. I need to know to figure out what to do next. Astoria says they can’t do anything. Blaise says I am being dramatic. Pansy says I look awful. There was nothing in the contract regarding something similar, but who knows what the Ministry will come up with to annihilate me.
We keep quiet when Malfoys speaks out once again. ‘When are these people supposed to come? I thought it was to be nine sharp. And exactly why am I even needed right now?’
I haven't seen him for three months. I was avoiding him probably just as much as he was avoiding me. It's better that way. I tried to fall out of love with him or something. Thinking, if I wouldn't see him I would forget us. One exceptionally awful night I begged Pansy to obliviate me. She refused. I cried and then I woke up with a headache.
Lying on her bed since breakfast, Harry continued to caress Hedwige, who moved to her side before being interrupted in her gesture when the meal tray appeared on the desk again.
It was not until an hour later that Harry, newly named Hannah, was put out of his mind by the arrival of the director.
It had already been a month and a half since the third year was over and Hogwarts students were on holiday. Harry still remembers the day when he and his friends had split up on the platform of track 9
Having no choice, Malfoy stood up and between the two of them supported Harry by his shoulders for Snape and by his legs for Malfoy.
Moody approached the trio while Malfoy, in the form of a weasel, made a terrified squeak and tried to leave on his way to the staircase leading to the underground of the castle.
Taking her time to eat, Harry spoke for a moment to Hedwige, who watched her all the way until knocks at the door were heard. Harry got up and opened the door to find that his friends had returned before he let them in.
After making dinner and doing the dishes, Harry went up to his room, sat down on his bed and watched his owl sing.
"Mr. Potter, how can I put this...? Last night, when you were brought back here after you fainted, Professor Snape and I examined you. We tested spells and potions several times, but there was no effect. That's why we think that...
"Only two weeks left, Hedwige... Only two more and we can finally go back to Hogwarts. "He said before he changed and went to bed, turning off the bedside lamp.
Hannah finally decides to take off her shoes and clothes to change into her beige silk pyjamas. She finally turned off the light under the eyes of Hedwig who fell asleep immediately while Hannah went under her duvet and let sleep overtake her.
“I told you earlier Ron," said Hermione as he continued to laugh. “The teacher still could have hurt him terribly.”
Harry saw several students around him who thought they were champions, but silence returned when Dumbledore spoke again:
But Harry had reached his limit and passed out. His body fell forward, but Hermione managed to catch him in time. Hermione turned Harry over and cleared his forehead. Then all the students who had stood up when Hermione screamed the name of her friend, surrounded them and saw the scar on the forehead cleared, confirming that it was Harry they all had before them. The teachers stepped forward and pulled the students aside.
Returning to her room, Hannah finally took her new school outfit out of the wardrobe and changed into trousers instead of the usual skirt that the girls wear when knocks at the door were heard. A slight smile appeared on her lips when she saw her friends after opening the door.
When teachers and students saw the golden trio arrive, silence fell immediately as all eyes turned to Hannah standing among her friends at the entrance. Not daring to take a step to sit at their respective table, Hannah felt her hands tremble at the glances she was receiving from people whispering in the room. Hermione on her right reacted and placed her hand on her friend's cheek to get her attention.
His head turned even more. Harry was completely lost. Being both hot and cold, sweat covering his forehead, and despite his shaky body, Harry got out of bed but didn't bend down to put his shoes at the foot of the bed. Heading towards the door of the infirmary, Harry held on to everything in his path to get to a floor below, the Great Hall, where everyone was for lunch.
Hannah was just finishing putting on her pyjamas after dinner when knocks were heard. Wearing a pair of black slippers, she opened the door behind which she saw her friends. Hannah knew something was up when she saw the looks on their faces and let them in. The three of them settled down on Hannah's bed, and Hannah leaned against the head of the bed.
Harry got up on the stool and Mrs. Malkin immediately set to work under the gaze of Professor McGonagall.
With his wand pointed at Malfoy, this one leapt three meters in the air before falling back to the ground with a thud before rising again to fall back to the ground while shouting cries of pain.
Following Dumbledore's words, the students returned to their dormitories, but Slytherin's students discussed the matter with animation once in their common room:
The trio walked over to their table and sat down while the whispers became loud conversations whose main subject was Hannah, and which had the effect of increasing her stress.
Hannah opened the door and slipped into the room before closing behind her when the gaze of her teacher, who was writing on a parchment, landed on her.
Waking up with difficulty the next morning after a very difficult night filled with nightmares, Harry sat on the edge of the bed provided for her the previous day by the director, her long hair falling down his lower back. Forcing herself to get up, Harry got up before taking some clothes and underwear from her new purchases and went to the bathroom. Removing the pyjamas that Professor McGonagall had advised her to take to be comfortable, Harry stood naked in front of the bathroom mirror. Not wanting to look again in the reflection of her new appearance, Harry ran the bath water and rushed in when the water came close to the rim.
The students were settled and ate. When Dumbledore saw the meal finished, he stood up and spoke to them about the usual speech before continuing on to anything else:
Harry followed McGonagall to Hogsmeade. There, McGonagall took Harry to Madame Malkin’s store. Once inside, the owner of the premises approached them.
It wasn't until the next day that Harry awoke... Turning his gaze around, he saw the nurse coming out of her office.
"Everybody back to their seats, immediately! Snape screams. Mr. Malfoy help me move Mr. Potter to the infirmary.”
The teacher gave her a reassuring smile before leaving the room. Finding herself alone, Harry decided to put away his new clothes. When she finished putting away her clothes, she took one of her new pairs of pyjamas and some underwear and headed to the bathroom.
The portrait then opened to make way for Harry’s new room. A wardrobe and a single bed and the Edwidge cage are against the wall to their left, while the fireplace is opposite. There is a desk at the back of the room next to a door leading to the bathroom. They entered the room and put the bags next to the wardrobe.
The usual hubbub reigns in the Great Hall as the students, discussing among themselves what happened to Harry, leave the room to go to their respective classes, which are about to begin.
It was on his words that Draco walked away from his comrades to go to bed and sleep while looking forward to having fun doing Potter dirt.
The director observed her for a moment before leaving his office to go to the Great Hall where the pupils were heading. Hannah, for her part, waited about ten minutes with Fawkes before leaving the headmaster's office to go to her room.
"I present to you, Mr. Maugrey, who will be our new teacher of defence against the Dark Arts. Well, as I was about to tell you, we are going to have the honour of welcoming to our institution in the coming months an event that we have not seen for nearly a century. I am pleased to announce that this year's Three Wizards Tournament will take place. Some of you don't know what this Tournament is all about. The Three Wizards Tournament is a friendly competition between the three greatest schools of witchcraft in Europe: Hogwarts, Hogwarts and Durmstang. A champion was selected to represent each of the schools and they were asked to complete three tasks. Each school took turns hosting the tournament every five years. But until the dead numbers became high, the decision was made to interrupt the tournament. This year, however, the Department of International Magic Cooperation and the Department of Magic Games and Sports said that it was finally time to try to bring the tournament back to life. During the summer, we have been working to ensure that no champion will be in mortal danger. Beauxbatons and Durmstang will arrive in October with a list of candidates and the selection of the three champions will take place on Halloween. An impartial judge will decide which students are most worthy to compete.”
in front of the train that would take him and his friends to school. With his belongings settled, Harry set out to find his best friends.
Following the professor's words, the owner of the place started laughing, making Harry even more uncomfortable.
Once near the Great Hall, Hannah felt her heart beating strongly as she heard all the hubbub in the room and took a step backwards as she felt the stress overwhelm her.
“Is everything all right, Harry?" asked Hermione as she sat on the bed with Ron, whose gaze was on the rest of the meal tray.
They arrived in front of a sturdy doorway, where there was a portrait of a man with thin, elongated features. Seeing the man with long hair and ebony eyes, Harry immediately thought of her potion teacher.
"It will soon be time for dinner. I will go to the Great Hall.  You can stay here with Fawkes for a while longer if you wish to make sure that no one sees you," he said to Hannah.
After their little conversation, they decided to get on the train before it left at 11:00. They easily found a compartment in which they settled down before continuing their conversation during the journey and also talked about what had happened after the Quidditch World Cup. It was not until the early evening that the Hogwarts Express arrived at the Hogwarts station. From there all the students boarded stagecoaches to the castle and headed for the Great Hall when they arrived.
As Ron walked away from Malfoy, he felt something burning on his cheek while the other students screamed. Before Ron had time to take out his wand, he heard a roar that echoed through the hall before a voice could be heard.
"I know many people want to be champions, but the three competing schools, in agreement with the Ministry of Magic, felt it prudent to impose new rules this year regarding the age of the candidates. In view of the difficulty of the tasks imposed, which will remain dangerous despite the precautions taken, only students who have reached the age of majority can submit their names for selection. I will personally ensure that no student who is a minor can cheat. As I told you, the delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstang will arrive in October. I would therefore like you to show them courtesy throughout their stay. All right now, everybody goes to bed!”
The painting moved, leaving a hole in the wall into which they rushed and entered their common room. Hermione said good night to them and went to bed. Harry, Ron, and Neville, who had passed them on the way, went up the spiral stairs to their dormitory. They put on their pyjamas and went to bed.
He began to think and the memories of the day before came back to him. He got up immediately and Madame Pomfrey forced him to lie down.
It had been almost an hour since classes had finished and the banquet had begun. Harry was alone when he awoke in a fever... When he opened his eyes, he realized he was in the infirmary when he saw the walls around him. But he felt lost, his vision was blurred, his breathing was shallow, and he was shaking. Although he felt dizzy when he got up, he sensed that something was physically wrong when he felt his hair longer than usual. Reaching his trembling arm towards the bedside table where he spotted a standing mirror. What he saw, however, shocked him so much that he let go of the mirror on his legs. He observed himself and saw the changes on his body.
"Hello, Harry," said Professor Dumbledore, closing the door behind him. How have you been feeling since yesterday?
Harry, on the other hand, is in shock. Eyes popping out of his head, his mouth gawking, his gaze fixed on the nurse. He had a nervous laugh.
With those words, the boys also separated, promising to send each other cards. Harry had taken his things and Hedwige before heading back to " the house " or rather to the Dursleys. Upon his return, Harry returned to his old routine of housework and meal preparation. Every day passed tirelessly as long days for him, but the letters his friends sent him during the holidays comforted him and made him spend his days not brooding.
"Weasley! Hey, Weasley!" shouted Malfoy to attract his attention with Crabbe and Goyle coming behind him.
Draco returned to the classroom while Professor Snape went to warn Dumbledore. Madame Pomfrey, meanwhile, was busy with Harry...
They took the young man, who was still unconscious, to the infirmary. Mrs. Pomfrey, seeing them enter, rushed to Harry's bedside and asked them to put him on the nearest bed.
Reaching the dungeons as quickly as possible, Hannah avoided all the students heading towards their common rooms before stopping in front of the door leading to the office of her hated teacher, Severus Snape. Taking her courage with both hands, Hannah folded the cape and hid it with her wand in her back, under her clothes, before putting away her wand and knocking. Silence answered her first before a voice was heard.
It was with these words that Dumbledore left the infirmary, leaving Harry in the care of Madame Pomfrey.
Midnight had just passed since Harry's fainting and no news had reached him yet. Hagrid had returned to his cabin to take care of Croc Dur.
When she emerged a good half hour later, Harry stood in front of the mirror and watched her reflection while touching her facial features.
"Why?" he said. Why?! Why always me?!" She cried out in tears before collapsing against the mirror and curling up on herself.
When the cauldron exploded, everyone could see Harry fall backwards and Neville tried to catch him, but it was too late. Young Potter hit his head on the table. All the students and the teacher stood around him and seeing that Harry was unconscious and completely covered with the potion that had gone wrong, Snape decided to send the young man to the infirmary while Neville tried to explain what had happened.
Harry was standing there in front of them, when he was reminded of his condition. Shaking his sweaty head, his forehead cleared just for a moment, showing the beginning of his scar. Hermione, who was sitting next to Ron, and who had planned to go with him to see their friend, froze when she saw the beginning of the mark on her forehead, which she recognized immediately. Rising quickly to her feet at the sight of Harry's condition, she ran towards him, shouting:
Running breathlessly through the empty corridors of the castle leading to her bedroom, Hannah hurriedly opened the door to her room before closing it behind her and removing her cloak of invisibility to lean against the door.
