Terran scoffs and hauls himself off the bed, already stepping back into his trousers.
Malfoy looks at him in surprise, and Harry realises it’s the first time he’s spoken again. “No, but it happened to Simi. They’re the one who let me sleep on their sofa. We became friends, and when I said I wanted to try some things for myself, they told me about it. They taught me how important aftercare is; you have to come down slowly, look after each other, and remember it can happen to either one of you.”
“Look, I’m not convinced you haven’t done something to Harry,” he says. “And it’s not just because it’s you. He says he told you about what happens when he tries to have sex, and you had an idea that helped him. Didn’t say what it was, though.” Weasley takes a deep breath, and continues. “It just seems too simple. Too sudden. I can’t believe that he’s fine having sex with you, a man he’s hated for years, and not someone he loves.”
purple armchair, and conjures a second seat for Draco. “I’ve been having dreams about you.”
Draco’s smile grows even more suggestive, then abruptly dims, his face serious once again. “I still can’t make a corporeal Patronus. I only get mist, if that.”
“Well, I suppose because Luna is your friend, and I should have told you. I just wanted to wait until you were seeing someone before I said anything, to make it less awkward, but...”
“Come on now darling,” he says lightly. “You’re dehydrated, you need to drink something.”
Harry receives a reply just as he’s about to go to bed that night.
Harry intends to make a quick escape, but with two full glasses and a bottle of beer to contend with, it’s not looking likely.
After that it’s a whirlwind of fabric, Harry occasionally nipping back to Grimmauld to offer up different shirts and shoes for their inspection.
He ducks his head, somehow embarrassed despite just having had Draco’s cock in his mouth. “Don’t make me say it.”
Harry can’t take it anymore. He jerks his chin up to quiet Draco’s dirty mouth with his own. Their feet almost tangle together for a moment as they come to an abrupt stop, Draco forgetting the flimsy pretence of the dance to commit himself to the kiss. Harry flicks out his hand to cast a wandless, wordless
He blinks his eyes open. Draco is leaning over him, wearing a wry smile that he quickly covers with annoyance. He’s fully dressed, in the same combination of fancy shirts and trousers, minus the waistcoat. His socks look hand-knitted, and for a moment Harry wonders who is knitting Draco socks. For some reason he can’t imagine Narcissa clacking a pair of knitting needles together. The image of Molly and Narcissa trading knitting patterns comes to mind, strange as a dream.
When he first heard that Arthur Weasley wanted to start some kind of learning centre to teach wizards more about muggles, he laughed. Wasn’t that the same man who hadn’t known how to dress like one at the Quidditch Cup? But, the more he thought about it, the more he thought it was a good idea.  Hogwarts had really not done much to teach their students about the muggle world, and Muggle Studies was elective, not mandatory. Yes, the idea had legs. Although from what he’d heard, funding was an issue.
Mr Filch hummed disparagingly. “Tell me Mr Potter, are you a well-behaved child?”
“I stunned her,” sobs Aisling, “And took the watch. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, I just wanted to take back what was ours. To make my Grandpa proud.”
“I’m not-” starts Harry, but before he can finish his sentence, Draco has already grabbed Jones by the back of his shirt and flung him into the kitchen table.
“That’s what it always does,” sighs Draco.
Or maybe it is. He strides forward with purpose, pinning Harry against the doorjamb and swallowing the gasp it forces out of him. Harry winds his arms around his neck, pulling him closer. Draco can feel his warmth through the soft material of his pyjamas, and he slides his hands under the top to grab at his waist. Harry makes a sound that simultaneously reminds him of both a noise you make after a really good stretch or eating a truly decadent desert. Satisfaction, relief, pleasure. He can give him all that and more.
“Merlin’s balls, Draco. Crying over shagging Harry sodding Potter.”
Harry groans internally. Without thinking it through, he’d tried to comb his hair earlier, and not dress like such a slob. After worrying about acting strangely and giving himself away, he hadn’t even stopped to think about how strange his neat appearance might seem. It was just that Draco was always so well-dressed. Though Harry would never change who he was for someone else, subconsciously at least, he still wanted to impress him.
“First thing first,” says Granny with gravitas, “you need to make tea.”
“It should be something you’ll remember, but not something you would say normally. My safeword is Mandrake.”
“Drinks,” says Harry, clearing his throat. “We need more drinks. What do you guys want?”
Shit. He’s put his foot in it now.
On the other hand, Potter is asking him if he wants to spend time with him, in public. It’s not much of a choice in the end.
Harry drains the last dregs of his beer. “Fine then. If I’m Harry, then you’re Draco. We’ve known each other nearly ten years, it’s been long enough.”
“They thought I was a squib you know. My brother, Rowan, he was the talent. We were twins, and people said he soaked up all the magic in the womb and left none for me. He didn’t care that I was a squib, though. We were thick as thieves- did everything together. Then I started having these dreams. Every night for a year I dreamt of him dying, getting clearer and clearer, until it actually happened.” She stopped to blow her nose, her eyes welling up.
“Where is she, eh?” he whispers, crouching down to fuss the little dog, and letting him lick his face. “Is she upstairs?”
Draco shrugs, obviously not believing him.
you.”
The room explodes into laughter. Ron wipes a tear from his eye as he says “Good one, dad. Who is it really?”
“Yes, sir,” he whispers.
“Is that what people usually ask about, when they want to know their future?”
He takes out his wand and taps Harry’s trainers, before rising to his feet. Sure enough, the laces undo themselves, and Harry lifts his heels so the shoes can slip out from under his feet.
“Narcissa, I need your help,” he entreats as he shoves two slices of seeded loaf into the toaster. “How can I show Draco that I want to be his friend because I like him, and not because you asked me to be? I don’t know him the way I know Ron or Hermione, I don’t know how to make him believe me.”
Draco does as instructed, lowering the young woman onto the purple armchair. Earl growls in her direction.
They just kiss for a long time, sinking into the feeling of skin on skin, the dragging of lips and tongues. Harry still hasn’t put his glasses back on, so everything further away than Draco’s face is a little blurry. He’s the only thing in focus. It’s the most innocent they’ve ever been, reminiscent of when he and Ginny first got together, both eager and bashful. Though, they’d been wearing a lot more clothes than he and Draco are now. Draco finally pulls away, but he doesn’t get far. He seems distracted by the curve of Harry’s neck, and starts sucking bruising kisses in the places where the muscles jump and stretch. His nose brushes a spot under his jaw that tickles, and he jerks his body, laughing, causing their erections to rub together.
“I panic. It’s too much pressure, and I panic. People expect all these things from me and I don’t how to live up to this image of me in their heads. I don’t know if I’m doing it right, I don’t know what they want me to do to them- and I don’t know what they’re going to do.”
Hopefully confronting Draco while naked will help persuade him out of breaking off their arrangement. He’s still getting used to the idea that Draco likes his body, that he’s attracted to him, but he doesn’t have any qualms about using it. This thing, whatever it is, is too good for him to give up just yet.
“Whisky,” he says, surprised at the show of hospitality. After that letter he’d expected they’d go straight to the bedroom.
“There’s only one spot on the sofa left,” says Draco quietly, eyes flitting back to Samuel momentarily. “If you want your new friend to stay, you’ll have to sit on my lap.”
“I’d say you’ve got more to cry about than most,” sighs Draco. “And you’re certainly not spoiled. If affection makes you cry, it’s not your fault- it’s theirs.”
“Go on then Potter, take your kit off,” he says. “Let’s see what we’re working with.”
Malfoy casts a quiet
ed Madam Rosmerta. It’s the only explanation.”
“So perfect, so good for me. You were made for this. Not fighting, not
When Malfoy opens the door, Harry is boiling over with annoyance and anticipation.
“Look, it’s okay, we can keep going.”
Draco sighs, but reluctantly concedes. He’d much rather tease Harry than eat dinner, but if he wants this relationship to develop, they do need to spend time together that isn’t just having sex. He goes back to watching Harry, listening to him talk, locking the memory away for safekeeping.
He shakes his head. “Not until I’m sure.”
After explaining the wards are usually found in the heart of the house, the attic, or the cellar, they set off to find a new door. Guided by the sensation of cold air flowing down towards him, Harry leads Draco upwards. Harry taps his wand to the hatch that leads to the attic, and a ladder unfurls itself. The space is dark, musty, and filled with strange objects.
Harry swallows, wishing he had more beer to wet his dry mouth.
“Look, I’ve got to go, but I’ll do my best.”
Eight of Pentacles: Apprenticeship, Repetitive Tasks, Skill.
“Anytime,” he says. “Any time you need me, I’ll be there.”
“None of that Mrs-ing with me. You can call me Granny.”
, he thinks to himself. Then again, Draco’s the one who loves him, so what does that make him?
They just look at each other for a long stretch of time, Harry trying to tell him everything he feels with his eyes. Hoping he can read what Draco’s saying with his. He can’t be sure Draco can hear what he’s trying to say, and he needs to hear it, because the longer Harry goes without saying it the more it feels like a secret.
“I can only explain what happened before you arrived, after that we’ll need to piece it together between us.” Granny sighs. “After I left my family, taking only the pocket watch I’d given my brother, my family disowned me. They told everyone I’d died with him. They even put up a headstone, over an empty grave.”
“Are you sure Uncle Vernon knows that? Only, he never seems to read them.”
“Don’t be an idiot,” he says, rolling his eyes. “It’s just that your elf is likely to know more about your wards than you.”
It was a leisurely breakfast of tea and toast. Narcissa tried to look adequately stern as he told her stories about her sister Andromeda and Teddy, but smiles broke through her cold exterior. He made it to the shop on time, and had a productive lesson with Granny. All in all, it was the calmest morning he’d had in a long time, but his stomach was churning through all of it. He’d invited Draco for lunch again, after he’d asked to come back and look at the wards with equipment he hadn’t had to hand the last time. Harry had agreed, and now he was bricking it.
She smiles. “The twins were the same, they wore more of their dinner than they ate. George still does sometimes. And I told you, Draco, you must call Molly.”
“Don’t fret,” she says, shushing him. “I’m an old woman, Harry. Falls happen, strokes happen, it’s a fact of life. I’m not scared of death.” Granny smiles softly. “But Draco Malfoy is a young man, with his whole life ahead of him. I’m glad to hear he has time to live it.”
Harry bristled. He may have been penniless and an orphan, but he knew he kept clean better than Dudley did.
Harry’s beginning to think Jake isn’t as boring as he seems.
Minutes later he sends his Patronus trotting up to fetch Draco for lunch, feeling that he wouldn’t appreciate Harry yelling up the length of the house. He walks into the kitchen with a pleased flush on his cheeks, his hair in his eyes, and a half drunk mug of tea. Harry wants to see that every day, if he can.
Maybe Malfoy has worked out who he is. Then again, he hasn’t given him much to reply to, so maybe he’s waiting for something more.
“Can I some water?”
The man stood before him was dressed all in black, except for the spotless white cravat noose-tight around his throat. His hair was long and lank, brown fading into grey and tied loosely behind him. He seemed short, even to someone as small as Harry, an impression that wasn’t helped by the way his back stooped over. His diminutive stature didn’t make him any less intimidating. His eyes flickered over Harry, then away, then back again in a way that was disconcerting.
Draco laughs lightly. “Lunch, it sounds like. We can stop off at the kitchens on the way.”
Malfoy’s warmth leaves his body, the only point of contact remaining is the hand cupping his hip. He murmurs two incantations, one after the other, and Harry feels a warmth followed by a tingling inside him. He recognises the feelings as spells for cleansing and protection. Malfoy whispers another spell, and he knows this one intimately. He hears the clatter of Malfoy tossing his wand onto the table, and stretches out his own hands from where they’re pinned underneath him to grip the rounded edge of the table across from him.
This time he’ll only have to face one man, but he doesn’t feel much better about it. Considering the line of questioning, Draco’s biggest secret is bound to spill out. He’ll know that Draco’s in love with Harry. He can only hope that Weasley will keep to the terms of their agreement, and not tell his friend what he knows.
“Sirius,” he whispers.
“Don’t call me Millicent, Draco. No one calls me Millicent anymore.”
“Do you mean today, or…”
Harry pushes his hips back in answer, and Malfoy huffs a laugh, before sinking the digit in up to the knuckle. Harry’s dick almost hurts from where it’s mashed against the table, but he can’t help but be thankful. He probably wouldn’t last if he could rut into a soft bed.
The Sun: Fun, Warmth, Vitality.
He hears Harry’s breath hitch, and wonders if he’s remembering the same thing Draco is. If he’s thinking of the way Draco fingered him open, torturously slow, in a kitchen much like this one.
Draco extends one long finger to trace over the crest of feathers on the bird’s head, his face illuminated with blue and silver. He looks like some forgotten god, ruling among the stars. Harry loves him so much he temporarily forgets how to feel anything, think of anything, else.
“Is that an offer, or just an observation?”
“You put her off men for life, I suppose.”
Just gone noon the next day, there is an angry pounding at his door. For a minute he panics that the Aurors have come to take him away again. He shivers, remembering the few days he spent in a cell in Azkaban, awaiting trial. Maybe someone accused him of putting poison in his cosmetics? Maybe someone’s cat went missing, and they decided he must have killed it for a dark ritual? Or, maybe, he’s being arrested for defiling the wizarding world’s Golden Boy. That’s not a crime, of course, but he doubts everyone will see it that way. They’ll probably pass a new law specifically for it. He takes a deep breath, and goes to the door. He hasn’t done anything wrong. Recently, anyway.
“I mean, that’s a little more in line with what I was thinking when I dragged you in here,” he admits.
A complex set of emotions drift across Malfoy’s face, one after the other, before settling into his usual mask of cool detachment. “Be that as it may, I treat my sexual partners with at least basic respect.”
The dream is different this time. It starts with Draco laughing. He’s leaning into the shop, midday sunshine glinting off his hair and turning it silver and gold. Every colour is brighter, every smell is stronger. Harry can feel the path his blood is taking round his body, how his pulse picks up speed. The movement jerks around him, and he sees a different face. A young witch. Her eyes are round with anger and anxiety, and the blue is so intense it spreads outwards like a beacon. She’s standing over Granny, lying on the floor next to her chair. Granny’s eyes are closed, but the same blue spills out from under the papery skin of her eyelids. The light pools on the floor, becomes water, and floods the room. It rises up, lifting Granny’s body on a wave, and covering his face until he’s drowning.
“And I’ve always been big,” he says. “So, people kind of made assumptions about what I’d be like in bed. And yeah, I did like being on top, but I didn’t want to push anyone around. I didn’t want to be rough, or commanding, or mean. After all that time trying to be a hard man, trying not to feel anything, the first time someone else took charge, held me down and took what they wanted… it was like a light switched on in my head.”
“Competent?” suggests Granny.
“It’s my business too,” he says. “I should be able to talk to my friends about it.”
Then, Draco breathes. Harry is not rejecting him. Probably. Yet. That has to overcome any past humiliation.
First, he shuffles the cards. They’re bigger than a pack of playing cards, and his hands feel clumsy. One falls out of the deck. He goes to pick it up again but Granny shakes her head.
“What? Zabini! We thought you invited him!” says Weasley, listing into Granger’s side.
“Well, not really,” says Draco.
“I can’t talk right now,” says Harry, starting to walk away.
“Draco was pretty new to it when we started,” says Angus. “But fuck if he isn’t a natural.”
Harry had told him about his mother’s ghost, but clearly that was not enough to prepare him for seeing her with his own eyes.
Draco just wants this to be over. He wants Weasley out of his house. Then again, he wants a lot of things he can’t have. You get used to it after a while.
“You thought about this in school?”
His relationship was brilliant, and gentle, and fun, and everything he needed. Until. Until Terran’s mother died of the illness that had been slowly killing her, and he fell apart. He came to Harry late at night, cried into his shoulders, started kissing him through the tears and just didn’t stop. He got more desperate, and Harry got tenser, until he pushed him away. Harry said that they shouldn’t sleep together for the first time when Terran was in that state, and it was true- but it wasn’t the whole truth.
He wants to say
“Deflower? Just how posh are you?”
Weasley leaves with considerably less fanfare than when he arrived, his hostility merely simmering rather than boiling over. Draco slumps down into the large armchair, wishing Potter was in his lap again. Wishing he could bury his nose in his hair, breathe him in, let his anxiety drift away. But he can’t. He’s alone, and he’s just offered to relive something awful. Much like using a pensieve, he hasn’t been under verituserum since his trial, and it’s another experience he didn’t anticipate having to repeat. Being forced to spill all his sins, his fears, his desires, to a panel of unfeeling faces was… harrowing.
She beats her wings, clipping his head as she takes off, and launches into the sky. That night he writes a note, and attaches it to her foot:
“Well I am,” points out Harry.
“I’ll burn this if you’re not careful,” grumbles Harry.
“Are you using magic to manipulate Harry?”
“Ah, Harry! It’s something called a HVS, and Draco was going to explain how it works.”
He can feel his orgasm building, and he just fucks Potter harder. Draco’s head is hanging down, pale hair falling over his eyes, as he comes with a drawn-out moan.
Stepping out of the fireplace and into the Weasley abode, it becomes clear that while Harry alerted Molly and Arthur, the rest of the clan were still in the dark. Scanning his eyes across the shocked faces, he resigns himself to using first names. He can’t call all of them ‘Weasley’.
Granny’s shop is empty when he arrives, of both customers and Granny herself. Earl is there, and he greets him as enthusiastically as ever. He looks into the back room, but that’s empty too. There’s a twisting flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor. Presumably that’s where she lives.
“But you’re reading a book, and all the books in the library belong to Papa.” Dudley took the book and closed it, sneering at the cover. “Not you.”
“Lord,” exclaims Simi. “You’re the same person.”
Draco’s hand stills, squeezing himself. “Are you sure?”
He grimaces. “But I never started seeing anyone. I know.”
“I can’t move,” slurs Draco. “I can’t move.”
“You were upset, you’d just seen your mum. It’s fine.” Harry puts the kettle on reflexively. Tea is always the answer, if not the solution.
“Hey Draco. We’ve just been slagging you off,” says Angus.
Harry smirks, feeling quite pleased with himself, before his face freezes. Fuck, but Draco looks fit. He’s wearing a burgundy silk shirt, the first few buttons undone, showing a hint of delicate collarbone. The colour makes his pale skin look luminous, like marble. Instead of peach, his nails are painted pitch black, and silver rings adorn his fingers. Harry swears there’s a matching silver sheen to his eyelids, and is that… Yes, it is. It’s lip gloss. It makes him look like he’s been kissing for hours, and Harry wants to do just that. Harry ducks his head, a little embarrassed at his reaction.
Arthur nods distractedly, and with a soft ‘good afternoon, boys’, is gone.
Draco leans forward. “They released two different versions of the film, and in one of them he does actually bite it off.”
“Do you want me to tell you what to do?”
“Er, I’ll have a glass of the house white, please,” says Hermione, her eyebrows raising almost to her hairline.
“Such a good boy. Getting on your knees, spreading your legs for me. What a perfect little slut.”
boundaries. Is there anything I shouldn’t do?”
Harry chokes again. Hermione takes his glass away from him, laughing.
“What about the… W.A.N.K Institute? For ‘Wizarding And Non-wizarding Kinship’.”
This time he floos to Draco’s house, rather than apparating. He’s expecting him, so he doubts he’ll mind. It’s just that if he has to make himself knock on the front door, he’ll probably talk himself out of it and run away. He topples out the fireplace and into Draco’s living room, only just gaining his balance at the last second. His host is sat on a large wingback armchair, one long leg crossed primly over the other, reading a book.
“He apologised for…everything, but he hasn’t had a complete personality change. He’s still Malfoy.”
is not the man sitting across from him and making dirty jokes. Maybe it’s time to grow up, he thinks. Hermione would be proud.
I'm currently writing the trickiest chapter of the whole fic. Please pray for me, send good vibes, sacrifice a golden calf, etc. This however, is one of my favourite (and longest) chapters. Let me know what you think!
She shakes her head. “The whole Wizarding world is in a flap trying to work out why none of the ghosts are staying put anymore, but the no one’s connected the dots just yet. I’m sure the Ministry have their best and brightest on the case,” she says, flashing a wry smile over the rim of her cup. “So you have at least another decade before they cotton on.”
Harry looks at him in shock, reluctantly impressed. “How’d you learn to do that?”
“I understand,” says Draco. “I wouldn’t say I’m happy about it, but I understand. Fear can make us do terrible things.”
Weasley looks about the room, as if checking he is actually in Draco Malfoy’s house, and not some bizarre dream world. Finding nothing of comfort, he looks back at Draco. He opens his mouth again, gearing up to ask a barrage of insensitive questions no doubt, but clamps his jaws shut at the last minute.
She hums as she boils water in a saucepan; there is no kettle in the kitchen at all. “Yes, Ginny is here of course.”
After collecting their orders and convincing Draco to stay and save his seat, Harry heads to the kitchen. It’s crowded, people just milling around, and Harry has to weave his way over to the drinks table. First, he grabs a beer for Angus. He thinks about taking another one for himself, but the image of Draco winking at his ex keeps flashing behind his eyes, and he decides he needs something stronger. He mixes himself a rum and coke, heavy on the rum. Draco asked for vodka and cranberry, but when he looks distractedly around the table, he can’t see the juice anywhere.
He opens his eyes as Draco pulls away, and he looks… wrecked. His eyes are wide, and full of something harsh and possessive. His mouth is open, panting, with a dribble of come at the corner of his sore red lips. “Don’t you dare apologise.”
Why not? Did he still feel indebted to Harry? There was the business of him saving him in the room of requirement, and stepping in at his trial. But Harry had almost killed Draco before, and he’d refused to identify him to Bellatrix at the Manor. As far as he’s concerned, they’re even.
“You know, I could help you,” he says.
“Clearly you were right to be worried,” says Hermione, glaring at Ron. “Anyway, it’s your business, and you’re not obligated to tell us everything. That being said, I hope you know you can always talk to me about anything.”
“She’s lovely,” says Harry. He puts Earl back down, so he can hold his hand out to her. She nibbles gently at his thumb, as if hoping for a treat, and his breath catches in his throat. Hedwig used to do the exact same thing.
Harry gasps. He’s present enough in his mind to know that he really should want to punch Malfoy right now, but instead he just cants his hips up, hoping he’ll say it again.
A realisation sparked from the back of Harry’s mind. “The woman with the blue eyes, is she a relative?”
Potter breathes a sigh of relief.
“That’s the one thing?”
Icy light bursts from the wand, something huge and soaring. He gets an impression of expansive wings and longs legs, before it fades between one moment and the next.
“Yeah, yeah,” he says, breathlessly. “Everything’s great. Brilliant. Just need to get an early night.”
His orgasm comes without warning, Draco’s mouth hot and wet around him. He screws his eyes shut even tighter, holding his breath. Draco’s hands flex, then stroke up and down the back of his thighs, before squeezing his arse.
“Are you sure?” he smirks, soft Welsh accent lilting over the teasing words.
This one gets juicy. Additional warnings in the end notes- and let me know what you think so far!
“Yeah.”
Harry licks his lips. “I want to.”
“I can see it on your face; You look shocked, eyes wide behind those ridiculous glasses. Your hair all messy from the fight, even messier than it normally is, and you’re panting. I lean down and whisper in your ear.”
He grabs Draco by the hand and pulls him out into the hall and through the winding manor. He hears Draco making token protests, wondering if he heard anything else he’d said, but he clearly doesn’t mind. Everything really is done, Draco’s fanatical organisation skills winning out over Arthur’s absentminded optimism, and now he’s just fussing. Eventually, Harry leads them through the opposite wing of the Manor to the ballroom. The guests won’t be anywhere near this part of the building tonight, and it’s completely abandoned except for the two of them.
Draco grabs his shoulder before he can get too close. “You heard him- get the fuck out.”
In the living room, Malfoy sits bolt upright on the sofa with Teddy on his lap, holding him by his armpits and staring him at with an expression of terror. “Aunt Andromeda, I’m really not any good at-” He cuts himself off, staring at Harry with a look of blank horror. He quickly schools his expression.
“Do you know, Mr Potter, where sinners go when they die?” He did not wait for an answer, choosing instead to provide one for himself. “They go to a place where fire pools like water, where smoke smells like rot, where chains bind your wrists and ankles. Liars, especially, suffer there.” He nodded to himself then, as if impressed by his own poeticism. “Yes, there is a chamber reserved specifically for the torture of liars. There devils burn the tongue from your throat, before bidding it grow back and starting all over again.”
It’s a quiet corner of the Alley, especially in the middle of a weekday, but even now he can see a few curious onlookers.
Draco reaches round to stroke him just once, before letting his hand drift down to cup his balls. Harry whimpers, grinding back into the hardness he can feel through Draco’s trousers against his bare arse.
“I’ve already called the Healers. Granny might still need them; she’s inside, and she’s hurt.”
Ronald’s mouth gapes open, the orange hue of his hair only serving to make him look even more like a goldfish. “Again?” he hisses, turning to his mother. “He’s here
“Drink this,” he says, and watches while Harry complies. “You know, when I was living as a muggle, I was stumbling from bar to bar trying to find something that would make me forget myself. Booze, sex, anything. I ended up in a leather bar, and I met someone there. I tried to proposition them, but they just got me a glass of water and sat with me until they knew I wasn’t going to throw up. I couldn’t remember how to find my way back to my shitty flat without magic. I didn’t know the city and everything looked the same to me. So, they took me home and let me sleep on their sofa.”
Additional warnings in the ends notes.
“Yes,” says Draco, ducking his head to try and hide his smile. “I’m not telling you what it is though.”
“I’m more than fine.” he says.
“You did so well, darling,” he mumbles into Harry’s skin. “I can’t believe you came without me touching you.”
Ginerva shrugs her shoulders, recovering from her shock almost instantly. “I’ll have a cider thanks, Malfoy. Whatever’s on tap.”
Harry suspects he might be a bit of a freak. Not that he judges Draco for his desires, or anyone else for that matter, but the suspicion is there all the same. That’s what the Dursley’s called him. Freak. Sometimes the niggling voice in his head sounds a bit like Petunia. When things are really bad, he can hear Vernon shouting, see the vein jumping in his face. He can imagine the horror and disgust on their faces just at the thought of Harry sleeping with a man, let alone anything else.
The shy young man says ‘yes’ at the same time that Angus, just as emphatically, says ‘no’. Draco doesn’t say anything yet, and Harry just stares at them in bewilderment.
Draco takes a sip of his tea. “I think we might be, too.”
He glances over the headline, confirming his worst fears. The press has found out about the breakup, and the steaming pile of Hippogriff manure has already moved on, it seems. The picture of Jones leans in to kiss the other man’s cheek, before smiling at the camera, and Draco wants to throttle him. And yet a tiny, horrible part of him feels…relieved.  If Jones has a new boyfriend, that means he won’t be back to darken Potter’s doorstep any time soon. Potter won’t be subjected to the moron’s inconsiderate fumbling, and Draco might be able to keep whatever
Harry clenches his thighs, pulling Draco even closer until the head of his dick brushes against his balls. The rope is starting to burn against his wrists, but he only struggles against it more, torn between wanting his hands on Draco and the way the sting heightens his arousal.
Harry nods. “Yeah, it was about- that.”
Ron kicks him under the table, and goes back to his food.
“What happens in the dream?” asks Ron.
He groans pitifully, and goes over to the kitchen window. He opens it wider, and whistles. Less than a minute later, Bunny flies through and lands on his outstretched arm. He dips under her weight, and she nips his thumb.
“What sort of favour?” asks Hermione, suspicion clouding her face.
“What am I?” asks Blaise. “Chopped liver?”
“I meant it.” He cradles Potter’s face, encouraging him to meet his eyes. “Is that something you want?”
“I knew it! I knew you were faking!” crows Harry.
“That’s just not true. He’s completely witless,” says Malfoy.
“It’s to tell you to stop, isn’t it? Though why can’t we just say ‘stop’?”
, about you working here, Harry. I thought a Seer might be able to help me find the watch, put my Grandpa’s memory to rest. I made an appointment with Granny,” she says, before nodding towards Draco. “It’s like you said yesterday. Granny opens and closes the watch all the time, without even noticing. It’s so distinctive, a purring pocket watch, and I knew it was fate.”
I've split this chapter in two so you don't have to wait as long for an update. Additional warnings in the end notes.
When Harry was twenty years old he danced with Oliver Wood at a charity ball. His skills weren’t much improved since fourth year, despite all the functions he’d been forced to attend. He definitely trod on Oliver’s foot more than once, but the man only laughed. They spent all night reminiscing about their years on the Gryffindor Quidditch team; their improbable wins, bitter defeats, and the trials of captaincy. Near the end of the night, they drifted onto a balcony away from the crowds. They’d both had a lot to drink, and when Oliver joked about Harry choking on the snitch in his first match, he does something unexpected. He tells Oliver about how Dumbledore hid the resurrection stone inside the snitch. How Dumbledore had always known that he would die.
Zabini hands him a glass of red wine and he takes a grateful sip.
He comes back. Malfoy is crouched in front of him, nostrils flared and palms cupping Harry’s face. He blinks, looking around him.
Pulling out the cork, he lets three drops fall on his tongue. Like a poison, it’s completely tasteless, designed for the unsuspecting. Truly, he thinks this might be the evilest potion. Draught of the Living Death. Amortentia. Both are contenders, to be sure. But if you ask Draco, verituserum takes the cake.
“But you love me anyway,” confirms Draco with a rueful smile, eyes still wide in disbelief.
“Can you dig a little further?” she asks with sad eyes.
He shifts from one foot to the other. “I said I would be, but I understand if you want me to leave.”
Harry’s eyes widen, blurring with guilt. “I didn’t mean to lead him on. I wasn’t trying to flirt, or anything.”
“I’ll undress you later,” he says, grinning up at Harry. “But right now, I don’t want to wait.”
“Now now, there’s no need for that,” says the bearded man. “My name is Wolfgang. This is Herbert, and our intern Marla. At your service.” He makes a deep and extravagant bow.
“Not that I’m aware of.”
Harry blushes. “It was pretty amazing. I had a few weird moments, but not during, and he was actually really good about it.”
Draco holds his hand out for Granny to shake, looking like he expects to be turned down, but resolutely keeping it there anyway. “A pleasure to meet you, Ms Lynn.”
Weasley just barges past him into the hallway. Obviously he could have stopped him; even though Weasley is both taller and broader than him, his wards would never allow anyone inside who wasn’t welcome. Although, ‘welcome’ might be stretching it a bit. ‘Grudgingly admitted for Harry’s sake’ would be more accurate.
He takes his time preparing him. Distantly, Harry thinks Malfoy’s back must be aching from staying in this position for so long. Leaning over, bent down to watch as his fingers are sucked into Harry’s body. He knows he’s watching, because he can feel his gaze like a physical touch, almost as powerful as the one inside him.
“I didn’t think. The only thing I knew about him was that he was a Death Eater, and he was casting something at me. I didn’t know it was just an
He thumbs Potter’s bottom lip, dragging it down. He sucks the tip of Draco’s thumb inside his mouth, nibbling a little.
“And was it okay? Did he treat you alright?” grills Ron.
. Then he can’t think of a reason not to say it, so he does. Draco leans down. Oh Merlin, he's leaning down, is he going to kiss him? Harry cranes his head up at an awkward angle to reach him, he doesn’t want to disturb whatever is happening by standing up. Draco's grey eyes are dark, determined. They should look like granite, but instead they look liquid. Like they could swallow him whole.
At one point in the night, he starts ordering sugary cocktails for him and Potter. Draco’s reasons are threefold. One, they taste fucking fantastic. Two, Potter’s face when he sets them in front of him is priceless. Three, he gets to watch Potter’s mouth wrapped around a straw. He knows he’s getting less and less subtle as the night wears on, and Potter’s own subtlety was wearing thin to start with. They’re both drunk, but so is nearly everyone else.
“I don’t know. At first I wanted to have sex with Ma- this guy- so I could make things work with Terran.” Wait.
Now he’s a grown man, and all his fantasies are coming to life, only better. Draco takes a deep, steadying breath, and reminds himself that this isn’t a fantasy. He’s not alone with his thoughts; he has someone else to think about.
“Yeah.”
He keeps drinking. If this dream is telling him that Draco is going to die, he has to know. He has to know so he can stop it. Harry’s eyelids grow heavy. He hears the slight squeak of Granny’s chair as she wheels herself onto the staircase, and the low hum of the steps flattening and spiraling upwards, but now his eyes have closed. Harry stays awake long enough to be thankful that she left him in privacy- sometimes he flinches in his sleep.
He huffs. “I do talk a lot of rubbish when I’m having sex.”
He peels his fingers off the desk one at a time, and turns to face Potter. His eyes are wide, anxious, and Draco desperately wants to make him smile again. He walks back over and climbs onto the bed again, pulling Potter into his arms. His words never seem to make anything better, in fact they often make things worse, but he knows how to do this. Draco rests his cheek on top of Potter’s head, stroking a hand through his hair.
“Anyway, I’d always liked reading, so I joined the book club. The woman in charge was Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies professor.”
“Really?” says Harry, incredulous. “But it’s so much work. You could do this as a career, if you wanted.”
Harry opens his mouth to reply but all that comes out is a yawn. “It’s eleven o’clock in the morning, why am I this tired?”
“Alright, I heard you, no need to be an arsehole,” says Weasley.
“It’s nothing. Just a fight with Terran.”
Draco stands abruptly, and wipes his hands on his trousers. “Okay then. We’ve still got lots to talk about, so we should probably get comfortable. Finish your bath and I’ll meet you in the kitchen.”
“So,” says Granny, plonking two mugs of tea onto the table and sweeping the cards out of the way. “I see death is on your mind.”
Harry smiles, but doesn’t correct him.
“Granny, I need to ask you a favour,” he says, having returned Earl to her after their walk.
“And sometimes… I just go somewhere else. I leave my body for a bit and I don’t know what’s happening around me. It’s hard to let my guard down, after everything, but I don’t want to be making all the decisions either,” he adds.
“Yes, well, my father put me up to it.” Malfoy sighs. “I should apologise to Hagrid I suppose. At this rate I’ll never finish saying sorry to everyone I should.”
Harry throws his head back, imagining it. Fuck, but it’s filthy. Something inside him preens at the idea, of being Draco’s so completely. Draco hasn’t even touched Harry’s cock, but his prostrate is being struck repeatedly, and his orgasm crests and breaks like a wave. He thinks he’s probably saying something, something like
“Sorry,” he says, rolling off to lay shoulder to shoulder with Harry.
“Sit down,” says Draco gently, pulling him down to sit on his knees. Not straddling, but with his back half against the armrest and half against Draco’s chest, legs draping across him.
Harry closes his eyes, basking in the praise. It’s somehow even more powerful knowing that someone else can hear it.
“I don’t mind talking about it,” he says. “It was good. Hard, obviously, but good.”
“Besides, I don’t have a ward room like yours, with all the machinery and stuff.”
“Alright,” chuckles Draco. “Alright.”
Draco dishes up at the counter, and brings the plates over. “See? No snails.”
“I don’t think so, darling. Open your eyes and answer me. Which one?”
have non-kinky sex and enjoy it. A lot. But he still wants Draco to use him like he owns him.
When Draco reaches his throat, he takes a deep breath through his nose, and swallows, letting him in.
“If you dare come back here, I’ll do things to you that’ll make you wish you’d snapped your wand and went to live as a muggle before you ever even heard the
“Then how did you know it’s the same place?”
He doesn’t say anything else, doesn’t make any verbal jabs or jokes like he might have if they were alone. What he does do is run his foot from the inside of Harry’s ankle and up his leg, in clear retaliation. Harry thinks he would have preferred a stinging hex; pain would be easier to hide than his squeak of panicked arousal.
“I think this is yours,” says Draco. He lets go of Harry’s hand to reach into his pocket, taking out the pocket watch out to give to Granny. “I’m sorry it’s broken.”
Draco refused to live in a city, and especially not London. He had access to his vault now, and could afford to be picky. He chose a cottage, a rather twee looking cottage, partly because he thought it was ironic. He could imagine a sweet old witch living there, the sort who gave sweeties to children and knitted jumpers for cats. Still, he liked it, in a weird way. He wanted something different, too.
“I wouldn’t say that, old chap. Tell me what you’ve done and we’ll figure it out.”
“You need to go to bed,” says Draco.
“What was your plan?” he asks. “Torture me into confessing?”
Harry’s face is cold. Frightening. Draco loves him more than anything.
“I’d count, but it would take too long.”
He stands and takes hold of Harry’s wrist, pulling him up. Keeping hold of him, grip not tight but still firm, he leads Harry to the bedroom. His breathing is coming faster, nervous anticipation coursing through him. Draco guides Harry to stand in front of the bed, closing the door behind him, and finally lets go of his arm.
“Don’t what? Tell the truth? I could kill that idiot boyfriend of yours for not treating you better.”
Harry nods, but still strokes up his sternum to his collarbone, before retracing the path with his mouth. Draco grasps Harry’s hair in his hands, and moves under the spray, pressing him against the cold tiles. Water darkens his silvery hair, slicking it back against his head, running down his neck and onto Harry’s tongue. Draco pulls Harry’s head back until it knocks against the wall and kisses him with a cruel and selfish tongue.
Harry holds out his arm, and they disapparate.
Is he? He doesn’t know. Now that he thinks about it his face does seem wet, but surely that could be from when his hair was still dripping. He opens his mouth to deny it, but all that comes out is a sob. Between his legs, his dick is still heavy and sensitive. How can he be crying and aroused at the same time? There truly is something deeply wrong with him.
Arthur shakes his head. “I would ask what happened here, but I don’t think that would be helpful or productive. Let’s just see what we can do about it.”
“So,” says Angus. “How long have you and Draco been a thing?”
Harry furrows his brows in thought. “Family. New, unexpected family.”
“You know how I used to see into Voldemort’s head sometimes, or even Nagini’s? Well, that was something I saw,” he admits.
Draco leans back, removes his hands from Harry’s body, and gets a little more serious. “After the shower that time, the way you reacted to me taking care of you was intense. Do you want to try something like that, in this context?”
Their eyes meet across the living room, and they share a look of panic. They’re united in that, at least. Harry doesn’t know how to act around him outside of the context of a bedroom. Or a shower. Or a kitchen table. He doesn’t know if their tentative comradery can carry them through a conversation where they can’t use their hands and mouths to smooth the rough edges. He takes a deep breath. At seventeen he dove to the bottom of a freezing lake to retrieve the Sword of Gryffindor. He can do this. Never mind he nearly drowned while being strangled by a locket, that’s not currently helpful to the positive attitude he’s attempting to cultivate.
Harry turns to face them. “She’s not like that, Hermione. She’s ten times better than Trelawney.”
Draco blinks, startled out of the strange trance he’d found himself in. He shouldn’t have teased Potter like that- there’s no way he’s ready to go again.
Harry nearly sprays his last mouthful of whisky, clapping a hand over his mouth just in time. “Christ, Malfoy.”
In the midst of his panic, there are three clear raps on the door. Harry collects himself with a deep breath. Is he a Gryffindor or not? Blind faith and emotional repression are what they do. He opens the door to Draco, who stands a little way back, looking up at the building with curiosity. In his hand is a leather holdall, likely containing the instruments needs to study the wards properly.
Draco keeps stroking his rumpled hair until he falls asleep. He must be exhausted. Potter’s sleeping on top of him, and he uses that as an excuse to stay. If he moved, he’d wake him, and he clearly needs the rest.
Harry speaks through gritted teeth. “Terran, get out.”
“So you don’t trust me not to dose Potter with potions, but you do trust me not to poison you. Again.” Draco sucks on his bleeding lip, before releasing it. “Sorry about that, by the way.”
“What memory do you think about when you’re casting? If you don’t mind telling me, that is.”
Granny smiles. “To be my apprentice, of course.”
“Simi,” warns Draco.
He can’t see any, so he fetches his wand and
With that, a familiar expression blossomed on Dudley’s pale face. It’s the expression he wore when he was aware Harry had just said something insolent, but wasn’t intelligent enough to work out exactly why it was insulting. This combination of anger and embarrassment unfailingly resulted in violence. The book came down on hard on Harry’s forehead, splitting his scar and making it look new for the first time in his memory.
“I should have known you’d have a praise kink,” he declares, laying his head back on the pillow. “You’ve gotten so used to everyone fawning over you, no wonder you can’t come without it.”
Potter’s chest is heaving, breathless. “Is sex always this good? Or do you get used to it, after a while.”
Five of Wands: Conflict, Competition, Tension.
Number Twelve Grimmauld Place had been the scene of countless meetings for the Order of the Phoenix, and they all took place around the kitchen table. The wood is dark, with deep gouges sanded over but still visible, like curse marks that couldn’t be fully repaired. There are still dishes in the sink, and Harry sets them cleaning with a twirl of his wand. He always forgets to do it. The light is low, but warm, reflecting off the shiny brass handles that adorn each cupboard.
“Which thing?”
Potter nods in agreement, and Draco summons into his hand the bottle of water he’s left on the coffee table for this exact purpose. Draco gives him the bottle, but his hands are shaking too much to open it, so he takes the bottle back. Twisting off the lid, Draco cradles the back of his head and holds it to his lips. He doesn’t tilt it too far, keeping control of the flow of water, making sure Potter doesn’t drink too fast and make himself sick.
“Well,” he says, clearing his throat. “I’d have just said something very clever and highly insulting. You’d attack me, and we’d tussle. I’d be winning of course,”
What should he tell him? I’ve been having nightmares and now I think something bad is going to happen to you, so I want you to get your fortune told by an old lady I’ve only known a week? That won’t go down well. Harry’s stomach grumbles. In trying to escape Narcissa he’d left without breakfast, and it was well past noon.
Draco moves to help him, undoing the buttons faster than Harry’s shaking fingers. His shirt hangs off his shoulders, but their pressed to close together. Then his hands go to Harry’s stomach, the touch to his sensitive skin making him jolt upwards.
Harry clutched the letter to his chest, holding his breath so Dudley wouldn’t hear him breathing from behind the curtain. Dudley continued to taunt him for a minute or two, before all fell silent. Harry sighed, relaxing his shoulders from where they’d climbed up to bracket ears.
He feels a hand on his back.  He leans back into it, the touch that had been so terrifying moments ago now so comforting. Encouraged by his response, arms wrap around him.
“Come on,” says Harry. “Let’s see how far Teddy can throw his food.”
Thank you for all the lovely comments- they really keep me going.
my book from the settee over there, but I dropped it half way through.” Harry looks over and sees there is indeed a book lying on the floor. “You might have noticed I rarely use my wand.”
They stay like that for what could be minutes or hours, Harry doesn’t know. What he does know is that every third turn of the page, Draco checks he’s still with him. He strokes his hair, murmurs to him. He kisses his temple, strokes his thumb across his cheekbone, looking into Harry’s half-lidded eyes. Asking a silent question that Harry finds a way to just as soundlessly answer. Sometimes with a nuzzle into the starched fabric of Draco’s shirt, sometimes just with a sigh and lazy look. He probably would have fallen asleep without these peaceful disruptions, feeling so safe, because he knows Draco always takes care of his things.
“Oh, so
Draco does so, and the sound of Narcissa’s song fills the room. Her voice is low, with a slight wavering quality. The words wash over them, both stirring and soothing something inside him.
They had kissed a while, after they finished the last time, but eventually Harry had decided to go home. He was too sore to go again, and he didn’t want to overstay his welcome. It had been almost amicable, by that point. Someone who didn’t know Draco might have even called him cheerful as he escorted Harry to the door.
He gives her a grim smile. “Thanks.”
Ron clears his throat. “I know we’re talking about Malfoy’s… feelings, or whatever, but I think we skipped over something pretty bloody massive.”
She comes to stand over him, folding her arms. Her silky black hair falls over her heavily-lined eyes, her lips a suggestive shade of red.
“A few times,” nods Harry.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose. “This isn’t the time for that argument, so I’m going to leave that for now. “He scrubs a hand over his face. “Can you tell me what happened?”
“Very good,” nods Draco. “Now we just have to find it.”
Draco sees a memory of Harry's assault from chapter one.
There’s another buzzing response. Harry has to stop himself from wriggling on Draco’s dick. Someone, somewhere, knows exactly what a slut he’s being for Draco right now.
He comes midsentence, like Harry before him, sighing against the wet skin of his back. They just breath for a minute, Draco softening on Harry’s leg.  Then, Draco starts to wash him. His hands are so gentle, such a contrast to the frantic energy of the moment before. When he’s done Harry’s back half he turns him round by his waist, still so, so gently. He reaches out and grabs a bottle from a shelf, pouring a small amount of shampoo in his hand and reaching up to lather Harry’s hair. There’s no scent, and for a moment Harry regrets that; he want to smell like Draco. Like he belongs to him.
“I don’t! Besides, you don’t need to be jealous Ron, King is definitely gay.”
Harry’s heart clenches like a fist. “Of course I care.”
There are customers in the shop when he arrives. There’s a woman in the waiting room flicking through the archaic issue of Witch Weekly, and a man’s voice is coming from the back room. Earl Grey’s sleeping in a patch of sunlight slanting through the window, curled up like a cat.
“But I thought they were of stuff that was happening right then, with Voldemort?”
Draco’s fingers tighten in Harry’s hair, sending sparks across his skin. Harry has to bite his lip to hold back a moan.
“Do you want to feed the ducks, Teddy?” he asks the baby, looking down into the buggy he’s rolling along the path. Teddy makes a babbling sound, his hair flashing yellow for a moment. He understands a lot of what is being said to him, and Harry guesses he’ll be saying his first words in no time.
Ron stays silent, his mouth agape.
Draco’s eyes grow wicked. “That depends, darling. Would you like me to punish you?”
“Fuck.” He licks over his teeth to check none have been knocked out, tasting blood. Just a split lip it seems. “Fucking hell.”
“You have such a sweet mouth, darling.” He keeps rocking his hips, voice low enough not to break the hush that’s fallen over the room. “Does it want to be filled, too?”
Harry winds his hands together. “Is Draco going to die?”
Harry resists the urge to glower. “Yes, killing dark wizards, I know.”
“It wasn’t me,” mumbles Harry. “It was the cat.”
Trigger Warnings:
Harry holds his palm out flat, and Draco hands him his wand. The hawthorn wand seems to buzz with recognition. He raises it to his temple, and pulls out a string of silver memory.
As he adjusts to his surroundings, blinking open his eyes, he sees a faint outline standing over Draco. The curtains are still closed, and the light is soft, but he sees Narcissa’s hand tracing over her son’s face. She’s more transparent than she’s ever been; like a bubble in glass, only visible from the way it disrupts the view. She whispers something Harry can barely catch, though she could have been trying to shout.
He feels Draco’s huff of amusement against his cheek. “Please what?”
he thinks.
“Shove up then, Malfoy.”
“You’re here,” says Harry, gaping. Like an idiot. Like a moron.
The next day, disaster strikes. If there’s a less melodramatic way of putting it, Draco can’t think of it. Monday’s
“I didn’t have a plan, per se, but it definitely didn’t involve you making me lunch.”
“Did you read the article?” Terran asks.
“Are you crying?”
Harry nods, almost shaking with adrenaline. He expects him to approach, but instead he goes to Harry’s desk chair, turning it to face the centre of the room before sitting down. Crossing one leg over the over, Draco leans back and folds his arms. He fixes Harry with a penetrating stare.
“We did a lot of clearing out when the Order was here, got rid of a lot of nasty stuff.”
“Should I be worried?” asks Harry, looking to the others.
It’s perfect. It’s perfect, and
Six months after he had his wand back, Draco moved out. Simi had another friend who was looking for somewhere to live, and he saw the opportunity for what it was. Simi made Draco promise that they would try and see each other at least once a week, and so far he’d managed to keep it.
“I’ll ask him,” he says.
“I don’t know exactly
“You don’t have to do anything. I’ll be fine, you don’t need to- look after me, or anything. Normally I’d say you could just leave, but this is your house, so.”
“I didn’t forget. If you ever stop responding, if I have even the slightest suspicion something is wrong, I will check with you. Just like I have been doing.”
“Please don’t encourage this, ‘Mione. I don’t want to hear it,” moans Ron.
The dog begins to tug at Harry’s own trouser leg, this time with more success. He crouches down, and twists the collar around until he could read the tag.
Draco presses a kiss to his temple, his arms tightening around him. He doesn’t talk for a long time, and neither does Harry. They just sit there like that, on the floor, until Harry uncurls a little.
He feels a hand on his cheek, and distantly recognises that someone is talking.
Another Draco chapter! In all his soft, anxious, bitchy glory.
“Perhaps my Draco should take you shopping, he has quite the eye for style,” she says, inspecting her nails.
Draco’s hand tightens on his hip as he brings the phone back to his ear. “Hi Simi, I’m in a bit of a situation right now. You see, I’ve got this pretty boy sitting on my cock, waiting for me to do whatever I want with him.”
She waves him off. “I’m fine, It’s just a cold. These things just hit you harder at my age.”
Harry sighs. “It really is stupid.”
“I knew you wouldn’t just leave me to suffer,” smiles Ron.
“One minute, I’m not ready.” They turn to see Harry hovering in the doorway, and winking cheekily. “Oh, hello there. Come on in, I’ll be out in a sec.”
Harry rubs back against him. “Do it. I want to make you feel good, too.”
“I don’t mean stop entirely,” he says, rolling his eyes. “But if you don’t want this to end up like every other misbegotten fumble you’ve had we need to do this right.”
Granny sips her tea. “Did you know a cat’s purr has a healing, soothing property? Science says it’s something to do with vibrations, but you can’t deny the element of companionship, the restorative power of just being there together.”
“No reason,” says Harry, fiddling with the sleeve of his crumpled jacket. “I just thought it would be nice. Molly and Arthur really like you, you know.”
“Tell me how it feels when I praise you.” He runs the hand that isn’t on his knee through Harry’s hair. “How does it feel when I tell you how good you are, how beautiful.”
They both get to their feet, Jones a little gingerly, Draco’s pleased to note.
Now it’s Harry’s turn to raise his eyebrows. He can’t raise one at a time, which bothers him no end.
No, he doesn’t know what to say to make things better- but he knows who might.
Most Friday nights Harry has dinner with Ron and Hermione. They take it in turns to go to each other’s houses, and this time it’s their turn. Thankfully, Ron is cooking. Hermione never burns anything, but she’s never gotten the hang of balancing flavours, so everything is either too bland or else it scours your tastebuds.
“I don’t know how I keep getting so lucky,” says Harry, resting his forehead against Draco’s.
They make their way through damp corridors filled with upturned chairs and ripped portraits. It looks like Grimmauld place after Snape had ransacked it. Malfoy looks straight ahead, only breaking his focused stride to avoid the random detritus in his path. He’s still thin, made up of edges, but significantly taller than when Harry saw him last.
As Harry walks Earl up Diagon Alley, he thinks about Malfoy. No one could say they’re the best of friends, but he certainly doesn’t hate him anymore. He’d testified on their behalf at Malfoy and Narcissa’s trial, but it’s possible there’s still some resentment there. After all, he hadn’t vouched for Lucius. Perhaps Malfoy blamed Harry for his father’s imprisonment? Either way, a direct approach to helping him would probably not go over well. How do you help someone without seeing them? Maybe he could write a letter.
Harry stares into one of the mugs and jabs the teabag aggressively with a spoon. “Did you believe what you said? Do you really think I want to be friends with you because of the life debt?”
“Why don’t you try it?”
He kisses Harry’s shoulder. “Alright, Potter?”
Finally, Draco surfaces from the pensieve, gripping the edge of the desk. He doesn’t turn around. The line of his shoulders is tense, his knuckles turning white.
“When I came to visit you, you kept getting it out and opening and closing it again. I don’t think you even noticed.”
“It’s impossible for anyone to know everything,” says Draco, putting a big steaming mug of tea in front of Harry. He takes a burning sip. It’s perfect.
that obvious. Surely he can’t be, otherwise everyone would know already.
He sighs, and strokes Draco’s back. He could wait. He could give it time and see how things go. Or. Or he could try and woo the pants off of Draco Malfoy. Well. He never was one for slow and steady. And they’ve already slept together, surely asking him on a date can’t be so scary? Harry swallows, opens his mouth, and closes it again. He was wrong. It’s terrifying.
to see a memory, and likely not one he’d share with just anyone.
Harry nods and takes his hand.
He thinks of a flash of green light over his crib and says “Death.”
He turns to Potter. “We saw each other more recently, though.”
scruffy pair of jeans with holes in’. It’s bound to hurt his head.”
He had to get out of there. “I’m leaving.”
“Anyway, I’ve been thinking-”
She chuckles. “You didn’t have to make me one.”
“Well,” he says. “Are you going to let me in?”
Draco smirks. “Well, if you want to make it up to me…” He returns to his task, pulling Harry’s shirt up and over his head. “That’s better.”
“You really should talk to Ron and Hermione in person,” says Harry. “I promise she won’t hit you again.”
He nods, and hastily sits down in the imposing armchair. She reminds him of a terrifying mix of Molly and McGonagall. “Yes, Mrs Lynn. Sorry.”
“What about tonight?” Potter looks sheepish, as if he’s asking for too much. “I’m at Ron and Hermione’s tomorrow, and if we wait much longer, I’ll go mad thinking about it.”
Harry swallowed. If this was a relative, he didn’t see much familial resemblance. Then again, Aunt Petunia and himself looked nothing alike, either. Harry resolved to let the man speak before he made any judgements. He was determined to like this man, to go away with him and never see the Dursley’s again.
When Harry helped rebuild Hogwarts, he found a passion he didn’t know he had. Restoring magical buildings. It didn’t come to him naturally; it wasn’t like the first time he rode a broom. Nor was it like pulling teeth the way learning Occlumency had been. It was much more like Remus teaching him to cast a Patronus. It was hard, but necessary, so he pushed through until he got results. And the results were life changing. He understood Hogwarts, his first home, like he never had before. Harry found he could communicate with the castle, that magical buildings grew more and more sentient over time, and could cooperate with their own restoration. Harry was hooked. He could take something beautiful and wondrous and damaged, and he could heal it. And now, he has to heal the Manor.
“Do you know what caused it?”
“No need to apologise,” says the man. “My fault entirely.”
“I didn’t always. Feels like I nearly fell to my death every other match.”
Decided to update two chapters in one day thanks to the speedy work of my beta Dia3012 (@dreamerthinker on tumblr)
They make their way back over to Draco and Angus together. The older man Jake and Tabby had been talking to earlier seems to have claimed Harry’s seat.
“A sub? Yeah.”
He thinks fast. “Granny, you know. She’s been telling me to look after myself better.”
Malfoy hums, and pulls him closer. “Seriously, Potter. How are you? I don’t
It’s a good picture. Draco wants to break something.
Harry stares a little. Simi is stunning, in a confusing sort of way. Their hair, that they’d apparently been struggling with, looks immaculate. It’s a deep, hickory brown, and it would have been down to their shoulders if it wasn’t twisted into an elaborate braid. Their eyes are almost black they’re so dark, hooded and heavy, lined with Kohl. There’s a subtle hook to their nose, sharpening the roundness of their face. Simi’s tall, taller than Draco even, though much slighter. They’ve painted their lips a deep shade of purple, almost black, and he wonders if they’re the one who encouraged Draco to experiment with makeup. If so, he’d like to shake their hand.
Malfoy shudders a breath. “Thought swallowing was a bit much for a first time.”
“Do you like bagels?”
Harry rolls his eyes and buries his fingers in his boyfriend’s dark blonde hair, but something snags on the back of his neck. Gently, Harry pulls it out. “A leaf?”
Harry lowers his eyes. “I want you to hold me down, and leave bruises in the shape of your fingers. I want to get on my knees again and let you fuck my face until I choke. I want you to tie me up so I can’t move, so you can do anything you want to me.” He forces himself to look Draco in the eye. “Really, I just want you to use me.”
“You didn’t darling, that not’s what I meant,” he says, fussing at Harry’s hair. “I meant when he said I didn’t own you, and you kissed me right after. To everyone else, it looked like you were saying I did own you. That’s why he asked me if I’d ‘share’ you- he thought you belonged to me.”
Zabini narrows his eyes. “I’ve said enough. Ask him yourselves if you want to know.”
hand. “Hey, I’m Simi.”
He can’t bring himself to regret saying it. Yes, it feels almost like a confession. It feels a little too close to
In the kitchen, he slathers the bagels with cream cheese and smoked salmon, the way Simi’s mother showed him. Draco puts the plates down on the same table that he fucked Potter on, and wonders if Weasley would punch him again if he told him that. He won’t tell him, but it’s still fun to think about. They start eating, the tart flavours balancing perfectly with the mellow chewiness of the bread. Draco observes the man in front of him, happily chewing away, except for the slight crease still between his brows.
Harry backs up and starts to stand, meaning to collapse onto the bed next to Malfoy, but Malfoy’s expression changes slightly. Becomes cooler, back to his usual calm. He stands up, casts a cleaning charm over them both, and rearranges his clothing. Harry sits down, feeling heavy all of a sudden.
Ron collapses back into his chair as if he’s a puppet whose strings have been cut.
“Sorry,” shrugs Samuel, though he’s not looking all that penitent.
Well, he did ask him to talk. “Please Draco, I need you. I need you inside me.” He sees Draco’s eyes flash, and lets all his dirtiest thoughts spill from his mouth without filter. “I need it again. I felt so full, so good.”
Draco slinks off after them with his tail between his legs, mouthing ‘sorry’ at Harry as he goes.
Nine of Swords: Indecision, Truce, Blocked Emotions.
The toy doesn’t stop when he does, and Potter just keeps sucking through it. He opens his eyes a crack, showing a sliver of green, and looks up at Draco. Sliding out carefully, he feels the come dribbling out after him. He reaches up to stop the toy moving, but when he tries to take it away, Potter shakes his head.
“I really am fine,” says Harry, who’s finally stopped crying. He wipes the tears from his eyes with the back of his fist. “God, I’m sorry, this is so stupid.”
Potter, saint that he is, obliges. Grinding himself against Draco’s thigh like a teenager, his breath hot and damp. Draco kisses his neck, letting him feel the sharpness of his teeth before he sucks a rose-shaped bruise into the skin. Potter guides his chin up, and kisses him forcefully, shamelessly. It’s only when he feels the wet spot through the fabric that he realises that Potter’s finished just like that, making his trousers filthy.
“There’s something I should probably tell you, though.”
“What do you want?” he grunts, climbing down from the ladder.
“We couldn’t let the old man stand, he could keel over at any minute,” says Angus.
He’s cast this spell so many times, he can see it even before he opens his eyes. The delicate hooves, the branching antlers, the expressive eyes. That is not what he sees now. It flies from his wand, long legs tucked under its white body, its neck a graceful line.  A bird. Not his stag, not something that came from him. This is the piece of Draco that has buried it’s way into his heart, and built itself a nest there. These eyes aren’t soft and warm like a deer’s; they’re bright, curious, and slightly sharp. It’s circular flight curves and swoops down to towards him, and he holds out his arm like he would for an owl. It lands, but he doesn’t feel any weight.
“It’s tasteful.” Draco frowns. “Is this the old Black house?”
“I’ve got a salve that’ll help, if you want,” he offers.
“Yeah? And what would make your emotions feel supported?”
. Often referred to as the Volcano Curse.
“I’m here,” Harry pants. “I’m here.”
Draco snorts. “What are you on about? We had it at school all the time.”
The living room is crowded now, almost all the available seats taken, and somehow Harry finds himself seated opposite Draco. His eyes flick to Harry, as if seeking support, or an out. He shrugs, apologetic, and Draco looks away again. Hermione looks as if she very much wants to be calm about this, but very much isn’t. Ron looks like he’s been walloped in the face with a frying pan.
Clutched in Draco’s free hand is Granny’s pocket watch, but it isn’t purring anymore. The broken chain pools on the cobbles, and starts to move like a tail. It starts to hiss. Harry picks it up, hoping that this strange object somehow has the power to save Draco. The links break apart, and where the metal snaps, a silver mist leaks out. Metal turning so cold it burns his fingers, Harry drops the watch. The mist rises, like steam from a kettle, and begins to form the shape of a cat. The spectre lands on its feet, and turns to face the woman. She’s shocked and pale, watching the scene unfold. She looks younger than before, really not much older than him. Out of her depth.
Luna’s voice is soft and floaty as ever when she greets him. “I wondered if I’d see you today, Draco. I dreamt of you last night, you see.”
Narcissa nods in confirmation.
As usual, Draco wakes up first. He blinks up at the ceiling, wondering how it got to a point where they have a ‘usual’. His head is pounding but he barely feels it, memory flooded with images of last night. For once, he doesn’t have to drag Harry into consciousness.
“Not exactly, but I think he’s more comfortable talking about other people’s feelings than his own, you know?”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “No? Then prove it.”
“I was trying to
The alley sits behind a quaint pub called
, thinks Harry, but that’s not what he says. “Yes, sir.”
Harry’s expression is indecipherable. He’s probably getting ready to make a hasty exit, but now that Draco’s broken the dam, he can’t seem to stop it all rushing out.
“I- I don’t know,” stammers Harry, unnerved by the question and the compliment alike. “I don’t think so; Simi invited me.”
Potter rolls onto his back, and blinks at him mulishly. “It’s too early.”
“Harry,” says Draco, jumping slightly. “I didn’t hear you come up. This is Isla Black, she helped add to the wards.”
Draco leads him down wide corridors filled with sulky portraits, and Harry finally notices what he’s wearing. Once again his clothes are muggle, a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up and charcoal trousers, but the biggest difference is that he is covered in dust. The front of his hair and his face are clean, as if he’d given them a cursory wipe before coming to the door, but the back of his head and the rest of his clothes are coated in a fine grey powder.
He doesn’t ask how Harry knows that. Probably, he doesn’t want to give Harry the opportunity to show off. And Harry finds he wants to show off a little bit. Well, maybe that’s the wrong choice of words. Part of Harry wants to impress him. He’s going to be repairing his childhood home, and he wants to prove he knows what he’s doing. Just imagining Malfoy refusing to work with him sets his teeth on edge, and an imperceptible thrill ringing in his blood.
Malfoy starts steering him further into the house.
When a burly, dark haired man arrives, Draco nudges him with his elbow. “This is one of people I wanted you to meet,” he says, before waving to the man.
some of it. “Thanks for inviting me.”
He lines their cocks up with each other, and strokes them both at once. Harry is almost completely soft now.
Hermione takes a sip of her drink and gags, before spitting it out again. “Oh god, I hate milk.”
Abruptly, Draco sits up, and taps his wand against the ropes binding Harry’s wrists. They unravel, and Draco massages along Harry’s arms and shoulders before he brings them down, stopping them from cramping. Rubbing a thumb over the red marks, he inspects Harry’s wrists. Satisfied, he flicks his wand and summons two glasses that come zooming in from the kitchen. He fills them with a careless
Harry yawns again, screwing up his eyes and bringing a fist to his mouth.
Harry smiles. “Can I use your shower?”
“Morning,” groans Harry, pink creases on his cheek from where it was pressed into the pillow.
Well fuck. Thank god that happened because otherwise Harry Potter might just have kissed Draco Malfoy, and there’s no way Harry Potter wants to kiss Draco Malfoy. It just doesn’t make sense. He looks at Draco, covered in dirt, with the most affronted expression he’s ever seen on someone younger than eighty, and all he wants to do is wipe the grime from his face. Just to be able to touch him.
Harry opens the fridge and pulls out two ice cold cans of beer. “Quick thinking. What are you getting her?
“Care to elaborate, sir?” squeaks a voice from his left. The man from the prophet is back, this time flanked by a tall and bearded man, and a girl about his age who’s scribbling in a notebook.
“Okay, you’re on speaker phone.”
“We don’t know that I will, but there’s in harm in trying, is there?”
Draco smiles and says “Good, keep talking like that,” before taking him up to the entrance of his throat in one staccato movement.
“Rut against me,” he whispers. “Show me how desperate you are.”
He doesn’t want to think. He also doesn’t want to get pissed and end up plastered over the front page of the
They nod. “Then I’ve got just the girl for you.” They swoop away into the maze of shelves and cages, and return with an owl riding on their shoulder. She’s large, with feathers in as many shades of brown as a tree in autumn, and deep orange eyes. She would be a very elegant looking bird, if it weren’t for the ridiculous looking tufts on her head. They stick up like a rabbit’s ears, giving her a permanent air of surprise.
Harry hums. “It’ll be easier now Neville’s greenhouse is finished. I might even take a few days off.”
Narcissa sits by his bed, her arms folded. At the window, Bunny keeps tapping her beak against the glass.
Ginny laughs, and motions for him to come through. “Aren’t you always?”
“I don’t know,” says Blaise. “I’ve been known to ride when the occasion calls for it.”
“Let me look,” said Aunt Petunia.
He knows he blushes, as Draco affectionately ribs him about it all the time, but knowing and seeing are two very different things. And Harry is seeing it now. The dusky pink isn’t satisfied with his cheeks. No, it sprawls out across his collarbones and down his chest as well. He’s painfully embarrassed. His body is always going to look a little skinny, a little scrawny, no matter how much he exercises; there’s only so much you can do to counteract childhood malnutrition. His hair is always going to be a bird’s nest, but at least he’s made his peace with that. However, staring down your own erect cock is never going to feel comfortable.
When Draco comes, he kisses Potter like this is the first time they’ve ever touched. Like Draco hasn’t been inside of him for almost two hours. Then Potter opens his mouth and turns the kiss into something else. He finally slips out, but he hardly notices.
“How very maudlin, Harry. You are right, though.” She holds Teddy close to her chest, and buries her nose in his hair. “We were very close once, you know.”
“Really?” asks Weasley.
She smiles mysteriously. “I have my ways.”
4: I'm so grateful for all my readers, and I couldn't have done it without you. Thank you so much for all the kudos and comments that have kept me going, and an extra special thanks to MoonGirlPL for her cheerleading and artwork. This chapter is dedicated to you!
“There, darling, isn’t that just what you needed?”
“Believe what?”
At some point Draco seems to have slipped into present tense. It looks like that fantasy isn’t as distant as he pretended. He reaches behind him and guides that thumb further down until it brushes at his hole. Draco’s eyes darken, and he dips inside.
The girl turns red as she writes that down, word for word, but stays silent. The man in the green fedora grins maniacally.
The other finger joins the first, still only up to the knuckle. It doesn’t hurt yet, but Harry knows they’ll need more than spit to prepare him properly.
“Let me help you with that,” says Samuel, taking the bottle of beer as well as his own drink.
Malfoy smirks. “But then I wouldn’t get to see you flail about like a flobberworm on ice.”
Draco swings his legs out of bed and places his feet on the cold floor. He pulls on a shirt but doesn’t bother buttoning it, letting it hang off his shoulders. He pads back over to the desk and picks up the paper. He means to just skim through until he finds Pansy’s piece, something about a new boutique opening in Diagon, but something catches his eye.
He groans, and crashes his lips against Harry’s like a wave onto the rocks. Draco didn’t say that he couldn’t kiss back, only that he couldn’t touch, so Harry gives as good as he gets. Clutching at his own wrists, he opens his mouth for Draco’s tongue. He licks into Harry’s mouth for just a second, before reaching behind Harry to take his hands and pull them between their chests. Still holding onto him, Draco walks them backwards, pushing him back onto the bed. The mattress bounces when he falls and Harry huffs a laugh. Then he sees the hungry look on Draco’s face. The giddy feeling is quickly overtaken by lust, and the need to give this man whatever he wants.
“No!” Harry protests. “It wasn’t like that at all.”
“What?” asks Malfoy, looking confused.
Harry laughs along with him. “I thought he’d do that.”
Not that it wasn’t the worst idea in the world- Jones should be tossed into a tiger pit, not welcomed back with open arms- but that doesn’t mean much to Potter right now. He loved him, and that doesn’t just go away overnight. Draco can attest to that.
Harry frowns. “You didn’t want me to testify. Didn’t it keep you out of Azkaban?”
“Here you go, sweetheart.”
Mr Filch shakes his head. “Such ingratitude to your benefactors. Do you know where you would be, if your aunt and uncle hadn’t taken you in? The streets, or the poorhouse, that’s where you’d be.”
, right?”
“Dear lord, Potter,” drawls Malfoy. “I know you have a hero complex but this is just inexplicably idiotic. You have to rush in and save everyone but Merlin forbid
Hermione frowns. “Where did this come from? I mean, we always thought that you liked…”
“Do you have any idea how good you feel? So warm, so tight. So perfect for me.”
Harry bites his lip. Nods.
Harry turns around, following Samuel's gaze. Sure enough, there it is.
“Oh fuck, Harry. I needed that. I haven’t laughed like that in ages.” Ron takes a deep breath, and looks between their serious faces. “Oh fuck, Harry,” he echoes softly.
The Harry-shaped lump doesn’t move, so Hermione shrugs and flops back onto the bed beside him. He sticks his head out just far enough to see her stare up at the ceiling, dark circles under her eyes.
“About that,” says Harry, looking into to the last dregs of his whisky to avoid Malfoy’s eyes. “Which, um. Which way do you want to- you know?”
he didn’t live up to what Terran’s fantasy.
“No,” she says. “Not today, anyway. Now take that naughty boy for a walk, or he’ll be nipping at my ankles all day.”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but we need to stop.”
The ladder in question rattles at the brash sound of his voice, then zooms off along the shelves to the other end of the room.
Potter nods. He clearly isn’t ready to come back down to earth.
Draco still seems caught in the afterglow. He’s turned from an unstoppable force to an affectionate housecat, nuzzling into the space between Harry’s chin and shoulder. He starts pressing chaste kisses down Harry’s biceps, before leaning over to kiss across his chest. Moving half on top of him, he scrapes his teeth along Harry’s collarbone, causing Harry to splutter and blindly place his glass on the bedside table.
“Well,” says Draco thoughtfully, leaning back in his chair. “You can do something for me. Would that satisfy your Gryffindor sense of fairness?”
“Maybe not. Draco’s changed, he’s really not the same person anymore.”
“Am not,” retorted Harry. “If anyone’s a thief it’s you – you’re the one who snatched it.”
The Ace of Cups is tricky. Harry’s first thought is of the Goblet of Fire, and being thrust into something he isn’t ready for. His second thought is of the passage he’d read in ‘
“Of course.”
He tries to swallow, but his mouth is dry.
Ron folds his arms. “So it was about the sex.”
“Do you want to do this, darling? It’s alright if you don’t.”
“Maybe the old you did,” soothes Granny. “But not the young man you’ve become.”
Draco squeezes a finger into the gap between the rope and his skin. “How’s that, darling? Not too tight?”
“What?”
There’s only one castle he’s ever known. “Home, somewhere to belong.”
and then whatever room it is you want.”
“Please, Draco.”
Harry hisses through his teeth. The floor to ceiling windows that line one wall have all been blown out by a powerful blast. The mirrors that clad the opposite wall are completely shattered. Nearly everything is covered in a sticky black powder, like soot. He nearly takes out his wand to do a quick scan, but then remembers what Malfoy had said about it being cleared. Not wanting to waste time, he runs a finger over the wall, and sniffs the black residue that coats his finger. Mushrooms. The strange and distinctive smell of the infamous
As it happens, that last one was a big mistake, because he remembers at the last minute exactly why both of them didn’t catch that Quidditch match on the wireless. Draco was probably fucking his thighs around the time they released the snitch, and he was probably tossing Harry off as he sat in his lap around the time the seeker caught it.
He cups Harry’s chin and lifts it, forcing their eyes to lock. Whatever he sees there must answer his unspoken question, because he wraps his arm around Harry and apparates them upstairs. Malfoy lowers him onto a bed.
That was the memory Harry clung to on his eleventh birthday, as he sat in the window seat and looked out at the empty drive. It was a clear day, the sky stretching out like a bolt of blue satin. Still, there was little chance of a walk. Uncle Vernon maintained walking was for those who couldn’t afford horses, and Aunt Petunia felt that her constitution was too delicate. So, even while the sun shone brightly, Harry was stuck indoors. And while he had never seen an owl, he had read enough about them in Bewick’s book to know that they slept in the day time. This is just one of the few reasons why he was surprised to see one swooping down towards him to alight on the window ledge.
Once the birds have left, Draco perches on the edge of the bed. “Potter,” he says, nudging the sleeping body beside him. “Your fan mail has arrived.”
He’s looking at Harry too,  and seems to decide something. “It’s you isn’t it? You’re H.”
“You told me about your happy memory, of your mum singing to you. I don’t know why I thought of it, maybe because using this record player makes me feel connected to my own parents, but I asked your mum to sing the lullaby to me. Then I put the memory into the record.”
“No chance for sun bathing, I’m afraid. I’ll be in the observatory the whole time with my face shoved in a telescope.”
“He won’t leave the manor. All of society has rejected him.”
“Erm, would you mind?” says Harry. “It’s just- I’ve got to get dressed.”
“Really?” says Hermione, gently surprised.
Terran runs his fingers through Harry’s hair. “Look, it’s okay, we can keep going.”
Time for a POV change! This is my first time writing from Draco's perspective, and I really enjoyed it.
Draco looks strangled.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “Alright then, Harry.”
“Good,” replies Draco, before turning to Harry. “You have no idea how helpful it is to have someone who had a hand in making the wards here to talk to. Besides, she’s definitely one of my more likeable ancestors.”
“Is that alright, darling? Do you like being my slut?”
“Lord,” he groans. “That is not an image I want in my mind’s eye.” Draco sighs, and wraps his arm tighter around him. “Well, I’m not calling you Harry. I may have actually made a blood pact when I was fourteen preventing me from doing so. How about a compromise?”
“I’m not sure I do. I’m average at a lot of things, and I’m good at Quidditch, but no impressive skills,” he says, staring into his mug.
“Okay,” he says. “Thanks.”
The pink tip of a tongue pokes out ever so slightly to wet his lips. “An invitation. Come to my house tonight, and we can deflower you more…thoroughly.”
“No,” blurts out Harry. “It’s not okay, I can’t do it.”
“That should be easy enough to notice. Sex is a conversation, only wanking is a monologue. Although,” he says, looking Harry up and down. “I’m not opposed to an argument.”
“It doesn’t matter if the letter is yours or not, you’re still a thief,” said Dudley.
“Fuck,” he says. “I ruined your waistcoat.
Harry never used to love his body, but Draco does, and he’s proven himself an excellent teacher.
For the first time in weeks, Harry doesn’t dream. They lay curled towards each other like brackets, Draco’s pale head only just poking out from under the covers. They only slept last night. Draco had conjured himself a toothbrush, and Harry had given him some pyjamas to wear. He usually just slept in his boxers so they were practically new, but Draco’s wrists and ankles stuck out awkwardly. It was adorable.
“You’re too modest, far too modest, but if you insist. Thirty galleons, please, Mr Potter.”
A crease appears between Malfoy’s fine eyebrows, and he nods slowly. “May I see?” Andromeda hands him the duck, and he turns it over in his hands, before bringing it up to his eye. “What does this do?” he asks, pointing to the switch.
Harry looks disappointed for some reason. “Oh. Are you sure?”
“You know Draco, then?” asks Samuel.
Draco never said anything about that. He takes a deep breath, then an even deeper drink. He knows Draco isn’t a monk, quite obviously not, so why is he going mental over meeting someone he used to date?
Draco unlocks Harry’s hands from behind his neck so he can tug his t-shirt over his head. He rubs his hands up and down Harry’s chest, his eyes a physical weight. Harry notices that he’s avoiding paying too much attention to Harry’s nipples, and he realises that he’s probably worried about setting him off on another panic attack. On the one hand, he’s grateful for the consideration. On the other hand, he wishes he wasn’t such a headcase- that Draco didn’t need to be careful with him.
“Why?” he asks. “Tell me why, and I’ll do it.”
,” he says. Petulant, yet still so desperate to please.
towards him. He flips through until a flicker of colour and movement that catches his eye. The Tower is wreathed in painted flames, waves crashing at its base. A man falls down into the sea, appears back up at the window, and falls all over again. It plays in a loop, the tiny features of his face open in a scream. Harry shudders. It reminds him of how he used to replay Dumbledore’s death in his mind, lying awake at night, watching him fall from the tower every time he closed his eyes. If he’d dreamt of it, if he’d seen it coming, could he have stopped it? Why was he seeing the future now, and not before the War? It would have been more helpful then.
“Are you sure, Harry?”
Draco’s voice is ragged as he says “I can do that. I can do all of that.”
Draco kisses him softly, just once. “Good. Because this is everything for me.”
Harry laughs, understanding Draco’s inebriated logic more than his muggle friends can. Then he wonders why Draco might’ve been walking home with someone he just met, and sobers a little.
, he finds out for certain that Draco doesn’t want him back, it won’t be because he’s straight. It’ll be because it’s Harry.
He shifts Teddy’s weight over to one arm, feeling a small familiar thrill at being better at something than Malfoy, and hands her the small parcel. She opens it, revealing a rubber duck. At first it looks clear, with a small mechanism inside. He flicks a small switch underneath and it starts glowing pink from within, then promptly fades into purple. Every few seconds it switches to a new colour of the rainbow. Teddy changes the colour of his hair to match, giggling every time.
“Why is it I can do this-” Harry waves his hand and turns her glass of wine into milk, “And you don’t bat an eyelash, but even the idea of telling the future is ridiculous.”
Simi says goodbye and hangs up, and Draco immediately lets the phone clatter to the floor. Before he knows what’s happening Draco is kissing him, fucking his tongue into Harry’s mouth. He wraps Harry in his arms, pulling him closer, moving him until his dick almost slips out. Draco must be so sensitive, after all this time. Harry certainly is. His rim is throbbing around the intrusion, being unable to close for so long. Even when Draco finally pulls out, it’s going to be open and burning for hours. Funnily enough, he’d barely noticed the ache until now.
The idea of Malfoy coddling him again, like he did yesterday, makes him tense up. If it was Terran, he’d want to be held and reassured. But coming from Malfoy, it would be out of a sense of obligation, not affection. Still, he had seemed concerned, yesterday.
of him.
“He’s invited me to the funeral. I think I want to go, and I’m sorry if this is too much to ask, but I hoped you’d come with me. I don’t think I could face it alone.”
“Go on, then,” murmurs Potter, and it takes a moment for him to remember what he’s referring to.
“He actually, um. He actually suggested I talk to you.”
Harry swallows. “The idea of topping scares me shitless, to be honest. I know I’ll never live up to their expectations.”
Simi gives him a dispassionate look. “Leave it, Sam.”
Draco’s mouth drops open. Surely he can’t mean…
“I was just telling young Draco why I’m up here, and not downstairs with the other paintings,” she says.
“That’s none of your business,” says Hermione.
Granny looks thunderous. “I imagine one of my clients went and blabbed.”
“I’m just glad you’re okay. When I heard that noise I thought you might have fallen.”
They’re all pretty drunk, but Ron’s definitely the worst for wear. If Harry’s not mistaken, there might actually be tears escaping from behind his fingers.
Harry wants to get Malfoy naked too, wants to see what’s hidden beneath all those layers of formality and artifice. When he tugs at Malfoy’s collar, he’s distracted by the small mark he finds under his jaw. Harry did that, and Malfoy hasn’t healed it. His mouth is drawn back to the love bite, licking over it with perverse satisfaction at its existence. Malfoy groans, and he can feel the vibration of it on his lips. Malfoy runs his hands down over his torso to rest at Harry’s jeans, pressing a hand into his groin. Harry gasps against Malfoy neck.
Harry puts his hand on her knee. As usual, he has no idea what to say in this moment.
“Boys, dinner!” calls Andromeda.
“Why? Is the bed making you uncomfortable?”
Malfoy is impossibly close, close enough that he has to look down slightly when he speaks. “Potter, do you trust me?”
Harry looks away. He’s right. Terran should be able to talk to his own friends about his relationship. Who is Harry to tell him otherwise?
Draco snorts. “You know, if you feel like polishing some wood, I’m sure I’d appreciate it more than the ladder.”
Harry Potter. After all, as you so kindly pointed out, I was a Death Eater. You know I can do it.”
He fucks Harry just as deeply and deliberately as always. Their mouths skate over each other, never really meeting a kiss but never leaving either. It’s only when Harry begins to whine under his breath that Draco finally speaks.
“Are you sure? Doesn’t look that way.”
Harry takes another sip, slower this time, prepared for the sickly-sweet burn. His limbs feel loose, and all he wants to do is kiss that sneer off of Draco’s mouth. It makes him look younger. Like a version of him he knew a long time ago. Instead, he settles for laying his hand over Draco’s where it rests on his stomach.
In fact, he’d asked to stay. Those two words, ‘
The leather bar, then. That doesn’t explain the animosity between them, one-sided that it is. Samuel doesn’t acknowledge Draco’s glare; his eyes are fixed on Harry.
“How is it you could eat a full English every day and still turn up at Hogwarts so skinny each year?”
“We’ve been going so fast,” says Draco. “I don’t want to throw you into the deep end.”
He pulls his wrist free of Harry’s grasp, and leaves.
“Nonsense,” she says. “We both know you’ve got absolutely nothing better to do, so sit down and have a cup of tea with a poor old woman, there’s a good lad.”
He fetches a pen and paper, and sits down at his kitchen table, studying Malfoy’s letter. “What do I even say? He has a point.”
“Hello,” says Harry, trying to be polite.
“You know, a bunch of people from Hogwarts go to the pub every month. Almost all of our year, actually. Not all at once, obviously, but everyone comes from time to time.”
“So?”
God, he is a freak. Why would someone want to be treated like that? Why couldn’t he have vanilla sex with his boyfriend but he can have kinky, twisted sex with his childhood nemesis? Is he so fucked up that he can’t have normal sex? Then again, the sex he had with Draco was pretty normal in the beginning. Obviously the dirty talk did more to him that it might have to another, more well-adjusted person, but it wasn’t so far out of the ordinary. So, he
“Harry, please. Tell me it’s not true.”
Potter’s eyes flick to the door, and he takes the holly wand out of his jeans pocket, casting locking and silencing charms. Then he bites the lip that’s been plaguing Draco so thoroughly, and casts a protection spell over Draco. It’s the first time he’s been the one to do it, and his magic is warm when it washes over his skin, bringing his prick from half-hard to aching almost instantly. Potter pockets his wand again, and gets gracelessly to his knees. His ungainliness only makes him seem younger, less experienced, reminding Draco he’s the only one who’s had him like this. He wants to keep it that way for as long as possible.
“Sorry,” grimaces Draco.
. “It’s nine o’clock, Potter. I know we’re both self-employed but some of us have something called a ‘work ethic’.”
Reluctantly, Potter lets him take the toy away. Draco cleanses it, and sends it back to the chest it came from. He slides down to lie on his side, so they’re facing each other. They lie like that for a few minutes, Draco just watching him, until Potter finally speaks.
“Yes, it turns out we have quite a lot in common, actually. We were the only ones doing arithmancy in eighth year, so we worked together a lot.”
he thought to himself, as he got out a quill and ink.
“It’s the one on the right,” Draco says, pushing down his trousers.
Terran pulls off and looks up at Harry. “I’ve changed my mind,” he says. Harry tenses.
Granny Lynn had given him the day off to study the books she’d lent him, and he had them spread over the kitchen table, swapping between them as he felt like it. He’d never been a methodical studier, not like Hermione, he simply follows his train of thought as it leads across the pages and diagrams. Yesterday, Draco had said he would come today to do more work on the wards. That didn’t look likely now.
“Earl Grey, milk, no sugar?” he hedges, trying to remember what he’d seen her do.
Harry nods.
“Yes,” she continues. “You were a little white dragon, and I had to carry you around in a teacup because you kept flying in circles and making yourself dizzy.”
Those are Harry’s two favourite words. In fact they might be the only words he knows. He nods, and Draco leans back to pull at the hem of Harry’s t-shirt. The afternoon light shows Draco’s chest in excruciating detail, highlighting the thin white lines that scratch into his torso like claw marks. Harry grab’s his wrists to stop him.
“No,” he says cheekily, “But if you want, we can forget about the silencing charm.”
Harry hums. She did tell him to tell Draco how he feels, and look how that turned out. “Look, you don’t have to stay and look after me. I’ll be fine.”
“You dropped it before the reading began, which usually means that there’s something the deck wants you to know, that doesn’t relate to your question.”
Harry sighs, half annoyed and half amused. “You might want to read this,” he says, holding the letter out so Narcissa could see.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” he snaps, pretending annoyance where he only feels heat.
Death is simpler. Granny has talked about it more than any other card. They had discussed it in relation to the baby in his tea leaves. Endings making way for new beginnings. A transformation.
Terrible taste in men. If Draco has terrible taste in men, then surely that means he’s interested in them? Harry’s heart beats so loudly he doesn’t hear whatever Draco says in reply, and then common sense catches up with him. Apparently there is a strange woman in his attic, and that has to take precedence over obsessing about Draco. Hastily, he climbs the ladder. As he sticks his head through the hatch, he relaxes immediately. Draco has propped a portrait of a woman in an elaborately ruffled dress against a chair, and is sitting cross-legged in front of it.
Shit. If Granny doesn’t want this going to the Aurors, they can’t tell the truth. But what can he say that will make any sense?
“No,” laughs Harry. “I’m pretty sure I called him my ‘arch rival’ at one point, but I was a pretty dramatic teenager.”
Aunt Petunia was sat stiffly on a chintz chair, her hands folded in her lap. Her mouth was twisted into what might be a smile; Harry wasn’t sure, as he’d never seen her do such a thing before and so had nothing to compare it to.
Harry finally gives in and slumps down next to Draco, pushing up his hair from where it’s plastered to his neck. Draco pounces, and he can taste salt on his tongue as he kisses him. He’s practically growling into Harry’s mouth, and pulls them both upright.
“He’s been very polite in his letters,” he explains. “Been very apologetic, too. He’s also very passionate about the project, so I don’t see why he can’t be a partner.”
The house looks presentable, he's thought out the request he plans to make to Draco, but it isn’t enough. Before, he didn't know how he felt. He didn't realise what the fluttering in his stomach meant. Now he knows he wants to kiss Draco until they forget to breath, and he has no idea how to act around him. Harry feels sure that Draco will be able to tell with one look what he’s thinking, because it’s written all over his face. He’s always been awkward when he likes someone. Grimacing, he thinks about the fiasco with Cho in Madame Puddifoot’s. Why can he never say the right thing?
Harry closes his eyes again but tears leak out from the corners, spilling down his cheeks.
“And would you say you were friends, or…” questions Simi with a calculating look in their eye.
“Err-”
“Apologise?”
She drifts away like a wisp of cloud on the breeze, and Draco turns his attention to the Slytherins.
Harry’s not scared but he is nervous, and a little ashamed. He’s still going to do it- he wants it too much.
“Terran, I told you not to do that,” he grumbles, without much bite.
Privately, Draco thinks that people don’t give Luna enough credit. She’s more perceptive than people think. He’ll have to be more careful about teasing Potter in front of her. Draco feels his eyes on him, and turns to meet them. They immediately flick away.
“Yes,” says Harry, letting his legs fall open, making space for Draco to crawl into. “I want you to.”
Harry just turns to look at him.
Ron’s face lit up. “Oh yeah?”
“No,” says Potter. “Are you?”
“Darling, darling, I’m getting close. Are you going to take it? Are you going to swallow for me?”
Weasley comes back on the dot of half past five. He escorts him into the living room, sitting himself back down in the armchair and gesturing for Weasley to take a seat on the sofa. Nothing about this is comfortable, but he’s still going to try his hardest to make it so.
‘Patented Daydream Charm’, and if he’s about to wake up and realise that none of this is real. The rest of him knows that there’s no magic strong enough to create an illusion this powerful. Besides, a daydream would never include the pain of Harry’s glasses digging into his cheek, or the strands of his hair that are trapped in their mouths. Harry leans back, huffing a wry laugh, and pushes his hands through Draco’s hair to hold it out of the way. There’s no enchantment strong enough to conjure up a laugh so awkwardly beautiful, so full of heavy joy. Draco’s eyes sting with the effort of holding back tears once again.
Harry swallows, his breath coming fast, and it takes a moment for the words to sink in.
As if by magic, the fledgelings seemed to grow in size. One moment they were small enough to hold in a child’s pudgy fist, and the next they were the size of a crow, and then an eagle. Dudley screamed. Realising they were now big enough to defend themselves, they turned their beaks on the boy. Harry’s cousin ran squealing back to the house, and the young birds rose into the air, threatening to give chase. Instead, they lowered back to the ground, and shrunk back to their original size.
“Yes,” hisses Malfoy. “That’s it, that’s it.”
“If you think those wizards only want you because you’re famous, you’re kidding yourself.”
Harry ushers him indoors, still wrong-footed by his luck. “Why would I want you to leave?”
“A heron,” decides Draco. “Definitely a heron.”
“Go ahead,” says Harry, finally sitting up and putting his glasses on.
Draco Malfoy looks like he wants to lean casually against the doorjamb, but that would mean getting his clothes stained with curse residue, so he has to make do with an insolent expression. This time he’s dressed in muggle clothes, instead of the black robes Harry saw him in before. They would look completely normal, if Queen Victoria was still on the throne. As it is, the silk waistcoat, the pressed trousers, and the embroidered cuffs of his shirt make him look like a fairy tale prince. Or an eccentric. Possibly both.
“Whisky or wine, Potter?”
Harry just makes another pathetic sound, his cock twitching. The idea of making himself up all sweet and feminine and sexy for Draco is turning him on so much his knees might buckle. He closes his eyes so he doesn’t have to look them together, it’s too overwhelming to have both sight and sound right now.
When Harry was twenty-one, he was determined to lose his virginity. Embarrassed as he was, he decided to go to a Healer. The Healer told him sexual dysfunction was normal after trauma. Harry tried to explain that it wasn’t a physical problem, but when he tried to explain what actually happened to him when he was about to have sex, he couldn’t find the words.
“Not this time, duckie. We’re using the leaves- that box over there.” She points to a scratched green tin that appeared to house Garibaldi biscuits in a past life.
He’s probably going to need it. “Go on then. Thanks.”
“I’m not scared!” snaps Harry. “I mean, that’s not it exactly.”
“What problem?” he asks.
“Or a lust potion, then. Or he’s cursed you, or he’s blackmailing you, or something.”
Ron’s eyes are wide with astonishment.
“Hi Granny,” he says, following her into the back room.
Once, a pair of robins made their nest high up in one of the hedges. Harry would go and visit them every day, peering in at them like a lady cooing at a baby in a crib. He waited impatiently as the nest took shape, as the fragile eggs were laid, as the first yellow beaks appeared. Mr and Mrs Red-Breast were run ragged feeding their brood, the chicks awake and hungry with the sunrise. Harry would dash about the vegetable patches hidden away in the kitchen garden, finding worms to place under the hedge, much like Mrs Figg’s cats bringing mice to her door.
Harry shrugs, and nods at the same time. “That would be easier, but it doesn’t help me now. Obviously, I care what Terran thinks.”
“That’s not all I do,” says Draco petulantly. “Now I fuck Harry Potter as well.”
Harry is hungover. The alarm clock is ringing, stabbing into his head like a crime of passion. He throws it at the wall, and feels a rush of sweet justice. Dragging himself out of bed and into the shower, he tries to remember the night before. It had been afternoon when they arrived at the pub, and getting dark when they left. He thinks they went to a muggle bar after that, but his memories from there are hazy. Draco had a lot he’d rather not think about, and Harry was happy to do the same. By the end of the night they were pleasantly drunk, arms slung over each other’s shoulders for support. Draco had smelled nice, and sort of herbal.
Harry kisses him artlessly, soft and open. Draco makes a noise of surprise, before twisting his fingers into his hair and tugging. He can feel the last traces of Draco’s lip gloss, sticky, as if it wants to hold their mouths together. Harry kisses down his jaw, his neck. He’s unpracticed, guileless, and completely blind to the rest of the room. But not deaf. Samuel’s voice cuts through the haze.
“Yeah, I remember. You were talking about- what did you call it? Aftercare.”
“What happened? Did the She-Weasel dump you?”
Blaise gives Draco a conspiratorial look. “It’s all part of her new thing. It’s like she thinks if we all call her Millie, everyone will think that Millicent Bullstrode from school was some other girl, who never put Hermione Granger in a headlock.”
“That you’re at the beginning of something important, and the choices you make now will change the course of your life. You are about to transform, in one way or another.”
“So,” continues Granny. “She tried to tell me that the watch was a family heirloom, and that whoever had sold it to me had no right to it. She tried to buy it from me. I explained that I had made it for my brother, who then left it to me in his will.”
“I’m not tired yet,” he says. “Are you?”
Two of Swords: Decisions, An Impasse, Avoidance.
“It’s okay,” says Harry. “I’m here.” Kneeling down, he clasps his pale hand, but it’s cold and limp. He squeezes it anyway. “You’re going to be okay, Draco.” If he’s talking, that has to mean he’s okay. He has to be, because Harry loves him. Because he can’t lose him twice in one day.
Harry stops, and thinks. What Draco’s saying makes a surprising amount of sense. It’s obviously not the whole story, but it looks like it might be the missing piece of the puzzle. Yes, when he puts it all together, he thinks he can finally understand it. He understands
“I don’t mind,” mumbles Harry, hiding his face in his Draco’s chest. “I don’t mind if he thinks that.”
He’s sweating, and from the glimpses of Draco caught between trees, the back of his neck as he hoots and speeds away, his sharp and blinding grin as he manages to attack without warning, Draco’s getting hot too. Harry pauses for a moment, the sun piercing his eyes, when something crashes into him from behind. It’s solid, warm, and heavy. Harry clings onto the fabric of Draco’s shirt as he tries to knock him to the ground and pulls him down with him. The breath is forced from his lungs as Draco lies on top of him, his own fall broken by Harry’s body.
Weasley punches him in the mouth, knocking his head backwards. Pain ricochets through his teeth, his jaw, his skull.
He moves the cup in tight circles, disturbing the sluggish green mush and yellow-brown liquid inside. He turns it upside down, lets it drain a moment, and rights it again. His heart clenches. He’s seen that shape before.
Everyone turns to look at him, commanding their attention with his confident drawl.
“I am perfectly content,” he says.
Ron goes to the window, looking relieved at the interruption. A large and elegant owl flutters her wings and lands on the table. She turns to face Harry, and gracefully holds out her leg.
“Hell,” he said, quietly relieved that he knew the answer.
Potter moves one shoulder in a slight shrug. “I overreacted.”
“Didn’t you stay in touch?”
“Draco?”
He’d forgotten Bellatrix was her sister too. Despite how alike they looked, Andromeda’s personality is so bright as to outshine the similarities completely.
He gives her a mutinous look.
“Hire me?” says Draco, his eyebrows inching towards his hairline. “I was going to do it anyway.”
Harry shakes his head.
Draco finds him in the library. It’s mostly undamaged, but the ladder that allows access to the higher shelves has taken to zipping away from humans like a feral cat, refusing to let anyone use it. It seems even the furniture was traumatised by the Manor’s former occupants. Potter is sitting cross-legged on the floor, talking to it. Draco stays quiet, watching. He can’t hear what he’s saying, his voice is too soft, but he’s clearly trying to reassure it. The ladder trembles, then slides an inch or two closer. Potter picks something up and holds it out, as if trying to show it to the eyeless piece of furniture. Wood polish.
“So,” says Zabini, with a sly grin on his handsome face. “I hear you’re having kinky sex with Draco.”
So much of this sounded familiar to Harry, his heart was in his throat a little. It’s not exactly the same, but it’s enough. For now, he feels a little less like a freak.
The owl merely blinked at him, and flew away. The great flapping of its wings blew the hair up from his forehead, cool air brushing his scar. Harry watched it fly away until it was a black speck in the sky, and then turned back to his letter. It was the only piece of correspondence he’d ever received, and the best birthday present he’d ever had – not that he’d even opened it yet.
Harry clears his throat. “
…ward room?”
“You’re not worried? Wait, should I be worried? Is this fortune for me or for you?”
“Alright?” he asks gently, as if he might frighten Harry off.
“What’s going to happen to me?” asks Draco, fussing with the cuff of his pale blue shirt.
“It’s Saturday,” says Harry, pulling the quilt over his face.
The curtain was thrown back, revealing Dudley’s smirking face.
“Excellent. And how long might I expect the pleasure of your company? I’m always looking for someone to state the bloody obvious.”
“Of course, there are some things I need to discuss with Potter, anyway.”
“Well,” parrots Draco. “Are you going to ask politely?”
“You should wear your own shoes though,” says Millie. “It’ll be terribly obvious you’ve had help if you look
“Sometimes it gets better,” he says. “When you really know what you like, what you’re doing.”
“Well I was, and I still let you bump into me. So, you’ll have to let me take the blame.”
They arrive in a warm kitchen with a small round table, just big enough for two chairs. Malfoy bends over to open a cupboard, and catches Harry staring at his arse when he looks back over his shoulder. Thankfully, he declines to mention it.
Draco was oddly touched. She invited him for Christmas dinner every year, but Draco always refused. He couldn’t see his mother, as she was on house arrest and he couldn’t go anywhere as magical as
“Please, fuck me.”
“We’re not really ‘a thing’,” he says carefully.
“Well now you’ve just confused her.”
“I could sell this memory on Knockturn Alley and die a rich man, if I wasn’t one already.”
“Kreacher’s retired. He was too old to keep working.”
“It might just be me and my own tendencies, shaping the way things unfold, but I don’t really believe that’s the case. Is it, darling?”
He agrees, and Draco sweeps out of the room, leaving Harry flustered and confused.
“You’re disgusting,” says Millicent, deadpan.
Potter slurps at his bright blue drink that tastes sort of like lemons, sort of like mouthwash. Draco knows, because he’s got the exact same concoction.
“That’s right.” Draco-
Ron retches, and he’s likely only half faking it.
Malfoy just hums noncommittally, and looks around the room. Rectangles of sunshine slice through the attic, creating stripes of gloom and light. Boxes and old furniture are crammed onto every available surface, except for the path Harry has cleared to walk through. Malfoy picks up something that looks like it used to be a potted plant, before it died and fossilised up there, and tilts his head. Harry watches him. He’s dressed similarly to last night; no formal robes, but still over-dressed for the grime and clutter surrounding him. He puts the pot back down, and moves into a shaft of light.
, their bodies answer.
“What is it, darling?” she asked, barely sounding interested enough to open her mouth.
He smiles at the picture they make in the mirror: dishevelled, happy, and in love.
He waits for Terran to realise, to back off. The picture is so jumpy it’s hard to tell, but it looks like he does realise after a minute. Draco moves closer, it’s too hard to see what’s going on otherwise. Terran pulls off and Draco sighs in relief, but instead of trying to bring Potter back, he does something that makes Draco see red. He takes off his clothes, casts the preparation spells, and starts to finger him. The bastard is kissing all over Potter’s body, stroking him, fucking him with his fingers. The picture is still lurching and swaying, and he wonders if Potter actually remembers this part at all. Pensieve memories are always more detailed, seeing as they’re retrieved directly from the subconscious.
“Whenever you are not here, I will be with Draco. There’s no point me being here by myself, and I won’t follow you outside the house. My reception may not be…friendly.”
Harry hitches a leg up to wrap around him, bringing their hips more firmly together. It gives Draco a truly genius idea. Grasping Harry’s other leg and holding him tightly, he lifts him up off the ground. Hooking his ankles together at the small of Draco’s back, Harry tips his head back against the doorjamb, breathing heavily. Draco licks up his neck, tasting salt. He wants him so much it feels like a compulsion, like dark fucking magic. He grinds their bodies together, and in the back of his mind he thinks that this can’t be comfortable for Harry, the doorjamb must be digging into his spine.
Harry nods. “I always wanted siblings.”
Draco wonders if
“Yes, yes.”
“Excellent,” she says. “You boys catch up, I’ll just be in the kitchen.”
“You’re not getting away with it this time, Potter. The whole point of this is so you can have sex without panicking, so you need to tell me what makes you panic.”
“I’ll just have to keep checking in, then.” Malfoy drinks deeply, then sighs in satisfaction. “What if it does happen again? What should I do?”
Ginny wipes her eyes and shakes her head. “Anyway, I didn’t really think about the fact she was a girl until we were already kissing.”
“And what does Sirius represent to you? What did the Grim mean when you saw it last?”
“Really?”
Harry’s eyes widened. “Mrs Malfoy, are you dead?”
“Oh god,” moans Ron, hiding his face in his hands. “I should have known something like this would happen. We’ve not been spending enough time together, I practically drove you into his arms.”
“Are you coming to lunch at the Burrow again?”
The bird explodes from his wand, and Harry can almost feel the ripples of wind the wings create, illustrated by waves of light in the air. It circles the room several times, searching for somewhere to land, before it perches on the record player. It lifts one leg.
Harry drags his finger down the condensation fogging his glass, not looking Malfoy in the eye. “Your mother came to see me.”
Draco keeps hold of his hand as he leads him upstairs, and he can’t ignore the thrill of it. Everything he’s done, everything that’s been done to him, and holding this one man’s hand is making his heart race. It seems more intimate, somehow, than anything else they’ve done. Perhaps because of its innocence.
Malfoy jabs his finger in Harry’s direction. “Not at first. But yes, Madame Pomfrey healed me straight away.”
He swallows. “I mean, I’ve been dreaming that something bad happens to you, and Granny thinks that I might be seeing something that’s going to happen. She gave me this magic tea, and now I’m pretty sure it’s true.”
“What’s me?”
Update 10th December 2020: I’m currently writing a festive sequel, so if you enjoyed this keep your eyes tuned and your ears peeled!
Hermione scoffs.
Granny spreads he arms in satisfaction. “Excellent! Only time will tell how right you are, but I think we’re on the right track. Now, your turn. Try to think about what each shape represents to you, not what it’s supposed to mean.”
of all people, but still won’t let me touch him, when I’m the one who actually loves him.”
“That’s between Mr Potter and myself, but if he wishes to tell you I won’t stop him.”
Harry blinks.
Earl attempts to hide behind his legs. Harry picks him up and strokes his head. “Don’t worry, nothing to be scared of.”
“I told you I used the memory of my brother’s cat to make the watch purr, didn’t I? Well, ghosts have become untethered, are beginning to interact with the living world, and seem especially drawn to you,” she says to Harry.
Harry smiles weakly. “I just wish people would stop congratulating me. I don’t want to be thanked for killing someone, or told how brave I am. I just want some peace and quiet.”
“All I know is that you’re injured, and I don’t know if you’re going to be okay.” He takes a deep breath. “That’s why I wanted you to come here, so Granny can read her Tarot cards and see if you’ll be okay.”
Harry licks his lips. “Yes, sir.”
“Well, that was bloody weird,” says Ron.
Draco tilts his head. “Not necessarily. Magical houses like these often cut off rooms that are no longer in use, and bring them back when they are needed. This house was empty for years, I imagine it’s half the size it used to be.”
“Sorry Harry, the pixies get very grumpy without a proper nights sleep and light wakes them up. Noise doesn’t seem to bother them though, so don’t worry about that.” She puts three mugs of Gurdyroot ‘tea’ onto the table. “Yes, she’s upstairs. I’ll just go and get her.”
When he returns, the customers have left, and Granny beckons him into the back room. He sits down in the big armchair, and Earl jumps into his lap. Perhaps the dog realises he needs comforting.
I miss going to parties so badly I want to smash a plate. Even more dialogue heavy chapter than usual, but such is the nature of socialising.
Draco pulls Harry’s pyjama bottoms down to his knees, then starts working on his own belt with shaky hands. He takes hold of them both, stroking their dicks together, murmuring to Harry the whole time. He’s not entirely sure what he’s saying, it’s just pouring out of him like water through a hole in the wall of a dam. Words like
Six months later, the Charity Burbage Centre is ready to open to the public. Harry watches from across the room as his boyfriend gets snippy with one of the decorators. He’s too far away to see what the fuss is about, but Draco’s making frustrated gestures and his lips are pursed in a way that straddles the line between comical and adorable. Harry’s leaning towards adorable, but that’s probably just because he loves him.
