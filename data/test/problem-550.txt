"You didn't tell me who else is teaching." Ron turns to him offering him a slice of the sandwich he was eating. Neville accepts and takes it between his fingers thanking him with a quick gesture.
So the lineups change completely. Wolfgang Goldstein is in center accompanied by striker Renée Berry to his left. The guardian, David Everly in the background being protected by Paris Green who was on the right just behind the hunter Hugo Stravinsky. On the other side the last two hunters, the brothers Helga and Deymond Princhester.
"Similar, yes, very good. Five points to Hufflepuff, Mr. Lupin." Evan reaches for a high-five with his partner. "But a follow-up potion can be fueled with any kind of feeling as long as it's strong and persistent. It can be love or even hate. There is an old legend about a witch from whom a Muggle who stole her frozen desert hourglass, she used that potion to find it, but it turned out that she was not fed with hatred, but with deep love. But here we are not for stories."
The first weeks are over and Draco doesn't meet Harry for the rest of the days. Neville mentions something about the Gryffindor Quidditch team and that he's the head of the house, but it doesn't matter. He prefers to focus on assessing who his best students will be (or technically who he has the most faith in). He has Evan McGregor, a rather distracted and cheerful Hufflepuff, not a novelty in his house and Eleanor Aknes, from the same house. Connor Tremlett and Alek Millicent from Ravenclaw are also a good bet, there are six outstanding Slytherins, it doesn't surprise him and he still can't find a Gryffindor. Maybe in it's time.
Draco looks out the window at some of the boys who have gone out to play in the snow as has been their custom since the first snow and smiles when he sees Evan playing next to Teddy and Cecyl, a Gryffindor girl. And he almost fell backwards as Harry Potter flew past him on his broom at the speed of the wind; he spills some tea on his sweater so he rushes to wipe himself with a napkin. Harry turns around, goes back to the window and greets Draco before giving him a signal indicating that he will go to his office.
Jerome had the same profile as his father, he was an exact copy, with black hair and brown skin, however, his way of walking and even speaking were totally a reflection of his mother. He wondered for a moment if people saw in his family the same as he sees in the François.
"Sirius made up a song ... I don't remember it, it was something like, uh... A poor Jamesy bird boy, take a flight dumb, Jamesy boy. Far above the ridiculous you are, Jamesy boy..."
"Guys, I have to go." A third voice makes an appearance, Draco hears Neville squirming instead of just hearing Ernie's voice. He's been through so many times that it's more of a predetermined state in his memories of Longbottom.
Draco turns around and is shocked when he sees the thong Neville sent him that morning. His blood runs up her neck and he is quick to hide it.
Damn, Neville thought. Fireworks blazing in his mind. As brilliant and scandalous as the ones released by Fred and George Weasley during their fifth year. "Damn, yeah!"
Shame grows in his body, the blood runs up his neck until his face feels hot, and he just wants to cry and disappear, sink into his misery or drown in this lake. Anything is better than having Ernie Macmillan in front of him when he's wet and with a balloon of mucus up his nose.
"Do you really notice if boys are handsome, Weasley?" Draco asks mockingly, but actually he's rather surprised. Did Weasley like men? The only thing he could remember was that emotion that filled his face when Viktor Krum arrived at Hogwarts, but no more.
"Come on up pretty, please," Draco thinks without taking his eyes off the potion. He's about to pray to Salazar to get Harry out of his living room and out of his life, if only the guy weren't some dumb idiot.
"Don't fight." Draco separates them with a stern look and a flick of his finger that pulls them back. "Evan, don't tell your friends' secrets, and Edward, I'll ask you not to copy anyone's essay next time, you're too smart for those things."
"Thanks for joining me, Ernie, see you." Neville speaks quickly before heading down a hallway to climb the stairs to his room.
"What is all that?" Neville points to the owls coming and going with more and more letters that appear to be from the ministry.
He closes the door behind him, noticing immediately that there was a silencing spell in the room. Of course, McGonagall wasn't an idiot.
The first few months of the new year are always Draco's favorites, with the spring graffiti coming in and Quidditch matches the order of the day, he barely has time to be distracted by his own thoughts.
"Muggle singers, I imagine." All three nod. "Edward Lupin is a good student, brilliant, although he is not good at potions, my godfather told me that neither Lupin nor Black were good at potions. I guess there wasn't much of a chance that he would stand out in my class, but he excels in the choir, even though... he's too naughty and I've already had him in detention three times in the year."
"What are you doing here, Draco?" He asks through his teeth with a fake smile and his ego on the floor.
"You'll see that it won't be like that, boy." Flitwick smiles at him one last time before saying goodbye.
"I have to wait until this floats and it's ready," Draco explains, wiping his hands. Harry comes fully into the room with his hands in his pants pockets and advances the entire length until he's also in front of the desk.
Observes around him the majestic plants in the small greenhouses that rest on the ledges. A click comes from the bottom and Neville turns with a grin ready to meet Hannah.
"I think you'll have to go out to Hogsmeade to buy some pepper potion." They are in the staff room. Harry has stacks of papers around him and the letters keep pouring in through the window.
"And I already signed us up." Draco's gaze rivets hard on Haven's body. She smiles slightly undeterred. She has large teeth and full lips, which makes her indifferent smile stand out a lot.
"Merlin, Christine." He brings one hand to the bridge of his nose and takes a deep breath. "I've already explained ten times that absinthe is not added at the end." He's desperate to get a good potion for today's class of at least one student.
Of course Draco has a meeting in the Slytherin common room. They all look quite upset that they have to waste an afternoon off being nagged by a teacher for something they didn't do. But for Draco they can go a lot to shit. He doesn't have the time or desire to know who the hell bothers to receive an afternoon of reprimand.
"Yeah, he was! We met once for Mione's birthday, yes, I remember. Remus baked the most horrible cake I've ever seen, and look at Fred and George always blowing up their cakes, but he was good, I admit it. And you know, Hermione likes details,
"I wore this all my years as a student, loyalty is screwed up for me right now." Harry nods with a smile, extending the robe to his partner. Even he can hear the nervous giggles from the closest girls at the Slytherin table.
"They had no problem, Lily was a bit shocked, but ... by now she was a totally open mind and heart. After all, her best friend was a werewolf, right?"
"It's early," he says, moving closer. They're a couple of steps away, he uses it and leans in to whisper in his ear with a laugh. "Enjoy the night?"
How is Ernie MacMillan supposed to realize that Neville Longbottom is the love of his life if they are always running into the worst moments? If there was no snot dripping from his nose, then it was sweat running down his forehead. There is no better aphrodisiac than body fluids, right?
"There it is! We are going to Japan." An excited Evan jumps in his place, out of Haven's grasp. "I heard that one of Taiwan's most famous magizoologists teaches there. Is it true that they are transported in dragons?"
The potion explodes and the room smells a strange mixture between garlic, onion and expired meat. A coral cry leaves its classroom and the first thing to appear is Potter that has an expression of worry painted on the whole face, as if I had seen who-no-should-be-named half the corridor giving you sweet to the first anus.
"Do you think he will choose me over his family? I don't even know if we are the kind of friends who occasionally send mail to each other."
"You are a bad listener." Neville denies it. "I didn't know you cared so much about the chorus. Even I didn't know you cared so much, especially," he says, resting his chin on the back of his chair. "However, I think they're looking for a new choir teacher, McGonagall loves these recreational things that keep the guys out of the adventure seeking attempts." Neville shrugs. Draco takes a step back, leaning his back against the wall next to the coffee table. They remain in a new silence until Neville suddenly straightens up as if Merlin had given him the answers to his doubts. "She could bring Myron Wagtail!"
Draco then waits for the remainder of the week in the infirmary and Neville tells him that he and Harry were with him the entire time since the incident and forces him to eat to his limit. Pomfrey doesn't let anyone see Draco for his upcoming recovery and part of him is glad to know that his students have wanted to see him, but he also knows that he's not taking account of the Quidditch team and the idea is killing to him.
Harry and Ron laugh in unison. "We are not surprised either. His parents' school record was a mess."
Harry laughs again. Draco doesn't believe it is an effect of alcohol because it is very early and Harry Potter has good resistance to alcohol. But it's the first time he's seen him laughing like that with him, despite truces in recent years.
"I... I don't know, I don't know if I can go alone, what if they tell me things I don't want to hear like- like with Snape?" Draco lifts his head, meeting the gaze of the two men. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to-"
The woman nodded with the same expression as always. Even though they were adults now, Draco was still a bit intimidated by the woman. With her graceful posture and imposing aura, everything about her screamed that one wrong move could cost you dearly.
"You know Ron, he's proud of her." A new horde of letters arrives at Harry's desk, he whimpers, Neville even feels a little sorry for him. "I can help you with that when I get back."
Girls like Noelle don't live quietly, and people like Gilbert and Jerome aren't happy until there's no blood between their fingers.
During the trip back to Hogwarts, everyone was talking about the recent expulsion of Jerome François. He quickly became the gossip of the trip and theories abounded everywhere. Some even claimed that he had burned down the Hufflepuff bedroom. Neville couldn't tell as a teacher, but he was glad he didn't have to deal with Jerome ever again (or at least not at school). Especially if he had planned to set Hufflepuff's bedroom on fire.
"A tracking potion is quite similar to a heart compass, it can be poured onto a piece of paper that will allow you to track a person," he explains. Now he's walking around the room glancing at his students. "Much simpler than a spell, yes, but less complex. It will only allow you to see a specific person and there should be a strong feeling towards that person. The so-called bond of union."
Harry Potter doesn't like him one bit. Harry Potter is a mustard seed in a jar of walnuts, nothing special, just something strange, small and irrelevant, just a tiny fraction of his life. Nothing special happens with Harry, he's just his old childhood enemy.
By instinct, the first thing he does is try to ask what is happening, but he can not even open his mouth when he's already closing it quickly. He takes two of his fingers to his nose pressing her in an attempt by no smelling. Suddenly, everyone's eyes have tears by the stinging of the strong smell that floods the room.
He makes sure to catch the opposite gaze and silently ask if he can, if there's a chance that he has permission to do so, and it's Draco who starts the approach before he knows it.
"And what have you done?" Dean asks taking a seat at the table, Draco assumes he's being brought into the conversation.
"Good afternoon, Professor Malfoy," Harry said, entering the room with a pale face and a wince that didn't look very well combined with his kind smile. His generally messy black hair was far worse than a nest of dragon eagles.
The rhythm of Black Cardigans was stimulating for anyone, it wasn't even necessary to know how to dance, the song itself carried you. ''Be-Sexual'' was her latest hit and was playing on WWN radio despite complaints from some pureblood families. Neville as a twenty-six-year-old bisexual man couldn't feel more identified by the lyrics of the song that spoke of a girl in love with his best friend and fascinated by the beauty of a Quidditch player. Rumors even spoke of Falmouth Falcons player Gilbert Anders as the inspiration for the song. Gina Brilliant's voice was great and it worked like a pretty uplifting vitamin. Full of unmatched energy.
"Gilbert found me looking at- Peter Helmings," he explains, "then he pushed me against the stairs and said he would tell my parents that their son is a... faggot." Connor was crying. At this point, Draco was no longer worried, he was angry and turned to rage. He wanted to go and hit Gilbert with his own hand. "He's been doing it since last year, but now we have more time together."
The outing to Hogsmeade is not as quiet as he expected, with the Halloween party so close everyone seems to be shopping for their dinners at the last minute, which generates a great fuss in the shops and on the streets of the small town.
Draco curses because of course he should have noticed. The party was not for nothing. Minerva would only do something like that for Harry Potter.
"It's not fair that we pay for it! Jerome screwed up those fags and the Quidditch team was the one-"
Then Dean Thomas takes the stage where he announces Black Cardigans and the screams increase when they announce that their first song of the night is their latest hit "Be-Sexual". Some girls at tables near his stand up ready to dance and Draco pours another glass of pomace, his fingers feeling too out of control and weak as he tries to hold the bottle of pomace.
"My friend by correspondence," he replies. "We met by the Fans Club of the Montrose Magpies, it turns out that she studied in the same year as my uncles, graduated in 79, we're very compatible. She is married to a girl, I think she is called... uh, Dorcas?"
That weekend he packs what is necessary for a round trip in two days, maybe they didn't even stay in the house of the two women, but a cautious man is worth two and better safe than sorry. Like on that trip he took with Neville at Easter last year when the plan was to rent a cabin on one of those beaches in Mexico, and it turned out that they didn't even have a reservation and they came back like dogs with their tails tucked between their legs. And instead they stayed in Neville's apartment which was a lot bigger than Draco's fucking room and had French fries with lots of mayo and ketchup.
"For God's sake, Haven," Evan murmurs in the background, tugging at his blonde curls in exasperation.
The man nods hanging his backpack over his shoulders and thanks him for the millionth time for accompanying him, and he says that it is not a problem, for the millionth time, but swears that if Potter thanks him one more time he is going to kick him.
Draco groans wearily and tousles his hair. A couple of strands fall across her forehead, but he doesn't even care anymore.
"Where will I sleep?" Harry asks with the cup resting on his right thigh as his left moves up and down rapidly.
The gray clouds spread in the sky like smoke, Neville quickens his pace as the rain begins to fall hard. He puts on his coat cap, but it doesn't seem to be enough, so the second thing he tries is to teleport as close to Hogwarts as possible.
Connor begins to hyperventilate looking more annoyed, as if the dementors are going to come in at any moment to take him to Azkaban. Like he'd killed someone and then left his body in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle.
"I was just going to say hi." Harry is still leaning against the door frame as if there is nothing better to do.
"What are you doing here?" Spits. Harry doesn't back down. He maintains a desperate and worried expression.
He liked Neville, he was a good boy and he didn't hate him, which was the important thing at this point. He had a fondness for talking about exotic plants up to his elbows, true, but if you could divert his attention, he was someone interesting to carry on a conversation with. He had become "hot", as the girls defined it, and that led him to receive confessions from students at least once a month. And it would have been funny if it weren't because it was actually scary.
Harry and everything his existence implies are wearing him out. The team that is excellent, but not extraordinary; the classes that nobody seems to understand because maybe he's a bad teacher and nobody had made him notice until now and even the endless tasks to grade that make him consider putting all that shit of homework down the drain. Everything, absolutely everything is consuming it in a slow and painfully painful way. As if what little youth he has left at twenty-six is evaporating, leaving him in a poor shell.
They all go back to their rooms amid murmurs and curses that they think Draco can't hear, but he does. And his words are so silly that they don't even bother him. Lives a life as an Ex-Death Eater and he've heard worse than "blood traitor."
"I'm sorry, I think- I need to use the bathroom, if that's okay with you?" Harry has naturally sleepy eyes, despite having big eyes, they always look tired, probably due to the shape of his eyelashes.
The two are silent for a moment until Neville asks again. "What did you have planned for your future Draco?"
Draco was adding the latest ingredients to the calming potion for Neville. He rummages in his closet for the oleander leaves he needs to finish, but he can't find them anywhere. He curses internally because it was obviously a bad idea to start preparing without counting all the ingredients ready and at hand. He keeps looking in the closet until he sees them in a box on top. He takes his wand to bring them with him.
"Why not? Oh... does it bother you, Malfoy?" He asks and Draco chokes on his tea. Are you homophobic?
Wake up after what he feel was a long and heavy dream. The back of his head hurts and his mouth feels dry. He's lying on a stretcher in the infirmary with his head bandaged. Open his eyes with the clearest view. He meets Neville sitting to his left and looking away he finds Potter sitting in another chair with half his body on the stretcher beside him.
"No, I'm not playing games, that's all." Harry says in his commanding tone. And if he was one of her stupid admirers he might be scared, but he isn't and he doesn't give a shit about anything Harry Potter can say or do so he reaches out to snatch the bottle from his hands. Between the struggle Draco ends up throwing the contents of the bottle on both of them and Harry snorts. Draco laughs for a second until his pants feel too sticky. "We better go clean up."
Draco stiffens in place for some reason. He feels his heart pounding inside his chest as if he's going down to his stomach and up to his throat.
"Thank you for- for helping me and for the potion, I wanted to send a letter as soon as possible, but you know, exam season."
"You're doing a great drama, Draco," he murmurs with a combination of patience and weariness. This is not leading to anything good. "You should be objective, you are an adult. He'll not cheat because it is not something he likes to do."
Frowning, Harry nods at him, pointing to the cauldron. The volcanic rock has already gone up, the potion is ready and if he give it to him quicker he'll soon get it out of his sight. He takes a container and pour as much liquid as he can into it. He makes a note with clear instructions and hands him the knob. He takes it and looks at it for a couple of seconds without bothering to thank. He wants to tell him to leave, but it's not necessary because Potter is already leaving the classroom until he stops in the middle and without turning to look at him he says:
Draco snorts rolling his eyes. Neville is unfazed and doesn't leave. "I'll go to my room," he says, throwing his coat over his shoulder. Neville takes his arm and keeps his gaze on him.
"Oh no, nothing. I was informed that my sister was hospitalized in a Muggle hospital in Brazil and I'll have to retire for a while. I wanted to say goodbye and wish you both happy holidays." Neville runs up to the woman and embraces her in a tight hug that is reciprocated with the teacher's bright smile, however, they can both notice the concern in her gaze and Draco also comes over to wish her well in the near future and her sister's speedy recovery.
"Thanks for the invitation, Ernie, but I don't think it's ideal." Draco laughs sarcastically as soon as Harry finishes speaking.
Neville clicks his tongue. "Did you forget the fifth year? Because you left more than half the group in awe of your lessons."
Harry grimaces. Since when were his eyes so green? Not just green, but seriously, really green. Like two sparkling emeralds in his eyes he would be an idiot if him didn't stop to look.
"I love him, how I love a friend, I suppose. Add a piece of that plant on your left on the cauldron." Harry does what Draco asks for quick movements. And Draco keeps playing the fool because he doesn't know what kind of information Potter is looking for and if he bothers him the idea that Draco may like him, then he can go to the devil.
Draco looks impatiently at the cauldron, then at the window and back at the cauldron. He doesn't want to be around Potter and he needs that rock to climb so he can give it to him and the guy to go.
Valentine's Day comes fast, faster than Draco would have wished, in fact. Not that he was a grump of the season especially. But he wasn't a fan of the whole scene Neville was setting up with his brilliant idea of allowing students to send each other heart-shaped lollipops, either. "It's to have funds Draco, funds, don't you want to have school trips like Merlin wants?" No, Neville, not really. But Valentine's Day was just one of his excuses for receiving candy from his students, Draco had already come to know that that idiot loved the attention and all the turns of "Oh, Professor Longbottom is very handsome and always smells like summer Wind." He was a jerk and smelled like owl shit, Draco thinked when he heard the girls talk about Neville like he was one of those Olympian gods.
Harry Potter had always struck him as one of those who sought fame and recognition, but apparently, they were all ideas of Draco himself.
Harry stops him by taking his hand and pulling the bottle out of reach. "That's enough, Draco." He hears him say, but he doesn't give a shit, he just wants to have more. "Draco, you are pale, you shouldn't-"
Draco flops onto one of the benches, quite exhausted from mulling over unimportant things like "what color should the spheres be."
The headache adds to the list of problems that accumulates in his back that Thursday. The day doesn't start well and doesn't seem to want to improve. He's teaching the second-year Gryffindor group. Everything turned to disaster and grunts of impatience.
"I got a letter on Saturday from the Magical Student Chorus Committee." Haven Kingsley leaps into place excitedly taking Evan by the arm, Connor watches her, but looks away quickly at Teddy. "I'll read it to you, listen carefully, okay?" The children nod, Draco clears his throat. "
Draco smiles as Kyle flips all over the place. Harry hesitates to see him brush past him. He's excited because if this goes well, the cup will be his at the end of the year and he'll have something to be proud of for the first time. Something that his father will not buy him.
Harry watches him dubiously for a couple of seconds before nodding and adjusting his glasses. "Yes of course. Why not?"
And okay, he's trying to push his recent fight with Draco out of his mind which is not good because Draco is not just anyone who gets mad and lets it go by with the days, he's more sensitive than that. He knows his routine, he's going to lock himself in his office to write the thousand and one potions that he knows by heart, and he's probably going to invent one that will not go well, so the next thing on his list is to cry and get depressed because again he will. He feels lonely and abandoned by the world (and he's being selfish for not clearing things up, but he must also mature).
"I was only fertilizing." Harry nods, is about to start checking the place out of curiosity when they hear footsteps and Neville looks up where it is completely blank. Harry also looks over at the footprint spot and sees a boy with the yellowest blond hair he's ever seen and a pompous expression.
"Professor Malfoy, you may retire. You and Professor Potter look tired, I'll take care of this." She smiles at him wearily. Draco doesn't have time to apologize because what did Potter have to do with the conversation?
"Everyone go up to your rooms, I don't want to know more about your stupid kiddiness for today. And for those of you who have been behaving, understand that none of this will affect your performance or grades, especially now that EXTASIS are on the way."
Sometimes Neville wondered if Teddy could remember anything about his parents, but the boy was only two at the time and it was almost impossible. Two years with Sirius and four with Remus, it all seemed like a bad joke from the universe. Look at the sweetest child in the world and take away both of his parents. Take the loneliest man, give him a second of love and take his life away.
The entire Gryffindor team comes down to congratulate Penny, Darrell carrying her in his arms celebrating. The Hufflepuffs also get down to the ground and come over to shake hands with the opposing team. Evan McGregor and Connor Tremlett climb the fence alongside Teddy, who greets them with a smile and slaps Connor on the shoulder when he sees him in Hufflepuff colors.
"Oh don't pretend you don't know, weren't all those Gryffindor girls pining for you when you got sick? Mr. Longbottom, can I put ointment on your neck?" Neville blushes and puts both hands to his ears as he hums to cover up Draco's bad imitation of teenage voices.
He had heard a couple of years ago from his grandmother that his mother loved to dance to the beat of a very famous muggle singer from her youth, David Bowie. And that Frank, his father enjoyed accompanying her despite his two left feet; and then the dance was no longer just shaking the hips to the rhythm of a guitar and a tambourine. Dancing was perhaps his only connection to his parents.
"Kirley Duke's guitar solo far outperforms Heathcote Barbary's," says Neville, clapping his hands across the table.
"Well, loving seems very hasty to me, I don't doubt that two children can know love, I'll tell you how Weasley and Granger looked at each other in the great dining room, but it is hasty, especially considering that you can't even speak when she's there close."
The bathroom lights are dim, a slight purple lighting, just enough to get a view of the place, not to have details, and Draco doesn't know if it's the light, the alcohol, the stupid voice of Zoe Rymar or the incredible solo by Katleen Buteercup, but bridges the gap between him and Harry and... and Draco kisses him.
Harry smirked, getting up to shake hands with the two men. "Well, I'm glad you're together now. I always imagined it, though I must say I'm surprised you're not in the fireworks business, Seamus."
Silence settles between the two again, Harry is playing with the napkin holder and Draco is looking around too self-consciously. There's a too pompous boy in the center of the court. He's wearing a horrible coat that looks like artificial animal fur and several boys are coming up to him to dance with him. Malfoy looks away quickly when a boy at the table across from him watches him. He's a handsome, red-haired guy with his hair tied up in a bun and a half-buttoned ministry shirt that reveals some tattoos.
"I already have the positions of your players, Malfoy, I'll show you this afternoon in the staff room." Weasley says holding the fork full of mashed potatoes in his hands.
I hope if someone read this they liked it, and I always appreciate a bit of criticism to improve. English isn't my mother tongue so I apologize for any mistakes.
They return to their path going to one of the tables at the back. Harry walks in greeting the owners' daughter and she tells him that her table is set aside as usual.
"Sirius never wanted to link his son with his family, the only ones who knew Teddy were Tonks, Andromeda and Ted. He even wanted to change his last name to Lupin." He says with a laugh. Draco smiles contagiously.
Harry flushes with anger and clenches his jaw as if he's summoning all of his strength not to hit this boy. The rest of the students argue that he should be expelled. And everything is too much.
"Gilbert is hitting Jeremy and Michael, Jerome François is with him. They are on the stairs to the second floor."
"They started!" Gilbert complains, pointing at the couple. "Those fags were kissing in front of me."
"You could have planted this staging! No one would be such an idiot to take it to cheat and put the stupid name on the label!" Malfoy shoves Harry.
He appreciated Fridays more than any other day. Usually it was his busiest day, but he didn't have to worry about the next day, and for a teacher that was a lot to say, especially when everyone seemed to have a problem with Potions, even the Slytherin students, and that was tremendously disappointing. .
He didn't have a good Christmas dance. He attended with Pansy Parkinson and everything would have been fine until the time when Blaise took him to a secluded place where he kissed him, managing to confuse many things in him. The following weeks he didn't speak to Draco and if he fell asleep in the bedroom, he didn't notice. Then in fifth year, Blaise asked him for an opportunity to clarify his feelings (of course it was only going to be his test, of course he didn't know it at the time, and in a way Blaise was his test too). He took advantage of his position as prefect to sneak out with him, but two months later he simply left with Pansy claiming he wasn't as interested in boys as he thought. No, let's just say he didn't treasure dancing very well.
"I'm afraid not I didn't know his parents long enough to know, but my mother told me that Sirius Black was good with the piano, and musical talent in general."
Draco mumbles how much curse hits his head, but the disturbance seems to stab everything he has left so he takes a deep breath until the heart resumes its initial rhythm. Turn his head where Neville came out just a few seconds ago and look at Harry Potter next to him again. His mouth is open with a string of drool falling down one side and his hair is more disheveled than normal. It's gross disgust and looks like any hobo he might find himself in the knockturn alley around every corner. If he been here a week and a half, that means the game is next week. He's no longer disturbed because there seems to be nothing he can do at this point other than wait for Pomfrey to let him go, but considering that he has been unconscious for more than two days he sees it as impossible no matter how much he does.
"Yeah, well, I don't know that, but it was annoying not being able to have a root beer with my friends."
"You're right, eighty points less every time one of you uses the word 'fag' and when I run out of points, I will suspend you from the Quidditch tournament, I will not allow you to do that kind of stupid thing while Slytherin is in my charge."
"After you told me about your masturbation routine? No, thanks." Neville laughs, like the big jerk that he is, laughs and Draco snorts.
Draco's life is usually quiet, yeah, he's a potions professor in a magic school and he is a former Death Eater who is called to testify once a month to assure the rest of the world that he is not dangerous and that he is not plotting the third wizarding war. And yes, his life is as quiet as it would be for a man who was on the wrong side in a war that took lives and alienated many other wizards like Theodore, leading them straight into the drab Muggle life of England, the one Draco he secretly wanted to flee on his worst days.
Thirty laps seems to be enough that morning when the chilly wind begins to chill his toes and he decides it's best to go back inside for breakfast. His belly is roaring like he's eaten a mountain lion and he walks into the castle with a smile, until Harry pulls him by the arm into the dining room preventing Neville from going to his room to change. Lots of glances cover him and his face flushes completely.
"Are you saving yourself for marriage?" Draco twists his lips, sighing and denying at the same time.
"You look handsome." There's a flirtatious tone about him that's barely palpable, but the smile confirms it.
Be that as it may, he had an office and if he could avoid Harry as much as possible, he would use it even if he didn't have coffee or cookies on the table next to him.
Draco's face turns white and when he tries to stand up suddenly he feels the overwhelming pain in his entire body that does not allow it and makes him return to his starting position.
"Well, that's all over, okay? Y-you don't have to compete with anyone, and you can still support all these kids, like you have Connor and Noel."
"Here it is, this is our table." Ernie stops at a table in the back. It's lucky unless he's away from the dance floor. "You guys want something? I can go get our drinks."
There was a moment of silence that Draco found disturbing, even for someone as quiet as him. He leaned across the desk and pointed to a chair for him to sit on.
Jerome is about to put a curse on Michael when Draco uses an expelliarmus to disarm them both. Connor luckily acts fast and takes care of taking the boys down with care. They are two students, a third year Ravenclaw and a fourth year Slytherin teasing two fifth year Gryffindors.
Marlene shrugs, playing with the pile of Quidditch team bracelets she was carrying in her hands. "But the three of us knew that Lily loved James, she would have put a stop to him if she hadn't and when they worked together they were the best team, Sirius was jealous."
Of course the man was occupying his thoughts since the night of the bar, or since he saw him two years after the wizarding war, even since they met at that Ginny party. And Merlin, Merlin knows it was never his intention, but he hadn't been able to stop the train of thought even in the showers, when his hands run up his torso and he imagines that they are Ernie's rough fingers touching every corner of his. And sighs come out. And then his hands go down to the hair mat and he feels so guilty that he can't go on.
Because it's nothing from Ernie, and this feels like a crime, like imagining Ernie doing to him Helga will know what. Is an invasion, and he doesn't know if that's the case, but he doesn't. He pushes Ernie out of his mind as much as possible and does nothing but change the temperature of the water because he now needs a cold shower.
Neville's face changes to something more annoying and he responds: "Well, apparently you had been skipping meals, so you were taking all this shit without a gram of food in your stomach." He scolds him, Draco frowns annoyed. Neville was no one to come to scold him for what he did and did not do. "Honestly, mate. What were you thinking without eating so long?"
After long training sessions that week, the Friday of the Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff game finally arrives. The stands were full in all the houses. The Slytherins were excited to see Gryffindor lose, the Ravenclaws supported their fellow Hufflepuffs and the Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs supported their respective house with pennants and painted faces.
In theory Draco yelled at him that he was gay, and then he kissed him when he was very drunk and very gay too, and it shouldn't be that hard to forget, but a voice in his head plays bad tricks on him, and Draco is a seeker following a golden snitch that pierces his chest and makes his heart race, making him wonder, what is the reason for the question?
Potter looks at him, green eyes that somehow look both annoyed and scared at the same time. And the gaze on his body only increases Draco's need to fight.
November had been a quiet month after his altercation with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, usually there was nothing to upset the stirrups in Draco's mind. All the students were getting better at Potions by then and the 7th graders they finally managed to create an almost perfect Amortentia. The suspension of the Slytherin Quidditch team was also ending that month and things couldn't be better, at least until Haven walked through his office door being timidly followed by two Hufflepuffs and a Ravenclaw. His long skirt accompanied by bright gray and pink rhombus stockings wavy with his constant bobbing.
"Not." Draco mutters, looking away. Is it possible that he doesn't look like the fool who was abandoned the night before Christmas?
"Are you staying somewhere?" He questions starting to take out his wallet to pay for the Whiskey and Draco thinks it's all at night.
"I won't even tell you I told you," he says with a humorous look, "but yeah, I told you." Neville mutters something that sounds like go to hell, but ignores it. "Go to my living room after the second hour and I'll make you something."
Oh, sweet Helga, why did you send this angel just now? Why when he's sweaty and red and definitely not very present to see the love of his life?
"My mother came to invite her and her mother to tea when my father went on long trips. Once she almost convinced me to get a piercing."
"What do you say, Miss Wolff?" Draco asks, standing up so fast that for a moment he gets dizzy. Connor shrinks in place.
Harry waves a hand in denial before speaking in a tired tone. "You need to rest. If you continue like this you will not be able to attend the Halloween party."
A girl raises her hand from the back, Draco speaks to her. "How many points will this assignment go up?"
The atmosphere, on the other hand, felt tense, in a way very different from any that has been between them. Even very different from the one they had during the war. And it all felt overwhelming, almost as if his lungs were shrinking and his stomach was creeping up his throat to be thrown up into a very tight knot.
Evan grabs Connor's sleeve and walks alongside him. The Gryffindor prefect appears and makes everyone go to their respective classes.
"Nothing sweetie, I just wanted to talk about your underwear in my room." Draco bit his lower lip, feigning innocence. And for Salazar to save Draco Malfoy, Neville would get his hands on that jerk as soon as Ernie left.
The woman nods without smiling. Teddy Lupin turns on a large microphone that makes a deafening noise at first, but immediately apologizes and catches everyone's attention by announcing the start of the match. Draco scrambles into place.
"I just wanted to ask you for a partner change for your advanced potions class," he says. Draco looks at him surprised and puzzled.
Evan McGregor and Connor Tremlett are auditioning for choir. Evelyn Wolff accompanies them and she also does auditions. They aren't amazing, but he lets them in.
Teddy blushes a lot more as he looks at the cup of tea that Draco sets in front of him. "I like her a lot, and Evan says that the same and I like her, but I don't know how to understand the girls because Gilbert says they are complicated, and more if they already met your parents, and well... Harry teaches her and helps her with Quidditch."
"Evan, let's go soon!" Evelyn Wolff appears pulling the blond boy away. "Gilbert Clearwater is hitting Jeremy McKinley and Michael Henderson-"
Connor and Evan step back after sharing a quick glance. Teddy stays in place without realizing that his teammates backed away.
"How have you and Harry been? Has he gotten into trouble? Has he already defeated another evil wizard or is he finally using the school for what he is?" Neville laughs. A loud laugh that catches the attention of some Slytherin and Ravenclaw students who, as always, are the most punctual.
After two classes with the Ravenclaw fifth-year group, Draco was finally able to relax in his office chair.
There wasn't much to hear about two adults so young they were barely old enough. Did his father like Quidditch? How did Frank meet Alice? Was she as beautiful as in the photos? Was she as smart as everyone said?
Of course Draco pulled out one of the envelopes and set about making tea for the entire afternoon of work that awaited him. At that moment an owl with a letter with the seal of the Malfoy family came through the window and dropped the letter on his desk. He sets aside his cup of tea and rushes to take the letter in his hands, he watches it carefully for a couple of seconds before deciding to ignore it as he has done since the war ended.
Draco walks into his living room as annoyed as can be and feels thirty-six pairs of eyes fix on him as he slammed the door. Draco regains some of the dignity that has fallen to the ground and snorts under his breath.
The music increases outside the bathroom, Draco knows this song and it is actually one of his favorites "Solstice fire problems", Katleen Buteercup's guitar solo was the best part, no doubt. He knows this is the part where Alana Jules choruses with Zoe Rymar and then something inside him moves.
"You know names escape me, Harry." Ron nods. "But hey, Remus with that hoarse voice that he had did not give one for music, although he still sang the songs of David Bowie and those of Queen at full volume."
"Me too. I've known him since I was eleven! We hated each other ever since, did you forget?" Neville narrows his eyes. How to do it if it is all he repeats?
Ron shrugs, carries a large trunk beside him, a new one. "Madame Hooch called me, she needed a substitute. I guess she got Weasley wrong, right?"
Harry takes a seat next to him and laughs, throwing his head down. It's a weird way to him, Draco can tell because he's seen him laugh many, many times.
Maybe it's Potter's sudden confession and collegial crush on him, or that he thought Harry was attractive his entire course at Hogwarts, but he can't turn away or stop feeling like he should kiss him.
"Mr. Malfoy!" Haven Kingsley rushes into the great hall with a smile that spreads from ear to ear. "Mr. Malfoy!"
"I have a couple of photos of them, one from the wedding and another couple from our student years. I'll give them to you."
"We're going to behave, aren't we, Connor?" Teddy says in that shut up tone that they discover us, and while Draco is not stupid not to notice, he ignores them.
Draco rolls his eyes and denies. "Ronald has a lousy taste in clothing, of course he would have for boys."
"Sh-shut your muh-mouth, Clearwater!" Another Slytherin girl yells at him. Noelle Charming, a fifth year girl who holds the hand of her best friend, Rio.
And it's not "for some reason" because he knows perfectly well why he feels this way, and yet his pride doesn't allow him to apologize to Harry for having kissed him.
"It's about the planning the Quidditch match," he says. Draco obviously, what else would Harry Potter be interested in? "The next game is Slytherin vs. Gryffindor."
"Yes, why not?" Draco replies with a shrug because who is he to turn down a beer, especially if it's free.
"Gilbert has been harassing me," he responds quickly, avoiding direct eye contact. "He hasn't stopped since... He does it all the time, yesterday he said that..."
This causes Draco to laugh out loud which is followed by Harry who leans over towards the box with decorations and falls almost crushing the decorations, causing both of them to laugh much more than before.
"It's an unbranded torture spell, ancient magic that leaves only the sensation of pain. Unfortunately it doesn't fall under the ministry code." Harry twists his lips. Draco is pissed off, but even now he knows that making a great scene won't do any good, it's no one's fault in that room.
"I told you to call him Professor Potter, Lupin!" Professor Flitwick admonishes Teddy. A general laugh is heard when he apologizes.
He's locked in the staff room with Weasley and Potter, and knows that they too are secretly hiding from the students who were taking advantage of the date to confess, and Harry had already suffered the havoc that morning, according to Weasley. He was about to give his Defense Against the Dark Arts class when a Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes rocket came in through the window and left an explosion of pink smoke that said "Professor, would you be my Valentine?" signed by a fifth year girl. "I've never seen Harry so upset, I guess the girl won't speak to him after that." Well, how much did you tell her, Potter? He wanted to ask, however he didn't because Harry still looked upset.
"Oh... I must go, see you in front of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes on Saturday in two weeks at nine, okay?"
He's behind a curtain that Draco didn't even remember him being there before. Inside, there are several tables that have a wooden base surrounding them so that no one can see what is going on there and an opening so that customers can enter and exit.
He doesn't need to dwell on the question because as soon as he leaves the principal's office, he finds Harry Potter sitting on the floor half asleep in a position that doesn't look very comfortable. He feels his heart stop for a second to go down to his stomach. Metaphorically, of course.
Neville looks at him. Eyebrows raised up and mouth slightly open quite surprised. He immediately denies as if he is taking something off and stands up. "You?" He points at him with a smile. "Draco Malfoy as choirmaster? That would surprise me to see. And let me tell you that, Hagrid showed me Ashwinders eggs, I just thought it would be impossible for anything else to leave me speechless." Draco crosses his arms in annoyance.
They knock on the door, the number thirteen, it takes two seconds to open until a black woman opens the door. She wears a scarf that covers her head like a tiara. She takes off her reading glasses slowly and gasps several times before either of the three can speak.
The two of them sit face to face, the tea is already on the table and Draco hands him the box of cookies, he of course takes one, and luckily for Draco, it's not one of his favorites. And he's fine, he's a selfish motherfucker, he admits it. But in his defense, anyone would be if he could only get cookies of this quality once a year.
"Lily? She was a beast, especially when it came to James "look at him, he's an idiot, I wish he would stop following me" and then he would entangle her feet with a spell."
Draco doesn't wait any longer to take long, heavy strides straight towards the students, he can hear the children following him, but for now he ignores them.
Draco stays in position until he opens the door carelessly and frowns so hard he gets dizzy for a second.
"From your face, anyone would realize that it was a shitty day." Someone says behind his back. And no, it's not what he needs now. Of all that could have come, this is what he least needed.
"Right." The woman pulls her half-moon glasses up the bridge of her nose and crosses her hands on the table. "I've known Miss Kingsley for a couple of years, and I'm think I want you to explain the situation to me without the girl's lengths."
"The important thing is, that idiot won't hit anyone here again," Cecyl chides, squeezing Evan's hand and giving Teddy a quick glance.
"Neville! Are you okay?" Man's heart stops when he hears that voice. He turns in the water feeling the drops fall hard on his body that is shivering with force. Ernie Macmillan, so handsome with his blond hair and hideous Muggle sweater, watches him with huge blue eyes and an expression of palpable concern.
He guides all the students from him to the courtyard, some are laughing, and others are complaining. Jake Goranski turns away from the group, too embarrassed as to approach Christine Roland.
"Hermione is opening the case to create better conditions for them, they will no longer be locked in cages during full moon nights. Or at least that's the idea, Harry is researching one of the enchanted forests in Wales to make a refuge." Neville explains. "I found that they have trees with healing roots that will help them."
"When we saw the reaction of the others we knew we could tell them about ourselves." They both hold hands with smiles until Marlene shakes her head. "But you, young man, don't come to hear stories from your mother's old friends."
"Oh, yeah, Ron told me about it a couple of days ago." Neville nods with his cheeks still very red, he wants to run to the nearest bathroom to wipe off the light layer of sweat that falls on his forehead. But sweat is sexy according to some of the girls. Neville begs that Ernie thinks the same.
"Who, Frank? Oh come on, Moony, the man was in love." Sirius appeared with an arm around Remus's shoulder. Teddy slept in the armchair near the fireplace.
"Uh." Draco didn't expect that. Clears his throat and looks away... embarrassed? "Yeah, thanks, well... they played well too."
"I like... boys." Connor whispers it so softly that for a moment Draco doubts if he has heard correctly or if it is a game of his mind taking advantage of the familiarity of the situation.
"Damn," Draco murmurs, dropping his face into his hands as a sign of his own defeat. He's being very soft on them. He may hear his godfather reproach him for not sending them six homework scrolls, an essay on how wormwood is not added before the crystal drops.
"Hey! Watch out." Draco bites his lower lip hard, closes his eyes resigned. Holy crap, why today of all days? Why today? "Draco ... hey."
"You are correct, Professor, and I want to think that you have no problem with my sentence, am I wrong?"
The woman nods satisfactorily. "I imagine you have classes tomorrow, so I'll let you go for now. Goodnight."
The boy opens his huge blue eyes pleadingly. "There wasn't that much information on French beans, Professor! I searched even under the shelves."
The two remain silent. The radio continues to run on the Wireless Magic Network and when the Macbeth witches' turn with "Do the Hipogriff" ends, Draco stands with the papers from the last job he commissioned from his class in hand. Neville continues to hum the song on the radio as he grades his students' homework.
I have a quick point to clear up so as not to create confusion and this will be explained in more detail later. Here Teddy was born in 1994 and not in '98 as in the cannon. But he is a third year student. And Neville's parents died months after they received the cruciatus.
"Miss Kingsley, I didn't expect to have you here," he says politely, but hopes the slightly stern tone will stop the girl. She still had third-year Gryffindor class essays to score, and the conclusions about ginger in healing potions were mixed. Especially if you had Emmeline Vance's daughter in your class, as upright and strict as her mother, but clearly less introverted.
"Is Potter staying too?" Draco tries hard not to sound annoyed. He hadn't fought Harry in a week, and apparently, they were on good terms since the bar incident and his drunkenness. Longbottom nods calmly. "And what is all this for?"
They are at the beginning of February, the snow continues to fall, but the sun already illuminates the mornings and although the children can still skate on the lake, the snow is already melting between their fingers.
The gleam in Teddy's eyes was indescribable, especially since discussions to improve conditions for werewolves were under discussion.
"Neville sent me for a potion." Harry Potter calls from the door frame. Draco curses as he jumps into his place in shock.
"You just yell a lot, you're always yelling," Neville murmurs from his desk stuffing a crisp into his mouth. Muggle junk food was something they had become a fan of in recent days.
"The necessary ones to have the opportunity to pass with Exceed Expectations, because I don't expect less from my students and if I have to send them more homework during the year, believe me I'll, and I wont be happy to waste my free time grading assignments that shouldn't be necessary. Now, get out your cauldrons and ladles because we'll talk about how to properly mix a purple garlic to practice dissolving dragon scale substitutes. Quickly!"
The last day of school isn't normal for anyone, much less for Draco who has to deliver a decorating plan to Principal McGonagall before dinner, and also needs to receive the list of students who will stay at Hogwarts during the holidays. All this while several owls fly through the halls dropping sweets canes on the heads of the unfortunate fool who's walking to their classes.
"I'll have my first class at eleven in the morning," he says. He wants to tell him that he doesn't mind knowing about his class and that he knows he doesn't care either, to stop being friendly or shit, but he doesn't.
Although the most obvious thing after the war was to accept that blood differences were dangerous, important families like Jerome's did not understand. And Neville couldn't be more glad that they took that kid out, especially with all the bullying he was giving Noelle.
"You have to drink Flitwick's smoke liquor," he laughs. He notices Draco's presence and points it at him, he rolls his eyes. "Come in Harry, or are you also being a bitter fool?"
"We weren't doing well living together after the first three months," he sighed. "Seven months later we canceled the wedding and I decided it was best to end the relationship, she agreed."
"What happens?" Harry laughs at Neville's sudden behavior. He turns and takes it by the lapel of his coat.
The group looks at him in alarm, as if a screw had been removed and he's now whinnying with insanity. Draco narrows his eyes and raises his arms to move them.
"You know, I was in love with you during school, I mean, I liked you a lot." Draco feels a hole dig into his stomach and he suddenly gasps for air. And why is it so hot here?
Something in the environment felt strange, it was not a matter of the season or the effect of alcohol on his body taking over his mind. There was something surrounding them, something like magic that rose through his body when he cast a spell. Something just like when he rebelled against the dark lord.
When Draco was younger, probably at fourteen or fifteen he discovered that if he played chess with Crabbe or Goyle for more than fifteen minutes a little tic would appear in his left eye, then with the arrival of the fucking dark lord and his family getting him into shit that they were too much. Too much for a sixteen year old who hardly knows enough about the world around him to have to choose a path without favorable options. Everything about him during that time was a stress that consumed him, left him without sleep, and became thinner. He lost any trace of the tic despite everything, not even the war made it come back to him. But here is this girl who cannot measure more than 5'5 and makes her tic return in less than a mandrake cries.
"Punishments don't make people like them change," Draco mutters. He doesn't expect any of them to understand, but for some reason, the look Potter gives him is quite alarming. As if he knew everything that was going on in Draco's head.
"Macmillan notified me, yes, with one of those hot and devoted letters of his, let me say." Draco takes the tip of the collar of the shirt, fanning it, as if it was a first-rate heat. Neville clicks his tongue in annoyance, and Draco slaps himself on the shoulder in congratulation.
Seamus Finnigan arrives right next to Dean Thomas spilling some of the drinks he was carrying on a tray. Draco winces at the noisy man.
The atmosphere is tense. Draco clears his throat, going from behind the desk to taking his place in front of it, leaning back. The glances quickly come to him expectantly. A final Ravenclaw student runs in and takes his place in the back. Draco casts a spell and the door closes. He recognizes a some of students, the others have been erased from his memory, or their names just don't seem to be on his mental list.
"If something bothers you you can tell us, I know you like to have the professor's room just for you and for... Neville, I suppose you are very close, right?"
Harry nods with a reassuring smile patting him on the shoulder. Draco is about to speak when Ernie appears from the crowd of people with a smile and Neville seems to tense up because, yes, Draco had to admit it, the boy looked good. He was wearing black jeans and a gray coat rolled up on his arms, which somehow gave him pale skin a bit of color.
"I still have to punish him," Harry says, cleaning the lenses of his glasses, and there the green of his eyes stands out. Emerald, like stone, there is no doubt about that and even on cloudy days, brown skin shines like in the summer, in that golden tone painted red that makes thick eyebrows and long eyelashes give it beauty. special. "I'm in charge of him after all, and I don't want to wait for him to do his thing."
Draco stops looking at the cauldron. He arches his eyebrows and crosses his arms. Probably annoying? The devil is wearing it. Neville could have told him that Harry Potter would come to teach at Hogwarts, they were in contact all the holidays, there is no excuse that is worth not having told him.
Draco turned his gaze to the blond boy again, surprised to see that his hair was as red as his face. It would have been fun another time, but not this time.
"He'll never be interested in me that way, will he?" Harry purses his lips and drapes an arm over his shoulder to pull him into a hug. "What a fool I am! Who would date a dumb herbology professor with Atticus as a friend? Surely they are boyfriends... Oh no, they are boyfriends and they are the perfect couple. Atticus Bulstrod and his beautiful brown hair, why would Ernie want another blonde?"
"I'm a professor of potions, Potter, of course I can," he says winking at him, what Harry responds with a laugh. Draco whispers an Accio in a low voice and the potions materials of him appear in front of him. "Listen well," he says, applauding. "On his way as Potions Students will find... severe situations, so I'll show you how to make a potion to imitate the dragon mucus. Does anyone want to be my assistant? I'll give ten points to the house of the one who comes."
The cunning way he had gotten to his office was the same when he left. He obviously relished the opportunity to tease him, and he could feel him savoring victory by ruining his life (which honestly isn't an exaggeration). But he was very wrong if he thought it was going to make things easier for him, especially if Harry was making fun of him.
"Hey, Draco." Neville staggers toward the crowd of people dancing around him until he finally reaches his side. "You come to dance"
Draco wanders between the Slytherin and Gryffindor work tables until class is over and some students say goodbye to him wishing them happy holidays. The last one is Florence, who, as is the custom with each teacher, decides to give him a gingerbread cookie in the shape of a bell. He thanks with a smile seeing Neville appear in the doorway with a mountain of papers and books on his arms.
Harry hands him a bottle that says Felix Felicis on the label. Draco gives it to him with outburst and reproaches that it is not from his team. He's convinced that this is not the case. They would never do something like that. The strange confidence of the boys that morning meant nothing; They had trained tirelessly for weeks, it was nothing but the confidence of effort.
"I don't see another war nearby so far, but you're going to fall on your ass with this. Do you know who else is teaching?"
"Well, it seems we lost, what a pity." Neville shrugs before walking down the bleachers to congratulate Potter who is waiting with the Gryffindor boys.
"Well ..." Draco holds out the vial with his gaze fixed on him, testing him, an incredible desire for a fight growing in his body. "Thank you for this."
This was bad, I know, the school is removing me the desire to write or do anything in general. But I promise that the next chapters will be long and will make sense.
Harry smiles at him, and it's all red cheeks and watery eyes and red lips with the tip of his nose slightly cold from the cold, or from the alcohol, he doesn't know, but he still runs his tongue over his lips feeling too dry of nothing.
"Just spit it out, Potter," he says, angrier than he expected. Red cheeks and a tingle up his spine making every spot on his body bristle. "You can't even look at me now, can you?"
"Exactly! Isn't the Weasley girl playing for a professional team? It's more logical to bring her and not Potter's accomplice."
"We have everything sorted out, professor." Fresia McKinnon shrugs. She's the captain, competitive by nature, from whom she would least expect so much trust, but perhaps she should trust the instinct of his students, they were no fools.
Evan and Connor present a gift to each other just after Evelyn hands him a small tube wrapped in gold foil. Victoire stays by her side even as everyone gathers to break the huge chocolate cake the elves made just for the occasion.
"A wonderful morning for a game, don't you think, professor?" McGonagall arrives next to him. Not surprised to see her there, she was a Gryffindor head and a huge Quidditch enthusiast. Maybe she'll give the magic points to Gryffindor if the world really wants to kick his ass.
But at the worst possible moment, his cold decides that it is time to play a bad trick on him and when he sneezes a balloon of mucus comes out of his nose. Disgusting.
"Teddy has Victoire to hand him homework! That is not fair." The bright red color lights up Edward's face and hair. The boy fixes his gaze on his friend in annoyance and shame. So she was the girl he was writing that song about.
And oh hell, being an adult meant not being shit, especially with one of the few adults who didn't shirk like he could bring the unnamed to life.
"What are you talking about? You were sick, it's not like you've grown wings and two heads... although that would be great, if I may say so." Ernie's hand is resting on Neville's shoulder in a comforting way.
The boys had no problem playing this way. The Princhester brothers were very good at playing as a team, they complemented each other so well that somehow their energy spread to the rest of the team. David blocked every quaffle Draco sent and Paris prevented a bludger from hitting her teammates at least six times.
"Yeah, yeah. Well, I met Ron through those Quidditch groups of fans. I was a hunter on James's team, Sirius was on the team for a while, but you know, he wasn't one to commit to anything, so free to do just one thing."
Draco's classroom bell rings, ending class. All the students collect their books and put the scrolls with the homework from the last class on the table. He smiles at Connor when the boy leaves a scroll at least a foot long. And he shakes his head when Evan walks over, leaving one barely four inches away.
He is ashamed of being a bad teacher and especially disappointed in his team. Annoyed at being an immature idiot who wasted his time thinking about Potter playing tricks on him as if they were still fourteen years old. He was an idiot who would never achieve anything. Not a steady relationship, not an apartment that wasn't depressing shit, not even a stupid worthless school mug.
"We couldn't expect less with Herms in command." Neville nods trying his best to smile, the stuffy nose killing him.
They enter the place where several glances are on both of them and the hisses do not take long to appear because it must be surprising shit to see Harry Potter walking in a bar with such a handsome man, of course.
"Man, I sucked for that..." Seamus mutters with a pout. Harry laughs happily and Dean kisses him on the cheek.
"No, no! I heard you, I heard you, "he says between laughter, moving both hands in front of Draco. "It's just what- demons, Draco."
There are three photos, one of the two women with Harry's parents, another of Harry's parents with Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and someone he recognized as Peter Pettigrew, but he had a spell and his face was not seen in the photo. The last one was of Sirius and Remus sleeping on the floor with... penises drawn on their faces and James Potter laughing in the background.
Draco doesn't expect anything else to put Neville aside and walk out of the teachers' lounge where Principal McGonagall came up with a back-to-school party or Merlin will know why.
"Is everyone on the correct page?" All eyes quickly wander to Edward Lupin, who always seems to have an answer when it comes to tipping things off.
"Why would what be a problem?" Harry asks coming out of Merlin will know where, and why the hell is everyone here all of a sudden? Better put the tea in case McGonagall needs anything.
"Oh." Haven smiles, biting her lip. "Well, I felt guilty for giving you all the burden of talking to Miss Miner - I mean, the principal, of course. So this morning it occurred to me to take charge on my own, so I just told you that you entered us in the contest. You're welcome."
Everyone remains silent as Pomfrey talks about Draco's condition and how he won't be out until after a few days of reviewing especially his meals. Which doesn't stop Draco to protest, although he's completely ignored by Pomfrey.
Harry appears in his long Quidditch robe and the trunk with each of the magic balls to play with. He says a few words to the students, the basic rules of the game, Draco guesses, and then sends them to heaven, they all soar on their brooms as Harry Potter takes the whistle between his fingers and then the game begins.
"Okay, you will agree on what is necessary, in this session we will take care of filling out the registration sheets for each of you."
"Why does this always happen to me?" Draco raises both hands to his head as Neville lies down on his bed. "Weasley, of all the people capable of teaching Quidditch, Weasley!"
"That doesn't surprise me, you were very good when we studied." Dean nods smiling. "Well, congratulations, man. Draco nods silently."
"Of course. Can you lean here while I clean up?" Potter points to the sink, Draco rolling his eyes and pulling away from Harry's grasp. "I think you're not very good at drinking... that's unexpected. The Weasleys have good resistance to alcohol, I thought it was a pureblood thing-"
The students are euphoric. Gryffindor is a screaming and banner mess with their house crest. Slytherin students have the same emotion, but they aren't that loud. Hufflepuff students talk to each other, don't pay much attention, and the Ravenclaws present are countable on their fingers. However, he's glad to see Connor for the first time in a match alongside Evan who sneaked away with his home.
"I didn't know they had this here," Draco mentions, wagging a finger in the air to point to the spot.
"I thought that we could coexist behaving like adults and not like immature children, I see that it is not like that."
The din is louder when Victoire and Levi are named. It was no secret that many considered them attractive and Davies even had a kind of fan club. Draco scoffed secretly, Teddy was too obvious how much he liked Victoire and from the girl's response, it seemed like the feeling was mutual.
But Neville is his friend and he hasn't said anything. He tells himself with a cool head, but you never know, and he's not one to go and yell that he likes men.
Draco rolls his eyes. "Don't be stupid, Longbottom, if that guy doesn't realize how handsome and smart you are it's because he's too stupid and doesn't deserve you. Also, have you seen Atticus? He is not one of those who have a boyfriend."
"Are you sure I look good?" Neville asks. He was wearing black leather pants and a red tank top under his gray coat, even wearing a pair of brown boots.
Draco can see Neville on the floor dancing alongside Ernie to one of those stupid Liam Hyland songs like they're really good. And he can't help but roll his eyes when Neville pretends to stumble to get closer to Ernie.
"Longbottom sent it to me." Harry's puzzled look tells Draco that he hasn't played well with his words. He shakes his head in denial, licks his tongue over his lips, and gasps a few times before correcting himself. "It's an old joke between us, we're not involved or anything."
Draco nods. "Mr. Tremlett, please call Professor Flitwick, I need him to discuss a matter about one of your students."
He leaves his robe on his chair and walks over to Christine Hemlett's cauldron to finish the potion of the day. Draco can see the tiredness in their eyes, but the hour is running out and the group runs away from the final conclusion. Nobody waits an extra second because they swear they had even packed their things.
"For today's game we have the newest Hogwarts teacher, Gryffindor house boss Harry Potter, as referee." A general cheer floods the field, Teddy smiles before continuing. "The first team to make an appearance is Slytherin. Fresia McKinnon is in the lead guiding the lineup, behind her is superb puncher Jerome François recovering from his injury last year. What do we have here! Gryffindor's Darrell Jones is not intimidated and flips into the sky, is that a Centella 3006? Wonderful! One for each team member. What a great game awaits us with brooms of that caliber."
"I think they like it." Neville punches Harry who continues to laugh. "Don't get grumpy, we're all excited for Teddy's thirteenth birthday."
"From the... uhm, the- the kiss I gave you." Draco clears his throat avoiding Harry's gaze at all times. Harry straightens up in his place, clearing his throat under a loud cough because he accidentally swallowed a piece of cookie. "I wanted to apologize for having behaved that way. And I know it was not the first time. So I'm sorry that you had to put up with me like that twice."
"Silence!" Draco yells red with fury. His hands tremble and if it weren't for the strange lighting the others would have noticed his watery eyes. "I want ... I'm sorry, director. I can retire?"
"I'll be a professor," he says. Look up, again they have eye contact. "I have Defense Against the Dark Arts class."
An owl came through the window, it was the fourth of the day that he was addressing Ron Weasley, but this time, his eyes lit up, Draco guessed it was a letter from Granger.
Harry is waiting for him in the corridor, he's wearing a navy blue coat full of colorful patches that if he were someone else would look like a tramp, but since he's Potter, it makes him look like one of those Witch Weekly models. He is leaning against the wall chewing gum with the scent of tropical fruits, he knows it because it is his favorite flavor, from his favorite brand and in his favorite size, Buumblue Gumm tropical fruit gum, medium.
Neville and Ernie arrive with their drinks amid some giggles and don't stop to talk when they decide to finish their drink to disappear onto the dance floor. Draco looks at the drink in front of him and snorts because he doesn't even like phoenix vodka. Potter for his part looks quite pleased with his brandy.
"A bit dangerous being here, don't you think?" They hadn't spoken since that early morning meeting. Draco didn't pay attention, the night was too captivating.
Ron laughs and Neville gives him a toothy smile. This definitely had to be the best surprise of the year and they were just getting started.
Draco smirks not knowing exactly what to say to a Ron Weasley who is being too nice to him. Until then he had been all neutral, with cordial greetings and including him in the conversation from time to time, but never like this. "Teddy is good, but he's not even close to mimicking the Macbeth Witches, he's calmer, he gives a resemblance to Gina Spektor, though. He's good, but he always insists on singing some ... uhm-"
Music flooded the room, The Goblins blared, Neville as always danced deftly, the colored lights shining on his face and the drink in his hand shaking to his beat. Draco always wanted to ask, if Neville hadn't leaned toward herbology and being a teacher, would he have been a dancer? The traveling circus of the Prichatt brothers always carried great dancers from Russia and Scotland. It would have been a good life, traveling the world without worries, receiving ovations from the public.
It's a cold Saturday morning, Draco forced his team to eat a light nutritious breakfast and then took them to warm up an hour before the game. Kyle the seeker was falling asleep instead and if he paid attention he would notice the disinterested atmosphere of his team.
"Madame Hooch," Draco says, straightening up in his place. Rolanda nods her head in greeting. "We were just playing around a bit. Something wrong?"
"Are you telling me you're not one bit interested in the Quidditch league?" Ron asks in that high-pitched voice Draco remembered from his arguments in the middle of the great hall. Neville denies. "Not even the Russian one? Boys are handsome."
Minerva nods, holds her small cup, and brings it to her mouth. "That's too long, if you ask me, things like that should be reported to me directly at the time. I hope this situation doesn't happen again for your sake, professor." Draco shakes his face serious. "And since you didn't come to tell me about this I will dare to let you know that your punishment will be to take care of the Christmas and New Year dinners this year for the students who will not go home."
Jamal raises his hand from the bottom, Draco moves his hand indicating him to approach and the child progresses with a smile. He collides the five with the twin brother of him Kham.
They don't talk to each other during the New Years Eve party, they don't hug each other at midnight, and neither looks at each other during the toast, and for some reason, Draco feels guilty.
"You guys are doing great. Anya, please raise your tone higher, I can't perceive you among your classmates. Edward, go to the back, you're covering up Evan. Connor, please I need you on the other side, yeah, right between Natalie and Felicity."
"Hermione is somewhat worried about the command of Aurors. He asked me to check a few things about the werewolf records." Neville nods calmly before letting out a big sneeze that makes him jump in place, some scrolls flying into the air. "You want me to go to Hogsmeade? You look... bad, mate."
"Oh, that's little. You couldn't have that pair separate, they used to send me to visit Tonks with Teddy to have the house alone."
The best thing Neville could do to calm his nerves after the request was sent to Hermione's owl first thing that morning was dance, obviously.
"WHAT I SEE? KYLE O'NEILL HAS THE SNITCH IN HIS HANDS!" The Slyhterin explode in applause and shouts of celebration. Kyle falls to the ground and everyone runs to him to celebrate. Draco prepares to run to his house to celebrate until he meets Harry's gaze with a smile that doesn't give him a good feeling, but the game is over and there's nothing he can do.
Neville curses them all. Draco, Harry, his cold, and that stupid Hufflepuff kindness that Ernie possessed in just the worst moments. Shit, if the man weren't so handsome...
Halloween night comes so fast that no one sees it coming. The potion Ernie sent Neville did its job in a timely manner and in less than a few hours the cold was gone, clearing the bridge for a grand celebration of fire whiskey and dragon smoke beer.
Merlin get down at once and kick him in the balls. It would be the perfect cherry on the cake right now.
"Yeah, I never really thought about that." Draco hugged himself to warm himself. "I still remember her wedding day, Ron was so scared, even when at eleven years old he called her a nuisance." A cheery laugh came from Potter.
Harry pauses and looks at him in a strange way. As if he were looking at something big, as if he was something good to see.
However, all these people seem to care too much, and he can't be a selfish bastard who has decided that being a killjoy at one of the most important holidays for wizards is his mission.
McGonagall closes her eyes and nods. Draco leaves as fast as he can, but manages to hear the punishment for his house. They will have two hundred points less on the final point count. Malfoy stops in the middle of the stairs, falling onto a step.
"Never? Like never before?" Draco rolls his eyes before shaking his head. "But you have had sex, right? Don't you do anything when someone makes you horny?"
"What?" He asks sharply, Harry stirring instead too focused on whatever it is except the man in front of him.
"The usual, please." There's something in the voice of the subject sitting next to him that makes him look at him, and for Merlin, not this.
Draco shakes his head repeatedly, bringing the tips of his fingers to the bridge of his nose. Everything turns a thousand times. "I think they should be expelled. Sooner."
Normally Draco doesn't like to share the cookie box he has hidden on the top shelf of potion books, however for today he can make an exception for Potter because he feels like a stalker who owes him more than stupid cookies he he even hid from his best friend.
"What's going on here?" Potter comes through the crowd, fixing his gaze on Jeremy and Michael and then turning to Draco for answers. "Is everything in order?"
"Come in." The door opened slowly, the boy ran into the office, closing the door behind him. "What's going on, Tremlett?"
"I took the Defense Against the Dark Arts position this year, I'm a teacher now." Seamus hits him friendly as a congratulation.
He never took care of anything at his house, and it's not like Draco was going to waste time decorating his apartment when he was the only one who lived there. No one would care if he didn't hang the stupid ornaments in his house.
"He's bad with alcohol," Harry says, looking at the cauldron. He doesn't make eye contact with Draco. "That's, it's generally more resistant. Professor Flitwick said he only had a glass of his smoke liquor."
That Tuesday he meets again with the students of the choir and is happy to receive two girls in the choir. Noelle Charming and Rio Wolff, both were in Draco's eye, especially since Gilbert and Jerome considered teasing them a good idea. Fortunately, though, Jerome was no longer a problem.
Neville turns with a grimace seeing his escape being interrupted, his mind is ready to respond with the first excuse that comes to mind, but when he meets the reddish hair and the sea of freckles, his mind goes blank, leaving a surprised and excited smile on his face.
His grandmother was never very expressive about anything, the less decent words that came out of her mouth, the better it seemed for her and for anyone. And Neville didn't have much time in the presence of Remus and Sirius to find out more than those old conversations at one of the Order of the Phoenix meetings during Christmas '96. They were such short and generic conversations that there wasn't much to get out of them.
So, Merry Christmas early! I hope you have enjoyed the chapter and the drawing I made about the last part. Hope everyone reading this has a happy holiday season or a quiet night. In my country there is still quarantine so please let us be careful with our health.
"I'm not an amateur, and we can make up for the points we lost in class today." They both turn to watch Evan and Teddy fight over the microphone. Neville cackles before turning his attention to Draco again. "You look a lot more upset than me and it's not even your team."
"Nice to see you this sweet afternoon, Draco." Neville walks in and drops the stack of papers on Draco's desk. He raises an eyebrow and Neville grins at him before breaking the news.
"What? What distracted you?" He asks himself with murming while he shakes his head, but Potter's blushing does not go unnoticed.
With the new occupation that was the choir his free hours were reduced considerably so Neville returned to spend all his time with Potter. He was taking his new best friend.
Oh, if only he wasn't a wimp to talk to Ernie Macmillan he wouldn't have to worry about making his cold schedule not coincide with Ernie's schedule things would be less pathetic.
"Oh, yeah." Finnigan adjusted the lapels of his jacket and smiled pompously. "I worked for a time at the Witch Cats stadium, then the circus until I ran into Dean and he offered me a position for special effects here. You'll see it when tonight's band arrives."
Draco picks up the fire whiskey and denies. "Thank you, I hope you found everything you were looking for."
Draco smiles gratefully at them, glad to have Haven Kingsley as his right hand man and a group of kids willing to take his side.
Of course, after noticing that this was not a temporary thing, Neville went to the infirmary to see Madam Pomfrey, however, right at that moment she was out shopping for supplies for healing potions. What luck he came to touch, and just when Draco was mad at him.
"I just wanted to tell you that I won't say anything." He says, his jaw tightening. "Thanks for the potion."
Draco knew Edward Lupin well, a student noted for his intelligence who was a year ahead of him, he was serious and handsome, just as he remembered Remus in his years as a teacher. But he also used to be sent to detention for getting in trouble with Evan and Connor; where oddly enough, Evan wasn't the mastermind behind his jokes.
The next morning nothing was clear in his mind, but if he was sure of one thing, it was that this wasn't his room.
"Do you want to come in for a beer? I invite you,” Harry says with that bright smile he get when he won a Quidditch match and someone told him (usually a teacher) that maybe one day he would be as great as his father.
He can see the pain in Harry, Draco knew of Sirius Black's death almost immediately. Bellatrix kept screaming in front of the Alphard Black painting while the man denied shattered. He himself was terrified of his family and cried as much or more than Alphard every night in his room until he fell asleep.
"Salazar, Kingsley." Draco ran a hand over his face wearily. They hadn't started the choir long, barely a couple of months, and that was a lot to say, rehearsals were limited to half an hour a week during exam seasons. "You definitely aren't ready for a public performance, much less an international competition where to top it off Beauxbatons students would be the near-perfect at anything. Did you at least check with Principal McGonagall?"
Neville accelerates his steps to cross the wave of people that flood the streets until he reaches the door of the botany. He tucks his nose into his Hufflepuff scarf and hides his hands in the pockets of his old corduroy coat (a Ron's gift last Christmas). After he learned to weave he seemed to have taken the tradition from his mother and decided to make one for each of his friends. The man was talented, by the way.
"We sing, we don't model, Kingsley," Zelina murmurs with her arms crossed. Haven rolls her eyes in response.
Neville is going home for the holidays and Draco is officially alone. Which sucks because he also has to take care of decorating the big dining room for the dates, and although Hagrid has been kind enough to leave the pine in place, Draco has no idea how to get started on the whole hanging ball and candle business.
"Together?" Harry asks, still looking sleepy enough to be aware of space-time. Draco suppresses the slight blush that begins to color on his cheeks, looking away.
Christmas was spent with the Weasley family, Neville's grandmother had passed away two years after the war and he had no one else for the holidays, of course the always cheerful Weasleys took him under their wing. For his part, Harry lived in the Black mansion with Teddy and they appeared together anywhere. Everyone loved talking about his parents with the little Edward. The great adventures of the sensible Remus Lupin and the rebellious Sirius Black.
Evan stands up carrying his briefcase in his hands. Draco looks at him curious, it's a briefcase decorated with figures that move all over the surface, he has photos glued to the back, Muggle photos that don't move and are quite blurred, he also has small dolls hanging from the strap, and it's probably the briefcase most colorful he had ever seen.
The next morning after the Halloween party, Draco set about handing out some of his hangover potion to all the teachers and the rest of the school staff, not before saving some for later. The first to arrive was Neville who had never looked worse, followed by Professor Flitwick who looked very calm even after he had finished a bottle of Firewhiskey by himself and at last he was excited to not see Harry the rest of  the morning. At least until three in the afternoon, when he was going through some things in his office until he showed up.
"Indeed, Professor Potter, those spells were used to torture prisoners in Azkaban two hundred years ago. It's quite alarming that a thirteen year old is using it."
"My bed already came with the room, I regret to inform you that I have no clue who the Petitgirard are."
"Oh, is that why you never shut up?" Ask mischievously. Neville makes a face and mutters something that sounds like "very funny Draco, you are very funny."
"Oh yeah, the intrepid Alice, she liked The Beatles, Neville." Remus nodded, holding a small cup of tea between his long, slender fingers. "George looked a lot like your father, he even imitated his hairstyle in seventh year."
"No, I'm not playing games, that's all." Harry says in his commanding tone. And if he was one of her stupid admirers he might be scared, but he isn't and he doesn't give a shit about anything Harry Potter can say or do so he reaches out to snatch the bottle from his hands. Between the struggle Draco ends up throwing the contents of the bottle on both of them and Harry snorts. Draco laughs for a second until his pants feel too sticky. "We better go clean up."
The next morning the weather didn't even seem to improve. Draco doesn't need to poke his nose through the window curtains to realize what a cloudy and rainy night it is outside.
"Don't put words in my mouth, Malfoy." Harry sounds furious when he says it, Draco is unfazed and on the contrary, all that does is to infuriate him even more. An enormous fury grows inside him. "Why do you only expect the worst from me when I try to get close to you? We are adults, leave that stupid teenage rivalry in the past. I played with you for a moment, but you took it too seriously." He brings a hand to his forehead and rubs his face, drawing a deep breath after the small space of silence. "I don't think you're a bad teacher, Malfoy. But you are being a prideful jerk. And yeah, it's okay if you don't want to have anything to do with me, I'll understand, but you're even ruining your friendship with Neville, and you're hurting him. As a friend of Neville's, I'm in a position to step in."
"You don't know, but you probably saved lives by kicking Jerome out," Rio told him after chorus rehearsal when Noelle was away, talking to Evelyn Wolff and Zelina Sylvester.
"We will start next week, you don't occupy Tuesdays and Thursdays after four because I hope to see you here."
"Uh, y-yes of course don't worry." Neville says. And Draco thinks at the time that if MacMillan hasn't realized how much Longbottom likes him, it's because he's just an idiot.
"We are separated now." He says without much regret. "I didn't mean to bother the Weasleys, and although Ron and Molly insisted that I go with them I feel like I should give Ginny her time."
Draco rolls his eyes in disgust, Ernie smiles shyly at him and if it weren't for his presence Neville would already be hammering right and left. "Ernie and I are going to a bar."
Neville rolls his eyes and snorts. "As usual. I'll sit by the fire pit, make one of those homemade tomato soups, and go to sleep thinking how much I wish I had a cookie, sinking into my misery."
Blaise rarely took the time to open the door for him, or woke up next to him the morning after he slept together so there were months when he didn't get much attention, but that's fine because that allows him to find a charm right now the one Harry says, "Come in and get comfortable."
Harry turns around without waiting for Draco's response and his figure disappears into the dark hall of the teachers' dormitory. Draco slammed the door and yanked his hair tousled even more than it already was. He hasn't spoken to Neville for almost two weeks, Draco avoided anyone who might question him about the last game, and that included students alike. And he wouldn't admit it out of pride, but he was ashamed, after all he had acted like an eleven-year-old boy.
Harry then lowers his gaze slowly down his arm until it stays on his forearm. There's a strange grin on his face and Malfoy can't figure it out. Instinctively he reaches into that spot trying to hide his arm from Harry's gaze. Maybe there's a Death Eater to catch after all.*
Harry smiles sadly at him probably for taking the first step, then Draco shows him where the bathroom is making a joke about how he could get lost in his apartment, Harry laughs slightly, but still seems quite lost.
"Good game, Neville." Harry reaches his side putting his left hand on Neville's shoulder and waving his right hand in greeting.
The waters had been calm between them since the last time, the one in which Draco stopped playing the puberty boy who doesn't know how to control his emotions, but that didn't mean that they now trust each other, not like that, at least.
Neville waved his arms in the air and wiggled his hips to the correct rhythm, shook his head from side to side and closed his eyes tightly feeling the music.
"I was telling Dean that I accompanied Neville on his date, but it's more of a pretext to come see you. How have you been?"
"If you plan to talk about Quidditch, I'm going to ask you to withdraw from my class." Draco gets to the center of the room calling the attention of his students. They're silent and Draco smiles triumphantly. "Now, add goodwhelming carefully, just a spoonful, no more, no less, unless they want that we all suck as the gases of the Trolls."
"And raising your grades on potions, you stinky dwarf." Harry appears next to him taking him of the tea Draco made for him to give him a sip.
"Holy shit, Draco, did they tell you pants aren't second skin?" Neville jokes, looking him up and down with a mocking smile that Draco responds to with a sly smile before slapping him on the forehead with his index finger.
"That's what you have Potter here for, right?" Harry was sitting across the room near Professor Flitwick who was taking a nap. The man waved his wand as he read some scrolls that floated in the air and an enchanted pen signed each page he finished reading. Neville turned his gaze to his friend and his lips twisted.
"Do I read it to you?" He asks and Harry nods, dropping into the spot next to Draco. "Good," he clears his throat. "Ron, it's a pleasure to greet you again, Cassie and I were in the same class as James and Lily, we were good friends with both, although more with Lily, I have to emphasize. Unfortunately Frank and Alice were a grade above us, so we didn't spend much time with them, sorry. To tell you about the exploits of the Potters in a letter would be a bit tragic, from what you mentioned, their son is with you, feel free to come with him to our house in Ireland, we'll tell you everything we know with pleasure, although we'll only be in Europe this week, we returned to Cassie's house in Puerto Rico. We also found out that Remus and Sirius had a son, send him our regards. We enclose the address, happy Valentine's Day."
Draco likes to be attentive to him, it is a detail that fascinates him in a man, and although he doesn't know if it's something that should fascinate him in Harry Potter, but the truth is that he loves it.
"I could use some fresh air, now that you mention it, friend Neville. Your garden has a lot of that, doesn't it?"
Harry scratches his neck, rolling all the hair of hair he has, and that he is already a disaster. "I did not pay attention to the beginning, I missed some steps."
"It was installed three years ago, I used to come here with Ron and Luna after work, it was more comfortable because outside… we attracted a lot of attention."
He saw no reason to have a second party when there was already dinner in the great hall. Did she have a boyfriend and was that why she was in such a good mood?
Draco nods taking the bottle of paprika potion between his fingers. Ernie says goodbye by conjuring an umbrella with his wand. He turns, ready to follow Neville.
"Yes, that's right, if you're not yelling at me, you're thinking of yelling at me." Neville shrugged. Draco now threw a ball of paper at him that landed right in the middle of his face and then landed on his potatoes. "Oi! Watch out for my crisps."
He's hardly had time to sleep for a decent few hours, no doubt, but his back hurts the next morning. Draco has not had the same luck as before and it seems that his anger manages to totally attract Harry like a magnet because he finds him everywhere. Round the corner of a hallway, in the staff room, on the Quidditch pitch, and even in the bathroom, where he just huffs and rolls on his feet.
"I'm sorry I can't, my week is busy with potions classes, and I'm helping Professor Longbottom in the greenhouse."
All it does is ruin whatever he touches. First Blaise, then Pansy, then his family, the wizarding community, Neville. Even the idiot Dumbledore who believed in his goodness, who saw not a dark wizard, but a frightened child. Scared for his future, for his life, for his parents.
"I don't know if she's my face, or my body, or my smell." He raises an arm to his nose to smell himself. "Maybe I still smell like my grandmother's perfume, I know that's why no one approached me before the sixth year, Shit! Ginny told me, and I ignored her, I deserve all this misery."
Neville and Draco sat together on the Hufflepuff bleachers. Neville had made a funny face after seeing how warm Draco was, with at least a sweater and a green corduroy coat. Not counting the scarf and thick woolen gloves.
"Not yet, Lord, but we will and we will shine with the solo that I will do." Haven put her hands spread across her chest. "Teddy wrote a passionate love song for me, details about his muse it's in secret, of course."
The punishment for François and Clearwater is four weeks of punishment without magic. They have no right to go home for Christmas and their families are informed about their mischief with two students. Draco hears that Gilbert Clearwater's father sends a letter to the principal asking her to forgive his son and let him go for the holidays. Fortunately, McGonagall says no and the punishment of the two boys is in charge of Professor Flitwick who also drops a hundred points for Ravenclaw and Slytherin. Which according to Draco's accounts, puts Hufflepuff and Gryffindor in the lead by just three points of difference between the two houses.
The man turns around for good, and doesn't give Draco time for an answer. To Draco's torture, he doesn't feel any better after that, he just feels like an idiot trying to step forward, but only takes ten steps back trying.
Harry scratches his neck, rolling all the hair of hair he has, and that he is already a disaster. "I did not pay attention to the beginning, I missed some steps."
"Yes!" he answers quickly. Clears throat. Disguise, as if this were not the consolation of your misery. "Uh, yeah. I mean, it sounds, like, super good and like that, it would be gre-
Harry gives him permission with a shake of his head and he takes the necessary liberty to give the room some life.
Draco stands up taking the mug from Harry's hands to carry them to the sink and flick his wand to begin washing them.
"Remus would have liked to see this... the change that is being made. Sirius would probably have a Fire Whiskey party and everything to celebrate." Harry's cheerful tone falters for a second, but the smile doesn't leave his lips.
"To have punishment at Hogwarts you have to study here, and I am expelling you right now." Jerome's face warps, changing the smug smile to a face of fear and outrage. "So go get your things or I'll send everything you got to be burned."
The four walk in the direction of Hog's Head, but enter an alley where they find a fence that has on the facade the portrait of two women looking into each other's eyes. Ernie mutters a password and the wall opens allowing them to pass. Draco can make out multi-colored lights coming out of an entrance at the other end of the small room. An elf receives them and hands them an envelope. Ernie thanks him and guides everyone inside the place.
"You see it? If the Gryffindor seeker is interested in Renée, he will let her go so she can protect Wolfgang from the bludger."
"Nothing," he says under Draco's gaze that's convincing enough to elicit the answer. "I never imagined that you and I would be together at Christmas drinking chocolate and not arguing at all."
Alice and Frank Longbottom, the happy newlywed couple who were killed by one of the worst hexes during the first wizarding war.
He opens the door just enough to see who was behind him with his hand wrapped in his wand under a firm grip and almost drops it from his hand when he sees Harry Potter.
"A toast to the company of oneself." He says still with the glass up before taking the big drink. Draco looks at him somewhat puzzled, but nods with a smile. He collides his glass with Harry and mimics the action before returning the glass to the bar.
Harry smirks with a goofy blush accentuating in that spot where the glasses shade him. He's looking at him for two seconds because the third one looks up and his smile widens making him turn too.
Music was all Neville lived for. From The Witches of Macbeth to The Goblins, everything served in Neville's musical repertoire when it came to music, and he wasn't simply a receiver like Draco, for him it didn't matter if the guitar solo was good or if the drums were good to the beat of the lead singer's voice, or if the backing vocals sounded good. For Neville, music was a dance partner. Or just a pretext, to hell.
There are times when you have to talk, and he wants to. Perhaps the function of a potion like Amortentia is to take courage. So take this moment and he takes courage.
"Uh, yes, please." Draco sits in one of the chairs across from the headmistress's desk and watches his teacup fill up.
He almost bumped into some witches and wizards doing a dance outside The Three Broomsticks a couple of times before arriving at Abbott Herbs and Mushrooms. The place is hot, contrary to the cold weather outside, which sends a rush of heat to Neville's body, which he's grateful for after having spent all the way there shaking.
The fireplace is lit and Draco can hear murmurs and laughter from outside. A horrible headache makes him squeeze his eyes shut, and then he realizes how dry his mouth feels, probably from drinking so much the night before.
"What is he going to tell them to keep you so worried? Whatever you've done won't change their perception of you. You're a good boy."
"You should know that no one with a little common sense would touch a letter with a family seal, Potter."
He takes one of the notes Principal McGonagall gave him and hands it to Jerome, who mutters some stupid thing that Draco isn't in the mood to ask him to repeat, the least he needs to do is babysit a child in detention.
Notes and more notes about the famous magic pine used in the magic yule were giving him a huge headache that was beginning to be unbearable.
He's afraid he will not be able to go this year with the tranquility he had planned. Although he has never been able to make Harry Potter move of his way.
"However," he begins, "I'm not going to let you hide something like that from me. I'll keep an eye on Gilbert, but I need you to tell me if he's going too far. No matter what, I need you to tell me, okay?"
"No, I'm afraid not, Professor Malfoy, but I don't know much about Muggle disease and I'm terrified that it's a disease without a cure."
Neville sees Hannah's botany at the other end of the street and is glad it's Thursday. Ernie doesn't work on Thursdays, he tells himself ignoring the voice in his head that blames him for being a stalker because in fact it was Ernie himself who gave him that information on one of his visits to Hogwarts.
"And you, Mr. Potter." The woman turns to look at him, pulling him out of his reverie. "It seems that you has the strange luck of being the one who brings your friends to the infirmary whenever you are here."
"Well, it was a pleasure to see you gentlemen, but our band today is yet to arrive and we have things to fix. I'll bring you a bottle of marc, the house invites."
He approaches the man carefully and shakes him to wake him up. Which in itself is easy enough because Potter practically jumps in his place like a frog watching him expectantly.
"No, I don't think so," Neville mutters under his breath with a frown. Draco was enjoying this, there was no doubt about that. That son of a bitch.
"Harry! What a joy to see you here." A tall man approaches Potter with outstretched arms and the two embrace. "I never thought I saw you, well... in a place like this."
Harry is shocked and chokes on his saliva, pathetic as he's, Draco regrets feeling so vulnerable right now because making people uncomfortable with these jokes is one of his favorite things. Maybe he only worked with people he didn't like one bit.
"How long have you been here?" Draco asks taking his scarf off his neck and taking a seat in the armchair in front of the fireplace.
A knock on the door makes his heart race in surprise. Who in their right mind knocks on a door at three thirty in the morning on a workday? He wasn't willing to find out because the person would leave as soon as he came to his senses and leave him alone. But the world hates the idea of leaving Draco Malfoy alone, and the blow returns this time safer and stronger.
Potter finally leaves his classroom and his new group of students begins to enter to take their places. Draco calms down trying to suppress the urge to get out and jump on Potter's scoundrel and crush him. However, Draco takes a deep breath and does his best for a calm smile.
"I ran into him when I was coming back from Hogsmeade, my magic goes out of control when I have a cold and this time I appeared at the lake." Draco's puzzled gaze is on his body. Lucky for Longbottom. "Right at the worst moment my snot came out! A mucus! Like looking like if a centaur kicked me wasn't enough."
He laughs also supporting the idea. He can't imagine himself eleven years old receiving the news of spending his Christmas in Harry Potter's room without putting together the third magical war.
"Oh..." Neville says. "It'll be good to see they again, I haven't seen they since uh, I don't know. Time passes fast, I think."
The woman watches him as if he were a strange creature. "We cannot expel them unless there is visible physical violence, Professor Malfoy."
So it's Monday, and it's a day after New Years, and well the old say, "New year, new loves," and maybe it's time for him to give up on Ernie and time for him to give up on everything, because he'll never find love, it doesn't matter if Draco says he's being melodramatic, because it's true. Neville wasn't born to find love, that was never a destiny for him.
The man nods moving to let him pass, Draco enters the room. It's warm and full of photos, muggle photos that don't move, and books about all kinds of plants.
"For his son, I know they had one. We would have loved to meet him, but... going back there and- we lost many friends... family and- going back is painful, but we would have loved to meet him, they would both have been amazing parents."
Neville opens the door, the noise hits them abruptly. Harry's startled by the sudden appearance, but Draco doesn't even laugh when he sees him jump in place.
Hannah shrugs. "What can I tell you, Nev? There are no secrets among Hufflepuffs." Neville smiles. "But I imagine you've come for some impatiens capensis. Not to talk about how in love you are with my best friend."
He shrinks his shoulders. "That is why it is so complicated, without them accepting that their methods are inhumane we cannot progress in any direction."
"I don't know if I'm ready to go back to headaches, guys," he said at Halloween dinner. The Slytherins had taken great care in decorating while the rest of the houses were more concerned with getting the best sweets. Except for Hufflepuff who was more eager to give the best candy. Like Evan McGregor who's searching through heads of the students for the shy Connor Tremlett.
Anyone with the ability to count with five fingers would know that drinking alcohol the day before the first day of school is the biggest mistake they can make. However, they seemed to ignore it.
The deafening sound of music filled his ears and the strong smell of whiskey ran through his head. Of course Draco wouldn't drink alcohol. At least not when he realizes he has a class to teach first thing in the morning, and that's enough trouble to add a fucking hangover.
"Mr. François, Mr. Clearwater, you'd better pack your things because I'll see to it that they are sent home at least until after Christmas break."
Draco leaves the field and enters the crowd of students to go up to the teachers' place. Neville is there when he arrives, but they don't greet each other, he doesn't even bother to pretend he didn't look away uncomfortably.
I had a lot of problems translating this chapter, if there are any errors I would appreciate if you notify me.
By Thursday of that week the waters seem to be much calmer; everyone was freaking out over the Hogsmeade outing next week and the loads of to-dos before the holidays. And of course, the long-awaited Gryffindor vs. Hufflepuff match for which Draco had been accompanying Neville to team practices despite the horrible freezing weather outside. Except for the days when he had to rehearse with the choir, of course. Haven would never forgive him if he canceled a choir rehearsal, and Draco couldn't afford to cancel either, much less now that they were entered into a contest.
Harry laughs, throwing his head down in denial. He looks at him for short moments before deciding he couldn't do that.
"Yeah, besides, the werewolf records are more important, I mean, Teddy hasn't stopped talking about it in herbology classes." Harry nods with a wistful smile. "This is important to him."
The two of them are drunk when they are outside Draco's apartment, and it is not until that moment that he realizes what this implies, all that it implies to bring Harry Potter to his home; Technically he was opening up what might be the most private place for him to Harry, and somehow, in a very alarming way, that made him feel strange, almost defensive.
"You kissed me, that night at the bar. And you know what? I didn't make a big fuss about it, yet I touch one of your cards and suddenly I'm the most self-centered and evil man in the world." Him picks up his coat and gloves from him before slamming the door out of the office. "See you in the new year, Malfoy."
Ernie nods with a smile and Neville walks with him towards the bar, leaving Draco alone with Harry Potter. The man looks around and Draco just waits for a reaction, a disgusted face or whatever now that Neville is gone. But there is nothing, not even when two boys walk into a bathroom and their intentions can be seen.
Harry keeps talking and Draco stops listening at some point when he's too focused on Potter's arms and how much he wishes he hadn't made that mark on his arm. If his parents hadn't been so careless to mess with forbidden magic, if he hadn't been a coward. And it is at times like this where he wonders, if he had gone to Dumbledore in time, if he had fled or taken refuge with Harry Potter, would something have changed? Would his life feel as miserable as it does now?
He hated remembering the war and all its mistakes, the people he lost. Goyle and even Crabbe. Harry Potter did nothing but bring to life the memories of a spoiled stupid boy who lived in a bubble of privilege until that night when his father returned with Bellatrix and told him about the dark lord.
"Your seeker has disadvantages against Gryffindor, his seeker measures the same as my hand, that makes him totally fast and the last time he was in the center, that way he has a better chance of finding the snitch. Wolfgang, you are very tall, take that to your advantage, I want you to be in the center And you... Renée I want you to move to her left."
"Shut the fuck up, Draco." Draco leans back in his chair and snaps a cup of tea that arrives right at the table next to him.
"Why are you interested? Werewolves have an extremely dangerous rating according to Ministry records."
In the next chapter the action will begin, I promise, I'm just clearing the way so it won't be so fast. I can tell there will be a kiss, that's all.
"Is everything okay? It's the third week, don't tell me you've already gotten into trouble." Joked. The boy didn't laugh, but shifted uncomfortably in his seat. Draco's smile faded from his face, something was going on. "Connor?"
Draco licks his lips and gulps down his drink to clear his throat. "I'm a potions teacher at Hogwarts. Slytherin head of house."
The Neville in his head is singing some kind of Christmas carol that Draco can't quite recognize and then reminds him of how exaggerated he had been about his fight with Potter, to which Draco has to accept, he exaggerated too much.
"You weren't with the whole Voldemort and nightmares either." Harry smiles, but soon it becomes something he shouldn't have said. The war took a lot of everything. A part of them was also flooded with memory. And although he knew that Harry had never given in to the fear of the name, it brought with it something new and inevitable.
The best thing about December mornings is being able to go out for a run without the usual bunch of teenagers trailing him all morning, so Neville gets up that Friday at what Harry would call an insane hour and goes out for a run across the field. Quidditch while listening to Harry's MP3 which to his regret only has Muggle songs from something known as The All-American Rejects and Cage the Elephant.
"Harry Potter in love with me?" he asks pointing at himself. Potter nods with a rather flushed smile and hiding under the palm of his hand. Draco does everything to hide the sound of his racing heart. "As incredible as it sounds, I'm not surprised. Who doesn't?" He jokes.
The cold doesn't let him go back to sleep for more laps than he does instead. He tucks the pillow under his head once more, but that doesn't seem to help much either. Draco is lucky at least, his first class is not until ten in the morning and in case you don't sleep overtime, he will at least get a full day's sleep.
"That sounds like diaboli spinam dorsi removerent," Potter says with one hand on his chin. Minerva nods with a serious face. "Principal McGonagall, I find it quite alarming that a student of his age is using such old magic."
"Oh, Merlin. Merlin, Merlin, Merlin." Neville moves all over the place trying to remove the dirt from his pants and almost crying when he approaches Harry to ask him if he smells like dirt.
"Ernie never wrote to me once, what's wrong with me?" Neville wails, putting a hand on his forehead. Draco walks into the room in long strides.
"That's the last straw, Mr. François!" Draco exclaims, his face is red and the blood boils under his skin. The students back away, even Jerome and Gilbert shut their mouths. "I will advocate for their expulsion."
He comes to the dining room smiling with his briefcase in his hands, and struts when he feels everyone's gaze on him as in his student years. He approaches the staff table taking a seat between Neville and Weasley as usual.
"May I ask what happened to you and the Weasley girl?" Harry nods, adjusting his glasses on the bridge of his nose with his index finger.
"I understand," he laughs with a nod. "Being unaccompanied doesn't mean being alone. I agree." Harry lifts the goblet already served to him and takes a drink. Draco stares at Potter's Adam's apple mesmerized by the movement.
"Can you sleep in a sofa?" Harry asks in amazement. Draco is about to respond defensively, but when he looks at him there is a smile on his face. And what did not get tired of smiling?
Harry nods, arranging his hair in a vague attempt to keep it decent. "There's a place, I mean... Uh there's a place in my hotel room, if you want ..."
"I was... was passing by and I thought that," Harry stumbles on his words, then shakes his head and clears his throat putting his fist in front of his lips. "I wanted to know if everything was okay- If you... you were fine, actually."
"Okay," he says with a wave of his hand. "He was an idiot, I can't deny that, he was raised that way, but ... it's not a pretext."
I want to apologize for any mistakes, this time I used words that were a little out of my knowledge. I would be so grateful if you let me know of the mistakes.
"It's Friday, you won't have to worry about a hangover tomorrow morning." Malfoy shrugged cutting a piece of steak. Harry clicked his tongue in agreement.
They practice indecent hours and honestly, he doesn't see an improvement. Nothing extraordinary outside of a team that plays very well, but needs more than that. Slytherin needed more than that if they wanted to win the house cup. Probably now that Dumbledore was dead ten feet deep, there would be no one to remove the stitches from under his shoes to give the stupid goblet to Gryffindor. Over and over again And Draco can bet his best clothes that more than one is happy about it.
"I hate going back to my room," he says. "I never thought I would say this, but it was better to share a room with yourself and others."
"Now what did you do Hav?" Evan raises his head between his peers with a smile that Draco wouldn't describe as a good omen, mainly because Haven being late for a rehearsal this excited couldn't mean anything good.
"Oh no, they are always there, they are the owners, I have seen them on my outings with Rolf and Atticus." Draco and Harry looked at Neville right away. Atticus Bulstrod was a magician from New York who had settled in Sweden. He made regular trips to Hogsmeade and was the announcer for WWN, everyone was crazy about him, with his shiny curly hair and gray eyes. "We don't stop to talk much. We are not especially close."
Neville laughs with a shrug. He's clearly drunk. Not enough to take off his clothes and dance in front of Madame Pomfrey, but enough to not be fully conscious.
Then Harry Potter with all that false look of ignorance goes to his classroom and asks him how he realized that men are for him and he just... explodes. His head has been spinning since that last time because it's definitely too much for him, and the same question is repeated in his mind relentlessly like in one of those muggle gadgets that Neville got last year for Christmas that repeated the same song in the same minute without a break, how did you know you're gay, Draco? The question sticks to the tip of his tongue and is colored in the same tone in which Potter asked him, his palms itch and his stomach churns as if he were about to spit out his intestine through his chest to his lungs, depleting him of oxygen.
The bludgers take off in the sky, and the first to hit one is Paris, who sends it straight to Levi Taylor, the girl is booed. The bludger is blocked by Milton Li and Leonor Byrne rushes to shove a quaffle into the opposing team's hoops.
It's not a good kiss, it's just a lip smacking that leaves a metallic taste on it and he deduces that some blood was drawn from his lip, but he stays that way for a few seconds before being pushed away by Harry. The man's eyes are open like two huge moons, his glasses are crooked on the bridge of his nose, and his hair is a mess. More than normal. And Draco can only wonder how he did that in such a short time.
"We have practiced tirelessly every day. Gryffindor is not even that good." Gilbert Clearwater yawns. Scoundrel.
"I don't see why that should matter to you," he replies. He has a raised eyebrow and his best face doesn't give a shit.
The whole thing actually results in incessant talk. Evan is determined to make all his friends, he might get bored by someone as reserved as Connor, but he has seen him smile when Evan doesn't see him, so he thinks that for the moment everything is fine. Still, he doesn't let his guard down and seeks to keep Gilbert busy and Tremlett close.
"I suppose everyone is here." He glances at the late-arriving Ravenclaw and notices his face turning red. "I thought that the presentations would not be necessary, but if I am honest I do not remember more than half of the students."
With uncertain steps Draco goes to the couch where Harry's sitting and sits on his legs, letting his knees rest on the couch and placing his greatest weight on Potter's knees.
"It's a shame." He manages to say Harry, setting the glass aside and turning his entire body towards him, reaching out to take his shoulder between his fingers and give a gentle squeeze on it.
"Ron!" He yells and Ron smiles in response, opening his arms for a hug that Neville doesn't hesitate to enter. "What are you doing here? I thought you were working with George."
"We haven't made any progress, the council is difficult and finding a free werewolf willing to set foot on the ministry is... it's complicated, technically they sign a death warrant. I know from Remus that his biggest fear was ending up in the silver cages of the ministry."
"Of course not. I'll teach singing without the slightest knowledge of the subject, Longbottom." He says sarcastically. "Of course I can sing."
They put their lips together starting slowly, testing the territory and realizing that they like it and feel comfortable there. The kiss doesn't intensify because there's no need to, they barely part their foreheads and Harry brings his hand to Draco's cheek starting to trace circles with his thumb.
"What was the visit for?" Ernie looks down and an uncomfortable smile spreads across his face. He drapes his right arm behind the back of his neck in what Neville thinks is a nervous tic that reminded him of the younger Ernie who was always accompanying Hannah.
However, Potter and Weasley don't make Neville get up from his chair to abandon him. Rather, they directly sit next to them. Neville sits across from him as usual and the other two men sit at either end, surrounding him.
"What is happening is that you are putting Potter ahead of me because he is your childhood friend and you have been treating me for three years, what is that against more than a decade with the great Harry Potter?"
"Why do you keep calling me that? I feel like I'm talking to one of my students." Draco leans into his arms. The music was too loud.
The sound of footsteps pausing outside the room freezes him. He must look awful with his tousled hair and clothes from the day before, and he shit, his breath must be the worst part. Why are there no mints anywhere? Draco shuffles in his place trying to fix his appearance as much as possible under the influence of a drunken night.
He continues in his duties to keep everything in order with the crops. Sometimes he stops to write down advances that he notices on the leaves of some, or if his experimental crow cane fertilizer has worked well enough.
"Good morning Quidditch lovers!" A huge cheer resounds, Teddy Lupin nods with a smile before taking the mic once more. "As we all already know, this week's match is led by Gryffindor who by the second match of the year has already shown great confidence on the field. Darrell Jones, followed by Milton Li and the adorable Penny, man, the girls are crazy about the Gryffindor seeker. Leonor Byrne, our next major league player and long-awaited hunters, uh…" Teddy's hair colors changing from ash blonde to bright red. "Victoire Weasley who's preceded by a long standing reputation with four uncles on the team, John Davies and the famous Levi Taylor."
Filch leaves Mcgonagall's office and runs with Mrs. Norris in hand. The three of them wait until Filch returns with the students who appear in the office with incredible calm for someone who has been called to the principal's office. Even when they have won a Quidditch school match.
The girl groans under her breath and twists her lips. "I've told him a million times that I'm not interested, but he never understands."
Potter guides it until his office, and attentively, Draco is already lighting the campfire, he doesn't even care if the smell remains in his office, at the moment he cares not to die of a hypothermia.
But the quiet doesn't last long when Harry Potter is around, because he arrives and everything is in a whirlwind and Draco doesn't know why he's so angry when he sees him or why he wants Harry to notice that he's specifically angry with him. He doesn't know why he's frowning more than usual or trying to be louder only to have Harry look at him and ask what's going on, and then he can say "
"Oh ... do you have plans with someone?" Harry's tone sounds like what would be defined as disappointment. Or curiosity, in either case.
"I'm accompanying Neville on his date, Draco and I are keeping each other company." Harry extends his hand to point at Draco and the man spins around with almost inhuman speed.
Ernie nods wisely. The years have passed well on him, now he had a slight blond beard and his eyes were much darker than before. He could abandon his little human dignity and sigh falling at her feet. Now, right at this moment.
Harry nods. Then Draco notices the huge trunk floating behind him. No one carries a trunk that size for a visit. Especially he must have noticed by the absence of the Auror uniform that was replaced by muggle casual wear.
He has already finished with all his students when he realizes that there's not enough for Harry and either for him. Fantastic, he didn't calculate well and now he would have to do more. How dampally convenient.
The days go by too slow for Neville's liking who is more than eager to see Ernie at the bar next Saturday than he was about to grade the freshmen essays.
It has not been the same in recent weeks. Who would be the same knowing that his mother can call him at any time to tell him that he is a disgrace? But Evan has added him to his recurring circle of friends and while he doesn't seem sure he fits in, after three years he's trying.
Draco feels the blow to the stomach, he doesn't know if the color is fading from his face or if it's red. He cannot define what he's feeling right now. Mcgonagall stands up pulling the chair back and stands in front of him.
They agree to sing "Fireworks in our hearts" by Black Cardigans, a classic with great lyrics, and at the request of the boys, "Not a bloody war crime" by Delilah Breaxtoums.
"How did you know what I am missing?" Hannah snorts like it's obvious, it probably is. Neville's brain malfunctions under the influence of a bad cold.
A chorus of long "Yes, teacher" is heard as the boys make movements and settle on the steps one behind the other.
The door opens barely an inch, Harry Potter pokes his head out, which is more of a bundle of black hair as disheveled as possible, and blushes when he realizes that Draco is awake fully aware of his actions. .
Because Neville is right, new years, new beginnings. And it's not that Draco is a big believer in the New Year's resolutions that are burned under the yule tree, much less the bullshit Neville says when he's being the drama king, but he's determined to get better and people usually change their appearance when they try to put all the shit they did behind them, so Draco does the same.
"Uh, no, I was coming to visit you, you know, and I was carrying some bottles from my sister's pharmacy, it was coincidence. But you weren't there, so I was going home right then."
Harry shakes his head and shrinks into place. "We are all a little foolish when we're kids. Ron and Hermione fought all the time."
"Pessimistic enough to be you, isn't it, Potter?" His words trailed, in a way much like his younger self with that elegant accent he used all the time. "Why do you always follow me?"
That is why reform was so important to him. The world owed it to Remus, Sirius, and Teddy. To the hundreds of children who were bitten by Fenrir and other werewolves during the war. Men and boys who were treated like scum and were called dark beasts.
The plan to approach Principal McGonagall had to be fail-safe, not very flattering because she would know right away that something was up, and nothing to be a jerk because she and anyone else hated assholes. He had to find an exact middle ground between being nice, but not very nice, and rude, but not too much. Which in itself was difficult considering that Draco Malfoy had never been good at dealing with Minerva McGonagall, not when he was eleven years old, not now twenty-four. She was a tough nut to crack.
Draco nods trying to stand up, but as soon as he comes out from under the covers he realizes that he's not wearing pants. His face soon turned red when he quickly looked up at Potter and he barely looked away as flushed as he was.
"If I had known you were coming, I would have prepared that barbecue that you like so much," says the girl, holding the order table against her chest.
"Do you think they know more about my parents?" Harry's voice is overflowing with magic, and Draco doesn't know how that's possible, but he's there, with stars in his eyes and magic between his fingers. Ron smiles at him, a smile like the one they gave themselves in their first year after the selection ceremony.
"I needed to time with myself, it's been the eighteen most screwed up hours of my life," he groans. "At least, the romantic one."
"Is this formation okay, Draco?" Neville points to the boys in front of them. At the front Captain David Everly who held his ancient fire bolt in his hands and beside him his striker, Paris Green. The rest of the team was scattered in a strange combination where the seeker, Wolfgang Goldstein was in the background.
So this was something short one about Draco's (Neville and Harry) important relationships. Of course I want Draco to have some trouble opening up to new relationships and I consider him to be the type of person who hates change.
"I think so, you'll have to help me, I'm not  good at giving orders," he says, scratching his head the way he used to do since they were kids.
Malfoy is silent as Neville checks the leaves of his crops. He firmly believed that Harry Potter was plotting a trick against his home, he was sure, what other reason would have him so happy to be the stupid referee of the match? The idiot was a Quidditch fan, but even he wouldn't be happy being a mere mediator in the game.
"To my niece? No way, she's still a girl, go play dolls or old cats, at your age you should not think about that."
Draco looks at the mess that is his office. There are a bunch of coats piled up on one of the chairs and he doesn't even stop to wonder when all of that got there, and his entire bookcase seems to be empty because all his books are in fact on the table next to his chair. the entrance. He does as much as he can by waving his wand in the air and arranges everything just before Harry shows up at the door with an embarrassed smile and the tip of his nose red.
Harry sat next to him sliding his body down the brick wall. The moon shining at its highest point allowed for proper illumination.
Time passes, John Davies continues distracted trying to talk to Renée while she ignores him and takes care not to lose sight of Wolfgang on the field. Suddenly there are ninety Gryffindor points and Hufflepuff barely gets eighty.
He's going up to the common room to celebrate with the biggest smile he can put on until McGonagall appears at the edge of the stairs annoyed with Potter behind her and calls out to him. A knot is made in his stomach, and he doesn't know if it's fear or anger because he knew this was going to happen.
In the next few days, he's in charge of changing Connor for Evan McGregor and takes him as far away from Gilbert Clearwater as possible.
Draco sighs. "Girls aren't swamp creatures, Lupin, they are, girls. The thing is, Gilbert is an idiot who doesn't know how to open his mouth to have a damn conversation with his girlfriend." Teddy laughs. "Make sure you get to know Victoire first, then we can talk about love, okay?"
Harry pats him on the back standing next to him and Neville groans. "Don't even mention it, give me your robe."
"Did you really notice it?" Draco says. Harry remains silent, his gaze fixed on him until he makes a strange movement and quickly wipes the drool from his mouth and tries to accommodate his hideous clump of hair and then finally speaks again.
"Good afternoon, Malfoy." Ernie who arrives at his side greets him with a nod. Neville keeps his head down.
"I'm retiring, I'll have to make a lot of hangover potion, apparently." Draco put his napkin on the table before leaving.
Draco clears his throat. "Well, Miss Kingsley entered us in a choir contest against all the magic schools in the region, I was not aware of this until she told me."
Neville stopped abruptly, it was as if the world and his heart had sped up at the same time to start moving like mad in space as he struggled to catch his breath.
"Hufflepuff comes onto the field! Am I seeing a new lineup on the Badgers team? Amazing! David Everly is in the back of the lineup. Renée Berry leads by protecting Wolfgang Goldstein and alongside her the unstoppable Paris Green, Hugo Stravinsky and the intrepid Princhester brothers. We'll see how this exciting game turns out. Professor Potter enters the field."
Saturday comes so fast that they hardly notice it. The afternoon caring for the third years leaves them exhausted, but Draco still feels ready for a beer. The week before December holidays was always the heaviest. With students coming in with millions of questions that anyone would call silly like, "Is it okay if I use muggle ink for my essay on jicama root?" Draco definitely needed a break. Especially now that he also had to stay to organize dinner for the students who had to stay at Hogwarts.
"Shouldn't you call me by my name too?" They both smile and it's a relief that Draco swallowed his pride for the first time with Harry Potter, because otherwise, he wouldn't have discovered how comfortable he can feel around him.
He curses all the time for everything. The game is coming up and his team doesn't seem to have a decent search engine. Kyle O'Neill keeps his head in the clouds and if it weren't for racing against time he would be looking for a better search engine. It is not explained how such an absent boy reached such a decisive position for a match. Influences? Says the little voice in his head. Or wasn't he having fun fighting Potter instead of playing?
"No, maybe I was going to check the ingredients in my office, for the rest of the week or start ordering concoctions with Hagrid, really who knows, I'm doing my best to leave the weekends off."
A couple of movements and spells with his wand and green streamers decorate the fireplace in front of them, an enormous green tree completely decorated and other things that make the place look more in keeping with the dates.
Harry laughs, as if what Draco said was the funniest shit he'd ever heard from him, and well, with friends like Weasley and Granger, he didn't doubt it. "Luckily he didn't say anything to me, so I can help."
"Really? T-thank you." The woman returns with an album, she hands Harry three and he greets them with shaking hands. "You want to see?" He asks addressing him trying to integrate him into the conversation, Draco hesitates at first, but gets closer to see what he has to show him.
"James Potter?" Dorcas asks with a laugh. "Lily's jokes only made everything worse, I was his partner in herbology, that Lily joke, I can't believe there is someone so brilliant, tangling Sirius and me hair so that we would walk side by side all day!"
"I'm kicking you out of my house, and I'll advocate to get you kicked out of school as soon as possible. So go get your things and wait for your parents. I don't want to see you here another second."
Potter smiles, nodding. "Good to Know." The two are quiet for a couple of seconds, and oddly, Draco doesn't feel as uncomfortable as he would have hoped. "Do I help you? That looks tired"
"Do you know what is missing? If McGonagall brought in Granger to be the new headmistress, we'd have the Three Musketeers again!"
and then he stops, because he's acting like a spoiled five year old and he's pathetic, but the feeling stays there and doesn't go away.
He admits that it's normal to have a crush with a teacher, he himself had it, but sometimes the students exceeded it. Like that time, at Christmas his first year as a professor where Mathilda Lambert gave him a box of chocolates with amortentia. That was a severe afternoon of talking with her parents and student tears. McGonagall prohibited her from doing it again unless she wanted to be expelled. Of course she didn't stop him in the hallways again, but she still feels their gazes as she passes by the large dining room.
They leave Hogwarts because they cannot appear there, no matter how cool Harry Potter is, and they walk in the direction of Hogsmeade from where it seems that the sun is rising barely bright and still it colors their skin golden and it's funny how it is freezing the tip of their noses, but still the sun shines on their cheeks.
Draco can see Quidditch's practices from his window. For the surprise of him, Weasley becomes popular with students who don't stop talking about him even during his class. "Look at Professor Weasley, he's great, right?" a boy sitting in the background says. "Spectacular!" Answer Hanako Fujioka with a smile, the girl always has an album on the best players of the Japanese League and the African, who are in Association. "He's so handsome, what would I give to touch his eyelashes..." A pair of girls sigh and several boys frowning with annoyance.
"Exactly, Miss McKinnon. Any ideas, Mr. Milton?" The boy shrugs, but behind him Kyle shivers like crazy instead. "What's the matter with you, Mr. O'Neill?"
