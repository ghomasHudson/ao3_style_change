But even Dudley had lost his temper after the third kitchen fire he'd had to deal with. That was when his flatmate explained what was wrong with him.
"Where would you suggest this topic be discussed then?" the Headmistress asked, and Harry was happy to see that she was taking him seriously for once. Some small part of him expected her to send him to his common room and tell him to shut up about it.
"Old houses like this one often have a hidden basement and rooms," Draco whispered from behind Harry, his words warm against Harry's skin. "We should check for those."
"I want to go to Robards first. Tell him how sorry we are. I want to see his reaction," Harry said, the words escaping his throat in a fury.
"Probably. Possible. I don't know. How long do they take to come here? I want to leave." Harry couldn't help it. His voice shook.
At first he had thought this was just another crazy fan, trying to lure him into a dinner. But then he saw the neatly curved name that closed the letter and his annoyance made way to utter confusion.
Harry gladly accepted the help. He wouldn't even mind if she'd
"DRACO!"
"You realise that the next few days won't be easy for you, right? Are you sure you can do this, Harry?" She asked, her big eyes filled with worry.
"Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Don't hesitate to call me if anything goes wrong. You ought to watch the fireworks together if he's able to stay awake till midnight. They're good for lifting the spirits."
"Yes, but everything is legal, and the dangerous stuff is locked up with a powerful
There was only one thing to do before they left.
"Thirty minutes. And we can send him to Hogwarts if he won't move his feathery bum into his cage in time." Handing a buttered piece of toast to Scorp Harry waited for Draco's input that he knew would come.
"Who else is involved in this?"
He managed to unlock the door and all but crawled into his apartment, but not even his raging fever could explain the shit he saw then.
At that both Ron and Harry groaned, remembering vividly how difficult and arduous those few months had been the last time they had been on the run which only earned them odd looks from everyone else.
Harry thought his mood couldn't get any worse. How wrong he was.
"I bet I'll find a few toys in that drawer if you don't finally join me here, Harry."
"You're an arrogant child, Potter. But this will find an end now," was the only reply Crouch had to that.
"Absolutely not. What the fuck did you do, you muppet? We're on our honeymoon! There's no saving the world on our honeymoon, only catering to your husband's needs! And you're bleeding, you idiot! Way to ruin the day!" Draco screamed. He wasn't even sure if he was angry or relieved. Maybe both.
," Ron mumbled as soon as Hermione had finished her work, and they all stood back and held their breath, waiting for Mrs Robards to wake up.
His heart beating in his throat, Harry held onto his wand as Crouch tried to disarm him. He couldn't allow this to happen, he couldn't just lie there without putting up a defence.
"Lovely."
Taking Malfoy's arm, Harry helped him to crawl out of the tent and get on his feet outside. He smelt like he hadn't showered in weeks, but there was nothing a few spells couldn't fix as soon as they were back at his house. Once he had Malfoy in an upright position, Harry turned to hide the tent with a few spells before he apparated them both into his warm living room.
"I don't think there's much we can do until we've seen the
"Of course. It's not like I'll be alone here," Draco said, the wizard not making any move to let go himself. "And even if it was a cave, I'd rather be there than dead. Thanks for watching out for me and my friends, not everyone would do that."
But both Harry and Lucius Malfoy were too occupied by their glare off to even react to Malfoy's question.
"Did Hermione come back?" Harry asked, taking a bite of his own lunch.
It took barely ten minutes before Ron and Hermione's home was crammed, with far more people than Harry had ever expected to show up arriving, all of them looking at him, anticipating what he was going to say and waiting for Harry to update them all about what had happened.
Smiling widely, Mrs Weasley sent Draco off to put the presents in the living room, and order the twins to show him the way and give him a drink.
"Don't you dare come any closer to us!" Harry growled. "We just fought a bloody monster together and now you're attacking my husband! What is wrong with you Americans?!?"
"Flee, Harry. Run."
Stretching his arms, Harry sat up and let out a huge yawn. "How long was I asleep for?"
Grinning at Draco, who sent him a reluctant smile in return, Harry pictured them all together on the Quidditch pitch with nothing to worry about and his heart missed a beat. He'd love that, he knew he would. He'd love it a lot. Hogwarts was his home and would be forever.
"Salazar, Potter! If you even try to tell me that I can't come with you because it's
"Witches and wizards of the Ministry. We have organised this meeting today to share devastating news with you all." Robards took a dramatic pause and looked around the packed, frightened, room before he pulled a parchment out of his pocket. He made a great show of unfolding it before he spoke again. "Our Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, died last night in a horrible accident."
He had opened his door for Draco Malfoy, to hide in his home until they found a place for him.
"Uhm, yes?"
When the fireworks started cracking outside, Harry already had a plan. The new year promised to be an exciting one. The Ministry had fucked up one too many times, and it was time for a few changes.
Carefully stepping inside, Harry watched as Kingsley stuck his head outside the door. He looked around, his eyes skittish, wide and panicked, before he closed it quietly and dragged Harry to his living room.
Things around him were just too beautiful for him to handle with all his emotions running havoc.
"Harry. I am already overcautious," Draco answered, his tone quiet and sombre. "There's no sense in telling me. You're here because you don't want to be alone, and I am coming home with you. You don't have to be the hero anymore, remember? At least not for me. I know how stupid you are in reality. So let's go. I'll make soup, how does that sound?"
"Why would you take the fun part from me?" Harry asked as he spread Draco's legs and lifted his bum before leaning over him to give him a kiss.
"I'm not hungry at all," Harry answered, not wanting the cheeky bloody Slytherin to have the upper hand.
"We're not sappy," Draco replied, quick as a hex. "Potter managed to get half his face split open on a raid and didn't think it necessary to heal it."
Taking time off work thankfully was an option they could afford, Harry had no idea how else they'd manage. At this point it was painfully clear why not many male couples went for that option. But imagining Draco having all the issues he was currently suffering from was much worse than having them himself. Harry would carry his weight in their pregnancy, even though someone could have warned him.
Jumping up, Draco ran back to the door and closed it behind him, leaving Harry alone again. But to Harry's surprise he was back again right away. "I took today off. Let's get you home."
"I can assure you that you won't go missing," Harry called out, glad that the wizard was talking. "They just want to question you about some things."
"I vote we drink ourselves silly tonight and take care of the rest tomorrow. I know the Aurors don't work on Saturdays unless it's absolutely necessary. And seeing that Harry is here it probably isn't," Pansy said, lifting her glass in a wry toast.
Harry managed to stay at his apartment for about five minutes before his restlessness drove him onwards. He was desperate to go to Grimmauld and tell the others everything that had happened.
The fireplace roared up and Harry nearly dropped the book at that. The Malfoy's were about to arrive.
"Well, if that isn't a plan I don't know what is," Blaise laughed as he got up to refill everyone's glasses with generous shots.
"Glad to be of service, you prick. At least you two will shut up once our food arrives. And I'm not pouting."
Draco, on the other hand, had discovered the porn stash well-meaning friends had sent to Harry, which he had hidden away. Obviously not well enough.
"I have an idea, Potter." Draco stepped between him and Ron and started some complicated wand movements as he whispered, "
"Yes," Harry growled.
"And then, and you won't believe this," Draco said agitatedly, waving his hands through the air. "They asked me if I that taken the potions before we started our treatment there! As if I wouldn't know how dangerous that'd be!"
"I sent an owl, you must have missed it." Draco answered.
"Pebble? Could you come to my home for a minute?" Harry asked into the room, and not even a second later the elf appeared in the middle of the room.
Ten minutes to nine, Harry picked up Draco's bag and they both flooed into the hospital.
Suddenly all eyes were on George while he tried to catch his breath. "There were guys behind my shop. Wanted to take the rubbish to the bins, so I eavesdropped on them. Don't think they noticed me. At first I didn't notice them either, but then I heard Robards' name and, well… that got my attention."
"Look at me, you absolute moron. How long?"
George's voice appeared from somewhere next to him at that. There was an edge to it and Harry wondered briefly if he were remembering the night he'd lost Fred. "It started about fifteen minutes ago. They all streamed in from Knockturn Alley. Ron thought about calling the Aurors in, but your boss is one of the people out there, and we reckon the rest are some kind of Hitwizards."
"You could try and obliviate him? Just pray that you don't fry his brain by doing so."
Sure Mr Weasley had said not to bring anything, but who in their right mind would turn up at a family's door, on Christmas Eve, without presents?
It didn't look as if anyone ever walked through this part of the forest. Thin paths showed where animals usually crossed through the woods, while birds were chirping above their heads as if nobody could ever disturb them and Harry and Ron were the first humans they had ever seen.
"You don't sound too well." Harry stated.
"You're an angel, Mathilde. Want me to help you look for them?"
And Dudley also didn't shy back from explaining everything over and over again if need be.
"Stunned him. Listen, I have no idea what attacked us earlier, but you guys are obviously dealing with some very strange shit over here. I'd be happy to not get involved with it in any kind."
"Do we want to know why you know that Potter has scars all over his body, darling? Or would you rather we just drop the topic and pretend we never heard that?" spoke a melodic voice from the doorway behind Harry.
"Why not? Get up, I made soup for us."
Harry looked at Ron, who gave him a quick nod. Then the red-headed Auror cast a shield big enough to protect them all. Harry pulled his wand and aimed it at the house. "Let's move, slowly," he said. "They can't see us, but that doesn't mean that they won't know we're here. There might be ancient wards we've no idea about. Stay behind Ron and I as long as possible."
Harry would maybe fall victim to the rumors, if he hadn't seen things others were too blind to see.
"I'm not here to make any trouble, my neighbour’s dogs pulled me to your tent. Is there anything I can help you with, Sir? Money? Food? Medicine?"
The utter bugger was wearing Harry's jumper.
Shaking his head at Draco's impudence, Harry stalked over to one of the windows. He glimpsed out onto the street, trying to see if anyone was watching their apartment. But thankfully it was empty except two or three Muggle cars passing by while Draco raided their bathroom.
The problem is that I'd very much prefer the company of anyone who isn't a woman at my side for the rest of my life.
"It looks like it, yes," Harry sighed. "At the moment it looks like that you're getting arrested for only speaking to anyone who ever even saw a Death Eater from a mile away. It's entirely random and they won't even tell us what's going on. I met Kingsley today and honestly? He looked worried."
Sure, there's been a critical raid here and there, or a mission too big for only one team. But Harry today counted 12 teams, all crammed into the room waiting silently for orders. He could feel the tension pressing against his skin.
Harry hadn't noticed how tired he was until now, when he felt his body crashing with exhaustion. Wave after wave of mixed emotions swirled through him. It was as if he'd been running on air. Harry had entirely forgotten about his lack of sleep after everything that had happened since this morning.
Harry wanted to marvel for a second. Drink in the view of Draco waiting for him on his bed. He had no idea when he'd get the chance to see this again. So Harry took his sweet time getting out of his clothes while Draco squirmed on his bed, begging for Harry to hurry up already.
us? We've just figured out how to not distress your fragile little brains. That's a survival tactic and has nothing to do with us being
"Let's go and find our idiots then."
Ron gave him a short nod before he looked back at Robards. The wizard was still rambling about his friendship with Kingsley, full of his self-importance and vanity.
And Mr Harry
"Hermione doesn't count. The Ravenclaw is strong in her. Potter on the other hand…" Draco threw him a dirty grin. "Picture-perfect Gryffindor."
As he stepped out of the Floo Harry did indeed find Draco already sitting on their sofa nursing another glass of whisky.
A quiet whimper from next to him made Harry snap out of his rage. Malfoy looked miserable. His face was pale as he stared back and forth between his father and Harry.
Handing Annie back to Seamus, Harry went upstairs to get dressed and get the potions from their wardrobe. Sweet, nervous, excitement thrummed through him but he couldn't help but feel worried that now was the time they were finally going to do something.
One thing Harry absolutely wasn't prepared to deal with was Draco's hormones, which were now his own hormones.
"You'll go and dress into something nicer."
"I won't. What did you do to Dean?" Castiel asked, his voice just loud enough for them to hear.
"What's the plan then?"
"Fine," Harry reluctantly agreed, "But you'll wait till I give you the okay, and you will wear the cloak."
"Sit on my lap, Potter. I want to enjoy this as long as it lasts. Don't touch me again until I say so, understood?"
Mrs Zabini stepped onto the kitchen table, under the protest of Mrs Weasley, and looked around the mass of people. She paused for a single moment before she pulled out her wand and closed her eyes.
"Sure, why not. But we're not using your bloody Snitch, it hates me. I'll never catch that one."
"Kingsley, do you want me to take you to St Mungo's? What are you talking about?"
"You just want me to read the
Hesitating for a second, Harry nodded before he dropped his wand and allowed Castiel to stitch him up.
Tell Narcissa I won't make it to Sunday tea. I wouldn't be able to look her in the eyes anyways.
"So..." Malfoy said as he attempted to pull Harry into a dance. "Was your chivalry because you were scared for that Muggle's safety? Or is the famous Harry Potter hiding a dark secret and is into hot blondes and not only gingers?"
"Let's go and check where those senior Aurors are so they can arrest this piece of shit and we can go home. Home. Not Grimmauld. We can stop by there, but we won't stay."
As soon as Harry had finished mopping the floor, Draco had already a new cup of coffee in his hands which he handed Harry as they sat down on their sofa.
"Oh, he's awake," the deep voice said, far too calm in comparison to Draco.
Harry stared up at Draco in shock, and the following silence was long. Until Harry and Draco both started laughing.
Harry took another step and his foot hit something solid. Looking down he saw the remnants of a burnt Inferius on the floor and he scrunched his nose in disgust, wondering from what part of Hell Crouch had summoned those monstrosities from.
"We're at a wedding, we can't leave without a dance."
"Yeah, going early doesn't sound too bad," Ron shook his head. "Hermione will have kittens if I don't show up early, I'm sure of that much."
"Well, you could have spared yourself this tiring ordeal by simply asking your son about his own plans. Or, I don't know, maybe by not being trapped in the middle ages?"
He thought for a second to maybe just ignore it, but then the knock came again, this time harder. Letting his shoulders slump, Draco felt like stomping his foot on the ground and screaming, but that'd be rather immature of him. So he did the only right thing and went to open that fucking door—and scream his lungs out because fucking Santa Clause stood at his door.
"Sounds like my idiot," Draco huffed.
Draco had the audacity to roll his eyes at him and Harry wasn't sure if he was joking or not. But knowing his ridiculous husband, he likely wasn't joking at all. "Fine. Give the spoiled brat his own pillow then. I'm just happy if he makes it through the first year without nearly dying."
"Actually," Ron started before he looked at Harry. "Remember my new best friend? Mrs Millen?"
"Kingsley was in Robards' office, he looked worried but didn't tell me anything. Backup takes five to ten minutes, Robards keeps a team on call for us." Harry informed his partner as they gathered the rest of their kit.
But the one answer he got was enough. The bloke seemed to be pleasant enough and didn't even want any money, because "pissing off some homophobes" was enough for him.
Next to him Harry could hear Ron mumble the Anti-Disapparition Jinx, making sure the witch couldn't flee.
Laughing, Harry leaned in to softly bite into Draco's neck, something he knew would get a reaction out of the git. It hadn't changed since they were together last time. Draco's breath came harder with every little nibble of Harry’s lips. By the time he stopped, Draco's face was flushed red and Harry couldn't stop the grin creeping onto his face.
"Father, do we really have to have this conversation now?" Malfoy asked weakly.
"There were criminals on our list," Harry explained, "but also shop owners from Knockturn Alley who only had misdemeanors in their files. Ordinary people, living ordinary lives. There was absolutely no reason to arrest them as far as I could tell."
Harry decided there was absolutely no point in staying in bed, and ordered Draco to take a bath while he took care of the laundry.
"Can we just bring this to an end?" Harry asked, pulling himself together. "Or will you hold lectures just like Voldemort did? And if you do, please explain to me how you're still around."
"I am," Harry answered, wanting to be honest with Draco. "But I had hoped to make a change to our world. Doesn't look like I'm doing so at the moment. But this time we're not children. And we're united, not divided by some stupid rivary caused by different houses. It'll be different this time, Draco. I promise you that much."
Harry felt the coldness claw on him, creeping into his body and filling him with dread like he hadn't felt in years. He could remember it familiarly. "Dementors?"
"Will you keep us updated, Harry? If they're after you too, then all of us need to be prepared to leave our homes, and I don't know about you, but I'd rather start right away. And maybe stop at the homes of a few other friends and tell them what's going to happen so they can get ready," Neville said, his voice resolute while looking at all the other worried faces in the room.
"I'd like to see Professor McGonagall, if she's here."
"Your parents and a lot of other people read the headlines and decided to move into Grimmauld before it's too late. We're now short on bedrooms, and I fear we have to make some new rooming assignments. Blaise moved in with Greg, Luna with Pansy. Dean and Seamus arrived with their daughter, your parents got our bedroom, Ron. We'll take the sofas for now. Harry you can either move in with Draco or stay with us in one of the living rooms." She broke off her speech, no doubt struggling to remember every detail. "Neville offered to take in others who might come here when there's no room left. His gran obviously made a second Hogwarts out of her home, but she forgot to include him in the wards at first, the poor guy couldn't find his own home anymore."
Mrs Robards gave him a short nod, before she breathed out a, "Yes."
She slowly started to move her head and let out small groans and whimpers, fighting hard against the rope. Turning her head left and right, Harry watched as her breathing sped up and the panic quickly gathered on her face.
"You were too slow, Potter. I got to it first," Draco smirked.
"Now that that's done, Dean, this is Draco and his idiot, Harry. Draco, this is Dean, my idiot."
Pansy came back shortly afterwards. Opening the small bottle of essence of dittany Hermione always carried around with a sharp twist, Pansy kneeled down next to him. "This will hurt, but I need you to stay still while I pour this on your face since there's not much left."
Opening the big glass door that led to the gardens, Harry watched in horror at the picture in front of him.
"No. But I should have listened to my fiance. If you'll excuse us, I promised Draco a dance. Oh and Cormac? Don't ever speak to me again." Holding his hand out to Draco, Harry sent him an apologetic smile.
"Cut off your—? I actually have a Muggle thing here that'll cut them down evenly if you want to get rid of them." Harry would have been lying if he'd said that cutting off Malfoy's hair wasn't something he'd dreamt about since they'd both been at Hogwarts.
Get into Robards' house.
Who the fuck even had time to pester him on Christmas Eve? Wasn't everyone busy with being disgustingly happy?
"Only you could say—"
Sure, when they were kids he'd have done it out of spite, just to see what the git would do without his sleek blond hair. But now, the feeling of excitement was still the same, even though Malfoy had asked him to do it.
And then, for no reason at all, he started bawling his eyes out.
Pulling his wand, Harry cast a
He had accompanied Mr Weasley sometimes to help him with teaching Draco about the Muggle world. And he wouldn't call them enemies anymore, not after all those weeks spent together. They were heading the opposite direction, actually. Sure, Mr Weasley had been with them most of the time… But the time spent together had been enough for Harry to evolve some rather complicated feelings for Draco. Not that he'd say that out loud to anyone, or do anything about said
Turning his head so quick that something in his neck almost snapped, Harry gawked at Headmistress McGonagall. "You're here too?" he uttered, the only thing he could think of to say.
The only things happening were the lights in the house switching on and off. This carried on until at 10pm when everything went dark and there was no further movement at all.
It was only once the pair of wizards entered the Atrium that Harry realised the last time this had probably happened: when the wizarding world realised that Voldemort had returned. The staring witches and wizards probably hoped that he'd be the one to stop it if history decided to repeat itself.
At that Robards lifted his wand, and the fireplaces in the room snapped back to life and people slowly started to dribble out. Their shock, horror and upset was written all over their faces.
And for them it couldn't come fast enough.
"Pansy, you said you heard stories about people disappearing?" Harry asked, looking over at the dark-haired witch. She shrugged her shoulders.
Harry ignored his best mate's very good question in favour of leaving the room to look for a bottle of booze to pour himself a drink.
"They're my friends too," Harry said, his voice soft. "Just like you are."
Harry had the feeling Draco wanted to add something else so he quickly shut him up with a kiss, before he made his way down Draco's body, licking along one of his nearly invisible scars and nibbling on Draco's skin as he worked his way downwards, all the way to his dick.
"Oh I absolutely saw, that's why I'm here." Draco managed not to punch him, but keeping his shaking hands still wasn't an easy task.
Now that Draco once again was right next to him, once again in full-body contact, and still wearing Harry's jumper, he instantly panicked again. He surely didn't hate Draco. Not if the view of him, all soft and sleeping, made his heart beat faster and the nerves spiralling through his tummy instantly return.
Before Hermione could read the article out loud, Draco had snatched the
Narrowing his eyes, Harry decided that he would do the exact opposite. "I'm going to open this tent now, you better not be some kind of pervert."
"Molly asked me to invite you to the Burrow. So on behalf of the entire family, you're hereby invited. The present is a portkey, it'll leave at five. Don't open it, and don't bring anything. Just you being there is everything we want."
"Yeah, tell them they can always come here if they need a place to stay," Harry replied.
"I'll come back once we've finished our work tomorrow, Mr Potter." Bowing again, Pebble left with a pop and Harry looked over at Hermione with a grin.
"Sorry, promised George I'd help him at the shop first thing in the morning," Ron replied, examining the crust of bread that he still held in his hand. "I know how nights with the Slytherins usually end so I'll do the wise thing and stay at home."
"You can't come with me," Harry exclaimed, shaking his head. "It's not—"
Three hours and two cauldron cakes later Harry and Draco hadn't made any noteworthy progress. There was some activity at the address: a few ins and outs by scurrying people who all looked rather shady. There was not a single sign of Robards nor his wife.
"I think I still hate Draco," Harry said, pouring himself a generous measure. Then he poured himself another inch, just to be on the safe side. "I still hate him. Deep, deep down."
"Let's go to the backroom again, I don't want to draw their attention onto us," George said, his voice wary while Ron took hold of his arm.
, and positively bored to death.
"That one looks old, older than Errol. Maybe old owls aren't that affected by all the spells we have in place?" Hermione mused, drawing the eyes of the table onto her.
"You realise your girlfriend is a menace, right?" Draco asked Ron, his voice unamused.
"I honestly never thought of it? But you always looked like you enjoyed your time there so I didn't ask."
Taking a sip of his drink, Harry pulled a grimace while he looked at Draco who watched his friends intently.
"Thankfully I know how to hide us properly, even without your cloak if necessary," Draco said, his voice carrying the smallest hint of a smirk.
Harry crashed through the door, throwing it shut behind him and shouted for Draco who hurried to his side.
Humming, Harry looked at the pile of files on the table in front of them. "I think I'll go and update him. I can tell him that we have all the files and that we've decided to check the potions witch next. That's not too suspicious, right?"
"Don't look at her for too long, Potter," Draco laughed as he joined his side again. "She'll have you under her spell within a minute if you keep staring. Shall we go? Floo, I guess?"
. We were simply sick of your whining," Draco said, while rolling his eyes. There wasn't any heat in his voice though. "Unbelievable. I'll meet you at home, Potter. I'm making sure those two get home safe."
"Shut it, Potter," Draco said, not unabashed even the slightest. "You wouldn't even recognise class if someone shoved it in your face. It's a nice room. It'll do me for now."
"Of course mother."
While Harry gave him a brief overview of the wedding and his aunt and uncle, Draco watched him attentive while sipping on his coffee. By the time Harry had finished his brief overview of his left over family, Draco had a murderous look on his face that quickly turned into a dirty grin.
"No, a rabid Squirrel," Harry huffed. "Of course a raid. Suspect didn't like us arresting him."
Mr Peck chose that moment to step out of the back room. The wizard was ashen faced, terrified and instantly rolled his wand over to them. "Please don't hurt me," he begged.
Snorting, Ron sat down at his desk. "She told me the password to her potion storage. She thought we might need it if we want to get her back home."
Luckily there was a group of trees and bushes opposite Robards' property where they could make themselves comfortable and wait.
"You're so ridiculous," Ron laughed, making a swipe for the whisky. Hermione threw him a dirty look that made him go silent instantly and place the bottle on the table with a quiet click.
Landing far enough away to not be noticed immediately, Harry and Ron sent the brooms flying back to the farmhouse before they took a cautious look around.
"The words said in here will never be overheard. People who try to listen into our conversation will suffer greatly, so we're safe here. What happened?"
"'s not related, you bloody nitwitss. 'n the books are there b'caus nobody wants them these days. What happened to me?" came the confused voice from Mr Peck.
"Go to the Ministry. Now. Get everyone we know ready. If we find Crouch anywhere then it'll be there," Harry said matter of factly, already trying to formulate a plan of how they could get to Crouch Jr. without people stopping them. "It looks like he has quite a big follower base already. So we should be prepared for everything."
Feeling the spell on his body lift, Harry scrambled onto his knees with a groan and looked up at the familiar face. "Nice to see you too Professor. It's been a while."
"Blaise would you mind?"
Malfoy hesitated for a second but then he huffed and shook Harry's hand. "Lovely to meet you. Again. So who's wedding will we attend?"
Once they arrived, Harry and Ron placed the witch in one of the nicer holding cells before they once again brought her wand to the Artifacts, Articles of Magic and Stolen Items Room. They made their way back to their office.
Shaking his head, Ron copied the names onto an empty sheet of parchment and handed it to Harry before he sent him off.
as he spoke.
"What would you say if I told you I won't be leaving for a while?" Draco asked, not looking at him.
"Sure," Harry shrugged and reached for the bottle Seamus held out. This was exactly the calming activity he had needed and it took his mind off the blond conundrum asleep upstairs.
"If it was just a stomach bug it would have gotten better by now. We'll get you to St. Mungo's today, and that's not up for discussion."
Reporters overran my place only two minutes after your letter arrived.
"I'm sorry, Draco. I promise you, this is the last time," Harry said quietly, letting his arm flop back down to the floor since Draco had made no move to help him up. "I can't do this anymore."
Harry unfolded the note slowly while someone threw some snacks at the owl. It was an exhausted creature which didn't look like it'd do anything except lie on the table for the foreseeable future.
"Young Mr Malfoy," an amused and cold voice filled the air around them. "You are barely in a position to call anyone a coward. The Dark Lord would be proud of how far I have already come! Very proud! All this took me not even a month. The Ministry is mine."
Getting up, Harry stretched before he slipped into his Auror robes and tied his boots just a bit tighter. Still closing all the buttons and clasps on his robes, he made his way over to Robards' office.
In agreement, Harry looked at all the worried faces surrounding him before he let out a slow sigh. "I think that's all we can do for tonight. Everyone who can help should be here tomorrow again, maybe a bit later than today." He played with the cuff of his shirt as he spoke, feeling the anxiety course through his blood. "By the evening we'll know what is going to happen next and which steps we should take from there."
Harry felt like she was making fun of him, but when she turned around to face them again she still looked tense and worried. Harry decided to let it slip. Hermione was right; she always was. The three of them had a world to save once again. "Of course. Let's deal with Robards first, you're right."
"The Slytherins should stay here," he stated baldly, his voice confident. "We have to go to work and pretend like we know nothing and then see what happens. Harry, you're the most famous young wizard in England, if you don't go back it'll only draw more attention to Draco not being around. And we need you in the Auror department with Ron because you're the ones in the front line and you'll hear things first there, things the rest of us aren't privy to. Luna and I will go back to St Mungo's, and we'll keep an eye out. We'll let you know if something happens there." He twisted his wand through his fingers, pausing to ensure that the rest of the table were listening. "We have to keep our eyes open now, have to figure out how to end whatever this is before it's too late. And if anything goes wrong we can join the Slytherins here."
When the door finally opened, Harry nearly jumped back and he had to try everything to suppress the urge to run away. He pulled the rough edges of his bravery tighter.
Feeling overwhelmed, Harry carefully moved away and left the room, running downstairs to get a cup of tea to calm his nerves. It was a tried and tested method. He'd think clearer once he had a mug in his hand.
Nodding at Ron, Harry left him waiting at the lift while he took the stairs, taking two at once until he was all the way down at the Department of Mysteries once more.
On their way Ron and he caught several hushed whispers, people speculating about what had happened, or perhaps might happen. The worst part was that many of them were staring blatantly at Harry and Ron.
"Of course you do, you fucking moron! Glad it only took you nearly dying and me screaming at you to realise!"
Malfoy really did look like he was close to his end. He was barely able to breathe, his face was red and puffy and his eyes had already lost all signs of life. "Not gonna happen. I'm taking the dogs home and then I'll be back to get you in about ten minutes. Usually I'd say something like ‘don't move’ but you don't look like you could."
Saying he fell out of Ron's and Hermione's Floo would have been an understatement. They both heard him crash into the wooden table which stood at a fair distance from their fireplace and both Weasley-Grangers came running into the room.
Throwing himself onto Draco's bed, Harry watched him unpack while waiting for a sign that the others had returned. When he was finally happy that they had all come back in one piece, Harry began to relax a little bit. Nothing would happen to any of his friends tonight.
"But he stopped working as one about a year ago, I didn't want to bother him," Harry admitted.
"No. This is something else," Ron replied, readying his stance to throw the first hex. "I think you were right earlier today. We'll see if there's something in the newspapers about this, or if Robards calls in a meeting Monday morning." He shook his head, seeming to come to some decision. "If none of that happens we better get our act together and everyone as far away from this as possible."
His only answer was another bad cough, so Harry stepped forward and bowed to open the tent flap. He looked inside.
With their help Harry finally got on top of his morning sickness and quickly regained some of his energy so that he could actually be of help in the house and for Draco. Draco, who was all but glowing in his newfound role as pregnant manager of the household and who had not one nasty symptom that usually came with the condition.
He had told Harry that the Healer had to ask for a second one to come and check the result because it was so rare. In fact St. Mungo’s had never seen something like that happen before, their previous fastest was four months, and Draco was glowing from pride as he told Harry exactly what had happened, and how everyone had looked at him in disbelief.
"Yeah, me too. Thank you Draco. I—I really need a nap. I slept like shit last night, and I'm so done with today."
Closing his eyes, Harry took a deep breath and smiled. "I've always hoped you'd come back."
"No. The portraits. I'd rather not have them listen into our conversation."
"Maybe. What do you think we're doing when you wander off to Mr Weasley? Sitting around in silence?"
"Potter lives, Dudley." Greg was finally starting to calm down, though his face was still red with amusement. "Our poor boy Draco has had a crush on him since forever. But Potter is something like a saint in our world. He's famous, while we are—we're the opposite actually. We can try and get ahold of him, but I can't promise you that he'll ever get a letter. They filter his mail, and nothing gets to him without being checked first. It's madness."
For a recluse, and a crazy one at that, Jasbert was a surprising good duelist. He didn't make his arrest easy, and by the time Harry had him at a point where his reactions were slow enough for Harry to land a hit, both Aurors were breathing heavily, their lungs in agony. Harry even had a cut on his cheek from when Ron's shield had given in for a second.
"Not a joke, hi Draco." Harry smiled and reached out his hand for Draco to shake. "I'm Harry Potter and will be your boyfriend for the day. If that's okay?"
Draco couldn't read on.
Harry watched half-disgusted and half-impressed at how easily the Unforgivable Curse came to them. The Aurors who were hit by the Malfoys' curse dropped their wands and left as the two of them moved on to the next ones.
"Thanks, I know. Pretty sure I didn't sleep at all last night." Sending the memo off, Harry watched it fly out of the door before he yawned hugely into his fist. "If anyone asks why I'm as tired as a tormented troll then it's because Draco is sick, and he kept me awake all night. That there was his sick note."
"No." George shook his head. "I have to be here in case they decide to pull a stunt like this in broad daylight. Also school is about to start again, I have to keep the shop stocked."
Smiling, she leaned into Ron and whispered something Harry couldn't hear.
Her eyes widened as she saw Harry, and the witch instantly stopped fighting against the ropes keeping her tied in place.
Already feeling annoyed beyond repair, Harry gestured to Ron to get their order while he turned on his heels and stalked down the corridor towards Robards' office to wait for him.
"What the hell are you?" A low voice growled into his ear. "You can't be an angel, Cas would have known. So what are you? A demon?"
"I have a bad feeling about this. It won't end well for any of us," Greg said with a shake of his head, before grabbing the whisky from the table and refilling his glass with a shaky hand.
"Absolutely not. You have no business in my files as long as they didn't send you to help me," Mathilde snapped.
The heathen wore a coat! A coat! While Draco was nothing else but a puddle of sweat, this guy walked around with a trenchcoat and didn't look like it bothered him at all.
At some point Dudley's wife decided to get into the games, enjoying the show more than she actually should have, especially seeing that there were more important things for her to be dealing with.
It felt somehow nice to still have that companionship after all these years, but at the same time Harry hated that they had to go back to old habits. They had worked hard on recovering from the war they were dropped into, and that neither of them had chosen, and now it looked like everything was about to come back and destroy everything precious they had worked for. Or maybe it only looked like it because they still remembered the first time things like these had happened.
Looking around, Draco could only see Castiel and the other guy who was probably Dean. They were watching their interaction, Dean even had the audacity to look amused. Deciding that he couldn't care less at this point, Draco put his hand over Harry's wound and mumbled the few healing charms he could do wandless.
It wasn't only Draco's room now but his own too. Then, of course, a new anxiety rolled through him. He didn't know where he stood with Draco, and that didn't help at all. At least the bed was huge, so space wouldn't be a problem, and after their stakeout tonight he'd be too tired to deal with anything anyway.
"Oh. Excuse me. I'm looking for someone and I thought maybe—" the man said, already letting his eyes wander over the crowd again.
Grinning, Harry walked to Draco's room and his face fell as he realised what had happened downstairs.
"Arthur? Can I come in? Or is now a bad moment?" Harry had no intention of getting his head blown clean off by one of Arthur's newest projects.
"As if you'd ever stop to impress me," Harry laughed, before he turned serious once again. "So you've heard what happened?"
Malfoy,
There was absolutely no reason to keep it. Draco spent all his time in Harry's house now, while Greg had offered Dudley the chance to move into his place rather than staying at the shitty little apartment. It was an offer that Dudley gladly accepted.
"You really have to stop that, mate," Ron said, as soon as he discovered Harry who was rubbing his shin and feeling very sorry for himself.
Pulling his wand, Draco pointed it at the intruder that was most definitely not Santa. "What the—"
I thought you, of all people, could do better.
"Who?"
"Just put that sodding table somewhere else," Harry replied, his tone annoyed, "but Merlin! Give me a drink before you do that."
"Because he's been trying to get your attention all year long but you didn't notice, you buffoon. I'll shut the door behind me, go and get yourself
"Harry? What happened?" Hermione asked as Harry coughed and spluttered from the ashy powder.
Cursing under his breath, Harry turned around and smashed the door shut behind him, marching back to Draco's bed where he spelled the curtains shut and blocked Madam Pomfrey out with a
"What? It's been five years, why would they—?"
"So what's for dinner tonight?" Draco asked, breaking the silence that had drifted between them.
interrupted me."
It was shortly after they had gotten the good news that Harry fell ill. At first they thought he had eaten something wrong, something he couldn't stomach. But after a week had passed, and Harry still spent most of his day semi dead on the sofa, or hanging over the loo, Draco got worried. He spent most of his time next to Harry on the sofa, trying to feed him broth and nudging him every other minute to drink a sip of water.
Harry's heart, still beating too fast, missed a beat. "Have you seen enough of the world already?"
"And how many people are there?" Ron asked, Accio'ing a whisky glass and pouring himself an inch of the amber liquid.
Harry grinned at the blatant attempts Draco was making to lighten the mood. He supposed that was why they always got along so well. Both of them always knew how to cheer the other one up. At least once they had gotten used to each other, that was. It'd be a lie if Harry had said it had been like this from the very moment they moved in together. The two of them had learnt to get on, learnt to understand one another.
Feeling his own face grow hot, Harry stomped off. Friends. That was all he and Draco were. They got along very well, found it easy to talk to one another and shared the same sense of humour. The single and the only reason that this had come up now was all the stress playing tricks on his mind. It was making him freak out, making him doubt his own mind. That's all. It would all be normal again once they took care of that bastard Crouch.
"Okay, I'll just use a
He got there just in time to punch whomever the arshole pointing his wand at Draco was right in the face, hard enough to sprain his wrist. But that didn't stop him to bend down and help Draco up.
"Here, can you see outside?"
, and sadly I have to inform you that the entire world isn't obsessed with a fit British Saviour."
"Would you fancy a date? With me? A real one, I mean." Harry felt his face burn.
After a relaxed Sunday, Harry arrived extra early at work Monday morning. He wasn't surprised to find Ron already in their office looking just as anxious as he felt.
Their baby was due soon, and the tension in their house was more or less visible.
"Of course. Let's go, I can't wait to go home already."
from the table and started skimming through the page. "Wanted for the possible murder of Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt," he read aloud in a mocking, sing-song voice. "Obviously you really want to become Head Auror. If you had asked me before going on a murder spree I'd have suggested to off Robards and not Kingsley, but Harry Potter always goes the extra mile I guess."
"I didn't want to disturb you. Or scare you off again."
Hermione would Transfigure his clothes so he'd match Robards, and Draco would fix his own robes to match Mrs Robards' clothes. They'd go into the Ministry, followed by their invisible army, and then they'd do their damnedest to try to stop Crouch.
Finding Ron waiting in front of their office, Harry took the vials of Healing Potion from him and let them slide into the small pocket on his chest. He patted them, glad to have them close at hand.
At that murmurs picked up, and Harry saw that the people gathered around them had begun to gather their heads together, whispering urgently as they watched the scene unfold.
"Mathilde?" Draco asked and Harry nodded.
"I want to stop what is happening."
"You met Demen—?"
Draco chose to walk in then. He stopped Harry's pondering by lying down in bed next to him, his feet hanging from the corner of their bed so the tied boots wouldn't touch the sheets.
Dudley's wedding to be exact.
In two days the students would arrive. In three days they'd be in the newspapers once again.
"I know what I did. I don't mind having this arrangement. It looks like stuff like that is rather common in the Wizarding World. Your name is cleared through this
"You're not that scary, you know?" Harry laughed in return. "But fine. Let's put them there. I want to get into my joggers anyway."
"The others will be here in a minute, just wanted to make sure you're presentable," Draco muttered, failing to look in Harry's direction. His house mate was too busy rummaging through a cupboard to look for glasses.
Pushing the first door open, Harry found a sleeping person on a sofa and Stupefied them before they woke up and discovered them.
He hadn't been hungry to begin with. And sitting first right next to, and then opposite Potter didn't help at all.
"I won't do anything like that again."
Dudley had laughed about Harry's plan to shock Vernon and Petunia into an early grave by not only showing up without them knowing, but also bringing a male date with him. Things would be brilliant.
When he woke up again, the room looked dark, too dark for it to still be the day time. He had been asleep far longer than just a quick nap.
But once they reached the shop they found the next bad surprise waiting for them, and Merlin was it a bad one.
"How come you live in this shitty apartment if your parents are rich? Doesn't that mean you're also swimming in money?"
"You're a wizard?" Harry asked. "Then why the fuck is he attacking us?"
?" Draco nearly knocked his mug over as he gestured agitatedly. "I really don't know why I put up with you."
Thankfully Mrs Weasley called them to the table shortly after, and Harry was happy at the prospect of getting some space between them. Until he realised that Draco had been seated opposite him, so he'd have to look at him all night long.
"Yes," he agreed, knowing that it was finally time. "Is anyone else coming with us?"
He vaguely noticed some people around them clapping, but all he saw was Harry. His dumb, wonderful, soon to be husband. And his beautiful smile that he'd now be able to see for the rest of their lives.
"He's right," Hermione said while she helped Luna click on her new bracelet. "It'll only be a matter of time until even Harry, Ron and I have to go into hiding once more. Let's just hope that it won't be camping again."
Harry
Looking up into his flushed face, Harry reached for Draco's waistband and gave it a small tug. "Lift your arse."
When he started to come back to life, Dudley realised that he was laid on something soft. And that there was another person beside Draco in the room. That only confirmed to him that Draco was, in fact, a full-blown wizard. No chance that he'd manage to lift Dudley anywhere, not even with a second person. Draco’s back would have snapped like a twig if he even attempted to move him.
For one, Harry was anxious about the other man's presence—the last thing he wanted was for him to get injured—which was entirely ludicrous, seeing as Draco was more than capable of protecting himself.
But tomorrow, tomorrow they'd beat the Headmistress in Quidditch. And tonight they'd move into their shared quarters.
"I don't really know what the others did," Harry sighed, trying to not look at Draco's tired face. It brought emotions to the fore that now wasn't the time to deal with. "When I first heard of the Order, I was too young to join. Once we were seventeen we all went on the run. We heard nothing of the Order or what anyone was doing. Those days were hard… Exhausting. We had very little to eat and very little sleep. We saw other people for the first time in months when we were brought to the Manor. There were some stakeouts, some planning. Hermione—well, you know her, Draco—she just loves a good plan. But they usually failed… We barely got away every time we did something other than hide and plot. We couldn't do much, and I felt helpless and useless most of the time." A dozen memories flitted through his head; the smell of canvas, the stench of the Snatchers, and the ache of fear that had been his constant companion. "I didn't feel like we were acting quick enough, it felt like we were failing everyone. So this time I want to be quicker, end this before it gets worse. But this time everything is happening quicker than last time. Voldemort was plotting in the dark, and he didn't act as fast as this one does. Whoever they are, I'm not sure if they're just angry, or impatient, or want to prove something." Harry sighed once more. "And that's what makes this scary. Because it could get a lot worse in a very short span of time."
Deciding to return the smile, Harry reached for his by now rather cold cup of tea and took a sip.
"Yes. Looks like it," Draco sighed.
"What?" Draco asked quietly, his face looking even paler than it had before. There was a look of betrayal in his grey eyes.
"It's my fault, I didn't tell you I'd come over, thought I'd surprise you." Mr Weasley smiled apologetically. "I'll be gone in a minute, just wanted to give you an early Christmas present."
And then she was gone.
"Let's see how bad it really is, and then you can still go and ask her," Draco said, scrunching his nose as he pointed his wand at an entire wall covered in cobwebs to blow them away.
Running back to his living room, Harry threw Floo powder into the fireplace and shouted Ron's address before he jumped into the green flames.
"Maybe Finnigan got him too."
Allowing Draco to Apparate them both away, Harry was anxious for them to both reappear at Grimmauld Place. The moment their feet touched the floor Harry instantly pulled the invisible cloak away from their heads so he could get some distance between the two of them, annoyed at himself for being that bothered.
Until he heard a giggle from the door and found Harry looking at the ceiling.
Malfoy,
"I'll send my owl to father,” said Pansy. "They're out of the country at the moment. Maybe it's best if they don't come back so soon because they absolutely did
Robards was still watching him from afar, dark shadows playing over his face.
It really did look fantastic. All the years of neglect, sadness and Dark magic were gone, vanished like an enchantment. All that negativity had been replaced by the same hopeful feelings and sometimes questionable interior design ideas Hogwarts had. This was a place Harry believed he could really consider moving into one day. This could become the real home that he'd craved since he was a small boy locked in a cupboard under the stairs.
"Thanks for checking in on them."
Harry already wanted to thank her for everything, reassuring her that there wasn't anything else when an idea shot through his mind. "Actually, and I know this is kind of a grey area, but technically I'm not asking you for any information, so—"
The rest of Draco's sentence got lost in a moan as Harry started to fuck into him.
An hour later, and after Draco had seen—and complained about—every single room, Harry found himself marching through Hogsmeade. Draco didn't even ask him nicely to go and ask McGonagall, no. Draco ordered it, with a very firm but disgusted voice.
Turning around, Harry found Draco walking back into the kitchen, Invisibility Cloak already in hand. Harry's eyes flicked over the blond Slytherin. Even though he was worried, he was glad to have the man by his side.
"Nope. I'll take you there. What a fucking prick."
And I want to see the pictures of the shoot afterwards.
"Love him, my balls," Draco flipped Pansy off and got out of his chair, muttering darkly to himself as he left the kitchen. "Fucking annoying that one is. I'll look older than the Bloody Baron by the time a week has passed if he carries on like that."
"So," Greg started, "if that's the guy from Robards' house, that means he knows what he's talking about." He shook his head, clearly furious. "Which also means that we're once again with a corrupt Minister, even though he tried to get out of there today."
The doorbell rang at 6.30 pm and Harry had been dreading the moment. Asking himself why and how he always managed to get himself into situations like this, he shuffled to the door and pulled it open much too forcefully.
"Guys, I'm going to go home and get my mother out of the country. I fear we'll see each other sooner than I'd like to," Blaise said, already getting up and Accio'ing his belongings.
"We can put them in our wardrobe. Nobody would dare to meddle with my clothes. They all know I'd kill them," Draco huffed, looking at Harry like he might dare to pinch his Versace trousers.
Why would they want
People were shouting; curses and hexes were fired, and people came from everywhere to join with them on their march to the lifts. The guards had been knocked out, but then there were more coming from every side, streaming in and trying to stop them. But there were just too many people on their side. Harry's army was a force, a battalion, determined to make a last stand between good and the forces of evil.
Harry found the Slytherins convened in the kitchen enjoying a late breakfast. All of them stared at Harry in surprise when he disturbed their cosy round of chatting.
"Probably," Pansy answered. I'll go and get the dittany, just try not to move."
"I don't have the remote. Maybe it fell. Salazar knows you can't sit still for a minute."
Curses started flying towards him, but Harry dodged them, too tired to fire back. He needed to save his energy for the bastard waiting for him in Kingsley's office.
"Fine,
"We could call a—uhm, what are they called? Those people coming to fix those things?" Draco suggested.
Draco had tried turning on the TV. Dudley had no idea how, but somehow all their channels had vanished. As he sat down in front of the blasted thing to check the wires, and the connections and press random buttons, he couldn't stop himself anymore. He had to ask the question that had been burning on his tongue ever since the first fire had been extinguished.
"Potter had some very concerning news today. News that'll affect all of us," Draco grumbled, gazing around at his fellow Slytherins.
"Very well then." Waving her wand through the air Professor McGonagall transformed the bench Harry was sitting on, and the brooms the Professors had just ridden into comfortable seats that stood in a circle before she sat on one of them and nodded towards the others to sit down also.
"And then they'd barricade the entire wizarding world," Harry hissed back, angrily cleaning his glasses for the tenth time, "and we'd have no time to act on what we learned. Bad idea, Malfoy."
"Mrs Millen, this is the last time I'll ask for your cooperation," Harry tried, wanting to end this nonsense before it began. "Please come to your door and follow us back to the Ministry. Otherwise we'll have to write you up for another misdemeanor, and I'd really appreciate it if I didn't have to do the paperwork for this.
"Bubble-Head Charm," Harry said immediately, thinking back with alarm to the cauldrons in the previous room here. "Then we can go downstairs and find the hidden treasure."
Once at his apartment, Harry cast
Harry agreed. He watched as the three men walked up to Robards' door and entered without knocking. "If this is another attack and Robards ends up dead, I'll be in trouble," he whispered, squinting at the scene in front of him.
that thankfully freed their feet even though they wisely didn't move. They'd been taught on their first day of DADA to lure your target into a false sense of security. Ron and he pretended that they were still stuck fast.
Getting up, he opened the window and allowed the owl to fly inside and warm up near his fireplace.
"Monitor him tonight and call me if his cough gets worse. The soup is a good idea, and I left him something to add to a bath later. It'll clear his airways and heal the cuts and bruises he has. Make sure he doesn't drown in your bathtub. He has a rash on his back, so you'll have to help him with the salve I left for that one after the bath."
Draco tried his best to distract him, going out of his way to arrange as many fun activities for them as possible.
"I'd like that," Draco sighed. After a moment of silence he added: "I never thought we would go through this again. I thought one war was enough to last a lifetime."
He second-guessed his decision for another second, pinching his nose as he already threw powder into the Floo.
When Harry resurfaced from the nothingness surrounding him, he threw Malfoy a foul look. He couldn't believe he was really doing this. Harry knew he had been bored lately, but he hadn't thought he was bored enough to become Malfoy's fake date at a Malfoy family dinner. The second he came home, Harry promised himself, he'd look for a job or a new hobby. Preferably Hippogriff breeder so Malfoy would stay away from him.
But, thinking about what everyone else could lose if anything went wrong knocked all the air from his lungs. Family, partners, kids, parents, close bonds much deeper than friendship. And Harry couldn't imagine how much more afraid everyone else was. It was all down to them. A ragtag bunch of witches and wizards against the entire Ministry. If anything went wrong, then their whole lives would change forever.
Rolling his eyes, Harry pointed his wand at the portrait of Sirius' mother and forced the curtains to slam shut, muffling her cursing and her screams.
"Oh Draco! I'm sorry my boy! It's me! Arthur! I think this didn't go as planned," Mr Weasley panted, holding up his hands after pulling the fake beard from his face.
And just as he had expected, a glowing dot appeared in the air in front him, telling him there was at least one human inside there, and Merlin only knew what else.
" screamed both Harry and Ron as a wall of fire rolled towards both of them. The spell took rather too well, and the flames danced and roared. Harry could only hope that their shields would hold up against the raging flames.
, Harry let a fuzzy blanket fly towards the pair of them. Catching it mid-air, he threw it over Draco who sent him a small smile in response.
"You're not going there alone Potter. We all know you're a reckless idiot, but that doesn't mean you get to risk everything again. I'm coming with you," Draco insisted, voice matter of fact, the wizard already gently placing down his fork, his face brooking no argument. "Someone has to make sure you come back alive."
"Dodging my question about doing something stupid, I see." Mathilde laughed her rich laugh and shook her grey locks which made her heavy earrings swing around. "I'm wise to your tricks. Tibbles still has his cough, he's taking veterinary potions once a day now and feeling a lot better. And I'm doing just fine, you know me. Nothing can shake me up. So where's your list? I can get to it right away."
"Blaise promised to never ask for strip poker again"—Harry grinned—"so we're safe."
"Yes. Veggies often don't last long. Fresh and processed meat doesn't either. You can freeze things to have them last longer. But it loses taste and nutrition if you do."
"I know where our bathroom is, darling." Harry cooed as he opened the book. It was the same novel he was currently reading at home so he only had to find the page he had left of—
They also bought about five stores empty and had gotten everything they could think of, even though it was hell to get neutral clothes for tiny humans. Everything was either pink or blue which was a real pain in the arse.
"Yeah go home to your snake, we'll cover from here," Ron said with a dirty grin that made Harry roll his eyes at him once more before he left.
"Got the Polyjuice!" Ron called from the other side of the room. "I'll also take some that only carry the healing label and hopefully Draco can tell us a few more details about what they are."
Passing by his bathroom, Harry already started to fill the tub with hot water. Ten minutes later he was back to help Malfoy get in there without slipping.
"No. Yes. I don't know. Harry, something is wrong, something is happening and I don't know what it is. Do you know what is happening?"
The mess was perfect. Absolutely perfect. Harry took a moment to marvel at Draco's sticky t-shirt before all his energy left his body and Harry went slack against him.
"Ahh, Harry Potter, the
Harry had said he'd be right back, leaving him alone in a crowded place in fucking Florida of all places, and then he was gone.
Fuck it. "I'm looking for someone too," Draco said, watching the guy closely. "We could help each other. Four eyes see more than two."
Have fun with them,
He wasn't keen to find out what waited for him on the inside. He hadn't met his flatmate yet, but if he was anything like the building itself, Draco would contemplate the cardboard box on the streets again.
Humming, Harry glanced at Ron's notes and came to a halt in front of Mr Peck's scuffy, shabby little book shop. "I bet not even Hermione would want books from here," Harry said with a shiver. "They look like the Horcrux book she got from Dumbledore's office. Remember how disgusted she was?"
Snapping out of the feeling of being lost, Harry shook his head. Draco's hand on his arm was all it took to vanish the feeling of overwhelming sadness from his mind. "
Pushing the door open, it scraped over the uneven tiled floor, and inside dozens of candles lit up one after the other, showing row after row of shelves filled with dusty bottles and glowing vials.
"Why are you crying?" Draco's soft voice broke the silence of their bedroom.
"Yes, Mrs Granger. Pebble is feeling more than fine. What can Pebble help you with?"
"What?" Ron laughed, his face alive with amusement. "I think the eve of a battle is just the right time to have this conversation, don't you think?"
"Don't ask me if you can bring it back. It's open for everyone, and we'll help as best we can. But Mr Potter, you must realise that soon a lot of young people will be back on this grounds, and we cannot, and will not, leave them unprotected at any time. I'll need all my professors here to keep my children safe. You of all people know that our students come first. "
" Harry whispered, and seconds later a figure of a big bearded man appeared in the shadows of the trees. He didn't wait until Jasbert realised what was happening and instantly pointed his wand at him, screaming
"That's for sure. Merlin knows what happened to him." Harry chewed on the end of his quill as he spoke. "Let's get the paperwork done so we can finally go home," Harry said, already scribbling a memo to let Robards know they'd returned.
"I wouldn't expect anything less from you," Harry said.
" knowing that his stag might be able to light up the room well enough to see who they were casting their spells at, and more critically, how they could hit them and hopefully distract them enough to keep Robards safe.
"I had a strange day too. We had an order come in to arrest a few people who were involved with Death Eaters and bring them in for questioning."
"Sorry for dragging you out of your homes," Harry said quietly to the Slytherins.
Not as scary anymore, of course: now Harry had a plan, and knew what to do, even if the worst came to the worst. He was chomping at the bit, wanting to leave. Harry was happy with their plan, even though it would be nearly all improvised.
By the time Malfoy climbed out of the bathtub it was abundantly clear that he wouldn't stay awake till the fireworks. He was already half asleep by the time Harry finished spreading the salve over Malfoy's back.
"Okay, let's hurry. Stay together!" Harry said, starting to lead everyone out of the room, guarded by Ron's shield.
Harry had a blast.
Sighing, Harry closed his eyes. He really didn't feel too well and Draco was probably right that it needed to be checked, but Harry just didn't want to stress him even more. Draco was pregnant after all, and stress wasn't good for the baby. At least that is what the three parenting books he had said. If Draco would read the books then he'd know too, but he refused to. Not until he made it past the first three months.
"Good. At least you're good for something then."
He knew Draco was worried about his weight, but he had no idea how bad it had affected him until Draco walked by a mirror and Harry broke down sobbing, spilling his morning coffee all over the floor which then made him lose the rest of his sanity. This was more than slightly inconvenient. This was the worst, a nightmare.
Draco on the other hand not. He looked like a young (and very pregnant) god. His hair was shinier and thicker than ever, and his skin looked like it was glowing. He was living his best life, as far as it was possible with the baby kicking around in his belly. And Harry had to suffer everyday a bit more. Everything hurt, and he was very tired of it.
"Hogwarts pays them, I offered McGonagall to repay her for it but she waved me off."
"There must have been hundreds of them," Draco whispered from beside him.
"What was that about?" Ron hissed into his ear, casting his eyes all around the Atrium in case they were being followed.
"Nice you made it, are the others here too?" Harry asked while Draco returned to fussing with his glasses.
What the fuck?
Reaching into the pocket of the huge red robes he was wearing, Mr Weasley pulled out a neatly wrapped present and handed it to him.
"Yes. And uhm, what's the words? There wasn't any breach of security or whatever. I know enough about your kind. My family went into hiding during that war of yours. So if you'd excuse me, I'm sick. Really sick. And if you can't do some Hocus Pocus to heal me I'd appreciate some peace and we'll talk later."
"Bloody hell Potter!" Draco shook his head, looking aghast at Harry's words. "Then why are you here? I don't want to be responsible for you losing your job!"
by tomorrow morning."
Feeling his cheeks start to heat up, Harry walked past the elf and towards the pitch, wishing he had thought to bring his broom simply to spare him walking that distance.
"We've had worse. But you'll have to go back with us so we can get clothes and other things we'll need. We couldn't take anything," Pansy sighed, her voice trembling
"I'm just here for a quick update, sir. We've got all the files now and have decided to go for the potions witch next. We don't expect anything to go too wrong badly there, sir. Her report states that she didn't even act up the last time she got arrested for selling illegal potions."
will be very pleased to see you again," Ron teased. "It's been a while since you were down there. I bet she misses you."
Nodding at Harry, Ron was the first to go into the house before Harry followed them. Inside it looked just like Neville's place, but even worse. There were plants with multicoloured tentacles and fangs, others with tendrils that curled over the floor and walls all the way up to the ceiling, making the place look like an overgrown cave rather than a house.
And no. You will not see the picture.
"Yeah I'm with you there."
"That is something I don't know. I'm not near any information. My job isn't very informative I fear and neither is it helpful. But I know a few kids, I saw them grow into the most respected, the most loyal and kind adults England has to offer right now, and they all work high security jobs. I think they'll be able to figure this out for us."
This wasn't fair. It felt like the entire family was plotting against him.
Furrowing his brows, Draco looked around as well. "Follow me, and be bloody quiet."
The stag finally broke free and together with Ron's terrier went after the Dementors who were still creeping ever closer, their creeping, black-robed presence sucking away Harry's happiness.
Taking deep breaths and focusing to push away every intrusive thought, Harry concentrated on the sounds all around him. The rustling of paper, someone walking past the Archive, another set of steps, a cough from Mathilde. All those little things that filled his surroundings seeped into his consciousness.
"Let's take her and leave," Hermione hissed, as she walked up to Blaise. "The others will wake up soon." Bending down, she pointed her wand at the two guards to Obliviate them before she turned to Mrs Robards. "
It was not a wizard’s tent, that much he was sure about. It was dark, small, and stuffed with different things someone homeless would need to survive in the winter cold. On the left was a heap of fabric and, upon another cough, Harry guessed correctly that there was someone buried under it, trying to stay warm.
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy since the hearing where he spoke for him, resulting in Draco walking out of there a free man.
Harry felt his muscles relax as he finally was able to move again. Rolling onto his back, he let out a pained, broken groan. His entire body hurt, and he didn't even want to think about how he'd feel tomorrow. A tomorrow he'd now have thanks to Draco.
Draco really hoped she'd read his guilty expression as some kind of intimidation. The last thing he wanted was problems with any of the Weasleys, least of all Mrs Weasley herself.
"Yes, me too. Will there be an investigation? Or was the gas leak already confirmed?" Harry kept his voice flat, almost emotionless; he couldn't risk letting his true emotions shine through.
Everything felt the same as Friday: nobody on their list was exactly suspicious, not in any way, shape or form. They were either related to or had befriended former known Death Eaters, or had an old conviction that wasn't too bad. One of them left the Leaky Cauldron without paying. Another suspect only had a case on the books because Umbridge had confiscated their wand during Voldemort times. Harry crossed that poor wizard from the list without batting an eye. He wouldn't put them through the trauma of red-coated Aurors turning up again.
Harry closed his eyes as he waited for Pansy to return, letting everything that happened play over in his mind. Crouch was obviously entirely mad. First of all getting all those Inferi into the Ministry, and the Dementors too— "We need to check the rooms." Harry groaned. "There's no way he could hide all those things here without anyone discovering it. There needs to be some other path."
But this wasn't Malfoy. He kept his head low, refused to speak to anyone, and always sat alone. He was nothing but a ghost of his former self. And on top of it he also looked off. Not as bad as in their sixth year, but still—something was different about him.
"Wait here, give me a minute."
"Dean, 6', green eyes, brown hair, tendency to get himself into trouble." Mr Trenchcoat looked as if he had played this game one too many times already.
Relief washed over his body as he came all over Draco's shirt and hand. If he had known it'd take nothing more than his name from Draco's lips to push him over the edge he'd have asked him to use it months ago.
At one point Draco realised that Harry had put his arm around him and that they were holding hands. He had no idea who started this, but now that he thought of it, he didn't feel the need to complain.
"I still think it's not fair that you didn't spend the last months puking your guts out like I have," Harry sighed dramatically while looking angry at Draco.
"Draco!" Mrs Weasley called out as she walked towards him, wiping her hands at her pink apron. "We're so happy you made it! Dinner will be ready in no time!"
"Draco, we both saw what happened yesterday. I told you what the Ministry made us do during the day too! There is something suspicious going on, and I'm sure it's bigger than it looks right now. We have to be prepared, and that's the best way to start." Harry twisted his wand through his fingers. "Asking for information others could offer about how they handled stuff like that before."
"You know that's insane, right?"
The things one did for loved ones. Next time Harry would be the one who'll get pregnant. He wouldn't do this again. No chance. He'd rather carry the baby and look like a glowing angel.
you'll be at home again in no time," Harry said, his voice softening.
"They'll be here in about ten minutes so best you just sit on the sofa and pretend to read a book, I know you can't read but they don't, and things will be fine. At least I hope so. You have your wand with you, right?"
Pulling Harry's shirt up, he inspected the cut his stupid little adventure had brought him and gasped as he saw the wound. "That looks bad, I'm not sure if I can heal it here."
I beg you, Potter, please help me out of this, and also spare a poor witch the disappointment of having me as her husband.
Draco had to go to his next appointment at St. Mungo's without him because Harry had absolutely no shoes left that he'd fit into. This was enough reason to transform him yet again into a sobbing mess.
"I'm not worrying about him, just checking that he's following us," Harry muttered in reply.
"Yeah. He ran away from home and moved in with my father while they were at Hogwarts together. They were very close."
"Correct," Neville piped in. He was wearing a thick woollen shirt, and he rolled the sleeves back, unconsciously getting ready for action. "I wonder what made him snap and decide to get out. We know actual murder didn't stop him."
"Of course, sir."
Pansy bent down to inspect Harry's face and let out a sigh. "Never thought it'd be possible to make you even uglier. I have no idea what Draco sees in you," she smirked.
Hesitating for a second, Draco took a deep breath, before he followed Harry out of the passageway and towards the Hospital Wing.
Draco hesitated for a second before a daring look settled on his face as he stared Harry down while removing the pillow. "The thing in my pants is not the remote, Potter. But feel free to check it on your own."
"I don't know. But I won't complain about it." Harry grinned as Draco finally closed his arms around him too.
When he was out of sight, Draco closed the door and walked down to the kitchen where he plonked his head against a cupboard and let out a muffled scream.
Draco didn't know how to live around Muggles, but it looked like he would soon have to find out.
Yawning, Harry scooted closer to Draco. Smelling him was a relief for his poor senses, and he took a deep breath. A short nap and things would be better again.
They had to stop this. As soon as possible. And there was only one thing they could do about this right now.
A sudden bolt of lightning threw the Dean guy away from Draco, freeing him from his grip. Not hesitating for a second, Draco pulled out his wand and swirled around to defend himself against another attack. But Harry had obviously stunned him already and was now pointing his wand at Castiel.
Wondering if Pensieves like this one, and the one in Dumbledore's office long ago, were purposefully built to attract attention, Harry watched as George dropped his memory into it. Hermione bent low over the small bowl and viewed everything that had happened.
"You've been blinded by the Ministry, boy! Blinded by their lies! Use your brain! If you take me there I'll never be seen again!"
Their home.
"The Ministry has been taken over," Draco called. "Someone wants to finish what the Dark Lord couldn't do. And we're here to stop them. Fight with us, or leave and get out of danger. You all saw what happened lately! You all whispered, heard rumours. They are true. And we're not allowing this to happen again."
"What the fuck were they doing here?" Ron panted, every bit of colour having drained from his face. He looked as upset as Harry felt.
Draco repeated the entire enchantment on himself. "Hidden. We can use your cloak too, if you'd prefer, but it won't be necessary."
At some point their living arrangement got to a point where it was nearly unbearable for Harry to stay.
Rolling his eyes, Draco put his wand to Harry's cheek and whispered the Healing spell before stroking over the freshly healed skin with his thumb. "It's still pink, but I don't think it'll scar. Salazar knows you have enough of those decorating your body already."
"I know. But…" Harry groaned, annoyed. "Just let me help you. At least until Hogwarts is over. You'll need a babysitter for the exams, and nobody would dare to tell me off for asking for a reschedule of my exam times if they overlap with yours. And people wouldn't dare touch you if we told them—"
He had used magic in front of a Muggle.
By the time Harry had cleared a path to the Minister's office he had sweated through his shirt, and his hair was wild and messy, stuck to his forehead. His whole body vibrated with weariness, and he felt like his magic was depleting. Harry was tired of this, and he realised that this was exactly what Crouch had wanted. Make them tired, and drain them down before he himself would face them.
The rumors didn't take long to spread all over the castle. Whispered words about the father, getting more and more ridiculous with every day. Draco ignored them all, not reacting to any of it. He only walked away, head hanging low, a blank expression on his face.
"Want to feed her too? I could really use a break, and Dean is still asleep," Seamus said before he yawned widely into his palm.
A heavy silence settled over their small living room. Draco was just about to say something when Greg chimed in.
Another set of laundry, and Harry racing to the next store since they had forgotten to buy a tiny plastic bathtub for the baby.
"Worrisome? I thought the same, but an order is an order, Auror Potter." Robards looked at him with a stern, fearsome expression until Harry huffed and leaned back into his chair.
And he had been gone for nearly an hour now.
"What a shame. I think they're missing out. I look good on the cover nowadays. Though I usually make sure they only catch me doing things they can't really print in a family friendly newspaper," Harry smirked.
As it happens, Molly and Arthur are visiting Charlie for the next two weeks so I have time.
"There's four down here, no idea how many people are on the other floors. Stun, not kill, quiet and fast," Harry instructed the others, allowing the Auror training that had defined his life for so long to come through his personality and take over. He couldn't risk getting nervous here, not with so many things—and so many people—they could lose.
At this point, it was rather ridiculous to watch, and Draco could swear he saw Castiel rolling his eyes.
The voice came from somewhere in front of them but Harry couldn't see where Jasbert was. He squinted his eyes, trying to get their perpetrator in sight. "Do you think he's disguised, or just really good at hiding?"
One of Crouch's curses hit Harry square in the face and he could hear the bastard laugh as he felt blood drop down his cheek and temple. Only then did the pain start to kick in, and Harry let out a scream as the frenzied attack came even more forcefully than before, making Crouch struggle to keep up. Landing a few hits, Harry grinned dirty as he saw Crouch flinch with pain.
Going back to Hogwarts with Draco would be fun. They'd get to make some new memories amongst the corridors and the classrooms. Hopefully they'd both get out of this healthy and happy enough to consider it again once it was over.
At least their dinner dates continued. Maybe they weren't as regular as before, but they still met at least once a month. Which also meant that the stories of Draco's adventures in the Muggle world and their strange unfathomable technology, never got too boring to have as a topic once in a while.
"Excuse me, sir, may I ask who those people on the list are?" Harry asked furrowing his brows. "What's the purpose of this mission?"
"Yes. Thanks for coming home with me."
They watched as Ron's Jack Russell Terrier ran off. Then they waited for their backup to arrive through the Floo. Having nothing to do but wait, Harry started to read the book titles on the shelf next to him. "So Necromancy is a top seller it seems. So many books on that topic. And Crup breeding? How are those books even on the same shelf?"
"You know what? I reckon you're right. But you'll have to pay for it. I can't afford this and I sure won't live without a TV. In my parents house we had one in every room, and not once did one just break. My cousin destroyed one by accident though."
"We'll take care of this, Mrs Robards," Harry said before getting up. He pulled the others out of the room.
"What is wrong with you?!?" Dean growled back.
Harry immediately felt mortified. A person wouldn't need to be a powerful Legilimens to know she was livid. Mrs Robards was just staring at him, her face covered in angry red blotches.
Looking up, Robards acknowledged Harry's words with a quick nod before he nearly slipped in the red ooze on the floor. He ignored the two wizards after that, instead concentrating back on the task on hand.
Draco stood there, shaking his head.
"For fucks sake," the voice grumbled. "Potter? Is that you? My fucking luck never runs out it seems."
"Will do," Harry said, nodding at both Mr and Mrs Robards before he left the office.
"Next time." Harry really hoped there would be a next time. He was already way too close—
An earth shattering crack sounded through the hallway, and Harry looked at the floor in front of him, seeing it open up and crumble into black nothingness.
Leaning into Draco, Harry broke their kiss to let his mouth travel towards Draco's shoulder where he bit down hard enough to leave a mark. His reward was a low moan from Draco and a whispered "Fuck."
"Thanks for taking me. Your aunt and uncle seem to be real pricks."
"Yes. Let's hope that the books won't start attacking us as well."
Potter refused to see it.
"It's not about me, Potter! You ruined your own life! You allowed my father to rile you up and now you're trapped with
"Oh, Draco can heal you. Go and fetch him a Pepper Up, Draco. I'll watch over him. Making sure he's not attempting to run."
"Of course it is. We started dating after the hearing and kept it low because of the press, yes?"
"Nothing. There's nothing we can do. He's too powerful." Tears dripped from her chin. Harry could see how truly terrified she had been over recent days and weeks.
"Exactly," Arthur smiled. "Dumbledore founded the Order of the Phoenix when
"Nothing?" Draco asked with furrowed brows as he finally looked up from the newspapers.
"You won't believe me if I tell you I'm fine, right?" Harry gasped out as soon as Draco was by his side.
"Really? I've wanted to know for ages, but I can't contact him. I don't have an owl. And I don't know any wizards, at least I thought that I didn’t."
He hadn't had the chance to thoroughly enjoy the whole thing when Draco stopped him again.
Hours later, Harry had come to a stark realisation. This wouldn't be as easy, or as straightforward as he had imagined. Draco had spent the last three hours snoring next to him in bed, a small smile playing around the edges of his lips, while Harry had tried to sleep too. He had failed spectacularly because Harry was everything but tired.
"Because you love him darling. Get dressed, we'll hold him here until you're back," Pansy snorted.
"Yes. The occasional rumour, or at least that's what I thought it was. There has been a lot of chatter lately."
"Sounds perfect."
Giving up on Draco's stubborn, aggravating actions, Harry sighed and turned back to Ron. He was shocked to find the wall with the hole gone and replaced by a small path with stairs that led downwards into some kind of basement.
"What happened Harry?" Hermione asked, her face a mask of worry as she joined them. "You look like you've seen a ghost."
"We're talking about Robards," Harry answered, his voice a concerned rumble, "I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't expect us to use one of your secret spells."
Kingsley was mad, clearly. Entirely bonkers.
"Yes. I wonder what else he has for us. There isn't much distance left from here to the office."
The staircase was another tricky issue to deal with. Some evil cretin had tried to secure it by dropping what looked like a hundred Devil's Snares on the stairs. But Neville and Hermione made short work of them by shooting salvo after salvo of
"No idea." Getting up, Dudley went to fetch his notebook. He knew there had to be the phone number of a technician in there somewhere. He really hoped that the TV only had a small issue so he didn't have to replace it entirely.
Fuck.
"It's wonderful to see you again, Harry," Narcissa Malfoy said as she stepped closer to them. "I didn't know you and Draco had befriended each other. The elves will serve dinner soon, there is enough for you as well. You'll stay, won't you?"
They had asked Harry to take him in. "He has no home, no place to go. Please Harry, it won't be for long," they had said.
Nodding, Harry ate the rest of his lunch before he got into his uniform again to pay Robards a visit.
"I don't think we did, and if we did I'm sure he deserved it."
"That's exactly why we need Grimmauld." Harry smiled at her. "Very thoughtful of you, Pebble. I think that's everything that I want, please return to what you were doing before I called you here."
"I thought about Blaise, he'll be helpful with his experience in Curse-Breaking," Hermione said, running her forefinger down a neatly quilled list of names. "And Draco, he'll be responsible for keeping us all hidden until it's time to show our faces. I'll come too. And we have a backup at the hiding spot in case there are more people than we know about." Hermione skimmed through a couple of dozen sheets of paper, probably all the notes she had taken about the house. "The plan is to interrogate Robards or his wife at their home. In the best case scenario they're both there. If that doesn't work out, you'll take whichever we can get and take them to Grimmauld and I'll erase their memory once we've gotten what we want. If everything works out then we won't have to carry out the next step right afterwards. If things go wrong, we'll improvise and see what we have to do next. I'd say we leave in an hour."
Malfoy,
"That you will. I'll be right back."
It turned out that Ron's help was more than appreciated, and very necessary. Ron remembered most of Hermione's issues, and how she dealt with them, and if he couldn't they went to Hermione for help.
The last thing Harry noticed was a soft kiss next to his eye, and a whispered "Good night, Harry" before he fell asleep.
"I want this to end too. But we can't risk everything, because when we're gone, who'll take over then? I know that won't stop you, I know you, Harry. Known you since we were both eleven. Please—try not to die this time, yes?"
"I don't think they've come far. They've been at it for a day or so now. But sure."
Writing his mother a note, he left it at her door together with the new robe he had ordered for her, before he ran back downstairs and out of the Manor to Apparate to Diagon Alley.
"What about his wife?" Ron asked, his eyes burning a hole in Harry's own. Harry thought he sounded worried.
Mrs Robards breathed out a, "Yes," as her entire body started to tremble. The Truth Serum was racing through her veins, compelling her to tell the truth.
Harry looked around frantically. As far as he could tell there was no way he could get out of there. No fireplace, and the only door was blocked by Kingsley who was breathing heavily with his back turned to Harry.
They're now camping outside my house… Well done. Prick.
"Harry how drunk are you? Looks like it might get nasty in here soon," Ron said quietly, his voice switching from casual to official within a second.
"How about here? The Professors can stay, I'm sure they want to hear it too. I trust all of you with my life."
Nodding, Harry followed Draco into the Department of Mysteries and through a dozen doors and twisting, maze-like rooms until they found themselves in a dimly lit room that made Harry feel immediately uneasy.
"Do you know why we brought you here?" Hermione said, her voice determined and steely.
If he hurried he could still get a few things at Diagon Alley. He just had to be quick.
"Yes," Draco hissed, his legs wavering under Harry's touch. "But
But Lucius Malfoy obviously wasn't done yet. "How about now? I can arrange for an official to arrive in less than five minutes."
Slipping into the huge bed, Harry placed his glasses on the bedside table, and yawned. This bed was so far beyond comfortable that it was ridiculous, and due to not sleeping a wink earlier, Harry fell asleep within seconds. He was finally dry and feeling cosy and warm.
"Sorry," both Ron and Harry said before they fell silent again to watch the happenings outside.
As soon as he reached them, McLaggen put on a disgusted expression. "What do you want here, scum? Can't you see we're busy?"
"Hi Mathilde! I thought I'd give you some time to please the masses before I come here to trouble you, too. How are you? And the cats? Did Tibbles ever stop coughing?"
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Shaking his head, Harry looked down at the front page. Nothing. There was nothing about last night. Only a report about new regulations that the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures had set up which now forbid the cropping of Crup tails to hide them from Muggle eyes.
"Me too, thanks to you and your gang."
. But he'd never forget that Draco was the one who taught him how to give head. Which was, if he had to be honest, the beginning of his downfall in wizarding society. And Harry loved it.
"Hold still, dickhead. I want to fix this, not make it worse." Draco stepped closer and put his hand under Harry's chin as he inspected the cut more closely. "Raid?"
"Oh don't worry, I understand. Arthur is the same occasionally. He just goes to his shed then. Not me. I like to hear the bustling of life all around me. Please come over whenever you feel like it. And for Merlin's sake call me Molly."
"It's been two hours since then. Why didn't you just go again after I left? Doesn't look like I killed your momentum." Letting his hands rest only an inch from Draco's prick, Harry looked up in his face, drinking in the view.
Harry's view was blocked by a flood of tears as he leaned down to Draco and cover his face in kisses.
"Gave me the password."
"—deeply missed. Therefore, and as soon as this meeting is over, everyone is allowed to go home for the day. We here at the Ministry won't force anyone to stay. Everyone who wants to stay here to make sure we have enough people for emergencies is welcome to do so." He paused, making doubly sure that everybody was listening. "By tomorrow morning I'll take the place the loss of my friend has left empty, until we find a worthy replacement for him. I'll also keep the role of Head Auror, seeing that I have no intention of becoming Minister myself and hope that this temporary solution will find an end as soon as possible."
Fifteen minutes later, Draco finally appeared behind Harry. The cheeky bloody git scared him into the middle of next week as he tapped his shoulder to let Harry know he was finally ready to leave.
"So, what do you expect me to do? What does this arrangement include? I can pretend I'm drunk the second we arrive, or—"
Harry took his sweet time letting his fingers grace over every inch of skin he could reach, ignoring Draco's begs to finally fuck him. Harry had waited long enough for him to come back, and he'd take every minute he could get.
"That's probably a good idea. I fear once they'll get to Draco they'll already have you," Harry said, the worry creeping into his tone.
Harry asked himself if this is how all the others felt right now too. Every minute they stayed like this, their hands entwined, his heart grew tighter. He genuinely felt as if this could be the end. It wasn't fair that they had to fight again, wasn't fair they had to fix what others failed to see before it was too late. It made Harry feel like he was seventeen again, walking into the forest knowing that he wouldn't come back.
"Draco this room alone is as big as our current apartment," Harry chuckled. "Bloody hell. It's bigger than the house I grew up in."
"So you had success and they'll help you, am I right? Or was this McGonagall's way of showing you the door?" Draco asked, half amused.
Painfully slow, Draco lifted his arse, not once looking away from Harry, until there was finally enough space for Harry to free Draco's cock.
"Visited first Pansy then Blaise. Mrs Zabini is on her way to France and my mother, and Pansy has a bag packed with her most necessary stuff. They're ready to vanish whenever they need to. Oh and Weasley sent an owl, the letter is on the table. It was addressed to both of us so I made the decision to open it. Granger will arrive early Monday morning, she couldn't rebook her Portkey so we have to wait for your brain to arrive when she was expected to arrive anyway. What did McGonagall say to all this?"
"If they'll have me I'll come with you. I don't need an empty apartment all to myself," Draco answered.
"Fine. Help me up, will you?"
"I don't have much time. We've been sent to get even more people who were linked to Death Eaters. Told to bring them in by any means necessary."
"Honestly, I wish I could say yes. But I'm not sure about that. Greg, your father died on the side of Voldemort. Blaise and Pansy's parents might have mingled with Death Eaters, I don't know. But what can't be denied: you're definitely all close friends with Draco. Being friends with me doesn't count in this situation. It won't make a single Sickle of difference. I'm not even sure how long Draco will be safe." Looking at Draco, Harry sent him what he hoped was a reassuring smile. "I'll hopefully get notified the second someone asks for your files."
As soon as they had opened the door, curses started flying and diving in their direction. Thankfully, Ron's shield was strong enough to block them, as the others rapidly started firing hexes back at the casters who were hidden, deep in the dark.
"Let's get to work then, dearest husband of mine. Let me fuck you over the kitchen table on our wedding night."
Harry
"Well, at least we have two of them somewhere in old case files then. It's a start."
Harry was grateful he didn't get to see what they we're doing, a huge blanket blocked their view to Draco's lower parts. But the noises, and the shaking of Draco's body was enough to give Harry a good idea of what the Healers were doing down there.
"I preferred the Auror over the politician," Harry said before looking back at Robards. "I'll call for backup if needed, this guy doesn't look like fun so please keep a team ready if it's needed."
"Not interested, thanks. There are more important things than a few lousy prophecies, I've had enough of them to last me a lifetime."
So Harry dragged his tired body out of bed and Flooed into the Ministry, arriving even before Ron did.
Closing the door, Harry followed Malfoy. "May I ask what happened that you showed up here - at an address you shouldn't even know, by the way - in the middle of the night?"
Helping Malfoy onto his sofa, Harry got him a glass of water and set everything up to make soup. Next, he went back to the living room where he fire-called Luna who instantly agreed to come over.
Thinking for a second, Harry gave her a nod. "I'd appreciate that, Professor. That's probably the safest way. We'll wait here for you."
Once in the lift, Harry waited to see if someone would follow him onto it. But thankfully he was the only one needing a ride. Pulling a memo and a pen out of his pocket, Harry hurriedly jotted a message to Draco, telling him to join him at the door leading to his department, and he sent it off. He wouldn't make the same mistake again and stumble into the labyrinthine department without knowing where to go.
"I can handle a few plants myself, Potter. If you come with me I'll have to babysit you and make sure they don't eat you. Stay here, I'll come back, and if something happens, I'll scream."
"I think so too," Draco sighed. "Let's go and see what's going on. Let's just hope he didn't die again."
Knowing that tone Harry held up his hands and grinned at her. "Just an offer, I'll wait here."
"What? Why?"
Stepping in front of Malfoy, Harry pulled him out of reach from the guy dancing behind him. He had kept creeping closer and Harry wouldn't have that. Glaring at the guy until he fucked off, Harry finally looked at Malfoy, who had watched the interaction with interest.
for what felt like the fiftieth time since they had arrived.
The other Slytherins hummed in agreement.
"Sounds like a plan," Hermione said, obviously satisfied with the pair of them. "Do you know how far along the elves are at Grimmauld Harry?"
"I feel betrayed, and you look ridiculously soft and squishy in my oversized stuff," Harry giggled, which only made Draco pout. That wasn't good for the Nargles filling Harry's belly. Pouts only added to the general cuteness, which didn't help the general aesthetic at all.
A net of magical traces appeared around them, shimmering and shining in the afternoon sun. Harry realised with horror that they had long passed the line where no magic was present, which could only mean that Jasbert already knew they were coming. "Fuck."
Harry held his breath as he watched Draco's face flicker through a wide band of emotions, until it settled on something resembling distrust at best. "Why the fuck would you even do this? Me and my child are not of your concern, Potter."
Harry caught Draco a few times as he stepped out of the shower, dressed in nothing but a towel. Which wasn't that bad, the important things were covered. It only caused Draco to turn a bit more red, his already flushed face still wet from the shower being a lovely shade of pink.
This was so different to Christmas at the Manor. But he actually enjoyed it.
Pansy was the first one he reached out to. The witch didn't even wait till the rest of the gang could come over but rushed straight into Harry's apartment, promising him that she'd get hold of the others as long as she could stay there until it was time for them to meet up.
"I'll hire you as my new Defence Professor, Mr Potter. But first we need to solve this problem."
Squinting at the barn owl as if it'd have the answers he was looking for, Harry dropped the letter onto the table.
Thinking this would be the end of this nightmare, Draco was about to turn back to Castiel and thank him, only to find himself slammed against the wall and held there with a painful grip.
"Yes, but now it's me who has to go and find said lost and traumatised trainees. I don't know if that's much better," Draco sighed.
at every plant, burning them a passage so that their army could march up the staircase.
"House-elves. Grimmauld is in a bad state, very bad. As many elves as you can send to my place to clean it up. Draco hexed me into next week after he nearly broke through the third floor ceiling. I need help to fix that place and actually make it liveable again."
Already worried, Harry got into his joggers and stored the potions in their closet before throwing himself onto the bed and having a very grown-up sulk about how complicated everything was again and how stupidly difficult feelings were.
"I don't know, but I think she knows. It's not going in the report."
"Surprise me. There's nothing much you could do after all this time that'd shock me."
One owl. Harry had received one owl answering his ad in The Daily Prophet. If people had known it was him he would have gotten many more responses.
At first he had suspected his new flatmate to be an alien, seeing that he had no idea how to do anything around the flat. He didn't even know the names for anything, and Dudley had been forced to explain to him everything painstakingly slowly and in great detail without forgetting a step of the process, else it'd end very badly.
At that point Dudley had to intervene. Nobody would be frying his brain, not now, and not in the foreseeable future.
Mimicking the voice of the Healer in what Harry thought was a very over the top attempt, Draco made a grimace as he said: "
There were half the staff of Hogwarts, including Hagrid, and as Harry looked behind him, he laughed out loud at who else he saw. Narcissa Malfoy, and a tall, very elegant lady who must be Blaise's mother standing back and looking at the crowd in front of them.
"Stop brooding," Draco said as he sat down too. "Tomorrow is Sunday. We should take a day off and maybe go to the beach or something? Just get out of here and get away from everything to relax before Granger comes home on Monday. Much as I love the witch, you know what she's like! We won't have time for anything after that."
Rolling his eyes, Harry emptied his bowl at top speed before he dragged himself into his bedroom and looked for a pair of jeans and a presentable shirt. He didn't want to turn up in his full Auror robes at Kingsley's doorstep, but arriving there in his scruffy joggers also wasn't a smart move, seeing that his house was no doubt guarded and watched by the Ministry.
Harry wasn't suffering from a stomach bug, but plain morning sickness. And that was only the first symptom to come. Harry knew that because he actually
An hour later, Harry brought out the visitor wine glasses and put them onto their tea table in the living room. Everyone was sitting around waiting for the pizzas and Draco to arrive.
Being a Malfoy didn’t mean much anymore. But he'd rather die on the spot than show up to a party empty handed.
The impatient rattling of cutlery from the kitchen made Harry snort. He could picture the git rummaging through the drawer and piling a huge load of food onto his plate as if he'd never eaten before. Harry had seen it so often already but the sight never failed to amuse him.
"What the actual fuck is going on here?" Ron asked, open mouthed as people rushed past them and scarcely looked in their direction.
"Again with the observations. Well done. Take a good look at me and my misery and then leave, Potter. I don't fancy people watching me die."
"You're working on the arrests too?" Kingsley asked, taking in the sight of Harry's full uniform.
Sincerely yours,
He stepped back as Malfoy pushed himself past Harry. He watched, both confused and amused, as he stomped into his house, trying to find the living room.
! Do you even realise this?"
"Rumours. A few whispered words, people hinting at something being wrong. Nobody seems to know any actual facts. Do you want to go to my office to discuss this?"
Reaching back, Harry held onto the first person he could find, and they followed Ron through the joke shop.
Bracing himself, Harry pulled out his wand to stand beside Kingsley and face whatever was coming for them head on. But, once Kingsley noticed that Harry hadn't climbed out of a window, he turned around to look at him with pure, seething fury and pointed his wand at him. "I said flee."
"I am aware of that."
Draco looked in this oversized jumper, while his tousled wet hair stuck up in all directions from where he had hurriedly slipped out of his clothes to get into the jumper before Harry could notice his slippy, sly Slytherin trick.
"I'm fine with that. Let's go then."
Stop being a horny child.
He remembered vaguely that he'd woken up alone and to the sound of his apartment door closing a little more than a week ago.
His body obviously had other plans.
"It's not."
"So they just dragged him back in, and they might have been the same guys from Diagon Alley? And Draco thinks he might have recognised one of them?" Hermione recounted as soon as Harry finished his story. She looked entirely amazed by the tale.
"We should get our uniforms, just in case—" Harry's words broke off abruptly as an owl crashed against the window pane outside.
Lucius Malfoy's face switched through an impressive catalogue of colours before it finally stopped at a greyish-yellow as he pinned Harry with an icy glare, his lip twitching in disgust.
The second they entered the room, everyone fell silent for a moment before returning to whatever conversation they were having before. There were less people sitting around their table than yesterday, but still half of their former Dumbledore's Army. Harry knew that he couldn't expect everyone to show up all the time. Dean and Seamus had adopted a kid recently, which would make it hard for them to arrive for their meetings. Minerva was at Hogwarts. Arthur was probably at home with Molly. Ginny was out with the Harpies, they'd have a game that weekend.
"Honestly, Potter. I always wonder how you're not a Slytherin. You sure know how to make friends in the right places," Zabini snorted, a wave of affection crossing his features. "But that probably won't help us. I'll send Mother to Narcissa, I'm sure she has an extra room in France. That should get her out of the Ministry's reach for a while."
With that, Robards concluded his speech and people actually started clapping. Harry had to join them, not wanting to be seen as a rebel, even though the only thing he could think of was 'bullshit'. Every word that the Head Auror had said was a lie. Robards didn't look even the slightest bit sorry about Kingsley's death at all. But people were just too willing to believe him.
"And you say I'm reckless. Let's wait for a bit and see what happens."
"Mrs Robards, what can we do to stop this?" Hermione asked, standing in front of them.
"I'll be there. Thank you, Mr Weasley."
Things were awkward at first.
Smiling at him, Harry nodded and held out his hand again, waiting for Draco to take it. "Not alone this time."
"What the fuck did she whisper at you? Did she hex you?" Harry burst out as soon as the door behind them closed. "You need to take better care of yourself mate! Do I need to get you to St Mungo's?"
Sighing, Harry followed them, silently cursing every single branch that clawed and tugged at his jeans.
"What the—" Draco started, but Harry held up his hand before he pinched the bridge of his nose.
"I'd prefer to get my stuff myself," Draco said, looking at him with furrowed brows. Harry could sense how upset Draco was and he could empathise. The whole situation felt so out of control. "Can we somehow make that happen?"
"I think you might have said a little bit too much there," Harry said, concerned about how fast Ron had had an answer to the question.
Malfoy stepped on his foot under the table and Harry realised he should have probably kept his mouth shut. But now the damage had been done.
"Nah, I'll take a shower later and then it'll be gone."
"Dean, I think you're a bit harsh. I don't think he's dangerous," Castiel's soft voice came from somewhere behind them. "He's British."
"No. Not a word. Not even anything about Knockturn or broken things at Diagon. And seeing that your front page was equally disappointing then I'm guessing we're in trouble."
"Sure Nev, that's probably a good idea. You all know where to find us if anything happens."
"You can take my bed," Draco said, straight away, his grey eyes shiny and honest. "I'll stay with you if you want. I have to write a letter to my Mother anyway, it's been a while."
"I hardly think a child can ruin my life. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning when you get released."
of all people there for Christmas? And why with such short notice? He had three hours left to get ready, and not a single present he could bring with him.
It only took a few strokes until he felt Draco's legs tremble underneath him, his breath becoming ragged. The kiss turned more forceful, needy, as Draco's cock pulsed in Harry's hand.
"A bit." Harry smiled. "I can take a nap once we're back at home."
"Saved you from your father. He's an arsehole."
"You're being dramatic, Potter." Draco snorted. "Near death experiences build the character."
They hadn't expected it to happen that fast. Usually it took months, sometimes years, before a pregnancy was even possible. But not for them, obviously.
At least Potter wasn't with him this time. He somehow had made it his personal business to help Mr Weasley help Draco.
"I'll go and tell Mum and Dad, they have to be prepared if the Ministry comes to arrest them too. If they don't find you at home it'll be only a matter of time," George said, looking worried at the rapid turn of events.
"Jesus Christ, Malfoy. Stop fussing, your plan is good, it'll work. You're way too nervous which makes me nervous too!"
"That's bizarre. But fine by me. As long as they leave me alone I couldn't care less."
They simply stared.
Fucking hormones. It wasn't nice dealing with those, and even less that whenever shit like that happened it felt like the end. But as soon as he calmed down things didn't look as bad anymore.
Dudley knew that Harry was some kind of big thing among his people. Diggle had told him that much. But he'd never gone into any details, so Dudley had just shrugged it off, thinking that he was possibly exaggerating.
Fighting to get on his feet, Harry walked over to Draco and threw his arms around him, hugging him close. He wouldn't let go until Draco relaxed a bit.
Crossing his fingers, Harry hoped that Mrs Robards knew who was behind it. They'd be truly damned if she didn't.
There were things they both saw as acceptable risk for their job, but a Dementor attack wasn't on that list.
He sat down in the small cafe near King's Cross station and waited for his new boyfriend for the day.
Harry's stag took off, and from behind him he heard at least a dozen other people shouting the same thing. Suddenly the entire hallway was filled with the glowing lights of the Patronuses taking off towards the Dementors slowly gliding towards them.
"Mrs Robards," Harry started, slowly, making sure she understood every word. "Do you know who I am?"
He had no idea what Sirius was doing over there. The reason was probably stupid and Remus would die of shame when Harry told him.
"Take a good look around yourself, Potter, and tell me if you see anything even remotely worth keeping."
This was the life he wanted. The life he deserved. The life that a small boy locked in a cupboard beneath the stairs could never have dreamt of.
Seeing this as a yes, Harry grinned before he leaned in to suck Draco off, fumbling for his own stiff cock.
"Good."
"Remind me why we decided to take this chap first?" Harry asked, his chest rising and falling in his exhaustion. "Are you okay?"
Flinching, Draco realised he had stared too long at the strange guy because suddenly they had locked eyes and he came walking towards Draco.
Malfoy shook his head before burying his face in his hands. "I can't believe that happened. This is—you're fucking nuts, Potter. Honestly."
"You asked for a sofa." Harry shrugged, getting more amused by the minute.
"I think it'd be wise if Draco got the Slytherins together and we'll meet up at yours," Ron answered. "Hermione will never stop planning if we're at ours. At least at your place there is the tiniest chance that she'll run out of books and plans and whatever she thinks of using this time," Ron sighed, thinking of his wife. "Also considering that there is no news from Robards then we should get to work on another arrest. Which one do you think next?"
"I am. Thank you. And like I said, no reason to be scared of your Ministry. I've already had my fair share of encounters with magic, be it by accident, purpose, as a test subject or upright attacks." Dudley huffed and rolled his eyes.
Plans bad enough that he had no other choice than seeing Hermione about it, hoping that she'd have a solution for this…
"We have to make him come out of hiding. That's the only way we can get him! We can't catch what we can't see."
"Whenever."
"But Harry is this scrawny little guy with knobbly knees. I don't see the appeal."
"I raised Dean from hell. I lost track of how often he died. I don't want it to happen again."
"Well the potions, and equipment for brewing potions, some odds and ends from Borgin and Burke's but then you'd have to go there and ask what exactly went missing, and Elf-Wine for an unbeknown reason. Wait! You young chaps really don't know, right? You didn't know what happened down here! How can you not—"
"I wanted to ask if you'd already started at Grimmauld Place? I know there hasn't been much time yet—"
"So what happened in Robards' office?" Ron asked, the moment they had stepped out of the pub.
Still in shock, Draco shook his head. "I'm fine, I don't need to—"
"Ron sent an owl to tell me you were coming over! How are you boys?" Molly radiated a joy that only came with seeing her loved ones. "I haven't seen you in a while, especially you Draco. You know that you're more than welcome to come here, right?" Mrs Weasley's expression carried a wide smile as she looked at them both with caring eyes.
"We'll figure that out, Harry." Patting his hand, Hermione snatched the whisky from the table and levitated it back to its shelf with a swift swipe of her wand. "We'll figure everything out. But you're going to need to try and ignore those feelings until we sort out what to do about the Robards situation. I know this will be hard, but we have to deal with the most important things first. People's lives are at stake."
When Mrs Weasley started singing to Celestina Warbeck's Christmas songs, Draco gawked as the entire family started to join her for it with loud laughter and clinking glasses.
Kingsley shot up and pulled his wand, getting between Harry and whatever was coming at them from the front door. Fear surged and raced through every cell of his body.
"Change of plans guys. We have guests." Harry grinned as the room started filling up even more. There was barely breathing room, and yet still more entered. The nervous, excited energy ripped through the crowd.
Draco on the other hand had no issues whatsoever. He was living his best life, exactly as if nothing had changed, as if he wouldn't change.
The other Slytherins were already waiting for them at Grimmauld Place. To Harry's relief they had decided that Hermione would go with Pansy while Ron would go with Greg and Blaise. Ron had worked his Auror magic already: both men were already perfectly hidden with a Disillusionment Charm.
"But you can fix it, right?" Harry huffed. He actually didn't really care what he looked like but he did care about the pain. He was getting rather too close to passing out for his liking, and it would be nice if it'd stop hurting soon.
Crossing his arms over his chest, Draco glowered at him. "No. And I don't know how that's any of your business, Potter."
"Listen, Dean, right? I don't know what happened here and I'm probably breaking every existing law there is, but I want this to end." Pinching his wand with two fingers, Draco held it up for Dean to see. "We're wizards. There's nothing foul about what we do, there are many of us, we're mostly not dangerous but we have our madmen here and there. The two of us are on our honeymoon, and I'd greatly appreciate if I could take my stupid husband back to the ridiculously overpriced hotel to stitch him back together properly. So could we maybe end this?"
"What in the name of great Santa Clause—?"
and pushing it to the middle of the table. "I think Arthur could have some information on where to get started when events like these happen. If not him, then Molly. Both her brothers were in the Order at the time they died, she has to know how Dumbledore made the organisation."
"No time, Ron, Harry, wands at the ready," Hermione called as she came running back into the room, her voice stronger than the look of fear in her eyes might have suggested. "Harry, your Patronus goes to McGonagall, tell her to come here immediately. Ron, you inform Molly and Arthur, I'll take Neville. Let's get this going, shall we? I think we're going to need all the help we can get! Did they see you were there, Harry?"
It didn't fool Harry though. He knew Draco's little tells. He noticed the small crease on his friend's forehead and the way he held his shoulders. It reminded Harry of their sixth year at Hogwarts, and Harry was heartbroken to see that the emptiness of Draco's eyes back then had returned, and he had to shake his head to get rid of those terrible memories. Stepping next to Draco, he let his shoulder brush against his, trying to somehow let him know that he wasn't alone this time.
Ron worried his brows, but sent him a short nod. Harry knew that he could trust the wizard with his life. "Yeah. I can do that," Ron answered shortly. "Also, I think we should go to Knockturn Alley tomorrow. We could subtly ask a few questions about Friday night and hope they know what happened and who those people were."
Harry finally felt some of the tension leave his body. And when Mathilde finally returned to her desk, Harry felt a lot better. Now wasn't the time to worry. Now was the time to do what he'd been trained to do: take action.
"Then so be it. I'll get everything ready."
Draco,
"Yes, Mrs Robards. Nice to see you again, I hope you're well?" Harry asked but didn't receive an answer.
Shrugging, Harry picked up a rucksack and threw some clothes into it before he shouldered the thing and bowed down to help Malfoy up. "I'll apparate us directly into my house, can you stand for a minute or two?"
Harry's smile widened. "You only have to say yes."
Dudley laughed as he sat down too. "He's not that bad, actually. I was the prick in this case. Deserved most of it. Not the Dementors though."
"Ron, please tell me that I'm so drunk my eyes stopped working. I beg you."
"Of course. If someone sees you wandering around here they'll lock you in the Hall of Prophecies for the rest of your life," Draco chortled.
What a nightmare.
The only thing he'd been able to find was this apartment, and the man he'd rented it from looked even shadier than Greyback himself.
Harry frowned down at the letter in his hands, trying to wrap his head around it.
Leading the way out of the house, Harry lifted the Anti-Disapparition Jinx around her property, and once Ron and Mrs Millen joined him outside, they Side-Alonged her back to the Ministry.
"Can I turn off the flames underneath my cauldrons before I come back home to find the damn things exploded?" She gave the pair of them a withering glare.
And to be fair Dudley should have seen it the second that guy had stepped into their flat.
Maybe the next book that would arrive at their house tomorrow would change his mind. It looked pretty, so Harry hadn't been able to help ordering it.
"Harry knew what he did by asking Britain's best house-elves for help, I see." Hermione smiled and Pebble made a tiny squeaky noise that made Harry grin widely. His other best friend truly had the gift of the gab. "Thank you for your help, Pebble, we truly appreciate it."
"Just because you sit in the Minister's office, Crouch, doesn't make you the Minister," Harry barked. "Show your face and fight for it, you coward, if you really want it!"
"She'll be flooded with work by the others already," Harry sighed.
I've seen them before. Only once, but you never forget a sight like that."
Leaning his head against Draco's, Harry took a deep breath. This time it needed to be different. They were friends now, weren't they? They were a team. Neither man had to carry the weight on their shoulders alone anymore. Harry yawned into the back of his hand, suddenly exhausted. "Let's go to bed. We need to be well rested tomorrow. There's a lot to do."
As soon as he arrived Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak over Draco's head. Even though he hotly accused Harry of behaving like a mother hen, Draco let it stay in place as he stomped through the apartment and gathered his things. To Harry's amusement Draco's belongings included nearly all the food from their kitchen and all the snacks Harry had hoarded in a drawer in their living room.
Just as Harry was thinking about calling it a night, Draco got up from his seat. He held out his hand and smiled.
"No. I called her to ask how Ron is and sent them some soup for him. He's fine, by the way. Fell asleep right after telling Hermione what happened."
"Of course I'll stay," Harry smiled. Maybe he'd stick to talking to Narcissa for the night. Harry felt like she was the least exhausting member of the family. And they had shared a moment in the forest, so it couldn't be worse than that.
Draco looked at the set of keys in his hand and then up to the strange looking building in front of him. This was supposed to be his new home, but it somehow didn't feel much like a home to him. It felt more like he was trapped in a bad book, one where the writer had given him the perfect life, only to take it from him, bit by bit, until he had to move into a tiny flat in an old house. Worse, he had to share his space with a Muggle on top of it all.
They arrived at the wedding early, and Harry was able to introduce Draco to Dudley before the guests arrived. Which was good, because Dudley's wife wanted to make sure they wouldn't act up too badly during her wedding. But upon hearing their plans she approved and shooed them away so she could get her makeup done in peace.
"Fair."
Turning around, Draco cast a quick
Harry had no idea if this was a good plan. The Unspeakables weren't exactly fond of him, but he knew that he needed to see Draco. Time was of the essence.
Shrugging his shoulders, Harry took another slice of his pizza. "So that's our plan? Check out Robards' office, Knockturn Alley and maybe Grimmauld tomorrow and then we'll go from there?"
himself. Let's see how far you get this time, shall we?"
"Good," Harry said quietly. "We'll give you some Veritaserum now, to make sure it's really you. And, once we've verified that it is indeed you, we have a few additional questions we'd like to ask you. Now, I'd appreciate it if you take it without protest, because you're not going to get around drinking it. And if you still manage to outsmart us, I hear Mr Malfoy here is an excellent Legilimens."
Harry stood ready, hidden under his invisibility cloak, behind a huge potted plant, waiting for the signal. Ron had promised him at least ten minutes, maybe more, with the help of some tricky items that were still in the experimental stage at the joke shop.
Looking around until he found him, Harry instantly walked towards him to take the empty spot next to him. His legs carried him over unconsciously. Harry didn't care what the others might think of that, he just needed to make sure Draco and the others were okay.
"Hermione was here?" Harry asked, barely pausing between two spoons of soup.
You're an utter prick and I can't believe you pulled me into this now that I've finally gotten rid of them.
"Robards announced Kingsley's passing and gave everyone today off," Harry answered, knowing that he must look terribly grim.
Robards' tone and the angry set of his features made it clear that this was to be the end of Harry's questions. The wizard swallowed his concerns and gave his boss a short nod.
"You two know that I can hear you, right? And that this isn't helpful in making me less scared of today?" Scorps voice came from the hallway-
Nodding, Harry thanked Robards before he dragged Ron towards the Floo.
"Yes. But whoever they were, they looked like they had been there for a while now. They had their feet under the table. They'd even got themselves something from the bakery before all of this happened."
"Smart. When do you think—" Ron's sentence got interrupted by a memo swooping through the door and into the room. Snatching it out of the air, Ron unfolded it and furrowed his brows. "Meeting in five minutes in the Atrium. I guess that answers my question."
The elf nearly fainted with gratitude at that. She thanked Harry for his trust by Apparating him back home so he didn't have to walk all the way back to Hogsmeade. Harry was more pleased than he could express.
Looking around, Harry tried to find a spark of recognition on his old colleagues' faces, but they all stared right through him. Not knowing what to do next, Harry could only hope for a miracle. Draco and Mrs Malfoy obviously had other plans though. Stepping to the front they both pointed their wands at the Aurors, and their whispered words made Harry's entire body tremble in shock.
What felt like an eternity later he felt a cleaning charm wash over his body, even though he could swear Draco hadn't moved at all which made his cock stir weakly once more. But he was way too tired to care. He didn't even react when Draco shifted them on the sofa, bringing them into a lying position, limbs entangled. He could have thrown Harry on the floor for all he cared.
Maybe they could really do that. It felt like a dream but his whole existence was proof that dreams could come true. "Will you come with me to Hogwarts?"
Then they had tea for breakfast, no solid food seeing that Draco wasn't supposed to eat until they closed him back up again. It was a precaution, not really necessary but helpful in case anything goes wrong.
The day their baby was born started early, but not too different from usual. They had planned to sleep in, but their nerves woke them up at six and then there was no chance going back to sleep again.
"Yeah. It's not like I'd have anything else to do," Harry shrugged.
"This was no fun." Ron sat down with a loud groan. "All very bloody strange. I wonder why he became a recluse. He's definitely way more skilled with a wand than is usual for a forest weirdo."
"Pebble!" Harry called, ignoring Draco who was still staring, shocked and appalled in his direction. There was no time for explanations now.
"Don't even ask," Draco said between bites. "If I had known how much you destroyed in the Department of Mysteries when you broke in I wouldn't have put in to become an Unspeakable."
Once they made it into the crowd, Draco pulled Harry close and started moving them to the rhythm of the music.
Whenever he caught Draco, Harry didn't look away. He made it a point to stare until Draco had seen whatever it was he wanted to see. Draco, at first looking away as quickly as possible whenever he got caught, stopped instantly looking away after a while. He just did his thing before he returned to whatever he was doing before.
An idea coming to him in a flash, Harry pointed his wand into the room and called "
"I know two, they had a shop at Knockturn Alley. Dad led raids at their shops and homes years ago."
"I caught them playing Quidditch, you should have seen it!" Harry's voice was full of admiration "Anyway, McGonagall, Flitwick, Hooch and Sprout all are informed now and up to date with everything. They'll protect Hogwarts and have promised to assist as well as they can from Hogwarts. We're supposed to stay in contact with the Headmistress."
Robards was already waiting for them and Harry immediately sensed trouble. He could tell by the way his eyes jumped from one Auror to the next—as if he was making a mental list of some sort—and Harry knew this would be bad.
And now they were once again hidden in the bushes opposite Robards' house, freezing due to the cold rain that somehow still managed to get through their jackets and trickle down their collars despite the
!" Pansy laughed. "Oh Salazar this is brilliant. I don't think whoever this is is trying to fool you darling. He's just very, very dumb."
"Please come out and hand us your wand. We're not here to do anything, Mr Peck!" Ron called back, his voice steady as he looked questioningly at Harry.
"Don't you dare open this letter and not even wait for me!" Draco snapped at Pans as she saw her reaching for the envelope, nearly spilling her glass of deep red wine on his sofa in the process.
"What the fuck?" he muttered, looking at Draco to see if he had a better idea of what was going on before their eyes.
The entire Weasley family, each of them carrying some class of the Order of Merlin, were here. Neville and Luna were standing next to each other, wands already out and ready to leave. The Slytherins looked like they had been ready for years, just waiting to strike back. Hermione, Seamus, and Hannah—who greeted Harry with a big smile—asked him if he could maybe open the front door and lead their guests in. It seemed that Hermione, wonderful witch that she was, had been looking for some backup using the DA Coins.
"Me neither. And now they managed to get themselves into trouble together, let's hope for a low mortality rate."
Once there, Harry guided him to an empty bed and asked Madam Pomfrey to look after Draco first, ignoring the pain pulsing through his arm. It was entirely worth it. Harry would make sure the guy who attacked Draco would get suspended.
"You're ridiculous."
"He'd do anything for her," Ron added.
"You know that's not true. And even if it is, day drinking isn't a solution for that problem," Hermione said drily, rolling her eyes as she tried to take the bottle of Odgen's away from Harry, but he held onto it, his hands as firm as any Sticking Charm.
Whenever Draco felt only slightly upset, Harry got hit by a sudden wave of never ending sadness.
"The Floos are closed. There's no way in or out," Ron suddenly whispered into Harry's ear. His voice was nervous and Harry knew that his friend had never seen anything like this either.
Next week they'd go shopping for the baby, and Harry wanted to have empty laundry baskets so he could focus on the tiny clothes, and whatever else they'd buy for the newest member of their family.
Draco walked up to Harry and looked at the spot he had been touching before. "Sirius. He was your godfather, right? He was the one who left you the house."
Nodding, Harry looked down at his own wand. He had read about Malfoy being exiled in the Prophet. But he had never thought about what that'd mean for the man. Harry had expected for him to leave and play Muggle in one of the Malfoy's many houses elsewhere on the world. "Thanks Luna. Is there anything important I should know?"
As far as Harry could tell, everything up until this point had been normal. He had picked up his elderly neighbour’s dogs for their evening stroll like he always did. They took their usual route, and the dogs behaved normally.
"Firstly, those articles are always very interesting, and you'd know that if you could stop thirsting over the accompanying pictures for a minute or so to read them. And secondly, I paid, so I can choose. And I choose the one with nice looking wizards in it, not old goblins and greedy Ministry people."
"Oh thank Salazar, you're okay." Draco breathed out.
Harry couldn't stop staring at the size of the socks they had taken home today. They were beyond tiny.
"You could have let me die out there, but instead you take me home and let me taint your space with my dirt. And all this even though you know that I'm not welcome in any part of the wizarding world and that I'll never be able to repay you for your help."
will miss their chance to write a huge story about this though."
"Yes. Thanks for coming! Hermione has a few questions, would you mind helping her with them?"
Dudley wasn't too sure about the new bloke. They had lived together for about three months now, but something about him was rather off. He couldn't quite put his finger on it.
"He asked me if I trust Malfoy. There's something off here, I know it. Robards knows more than he's telling us."
He was definitely American, so he was luckier than Draco himself, who had no idea what was going on or where he even was.
"Maybe some breeders are going the extra mile to keep their top dogs around?" Ron snorted.
Harry watched, even more confused, as Hermione turned a slight shade of pink. And suddenly he realised what they were talking about.
He felt a hand reach for his and nearly jumped into the middle of next week before Ron huffed out a laugh. "Sorry, we had to set some instant powder loose or else they'd see us lurking. Everyone hold on to another and I'll take you to the windows."
Casting his eyes around the table, Harry suddenly realised that everyone had somehow grown up, matured into their role as adults. They'd all done something with their lives. Somehow the months had slipped into years. They all had happy, full existences, while the only thing he did was work. Looking to his side, Harry smiled a bit. At least he had Draco to come home to.
When they reached the gate, Harry's heart was beating wildly in his chest as he looked at Draco by his side and their old new home in front of them.
Something big crashed against the shield George and Ron had put up around the shop and they all looked towards the spot the noise had come from. There was a random wizard in a badly fitting Ministry uniform standing at the window trying to look inside. His face was twisted with fury and he radiated violent intent.
"And the soup?"
"True. So would you mind and finally come here? You can look at me some more after we're done."
"We're obviously investigating some kind of big Death Eater ring, mate," Ron replied. "It's only logical that he'd ask you about him. His family were mixed up with Dark wizardry for generations."
Royally fucked. And I know you have a saving people thing, so I'm requesting your aid once again, as if it wasn't bad enough that I'm already so deep in your debt that I'll never get to repay you in my lifetime.
"So it's a level ten catastrophe then, marvellous. We hadn't had one of those in quite some time," Pansy said, sarcasm dripping from every word.
"Dittany, always comes in handy. And a few other things I can use. I also stole a cauldron and other things that we'll need. But I'll replace those when we're done. Or repay her if she'll let me," Draco said, inspecting his nails.
"I'll visit Kingsley later," Harry grumbled. "I'll come to your place once I've talked to him."
The second Harry reached for the small wooden gate, he knew Ron was right.
Sighing, Draco let his fingers grace over his belly. "Okay. Fine. I only want for them to be safe. If that means telling the world Saint Potter is their father then so be it."
Letting out a deep sigh, Harry looked at him. "Did you plan to marry someone else? If yes then I'm sorry. I'm sure I can cancel this—"
Rolling his eyes, George flipped his younger brother off before looking at the rest of them. "Robards is getting paid, he's involved in all of this. But he's not happy, and somehow he's acting up which amused these guys a lot. There's some dimwitted prat that calls himself
"Yes."
"Okay. That's something. But never do that again without telling us first. Stuff like that needs to be planned, and not done in a rush. You've always been the most impetuous wizard I've ever met," Hermione sighed. "And what, dare I ask, was your problem with Draco?"
"Let's do that.
"It's signed! The envelope! There's a name in the flap! You won't believe this!" Pansy said, her shiny red grin growing wider with every second.
He stopped sprinting after only a few seconds. That was when he was near enough to make the man out and decided to get the fuck away from him.
The elves had restored it, restored every person that Mrs Black had burned from it. It had become an item of rare beauty. All those people that had been deemed an affront to pure-blood traditions were back on there.
"I'm bloody well not!" Ron replied hotly. "He didn't play fair, that's all!"
Taking a deep breath, Harry decided it really didn't matter. Years had passed since school, they were grown ass men now. It was about time to get over it, and what better date than a wedding could there be?
"Mr Peck? Aurors Ron Weasley and Harry Potter."
Harry watched as Crouch sank to his knees and let out an earth-shattering scream.
Harry refused to even consider the worst case.
At that Harry had to laugh. "Is that so? I already see you in the office of the Headmistress once a week because you're not happy with something, and be it the quality of the pillows they have."
"Yes, Professor McGonagall. Thank you for lending me the elves, I'll send them back in time. You can rest assured that they'll be well looked after. And of course I'll keep you updated on the situation, or rather Hermione will once she's back from Australia."
They had agreed on meeting an hour before the wedding would start to get the details down, and to grab a coffee before they'd wreck a wedding together.
I'm not available for dinner, still moving to the Alps.
Slipping behind the potted plant, Harry got rid of the cloak and shoved it into one of the pockets on his robes before sprinting towards the lifts. The picture there resembled a scene of 'The Shining' and Harry snorted recalling George's latest fascination with horror movies, the blood-soaked Kubrick classic his favourite.
"Inferi," Harry yelled as he pointed his wand in front of him. "
His stomach coiled and squirmed. Feeling like he was going to vomit, Harry left the shop and called for aid from St Mungo's. Harry's heart dropped to the pit of his belly. They had been too slow and couldn't save her.
"Absolutely," Draco agreed with a small grin before he followed them to the living room.
"The Servant. Everyone thinks he's gone. But he's back again. And he's worse. He's... insane… Truly insane. We'll soon be dead. All of us, all of you, so, so soon." At this point Mrs Robards started sobbing so hard that she had trouble breathing. But stopping now was simply not an option: the group had to know. Just a bit more; a little bit more information, and then they could leave her to rest.
It happened on a Tuesday night.
Heart beating faster, Harry grinned even wider as he looked back at Robards' house. There was still no light, no movement and nothing happening. He was probably sound asleep while they were freezing and wet and waiting for the others to finally take over.
in honour of his brother, and Cho, fresh from the last Quidditch game she had against Ginny. Even people he knew simply from nodding to them in passing in the Ministry Canteen were there. Harry shook his head in grateful wonder.
And at least Draco got to have a laugh about it once Harry calmed down. He wouldn't make the mistake of laughing while Harry had his meltdown still ongoing again.
Harry was painfully aware of Draco pressed up against his side, even more so when Draco moved to take the drink Ginny offered him—when he leaned back he somehow sat even closer to Harry than before.
"What do you think?" Ron whispered.
Harry narrowed his eyes. He had caught a glimpse of Draco, who was hurrying to hide something in the big mahogany wardrobe. Harry crawled out of the bed to sneak up on him. "What are you hiding there?"
It didn't matter. His friend's lives and futures were more important. Harry decided that he could still make up a random story if he got caught. "
Which of course Potter had also noticed, considering the amused glances he occasionally sent Draco.
Gawking, Harry tried to make out how many potions were actually hidden away in this room, but he simply couldn't tell. It seemed like an endless stash.
Pulling Draco into his arms, Harry pressed a soft kiss onto his forehead before he asked: "But?"
The door roared to life as lock after lock snapped open and heavy chains rattled on the inside of the room. Green sparkles of magic twinkled and flared across the old cracked wood.
Agreeing, Harry looked over at Hermione. "Cast a
Draco's head shot up to stare at his flatmate. He still looked like shit, but was brighter and better than before. Maybe he ought to have more Pepper Up, he was huge after all. But Draco didn't want to poison him.
In the end they had decided to just buy whatever they liked, no matter which colour. Because nobody would ever dare to give them shit for how they dressed their baby. And if they tried they'd regret it very quickly.
. That name alone tasted like money, and lots of it.
Draco had to stay the night, just to be safe, while Harry was allowed to leave after Madam Pomfrey had fixed his wrist. What he hadn't expected was the huge throng of people lingering near the Hospital Wing once he got to leave.
before it's too late."
Harry didn't know why his cheeks decided to get hot at that.
You told me at my hearing that I could contact you if I ever needed something, and you probably didn't think of this when you offered. I'm trying my luck nevertheless.
Closing his eyes, Harry took a few deep breaths and tried to empty his mind, tried to centre and prepare himself for what would come next.
The Headmistress seemed to brighten at that. "So what brought you here? What do you need?"
Walking closer to the office, Harry heard the tell-tale sound of hushed voices. Looking around he found the hallway empty, so he crept closer to hear what they were talking about, but it was to no avail. He could only make out a few words, and they were hushed and whispered. It sounded like a private discussion, not any Ministry-related matters.
Rounding a corner, Draco and Castiel both stopped dead in their tracks. They had most definitely found their idiots. And as far as Draco could tell, they were both alive even though breathing heavy.
"Fine with me. Are you going to tell Robards in person to see if there's anything suspicious, or shall we send a note and just not check in with him?"
"I didn't know other people died and came back too."
Snorting, Harry shook his head and dragged Ron towards the fireplaces to Floo out of the Ministry. Once they were at the Leaky Cauldron, Harry and Ron first sneaked to visit George at the Wheezes, wanting to give him the lowdown on the effects of his newest invention before steering towards Knockturn Alley.
Thirty minutes later, Luna joined him.
," Harry snorted, remembering how spells had missed him when he had taken it, remembering how the liquid luck made him feel nearly invincible.
"I don't know. But it sure does look like it."
By the time Harry managed to calm down he was hiccuping so badly that Draco had to open the windows, and let some fresh air in so Harry could finally catch his breath again.
There was a hushed silence, and the nerves of the assembled witches and wizards were tangible.
Harry heard clanking and rustling sounds from the far end of the shed. Seconds later the engine sounds stopped and Arthur's head emerged from between two piles of rubbish.
By the time they reached the end of the staircase, the entry of the brewing room was a small dot in the distance. The air around them was icy cold, and Harry was sure that if he removed his Bubble-Head Charm, he'd see his breath leave his mouth in tiny puffs of cloud.
I thought it'll be a picture from the shoot.
Snorting, Draco turned around, glasses in hand, just to nearly drop them on the floor. He was wide-eyed with shock. "Merlin, but what happened to your face?"
But Harry was resolute. If he didn't go to work then he'd miss whatever happened next, and whatever that was was crucial for the Order's next steps.
Harry's head started to spin as he thought back about his earlier panic about not understanding how he felt about Draco.
At least they had the decency to switch topics then. Dudley told Potter everything about his job, while Potter, on the other hand, mostly listened. Which left Draco to wonder what exactly Potter did nowadays.
That was it! Toppling over, Harry burst out into breath-taking, side-splitting laughter. He couldn't wait for Draco to finally have his very own Weasley jumper and tell everyone how it came to be.
Taking the last few steps, Harry straightened his shoulders and knocked at the door frame before waiting for the permission to step into the office.
Draco leaping from one side of the kitchen to the other to tear open the window made Harry nearly jump into next week. He stood up to look out of the window himself. Up in the sky found two dots sailing towards their apartment at top speed.
And Harry felt quite overwhelmed by the situation. Seeing this was even more frightening than the Dementors this morning. At least they were true to their nature, vile and dark as they were.
This was real, they'd be fathers soon.
Smiling up at him, Harry held out his hand, hoping that Draco might help him up. "I knew you'd come. I promised you we'd have dinner together. You never let a dinner invite slip."
Grinning, Harry stepped into the shed and followed Arthur back to where he came from. There stood a half demolished washing machine that looked older than Harry.
and waited if the charm would detect anyone in the house.
Harry had barely managed to catch his breath again when Draco turned to him for another snogging session. He surely wouldn't complain, but if Draco wanted a second round he'd have to wait a bit. There was no chance he could jump back into action that quick again.
"Honestly?" Harry asked, looking into the eyes of everyone he knew and trusted, "I have no idea."
Jumping up, Draco bent down to give Pansy a hurried kiss on the cheek before he ran to his Floo.
He was just about to round a corner when a loud knock on the front door startled him out of his thoughts.
They moved as Harry had told them, quick and silent, taking out the people they had seen from the window, with swift, powerful spells. Harry let out a relieved breath only once they had knocked out the last one without them alarming anyone else.
"To her—? Why would anyone do something like that?"
Letting Ron lead them back through the shop, the group waited until they heard the door being shut behind them before they all cast a
Humming, Harry pointed his wand at the arsehole on the floor, using the fact that he was still knocked out, and cast a full body bind at him. "Let's get you checked. Come on."
Once everyone had left, Harry started to clean the living room but Draco stopped him by simply waving his wand at the empty boxes and glasses. He sent them flying towards the kitchen. "We can deal with this tomorrow. Let's watch some TV instead, yes? I really need a break after all this."
Pebble appeared and bowed deep but Harry cut her off before she could even utter a word. "Please take my friend to Grimmauld Place, he'll tell you where his friends live, go and get them all," Harry told the elf, hoping that she could recognise just how vital her task was. "Just take them there, don't let them ask any questions, I'll meet you there in about thirty minutes."
"I beg your pardon, Weasley?
Crouch hadn't changed much over the last years. He looked a bit older, and even more insane than he had before. The wizard was one of the most dangerous, fearsome and radicalised men that Harry had ever encountered. But he was obviously still not good at timing his Polyjuice intake. Perhaps, anyway. Maybe he was just too stupid to care that anyone could see who he truly was.
Taking a bite of his new favourite chocolate bar, Harry went to look where Draco was waddling around so he could share it with him.
"Really?"
"You shouldn't have—I'm only here to tell you to be careful."
He never even featured in the
"They were obviously raiding the few bars down at Knockturn, maybe a few shops too. It looks like things escalated quite fast from there on in. We have at least eight people down already, no idea if they're just hurt or dead, I couldn't tell. Robards is fighting like a bloody maniac out there. I can't believe he's doing this with those strange people instead of his Auror teams."
One after the other left the room, whispering their goodbyes and patting Harry on the back, until only Ron, Hermione, Harry and the Slytherins were left.
"What if what, Potter? What if they attack me again? What if I get hurt for real next time? I hardly think that's going to happen, you've been following me wherever I go." Draco rolled his eyes at him. "You're hard to miss."
Groaning, Harry ripped the bottom part off the letter and scrawled his answer.
"You're so attentive," Draco snorted. "A real catch. Now eat, Hermione told me that you wanted to visit Kingsley, and it's nearly time for him to leave work."
"Draco?" There was no answer so he decided to go to the gardens, confident he'd find them there.
"I'll take that over being dead or in Azkaban."
"So," Mr Trenchcoat finally turned to look at Draco again. "What does ...
"You're never safe with them around." Ron shook his head. "Snakes, the whole lot of them. They're always plotting how to embarrass us."
Humming, Draco plucked another leaf and fiddled with it, grey eyes focused on the house in front of them.
I'm fucked, Potter.
and found that daily lacking any mentions of the previous night as well.
"Yeah, I really hoped that one time would be enough," Harry answered, his mind drifting back to when he was seventeen. He'd been so naive. He had truly believed that evil was gone from the world.
Watching Crouch point his wand at him with a dirty grin on his face, Harry closed his eyes.
Harry sat on the small sofa in the living room when Draco walked in, accompanied by Fred and George, a huge bag in his hand. He instantly felt nervous for no reason at all. He usually saw Draco at least once a week ever since he offered Mr Weasley help with his integration program. But seeing him here somehow felt different.
"I'll try."
"You need something to eat," Harry noted as they walked towards the room. He let his eyes flick over the man beside him. "You haven't had anything to eat in ages."
At that they were gone, leaving only Ron, Harry and George behind.
"Not saying I know her," Ron huffed as he cast a
This was too embarrassing. At least those mysterious, and really dreadful, letters had come from another guy. He had no idea why this was somehow a relief, but before he could figure out his thinking, Pansy choked on her wine beside him.
Harry leaned closer to Ron and whispered, "They're in the Ministry. Whoever it is. They're in the Ministry! And they don't really need Robards for it anymore. That's bad. That's really bloody bad!"
"So you didn't see what happened?" Blaise asked quietly as soon as Harry had finished.
They all looked at her for a few minutes, just to give her a chance to make sure that potion had the chance to do its work. Then Hermione took over again. "What is your current, and your maiden, name?"
"Fireworks? Is it already New Year’s Eve?" Malfoy asked, slightly confused.
"What happened to the shy guy I fucked six years ago? You barely managed to suck my cock. And now you'd do it in the open? My my, Potter. You never cease to surprise me."
"Castiel. Is this your idiot over there?"
"Haven't read the
"I'll be there."
Harry helped Arthur to work on his newest project until Draco and Molly called them both inside for lunch.
Draco's answering smile was all he needed to know that this was worth every struggle he'd have to face.
"No need to freak out," Draco huffed, finally turning around and looking at Harry. "Nothing else has happened, and not everything is your job! You had to rest, and I made sure you did so." He shook his head. "You won't be able to focus on anything while you're tired, so then you won't be of any use for this mission. And neither will I be if I have to worry if you're staying alive or not."
Standing in the middle of the office, Harry looked around, frantically trying to find a place Robards could hide something. He could use a spell, but that was risky. Robards would very likely have detection spells over his office.
They were alive, and they'd have dinner tonight, and things would be fine. They had the rest of their lives and Harry didn't think he'd ever been so grateful just to exist.
Draco instinctively wanted to reach for his wand but stopped himself from doing so. The MACUSA didn't joke around with the statute of secrecy, and they were surrounded by Muggles. Salazar, he still wasn't sure if Castiel was a wizard or just a weirdo.
"I'd trust Draco Malfoy with my life," Harry replied, without a quiver of hesitation in his voice. "If I see his name on one of those lists then I'll quit the second I see it."
"You never did," Malfoy huffed.
"So, do you think we should get the recluse first? I figure he'll keep us busy for the rest of the day. And once we have him securely here we can go home," Ron announced after they finished their lunch break and were back hard at work examining their files.
