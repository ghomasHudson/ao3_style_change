There; in a rocky clearing next to a cave entrance was the most breathtaking sight Harry had ever seen.
J'ai beau trimer, sans toi ma vie n'est qu'un décor qui brille,
“You okay Charlie?” Bill asked as he stopped beside his brother and placed his hand on his shoulder.
“Harry! Try your animagus form!” Charlie hollered. Harry lifted his head from his knees and stared down the dragon before standing up. He stood there thinking for a moment as the dragon eyed him warily.
"I'll tell you anything," Draco replied.
“You are me,” Harry said softly as he closed his eyes and yawned. Gosh, was he tired. Being so; he still could have sworn he'd seen the silhouette of something standing beside his bed.
"Harry came up with a solution to save you...anima reddetur votum," he answered softly.
"No one you need to be worried about. Now, that's all you remember?" Snape was worried now. If Harry had forgotten about what he'd done, and about Draco how was he going to explain everything.
“We need to find him, if we don’t who knows what he’ll do,” Sirius finally said and Severus agreed.
“I will have nothing to do with anyone that insults and belittles others. Especially when they don’t even give a chance to know the people they loath so much!” Harry yelled back over his shoulder and slammed the doors behind him. Draco lifted a brow as he watched the angry Kitsune kick the door before turning and heading in the same direction Draco was headed.
There was a noise that LeFay had to assume was a laugh as Draco shook and stood to his full height.
He cursed himself for being so emotional.
“You were right, his psyche is tearing itself apart, there’s only so much I can do and his magic is still recovering,” Severus stated as he tried to stabilize Cadmael. He’d been doing so well, and now this. He wished Harry hadn’t taken it this far but he understood why. Cadmael needed to know, and the others needed to see that he hadn’t betrayed them willingly, that he’d fought Albus every step of the way.
Minerva set her hand on top of Harry’s and squeezed it gently. “It’s okay, they aren’t here right now. And I’ll have them expelled after we finish this conversation, but I need you to tell us what happened next,” she said softly, glancing at Snape. He handed her a calming draught from his cloak which she gave to Harry. He drank it in slow sips before letting out a long sigh and closed his eyes for a moment.
"I'm sorry, it's just."
“Dumbledore must have had them sealed and ordered to be read at a later date because of the circumstances of their death,” he stated before motioning Harry to keep reading.
Hermione smiled and nodded. "Glad to help. I think we'll need to find something written about Hyena's though. I still find it odd that they chose this creature rather than something else," she stated. Ron groaned.
Harry could feel the pain and hurt directed at him as Draco turned his attention to him. He looked away quickly, his hands gripping Cadmael’s fur tightly as he felt the man underneath the fur breath. He was grateful he wasn’t dead, and confused as to why he felt so connected, so betrayed all at once.
'You're awake?' LeFay said happily, glad to feel his mentor again.
“Heir Malfoy,” Harry nodded, bowing sarcastically before going back to unpacking his things. Draco was pleasantly surprised, it was the first time Harry had called him by his title. Maybe he was getting better manners when dealing with purebloods.
Draco raised his hands to his head, stressing at his hair before dropping his hands to his neck, disappointed when he found nothing there to ground him. Nothing to remind him with a hundred percent certainty that what they had was real. He sighed, glancing at his full length mirror. His horns, wings, talons, and tail still showed, letting him know that their bond had still yet to settle. It made him anxious, knowing that when it faded away it could be for two reasons, and with how everything was looking now he was worried it wouldn’t be what he wanted.
Harry nodded at the empty air where his godfather had been and cast a few quick glamours. One on his face to shift his features a bit, and another on his legs to change the color of his fur and make it a bit coarser. Concentrating hard he was able to dissolve his tails before stepping into the floo. Hopefully his concentration would last long enough for their shopping trip. “Diagon Alley!” he said determinedly.
Harry nodded, sitting quietly as he collected his thoughts.
Anyways, thank you guys so much for reading and leaving your comments. I asure you all I am much better now, health wise, and very determined to get this writing out. If any, any, of you have ideas or tidbits you want suggest or talk about (or point out my bad story structure) please, please, do so in the comments below. It's absolutely great hearing back from you guys and makes me want to get chapters out as soon as possible.
She sighed and crossed her arms while Theo smirked and shrugged.
Draco finds himself up against Cadmael. A jaguar beastman that's been playing the group for a while now.
“Feel about what exactly?”
After he finished unpacking Draco headed back to drawing room, only to find not only his mother and Remus there, but also Sirius. The door closed behind him as he stepped in, causing him to jump.
it stated. Harry tilted his head. His mate?
LeFay felt his instincts kick into over drive as he gripped Draco tighter; the arrowhead pendant scorching his skin.
“Oh?”
Minerva sighed, tilting her head slightly before pursing her lips. “You have two days to complete an animagus transformation. Everyone else going already knows how to, and if what I’m understanding from Charlie’s suggestion you are going to need to be able to. If you are able to become an animagus within those two days, come to my office and show me. If I deem it acceptable then you may go with them,” she paused and then turned to leave, “Remember Mister Potter. Two days.”
Harry smiled and then started laughing as well. "And here I thought Ghost was just enjoyed terrorizing people for no reason," Harry chuckled. He climbed up into his bed and patted Ghost's head. "Sorry I misread you," he told the albino striped hyena. Ghost seemed very appreciated of the apology and head butted Harry's chin. Harry let our an oof as he fell back on the bed, not ready for the sheer force Ghost hit him with. Ghost froze then, grey-white eyes wide as he stared down at Harry. He whined slightly as Harry groaned.
“Mmm, change can be a powerful thing. Even the smallest change can set off a life changing events.”
Breakfast seemed to drag on for the five of them, especially for Harry. Though he had to admit, his mind was other places. Would he really be able to face a dragon? Voldemort had at least been…Human-ish.
Deciding he couldn’t sit around his room any longer today, he headed out, making his way down the maze of halls till he reached the double doors that opened onto the courtyard. He wasn’t surprised to see the amount of people training there, it was actually a bit refreshing. He smiled at a few who stopped to look at him, they smiled back too, waving at him. He decided that while he did like it, it was a bit too many people here, and honestly he needed to let off some steam. Some were he could change safely. His thoughts floated back to the hedge maze, and a small smirk formed. Yes, that would be sufficient.
“Don’t look at me,” Theo chuckled when Herm gave him a short glare.
"Yes," Draco murmured, "Within reason of course. Who wouldn't be in this position?"
“Bad luck?”
“What seems to be amiss?” Draco questioned as he made his way over to the fire. Remus looked tired and worn standing beside Sirius.
Finishing his packing Draco headed to the first floor, picking up a few scones as he made his way out the back and through the kitchen. What he didn’t expect was to find Severus there waiting for him. He stopped, staring at the dower man.
Six years after Harry's disappearance, Draco, Sirius, and Remus still search non stop for him. After breaking into hive of vampires deep in the Forest of Rothiemurchus he finds himself running for his life, only to stumble into wards that feel familiar to him.
Remus watched from the side lines along with Narcissa and the two shared a knowing look for a moment. “How about we postpone the lessons and meetings for today. I think it would be a nice day to go out. We need a few new ingredients for your extra potions lessons with Snape and also set up a few things at Hogwarts,” Remus stated.
Bring me your peace and my wounds, they will heal
Tom, Severus, and Lucius would hang back for most of it, saying in the other room for the will reading and hanging back while they shopped. This way Albus wouldn’t start piecing anything together. They wanted this to look like just one man behind the will reading, Regulus. A man suddenly back from the dead that was claiming Potter as his own. They couldn’t let Albus know there were others, or he might become threatened and try something too soon. No, they still needed time to set everything right.
Tatsuya felt aggravated that his vessel was so goody goody.
Finally, Harry headed downstairs. It had only taken him another hour to figure something out but by that time Sirius and Remus where up as well, drinking tea and coffee while reading the Daily Prophet.
he said rather matter-of-factly. Harry remember what Sirius had said about his kitsune side finding a way to soften the blow from the bonds Dumbledore put on him and guessed that was what he was talking about.
“Will Mister Harry be needing anything else?” she asked and beamed at him.
” Harry kept his voice low as he walked over to his bed and sat down beside his snake.
“Harry watch out!” she yelled too late, Harry was trying to counter Seamus’s spell as third party’s spell hit him and sent him flying backwards. Parvati screamed before he heard a chaos of hissing and spells flying. When he hoped his eyes, Seamus was standing over him. Blood dripping down his face from a scratch along his hair line.
“You, my Lord.”
“Fine,” Draco stated and waved a hand dismissively at him, “But promise you’ll stick to Luna or Neville like glue when I’m not around. I know they both have the one class I don’t have with you.” Harry smiled and then nodded before leaping at Draco and hugging him.
Harry nodded, “Speaking of which, we should get redressed and head to the main hall. The meeting I called for should be happening soon.”
Draco snorted. "You aren't getting jealous are you? I know you and my mother are together now, but you do know that those two only married out of duty right?" he asked as he pulled some white grape juice out and set it on the counter. Tom scowled.
"How have the two of you been getting along so far?" Severus asked slowly. Ghost's head picked up quickly and he seemed to shake his head vigorously no but Snape ignored him. "I have to say, I didn't think you'd warm up to him so quickly," he paused then mumbled under his breath, "This could be a problem."
Next was the Gryffindor and Slytherin rings which seemed a lot picker. They took around a minute to settle on their individual fingers, the gold and silver bands glittering side by side. The emerald and ruby in both seemed to be trying to outdo the other which caused Harry to smile. He could almost see the personalities of the first people to wear the two rings. Last was the LeFay ring which he slipped onto the same finger as his Slytherin ring. At first Harry wasn’t sure it would resize to his finger. Both Remus and Harry frowned as the wait lengthened. Sirius even walked back into the room moments later, adding his own anxious stare to the mix. Harry felt the ring testing his magic as well as the other rings. He smiled as, after five minutes, it finally settled and started morphed on his finger. It blended itself with the Slytherin ring, mixing the silver metal with a soft blue hue and creating a design that had everyone in awe. When it was finished taking form a blue-grey fox with emerald eyes sat on his finger, and in the coils of its nine tails was a white diamond that seemed to be blazing with an inner fire. When the magic from all the rings settled, Harry felt a shiver down his spine and what felt like a weight lifting off his chest. His face tickled and he reached up to touch it, surprised when he felt smooth skin.
"Oh Harry," a soft voice said in his ear. He turned and Hermione let go of him as he did. He lifted a paw to wipe his face only to have Hermione hold onto it, smiling sadly at him. "I'll do everything I can to help you find Draco and Parvati," she said softly. The others nodded, causing Harry to smile a little. He had such good friends. He looked down at his shredded clothes and let out a sigh.
“Now, I can tell that your aura is off. Tell me what had happened.”
"Answer?" Harry whispered.
“Tails?” Harry spun around in a circle as he tried to get a look at his hinny, almost falling over in the process.
“What?” Neville snapped, embarrassed that he had been spooked.
"This is serious, you don't even know how he. It could kill both of you!"
Harry sat up then, still looking up at the eyes with a slight smile on his face. He was absolutely ready to leave, ready for what waited for him next yet.
Draco didn’t seem to care. He watched LeFay sit still for a long moment, and Draco guessed he was having a conversation with his 'other half'.
Snape rubbed Draco’s back as the young man continued sobbing quietly.
“Where is my son!” Sirius yelled, his eyes already starting to leak.
Harry takes Draco, or rather Ghost, back the dorms, scaring everyone in the lion's den. Then he has to find a way to explain the large creature staying with him to his best friends.
Hati laughed. "You sure have some nerve coming here," Hati smiled.
Draco pulled his head away and lowered himself into the snow, giving LeFay a way to climb up onto Draco's back.
Lucius let out a deep sigh and leaned forward, running his hands over his face. He was tired, tired of everything that been happening lately. Tired that they seemed to be always in peril one way or another. "After your mother looks you over," he stated softly.
Ammit asked. Harry continued to dress, tilting his head from one side to the other.
LeFay’s emerald eyes turned to focus on Draco, sending a shiver down the blonde's spine.
Defeated he sat back down on his bed and glared at the floor. He had to come up with some plan to dress normally, or it would ruin his mood. He could do what he did last night, but the jeans he had used where extremely baggy on him. One of the hand-me-downs he still had from Dudley. Minutes passed by as he tried to come up with some form of a plan, only coming to the same conclusion over and over.
Wait what? This voice new about his inheritance?
“Sir, I don’t know if-,” Douglas started to object.
The last fight, the one to finally end this nightmare of event.
Skoll nodded.
Draco's eyes widened in shock as it started dawning on him what he was actually in for. Gods help him.
Harry asked in parsletongue. The Naga relaxed and then smiled at Harry.
"What? The bed looked fluffy," Theo whined. Hermione patted his head and whispered something into his ear which he smiled at.
"You are?" Draco asked slowly, unsure of what the man wanted.
“We’ll take it then,” Regulus said, looking down at Harry.
Tatsuya growled, curling tightly around LeFay's mind. Harry, LeFay, tried to shrug him off, but soon gave into the urgent pulling at his mind.
Bill chuckled and patted Harry on the back before steering him into the middle of the room. “Before we get started explained everything to Lord Potter, we should make sure he is actually an animagus,” Charlie stated as he sat in a chair, watching Harry. Bill scowled at him.
Ulkalb cleared his throat again and then gestured around the room, “Everything else has already been separated and placed in the vaults indicated on keys. In the vaults you will find letters if there was anything they wanted to personally say to each of you. Was there anything else?” he said, addressing his question to Regulus.
“You understand a bit more then,” Hisashi commented.
“Knew what Severus. What are you two talking about?” she squeaked, “Explain yourselves this instant, we have to find Potter!”
“We will now begin the reading of James and Lily Evans Potter's wills.” The goblin cleared his throat as he spoke and pulled out a large case which he then opened and set before him as he began reading.
Please, please comment. All feedback is much appreciated!
Draco frowned, “Are you sure you’ll be okay to face Dumbledore?”
“Ah, Harry. You slept in for quite a while. Remus and Sirius wanted to stay till you woke up, but it was best for them to leave quickly. Parvati had her own wounds and her sister to care for. McGonagall also needs to know what happened right away so she can figure out what precautions to take. Knowing her she’ll have all the bases covered, so I doubt we’ll have anything to worry about,” Bill explained as he got up and handed Harry a bowl of porridge. “Charlie has already started to try working with Draco but, it hasn’t been going very well,” he added.
Harry gave one last squeeze around Ghost's neck before reaching for his wand to check the time. It was only ten minutes before he'd set his wand to wake him, so rather than sit there waiting, he decided on getting up now rather than later. He pulled the curtains back from around his bed slowly, not wanting to wake up Ron or any of the others. He rarely got the chance to take showers with no one around, so he usually woke up early to do so. Ghost sat on the bed, watching him curiously as Harry dug around in his chest. He was glad that Sirius had gotten him new clothes over the summer so he didn't have to wear Duddly's had me downs, though thinking about it made him depressed. Since Sirius couldn't prove his innocence Harry was still forced to live with his Muggle relatives.
Harry replied as he stroked Ammit’s head. Harry looked over at Draco, still flopped on the bed, and chuckled quietly. Draco lifted his head and glared at Potter. Scooting up the bed, he turned and sat with his back facing Potter. Ammit slithered down from Harry as the raven-head made his way over to the bed, placing his hands onto it bed and leaning on them.
“Yes. To wipe all entities, he deemed dark off the face of the earth. Solidify himself as the leader of the wizarding world,” he paused, “Everybody wants to rule the world. Doesn’t matter what they sacrifice to achieve it either.”
He explored the book cases along the walls for the room first. His finger trailing across a few of the titles that stood out to him. Some of them were pretty dusty, while others seemed to have been used quite recently. Draco wondered what Harry's taste was like. Was LeFay more into history? Perhaps charms, potions? Or maybe he was a sucker for works of fiction. The thought made Draco smile.
"Harry."
LeFay groaned, now he had to actually think about this. What he really wanted, those rushes of emotions and instincts he tried to ignore, that made him disgusted with himself every time he felt them. This was it, his first lesson to unlearning everything that had been drilled into him by Albus and the weasels. He inhaled, finding that thread that he could feel between him and Draco, not just the one that they’d formed, but the one each creature tied to magic had. Grabbing hold of it he let his magic stroke it, watching it flare to life before opening his eyes again.
"I guess it's off to Professor Snape's office now," Harry stated softly as he stopped at the next corner. Draco looked up at him, confused for a moment.
"Meet you're new partner in crime. Harry meet Ghost. Ghost, this is your charge, Harry James Potter."
“How is he doing?” Snape asked as he sat down by the fire, Bill following. Harry looked up and frowned, shaking his head sadly.
LeFay cleared his throat. “If you wish it, there is a spell to break the marriage bond placed within the collar-.”
Harry.
“Neville, are you a-.”
When he looked back, a giant bright purple eye was staring back at him. Harry froze and he could feel all the hair on his body standing on end. It continued to stare at him as Harry held his breath, watching it watch him. The water started to tremor slightly as the dragon shifted and began to lift its head; water free falling and rolling off his scales. The group back at the fire felt the tremors and started yelling Harry’s name.
He stood up, keeping his eyes on the castle walls ad he started across the moss-covered ground. Keeping his wands drawn Draco walked through the large arching gate way; his eyes searching the stone walls for any hints of what this place might be. Looking around the courtyard he could see a few bubbling fountains, and heard birds chirping like it was the middle of spring. He couldn’t help but smile slightly,  this place was amazing. He'd heard about places being kept seasonless with magic or stuck in a particular season but he'd never seen it done before.
"What I was saying," he paused, trying to find the words.
“I don’t know how she plans on getting any of the money or ‘support’ she talked about. Dumbledore stated that because of Regulus’ disappearance I wouldn’t be able to claim the Lordship. Since the ring disappeared with him that is,” Sirius stated. Harry’s eye brows furrowed.
“I see you aren’t alone, just like Hogwarts,” Draco hissed.
"I didn't mean to scare you, it's just. Eh," the man scratched the back of his head and half smiled.
Skoll chuckled, “That’s what kinks are for.”
"He seemed to have thought so, but I would guess he wasn't completely sure," Tom answered. "I don't really understand it myself, but something has kept me alive through everything. All I can think of is that Lady Magic needs us. All of us for something I'm not quite sure I want to be a part of. Yet, she has reunited me with my kin, and given me my mind and soul back. If it saves Harry's life, I'm willing to do it."
“Severus, I believe you have a few more potions to administer before we continue,” LeFay pointed, his free hand then landing on Draco’s head, and coming through the young dragonlings’ hair.
“It was the only way we had to reverse the effects,” Severus started to explain. Slowly he enlightened Draco on all the details of the last few days. It was long and rather tedious but Draco didn’t interrupt during any of it, only seeming to become less and less aggravated as he spoke. At the end, Draco looked over at Harry, something stirring in his chest as he did. Harry had become an animagus in just two short days? Just for him?
“Hello?” The hair on the back of his neck stood on end and he cast a quick lumos.
“You just left me after this?!” he gestured angrily at the collar, “After I protected you, saved you!” He closed his eyes trying to calm his boiling blood. “I understand you didn’t know what it was at the time, but after all these years? I thought you would have figured it out by now. I can't, I haven’t been able to do anything with my life because of this!”
Remus watched Dragoon warily as the goblin cast a quick cleaning charm to remove any blood left over. Kneesprocket stepped up in front of Lupin to lead him into position. He did as he was instructed, not paying any attention to the others as Dragoon came over to Sirius with a small box, opening it and showing him the Black Ring.
Hermione froze a little bit, and Theo looked at her slightly puzzled. She blushed a deep red, "Well um yes...but I'd rather."
he stopped, waiting for it to sink in. When Harry didn’t seem to get, it he sighed.
LeFay squeezed Draco tighter, "I've always accepted you Draco. I'm just never sure you will accept me, what I am now. I'm afraid you'll see me as that kid that was under Albus' thumb all those years ago, and not the man I am today. I'm afraid you'll find something you don't like and realize I'm not what who you thought I was," he said as he buried his face into Draco's neck.
Dinky repeated the same habit of bowing, like Winky, and disappeared.
Draco stirred slightly at that, his eyes opening. '
So that’s what happened when Draco got emotional! Harry hadn't been hallucinating!
“Really?” Harry asked in surprise. Remus sighed but nodded and rolling his eyes as he ruffled between Harry's ears. Both Sirius and Remus watched in amusement as Harry finished his inspection off. Playing with his snout and teeth before finally glancing back up at his fathers as they laughed. He then remembered what Remus had said. Something about magical blocks, and he still wanted to know how long he had been out for.
“What? What happened?” Sirius asked frantically.
“What do you mean?” August asked, taking a quick step towards Cadmael as the atmosphere in the room changed.
“Tatsuya, what’s happening? How can I see you?” Harry asked as he looked in the mirror, turning his head and body. The slightly transparent Kitsune shifted beside him and chuckled.
Harry started giggling. “It would seem that having your animagus form mistaken for the Grim wasn't as off as we thought it was. Makes a lot more sense now,” Lupin snickered. Sirius frowned and was about to say something snappy at his lover when he felt his ears move. His hands shot up to the sides of his head as Harry's giggling grew louder. There. Sitting atop his head was two delicate darkened wolf-like ears. Thankfully they blended well into hair.
“Oh, so we are back to this Malfoy?” Harry’s voice seemed hallow as he spoke, and a frown formed on his face. Draco hesitated for a moment, as the emerald stare settled onto his own. It was haunting, almost like looking into a cat’s stare for too long only to realize they were looking through you. Draco shook his head and looked away, his eyes unfocused as he thought back onto what they’d shared the last few days.
"Lord Malfoy," he said quietly.
“Well they are both addressed to you, and with what happened at Gringotts, well, you owe them a great deal. Best to read their's first," he paused to glance at Harry sternly, "just in case it’s something to do with the damage you caused." Harry turned red and nodded as he opened the letter and began to read.
"Well, everyone...Hermione. Maybe a little help here on what to do," Harry stated. He felt Tatsuya chuckled in his head and he scowled. "I mean you're an animagus too right?" he asked.
the dragon hissed. Harry stiffened, green pupil-less eyes widening as he saw the recognition in Draco's eyes. He took a step forward and touched his nose to Draco’s. The dragon pulled its head back after a moment and shook its head rather valiantly. Scaring Harry and causing him to panic as he looked back and forth between the dragon’s suddenly spasming muscles and the way Draco tossed his head.
"HARRY!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. As the glass shattered, Harry's eye snapped open and he looked at Draco in surprise. Suddenly everything was rushing towards Draco and he felt his body being smashed against surface after surface. He was gasping for breath before he suddenly saw the arms coming for him. Harry screaming no echoed in the waves of red as Draco felt panic envelope him.
Harry watched in horror as Tatsuya started to attack the wolves ruthlessly, giving their members a face full of claws and antlers. 'Don't kill them!' LeFay yelled as he tried to take control again. Tatsuya simply shoved his host's mind away, lunging at the closest attacker again. LeFay could feel their body being picked up in a wolf's jaws and tossed into a snow field were they skidding to a stop.
Draco felt the collar hum with the command but he didn't move. "No. Not until you admit it."
Tom cleared his throat as he sat, his arms resting on the sides of the chair. "Let's start with where I came from. Dumbledore found me at the orphanage, yes?" Severus nodded. "I didn't know any of my family, I was only hell bent on making sure no one ended up in the position I found myself in as a child. However, what I didn't know was that I had family. Not until I took an inheritance test under the advisement of the goblins. They assured me there had to be something connecting me to the magical world or I wouldn't have any abilities. They told me of a past where muggles and wizards lived peacefully together once, and bred together on various occasions till the idea of purebloods came to our world. Every muggle born can be traced back to a line, Severus. Each and everyone of them. The power just hibernates till it finds the best match. Salazar knew this, but he also knew that muggles feared us and our powers for good reason. It wasn't because he didn't see muggle borns as equal, he couldn't keep watching them die."
"Don't," Ron snapped. He was still sore about what had happened with his sister, especially after what his sister had told him. Just then the rest of the boys started filling in, and Ghost (comically wide eyed) made a run for Harry's bed for safety. "Just leave it," Ron sighed finally and got up from his bed, heading for the bathroom.
Hermione rolled her eyes, "Obviously not yet, if he was then he'd have something marking him as Harry's." Ron shrugged his shoulder then.
Dumbledore confronts Severus about Harry's new Familiar to be.
"Ghost no! Don't attack Neville! Down boy!" Harry started shouting. Neville however was already fleeing up the stairs to the dorms with Draco hot on his heels. Harry hissed, gritting his teeth and then ran after them.
Draco's lips pursed as he reached for his drink, “I was wondering… The new scar on your face,” he drifted off, his gaze questioning as he lifted the cup to his lips.
(Cue Flashback ^.^)
However, LeFay was more focused on the subconscious movement made by Draco. The fact Draco's hand went to the collar and pressed against it surprised LeFay. Was it resentment, or nostalgia?
Draco rolled his eyes and turned from the balcony. Some reading would clear his head.
Draco is starting to second guess everything he has hoped for. Especially when a stranger starts creating a divide between the two.
"Soo, about Ginny," Harry started.
“It’s dragon hide. From an Antipodean Opaleye. It’s pretty rare to find one of that quality,” Draco stated. Harry was surprised and gingerly opened the book to the multi colored shimmering ribbon Draco left when he closed it.
Draco thanked his lucky stars.
“While I’m not a fan of sharing,” he growled, “It isn’t unheard of people like us to take multiple mates. Even just as wizards it's still seen as vaguely normal. Obviously in pureblood lines it's frowned upon, but even then once there is a solid heir it isn’t unheard of for someone to take another partner. Unlike muggle society it isn’t illegal to be married to multiple people, though each one's marriage is still held separately financially unless all the partners are linked together by magic bonding, like us two are. I am, however, disappointed by your taste in men.”
It was dark, cold, and the wind was starting to pick up again.
Tatsuya commented. Harry laughed and smiled; he couldn’t wait to tell his friends about his experience.
Draco nodded, taking a deep breath as he closed his eyes, focusing on that deep feeling, that need he'd always had. He felt the air stir around him and when he opened his eyes he could see the blackness was mingling with Draco's own aura. The purple circling in on them, almost fighting with the darkness around them. Draco could feel Jariss above him as he spoke, "I know what my duty is," they said in unison. LeFay stepped forward and let his hand caress the side of Draco's cheek.
The scent that filled Harry's being calmed him beyond compare. Oh how he'd missed being this close. He'd grown tired of looking at an empty side of the bed.
The whole hall had turned into a buzz of whispers as Snape stopped by the Headmaster's seat.
P.S. I Honestly wanted to write more for this chapter, but I thought where I ended the chapter was probably the proper place.
Draco was at a loss of words as he stared at the, mostly, nude Potter in front of him. He had a point about the scars but they were sharing a bed! “I’m guessing that means you’re wearing that horrific thing to bed,” Harry stated and gestured at Draco’s pj set. Draco glared at him, tempted to throw the baggy at him.
Pour oublier ma peine immense
"No, no. I'm good. I'll just head back downstairs," Neville said from his bed. Harry waited as it took Neville a moment to actually start moving. As he walked past them Neville made a big circle around them, slowing down when he neared the door and then stopping. "He's actually kind of cute isn't he," Neville commented as he looked back at the hyena chewing on the fruit bar. Harry smiled in and nodded. Neville smiled back and then headed down the stairs.
Sirius didn’t respond, instead only smiling sadly.
For parseltongue dialogue I have changed it to where its just '***' and italics rather than stretching out the s's as well. Since there is going to be a lot more of it, it's easier on my fingers. Don't judge =(^ . ^)=
“That’s just what I was going to ask. You know it’s dangerous for anyone with a creature inheritance to walk around by themselves,” Theo added.
Harry's eyes shimmered with emotion for a moment before they turned cold, "Nothing. This is just a dream, and you need to wake up." Draco shook his head.
“No,” Hermione said quietly. Seeing the hollow look on Harry’s face she reached over and squeezed his shoulder. “They could have gotten out of the way and just haven’t been found yet. The castle is enormous, they could have gotten lost if they fell down into a catacomb,” she suggested, trying to make him feel better.
“Others are from brawls with opposing fractions. Or just for fun,” LeFay chuckled flashing his fangs.
"I know what I said. I was lying. I've always known we were mates," he said with a sigh, "Harry might not have known in the beginning, but when I fully awoke, I knew it instantly." He fiddled with his thumbs, unsure of how Draco would react.
“There’s no thanks needed pup,” Sirius stated as he hugged the two of them tightly.
“They don’t have to do this, I trust them just as they are now,” Harry protested. He wouldn’t want them to swear themselves to anything they didn’t want to do.
"Then do it." Severus nodded and moved, collecting what he needed with out thinking. The blood from Draco was easy to get and as he reached out for Harry's hand he met a startlingly mature gaze.
“Yes, I suppose that assumption is correct. If you were to go to a mind healer Tatsuya’s essence could be purged. Perhaps a muggle trained counselor or therapist?” he suggested, “Now, go ahead and take your proper form,” Hisashi’s white maw frowned, his head turning slowly to the opening of the maze. “It would seem we have a guest.”
"You know, it's really weird seeing you without the ears and all harry legs. Yet, it seems like you're even more clumsy now," Theo stated as he put his arm around Hermione.
The eyes rolled above Harry, impatient. "They really don't know when to give up, do they? You have been through too much already and they greedily want you back there. Can they not let you rest in piece?" the darkness spoke.
Severus cleared his throat from the side lines, holding his wan to his side. “Please get into position. Just for everyone, there has been a formal contest laid down against the mating and claiming of one Lord LeFay. The rules are as stands; as it includes the lows of magical creatures both wand magic and any magic or abilities coinciding with said participants bloodlines are allowed. The duel will end when the opponent is either incapable of fighting any longer, or the contesting party withdraws their contest. While killing your opponent is frowned upon it will not be restricted by the rules currently in place,” Severus announced. LeFay could tell Severus was worried.
Shaking his head Draco sat up, panting from the effort it had taken to run through the snow. Which to his surprise, had all disappeared. Instead surrounding him was a bed of green moss, and he lifted his gaze from the ground his jaw dropped. Stone walls stood before him in pristine condition.
"Harry, you know you should be focusing on what we are doing right now in class, these books aren't going to help you," she stated. Ghost stopped his sniffing around the room, his head tilted to the side. His eyes where trained on the book Hermione was currently putting in her bag. Draco though that Hermione would have been pushing Harry to read books like that. He couldn't believe what he just heard her say even. He stayed frozen for a long time, eyeing Hermione suspiciously.
Draco sat at his desk, frowning at the tower of paper work on it. He cursed the day he’d told Severus he’d help with his potion business.
Harry eyed the box warily before setting the letter aside and opening the box. Inside was a collar, and Harry was stunned by its craftsmanship. It sported Amethysts all around it with a large metal loop in the middle of it. It seemed to be made of the same black metal as his Black Heir ring, which he found intriguing. He looked for more information in the box but only found a small slip that told which charms where on it.
"It wasn't what you thought you heard back there," LeFay added quickly after hearing the dragon scoff at him.
“How did it go?” he asked. Remus was grinning from ear to ear like a goof before he tried to school his expression. Clearing his throat and straightening his clothes with a few quick tugs.
Draco found himself looking into the mirror, panicked and already covered in sweat. What had he gotten himself into this time? How could he have been so blinded by lust for this man that he hardly knew?
Skoll bowed in apology before standing again, his eyes meeting with Draco's.
Draco was speechless. Even his father hadn’t been so cruel. Who could do such a thing to a someone, much less a child. “What all did they do to you?” he asked Harry.
Harry on the other hand was confused, and a little shocked by the set up. “What’s all of this for, Sirius?” he asked, eyes narrowing, he still felt a little off being around Sirius. However, seeing his father’s creature ears in full view today made him think it might be pureblood related. His own ears had been humming since he entered the room.
“I said enough, enough of all this self deprivation. While you are Lord LeFay, and you have a responsibility to your followers, Draco, the stubborn man that he is, chose his own path. That collar stayed on because he refused to give up on you. And as much as it makes me sick to say so, it would seem Cadmael is the same. You push others out when they get too close, but you don’t ever let them make the decision on if they want to leave or not. While I will not defend Draco’s earlier actions, you didn’t give him much of a choice. You didn’t give much of a choice to either of them, you didn’t give them the chance to see the monster.”
Thinking back to that day six years ago still made LeFay sick sometimes.
“Lord LeFay, I’d like to make this clear that we will not tolerate being-.”
Et je m'envole, vole, vole, vole, vole, vole
Draco sighed, shifting his position as his breathing leveled out. "What do you remember?" Severus asked. "Don't try to speak, my mind is open and your magic is to unstable to produce a voice from your current form. Just use pictures like a taught you." Draco nodded and sniffed, his eyes closing as he drew up the last thing he remembered. He had been laying down at Harry's feet, anxious about Harry knowing the truth. He remembered feeling scared that Harry might not comply with there plan, that he might try to kill Draco again if given the chance. "Focus," Severus voice said softly. Draco's ears flicked in frustration as he thought harder. He remembered the hissing, scales rubbing across hardwood, blood. Blood everywhere, red water, arms...HARRY!
Tatsuya asked, stirring in Harry's mind.
“We’ll see you later Harry,” she said as she started to walk away. Theo stayed for a moment and looked Harry over before reaching into his pocket and then handing Harry a bay leaf.
"You did try to kill us all at one point or another," Draco snapped. He looked up sharply when he did and then cleared his throat, "Sorry, I mean-"
Draco lifted his scaly head, nudging Harry’s naked body and causing him to stumble a bit. “So, how long do you plan on staying like that?” Harry asked, crossing his arm over his chest. Draco snorted, glancing around before he stretched, and stood from his position. He stretched out his wings as he looked for a spot in the maze clearing that would be large enough for him to stretch out completely in. He found one, a bit of an awkward fit around the gazebo but it was enough for him to lay out on his side and sun his scales.
“Well that’s odd, it says this one is from Gringotts. What’s the other say Harry?” Remus asked as he took a seat at the table. Harry’s mouth twitched.
The robe he ended up gabbing was a light grey with gold freckled trim, a great color against his eyes. He felt a light stirring at the back of his mind and guessed Tatsuya was waking from what ever meditation he'd been doing for the night. 'Good morning,'  LeFay thought to Tatsuya, smiling when he felt a caring nudge in the back of his head.
Neville looked over at Harry, sympathetic to his blight. He had heard from Harry how bad it had been at that house of horrors with his muggle relatives. He doubted heavily that Harry had even talked to Sirius or Remus about it.
Hermione stopped her crying and looked over her shoulder.
So that’s what Harry was holding; Draco thought that Harry'd destroyed it.
Severus was even further confused, and shook his head. He was starting to get a migraine. "How?" he asked, "Well I mean I know how horcrux's are made but, how?"
“Well, that is something.”
Snape reached for Draco’s shoulder and then stopped.
'Sorry to my unknown lover
“I see that you are on time today,” Hisashi stated with a small smile.
Shrugging he paused in his search for clothes and opened the letter, frowning when he unfolded it.
Draco glanced around. Apparently no one could hear what was happening and Draco, never having any siblings, had no idea what to do. He thought about what he'd want to wake up to if he had a nightmare and then acted. Placing his legs over top of Harry's torso to keep him from struggling more and hurting himself he then started licking Harry's face, trying to wake him. He started whining when that didn't seem to work by it's self. Slowly Harry came around, sniffling as he sat up and started rubbing at his eyes furiously.
Harry pushed his hand away and then shrugged as he turned away and headed over to get his books for the next class period.
“He wouldn’t, he was like a father..” Cadmael mumbled, his head starting to hang as his knees buckled and he knelt on the floor.
Regulus stepped up being Harry and smiled, “It will be fine,” he said to the counter man. Upon seeing him, and glancing at the Lord Black finger on Regulus’ hand he started to apologize but Regulus cut him off.
“Known what?” Harry asked.
,” Harry said, and Ammit nodded. Sirius came to the back of the store then and stopped in his tracks.
"Why now?" Harry asked, his eyes sliding from the hyena to Dumbledore.
Voldemort bit hit lip and nodded before looking over his shoulder. Slowly he made his way over to the bed, clutching his bloody arm.
The room was silent but Severus could tell Augusta was pissed. As was Albus but he was the one getting all the dirty looks. Neville was pale and he was sharing an empathetic look with Harry who had his hands tightly wound into Ghost’s fur. Sirius looked pissed, and Severus was even sure that if Remus hadn’t been holding onto the man he would have already hexed the old fart. Severus shifted his gaze to Harry, feeling a pang of guilt. If he had known. Yes, it would have been hard to take Harry in, but he would have if he'd known. For Lily.
August, currently not involved in the bickering bickering was watching LeFay. He could tell his friend was tired, and as his eyes passed over the other eleven generals could tell it just wasn't the time to be arguing.
“I wasn’t expecting visitors, Lord Malfoy.”
LeFay watched intently for a moment, something was different about Draco that he hadn't noticed before. Was he, trying to be...Kinder? "Hmm, so, what exactly is the purpose of getting to know me better?" LeFay asked, "You didn't exactly seem like you liked the Harry Potter of old to begin with."
The fox's nine tails flowed out behind him like a dark fan and Harry felt chills down his spine.
Draco snapped back into his body, almost falling from the side of the bed. "Harry!" he hooted loudly. Suddenly the china doll boy that laid out before him sprang to life screaming, his eyes wide in what seemed like panic. He jumped back from the room full of people, hissing and spiting as he leaped off the bed and ran to the corner. He hurried under a table, keeping himself low to the ground as he watched the other beings in the room.
LeFay looked down at his papers and shook his head. "I can't worry about him right now. We have a lot of work to do," he stated.
Draco didn’t even stop to look where he was going, barely batting branches out of his way as he heard the singing continue.
Neville nodded while Hermione pouted in her seat. Harry played with his thumbs, his ears slopping back against his head. “That makes sense,” Harry said quietly. “Is there any other students missing?” Harry questioned and looked over at Hermione.
Harry was thinking about heading back to the dorms to try and get some sleep when the doors to the great hall opened. Curious, he peaked over his shoulder only to find Snape's standing there. His curiosity squashed; he went back to his thoughts. Unable to think about anything else other than the inevitability of everything being his fault.
Ammit hissed and rubbed his face against Harry’s cheek. Harry nodded as he walked over to the window and opened it for Bubo, Ammit’s long tail dragging a bit on the floor.
Hello All,
“Actually, we’ve known each other since fifth year. She was helping me study and everything. I’m good at potions but charms, not so much. Since McGonagall made those rules, and Hermione doesn’t really want to be around Ron for the time being, I suggested that she be my buddy,” Theodore smiled. Hermione nodded and then punched Theo in the arm.
Draco nodded as he stepped in, closing the door lightly behind him. He set the book down on a table to the side before approaching.
Harry felt his animagus form dissipate, leaving him kneeling in the snow as he looked up at the monstrous being. A full grown dragon looked down at him, eyes narrowed in irritation. It took a moment for LeFay to gather himself as he recognized the Hebridean Black looking down at him. He closed his eyes and bowed his head, letting out a sigh of relief.
Tatsuya pointed out.
The arrowhead pendant that acted as a master key to Draco’s collar felt heavy around his neck. He admitted that when he heard the collar hadn't shattered he'd felt a sense of pride but...
"Because! I wanted you to stay out of what I had to do! I couldn't put you into a dangerous situation again, I had to take responsibility for my actions that day!"
Narcissa looked down at the letter in her hands, her eyes pacing over the words again. The first time she'd read it she couldn’t believe it, and this time she was still unsure.
Flashbacks of the previous battle at Hogwarts played in Harry's mind, keeping him frozen to the spot.
Harry asked as he sat up. Ammit crawled further out from his cocoon and shook his head.
"It's better to get it out of the way now. I wanted to speak with about your choice of animal for Harry Potter. It was rather...interesting," Albus stated, though he didn't look like he was talking about it because he was curious about it. If anything he looked disappointed, maybe a bit irritated.
Draco’s eyes widened, “Severus knew this whole time?” Draco was furious.
"Draco! Stop! NO!"
The words LeFay had spoken still hung in the air between them, and Draco's thoughts lingered on them while observing Harry.
“You too. You've really changed,” Neville smiled when he spoke and Harry spotted fangs.
“Well, it seems that Gringotts has fallen a bit behind since the war and are trying to sort everything out. Narcissa also sent a letter but we haven’t gotten to that one yet,” Remus stated.
he asked his snake. Ammit shook his head, telling Harry that he was exhausted from watching over him for so long. Harry understood and lifted Ammit from his bed and into his glass tank.
The Hebridean Black lay on its side, half of its body in a small pool water and the other half sprawled out along the ground behind it. Its snout laid half submerged in the pool, a low hum emanating from it. “From how it’s laying it looks injured, or stunned at least. However, I want everyone to get their wands at the ready. An injured dragon is more likely to attack. Especially with this species of dragon, its highly aggressive already,” Charlie whispers, “Now, let’s go forward, slowly.”
"A what?" Ron asked, still holding the chicken leg he'd been eating.
More silence.
Hope blossomed in Draco's chest with the small drop of the poison called apprehension.
“Woa! That’s cool!” Harry said, picking the tag up and rolling it between his fingers.
“What do you want?”
Snape sighed and nodded. He understood what Harry was going through right now. He'd turned his head, ready to leave, when he spotted Draco, "Draco? What are you doing here?"
“I don’t expect you to stay with me, and if you want to-”
People started yelling and rushing in around him but he didn’t move.
“You’ll find out momentarily,” she spoke before motioning for him to go ahead of her. Harry sighed and headed up the steps, only to find himself in a very different room then he had been expecting. The Headmaster's room was rather bare, and no portraits of the last headmasters hung on the walls. “Now that everyone is here, we should go back over everything.”
He couldn't help but feel like the animal was staring at him.
“Lady Malfoy is waiting for you down stairs. She wishes you to be down within the next five minutes,” the house elf stated. Draco groaned but nodded and waved the house elf off. He could never remember their names, but he knew that this one was one of the few staying with them. He still couldn’t believe they were going to live with the Blacks of all people. Though, his mother did say that the Blacks where the closest thing they had to family left. With Lucius in Azkaban what else could they do? They had lost pretty much everything.
Draco didn't look at Severus but he did nod as his hand reached for the elegant collar around his neck.
Hermione rolled her eyes and sighed.
"Did you say something Lord Malfoy?" LeFay asked as he turned his attention back to the blonde standing in front of him. Draco shook his head and went to sit in a chair across from LeFay.
“What’s in this one?”
“He sent me back, told me to continue watching over you, but when I came back the next time and told him about our break he was furious. He beat me, tortured me for information, then convinced me that I could get you back if I just did what he said,” he stopped to lick his lips, before his head shot up, eyes wide. “I didn’t, I didn’t know,” he stopped, struggling to stand, “Harry, he has your family.”
Ghost leaned back away from Potter and then licked at his cheek, trying to reassure the wizard that it was okay. Harry smiled softly and then dropped his hands to his lap. Ghost watched him uneasily, shifting his weight on the bed. Harry sniffed and lifted a head to rub at one of his eyes again with his palm. "It was Cedric Diggory...At the Wizard's Cup when Voldemort killed him," Ghost's skin twitched as if he'd been hit. "He said it was my fault, my parents...Sirius almost dying they year after, Ron's dad getting attack. I think Cedric's right. It is all my fault," he whispered. Ghost seemed to notice he was on the verge of crying again as he licked Harry's cheek once more.
"I think only two of you have been up here so, welcome to my abode," Harry smiled and stretched his arms wide. There was a hoot from the owl perch and Budo looked over them with interest. Theo leaped face first onto Harry's bed with a loud oof. Shaking her head Hermione sat down on the bed, patting Theo's back. Neville and Luna climbed up onto the other side, shaking their heads.
“For the most part. Ashliegh is late, but she almost always is. Skoll and Douglas are bringing in Cadmael, I plan on questioning him with veritaserum, brewed by Severus so there shouldn’t be any wiggling his way out of it. Compulsion charms or not. Severus will also be present, but more so to deliver the rest of Cadmael’s potions. I have a feeling after this last round he’ll come to really realize what he’d done,” he paused, “Which is why I need you here.”
Harry chuckled, "Yes well. You are correct when you said I was the one that had been slipping through the cracks. Its funny how right you are about a lot of things, Draco."
Draco clung to Harry’s back, his eyes squeezed shut against the fur blowing around in his face.
Severus hung his head and nodded.
,” Harry stated.
“You do?!” he squeaked. Harry’s tails reappeared as he started to panic a little and lost his concentration. The dresser reached up for his arm when it looked like he might bolt.
Just for the sake of argument; the Hebridean Black is roughly the same size as Saphire from the Eragon book series, and about 30ft in length based of potter universe wiki entries. So maybe a bit bigger but for scaling imagination wise! Does it really matter? XD
Charlie and Bill try to help Draco with his dragoness but finds there is more to it. Harry tries to bring Draco back to his own consciousness but finds himself losing himself along the way.
"It wasn't until the prophecy that I had started to understand what was happening, I tried Severus. I tried to turn back what I did....Lily," he stopped, a look of deep regret as he looked over at Severus.
Harry sat there, grimacing through most of Severus’ scolding. It would seem no matter how he changed, Severus would always remain that same. He scowled slightly, he was frustrated, and angry, but most of what Severus had said was true. He was pushing people away, he was self sabotaging, but what else was he supposed to do. It was obvious now, based off what Severus was saying, that everything he’d seen as disgusting about himself was natural and he’d just never had the tools to deal with it. He’d never learned what he’d needed to, not like Draco or the wolf pack, or Cadmael even probably. He’d had this disgust for ‘dark’ creatures like himself pounded into him for so long, even when he was free from Albus he still hadn’t changed as much as he’d thought he had.
Harry could have sworn it looked just as surprised as Harry felt.
Next came Draco, and to his surprise Draco sported two sets of black and violet horns. The lower pair curved back and then tipped forward, while the higher pair reminded him of ram horns that curved around Draco’s newly pointed ears. His skin was also darker, clashing harshly against his pale hair. The black robe he wore dragged on the floor, covering his feet and the source of the tapping sound that followed him. He stopped at the altar and took a deep breath before lifting his gaze.
"Ghost, come here," Harry said from the bed after an hour had passed. A book was between his elbows that he used to prop up his head, intent on staying on his stomach to read rather than sitting up. Draco emerged from the bathroom, the sound of the toilet flushing. Harry's eyebrows rose as he watched the albino animal head over, it's head swinging side to side. "How?" Harry asked. Ghost looked like he shrugged before he jumped up on the bed and looked down at the book Harry had. "It's a potions book...Ron wouldn't stop bothering me long enough that I can read it, and Hermione is well...Distracting when she starts talking about other subjects. I do lots of reading when they are asleep or not around so I can keep up," he shrugged, "Sometimes I feel like they do it on purpose," Harry added at the look Ghost gave him.

Draco sucked in a shaky breath and stood up with wobbly legs. Severus was there to steady him, keeping a hand on his shoulder.
“Dragon, are you sure you want to? After all the others, I can’t stand seeing you come home again looking like that. You're going to hurt too much one of these times and... I'm worried for you,” his mother said, turning to him. She put her tea on the bench, a hollow look upon her face as she thought about all the suffering he was going through. "That collar-."
Crush me
"BLOODY HELL!" Ron exclaimed.
LeFay smirked and stepped further into the room, pulling the door closed behind him. Draco looked uneasy as he stepped back again, bumping into a dresser.
Sorry I could be so blind
Herm looked up at Theo her eyebrows coming together in confusion.
“What? I’m speaking the truth Draco.”
Harry’s grip tightened in Draco’s hair, and Draco could feel the wave of pain and worry hit him through their bond. He kept his eyes on Cadmael as the man’s eyes suddenly widened, and he could see the panic and fear start to blossom on the beastman’s face. He was shaking valiantly, looking like he was on the verge of either vomiting or passing out. Draco could feel Harry’s grip tighten even more as Harry readied himself to speak again.
“I’m still going to have a tough time really settling into this new acceptance of who I’ve become, but I hope that you’ll be willing to ride this out with me,” he sighed. Suddenly Harry fell back, the large body behind him disappearing. He let out a soft grunt as the back of his head hit the grass, and he had a hard time seeing what was above him till a shadow fell over him.
Draco didn’t know what to do with the information. Should he be angry because LeFay had just left him without knowing for sure, or sad that LeFay didn't care if it didn’t recognize him and Harry as one in the same. Biting the bottom of his lip, Draco stared at the floor, fingers still tracing the collar.
He was frozen, wide eyed, as he stood in front of the other being. Terror and that feeling of being very small overwhelming him. Everything told to run.
"He saw something that non of us could, Voldemort, or rather Tom," he stopped. "Draco, the world isn't what we thought it was. There is so much more to Harry than even Dumbledore new."
It had been hours since he passed out, and there was still no response. Because of that, both Bill and Snape had gone into the woods to search for potion ingredients. Harry had initially cursed his idiocy of thinking the collar currently around the Malfoy heir's neck was a good idea, but realized shortly there after that having a wizard Draco was better than a dragon Draco. When he looked at his sleeping partner he definitely thought he was more reasonable to deal with now.
So, this was what Harry looked like now. He looked kind of like himself, but with the giant snake Draco was instantly reminded of you-know-who. His cheek bones seemed more defined, and his eyes were slanted along with being brighter. His hair was longer and pooled on the ground around him. Harry’s face all together appeared sharper, feminine in such a way that was still masculine, mischievous almost. Draco eyes however where more drawn to the three tails fanning out around him, and the black fur coating fox legs that seemed to start around Harry’s knees. Course the shorts could have been hiding more fur under them.
As they continued down the hall Draco started to form an idea. Stopping suddenly, he then barked to get Harry's attention. Harry turned, brows lifted.
Draco snapped awake, his ears filled with the sounds of screams and sobbing. He also could feel something struggling beside him. Sitting up quickly he looked around for the source of it, ready to defend himself till he realized the source of it all and relaxed slightly. Potter was struggling against his blankets, screaming bloody murder and apparently still asleep.
Alchemy ended earlier than normal for Harry, do to one of the experiments exploding and cause volcanic glass to hit some the nearby students. Harry stood outside of the class room and cast a tempus charm to see what time it was before dispelling it with a sigh. Neville and Luna had already left, leaving him and a few of the other students waiting, some just talking. He had noticed a lot of people were looking at him, but turned back to their conversations when Harry glanced over at them. Shifting with his books he decided to go ahead and head back to their room.  It wasn’t very far after all.
“Remus and Sirius want you down stairs in twenty minutes, I thought we could go over our schedules and decide on which classes to take while waiting,” Draco tried to keep his eyes on Harry’s face and not on his chest. He heard a scoffing sound come from Harry and then watched the raven-head turn and head farther into the attic.
"No. I knew the risks of this happening. We all knew," Draco said sadly. He sniffed deeply, standing and shaking himself as he smacked his lips. Trying to re-wet his very dry mouth. "What are we going to tell the others? How are we going to explain everything?" Draco asked.
"Why such a quick summons my'Lord?" Douglas asked.
“Lord Potter, if you would,” Minerva asked politely, smiling at Harry as she got up from her seat. Harry nodded, glancing around the room a bit before he started. To his surprise both Remus and Sirius where sitting in chairs behind Charlie. He bowed his head towards them for a moment before closing his eyes.
"Nothing here has given me any reason to doubt any of you. However, I suggest all of you create copy's of your memories, along with strengthening you shields," LeFay stated, "Especially those without creature blood. If Albus is trying to wipe out everything, there is no doubt in my mind that he will use everything within his power to achieve it. Even if that means leaving him with a brain dead wizard to bury."
Severus rolled his eyes, "It doesn't matter. He's doing well, and you need to rest still. Ghost made it through all of this because you two share cores now. If you don't get enough rest he won't get better as fast," he smoothed out his robes and straightened himself. "Now, I have other matter's to attend to and a lot to talk about. There's food and water to your left," he said, and then patted the bed. "Make sure you stay in bed." With a quick turn Snape made his way out of the room, closing the door behind him with a soft click. Sighing he turned to look at the distraught blonde sitting on the ground.
Draco hits a bit of a snag in his plans, he never thought he'd actually find being around Harry Potter pleasant.
“Oh, I’m about to make your life so much better in so many ways,” Skoll stated with a wide devilish smile.
Everyone's attention turned to the side door where a dark shadow appeared. It moved slowly towards them, a small sigh of disappointment coming from as they entered the lighting of the room.
“He called me his golden boy when he apologized just now, only Albus calls me that. Hati, Cadmael, never called me that,” LeFay shouted over his shoulder as he made his way through the great hall’s doors.
“Well, I’ll go get ready then,” Harry giggled. They smiled at him for a moment before going back to bickering as he headed back up to his room. Harry sat down on his bed with a light laugh and then went to push up his glasses when he realized he didn’t have them on.
it hissed. Bill started helping Remus to his feet, taking the distraction as a good chance to regroup.
"You think?" Neville squeaked. Draco growled louder, snapping his jaws near Neville's face and took a step closer, causing the young wizard to press himself against the wall. Draco was having
That's when he saw it, standing in the corner of the room behind him. He turned to look, but when he did it wasn’t there, so he looked back into the mirror.
"What's the problem Ghost? We can't be late."
“I was just a kid!”
Ammit paused and wrinkled his green and copper snake nose at him. ‘
“No, it sounds like snake language but different. Mostly I think it was just angry hissing.”
'I want to know the real you' Harry snorted. Cocky kid. No, they weren't kids anymore, and that was part of the problem.
The man looked at it curiously as he pulled it off the wall and set it on the counter. “Curious,” he said.
What was he going to do about Draco?
"I was actually wondering quite the same thing," added William, "It isn't like you."
LeFay looked down at his clothes, frowning slightly before dusting off his pants.
“I’m guessing you saw the cord as well,” Charlie said as he put the shard in his satchel.
"Without Ammit Lord LeFay will have nothing to center and ground his magic, his nature is so purely chaotic he needs someone there to ground him," August stated, "Its bullshit but LeFay has chosen you to take his familiars place. I doubt you'll have a choice in it even if you wanted to," he finished as he gestured at the collar securely around Draco's neck.
Draco groaned, “It would explain why he seemed to give up on finding you.”
Sirius didn’t respond at all to the accusation of his son; his face pale, as Hermione pushed her way forward. Before Hermione could say more Sirius put his hand out and squeezed her shoulder.
Let me feel as hurt as you
Draco bit his lip, looking like he was about to give up.
“Still unresponsive,” Harry muttered.
In the forest, a giant sleeps. He is unwelcome in this unfamiliar world and can't remember where he is.
A hand feel onto Harry's shoulder, and he heard a hiss of pain as the hand was removed. "Tell everyone that I will be indisposed for the remainder of the night," LeFay stated quietly, his eyes darting to the double doors were Draco stood, his face pale. August nodded his head as he rubbed his hand, looking down at the acid burn he'd received just from touching his Lord in his current state.

"Hmm, oh. That," he looked down at his arm and rubbed the bandage, smirking slightly. "Fine. I can now say that I've been bitten by an African beast though," he chuckled. There was a pause of silence as Tom inhaled, staring down at Harrison. "I'm guessing that Lucius has filled you in?" Draco nodded. "How are you doing? It wasn't just Harry that we'd lost there for a bit." Tom turned his gaze to Draco as he spoke.
LeFay looked up at the dragon, eyes comically widening. “But even as kitsune, he’s huge!” LeFay spoke, mouth feeling funny as he tried to talk, he wasn’t used to trying to speak in this form. Magic made most of it work so it felt odd.

“I’m coming,” Harry stated as he got up out of bed, running a hand though his hair to smooth it out. He hesitated in front of the mirror when he realized he only had his kilt on before rolling his eyes at himself. It was probably just Remus telling him that supper was ready. He yawned and squeezed his eyes shut as he opened the door, only to stand frozen, surprised by who stood on the other side. “Draco?”
Draco shook his head, "Did what?" he asked as he finished pouring his drink and putting the jug away. He sipped it a bit before sitting down.
Harry shrugged then and glanced down at the floor.
Tatsuya pointed out without hesitation. LeFay growled quietly and leaned back in his seat. He had told Draco quite a bit already...
Draco wasn't aware of where he went. He just wanted space to breathe. Needed it. He didn't realize how far he had actually gone till the snow was up to his waist, and he honestly didn't even remember it being this deep.
"Harry-."
“Harry, Draco hasn’t been seen since the dragon attacked the school, neither has Parvati. Dean and Seamus are both in critical care. Along with some other students it stumbled into on its way out,” Hermione explained. Harry’s eyes widened. A dragon? He had flash backs of fourth year and the tournament before shaking his head.
Severus nodded sadly, looking down at his Godson who seemed to be nearing the end of his mental break.
He felt his heart start pounding as a streak of black disappeared deeper into the forest. Terror of the unknown and the rumor of vampires kept him frozen to the spot for a moment. He shook it off and took of his rob, transfiguring it into a thick coat before starting toward the forest. Something about the blur drew him in, even with the knowledge he was going in blind, something screamed at him to go forward.
“This will only take a few moments,” Ulkalb said as he noticed Harry and Ghost cuddling up on one of the chairs, “I’m sure your charge is drained,” he added, addressing the four adults in the room. They nodded and then sat around the table, fixing accounts that needed to be rearranged as well as planning their next move with the goblins. The goblins had enough push with the rest of the wizarding world that Lucius was happy to use their help in the lawsuits and criminal actions they were about to file on both Albus and the British Wizengamot.
Harry stared at the wooden floor as he yawned and passed his hand over his frill of a mane he called his hair. It had grown much longer since the end of the war and came down to his shoulders now. The length had smoothed out the tufts but it was still as unruly as ever. When he finally climbed out of bed he fished out some new clothes from a box he'd never quite ‘completely’ unpacked before heading down the attic stairs. he turned with a small bound towards the kitchen even though dark circles still hung around his eyes. Once he got there all he could really do was pick at his food, yawning as he did.
"You-know-who is after you Potter, what do you expect?"
I am the voice of the past that will always be
Albus has made his first move. What will happen next and how will Harry respond?
LeFay sipped from his chalice and set it on the arm of his throne. This was a dilemma.
Draco paused in his train of thought, his wings shifting in a wordless sign that he was listening.
“Harry?” Bill said softly. The Kitsune’s ears flicked before it shook its head and returning to its normal position, stopping a few feet from them. The glowing they hadn't noticed faded from Harry’s eyes.
"I am fine my beloved, I do not require immediate attention. Care for your son, please," he stated, motioning to Draco's animagus form. She nodded and then moved to Lucius side, helping him lift the heavy body. They moved out of the room, leaving Severus and Voldemort by themselves.
“Well, guess we should get this started,” Sirius stated, nodding at Dragoon. Sirius stepped into the middle of the room as he was instructed to cut his palm and let it drip onto the runes below. The blood flowed and pooled in the runes just as gold and red swirling lights formed around Sirius. A large family tree faded into existence along the wall, making both Harry and Lupin gawk. A long scroll of parchment then appeared in Dragoon’s hands and he smiled as Sirius stepped over to the family tree. “Could I get a copy of this?” he asked Dragoon as his hands explored the new wall engraving. The goblin simply nodded with a toothy grin.
“They shouldn’t have to!” LeFay half shouted angrily, “A monster is a monster!”
"The potion is doing its job. Just hang in there," Severus said.
“And if he ends up disgusted by the real me, the real Harry?” LeFay snorted, "It would be a disaster. No."
he said. Harry obeyed, lighting the incense-like stick of lavender.
"How did this happen," the cold tone made him look up into his master's face. Voldemort stood over him silently, expecting an answer.
"But do you accept it, this is what I am Draco. Can you accept it, can you accept me?" LeFay asked, his eyes glazing over Draco's face.
LeFay sucked in a breath, not liking the tone Severus was using.
Severus comes up with a plan to protect both Draco and Harry in one go, but it will be painful for at least one of them.
Draco didn’t know how long he'd been out, but the fire was long cold by the time he woke. Something moved to his left, his hand reflexively going to his wand.
The group crouched in the bushes ready to move but Snape seemed stuck. His eyes pacing the ex-Death Eaters, and his face paler than normal.
"Oh yes, yes. Good day, Lord Malfoy," Skoll bowed again, followed by Hati before they left.
"So how are you yourself now My'Lord?" Severus interrupted.
“Who was that anyways?” Draco asked out of curiosity. Harry shrugged in reply and popped another slice into his mouth, crunching happily for a moment.
Harry frowned down at the animal and tugged on the animal's ear. Ghost apparently wasn't pleased as he swung his head around and snapped at Harry's hand.
Harry finished spinning and sighed, giving up on trying to see his tails and sat down. Remus came back into the room and then sat down beside Sirius with an exhausted sigh.
“Hello?” came a soft voice from inside.
"I take that as you forgiving me?" LeFay chuckled. Draco snorted, pushing against him. He laughed a bit harder smiled, "Let's head back then. Get some tea and warm up?"
"Now Draco, stay calm, he isn't-."
Tatsuya asked. Harry nodded sharply, this was the first he had felt of Tatsuya since yesterday, and he most definitely wanted help.
“Why what?” LeFay asked as he conjured a wine glass for himself. He didn’t seem to care about using wandless, or wordless magic in front of Draco.
"Why would it be a problem sir?" Harry asked. "Yea, he is a bit harsh when you first stuck me with him, but over the day and last night. Well, he's helped me a lot already I think," he paused and reached down to pat Ghost's neck. The animal seemed surprised. "i think we'll be great partners."
"Potter, do you know the implications-." He was cut off by the fiery and determination in Harry's eyes.
The first thing Harry heard when he stepped out of the floo was a very angry Remus yelling at the other end of the Manor. Sirius was already gone from the sitting room, so Harry guessed that Sirius had already gone to try and remedy the situation. Harry shook his head in amusement before turning down the hall and making his way to the attic. That was until a very flustered Draco Malfoy stormed out of a room and straight into Harry Potter.
“In a way, yes. I-I was suggested to visit a mind healer, but with Tatsuya’s presence,” LeFay trailed off.
Someone knelt beside Draco and placed a hand on his shoulder.
“It has a bit of a Choranaptyxis ability to it. I’m not sure what magical creature they used, but the collar is able to shift sizes depending on the animal it’s used on,” he explained.
“I mean no. That is not what I wish,” Draco lifted his gaze to LeFay and his face showed determination. “If you, Lord LeFay, would allow me to stay; I would like to get to know the real you.”
Draco checks Albus' grave. When he reports back he has to deal with a Forest Kistune tantrum.
LeFay felt a spark in his chest, one Tatsuya felt also, as he looked at Draco. Feeling the sudden stirring of long-forgotten emotions. Tatsuya was right though, Draco hadn't changed much. Even his appearance didn't seem all that different.
Ammit stated, his tone was like death as he spoke, making Harry shiver as the hair on the back of his neck stood up.
“Yea. Since I work here all the time I’m already use to how you smell, and I’ve run into a Kitsune before," she half shrugged, "I don’t really remember how it happened because I was young, but the scent I remembered. So… I pieced two and two together.”
Draco's eyes were glued to the man across from him.
“Ahh, someone who actually knows our customs,” chuckled Hisashi, “Much more impressive than when we met LeFay. The young kit almost lost his life the first time we met,” the white fox said wistfully.
LeFay snorted. “I have to say, the Wizengamot is, or rather was, full of idiots. If they knew the truth well,” he smiled, “I basically run it now.”
Soon the group came around the ex-Death Eaters. Spells fired off from either side of the fight, causing Draco to flinch when a stray spell passed over his head.
"Did I mention that you're huge now?" LeFay asked as he grunted, swinging himself up near Draco's shoulder blades.
Jariss grumbled in the back of Draco's mind as the wizard continued forward, finally stopping in a clearing that had little snow. It must have been protected form the wind by the large trees around it.
"I knew you would," he said, "I want to know. When you see him, when you see Tatsuya-."
“I don’t understand,” she said softly. Theo looked down at her with a sad smile, shaking his head before hugging her tighter.
The man watched him, eyes narrowing in on Draco. Draco felt his blood run cold as he stared at the man, swallowing.
“Thanks Hermione,” he turned and left, leaving the four behind.
Harry came to a stop, the look on the boys face worried him. He looked disgusted, fearful almost. Quickly he reached a hand to his face to try feeling what the boy was looking at and remembered how his skin felt. How it must look. Quickly he turned away from the boy, his lips pursing together. "Go away!" he sobbed, arms reaching around his shoulders. He couldn't bare that gaze.
Harry's face went red as he licked his lips and spoke,"Come on Ghost."
Harry asked with narrowed eyes. Ammit looked at him, puzzled.
“Very.”
And someone will love you
"Had you."
Tatsuya asked.
Harry cleared his throat to try and get rid of the dark mood that hung over their heads.
“He’s male! And a juvenile, right?!” Harry hollered back over the tail blockade.
Streaks of dirt replaced the tears he wiped away, glancing at the place Harry once stood. He could still feel the power radiating through him from the blast; and that creature...
LeFay felt a strong sense of pride when Draco spoke, but also guilt. Bowing low Draco turned and then left the room quickly, leaving LeFay to his thoughts. Sitting down he lifted a hand to his face, rubbing his forehead. If only Draco knew what he actually thought..."He's proved himself worthy many times over," he mumbled under his breath with a sigh.
“No, not Draco. I want to apologize to you,” LeFay said firmly.
"If it saves Harry's life?" Lucius questioned. This was new to him as well.
Tom shook his head and lifted his hand. "Please leave Severus," he said quietly. Severus bowed his head and left.
“Now Draco, we talked about this before we even came here. Plans have just changed, you two sharing the room will work better than you by yourself. That way if anything does happen you'll each have the other’s back. Am I understood?” Narcissa stated, glaring till Draco nodded.
Severus snapped back around to face LeFay, furious. He shoved Harry back against the wall, watching the Lord bounce against it without phasing him, "I swear if you don't go after him. If you break his heart again," Severus snapped, grabbing the front of LeFay's robes, "I won't care if it kills me to put you in the same misery you put him through everyday," he snarled.
Harry and Draco sat slightly apart from most of the other students in the great hall, and as he was observing, Draco noticed that most of the other students were paired in threes or twos. Some of them he recognized, but only three of them stood out. Two because they were friends of Harry’s; Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, the third being Theodore Nott.
“Sirius, is it okay if we talk about my inheritance today? I know we didn’t actually go over everything I got since I was out for so long,” Harry asked. Sirius nodded then and let Harry into the drawing room.
Ammit flicked his tongue as he finished. Harry’s ears pricked forward, curious about the last one.
“Yes, indeed I am awake. Now can you explain to me why you let one Harry fucking Potter put this around my neck?” Draco spat, motioning to the black metal and amethyst covered collar. Snape winced and then cleared his throat, his face becoming an emotionless mask.
“We’ll see about that,” Draco said.
Harry smiled at Sirius as he got up from his seat and headed over, turning Harry around by the shoulders and ushered him into the front room. “I think Remus is a bit agitated with my choice of clothing articles,” Harry stated as he reached for a jacket. Sirius laughed as he grabbed his own and nodded.
“The collar. It creates a master servant relationship,” Draco spat out.
Ammit nodded his head and then slid onto the bed from Harry’s shoulders, curling up in the warm side of the bed where Harry had been sleeping. ‘
Draco rolled his shoulders, trying to relax. Telling himself this man wouldn't have been here if Harry, LeFay, didn't think he was worthy. At least that's what he told himself.
“It’s from Narcissa,” he answered. Remus looked puzzled, What would a Malfoy want with one Harry Potter? Remus asked himself.
Sirius and Remus where basically bouncing in their seats before McGonagall nodded in their direction. Both stood up and walked over, almost jogging before stopping right in front of Harry. “Harry! I thought you said you were only the size of a pony!” Sirius stated, thinking back on the fire call they had last night.
“I believe Mister Malfoy is treating Harry as a hatchling, or hatchling like,” Charlie stated, pointing out the dragon’s posture along with the fact he had just blocked Harry’s path. Harry couldn’t hear their conversation, and wasn’t all too happy about the tail in his way. Growling he started pushing at the tail, trying to move it, only to have something grab the back of his shirt and lift off the ground. Harry crossed his arms, scowling as he was dropped in front of the Hebridean Black. Draco stared at him before dropping his head down to Harry’s level and snorting.
As everyone finished getting ready for bed Harry walked back to his bed to see Ghost sitting there on the bed with a triumphant look on his face. "What did you do now?" Harry asked Ghost. Between Ghost's paws was a shred of clothing, and by the looks of it, it probably belonged to one of the wizards. Turning to look at the others in the room he noticed all eyes where on Ghost, only Seamus seemed to be missing. Harry walked over to Seamus' bed then and pulled back the curtains to see a completely passed out Seamus with his pants ripped and pee completely surrounding him on the bed. Harry gagged and stumbled back. "Ghost!" he half wheezed, half yelled, "Bad dog cat thingy!"
Draco could tell Harry was in the middle of talking to his other half, so he took the opportunity to stand and stretch. He glanced around the room, taking in the decor of the place. Glancing behind him he watched LeFay's eyes close while nodding his head. Every once in the while he made a noise, but didn't do much else. It must be pretty in depth.
There was low whispering and something scrapping across the ground but nothing came towards him. Slowly Draco stood, squinting into the darkness.
Had planned to write more for this chapter, but I wanted to give it to you guys faster so here it is!
she paused,
Draco grabbed his two suite cases and shrunk them before slipping them into his pocket. Then he held out his arm, “Come on Bubo.”
“When the Auroras land that’s when we strike,” Snape whispered. There was no way the three of them could take on the group of twenty.
Draco placed a silk bookmark in between the pages he had been reading and stood. He decided to take it with him before heading down the hall. It didn't take him long and as he opened the door he heard LeFay speak.
“Draco! You're awake! Sev-Snape was worried when you didn’t wake up, even after administering the potion,” Harry’s voice caught in his throat. Draco smiled, unsure of what exactly had happened. He reached a hand up to rub the back of his neck only to encounter metal. Frowning he sat up and reached both of his hands up around his neck, feeling the metal collar the group had put on him last night.
"Yes Ron. It's better to know then not to know. Now Harry, did Professor Snape or Dumbledore tell you anything else other than him becoming your familiar?" Hermione asked, still trying to figure out the puzzle.
Ne'er do I sleep throughout all the cold winter long
Charlie didn’t look happy but snapped his mouth shut.
“Damn it,” he muttered as he dodged out of the way of another spell, hearing it slam behind him against a pillar and crumbling it in seconds. Draco took the opportunity to throw up a masking spell, creating a dust cloud around him that he used for cover. He could hear Cadmael swear as the beastman tried to wipe the dirt out of his eyes.
Cadmael laughed, “That's pretty rich coming from you, you just dropped him as soon as you started getting feelings for him. You let some worthless wizard’s spell take your mind from you and completely forgot about him. Went off gallivanting and causing havoc elsewhere because you lost your mind to your primal half! LeFay told me everything, you even tried to kill him multiple times! Refused your feelings for him because you let measly wizards control your every move. You disgust me!” Cadmael shouted back into the dust cloud, using his free arm to hold some of the wound closed along his side.
Harry sat straight up, panic setting in. "Malfoy Manor!?" he all but screamed. He went to whip the blankets off himself but Severus' hand grabbed his.
“H-Harry.”
LeFay could feel the wind tugging at his fur as they slowed their pace. Damn it, how far did that git go?
Draco spun around, wand out.
Snape’s shape morphed as he ran till a little black fox tailed the other two. Harry and Draco exchanged a look before Harry shrugged, morphing into his own form. When Harry opened his eyes he turned his head to look at Draco, noticing how the pale boy's mouth was hanging open as he stared at him. Draco didn’t have enough time to take it all in though as the Kistune form head butted him. Draco hurriedly climbed onto Harry’s back and grabbed hold of the neck fur.
Harry was surprised. This woman had met another Kitsune? Too bad she didn’t remember or he would have asked her questions about the experience.  “My name is Kristian by the way, Kristian Walters. Since we’ve gotten that out of the way. Do you trust me enough to take the glamours off so I can see what I’m really working with?” she asked and raised her brow. Harry nodded and the glamours faded as he took of his jacket and threw it into the corner.
At first, Sirius read silently; starting to read aloud when he noticed the importance of the letter.
Severus gathered his stuff and then headed over to talk to Narcissa, Harry watching all the while. He couldn’t catch what they were saying but it seemed important. He didn't have time to try reading their lips as both Remus and Sirius headed to the door, dragging him along.
Tatsuya commented,
Draco was no way prepared for what came next as Harry broke down sobbing and threw his arms around Draco's furry shoulders and burred his face into Draco's chest fur. Draco froze, not knowing what else to do. After a moment passed he slowly let his head rest over Harry's shoulder and his back, a low whine emanating from him.
Draco made sure to keep an eye out for any movement, especially black blurs that could be the person he was looking for. He rubbed his arms to try and get warmer before tucking his hands under his arm pits. Hopefully he could keep them from getting frostbitten without gloves. He'd started to lose hope when he smelled a fire close by, smirking a bit he made his way forward till he stumbled upon a small cabin. It looked run down. Possibly abandoned, if not for the smoke stack coming from its chimney. Something about the cabin looked familiar and he reached into his coat pocket to check. Holding up the picture beside the cabin he recognized it as the rumored vampire hive. He gritted his teeth and started forward, taking his chances that these vampires were friendly rather than freezing to death in the snow. He stomped the snow off his boots onto the porch, trying to peek into the window before knocking. It occurred to him, that if there was vampires, they surely wouldn't need a fire going. Unless it was more than just a few vampires living here.
,” the snake sounded surprised for a moment before its eyes turned sad. “
"Take it slow. You're at Malfoy Manor. What do you remember last?"
"Where else would I be?" he asked, eyes opening. He stared into the black sky as two large eyes looked back down at him. The eyes blinked at him and he heard faintly someone calling his name.
“Maybe that’s why it doesn’t have an author, or even a title for that matter." He sat back in the love seat and stared into the fire for a while before he turned his attention back to Potter.
LeFay sat down with the book and started flipping through its pages slowly, letting his eyes skim over ever word.
Silverhood
“Draco!” Narcissa was shocked by his outburst.
Tatsuya laughed and nodded his head, causing a bit of moss to fall from his antlers.
"DRACO!" Harry yelled, as he kept running, the eyes following him.
“Everyone, please report to the Great Hall for an announcement. Those in the infirmary, please remain there. Someone will tell you what happened afterwards. Thank you.” McGonagall’s voice faded from the coms as they got up from their seats.
The Nagas yelled. It threw Sirius to the side, slamming him against a rock. The Grim yelped and then went still.
Draco yawned. “Nothing you’re probably interested in.”
Ammit hissed angrily as he got into striking position. Ammit was positioned half on top of Harry and half curled around him protectively. Harry on the other hand was just able to see Draco before Ammit lunged.
“Potter!” he half yelled, half croaked. Harry turned around to face him.
Hermione elbowed Ron in the ribs, "Ron!" she hissed.
Malfoy shook himself from his stupor, and smirked slightly as he regained his confidence. Ignoring the statement Malfoy crossed his arms, “It was rather hard to find you. Six years to be exact." The smirk on his face didn’t even falter as one of the men in the room inhumanly growled.
Then save me, save me
Draco asked, fear starting to creep its way in as he remembered exactly what he'd done the last time he'd woken.
"Seems Narcissa and Lucius have gone out shopping," he said with a small sneer.
Snape sighed, nodding slowly and then got his collapsible cauldron out to start brewing.
"You-you mean to tell me that, you think we," he stopped, gasping for breath as he continued laughing. Draco growled and stood up, slamming his hand down on Harry-Lefay's desk.
Thinking about it now, it still amused Potter. The culprit now however was the letter that lay by Harry on the bed. Draco continued to pace as Harry picked up the letter and read it over again. It was a threat, simply put.
The Naga spoke mid leap at Harry. It landed short of Harry and then rolled up around Harry, staring down at him.
“Also," Black spoke up quietly, bowing his head, "I was wanting to inquire about the Black’s Vaults." The goblin's eyebrows rose.
“You still need to recover from that blast you took,” Remus chimed. Harry shook his head.
“Even when it forces them to their knees?” Harry questioned quietly.
“So it is true, you’re a Kitsune!”
he chuckled,
Over the past six years he had been able to make a new name for the Malfoys; claiming his rightful place as Lord along with moving back into Malfoy manor with his mother. Sirius and Remus came over to visit often with their son Teddy, as well as Snape when he was in a good mood. When he stepped into the room he found Narcissa talking to a very excited looking Sirius and Remus while Teddy was playing with blocks on the floor. Snape sat in a seat not too far away, shaking his head.
Charlie was running toward them now along with Bill and Severus. “Potter, watch out!” Severus yelled as the dragon’s tail came up behind him and almost squashed him. Harry barely dodged out of the way, his springy legs carrying him quickly to the side. Glancing between the three men as they stopped near Draco, Harry couldn’t understand what was going on. Draco lifted one long clawed foot to his face, looking like he was trying to remove something from it. Charlie was withdrawing a syringe of some kind and Harry felt the sudden urge to attack the group as they ran toward Draco, trying to help.
"You're the Harry that thought about my room when I went to stay at Black Manor. You're the one that slipped through the cracks of Albus' plots, and every time fought against him while he tried to squeeze you back in his mold. You're the one that achieved your animagus form in two days... The one that came for me," he paused, "Or am I wrong?"
“I want everyone ready to move in two days,” Harry growled, eyes flashing around the room.
A sudden wave of magic and pleasure hit both of them as the last strand of magic snapped into place, leaving both exhausted and lying in a heap after what had just occurred. Moonlight streamed in around them and Draco was suddenly aware of the grass underneath his back and the sweet smell of the flowers filled his nose. LeFay was crumpled against his chest, panting lightly, while resting his eyes. When he glanced up he was met with brilliant violet eyes brimming with emotion. Harry smiled sweetly before leaning up to kiss Draco.
"Thank you," Severus said softly as he sliced Harry's palm, spilling the blood into Draco's within the bowl.
too much fun with this.
“He-he wouldn’t. T-that’s not Harry,” she whispered.
Harry found himself responding without thinking, "Well how am I suppose to know."
"I'm sorry Draco," Severus said as he knelt down to his godson's level. Draco shook his head, wiping at his eyes furiously.
Draco laid there, suddenly very aware of just who he was talking to. 'This isn't Potter' he reminded himself. "Not really, its actually kind of hot," he stated, licking his lips. LeFay's smirk removed as he turned away, waving his hand.
Draco asked, confused.
the kitsune stated. Harry chuckled lightly as he set his wand on the ground and started petting Ammit’s head. He closed his eyes, hoping that if he meditated now he might be able to see his kitsune.
LeFay frowned, his nails digging into his arms. “I need you to check Albus’ grave and report to me about what you find.”
“Later Theo,” Draco said with a smirk before pushing Harry ahead of him.
Once they got to Severus' quarters he motioned for Harry to take a seat. Tea already sat ready for them as they made themselves comfortable. Severus flicked his wand, causing Harry to shiver as he felt wards fall into place. Something felt off as he noticed one of the charms falling around the room was a silencing charm.
“How does it look?” Harry asked as his cheeks turned pink and he crossed his arms over his chest.
Harry turned back to his friends, smiling slightly.
“The fact it hasn’t broken explains a lot. Sudden mood swings, random floods and droughts of my magic.” LeFay’s voice was softer than it'd been throughout the whole conversation, “You seem very fond of it,” he noted.
“What is it?” Draco asked.
When Ghost didn't move Snape pushed the animal with his foot. It made a noise Harry had never heard before, almost like a squirrel chattering in a tree, and then started following Harry out of the hall.
Draco looked disappointed for a moment before he wrapped his arms around Harry and brought him into a tight hug. “I know you do,” he said softly. They both stood there in silence for a good moment, Harry’s face burrowed into Draco’s neck.
"No, he needs to see this," LeFay said, eyes focused on the carving. "Take him to the maze shortly, I have to prepare," he whispered. August nodded and turned, taking Draco by the arm and leading him away as LeFay picked up Ammit into his arms. Tears started to fall, scorching the ground with pure magic as he made his way outside.
Harry bit his lip before asking if he could hold the snake. The man nodded and opened the cage, picking him up and handing him to Harry. “You have to be careful though, he’s pretty big. Around eight feet I think,” he told Harry as the snake wound around his shoulders. For as big as the snake was it didn’t end up feeling as heavy as Harry thought it would.
“Narcissa, Draco. Please have a seat,” Remus stated as he filled two cups with tea. Narcissa smiled tensely and sat, motioning Draco to do the same. He sneered before sitting and crossing his leg over his lap, refusing to look at Remus and choosing to stare off into the shelves of books instead. Remus chuckled and handed Narcissa a cup before leaning on the large desk in the room. “I hope the packing wasn’t too stressful. I can understand how it feels to uplift all your roots and move somewhere entirely different,” he kept his tone neutral as he spoke, sipping his tea.
“I might, if he lets me…,” he paused. Bill frowned at Charlie who simply shrugged before Harry started gingerly making his way over to Draco, smiling slightly. When he finally stood before the black dragon its head turned to look at him. “Hey…um…I’m just going to pull the other spears out,” Harry stated, pointing at the spears and making a tugging motion.  The dragon seemed to regard him with interest before lowering his head to the ground and huffing. Harry stepped around Draco's head to his hind quarts and stepped up to the first spear. He looked back at the dragon, watching the big violet eyes blink slowly at him. Harry took that as a sign and grabbed the first spear with both hands, tugging hard.
Harry was confused. “Rings?” he asked as he glanced over both he's father's faces. Only to be handed a box instead of answers.
he stated, staring at Harry. There was another light huff, causing Harry to stand up from his bed and looked around frantically. Ammit watched him, starting to worry.
“Duel!”
Draco sat in the library, his eyes glancing over the words in front of him. Despite everything he was actually able to stay focused on the book, not knowing how much time passed until a house elf appeared.
He had heard from Hermione how bad the creatures where treated in the wizarding community, especially under the Ministries’ rule, but he didn’t think it had gotten to where they were not getting the jobs they needed. He’d been so focused on the war and Voldemort he never really thought about the state of the wizarding world. How much didn't he know about it? Maybe he should talk to Hermione when he got back to school about what books he should be reading. She always seemed to be more informed than him. He had read a lot on the wizard bloodlines and etiquette from the Black library because Sirius thought he was highly ill mannered when it came to high-blood society, but he hadn’t thought about anything else. How was he so stupid? Harry frowned and started to play with the fur on his legs as he continued his debate with himself.
Dark red eyes finally left his as the man headed towards the kitchen. He let out the breath he'd been holding and maneuvered himself so he could half face the strangers while sitting down beside the fire. The heat felt nice as he realized how tired he was, taking the moment to lean against the wall and rest his eyes.
“Yes… Though we’d rather not like to share it. Why are you telling us about Harr- Lord LeFay’s?” Narcissa questioned. She was puzzled, most people tried to keep their inheritances a secret for as long as possible, though she knew some that would out right flaunt it. However, the few that did where sometimes shunned for the fact they were part something else. Especially with the strict magical creature laws placed by the Ministry.
“Careful, we don’t want you breaking your neck now,” Sirius smirked playfully as he took up walking beside Harry to keep an eye on him. It took him a bit, but Harry finally got the hang of balancing on his toes. He went to sit down on one of the love seats only to have Remus yell at him about being careful with his hind end. It was late however and vase fell  none the less. Causing Harry to spin around quickly to figure out how it had fallen, causing yet another item to fall and break. Sirius busted out laughing as he sat down, his arms crossing over his torso and leaving Remus scowled at their son.
“What happened after that?” Harry asked.
Lucius frowned, "He's stable, but hasn't woken." Draco cursed, pulling the blankets tighter around his arms. "I'm sorry, but we don't know that much about anima reddetur votum. Soul bonding has been lost to the sands of time, I'm not even sure how Harry knew about it."
Ammit stated, Harry scoffed at him.
The group progressed slowly, their eyes flicking back and forth across the trail. Charlie crouched behind a large rock at the curve of the trail and motioned for everyone to get down. Charlie motioned them forward just a bit so they could see around the rock the crouched behind.
Draco understood though. He understood full well what Sirius was hinting to. This was the real unbound Harry LeFay. The real man he would have known if Harry's inheritance wasn't locked away for so many years.
"Anima reddetur votum, you promised Harry," Draco demanded, stomping his foot.
Harry stiffened in the middle of putting his own class list away. “No,” his voice was hallow and Draco noticed that the intense gaze Harry had faded.
Remus stared at her, “Where did you hear that from?”
“LEFAY!” he shouted, stumbling before catching himself and continuing to run. There was a tingling along his neck and the collar grew warm as Draco fell forward, rolling down the hill into a large pile of leaves.
Tatsuya laughed in Harry’s head. Harry rolled his eyes. It was no time for jokes, they needed to get back to Hogwarts!
“What’s the ‘something special’?” Regulus asked sternly.
“Luna, Neville. You two are looking great,” Harry said excitedly, “And Neville, smokes! You really filled in!”
Tatsuya said quietly as he stretched in Harry’s mind. Harry smirked a little before closing his eyes, letting the feeling of Tatsuya wash over him. He could feel the muscles bunching and stretching. The way his ears and tails moved. The way his head felt with the heavy set of antlers. Harry opened his eyes slowly, finding his point of view shifted. He tried to take a step, only to fall forward with the unexpected weight on his head. Shaking his head, he blinked, only to find that his friends where staring at him. Looking down he looked at his paws, which sported black fur and devilishly long claws that where tinted green. He turned to face his mirror and tilted his head.
If only she knew the real Harry.
"Do I know you?" Draco asked, the man seemed familiar. Golden eyes, shaggy dark locks that came down to his chin, a pale face full of freckles, "Oh, I recognize you now. You where in the hall when I arrived," Draco mumbled.
Tom chuckled, "It's okay. I know it will take time to get used to." He pulled a chair from the side of the room and placed it next to Draco's, sitting down slowly.
excuse the shortness
Draco stood there for the next ten minutes in the dark before finally giving in to the fact Harry wasn’t going to put on any more clothes.
Horns- Bryce Fox
"Sorry Ghost," Harry said, startling Ghost enough that he jumped. Harry stopped and leaned against the wall, smiling sadly. Ghost's ears flicked back and he turned his body to face Harry, tilting his head. "Herm and Ginny have gotten close since I broke up with Ginny, and it's," he trailed off, biting his lip. Ghost bumped his hand with his nose and then lightly grabbed it with his mouth before starting to pull on it. Harry actually smiled then and shook his head. "You probably don't care, your just wanting to eat," Harry chuckled. Ghost let go of Harry's hand then and bounded off a short ways, his mane bristled and tail wagging. Harry laughed rather loudly then and started jogging after the bounding albino striped hyena.
"What an astute observation Potter."
“I might actually want to read that series. It looked interesting,” LeFay stated as he started for the door.
Long over do, sorry guys. Also, very much a warning on nudity and violence and shit.
he added.
“To make sure he is really dead.” LeFay’s eyes didn’t leave the students below them now. He knew it was an odd request but he needed to make sure. If he wasn’t back somehow then that would mean Albus had something planned after his death for if LeFay took back his own control. After sitting backseat to his own life, he didn’t want anything in the way of this new one.
'Fine!' LeFay snapped, handing over the "reins" so to say as Tatsuya took over LeFay's body movements. Without pause the dark kitsune sped up, bounding through the snow with ease compared to the dragging walk LeFay been doing. 'Don't waste all our energy!" LeFay snapped.
Severus watched, both in awe, and secrete terror as the man before him melted into an elegant fox-like creature. He'd forgotten just how much the monster had taken over the man.
Harry swallowed, part of him wanted to look away and lie, but he couldn’t. This was the first real step in the right direction for their relationship and he had to be honest. “Yes,” Harry said, biting his lip just a bit, “But, I love you too.”
Draco turned in his seat, rubbing his eyes. "Lord Vol- I mean Tom," he said, yawning slightly.
Harry nodded his head and then slowly stood up, carrying his heavy familiar with him. He set Ammit in his tank as Harry went to start changing. “Why are you telling me to save it for tomorrow?” Harry asked as he started stripping. He heard the Kitsune moving again, seeming like it was getting comfortable while Harry was starting his bed routine.
Draco gritted his teeth, pulling his wand out to get ready, “I don’t know what happened between you too, but Harry and I have always had a connection. Even before he was able to make contact with his inheritance, we may have been enemies then but we were still connected, and I won’t let you ruin what we’ve built since then,” Draco growled. He could feel Jariss’s presence against the sides of his mind as the dragon coiled, and lifted his scales in a fighting position. Dragons wings lifted and fanned out around him, making him appear far larger then he currently was.
“Harry? Are you okay?” he asked.
Draco was swallowed down tears, eyes fixed on LeFay for a moment before turning sharply.
"Lord Malfoy?"
Hermione called again for the third time, "Harry!"
“Do you really think that something so big, so powerful, would just offer itself up on a platter if it didn’t want to?” Hisashi scolded, “We are creatures, animals, not constructs made by society. If he really didn’t like submitting to you, he wouldn’t. Dig deeper, dig deeper and you will understand the truth.”
Draco glared down at the lean man before him, scoffing at what he said. They both knew LeFay could have handled it without him if he hadn't been worried about hurting the werewolves.
"I could ask you the same," Ginny fired back. Draco could taste the tension in the room as Harry and Ginny exchanged what looked like menacing glares. Draco had known the two broke up earlier that week but no one had known why.
Draco took another sip of his tea and shivered, his dragon blood wasn't use to being active in this weather. He'd much rather be hibernating right now.
“Unlike you I know how to control my creature inheritance!” Draco snapped at him and stood up.
Severus sighed and sipped his own tea.
Severus stopped mid thought, eyes narrowing more. “Are you saying you do?”
Tatsuya smiled as they walked down the hall. Every mirror they passed in the hall held a glimpse of Tatsuya in all his terrifying glory. Those passing by either stopped to half bow or gave LeFay an extra-large gap of room. Ammit slithered along the ground behind them as they walked, hissing at those that didn’t pay attention.
Tatsuya chimed in. Harry could almost see him chuckling.
The goblin patted the papers and then pulled out a few keys, each of them floating to the respective recipients. “First, there is the matter of the secret keeper. As listed here in the will, the secret keeper was indeed Peter Pettigrew, and not Sirius. It would seem the reports and investigation on Sirius Black would be wrong. Though, we’ve had enough evidence now for a while since most death-eaters were dropped off at Azkaban, including Pettigrew, not too long ago,” Ulkalb said, glancing over at Regulus with a knowing look. Regulus nodded and he could just make out the anger and Albus’ face.
Bubo cooed at him from his perch, seeming to notice Harry was awake. Harry sighed and got up, grabbing a long robe from the bed post and pulled it around himself as he made his way over to the owl. He scratched between the Eagle Owl’s ear tufts and smiled sadly. “You miss the twat too huh,” Harry said softly. He turned his head when he heard a soft hissing behind him, looking over his shoulder as Ammit crawled his way up to hang heavily around Harry’s shoulders.
“Leave us,” LeFay commanded, eyes locked with Draco's. Douglas seemed the only one hesitant to leave, but a quick nudge from one of the others and he left with a glance at his Lord.
“It’s probably a hoax. You know this right?” Snape said.
Draco could understand that. He just wished Harry hadn’t used Voldemort as an example. “Well, your behavior is pretty ill mannered…,” Draco mumbled under his breath, thinking Harry wouldn’t hear it. However, he did, and Draco ended up with a face full of peanut butter and honey.
“I won’t endanger a child-.”
Draco noticed but didn’t say anything, already deeming himself the one that should watch their backs. Mostly because he had more control of his inheritance.
LeFay stood and nodded.
"My turn then," he whispered into Harry's ear, and he could feel the automatic rush of arousal flowing through both of them. This was going to be an exhausting night, but he was going to love it.
to be placed with his muggle relatives.”
Harry hadn’t ever really told anyone but he loved the forest, almost as much as he did flying. Of course, he did feel a bit tied down by the fact he couldn’t see the sky, but the sun spots through the trees' leaves were gorgeous; absolutely stunning.
Draco’s brows came together.
“Hello, my name is Ladon, Ladon Wing. I seemed to have gotten separated from tourist hiking group and then the storm came down-,” Draco paused licking his lips, “I’m freezing.”
Harry nodded and jogged ahead, stopping when he came to the small clearing with a large rock in the middle. “We should rest here a while. Charlie, have you been able to pick out anything?” Sirius asked. Charlie glanced around, picking up something off the ground.
Draco wasn't listening anymore as he got to his feet, wobbling as he started to step towards the bed.
"And Harry?"
“Yes."
Thanks so much for the Kudos you guys!
“A what?”
“Sorry.”
“I wasn’t staring… I was, observing,” he stated.
He looked back at the field behind him, having a sudden longing to stay there. It was so beautiful.
"I know this is hard Harry, but you have to remain strong," Dumbledore said encouragingly, "Now, head on back."
“You heard her, it’s not her fault," Harry butted in, "It’s just what was available, I don’t mind sharing." He chuckled, “As long as you’re not a bed hog that is.” Harry set his trunk down and tapped it with his wand.
Draco was shocked, and that shock quickly turned to anger. This was no time for games, Harry was hurting right now, badly, and Draco had promised he was going to be there for him. "I didn't tell anyone anything, I haven't even left the castle since I got here!" he snapped back, fuming that this, creature would darn accuse him of doing anything that would hurt Harry.
“Lord LeFay please. We want to do this. If it protects your- no, our family, we are willing,” Narcissa stated firmly as she walked over to Harry. He looked at her, puzzled, and even looked over at Draco who only nodded as his grey eyes never left Harry’s. Harry looked back at Sirius and huffed a little but walked up to the alter.
The hyena, upon hearing it's name stood up, sniffing loudly as it looked between Snape and Dumbledore.
Harry looked up at the eyes and nodded. He loved the warmth, and he promised. Anima reddetur votum, he mouthed. "Forever," he nuzzled into the warmth's neck, smiling slightly. This was the warmest he'd ever felt, and the light shinning on him didn't hurt his eyes like he expected.
Harry frowned as he ate, staring at the cave entrance. Charlie stood in the mouth of the cave with a sketch book in hand. He could see the nose of Draco the dragon peeking out of the cave, the rest of him too far in shadow to see. Harry finished his food and then headed over to the cave.
It didn’t take long for them to get through the book and place it back on the shelf.
“Harry, we’d like to ask you some questions about what happened the day before last. First, I want to inform you that you parents have been notified and are currently waiting outside. But due to the questions we are going to ask I have told them to wait outside until we are done,” Minerva stated. Harry nodded, acknowledging what she said as he looked over everyone there. “First, tell us all that you remember up to when we found you,” she said kindly.
Severus wiped his thumb across Harry's forehead, then Draco's as he started to speak. Within moments the room was filled with a soft green and blue, the lights going out as Severus voice grew furious. The last thing Harry saw and felt where the light, the lights burned his flesh and he could hear himself screaming.
Tatsuya reminded him.
he said and motioned at the pool of water. Harry obeyed and knelt by the water’s edge, cupping it to his lips and taking a sip. It felt cool against his lips and he felt it move throughout his body, leaving him tingly. He laid down beside the water to rest, and started to feel his eye lids droop.
“I’ll look into it,” Draco finally said, putting the letter into his dress robes. Sirius smiled and thanked him, after the three left Draco sat down, a house elf popping in to give him his afternoon tea.
“I’ll take bottom shelf for my books and you can have top shelf. The middle shelf will be reserved for potion ingredients,” Harry said as he floated his books to the shelf, marking them off on a piece of parchment as they passed. Draco started unpacking as well, agreeing with the organization suggestions.
They both sat there, shivering in each others embrace for what felt like years. Time here, however, was just an illusion. When they finally pulled away Draco collapses onto his back, looking up into darkness. He was cold, naked, and he didn't even remember how he got here. What had even happened. He looked over at Harry, startled at first at the change in appearance. He was taller, and his hair longer, the scars along his body worse than anything he had remembered. When Harry turned to look at Draco, Draco almost felt the urge to vomit. One of Harry's eyes where missing, a long gash across his cheek and forehead that branched off and hit his lip. He realized then that it also connected with Harry's famous scar.
Harry’s eyes narrowed, and Sirius could tell he was about to blow, “Now Harry, it’s my responsibility as Lord Black to take care of the whole family. That includes Narcissa, and her son. They have Black blood too and Draco didn’t seem all that bad at the end,” Sirius reasoned. Harry huffed but didn't' object, and started towards Potage’s. Sirius followed, feeling triumphant as they entered and bought the cauldrons.
Ammit asked and tilted his head, flicking his tongue out at Harry.
Harry said excitedly, ‘
Ron's nose wrinkled. "That ugly smelly thing is your familiar?" he sneered.
Ghost didn't respond with a noise this time; only walking beside Harry as the two started up the steps to Gryffindor Tower.
"Ghost saved our lives. Once we got back to the study to start your lesson Nigini attacked me. Ghost was really hurt protecting us both and you passed out. It would seem that in the panic you managed to bond yourself very tightly to your familiar. He's recouping in another room under the care of," he stopped. The Malfoys were suppose to be dead, who was he going to say was treating Ghost?
Draco didn't want to, but the way Harry lay there, with his hands over his chest, and his skin so pale it was almost like a china doll, he doubted it. The only way Harry survived was a miracle in and of itself.
“Sire?” Douglas asked as he looked up at LeFay, “Has something happened? You stopped mid-sentence.” Douglas stayed kneeling but, like the other three in the room, their heads lifting from being bowed when Douglas spoke.
Noticing Harry was sniffling again Draco lifted his grey gaze to the wizard and nosed under his chin. It was weird comforting one Harry Potter, but who would? Harry had obviously charmed the area around his bed so no one could hear him at night, which only left Draco-no Ghost, there.
Harry nodded and then made sure Ammit was safely snug around his shoulders and torso before moving. “Let’s go,” Harry said.
"I see you are short on words, come. I would like to get this over with as soon as possibly so I may return to my duties." Snape turned on his heel and headed back in the direction of his quarters. To Harry's surprise Ghost left his side and ran up ahead of him, keeping pace next to Severus' leg. If he didn't know any better it would almost appear as though the two were having a conversation of some kind.
LeFay raised his brows.
Draco roared. Severus hands went to his head, physically in pain from the assault on his mind. The sticky charm disintegrated as Draco got shakily to his feet, he tried to leap off the cot, only to fall in a heap as his legs gaze out.
"Relax Draco, relax. You're safe. Nothing is going to harm you here," he almost pleaded as he knelt beside his godson. As Draco did relax and lay down on the cot, Severus ran his hand over the fur covered ears.
‘Dear brother, if you are reading this you have finally been able to crawl out from under Dumble-dorks thumb and are starting out on your own. I spelled this block to keep you safe from him; on the request of our mother of course. Creature inheritances are extremely rare as it likes to skip generations until it finds the right host. I hope you are doing well- Regulus.”
Draco nodded his understanding just as the doors closed. August, followed by Douglas, Skoll, Cadmael and Severus funneled in. As everyone took their seats or knelt, Douglas and Skoll brought Cadmael before LeFay, snapping the chain holding him to a ring in the floor.
Ammit commented. Harry blinked his eyes tiredly and yawned, looking around his room. Bubo wasn’t on his perch so Harry guessed the owl had gone out flying.
Harry seemed to notice Draco’s eyes wandering and tightened his jaw as he leveled their gaze. “What did you want Draco?” he growled.
Draco put his tea down onto its saucer, "What happened at Hogwarts six years ago was not your fault!"
“Draco? He’s conscious, doing rather well actually. The scars to his face aren’t healing as well as I thought they would, even with my salve it looks like they’ll be permanent. Small white scars, so it won’t be terrible. His mother will throw a fit, but it’s treatable.” Snape answered, arms crossed over his torso. He glared at LeFay, eyes narrowed.
Sorry this one is gunna be pretty short you guys.
Draco winced before taking a deep breath, staring at Harry. How could he convince him that this was different? He probably couldn’t, definitely not with how Harry was now. Harry continued to stare him down too, one hand moved to his hip with his kilt stuck to the one side he had most of his weight on. His student robes actually fit him nicely so they weren’t baggy like they had been the first-year Draco met him. Perhaps, with the fact he looked more mature, he would act a bit more mature about the danger he was in.
Harry almost pissed himself as he jumped out of bed, looking around for who spoke. He heard booming laughter and relaxed as he realized it was coming from himself. He left out a sigh of relief and then went over to the window, moving the shades back and opening it. Bubo blinked in the bright light and hooted from his perch at Harry.
Draco could feel it too as he leaned in closer, resting his head on LeFay's chest.
"Italics"=reading aloud
“Lord LeFay has gotten very handsome, hasn’t he,” Narcissa said as she looked back at the door to the drawing room and then at her son.
“I’ll wait for you while you tend to him,” Draco said quietly, eyes falling back to Cadmael. If everything Cadmael said was true, he’d put Harry through far more than he’d realized; far more pain than he could heal by just being there for him. Maybe he was even right about him being with Harry, maybe he shouldn’t be after all that. Cadmael may have betrayed Harry, but at least he had been by his side the whole time, trying to take care of him and trying to heal him. What did he do? Nothing.
Draco continued to stare at him. “I guess,” he answered, a half smirk on his face as he sat down across from Harry. He reached over to snag one of the apple pieces only to have a tail slap his hand. “Ouch! What the bloody hell was that for?!”
"Apparently he had," Tom spoke up. "We found various broken charms on Potter. It would seem he was under various compulsion charms as well as a few binding ones. Some of his memories have also been tampered with. Narcissa has spoken with a mind healer, but they said they can only work so much on an unconscious patient. They don't want to risk being the reason he never wakes."
Draco cleared his throat, “LeFay.”
Que d'espérance
Damn Potter didn't know what was good for him. Draco did plan on telling Severus about what happened with Hermione, it still unnerved him that someone like her would discourage Harry learning more about a subject.
"I'm fine Herm," Harry added with a bit more emphasis.
He closed his eyes and settled against the rock.
The man turned the collar over in his hands, “Well, collars or tags on familiars are usually filled with magic, they act like a wand does for a wizard,” he explained as he set it back down, “So, they are made of similar materials, this one is woven primarily out of unicorn hair, and then magically dyed. It also has a bit of something else special in it,” he added.
“It says here you also have a small creature inheritance that was blocked at a young age,” Dragoon started to say slowly as he tried to get a better look at the paper he was reading. It made Sirius curious.
Harry wasn’t listening as the conversation continued. He stared at the dark shape of purple and black in the darkness. Getting up slowly he crept away from the group and towards the dark shape. Keeping the blanket wrapped close around his shoulders he shuffled over to the side of the giant. Staring into the water he bit his lip and then dropped the blanket onto the grass before wading into the water slowly.
Harry did not like were this was going.
Draco lifted his grey-white gaze from the book and up at Harry's face. They definitely weren't very good friends if that's how Harry felt, and it explained why Harry always seemed tired and did badly in class though. The book he had was pretty intensely high level reading, something that definitely required lots of concentration. Draco felt kinda bad now, but not that bad, just because he was reading book like this didn't mean he was actually better than he was in class. Draco turned away from the book and then laid down on the bed, his short fluffy tail curling slightly around his hind quarters.
"We can only hope."
Dragoon laughed loudly, “Of course it is, and its a lot more important than you'd think!" the goblin wiped at the tears that had formed from laughing, "Typically, they are mistaken for animal spirits but are based more around what Americans would call a hellhound. Yet, they are more like griffins; asked to protect treasures or areas of significant importance. Like temples. Though, the legends of seeing a Grim and dying soon after are half true, being, that is, they are on the darker side of creature inheritances. They are able to alter peoples luck, or rather curse them with bad luck which often results in their death,” he explained.
“But,” Harry pulled away slightly as Draco sighed.
the Brave and the Courageous.”
“Did you only just finish?” he was surprised. Harry nodded sheepishly and rubbed the back of his head.
Draco gasped, both arms wrapping around himself as he clutched his sides, “I said you’re right. I didn’t do anything for him, but I want to change that. You’re right, I’m not worth it. He deserves so much more, and I should have been stronger for him,” he managed to get out between ragged breaths.
"This isn't just about recent events, is it?"
“But, I made him,” LeFay couldn’t help but gag a little as he felt the satisfaction waft over him again.
LeFay didn’t answer and instead got up from his seat and headed over to a desk. He started writing something quickly onto a slip of paper and then handed it to Draco.
Hermione stood up and put her bag over her shoulder. "Well it's late. I'm going to head to bed. I'll see you guys later okay?" she stated and then headed out. Ron watched her with a frown and then shrugged. She must be in one of her moods.
Harry entered the room, and upon seeing the scene laid before him slapped a hand over his mouth and turned away. After a moment he spoke, "That's Nagini isn't it?"
“You should know where, you’ve woken up quite a few times here,” a familiar voice stated. Harry blinked hard again to try and get his vision to focus before smiling when he saw Neville and Luna sitting by his bed. He turned his head and then laughed when he saw Hermione giving him a disapproving look.
“Regulus will be right by your side the whole time,” Severus said, squeezing Harry's shoulder, “And I will be in the room as well. You have nothing to worry about.”
“Blocking someone’s core is like duck tapping a dog’s mouth shut,” Sirius cut in. Remus took a moment to collect himself and continued, thanking Sirius quietly.
Harry, LeFay, goes through a transformation and realization of just what he's been pushing away.
“If he is not in his grave, then go here. Ask for Douglas and tell him the phoenix resurrected. Now I’m late for a meeting with one of the centaur tribes,” LeFay said as he started for the door. Draco got up quickly, grabbing one of Lord LeFay’s wrists without thinking.
LeFay paused mid step, gaze falling to the ground for a moment before he glanced over his shoulder. “I have to attend to other duties first, but I plan to when I get the chance. After all, his is my mate now, and that can not be undone.”
"You going to eat that then?" Ron asked as he pointed to the jello beside Harry. He shook his head as Ron grabbed the food up greedily, spooning it into his mouth.
“Bill wait!” Charlie yelled, “We need a plan!” Charlie took off after, leaving only Harry, Snape, and Draco.
“I think that would be rather rude to spring ourselves on our guests,” Sirius stated as he stepped into the floo and dropped the powder. Harry grumbled and followed suite.
"Your cold..." Draco mumbled, leaning away from Harry. Harry frowned and took his hand back as his single eye fell the barrier beneath them. "Why are you cold?" Draco's voice shook.
Draco dropped his hand from it and laughed crudely, “I guess so.” He didn’t look up at LeFay as he continued, “I always felt your magic from it," his body trembled, "And since it never came off, I knew you were still alive. That there was hope.”
Narcissa bowed after approaching, her black robe shimmering in the fire light. “Juniper, to heal any wounds. Larch, to protect myself and to protect this family. Lemon, to purify our bond. Maple, for longevity. And Morning Glory, to promote happiness. With these I give myself and swear to be forever loyal to the Black family and its heirs,” Narcissa’s spoke as she added the herbs. She lit them aflame and then as she added her own blood she spoke the final words, “To this day, until my death, I solemnly swear.” The fire flared as the blood was added and turned to a light calming blue.
"How's he doing?"
“I will not swear loyalty to that reckless numbskull!” he shouted, enraged by the mere thought of bowing to Potter.
"They had no idea. And Sirius can not prove his innocence without Dumbledore's help. So far it would seem Dumbledore has convinced Sirius that he can do nothing," Narcissa stated softly. Oh Sirius, you stupid mutt. Why couldn't you have come to her for help. They where both Black's after all.
“Others do it because it’s basically like marriage, only more binding,” Bill cut in. Harry felt sick, and the expression on Draco's face made it worse as it went from slightly irritated to slightly sympathetic. It came to Draco then that Harry really hadn't know what he'd done. “It's super common among those with creature inheritances because it also allows them to share their magic, controlling those with excess amounts and so forth. The only catch, honestly, is that it is almost always based on a servant master relationship. One will always have more control than the other. Albeit it’s still has rules so the power can’t be abused...,” Bill rambled as he laid on his stomach with his head in his hands. “You ever hear about muggles' BDSM, it’s kind of like that.”
Something wicked this way comes.'
“Hey Charlie,” Harry announced himself as he stepped up beside him. “How is it going so far?”
“Suite yourself.”
Didn't mean to leave you
Draco's eyes dropped as he tried to stay awake. His head resting on top of his arms as he rested everything on the side of the bed.
Snape's sneer grew into a vile smile.
Draco took a chance and glanced around the side of the hedge, surprise blossoming on his face when he saw the massive white kitsune that currently sat at the top of the small hill in the center of the maze. At the bottom of it sat Lord LeFay, looking small for once.
Narcissa appeared on the front porch of the Black Manor with Draco in tow.
LeFay stiffened, looking up sharply as Skoll approached the other side of the bed, glancing down at his brother. “I didn’t realize there was anyone else here,” LeFay growled.
Draco sighed, feeling frustrated as he rubbed his face with his hands. “Sev,” Draco said quietly.
He must be really out, Harry thought to himself. He stood up and placed his hands on the cool scales to steady himself as he balanced on his toes, trying to look at the dragon’s back. A large spear stood in the air, almost like it had been stabbed down directly into Draco’s back. Harry settled back down onto his heels and glanced around to try and find something to step up on. He settled for using the dragon’s elbow to step up, dragging himself onto the dragon’s back. He was surprised to see that the ridges down the dragon’s back had a bit of hair like material growing at the base of them. Stands of the material spilled down either side of the ridges but the actual growth stopped only a few inches from the ridges before turning into Draco’s scales.
Tatsuya chimed in suddenly,
He remembered McGonagall walking out of the infirmary.
"Am I interrupting anything?" he asked as he closed the door, eyes switching between the other three in the room. Tom, Voldemort, stood from his desk and shook his head.
"You really made a mess of things by coming here. It took a lot for him to start looking at everyone with an equal eye after you left him."
Cadmael laughed, “Just a kid! That’s really your excuse for everything isn’t it? What about after Voldemort was destroyed? Why didn’t you patch it up with him then, and after he vouched for you so you weren’t thrown in right with your dad? What about the six years after? You have no idea what he’s gone through you selfish twirp! All the twisting he went through by Albus’ hand, everything his muggle shit relatives did to him, when Sirius almost died, shit when the whole castle’s inhabitants almost died! Where were you?! That's right you were on the opposite side fighting him every step. And even after that you didn't even come by to apologize until you were forced to move in under the same roof as him. Even then when you started to think there was something you forced yourself apart from him, when he needed you most you left him. He had to push himself farther than he already had to save your ass and did he ever get a thank you? No!” Cadmael bellowed.
Severus shook his head, "He is too unstable. The change back by itself would kill him. Hand me the tears."
A vampire hive had been seen camping out in the Forest of Rothiemurchus, and along with them there had been sighting of the new Dark Lord, Lord LeFay, meeting with. Draco’s breath caught in his throat as he flipped the letter over. Stuck to it was a moving picture of said Dark Lord entering an abandoned looking cabin.
Feet slapped against wet floors again, but it didn’t last long as he peeked out from the darkness into the light. He stepped out onto soft grass and he could feel it under his bare feet. He looked down, only to realize they weren’t feet, but delicate large paws. He tried to get a better look, only to realize he wasn’t controlling himself. He started to panic a little as he heard a loud roar coming from the forest in front of him. His view shifted and he felt himself moving forward, moving his head as if it would get caught on something. There was a loud crash and another loud roar and the trees shuddered. He looked wide eyed at a giant purple eye that opened between the trees. He felt himself look directly at it before his mind was filled with screaming. He started running from the thunderous roar, slipping and tumbling. The last thing he saw was jaws closing over him and what, sounded like, Draco screaming his name.
“It was what we had to do,” Narcissa said, looking exhausted as she sipped at her drink. “Thank you for the tea Remus.” He nodded and then glanced over at Draco who was petting his large owl, looking very disinterested in starting a conversation. Narcissa frowned at her son, she truly felt horribly about moving her son from their home and seeing him like this made her heart bleed. “Draco,” she murmured. Draco turned his attention from his bird.
To the people gathered there they would see his eyes starting to glow a brighter green and his hair prickle. “It was Seamus, Dean, and another student I didn’t recognize in the hall. They had Parvati Pali pinned between them and a wall. They kept shoving her and calling her a freak, telling her to tell them what she was. Seamus punched her in the diaphragm when she refused, and that’s when I pulled my wand on them. I should have gotten help instead, but I think if I had they might have really hurt her. Anyways, I knocked Dean away with my wand when he grabbed Parvati and was countering a spell Seamus was throwing at me when I was knocked back by the third student’s spell. I didn’t even know he’d cast anything till it hit me. Parvati tried to warn me but,” Harry stopped, driving his nails into the palms of his hands as he sucked in a breath and tried to stop the tremors that had started. His magic was starting to lash around angrily, causing the two Weasly’s to look around a bit nervously.
“Harry!” Draco yelled after him.
“Yea…Headmistress, the castle is warded from letters getting in that are not immediate family correct?” his attention turning from the table to McGonagall.
“Repeat your name,” LeFay said.
Cadmael was passed out in the chair, but breathing calmly, and Harry felt a rush of relief. “Severus, thank you,” Harry said, bowing.
Tatsuya could go back through his memories then and read it for himself. It was a system they started working out when Tatsuya started wanting to read things Harry didn’t care for.
The castle before he wasn’t even close to Hogwarts’s size but it was still impressive.
Harry’s eye widened, welling up with more tears as he squeezed Cadmael’s hand tighter, anger rushing over him after registering what Cadmael had said. “Shh, rest. I’ll have them treat you after, but you’ll have to tell us everything you know once you’re stable enough to talk. I’ll handle Draco,” he said quietly as he dusted off the side of Cadmael’s face. There was a soft nodd from Cadmael as he licked his lips and let his eyes close. The medics witches lifted him onto the gurney carefully as LeFay stood, dusting himself off.
Je ne suis qu'un être sans importance
“This is amazing. I’ve never heard of anyone with a dragon inheritance being able to fully connect enough to transform,” Charlie stated in awe. Parvati glared at him.
Ammit continued smiling as Harry’s eyes went wide and he sat back, mouthing wow as he looked up at the ceiling. He heard someone scoffing at him and looked down at Ammit.
“This is all the old goats fault, he messed with powers that shouldn’t have been meddled with!”
LeFay let out a sigh.
"What about you August, William?" he asked, his attention turning to his two trusted immortal brothers. Both shook there heads no, letting there heads fall back down into a bow as they felt the air crackle around them. "What about the packs?" LeFay growled through clenched teeth, trying hard to keep his calm. Ammit really shouldn't have been gone this long.
Snape chuckled, “They are the potions to change your patronus. I know you’ve been taking them.”
what is our version of right and wrong,” they continued to purr.
After Harry finished undressing he turned to face the striped hyena, surprised to find the creature staring at him. Ghost's eyes seemed be focusing on one of his scars intently, one that ran up the length of his left inner forearm. Seeing the animal eyeing him like that made him nervous. "I know you're an animal but could you stop staring, it's weird," Harry stated. Ghost blinked at him as if hearing him for the first time before the animal stepped towards him and put his nose against Harry's scar on his arm. Harry's skin flinched at the contract with the cold nose. "It's from Voldemort, when he used my blood to resurrect himself," Harry explained, his voice barely above a whisper. Ghost flinched at the use of the name and Harry noticed but didn't comment on it. There was a moment of silence as Harry shifted his weight from foot to fit, watching as Ghost seemed to be inspecting him, taking note of all the injuries Harry had endured.
"We were all fooled."

"Potter!" Severus snapped as he heaved the heavy mass into his arms, clearing the middle island with wandless magic and setting Draco's body up on it. "This is not the time! Help me!"
LeFay grumbled and then glared up at Draco, grumbling to himself at this impossible feat. “Well, you heard him,” LeFay shouted.
Griphook grumbled but bowed back, “I expect to be your nephew’s account manager for a very long time.”
"Why the bloody hell would Snape bring in something like that?" Ron asked, his lip curling more.
Draco and Narcissa are settling in, that is until the boys came home from shopping and all hell breaks loose as well as a few tempers. Of course, there's always that one person that seems to make everything better.
Charlie put a hand on his brother’s shoulder.
“Yes?”
“So, Charlie. What do you think we can expect from this dragon?” Sirius asked as he ducked under a branch.
"I'm nothing like him, I can assure you, I didn't even met him. Which I'm honestly glad for," he stated.
"We both know Harry is stronger than any of us give him credit for. He'll make it," Severus said softly.
“Tips can be dangerous, or fakes. What made you so sure?” LeFay, asked.
“It is theorized by the council that both the death of his wife, and what he believed to be two of his sons drove him to insanity,” August stated, answering Skoll's question before he could form the words to ask. He watched his werewolf friend wilt, and a pain of sadness and grief for the man formed in August’s chest.
Severus could feel his emotion bubbling to the surface and he had to turn away. "You were not yourself," he stated quietly.
"Harry?" a soft voice spoke. "Harry, its Draco, I'm going to come over with a blanket okay? I know you are dazed but we can work this out," Draco motioned for Narcissa, Lucius, Severus, and Tom to stay put as he grabbed a blanket and slowly made his way over to Potter. He sat down in front of the table with the blanket on his lap before closing his eyes and reaching out gingerly at their bond. He touched the cord gently, coaxing it to life and in return coaxing his other half to him. When he opened his eyes Harry was peeking out from under the table, a startled look on his eyes. "Come on, I told you. I'll keep you safe," he said softly.
LeFay looked to the north, trying to keep his antlers out of the branches above. Even with magic surrounding them to make a path, the snow still held them back. Bowing their head they pushed forward, all the while LeFay was hating himself.
“Now, Harry… About the blocks, you had more than a couple," Remus bit his lip, "And honestly we aren't sure how you've survived,” he said flatly, pulling a paper out of his pocket. Sirius’ expression turned dark when he glanced at it. “Any normal person would have died, but it seems that your Kitsune inheritance was, thankfully, able to soften the blow.” Harry stared at the floor for a long moment as he took in the information. It had been that bad? “There were seven blocks! One was on your core which is highly illegal!” Remus snapped angrily, slapping the paper with the back of his hand before looking back at a startled Harry.
Harry's memories haunt him.
Snape glowered from his seat, his arms crossed over his chest. On the inside, Snape smiled a little, he was thoroughly impressed.
LeFay glanced at the vile and then at Draco before biting his lip. Getting up form his desk he went to grab his pensive and brought it back to his desk. With a nod to Draco he added the memories and let himself fall in. Minutes later he sat up in his chair, a low growl building up in his throat. "That vile man....Ammit!" LeFay bellowed.
Je danse avec le vent la pluie
Draco flinched as the last pieces of the mirror hit the floor. Apparently, LeFay really hated people seeing his Kistune counterpart. Draco noted. Or maybe it was just him seeing it that made LeFay react so?
It had started snowing as he tracked it, making it almost impossible to maneuver through the trees and underbrush. He had to stop a few times to catch his breath, finally deciding to lean on a larger tree to rest. In the quiet stillness around him he started to hear something carried in by the wind. He turned his head, trying to pinpoint were it was coming from. It sounded like someone singing, and he decided to investigate.
"It would seem every time he tried to get help Dumbledore intervened, accused Harry of lying, or memory wiped Harry and those he turned to," Nacrissa added.
“I take that as a while,” Harry scoffed as he picked up his robe and slipped it on over his body, finding a spot to lay back against the dragon. “I’m not sorry,” Harry started as he pulled his knees to his chest, “What Cadmael said, while rash, was true. It was how I was feeling at the time, but I also knew it was my fault. I believed that I was this monstrous thing, that everything that had happened up to that point was entirely my fault. And then suddenly finding out I was actually this creature, and all the memories that were no longer stolen from me returning, and suddenly the Headmaster being the bad guy in all of it. I was so confused at the time, and even as I aged, this whole creature inheritance that I knew so little about disgusted me. To be a part of something so dark, and having been told all my life by Albus and those he’d used that those dark creatures were inherently evil,” he paused and leaned his head back against Draco’s cool scales, “August changed everything. He was one of the first people I met after leaving Hogwarts. He spotted me in a backwards part of the alleys while I was looking for answers. I’m sure he’d had plans to eat me until he realized what I was. He took me under his wing for a while; introduced me to more of HIS people. The ones I’d always thought were just out to hurt others, or were cursed in some way. Then I realized that they were just as much people as everyone else was, that they deserved a life just like everyone else. That’s when I invited them to the LeFay Manor, and started to really dive into the research. The more I read, the more I heard the angrier I got. I hated myself for letting myself become so swayed by just someone's words and promises rather than actual facts. That I wasn’t strong enough to break Albus’ spells and plots. There would have been so many people I could have saved,” he stopped and laid a hand on Draco’s large scaly arm, scratching the scales gently and pulling a few bits of old scales and skin off. “In the end, I recognized that what I’d been told and raised with was all wrong, but that didn’t stop me from shoving everything about my true self to the side. That I was still a monster, and all these instincts I had were still wrong,” he started to laugh softly. “Cadmael tried so hard, then Albus had to go and ruin it,” Harry growled, his hand digging into the scales. Draco didn’t mind at the moment, he was finally breaking down walls Harry LeFay had been holding up for so long.
"However?" Severus sat up straight, he didn't like the sound of this.
“So, you’re a Forest Kitsune correct?” Harry asked.
Harry pulled his thoughts away, opening his eyes again to find himself in his human form, hand still pressed to Draco’s snout. “Good boy,” Harry purred thickly, stroking the scales. He felt a snap as the last bit of their bonding magic fell into place. Draco smiled, sending a wave of appreciation and satisfaction across the bond, causing Harry to blush.
Harry closed his eyes, sniffing slightly as he thought back to it. “Um… Lavender, and something woodsy, and dark. Like dark chocolate almost,” he stated and then opened his eyes to see Theo still rummaging. Finally, he brought over what looked like a scarf. Harry didn’t think he had ever seen it before. “Were did you get that?”
