Finley whips his head around, cold blue eyes landing on him and a false smile replacing his previous grimace. Arsehole.
He had a lot to be mad about and a quarter of that stemmed from the man standing in front of him at the moment.
He doesn’t even need to turn his head to know that Harry’s watching him with an intensity worse than Albus’. He can feel him staring into the side of his face and Draco doesn’t think he can possibly blush harder than he most definitely was at the moment.
His vow of silence works like a charm when dinner starts, with everyone else but him contributing to the various conversations that range from dragon mating, to Quidditch house cups, to the wonders of red-headed mermaids in Muggle cinema. The one good thing about being around a large group of extroverts was that it was easy to fade into the shadows when needed.
Jaspers stomps into the room, calling his name far too loudly than what was socially appropriate. “Ah, there you are! I’ve been looking everywhere for you! You want to know your future for today?”
“He’s trying to forgive you, Harry,” she had said. “He’s trying but he’s clearly not very good at it. And before you ask, I know this because if he’s taking the time to explain
A man with an overwhelming cologne comes by and rudely reaches over them to wrap something Potter calls a ‘seatbelt’ around all of their waists before quickly moving onto the couple ahead of them.
She must have just come back from the Quidditch pitch during her free period because her hair is slightly damp, her skin smells like soap, and she has that glowing pink tint to her freckled face that she always wears after stepping off the field.
, not diversity in blood status. If that was the issue then he would have kept Scorpius in Charm School, because it was far more racially diverse than this school claimed to be. Besides Al, he hasn’t seen a single person of color here.
Draco’s taller stature was a blessing, unless he was in a cramped cupboard with mops and an overflowing of cleaning supplies hanging from the shelves. The top of his head hits the bottom of a bucket hung from a hook and he curses. “Bloody hell,” he hisses.
,” she glares at Ron, “agreed to let you figure things out at your own pace. Without our opinions keeping you back.”
? Dumbledore, watching down from his portrait at the scene unfolding before him, had looked awfully amused at Malfoy’s high pitched wails.
He said it and Draco heard it. Or at least he thought he did. He’s thought a lot of things about Harry Potter, so maybe his mind was just playing tricks on him, somehow punishing him for thinking he could ever actually have Potter.
Malfoy walks by their table. A young Gryffindor several tables adjacent to them loudly hisses to his friend that ‘
“Maybe,” Scorpius murmurs solemnly. He picks at the thick red rug beneath him, his feet swaying in the air. “He doesn’t think I know that there are some potions he’s supposed to take. Mum would get cross when he hid them in the cabinets.”
“Is there?” Draco asks, scowling as he bites his red bottom lip. His eyes fall to the ground, looking far too disappointed with himself for Harry’s liking.
It was the perfect plan, but first, he had to get through breakfast. Breakfast, which used to be a relaxing affair, was now more salacious than those magazines he just
From what he missed in the PTA meeting, it turns out that Show and Tell was an important affair, one that could beat the annual Ministry Gala in its significance. So it was only right to ensure that Scorpius brought the coolest, most interesting thing from home that wasn’t nailed down and tell a good story about it to the rest of the class.
” Shouts Albus, jumping off the bed and pretending to seize Scorpius’ imaginary wand. Albus puffs up proudly. “That’s the one Dad used to defeat Voldemort. Mum says it’s the only one he’s good at though.”
One of the little girls she was pointing at turns her nose up at the woman from behind her back, then sticks her tongue out, causing a chorus of giggles that Draco may or may not have joined in on. Their teacher snaps again, her thin frame all points and angles as she hisses for them to be quiet.
Well, not for Potter per se, but rather for a gift for the children that he could use. He may or may not have overheard Potter talking to Ana about how he still has yet to find a book based on constellations for the children in his class to read for next term. And he knew just the perfect book.
Not wanting to admit that he was insatiably curious to find out just what was a shame about Potter’s hairy arse not being here today, Draco bites his lips, keeping his wandering thoughts to himself as they reach the nurse’s room.
He’s Harry Potter. Surely, that alone means more than some well-crafted lie in a newspaper. He shakes his head, resolving himself to forget all about it and flips to page six to find out what else that crazy partying Prince has gotten himself into now.
“I am so sorry about that, Mr. Malfoy. That boy has gotten more troublesome with each passing day. Now, where were we again?”
“You can try to ignore me all you want, Malfoy. But you’ll be seeing me around a lot more these days.” Draco snaps his eyes from the stained ceiling to Potter’s impassive green eyes. Seeing his reaction, Potter’s lip curls upward into a haughty smile that Draco hasn’t been the target of since his school days. He shudders, not waiting to be reminded of Hogwarts. “That’s right. My son Albus goes here, so get used to it.”
She gestures to Marcéline who was beginning to get a bit fussy in her arms. “You mind if I feed her here?” He’s about to say that he doesn’t mind but Pansy’s already pulled out her left breast and held it to Marcéline’s whimpering mouth. “Thanks. Anyway, so what are we gonna do Draco? I know some very good hexes that’ll make her drown in her own tears. And for fuckarse Finley I think a nice
Draco scrubs his cold face with his hands. “So, now you know why I am divorced. Can we please stop talking about this? Usually my first dates aren’t this intense.” If he even gets a first date that is.
Draco doesn’t know why he looks so baffled by his reaction. When angered, a dragon will always choose fire as it’s first form of retaliation.
Potter was now being debriefed in the sacred Malfoy family rule. Parallel universes really do exist.
“Yes, yes, Scorpius is okay. It’s Albus that’s the issue.” He waits for her to continue. Sighing tiredly into the receiver she says, “He fell out of a tree during break time today.”
“I accidentally released a snake from its enclosure at a Muggle zoo,” Potter adds when he’s finished silently admonishing his son. “What you did was fairly tame in comparison.”
The sickly tint of his face intensifies under the soft yellow restaurant lights when Harry wraps an arm around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer in the small booth seat. “It explains a lot when you think about it.” Draco laughs, the sound too high pitched and fast to be considered sane, though his friends are none the wiser. He was hardly sane to them as it was.
He looks feral. His delicately plated hair is strung every which way. Withdrawn, pale eyes accuse him with their searing glare and the muscles in his face are tense as he snarls at him, hand wandering dangerously close to his pocketed wand.
He shrugs again, acting far more concerned about the food on his plate than Draco’s new prerogative. “Sure, I guess.” He twirls a noodle around and around with his fork, the Italian red sauce making circular patterns on the plate. His eyes lifting upwards, lighting up hopefully. “Does that mean you’ll get to hang out with me and Al at school?”
“That doesn’t mean you can’t visit him. You always can, I’ll never prevent you from doing so. But you need to prove yourself, not to me as much as to him. Don’t you think you’ve hurt him? Can you look me in my eyes and tell me that you genuinely think you’ve changed?”
Harry shrugs. “That’s part of it. Truthfully, we had grown apart years ago. We had gotten married too young anyway— everyone was still riding post-war high, I wanted to officially be a part of the Weasley family, and she naively tried to pretend that she was just close ‘friends’ with Luna Lovegood.” He laughs to himself, as if the entire thing was a hilarious joke and not the decimation of the life he built with a woman he raised three children with. “They’re together by the way. You should see them, they are arguably the most annoyingly cute couple I’ve seen in my life.” He fake gags but Draco can see the genuine fondness underneath his actions.
Ron sniffs, his nose wrinkled as he pulls away from Molly’s hand. “Ugh, Mum, I hate that new perfume you have on.” His hand flies to his mouth in shock. “I-I didn’t…” His face turns an unattractive shade of purple as he tries to retract his statement.
” He laughs as he reads Draco’s reminder to avoid charming reptiles until Thalassa finishes its orbit. “You were always so posh and refined in school. Had I known that you were just hiding your secret love for astronomy and to-do lists by being a total arsewipe, it would have been a lot easier to reciprocate your taunts.”
“I gotta go do… Quidditch stuff. Er, I’ll see you later Harry. And uh, Malfoy.” He hardly looks at either of them when he walks away, his hand discreetly tucked into the pockets of his robes.
,” Potter scolds. His voice is oddly raspy and his face is sporting the hint of a blush under his bearded face. Draco feels a bit put off by the sight. It wasn’t like Potter was the one singing for five minutes straight.
If Harry wanted to talk about embarrassing moments, Draco thinks he has him beat. There’s nothing more humiliating than engaging in an entire conversation with not one but
While Draco focused on not throwing up in his mouth at the thought of being surrounded in a room with a bunch of drooling children, the other parents seemed far too enthused by the idea, even suggesting to break off into pairs to take a day each.
That warm, tingling feeling he gets whenever he reveled in the beauty of his magical night sky and it’s creations swirls in the cavern of his chest. It’s funny, because it feels a lot like when he kissed Harry.
Scorpius hiccups and sniffs several times. His little voice wavers as he explains that no, it was his fault because it was his magic that had accidentally pushed Albus out of the tree. From his garbled retelling, Draco pieces together what happened. Albus was going to fall regardless, but Scorpius must have panicked when he saw his friend starting to fall and his magic reacted as a result.
Boot is the personification of his surname. He stomps in between Potter and Draco, easily pushing Draco out with his large frame, disregarding him like a piece of dust. Draco snarls at both Boot and Potter from behind his back. Potter’s all smiles as he talks to him, clapping him on his broad back as the two migrate to the front of the room, chatting, forgetting him.
“Fine, fine, no talk of Aurors.” He makes a zipping motion with his fingers and thins his mouth. “But can I please just ask you one last question?”
He draws back on to his heels when the flames turn orange and Harry’s face is gone from the fireplace. “Fuck.”
Malfoy wipes his face again and scowls at a tree bark beneath his legs. When Harry looks slightly closer, he sees the faintest bit of blonde hair on his bare thighs. For some reason, he feels relieved by the sight of the fine hair.
“Told you to trust me.” He places their palms together and they do a simple turn about which was easily the only move Harry can say he is decent at.
“You want to know what I really think?” Malfoy nods. Harry takes a deep breath and crosses his arms. “I still think of you as the pointy faced ferret as before. And definitely as the most annoying bloke in Hogwarts.”
Draco feels his body shut down and the edges of his mouth turn downwards. “It’s… this is not about me,” he waves off, even though it actually was, “Plus I asked you first. Why are you divorced?”
He guesses he should be thankful when he finally ended the date, merely five minutes after Draco recalled a funny situation with Scorpius and a pile of peacock feathers. His date had paled, his eyes glazing over and his already unattractively thin mouth setting into a thinner, terse line.
“Potter,” he says slowly, breathing deeply as he chooses his words carefully. If he didn’t know any better, he’ll say that Malfoy was nervous. “Would you perhaps like to go to the Yule—”
Draco whips his hair in his face, stomping down the steps with Harry right on his tail. He can hear his heavy footsteps following his. “Potter, I swear to Merlin if you don’t fuck off!”
“Oh don’t look at me like that,” he grumbles to his owl before realizing that he was once again talking to an animal. Stupid Potter and his stupid dimples and even stupider friends have gotten his head messed up like he was sixteen all over again.
Sagitta, as it turns out, is nothing at all like he expected her to be. She looked completely Wizarding in her appearance, an oddity amid Muggles. He doesn’t miss the dragonhide on her boots or the Ravenclaw class ring on her finger.
While other parents are giving their children last minute hugs and advice for the new term, Draco’s looking anxiously around the station for a woman who wasn’t here. There’s a faint tug on his sleeve and Draco looks down, giving Scorpius a watery smile only to receive a soft shake of his son’s head in return. He knows. He’s always been too clever for his own.
Insanely curious, Harry shakes his head. “No, who are they?” He racks his memory for any blokes that were together in Gryffindor but he can’t seem to come up with any names. Then again, seeing that he hadn’t realized Malfoy was gay, he doubts he’ll notice if anyone else was. He still feels supremely daft for not picking it up sooner. Straight blokes usually don’t go around sucking sausages and flirting with other guys for fun. Even straight blokes who have been magically turned into girls.
The Manor is filled with books, far more than one could ever read in fact, but Draco knows that half of them are about the Dark Arts and a quarter are books that contain the name Malfoy somewhere in the text. This book is Muggle and Pansy’s recent love for Muggle things have thankfully translated into their literature as well.
“Of course not Scorp. Don’t worry about Potter and me, some things are better left unsaid.” And in the past.
He doesn’t know when this happened. Heaven and Hell must have merged into one that rainy morning that they first kissed, because Draco finds that it is so easy to submit to Harry Potter.
Coming up behind him, Ana looks as tired as he feels, her usually bright face dulled from exhaustion. “Thank goodness you’re here.” In her hands were several plasters with smiley faces on them, most likely for Albus. “Harry should be on his way soon.”
Draco never quite understood the point of Easter break for Hogwarts. Hardly any witches or wizards were religious, except for a handful of Muggleborns and Blaise, who was Jewish. As he grew older at Hogwarts, Draco hated Easter Break. Any holiday that required him to go back home and see his father was entirely unwanted.
With a heavy sigh he says, “I’m sorry to you too. I… I shouldn’t have said what I said about you.” Though he sounds ready to vomit slugs at his apology, Draco takes this as a win.
Potter swallows, once, twice. His hand is close enough to his thigh to feel it twitch nervously. Draco concedes that he may have some Gryffindor in him because he slides his own hand down so that their thumbs were just brushing against each other.
He gives him a little wave, still too stunned to offer up a proper goodbye. “Why…?” Why him? Why now? Just…
“Yeah, they just don’t have them. Adult moths only live for so long that it’s virtually useless to waste energy to create one.”
Truthfully? He’ll sing until his voice is raw and aching for Potter’s attention. But he couldn’t imagine how pathetic it would sound coming out of his mouth; probably even more than it did in his head.
Any sane man would have dropped it, but the man who claws at his sanity isn’t exactly sane himself. “Something’s going to click one day, Draco. You’ll see. Just know I’ll be there when it does.”
“Yes I know I have,” he interrupts urgently. They both moan when Harry drives deeper into him. “And it’s true, as much as you don’t want to admit it.” He runs his hands down the smooth skin of his thighs, making him shiver in want. “You can be soft, Draco Malfoy, just like you are for me now.”
She makes herself comfortable next to him, taking off her jacket and lying down on the ground. Draco stares at her, perplexed. He had closed the wards, so how she was even sitting here was a mystery.
“It’s just simply not your fault son. There’s a Harvest Moon out, that’s all. Everyone’s emotions are out of balance at the moment and your magic simply reacted out of fear as a result. It also doesn’t help that there was a large supernova last night either.”
He watches him all while he climbs up the ladder and disappears onto the top of the roof, not wanting to let go of this vision for as long as he can.
When the last of Potter’s laughter fades out, they remain in surprisingly pleasant silence, only the sizzling of delicious smelling bacon, the clacking of metal on metal, and the odd whistle from cooking food disrupting it. Small, insignificant sounds that Draco doesn’t have back in his own home. At 31 years old, Draco has to admit that until now, he’s never sat in the kitchen while food was being prepared. He wishes he did.
“You should listen to him, when brewed properly this amulet is actually powerful enough to ward off a single dementor,” Luna says knowledgeably, fingering her own amulet as Ginny continues to drool at her exposed cleavage. “Not as powerful as a Patronus of course, but still useful.”
Scorpius sucks in a breath and if he didn't know better, Draco would say he wasn’t the only one trying not to break out into sobs. “I won’t.” The train choos, the conductor belting a thunderous ‘
Draco thinks he would rather give mutilating himself a chance before Granger and Weasley. But as much as it worked his nerves, Harry was a package deal. Him and the other misfits of the Golden Arseholes were inseparable in the same way that Pansy and Blaise were for him. Though, he wasn’t asking Harry to have dinner with
—between them years ago. This sexual tension didn’t just appear out of nowhere. All of that energy put into fighting would have been much better used had Harry bent him over a desk years ago.
like children in here. It occurs to him that any place that houses a hundred tiny, squirming, little bodies at one time would reasonably smell like it.
He deserves this. After dealing with Astoria and Finley, Draco thinks he deserves the right to be a bit dramatic. Being an adult as it is was exhausting. Dealing with the Greengrass’ was enough to put anyone in an early grave.
He’s just smoothing out his shirt when Harry grabs his face and places a searing kiss on his mouth. A surprised squeak escapes his mouth, the bruising kiss leaving him delightfully lightheaded.
It’s only a few minutes later when Draco regrets ever digging out that bag in the bottom of his desk drawer. Productivity is a wasted endeavor at a time like this. He can’t measure the parallax of Sadalmelik in Aquarius. His fingers were too unsteady and his mind too unfocused to even get the proper measurements of the semi-angle with his wand. Who cares about Aquarius or parallax's when hazy thoughts of Harry Potter were consuming his mind?
“Why do I have to keep you from leaving? You could infect your mother—you know that, right?” Harry said.
She smiled knowingly. “You are determined to have everyone think the worst of you. And yet, the mere fact that you fight so hard to save the ones you love proves that you are worth something.”
Draco laughed drunkenly. “I tried to kill you. What part of that screams of my affection? I mean, the Dark Lord was quite
“Well, it’s been over two weeks,” Draco was pulling on his socks and shoes, checking his hair’s appearance in the mirror (the previous evening had messed it up spectacularly).
He couldn’t look at her picture without feeling a rollercoaster of emotions: hatred and longing, love and frustration. He couldn’t look at her without thinking of her brother, who had pulled the strings of Harry’s life since he was born, who was always standing behind the curtain, whose desire to destroy death had caused the demise of his sister…
"Fine." Harry grabbed the bottle and drank, wincing at the burn of alcohol down his throat. "I guess we're going to just have to get drunk in silence. Hemingway style."
fancy you. At all.” It was getting harder and harder to say those words. Draco wished Potter would just stake him and get it over with.
The stranger staggered, bringing his hands to his eyes, and it was only now that Harry saw that his hair had grown bushy, that his suit was large and ill-fitting, that he was—
“We have to get magic somehow,” Dijiksra said matter-of-factly.  Most witches and wizards cannot withstand the procedure. Their bodies waste away at an exponential rate, and they experience weakness, dizziness, loss of vision….We have discovered that if we re-infuse them with the magic, they recover somewhat. Though of course, that is a significant security risk.”
Hermione grabbed him by the arm. “C’mon, we need to go over our plan.” She walked him over to a set of chairs on the patio. Fake Paris even had a fake bistro. It was disgusting.
Then Harry remembered Dobby’s tennis ball eyes, dimming into nothing as the light left them. Sirius, his laugh still frozen on his face, as he fell through the veil. Dumbledore’s crumpled corpse at the bottom of the tower. Fred Weasley, laying in a pile of rubble, Percy trying to shield him with his body even though he was beyond help—
Lucius stopped. “Why should I believe anything you say? You aren’t my son—you’re a filthy, bloodsucking—”
“What does the famous Harry Potter want with us?” the witch who interrogated him had long black hair and a sardonic expression. She put her booted feet on the table and waved her wand as she talked, which emanated bright green sparks .
Malfoy sneered, not even bothering to deny it. He knew they’d had someone following him. Thomas was always so sloppy. “Well, I can obviously get around that—”
“I’m not going anywhere,” Harry said, tears starting in his own eyes as Draco snarled at him. “I won’t leave you.”
“I’m surprised a European would eat there,” Bolton frowned. His eyes darted between Draco and Hermione as though trying to catch one of them lying.
There is possibly only one more chapter (but who are we kidding? There's probably more). It's getting intense.Draco is at his breaking point. Harry knows what that means better than everyone.
Draco whispered Harry’s name gently, lovingly, in a way he’d never let himself be with anyone, not any of the players he’d picked up at a bar, not any of his girlfriends or boyfriends, there was nothing like this, nothing but this, and it was with tears in his eyes and Harry’s name on his lips that Draco finally came, his vision going blinding white.
“I thought it would stop. When I severed the bond. I thought that’s all it was—magic and blood, between us. I thought that it would make the feelings go away, but—” and tears were starting at the edge of Harry’s eyes, tears of exhaustion and despair, frustration, emotion that had been building since he’d drank the last of the elixir and felt the bond snap.
It was better that Draco had never sent an owl after that party. Better that Potter had volunteered for a mission across the world.
But why had Draco wanted to leave? Harry closed his eyes, trying to ignore the pain. McGonagall had entered, said she had a message for Malfoy. Harry was feigning sleep; he’d woken up not long before that, feeling like he was resurfacing after a long time spent underwater.
This had led to both boys’ arms giving out after dozens of endurance contests, lying next to each other on the polished wooden floor. Harry decided quickly that this exact type of competition could not continue; listening to Malfoy’s harsh breathing as he exercised was…distracting. So Harry had challenged him to wall ball.
“There’s gotta be a way.” Harry said. He took Draco by the shoulder, guided him toward his bed. Draco must have been exhausted, because he crawled under the covers without a word of complaint. “Get some rest. I’ll think of something.”
Harry snapped out of his trance and dropped too, feeling desperately for a pulse. “What the Hell—what did you—” his hands scrabbled at the man’s neck, but they were covered in something warm, something with a rusty, salty smell.
"I only live a half mile away." Harry got to his feet, intending to check the door. "I'm sure I can figure out--"
When Draco had come to the door, Harry had been sitting at his kitchen counter, his eyes closed, trying to practice Occlumency.
Maybe he and Draco had experienced too much death to ever heal from it. Maybe the scars that the war had left would only ever bleed again. Maybe they were both too damaged, too broken and sunken into the rubble for normal life to ever lift them out of it—
Lucius Malfoy didn’t even blink as Draco stepped closer, his teeth ready to slash. “You are not the type of monster that scares me anymore, Draco.” He said. “I have faced far worse than you. Now, drop this act and get dressed.”
Draco shook his head at the memory. He had to forget it. He had nearly killed Harry, nearly drained his body of its blood, and who knew how close he’d come next time? Who knew how easily he could have drank and drank, until no amount of potions or spells could bring him back?
“Potter, you really shouldn’t tell him our evil plan.” The witch leaned against the wall casually, her eyes hooded and dangerous.  “It changes, you see.”
And he was always up to something. Even now, he’d been all secretive and aloof whenever Harry had seen him. He was sure it had to be something Dark or dangerous, or both. When had Malfoy ever done something for the good of someone else?
Harry sighed. He checked his phone, but it was empty of texts and calls, as usual. He'd just graduated from college and moved out here, and he didn't have any friends in the area yet. He didn't even have a plan, or a roommate to text. Not even a cat to feed.
He spent the whole flight in fear, his mind racing ahead. He was terrified that Malfoy had already tried to cure his mother, possibly infecting everyone around himself in the process. Terrified that his father had attacked and killed him, because the Malfoy family didn’t abide nasty half-breeds.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “Sure.” He straightened his sleeves. “I was saying,” he went on, “Do you really have to be
“Well,” the witch twirled her wand over in her fingers. “If you were dead, for instance, what might happen to your magic?”
"That's not what I asked.  You walk out of every room I walk into. Unless there's a blizzard, you'd do anything to get away from me. I just--is it something I did? Is there a
But this was different, more personal. No one ever saw Malfoy like this, in these private moments before bed. No one had that privilege of seeing him when he wasn’t trying to be seen. Stripped of all his bravado, he was raw and arresting. He looked like art, like a painting come to life.
“Air depressurization enchantments, the Bubble Head Charm—” Draco listed off his spells, knowing his father was impressed by the begrudging admiration gleaming on his face. He didn’t tell him that a regular human being probably wouldn’t have been able to withstand the conditions. Didn’t tell him that he hadn’t been sure if
McGonagall had said that all the other students were staying home or with friends over break; even most of the teachers had retired to their summer homes.
He hadn’t found anything to complain about whenever he’d seen his side, at least, which Harry had thoughtfully adorned with Slytherin hangings and a picture of his family.
The witch flicked her wand, and Ron slumped against the wall, shrieking in pain. “Your Mudblood friend was of no use to us. We disposed of her.”
“Exactly. I’m glad you’re starting to see reason. And Potter.” She waved her wand, and Harry rolled over sleepily, rubbing his eyes. “Make sure Malfoy doesn’t leave.”
Draco and Hermione exchanged glances. This was their last chance to get out. They’d both agreed that they could issue an early signal; a message from Draco’s father or a sudden illness, if it seemed like the game was up.
Draco took another sip of vodka. "You tell people shit, and all they do is tell everybody about you behind your back. This whole place is like gossip girl--minus the hot people."
“What?” Lucius whirled, for the voice had seemed to be coming from the opposite direction, one of the trees that lined the path toward the manor.
"Yeah. Well. What if the grand gesture doesn't work? You say the words in the pouring rain, you hold up a boombox outside her window. You tell her everything she wants to hear, and you're gracious and kind and--it doesn't matter. Because the person she's supposed to be with--just isn't you."
“Show yourself!” Malfoy climbed to his feet, his fangs descending past his lip. “Show yourself, you bloody
Hermione smirked, and Draco blushed. “I mean, just when we were in quarantine. It was a bit annoying, actually.”
“I have undergone a power transfer recently. You see, I realized something—” she waved her wand, and the snakes disappeared. She sank gracefully to the ground, her dress merely fabric again. “Why should we only be getting this power from Muggleborns, who of course have no right to their magic, no natural ability. Why not get a few subjects who are more—
Glitter floated through the air, and the floor he walked upon had been enchanted to glow alternating colors, expanding and contracting like a disorienting kaleidoscope.  To one side of the entryway stood the bar, with brightly colored drinks that glowed and fizzled in their glasses. Most of the clubgoers were dressed in typical Muggle clothes, and they seemed to be having the time of their lives, chattering and laughing uproariously, their voices drowned out by the thumping music.
He was terrified he hadn’t made it in time; he’d had to double back for his phone, and he lost valuable time calling up the Thestrals, until he remembered that they liked raw meat, and he’d raided Aberforth’s stores.
When his orgasm finally receded, each wave a little bit weaker than the last, Harry’s limbs felt like lead. He could barely open his eyes. And Draco was still sucking the blood from his neck, making obscene little guzzling noises every few moments.
“Somewhat.” The woman wrinkled her nose dismissively. “But they’re rather clumsy with it, and the power seems to diminish the longer they hold it. Without constant infusions, they are mere Muggles again. And magic, after all, is in limited supply. We cannot simply make more.”
“If you love him the way I love Ron, you’ll show restraint. Because you know if you rip those people apart to save him, he’ll never forgive you.”
"And now?" Harry said softly, his eyes never leaving Draco's, something in his chest begging him to go on.
But when Draco was finally bundled into the Portkey home, along with Shacklebolt and his retinue, after nearly a day of Potter wrangling the opposing countries into a cohesive unit and acting as though Draco were a piece of furniture, it occurred to him that maybe Potter didn’t
But he was getting hungry. They still had nearly ten hours to go. What was he supposed to do—take out a flight attendant as he walked back from the bathroom? It wasn’t like there was any privacy on these things.
The cowboy held the scepter to Hermione’s head. “I don’t know how you tricked our guards into letting you go,” he said. “But it won’t happen again. You’re a Mudblood. You aren’t leaving this room alive.”
It just made more sense for them to do things together. They were eating breakfast at the same time (well, for Draco it was tea, but it was something), so it made sense to sit next each other at the little table next to the kitchen, for only one person to do the washing up.
“What took you so long?” Hermione hissed as Draco finally stumbled back through the doors, his shirt askew and his hair mussed.
So far, he’d had no luck. Food was one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfiguration, and apparently blood qualified as food.
Draco tries to contain his...urges. And to keep his distance from the ever-righteous Harry Potter. If only he wasn't so attractive.
“You lot are famous the world over, apparently. And Polyjuice Potion doesn’t even work on vampires. You’ll be my cousin, Abraxas.”
Hermione bent her head to her book again, her brow furrowed, and Draco settled back against the headrest.
He could only watch, horror growing in his stomach, as the cowboy entered his cell, now clad incongruously in scrubs and cowboy boots, holding a long, metal rod with a pulsating crimson gem at the top of it. “What is that?” Harry tried to say, but nothing came out.
Draco squirmed in his seat, trying to get comfortable. He couldn’t understand why Muggles paid so much money for these things. If this was the standard mode of travel, he’d simply never go anywhere.
Jake's dick doesn't work, and then they go to the Running of the Bulls, and then they go fishing, and
As intern to the Minister’s Junior Undersecretary, Draco wasn’t allowed in such meetings. Whenever the Minister spoke to him, it was usually an awkward pat on the shoulder, a brief exchange of pleasantries in a lift.
"First question." Harry moved one of his castles and took out one of Draco's bishops. "What happened between you and Anna?"
“There have been confirmed cases of coronavirus in the castle. Until you can be tested, you must shelter in place. I repeat, do not go back to your dormitories. Stay where you are.”
It was when Harry finally stepped back into the castle, thinking of taking a late lunch, his eyes slowly adjusting to the gloom, that he heard it.
Finally, she stepped off onto a floor that smelled abandoned. The air was musty, and the lights were off in the hallway. She grabbed his arm and shoved him into a room, where one of his knees collided painfully with a chair before there was a
Harry thought of the snow as magic, something that only arrived every decade or so, that always marked something important. The last snowstorm had been on his thirteenth birthday, and he'd kissed his first crush, Cedric Diggory, behind the snowman they'd built together, their lips tasting of Chapstick and ice.
He looked up. The daggers had disappeared into ashes, collecting in piles at his feet. He probed them with his finger—there was the same sense of power—the same spark. It seemed to jump into his skin, and for a moment, Harry felt a surge of strength.
After a few moments, Potter and McGonagall returned to their conversation, but Draco could still see Potter shooting him glances every few moments.
"Yeah. I can see that." Harry said. He got up from table and wandered over to one of the velvet couches, as far away from Draco as he could get. He flicked the TV to the local weather channel.
Draco’s fangs slid down over his lips, and his father stopped talking. He squinted. It was difficult for anyone but a vampire to see this night; the moonlight provided only silvery shadows. Draco stepped forward, so that his father could see him properly.
Harry thought about Draco’s insistence that he not bike home in the snow. There was something almost…sweet about it.
“Don’t we have to pay for these?” He saw Ron had already turned his on and was tapping on the screen with his fingertips in fascination. “Internet service, cell service, stuff like that?”
A woman with metallic purple eyeshadow paused from delivering a tray of drinks. “Wizards don’t get Muggle diseases! Here—” she shoved a bright pink drink into his hand. “Have some fun!”
It didn’t matter if Harry would never forgive him. It didn’t matter if Draco became a monster, crossed that invisible line he’d been toeing ever since Harry left.
Harry couldn’t understand why Draco hated him so much. With the other managers, Harry had never had a problem. Even Pansy, who everyone said was impossible, got on with him just fine. No one else seemed to be annoyed by him, to have a problem with the way he stacked the dishes or whistled while he waited for the espresso machine to warm up in the morning.
"Sure." Harry got up from the tv and went to the bathroom. When he came out, Draco was busying himself at the panini press, bending down so that he could make sure the bread was being pressed evenly.
Lucius seemed at a loss for words. His eyes were fixed on Draco’s fangs. His fingers twitched, reaching for the inside of his jacket—”
Harry rolled his eyes and locked his phone. It only had 50% battery, and he hadn't brought a charger, either.
“I like that accent,” the waiter leaned against the bar and crossed his arms.  “What’s life like ‘across the pond’?” He said the last part in a singsong, mockingly British voice.
Ron’s brow furrowed. “Right. Yeah. It’s just—usually I can feel our link.” He held up his necklace for Harry’s inspection. “The magic links us to each other, kind of like with the Deluminator. But since—since we got here, I’ve felt—nothing.”
Draco took deep breaths, trying to calm himself. Surely it didn’t mean what he thought. Surely Potter wasn’t—
Pansy sighed with exasperation. “You’re off your face. Excuse him,” she said to Draco. “Why don’t you come out on the balcony with me? We can have a drink.” One of her hands slid its way up Draco’s arm, lingering on his muscled bicep. “Or maybe a few drinks.”
He wasn’t sure how long he could keep this up. Alone, the sadness overtook him again, a cold hand wrapped around his stomach, reaching up into his throat.
Of course, her utterances about how important it was to stay in communication hadn’t stopped him from tossing his new phone on his bed as soon as he arrived back in the dormitories.
The alleyway adjoining the Hog’s Head, the one the noise had come from, ended in a dead end and a dumpster. Harry frowned. Where had the sound come from?
Hermione texted him almost daily with updates, and Ron occasionally sent a poorly taken selfie or two, but he was growing restless. It was already past time for spring break to be over, and the whole world seemed like it was just on hold, waiting for news of the next disaster, the newest outbreak.
“You’re a little outside your jurisdiction.” That came from the man dressed as a real-life cowboy next to her. He even had a piece of grass between his teeth. “What Americans do is none of your business.”
“What do you want?” Harry asked, after a few seconds of awkward silence. It was three in the morning, and he’d been lying in bed, willing his mind to empty.  His muscles were lead, and there was a stabbing pain between his eyes. The paperwork had taken hours, and then Percy had wanted a full debrief. Harry had though the questions would never end.
Draco just scowled. “You can’t save everyone, Potter.” He closed his eyes and was immediately asleep, too exhausted from his efforts to argue any further.
I'm really sorry for what's about to happen. I don't even know how to summarize this chapter, except that I was sad writing it, and you're gonna be sad reading it. Enjoy.
The foyer was a wide expanse of pristine, elegant furniture, the floor white marble. Multiple adjoining hallways, as well as a spiral staircase, extended from the room.
"I'm going to put you on kitchen duty." He gestured to the plates and mugs stacked in the sink. "Try not to break anything."
“You need to think of someone other than yourself, Mr. Malfoy. You will spend the night in your dormitory. The other Slytherins are being moved out and checked for exposure as we speak. We may be able to head off the virus with a few antiviral spells, as long as it has not taken hold in their systems—”
“My mum wants to know if you’d come home for Spring Break. A chance to toast the hero and all. We know you’re
Draco turned back to him, curled his lip. And only a hint of what had passed between them colored his voice when he said, “You think
‘Our waiter managed to Disapparate when it went south. His friends weren’t so lucky. He found their bodies a few miles away three days later. Been hiding ever since. Wizards and Muggles are disappearing daily, usually the ones nobody will miss—runaways, showgirls, stage magicians—the kind desperate enough for money or fame that they’d follow someone into the desert.”
Draco sighed. He wandered over to a silver-gilded, black satin bench and sat down. “So, why are you out here?”
And one knew that he didn’t really sleep. That he’d stopped caring when McGonagall brought news of the virus. That he didn’t bother to even check his watch for the passage of time.
McGonagall took a deep breath, then looked around. “Wait—is Potter awake? He shouldn’t be listening to this conversation. This is confidential information.”
“They left mine, too.” Ron said, still lying on the floor. He turned his wand over in his fingers, and Harry could have sworn his eyes brimmed with tears.
Pain split his skull open. Pain greater than any he’d experienced, like his very soul was being removed, like his skin was being torn off. This was agony, worse than his scar, worse than the Cruciatus Curse.
But Harry was already backing away, shaking his head. His luminous eyes filled with tears. “I won’t let you put me through this again, Draco. I—
He’d even raided a few Muggle hospitals, and he still had some bags stashed in a refrigerated, concealed section of his trunk. A simple Undetectable Extension Charm, and he had enough blood to last him weeks.
Ron looked at him mournfully. “I’ve never felt so awful in my life. Even when they were torturing Hermione. Even with the Dementors. I’ve never felt so—helpless.” He put his head into his hands, and when he raised it again, his cheeks were streaked with tears and dirt. “How are we supposed to get out of here?”
Harry nearly let out a shout when Draco emerged, followed by a tall, handsome stranger. He bit his knuckles in an effort to keep silent, adjusting his position so that they’d still know he was sleeping.
“Don’t think i would have minded Malfoy.” I countered. At that he looked up and raised his eyebrow, but before I could try and understand what that look meant, it was gone.
“Yeah I bloody know mate. Who do you think has chased after Teddy all these years?” Andy walks past with Narcissa just then and raises an eyebrow at me, clearly having heard our conversation.
I tell her everything then, how Draco’s been ill and what he said before we went to st mungos, how Katie was there. Then I told her what i had said and how idiotic I had been, and how draco had just left and not spoke to me since.
Half an hour later, I feel slightly queasy and frankly shocked to my core. Do I really want this stuff in my head? Jeez - is this what he gets up to in the Red Room of Pain? I sit staring at the screen, and part of me, a very hard part of me, is seriously turned on. Oh fuck, some of this stuff is HOT. but is it for me? Holy shit….could I do this? I need space. I need to think.
“No.” I chuckle and sit down on the counter. Nia gets the hint and sits with me. “You remember I told you I was going to speak to someone about your schooling?” She nods so I carry on. “Well I went to Hogwarts yesterday and spoke with professor McGonagall. She agreed to let me teach you here….if you want?  I mean you can go to Hogwarts if you want-“ she jumps on me with a hug then.
“How did we get here Ron? From being hunted down by Voldemort, to surviving and having family’s.” I’m still staring at Draco and don’t realise what I’ve said.
So I’ve been looking everywhere for a perfect place and asked friends to keep an eye out, for either muggle or wizard homes. Either would be fine as long as the closest neighbours couldn’t hear our shouting and screaming from fights...and other things. So when Hermione found me at my desk in the ministry last week and told me she had found the most paradisal place for us, I stupidly believed her. (I'll have to look up the word paradisal as I’m pretty sure it's not what i thought it meant when Hermione said it, because I pictured paradise actually and that’s so not what i got). I quickly spoke to the estate agent and put the deposit down. Yes i looked at it first, but no not in person. I looked at a couple of photographs that made the place look adorable and ideal for raising a family in. I could just picture me and Draco in that picture with a couple of blonde haired children and Draco with a big belly carrying another one. Me and Draco have spoken quite a bit about having children lately, so i think it’s gonna be sooner rather than later. We both have always wanted children and with recent potion inventions it’s become a reality that we can have our own. Draco was actually persuaded rather quickly to be the one to carry the children.
“Thanks Hermione. Yeah okay, i think i just need some sleep, it's been a long day.” I get up and give my friend a hug.
“I’d like to do that again.” I whisper. For a moment, I think I see a fleeting look of relief on his face, before the shutters come down, and he gazes at me through hooded eyes.
They sat there in silence for a while, but eventually Harry grew tired of checking Twitter for updates. It was the same pedantic messages from the same distressed politicians and power companies.
“The Center for Magical Diseases and Infections thought so too,” Neville said, “But it’s happening. Kingsley has ordered the school to send children home. Immediately. “
“With our devices, all pureblood families can assure that their magic remains pure, undiluted. They simply take the instrument and siphon off the magical energy from a witch or wizard who, let’s say, doesn’t
“I’m pushing you away because I don’t fucking need you anymore!” Draco shouted. “Quarantine’s over! We can go back to the way things were!”
They’d been able to handle the secret of Voldemort’s immortality. Harry was pretty sure they could deal with the spread of a virus.
He certainly didn’t want Potter to know things like that, especially since—Potter ran a hand through his hair so that it got even more ruffled, and Draco’s mouth watered.
When Dijikistra gestured to Harry’s cell, a triumphant grin on her face, Malfoy kept his face cool and neutral.  Harry was crouched against the wall, seemingly asleep, but Malfoy could tell by the tension thudding through their connection that he was wide awake.
Draco guzzled down some more blood. “Fine. They’re in a prison. He’s--in pain. I think they’re still alive, but I could be wrong. I didn’t see Ron anywhere.”  He tried to keep his voice nonchalant, but there was definitely a twinge in his gut. Harry was in terrible danger, and he was hurting.
“Potter, do not disappoint me.” Her voice had that edge to it, and Harry found himself agreeing before he could stop himself, “Yes, Professor McGonagall.”
“What about students who are staying here?” Harry asked, ignoring the mocking glance Malfoy shot him. “Where will we go?”
because they spoke of something that could never be severed, something that encompassed loving beyond a moment, beyond all time, that would live long after both of them had become dust… nothing more needed to be said.
“Y-you keep— lube in your coat?” He grunts out, bucking harshly in the air when Harry’s finger brushes up against the sensitive prostate that he just knew would undo him very soon. Fuck, he probably should have warned Harry that he really hasn’t had sex in ten years. “Felt lucky today Potter?”
Ginny elbows him in the side, raising her red brows in question and looking ready to pounce on Astoria in front of everyone. The strange glint in her eyes tells him if he doesn’t call her down soon, she’ll take matters into her own hands. He gives an imperceptible shake of his head and her metaphorical hackles reluctantly lowers in response.
“You’re right.” Ron raises a red brow at Draco’s bold statement. “My research is boring. Gr—Hermione. What is it that you do?”
and shoots her an apologetic smile. “He just has a bit of an overactive imagination is all.” Scorpius pouts in confusion. Draco keeps the smile on his face until he’s sure it was beginning to form into more of a nervous grimace than a grin.
Draco sniffs, “It's alright.” For some reason, his Slytherin-bred instinct to deny outwardly loving something kicked it.
“I never said I didn’t like it,” Harry purrs. Draco licks his lips, enjoying Harry’s predatory gaze on his body. “In fact, I fucking love it.”
Malfoy gets close enough to him to whip his hair in Harry’s face, the impact heightened by the rushing wind already snapping against his skin. That dirty little cheater. He growls, “Bugger off Malfoy!” The Snitch zips to the right, sending both him and Malfoy hurtling towards the golden object.
Every day, Draco thought about immobilizing Harry and drinking until he was finally sated. Every night, he had to practically chain himself to his bed so as not to slither into Harry’s.
Draco frowned.  “You know, you’re quite an accomplished Legilimens. The Dark Lord should have recruited you.”
Everyone left after breakfast. He saw the mass exodus, a sea of black transported in carriages from the castle to where the train waited, from his vantage point atop the Owlery.
His advisors had managed to keep Draco as an intern, to take photos of him hurrying after the Minister on one of his errands, to get some of the establishment on Shacklebolt’s side as he introduced his sweeping changes, but it was all an act. Draco wasn’t part of Shacklebolt’s administration. He didn’t even have a key to his office.
“If you don’t leave right now,” Draco hissed, twisting Potter’s wrist a little further, so that he let out a bark of pain. “I will kill you.”
Draco lurched to his feet, stumbling toward Harry, reaching out to touch him, to hold him, to tell him anything he wanted, everything, just to get Harry in his arms again, just to stop this
Harry said nothing, but shifted away from Draco on the couch. When he finished his sandwich, he got up, grabbed a magazine from the shelf, and sat in one of the corner armchairs
Harry reeled above him, his eyes wide and open, and Draco didn’t know whether it was vampirism or lust that made him grab Harry by the neck and pull his neck to his teeth, sink them in and bite and suck and lick, until Harry was whimpering above him, until Harry’s other hand was down his own pants, his breathing faster and harsher until he came with a groan.
. For other people, love saves. Love is connection and happiness. Love is a lifeline. But for you,” he pressed his lips against Harry’s neck, his fangs only pulling at the surface of his skin, still not breaking it. “For you, those who love you only get the bad end. When they’re too close, they burn up. Better to be far away, and bathe in the light of having known you, having been near the Chosen One, but not close enough for it to hurt, to burn—”  He pressed a soft kiss to Harry’s throat, hardly able to believe what he was doing. “I know it, Harry. I know it all too well.” He held his fangs an inch from Harry’s skin, and the other boy trembled, but he didn’t move.
Draco was silent. He wasn’t about to tell anyone he was a vampire. Perhaps if he simply agreed to McGonagall’s terms now. Perhaps if he snuck into Hogsmeade while Potter was asleep and Disapparated—
Anyway, it's a few months later, and Draco and Harry are about to announce their relationship at a press conference....
“Minerva! Sorry to interrupt—” it was Neville Longbottom, his round face anxious. “I have some information to share with you. He was holding an iPhone, and he looked drawn and anxious.
for the holiday.” He bit off the end of the sentence, and Harry didn’t doubt that he was mocking him. The way Malfoy told the story of that final duel, Harry had essentially gotten in on pure luck.
He kept his wand in his hand, but he hadn’t managed to do much more than move the rock in the intervening hours. Even that effort exhausted him—it was like trying to pick up a tiny pebble with oven mitts. Everything was clumsy and awkward, and he still couldn’t do any more complex spells.
“Like what? We hate each other, Potter. We’re mortal fucking enemies. One fuck isn’t going to change that.”
“Well, Percy also said that cauldron size is ‘one of the great crises sweeping the nation.’” Ron rolled his eyes.
“Change of plans,” Draco said loudly, and he knelt, conjuring a velvet box out of thin air. “If you agree, that is.”
He felt the curious, cold feeling immediately, like an egg had been cracked over his head. He held his hand in front of his face, and he could see only the wall behind it.
He’d looked away quickly, his heart pounding, cheeks burning. There was something unerringly intimate about seeing him like that. He’d seen him shirtless plenty of times, of course. Slytherin’s Quidditch practices often overlapped Gryffindor’s, and Malfoy loved to parade around the pitch, glistening in all his glory.
Potter was silent for a moment, chewing his bottom lip. He touched the scar on his forehead, and Draco was filled with a surge of sickening loathing. He turned away. “I won’t go, Harry. Okay, just—leave me alone.”
"What?' Draco got up and wandered over to him. "I'm not playing chess with you, if that's what you're  thinking."
Draco sighed. “No, Mr. Weasley. It won’t be a problem. I’ll just pop on over to the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes.”
McGonagall sighed, running a hand across her face. “Very well. I will send a message to the students’ families that they can be expected tomorrow morning.”
Harry looked down. What was she saying? Draco needed—a friend? No, they were not friends. Not mortal enemies, not lovers, either—
Draco glared at Harry’s hand. "Hands carry bacteria. Make sure you wash yours. Your fingernails are filthy."
But there must have been something in Draco’s bite, some kind of relaxing and attracting agent, because Harry felt a surge of arousal hit his body, which already felt like it was going to burst, the moment Draco’s teeth broke through the skin of his neck. He moaned and went limp, his hands scrabbling at Draco’s back weakly, barely hanging on amid the flow of pleasure that coursed through his body.
After the funeral, anyone could tell that something had broken within Draco. Something that it seemed could never be repaired.
references!” Hermione had turned bright red, and Draco grinned in triumph. “Stop trying to flirt with me!
“Remove. Your. Hand.”  Draco met her eyes, willing his fangs not to emerge. He wanted to attack her. To tear her apart until she told him where Harry was, then get them the hell out of there.
“Oh, we’ve been down this road before,” Hermione rolled her eyes, then cast them up and down Ron’s form appreciatively. “Nothing I haven’t seen before, anyway.”
“Oh, nonsense.” Slughorn fussed at Draco’s collar, buttoning him back into respectability. “Never a night of my youth when I didn’t engage in a little debauchery, m’boy! But you come from good stock, you’ll do excellently under a little pressure.” He was steering Draco toward a set of stairs, which Draco knew opened up onto the stage that hung over the dance floor. “Potter is up there already—do us proud!”
In spite of the fact that the Hogwarts castle was enormous, their paths were constantly overlapping. He’d come down to the Great Hall for breakfast, and Draco would be wolfing down a piece of toast. He’d arrive at the Quidditch pitch for a workout, and Draco would already be out flying over the hoops. He’d go to the library to research infectious diseases (at Hermione’s direction), and Malfoy was already there, his nose in a book with an indecipherable title.
Before Ron could ask anything else, Hermione changed the subject, “Have you talked to Ginny lately?” she asked, a catch in her voice.
Madame Dijikstra and Mr. Bolton shared a conspiratorial glance. “The biggest threat to a pureblood society are Muggleborns,” Dijikstra began. As she spoke, she paced back and forth in front of the doorway, like a professor at lecture. “Thieves of our magic, there are more and more of them each generation. They dilute the bloodlines of even the most pure wizarding families, threatening the sanctity of our way of life and that of magic itself. And where do these Muggleborns come from?”
"You know what?" Draco said. He got to his feet and held out his hand to Harry. "Tell them." He linked his fingers with Harry's, and looked deeply into his eyes. "I don't care."
Heart racing, Draco slowly edges back towards the Floo, ready to leave in a moment's notice. He doesn’t know if the edge to her voice is sarcasm or fury, and he doesn’t want to be around to find out. The women Harry keeps in his company have a mean right hook.
The silver fox stares back at him, waiting patiently for him to feed it a message, it’s tail swaying back and forth in the air like his braid used to.
Parkinson smirks into her robes and Malfoy stares him down with a piercing grey glare. Ron visibly swallows and shifts in discomfort under the intensity of Malfoy’s unblinking stare. He steps forward, a sly smirk on his face when Ron wisely takes a step back.
And admittingly it was hard not to, seeing that Malfoy was rather striking as a girl, but he always had been a handsome bloke too. Really, Malfoy was attractive to Harry no matter what gender he was.
In some ways, Draco almost feels bad for her. He knew what it was like to fall for Harry’s charms and for your secret affections to be unreciprocated. Pansy and Blaise have heard hundreds of soliloquies about him throughout the years, and his were far worse than Kacia’s sly commentary. To this day he still doesn’t know how they managed to stay friends with him.
“Are you okay? You look awful.” He doesn’t mean it as an insult, just a fact. Malfoy did look awful. Still naturally pretty, but awful all the same.
Draco walks hand in hand with Scorpius into the school, feeling calmer than he has in years. The miracle of a Calming Draught was to thank for that. If he has to speak to over fifty squirming students and a dozen parents for the Career Day event the PTA organized, he wanted to ensure that he wouldn’t lose his shite and embarrass Scorpius before the year was out.
Pansy Parkinson is pacing around the tail end of the corridor, clearly having heard about the potion’s accident. When she sees Malfoy, her eyes and mouth widen at the same time before she breaks out into hysterical laughter.
“Harry…” Draco moves closer, the heat of Harry’s body pulling him in. He’s just close enough to reach his hand out and graze his lapel with his fingertips when the door slams open. They both jump as Terry Boot enters the room, smelling like cigarette smoke; his booming voice and joyful aura diminishing the heavy air that previously surrounded them.
“Mr. Malfoy please show some sense of decorum,” Professor McGonagall huffs as if she can’t quite believe that Malfoy, of all people, was making a scene. “We understand that this is an undesired outcome—”
He shrugs. “You try telling Draco Malfoy that you want to be his friend. I’d bet anyone would get nervous.”
“I am not,” he growls stubbornly. He lifts his nose in the air with that same snobbish curl of his mouth that Harry was slowly beginning to grow fonder of the more time he spent with him. “I swear Potter if you ever accuse me of doing something so undignified like that again I’ll hex your bollocks off.” Harry opens his mouth to snap back a wry retort but Draco gives him a look that tells him to either drop it or suffer the consequences.
“Oh please, do keep it up,” Malfoy snickers, not caring to look at either of their faces. “I could play this game
Harry’s hair is so soft, gliding between his fingers with such glorious ease. He keeps speaking in a low, soft voice, letting the words glide off his tongue like the self-made tides in the fountain.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Hermione demands. Harry gulps, realizing that he still had Malfoy’s hair in his hand and was still on top of him in an offensive position. He feels Malfoy’s labored breathing as his chest rises and falls beneath him. Pinned down to the ground, he somehow manages to look both scared out of his wits and smug that Harry’s been caught by Hermione.
Harry hums something incoherently against his chest and Draco has to use all his strength to push a cuddly, post-orgasm Gryffindor off of his body. Harry has a loopy smile on his face when he’s placed onto his two feet. He looks a mess— his hair mussed to death, his shirt wrinkled and his flaccid cock hanging out of his black trousers. Dear Merlin, he looked a mess, but he was his mess. One that he had happily helped create.
from the norm. There’s all this pressure to produce an heir as soon as possible.” He laughs, “My father actually had made plans to arrange a marriage between Pansy and me when we were younger. I have a feeling you would hate being a Pureblood.”
And crying. And wearing pants. And clutching his midsection in agony. And speaking to Professor McGonagall after class.
“You’re… ugh, you’re such a bloody…” he pauses, unable to think of the proper word to describe him. The first word in his mind rushes out without his consent. “
“Oh Harry,” He rubs Harry’s cheek with his thumb, feeling the curve where his dimple would have appeared if he had been smiling. “You have nothing to be sorry for. I’m going to march into the Nest—”
“I guess I’m recounting this to you, Potter, because I’m one of those people that when I see a problem I fix it.” He lifts his head in the air with a refined gusto. Harry rolls his eyes into the cauldron. “While your hair is one of the few unfortunate problems in the world that I doubt I will ever be able to fix—” Harry clenches his teeth and scrubs harder. “—I can dedicate my talents to helping the poor unfortunate souls that are suffering from Doxies tyrannical rule.”
“Shut up and kiss me you prat.” Harry cups Draco’s face to bring him closer to his lips, only to have Draco’s hand cover his mouth before he can kiss him.
“Shhh, less talking. More of this—” he guides Harry’s cock towards his hole, a moan settling into his throat as Harry pushes further into him. Harry was right, it hurt and God he loves it.
He absolutely could do it too, if Londoners weren’t complete arseholes that refused to slow their fast-paced walking to help out a very cute ten year old and an exhausted father.
Blaise rubs his chin, his certified thinking face on full display. “Okay, well let’s look at it from Potter’s point of view. What he sees is an anxiety-ridden single father and a gay disaster of man still adjusting to being divorced.”
Still clinging onto hope, Draco insists that they wait a bit longer. After all, everyone runs a little late sometimes right? And it was probably harder for her seeing that she’s coming all the way from Paris. She’ll come, he knows she will.
31 doesn’t feel that old when in the presence of her. He's nowhere near as grown as he pretends he is. “Molly.” He was suddenly very aware of this house, it’s history, his mistakes. He lets out a raggedy breath as he feels the weight of every bad thing he’s ever done closing in on him the longer he stares into her awaiting gaze. He wishes Harry was here but he has to do this on his own. “I want to tell you that… I’m so, so sorry. For everything I did, with the war, with your son—”
“Oh my god it’s true, Merlin it’s true!” She throws her head back and laughs loudly. “I’m going to pee, I swear I’m going to piss myself!”
Then Ginny, Luna, and James showed up, destroying the tranquil tolerance of the house. Both Ginny and James are wearing similar sour-faces as they entered from the Floo. The hand of Ginny’s that Luna isn’t holding twitches at her side, her thin fingers drumming against her thigh in barely contained anger. Draco wishes he had checked his wall this morning because he was about eighty percent sure that some astronomical event was arousing already existing intense emotions in everyone. Only Luna, who looked as centered as ever, seemed to be immune to it.
“No way mate. She’s still up the diff with me about my comments from last week. I’ve been trying to apologize but I don’t think it would be wise for either of us to ask for her help right now. Especially if it pertains to Malfoy and his huge tits.” He slaps his forehead. “Aw geez, I did it again didn’t I? Maybe Mione’s right and I am a sexist pig.” He gives himself another slap on the head as punishment.
He waits, curious, patient, and achingly still for him to continue. Harry Potter could do anything. Sometimes. If he wanted to. Maybe with Granger’s help too.
His 31 year old boyfriend tugs at his braid as they walk into the Ministry, batting at it and making it swish behind his back like a cat with a toy.
“So,” his mother says, eyeing Draco with a haughty little smile. She spoons her plum tea methodically. “I see you have finally decided to do something about Harry Potter.”
Harry laughs, a breathy whooshing sound. Malfoy was gay. For some reason, that knowledge made a tiny part of him alight with hope. He feels honored that he shared that with him; maybe that afternoon in Slytherin had paid off.
A heavy sigh escapes Harry’s tired body. “He was angry. Then sad. Then angry again.” His arms wrap around Draco’s waist, and he can feel him smiling into his collarbone. “But I took your advice and told him about my PTSD. He told me that he
to say to his son before he’s gone forever. No, not forever. He could see him again in eight hours. Eight. Long. Hours. Sweet Salazar Slytherin,
Somehow, Harry still manages to look imposing even in the flames. “That’s the thing, you’ve never asked. If you did, I would have said yes.” He rolls his eyes. Harry says that, but he doesn’t know Pansy and Blaise beyond his rudimentary knowledge of them in school. They could be vicious, especially when it came to him. “Draco, Hermione and Ron are a big part of my life and I want you to meet them.”
Bleedin’ Potter is here, looking highly amused by Draco’s flustered sputtering. The tip of that legendary scar peaks out through the fringe of his black hair and he wonders what fib Potter tells Muggles when they see it.
He sputters, trying to comprehend how that was even possible. Knowing Harry, he probably saw it as a moral injustice that needed to immediately be rectified.
“Draco! Hello, how are you?” She furrows her brows, inspecting his sweaty face with concerned brown eyes. “Are you alright? You look a bit peaky—”
“Ah well,” Harry says at last, yawning and stretching into the air. Draco salivates. “It’s been real nice talking to you Terry but I have to finish marking these papers. Malfoy here has been itching to know Scorpius’ marks, so I best get to it. I’ll see you at the next PTA meeting, yeah?”
Draco Malfoy was evil. He already knew this but Merlin, sometimes it was baffling remembering just how evil the git was. He was evil and gorgeous and worst of all he
He lifted up the covers, ready to tease Draco for continuing his ‘experimenting’ nearly three weeks after the Yule Ball. What he wasn’t prepared for was a very male Draco Malfoy beaming up at him.
Draco feels some of the nervousness in his body disappear. He had been so worried… “Oh,” he breathes, “Of course it is, love.”
It still feels weird having Potter know that about it. No, it wasn’t his deepest, darkest secret and no was it something he was particularly ashamed of but it was rather intimate knowledge. Knowledge that not even his former wife was privy to. Despite his attraction to him, the fact that the person Draco at one point considered a vile nemesis now knows such an intimate detail about him was unnerving.
“Yes,” I snap, exasperated. “Okay, she’s old. But she’s mine, and she’s flyable. My Godfather bought her for me.”
“Malfoy. Have you seen Andy around?” I ask him as politely as I could. His eyes go wide for a second and then his eyebrow goes up.
I am quaking like a leaf. This is it. Finally, after all this time, I’m going to do it, with none other than Harry Potter. My breath is shallow, and I can't take my eyes off him. He removes his watch and places it on top of a chest of drawers that matched the rest of the room, and removes his jacket placing it on a chair. He is dressed in his white linen shirt and jeans. He is heart-stoppingly beautiful. His black unruly hair is even more of a mess than usual, and his shirt is hanging out - his green eyes bold and dazzling. He steps out of his Converse shoes and reaches down and takes his socks off individually. Harry Potter’s feet….wow…..what is it about naked feet? Turning, he gazes at me, his expression soft.
I glance back over to Harry Potter and he is watching us like a hawk. He’s frowning and his mouth is a hard line. He’s gone from a weirdly attentive customer to someone entirely different. He’s gone cold and distant.
“Nia I’m so sorry you had to go through that. But I think we can explain what happened. You see, 6 years ago there was a big war in the wizarding world. The biggest anyone had seen….” me and Draco each take turns telling Nia about the war and everything that happened. After we had finished Nia stood up and spoke quietly.
“What do you want to go on next, cub?” I ask Teddy. He thinks about it for a minute and then his eyes go wide with excitement.
“But if you work so hard, what do you do to chill out?” He smiles at this and reveals his brilliant white teeth. I stop breathing because wow he really is beautiful. It’s not fair and nobody should be this good looking.
“Yes, it is a simple butternut squash soup with chilli and crème fraîche.” I continue to stare and he smirks. “It’s nothing, I just wanted to cook for you.” He looks down now and blushes slightly.
“Like the name?” I say and put my hand on his belly. “I know your family goes for constellations and Leo is my star sign. Which I didn’t know until I looked up the name.  So I just thought it would be nice.” He looks down at his ring and I answer his unspoken question. “Yes that’s why I got your ring done like that. This baby has brought us closer than ever so I just thought he should be a part of this engagement. But if you don’t like the name I can get you a new ring.” He kisses me then to shut me up I think.
“It’s a beautiful city,” Luna says a bit louder. “Harry, you should take Draco to Paris,” Luna states firmly. I sink down further, but what comes out of his mouth surprises me.
15.13   The Submissive accepts the Dominant as his master, with the understanding that he is now the property of the Dominant, to be dealt with as the Dominant pleases during the Term generally but specifically during the Allotted Times and any additional agreed allotted times.
“Thinking about it no, I haven’t seen him since he was arguing with Ginny when we came in.” She looks over to Ginny but Rons not there so she just shrugs and yawns. Then falls into silence as the rest of the house is loud.
I walk towards the bed and run my hands down one of the intricately carved posts. The post is very sturdy, definitely got some magic running  through it.
“You silly boy. What would I do if you weren’t here? Teddy wouldn’t have a godfather then. That’s someone else he would grow up without.” She says and takes my hand.
I am panting and vaguely hear the rip of foil. Very slowly he eases into me and starts to move. Ohh…..shit. The feeling is sore and sweet and bold and gentle all at once.
“Just keeping it real, Dray. The whole package - looks good. You’ll have him eating out of your hand.”
“Ow Draco what the…” I turn round to frown at him but instead I see his frightened face from before. “Hey, it's okay. I’m here.” I take his hand off my arm and keep it in my hand.
“No cub, come on. Your grandma wants to spend time with you today. How about you come to our house next week and you can help us clean and then we can all go on our brooms? How does that sound?” I ask him while bending on one knee.
His cool fingered trail languidly across my belly. My skin is oversensitive, my hips flex automatically, and the now-warmer liquid from my navel seeps over my belly. Harry moves quickly, lapping it up with his tongue, kissing, biting me softly, sucking.
“It’s okay, I got you.” I go in front of him and he holds my shoulders. Then he bends forward and bawls.
I take a deep breath and stand up. I wipe my face and head for the stairs. I am just going to chalk this up to experience, move on and concentrate on my exams.
It’s almost embarrassing to witness. They really love each other deeply, and I wonder for a brief moment what it must be like to grow up with parents who are in love.
“Hey! I take offence to that. Of course I was going to do it for you. What are slytherin besties for, if not to do interviews with smug CEO bastards when your best friend is ill.” She giggles and I kiss her cheek. “Did you eat something? And take the rest of that potion? You look better.” I say, changing the subject.
“But there is just something about you and I am finding it more and more difficult to stay away. I think you may have already figured that out though.”
We finally leave the house with Leo in his pram, and Apparate to Andys. We walk up to the front door with me pushing the pram and Draco hanging onto my arm. He knocks on the door and Lottie answers.
“I’m not a bloody hippogriff, I can't possibly eat all this food.” My eyes track all the plates on the table and feel almost sick even thinking about it.
“I don't remember reading about nipple clamps in the Bible. Perhaps you were taught from a modern translation.”
“Got here early so I could help cook. Mollys teaching me all her recipes.” She says with a genuine smile. “Rons out back I think, but I’m not certain.”
“SO WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT FACE BEFORE WITH TEDDY?” Draco shouts over from his broom. I roll my eyes because I didn’t think he’d bring that up now.
“Well, how was it? I couldn't stop thinking about you, after Theo left, that is.” She grins mischievously.
“Yes, otherwise you will burn like Ron over there.” Draco says to him, pointing to Ron lying in the sun already.
He smiles briefly at the warm applause - even Pansy is clapping - then he resumes his seat. He doesn't look my way and I’m off-kilter trying to assimilate this new information about him.
We apparate back home and I go get Teddy’s coat that he left here a couple of weeks ago, and Draco takes Leo to get his coat and booties.
The Submissive will ensure he achieves a minimum of seven hours’ sleep a night when he is not with the Dominant.
“You got some good stuff Dray, well done. Though I can’t believe you didn’t take him up on the offer to show you around. It was obvious he wanted to spend some more time with you.” She gives me a cheeky look and I just groan at her. When I think about it though I put my head back down quickly because I can feel myself blushing. Surely that can’t be the real reason he wanted to show me around. I bite my lip and try not to think about it.
“Harry, why is it that when I told my mother I was pregnant this morning, that she didn’t act all that surprised?” Shit! “You see, when I asked her about it she said she already knew. And when I asked her how, she said she could just tell. But I don’t believe that, so would you like to tell me the truth Harry?”
“Well you’ll know the gender by Saturday so you’ll only be arguing about one genders names instead of two.” She laughs and we chuckle half heartedly back.
“Yes, in fact, Ron was 3 weeks overdue. I felt like cutting him out myself.” She says and we all laugh.
“I don't want to talk to one of your ex-girlfriends or ex-boyfriends….slaves…..subs….. whatever you call them.”
It’s been 2 months since the end of the war. People are grieving for their lost loved ones. Shopkeepers are having to start from scratch with their businesses. Hogwarts is trying to be rebuilt. And children are learning to grow up without their parents. This includes my 3 month old godson Teddy Lupin.
With his face clean and acting as if nothing has happened, we make our way back to the living room. I see Ron then, he’s sitting with Hermione now, where me and Draco and Lucy were sat not 15 minutes ago. He waves at us and we wave back. Just as we were about to go over though, Molly comes out the kitchen and announces the food is ready. Everyone gets up and the parents scoop up their children.
“I’m always good!” He huffs and turns his back to me. I chuckle and grab hold of him. Then I start tickling him again and he breaks out in hysterics.
“Well you could have text, or called, or bloody owled.” I was too drunk for this conversation, “stay here, i'll be back in a minute.” I signed and I stumbled past him and up the stairs to the bathroom. I took a sobering potion, washed my face, brushed my teeth and put some more pants on as my others were clearly back downstairs and I was not going back down there without pants. As I came back downstairs, straightening my tie, I could see Draco was still in the doorway to the living room.
Draco licks the back of my ear and thrusts his hips forward. I fall forward a bit and save myself on the door, where I’ve just hung my coat.
“I can make an exception, or maybe combine the two, we’ll see. I really want to make love to you. Please, come to bed with me. I want our arrangement to work, but you really need to have some idea what you’re getting yourself into. We can start your training tonight - with the basics. This doesn't mean I've come over all heart and flowers; it's a means to an end, but one that I want, and hopefully you do, too.” His gaze is intense.
“Draco deserves a break,” she says pointedly at Harry. Why is she so antagonistic towards him? What is her problem?
I pout petulantly as I plug my iPod earbuds in, blast music, and sit down at my small desk to reread the contract and make comments.
I climb slowly out of bed and notice that my jeans and shirt are hanging on the wardrobe door. Where are my boxers? I check beneath the chair. Nothing. Then I remember - he squirrelled them away in the pocket of his jeans. I flush at the memory, after he….I can’t even bring myself to think about it, he was so - barbarous. I frown.
“I love it. Harry Potter, you are such a romantic.” We laugh and we kiss again. Then he places his hand next to mine on his belly and talks to the baby. “How about that Leo?” Then he pauses for a second and looks at me. “Leo James potter?” He asks shyly.
“Of course.” I say and she gets up and comes over. She smiles at him too and then picks him up. He starts crying and then quiets down after a minute. Katie places him on the bed and takes his clothes off to check him and casts a few diagnostic spells,
“Fine. I’m going home, I just wanted to know you were safe.” Before he can do anything I go over to him and take his hand.
The next hour passes slowly and painfully. But then it’s time. “Right, I’m going to floo her!” I tell him and slowly get from behind him.
The room had seemed to freeze when Katie had walked in, but now I could hear Draco’s breathing getting heavier and heavier. I turn round, facing away from Katie, and take his face in my hands.
The Submissive will not enter into any sexual relations with anyone other than the Dominant. The Submissive will conduct himself in a respectful and modest manner at all times. He must recognise that his behaviour is a direct reflection on the Dominant. He shall be held accountable for any misdeeds, wrongdoings, and misbehaviour committed when not in the presence of the Dominant.
Draco is curled up against my side and I stare from him to Leo. I love these two boys with all my heart and wouldn’t change my life for anything. It’s so perfect I could cry, which I have been doing for the past 2 hours. I gave Leo his bottle about 5 minutes ago and so I place him in the Moses basket next to me and lie down next to Draco. He shifts and squints his eyes open.
I must have fallen asleep eventually because the next thing I know I’m being woken by little kisses on my face and fingers twirling my hair. I open my eyes and realise it's quite dark, it must be nearly 9 o clock if not after. I look up to Draco and realise he's lying down and I’m basically on top of him. I blush a bit and say morning.
“Yeah I did, didn’t I. I’m just really craving it.” He keeps looking through the bag, but he wont find any. Then Nia laughs.
“Why are there no wipes in this bag? I thought you said everything was packed?” He says in a snotty tone.
I was having a wonderful dream involving a certain blonde, when I was rudely interrupted by someone shaking me awake. I snapped awake and shot up, just to slam into someone else’s head. The pain was instant and stung like a bitch.
“Edward Lupin! Apologise right now for scaring your uncle Draco! That was very silly.” Andromeda’s tells him off coming into the room.
“I will be packing for my move to London. We couldn't get much farther apart if we tried. Besides, I do have a date this evening.”
“You mean the things you were forced to do as a child. No, I don’t think they are Draco. Come on, we have to go. I'll be with you the whole time okay.” He nods and takes my hand.
“Thanks! Hermione dropped some extra books off a few days ago and I’ve been reading up on how to correctly cast spells and charms, among other things.”
“The first thing we are going to do is guess the baby name. We obviously won't find this out until after the babies are born, but it’s fun and might give the parents some ideas.” He accios a white board over and a pen and then looks around. I see Draco discreetly turn his ring around so nobody can see the stars. “Who’s first?”  George asks everyone.
“WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN?!” Then something smashed above my head and I ducked. “I’ve looked everywhere for you! You said you’d been at the house, so i went there and you weren’t fucking there! I’ve been worrying all day! I even called Hermione but she hadn’t heard off you.” Draco was still shouting but seemed to have calmed down a tiny bit knowing I was okay.
Potter jumps, looking up from the papers on his desk with bewildered eyes that soften in relief when they lay on Draco. Big mistake. Those same eyes tense up again when Potter realizes that Draco was fuming.
By the time the troll and the princess have learned the art of sharing not a single youthful eye is open. Potter stands up, walking on tip toes around the sleeping bodies. Draco does the same, both of them silently migrating to a tiny desk in the back of the classroom. He’s considering putting up a
But Harry’s eyes are so bright and waiting, that the impulse to give in wins out. “Well, there’s my name of course.”
Potter, not noticing that Draco was politely waiting for him to be settled down to eat, crams two pieces of bacon into his mouth at the same time on his way into his seat, demolishing the food much like Weasley. Draco shudders.
The pretty, pink-haired waitress comes and places their ordered food in front of them. Ron digs in without remorse, slobbering over his plate of steak and potatoes worse than Harry. He points to the soup Draco has in front of him. “That’s all?” He shakes his head. “Couldn’t be me.”
“Definitely,” Potter nods, a fond smile on his face, “He adores any kind of music. If he wasn’t as tone-deaf as Ginny and I am, I think he would rather be a singer than a wizard.”
Potter finally finishes, with the tired parents unused to the return of their typical work week dispersing the second he bids them all a goodbye. Draco hastily stands up, preparing to be the first out of the room.
“We have a history,” he replies simply, keeping his voice measured so that Scorpius wouldn’t be tempted to press him for more information. He doesn’t need to know that Draco tortured Potter throughout school and how it seems that Potter was finally deciding that now was a perfect time for payback.
“Good, now that that’s settled will you hold my darling for me, darling?” She holds out Marcéline and he takes her without hesitation, cuddling her to his chest like he used to do with Scorpius. Her tiny, curled hand yanks at his hair with surprising strength. Lucky for her, she favored her father’s dark, elegant looks and hopefully in personality too. Pansy heaves herself out of the chair, swatting away Draco’s hand when he tries to help her up like a good best friend should.
Potter’s still staring at him, though he’s doing his best to keep his attention on the children that are currently climbing on him. A smaller, red-haired girl that just screamed
The second he stepped foot into the dining area, all eyes—both wizards and witches alike—were on him. He looked like a model that stepped straight out of the front pages of
He doesn’t believe him but they really do. Strung across Potter’s back, he finds a new line of sight. This is the angle he wants to look at them every night, the right angle. Potter’s caught him, literally, in just the right place.
“Gee thanks,” Harry coughs out when Malfoy finally lets go of him with a final shove to his shoulders and backs away. There was something seriously wrong with him. Besides the fact that he’s a literal Death Eater.
He stands up, shoving the papers back the center of his chest with such force, Draco feels his breath leave his body for a fraction of a second.
“Liquid courage,” he mutters into his glass. He sets it down, the brown liquid sloshing in the crystal cup. Draco buries his face in his hands. “Look, I know this is going to be weird because of your,” he waves a clumsy hand around, “
Draco would say that having an email made him feel like a real adult, but it only makes him realize how little he actually knows about the Muggle world. What other secret Muggle things was he missing out on? He leaves the library with a new determination to learn every gadget and gidget and widget Muggles use these days. An email was a start, but as Draco enters the school that Friday for the first PTA meeting, he wonders if he should get that book of faces thing as well. Who knows, it might help Scorpius.
“Don’t you think you deserve better?” Draco laughs coldly. He was done discussing this anymore. He was exhausted. “You don’t listen to anyone,” Harry says. “Hell, you don’t even listen to yourself most of the time.”
He leans his head up against the tree, exhausted from his searching. This was nice. As much as he loved the heat, the cold December air was refreshing. Christmas is coming up soon and with it, the Yule Ball.
Draco comes through, landing in Harry’s living room on unsteady feet. His body freezes mid-wobble when his eyes land on Ginevra Weasley who was spooning an exuberant amount of sugar into her cup and blinking in surprise at the sight of Draco looking frumpled and crazed in her living room.
He gags. How can he not see it? “Those comics are awful!” He points to the ugly pile of ash sitting atop of burnt grass. “How do you think it starts, Potter? Those books just further perpetuate a negative view of Muggles and by extension Muggleborns.” Potter blinks, his eyes comedically wide behind his glasses. “It seems insignificant, but it
It was odd seeing the one empty seat in Transfigurations and even odder to see it in Potions. Snape scowled at him more often, as if he was blaming him for Malfoy’s sudden disappearance. Maybe he should. Maybe Malfoy had taken ill from a side effect from the potion and was hiding away until he was better. Maybe he was so dreadfully embarrassed about being seen as a girl that he had committed himself to stay hidden. He sure seemed embarrassed when Parkinson howled in laughter at the sight of him.
“Sure.” He neatly collects the worn, nubby crayons on the desk and places them back into their respective boxes. Potter has to keep his hands busy, Draco’s noticed. He’s always fidgeting, or doing odd little dances, or worse,
hurt anymore, but Merlin, is there a limit? Nothing he presents to the board is enough for them. He’s working on his twenty-ninth time of being rejected and it’s starting to eat at him.
Though his voice is now light and feminine, the underlying hatred still remains. There was always a cold ruthlessness laced into his tone, reserved only for Harry. It was used specifically to get under his skin; a taunting, teasing thing that made him lose all sense of morality and tact.
“Malfoy.” Windsor's beard wiggles as he sniffs. Draco jumps at the sound of his voice. “For you.” A thick piece of paper is gripped in his hands. Heart in his throat, Draco steps forward, his body light as air as Windsor waves the parchment paper in front of his nose.
Curious, Hermione tentatively places hers on as well, her face breaking out into the same, content pleasure as her husband’s. “This is...very thoughtful of you Draco. Thank you.”
Ron’s eyes widened and he looked positively petrified. “No! No, no, no I didn’t mean it like that Mione! I just mean—”
On careful feet, he sneaks up behind the both of them, his eyes narrowing at the two hunched over figures hissing about him, not knowing the object of their gossiping is standing right behind them.
Ginevra rolls her eyes, flipping the page of the paper with a flick of her finger. “I’m sorry, were you two
Even when he’s seated, he’s about as stiff as a board, his hands tied behind his back. Draco sighs, deciding to dive straight in. “I suppose I ought to just say it like it is. I will admit that I didn’t have such a great day today, but it was absolutely not your fault. It never is. And I know you were having a private conversation between you and Albus, but I want to tell you, that if you ever feel like something is bothering you, you will always have my permission to speak freely. I will never hold it against you for being honest.” Scorpius nods numbly. “With that being said, may I see it?”
he mouthed. For all their differences, Draco understands. It was hard to deny your children’s requests.
His mind flashes to the dirty sidewalk that left stains on the knees of his trousers after he keeled over from lack of oxygen. Tired. He was tired. And admittingly at bit nervous. But he made it through, just like all of the other shite he’s been through. The most important part of any hardship was to make it to the other side.
In a smooth, steady voice, Potter recounts the story of a lonely princess trapped in a tower with her trusty terrier and stubborn steed. She devotes all her time to learning and reading books from the vast library in the castle, only to one day notice that the abundance of books in her library isn’t so abundant anymore and that every day, a new book disappears.
“That’s because he is. Astoria and I never really got along very well, at least in Scorpius’ eyes. There was a time when I would consider her a partner, a friend even but that was before…” He stops himself. He wasn’t beholden to Potter. He certainly did not need to inform him of Astoria’s neglect of Scorpius. Nor did he have to tell him about her unfaithfulness while he allowed himself to suffer the pitfalls of being married to a person of the wrong gender. And he certainly didn’t need the added embarrassment of telling Potter that he was gay.
The last week of September, a letter from Jaspers’ uncle comes in about the research position studying the Draconid Meteor Shower. Above his scrawled signature is a note telling Draco to reply with his decision no later than October 9th.
Besides, even if there was any validity to the horoscope didn’t matter much. Harry Potter was extremely annoying, but he was simultaneously the most compassionate person Draco knew. So showing grace won’t be an issue for him, regardless of the situation.
He lets out a horribly surprised gasp when he feels Potter hug him from behind, squishing Lily as he does.
Sensing his disapproval, Ana assures him, “He’s actually a really good boy Mr. Mal— Draco. Sorry.” Draco twists his lip up, unconvinced. People who smile like that never lead to anything good for him. They were too charming, too good, to open that people are always far too blind to see their true intentions.
Harry looks as if someone stunned him in the stomach, his mouth opening and closing on its own accord. “Erm… thanks?”
Another week and another gift basket is sent to his home. He’s considering whether it would be worth it telling Finley to go fuck himself through a Howler, but Draco reasons that that would only incite more baskets. Still, he’s getting very tired of
“Mmm, you wouldn’t have been able to find the clit anyways,” Draco murmurs against his lips when they pull away.
Malfoy leans over Harry’s table, smirking down at him like a cat that got the cream. Harry wrinkles his nose in an attempt to seem disgusted by Malfoy’s closeness, but he ends up getting a whiff of his enchanting perfume by accident. Ugh, he just had to smell like so enticingly edible. Fuck, it was unsettling how Malfoy knew exactly how to mess with him.
He wiggles again and Harry sucks in a sharp breath. “God I wanted this for so long, Draco. You feel so much better than I imagined.” His fingers dig painfully into Draco’s hips. “Actually everything about you is better than I imagined.”
No, he lived here now, he’s not leaving until he’s dead. “Um, excuse me, what the hell do you mean go?”
“There's a Total Eclipse occurring at 3:34 today so whatever you do, do not under any circumstances cast a heating or cooling charm for the entire day!” Draco says in a single breath. “If you cast one directly at 3:34 you’ll just be asking to land yourself in St. Mungo’s. Anything at all that will control the temperature or the atmosphere just don’t do it!”
“Watch the water,” he orders. He runs his hand through Harry’s hair as he obediently watches, the soft locks resisting his brushing and returning to their former position. He wishes he had a Calming Draught to neutralize the naturally occurring tension in his body, but this works too.
The sound of a body falling to the floor and several loud curses jump him awake. He grabs his wand, ready to hex the blood out of whoever torn him from his slumber.
Research, yes. He can talk about that. Draco begins to explain his research when a loud clap jostles him. The table next to them bursts into song, wishing a happy birthday to a smiling blonde girl with pigtails who had to be no older than Lily’s age, causing him to lose his entire train of thought. Why did he think this was a good idea? They should have done this in the comfort of Harry’s home, not among a crowded group of strangers who were staring at him, Merlin, he swore they were staring at him. He begins to sweat.
Nuzzling against the soft fabric of Harry’s jumper he smells the earthy scent of woods on his skin and embedding in the stitches of his clothing.
Draco stops short, the toe of his boot catching on an uneven crack in a sidewalk. When his heart lurches, he doesn’t know if it’s from the stumble or from nervousness— though he has a pretty good guess. “Why?”
Sausages for breakfast meant another round of perverted sausage sucking. Every day that they’ve served it at breakfast and Malfoy has been at the Slytherin table, he would watch as Malfoy repeatedly shoves it in and out his mouth. It was infuriating at first, downright embarrassing afterward, and later grew to an expected pastime. He’s realized that most of the Slytherins at his table have stopped paying Malfoy any kind of attention when he does this and that it was done only to get under Harry’s skin. At this point, Malfoy was embarrassing himself more than anything. Dare he say that it was rather endearing how committed he was to annoying him?
Scorpius takes the lead and tugs them along, clearly done discussing his mother for the moment. There’ll be other questions, questions that Draco will need to learn how to answer. Questions that he probably won’t ever be able to answer. But for now, Draco can get away with an apology on her behalf.
later and Harry was finally inside Malfoy’s dorm. He winces when the heavy door slams shut behind him and watches as the lump in the green blanketed bed stirs to life.
When he’s not thinking about Malfoy, he’s thinking about Quidditch. When he’s not thinking about Quidditch, he’s stressing about his N.E.W.T.s. When he’s not stressing out about his N.E.W.T.s, he was back to thinking about Malfoy.
Sighing, he makes his way back into his office. Thirty-one was pretty young to go mad. He was hoping he made it past his Aunt Bellatrix’s age before he lost his plot like she did. Though maybe he isn’t that crazy yet, because when his fingers touch the brass doorknob of his office, a loud sound captures his attention.
Malfoy pokes his head out from around the leaves. “What is it to you?” He sneers tiredly. Even from down here, Harry can see the redness of his eyes and the black streaks of mascara smeared on his cheeks. He wants to ask if he was okay, but from the sharp glare Malfoy was giving him, he knows better than to ask.
“Bloody fuck, I probably will,” he whines, his thrusts growing erratic. “God, I love the way you sing Draco. I think about it all of the time. You have such a beautiful voice—singing and talking. It used to get on my nerves, Merlin did it work my nerves in school. All posh and nasally and whiny—”
“Oi, Parkinson!” She turns and rolls her eyes when she sees Harry behind her. Zabini raises his brow at him expectantly.
Heart pounding, he scrambles out of the bed as if the very sheets were poison and falls flat on his already sore arse in an attempt to distance himself from the undeniable truth that he was very literally surrounded by. He slept in Potter’s bed, he smelled like Potter, and from the looks of it, he even drooled a little (or a lot) on Potter’s soft white pillowcase.
Draco winces. People were beginning to stare at Scorpius’ little demonstration and giving Draco odd, narrow-eyed glances. He awkwardly smiles at them in an attempt to soothe their concerns, but it was a bit difficult easing the minds of nosy adults when a small child was screaming at you to buy some biscuits.
was the person he spent precious time agonizing over which shirt to wear and hoping that all sixty-two of Saturn’s moons were aligned for, just several hours ago.
” Harry says firmly, over Lily’s scolding reminder that Optimus Prime was pink. “We will all be wearing it tomorrow. Isn’t that right Draco?”
Harry rolls his eyes when he sees the sausages on Ron’s plate, smiling fondly to himself like a mad man. Ron and Hermione exchange a look but thankfully decide to not push the matter. They wouldn’t understand anyway.
Draco chews at his bottom lip. Harry was right. His lips still were pouty and full underneath the lip gloss. “The potion wore off.”
One of the board members clears her throat and gives him an impatient look. He’s still on his knees, scrambling for his buzzing phone on the floor. Draco gives them all apologetic smiles, grabbing his cloak and scampering out of the room as quickly as he can.
Usually, his anxiety would spike being around such a large crowd of loud, moving people. He waits, tense in his seat for his heart to speed up or his hands to shake.
With a flick of her wand, a bag of fresh carrots and cutting knife fly into her hands. She shoves the blade-covered knife in Harry’s chest and the fat bag of carrots in his. “You two can do the carrots.” She points her finger to Draco’s face. “And
Harry is more than willing to watch Scorpius, and Draco’s grateful. It’s nearly one in the morning when Draco Apparates himself back to Harry’s and either Scorpius would have been a very grumpy ten year old at the moment or Draco would have had to leave it to Blaise to calm Pansy down from her panic attack.
Draco gives a nervous chuckle that is more breath than laugh. He wraps his hands around his wrists. “Well I didn’t say all that,” he looks up at Harry from underneath his painted lashes. “But thank you, Harry. For understanding.”
“What I’m saying is, you’ve done whatever you’ve wanted to Potter for years; I don’t know why you’re acting so shy now?”
He gives her a hurried goodbye and shoves his phone in his pocket. He knows why Scorpius thinks he pushed him. Jaspers’ tarot cards went flying today in his face when he casted a simple spell on them, Galatea’s coffee scuffled away from her hands after she warmed it with a heating charm, even Draco had an unfortunate mishap with his hair with he tried to spell it back into his usual tight braid.
As though they had no time to lose, Draco hastily pulls Harry into his arms once he finds the perfect spot, which of course, is right in the middle of the floor.
He snatches his hand away with a terrifying speed. Something awful that he wouldn’t be able to take back is on the tip of his tongue, burning to be said. He holds it. For Harry’s sake and his.
“I try to do right by him but nothing I do can make up for how much I’ve messed up. Malfoys aren’t supposed to get divorced. I am. Now Scorpius thinks it's his fault and he misses his mother and I miss her too even though I shouldn’t and I just don’t
Unfortunately, his peace is interrupted when Potter’s insistent nosiness and inability to maintain a quiet atmosphere for more than five minutes at a time wins out. He hums quietly to himself and even though he hardly opens his mouth, Draco could sense he was wildly off-key to whatever song he was humming. He wasn’t kidding about being tone deaf. Draco hates himself a little more for finding his inability to carry a tune supremely endearing.
had such barbarian table manners. Malfoy’s eyes are still on him and he looks like he’s about to explode. He’s gripping his fork like a wand, his white knuckles and red face a humorous contrast.
Simple astronomy and magical theory in his eyes. Potter and Albus looked bewildered by Draco’s straightforward assessment and he frowns at their puzzled expressions. Did they not know these things?
“My mistakes are literally branded on my skin for me to see every morning. Kinda hard to ask for forgiveness when I can hardly forgive myself.” His fingers absentmindedly trace over the mark on his arm, the dark green of his nail polish a striking contrast between the black ink and his white skin.
He may be made to suck cock, but his knees were not. He begins to rise, wincing as he does. As much as he loved Harry looking down in awe at him as he sucked him off, Draco was beginning to think that he was getting a bit too old to stay on his knees for an extended period of time. Granted, 31 wasn’t that old but it was old enough to complain.
“George,” she questions, her voice sounds like she’s speaking to someone who’ll break at a moment’s notice, “what did you do?”
“Fuck, I love it when you call me that,” Harry admits in a breathy voice. Draco wrinkles his nose, pushing off his knees and rising to the door. Bloody Gryffindors and their tactlessness.
Harry races back to Gryffindor to grab his invisibility cloak and heads towards Slytherin. Classes be damned; he could always have Ron or Hermione share their notes with him.
It wasn’t so awful once his father was sentenced, but still just as pointless. He didn’t think he knew anyone in the magical community who actually celebrated the holiday. That is until Albus brought up the annual Easter dinner at the Weasley’s on the walk back from school.
She? Oh Merlin, the kid probably already had a name picked out for it since this afternoon. Damn Potter. He is a pest to their animal-free home. “I thought Albus Potter was your best friend?”
Draco slowly breathes in through his nose, out through his mouth. He could do this, it was just a silly Muggle school program, right? What was the worst that could happen?
Optimus Prime, their long tongues flicking every which way in the air. He clutches his chest. He thinks he’s going to be sick.
Green eyes stare down at him, inches apart from his own as he comes, with Draco following in a close second on his stomach. Draco vows that the next time Harry comes, it will be in his mouth.
When he pulls away, Ginny raises her brows, stunned. “Well… wow, that’s great Harry! I had this whole speech ready to tell you and what not but you figured it out yourself. Congrats.”
Warm breaths puff out against his cheek. “I wanted to tell you, I really did. But God Draco, you’re not the easiest person to talk to.”
Harry closes his eyes, his face tight as if he’s trying to ward off some bad memories. “I passed every exam except for one, the psychiatry exam.” His fingers drum against his thigh, one, two, three times before he speaks again. Then he smiles. “Believe it or not, but wars have a tendency to leave a mark.”
Stupid dimples only deepen at his threat. “Sure,” he drawls, a large grin still plastered on his face. “As a token of my appreciation, I am formally inviting you and Scorpius to a playdate, this Saturday at my house.” He bows. Draco wrinkles his nose. This is the case of a man who clearly spends too much of his time around children.
Ron presses a hand against his fluttering chest. “Hey, just let it go. It’s what I had to do and now it’s your turn. It’s over Harry.”
Attempting to inconspicuously pass on some table manners to his messy-haired breakfast companion, Draco cuts his eggs and bacon up into tiny pieces and primly eats with the same demure delicateness his mother taught him. He looks up and is rather pleased to see Potter staring intently at him.
She draws one leg up to her chest. Hermione laughs, low and soft. “See? We’re more alike than I had originally thought.” She sounds as though she still couldn’t believe it herself. “Of course I was still in denial at the time. I was trying to be supportive and I was coming around to the idea of you two together, but not by much.”
“Actually, nevermind,” he says, holding out his arm to Side Along. “Come with me, I know just the place.”
The desk squeaks, the legs scraping against the floor in protest with each of Harry’s thrusts. He grips the edges. “Shite, Harry don’t break the desk!”
“I swear to Circe—Harry Potter if you Vanish my clothing or rip them because you're too bloody randy to take them off like a normal person, I will
Pansy’s eyes widen and she nods slowly in understanding. “Ah, I see. So… how did he take to… you know,” she coughs, “
“It better not be,” Malfoy grumbles. Snape shoots him a vicious glare and he glares right back, unyielding to his dark look. Eventually, Snape wins the battle of death stares between them because Malfoy slumps down further into the chair, pouting as he grumbles that his father will most
“Sod off,” Harry retorts, his eyes still glued to Draco’s hard cock. “It’s just… Ron and I used to joke back in school that you were a dick because you were trying to… well, make up for your dick. Clearly we were wrong.” He licks his lips. “Very wrong.”
Draco blinks. Breathes—in through his nose, out through his mouth. Remembers who he was here for, not what he was here to prove.
They all wave goodbye as the train begins to move, and Ginny tuts in annoyance when Albus sticks his body way too far out of the window to wave to them. Draco has the distinct feeling that they will be receiving a lot of written notes from McGonagall.
He sighs, exhausted at the thought of the next nine hours his best friends have to endure. “There’ll be another Zabini running around soon, so that’s always great.” Groaning, he adds, “And my kitchen floor will need to be thoroughly Scourgified tomorrow.”
Draco glares at the reflection of his glass in the sunlight. “This is why I asked you to put your heterosexuality aside,” he mutters. “I can’t just ask Potter to shag me, Blaise. It doesn’t work like that.”
He’s 31, and Draco never thought his life by now would consist of dodging gift baskets from Finley Greengrass, detesting spaghetti, and wanting to shag Harry Potter. While the fantasy of shagging him may not be new, the idea that he actually
George laughs, placing his arm around the arch of the empty chair, and leaning into it as if he were sharing an inside joke with the phantom body sitting there. Draco covers his mouth with a napkin. He wasn’t going to vomit. He was going to hyperventilate. “It will help grow us as a family,” he swears. “For example, Percy, what is your most embarrassing moment in school?”
He opens his mouth, the shape of another smart remark forming before closing it abruptly. Harry’s entranced, he's never seen Draco back down from a chance at taunting him.
The entire board looks at him with various levels of resentment and annoyance. Stalls Windsor wiggles his whiskery beard, his mouth set into a thin line underneath. Vera Galatea sucks her teeth, tsking at his clumsiness and exchanging crossed looks with the other two disgruntled board members beside her. The witch presenting only looks at him, her wide-set brown eyes peeking out from underneath the fringe of her large afro. Her eyes dart nervously, unsure of whether to continue or just wait for him to shut the sodding thing up.
He doesn’t quite know how to respond to Harry’s openness that he specifically asked for. He focuses on finding the brightest star he can to avoid answering. Every time he says the word ‘PTSD’ he feels a little part of him cringe.
Nightmares. Waking and sleeping. He’s no stranger to them of course, but nightmares aren’t usually accompanied by panic attacks as well.
Draco abruptly stands up, his chair scraping loudly on the tile and his hands flying to his hair. “On my kitchen floor?!”
“A stupid question,” he admonishes irritatedly. “What in the world makes you think I’ll do something like that anyway?”
Draco would probably let him do anything he wants with his body, but after ten years, he thinks he’s earned the right to have this one request fulfilled.
She takes a deep breath. “I want to apologize. I’m sorry for cheating. For not being there when you and Scorpius needed me. You have always been able to handle so much, sometimes I don’t know how you are able to get out of bed in the morning while I can’t.”
His skin feels like it's being pricked by a thousand tiny needles wielding themselves into his pores. Harry was right, he does deserve better than what he’s giving himself. “I’ll go. To the Mind Healer again.” He takes a breath, his nails clawing into his folded arms. “And I’ll consider taking the potions.”
it. Silence was a better alternative to pretending that he cared about his mother’s parties or his father’s teachings. But then Scorpius came along, and Draco suddenly didn't know how to let go.
The thing about Potter was that he made Draco lose his head at every turn. It was a natural reaction to sneer, smirk, and snarl at him no matter how old they were. The worst part was, Potter knew this, and he used it to his advantage whenever he could.
“Just gonna…” He sinks down to his knees on the sidewalk, hand still clutched on his chest as he tries to ground himself. Several people look horrified as they walk by and their concern only seems to make everything worse. “Just for a moment.”
He’s always wanted a little girl, enough to consider going through another ten years of pretending to be straight. Though, when watching Lily, it was probably best that he didn’t have a girl. It would be far too easy to spoil her rotten. The world didn’t need to deal with another era of a spoiled Malfoy.
so that they don’t disturb their sleep, but Draco has a feeling they’ll sleep through an earthquake.
Draco snarls, yanking his hand away at the insulting implication. “Don’t be daft Potter. I’ll always come back for you.”
He’s free to spend the nights as he chooses now. With Scorpius and Albus gone, Harry’s bedroom becomes theirs in the span of a week. It’s better this way. Draco’s learned that he really can’t be in an empty home by himself, because he doesn’t think he can deal with this new development in his life alone.
He said it. Clear as day. Anyone would understand Draco’s train of thought. He said it while staring dead into Draco’s eyes, with his hand so close to his that Draco could feel the smooth shell of his fingernail on his thumb.
He still doesn’t quite know how to reconcile this image of Potter—a charming, English teacher that puts children to sleep with his stories and will gladly let a child paint a flower on his cheek— to the other version of Potter. The one that revels in his discomfort, pushes his buttons until he is aching from anger, that will show him up unprompted just because he can. The one that sliced his chest open all those years ago, leaving a trail of blood in his wake.
He has to admit, he was sorely disappointed to find that this supposed ferris wheel actually has no fairies that Draco can see, and instead was a large, spinning circle that made his head hurt just by looking at it.
“Good grief, you’re a mess Draco. I can’t take you anywhere,” Harry laughs when Draco scurries over to another graphic showing an exploding supernova. He captures Draco’s wrist in his hand and looks at his black watch. “Shite, but we really have to go.”
“I bet you get A’s on all of your exams, don’t you Scorp?” Pansy asks. She shoves a large scoop of wild rice into her mouth. “Perss of Daddy bein’ the teacher’s pet, eh?” Her mouthful of rice doesn’t stop her from making a joke at his expense.
Harry loops him back into his arms, this time forgoing his shyness and burying his hand in Draco’s hair. “Alright, let's start with something simpler. Tell me, Draco Malfoy, what is your favorite color?”
Scorpius puts his hands on his hips like his mother did when she was cross with him. “Are you laughing at me?” His tiny scowl is so adorable that Draco can’t help but to laugh once more. Perhaps there was a bit of him in there too.
He doesn’t realize that Scorpius was still talking about that damned Puff. “It was so cute Dad, can I have one? Please?” He clasps his hands together, putting on his best puppy dog pout. Unfortunately for him, Draco doesn’t much like dogs or Pygmy Puffs.
“I know that’s right; Merlin, Draco, I love this kid!” She punctuates each word with a kiss on Scorpius’ head. Pansy stops tickling him to smush his cheeks, causing him to grin wildly. He’s never received much female attention, so Pansy’s doting should be good for him. “I could just eat you up like a crumb cake!”
Potter. A bit of self-perseveration is not indicative of someone being scared.” He lifts his nose in the air. “Though it’s not like you would know anything about that would you?”
He curls his hand into a fist, biting on the knuckles as the deep-seated anger he thought he had buried away resurfaces. He’s been the villain for years, what’s the difference now?
“You’re shaking,” Harry points to Draco’s trembling fingers, to which he shoves behind his back with a scowl. His already flushed face reddens considerably in the dim light.
“Anything else you fancy sharing Malfoy?” Potter places his hands on his hips, looking disturbingly pleased by Draco’s shaking and discomfort. Pink lips spoiled with arrogance curl at the edges when his leg starts trembling.
stares back at him, and the memory of first reading his favorite childhood book rushes back to him in a stream of nostalgia and buried anger. You don’t forget your first favorite book, and this one has aged well in his memories.
He didn’t understand what the fascination was with informing him about magical grasses until he mentioned it to Ginny while they were studying together in the common room. He told her about the mix up between Goosegrass and Knotgrass the day of the potions accident, Malfoy’s insistent ranting about the grasses in Slytherin, and his odd fixation with the cherry lollipops Hermione gifts to him. When he was finished, she shut her textbook and rolled her eyes so hard it looked like it hurt.
Draco turns his head and coughs into his elbow to avoid bursting out into laughter. Say what you want about Areum, but she is without a doubt the funniest person in the room. She’s like Pansy if Pansy had more self-control. Kacia’s pale face has gone paler as she tries to backtrack on her ‘very not homophobic’ statements, but she’s cut off by Harry’s booming voice starting the meeting.
He winces, pulled out the spell Potter and his firm looking hands have put him under. “Oh no. I would but I can’t. I’d reckon you wouldn’t want my help anyway, seeing that I’m a dead disaster making anything that isn’t spaghetti.”
He suddenly feels very, very ignorant. Should he have known? It’s not like he wasn’t sucking a sausage every day at breakfast or anything.
Ginny’s on him like a hawk, swooping down from the air with practiced ease. “Harry! What did you do?!”
He snaps his head up, less no more centered than he did before he started pacing his breaths. All eyes are on him, various levels of concerned curiosity laced in them. “Yes?”
He wipes his mouth with the back of his mouth and stumbles back when he finally comes to his senses. Harry gapes at him, suddenly worried that he somehow went too far or did something to offend him.
“I charge a reasonable price and you know I have no interest in learning about the spectacularly boring life of Harry Potter.” He needs to insult him or else he’s sure he’ll just make a right fool out of himself.
She gently sets the piece of glass down next to her. With a flick of her wand, the piece and the rest of the shattered teacup vanishes. With another flick, the empty bottles are gone too and Draco burns in shame knowing that he had drunk that much alcohol in one sitting.
Harry waits several minutes before trailing behind them, trying hopelessly to keep the words ‘Malfoy’ and ‘pretty’ out of his mind for the rest of the day.
Draco smiles, shrugging secretively. “Maybe a little.” No one else in all of London has the privilege of seeing the stars and moon as clear as Draco does. Of course he used magic and lots of it, in fact.
Malfoy was usually standoffish at the best of times, but for some reason, his flippant attitude was positively infuriating. Just like when they were in the grass fighting, Harry feels himself snap in anger.
His mouth curls into a smug grin. Even after all this time, it was nice to have leverage against Harry Potter. “Merlin, is that all it takes Potter? Well, let’s see if I can do something about that thing for you.”
“Look, you have to promise me that you won’t tell anyone what I’m about to say.” His eyes bore into his with a type of depth Harry didn’t think he was capable of. “Like, swear on your magic that you won’t tell. And while you’re at it, swear on that stupid scar as well.”
Malfoy’s quiet, his eyes glued to a songbird tending to its nest several branches away from him. “It just doesn’t feel right, for me to do anything other than to feel…feel like this. I just don’t deserve it, and I’m trying to become okay with that. I’m trying but,” he waves a hand around his tear-soaked face, his still red eyes low and narrow with annoyance, “obviously sometimes I have trouble remembering.”
Who cares what a silly horoscope says? If the creator of that pile of shite knew him, they’ll agree that Draco and Scorpius have had enough change as is.
“You think Potter’s funny?” He huffs and pinches the bridge of his nose lightly. If Scorpius didn’t look and occasionally act so much like him, he would seriously question if he was his father. “
” Harry’s mouth untwists from his snarl and it’s only seconds later until he’s just as doubled over with laughter as Draco is.
Mrs. Lellory laughs, her voice an airy, pleasant tune. Much better than the receptionist’s. “Why don’t you tell him about your new friend, Al, Scorpius?”
“Christ Malfoy, can you not be crude for just one moment?” Harry has never been more grateful for his school robes before. Malfoy’s description of his cock was far more exciting than he cared to admit. “Can’t we just talk about something else?”
The Floo whooshes to life and he drops down to his knees, relieved to see Harry’s face staring back at him.
“You care about my friends. In your own, eccentric, snarky-arsed way.” He pokes his cheek and Draco growls threateningly. He had one more time doing that before he hexed all of that pretty hair off. “Admit it.”
When he pulls his head out of the fireplace, Potter is watching him, his arms crossed over his chest and a smug look on his face. He did not need this right now.
Draco stiffens in his seat, praying his cheeks don’t betray him. The term doesn’t upset him, he’s grown thickened skin after hearing far worse from his father and Finley, but bloody fuck if the idea of her finding out that everyone’s favorite English teacher and PTA President is absolutely a sodding shift-lifter doesn’t petrify him. He thinks he’ll rather have her find that he’s a wizard before that.
A distant chattering of children drifts down the empty hallway. Everything, from the plastered pictures of animals drawn with shaky hands, to the gum stained hallway floor is wholly unfamiliar to him. This was nothing like Hogwarts. Without the nearly tangible waves of magic fluttering around him, this place seems obstinately vacant.
The London air is surprisingly clean for a place with nearly no stars visible in the sky, but somehow it only feels like the sharp pricks of razor ice in his lungs. At least the Moon is visible. At least.
“Now I don’t know if I’m going to go set fire to the Martin Miggs comics Ron gifted Al, but you make a compelling point.”
“I told you that was an accident,” he snaps. It hadn’t been one of his finer moments in the slightest, but Harry really did need to learn how to stay on
He says this as he pulls down the blanket for him and Draco feels his inner sixteen year old self faint a little at the sight. Even though it's only several tugs before he’s coming into his hand, the look on Harry’s face as he does is exhilarating to watch from this angle.
“Dad stop slouching! Mr. Malfoy stop grouching! Scorpius, sit on the couch! My brother is coming to the house!”
Draco thinks that he should have known better, all those months ago when he was preparing to leave for a conference for Apparition safety and he was shaking with nerves for weeks about the thought of leaving Scorpius in Astoria’s care. He never worried when leaving Scorpius with his mother, or Pansy and Blaise, yet he couldn’t help but fear the worst when he was whisked away for a week-long conference.
Stray white fluff from the swaying dandelions tickles his nose as they walk to the front door, his hand gripping tightly onto Harry’s. A bit too tightly, because his pulse was becoming erratic under Draco’s bruising grip.
Draco smiles fondly, feeling the excitement bubbling under his sternum and up his throat. “Because it’s beautiful, that’s why! What other entity do you know can control whether the Earth can sustain life or not? Or control the other billions of galaxies in the universe? Not the Ministry, or Voldemort or blood supremacists, that’s for sure. The universe is limitless—no amount of money, magic, or convincing can allow anyone to thoroughly understand it or control it. It is, the one thing that is entirely unattainable.”
“Take the offer Draco. If you don’t like it, it’s not like you can’t back out. But give it a chance, for yourself.”
Yet James is far from frightened from her faux politeness. He hardly looks at Draco or Scorpius. No, his gaze is focused solely on Harry.
“So,” Scorpius mutters after walking most of the way to the school in silence. “Do your magic stars say that today is going to be a good day?”
Draco rolls his eyes, supremely annoyed that he was being subjected to a surprise. He hates surprises. They make no sense and he’s already told Harry that he was too old for them. At 32 years old, Draco Malfoy was officially too old for a lot of things. Surprises counted in that list.
He looked down onto his lap and sure enough, proof of his attraction was straining against the front of his open robes. He quickly covers it with his robe and buries his blushing face into his notes while Malfoy howls with laughter. Somehow, this doesn’t seem to make Snape deduct points from Slytherin. That biased bastard.
He couldn’t help but feel a little nostalgic two days ago when sausages were served and Malfoy and his insolent sucking was nowhere to be found, instead he was suffering by himself in the depths of the Slytherin dungeons.
There's more. Much more. “I know I shouldn’t drink as much as I do, but I’ve taken the potions before and I couldn’t get out of bed for weeks because of it. I don’t take them because Scorpius doesn’t deserve two neglectful parents.”
Draco’s breath hitches in amusement next to his ear and a knowing smirk inches up his face as he stares up at the ceiling.
Potter gives him an unexpectedly blinding smile. When did he own that? “Take it from me, kids are a disease,” he laughs knowingly, shaking his head an amused sort of disbelief.
Harry raises his brows, a disastrously cheeky smile on his lips. “Is this your grand plan? Locking us in my room so you can finally have your way with me? Terry’s probably thinking I have it out for him.”
Potter’s voice is in his ear and he can feel his own anxiety-ridden breath ghosting along the skin of his neck. “Malfoy, what’s wrong? Was it something I said? I was just joking about the stray thing you know; I should have never said that, even though it’s a little true. Fuck! Sorry again. Sometimes words just aren’t… yeah.”
Ron rubs the back of his reddening neck. “Well, Malfoy’s a guy so—” he chokes and pales like he was going to vomit all over the Gryffindor lunch table. “Oh Mother of Merlin, that makes it worse!”
Luna comes later, bringing flowers, kisses, and light for Ginny with an extra long hug for Draco. Ginny seemed to pick up on her ex-husbands’ fascination with hair as well, constantly carding her fingers through Luna’s wavy blonde hair. Only, she’s extra careful not to muse up the bright sunflowers entangled in Luna’s luminous locks.
It’s Sunday, and usually he and Scorpius spend the morning eating breakfast with Harry, Albus, and Lily. The day is usually spent watching Muggle movies and laughing on the couch together, but instead, Harry’s children are with Ginny, and Draco has to push down his pride to speak with him.
He sets down the chopsticks with a weary sigh and unsteady hands. “I’m sorry, I just can’t do this.”
“Oh yeah, Al’s my new best friend. His dad is my English teacher here and he has a sister that goes to this school too! His older brother James left for The Boarding School but he says he’ll be back for Easter so I can meet him. I can meet him, right Dad?” Draco nods distractedly. He and Scorpius had come up with several code words to describe wizarding places and things around Muggles. ‘The Boarding School’ was what they called Hogwarts. He’s glad. At least he knows that some of his classmates have wizarding backgrounds. The last thing he wants is for this lifestyle change to distance him from the wizarding world.
He means it too, because Draco always detested being called that. Mainly because that’s what Astoria would call him. While there was nothing wrong with a healthy bit of skepticism, his work was not that. The universe, much like the ecosystem, affected humans just as much as humans affected the universe. It was a provable fact.
Malfoy nods, though he’s pretty sure he hadn’t heard a word Harry just said. “Yes Mum.” He stuffs another treat into his already full mouth.
Ana sticks up her chin determinedly. “Then I’ll be there for him.” She sounds so sure of herself for a woman that’s only known his son for a week. Perhaps that’s all it takes for normal people, people not named
Draco shrugs, looking between Finley and Astoria with a lazy gaze, sneering. “Scorpius hardly asks about either of you anyway. I think if he’s managed to move on already, you two should as well. It’s only sensible.”
from the back of the room and Draco gives him a haughty little smirk in response. Like he fucking cared. “My name is one of the 88 official constellations in our galaxy.” His breath hitches and he clings onto his hair behind his back, tugging sharply at the strands to remind him to focus. “It means dragon and is the name of the dragon constellation. My son Scorpius’ name is also a constellation.”
In a parallel universe where he didn’t take the Calming Draught, Draco sees himself walk up to the classroom on shaking legs, immediately assaulted by fifty pairs of uninterested, apathetic eyes. He may get out a sentence or two, before he stumbles on a word; suddenly after one sharp intake of breath, he’s on his knees in front of everyone, panicking and hyperventilating and proving Harry right for the hundredth time.
“What the hell?” He whispers, his hand tugging at the ends of his frizzy braid. Sheer curiosity and panic lead him to sniff his underarm and he winces. A confusing mixture of stale Firewhiskey, earth scented cologne, and vanilla evades his senses. What on earth was wrong with him?
The wind blows through his hair the moment his head appears through the opening of the rooftop. Harry looks around, wide-eyed as he takes in the tiny utopia Draco’s cultivated for himself.
Harry sighs. Ginny was right, forgiveness isn’t easy. For yourself, or for others. Malfoy’s nose twitches as though he was trying to ward off incoming tears.
It’s just awful. I even heard some bloke wolf-whistle at me in the corridor the other day. Like, I know I’m bloody hot but I don’t need to be reminded of it all the time!”
Draco rolls his eyes. Soft was still possibly the worst adjective to describe him. Though ‘cute’ was a worthy competitor. “You’ve told me—”
Scorpius bites his lip, unable to prevent the laughing grin from showing on his glistening face. “Well, if I could say it like it is… maybe it’s because you're being so aggressive about it?” Draco gasps, offended that his own child was mislabeling his Slytherin bred ambition as aggression. He was
Harry sits back on one elbow, unconvinced by his feigned disinterest. “Alright eh?” He raises an eyebrow. “I always thought that you’d end up a greasy old bugger like Snape.” Draco’s throat tightens a bit at his name. So did he. “So tell me, why astronomy?”
Albus and Scorpius rush from behind them, each smiling as Molly fusses over them and pinches their cheeks. They lap up the attention like puppy dogs, especially Scorpius, who glows as Molly Weasley gloats over how much of a handsome young wizard he was while chiding Draco for not bringing him over sooner.
“Well first, you’re like the only person on earth who calls him Albus.” Draco hums, uncaring about what the kid’s god awful name is when the world was swaying beneath him. He stares down at the black gravel below his feet. Either his eyes were playing tricks on him or he really was standing in the misty waves of a black ocean. “And second, you’re
Draco doesn’t want to say that he doesn’t care whether Albus Potter falls out of a tree, but frankly, he really doesn’t care. He wasn’t the kid's sodding parent. What the fuck was he supposed to do about it?
Thinking of his father’s unrelenting bigotry always did the trick and before he knew it, he’s grabbing both Scorpius and Albus by the arms behind the men’s restroom.
Harry waits as the several parents pushing past them into the large room before letting it out. “Apparently, yesterday in Al’s history class, he pissed off the teacher, Mr. Burns. But it wasn’t malicious! You know how Al is, he just says things without thinking sometimes.”
“Please! It’s for Malfoy.” The words sound odd coming out of his mouth but he was desperate. Malfoy could be in serious danger because of an accident he caused. He couldn’t live with himself if he didn’t do anything.
Today was the first day of February. The moon was still new and the daytime tides in the Atlantic had been a bit higher than normal, but nothing unusual for a New Moon during a winter month. He gazes down his list for Meteor showers, comets, any significant supernova’s, every planet’s orbit, and major moon cycle.
Draco nervously touches the neat loops in his braid. He wonders if he’s simply grown into his father’s features.
“Please, please bring him back, I promise, I’ll make it up to you. Both of you.” He rubs below his eyes, sitting back into his chair. She’s gripping at the sides of the table, her face desperate. “Please.”
She folds her hands across her desk and her eyes drift back and forth between Harry, Snape, and a now female Draco Malfoy.
He twirls a lock of Harry’s curled hair in his finger. “Aww, does someone like it when I call him that?”
Nothing in life works out so neatly. He supposes that this was the one imbalance in the universe that may never be equalized.
Harry snaps his head to Ron, a messy, confusing knot of annoyance pulling at the center of his chest like a taut string. “I think that’s enough Ron,” he snaps.
He only heard those same words, resonating in his ears, promising more than he could have ever hoped to imagine, more than he deserved, forever…
“You don’t mean that.” Hermione snapped from where the witches’ robes were. “And I hardly think that Hogwarts graduation robes are necessary, Ron. It’s only a party.”
The word was a command, and Harry felt the Freezing Charm take hold. He could see Draco out of the corner of his eyes, frozen over the woman’s body, blood staining his chin. “What—” Draco hissed, his fangs still dripping blood. “Do you think you’re doing?”
The rest of the funeralgoers were taking a stroll through the Malfoy’s garden, admiring the albino peacocks and the general greenery, breathing in the sweet summer air.
He gripped the knocker and banged it solidly on the door a few times. Then, he shoved his hands into his pocket, one hand gripping his wand tightly.
Hermione was silent for a long moment. Her hand went to a chain around her neck with a pendant in the middle, a golden circle with some kind of engraving. “We’ll save them.” She said.
The ‘please’ was what caught his attention. Granger never asked anyone for anything. He sank into the desk chair, resting his feet on the table. “You’re the ‘brightest witch of your age,’” he said, making air quotes around the phrase. “What can I possibly do that you haven’t done already?”
Hermione and Draco enter the facility in a swashbuckling, heroic rescue attempt. Harry's ass needs saving for once. Finally.
He hadn’t been paying close attention. He’d been reliving the previous night in his head. Draco’s fangs sunk deep into his neck, that feeling of ecstasy that coursed through his body….
And that's the way it was. Harry tried his best to be as kind as possible, going out of his way to do work without being asked, to never ask for anything, but none of it seemed to have an effect. Draco belittled him constantly, nitpicking every tiny detail. Harry folded the napkins incorrectly. He didn’t set out the mugs with the handles facing out. He packed the breakfast bar too slowly.  And, when he couldn't find something to criticize, Draco would just stand there, breathing deeply through his nose, until he finally muttered something about the restroom and stormed off.
Ariana still didn’t look afraid, but she turned and disappeared down the hallway without another word. The portrait swung open.
“What color dress robes are you buying?” Ron asked. “Mum says we should stick to Hogwarts colors, but it’s time for something a little less drab, I reckon.”
He raced to the seventh floor, praying that Malfoy wouldn’t vanish off the map before he got there. He’d learned his lesson from his past attempts: if you didn’t know exactly what  you wanted the Room of Requirement to become, it would remain locked.
“Can vampire blood heal?” Harry said aloud. “How would he even get to them without being caught? Isn’t everything being monitored?”
The Room of Requirement had suffered Fiendfyre damage when Harry had fought Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle for the Horcrux hidden there. It had also been the site of Harry’s D.A. meetings, which Draco and the Inquisitorial Squad had broken up under Umbridge’s sadistic tutelage.
“I thought our goal was to maintain a pureblood society.” Draco added. “Why create more people who can’t do magic?”
. “I did mean it.” Draco said, trying desperately to maintain his icy disdain, even though he wanted nothing more than to sink his fangs into Harry’s throat, to wrap his limbs around him until there was no separating them. “I tried to kill you.” He whispered. “I
His mind flashed to those first few moments on the battlefield—he’d turned suddenly on a crowd of Death Eaters, nobodies, expendable to Voldemort and everyone else, useless fodder for the armies.
Those were the words with which Lucius Malfoy greeted his son, after not contacting him for months. In the middle of a pandemic.
"Aren't we playing enough of a game right now?" Draco asked. He dropped his gaze back to the board. "Sounds to me like you're afraid of losing, Potter."
“Draco—there you are—” Slughorn chortled happily as he grabbed him, hauling him towards the stairs. “They’re ready for you and Potter next!”
Malfoy thought, remembering that day in the bathroom, the blood that had burst across his chest and abdomen, Potter’s hands scrabbling desperately at his shirt. “
Hermione looked exasperated. “Let’s drop this façade once and for all. You and Harry have been obsessed with each other since you were eleven. Surely you have to realize what that is?”
Didn’t matter that the guy had volunteered. Didn’t matter that he’d seemed more attracted to Draco when he’d revealed his fangs, not less.
“Father.” Draco was crying now, tears leaking down his eyes and pouring down his shirt. His fangs retracted, and he fell to his knees. “
"It's gonna be a rough night, folks."  the anchorwoman was saying, gesturing to the numbers on the screen. "The governor has issued a state of emergency, and all the major roads are closed to all but essential traffic. There have been a number of accidents and deaths already." She looked directly into the camera. "Stay home. It's not worth your life."
Harry had hoped to at least get some rest before it came to this. He didn’t know if he had the strength…
That, of course, got her attention. The chance of there being a book Hermione Granger hadn’t read or wasn’t familiar with was slim, but the mere thought of being bested was enough. Hermione never backed down from a challenge.
He turned. Ariana was leaning against her portrait frame. Harry jumped. She’d never really spoken to him before, at least so directly. “Did he tell you?” he asked. “Is he going by broom? Walking out for a place to Disapparate?”
Hermione’s phone dinged, and she swiped across to check it. “Corona virus has spread to the UK” she said aloud. “Well, we already knew that.”
For a moment, he didn’t remember what had happened. Didn’t remember why he felt so exhausted, why his eyes felt sticky and puffy, as though he’d been crying—
"Of course--I'm so sorry." and for the first time, Draco looked genuinely apologetic. “Get home safe.”
Draco stopped. “What in Merlin’s name are you talking about, Potter?” his voice was harsh, ugly. Harry’s heart splintered. He had hurt him. Wounded him, by severing their bond. By allowing him to wake up in the middle of the night, not knowing if Harry was dead…Not knowing what had broken, only that
“Potter. Malfoy. My office. Now.” McGonagall appeared at their sides, her hair swept into its usual austere bun.
“You are no son of mine. You are a monster with my son’s voice!  And I won’t listen to a word you say! Get out of here at once, or I’ll curse you!” Lucius drew his wand and pointed it, shaking.
“I got rejected again,” he admits. His tears fall down Harry’s neck and stain the white button-up he was wearing. “What am I doing wrong?”
Draco can’t bring himself to eat, his hands trembling an embarrassing amount. He stuffed them under his thighs, only leaning forward to take a sip of his water through his straw. His Charm School tutor would have maimed him for his lack of manners. But really, fuck manners when he was on the verge of exploding.
A weary sigh is exalted from the strong body carrying him. “Let’s just go back to my place.” He continues walking, not once letting his determined gait falter in lew of the confused and nosy glances from passing witches and wizards.
“You…you two are…?” She squeaks, covering her trembling mouth with her hand. “You actually are a shift-lifter then?”
She’s on him the second he comes through the Floo. “Draco! Come, sit!” She gestured to the armchair beside hers that was stacked with soft green pillows with silver fringe on the edges.
“He’s already on board,” Harry answers gruffly. His body tenses next to him. Draco’s tongue feels like a dead flobberworm— thick and heavy in his mouth.
Regardless of age, everyone loves him, even though his bright hair and accent give him away as Draco’s son. They pinch his cheeks, play with him, indulge in his cute ten year old stories, praise him for his manners.
Maybe not embarrassment. Because there was nothing to be embarrassed about per se. But he’d rather keep his preferences to himself, heterosexual or not. Potter doesn’t seem like the type to gossip but it was better to air on the side of caution.
“Vermin,” Draco corrects. “Pesky, nasty little buggers.” He gives in and smiles back, losing himself in memorizing the tiny freckles scattered across Potter’s nose when he remembers that his hand was still in his, still warm and pulsing under his fingers. It hardly felt unnatural.
So he tries again, his voice softer. “Harry,” he takes a deep breath. Remembers to be gentle. “Is there anything you would like to tell me?”
His arms wrap around him the second he’s standing in front of his bedroom door. Harry buries his face in the crook of his neck without hesitation. He strokes his hair, feeling the coarse curls run through his fingers. “How did it go?”
A group of witches laughs loudly from down the corridor and Harry wants to scream. Or punch something. Not a wall though, that would hurt too much.
Harry seethes. Yes, he messed up by wetting his shirt, and yes he probably deserved to be punched in front of everyone, but his friends were off-limits. “I hate him, I hate him so fucking much Ron—”
His wand taps against the tiles of the roof as he says, “I’ll be in France at 2 pm next Sunday. Meet me at the house then.”
“That was different. Everything was different.” The stakes were far higher than simply Harry holding a grudge against the git.
better than most people’s misconceptions of him. He can rise above their judgments because, at the end of the day, his work spoke for itself.
“Can we hurry this up? Some of us have N.E.W.T.s to study for,” snaps Bulstrode, her irritation directed mainly towards her pseudo-shagging Slytherins than the Gryffindor team. Harry never took her as the studying type or even the flying type but if it straightens Malfoy and Parkinson and gets this game starting sooner, then he’ll take it.
He sits atop of the counter, paper in hand as the Prophet’s headline glares up at him. The main story?
watch him quite consistently. But for good reason, because he was Malfoy and everyone knows that Draco Malfoy was always up to something.
against the wintery white air, and those tiny freckles scattered across the bridge of his nose and under his glasses are mesmerizing. On the crisp edge of winter, he somehow looks like summer personified.
“Shhh. Ret–orical question,” he slurs. “I won’t get sent to Azkaban for simple Stinging Hex. All charges were dropped,
Harry swallows his food and studies it. “I think it’s a jukebox.” At Draco’s confused expression he elaborates, “It’s an American Muggle thing that was popular in like… the 60’s maybe? You can request songs and it’ll play them. Though I don’t know why it’s in a sushi restaurant of all places—”
He plasters on a fake smile she probably can’t see with her old age. “Never better.” Draco discreetly magicks the claw mark away after he assures Miss Norrison that yes everything is really okay, yes he’ll pick up her groceries for her, and yes he’ll try that yellow cake when it’s ready.
Harry’s face is ruddy and he’s clearly trying to deflect from the truth by the way he kept pawing at Draco’s hair. Finally, he says in a small, gruff voice, “I may have a bit of a thing for your singing.”
“I’m not Astoria. I just think that should be made clear beforehand.” His knuckles turn a light shade of brown as he grips his hands. “I wasn’t the most attentive husband to Ginny. You see how Luna is with her—constantly bringing her things, holding her hand, listening to her. I didn’t do any of that. I was too busy…” His face sours. “Do I have to talk about this?”
If it weren’t for the strict policy against doing magic in the hallways, Harry’s sure Malfoy would have cast several different hexes on him as they walk down the corridor, each of them silently stewing.
, leaving a scorching heat in its wake. Potter jumps into the doorframe at the large fire that’s produced, his hands gripping the edges.
Ana’s there in a floral dress as she hands out candy to eager little children excited for the weekend. If he had any breath left in his body, he would have laughed, the image of Snape giving out candy to terrified first years too ridiculous to consider.
“Stop saying that!” His upper lip curls and he looks at Draco, really looks at him, for the first time since he came through the Floo. He’s never noticed, but his eyes aren’t green like Harry’s; they’re hazel.
” His hand is freed from Draco’s iron tight grip at last and he yanks it away before Draco can swiftly grasp it again. He shook his hand out and hissed from the dull ache in his bony wrist. “I’ll see you later.” Then he ran towards the throng of other children before Draco could say another word.
“And what about you?” Her tone is accusatory much like those potions he knows is somewhere stored away in the house. “We can’t sit and pretend that we’re both not a bit fucked up, now can we?” He shifts his seat, glaring at her. “Are you getting help? Actual, professional help that isn’t at the bottom of a bottle?”
Blaise laughs at his wife’s crude behavior and Draco wrinkles his nose. He didn’t know if all couples were this awful or they were just awful themselves.
He can hardly continue walking in a straight line when he sees Harry’s best friends seated in a booth near the window. They look decent, surprisingly. His face is still too freckled and her hair is still incredibly bushy but they seem to have grown into their looks with age.
He hears a clang of metal on the ground followed by several muttered curses. Rising up on his elbows, he sees Harry, cursing darkly under his breath. His hands are messy from a thick substance and dark patches of what Draco assumes must be the lube on the front of his undone trousers.
There are many things Harry never knew he would enjoy in his life. Like the feeling of mastering a new spell or the freeing exhilaration of flying on a broom. Those were things that he had to first experience to know that he loved.
London swirls around them in a brilliant array of people and energies. Draco blows out a breath. He’s been putting off going in there for the longest. While everyone else’s parents freely enter inside the building or outside the doors of the school, Draco stays back, standing as far away from the crowd as possible. Despite the fat stack of Muggle culture books he read prior to leaving wizarding Paris, Draco’s still apprehensive of holding a conversation with one that lasts for longer than a minute. Yet if his ten year old son has been able to do it for a week without any problems, he should be able to too, right?
“Put that away,” he orders, gesturing to Harry’s undone trousers. Harry obliges but not without whining like a child. Like
Harry sits back, the green flames highlighting the tight lines in his face. “You know, if you were just going to be an arse about this, you could have at least had the decency to tell me.”
He squeezes again, a bit harder this time. He can swallow the bitterness of her cheating. It stings, but he can be fair too.
A barmy smirk rises on his face when Draco opens the door for Boot and practically shoves him out of the room without letting him get out another word.
He clutches the dragon to his chest. Princess will have to deal. This dragon would be laying next to him and Harry tonight. And probably for many nights to come.
Draco feels his face burn. Another thing Harry will be forbidden from doing: saying unexpectedly sweet things about him in front of Weasels.
He begins to shake his head like a guilty five year old before remembering to use his words. “No, ma’am.”
It can, but Draco can recite a list of about a dozen ways that could go terribly, terribly wrong. Especially since he was starting to worry whether Harry’s cock was broken and he was just unlucky enough to be afflicted by erectile dysfunction at such a youthful age. Or if he was, quite frankly, not that bright.
She stretches out her legs, careful not to touch the shattered pieces of glass. “Harry’s told us a lot about you. Ron says he talks about you far too much, but I disagree. It’s nice, hearing about your friends being in love, you know? Especially Harry.”
His body tenses underneath him, the flesh contracting as he sucked in a breath. Draco wishes he could say that he regrets asking, but Merlin, he was far too curious for his own good. Why is it that Harry bristles whenever he mentions the Aurors?
“Draco,” Hermione says, incredibly less breathless than her husband. He can hear the worry laced in her tone. “Was that her?”
Draco, who wants nothing more than to cling onto his son at the question, lets go. This time, he had to let go. Scorpius gives him a proud smile. “Yeah,” he says, “I’m ready.”
Scorpius is suggesting that they braid the fur of Princess and Optimus Prime, Lily’s pink, very female Pygmy Puff that Albus brought, when Draco decides now was his time to make a quick break. He can deal with a lot, but he wasn’t much interested in playing dress up with two Pygmy Puffs. He slips out on quiet tip toes when the two children and Potter have their backs turned, casting a noise deflector charm on his feet as he leaves to go up to his office. There was an abstract on the Alpha Centauri that was calling for him.
He feels like a dragon melted by its own fire when she chirps ‘Thank you!’ to him and gives him a quick hug around his waist, not even caring when she spills a bit of the sugary juice on his trouser leg.
He feels awful. He’s panicking around people who should be nervous around him. It’s not like they were the ones who made his life a living hell every day in school. He doesn’t have the right to feel anxious.
They were always going to get here. Here, lost in each other, still growing and warm and so terrifyingly, desperately in love.
While he’s talking, Draco inconspicuously casts a wandless noise deflector charm around him. He may be drunk, but he wasn’t that drunk.
“You really expect me to fuck you in my classroom?” Harry asks against his lips, apple-scented breath heating his own panting mouth.
“Mmm, I’m glad you finally noticed.” He dips Harry once again, his smirking mouth right in front of his face as he runs one foot up Harry’s shin. Naturally, he shivers at the feeling of Draco drawing his foot seductively and torturously slow up his leg. Something sharp pricks against his calf and with his woefully lacking knowledge about fashion, it takes him a minute to figure out what it was pressed against his leg. He pulls Harry up again, smirking all the while.
Malfoy’s fists tighten around Harry’s robe and throat as he seethes. His cheeks puff in annoyance when Ron calls again. The grey in his eyes goes dark like he was contemplating whether or not it was worth murdering him in broad daylight with the threat of Azkaban over his head.
Potter gives his leg a light kick under the table. “Don’t be a wuss Draco, live a little.” Draco scoffs, hardly believing that Potter would speak such language in front of his child. “It’s one ride, barely five minutes. I think if they’ve managed to survive nearly three hours without our assistance, they can survive for five minutes.”
He's in way too deep, because he now lets Harry Potter distract him in ways that would have been unimaginable before.
“And that is?” His wife fumes next to him, exchanging cross looks with Hermione and Ginny. He turns to Harry, his face unusually serious. “I’m tired of seeing you two ignore each other as if the other doesn’t exist. This won’t end unless we stop hiding from each other. Fred and I never ignore each other even on our worst days…”
For an escape artist, Princess isn’t this much of a nuisance most of the time, so he chalks it up to being a one-time mishap. But next time this happens, he tells Princess that he will be very, very cross with him.
She wrinkled her brow. “That doesn’t sound good. Should I get Hermione down here to shake some sense into you?” Harry glances over at Hermione, nose buried in a book on the top of the stands. She only came because Ron begged her and Harry reasoned that it wouldn’t hurt to do some studying outside for once.
“You’re welcome. Secondly, I think you’re wrong. I’m sure there are far more gay blokes out there than just four.” Malfoy shoots him a bored look as though he can’t believe how utterly guileless he was. “Really! Maybe they’re not gay but…. bisexual?” The word felt reaffirming on his tongue. Bisexual. Something about it feels fitting. “I uh— that’s a thing right?” He hopes that it wasn’t something he just made up in his mind.
The group laughs heartily, the parents exchanging knowing smiles and sharing good-natured jokes amongst themselves about Albus Potter’s wild ways.
Compromises, he reminds himself as he obsessively stacks and restacks the carrots. Compromises, though this doesn’t have to feel like one if he gives them a chance. Or if they give him a chance. Whichever one comes first.
He seethes quietly to himself as Potter howls in laughter at his less than cutting comeback. As if this couldn't get any fucking worse than it already was. Draco subsequently vows to spend more time with actual adults once Scorpius goes off to school. Preferably adults who were given the good fortune of being sorted into Slytherin.
Stars, everywhere. Massive models of planets hung from the ceiling and Draco wonders how Muggles could have hung them in the first place without magic.
Though Draco would still hex him blind for daring to enter into his home with his son in the house, he’s glad the bastard was doing something useful with his life.
Draco internally purrs. So strong and so steady. He wasn’t drunk enough to not appreciate the straining muscles in Potter’s arms or the firm curve of his arse as he carried him. Or maybe he was just drunk enough to appreciate them without his typical side dish of remorse. Didn’t matter because he looked positively delectable, even as he was hanging upside down and strung across his back like a limp animal.
“Harry, breathe.” Who would have known Draco would ever be the one telling Harry that. “Now tell me what’s wrong.”
They glare at him when he hands each of them a Calming Draught. It wasn’t strong by any means and would wear off by the time the experiment was over, but he has to explain the importance of using a Calming Draught to counteract the natural tension already occurring in their magical cores several times over before they finally give in and take the potion.
Startled, Draco turns and sees half of Scorpius’ body is out onto the rooftop. He quickly Vanishes the gillyweed, holding out a hand to help him up. Though the cold shock had been good for his system, Draco casts a heating charm around them to circumvent the cold atmosphere.
He shoots him a charming smile as he enters the house. “I’ll save you a seat,” promises Potter, winking.
Please, because Ron speaking would mean Draco has to look at him while he talks. It’s bad enough that he doesn’t chew with his mouth closed. Unfortunately, Draco’s also came to the awful realization that he was a mouth-breather as well.
Draco sputters, pulled out of his staring with Potter, and turns his attention on his beautifully naive, grey-eyed son. “Do what now?”
A fun fact: mother cuckoos frequently leave their eggs in other birds' nests to be raised and fed by them. In contrast, male foxes are actually wonderful fathers. I just thought that was interesting.
The only thing is, no one actually stops him again as he stomps through Hogwarts, trying to find Malfoy. The problem turns out to be finding Malfoy.
He raises an amused brow. “Take a picture Potter, it’ll last longer.” He brings the fork up to his lips and cleans it with a delicate swipe of his tongue. If he didn’t know any better, he’d stay that Potter looked wonderfully entranced by the action.
Harry and Ginevra share a silent look from across the room and he can feel the urge not to laugh at him shimmering under the surface of it. Draco doesn’t mind; he’s dealt with people’s odd reactions to his warnings for years now. He’s estimated that nearly sixty-four percent of the cases at St. Mungo’s could be prevented with a bit of astronomical foresight. So it doesn’t matter what others think because he was always right.
The small bag of gillyweed that hadn’t been touched in months is a welcomed distraction from today’s wounds. Usually, he would never risk smoking with Scorpius in the house, but fucking Potter’s got his head so screwed up that his usual reservations are disregarded for a few hours of feeling lighter than air.
Harry wipes his palms in his trousers. He’s blushing terribly, highlighting the naturally red undertones of his brown skin. “Castration spells, should I mess up with you.” His body seizes defensively, “But I would never—”
He feels Harry smile in his hair, nuzzling his cheek into the crown of his head. “I care about you too Draco.”
Harry holds up his hands in mock defeat, climbing off Malfoy’s bedspread to leave. “Okay, okay, I’ll leave you alone your Highness.”
“Here Mum, let me help you with that,” George stands up, passing out glasses of lemonade to everyone as she begins to cut the cooling fruit cake. Draco politely declines, nervous about the possibility of suffering through another dinner of a dry throat from the acidic lemons. He was already drinking too much water as it is. George raises a brow, a strange fit muttered laughter escaping his mouth when he gives the glass meant for him to Harry.
He walks into the Slytherin on careful feet, taking particular care not to draw attention to himself as he enters the dungeons. The temperature drops around him and he shivers underneath the cloak. How students survived in the dungeons submerged in the cold lake water was beyond him.
Harry snorts, pointing to Scorpius, who was currently telling Princess and Optimus Prime to be on their absolute
She sniffs the air with a disgusted face. “It smells like a bar in here.” Picking up an empty bottle and shaking the remaining contents around, she sighs into the air. “And I can see why. Look, do you want to tell me what’s going on or do I have to force Veritaserum down your throat for you to be truthful?”
The dark lipstick painted on his lips, subtle eyeliner, and his long blonde hair was the only distinctively female parts of his appearance. His gold trimmed black robes fit smartly against his curves yet still made him look as imposing and regal as he does as a male.
She says something he can’t hear, something that makes Scorpius laugh and reach his hand out for hers.
“So, spill. What is it that’s got your knickers in a twist?” Harry gives him a wiry smile. Malfoy is unimpressed.
The rest of the week went by as usual. A ridiculously lengthy inched essay for Charms took up most of his attention, as did a Quidditch game against Hufflepuff’s pitiful house team and Hermione’s new found obsession with books on feminism and sexuality that she was urging everyone around her to read.
When he’s done, he sniffs the droplet of lube on his finger carefully. “Mint?” He loved mint flavored things and it truly was Harry’s lucky day to bring him the right flavor of lube. Supposing that it couldn't be that harmful to ingest, Draco places his forefinger on the tip of his tongue, licking it clean and nodding in approval. “Not bad,” he concedes.
Malfoy’s slender fingers were balled into fists and it looked like he would pounce on Harry at any given moment.
“No charity eh?” One corner of Potter’s pink mouth inches higher and higher up his face. He nods towards their full cart. “So how many have you two sold?”
Chewing the inside of his cheek, Draco wondered when he should tell Scorpius just why in fact Harry Potter stares at him the way he does, and why Draco always stares back. He knows about the war, about Death Eaters, and that Draco and his family were on the ‘bad side’ of it, but that was the furthest he had gone in his explanation. Potter’s role was dragged out of him as well, since Scorpius wouldn’t stop pestering him with questions. He had only given him a surface level understanding of the war and why it was important for him to engage with and appreciate Muggles.
"No amount of arse kissing is going to get you out of this Potter,” Malfoy leers. McGonagall and Snape both scold him; McGonagall with a harsh
“Astoria,” Dark lashes flit in response. “None of this, except for the divorce, is permanent. I want you to share custody with you, but you have to get yourself better first. However it is that looks for you.”
Besides the fact that he has a strange desire to be friends with Draco Malfoy and is simultaneously battling a one-sided attraction to said person? Nothing much.
“It’s disgusting, really,” says Finley in a refined, aristocratic drawl. He turns his head towards Astoria, looking for her agreement, and Draco wrinkles his nose. It seems that Finley is still sporting those horrendous sideburns.
He’s in none of his usual spots and when he asks, Parkinson stiffly claims that he didn’t go back to Slytherin either. It’s like he’s vanished.
“It can’t always be about other people, Draco.” His hands grip tighter. Draco tries to tug away, feeling trapped. “Look, whether you decide to get help or not, do it for you. Not for me. Not for Scorpius. Only you. You deserve so much better than what you’re giving yourself, don’t you think you’ve earned a bit of peace after all of this?”
He waits several more minutes, brushing Harry’s hair and letting his touch ease away any tension from his body. When Harry’s back is sunk comfortably in the back of his chair and his breathing slows to a steady cadence, Draco asks, “How does it feel to you when you cast a spell?”
