There was a bit of space between them, here at this table in this muggle cafe, and Harry didn’t know what to do with his words, because that bit of space was 17 years worth of regrets. Good things, too, like kids, and hard work, and family, but…
He laughed and let go - her elbows were actually quite sharp - holding his hands up in a gesture of defeat.
He had been right about Cork coming alive at night. Young people spilled out of every doorway, it seemed - university aged men with cigarettes hanging at the corners of their mouths, the women with them in neon high heels and shockingly short skirts. It was loud and jarring and rich with scents, cologne, sweat, bright red geraniums, clove and hashish. And no one seemed to know him, as he ducked through crowds and kept his eyes wide open. He was just another kid, out on a Saturday night, not wonderful, remarkable, cursed, coveted.
They sat quietly, the fire sparking, and it should have been uncomfortable, all the history between them, but it just felt so good - at least to Harry. Here, with Draco, in his new flat, the smell of coffee and smoke, and he was exactly where he wanted to be.
Draco didn’t look into the flat, at first, but watched the shock and wonder cross Harry’s face. He had forgotten - in all the publicity, in Harry’s popularity, in his heroics and all of that fabulous nonsense, it was easy to ignore the facts of Harry’s childhood. The ways he was already screwed up, long before -
Ginny was one child out of seven - well, six, now. She figured if there were family names to be passed on, her brothers could probably take care of it.
He started writing to Pansy again, and Blaise, and Greg. Pans was always complaining about Blaise; Blaise was always raving about Pans. It came as no surprise, whatsoever, to get a gushing - and far too detailed - review of Blaise’s performance in bed. And when Greg decided to get the hell out of England, where people spat on him in the street, Draco gave him some advice on how to manage his money, and it was like - like the old days, but so much better.
“Yes, well… Your owl was - unexpected,” he took another sip, then set the cup down, “And irritatingly vague.”
He felt a laugh at the back of his throat and pushed his glasses back up his nose, shrugging in Ron’s direction. Ron, of course, shrugged back and picked up the last biscuit from the tea tray.
Draco moved forward until he was right there, under Harry. Harry stared down at his upturned face, his irises almost entirely black.
The club was busy for a Wednesday. He’d wasted no time getting to the centre of the dance floor, and he let his body move, almost mindlessly, to the bass which seemed to echo in his chest. He felt eyes on him from every direction, and he let himself experience fear and rage against it, reveling in the danger of possibilities. A pain he could control. A pain he inflicted on himself.
Draco holding his face, whispering, “You’re so fucking beautiful,” and Harry knowing, for once, that it was true -
“You think I couldn’t love you?” Harry’s breath shook out, nose running, and he smiled a watery smile, “How could I possibly not? Draco - I can’t bear to live without you, not for one more day, not for one more second, because you are so beautiful, so damned brave, so unexpectedly kind… to me, you are perfect. You’re everything I was too stupid to know I needed.
Potter was silent. He took one last drag of his cigarette, then dropped it and ground it out with his boot.
He was, of course, in the middle of the press of bodies, and he shone brighter than anyone there. If the other dancers were like ballet, he was like flying. The soft fall of his hair was disheveled - Harry had never seen it like this, because his hair had always been so meticulously gelled - and brushing over his eyes. His long limbs wrapped around the neck of a shorter brunet in front of him - muscled arms twined around him, from behind, as another man grinded against his back. And he was breathing, heavy, the way Harry had started to breathe - Harry’s exhale was his inhale, and Harry wanted to feel that breath on the soft skin below his jaw, and exchange something with him, blows, barbs, something more, something he had never let himself think about.
But here, in front of a roaring fire, nestled into deep cushions, a view over the city, croissants in the pantry and warm drinks whenever he wanted them -
Harry bought the flat - and all the furniture in it, even, it turned out, the green linens - because how could he not?
“You are the biggest idiot in the world,” Draco looked pretty offended, then froze, “I’m going to look in the bathroom!”
“I think perhaps I should take my leave,” he stood quickly, needing to be anywhere but here, with Longbottom - who truly appeared like he wished Nagini had gotten him instead - and his ex-lover’s ex-wife in her scandalous bedwear.
Like his whole heart shot forth from his fucking cock. Like he’d stay there, in him, forever, if asked.
He grabbed Harry’s hand and pulled him out the front door, through a knot of smokers, and across the street, up the stairs of the courthouse. They ducked behind a stone pillar, and he pushed Harry right up against it.
“Look,” she stared up at him, suddenly fierce and a bit defensive, “I know I said I’d be in Scotland -” oh yeah, that was it, “With the National team, and, well, I was, but I had an extra night, and, er, I actually slept over with Neville, and...”
He’d never learned, in the cupboard, what it meant to love someone. What it meant to hold your heart out, beating and bloody, when no one had ever loved you back.
A pause - Longbottom was really good at this authority thing, letting the silence stretch ominously.
“My hus-” she rolled her eyes, “Harry Potter is many wonderful things. A great Dad, a good Auror, all that. But I know, better than most, that he can be a selfish prick.”
“Because it’s us, Harry. This is -” his silvery eyes were guarded but endless like the moon, “It’s just - us.
But today, as he made his way towards Chambers’ dim doorway, he felt that thing, following him. Something that should have been buried.
“Yeah, Dad,” Lily took a deep breath and then hiccupped and fell dramatically back onto the bed, “Oh, no!”
It wouldn’t be weird, would it? He was nineteen, and he’d been pretty preoccupied with fighting evil for basically his whole life, so it would make sense, wouldn’t it, for him to go to a nightclub. And he did know where a nightclub was, after all - and the fact that he knew about that because he’d seen Malfoy go in was just a coincidence.
Because he had been shamed, bloody, broken, sliced to ribbons by Harry’s wand, and all he’d thought was no, no, please -
“Potter,” his voice was quiet and still, like the near-scalding surface of the bathwater, “Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Alright?”
“You know,” he was running his fingers over the light down of Draco’s arm, “I still technically have a hotel room.”
Harry struggled under him and thrust up, not trying to get away but ready to fight, “I am now,” Draco sucked on an earlobe, “You kinky bastard.”
Harry’d grinned at him, mouth full of toothpaste, and spat - lovely - before he said, “I just like brushing my teeth with you.”
Across from the lift, on the other side of the open room, was a wrought iron spiral staircase. Harry walked over to run his hand along the cool marble of the island, and Draco heard a very distinctive sound -
The stiletto-sharp clack of Pansy’s high heels. He saw her coming down the staircase, regal as ever, and he saw the look on her face when she realized who the mysterious client Draco begged her to take really was.
“I give in,” Al said, getting ready for bed (once their totally mortifying fathers had left), wrapping an arm around Scorp as they brushed their teeth. “Our dads are terminally weird. You were right.”
“No,” Malfoy's face was ugly, almost too broken to behold, and Harry couldn’t smile anymore, “I just -”
“Good job. But - I hope you don’t mind me saying so - you look like a man needs a new start in life. To do something a little unexpected.”
Once he’d bottomed out - and God, it had been far too long, it was fucking unbelievable - they both stilled, conjoined, and it felt like the years unspooled out from within them, the memories thick, and it was - it was -
He couldn’t remember, later, if he’d nodded, but he would always remember the whimper which was unmistakable for, “yes, please, fuck.”
“Don’t be a sad-arse. You’ll never pull that way. But I think,” she took a deep breath, “I think you should see if you can move sooner, rather than later.”
“No, Scorpius. Albus. It’s because what you did was very dangerous,” he ran his hand through his hair, considering pulling it out, “You can’t just go into the forest, expecting to emerge perfectly safely - good gods, your teachers didn’t even know where you were!”
The flannel was buttery-soft, sliding down his arse, catching on his damp prick. Sweat beaded between his shoulder blades. He felt slender fingers and sharp nails against his skin, spreading him.
“Eh,” he breathed out, smoke curling through the air, “Yeah. But that wasn’t rebellion. Just the thing you do.”
How could he have forgotten, for even one second, what that voice could do to him? He felt his cock, filling, thick and heavy against his pyjamas.
And deep in him was an ugly thing, a petrified thing, a mewling - he had never intended to fall in love with a man. He couldn’t be - couldn’t tell his friends that he was -
There were, of course, bedrooms, and four of them as Draco had requested. Three rooms for the children which shared a hall bath, and -
“No,” Harry wiped at his eyes, and Draco rolled his own, but with a tiny smile tucked in the corner of his mouth, “It’s perfect.”
Harry gripped onto Draco’s sides. They were in the half-light of the alley beside their club, and music was playing, and they were crowded on every side by other young people living other secret lives. Harry’s back was to the wall, their come still wet and warm in their jeans after rubbing against each other and laughing and crying out, muffled, into the other’s neck.
He paced in front of the gate - warded with elaborate and efficient spells, polished to a black gleam. The building rose high above him, so unlike traditional wizarding architecture; it appealed to him even as it was foreign and new. Clean lines, steel and glass and concrete, mixed with powerful magic. He’d no idea if Harry would like it, and a little mean part of him felt pretty damned good about possibly wasting his time.
The owl had arrived first thing, Harry barely out of bed, still in soft flannel pyjama bottoms and a threadbare t-shirt. Four words from Draco - and they sounded anything but cheerful, but Harry let himself, in this sleepy first hour of waking, imagine his smile. He wrote back immediately, his answer guaranteed before he’d put quill to parchment - “Come over.”
Draco stood, stripping off his robe and hanging it behind the bathroom door. He slid into the tub - built to be large enough for two, though he’d never shared it with anyone. Bubbles reached all the way to his chin. He closed his eyes.
Harry didn’t realize he was smiling until Draco spotted him and pinned him with a look of utter contempt.
Draco, waiting for him - God, he could get used to that - was washed out, almost white in the faint strains of sunlight, and yet another beautiful thing he thought he’d never get to see. Get to have.
Draco held out his left hand, summoning the lube, no wand, no words, and the smack of the bottle against his palm was threatening and so fucking hot.
Hermione arranged the portkeys - travel across the Atlantic took more than one. London to Belfast (“Because you might as well see a bit more of the British Isles, Harry”), then to Reykjavik, then Newfoundland, then New York City, where Kingsley’d arranged a bed sit for a couple weeks. And then a road trip. See the Grand Canyon. Throw down some galleons in the magic quarter of Las Vegas. Meet a movie star. Drink Mai Thais in San Francisco.
Back in the kitchen, he slid into one of the hard-backed chairs worn into a golden sheen by use. So many dinners at this table.
She reached for his pack of cigarettes, tapped one out and lit it with a snap of her fingers, her own favorite wandless spell.
“Not really,” but even as he said it, he felt the first hit of nicotine to his system. Another thing he could get used to, and fast.
“Harry,” Harry’s breath stuttered, “You don’t have to live in a cupboard for the rest of your life.”
Why, you know, on earth, had he decided to do this? He shook his head to clear it and decided that his little - this odd turn of events - was a problem for a different Harry. Some later version of himself who’d maybe gotten a few more hours of sleep. And breakfast.
“It’s almost funny, your selfishness. Your willingness to curse others - including Ginevra, by the way - with misery. All because poor little Potter never got a proper hug.”
They hadn’t been close for a long time. They lived their lives in parallel, each going to work, caring for the kids, doing their assigned tasks, and it was almost as if nothing had really changed. They had love for each other, lots of love, just - they were already separate.
“Draco,” a bit of reproval, “Not because of the end of your marriage. But because you felt you had to enter into it at all.”
Harry walked around in a daze, after that kiss, and Draco rolled his eyes at him, terribly pleased and trying to hide it, and he instructed Harry, “Get it together, Potter, and book us a hotel somewhere.”
He looked down at Harry, and for just a moment the facade cracked, and Harry could see the long shadows of his worst mistake.
“Look, I don’t want to say all this in an owl. And I know I don’t deserve any of your time, after… everything. But I’d really like to see you. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?
Harry knew there was no safe. So he’d find a new kind of danger, just in being by himself. No one to answer to. No closeness, no responsibilities.
“Well, then. Not like I did it for you, but,” she gave him a dirty look, and then a fond one, “Anyway. That’s not why I firecalled.”
Creamy, too-sweet coffee in hand, he fell back into the deep plush of the velvet settee. He propped his feet up, right over the left, and looked out over London.
It was late autumn, the sun still misty over the rooftops below his flat, brief fragments of light refracted by the large, charmed windows, giving his living space a rainbow sheen. Harry stumbled down the stairs, lit the fire - even though the flat was temperature-controlled with a complex weaving of warming and cooling charms, he liked to keep it just shy of too cold. He had so many fond memories of the fire burning in the Gryffindor common room, and he didn’t see why he should deny himself, as an adult, the cozy atmosphere of crackling logs and pine-scented smoke.
“I do, you know,” he started speaking to Harry’s zipper, but looked up and met his too-green eyes, “Owe you.”
When he kissed him, they clicked right into place - Draco’s smirking lips tilting, covering his, and it was like dancing, and chasing the snitch, and laughing in lamplight, and drinking hot cinnamon liqueur; it was bath oil and champagne; it was being so terribly young, and growing so beautifully old.
She sat down on the ground next to him, arranging her tight skirt, taking off her tailored suitcoat.
His voice was too loud, rough. Harry had meant - he didn’t know what he'd meant. Here, in Cork? In what seemed to be a gay bar? In the toilets, with him?
Music slammed into him with an almost physical force. It was dark, that darkness pierced by flashes of colored lights reflecting on shimmering bodies coated in soft glitter. The dance floor was packed, people writhing against each other, and it was three deep at the bar.
“I’ll pay you back. Whatever - however long - d’you want a holiday? Expensive gifts? Sexual slavery? The entire wardrobe? Or I can get you that cat -”
“I hated him,” that was Hermione, interrupted by an injured, “Oi!” from Ron, “Oh, yes, it wasn’t real hate, but I... wanted him and wanted that feeling to stop and - and Ronald, I love you dearly, but you were not exactly easy to deal with in school.”
“This summer… I’ve figured you out, Potter. Why you’ve always been like this, so fucking selfish,” he leaned his head against the peeling paint of the window, “And I don’t think that it was the war that fucked you up at all. I think you got off on it - I think you enjoyed telling yourself that you were brave. That you were the hero of the story,” he laughed with the jarring friction of broken glass.
Harry hadn’t known that they’d been kept in holding cells for almost an entire month. Not until he saw Draco’s skin, pale as ice and more translucent, and could almost count each bone in his delicate hands.
Playlist track: "When I Fall in Love" by Nat King Cole, and "The Little Drummer Boy/Peace on Earth" by David Bowie and Bing Crosby.
Loving him in that way he told himself is only possible when you’re young. When your heart is still fresh enough to break.
Harry felt a hot flash of - yeah, it was jealousy. And anger, that someone else, some woman, had touched him.
The words seemed to settle into him, a solid mass of self-hatred and longing and fear. But he had to try - he kept talking.
“I was so scared. I was stupid, and I… And then I had what I’d thought would be the perfect life,” he took Draco’s left hand, held it, and Merlin, his skin was still so soft, “The life that I imagined since I was a kid. That I thought I was supposed to have.
Draco turned, staring back out into the street. And then without deigning to look over his shoulder, he spoke, quietly, the last words that Harry would get from him for seventeen years.
He passed a cigarette over to Harry - who nearly missed him, in the click and whoosh of the lighter, saying,
“Ah,” pushing that very firmly to the side, at least for the moment, Draco leaned forward, “I’ll take that into consideration. Do you two understand why you’re in trouble?”
Arthur had asked her, Ginny wrote, to convey Kingsley’s invitation to join the Aurors in an accelerated programme. He could join up at any time, she’d written out - Kingsley was apparently quite eager to have him in the corps.
He felt a laugh bubbling up, watching Harry look around like a first year at Hogwarts and Pansy glaring at him like she was five seconds from throttling him and hiding the evidence.
“Potter,” Malfoy rolled his eyes and sighed, “Is there a reason that you are holding a set of first year’s robes?”
“You’re in no position to make demands,” but he still shoved in another finger, scissoring, making Harry cry out.
He made something of himself, not as a Malfoy, but as him - Draco. He caught, every once in a while, a strange, solemn look on Mother’s face, and he figured he had better start planning for an heir of his own.
“Maybe you lied like that to make me feel better, I don’t know, or because you felt sorry for me. But,” his voice was so small, “It was a really fucking shitty thing to do.”
Draco made a sound, an angry animal sound, and flipped them over. He sat back and pulled at Harry’s hips - Harry felt his softened skin rasp against the cotton sheets, his arse nearly in Draco’s lap. Draco growled again, held out a hand, and the bottle of lube they’d tucked in an overnight case shot into his palm.
Harry felt a shard of something digging into his knee, probably cutting him. He stayed still, hardly breathing.
He’d wandered for a quite a while after stepping off the train, and found himself ducking into a small cafe, desperate for coffee. It never occurred to him that he’d be able to find Malfoy on the very first morning of the very first day - it was as if the universe decided to give him what he had wanted, but without any adequate preparation. He wondered if his life was just destined to be him, Harry freaking Potter, bumbling along and finding trouble at the most inopportune of moments.
The first time they kissed was on a bench, next to the river, right at the edge of the university campus, and he hadn’t meant to do it, swore to himself that he never would, but he did it anyway.
They stood like that, just a foot apart - neither of them had moved back - and Harry felt like he had lost the plot, and Malfoy smelled just the same, just the same, and he remembered the stone wall next to the River Lee. Cork at sunrise, and cigarettes laced with hash, and the most beautiful and most fucked up time in his entire life.
“Er,” Draco blushed a little and thunked his head back on the edge of the tub, “I think we’d better wait a minute.”
“Well, I guess we should have seen that coming,” Draco tried not to laugh as Harry, bright red, flopped onto their pillow-top mattress and groaned into his hands.
They sat on the fluffy velvet couches, recessed lighting off but fairy lights on, and the kids rolled around on the carpet, making a mess, tickling and yelling and coming up with alarming plans, and -
He looked so well-fucked that Draco wondered just how quickly he could get hard again - and wondered what he’d look like when - if -
Both boys were still competitive, facing off on the quidditch pitch, and they hurled insults, and banged about - but after a vicious snowball fight in third year they dropped to the ground, exhausted, and broke out into giggles. Draco held out his hand, smiling. Harry took it.
Watching Potter as he came was like hearing a symphony, all these little parts, little painful broken things, coalescing until he was too beautiful, too suspended in time, and the wetness on their fingers as they nearly held hands was like a benediction, and when Draco came like he’d never come before he thought, Jesus Mary and Joseph, I could love this man.
And it was too early, and he was too young, but he thought - he thought it would be nice, someday, to have kids who looked like him, like his dad. Like his own mum.
Harry sat at a small table under the picture window at the front of the cafe. He had a huge mug of coffee - a latte with too much milk and too much caramel sauce, which made it perfect - and across from him he’d set up Draco’s double espresso with a small pot of cream, both under a stasis charm.
After, Harry was solicitous, kissing over his stomach, smoothing his tongue against his roughened entrance, wiping him clean.
Harry looked - he looked almost as if he were drugged, or drunk as fuck, because he was breathing hard and his eyes were hazy and it seemed like he could pass out at any moment. Draco frowned.
Malfoy laughed. And then rubbed his pale, smooth face against Harry’s denim-encased prick - which was harder than it had ever been.
And when Draco came, he watched his own face as he whimpered out, almost against his will, “God, I love you.”
And another part of him, which he was resolutely ignoring, wondered if he wasn’t just excited to spend any time with Harry at all.
The door opened. Jamie wandered in, eyes on his - oh Merlin, who decided that the wizarding world needed its own versions of iPods, and why had he let George buy them for all the kids? He was banging his head, some third year amalgamation of Sirius and Charlie. He threw himself - upside-down, of course - on a chair, and kept rocking out.
She was still annoyed that it wasn’t her turn yet, after all, and any chance to sneak into the castle was much appreciated. As he watched her - taking in all the details, memorizing the portraits and the suits of armor and the smell of potions wafting from the dungeons - he felt the shadow of his first moments, here. Hogwarts was his first real home.
Though the lift doors, he had to admit, were pretty neat. As Draco reached the top floor, a one-way transparency charm revealed him - yet another piece of magic security. Draco was patting down his hair, tousled by the autumn wind.
“I’ll have you know that you had nothing to do with that,” he shifted, lifting his head and grumbling.
How he’d woken up, every morning for almost 17 years, expecting to see Draco. Putting a record on. Mixing up instant coffee. Dancing naked in front of the mirror.
And then a door creaking open as the woman in question stepped out - in a rather too clingy nightdress - from what he’d thought was an empty closet. His heart thumped, missing a beat.
Silence. He was trembling - from anger, from shame, from gratitude to his best friend for caring so much.
“Given the state of this room,” she walked further in, lifting her robes to avoid shards of pottery, “I think you need it, even if you don’t want it.”
Harry’s head lifted - it was like he was mesmerized, Merlin, this place was perfect - and he spotted Pansy.
Harry missed, fiercely, the days when he could have all of Draco, when he didn’t put on his masks. But losing that closeness, that vulnerability, was his own damned fault.
Harry lifted his own hand, twined it with Draco’s right, slick with lube and precome, and he was deadly serious.
Harry breathed out a bit of a laugh, then wrapped his fingers around his mug. He stared into the milky-sweet brew, not really knowing what to say - even though he felt he had so much to say, had been holding onto it for years.
“You bastard, you fucking -” Draco’s movements stuttered, shuddering, and he came with this sound like - like -
He looked very uncertain as to his welcome - which he should have - and placed the biscuit tray on the range.
“Anyway,” he dragged his hands down Al’s back, cupping his arse, “Sometimes I think our dads just, like, rained down weirdness on everyone. They are terminally weird.”
I think he’s my best friend at Hogwarts so far, though I have to meet more people, and Hya is my other best friend but honestly, she’s such a girl sometimes. Holding my hand because of grindylows…
And then he heard the door opening again. Hermione swept in from the front hall, dumping her robes on a kitchen chair. Hugo lifted his arms for a hug, and she started to hug him back - and then saw icing sugar all over his face.
The panel next to the lift - a complex weaving of magi-muggle tech, with a private Sonorus charm linked up with wiring - chimed.
He pushed through more muscled bodies and ran to the toilets, blessedly empty. He leaned over the sink and breathed, breathed, tried to screw up his eyes against what he had already seen.
It was cold in the manor, too cold, and he remembered what it was like, back then, when the snake was in every corner, gnawed and regurgitated human bones stacked in the cellar, his father pitiful and cowed, hair turned to straw. The constant, unending fear permeating the air like a foul perfume.
Liam at the bar was making some layered concoction of grenadine, blue curacao, and goldschlager, and he could feel the alcohol starting to course through him, and he felt at his back pocket for his crumpled pack of Marlboro lights. Wednesday night, trad about to start, and he hoped he’d be just drunk enough to shake off the memories of last night.
Harry studied her face, a face he truly loved, a face he had seen in happiness and in sorrow. More freckles, and the gentle lines of laughing, and that worry line, right between her eyebrows, which he thought was new.
It wasn’t anything like the life he’d imagined for himself. And so what, if he really wanted - if he wanted to have -
He felt Pans tense next to him. She glared at Potter, then kissed Draco on the head as she picked up her jacket, stood, and muttered, “Do you want me to stay?”
His knees creaked as he stood - he may have felt like a teenager, inside, but his body was one hundred percent 37 years old, and it hated him.
“Still gagging for it, aren’t you, Potter?” He slicked his fingers, ran them down the tender skin, held them, still, over his rim, “Tell me, how often did you close your eyes, fucking your perfect wife, and think of me?”
Draco caught his reflection in the mirror, with the blurred images of dark hair and glasses behind him, and he thought, fuck, I had Harry Potter, here against the sinks, and he had me on my knees for him, and he went home to Ginevra and respectability and he was so far away - away from -
Yeah. He’d spotted Malfoy earlier, there with his wife - well, his ex-wife, and that was the problem, wasn’t it? - and with a tiny Malfoy with all of the icy looks of his father but with a big, toothy grin. He had tried, in that moment, not to think anything at all.
“Mm. Under your invisibility cloak, no less. Thanks ever so for sending that along with dear Albus Severus.”
Until he saw the announcement in the paper. The divorce. A little picture of Malfoy looking cold and remote and severe.
Loving him in the little, quiet ways, in the ways that meant forever, that meant growing old, getting a cat, brewing the coffee, the things he hungered for and ran from and Draco, Draco, this man -
Draco pushed his thumb against a tablet by the front door - a bit of magical security inspired by a muggle invention. It read magical signatures instead of fingerprints; Pansy had given him temporary access for the day.
He dropped the cigarette and ground it into ash on the scarred carpet. And then he met Harry’s eyes - and his grey irises, dark as slate, were colder than they had ever been.
He started preparing a second cup of espresso. Because, well, it seemed like a better idea than staring at the lift like a nutter.
Harry had, in fact, owled him. Asking for Pans’s name. And now he was stuck, because he was too fucking weak to shut Harry down and bury him for good.
He poured lube on his fingers, a whole mess of it, and wrapped both hands around Harry’s nearly painfully hard cock. Three quick pulls, and then he stopped, running his left hand down, one finger resting against his arsehole.
He was energetic, cheerful - now that Colin had him doing more work around the club, bookkeeping and advertising and any odds and ends he was up for, he’d started coming home with a little more excitement. He liked his work, and he was good at it, and he was getting recognized, which Harry had realised, at some point, was new for him.
Draco did move into the flat that Pansy’d really picked for him, and yes, he did need all that room in the wardrobe, thank you very much, Potter. He whispered sweet nothings to the espresso machine (and occasionally to Harry, though there was usually profanity involved. And nudity.)
Harry moved closer, “Scared, Draco?” And he sucked at that spot on his neck, right over his pulse point.
He knelt, unbuttoning Draco’s jeans, inching the zipper down, dragging his fingers over his wiry thighs. He rubbed his face along Draco’s prick - already very interested, fuck yes - and breathed in his scent.
Maybe, if he was lucky, it hadn’t been the biggest mistake of his life. Maybe he’d get to keep the memory.
Draco’s mind started filling in the gaps, to his everlasting horror. Neville, who looked like he wished the floor would swallow him up. Ginevra, in a negligee, freckles on shocking display. And Luna, apparently, his charmingly mad cousin, who was in their...
In the morning - after three more rounds, and he’d had to tap out after the second, sore and stretched and dripping but fucking reborn - they checked out of the hotel with all of Harry’s belongings.
“He came back strong, you know. He took control of the manor, the family fortune, and he helped us - all of the Slytherins, who I’m sure you wouldn’t spit on if we were on fire…”
Once he’d gotten into his room, he fell straightaway onto soft white linen and down-stuffed pillows.
“You’re going to be alright, Harry. So is Ginny,” Hugo squirmed, and she looked like she might turn away, but then she placed a firm hand on his shoulder, “You did the right thing, after all.”
But there was Longbottom’s face in the fire, still nervous-looking but, he had to admit it, rather more handsome than he remembered.
“Yes, Scorpius,” and his lips, despite his exasperated tone, wobbled for just a moment, “It’s alright.”
Molly’s big hugs, and Arthur tinkering, forgetting that Harry wasn’t one of their children, not really. Charlie, slapping him on the back, and Bill’s crooked smile, and Ron, working so hard, because he knew down to his socks that he loved Hermione and wanted her to be his.
He felt sweat gather, prickling all over his body. He couldn’t bring himself to answer; he mumbled, staring at the floor.
“Oh, I don’t know,” Al did that thing where he twisted his hips, and Scorp moaned and had to stop for a moment, “Harry seems to enjoy being Father’s kept man, since he convinced him to quit the Aurors.”
Draco did, and stared up at Harry, eyes hazy and mouth sharp, “And were you asking me, or my arsehole?”
“Go back to your - wherever you’re staying. Take your come-soaked clothes off,” Potter blushed, “Or leave them on, stay nice and wet. Get in bed. Wrap your hand around yourself.”
“He loves you. He watches you like he’s never seen anything more -” she shrugged, uncomfortable, “Anything more beautiful. Precious. And you are, Draco,” he looked at his lap, avoiding her kindness, “Don’t forget that, please.
“I wanted to make a potion,” he managed the well-bred Malfoy tone, but his face was pure Black - stubborn, mutinous, with a hint of self-righteousness.
Draco pulled out his pack of cigarettes, offering one to Harry, flipping open his lighter. He debated - “What the hell?” - and had Draco light both. They were quiet for a moment - Draco as he took a long, practiced drag, and Harry as he puffed lightly and tried not to choke.
He sat back down on the couch. Thought about what Lily might say, asking too many questions, wondering if they still loved her. He stood up again in a panic. Thought about Al looking disappointed in him (which was not altogether unusual, God, he was so much smarter than his old Dad). Fell back onto the couch with a thump.
Well, he had plenty of time to figure out what he wanted. After a bit of a world tour, and time on his own.
A spliff and its thick smoke, the way the night blurred around the edges, the way it was impossibly sharp when he wrapped his lips around Draco for the first time, and how Draco fucked his face and he choked and it was exactly right, exactly what he -
“Go, be an Auror, whatever. Marry Ginevra, stick your prick in her, fake being... have her pop out a brood of red-headed brats. Just know that this time, the only person who’s forcing you into the cupboard is you. And that you’re locking everyone else in that cupboard with you.”
He stroked, slowly, pressure just a hair too light, and watched the mingled frustration and pleasure shifting on Draco’s face.
“Oh, right. I’ll, er,” he knew he had the number for the front desk somewhere, “I’ll call down, shall I?”
He fiddled with the short stem of his glass, knowing that something unpleasant was coming, as it usually did.
“Very well, thanks,” he cleared his throat, awkward, because somehow he still felt outclassed by midget Malfoys, “What’re you listening to?”
Maybe he was worried that if he opened his mouth it would all - it would be real. He’d start talking and tell Draco everything - from how badly he wanted him, right now against the glass window, to what he’d had for breakfast that morning; from the way he’d looked at Ginny and wished she were pale and blonde and mean to what he’d been imagining when he wanked in the shower last night, clenching his mouth shut so he wouldn’t make a sound. Everything.
“Teenagers are lovely, aren’t they?” Ginny’s voice was as dry as the antarctic. Harry laughed through his nose.
“I just wanted to say… I don’t want you to think I hate you, or anything,” her lips puckered like she was sucking a lemon.
Harry, when pressed, would admit with a sheepish half-tilt of his lips that Albus Severus was his favorite child. Al was quiet, a dreamer, and he looked like his dad with the unexpected sarcasm to match, and Harry might have felt just a little bit guilty about the name (but it was too late, now).
Harry was - he would have to admit that he was struggling. He wasn’t really sure who he was supposed to be, anymore. All of the good things about him were tainted by the knowledge that he had been brought up to die. Did he really - could he really say that he existed at all? That he was a real person, with valid desires, worth something more than a pawn in someone else’s plan, destined to be sacrificed?
He worked harder than he ever had at Hogwarts, and he liked it, back in the grind, working at the club all day, classes in the evenings, studying, drinking coffee, weaning himself off the cigarettes, and if his magic exploded every once and a while and he cried and raged it was just - just a part of the experience. College stress, and running the books for Colin, and forgetting to eat, now that Harry wasn’t there to -
He was breathing hard and his vision was red around the edges, afternoon light flaring in the corners of his eyes, and Harry’s cock was thick under him, and he was smiling and smiling, and he hated him, he hated him so much, and he grabbed his horrible hair in two fists and touched their lips together, finally, and devoured him.
He took a drag from his cigarette, whirled drunkenly, glared with swollen eyes at his father’s curtained portrait.
He placed Scorpius’s letter to the side, opening a few others - a quick note from Pansy (he really should get Scorpius to stop calling her Auntie Pants, but it was just too wonderful), excited about Hyacinthe’s sorting. A letter from Greg, who was still fiddling around with chocolates in Belgium (and who was rather good at it). A few paragraphs - in non-linear, abstract form - from Luna, who still seemed to like him all these years later.
Fifteen minutes later and he’d acquired some sort of blue concoction which tasted like coconut and orange. He tried to take small sips, pacing himself, and then he noticed -
He read it over, once more, and sealed it to be sent in the morning. As he lay in bed, the words echoed, over and over, so endless that he heard them in his sleep -
Music was what kept him going - the kind of music that his parents had never let him listen to, ugly and wailing and wild, soft and heartbreaking, stupid and silly and utterly perfect. Led Zeppelin blared out when he smoked his first spliff (courtesy of that same upstairs neighbor, who was quite sketchy indeed, but with an apartment full of exotic birds and a too-kind heart). Tiffany sang about being alone, and he danced in front of the cracked mirror while he cut his own hair.
He’d just unlocked the door to his hotel room. Draco stepped in, took one look around, and whirled on Harry.
He wanted - he wanted to memorize all of him, all of this skin like new ivory, all his little sounds and sighs. He licked the juncture between his legs, sucking on the soft skin, the fine seam between his bollocks; he swallowed around his prick, rapidly filling, taking him in as far as he could. Weeks and weeks of this - he knew Draco’s body, knew that he could fit him down the back of his throat, nose pressed into curled golden hair.
So much of those years, with his two best friends, was watching them snipe, be jealous, be possessive - reject each other, need each other. The three of them were busy saving the world (and if he were completely honest, it was probably Hermione doing the bulk of the saving) but they were also - Ron and Hermione - they struggled. They fought.
He licked his lips, feeling gold leaf under his tongue, and he thought about tight jeans and a thick cock and the look on his face, pained and desperate and hungry, and the way his mouth watered, and the brief moment when he’d considered unzipping those trousers, and -
He remembered the night that they’d both tried to fit in his tiny shower cubicle. How it was fun, and silly, and kind of sexy, until it wasn’t anymore - Harry breathing too hard, showing the whites of his eyes like a spooked horse, freezing cold and sweating buckets. Wrapping him up in blankets, holding him, as he spoke in a toneless voice.
And it was Harry who said it, and Draco growled again like a bear in a trap, bit that place on Harry’s neck which never had time, now, to heal, and Harry pulsed and poured out what felt like a lifetime of come, holding onto Draco like a vise.
He took one last look at his best friends in the entire world, and maybe he should have felt a bit sad. But when he felt that hook, deep in him, of the portkey, he thought, thank fuck.
Finishing his second cigarette, he wedged himself into the closet-shaped shower, not waiting for the cold water to heat up. A quick scrub with Tesco-brand soap, a brush of his teeth, and he fluffed his hair with a threadbare towel before running a bit of pomade - his last luxury - through the asymmetrical strands.
“God, I love that,” he reached down and wrapped his hand around the base of his cock, “I wanna be the first and the la-”
A double measure, when Harry was married, and another when he saw James’s birth announcement in the prophet.
Longbottom - and who knew he’d be headmaster, but he seemed to be good at it - had firecalled him around 10:00 at night. He’d been going over his investment portfolio - and his former housemates were doing very well, Pans with her estates, Greg with the Belgian chocolates, Blaise rolling in galleons since he figured out the charms for those muggle music devices - and had just changed into his dressing gown. Hoping to get a good night’s sleep; praying that he wouldn’t dream about -
Harry wrapped his arm around, taking up Draco’s cock, moving with just the right amount of pressure.
And the bloke in front of him was attractive enough, but he couldn’t help compare - his hair was too tidy, his leer too obvious, and whatever he was grinding up against Draco’s leg was… unsatisfactory.
Ron and Hermione had, of course, showed up to see him off. Hermione had prepared his suitcase with an extension charm, and Ron had given him some dubious advice about picking up American women (“One hint of your accent and they’ll be lining up, you’ll see”) despite never, in fact, having met one. Ginny had talked about coming to wave him off, too, but she’d been asked to try out for the Harpies, and anyway…
It was a long slog, the death eater trials. Lucius’s trial was early on - his guilt beyond obvious, his crimes severe - but Narcissa and Draco weren’t tried until three weeks after that.
Harry walked further into the room, avoiding shards of glass and wood and pottery. He stopped, far enough away from Draco to be able to draw his own wand if it were necessary.
There was little tenderness here - and that was okay, sometimes they needed this; sometimes one or both of them needed something harder, more painful, to fuck away the bad stuff. Memories. Ghosts. Sins.
Pansy visited often. She still hated Harry. But she’d go all soft and tender at the pure, unreserved contentment on Draco’s face when Harry kissed him.
He barely looked at the wall - the gateway to the platform - because all he could think about was the softness of his wife’s, his soon to be ex-wife’s, cheek, and how that softness stopped being enough, somehow, and how was this going to work, and what would the kids do, and fuck, he probably totally missed the train. And he kept running through the wall, right into the back of another parent.
He looked at himself in the mirror, large and sparkling. Catalogued every fine line, the hairs turning silver, signs of maturity hard won since that summer in Cork.
“You needn’t act so shocked. Our lives would have been - well, quite different, had I made different choices.”
But from the moment Jamie had been placed in his arms - all ten pounds and fourteen ounces of him, because he’d inherited some of the strapping Weasley size, and Morgana bless Ginny for pushing him out - he felt something deep within him unclench. He’d never known love like this.
And that was the goddamned question wasn’t it, and there wasn’t really a good answer, and he started to feel angry.
He watched Draco’s back, the slender lines of the coat, the perfectly hemmed trousers, the impeccable posture, the long fall of shining hair.
He felt his shoulders tense up around his ears, and his arm burned, “I still did what I did,” a deep breath, “And with Harry -”
A year and a day later, Draco packed his case, turned off the lights in his apartment, left the keys with Cathal.
Quite a bit of text scribbled out there. Draco felt his shoulders inching towards his ears. He closed his eyes, breathed out, and skipped down to what was legible.
The towels were fluffier, somehow, and the dark of the night was more profound, and they were slick with oil, and Harry laid Draco out on the duvet, face against the pillows, drew his hips up and back -
Clutching his mug, he came over and sat primly on the far end of the couch - as far from Harry as he could get. Harry sighed.
On his fifth night, he’d actually fallen asleep in the loo, which is where the day manager found him that morning. He’d shouted and cussed, Draco had screamed a bit, and then Colin looked at him - he was probably too thin, and worn out, and pitiful - and he said, “You’d might as well make yourself useful,” and handed him a bin liner.
The air was entirely still. A heavy bass thrummed around them. The lights flickered, graffiti shining on the walls.
“Astoria was a wonderful wife. She has been a good mother to Scorpius. She’s beautiful, entertaining, and my mother cares for her.”
He placed his hand over Harry’s on his chest, a silver band on Harry’s fourth finger complimenting the gold on Draco’s, and laced their fingers together.
Muggles. They usually thought it was cool, and for a few moments he allowed himself to believe them.
“Yeah. But,” she sat up straight, firm, “What happened when we were kids - all of that - I know you, I know you didn’t get to make a lot of your own choices.”
He blinked and cleared his throat. Ron let him compose himself, getting a couple of lagers from the fridge.
And Draco was so angry. He took Harry into him, both of them still wet, and it was rough and so, so good.
It was the barista, of course. He was leaning one hip against the wall, zipper at Harry’s eye level when he picked his head up off the table. Harry stared up at him - a cheeky grin at the corner of his thin lips, all his body language saying, “take me home, will you?”
And then Harry was thinking about Draco, who he’d seen every day in eighth year. Draco, who - after that one meeting at the manor - totally ignored him, and withdrew from everyone else. Draco, who he couldn’t call Malfoy anymore, not even in his head.
He shut his mouth and looked a bit like he’d swallowed a toad. It was a terrible face, and it made something in Harry’s chest melt.
She looked up at him from her perch on the end of the bed. He had a feeling that the question wasn’t exactly what - she wanted to ask something else.
And every little part of him, the broken bits, the whole bits - every breath which reminded him of cigarettes at midnight - every time his mother looked at him with a vague, muted disappointment - every time he saw green eyes in the newspaper - every morning when he didn’t wake up in that shitty flat with Cathal and the parakeets upstairs and the old record player and the LPs which skipped -
Harry sucked hard - he smelled so good, how was he always so perfect - then laved him with gentle swipes of his tongue when Draco dug his heels under his shoulder blades.
“Draco,” her eyes were soft around the edges, “You gave me a grandchild. You’ve raised him very well - better than we did, you. Astoria as your wife, or not, you’ve made our family proud.”
He picked up the bottle, drank for three precise seconds, and offered it to Harry, who shook his head. He wiped his lips with the back of his hand, marked with Harry’s blood.
Pouring himself into that heat, every inch of him, and how was it possible with that slender body with the silvery scars and the blackened tattoo and God, no one told him it could feel like this -
Harry, bless him, actually took the biscuits out of the oven. Pansy hugged Draco very tightly indeed, and whispered a simple but eloquent, “What the fuck?”
Fuck you, Potter. He dunked his head under the water, and if there were any tears they washed away, down into the drain.
Harry looked down. The blue and white china had indeed cut him, and he was bleeding - more than a little.
He laughed, bitter, “I know what parts of you want,” and he reached forward as if to run his hand along Potter’s length, stopping less than two centimetres away, “I’m not so sure about the rest of you.”
Wetness gathered in his eyes, his nose stuffed up, and maybe this is what he’d been scared of, in the coffee shop, and in the flat, and each day that he’d made himself survive, numb, without Draco.
It wasn’t great money but for now it was enough. And Colin had just started him on other tasks - he had some ideas about events and publicity - and most of all he felt useful, which was an entirely new sensation.
“Why are you getting a divorce?” he shot back, fast. A little too loud. And he made the toad face again.
She tip-toed her way into the room on scandalously high heels and stared down at him, stern but not cruel.
“Merlin, you just had to be hung, didn’t you,” he muttered entirely to himself, “How the fuck are you fitting in those jeans?”
And little Hya Zabini dug in the gardens with Scorpius, getting dirty and laughing and trailing mud all through the manor -
The flavor - peat, smoke, herbs - was full of intensity, at first, because as he sipped it his mind was taken over by that night. Harry’s smell, Harry’s taste. Records playing. A soft rain. But as the years progressed, the whiskey started to taste like his life, now, with all the bitterness and numbness. He measured out his life in glasses of whiskey, and Harry’s life, too, and by now the flavor was dry as ash.
“‘S’all right,” he took a big pull on his bottle, “Reckon you have a right to be, every once in a while.”
Back at the flat - as they cleaned themselves up, went back for drinks, for more dancing - a mouse skittered over parchment, crumpled up and shoved under the bed. A bit of writing flashed in the shift of light - “Dear Harry,” it said, and there might have been other words, letters like W, maybe, or G - but the rest was hidden in shadow and ash.
Scorpius and Albus were thrilled to be roommates, naturally, and they were two peas in a pod - getting into trouble every once in a while, but also earning high marks and being, in general, great kids. It all went very well until that summer before their seventh year, when Harry’d walked into their room, and -
Kingsley - “We’re doing the best that we can, Harry,” - and maybe, maybe he should help. He should, because that was what he was good at, wasn’t it?
Draco was sweet and smooth from oil, and Harry pressed the flat of his tongue against his entrance, then kissed him there, filthy, the way he kissed his mouth.
It was an uncomfortable thing to acknowledge that someone could hate you, and you could hate them, and it didn’t really matter at all. Snape was a hero, Harry was an idiot, and the world kept turning.
Draco leaned back, body relaxed now, but truly snakelike, with a promise of violence. He smiled a creamy smile.
He moved his hand down his body, running over lithe muscle, over soft, fine hair. He felt himself grow hard. He tried to put together images, not a person - a mouth, open; unruly hair, pulled under his fingers; tanned skin, sweating; music, smoke, darkness; a choking sound, as he pushed too deep, over and over…
He cleared his throat - Scorpius blinked up at him, and Al just glanced over as if he’d known Harry was there all along.
He left him in that bathroom - ran away, panicked, terrified of his own capacity for violence and the sudden knowledge, the true root of him, the explanation, the reason he kept going, day after day, Draco, hated, beloved, beautiful as he was baptized by his own blood. It was a hideous kind of love, nothing warm or soft about it - it wasn’t like the love he had for Ginny, who was sweet and kind and a little acerbic and a lot stubborn, a girl who loved him back, who made him feel good about himself, and who felt like family already.
“That’s the thing, Gin,” and that pressure pushed harder, like every part of him was going to break, “I don’t know if I know how.”
“I do,” he wrapped a hand around Draco’s cock - hard and hot and fuck, so ready - and pushed two fingers into him, curling up. Draco raised his chest, head thrown back, stomach concave - and he was like a fucking sculpture, right here in this moment, in marble, glittering, something fit for a museum, something to worship.
“I would be more than delighted to kill him for you,” she did not sound like she was joking, “And I represent some great properties, you know - places to hide the body.”
It all went too fast and not fast enough. Thom used a lot of lube, and he slipped in and out of Draco’s body, and he kept trying to cradle Draco’s face in some misplaced nod to tenderness. Draco shoved his hand in the direction of his cock, and he gripped it softly.
He grinded his teeth and considered telling her where, exactly, her so-called straight husband had on many memorable occasions put his mouth.
Ron was saving up galleons, working at the joke shop, to buy Hermione a ring, and Hermione knew about it, because of course she did, but she kept it to herself. Because she wanted to let him have the experience, Gin said, of asking for love and getting a resounding and unreserved yes.
Harry spread out, legs open, nudging his knee against Draco’s foot, “That’s my ex-wife you’re talking about.”
It was still early, barely anyone passing him on the pavement. He stuck his hands in his pockets and felt his shrunken suitcase, and realized that if he didn’t want to sleep rough - in an unfamiliar city, no less - he’d have to find someplace to stay.
Draco pulled his hip, tilting it with unerring precision, still knowing all the secrets spots, and Harry did take his hand off the window and held him, wrapped his arm back, fingers scraping the back of Draco’s scalp, and he came in such agony all over the window, and Draco cried, brokenly, “Harry.”
“But then you tripped, coming back down the stairs to the dungeons, and fell out from under the cloak,” another nod, “And you were found out by your head of house.”
James plastered his room with posters of musicians and athletes, muggle and magical, and Harry and Draco switched on the built-in silencing charms after the first night of too-loud rapping at arse o’clock on a Tuesday.
He did wonder, as he ripped off his clothes and gasped his way into the hot water, why he felt the way he did, all light and fluttery, when the bloke he was so busy fucking told him to shut up.
Potter was none too gentle getting through the crowd. He shoved aside the bloke - entirely forgotten - in front of Draco, getting a nasty look and then a hasty retreat in response. And Draco couldn’t blame him - Potter looked, for once in his life, every inch the savior of the wizarding world. He was thick with muscle and taller than Draco remembered him, and there was something dark behind his eyes.
“Yes,” he actually sounded scared, which was smart of him, then resolute, “I won’t hurt him, Pansy. I -”
He went to the windows, staring out over London, and hoped. It was so quiet. Then a low voice, closer than he expected, almost in his ear.
The American girl, Britt, held up another red white and blue shot. They cheered - a muddled “Slainte!” - and tossed them back. Liam rolled his eyes and set up the next round.
All of those dreams broken. And he had worked towards that end. At one time, he had wanted them dead.
And Draco bent him over the sink, their flushed, damp faces panting in the mirror, Harry’s scar as red as blood, Draco’s black mark visible as he held himself against the wall, and it must have been close to the way that dragons make love, high up in the air, with sparks and shards of lightning.
So he leaned forward and bit Potter’s hot neck, hard, and Potter groaned, some animalistic thing he’d never imagined but suddenly couldn’t live without, and Potter was unzipping his jeans, and he quickly unzipped Potter’s, and they were both bare in the damp-cool night, and Draco took them both in one hand -
“You can’t do it, can you? Telling me you’re here to beg - to beg me to -” his voice broke off, thick, “And you can’t. Just another fucking lie.” He threw his cigarette across the room.
He stared at rows of bottles, shining in the light - clear, claret, amber, dusty green - and realized he had tried almost every liquor in the place. He was struck by an almost physical ennui. He was bored, tired of everything, his life settled and his fate sealed. And when he saw this bottle of whiskey, he remembered the first night that he and Harry had danced until sunrise.
Parkinson, whom he’d spotted having too many cocktails with Blaise Zabini, and the few words he’d overheard the last time he was in the Three Broomsticks.
They shared one of those looks that only long-time partners can share. Ron tilted his head, and Hermione spoke first.
“And you do not need to explain it. You are a man grown. We cannot change the past. But Draco,” she leaned forward in her chair, and he did, too, their faces so close, “You’ve been so terribly unhappy.”
“You don’t need to tell me that it was our fault,” Draco walked over to a table with a decanter of some brown liquor, removing the stopper and swallowing a generous mouthful, “I know what we are.”
“Come on, Harry. You can’t tell me that you’re not looking forward to climbing a certain blonde bastard like a tree as soon as possible.”
He nearly came from Potter’s gravelly voice, and that wouldn’t do, so he bit Potter again, and spoke in low tones -
“We were young, I know that now, though it didn’t feel like it at the time. Maybe - maybe you thought that telling me that you - that you - ugh.”
“I realized, in the end,” his voice was relaxed, like they were discussing the weather, “That you didn’t mean it.”
Harry stood in the doorway, absolutely awkward and out of place, but he - he didn’t notice the mess, any of it, and didn’t even glance at Pansy or her French lace stockings with frilly suspenders - he was just staring at Draco with such naked intensity that - fuck, maybe she was right.
He thought about home, Ron and ‘Mione and, oh God, Ginny - what would they think, if they knew that the most pleasurable moment of his 19 years was clutching at Draco in the dark, giving in? He tried to imagine kissing Ginny, winding his fingers through her flame-bright hair - he felt an echo of love, like a sepia-toned photograph. Something precious but aged, like a snapshot in a family scrapbook.
Black and white - morality, duty, good and evil, a chess game with clear rules, things he should and shouldn’t do.
The door slid open, and they walked through a lobby with marble floors, a large floral arrangement sitting on a cherrywood table, an elaborate but modern chandelier, two lifts.
The air in the flat was thick with smoke and sweat and buried rage. Draco stood, went to the window, opened it.
Hermione crossed to the range and peered at him, trying to guess how many biscuits her husband had eaten, “And if you wake up with a sore stomach in the night, you’d better leave me out of that, too.”
When Harry and Draco thought about this undiscovered path, they couldn’t be sure, really, if they would have run away - if they would have shared that tiny apartment in Cork, or had a scalding hot bath in a fancy hotel, or fucked with such frenzy against the wall of a nightclub. Draco wondered if he would have learned the value of plain, hard work, scrubbing floors and counting the till. And Harry thought that maybe he wouldn’t have his three children - four, now, counting Scorpius - whom he loved so completely. Both of them longed so hungrily for a better past, a history which didn’t hurt so damned much, and Draco dreamed about a life without the mark on his arm and the heavy press of his father’s hand; Harry craved parents who cared.
“Oh, I dunno,” he nudged Draco’s shoulder, “I may need to try it a few more times. Just to be sure.”
They moved against each other, trying not to draw attention, trying desperately not to laugh, and Harry came so hard that his vision blacked out around the edges.
A head with messy black hair appeared - and another flashback, that totally mortifying snowball fight - and he saw glittering green eyes which did not, at all, convey remorse. He balled up the cloak in his hands and fidgeted.
He folded in on himself, knees propped up, head dropped, the bottle dangling from his hand, “What are you doing here?”
His voice was softer than he intended, with an undercurrent of - something. Something too nice for the bloke you’d pulled off the night before. Draco blushed, just a pale tint of color.
This chapter means a whole hell of a lot to me. To put it bluntly, I was abused and neglected as a child, and my life has been colored by those experiences. I often think about who I might have been without that abuse - what other choices I might have made. I sought security, safety, and a gentle love above all else, and I neglected so many other parts of myself. Now, close to Draco and Harry's ages in this story, I'm figuring out that my trauma is not the only thing which defines me. That I am worthy of so much love.
“Well, not that this hasn’t been -” he laughed, half a breath, and ran a perfectly manicured hand through his still platinum hair - “Merlin, yes, this has been awful, good luck with the robes, Potter.”
Harry reached behind him, kept Draco buried deep, cried, came, and whispered back, flat, “Love you too, you tosser.”
“He,” Draco took a sip, moaned, “Merlin, this is good. He convinced my son to go wandering the Forbidden Forest, at night, for potions ingredients.”
Singing along with the trad band at Art’s and shots of goldschlager and pulling down the back of his jeans and
And, as much as he hid from it, raged against it silently, locked it up in a dark cupboard with the spiders and the broken toy figures and mouldy crumbs - he knew exactly when wanting him shamed and bloody and broken revealed itself as wanting to hold him and never let go.
When his alarm went off, Harry burrowed his head further into the down pillows and groaned. Why was he waking up this early?
If he let his vision relax - if he let himself see details like abstract snatches of bad dreams, he could almost pretend that the dark hair under his fingers was blacker, messier, softer. He pulled on Thom’s scalp when he got too close.
Pansy turned to look at him with a face that said, “Is this fucker for real?” Draco shrugged and fought the urge to laugh.
They stepped into the lift, and Draco scanned his thumb again, a light popping on for the top floor.
“But if you come back, it’ll be you begging,” the lock clicked open, and Malfoy turned back and fucking winked, “And I won’t stop.”
Miles away, up in Brú na Bóinne, a man both young and old fished in the river - a basket of glimmering trout next to him, Caer waiting at home, pressing golden and silver apples into cider, as she had done for thousands of years.
“Let the line die with me. Here lies Draco Lucius Malfoy,” he gestured broadly, “Good fucking riddance.”
“I don’t know why you followed me here, Potter. Maybe you’re having some sort of post-war crisis - frankly, I don’t particularly care.
“You have a lot of nerve to talk about family. You’re going to stand here and talk shit, like you had the perfect childhood? Pretend that your father isn’t a boot-licking monster?”
It probably felt awful. And yet it was so obvious, from the outside, that they were meant to be together.
“Beg!” he lit another cigarette - God, how could he still smoke like this - and offered one to Harry, “Sweet Merlin’s knickers, what the fuck.”
He felt a stiffness against his arse - a more respectable size, there, than whatever was in the other man’s trousers - and he arched back, turning his head and shout-whispering.
Harry wiped his hands, already sweating, on his trousers, as he stepped through the door. Long, crammed bookshelves lined the hall, and on the opposite wall were family portraits and candid snapshots - Rosie as a baby, and then flying her first training broom (and falling off). Molly and Arthur captured in a rare moment of romance, kissing in the back garden of the Burrow. Hugo on chubby legs chasing Crookshanks, who seemed to be practically immortal. Harry and Ginny and their kids. George, Angelina.
“Mmhmm,” they moved together, languid and loving and familiar and still, somehow, as fresh and new as Ireland in the summertime.
When they got back from their holiday, their lives linked up, blended almost seamlessly, as if it had always been that way - them, their families, their whole world. Everyone just called them “Harry ‘n’ Draco,” two individuals made into a single unit, never one without the other.
Harry exhaled. It sounded - pained, and so fucking good, and Draco laughed low in his ear, and Harry dropped his head to the crook of Draco’s neck, wild hair along the side of his face.
“Since you’ll be there,” she got a bit of a gleam in her eye - the one that always heralded ‘research,’ “You might as well see some of the murals. There are wizarding ones, you know.”
With the movement over him, in him, and the hollow physical pleasure, and the smell of Thom’s cheap cologne, Draco let his mind wander. Float. He let himself be lost in this, another man’s body, the mechanics of fucking, a numbness.
“No, Malfoy. I’m here to -” and he pulled Draco’s wand from his pocket, “I just - you should have this back.”
He crossed the river, took a turn - entirely on some unknown instinct - and found himself in front of a large, Victorian building. The Metropole Hotel.
He felt a tear gather in the corner of his eye. As it fell, she brushed it away with the tissue-paper tenderness of her lined fingers.
How he’d dreamt of lazy mornings, drinking the dregs of canned cider, burying his face in the soft hair along Draco’s neck, kissing him between cigarettes. Planning a life, a little bit.
He heard whispering in the hall. He tilted his head at Gin, who shrugged, and he walked over towards the door.
