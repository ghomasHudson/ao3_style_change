Harry was mildly annoyed, not because he hadn’t suspected that something was up, but because Draco’s sudden reported absence was an immediate inconvenience. Perhaps he should have intervened sooner, or pushed harder with question about Draco’s recent moody silences and occasional absences, but the boy had seemed diffident and comfortable, smoothly claiming that nothing was wrong and that he was spending extra time with his studies. Harry had taken it at face value, based on the fuzzy notion that he had a certain rapport with Draco that others did not. It was specifically annoying to think of himself as having been deceived.
“Is there another kind? You won’t believe this shit. There was a power outage. A ’flicker’ that lasted eight minutes. Guess when?”
And share in its shame.
It’s hard to tell because his skin is so tanned, but when our eyes meet across the table, I think he blushed! He did! I’d swear to it! He fucking blushed! I can actually feel my half dead ego inflating to new heights. I can make a stone cold killer blush…at six-thirty in the morning…while my hair is a mess and I’m wearing huge pajamas! Maybe I don’t know if I’ll stay or go…but I think this going to be a great day.
Harry’s fragile grip on his temper snapped. His wand was in hand before he knew what he was doing.
Then there was the appalling lack of sex in his life. It may have been easy for some, but Harry’s fame added certain complications. He’d rather liked Cho…except for her wild mood swings. He’d really liked Ginny, but she seemed almost like a sister to Harry, who had been unofficially adopted by the Weasleys.
The girls were off with a few giggles and waves goodbye, and Draco was alone in the antechamber off the gardens again. So little time left...he could spend the last of it staring into the mirror and ruminating about the past. Better than pacing. It had all worked out in the end. Harry Potter, of all people, had made him happy, content, relevant and nearly confident. It defied reason to some, but Draco understood it.
The Echoes Of Yesterday…by Samayel
Harry hadn’t bathed yet, either, and though he joined Malfoy in the warm water, there was no intimacy in it, and no conversation between them as they cleaned themselves.
That muted chuckle I love so much is back. The corner of his mouth is curled into a smirk.
Ron’s plaintive tone made Harry relent. Something really interesting was up. Who were these others? Harry picked up his wand.
TBC!!!
The Curse (Part 7 of 7) by Samayel
It feels like Harry’s been in there forever. Outside of Sir Albus’ private offices, there’s a small waiting room, where all I can do is sit in a comfortable old lounge chair, the kind that old fashioned gentleman’s clubs once sported, and just wait for my turn. The only other person in the room is the secretary and assistant, the same one who helped him into the dining area, and when she greeted Harry formally, I knew she was the woman on the other end of the phone last night.
Minerva McGonagall set her jaw. Harry was very dear to her, but this was becoming a bit trying. The intractable young lord wanted Harry, and would simply leave and do who only knew what without Harry Potter as his mentor. The situation was decided, and it was just a matter of getting Harry to accept that fact.
His back to the Aurors, Draco mouthed the plea he didn’t dare voice in front of others. His lips silently worked to shape the words ’Please…I need you.’ Harry grabbed a coat off the back of a chair and conjured his keys and wand into his hands.
He’d had no real prejudice for or against either gender, but if anyone had told him that, two months later, he would be steeped in more sexual lore than a rent boy, and be Draco Malfoy’s exclusively bottom plaything, he would have thought that person to be barking mad, and would have recommended a room at St. Mungo’s!
Harry was amenable to any subject that Draco wanted, as long as it kept him talking, then it hit him. Draco was pushing things away, changing the subject, like he’d done for too many other things. He needed to keep some pressure on Draco, but how much was too much? Again, he remembered that the skill of a professional might be called for, and he just didn’t have that.
It wasn’t that he didn’t like the notion of shagging Draco, but, at least for their first time, it just seemed right. Harry suspected that, given Draco’s Slytherin heritage and upbringing, it would be very difficult for him to be comfortable surrendering that much control…at least until he’d seen Harry do it first.
Greg nodded, then pointed to a manila envelope on the far counter. “Yeah. Right there. They dropped it off at nine. You want some eggs?”
Wanking had lost its charm, now that it was leaving Harry miserable and ashamed of thinking about anyone other than Draco, and thinking of Draco simply ruined the exercise completely. Harry’s sex drive, once rampant with desire for a lover’s touch, had simply shriveled and disappeared, save for occasional brief, uncomfortable reminders at odd times, and even those were dealt with distastefully.
Harry set the salads on the table. The roast would be done just about the time they finished this first course, and he took his seat and his glass of wine with a grin.
It took a few more assurances and some solemn oaths about his undying love for his mother to get off the phone and back to his breakfast, but Blaise took his own safety fairly seriously anyway. Maybe calling Greg and Vinny and having them stay in the guest rooms for a little while wasn’t such a bad idea after all.
He left his two bodyguards in the car, waggling his eyebrows suggestively, savoring the knowledge that he always got the most premium girls as often as he liked. Waiting upstairs and down a hall was a nineteen year old from just outside Shanghai that had been in the U.S. less than three months, and had worked for him for less than three weeks. Without bad habits or a long history behind her, she was still pretty, but had just enough experience to do all the right things. She wasn’t any better or any worse than any other girl Johnny visited, but she was new, and that made her a refreshing change of pace.
------------------------------------------------------------
I get introduced to the British term for kissing. Apparently, in this part of the world, it’s called snogging. Sounds gross when you say it like that. Like some kind of activity that involves coughing up mucous or something equally unpleasant. After all the books I’ve read, I always imagined the English would have a slightly more, you know, poetic…term for kissing, but I guess I can’t complain.
“I have been told that…that I am occasionally…intemperate…and that I sometimes speak my mind under inappropriate circumstances.”
“Harry. I’ve waited years to feel like this for someone. There are days when it actually hurts me not to be able to do this. I’ve wanted you in every way since that first night in the baths, and I’m not one bit ashamed of it now. I want this…and I want you.”
The world shifted and twisted once again, and now they stood hand in hand in the little cottage on the coast once more. It didn't feel like a gravesite anymore. It seemed more like a beginning than an end. Perhaps it was just that Harry now saw everything through the lens of undiluted joy and relief. Draco wouldn't be here, trapped in this place between places forever, and life would go on, but he'd heard the words his heart had pined for during twenty long years of grief, and now he could let go of the bitterest moments of their past.
It was the kind of summer day where Remus carried his jacket in his hand instead of wearing it, because the heat of summer was making things a little sticky for everyone. The bus was packed, as usual, and Remus sat near the back and just smiled while he stared out the window. He’d been up and down these same streets a few hundred times, and yet today they looked cleaner and brighter than he remembered.
Harry’s lips moved back up Draco’s neck while answer was breathed in a mutter just beneath his ear.
“I think I can manage something like that. I still can’t believe I’m seriously considering this. Not what I had written into my plans for the evening…let me tell you that! You’re something else, Luna. See you sometime soon.”
Draco could see why Harry hadn't been keen on living in the place, even without harsh memories and bittersweet ones. It was in appalling condition by any standard, and oppressively gloomy. It took days just to clean rooms and move furniture around enough to start painting. Being unfamiliar with the craft of housepainting, neither of them were especially skilled at preventing mishaps and having to clean up errors...at least until Draco took some initiative and bent the rules in true Malfoy fashion, not using magic to paint the walls, but using it discretely to prevent mishaps. Harry ferociously disapproved and considered it a violation of his original plans...for about two days...when he grudgingly asked for the innovated Charms being used and how to cast them himself.
He goes over the rules for nightclubs. He’ll enter just a little after me, so that we aren’t associated as a couple, then he’ll case the place and check the exits, watching me the whole time. He won’t intervene unless I’m in physical danger, or if I make a scene and endanger myself. He gives me a hand signal I can make if I want to be extracted from the building quickly, and that’s all there is to it. He’s wearing a sharp suit that will blend well anywhere, so he’ll be buying himself non-alcoholic beverages and sticking near the walls until I’m ready to go. Pretty simple stuff. Combine that with his usual instructions to obey him implicitly if he needs to swing into action, and our rules are in place for the evening.
Lord Byron’s book had soaked up the tea in a way befitting a thirsty Englishman, and it took several spells to set it right before he fixed the china. Harry missed his evening drink more than ever this night. The calm that had suffused him during that nightly ritual was what he missed most. Not the drink itself, but the association of stability and peace.
“You are his mentor again, so it seemed appropriate to mention it to you. He just seemed distracted. Like his mind was somewhere else. His work was above par, but he didn’t really participate the way he normally does. At least in my class…he always has questions…which is good because half the time we don’t really have answers and the point is to refine and create better questions. Today he just seemed absent. It reminded me of something, but I can’t put my finger on it.”
“Oh. Heh. Okay then. Never mind.”
“Our population, unchecked by predators, war, disease or any instinct to maintain modest numbers, has grown astronomically in just my lifespan. Our technology too has leapt forward in just the space of generations. The whole of human history, millennium piled atop millennium, has never witnessed such a complete and overwhelming explosion of population. Only now have the once abundant resources of this planet become stretched, divided between those who are fortunate enough to have, and those who have not.
“Oh…I’ll just forgive your insolence…for a price. If you complete the deal, you’ll have your reward…but I mean to see it done. Go back to him. Destroy him utterly. Make him certain that he’s been exploited and thrown aside…and when his suffering is the talk of the town…you’ll have won the right to me. Nothing less, nothing more. Seduce…and destroy. That was the bargain.”
“I will not believe a student of mine cast one of the unforgivables!” Harian looked at Karkaroff. Was he really that stupid.
Yes, Harian couldn’t believe the names he gave their children. At least he was nice enough to give them her parents names. Draco smiled at his wife and gave her a small kiss, rubbing her stomach. They had tried to have kids soon after Levita, but to no avail. Years later they had Cedric, and now Damian.
“AH, but Sirius doesn’t. Can you explain?” Harian nodded. She then went into the story of constant bullying, arguments, the hate from Gryffindor house,and what went on today.
Yes, Yes he did. Your Dumbly-dore is very kind.” Harian giggled and conversed with the girls.
“You can’t do that? We aren’t from England!” The siblings yelled.
“What the bloody hell is that supposed to mean! Me and Harian are pretty smart ourselves!” Hermione rolled her eyes.
“Papa, Pater, this is Draco Malfoy. My boyfriend.” She introduced. Malfoy held out a hand, nervousness ranking through his body. Sirius gave him a once over, nodding in approval. He shook the boy's hand, and gave a small bow.
When the siblings walked out, all of the judges raised there wands, casting numbers into the air.
“Why? I do not have the mark.” Suddenly a stupefy was shot, Sirius over him pulling the sleeve back. Printed there was a still dark mark. A few gasps went around the rooms. Soon the Minister spoke up.
“What happened two nights ago?” Dumbledore asked. Moody pointed his wand at the first Crat brother.
“It’s fine Harian. I forgive you!” Her voice was sickeningly sweet. She caught Ron rolling his eyes. Harian now knew why he did it after every time they argued.
“The first task, it’s Dragons isn’t it?” Dumbledore just gave her a wink.
And the unborn being
“No I am not. We will wait.” The Drumstrang Professor knew a command when he heard one.
look good. His hair was pushed back instead of down, giving it a little poof at the top. His silver grey eyes matched his emerald green suit. Though most wore robes to formal occasions like these, the competitions and their dates had to have a different outfit choice. Boys wore their suits, and girls had long, floor length gowns.
She bowed and was matched by the Dragon. Harian walked over and grabbed the golden egg. Holding it up, cheers rang through the stadium. Once she was ushered into the nurseing tent, Madam Pomfery lost it.
“Heir Malfoy, welcome to the Family.” Draco let a sigh of relief go and shook the werewolfs hand.
Too afraid to disobey the large dragon mother, Harian nodded and removed the cloak on her shoulder. A few scandalized gasps went through the crowd. The dragon picked up her talon and dragged it across the girl's shoulder, ending at her where her eyebrow was. She blew out steam, and screams went through.
“Yes you can.” His tone left no room for argument, and Harian sat down right next to him. She linked there fingers together, leaning over to rest her head on his shoulder.
“Then who did? You obviously asked an older year to do it! You probably just want the attention!” The bush girl yelled. Harian huffed and crossed her arms.
“RiRi.” Draco used Harians nickname. She giggled and let the taller blonde go. “Turn around.” Harian did, and soon Draco was putting her hair up into a short half up half down ponytail. It wasn’t done very well, but it would hold. Soon the Slytherins arms were wrapped around her shoulders, pulling her close again.
“Good luck. You know how you said you're going to do transfiguration?” The Hufflepuff nodded. “Do bright things and children toys. It will help.” Cedric gave her a quick hug and went out with a wand in hand. Soon Harian heard a whispering of her name. She walked towards the voice and saw Malfoy standing there.
“I know. Words just don’t do it, do they? We both needed that. I wish you’d come earlier. Before…everything. But who knows? Maybe I wouldn’t have been this happy to find you…if we’d met then. I’m happy, Harry. I’m not used to it, but I’m so fucking happy. You know this can’t end, right? Not without destroying me in the process. I belong to you. Just…take care of me…okay?”
Big Chicago Part 21...by Samayel
Harry expected outrage...and retorts, and he'd been exaggerating out of frustration just to get even, because he and Ron had never gotten past a few side by side wanks...but all Harry heard was sudden silence followed by a loud thump. Harry let go of his dick and peered around the open door of the bathroom. "Draco?"
There are only two real classes. The truly rich, and everybody else. I’ve lived in both states, walked in both shoes, and it gives me a rather unique position in this world. I’m back in the world that supermodels and the companies who own them shop in, and I see the differences more clearly than ever. Harry has it, I have it for being with Harry, and the girl packing my purchases into bags and boxes doesn’t and probably never will.
I keep wandering the wrong way, or bumping into Harry when he stops too soon. In fact, it’s kind of hard to remember why I’m here or where I am for more than a few seconds. Not really complaining, mind you, since I was awfully demanding about an hour ago, but I swear…we’re lucky we landed safely, because I just got fucked so hard that he nearly put me through the wall of the plane. The things he said still ring in my ears, drowning out all those horrible thoughts that dogged my heels most of the way here, and they’re still at the front of my mind while we climb into the cream-white Bentley waiting for us.
The man on the floor gasped deeply, eyes slipping back into focus only for a second, fixing on the warm and yet frightened gray eyes just inches above him, then tilted his neck ever so slightly, just as Draco leaned that last measure closer, his mouth meeting Harry’s as gently as could be.
Ron nods, pensive. “Fred would hate it if we all cried today. It’s better this way, he’d love this.”
Laughter builds up in Harry’s chest. “Romance is dead, it’s gone, it’s buried and it’s not coming back.”
What? What else had Draco missed? “When did that happen?”
“If you could identify that language for us, it’d be appreciated,” Harry gestured towards the box, holding the small frame with one hand.
"How times change," the portrait observed, and Draco narrowed his eyes. Potter was still looking for his glasses with the bleary expression of those who hate mornings. It was cute. Even his disastrous hair melted Draco's heart. He was so gone.
"I can come with you—"
She moved away from him, still smiling, and he focused on the pictures. He had no idea he still had family aside from his parents. This kid… this should be the Black Heir, if his grandmother was reinstated in the family. He was so cute. One of the pictures was dated December 12th, a few weeks ago, so that meant Scorpius had a cousin his age. Perhaps he could have a friend? If Andromeda let him.
Sneaking a glance at Malfoy’s thigh, Harry scratched the back of his head, once more ashamed of their fight in Myrtle’s bathroom. “How do we get back out?”
That night, rain poured on the roof of the hotel, and lightning illuminated the rooms and hallways. Humidity compensated the drop in temperature, and Harry had long given up on sleep. He was a bit drunk, but more than that, he was naked on his bed and very, very horny.
“Oh, and Harry,” said Hermione, “don’t be nervous, we’re happy for you.”
and decided he should probably eat something more substantial than the bowl of soup he’d had for lunch.
What in the name of Merlin was wrong with that elf? And why didn’t Potter react? Draco watched, horrified, as the Golden Boy twirled a strand of hair around his finger (whoever told him to grow it out and tie it in that messy bun had Draco’s everlasting gratitude). “Kreacher, you can’t say that!”
“You’ve been sleeping better.”
Potter grinned, as if he thought Snarky Draco was funny. Since the world had turned upside down, it wouldn’t even surprise him that much.
It was childish, but Draco stood his ground. “I don’t want pasta. Or rice.”
For Draco, things aren’t that easy. When he’s lucky, he gets rejection letters. Most of the time, the Masters he contacts never reply. He’s still unsure about what he wants; any mastery in a subject he enjoys would be useful. It’s not like he has many opportunities. The Goblins eventually accept to take him on into the curse-breaking program so he can get valuable experience - perhaps he’ll end up working for them, maybe not. Still, it’s an offer he can’t afford to refuse for now, and it may become his ticket to the Department of Mysteries later.
“It’s fun,” Harry replies. He shrinks the books and puts them in his back pocket. “I like the younger brother.”
“I don’t want to be an Auror.”
Harry’s smile is weak, but his affection for the cranky elf calms him down. “Yeah, I’ll do that.” He takes a sip. “Thank you for the tea, Kreacher. You’re a good elf.”
“Yay!”
“Only sometimes?”
As soon as they stepped outside, they checked their surroundings and shrunk their bags when no one was watching. It was dark; they’d spent the entire afternoon walking around, and Draco had bought a shawl for his mum. They’d laughed, took a break in a coffee shop, talked about the week they’d just had at work and about that one Solstice celebration at Andromeda’s, when Draco had learned how to bake.
Okay, so what if Malfoy was a bit funny? Honestly, he was. Harry hadn’t kept the Potter Stinks badges in his trunk because they were fancy: he’d found them hilarious. When everyone changed their behaviour around him, Malfoy was always Malfoy, a constant in Harry’s life. He was so unnervingly different this year, and Harry hadn’t realised how much it bothered him until now. Only Harry’s presence revealed the old Malfoy, who was snappish and annoying and almost the same as he’d always been.
He fidgets with a shiny piece of wrapping paper. “To get laid.”
(Image: A Christmas tree at night by the Thames, with the tower bridge in the background)
“Exactly!”
When he finally Apparated to the Macmillan Estate in Inverness, he could tell something was wrong. Not much—not to the degree of his previous encounters. But the leeches must have been attached to Mrs Macmillan’s for a long time to affect her house in a noticeable way. The wards were ripped, hanging like torn curtains, and the mansion oozed sadness. It wasn’t as bad as Azkaban; it hadn’t switched to absolute despair yet. That was what leeches did, though. Like Dementors, they sucked out happiness and light from people and places. They didn’t steal their souls but sapped them of their will to live. Harry clutched his wand and let himself in through the broken wards. He had to find the source. Preferably before the woman came home.
and grabbed a pencil, holding it out to Harry. “Draw the house.”
Harry’s legs are shaking, but he manages it. He spots the Brewtiful Mandrake with its ridiculous Christmas decorations and lets out a shuddering breath. There’s another Apparition point there, he doesn’t need to try to reach a different one. Whoever chose to block Disapparition from the rest of magical London is a complete imbecile.
They should be taught about the wizarding world instead of being led to assume it was just a magical side of the same country they lived in. It wasn’t. Only an arbitrary piece of paper made Magical Britain
Draco shrugs. “It’s too big. I’m done with huge empty spaces.” He straightens his shoulders. “You know, it doesn’t have to be London.”
The sun is setting, and Harry leans back into his chair to watch the stars come alive.
Harry frowns and the top of his nose wrinkles. It’s absurdly cute. He shrugs and closes the magazine. “It still fits.”
” Harry’s heart started beating too fast. “
Fate has a different plan and leads them to a seaside town in Cornwall. It’s near closing time for the minuscule estate agency sandwiched between a coffee shop and a pharmacy, and they’re welcomed by a middle-aged woman who reminds Harry of Molly. She is eager to show them all the best properties in her catalogue. The list is short, but one house catches Harry’s eye. The pictures aren’t the most impressive, and Harry can’t put his finger on why he likes it, but it calls to him in a way that obscures every other property.
“So? Ron…you really haven’t ridden before, have you?”
Harry Black is coming here soon…if he’s still alive. I’m not gambling against him on that. He said he’d be here soon, and I bet that he’ll show up just like he said. When he gets here, all of this becomes real. Not a convenient dream or a vacation from hell. Real. I’ll have to pay for it.
Sobering thought, isn’t it?
The Savage Gambit (Part 2)...by Samayel
He had his own little estate, smaller than this by a long shot, but he didn’t wave his money around. He…I guess he knew that I hadn’t been...treated well, so he took a lot of time just to be with me and pound it into my head that I was worth something. It’s amazing what knowing that you matter to someone can do to your outlook. I was a really quiet kid. Didn’t like a lot of sports or take any risks. I was so fucking self conscious of every thing I did. No confidence at all. Until him. I could always tell that I was the most important thing in his entire world. I wanted to be like him more than anything else.”
The tension in his neck says he doesn’t appreciate being led to a conclusion that way, and he’s silent. Too long. We’re parking. He hasn’t budged yet. When he turns around, I feel a twinge of nerves. Just because he’s the driver, it doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to use that gun. Harry said he was a good shot too. Maybe I pushed too hard, too fast.
Draco finally, inevitably, took it a step further, and during a long and teasing session that Harry thought would end with Draco finally attending to Harry’s twitching cock, Draco ducked his head between Harry’s legs and swiped his tongue along just the rim of Harry’s arsehole.
I should be happier. It’s hard to remember that I was terrified of all this a few days ago. I guess I’m like that. Once I was free of prison, I turned back into the seventeen-year old that fell hard and fast for Blaise Zabini. I fell for a better class of man this time, but I fell just the same. I don’t have a middle gear. I went from zero to sixty in one second flat, like a racecar that spent too long idling and needed to tear screaming down the highway to feel right again. The minute I lost control of myself I crashed into love, and this is the burning wreckage. Nice things everywhere, and no Harry.
Harry teased and taunted, letting his mouth attend every part of Draco except the one that achingly demanded attention, straining upward and tenting the sheet that now covered them less and less. Draco could have sworn that the light in the room had grown dimmer, and then his mind became void of thought when Harry lapped his way to the weeping tip of Draco’s cock.
“You’re happy, right? I mean…it’s like you’re happier than you used to be. So…this makes you happy?”
And yet he surprises me at times. Pulling from me when I know he‘s so close, flopping me across the desk on my back, heels dangling and ankles held up and safe in his hands.
Faced with his sense of certainty and assured by him that all was well, no one pushed harder for more details, and Draco passed the months with only occasional sightings at the Burrow, Hermione and Ron's, or Grimmauld Place. His research had generally gone well over the years, and with two books and dozens of papers to his name, few doubted that he really did need the momentary privacy. No one could have imagined the temerity of his actions, or conceived of the momentous thing he was to attempt.
I can feel the panic coming on. The bass drum pounding of my pulse, the perspiration working its way out of every pore of my body and making my skin feel hot and tight. The irregularity of my breath while I try to look calm and keep my vision steady. I wish I’d taken that damn pill! Help!
Draco suddenly looked sad and serious, his smirk fading to a worried and tired expression that seemed out of place on a face that was still that of a young man.
Draco hung his head a moment, then whispered. “No. Not really. I was afraid, because I knew you wanted that someday, and…and because of what you did…after the snake. I don’t know…I was wrong.”
Unlike usual, Dream Harry was fully clothed. His hair was shorter and dark, no longer a flop of greasy violet. The face had no contempt anywhere to be found, just...a whiff of sadness...and a measure of pity. He wasn't sallow or hollow eyed...he was fit and clean. Draco blinked owlishly in the faint light. At the moment he lacked the strength to stand. He just stared, muttered something about cruel visions, and flopped forward to beg forgiveness at the feet of his Dream...and promptly passed back out.
I have shoes and stockings and socks, slacks and skirts and dresses, club clothes and evening gowns, pajamas and lingerie, hats and gloves and every beautiful little thing it takes to make a wardrobe. I have thongs that are both comfortable and just unbearably sexy. I’m almost afraid of the moment Harry sees me wearing one…because whatever self control he possesses might just evaporate on the spot. I’m dressed in the boy’s clothes now, because I need to make a special stop before I even consider wearing one of the outfits we got today. There’s a small store in Boystown that caters to queens, and they have the accessories I need to make certain outfits look right…up front. I don’t have much of a chest, and I have nothing in the way of cleavage anymore. I like the appreciative smirk on Harry’s face when I step out of the changing room as a boy. It makes my stomach flutter.
‘That right bastard! Prewett! If it’s the last thing I do…I’ll get him for this! I can’t believe he..’
“Your fingers were uneven, your hand was in the wrong position, your elbow was too low and that was the most undisciplined expression I’ve ever seen associated with a salute…but if good looks count for anything, you pass muster every time.”
John Prewett was practically family, and a thorough professional. He was nearing seventy years old, but was as hardy as a man of nearly half his age. There was a good chance that Prewett knew how to blend a few potions that might be more effective than the ones Harry had tried in the past, and that was a small hope to cling to, but Harry still felt his stomach flip when he thought of what Minerva meant to have him do.
“Why do you think I’m asking for your help?”
“Yeah, you’re right. Wait for me? I’ll get us a drink.”
Harry had known the risks by the time they’d left; it had been no real surprise when their careful calculations dumped them in the wrong year. It could have been much worse, though.
A visibly pregnant Cho opened the door, eyes widening at the sight of Harry. She wasn’t in Auror robes, but still wore the Department sigil on her breast. She was most likely on desk duty. “Err, is this a bad time?”
“That’s fine. Do your worst. To go, please.”
Harry hesitates. It’s a gorgeous night, without a cloud in sight, and the midsummer warmth is delightful. He doesn’t really want to sit in the sunroom until it’s time for bed. “Let’s go for a drive.”
The sound of the typewriter at the back of the room stopped. “Ooh, how interesting!” Lavender’s smirk could be heard in the tone of her voice, and it made Harry blush. Everyone—friends, acquaintances, employees—knew of his crush. Hermione would say he’d been too obvious about it.
The kitchen was only three steps away from the bed, so he was grateful for his husband’s thoughtfulness: Harry was already up and busy preparing breakfast, but there was no smell to bother him because he cast a bubble charm around the stove. One of the many reasons he loved the man and cherished every moment spent with him.
Harry kept hissing so the glow wouldn’t disappear. When he stood close enough, he let his vision return and sent short blasts of air to dislodge the sand and rocks at his feet. The air dug a small hole until it reached what Harry could only describe as an invisible shield protecting a jagged piece of metal. When levitated, the protective bubble didn’t burst into flames or change the nature of its magic, but Harry kept his distance despite his interest, slowly backing out of the tunnel. He wanted to know what that thing was and could barely contain himself.
Oh. Right. That reminds him of how bloody creepy Pettigrew was. Sleeping in a child’s bed for years? Living in his pockets? Not to mention the snivelling, the cowardice - Draco knows a bit about being a coward. But he did what he had to, to protect his family. Pettigrew betrayed his friends, pretended to love them while serving the one who wanted to kill them, all for his own interests. Pettigrew had no pride. He wasn’t threatened into service. He was a willing Death Eater, not because he believed so strongly in Pureblood supremacy, but because he was a twisted, sad excuse of a man and wanted to feel relevant and useful.
He grabs his Transfiguration essay and uses a textbook to support the parchment as he continues working on it. Studying, doing his homework - it helps him deal with the shitshow that plagues his life.
Eyes narrowing, Malfoy pondered the idea. “Potter, that spell will last until spring.”
“Do you want to go shopping with me tomorrow?”
Amused, he locked it in the box again and put it back under the bed.
For a brief moment, Malfoy looked like he’d just been insulted, but he huffed and murmured, “Who would hire me? I’ll take care of Mother, I guess.”
Mother and Scorpius accompany him as his body weakens.
“You weren’t sick.” Harry is confident about it. “You were afraid.”
“Malfoy.” Harry stepped closer and squeezed his upper arm. “I don’t mind. Can I?” He raised his hand, and when Malfoy nodded, he ran his fingers through soft, thick white-blond strands. Malfoy was now staring at him, a glimmer in his eyes and lips parted, and Harry couldn’t help himself. He pulled him closer, nose and forehead touching, still caressing his hair and trying to get his breathing under control. “Okay?”
“Ah, but where’s the fun in that?” Draco purred, stepping closer and drawing random shapes on Harry’s shirt with the tip of his index finger. “You interrupted a nice, quiet evening, one I was in dire need of. I should punish you.”
“Alright,” Draco said, indicating the end of his fragile post-rant state and making Harry cheer internally. He leaned back and summoned the map. “I want to check that rock again.”
Harry snickered as Malfoy kept glancing at every shadow as if he expected Kreacher to drag him into the darkness.
His eyebrows shoot up. “Did you write that?”
“Can you act civilised or were you raised in a barn? Honestly!”
Draco gently pushed him forward. “Isn’t it? It’s your room, Scorp.”
Harry did, and Draco got to work. It was so sticky, buttery, messy, just no fun at all. The butter melted too quickly on his skin; there was no crumbling happening. He thought there had to be a mistake in the book, so in the end, he rolled it into a ball and considered it done. Harry nodded, still excited for some reason, then asked Draco what was in a quiche, so Draco took some time to think. Having tasted more than his fair share of quiches in his life (he’d had a phase, okay?), he felt quite confident. The filling had to be at least a little liquidy. Milk would come in handy. He didn’t see any other ingredient that would make sense. So, he picked the milk and poured it all into a large glass bowl. “We need bacon,” he added as an afterthought, and Harry agreed and started cutting the meat in uneven cubes.
“George set up his own betting pool last time we hung out,” Hermione added with the look of a mad fiend. “You two were just so obvious, it was almost painful. I don’t understand how Ron
Honestly, the only problem with sleek, clean, minimalistic décor was that clutter was even more noticeable. Draco's brain whirred as he attempted to remember what Harry would find, and all he could do was frantically eye the place in search of underwear or sex toys that he may have left somewhere—like on the coffee table. While he did his best to conceal his growing panic, the tension in his shoulders gave him away.
Alright, he could do this. He could be friendly with Potter, even if he was acting suspiciously like Pansy at the moment and invading his private space. The worst part was that he didn’t mind—and while the bed was short, it was wide enough. Just like yesterday, it was nice when Potter didn’t direct his scorn at him. Not that it happened much this year.
Gabriel shook his head, his Veela ancestry giving him the predatory look that Draco had once seen on an incensed Fleur. “Moldu, avec quelques charmes en plus. Tu peux le faire disparaître.
“I’ll just go.”
Harry was now close enough to the entrance to see the snakes, and Malfoy noticed them immediately. He made a strangled noise. “Don’t tell me this is what I think it is.”
What? How?!
Harry blinked back tears. That sounded like a dream. He wasn’t asleep, was he? “I don’t know what to say,” he murmured in a strangled voice, his lips still close enough to feel Draco’s.
“We buried our dead, but we were left with a few children who couldn’t wake up, yet still breathed. We studied that metal piece day and night. Rowena called it a Mind Compass after discovering how it could enslave the minds of a great many people at once—the engravings are a guide. Its magic is neutral because it can also be used to heal, as we realised when Godric experimented with it as a last resort to keep our unconscious students alive. He described the magic of the Compass as something akin to Parselmagic, with the mapping and diving beneath any surface. I’ve never used it and am unable to compare them. In the end, the children woke, and while their health never fully recovered, they lived long and fruitful lives.
Draco spoke to Harry about it once, when he told him about forgotten magic. He didn’t think Harry would remember, let alone care!
Officially, Malfoy was registered as a researcher of Non-Human Spiritous Apparitions, like Remus’ dad had been. And he did research them. He’d helped get rid of the Dementors by sending them back where they came from—an impressive achievement. But his true calling was offering his scrying services to those in need. Those who sometimes noticed that door in Carkitt Market.
“I just paid you a compliment! You’d better savour it, Chosen One.” Draco leaned down and caught Harry’s lips between his teeth before slipping his tongue into his mouth. He moved his hips gently, focused on the hands caressing his back and cupping his arse, and reached beneath the fabric of Harry’s pants to free his cock. Languid strokes matched the rhythm of their kiss until Harry came all over Draco’s fist.
is teaching him things he didn’t know, opening his mind to traditions and old practices that are part of his heritage. He tells him how idiotic he is for choosing Divination and Potter laughs and replies that he’s aware.
“Thank you. I’m sorry for not helping you when you needed it, and not giving you a chance in first year.”
Exactly six years after their first kiss, Wardmaster Harry James Potter gets down on one knee.
“Of course I’m mad! I’m furious at myself! I was so inconsiderate, so busy having fun, I’m a horrible friend.” She pauses and lets out a sad laugh. “I’d like to say I’m surprised, of course, but it makes an odd sort of sense.” Squinting at the expression he must be displaying, she continues, “Oh, honestly! I didn’t speak at his trial because you were doing it, we’ve talked about this!”
Prompt for this chapter:
There was no way he’d stop for a chat with any of them without wanting to blow up the entire department.
”) Hermione often ranted, at length, about the tiny mentions of Harry’s mental health in every copy. It was almost like fifth year. They portrayed him as a complete nutter and the public ate it all up.
“It’s the Compass,” Harry announced as he joined Draco outside with his luggage, Noodle hiding in his sleeve. He’d stayed up most of the night studying the mirror, knowing that he shouldn’t do this alone, but unwilling to bother Draco. Slytherin had helped a lot more once Harry had shown him the mirror instead of describing it.
, you two.”
The fire engulfed his mother.
“What?!” Malfoy blanched, regaining his gauntness, eyes bulging. “I can’t! I have to go back today!”
“It's because you're a freak of nature! YOU shouldn’t be able to do anything. You get everything, why don’t you leave it for someone else!?” Harian was the next to stand up.
“We're done Granger. I should have listened to that hold hat when it begged to put me in Slytherin. At least there people know how to hold their tongues.” Haris wings folded back into her back, the rainbow swirls staying black, signifying her rage. She turned slightly and looked at Ron.
“I have to go, Pansy is holding my seat. Please stay safe.” A small kiss was placed on Harian’s head, and Draco was gone. Soon Krum was tumbling back in. It was Harian‘s turn next.
“Daddys boy.”
“Your dads should be here soon.” Draco said. “Speak of the devil.” Harian pried herself from Draco to get up and hug Remus and Sirius. Stumbling, though walking as best as she could, she made it to the mated pair.
“I demand Veritaserum!” He yelled. Harians arm burned.
“I will contact the MInistry.” Moody said, heading to the fireplace.
“Ehem..?” They heard from their little name calling session. Harian looked up to see Professor Mcgonagall and Snape both standing there. She went to pull away, but Draco held her close.
“For the final task, you shall venture to the maze to reach the Triwizard Cup! First person to reach it will be declared the winner. Starting with our Drumstang student, Viktor Krum!” Viktor ran into the maze. After a minute Harian’s name was called next.
Harian couldn’t believe Hermione thought it was a big deal. It was actually the truth. Yes, she and Draco had been secretly friends since second year, where they bonded on being excluded from everyone. Most people thought that they had only become friends this year.
“It’s not necessarily bonding. She has claimed you as her own, and other dragons know not to attack you. We are both her children. I am Stir. You are?” Harian gave a large smile, grabbing the hand he held out.
“Shampoo? I use conditioner once a week.” They arrived at the great hall. It was full of students, but not a teacher in sight. She saw Cedric smirk and raised her eyebrows.
“Alright!” Harian swallowed the Gillyweed. “Everyone at the ready! One, Two,” Suddenly it hurt to breath. “Three! Begin!” Harian jumped in, flipper feet swatting water away. She could actually breath underwater. This was so cool! She swam around till she found her first Mer-Person. He held out his spear and Harian held her hands up.
“Coming mum!” They all yelled from somewhere in the large manner. Draco chuckled as he put an angry Cedric in the chair.
“Good night sweetie.” Hari went to bed that night with a rare smile.
“You look handsome.” Harian said quietly. Draco gave her a soft smile, raising her soft hand to his chapped lips. Draco
“Krum! Catch!” Harian was tossed to Krum.
“Not today Harian. For the rest of the day, you and Fluer are gonna be treated like Princesses.” Harian and Fleur looked at each other and shrugged. Soon, the two older boys were running, the two girls screaming.
“Professor? I need help.” She asked when he opened his door. Snape sighed and invited her in.
“Yea right! Both of you are always latching onto me. You would be dead without me!” Harian through her hands up in aggravation.
“Not acceptable! We must do it now. You are her magical Guardian, are you not?” Karkaroff exclaimed. Dumbledore just shook his head.
“Oh my god you didn’t put your name in the goblet.” Harian gave him a dumb look.
He asked me questions at first. About other bosses, about locations and gangs and who the real players are. I answered as quietly as he asked. I told him who to watch out for, and how to deal with the other bosses most effectively. He knows I’ll follow his lead. Now he doesn’t ask anything at all, except meaningless little questions that make no sense. How do I recognize Chopin? Because I played piano for nine years. Why do I recognize passages from Voltaire’s Candide? Because I fucking well read the blasted thing. The satire aimed at the fatuous and self congratulatory nature of eighteenth century pseudo-intellectuals was brilliant, but that shit has NO RELEVANCE TO MY LIFE NOW!
Draco stood up calmly, looked at Harry with unexpected warmth, as if searching Harry’s mind for something only Draco could sense. Then the mask dropped back into place, and Draco lifted his chin and drawled a simple command while holding his own jutting erection out toward Harry.
Big Chicago part 16...by Samayel
“Oh. You know what? I’m starting to catch a little of that English spirit. Bugger the diet. I’ll have a small brandy after all. I think I need it.”
“Well. Oops. Martinis, right? Too many martinis. Didn’t happen. No one saw it. Heh. Could’ve happened to anyone. Right? Now where the bloody, buggery hell am I? And why are you even here? What in the blazes am I doing in last night’s clothes on the floor of…of…Sweet Merlin! Do you live in this dump, Potter?”
“Right. I…I should just go. See you at the office sometime, Potter.”
“Stop your woolgathering and stuff the recriminations, Harry! You’re not going anywhere until you’ve settled down and had some time to think clearly about this…and that’s an order!”
I put up a look of completely feigned innocence and concern. “Oh! I hadn’t thought of that! Whatever shall we do?”
“Pants up and take a seat. It can be dealt with. It isn’t that deep or that serious. You said this was done with heated wire. It’s surface level only. We can do this today. It’ll take a little time, and we can deal with this right here, but I can say with certainty that, in a few weeks, it will be like it never existed. There may be a…what?”
Either way, he’d know by tomorrow night. Draco may have been a little uncomfortable with the notion of surrendering himself completely to another person, allowing them total control over him, but this wasn’t just another person, this was Harry! There was no way he’d miss their rendezvous. Not for gold or glory. He loved Harry, and he knew it more absolutely than ever before. Whatever it took, his new full time job was making his gorgeous, green-eyed boyfriend happy, and that was all there was to it.
Like a junkie, willing to do anything for his next score, Harry had allowed Malfoy to maneuver every meeting between them in a direction that best suited the callow blond. It all led to this…this weird, exquisite shame. Mingled lust and a burning sense of humiliation.
Harry braved another question. “I don’t even understand what happened. Really. Why did you…react that way when I…spoke Parseltongue?” Left unspoken was the way he had used Parseltongue, nearly coercing a scarcely conscious Draco into complete submission.
Hermione sighed. “I’m glad I was wrong about Draco. I know he wants you to be happy, and I know he’d put himself through nearly anything to do it, too. Seeing you…like this…I know it’s right. You deserve to be happy, Harry. We would never want to take that away from you.”
I have just enough money left for one good night at a club. Nothing too much, just a chance to have a couple of drinks, make some men drool, and dance until I feel better. Dance is primal, and along with the voice, the creation of the drum, and cave-painting, it was one of the earliest forms of human artistic expression. From the moment we leave behind our mother’s heartbeat above us, and venture out into the world, we search for rhythm. Of course, some of us search in vain, and find polka or Lawrence Welk. I don’t think I could have survived the era when such things were considered the height of ’cool’. I still suspect that Hell is an elevator, where the greatest hits of Lawrence Welk are played through eternity…as Muzak. That notion still makes me shiver. Still, all I want tonight is to forget that Harry is gone for a little while, and to remember that I can break hearts easily when I want to.
Other lives are in my hands. If I screw this up, they all die, not just me. Anybody with Blaise that night is at risk of losing their life if they hurt me, and none of them even know it. I remember Vinnie and Greg. They were Blaise’s best friends from school. They lived the high life because they stuck by him and earned their place. Not exactly original thinkers, but nice enough guys in their own way. They were always nice to me when I was with Blaise, and the idea of them dying just because I got caught doing this is a lot more unsettling than I like.
I think of food a lot. I didn’t always, but it’s funny what starvation will do to your perceptions. I was very picky when I was a little kid. Turned my nose up at everything. Ever starved? Not fasted…starved. Like when you go over a week with no food, and you drink from fountains ‘til you feel full just to make your stomach feel better. I did. I didn’t hit the streets here and say to myself, ’Hey, I’m a little peckish…I’ll suck some dick, get paid for it, and then go get dinner.’ When things hit rock bottom, and people had figured out that I was dirt poor and of no value to them, I starved for eight days before my morals were compromised. Not that I had a lot of morals, but one of them was ‘Thou Shalt Not Fuck The Ugly…Even For Money.’ That moral died a hard death, but eventually I got some money and figured out where to get some food on the cheap. Ever since then I’ve cherished food.
“Our subject of interest is Potter…the very cream of Gryffindor’s crop. Imagine the coup available to us, if we just find the right way to pull him into some web of our design? Is that enough, my dear…enough to whet your appetite?”
It still made his head spin, even more than half a year since their first kiss. Draco’s hands were fumbling with his shirt buttons, even while their lips mingled and their tongues searched hungrily. It was easy, at a moment like this, to forget that there had ever been a cross moment between them.
“We’ll see about that, won’t we? Until then, I’m asking this of you, as a teacher, and as a mate. Give the boy the benefit of the doubt. Not for Draco, not for me, but for him. He’s his own person, and he deserves the same chance Dumbledore would have given any of us. Try being decent to him and see how that works, or if you can’t do anything else, at least try to keep that look off your face when you see him. You make me think of Snape and me twenty years ago. It isn’t right and you know it.”
Draco hadn’t had nearly so bad a time of it in Slytherin, although the gossip shifted from calling him impotent to calling him insane. Crabbe and Goyle were in his back pocket, and Zabini and Nott were in Harry’s, and with the entire contingent of seventh year Slytherin boys firmly on his side, no one dared to utter so much as a harsh word about his occasionally bringing Harry into the Slytherin common room for study time.
Draco had made his peace with wanting Potter over the summer, and, being no one's fool, he knew Potter wanted him. The stubborn, arse-stupid, bespectacled prat just wouldn't cave and admit it. Drastic measures were called for!
"Oh…oh, damn. Let me get you another cup of tea!"
He was expelled and sent home in disgrace. They couldn’t prove it was me, or even properly identify the spell because I’d mangled it so badly. Too many people had seen him in the hallway, with me screaming and trying to crawl away from him. It was the kind of incident that they dread there, but even if they suspected, and I don’t think they did, they couldn’t prove that I was behind it. They did blame me, though. The older students, the faculty, and others.
If it hadn’t been for the depth of Harry’s voice, the noises would have been similar to the ones made by girls he’d heard from a distance. Draco may have been a virgin, but he was neither deaf nor blind to what had been going on all around him since his fourth year at Hogwarts. In fact, he’d once stumbled upon Millicent Bullstrode in the more-than-friendly embrace of a seventh year Ravenclaw, and the pitch of her voice had been remarkably akin to Harry’s. Thank goodness he was in a situation that guaranteed his excitement, or that mental comparison might well have spoiled the mood!
He wanted soft kisses on his shoulders, and teeth that nipped at his neck and throat, and soft hands that caressed with hidden promises of more in every touch. Most of all, he wanted to be held in the afterglow of a savage and perfect shag, sated and dreamy for just a few minutes again.
It isn’t yet six o’clock in the morning, and my head has been whirring all night. He’s always awake before me, but I woke early today. He’s had to push and prod to keep me moving this week, but today I have a motivation that is even stronger than any mere responsibility. Harry deserves a special day, as special as the one he gave me, and that’s what he will have.
-----------------------------------------------
Books. Row after row of books. Not crappy ones either. The man has taste. How can a man who has practically everything ever written by W.B. Yeats be a homicidal goon? The comedies of Moliere. The complete works of Edgar Allen Poe. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Mark Twain. Ugh…Charles Dickens…I never did see the appeal. The man had all the subtlety of a freight train. Hobbes, Voltaire, Rimbaud, Jean Genet, Andre Gide, Rousseau, Wittgenstein, Jung, Freud, and more. On and on. Harry Black is clearly a very literate man.
“Good afternoon, sir. So very good to speak to you in person at last. Yes…I understand your concern. I think we all want what’s best for Chicago, and I can certainly take steps to move things forward…assuming, of course, that this is something you’d like?
The cheap, shitty makeup must have run when I was crying. I must look like shit. I don’t want to do this. I never want to, but now more than ever. I’m sick and shaky and I want to pee so bad I can almost taste it, but I don’t fucking dare offend him. There are people in cells across the hall. Bars give no privacy. I’m used to it. Word is already spreading. This man runs this block now, and if he could break Flint and three other men besides, no one wants to piss him off. They’ll stay quiet while he fucks me and pay respect to him when he’s done. I have to go through with this. Flint is gone, and this is the new boss. I have to get it together enough to give him what he wants, or I’ll be something he throws to the dogs like leftover scraps.
Dora nipped at her mocha with a mild smirk while Remus tried to focus his concentration for a second.
Hermione fidgeted nervously. “Umm…yeah…about those…you see…”
Following the graceful lines of Draco’s neck down the greyhound slender athleticism of his back, Harry ultimately found himself staring in awe at Draco’s arse. The word arse didn’t seem right. Neither did bum or seat or can. Everything he had ever heard in locker rooms fell short of honoring that magnificent sight.
Between them, they devoured the tray of food in relative silence, only a few comments interrupting their meal. Draco laid back contently, rubbing his stomach, which had distended slightly from gorging himself, until he pulled his sheet up a bit self consciously. Harry chuckled and Draco bristled a little.
This regular association also included a blessed and welcome measure of time to shamelessly monopolize the attention of Hermione Granger-Weasley, burning through discussions on esoteric tracts concerning the nature of magic, its origins and limitations, and its as yet undiscovered potential uses. Before the holidays had passed, Draco had already realized that his ultimate desire was to pursue research and become a scholar in the magical world, and his pedigree as a research wizard would be starting with an apprenticeship beside the witch whose work he admired most.
Draco looked indignant for a moment, not liking the implication that he could be hurt, but there was no hiding his condition the last few days. Draco’s frown slid away slowly, replaced by an expression that hinted at deep thought. After a pregnant pause in their conversation, he surprised Harry pleasantly. “I’m glad you came.”
Luna’s elderly house-elf popped up with an ice cold Butterbeer for Harry, who took it gratefully. Luna slid into position on the couch, pulling Harry into place so that she could rub his shoulders. She knew he was a tense person in general, and she always seemed to enjoy unwinding him when he was too worked up, sometimes via sex, other times just like this. Harry sighed and melted, leaning back and enjoying the feel of Luna’s skin on his, soft breasts against his back, while the knots in his shoulders were rubbed away. She hadn’t done this for him in years.
He makes me breakfast, in spite of my naughty, wicked, deliberate habit of wearing his pajamas. If we hadn’t indulged ourselves so wildly last night and again twice this morning already, there’s no way he’d have managed to pay attention to making food. The amazing thing is that he’s quite good at it. He’s used to being served, and yet he can make a light breakfast quickly and easily. Coffee and juice and toast with exquisite preserves spread across it. Grapefruit and cantaloupe, eggs with diced green and red peppers and cheese. Slivers of ham and bacon.
How absurd that he should be so grateful for such a thing, something that should have been his rightful due, but then, there, all he’d cared about had been pleasing Draco.
He'd meant to say more, but just then Lily Potter poked her head in the door and whispered “Sorry...Cissy...we have to be in position. Hurry!!”
“Bloody hell, Harry! I got in at two…and you two were still having it off! Don’t tell me you bastards never heard of a Silence spell! I mean, Merlin’s Fucking Beard, mate…SIX HOURS?! What the fuck is wrong with you two? Can’t you do anything normal? If it takes that long to get off, you’re doing something wrong!”
Harry had been a perfect gentleman the entire time, making the peace between them cost a little, but not so much that it wouldn't be acceptable. They'd taken up seeing each other again after a month of hurled insults, and once that first nervous encounter ended without any vengeance on harry's part, Draco slowly began to let his guard down.
“Alright. I’ll give it my best. When do you want me to make my apologies? I haven’t anything ready yet, but I will…as soon as I have a moment I can spare to put some thought behind them.”
They found Ron asleep outside the door in the morning, curled up on a spare blanket from the commons, snoring loudly. When Harry stepped over him to head for the loo, Ron woke with a start, and promptly began to whine.
‘You. You we can hurt. No one will care. No one will punish us. No one will look for revenge.’
That brought him to his current meeting. Minerva was due to make a report to the Ministry soon, and wanted a complete review of Harry’s working relationship with his pupil before she made her report. While Harry intended to state as much as possible in Draco’s defense, there were thorny issues that were yet unresolved, and Harry knew it quite well.
“Anu Patil brags about hers. They have magical primary schools in India. Ditched the British laws as soon as they could. She said most of it is theory, but kids still get their wand early and she aced the First and Second Year tests. That’s why her mum raised her in Delhi and not here.”
(Image: A Yule log)
Draco watched and screamed.
Harry laughed and sat up, then straddled him. Circe, he was attractive, and that voice, rough from taking Draco so deep in his throat last night! Draco’s cock twitched. “Potter, you oaf, let me brush my teeth first!”
Draco sighed dramatically. “If they kill me, please bury me near the coast somewhere in Brittany.”
“Two hours. If they break the door again, I don’t even care, I’ll curse them all with boils.”
The sunroom on the first floor overlooked the pond on one side; Draco didn’t look. He had no wish to picture the bodies dumped in the murky water even if he didn’t doubt that the place had changed as well. He sat on the couch facing the opposite bay window and allowed himself a soft smile, chasing off the shadows of the Dark Lord. He’d always enjoyed the view of the hills. They were particularly charming this time of the year, covered in frost that glittered under the rare beams of sunlight.
“I wish to be added to the re-sorting list.” Sirius looked at her. What was wrong with Gryffindor.
“Gangorplo is a rare plant that allows you to talk to Mer-people. I need it for the task tomorrow.” Harian explained. Draco nodded.
“You look beautiful. Shall we?” He asked, holding out his arm. Harian nodded and grabbed it softly, making sure to look as elegant as possible.
“You look really pretty!” Chang said as she shook the veelas hand.
“Do you think I can use Gangorplo or Gillyweed? Or both?” The man nodded and went to a cupboard. Harian barely held back a wince. She hated her cupboard under the stairs. When Professor Snape turned around her handed her two things. One pink the other green.
As they walked down, Draco’s jaw dropped. She was stunning. He couldn’t believe how he had made her fall for him, but whatever he did he would do it over again.
“Dray their staring.” She leaned closer and he laughed.
“Eat the Gangorplo tonight. It lasts for a week afterwards. This, hold onto it. Take it when you're about to swim. It will activate then.” Harian nodded, giving her thanks to the cranky old man. She headed off to her dorm room to join Pansy and tell the girl her plan.
“What is your name?” Moody asked. He pointed his wand at the taller boy.
When they got to where the other competitors were standing, Harian gasped. Fluer was absolutely gorgeous. Her and Krum matched with a white suit and a pale pink dress. The sleeves reached her mid arm, and the back of the dress was cut low. Both sophisticated and appealing. Cho Chang, Cedric's date, had a floor length bright blue kimono. The white flowers being a great contrast to Ced’s black suit. The boys started talking and Harian went over to Fluer.
“You never did anything you weren’t supposed to. You didn’t know. It’s going to be okay. I know he was like a brother to you. I don’t know if you will ever forgive yourself, but no one blames you.” Draco held her close,wincing slightly as her body gave a weak shudder. Tears tracked down her face, blending in with snot all over Draco’s robes.
“And to think you even let that beast talk to you!” Harian’s back burned and anger filled the air.
“This is your fault! If you hadn’t put your name in the Goblet this wouldn’t have happened!”
“‘S alright Harian. See you later.” Harian gave a bow and walked out of the great hall wiping tears that threatened to fall. Her clothes were still ripped, showing the dragon scales that littered her back.
Harian cried for who knows how long. Right as she was about to leave, she saw two Drumstrang students walk in.
“We can. You are in our country, and didn’t follow our rules. Please follow me. Levi Corpus!” Soon Karkaroff was floating into the fireplace and the Crat brothers followed. Harian let out a sigh.
“DrayDray Malfoy.” Harian said with a giggle. She was once again pressed up against Draco’s face. A few cameras went off again. Harian turned around seeing Skeeter. She gave her a small smile, before burying her face back into Draco’s chest. She could feel Draco smirk into her head.
“Of course. I’ll see you on the first task.”
“You gave us all a freight. Apparently you took to long to come up, and when you did you had a stab wound.” He explained.
“Professor….Snape.” And Harian was out of it.
Harian looked at the potion’s professor with a shocked look. She gave him a dazzling smile, turning to Charlie and giving him a hug. She was two points above Krum! She was in first place! Though she hated the start of this tournament, she couldn’t deny the good competition. Soon She was carried off the field on top of Krum’s and Charlie’s shoulders. Laughing, she slid onto Charlies and let Fluer get on Krums. The two have always had  a major connection. Cedric walked in front of them, doing some peacock strut making all of them laugh.
“Alright, by you guys!” Harian said as she all but ran from the Gryffindor common room. She felt her eyes prickling with tears, and headed to the first empty classroom. Soon, the water works came.
“And why, Do you wish to be resorted?” Harian gave him a look.
“I’m sorry Ron, I don’t think I can stay friends with that
“Hey there princess.” Harian stuck her tongue out, trying to roll out of his grip. Cedric wasn’t having it. This girl just won the first round, she is gonna get to be a princess today.
“Scorpio! Elizabeth! Levita!” A pregnant Harian yelled. 15 years after the war they were doing them great. Their first born was starting Hogwarts soon, Eliziabeth was starting in two years, Levita in three. Their other son, Cedric, was three. Harian was currently seventh months pregnant with a healthy baby boy. His name was going to be Damian.
This was fine. They could be happy with this.
“Harian’s told us a lot about you.” Harian blushed and looked away. Draco chuckled and grabbed her hand, and all her worries went away. Yeah. This could work out just fine.
“Not today Princess.” Thankfully, they arrived at the castle and the boys had slowed down. Harian then started playing with the Hufflepuffs' hair.
Pansy’s dress was calf length, and a dark blue. On her neckline, a darker blue snake was sown into the dress for a pattern. It really brought out both of the girls' Slytherin sides.
“How could you! Bonding to a Dragon!” The older woman caired on. Harian’s back burned with anger. No one said those things about Strength.
“You scared me. I think you deserve a punishment.” Draco purred. Harian sputtered, turning around and hitting him lightly on the shoulder. Sticking her tongue out, Draco chuckled.
“Draco I can’t sit here.” She said, trying to pull her hand from his grip. He gave her a soft smile.
FLASHBACK HEHE
“Charlieeee!” The brunette yelled. The older weasley laughed and did a two finger salute, walking away to put the dragons away. Harian huffed, but found herself on top of Cedric.
“Why, are you holding Potter?” He gestured to the red faced girl. She looked down sheepishly. Draco shrugged.
her! She has had nightmares about this. Why do you still not believe her?”
“I declare Igor Karkaroff and Thomas Crat hereby sentenced to Azkaban, as well as Charlie Crat expelled. Please follow me to the Ministry of Magic.” Hari was never more thankful for Fudge.
“She almost got killed by Dragons. Can’t I hug the girl I love?” Harian let out a small “eep” and burried herself further into Dracos drobes.
“Charles Li Crat”
“Yes Professor?” The blonde asked, making sure they could see the Gryffindor’s blushing face.
“Why didn’t you tell me! I wouldn’t have invited them last summer!” Harian shrugged.
“I didn’t put my name in the Goblet!” Harian yelled. The adults came up from the Pensive, no one but Snape noticing.
“Now now boy! Let us see Harian here! Can’t keep her all to yourself.” Rita Skeeter said as she walked towards the two of them.
Harian sat up quickly, looking around her. Hospital wing. She breathed out a sigh of relief and sunk back into her warm hospital bed. Wait, why was it so hard? She turned around and noticed Draco holding her lossley. She flushed, gave herself a small smile, and placed a kiss on his lips. She moved as lightly as she could, but Draco caught her, holding her down to the bed.
” Harian used the same word Granger did when she described Strength.
“How ever long it takes him to answer. Maybe a day or two. He will want to be there.” They also had to give him a good enough disguise to go past Alastar.
“Do not talk about Strength like that!” Harian’s back was suddenly very heavy, and she turned around to see two reddish black wings supporting her. The only top she had on was her sports bra, making it uncomfortable on her wings. Harian took it off, feeling instant relief. Soon, a shirt, bra, and cloak were thrown at her with holes down the back. She looked over to see Charlie Weasly standing there. Harian blushed crimson and turned around. She brought her wings in and put all of the clothing items on. When she turned back around, Charlie was standing there with the same wings she had.
“How am I supposed to stay with her?” Charlie’s hand rubbed his chin.
They began studying hard for their DADA test that day, barely talking or looking up from their books. Soon Draco was called from the Library, and Harian went to find Professor Snape. Harian already knew what was going to be taken from her. Either Draco or her picture book of her mothers. Those were her two favorite things.
“I didn’t put my name in the Goblet Hermione!” Harian yelled. She was getting sick and tired of yet another argument with the other Gryffindor.
“Well,  I’m going to go to the Library.” Harian said. “Wanna join?” She then asked for the sake of things.
“That isn’t needed! We can just expel them!” His plea was in vain. Soon Moody left. Around five minutes later, the mad man came back with three Aurors and the Minister. Dumbledore stood.
“Young man. She isn’t yours.” She went to grab Harian but Draco swatted her hand away. Harian subconsciously snuggled closer, not noticing she did it. Unfortunately, Skeeter did. The older woman started cooing. If you could even call it that.
