Draco started work at a magi-vet clinic in Camden just after they moved, while Harry coached Little League Quidditch and taught flying lessons in Wales. Harry left each morning via floo, but Draco started taking Muggle transportation; he was fascinated by the mechanics of motor vehicles. They bought a car when Draco finished his final year of internship and became fully licensed as a magi-veterinarian—“A proper animal healer ought to travel in style,” Harry told him—and Draco delighted in driving his new olive-green Jaguar around the countryside. They spent innumerable weekends staying at inns wherever they ended up, which was frequently in the Fens. Draco loved the landscape there, wild and strange, and Harry loved exploring it with him.
After the war, they attended the same funerals, the same weddings, the same ceremonies and trials and unveilings. Potter was always surrounded. His friends guarded him like crups, keeping him away from the Ministry, the press, the public. Draco saw him through the crowds. They’d managed to spot each other across the room since they were eleven years old; time did nothing to change that.
“He’s not a git,” Harry’s quick to say, too quick. “Well, he is, yeah..but he has, you know...changed.”
“Yeah, right,” he mumbles to himself. Well, if he can’t think normally about Malfoy, he can at least act sane.
Harry comes out of the bathroom, still naked, and catches him trying to fix his hair. “I like your new look. You should keep it.”
Harry grinned. “Love you too, sweetheart.” He traipsed to their bedroom and once again silently thanked Draco for insisting on a ridiculously luxurious shower during their house hunting. One quick but very hot shower and a soft set of pajamas later, Harry made his way back to the sitting room and peered at the bubble in his husband’s lap.
It’s late, later than Ron and Harry have been out drinking in years. Harry knows Ron wants to go home to Hermione and the kids, but the very last thing he wants is to go home and rattle around Grimmauld Place.
A few days later, they got falafel from a muggle food cart near Harry’s house, then walked around to see the historical buildings in Islington. Draco talked about some of his favorite customers, and Harry asked how long he’d worked at the cafe. Draco, hackles up, tersely said, “A little over a year,” and didn’t elaborate.
"Ur?" Harry jerked back in his perch on the edge of an armchair, eyeing the velveteen clad box and Draco both with great wariness. "Uh, huh? Fingers? What about them? And—and what's this?"
“Oh…kay, mate,” Ron started, and then caught up to Harry’s heels. “Whatever. Your bloody choice, yeah?”
“Oh fuck,” Harry groaned, barely under his breath. “Merlin fuck.” He twisted his fingers together all the more, and harder, setting his teeth in a physical barrier against the stupid words. He could throw off Imperius, couldn’t he? So one half-arsed Veritus from a kid who probably didn’t even know his shaving charms yet shouldn’t be a problem--should it?
the voice demanded, after a telling pause. Harry detected a distinct sob at the end of it, tacked on like punctuation
Only his own Mum could expect to take such liberties with Draco's private affairs, he supposed. He sniffed, a flick of his wand refilling his cup; truly, it was not at all unexpected, his Mum's taking an interest. For it wasn't as though Draco descended upon her private parlour and demanded of her meaningful Malfoy heirlooms every single day, was it?
What had been annoying, once, was now lovely—startlingly so. Strange what a daily application of come-and-kisses could do to alter a bloke’s perspective, wasn’t it?
Harry would’ve liked to command Draco that; he didn’t. He knew Draco had to go; must go—must. That there was good reason to go and that it was all very prudent-cum-wise-cum-Slytherin and that he’d be a fool-and-worse-than-that if he should stay too long on a school day morning. So Harry didn’t say it aloud, exactly…well, maybe he whispered the word ‘stay’ but only under his breath. Very much so; he hardly heard himself, he was so discreet about it.
“Hars, I am afraid it’s not going to come much clearer than this,” Millicent remarked, gathering up the most official--and thus most spiffing--set of rune stones the Department of Mysteries had available and dumping them unceremoniously back into their velvet sack. “Ansuz, Raidho, yes, all that’s here and clearly visible--”
“Suffering Salazar, Draco!” Harry fell back, defeated. He sighed and it was an enormous one, which gusted out, blowing Malfoy’s trademark fringe right off his pale forehead. “You are
"Yes!" Draco growled. "That's what I've been trying to tell you, Potter. For you—all for you—and I didn't spare a Galleon to make it right and proper, either, so make sure to appreciate it, will you? I'd the very devil of a time, Harry, managing this and in such a short time—"
“Bye, Luna. Piss off, Bulstrode.” Harry frowned meaningfully. “Your happy home life is waiting on you, doubtless. Bring me back a curry, please? For the love of Merlin.”  He indicated his belly beneath the folds of his work robes, which obligingly rumbled. “Eel tartlets this morning, you know? I’m famished.”
Draco had been left sitting there at his own dinner table, rigid with shame and humiliation, surrounded by hostile Gryffindor forces and his own snickering lot of ex-Slytherins, with egg on his face and an hysterical Ravenclaw swot weeping into the linens!
His Mum smiled at him, clapping her hands to summon Twimbly. He popped in, was given his instructions swiftly and reappeared bearing gifts before Draco had even fully digested the idea that one day his shitefully poor excuse for a pater might actually approve of him.
Nev yelped and rescued his tilting teacup from the middle of his porridge, glaring his indignation across the intervening space.
Ron. Don't even start. And you!" Her eyes swiveled to Draco. "And you didn't go after him? At once? You just let him pop off like that and did nothing about it? What
Meanings – journey (physical or spiritually), seeing the bigger picture, change, reunions, travel, represents the wagon wheel"
. I was more than provoked—and don't you dare tell me what I can and can't do, Draco Malfoy. Just leave now, like I keep asking you to. Go away. Get out, you!" Harry snapped his teeth like a mad dog when Draco pressed closer.
He looked carefully at his friend, an odd pang twinging in his chest when he was met with an inexplicable small silence on his mate's end. It was, he realized unhappily, more than a tad hurtful, the idea that Harry might not particularly relish sharing quarters again with his old uni roommate. But he'd certainly never, ever indicated anything of the sort...had he?
“You have, have you?” Draco drawled, sitting back again and crossing his arms across his chest. He sniffed. They’d played this same scene out numerous times since they’d moved into the flat. “That’s bleeding hilarious, Potter. You weren’t even home two hours ago, when I left a floo message at your office asking you to let me know whether I should pick up food and Millicent said you were deep in it and she’d not heard a peep out of you since luncheon. How would you ever had time to make supper, here at home? You were at work.”
The books shivered in their cases, spines shimmering like watercolours running in a rain squall, such was the magic. It produced an odd effect, almost instantaneously. It was much like being a puppet: a giant invisible hand plucked each of them sideways, shoved them hither, yanked them yon and rearranged them, abruptly. Draco spun catty-corner and came to a floating halt just off Harry's left hip; Harry's legs stopped their swimmy flailing as he rose and were wrenched gently apart. He flapped his hands; he flailed. He shrieked through his nose.
“He's returned, dear. A month ago, is it?" His mother tapped an elegant forefinger against an equally elegant dimple.  "Something like that."
"Now, look here—" Hermione was at him again in that no-nonsense way of hers, rapidly scanning page after page all the while. "You're not helping your own cause, not by simply brooding over it. That's not your best choice, period. You need to get off your sorry arse and be proactive. Talk to him. Track him down and let him know you're interested, alright? Malfoy's not an idiot; he might see a decided advantage for himself, taking up with you. Give it a whirl, why don't you? You've nothing to lose but your miserable attitude."
“Difficult,” Harry laughed softly. “You are difficult and annoying. Must it always be answering a question with a question, with you?”
He lifted a shoulder; it felt impossibly heavy, like the rest of him. Too heavy to breathe, to eat, to sleep. To care.
"The fifth of June, Mister Malfoy," Madam Pinkstone smiled, "first thing, in the morning post. Yes, I've got that. And you'll be requiring the other special orders all at once, and those delivered all to be delivered to Hogwarts as well, yes, but on the morning of the fifth?"
“Malfoy? You alright?” Harry looked up from his impressively cluttered desk with a startled glance. “Come on through, will you? Tea? You look horrid.”
Draco aimed for a casual chuckle to go along with his one-shoulder shrug. It seemed as though he succeeded, too, as Potter's expression immediately lightened. Diversion, that was the key. Potter's posh office was not the appropriate place to discuss such trivial, personal, unbearably
“Eihwaz, Harry,” Millie announced cheerily, trotting back into his office with the promised bacon butty and a very welcome coffee. Floating behind was another teetering stack of correspondence, however. “It’s all Eihwaz, today.”
“Erm." Harry raised his eyebrows so far up they practically disappeared beneath his flopping-forward, entirely too perverse fringe, the silvery lightning-bolt wrinkling in clear confusion. "Yes? I did--I am?”
Long hot fingers wrapped ‘round his cock, pulling fiercely; a mouth full of steaming tongue stilled Harry’s own. He thrashed—and loved it, hips knocking into his lover’s and likely bruising. Ron would have fits tomorrow—but then, he always did.
Harry caught his breath sharply; a panging thrill ran straight from brain stem to cock. His bollocks gathered tight, suddenly full and ripe in Pavlovian response to the word 'lube'.
: They have much to teach one another, Potter and Malfoy, and particularly about sharing. Thank Merlin for the existence of re-dos and sandwiches.
As a group, they'd done all the usual board games and card games, stripping and snogging games, dares and 'Spins the's' and charades. They'd hosted a dance marathon, staged both a burlesque and a talent show; had tried choral singing and even karaoke. Four of them had been rock stars and the rest groupies; they'd their own Quidditch team. Acres of butterbeer empties and killed-dead-in-the-water Firewhisky bottles had littered the Common Room floor during the preparations, activities, and aftermaths of these activities, and every single one of them had by now managed to shag every other one, including the antipathetic youths Weasley and Malfoy, much to their mutual discomfort. The Eights were—in two short words—terminally bored. With lessons, the threat of NEWTS, career choices, the Hogwart's dining room menu, boarding school life in general—and even each other. Which is not to say some odd pairings hadn't shown up over the months of enforced closeness, rising like scum to the surface of the mutual pool.
Still and all, Draco couldn't help but be secretly pleased by his lover's mate's reactions. It was his arse on show, and it was Potter who was shagging it. Could've been a bit humiliating if it weren't that Harry's mates were so clearly bowled over. By which he meant impressed. As they were, absolutely.
Harry, already in the act of stumbling and struggling to get his feet under him so he could sit up and face Malfoy like a man rather than a heap, managed to take the corner of it right to his unguarded temple. He fell back again on the plaid beneath him with a loud flop, feeling horribly dazed.
"I mean, you're such a sucker if you think someone admires you, Draco—so easily persuaded, so flattered. Your ego's got to be size of Greater London, you know? So we fucked, alright—we fucked and got the Merlin-damned flat just make it easier to fuck. And…and that's it—that's all it ever was. Convenience. And now it's over; I'm done." Harry tapped a toe silently on the plush pile. "It's
…Of course, none of Draco's good intentions nor well-meaning, honourable tenets regarding Courtship would prevent him from possibly AKing Harry himself, right this instant, or so he concluded, staring down upon the slight form of the bloody ridiculous Golden One.
The third Saturday in May was bright, calm and clear, the only haze lying purple and peaceful on the mountains hovering in the distance. Up close, everything—every leaf, every late-blooming Highlands blossom—was sharply in focus and newly minted. It was mild, and Draco and Harry hadn't bothered to wear their robes, though Draco had worn one of his beloved jerseys, being a bit thin-skinned and not wanting to bother with warming charms should he feel chilled.
He sneered and swallowed hard, his throat working, and allowed himself the faint relief of pinching his sinuses, to relieve the pounding pressure.
Draco hesitated uncertainly, eyes widening as he took in the heaps and stacks of Owls and envelops, scrolls, texts, rocks and whatnot not only on the desk itself but also stacked haphazardly to either side of it.
"Um, neither's mine, really." Harry stared intently at the coffee shop's posters: lovely verdant images of Costa Rica, sunny climes. It was frigid in London and the sky was lowering with unshed snow. "Just a little…something."
Draco, having bagged Harry Potter, was damned proud of it, but the Brown bint was a slag and a baggage and Draco was fuming. Pacing and fuming and reviewing his favoured hexes.
Next time, he vowed to himself, and Summoned more lube with the charm every Wizarding teen learnt at puberty.
“Maybe you do, maybe you don’t.” Pansy shrugged, her eyes sparkling, “but someone had to say it, Draco, and Hermione’s not volunteering to do the dirty work. She's already done her part, listening to Harry drone on and on about your stupid houses and waffling over what’s best for you and whether you’d prefer this or want that or t'other. As if we all didn't already know you’re fucking lonely as hell, completely adore the prat and are practically panting after a family of your own to dote over! Now, be off with you. I have two sugar-high, mother-in-law-spoilt-silly toddlers coming home to me in a moment. I'll need all the mental energy I can summon!”
It was rather nice, being tucked so firmly under Malfoy’s expensively capacious wing. Rather fitting, too, considering how difficult a time he’d been dished out, all those many years prior, taunted ruthlessly for all the things he knew not. Malfoy was definitely making up for it now.
“No. I’m serious.” He rolled his eyes back in his head and regarded their ceiling with a pout, thumping his back against the cushions. “Really, Draco; listen. Tell me, what does the Ministry have against a proper weekend? I don't think I’ve had even a spare hour to myself since I got called back from Osl--ergh! Um, my last foreign assignment, I meant. You didn't hear me say Oslo, Malfoy. Because, you know, if you had--”
Something snapped inside Draco's brain. Maybe it was the last remnant of the hold Voldemort had tried to place upon his young heart, or perhaps it was the silent shattering of a million idiotic misconceptions; who knew?
Draco, like the Spider, laid in wait quietly, a curious creature who was subtle and mostly beneficial. Like the Condor, he sailed high in his precious skies, telling over the shapes of the constellations, deriving their meaning, their movements. As with the Tree and the Flower, he--as well as Harry and his mates--had bloomed and come far more into his own being as a person in the safe creche that was uni. They had all not so much ‘redeemed’ themselves, Harry believed, but had simply grown older and wiser and deeper through their experiences there, with their new knowledge freely shared between them and the always-present reliance upon each other.
“Sound nice, Potter? And you can stay over at the Manor, of course, till then. That’s a given. Mum’ll love having you to fuss over. We can have Aunty Drom to visit and Teddy, too,
"Erm," Harry wrenched his arms out from where they'd been trapped by Draco's sharp elbows. Very carefully he laid a palm on either side of Draco's bobbing head, his fingertips entangling with the silky strands that tufted out between them. The git was nipping at him with every other word. It stung but also felt contrarily marvellous—and his cock was so hard he was dizzy with it—as was Draco's—but this absolutely had to be cleared up first.
Weasley were loitering conspicuously in the Hogwart's entryway, glowering and brandishing wand tips furtively under cover of their robes as they paced. But they
“No, no, Potter, steady on,” Draco growled, catching Harry by his shoulders and bodily turning the smaller man so that he was facing the archway leading out to the Main Grand Staircase. “This way. It’s nothing Dark, I promise you--and it’s not down here. It’s up there, and it's out of control now.”
"Pah!" Weasley sputtered, his hands clenching into fists. "Bosh! How you can find it in you to think any part of
“Yes,” Harry replied flatly, his lips tightening. “I’ve noticed, and no, not just this morning, either. And what of it? Ron’s being a great tit and you were, too, Hermione, just now, and I don’t see why you both have to act as though it were some burning
—had been lost, and Slytherin House no longer being perceived as a bloody pariah, or its returning occupants either, Draco could confess his admiration freely…when they’d become better acquainted, of course. Potter had set the tone for it and all the Houses had fallen into line, like so many ninepins.
“Pish tosh, Potter!” she scoffed, having neatly polished half of her butty in the time it took Harry to chew his first bite and hastily swallow. “Don’t have all day, you know? Things to do, people to intimidate, darling. Must rush, so do spill.”
aware Hagrid's actually planning to administer us a written test tomorrow? He let it slip at luncheon! He practically never does that!"
"I, ah, was wondering, Mum," he faltered, for this was difficult and possibly tricky, especially if Mum was feeling her oats. Mum had no compunction over teasing her beloved son if she felt he deserved it. It was that damned Black blood, finally outing itself. Aunt Andromeda had that self-same horrid sense of sly humour; he's caught her and Mum giggling like schoolgirls more than once, now that Father was banished! "If perhaps you knew where Father had cached Grandme're's personal effects? Because I find myself in need of a significant piece of jewelry; family jewelry, Mum—and clearly, it seems that I should be the one asking him, being the, er, suitor, so a Malfoy engagement ring would be the best place to start—"
Draco grinned. Slyly, goofily—like the veriest ninny. Instead of answering, he scooted his plain brown study carrel chair over so abruptly that Harry was practically tipped arse over teakettle into his waiting lap, so closely were they aligned down the one side. Harry allowed it, naturally, as the Library was deathly quiet—no Hufflegiggles in sight. Merlin, he even let go of all the residual tension that had lingered long along the line of his shoulders, tucking himself neatly by Draco's ribcage with a tiny sigh.
It had been only hours—eight, to his count—since he'd wanked off in the shower, knowing full well he was spending the day at Potter's side, in the company of the enemy, and therefore couldn't afford to be caught out with a stiffie. His precautions apparently made no sodding difference; he could've pulled off ten times in succession and Harry would still make him harder than the famed White Cliffs of Dover just by breathing. Draco plunged and pulled, rocked and twisted, with Potter joining in eagerly as he got used to it, finally ending up urging Draco on at every turn, and it didn't take long at all before he felt that so-familiar pressure in his gut.
pretty swell! Draco admitted, with a silly grin plastered all over his face. He’d have to remember to try that last amazing move, too, for next Slytherin practice. Fucking impressive! Science! The prat sure knew his shite!
"It's love, alright." He didn't have much experience with the emotion, but nothing else could possibly twist him up like this—no one else alive in the world could induce this sheer panicky feeling that filled him now. Only Draco. Always Draco. "Really, it is."
“Right; you asked. One,” Hermione grinned. She raised a slim hand and began to tick off items in a business-like fashion. “You both possess and dwell in quite elderly Wizarding homes of substance. Wizarding homes which are especially accustomed to housing fairly large families, judging by the sheer mass of them. Two, you’re both absolutely brilliant with children, all ages, and you know it.” She gave them both very stern looks, taking her time about it. “You both adore Teddy. And Rosie, and Pansy’s two, and Bill and Fleur’s, and--tell me, need I go on? No? No, I didn’t think so. Perfect candidates.”
"Huh." Harry humped a careless shoulder. "What can I say?" he asked, bleakly. "You're very fit and I—"
Harry clamped his traitorous mouth into a thin anxious line without a second thought. Here it came, he was certain—the death knell.
The Great Hall at Hogwarts had never looked like this! Draped in bunting, flowers and streamers; scented with roses and the rare Siberian orchids, and filled with the strains of a hundred stringed instruments and one Magicked Muggle tuba (Mother's idea, for emphasis, she'd claimed, as was the brass section and the lone French cornet), it was a fairytale setting for a Betrothal Ceremony like none had ever witnessed. Father would be proud of him, Draco was certain, as he settled his lapels and took up his place just outside the doors. Harry would be simply bowled over.
A second stretched endlessly. Then another. Harry scowled, every muscle tensed to peel out and over if necessary. But...
"No, please," Draco went on—at last, at last, and sincerely-and maybe there was a bit of sob underlying his words now, as they poured out. His fingernails were back to digging into the upholstery and quite possibly puncturing holes right through the cream brocade. "I can't do this any longer, coming home to the flat without you in it. I'm not eating, not sleeping, not fucking caring—barely going to work, alright? For gods sake, I'm bloody well
"The Shack?" Draco shrieked, his voice rising. "The Shrieking Shack? I'm not setting foot in that horrible place, Potter! You must be off your fucking nut!"
"Right," Harry chuckled softly; he'd almost all Draco's knotted frogs unclasped and Draco shivered a bit as the cooler evening air wafted against his sensitive nipples. "Don't think so. Mmmm, you taste so good, luv," he added, squirming 'round in Draco's lap to latch on to one perked pink nub and nipping it lightly. He sucked at bit harder and Draco shuddered happily, arching his spine with a groan. "I've missed you. All day, I've missed you."
“Meh.” Harry shrugged off Draco’s remarks. “It’ll do for the moment, which is what’s important.  Shagging is happening at Grimmauld, much to its delight, presumably. I can think up something better later. Oh, ah! Um? When is ‘later’, anyway?" Tilting his head like some demented canary, Harry blinked curiously at Draco. "How long, do you think, before we can move back to our respective homes? Hermione was saying she thought at least six months, maybe longer.” He sighed glumly, waving a hand. “P’raps even nine.”
wanted to give was something of his own—his family's—to make it known that he and Potter were now—most definitely—
Harry nodded frantically, blushing scarlet in the dark. He could literally feel Draco staring holes into him, grey eyes like searchlights illuminating his likely gormless expression, his betraying colour, his utter lack of self-protection. He shut his eyes tight for a moment, staving off the cool composed invasion of that gaze, only to blink them open to a visual feast: the swathe of pale hair, pale skin, pale everything that was imminently poised for flight.
"Right, first thing," Draco remarked airily, ignoring Harry's question entirely and busily gathering the rest of their scattered notes into a semi-neat stack. "Here we are, then, all on our own. In the Library." He casually unbuttoned his robes and collar buttons with one elegant hand. "The deserted Library. With a clean worktable available and lots of nice thick carpeting to muffle all sound. No Librarian about to consult with, no other students to pop over and gawp at us and—secondly—note the time. Well past curfew, isn't it? Hmm," he purred, and somehow—impossibly, it seemed—eased his length to slink alongside Harry's rapt but puzzled person. "And—thirdly
"No, really," Harry smirked, flapping a hand at him as if he were shooing a fly. "You stink. And I mean it. So. Leave me alone."
Harry--who might not be Harry but instead that insufferable jokester Zabini--jumped up and made as if to approach Draco. Draco found himself retreating, backwards, and jabbing an accusatory finger at the arse-end who’d clearly got hold of one of Harry’s hairs and was impersonating him.
…It was much later Draco explained it all, as he understood it, at least. His Grandme're's ring, the spell upon it, what it meant and what he wanted of Harry in exchange for it.
“Um. I’ve a bit of free time coming up; likely, I can find it in me to provide a little spot of community service. Bring the Wizarding Wonder Boy up to speed on his cultural heritage; escort you ‘round, show you things. Do the world a service, more like, so you’re not so hopelessly gormless, Gryffling.”
“Mm-hmm, yes, please,” Harry said happily, the skin around his striking eyes crinkling up. He darted forward, pulling Draco into yet another quick one-armed hug before leaving go and turning toward the hearth. “Red, dryish, and don’t break the vault on it--I like it cheap and plentiful, same as the old days. Don't waste your decent cellar stuff on me, please. In fact, stop by that Tesco's on the way over tonight and pick up a couple bin ends, won’t you? We’ll likely need them both. Yes, definitely, once you see for yourself what’s been happening with Grimmauld.”
"Really, Potter," Malfoy sneered. "You're laying about like a bleeding gecko on a rug—swotting, alright, I hear you. But—tell me this, then. How can you possibly manage to injure yourself simply doing nothing worthwhile? You're just there and you take a book corner to the temple, Potter? Come on! Pathetic! That makes three times I've seen you harm yourself since breakfast. Are you damaged or what? Mental, maybe? You must be—you're pretty damned clueless, if I do say so myself."
"Oooooh, Draco!" his heart-mate growled, trailing sloppy kisses across Draco's disappeared part and all through his marvelously mussed tendrils of curling fairer-than-fair hair. "Oh, my love, you're so—so—beau—Ahh! Ah-
"Bwah!" Harry howled, tears of excitement leaking from beneath his tightly closed eyelids. "Hooo-boooy!"
He'd missed this sensation all day long—he had needed—did need—this singular feeling, every moment of every dreary hour he spent working, separated from
"Oh! Oi!" Harry yelped as his chair tilted dangerously back, teetering on just two legs. "Oh, bloody—hell, Draco—that smarts!" he complained his lover seized his upper arms in a hard grip and wrestled him directly onto the polished surface of the walnut work table. "Wanker—you're pinching me! Impatient much?"
"Hrrhn." Ron nodded along one last time, rolling his eyes at Draco as Hermione marched over the hearth and threw ash at the floo, taking him with her. And then, finally, he addressed Draco, reluctantly, just before she dragged him bodily into the gout of lime flames. Well, growled, more like. "See you 'round, loser," he said flatly, with a hint of teeth. "Don't go mucking this up and force me to come back here and
"Of course I did," Malfoy nodded, blandly ignoring Harry. "Have, I mean. How could I not? It's Potter."
“Well, you were right.” Harry grimaced, frowning at the files shoved to the edge of the coffee table. “It’s a bit consuming, being an Unspeakable. I love it, I do. But, Malfoy? I’d not have left, you know, if you hadn’t been happy with your life. Did you know? I thought about it a lot, when I was offered the Journeymenship. That I didn't want to leave you if you weren’t going to be okay with it.  Happy with Theo, too, I suppose. I’m sorry that didn’t work out for you, you know.”
, is all. It's over, alright? Finally run its course, all we had—all done now, all finished, the fucking, the flat share. And you know? You know what's so funny, Malfoy?"
Harry grimaced, darkly, thumping a fist against the sprawled open book. "Bloody hell," he grimaced. "Take a whole five minutes to say so, why don't you? Was just a simple question, Draco. So…she is gone, right? It's too late?"
"If he is, he's working," Draco frowned dourly, crossing his arms tightly over his chest. "And thus unavailable."
“Second,” Draco groaned, despairing, pressing his hand across his eyes and shutting them tightly, so as not to in any way be forced to look at the git he was talking to. Correction: attempting to address rationally. “Is, it’s bloody two o’clock in the morning. You woke me out of a sound sleep. Wailing and flailing, completely incoherent. Third, I was never truly angry with you and I’m fucking insulted you think I was--”
"Fancy!" Draco snorted, shivering under his lover's hands. "Humph!" he sniffed. "That's all very well and I should bloody well hope so, Potter. 'Cause there's no fucking way in Hades I'm ever—ever—doing this again! No. Way. In Hades.
“Are you,” Draco cut him off pleasantly enough, smiling still in a way that conveyed absolutely not a single shred of sincere good humour, “implying that just because a minor cast a Veritus Charm upon you it’s not a serious matter? Is that it?”
“Harry? It’s not Teddy, is it?” Draco demanded impatiently, casting about mentally for any other instance that might send the wind up Harry's fine arse. "Oh! Do stop fooling with that thing. Put it down and bloody answer me, will you?" He jabbed out a finger, shaking it at the irksome git. “Yes, I know, I'm remiss. I should've asked after him sooner, absolutely. I saw him myself, even, not even a few weeks ago, and he was fine. I mean, it's just that I’ve been a little reclusive lately, I admit that, truly I do, but I've also been run ragged with work and Mum’s said not a word and Auntie hasn’t either! Teddy
"Wearing—" Weaselbee gulped hard, his eyes firmly fixed upon Draco's mussed hair, "wearing very little, mate? Is it a prank, then? Is he Imperious'd?"
"Because—because I find I—I cannot c-continue to exist without—" he forged staunchly onward, gathering his Malfoyness about him like an impervious cloak of assurance and all the while aghast: at his feeble words, his foolishly pink face—and the stupid Veela wings that came ripping madly out from his robes unexpectedly, creating a huge fuss and flutter—and so much extraneous noise! Hades, he could barely hear himself speak above the windy rush of feathers—no wonder Harry was having troubles! "You. Potter. I mean to say, I—I love you—you, always, and I would be most honoured if you'd accept this token of my affections—"
“Lovely,” Draco commented, coming back into the room, a tray with the dinner accoutrements floating behind, two beers in hand, glasses floating along behind. “Ta. Here.”
His Father's hands were making some rather arcane and nasty gestures over that word. Draco didn't like the look of the one two-fingered flip, either.
"I—but—you—" Harry got out before that tongue claimed his again, and gods-Merlin-fuck but Malfoy was anal about these things. He wanted what he wanted, it seemed, and he wasn't stopping till he got it. No choice but to give in then, as every other part of Harry begged his last lingering bits of good sense and healthy sense of self-preservation to do. He didn't understand; no, he didn't. But…but maybe he didn't need to?
Harry glanced out the glass patio doors and took in the sight of his other best mate, wholeheartedly engaged in playing some sort of very messy game involving paint and Charmed bubbles and miniature catapults with his very small daughter, and laughed and laughed. Draco joined in, fondly.
,” Luna announced, and the combined cast from all three Mages fairly exploded out of the tip of her wand. “Go!”
!" Hermione snorted, her cheeks damp from happy tears. She shook her head, delighted. "The boys are fighting again—like an old married couple!" Malfoy ignored her antics; Harry only stared up at him, goggling. "So darling!"
—that horrid photo spread of Harry as the Wizarding World's premiere bachelor—and a vaguely ribald caption. Charmed, though, and nicely, to stay always full of his particular brand of tea, just the way he liked it: very stewed, two sugars and three creams, stirred lightly. No lemon.
"That's right!" Malfoy growled, white teeth a banner valiant. "Take me, Harry. Take all of me, Harry—beg for it! Say my name, Harry!" His gaze was cruel and sharp and wild; Harry melted.
. He lifted a finger absently and spelled the brown mass of Hermione's hair smooth and flat again, and she ran an appreciative hand through her tresses with a small, intimate smile.
For Draco, perched nervously upon the opposing divan, clad in just his mostly unbuttoned shirt, it was a gruelling moment. It had taken rather a lot of persuasion on his boyfriend's part to install him thus, half-naked and waiting to take Potter's rather awesomely super-fantastic cock up his bum.
Malfoy slammed home, Harry's knees bent in half against his collarbone and whitening with the applied pressure, propped up against yet still sliding clumsily off the planes of his broad shoulders what with all the sweat mingled, his face pointy-sharp with intensity and his cheeks hollowed out with visible want. Harry thought he was absolutely mind-boggling beautiful, this impassioned Malfoy; he could gaze for hours…if he didn't die of painful bliss first. His intestines rocked on their pinions as Malfoy ploughed in; he was jangled up and rearranged on every level.
It sprang apart at the seam, the paper, too soon for his liking, and he saw a glimpse of velveteen-covered box lurking beneath. Cufflinks, maybe? Last year had been a tie tack, discreetly carved with the Potter family crest. Tucked in the mug box, like an afterthought.
. Throbbing, they were—slick-sliding against each other with every inhale and exhale, every twitch and wiggle.
And because of that—and a whole host of other related items, such as no one wanting to dwell too much on what—
That sent Potter into peals of laughter, which was exactly what Draco intended, and he allowed himself a wicked grin as he slathered the lube carefully 'round Potter's not-quite-virgin arsehole. The pucker was delicate and pink and Draco could've lavished hours on it, enticing Potter into quivering, breathless readiness—indeed, inducing him to come, without ever touching his cock—but they didn't have hours.
"Directly after breakfast," Draco informed him. "I want to get an early start, before all the Thirdies clutter up the nicer shops. I've things I need—parchment, ink, a book—and we should stop in at Zonko's and Honeydukes—"
"—so you must marry me, Harry, and this is the ring, right here," he galloped on with his massive fail of a proposal, thrusting the box at Potter's half-curled hands and scowling his darkest ever, his wings pounding air a mile a moment. There was a steady shower of down filtering through the atmosphere of the garishly scarlet Common Room; it looked like early snowfall had come overnight, rather. "My Grandme're's—very important. Special, Harry. And you'll place it on your damnable finger right now, won't you? For—for me? Harry? Won't you? Say you w-will!"
“Yes. We should likely kip over again, then, tonight,” Harry suggested, pouring out his second mug and feeling sufficiently restored to doctor it up with lashings of table cream and some local honey. He met Luna's weary gaze over the rim of it. “Seriously. Shan’t do anyone much good with the state we’re in now. I don’t much fancy Portkeying to the Netherlands; do you?”
“Really?” That smarmy set of horribly well-bred features went all twinkly-evil as Malfoy leered like a common perv. “How much time is there left, did you say? Can we? Go again?”
Rather, it tumbled out of his numb fingertips, tipsily slopping tea whilst his stunned brain was grappling with the weird selection of words Harry was spewing out of his mouth. All of it in terribly slow motion. Like the progress of chilled Golden syrup, inching down over the edges of the jar. Or the ancient motions of the stars colliding in Cygnus.
Narcissa acknowledged that with another beam of white teeth. She fondled the small jeweler's case Twimbly had brought her, her eyes soft. Draco watched her intently, reassured by the way his Mum's well kept hands folded over the hinge and the tattered velvet with care.
"Oh-gods!" Harry squeaked, for it panged and it burnt and he was being stretched to the point of ripping and he could care less. Only wanted more of it, more of being Malfoy's. "Ye-ye-yes!" he managed, as Malfoy jerked his hips back, a slippery sucking noise accompanying it, one that dripped of lust, inbound. Harry closed his eyes tighter, almost unable to bear it, it was so fantastic. "Oh-oh-ah-ye-!"
A hand tugged a spare robe over Harry's goose-pimpled shoulders; he was snug and warm and lazy-cozy and tomorrow had never mattered less to Harry. He couldn't even conceive of tomorrow. He'd arrive there when he had to, not before—
No, of course that would never work, Harry huffed to himself, inflating his cheeks and blowing the air out with a frustrated little puff. Malfoy would catch on immediately (and likely hex Harry to death) and Hermione would giggle her arse off over his ineptitude, later. More than she was already, the twat.
He’d been just going along with the crowd, really. Theo and Pans; they were simply dastardly non-believers, the two of them; more caught up in ill-bred annoying gossip than the noble art of sport. Sport! Quidditch, the truest, bestest, most honoured of all Wizarding games.
“Right. Fuck,” Harry growled, yanking the first of the scrolls toward him and abruptly deciding against all of it. "
"Sure, Harry," she replied, after a longish pause. "Come on, Ron." She put a hand on her boyfriend's arm, urging him along a bit faster. "Let's go ahead, a little bit, shall we?"
Yes, then. Nice and casual, Draco decided. Incredibly casual, as if he’d not an ulterior motive in the world. He’d information to impart, in a non-combative manner. Truly. And he could do this, even if he and Potter had never particularly rubbed along; besides, he’d practiced for hours, before his mirror.
"They matter," Harry allowed. Their heads were so close together, the contrasting strands were tangling. "But you are tough, Draco. As nails. And Nev's just a baby, really. I'm not going to hurt him, alright? Neither are you and you know it, idiot, even if you won't come right out and say so. That's all there is to it, really."

Ron stopped in his tracks, causing the Huffle giggle-gaggle behind him to pile up in a flurry of squeaking limbs and pigtails. Then they sorted themselves out and streamed ‘round, wide-eyed and giggling.
Draco snogged him; instantly reeled him in right in the middle of the shop, wrapping his arms all the way 'round Potter's slighter form, engulfing him, and stuck his tongue right down Harry's throat, forcing back those last few words, cutting off the terrible word 'if' at the nub, silencing it thoroughly. There was no 'if' involved—no! Potter
Their old jest had the distinct ring of truth to it, Draco decided, feeling ominously perturbed. Harry was still clad in his Unspeakable robes, though they were unbuttoned and flapping about his legs as he busied himself with retaining both wine bottles and his glass while sidling in a polite crabwise motion towards the doorway. Draco frowned at the tense set of his friend's shoulders, at the feverishly brilliant glitter of his eyes, and even at the fact Harry had momentarily forgotten again the wonders of magic and was absentmindedly trying to juggle all that liquid-filled glassware. Huh! Clearly Harry hadn’t had a moment to himself since he’d arrived home and, if Draco knew his friend’s regretfully overcrammed work schedule, he’d been terribly late even departing the Ministry this evening.
It was true fact. Day 254 was a day that would live in infamy, forever after in their lives, his and Harry's. It required only the barest mention of it by either of them to halt any spat, end any tiff, cancel out any resentment or ill-will. And Zabini never seemed to get that, though Draco was fairly certain Harry's mates did. It didn't say much for poor old Blaise, but then poor old Blaise never did manage to fall in love, not with anyone. The only counting he did was of his massive amounts of Galleons, inherited from his mum, the murderous bint.
“Draco! Oh!” he exclaimed. He twitched visibly under the concentrated stare Draco had perfected many years previous. “Didn’t even see you there. Oi, when did you get home?”
“Arsehole!” Harry snarled, introspective mood completely fled for the morning. He scowled and all the platters and dishes trembled. Lavender squeaked in fear. “Shut your damned gob and sit your arse down, Ron! Right now! This is entirely uncalled for. You will pay for this, git! I’ll make damned sure of it!”
Ducking furtively, Draco darted through the flames, briefly flailing about and then falling to his feet gracefully enough as he stepped out upon the Ministry side, the Manor safely behind him.
In the Great Hall, no less, Potter was on his knees, abruptly—no warning. With a ring in hand and a posy of fragrant red roses in the other, resplendant and bedewed, and there was romantic music playing somehow, magically. And the eyes of all the entire school and its many, many inhabitants—available portraits, ghosts and Peeves included—were fixed upon them. Snape, too!
Just this…scant meetings in-between cases and the occasional feel of Draco's palm spread at the small of his back in the Ministry lifts. As if by accident, should anyone be looking at them.
"If I stay, Draco." Harry swallowed hard, pained bog-green eyes searching glass-grey ones. "Then you already have."
Such a very mundane thing, a day spent wandering the local town, sampling its wares and offerings. (Salazar, the Third Years were the ones who got worked up over a Hogsmeade weekend,
He and Luna made nice with the helpful--and somewhat magically BeDazzled--group of Paleontological researchers who’d been kind enough to provide them access and then made their way to town.   Antillana del Mar was chock-a-bloc with ancient and historical everything, just clotted with the venerable, but it was also awash with tourists and the two Mages happily took refuge in the ever-reliable Los Blasones for a much needed repast.
Clear skin, nearly translucent hair. Bones that looked to be hand-carved, whittled down but still with a hint of ‘pointy’, under that perfect skin. And the articulation of the Malfoy skeleton was vastly pretty, Harry had decided some time before. He’d seen Inferi up close and personal, right? Draco might be boney and thin-skinned, like them, but his allotment of physical attractiveness existed on the other end of the spectrum entirely.
Draco's lips remained parted; he licked them again, blinking rapidly and turning abruptly away to stare at the faint outline of ambient light wreathing the sole window. Harry hastened to wedge that assumption into the ever-widening abyss he'd just dug, gathering himself up in a coil and falling into a loosely held-together set of fears by Draco's side. The mattress gave slightly as he settled, hands on lap, a tense bundle of over-exposed bits.
His jaw dropped in consternation. Draco rocked back on his heels, the jewelry box slipping unnoted from suddenly numb fingertips.
Secretly, and only in the privacy of his own mind, Draco admitted he was fucking terrified to even venture down into the cellars or up to the attics, for fear of what new horrors he might discover.
," he repeated, insistently. "If you can't be civil, then you need to take yourself off. I won't stand for it. I told you."
“Fuck! Luna!” he shouted, looking forward to the back of his friend, steadily maintaining position at the apex of their triangle. “She's in trouble! Assist?”
Ethelred was Draco's long-eared owl, to replace the eagle owl he'd lost in the war. Ethelred was aptly named, too, being a total twit, with little to no sense of actual direction. Ethelred might or might not go where he was sent, on any given day; they both generally employed Ernestine to actually Owl something. A useless waste of feathers and good cage space, that Ethelred. But Harry loved him too, the silly sot, and so Draco kept him on, the useless thing.
“No. I’m serious; I need your help, really I do," Harry went on. "I’m glad you’re here and not only because it’s been far too long since we’ve had a chance to catch up. I’ve missed the hell out of you--and your bloody braininess. I need all those mental muscles of yours on my side right now. I’m a bit stumped with what’s happened here, alright, and I'm more than a little worried that I
Harry had become rather adept at counting, although that was only a side benefit. He'd become far more facile at puzzling out meanings from what, to an untrained eye, all too often appeared like the scratchings of enormous viciously taloned birds. But that was generally the ones on the Stones, standing. There were plenty of other sorts of runes, some to be found scribed in ancient reed or skin parchments, some to be found on tomb or cavern walls (those two ofttimes one and the same) and some which were only but fair copies of long-lost runes, meticulously transcribed, culled from scholarly Wizarding writings, grimoires and journals.
He stomped fully backward into the floo, snatching at the powder jar they kept close by and dumping a cloudy shower of it over his neatly combed head in his haste to escape. Potter’s voice stopped abruptly, cut off as Draco was nearly instantly whirled away, though last Draco saw, his stupid mouth was still open and stupidly flapping.
"Haven't you," Draco persisted softly, gamely stoic in the face of just plain grimness, and because he was also insanely curious and it was a sign maybe, a ray of hope. "Already altered them? When you." He wet his lips, biting down hard on the lower one when Harry scowled. "When you first came here, after?"
"Yes, Harry; that's all very well and good but it's still a filthy place and likely it's still haunted. Must we do this here?"
see Pansy!" Draco stepped blindly back towards the hearth, eyes never leaving the face of his one-time enemy. "Right now, this instant. Pansy is sane and she fucking had kids because she wanted to, not because she's an all too easily influenced saphead, Potter!”
He took a hasty gulp of his own tea, nerves skittering madly under his shaken façade; clearly, his Mum was no dummy. Possibly she was unnaturally precipient as well!
"It's not our flat." Harry pursed his lips, twisting a lock of dark hair into an unruly corkscrew and staring at it cross-eyed. “It’s only that...well, I suppose I miss it, just a little. Grimmauld. Like you probably miss living at the Manor, I imagine. You do, right?”
"I do," she vouchsafed, tilting her chin at him. "Oh! But darling boy," she cooed. "There's no earthly need for that odd face you're making. Do cease at once, Draco. You'll wrinkle prematurely. Or perhaps the wind will go and change on you—you never know, dear."
"Have an early lunch, too, as the service is always better before two," Draco nattered on, planning their itinerary aloud.
"Bloody Hades," Draco whimpered. "Tempus." It had taken only ten short minutes, start to finish. He'd have to fucking do better next time or Potter might assume he was new at this lover business.
For there was nothing worse, as Draco was actively discovering, that being a nineteen year old man forcibly thrust into the act of confessing the details of his suddenly rather torrid love life to his own mother. Well, not by any means all the details—Draco flushed a deeper shade of rose pink, blinking hurriedly—but enough. It was literally worse even than Draco's enforced cowering before a hideous Dark Lord or his suffering the torments of an unrequited passion for Potter all these years; it was more ludicrously unsettling than his horrible awkwardness over the feathery appendages his unfortunate paternal ancestry had thrust upon him.
“I want you both to fuck me,” Draco said, his voice already pitched low with lust, his pupils wide. Harry knew he’d been thinking about this moment for days.
Most mornings, Harry follows the same routine: He apparates to the Ministry, rides the lift to the MLE floor, weaves through the maze of cubicles to his desk, takes a moment to check his memos for anything urgent, then makes his way to the kitchenette for a cup of tea. The kitchenette is down the hall from the Auror office, past the Wizengamot admin offices. It’s not intentional that Harry walks past Draco Malfoy’s desk at about 9:10, it’s just part of the routine.
“I suppose we are,” Charlie answered. Already his gaze lingered on Draco’s parted lips. Harry could only imagine what Charlie was thinking of doing to that lush mouth - perhaps what Harry himself had done to Draco only hours earlier. He bit his lip as his cock twitched. Dinner first, they’d decided. Food and wine and talk, then they could do as they liked.
Harry raises his eyebrows. “You get it from the cafeteria at least once a week. I assumed you liked it, but I guess I could see you just torturing yourself with it.” He takes another bite and prays Malfoy never asks why Harry knows what he eats for lunch.
It’s a Thursday. Malfoy barges into Harry’s office raving about file mismanagement, waving two cartons of curry, just after noon. No invitation, no knock.
.” Whatever Draco was, he’d never know, as he’d taken most of Harry’s cock into his mouth and sucked his cheeks hollow. He reached his tongue down toward the base, savoring the feeling of the pulsing vein, and began to bob his head, getting more and more of Harry into his mouth.
When he passes Malfoy’s desk, the chair is empty. Harry frowns and stomps the rest of the way to the kitchenette. He pilfers a banana from the fruit bowl, aware that this will likely be his only break today, and pulls the peel back before starting back to his cubicle.
“Oh. You’re welcome?” Draco felt stupid, looming over them with his uneaten cake, so without looking at Potter, he sat back down and reached for a fork.
“I’m close,” Draco says, somewhere between a whine and a groan. Harry wants to live there, in that breathy wanting moment. He nods, pulls Draco even closer, tries to remember to breathe—
Stars were shooting across the night sky four and five at a time. Within a few minutes, the whole sky was covered in them, silver trails eclipsing the black expanse. Draco watched Harry’s face as it filled with awe.
All said, Draco Malfoy is decidedly part of Harry’s morning routine now. It isn’t that Harry looks forward to seeing him, or that they’re friends. The quick jokes and friendly smiles are equivalent in importance to the twenty-six foot walk from the apparition point to the lift button. Just another step  that makes each morning regular.
Draco is flushed, lips parted, and he looks beautiful. He gets a knee between Harry’s thighs before Harry pulls him down. He can feel that Draco is already hard against him. Draco grabs Harry’s wrist, kisses the thin skin over his veins, nips his way to Harry’s elbow.
Harry took the chance to straddle Charlie’s hips. He could feel Charlie’s hardness beneath him and gave the bulge a perfunctory rub. Charlie moaned into Draco’s arse; Draco moaned into Harry’s waiting mouth.
Tiny, furry nifflers were wriggling around inside, crawling over each other and peep-ing softly. There were several gold coins in with them, the nifflers grasping them with their itty-bitty paws.
Teddy spotted him and screeched, “Draco!” Draco felt his heart swell in his chest and gave Teddy a peck on the top of his head. There was an open spot next to Teddy, and feeling brave, Draco sat down, not daring to look up at the others gathered around him. He was sure they were glaring at him, talking about him under their breath—but Teddy wanted him there, and it was Teddy’s party.
“You’re so tight, baby. You feel so good around my cock,” Charlie said softly, rubbing circles on Draco’s hips with his thumbs. Draco hummed and pushed back further, another inch inside. Charlie pulled back and then slowly forward, then shifted lower on his knees. He pulled almost all the way out, then delivered a quick, short thrust, and Draco cried out. “Is that it, baby? Is that good?” He did it again, and Draco sobbed.
For that first year, Potter looked like a corpse. He was thin, gaunt, pale; his hair, always so unwieldy, hung limp as if tired from a long day. Potter smiled when required, posed for magazine covers, but Draco could see the pain in his face. Draco wondered if everyone else saw it too, and ignored it in favor of moving on, or if Draco only recognized it because it lived in him too.
Draco knows he probably needs to get up—from the light he can tell it’s close to 6 AM—but ignoring his responsibilities in favor of lying in bed with a beautiful man is an easy choice. He scoots toward Harry, carefully wraps an arm over his ribcage. Harry sighs in his sleep and presses against him.
“Can I suck your cock, baby?” Harry asked, already leaning down to admire the pool of precome gathered on Charlie’s sweater.
He wasn’t sure about the logistics, but Draco was far too clever to get involved in something over his head. “Sounds good.”
Malfoy looked up then, and afterwards Harry would credit their entire relationship to that moment: Malfoy all squatted down, fine robes sprinkled with kneazle hair, smiling gently up at Harry. The reception hall seemed to fade away for a second, the music and heat of the room dulling, and Harry thought,
Draco felt like he’d just walked into one of those dreams where nothing makes sense. He cleared his throat.
Harry nodded. “Kiss me,” he breathed, and Draco did, adding a second finger at the same time. Harry moaned into the kiss when Draco found his prostate, rubbing with gentle strokes. Draco scissored his fingers, gently stretching Harry, listening as his breathing became quick again.
They sat at a small, plastic table outside. The same soft guitar music played out of a speaker on the wall, and little strings of lights were hung across the open space above them. It was quieter, just the two of them. Draco was still a little disarmed by the turn of events, but the cool night air felt calming.
Harry catches a glimpse of white-blonde in the Wizengamot file room and stops. Perhaps Malfoy has a moment to chat; perhaps this day won’t be so bad after all.
The room was almost overwhelming with the booming music, made more claustrophobic by wixen shouting to be heard above the slightly-out-of-date hits. Harry still hated crowds, but Hermione had made him promise to stay for at least an hour, so he’d wandered over to the least-populated corner to get some air. And there was Malfoy, his face soft, a little smile pulling at his lips as he lavished compliments on the little kneazle.
Harry’s cock twitched as Draco crawled into position. He lowered his arse over Charlie’s mouth, using the arm of the sofa behind him for support. Harry watched as Charlie spread Draco’s cheeks apart and he could tell the moment Charlie licked across Draco’s hole; Draco keened and ground down toward the sensation.
The night of, Draco spent two hours getting ready in Harry’s bathroom - though Harry had no idea what could take two hours, he let him be - while Harry prepared their dinner. Harry drank half a bottle of Merlot in an attempt to calm his nerves, so by the time Charlie knocked, he felt warm and slightly turned on.
“You do make me—well, I’m not sure stressed is the right word.” Harry barely recognizes his own voice, deeper and quieter. He strokes his hand down Draco’s neck. His skin is soft, warm.
I'm sorry for letting the Death Eater in, I'm sorry for being a twat, I'm sorry about what I did to Katie Bell, I'm sorry about what I called your best friends. I'm sorry about everything I've done the last seven years.
Harry runs his hand up Draco’s abdomen, through the thick blond hair from his cock to his navel. “Was hoping you’d fuck
One afternoon in April, Draco was standing at Andromeda’s kitchen counter, drying plates after she washed them. Initially, he had thought it was ridiculous that she didn’t use magic, but he had come to find it sort of meditative. On the ground, Teddy clanged together a wooden spoon and a pot, laughing at himself.
They sit in silence for a few minutes, Harry determinedly not looking at Malfoy but also trying not to look like he’s not looking. It’s awkward.
“Mm, sounds like it. Well, I’ve got to get back to this. See you.” Malfoy shrugs and resumes shifting through the folders scattered on the table.
When Draco hesitated, Charlie slapped the side of his arse. Draco yelped and stood, cock bobbing as he moved.
That settled, Harry sorts out the next few files quickly—robbery, spell damage to residence, broom theft, missing toad—and he’s just about to get up for tea when a paper dragon slides under his door.
“We’re gonna take care of you, baby,” Charlie said, throaty. “Turn around on my lap. I want to watch you kiss Harry.”
“—can’t even tell person files from place! Next it’ll be, what, alphabetical by average temperature in June?” Malfoy heaves a heavy sigh. “I like the cheese. And it’s called paneer.”
Draco choked on his lemonade, coughing unglamorously into his elbow. When he could breathe again, he said, “Coffee?”
Draco wakes slowly, lazily, the comfort of sleep only rivaled by the unfamiliarity of the room around him. There are birds outside the cracked window, singing softly. Early sunlight filters over him like gentle fingers caressing the bed. He’s warm, tangled in a soft duvet, his face in a pillow that smells like sandalwood and—
Harry relaxed around him (Draco was relieved—he’d been half-worried Harry had never done this before) and Draco slowly moved his finger out and back in. After a few strokes, he said, “Another?”
Harry did as he was told and accepted the glass of merlot. Draco scooted closer and Harry laid his arm out so Draco could rest his head on it. “Are we camping?”
Harry looked at him in surprise. “Oh, I thought we could still go to dinner. If that’s okay with you.”
It takes a while for Draco to will himself out of Harry’s bed. He had planned, last night, to wake with enough time to return to his own flat to get ready for work, but… holding Harry, watching the miracle of his chest rising and falling, breathing in his smell—it’s impossible for Draco to let go. The dawn light does something magical to Harry’s skin, making it look like he’s glowing golden bronze. Draco wants to hold onto this, to memorize this moment.
Harry kissed him then, and Draco let him explore his mouth with his tongue. Draco rubbed his hands up and down Harry’s thighs, adoring the rasp of hair, until Harry bucked his hips and moaned. Draco pulled back. “Is this okay?” he asked, sliding a finger under Harry’s waistband.
From there, they progressed to saying, “Hello,” “Good morning,” and “Alright?” Some mornings, Harry even stopped for a quick chat. A few times, he asked if Malfoy wanted a cup of tea, and once Malfoy had.
“One more,” murmured Draco, adding a third finger. It was almost unbearable—he wanted to be inside Harry
Malfoy snorts at him but dutifully takes a bite. He closes the file folders spread across his desk and waves them away. “So we’re doing this now?”
Draco nodded minutely and slid down until the tip hit the back of his throat. Harry moaned; he knew what came next. Draco relaxed his throat, allowing Harry to push gently until he was buried. Draco looked up at Harry, tears and love in his eyes, and Harry stroked his cheek as he pulled back. Draco leaned away for a moment to breathe.
Draco licked a stripe up the bottom of Harry’s cock and took the head into his mouth. Harry tangled a hand in Draco’s hair and tried not to come immediately. He looked up to see Charlie slowly working his own cock.
While they wait, Malfoy points out the canvases and talks about the artists who painted them. The one Harry likes most is by a young artist Draco seems to admire, judging by the way his eyes go soft when he talks about the brushstrokes. Harry considers buying it, but wonders if that would be too awkward. He decides against it.
“This alright?” he asked softly, and Harry licked his lips and nodded. Draco tugged on Harry’s shorts until Harry lifted up a bit and shimmied them down his legs. He kicked them off as Draco planted wet kisses on Harry’s inner thigh, breathing in the intoxicating scent. He licked a line up where Harry’s leg met his hip and Harry bit back a moan.
“I haven’t slept with him since we started dating,” Harry said. “We’re friends, but also - he taught me, you know? He helped me figure this out.”
“Hello,” came a soft voice from his side. Draco nearly jumped out of his skin. He turned to see Luna Lovegood smiling distantly at him, holding what appeared to be an enthusiastically-decorated stick. She turned it end over end and it made a sound like beads were rolling from one end to the other. “Rainmaker?” Lovegood asked, looking at Draco expectantly.
Afterward, they lay together, Draco’s head on Harry’s chest, talking in soft voices. Draco told Harry about writing the letter to Andromeda; Harry told Draco about walking into the forest that day in May, knowing he was about to die. Draco traced Harry’s ribs and thanked whatever fates or gods had put them there, together in the dark, tingling with Harry’s cleaning charm and the very beginnings of love.
Harry tongued the sensitive slit and savored the salty taste there before sliding his tongue along the underside of the head. He blew gently against the saliva he left behind and wrapped his fingers around the base tightly. Draco was panting now, little breathy mewls under each breath. Harry took his cock fully in his mouth, sucking down and pulling back, until he felt Draco’s soft blond curls against his nose. He backed off and swirled his tongue around the head, then went back down.
Draco had never seen anyone else at Andromeda’s house, but logically he knew she had a wide circle of friends. The cottage was full of photos of people, some Draco recognized from school. Several featured Potter and his crew. There was one picture in particular that Draco had watched a few times, mesmerized: A view over someone’s shoulder as they cradled a sleeping infant Teddy in their hands. A broad thumb brushed over one squishy cheek, making Teddy sprout an involuntary toothless smile. Draco knew immediately that it was Potter holding Teddy; his messy curls took up an entire corner of the frame. Draco found himself wishing the camera would show Potter’s face too.
A roar and a scream emanated from the television and Draco broke off. “Maybe we could…” He gestured at the screen. Harry twisted around and pressed a button on the remote.
Harry called Charlie that night and asked him over for dinner. Charlie accepted quickly, and told Harry he’d been looking forward to meeting Draco again. Harry took that as a good omen.
Teddy banged his spoon on the cabinet. “Cake! My cake!” The spoon bounced off the cabinet and whacked Teddy’s forehead. He sat stunned for a moment, looked up at Draco, and started wailing.
Draco does that thing again where he looks at Harry like he’s figuring out an arithmancy problem. “I asked what you’re doing today.”
Harry kisses him, and Draco knows he intended it to be innocent, but Draco deepens the kiss. He crowds Harry against the counter. Harry smiles. “What time do you need to be at the cafe?”
“—but if you really want to stop being miserable, you need to talk to him. You said he was asking you to lunch? Ask him back. If he says yes, there you go. If he says no, give him space.”
Calliope clawed up Harry’s back and burrowed into his hair; Euterpe snuffled his way into Harry’s hoodie pocket. “Sounds good to me.”
Harry knew, at that point, that Malfoy was several years into magi-veterinary school, but he knew it in the way he knew Pansy Parkinson had opened an interior decorating business—sort of peripherally. He and Malfoy had even chatted a little about magi-vet courses once it became clear that their social circles would continue to overlap. And yet, Harry had somehow never put together that Malfoy’s pursuit of the career meant that he probably liked animals.
? Not another Quidditch player, please.” Dean was the one who introduced Harry to Brad, the American Keeper with a big laugh and great arms. It had been awkward between Dean and Harry for months after Harry broke it off with Brad.
Harry takes Draco into his mouth and sucks. The angle makes it difficult for him to pull Draco in as much as he wants to, but he curls his fingers around Draco’s and strokes what won’t fit. Harry can feel his own cock leaking in his pants. Draco smells so good, hot and clean, and Harry doesn’t touch himself because he knows he’ll come. He twists his free hand into the white lace and moans at all the sensations—Draco pushing over his tongue, his salty precome bitter and sweet, his weight on Harry’s chest, the horrible teasing press of Harry’s boxers against his desperate prick—and as he strokes his thumb across the lace again, he knows he’s close, he won’t even need to touch himself.
Draco nodded, fighting the odd feeling in his stomach. “Alright. I suppose that makes sense.” He took a bite of his cake for something to do. Potter fidgeted with his napkin.
Harry treats the clerk’s minor burn, vanishes the spilt tea, and practically runs to his office. He slams the door and groans. Don’t be a prat, Ron said. Obviously that was too much to hope for, since Harry has always been and will always be a brainless sod when Malfoy is around.
Harry found Draco in the corner of the room at Neville and Blaise’s wedding reception in 2004. Draco was crouched down and feeding bits of roast chicken to Anastasia, Blaise’s kneazle. “So pretty, aren’t you,” Draco murmured as Anastasia rubbed against his no doubt ridiculously expensive trousers. Anastasia purred in agreement, still wearing the little petticoat Pansy had forced onto her for ring-bearer duty.
Harry looked dazed, completely wrecked. His nipples were hard, his chest heaving. “Yeah, I’m—” He laughed and bent down to kiss Draco. “I’m so good. I just want to last longer.”
Teasing, Draco blew on Harry’s cock, smiling at the tight twitch it elicited. He licked the bead of precome from the tip, and this time Harry groaned. Draco smiled sweetly. “Doing okay?”
Andromeda had prepared a little spread of sandwiches and scones. They sat in a sunroom, the wintery coast in view, and watched Teddy perform various feasts of toddler gymnastics. Teddy’s interests seemed to be primarily insects, sweets, and the sound of his own yells.
Draco heard a snort from behind him, then he was jostled as someone took a seat in the small space beside him. It was entirely too close to be polite. Draco glanced up to see who would possibly want to sit so near him and he was met with all-too-familiar green eyes.
“Good boy, baby,” Charlie murmured, pulling one arse cheek to the side. “I’m gonna open you up now, that okay?”
It was quite busy, which meant Draco could keep himself occupied—Mondays were hit or miss depending on the weather and the phrase of the moon, Katelyn explained when Draco had started the job the year before—and Draco had nearly forgotten Potter by the lunch rush. Of course, then a mischievous little girl snuck behind the counter to help, which reminded Draco of Teddy, which reminded him that Potter was coming—or not—in just under an hour.
“I could help you, if you like.” Draco thinks of the stacks and stacks of heritage documents in his family vaults. The Potters must be in there.
Harry elbowed him. “Fernando, this is Draco. We’re actually here for dinner. Maybe a couple of al pastor, some elotes, er--” He looked at Draco. “Not so spicy on the pastor?”
When they left, they walked for a little while in the dusk, both of them quiet. Draco felt content; loneliness had been his constant companion since his mother died, but it eased with Harry. Strong, brash, warm Harry.
“Forget it. See you in the morning, Potter.” Draco is out the door before Harry can process what’s happened.
“Well, it’s over now. I make enough at the cafe to get by in my flat, and maybe someday the Ministry will give it all back. To my grandchildren.” Draco laughed bitterly. “Let’s get back to it, hm?”
But Harry doesn’t feel friendly towards Draco. He barely catches himself before reaching out to touch Malfoy’s hand; he constantly second-guesses whether he’s sitting too close, staring too much. He is, he knows. But Malfoy’s mouth moves in these horrible, wonderful ways when he talks, when he smiles. Malfoy has that same smirk that used to make Harry’s hands curl into fists. Now Harry doesn’t really feel less violent; he wants to bite Malfoy’s lips, his neck, his fingers. He wants to bruise him, scratch him, maybe smack him—but he wants Malfoy to like it.
He brushes his thumb against Draco’s lips, curls his fingers under Draco’s jaw. He feels the stubble there. He feels the slight crack in Draco’s bottom lip where it’s chapped. Draco inhales, shakily, but doesn’t move.
He wonders what Ron’s reaction would be if Harry told him about the lace. It only took three drinks for Harry to confess he couldn’t stop thinking about the conversation (if you could call it that); one more and he’d probably feel okay about giving up the rest of the details. Harry realizes that most likely means it’s time to go to bed.
Potter was surprisingly good at street parking, but Draco still had no idea where they were eating. Harry had driven them into a part of town Draco wasn’t familiar with--squat brick buildings practically on top of each other, laundry hung out to dry on the small balconies, old men sitting in plastic chairs talking over cheap beer.
Draco moans as Harry comes. He covers Harry’s body with his own, whispers in his ear, “You did so well,” and Harry can’t help the sigh that escapes. He falls asleep and dreams of lace.
—like this. He’s dying to see more of Malfoy, to taste him, to feel the soft threads under his hands.
He would never, ever tell a soul he’d had feelings for Potter since they’d had a few too many drinks at Neville, Ginny, and Luna’s wedding years ago. It was hard enough admitting it to himself, let alone squashing that little voice that whispered his fondness for the idiot had been around since Hogwarts.
Draco smiled unconsciously, then set his jaw in what he hoped was a nonchalant sort of way. “Hello.”
Draco quietly accepted his slice and started to slide off the bench, intending to go home. Potter caught his arm.
Draco stroked his own cock, coating himself, and added a little more at Harry’s entrance. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco’s waist.
Harry pulled his shirt off and began unbuttoning his flies. Draco knocked away Harry’s hands. “Let me help,” he said. His thin fingers carefully opened the buttons, slowly revealing Harry’s dark curls, until at last Draco pulled Harry’s fat cock free. He licked his lips.
Then one Friday morning, when Harry was particularly cheerful due to his recent sweeping win in the Auror fantasy Quidditch league, he grinned at Malfoy as he passed. Malfoy gave a little wave in return.
He peeks in Harry’s cabinet, telling himself it’s just to see what his chances are of finding any hair products he can actually use. It’s surprisingly well-stocked: hand lotion, shaving kit, moisturizers, cologne, spare shampoo bottles. Draco takes a moment to uncap the cologne and almost melts—so that’s where that Harry-smell comes from.
Harry glanced at him. “I asked her for help on where to take you. She said the posher, the better.” He looked around. “I guess I didn’t get that quite right.”
It was the same reaction everyone Draco told someone. He sighed. “Something like ‘You’ll have plenty of experience to draw on then,’ or ‘Figuring out the light side’s secrets for next time?’ Usually along those lines.”
Before he could calculate an answer, Draco’s mouth said, “Not really.” He didn’t know why he was so honest—he kicked himself for not saying he had an appointment.
Two weeks after Teddy’s birthday, they met for dinner. Draco picked the place—”I did all the work last time,” Harry teased—so they ate curry at a little place by the cafe. Harry poked fun at Draco begging the waiter for yogurt after just a bite of his dish, but gave up his water glass when Draco pouted.
Harry stops chewing the bit of banana in his mouth. His brain, usually clunky but fully functional, comes to a screeching halt. His thoughts are suddenly replaced with:
Draco took Harry’s balls in one hand, rolling and gently tugging, and Harry started jerking his hips. “Fuck, babe, that’s so— Ah—” He was breathing hard now, the tip of his cock bumping against the back of Draco’s throat as he swallowed around him. “I’m— Wait, hold on—”
Malfoy jumps and turns, pulling his wand from his sleeve in one smooth motion. Of course, Harry thinks vaguely, even in a panic he’s graceful. “Potter, are you alright?”
Draco allows himself a moment to stretch his shoulders in the foggy heat of Harry’s bathroom before he opens the door. The room has grown lighter in his absence, but Harry is missing from his bed. Draco takes a moment to appreciate that Harry kicked the covers from his side of the bed sometime before dawn; he wonders if Harry does that every night. Smiling to himself, he hopes he’ll spend enough nights with Harry to find out.
Harry looked at the bicorn’s black eyes, covered partially by shaggy brown fur. He bent down to stroke her nose; she was very soft.
After a couple of hours, Harry stood up to stretch and wipe some of the dust off his hands. He looked around at the cavernous vault, the various furniture pieces covered in sheets, and Draco studied him. Harry had filled out since that first awful year of trials. He’d told Draco he’d started running in the evenings and it suited him. He was not tall—part of Draco was quite pleased that Harry had never caught up to him in height—but he had broad shoulders and strong legs. Harry’s back and chest muscles were visible under the old t-shirts he perpetually dressed himself in. Draco found he wanted to see what Harry looked like underneath them.
Harry sat back up, never letting up in his rhythm on Draco’s cock, and watched as his boyfriend’s face contorted in ecstasy. Ropes of come landed on Harry’s hand and Charlie’s sweater. Draco finally leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder, shuddering.
Harry’s stomach flips. Is Malfoy flirting or just being his usual prickly self? “Posh stuff. French food. What’s coq au vin? Maybe that.”
Malfoy’s eyes slide toward the door. Harry moves sideways; he doesn’t like anyone blocking him in rooms, and he’s willing to bet Malfoy likes his exits clear too. “Yes, Potter. Lunch. Usually a midday meal. You do eat meals? I suppose that was rather a leap—”
“—and Wilfred said—get this—Wilfred said it doesn’t even matter!” Malfoy’s saying as he opens the curry on Harry’s coffee table. He produces two forks, drops one on the empty plate he’s set aside for Harry, and piles every bit of paneer onto his own plate. “Doesn’t matter? I’ll hear him say that when it’s the middle of the night and there’s five Aurors breathing down his neck while he tries to pull files that aren’t color-coded! Honestly. How else would we know—”
Draco stops in Harry’s front doorway to peek in the accent mirror there before heading to work. He’s flushed, his hair is a mess, and he clearly looks like he’s just been thoroughly fucked.
“James Black, yes. We do have you for May 23, sir, but I’m afraid the booking is for one year from now. I’m terribly sorry.” The hostess did not look at all apologetic.
He signs a formal Disciplinary Action Plan (which states his office will be added to the list of Amourous Relations Surveillance Sites); he denies any use coercive magic; he dodges two invitations to state dinners; he gives awful advice about disclosing personal relationships to one’s superiors; he agrees to have a mediated counseling session with Penny Nguyen; and he suffers through a horrific conversation with Kinsley about safer sex.
“They just need to stay with us until they’re old enough to eat solid food, then we can send them to a sanctuary.” Draco waved his wand at one of the gold coins, levitating it slowly around the incubator, letting the little animals chase after it excitedly. Harry felt his heart swell at the look on Draco’s face, so soft and affectionate.
Draco smiled. Harry had a little fleck of food at the corner of his mouth. Draco reached out and brushed it off. “Take me back in a year, then.”
Harry moved away just a little, panting. “I haven’t, er, prepped or anything, but I know the spells if you’re okay with—”
And then Harry’s hand is stroking Draco’s cock through the lace and Harry wonders if you can die from happiness. It’s better than he imagined, all those nights in bed and mornings in the shower. Draco is thick, the tip leaking through the fabric, and Harry
, which is coincidentally what’s coming out of his mouth, too. He feels Draco smile and Harry swipes his tongue across Draco’s teeth.
“Yeah.” Harry pulled his shirt over his head in one swift movement and Draco nearly salivated. He leaned forward to lick one dark brown nipple and Harry sighed, running his fingers through Draco’s hair.
When Draco arrived at his flat that night, his feet were sore from walking and his cheeks were sore from smiling.
“Harry, what say you get those clothes off and let me watch this pretty boy get your cock in his mouth?”
“Er, that’s hard to answer. I think, yeah, I would like to, but I’m not about to do anything to throw this away.” Harry gestured between them.
He snakes a hand between them and starts on Draco’s belt. Draco bucks against him, huffs a surprised breath.
Draco fucks Harry fast, the first time, on the first stair landing. Harry shudders as he comes, legs wrapped around Draco’s waist, one hand tangled in the black lace around Draco’s hips. He watches Draco’s face as he comes just after. Draco watches him too.
Draco fell asleep without knowing it; he dreamed of sandalwood and dusk and bronze-brown fingers intertwined with his.
They started sending letters then, just little jokes back and forth. Once, Draco woke up for his early shift to find Harry’s owl perched at the end of his bed clutching a note that just said Good morning. Knowing Harry, he’d set an alarm to get up and send the letter before Draco woke up. Draco taped the note to his bathroom mirror.
“Mm, I get the feeling he’s bad a lot,” Charlie said with a grin. “Draco, be a good boy and stand up for a moment.”
Ron pats Harry’s back. “My advice is: Act normal, try not to be a prat around him, see what happens. Have normal conversations.”
They’re quiet as the funky music from the cafe’s speakers fills the space. Harry finds himself feeling comfortable, strangely so. He feels sort of warm, like he does at Ron and Hermione’s house when he’s there late, after a few beers and food and games of chess.
“Auror Potter! I was just about to send you a note. Have you had a chance to look at the report Jones sent you about the Greenwich case?”
The next time, a few hours later, Draco washes Harry in the shower, fingers him delicate and sweet. Harry thinks he’s never been more vulnerable or turned on. He rides Draco on his bed, leisurely, reverently, and Draco presses hot kisses everywhere he can reach. Draco comes first, then spends a glorious eternity with his mouth on Harry’s hole. He wraps black, silky lace around Harry’s cock and strokes so,
.” Draco lets his hands fall down Harry’s back, loving the little shiver it inspires. He’s sure he’ll never get enough of the way Harry feels under his fingertips. “You look pretty nice yourself.”
It’s a Wednesday morning, and Harry already knows the day will be off, because he is waylaid by notoriously chatty Polly Nguyen on his way to the lift and then has three new Very Urgent case files on his desk. By the time he has assigned investigators and liaisons to each of them, it is 11:15, and his head is throbbing from the lack of caffeine.
He ran his hands from Harry’s bare knees up under his shorts until he felt Harry’s briefs at his hips. Harry’s breathing quickened and Draco wanted to
. His grumbling stomach reminded him he hadn’t eaten in several hours and whatever was on the menu here would do very nicely. The inside of the restaurant was bright, with colorful paper squares with intricate patterns of holes decorating the eves, along with gorgeous paintings of tropical birds on the walls. Quiet music was playing over tinny speakers, just barely audible above the chatter across the tables.
“I don’t think we can give him up,” said Draco into the dark one night. They were laying in bed, listening to the nifflers scampering around their room. Harry was almost asleep and had his arm tucked around Draco’s waist. “We’re his family now,” Draco continued.
Draco apparated to the field a little before 11. He spread out a quilt, charmed the wine glasses not to spill, and threw up some basic anti-insect shields.
Draco took a second to soak in this moment—Harry laid out for him, hard and wanting, messy and completely perfect. He kissed both of Harry’s cheeks in a burst of sweetness. Harry kissed him hungrily as he pressed his cock in, only stopping to breathe when Draco paused to give him time to adjust. Harry moved his hips slightly to one side and then back the other way. Draco held absolutely still, praying he didn’t come too quickly.
They were soon independent enough to manage a few hours by themselves in the flat, confined to a bedroom with more safety and monitoring charms than Gringotts. Draco popped in at lunch to refill their food dishes and confiscate whatever shiny contraband they’d managed to find. Harry couldn’t help but fall a little more in love with Draco every time he checked the camera he’d installed in the nifflers’ room while they were out; this kind of care and attention was something Draco hid from the world, protective of his vulnerabilities. Seeing it was a special kind of intimacy that Harry knew was rare.
He didn’t expect a response, but the very next morning, a tawny owl dropped a note next to his cup of coffee.
Harry nearly jumps out of his skin at the sound of the voice beside him. He realizes he still has a bite of banana in his mouth and manages to swallow it without choking. He is, for the first time in his career, grateful that Aurors are required to wear uniform robes as he turns to face the witch next to him.
It is then that Harry’s brain catches up to what his eyes are seeing. Malfoy is reaching up to a high shelf, assumedly searching for a file. His shirt has come untucked from his trousers. A little sliver of pale skin is visible beneath the hem.
Draco had his wand out, expanding Annie’s barn, humming happily. “What do you want for dinner?” he asked.
“She’s a charmer,” Harry answers. He turns to face Malfoy, who has tucked his shirt back into its place and looks proper as ever. Harry thinks of the lace; he recalls the thoughts he had moments ago. A flush creeps up his cheeks.
They made it through a bottle of wine and the first course before Draco was caressing Charlie’s thigh under the table with his foot. Harry kissed Draco’s neck softly when he got up for more bread, and Draco moaned quietly. Harry saw as Charlie adjusted himself under the table. They locked eyes in understanding.
Draco was well into veterinary school by the time Harry pulled his head out of his arse and realized they liked each other. True to form, Draco had known for years that Harry liked him—“Since we did that week-long plant care course with Longbottom in 2001, you dimwit,” Draco liked to say with affection. Unfortunately, as Hermione frequently pointed out, age did nothing to improve Harry’s ability to recognize his own emotions.
Just then, the front door chimed. In walked Potter, wearing a ridiculous beanie over his hair and a wide smile.
Harry and the kid are both covered in scalding hot Earl Grey, the kid babbling, “I’m sorry, so sorry—Harry—I mean—Auror Potter—so sorry—” as Harry wishes he could sink into the carpet.
Harry drops his bag in his office, rolls his eyes at a memo someone has charmed to sparkle annoyingly, and makes his way for tea. His stomach barely flips when he sees Malfoy is at his desk, face scrunched in concentration as he writes furiously. Harry makes a plan: He’ll wave if Malfoy looks up, he’ll say hello if Malfoy does. That’s all.
“No, no. Let us guess. I love this game.” Seamus purses his lips. “Devon? In Mysteries? Ah, no, he’s too much of a—-unless?”
“Yes,” said Harry, “beginning with you getting out of those clothes.” He slid a hand up Draco’s shirt to his chest, then stood and pulled the shirt over Draco’s head. Draco let him, raising his arms. Harry kissed him; Draco wondered if he could taste himself in his mouth.
The loo is clear and Harry takes the opportunity to breathe. Big, round breaths like Hermione taught him. He’s fine. He’s in control of himself. He washes his face and makes his way back to his office.
Harry doesn’t think about the way Malfoy’s fringe has grown out so it just barely brushes his sharp cheekbones, or the fact that Malfoy wears muggle trousers, shirts, and waistcoats every day. He certainly does not appreciate how said trousers, shirts, and waistcoats are immaculately tailored to Malfoy’s slim frame and make him look like— Well, Harry doesn’t know what Malfoy looks like, because he doesn’t think about it.
“Good man, that Harry,” said Charlie. “To think of it, I don’t think Harry’s cock’s gotten much attention yet tonight. Do you like to suck cock, Draco?”
Standing in the doorway, white as a ghost, is Polly Nguyen. Her eyes are fixed on Harry’s. He can’t look away from her, very conscious of the amount of spit that’s accumulated around his mouth.
The nifflers were adorable; caring for them wasn’t difficult, besides the feedings every two hours, but Draco did most of those anyway. Harry found he liked having them around. At first, while they were still fragile, Draco took them with him to the clinic each day, hidden under Harry’s invisibility cloak in the passenger seat of his car. Within a couple of weeks, all nine little fluffs were pilfering Draco’s cufflinks and hoarding silverware in their pouches. They slept piled up in their makeshift burrow; Draco had charmed the walls of their nest to be like a one-way mirror so he could monitor them.
It’s Harry’s turn to shrug. “Dunno. You were so posh in school. I guess I never imagined you in a place like this, eating a toastie.”
Harry nods and rubs a hand over his face. “Yeah, you’re right. It’s just—” He cuts off with a sigh. Harry doesn't know what it is about Malfoy. He’s always been able to get under Harry’s skin, hasn’t he?
“I’m well, thanks, Fernando. How’s Lita, how’s the baby?” Harry smiled back just as broadly. “Erm, wait. Como--como es la bebe?”
“Well, you are quite thick, Potter,” Draco said without thinking. He bit his tongue. “It’s alright, though.”
Draco obeyed, backing his arse up against the bulge in Charlie’s trousers. He looked beautiful - flushed and wanting - and Harry kissed him eagerly. He cupped his hands around Draco’s neck, delved his tongue into Draco’s hot mouth, and Draco leaned into the kiss. He rocked against Charlie, and Harry pulled away to see Charlie’s freckled hand palming Draco’s cock through the thin fabric of his trousers. Harry unbuttoned Draco’s flies and Charlie withdrew Draco’s pink cock, already leaking.
He was scooping up a sizable portion of potatoes when Potter popped onto the grass. Several Weasleys ran to greet him, all exchanging hugs and kisses. Draco nodded to himself; he’d known Potter, as Teddy’s godfather, would be there but he’d hoped to avoid him.
Harry’s trying not to smile as he sits next to Draco. “You’ve taken all the cheese again, you prat.” He scoops some of the little cubes from Malfoy’s plate to his, then loads up with rice and daal.
They ate dinner on a restaurant patio that night, both of them craving sunlight after a day spent underground. They sat close, their shoulders touching. There was a new intimacy between them, like they had crossed some sort of threshold together in the vault. Draco let go of the urge to run; he wanted to stay.
Harry pulled out of Draco’s mouth. “Gonna come on your face, baby.” Draco kept his mouth open as Harry stroked himself once, twice, and then he was coming as well, thick ropes over Draco’s pretty cheeks. Draco lapped up the come he could reach with his tongue.
Harry nodded. “You were perfect, baby.” He pulled Draco to him, against his chest, and stroked his hair, his back, his arms. Charlie wrapped around them both, so warm against Draco’s back. He kissed the nape of Draco’s neck softly.
Harry’s wardrobe is a simple piece, light wood with two doors and small handles. Inside, it smells like cedar and more sandalwood and laundry soap and very, very Harry. Draco considers climbing in to hide all day in the safety of Harry’s clothes. Shaking his head, he sorts quickly through the bins to find one full of underwear. He feels a bit odd about it, but he shrinks a pair to fit his smaller hips and slides them on. There’s a little thrill that shoots through him knowing that he’s wearing Harry’s underwear, but he pushes aside the rush of arousal in favor of finding a top.
Please come around tomorrow for tea. Your cousin Teddy would love to meet you. Apparition coordinates enclosed.
He reached a hand underneath himself, balancing on one arm, but Charlie stopped him. “I told you I’d take care of you, baby boy.” Charlie smeared the rest of the lube in his palm along Draco’s length and stroked him gently, aware that he must be sensitive. He sped up his thrusts, snapping his hips against Draco’s arse, and Draco cried out as he came for a second time.
Fernando chuckled. “Close! You’re getting better. That’s like, what is she like, you know, as a person? You mean como esta.”
“It’s fine. Are you burnt?” Harry asks, laser focused on not looking at Malfoy sitting at his desk four feet away.
Charlie, dressed in jeans and a soft-looking sweater, hugged Harry as they said their hellos. He smelled divine, as always, like woods and fire. Harry took the offered bottle of Ogden’s and started toward the kitchen.
Harry guided him around by his hips until Draco was backed against the bed. He laid back and Harry followed him, pressing open-mouthed kisses down his chest, his cock bobbing against Draco’s trousers. Draco was almost painfully hard and pressed the heel of one hand against himself to get some relief. Harry took notice and went to work on Draco’s belt, biting one hipbone as he unbuttoned the fly. Draco gasped at the pain of the bite, but then Harry had a hand wrapped around him and his nerves were buzzing with electricity. Harry spread his precome around the head, wanking him with slow, tight movements, watching Draco’s face. Draco’s couldn’t look away from Harry’s broad fingers around his pink cock.
