“What are we going to do?” Harry asked after a few minutes of pacing. “We should probably send a report to the office and see if they’ve picked up any more leads while we’ve been out here. Or if there have been any more incidents.”
“Why can’t I have the steak?”
Draco peered at the neglected table, at Harry, to his tea and back to Harry. “Oh, alright.”
Harry’s eyes met Draco’s. Was that a small smile? Was Harry smiling at him?
Draco arrived at the pub at half past five with a large bag full of the decorations he had chosen. Amelia escorted him up to the room where the pub staff were setting up the tables.
He floo’d into the Ministry, took a lift to the Auror Office and was directed to Avalon’s desk by the receptionist. As he walked down the corridor, past other Aurors desks, he felt their eyes following him. He couldn’t really blame them given his history, but it still made him uncomfortable.
“I can tell you’re worried, but Harry will be fine. He’s brilliant at his job and he’ll be back before you know it.” The waiter came back with the bill and Hermione stood up. “I’ll take care of this. You had better get back to work yourself.”
“I could let you borrow my laptop. It has all the music on it and I suppose I can teach you how to use it if you want,” Harry offered. “It's not too hard.”
“Okay, so I don’t need
“Malfoy?” Potter said with surprise then whispered something to the others before Draco was in earshot. Whatever he said caused the other three to leave the office, which made Draco happy enough. He would much rather talk to Potter alone. It was easier to influence someone that way.
He couldn’t help but think that that had been Draco’s way of making the first move.
Draco was glad to hear Harry wasn't denying his lasciviousness.
"What would you know about what my father wanted me to be? I suppose you think he is guilty as charged?"
“Not to mention completely obvious. However, I am surprised it took you over two weeks. I guess Blaise won that bet.”
“Yes,” Draco said matter-of-factly. He watched as Madam Malkin took all the pieces of the uniform she’d cut to another room, then added a little defensively, “Not that it is any of your business, Potter.”
“Would you now?” said Draco, suggestively. “What’s in it for me?”
but the stupid courage won again. “Yes, with me. Maybe we could have lunch too.”
“Maybe if he can’t come home, I could go to him,” Draco thought out loud. “Where is he?”
“Why?”
It was then that he finally touched the throbbing erection before him, wrapped his fingers around the base and drawing a long exclamation from his lover. “Fuuck! Draco, please.”
“What? No new suggestion that I’ll be trying out for the Holly Harpies next season?” Draco quipped sardonically. Some idiotic reporter had tried that news angle last year using a photo of Draco in Quidditch robes and longer hair. Unfortunately for them, while Draco was certainly prettier than some of the Harpies line up, he was still missing a couple of essential features that would have seen him earn a place in England’s only all female quidditch team.
Draco seemed to take his silence as an admission of obliviousness and proceeded to lecture Harry on all the reasons why it shouldn’t have been so surprised. “You knew I was looking for a better job than working at that dingey little apothecary in Diagon Alley. And you
“No.”
Draco stopped and turned his head back to see Harry. "What do you want, Potter?"
Harry’s cheeks flashed red this time. “They weren't all my fault. Ron started it and a few times the Death Eaters didn't give us much choice. And I'd be damned if I was going to let them get away.”
Harry and Draco had been slowly becoming friends since the end of the war trials, which were a few years behind them now. They met every so often, discussing the state of the wizarding world as well as family, friends and various other random topics that caught their fancy. However, Draco had failed to make any mention about them becoming work colleagues when they had last seen each other, about a week before the new school term started.
“Yes, but that was different. It was with Mr Weasley and family, plus it was before he came of age, defeated Voldemort and became even more famous or started work.”
"Four times in the last two months. This is starting to become a habit, Potter."
“Can you help me refine my testimony?” Harry asked, directing his question back to Snape.
The next morning, there was still no words from Potter. Draco sent him an interdepartmental memo, asking whether he had found someone to organise the Christmas music for the party. He didn't have to wait long for a reply.
After mouthing, sucking and lick the second ball, Draco gently released Harry from his mouth and then sat up to reach behind him for the tube of lube he had summoned. He squeezed a generous amount onto his fingers and used his other hand to coax Harry’s hips higher so he had better access to his tight hole. Stroking his lube covered digits over the exposed anus, he elicited a gasp from his partner before Harry seemed to ease into Draco’s touch. He began to circle around the hole and then slowly inserted the tip of his finger. Repeating the actions, he moved his finger further into the hole each time, ensuring it slid in easily before adding a second.
“Helmp,” Harry mumbled.
It wasn't until Draco felt Harry’s hands on his hips, searching for the bottom of his shirt to be able to touch his bare skin as well, did he break their kiss and maneuver himself out of reach at the other end if the couch. Harry groaned and slumped back onto the armrest. Draco smirked at the reaction.
Draco strut into the kitchen, flicked his wand to silence the kettle and pulled out two mugs.
“Oh really?” She seemed genuinely surprised at that piece of information.
Draco furrowed his brow.
“I’ll try and be home before Christmas. I don’t want to miss spending it together any more than you do, but if I don’t investigate to solve this case, there could be more than that on the line.”
“Maybe. Especially if my dad keeps getting injured.” Albus laughed. “You know he was back there again a couple of days ago with third degree burns to his legs.”
Draco leaned down and kissed his gorgeous, green-eyed chosen one while seated deep inside him and drew a loose fist over the proud, exposed member. The moans that vibrated through his mouth told Draco he was close to bringing the other man to completion.
“No. Before today, I hadn't seen or spoken to him since the last Ministry charity event a few months ago. Why?”
“You may take your seat, Draco. Narcissa Malfoy, please stand,” the Chief Warlock continued. Narcissa had been charged with aiding and abetting and was found guilty, but would only serve two years community service with a three year good behaviour trace.
"I wasn't arguing, but if you like. Have you had your check up for dark spell residue yet?"
“Yes.” Amelia proceeded to state the pub’s name, something about dots and co then abruptly asked if he was okay.
Having finished casting the protective spells, Draco moved back in front of Harry. “Do I?” He ran his hand over the front of Harry’s jeans again. “I like this point,” he said, punctuating his words by lightly squeezing the top of Harry bulge while licking a line up Harry’s neck. This elicited a moan from Harry’s lips and Draco knew he finally had him on board.
Snape shook his head. Harry looked from one portrait to the other. Did they
“Oh, I think you’ll like this one.”
“That sounds awesome, Professor Malfoy. When can we start?”
"I didn't think there were that many notes worth taking," Hermione said as she spied over Harry's shoulder. He ignored her and kept writing. After a couple of minutes, Hermione added, "You know he's been staring at you for most of this lesson."
important or else they would have stayed.”
Draco shook his head. No. It had been business. He’d successfully coerced Potter into to helping him with the Muggle side of things for his department’s Christmas celebrations, nothing else.
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Harry went to tilt his head for a kiss, but Draco pulled back and looked at the clock on Harry’s bedside table. “How does your head feel?”
Harry sat back and crossed his arms. "I'm not having this argument with you. Can we get on with the meeting?"
Draco looked around and noticed a number of eyes on them. “Can we, er, discuss it somewhere a little more private?”
"Okay," Harry said. He took a deep breath and slowly stopped cradling his arm. As soon as it was fully released from his grip, he felt Draco's magic shoot into his shoulder and down his arm, then the pain. He heard a small pop and the pain was instantly gone. He made to move his shoulder but Draco stopped him with a hand grasping his upper arm.
Hermione walked out of the Leaky Caldron a few minutes after Draco arrived. She was wearing her usual business suit, minus the cloak. Draco had opted for similar attire; slim fitting black suit with a knee length overcoat to keep out the winter chill. They cut a sharp picture together, like a couple of high flying lawyers out to lunch.
Draco turned back towards the tree. He had finished twirling the various coloured tinsels around the tree and already placed about half the baubles in a semi-random pattern. And now, that the pub staff had gone, he could complete the decorating with magic. The first guests weren’t expected for half an hour.
“Not like I have a choice.” Harry’s gaze followed Draco’s hands as he unbuttoned his own shirt and discarded it before continuing on to his trousers.
Was he really interested or just being polite?
“You are when it comes to computers,” Potter stated matter-of-factly. Draco glared at him, but Potter didn’t seem fazed. “Don’t worry, there are a lot of Muggles who don’t know much about computers.”
“Hmm, maybe we can go to the library and find some reading material then?” Draco offered.
After their plates were taken away, Draco finally gave up and removed the small speaker from his ear. “Thank you, Potter. I can see you have a large selection of Christmas music that would be suitable for us to play at the party. There is only one problem. That’s
“You look rather pathetic, Potter,” Draco said as he placed his tray of tea on the table and sat in the chair next to Harry.
"I was not obsessed!"
He couldn't keep from putting his foot in it, could he. “I dunno. I guess I wouldn’t have been so surprised to see you here… at Hogwarts... in the staff room. Especially when I didn’t think I’d be seeing you for a couple of months.”
“Ha, you make it sound like you planned this.”
Harry heard the smirk before he saw it. He grinned back. He felt Draco's thumb caressing his own as they stood just looking at each other.
“The eighth,” Hermione answered.
Draco looked up from the list of food. Had Potter just called him a friend?
Draco felt a firm hand on his back and he was being drawn back into Harry, only this time their whole bodies touched. Harry’s other hand touched his shoulder, glided along it and up his neck to cup his jaw. Draco felt Harry’s hot breath between them and slowly raised his eyes to look into piercing green.
“There are always admirers out there, Hermione,” Harry shouted back.
"No…" Harry said, not sure if it was a trick question.
Madam Malkin returned with a navy blue fabric that looked like what may make up the lining of Harry’s Auror robes. She sat down again to sketch out the pattern from the measurements her tape gave her.
Harry flicked back a few pages to show Draco the photo of them outside Quality Quidditch Supplies looking through the window. “Apparently shopping for the perfect Christmas presents.”
Draco took the box from the air, undid the bow and carefully removed the lid. Inside was a single gold coin. He was both relieved and disappointed that it wasn’t a ring, but he supposed that would come with more time. He removed the coin from the box and then recognition struck. It was the same as the one Ron had shown him that Harry used to communicate check-in times.
“Oh, shut up Potter.”
“Well, the hero of the wizarding world couldn’t be left alone with a concussion on New Years Eve now, could he?”
“I am
A week went by with no news from Harry, or about Harry from the Auror Office. Hermione had promised that she and Ron had both verified his relationship with Harry and that they themselves hadn’t heard anything either. Hermione had added that Draco needed to be patient and that Ron had mentioned it wasn’t unusual not to hear anything back even after a week, especially for the more highly classified missions. The type of mission that like it seemed more and more likely Harry was currently on.
A love song? Draco looked up at Harry, who was finishing off his meal.
By the time Harry took out his own wand to vanish it, Draco was gone.
“I really shouldn’t be telling you any of this,” Ron said.
“Aah, I see. Good to know my advice helped.”
Working around the pulsating member, he licked down the side of Harry’s groin to find his sensitive inner thigh and pushed his legs apart to gain better access. Holding the other man’s knees, he explored with his mouth, enjoying the desperate sounds and involuntary twitches he was causing. Looking up at his partner, he was pleased to see the strong arms had stayed where he’d left them and it appeared as though Harry had been gripping the armrest to anchor himself during Draco’s assault.
“Didn’t think pathetic people were worth your time, Malfoy.”
“You look like you could use a drink. Did you want to go to a pub after my shift finishes in about half an hour?”
Harry's sudden appearance had made Draco's heart race. It slowed down now, and he loosened his tight grip around his wand. He took a deep breath, determined to sound as calm as possible. “You were late, Potter. I wasn’t about to stand around all day in the cold waiting for you to show up.”
"Yes you were."
"Oh," said Harry, his disappointment obvious.
“I think we should move somewhere less conspicuous.”
The young woman looked up and seemed surprised by the offer. “Err… do you know the man?”
Ron rolled his eyes and sighed. “Sure. Follow me.” He led Draco to what he presumed was a meeting room and closed the door behind them. Ron gestured for him to have a seat at the conference table and then sat down himself. “This is about Harry, isn’t it?”
Harry didn’t think the smile would leave his face any time soon. “You totally set this up, didn’t you?”
“You’re seriously asking me to spell it out for you?”
“Thought it would be a good idea to get here before the guests. Oh, and you probably want to do a better job of locking the door next time.” Harry smiled and Draco felt the urge to curse it off his face. “Shall I?” Harry asked.
I'll be waiting here
“Ah, good.” Draco had expected Potter to choose the chicken, but it was important that they checked the quality of the fish..
you are free to go whenever you're ready." And Draco went back through the curtains.
“Of course. But he’s likely not really going to love it?”
“So,” said Harry, “what’s next?”
“I’d like to enjoy my tea and biscuits in peace, like everybody else here.” Draco gestured to the five others scattered around the tea house. It was usually pretty quiet at eleven in the morning.
They waited in silence for a minute or so before Harry spoke again. “So, does this place meet whatever criteria you have?”
"Do you really believe…?" Hermione left her question unfinished as she followed Harry's line of sight to the Slytherin table, where Harry had found Draco in an animated discussion with a few second years. If he knew about the trial date, he wasn't letting on.
“Surprising delicious.”
“Really?” Eoin asked, a hint of excitement in his voice.
When Draco broke the kiss and pulled back to thrust again, Harry arched his back to meet it then lifted his other leg to rest on Draco’s shoulder as well, giving them both a better angle to thrust into. Draco held Harry’s legs to steady himself as he continued to move in and out of his partner’s tight hole, the pleasure building low in his balls.
He strung lines of silver, gold, red and blue tinsel across the ceiling and added holly wreaths around the candelabra centrepieces on the tables. He placed another wreath in the middle of the back wall and strung entwined holly leaves and pine branches from either side, continuing the draping of greenery along the side walls. Finally, he hung a small branch of mistletoe from the ceiling over the small area left open for mingling and possible dancing.
“I made a reservation at a restaurant a couple of blocks away,” she said and began walking down the busy street, full of Muggles.
Draco had formed a few good working relationships with some of the Muggle librarians who helped him with his research. He interacted with most often with the Muggles working for the Daily Telegraph and often gave them
“Unfortunately, her arse isn’t the stupid one I’ve had to cover for all year.”
“We’ll have plenty of time to discuss it over lunch.”
“What are those for?”
“You plan to investigate a magic matter in a Muggle town in your Auror robes?” Draco asked. His question made Harry look down at his attire. “You should probably take the robe off,” Draco suggested. “I presume you have some Muggle clothes underneath?”
“Pardon?” Avalon looked confused. “Harry who? And to what relation is he to you?”
“Do you know if Harry will be communicating with anyone in the Auror Office while he’s away? He didn’t mention owling me and I assume that won’t be practical, but can I at least get updates from the Office?” Draco thought getting updates about Harry being safe would help get through the time apart a little easier.
Draco gave a slight chuckle. “Everyone wants to catch the saviour of the wizarding world under the mistletoe for a snog.”
“Why are we out here?” Harry asked.
Harry let out the breath he didn’t know he had been holding and smiled with relief that his evidence had not gone unheard. He hoped this would help their friendship once they were back at Hogwarts. He saw Draco let out a sigh of relief too, but then seemed to remember his parents verdicts were still to come.
Draco’s hands itched to draw his wand, but a little voice in his head that sounded quite a lot like Harry’s told him that she was only doing her job and the Aurors Office would be a stupid place to curse someone.
“Lunch?” Harry was looking at him now, eyes searching. “Why?”
Harry must have been staring obviously as Draco and his company made their way to the counter because Ron glanced around to see them too. “Err… should we go back to the office?” Ron asked.
“You had better remember for next time,” Draco warned, then smirked and stepped into the circle of Harry’s arms. He’d missed being held and Harry cuddling up to him at night. He leant back enough to be able to kiss Harry. Feeling the heat and passion coming from Harry’s mouth was enough to make Draco hard. He needed to get Harry back home, and fast.
“I’m aware of that, Potter. No need to state the obvious.” Draco had become more and more irritated at his own lack of knowledge about the Muggle way of life as the day had gone on. He was sure Potter was using every opportunity he found to rub it in his face. Draco continued to remind himself that Harry had grown up as a Muggle and knew far less about the wizarding world than he did.
Ron just shrugged and continued drinking his tea.
“Oh, right,” Harry said, glad he didn’t have to explain but wondering what Draco had said to his son about him.
Draco took a deep breath and used all his restraint not the sneer at him again. It was nearly Christmas, after all. “Thank you, Potter, for pointing that out.” He tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but was not wholly successful.
“And yours is to protect the wizarding world, not expose it.”
"Believe it or not, I was worried about you and it's Christmas Eve. I thought you weren't coming home for Christmas, so I came to you instead."
Draco raised an eyebrow. Was this the last song Potter had listened to? He supposed it did have a rather catchy tune.
“Not so fast Potter,” Draco said through his teeth. “You owe me, remember.”
“You better solve it before Christmas Eve then,” Draco told him.
Harry seemed to accept that answer and even sat up to allow Draco better access to his shoulders and neck. With firm caressing movements, Draco slowly travelled his hands out to the ends of Harry’s shoulders and back to his neck where he changed to pressing circles into the tight muscles at the top of the spine. This caused Harry to tilt his head towards his chest, exposing more of his nape to Draco.
When he was finished, he stood by the door from where he could take in all his work as once.
The next thing Draco knew, he was standing in a dingy room, with a bed in one corner and a desk with a lamp against the side wall. He could feel the heat of a fire burning behind him. The grip on his arm released and he looked around to see Harry removing his invisibility cloak.
“So what, Potter?”
“We go and investigate, of course.”
“Seriously? And why do you need
“No, but I liked it that way.”
Harry was talking to the bartender and the bartender crocked his head towards Draco, saying something that made Harry laugh then shake his head. The bartender said something else which made Potter look back in his direction, but quickly turn away when he saw Draco’s attention was on them. There seemed to be another small exchange before the bartender poured red wine into two wine glasses.
“How did I do? Did they believe me?” Draco asked, laughing, once Harry was walking beside him again.
Draco sauntered over and captured Harry’s mouth in a slow sensual kiss. It drew a moan from Harry and that was all the encouragement Draco needed for his hand to start wandering inside Harry’s robe and down to his waist. Draco waited until he could feel Harry’s cock beginning to stiffen against his thigh before pulling away slightly to allow his hand to continue downward. He rubbed the cloth over Harry’s member until it was rock hard and Harry was biting at his lips with want.
“Definitely complaining,” Draco declared. He thought both answers were probably accurate if he was truthful, but he wasn’t about to admit that to Granger. “I would have thought you’d given them a lecture about it by now.”
. He remembered the laughter Harry had shared with the bartender when he had ordered the meals. Had the bartender thought they were on a date as well? Was that what Potter had been laughing at?
“It’s not
“And this is Draco,” Harry added.
“Might have been his day off. He won’t like missing the opportunity though. He keeps telling me healing burns was one of the first things he wanted to master when he was doing his training.” There was a small pause before Scorpius continued.
With all those returning to Hogwarts for their official Seventh Year being put in the same N.E.W.Ts classes and Draco choosing much of the same subjects as Harry, Draco quickly became civil with Harry. However, at times, Harry couldn't help but feel like there was something more behind Draco's behaviour. As if he was really trying to be his friend. Harry tried to encourage Draco's friendly behaviour, striking up conversations in class when an opportunity arose and even sitting with him in the library to do homework.
As he progressed in preparing Harry, Draco leant down to capture his lover’s lips and was overwhelmed by the passionate force behind the kiss. It made him yearn to be thrusting inside Harry as he was snogging him for everything that he was worth. Draco wanted to have his dick where his fingers currently were and there was only one way to make that happen.
“Hey Granger, have you spoken to Potter recently?”
“No, not for another week. And if Lionel isn’t better tomorrow, I’ll be sending Mother to check on him and make sure he is well enough for Saturday.”
Harry had watched Draco enter the tea house from his usual spot, tucked away at a table in the back, close to the counter and opposite the door. With his back to the wall, he had a full view of the people passing by the front window and those entering the door. This was where he came when he needed a break from the office.
At the start of the school year McGonagall had surprised Harry when she’d announced to all the teachers that the new Potions Master would be none other than Draco Malfoy.
“Can’t I give you a massage without having an ulterior motive?” Draco asked.
He smiled as he looked back at Harry. “Thank you.”
“Don’t think I haven’t. Doesn’t take very long for them to forget it though.” She sighed.
“Come on, you can’t tell me your behaviour isn’t somewhat out of the ordinary.”
“You can’t be serious,” Draco protested.
“What are you doing, Potter?”
“I think he’s lonely since my mother passed away. It would be good if he had your dad, aunt and uncle as friends. He needs someone to talk to besides me.”
Snape’s portrait ignored Dumbledore’s. “What about young Mr Malfoy?”
Harry didn't respond. It was a little too close to the truth. For whatever reason, he'd always found some enjoyment in watching Draco and was intrigued by how he did things. Plus, he had a bloody good reputation as a Healer. He supposed having known him since he found out he was a wizard also added to the level of comfort he felt. It had nothing to do with the fact that he harboured feelings for the pompous git.
"I ran into an Incendio from a hidden target," Harry replied.
Draco glared at her. Hermione ignored it and continued to eat her slice of sourdough. Their main meals came and they ate in silence as Draco pondered about a sentimental gift for Harry. When they had finished, Hermione asked, “Was there anything else you wanted to know before I go back to work?”
“No, not okay.”
There were three loud pops and sparks flew into the air from different sides of the room. There was another series of pops and a fireworks rainbow appeared beside one wall. Another pop and there was a pot of gold at the base from which a fireworks leprechaun sprung out and started leaping around the room above everyone’s heads.
Without saying a word, Draco moved up to the bedside table and handed Harry his glasses. "Thanks," Harry said automatically.
“Of course I’ll be playing seeker,” Draco answered. “And before you ask, someone gave them an anonymous tip about my talents so they sent me an owl to offer me a private tryout session.”
“He is brewing a complex antidote for a particularly rare poison and has asked not to be disturbed.”
“Don’t be sorry. It was a mutual decision.”
Draco obliged, almost on instinct moving to the same platform he’d stood on as a child. As soon as he was settled a measuring tape shot to his side from a shelf at the back of the room and started taking his measurements of its own accord.
Draco cut him off. “Just because we’re friends now, doesn’t mean I have to tell you everything that goes on in my life. I am allowed some privacy, you know. I thought you of all people would understand that.”
Draco surveyed the room. The tables were adorned with red and green checkered tablecloths, silver cutlery, white plates, alternating red and green napkins and an assortment of glasses at each place. A small black candelabra with silver candles sat as the centrepiece on each table. Not bad for Muggles, Draco thought. Out loud, he said, “You’ve done quite an apt job, thank you. I think I shall be fine to finish decorating the tree by myself.”
Draco finished making up the small pot of tea and turned in Harry’s arms, lacing his hands at the small of Harry's back. “One thing I’ll never understand about you is your reluctance to be promoted.” He leant in to place a quick kiss on Harry’s lips.
Draco wondered why Potter had actually agreed to help him. Sure, he wouldn’t have taken no for an answer but Draco had expected more of a fight. Harry was not usually one to come quietly, but for the most part he had. Maybe Granger had forewarned him and he was doing this as a favour to her? No, he’d been too surprised when Draco had told him about the task. He doubted Potter was
by myself within a week,” Draco said.
“Never a dull moment with you, is there, Potter?”
“I don’t know. Did you ask him?”
“Yes, in case there is something… something I don’t know,” Draco admitted.
about his feelings for Draco? How could they when Harry had only recently discovered them himself? But he was relatively certain that's what Dumbledore was alluding to. He would have to ask them about it another time when there weren't more pressing issues.
"What? Did you use up all that Gryffindor bravery waiting for me?" A smirk grew on Draco's face.
“I’ll get another one off Hermione for my next mission away.”
Ron rolled his eyes. “Sure, mate. Whatever you want.”
Draco moved his kisses down to Harry’s jaw and neck, stopping to suck and lick at the tantalising hollow areas, all of which didn’t fail to draw appreciative sounds from Harry’s lips. As much as Draco loved to hear the sounds and breathless words coming from Harry’s mouth, he didn’t want to blow their cover any more than Harry did. So he took a moment to add a Silencing Charm to the protective spells around them.
“Oh come on. You grew up as a Muggle.”
“Minerva always was a good sport,” Dumbledore commented.
Draco followed her to a classy establishment where they were promptly shown to their table, given the menu and ordered drinks. Once the waiter had left, Hermione got straight to the point. “I gather you asked me to lunch so you could pry some answers out of me regarding Harry.”
“But she was a Huffle-hey!” Harry had kicked him harder this time and Draco had almost spilt his tea. He was about to berate his partner when recognised the stern look in his eyes. He bowed his head. “Sorry.”
“With my protective spells around us, we’re as good as being in your office at the Ministry. And we’ll still have my wand to alert us if anything occurs around the shed.”
“Right about what?”
“Hello, Mr Potter. What did you want to speak to me about?”
“And?” Draco said impatiently.
“You think I enjoy the rumours flying around about us? What would your father think?” Harry regretted the question as soon as it flew off his tongue.
So Potter would be at the party after all. Was Draco surprised? Not really.
Draco felt a relief wash over him that he hadn’t expected to be so strong after just that small confirmation that Harry was alive and well. He picked up the coin to examine it and saw that the next check in was for tomorrow morning, Christmas Eve.
“Although, I suppose your idea would be worth a try,” Draco mused aloud and grazed his lips over Harry’s neck, before licking a line up to his ear and nibbling softly on his earlobe.
Draco,
“I just can’t, okay?”
As Draco concentrated his kissing on Harry’s lower abdomen, he used his left hand to caress down to hip and thighs, which was met by soft moans. Deliberately avoiding the bulging length in Harry’s trousers, he undid the button and kissed his way along the trouser line to suck at his hip then licked a line across to the other side, with Harry letting out a small gasp as he crossed the middle of his waist. “Care to tell me anything?” Draco asked into Harry’s left hip and looked up at Harry’s face.
“Sorry,” Harry said. “I know you guys wouldn’t tell my secrets to anyone… but you’re the only ones that know. And if someone else had figured it out, surely it would be in The Prophet or something.”
"Of course it's not going to take long," Ron said. "They're all guilty as sin."
“But he enjoyed being in the box for the World Cup in our school years.”
“I find that hard to believe. Why are we here then?” Draco asked.
“The fresh air will do you good.” Harry didn’t believe him, but he wasn’t going to complain about enjoying the view with Draco.
“He’s due for his break in about an hour.”
Potter shrugged. “I wouldn't object to finding you as a present under my Christmas tree.”
As Harry finished the rest of his tea, he caught Draco looking his way three more times. Why did he keep looking at him? Who was the wizard he was having tea with? More questions he didn’t have the answers to floated through his head, one after the other. He needed to get away from Malfoy before he went crazy and did something he’d regret.
organise a non-magical Christmas party for my department to which we will be inviting Muggle reporters and librarians.”
Draco turned back to the half decorated Christmas tree and his bag of ornaments. He enchanted them as he had practiced in the Manor. The tree was finished in a few short minutes. Even the lights had been untangled. Draco turned his attention to the rest of the room.
Harry just glared at the blonde man in front of him as he poured the freshly brewed tea from it’s pot into the cup, added milk, and took a deliberately slow sip.
“Do you really think so? She was rather quick to tell me this was
“Yes. I should have the rest covered.” Draco put his coat on, along with his scarf and gloves, as Harry did the same. Then Potter followed him through the pub crowd to the door and out onto the street.
He had been so excited about going to Hogwarts that he’d babbled on and on. Harry had barely gotten a word in and Draco had barely noticed his odd responses. He had been determined to befriend the great Harry Potter on the train and was heartbroken when he realised Weasley had gotten there first.
“What’s the issue, Potter?” Apart from how absurd it sounded to ask Harry Potter to have dinner with him.
“Fine. I can take a hint.” Draco moved his seat back from the table and stood, lifted his tray and moved to an empty spot a few tables across. Harry regretted it immediately.
“Sure, love.” She leaned down and kissed him quick, grabbed her wand from the nightstand, and spun on her heel.
Harry thrust once more deep into her, and came. Twisting his face, he moaned soft and low and Ginny kissed the square of his stubbled jaw as he buried his cum face in her neck. She wanted to chuckle, but didn’t want Harry to misunderstand.
She rubbed the side of her forehead discreetly, so as to not draw Harry’s attention to her inner self-berating fest over his shoulder that she was trying to silently wrestle and mask before he turned around.
The Burrow
“Perc’s being kind of an ass,” George shot Ginny a glance and a corner-mouth smile. “I know.”
“Yeah, Gin, if that’s alright. That was great! But you’re right, I just—” Harry cut himself off. “I am tired.”
“Oh, shit, yeah. You’re brill.” Harry said, leaning onto his side without pulling out to make room for her.
George stopped himself, gripped the door handle. He was mad at it. If he could just sink into the floorboards.
She swallowed her pride in a hard, dry lump that stuck and stuck on the way down as she leaned in to kiss Harry on his cheek, startling him into looking right at her.
“He deserved a shove, is what he deserved,” George mumbled, sort of. And Ginny laughed loud and a little jeering in agreement with that.
“I thought I’d— I thought I’d hurt you.” Harry reached for her face and curled a strand of her bangs, curving along her chin, around his finger. It kind of hurt when it pulled at the end. Ginny looked back at Harry and he searched her face for the right next words. “I don’t want to be afraid to touch you, Gin. You—“ He stopped himself to think for several seconds.
Ginny could hardly keep quiet, but she knew there may not be much time before someone thudded upstairs or Ron tore through the door to the bedroom.
They definitely would not approve of Ginny’s smoking habits. Ginny saw George smoking cigarettes out her window, out far from the house where he thought no one could see. A few nights later, after a quidditch scrimmage with George, he pulled out a pack of muggle cigarettes from the front pocket of his Weird Sisters hoodie. And after reaching into his back pocket, he had in his hand a faded white BIC lighter that had four-leaf clovers patterned across it. Ginny had asked for a cigarette, and George obliged, tossing her the pack. Ginny liked the taste enough, but more than anything she liked the way they felt in her lungs and between her teeth as she shoved her hands in her pant pockets and the way it hung from her sticky lips. It was something to do with her hands.
When she did this, Harry kissed her. The hand that had been near her face slid to cup the back of her neck and his other hand moved slowly across her body, searching for the headboard.
She trailed off, watching him. Her fists were full of regret. His eyes were full of it. If Harry was angry before, he wasn’t anymore. He was waiting for her to go on.
She opened her mouth to respond.
Ginny came through the door and saw them both standing around like they were talking about something awfully interesting and important – that is, until Ginny and George came in. Ron and Harry were quiet. Without slowing, but not in any rush, Ginny took notice of her boyfriend and his cold shoulders and continued into the kitchen toward the cupboard with the cups.
Harry loved it when she did that – put both her hands on his cock.
) older brother. Plus, her family loved Harry, including George. If anything, he’d make the whole situation terribly embarrassing for her. She had to keep her family out of it, out of her relationship with Harry, Ginny thought –
George smiled, and it reached his eyes.
“Help me up?” Ginny asked.
Harry didn’t move to dress for a few moments, but then he realized Ginny had taken the lock with her when she went.
“Yeah,” Harry said, smiling. He understood. He thrust back and forth again, slowly at first, and then Ginny could feel herself about come.
” the words tumbled out of Harry.
He crept down the couple of steps and down the dirt path, his worn blue canvas trainers and his dark jeans made him almost disappear to himself as he watched his feet, treading lightly, walk steadily along the path, deeper into the garden and farther from the house. He could hear his breath and distant voices around the sides of the house. And then he heard her. Just the beginning of a sob, he thinks, but it was so quiet and so short and so swiftly snuffed out by the crook of her long-sleeve shirt as she pressed her face into her arm. But he could be wrong, George thought. George could see her more clearly now; just the littlest bit of light that was left caught on the soft pink of her knitted sweater. Gin was crouched, but firmly planted on the ground, her elbows on her knees and her fists balled up in her thick hair she could hardly hide in the dark. Several strands of it were still clinging to the rose bush, caught on the thorns on her way down to the soft garden floor. He approached her and knew she could hear him.
“What now then?” There is irritation in Ron’s voice but also a sign of resignation. As if he has no other choice than to accept the fact that his best mate might possibly be bonded to their childhood nemesis.
As they both get up to move towards the couch the still completely filled table with untouched dishes is cleared in a blink. Draco didn’t even hear the pop of Kreacher coming in and out of the room. He dishes the thought out in favour of taking his seat back on the couch in front of Potter’s. Then he waits even though his patience is running low tonight as Potter drags him to the end of his sanity with his cruel push and pull.
“I take it that you have realized who the wolf was”, Draco is brought out of his thoughts by the sudden voice.
After a few more kicks to his stomach, which harry tries to protect himself from by curving into a ball, they leave him battered and crying on the floor.
The question, however, is if Harry is ready to tell everything to the other.
“So” Ron pulls the 'o' unnecessarily long and Harry is not sure what it implies but has no time to linger on it much as the ginger head continues with “you mean to tell us that you marked Malfoy. Malfoy, of all the people! How can you even mark on someone?”
"Will you stop interrupting me? I am trying okay. And for your kind information, I am not stalling. Just like you said, there has been no record in history so I don't know how to explain something that has no explanation. Whatever I am gonna say is based on assumptions. It's all a theory. It's working for me and for moments like these when I have to explain it to someone else. But still it’s a theory not a fact."
“Are you sure about what you said last time?” Harry gives up the stupid staring competition first and moves on to more important matters at hand.
The vague answer though does nothing to satisfy Draco's desire to get his answers. He had thought about it hard - why was he so intrigued by Potter's animagus form. At first he had thought about it being something he had to know as he was directly involved in it. Being marked by an animagus wolf and that too Potter was something Draco had not imagined even in his wildest dreams.
"Ok. I am leaving then." Draco starts to get up. There is a thought in the back of his head that he is being too dramatic but also that he is escaping like a coward, not ready to admit he is feeling things in the presence of Potter that he had buried deep within him.
(See the end of the chapter for
The whole ordeal was even more painful because of the way Harry bloody Potter made it so awkward. He wouldn’t look at Draco, even while asking questions - which was such a rude gesture and Draco wanted to give him a lecture on common etiquette but somehow managed to held it all in.
It is not unheard of wizards and witches having a patronus and animagus form different but it is extremely rare. But trust Potter to be the one doing the unthinkable - rarity being his middle name.
“Dinner is ready.” Kreacher informs before disappearing with a pop. Since when did Malfoy become his Master too? Harry really needs to have a talk with Kreacher.
The gravity of the situation finally settles on him and nothing comes up in his mind on how to protect himself against this sudden danger.
Is this the same person? Probably not. He knows Malfoy has changed a lot. Harry has been a witness to it a lot of times. But still, can someone change completely?
“Okay.”
“I -”, he starts only to stop when Malfoy drops an empty vial on the floor next to his desk, by accident or on purpose harry is not sure. Maybe the healer was telling Harry to get out without spelling it.
“Oh my god!!! WAIT!!Are you blushing, HARRY POTTER!”
Draco wants to bloody punch the other to get the words out of him. He is fisting his wand tightly in his right. His left hand is clutching the back of a chair in a death grip. He is sure he would be throwing punches if he does not busy his hands.
"But maybe this situation. Whatever it is with this neighbour. These unchecked feelings you are having and these interactions. Maybe you can channel it all into your writing. I mean from a 3rd person pov, this all sounds very cheesy and romantic to me so maybe this will work."
When Malfoy just sighs in annoyance and does not say anything, only shaking his head in negation, Harry deems it as an acceptance to continue.
“Wait- what? You told him about this first? Before even us?”
Draco peels himself away from Potter as if scorched. Potter, on the other hand, is staring wide eyed at the patronus that has just stopped in front of him after circling around them twice.
As his eyes adjust to the darkness, Draco finally realizes where he is.
After what feels like hours to Draco's alcohol hazed mind but only minutes according to the giant clock on the wall, Potter finally turns towards him with determination written all over his face and eyes trained on him without blinking. Draco sits up more stiffly. Anticipation runs unchecked throughout his body and leaves a tingling feeling on the tips of his fingers.
Clearing his throat to get the other’s attention Draco asks Potter about what he wanted to talk about in a voice that masks his curiosity very well.
The wolf, Draco is still in shock at its appearance out of nowhere, is growling like he is ready to peel the head off of the vampire.
To top it off Draco is unable to look away from Potter. If what he experienced earlier was just a glimpse of power that resides within him then how in abundance it would be for him to be able to have an animagi form of such caliber.
“Can I talk to you for a second?” When Draco looks up expectantly he adds on “in private”.
The scent of potions and disinfectants peculiar to only one known place fills his senses and Draco knows where he is even before he has opened his eyes; even before his full consciousness returns back to him. This is the place he practically lives in and even if he is not particularly thrilled to have a role reversal, he is assured enough by the fact that he came out alive from last night’s turn of events.
However, a second later she gets all serious and grabs Harry's hands that were placed on the table.
“What kind of books have you been reading? There is no bond between us, Potter. Contrary to what you might believe or know, a bond requires two willing parties. Both the people involved need to be aware of the bond taking place within them. That’s why its effects are so strong and visible. A marking, however, works differently and is exclusive to only non humans. But in that too an animagus marking is something that is never heard of which is why I wanted to know about your animagus form more. To figure out what is that I am dealing with.” Draco eyes Potter meaningfully before spitting “So if you don’t mind please get on with it.” The ‘please’ is said in a very disdainful voice that has Potter wincing but Draco does not care. If Potter is gonna behave like a prat so will he.
Also my Instagram is gone (yeah I deleted it but if you wanna talk my twitter is a welcomed place. Link is in the note at the end.)
That does not mean though he is enjoying any of this. Far from it actually. Harry knows Ron has some unresolved enmity with Draco. Before sometime ago, even Harry felt the same. Everything is changed now however.
But the sound of footsteps next are loud and clear enough for Draco to get his senses back and prepare for the worst. Nobody would be roaming the forbidden forest so late(he doesn't know but calculating from how he left St. Mungo’s at around 10 and the ache in the back of his head is not very strong..it must be past midnight now) just for a leisure stroll.
“You forgot. Didn’t you?”
Harry never thought a day would come when Hermione would ask him to get help from Malfoy instead of her but maybe there is always a first time for everything.
"He died the next day obviously. You know that right but don't you?" Harry was confused that day when Ron had told him about it. Why Malfoy would ask the obvious question, Harry had thought to himself then. He was the healer on the case. He must know what happened.
Harry has stopped pacing and is now looking straight at Malfoy who is not backing away as well. It is like Hogwarts all over again. There feels to be like a challenge in their gazes when there is anything but that. They both have been dramatic when it came to interacting with each other anyways - something that Hermione has told harry repeatedly since their schooldays.
“Harry, what a surprise? I didn’t know you were visiting. Are you here for the case?” Draco can already see the Cheshire expression on her face. She clearly knows Potter was not here on auror duty. She would have known of Harry arrival then.
“What?”
“What?” The healer asks once he has regained his senses and is able to formulate a coherent albeit inquisitive response.
“Don’t touch me, you Satan. You are worst than them.”
“They were definitely not the wards.” Harry is not sure why Malfoy looks so comfortable with what just happened. The moment their feet had touched the floor inside Grimmauld place, a strong wave of magic had washed over them. Sometimes wards do that when a person is allowed access. But Harry had planted the wards outside the house and they already went past them. So what just happened was something beyond his thought process.
And Padma just stares at him. First in slight annoyance which completely morphs into one of surprise once she studies Draco carefully.
And Draco has no idea what she is on for a minute and then he is gasping in realization.
And that has left harry moping around and making a fool of him in front of girls he has never even talked to before.
Malfoy looks relieved to hear that as if he was hyper aware of the fact that now nobody would jump him out of nowhere and almost kill him in the process. But harry knows it's much more than about his own safety. Malfoy was way more involved in this case. Harry had seen with his own eyes how spent the healer looked every time a victim died on the hospital bed. It is almost hard for Harry to believe that Malfoy would be worried about others. But people change. And the relief that showed on his face had more to do with 'now nobody would die on my watch' than 'now I wouldn't die on the hands of that monster'.
“Did you told him though?” she asks suddenly and harry is confused about what and he asks her that in response. Ron is just looking at them both uninterested.
It has been more than an hour since Harry came back and he is still thinking about what Ginny had said.
She never even asked the reason behind Harry’s non appearance and he is grateful for that.
Auror Harry and Draco who don’t see eye to eye; has never really since that first time they talked on the stairs outside the great hall in first year; quite surprisingly work well together as a team.
Since childhood he has been bullied by his cousin Dudley. The bullying when turned into shoves and punches, Harry has long forgotten.
Goblet of fire au
The beep of the monitor, indicating Draco is awake, diverts the healer’s attention and she looks up at him with a slow smile. Before she could utter anything though, the doors to his ward are thrown open and in walks Ron Weasley, out of all the people.
“Yeah. Ofcourse” Ginny snorts loud and carefree.
Harry is an orphan living with his aunt’s family. His parents died in a car accident and a very reluctant Petunia had to take him in when he was just a babe.
“Potter, contrary to what you might think I don’t have the whole day to just stand here and watch you pace left and right pathetically.”
When Harry had owled Malfoy to meet, the other had replied almost instantly to floo to his office which was very convenient for him too. If, and to be honest it will surely happen so when, they both end up hexing each other then it will be highly fortunate to be just steps away from the Spell Damage ward to be able to get treated immediately.
Draco is relieved to finally be discharged. He has never liked being holed up in one room, lying in a bed with nothing better to do. If possible he would in fact like to start on his shift right away if Head Healer Claire will let him.
Harry breathes out a short sigh and thinks it's better to just tell everything in one go or he would never be able to. His brain would keep distracting him otherwise.
“Professor Lupin, as you were already aware was cursed with Lycanthropy, would turn every full moon into a beast. And his friends hated to see him alone at that moment. So as a way to support him, they all became…” Harry pauses to take a deep breath because he is aware how his next words would bare his secret to Malfoy.
Before he could comprehend what was happening, a wolf, bigger than anything he has ever seen, with fur the colour of midnight jumps in air and crashes hard into the vampire who has gone stiff at the sudden intrusion.
want to faint once again out of nerves in front of the git.
Just as he is about to leave the building, someone pushes him hard from behind and before Harry had the time to turn around or get back up he is dragged into dark brooms closet. His attackers don’t give him even a second and starts punching him like a bean bag. Although his glasses had fell outside when he was pushed, he can recognise those curses and those grunts and those punches blindfold. Its dudley and his friends. Harry tries to struggle free first few minutes but eventually gives up, knowing fully well that rebutting will result in more bruises and more punches. One particular hard kick to his ribs have him screaming in pain and almost immediately a hand presses on his mouth cutting his air supply. He is thrashing real hard. Blind and breathless in a compact space with pain shooting up every vein of his body. And when the hand finally falls off, he didn’t even get to take a breath when a hard punch lands on his lower jaw. A big bruise already blooming there, his lip split open and a wetness at the corner of his lips that surely is blood if the iron taste in his mouth is any indication.
Harry chances a glance around the room and realizes with a start that the house does feel more alive today - if that's even possible for a house to achieve. The room appears to be more lit and the permanent layer of dust covering the furniture seems to have vanished in a blink of an eye. The house even smells nicer - not hot, damp and suffocating like it usually does. Not only the house but even his oh-so-great companion of a house elf was acting strange since he told him about Malfoy coming over for dinner. Harry has never seen that look of pure joy on the battered elf's face ever. He looked weirdly human with that emotion on him.
“How goddamn long is your story, Potter?”
A snarky remark - something like ‘thank god you knew a less damaging spell’ - is just on the tip of his tongue when the red-haired next words stun him to silence.
I am so sorry that it took me ages to get this out and unfortunately there is still more left which, if stars will allow me to, I'll post soon.
“You seem different today, Harry.”
He didn't want to do it. However, when the creative head had shown him the amount of fanmails they received requesting for the spin off of this particular couple; Harry had felt obliged and mostly touched. He had agreed a week later to write this spin off.
With a startle, Harry discovers that he has been ready to tell Malfoy everything since before his beast even marked the other. He had already put his trust in him. Maybe that’s why his wolf deemed him as a mate.
“rose petals falling from the sky, music in the air and-”
The black marble flooring of the Auror department of DMLE never fails to make Harry anxious. Ron has never understood the deal with it. “It's just the flooring, Harry”. He has said many a time but the reflection and the curt clicks of boot on the marble floor winds Harry up the wall.
“Since when did Malfoy become Draco to you?”
At Draco’s nod of approval Harry takes a step closer but almost immediately turns right to stand in front of a book shelf. He is suddenly tense once again.
So the result is this quick update. Don't expect much though. There will probably be one more chapter and an epilogue but when..i am not sure.
Sighing and seeing no other option along with intending the warmth to be gone, Draco takes his seat again. And finally, Potter lets go of his hand. A redness appears on Draco's pale skin and it takes more than a minute for him to peel his eyes away from the contrast. It does not hurt. The warmth though is like travelling throughout his body from that point of contact.
“Did you feel that?” Harry is the one to ask that. Not exactly looking at Malfoy but to his surrounding worried that someone would jump them from somewhere in a flash.
Now, Harry just wanted to talk to her, and Ginny was thinking it’d be better if they didn’t, but she also couldn’t exactly see a way out of the kitchen without Harry trailing close behind her. She resigned.
Ginny thought, running a hand through her hair.
Thank you guys so much for reading!! I'm excited for the pace to pick up, and it will once they get back to school. Some things are resolved this chapter, and chapter three is for hetero steam. It's ~important for character development~. hehe. Hope you enjoy.
When they reached the room, Harry strode to his twin bed and sad down on it in the middle, his knees coming up above hips as he sunk into the old mattress. There was a window behind the low headboard of his bed, and through the window, Ginny could see the tops of the trees in the garden as she came all the way into the bedroom.
It’s the same routine. Harry has to stay back for a detention, a detention he got because dudley locked him in the loo and by the time cleaning staff got him out he was already late for his class.
“Well, that’s tragic.”
.  As time passed though, while Potter left most of his questions unanswered, the curiosity to know something that had never happened before; something that Draco was unaware of peaks everything else. There is a reason why he was a slytherin - it was not all about his blood status or his family name. It had a lot to do about how Draco was always so curious to know about things. Sometimes those things didn't even concern him and sometimes they led him into dangerous situations. But seeking knowledge has always been like second nature to Draco.
Even neville has got the date and here is Harry.
There is so much history between them two that Harry fears that will there ever be something peaceful between them.
Draco cannot imagine looking at all those bodies and not just looking but finding them first prior to when they were attacked. The saviour in Potter must have gone crazy at the idea of not being able to save all those people in time.
He is brought out of his thoughts by a ting of his phone signalling a message and he just smiles at all the exclamations and caps lock in Ginny's message about how she forgot to tell him about a new editor in chief who just joined their publication house.
Draco looks at Potter and realizes the other is looking back at him with a weird expression. And what is this? Is that a smile? Is potter smiling at him? His smile suddenly broadens into a grin and it confuses Draco until he realizes that he himself is smiling back at Potter.
He is in the out. He can tell from the cold, the wind rustling around, and the muddy ground below him.
“Did he just-”
Harry feels it the moment Malfoy spreads privacy charm back in its place. It is strange to feel someone else’ magic and the shiver that runs down Harry’s body makes every strand of hair on his body stand in awakening.
Draco stands there frozen on his spot. His hand, which was outstretched,  now stands halted in midair not knowing whether to go further and comfort the other like he planned to or retrieve it by his side completely.
Draco is surprised - to say the least - by the proposal Potter just extended to him. He had never thought that a day like this would ever come when Potter willingly allows Draco in his head. However, there is a first time for all the things considering how he ended up at 12 Grimmauld place having dinner with the saviour of the wizarding world, who also happens to have marked on Draco in a weird turn of events.
Draco has to know. No matter how much Harry does not wish to tell.
"No. I mean no there was no one else. He was practicing the dark arts and we still don't know how but he managed to create a spell to turn into a vampire. But his theory backfired. Vampires are dead creatures. He was not going to live longer anyhow. The fool not only killed himself but other innocent people too. Healer Claire was able to extract the reservoir magic he used to cast the spell from his wand. We also got his signature. We are tracking it. So in case someone else got their hands on this spell and tries to cast it we will be notified immediately."
“Huh”, very eloquent. Maybe Potter is rubbing off on him, the healer thinks to himself.
"I met Weasley few days ago." Harry almost swallows the drink through the wrong pipe on hearing Malfoy talk about meeting his best mate out of blue.
“Cousin. I know.” Harry interrupts Malfoy with a tone of finality. The other takes the hint and does not say anything else.
But not so easily and not here, Harry thinks to himself. He asks Malfoy to go home and rest; that he will meet him soon to explain everything. And without another word, leaves the fuming blonde male behind as he sauntered past him and towards the floo channel.
It is not easy to suddenly trust your childhood nemesis. To tell them things he has closely guarded all his life. To tell them things about him that only people extremely close to him knows.
Draco knows he is staring which is making the savior fidget in his place but Draco cannot help but stare. He can still feel the pulse of magic - Potter’s magic that barely touched him but shriveled him up.
There is complete silence for a minute or so. Draco just waits patiently. He is not sure what he wants to hear or if he is ready for it even. He has an inkling though. Maybe a curse. It could not be a bite; he would have known then - not just as a healer in the hospital but it wouldn’t have been hidden from the press for long. And a bite in seventy percent cases does not transmit the lycanthropy and in the remaining cases only thirty percent gets the ability or curse - however one looks at it - to be able to shift.
“I am willing to put you out of your misery. Meet me outside ballroom sharp at 7. And don’t be late. And for god’s sake try and look presentable for once.”
The sudden voice of the said man startles Draco out of his thoughts.
Trust Malfoy to be a dramatic arse in any situation that presents itself. Harry just rolls his eyes in exaggeration and when the healer tries to leave, with a silent swish of his wand, he locks the door and brings up privacy charms strong enough for a ministry meeting.
Even if the answer was not too unexpected like he thought it would be, it was still not easy to accept especially because of how it changes the whole equation. Lot of things that didn’t make sense earlier now does. Other things that he thought were simpler became ten folds complex instantly with this big reveal.
Kreacher is in the house; Harry is sure if all the clattering voices are any indication but where exactly only god knows. Every time Harry heard noises from the kitchen and went in to check in case the elf had the kitchen on fire, he only found groceries and utensils lying around in a mess. There were still sounds coming from somewhere, somewhere underground if Harry tried to listen carefully but no sign of the old elf anywhere. And that's the second thing that annoys Harry - there are still places that he has not been able to explore in Grimmauld place. Mostly because he worried about what dark artifact he will acquire. It was a torture trying to throw away all the weird looking and dangerous antiques that littered around the Black house. The first of which were the horrendous looking house-elf's heads lining the staircase. Hermione had taken immense pleasure in getting them off the wall. Kreacher had whined, complained, thrown a tantrum along with the portrait of Walburga Black who wouldn't stop screaming profanities at him. At last Harry had hired an expert to take that bloody old hag off the wall. If given the choice, he would have loved to throw her under the bus, something that he never said out loud in front of kreacher as the elf was still giving him the silent treatment along with burnt toast for breakfast, lunch and Dinner. It's only natural; Harry had survived those few months of cleaning the house of dark magic on pizza and takeout. But that still had not made Harry change his mind on incinerating the wretched portrait. It was hermione, however, who suggested locking the portrait of Lady Black in the attic with a dozen or so silencio instead of doing something that might earn him the lifelong bitter treatment from the only other habitant of the house.
“I didn’t do it out of choice. It happened.” Harry says with unparalleled calmness that surprises even his own self.
he is to talk about it.
“So what is it??” Ginny asks confused and then suddenly screeches an octave higher.
Sighing, Harry decides to put the other out of this air of unease.
“Stop it. I am trying to help. I know I am a horrible person for saying all those mean things to you. B-but i never wanted y-you to get hurt...never like this.”
By this time Ron has stopped eating, which is a sign enough for Harry that something is gonna blow off and he is thinking if it is possible to apparate back home from this dinner table itself.
He gives a stiff nod to Padma and before Draco could think of anything, previously hidden behind Weasley’s auror robes emerges Potter with his untameable mop of hair and a stupid smile.
But there was no one there other than him, the vampire wizard and..
“No. Y-yes I mean.... I AM worried about the submission. You know that I have never written anything other than platonic relationships so yeah a romantic spin off of my most popular novel is a tough nut.”
Harry is saying something but draco is not really listening or trying not to listen as to come up with a plan on how to deal with this situation. It’s one particular jab in his ribs that has draco turning towards the other and snarling in anger.
He had tried the good old way of paper and pen in hopes of getting something out, anything. But still no luck and it is starting to haunt him now.
“Maybe we should do this some other day.” The words are out of his mouth unchecked and there is no way to backtrack now. It is probably for the best.
Draco tries to cast another spell but without his wand and being drained of energy, he is unable to conjure enough magic to do so.
Seeing the slightly constipated look on the other, Harry is sure Malfoy remembers that conversation very well too.
Because at home Dudley only gave him punches once a while but in school, unchecked, Dudley and his minions took it upon themselves to not leave any part of his body unbruised. They never touched his face but everything else was as green as his eyes.
There has been importing of illegal potion ingredients and after a week of patrolling and tailing...both harry and draco have somewhat identified their culprit.
(See the end of the chapter for
“HARRY”
“Merlin! I should have guessed. I knew it was not a curse or a bite. But I never thought you would be…”
“How so? It’s the normal me only.” Harry says around the mouthful while skillfully avoiding looking straight at Hermione in hopes of not giving away his emotions.
Maybe she understands that inner turmoil Harry is going through because she is smiling softly at him. Her warm hands are grabbing his in a reassuring squeeze and just like that all the tension bleeds away from his body.
It will only be a miracle if someone finds him before tomorrow morning. And he does not want to think about what will happen to him by then.
The said male is fidgeting on his spot from the doorstep from where he has not moved an inch which is quiet uncharacteristic of the golden boy. By now he would have been driving Draco crazy by his relentless questions. But today he looks different.
It is a common knowledge that Animagus have to be registered with the Ministry to avoid using their ability for illegal purposes. There have been records of unregistered animagus like Potter’s father and his friends. In Peter Pettigrew’s case especially, if they had known he was an animagus maybe things would have been different. After the war, the new ministry entrusted stricter laws, so anyone who had not registered prior to become an animagus was punishable to law and could serve years in Azkaban. This record is public. So, if Harry Potter had been a registered animagus, the whole wizarding world would have known. But since they don’t it only means he is unregistered. And Professor Mcgonagall knew. How did it happen? Did Potter use his saviour card to keep his status under wraps? Draco cannot help but snicker at the thought; so much for never using his fame and status for his own selfish motive.
Not many people in his own building have seen him, only an elderly lady from across his door, the staff at reception desk and only the postman know how Harry Potter, the mysterious guy from 7th floor looks like.
Draco glances up at the healer with bored expression and returns back to the file he was reading.
“I was waiting for you to ask this question.”
“If I may say, we are meeting here because of you, Potter. Because you went ahead and marked me. And all I want to know is what I am dealing with. What does it have anything to do with what you know or don’t know about me?” Draco knows he sounds exaggerated but he can’t help it. Potter is being so stupid. A tiny voice in his head counters with how he does not want to tell Potter anything about him because he is scared - about what all Potter will find out and how will he react. Draco shuts down that voice immediately.
"I think that's the reason the house reacted the way it did when I entered. God knows how long it had waited for a Black to step into the house."
“You will, right?”, his words are not confident anymore and Harry feels ashamed to make his friend doubtful.
“Couldn’t take a break for even one whole day. Could you, Malfoy?” There is fake defeat in her voice as the smile on her face does nothing to hide the fondness.
“I will help you of course, Harry. But I think this time Draco is the one who could really help you more. Not just because he is in a way involved in it but he is a practiced Healer and I know his expertise is in creatures. So maybe he can answer your questions.”
“After the war, it was difficult to get out. I hated how everybody treated me. Not all the people who lost a loved one were not mad at me. Some of them were very angry and they would say things and then… It was getting difficult. I was mostly holed up in Grimmauld place. Not the best place to live alone but I had no choice. It became awkward to stay at the burrow after Ginny and I broke up.”
It’s hard to formulate the right words to ask the question. But if he delayed any more second, Draco thinks he might not be able to ask it or most probably Potter will leave before he gets the chance.
Ron just looks at him. His eyes searching for something. What? Harry is not sure. But a beat later, the red head nods and glances away.
While they both walk towards Draco’s healer office - which is the only private enough place in St. Mungo's for him; all Draco can think about is a beast with fur color of midnight and eyes as green as the forest after rain.
There was once a moment when Potter had looked at him with worry, his fists clenched and anger flashing in his green eyes. It was when Draco said he almost believed he was gonna die last night.
“You were not-”.....”Oh, Harry!” She exclaims suddenly and Draco is itching to grab his head in his hands. He cannot imagine the amount of trouble this is gonna cause him. He can already see the smirk playing on Padma's face. She had been insufferable since his accident anyway; annoying him with repeated questions about Potter and his strange behavior - that daft.
In the coming hours, harry might regret telling it to Draco Malfoy of all people. But right now, he is not gonna keep anything bottled up anymore. He will let lose everything. Maybe as his potential mate, Malfoy deserves to know all this.
Draco tries to pull his wand out of his holster and realizes in a moment of panic that he has no wand on him.
Once inside, not knowing what to do Draco just stands there in complete silence. Potter is not doing great either if his fidgeting and occasional scuffs of shoes over the carpet are any indication.
He doesn't know how to answer it in fact. Because there is no particular answer to it. He just can’t bear to be in a crowd. People suffocate him.
After a handful of spells and cross checking them, Padma steps back and hands over the chart to the intern who quickly leaves to file the report.
Harry does not want to go to this dance and make a fool out of himself. But as one of the participants of the tournament, he must. And really for one second he had the impulsive thought of going with ron but the idea makes him puke.
The spell, however, does not remain for long and dissipates quickly. How, though, nobody figures it out.
"I am sorry. I had no idea you were unaware of the proceedings. The man died the next day. He had lost a lot of blood."
“It took my dad three years but I managed to acquire my form in five months. I have had help though. If not for Professor Mcgonagall and Hermione, maybe I would have never been able to transform. The first time I changed, it was scary. Like everyone else I had thought to be a stag - like my patronus - same as my father’s.”
Cho is going with cedric and that were the most awkward 2 minutes of harry’s life when he had stuttered in front of her to ask.
He looks at the healer, who was already looking at him, quite intensely if he may so add. And Harry realizes that Malfoy’s eyes have a blue tinge added to its usual stormy grey. Were his eyes always the color of this? He never noticed and that must be something because Harry was obsessed with the blonde during their Hogwarts days. He would have noticed. Maybe it’s something adulthood has gifted him or maybe it is just a permanent reaction to always surrounded by infection and potion.
“You would have to be more specific than that, Potter. We both said a lot of things last time we met.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry knows he should stop speaking any further. Malfoy does not want to know about his life but something in him tells him to just say it. And the fact that Malfoy has not left or stopped him makes it even harder to stop.
“You wanted something. Anything
They are just around the corner of Robard’s office when Ron stops harry with a hand to his elbow. His eyes look shy and worried. Harry is already dreading what his best mate and partner is about to ask. He just hopes it is not what he has been worried about.
Potter goes silent again but this time Draco looks at him closely; notices the tension in his body, a grim expression on his face, his tightly fisted hands and something coils within him.
“W-why”, Draco stands up to walk towards Potter who had stepped back into the middle of the room. They are just at arm’s length away so Draco stops, and with head held high and looking straight at those set of green eyes, asks what he had wanted to since that night in the forest.
“good-looking.” Harry simply glares at her.
It was enough for Ron though, because then he is striding towards the office and with a sigh pushes it open, Harry following him close behind leaving thoughts of familiar scent and a blonde male behind.
“Oh c’mon Harry. You only ever talk about your stories, your struggle at meeting deadlines, or about your imaginary characters. If that’s not the case, don't forget your red as tomato face which you denied even when it's oh so obvious it must be because of someone. So who? Spill it NOW.”
“There were so many letters. Some were just normal letters that teenage friends exchange full of laughter and their summer holidays endeavours. Some were regarding Sirius and his family. And some more were regarding Remus. A lot were actually regarding Remus and how to help their friend. My father seemed to have researched quite well on how to help their friend. He was the one to suggest becoming animagi too. It is said that presence of other creatures help calm down a werewolf during his transformation. Since werewolf only attacks humans, it was safer for them to be around their friend during the full moon in not their human form to help him out.”
, George had started thinking, speaking to himself when the thought would come up – but he couldn’t yet.
Ginny laughed and retorted, “Yeah but Ron deserved that comment.”
Ginny looked small there, but so –
Ginny thought to herself.
But Harry also thought he wanted to stay inside. He didn’t want to sit in another silence with her, not in the cold that blows in on August nights now, out in the field far from where Molly and Arthur would see them.
His hand stopped.
Ginny’s only thought was the smell of quidditch broomsticks and evergreen trees on Harry’s pullover as she let her lids close all the way and pulled at the hem.
“If not, that’s alright. You look tired,” Ginny said, and he was. He was also glad she’d extended the invitation to stay. She pulled on her short boots, not bothering to untie their laces.
And she feared, looking at him all unraveled in front of her, for her, that there was something wrong with the way it did.
“Merlin, Gin,
Ginny thought to herself.
Harry watched her dress as he laid in bed. Ginny’s body was toned and thin and fair, freckled everywhere, and Harry just watched her. He wanted to know what Ginny was thinking; he started to feel resentment that she had no intention of telling him.
Ginny sighed.
she thought, reaching to touch his face. There was a glean of sweat Ginny only noticed when her thumb brushed over his flushed cheek.
August 22nd, 1998
Ginny was laying back on his bed, undressed, her knees in the air around Harry’s hips. Her feet pressed against the sheets next to Harry’s bent knees. Her hair draped across the back of Harry’s pillow.
She smiled at him.
She chuckled then, “Harry, I cANNOT breathe. Please, bloody—” she coughed exaggeratedly, “—hell.”
Ginny tried to meet Harry’s gaze again, but he had started to study his feet. Shite, Ginny was thinking fast.
“You feel so good,” Harry gasped with honey in his voice.
That is all, I hope you enjoy.~
Draco has always taken pride in his in-depth knowledge about almost everything; especially if it concerned magical creatures and medicine. He still remember those years after the war that he spent locked away in the manor’s old library because it was the only place - out of all the quarters still left to them and not under ministry acquisition - that held no vile memory to him. There was nothing much to do anyways. He was under house arrest. His father locked away in azkaban and his mother fairly occupied in dealing with ministry, with accusations, with his father’s trial, with the hostility, and with redeeming the Malfoy name.
Draco can’t believe the state the boy is in. Harry looks like he has been beaten badly and if the way he is coughing and holding his ribs as if in extreme pain, draco is scared he might have fractured it. Who could have done this to him? And why draco is worst than “them”. Draco assumes 'them' to be the assaulters. Is he that bad? Yes, he agrees he has been bullying the poor boy since he started attending school here. But he never lifted a hand on him. Maybe few occasional shoves. But even those made him feel so guilty that he would avoid the other for a coming month. And this all started because harry refused to be his friend when draco offered.
Ginny knows Harry is not telling him something by the way he is not meeting her eyes.
However, it seems, Draco took too long a time to conjure a question because when he snaps out of it and looks at Potter, or the place he has been standing on the last time; there is no Potter there now. In haste, Draco looks around and finds the said man near the door, about ready to exit.
The scent of fresh blood and flesh wound fills the air around them and Draco feels sick to his stomach. The wolf then looks at him and Draco for the first time notices the green eyes staring back at him that looks eerily familiar. Before he could think much though the wolf grabs a wand in his jaw and throws it at him.
However, before Draco could step away from the dinner table a hand shoots out and suddenly Draco's wrist feels like it is on fire.
The casual knocks for a cup of milk, or a pair of scissors with reason ‘I can’t find mine. There is still so much to unpack’ have started to annoy Harry beyond his wit.
The words are not said rudely but there is an edge to Malfoy’s voice which Harry does not quite know where to place. He has never been good at reading people. But with Malfoy, his senses have always been heightened. Malfoy is not showing everything he feels. He is masking something. His anger or vulnerability - Harry cannot tell which one exactly.
Memories of their last interaction suddenly flashes in his mind, and his eyes suddenly darts to the person who is doing everything in his power to avoid his gaze.
“I scented you the moment you landed in the forest. I mean I didn’t exactly know it was you but the air shifted suddenly. My senses picked up a strange presence and were suddenly focused on one thing and then I was rushing towards that direction instantly. I saw you then mere meters away from the creature and I don't really know what happened after. It is all very foggy in my head still. All I remember is I fought him and then Ron was calling my name and when I looked in your direction, you were lying there unconscious.”
joking.
“I suspected as well. And to be honest I told him in the hopes of being wrong. But he only confirmed what I feared.”
. Maybe this whole dinner thing was a wrong move. Draco feels like if he breathed, they would be unbearably touching each other. Draco is hyper aware of every tingle that makes the fine hair on his legs stand. At that exact moment, almost like a vision, their last meeting flashes through his mind. Draco can still feel that fateful night; their close proximity; the heat from their bodies meeting each other. They were so so close. One move and they both would have been kissing. Draco is feeling that same pull of gravity now. And by the way Potter seems to look like he is holding in his breath, maybe he is feeling it too - the pull.
Malfoy is not slouching any more but Harry can still feel the tension oozing out of him.
As if his silent prayers had been answered, he hears footsteps closer to the door, after what felt like hours but maybe it has been just a few minutes. His conscious is already giving up on him and to stay awake is a ruthless challenge for him at the moment.
"Bonding over behind our backs I see." He obviously meant him and Hermione but does not clarify it on seeing the smirk playing on Malfoy's face. The git is definitely gonna say something crude.
“Besides love is love. You can’t help who you fall in love with.”
Harry meets Malfoy at the apparition point and questions his attire with raised brows.
“Wait”, Draco hated to interrupt but something important just occurred to him.
And there it is. Out in open. Laid bare and loud. Is there any way harry can escape this?
There are so many questions that are answered now but so many new emerged. And the biggest and most important of them all being ‘how the hell Potter marked on him?’
“There was a time when I did not want to move from the bed. Eating, washing up, speaking, walking - all these mundane things felt like chores that my body and mind could just not do. Even Ron and Hermione were unable to get through me. It was just me and kreacher in Grimmauld place. I literally thought I would not wake up one day. It would have been something - the saviour dying in his sleep. No curse. No accident.”
“Oh.” Draco hears some rustling behind him and turns to find Potter has moved back to his book shelf and is actually going through one of his medicine books. What has gotten into this git, he wonders soundlessly.
As Draco’s eyes finally adjusts to the brightness of the hospital ward, he sees a familiar face of Padma Patil in her green robes inspecting the clipboard in her hands - most probably his diagnostic chart - the blonde thinks to himself.
One minute both of them were tailing the guy - they are not sure if he is a wizard or just a muggle middleman - and next second he is gone just as they round the corner. But then they hear a commotion from a nearby street and they know there guy is aware of their presence so they bolt to get him.
This is the third time Hermione has suggested something on the same grounds since he arrived and Harry is not sure if he should be worried or not. Hermione usually gauges his feelings pretty spot on. He, however, does not want Hermione to see through these feelings of his this time.
I need some hp/drarry moots on twitter as well so ->
He wants to scream for help but all he can get out is some choked coughs mixed with sobs. His lungs are giving out and the pain is lulling him into a deep slumber. But the moment his eyes were about to drop close, the door to the closet creaks open and the light from hallways filters inside making him open his eyes in response. And the one he sees standing on the doorway is not who harry imagined to have been rescued by. He isn’t even sure if he is getting rescued or something worse is going to happen. And the moment the boy steps closer and crouches down, Harry loses it. Every emotion - anger, pain, betrayal - everything crashes on him at once and he lets out a blood curdling scream.
Come say hi to me on
” Draco surprisingly finishes his sentence.
“I have been in the forest for last five days. Thinking that I would be able to catch the culprit and save the next victim. But obviously it was all in vain.”
“I registered but I was also supposed to join aurors soon. The first response from ministry was to not do it but then it was Hermione (like always) who came up with a wicked solution. She suggested that I use my animagus form in missions as undercover. It didn’t take much for DMLE to favour us when faced with Hermione reasons. So, to answer your question. I am actually a registered animagus but my record was kept hidden from the public. There is a special clause in the law for animagus who works for the ministry and protection of wizarding world to keep their status covet.”
With that Draco Malfoy turns around and walks away like a pointy git he is.
“Sorry, Harry. But Lavender asked me already and i said yes.”
"The last time I was here was when we hadn't even entered Hogwarts. Although I think I only visited twice but I remember this place more than I imagined. It has not changed much."
“I saw him today. And he looked-”
When he was first asked to make a public appearance, his hands had turned cold and face turned ashen white. Ginny never asked him again.
So with a resigned sigh, Harry tells her all about a nosy neighbour who came out of nowhere and tried to barge into his life uninvited.
When harry does not response and the silence has stretched long, Ron looks at him hesitatingly.
Harry knows Malfoy can see the challenge in his eyes but somehow manages to not rise to the bait. If anything, he feels a bit red in the face, maybe it is just the wine. Clearly, Harry is imagining things.
“Harry you never told how you found Malfoy last night during the attack in the forest.”
“Excuse Me.” Harry is aware of the similar muggle phrase but is absolutely sure that that was not what Malfoy meant. “You talk as if the house is a sentient being.” Harry settles at saying out loud only his last thought. He was expecting a lot of things but not this - Malfoy telling him his house just welcomed the blonde male; when even Harry does not feel welcomed in it some days.
He takes a step back quietly and it turns out to be the wrong move because the vampire is now much closer to him than he was a mere second ago.
He had called Malfoy’s name repeatedly while cradling his head in his lap. His body embracing the cold one of the blonde male protectively as Ron and other aurors had gathered around them.
“What?”
[Trigger Warning] Bullying and Physical assault
“About how you are able to shapeshift into a wolf.” She chooses her words very smartly not revealing much as there is always someone around who could hear it. And although it is not a very big secret but it is something that Harry would like not many people to know. And one more addition is already gonna happen soon which he is not really looking forward to.
Harry has no idea for how long he has been laying there. The closet was already dark and dudley had locked the door from outside on his way out. Harry without his glasses can’t even seem to see past his hand. His throat is all choked up from crying and the blood numbing pain.
“C’mon Potter. Let’s get this over with.”
The hooded figure is only a metre away now and Draco has finally resigned himself to his fate. The moment the vampire bares his fangs and closes on to him, a low growl from his right makes Draco whip in the said direction with lightning speed.
The next time they meet is at Grimmauld place. When Harry had invited Malfoy over he had serious doubts about if the other would even accept it or not. Malfoy, however, had seemed very keen on Harry’s offer. The reason of which he discovered later on when Malfoy arrived dressed like he has come for a ministry gala.
“What? Use your words, Potter.”
Thank you for reading this story.
Draco looks at Potter again and zeroes-on on his eyes and with a startle realizes that the green of his eyes seems familiar. The last time Draco saw eyes similar to these were last night, just that they were
“Aren’t you too overdressed compared to the occasion?” Harry asks to which he gets only a scoff in response from the blonde male.
“Oh I don’t wanna know what you had been doing this late night in Malfoy’s office, mate.”
“And I don’t know why but i felt -”
Recounting last night, from what all he could remember was more tiring than he originally thought so. And all now Draco wants to do is go back to his manor and plant himself face first onto his silk sheets, soft comforter and a warm bed.
There is a knock on the door and a quiet enquiry of if someone is inside. Harry is unsure if the person asked it quietly or his hearing has been affected following his assaut. He prefers the former situation with all his heart.
“There was a group of four students - Gryffindor - who called themselves marauders during their Hogwarts days. My father was one of them.” Harry pauses to swallow down his emotions. He does not talk about his parents often. People who are close to him already know everything and people who are not, he does not want them to know. He has never found himself in a predicament similar to the current one. So it is hard for him to decide how to react properly. It is not every day that he tells his nemesis about his closely guarded rare memories of his family.
“Masters,”
Honestly, Harry had imagined a lot more questions from Ron. But seeing the look of confusion mixed with something akin to disgust and maybe slight disappointment must have something to do with the absence of more questions.
“Harry, are you ok?? You look distracted.” Ginny asks when Harry fails to react to her calls of his name for the third time.
He was about ready to pack his bags and leave for France when he got an owl from his current boss, Healer Claire. She told him about an opening for an apprentice under her. She had seen his scores and he already took all the subjects necessary for a healer too as they were same as for potions so it all fit perfectly.
"Harry, mate. It's us. Your friends and this is our professor. Remember who you are. Harry, listen to your heart. Remember", it is Weasley this time and Draco almost tsk at him when he sees a shift in the wolf. It is no longer snarling at them, and has also stopped advancing at them. But he still looks in pain. Not a physical one though. And Draco realizes it with a start that he can feel it. The struggle going on inside Harry's head. His human self is trying to take control over his beast. To remind it who the people in front are.  To stop himself from attacking and causing them harm. The wolf snarls again, but the very next second lets out a loud whimper as if in pain. Draco feels like he is being stretched into two opposite directions but comes to his senses in time to know that it is not him, but Harry, who is feeling this way.
“My wolf is a timber wolf”, Harry starts in a quiet voice and stops to gauge Malfoy’s reaction whose back tenses a little at first and then go lax. The blonde still does not turn around though but neither tell Harry to stop or get out. No more vials end up on floor so Harry taking this as an approval goes on with his story. He starts from the beginning. About how broken and betrayed he felt after the war. Not to forget how he came back from the dead. Harry assumes Malfoy must have known that detail, his mother being the first one to know it on that night of the battle. He sees Malfoy twitching at his telling of the dying part and is unable to comprehend why it brings him relief but weirdly, it does.
"Trust me, I have been asking myself the same since forever." Potter answers once he has stopped fidgeting and found his voice to actually use for what its purpose is.
Hii...umm idek where to start from. Probably from praying that you all are safe. Please, be safe and healthy.
After they manage to drag all 5 unconscious wizards back to HQ with the help of their backup that usually arrives after they both are done battling alone, draco rounds harry around the corner to their shared office and shoves him inside unceremoniously.
A smirk grew on Draco’s face as he continued massaging up Harry’s neck in circular motions. He worked his hands back to Harry’s shoulders then leant down to kiss the exposed flesh in front of him. “Mmm,” Harry murmured his enjoyment then added, “Don’t think you can coax any information out of me by doing this though, ‘cause you won’t.”
Santa Claus is coming to town.
“Thank you, Minister. I think I can take it from here. You can get back to the party and let everyone know their hero is in safe hands.”
“Do you mind if I stand up now?” Harry asked after a short while.
“And here I was thinking you’d actually changed,” Harry mumbled.
Draco cut his steak with easy and it all but melted in his mouth. A very good sign. “Yes, I think the food gets a tick.”
“I could buy you dinner tonight?”
Music started playing in Draco's ear again.
A couple of seconds later, music filled his ears. The tune was rather upbeat and not unlike some of the latest music being played on the wizarding wireless. A female voice started singing.
“It feels fine now.”
“Excuse me, Headmistress,” Harry said as he stood in McGonagall’s office trying to ignore the knowing look he was receiving from Dumbledore’s portrait.
“Are you sure this is my assignment and not yours?”
Harry looked at Hermione. "What are you talking about?"
Their tea came and Ron began debriefing him about a case he'd recently closed. They finished their first cup and the topic changed to updates on family and friends. Harry poured himself a second cup and heard the door open as he replaced the small pot on the table. Looking up he saw a brown haired wizard he didn't recognise followed by one he knew all too well.
“Probably.”
H.G.”
Draco just shook his head at Harry’s poor reasoning. “But you admit some were deliberate attempts to see me?”
“But I thought you needed my help?” Harry said with a puzzled expression on his face. “If you don’t, then I guess I’ll just go home...”
“That’s not the point, Draco, and you know it.”
“I’m not sure. Maybe a few weeks.”
“Has he sent you anything else? Do you know when he’ll be back?” Draco pressed.
Harry’s grin widen. He pulled back, picked up Draco’s tea and walked it back to his table, placing it down next to his own tray. Sitting back in his favourite spot, it felt satisfying to have Draco beside him this time. Not pathetic at all.
“Yes, Ron. And you can tell Hermione I’m fine too,” Harry sighed. “Nothing is going on.”
He watched Draco's smirk grow and the next thing Harry knew Draco had switched their positions so he was now pinned against the wall by Draco's body and being given a proper snog.
Harry deflated a little, “Sorry,” said sincerely. “I shouldn’t have said that. You know how work’s been lately.”
“I’ll think about it.” Draco leaned forward so he could place a peck on Harry’s lips.
Draco rose from where he’d been resting on the edge of his desk and started walking towards him. Part of Harry wanted to run, but the Gryffindor in him wasn’t having any of it. Whatever the Slytherin was going to do, he could handle it.
"He wasn't my first choice for information, believe me. I went to Hermione and then the family liaison officer and neither told me a damn thing. Hermione kept telling me to be patient but I think I was more than patient having waited 3 weeks without a single sign to know if you were even still alive or not."
“What was that?” Harry asked suspiciously.
When Narcissa sat down, she immediately embraced her son and hid her face in his shoulder. Draco wrapped his arms around his mother’s waist and looked up at his father standing for his sentence. The crowd was silent as the Chief Warlock read out the long list of charges, all of which he had been found guilty.
Harry stared at Draco for a few seconds, trying to work out what he was up to,  before accepting Draco’s suggestion at face value and removing his robe. With a flick of his wand and a couple of non-audible incantations, Draco shrunk the robe and levitated it into the breast pocket of Harry’s shirt.
The Daily Prophet could create a story out of anything if they had a picture of Harry or Draco to work from, even better if some lucky photographer managed to snap them both at the same time. The Wizarding World’s newest ‘it’ couple was always headline news, even if that headline was usually a fabrication.
“Well… you see… I was wondering if you’d be able to tell me about how you came to hire Professor Malfoy?”
Draco stood and grabbed the air where he thought Harry’s arm would be based on the indents in the grass. His hand connected with Harry’s bicep on the first attempt, which seemed to stop his partner in his tracks. “Let’s go down the path between wall of this paddock and the wall of that estate over there.”
"I'll try."
Harry rolled his eyes and went back to his list. He didn't see anything different in the way Draco was staring at him. And it's not like Draco could
Although he was still shocked when younger people didn’t recognise Malfoy, Harry knew it was a good thing. He smiled and said, “We have a lot of history.”
“How am I supposed to work then?”
The confusion must have shown on Harry’s face because Draco shook his head and gave a small, nervous laugh. “Damn you, Potter.” Draco’s eyes settled on Harry’s again, which made him feel very uncomfortable. It took all of Harry’s effort to keep from looking away. “You make me want to be a better man. Better than what I was brought up to be. I figured helping teach the next generation of witches and wizards would be a good way to do that. Reminding them that we all have a choice, like you’ve taught me on many occasions.”
“Umm, sure.”
“Thank you,” Draco said sarcastically.
“Oh come on, Weasley. You can’t expect me to just keep sitting around hoping Harry is okay when I know you have more information than you’re telling me. Now, what’s happening?”
Harry sighed and threw his head back in what Draco believed was frustration, but didn’t utter a word. The movement put his neck on show and further exhibited the muscles in his torso and it didn’t take long until Draco slowly pulled out of Harry and thrust back in. The speed of his thrust developed incrementally before he found himself grabbing one of Harry’s thighs and resting a dark hair covered calf on his shoulder.
"Fine. No, I haven't."
“I might need some help,” Harry replied and reluctantly let Draco help him sit up.
They started off discussing plans for what to do on the Hogwarts Express, which moved into the week ahead and then about the week past. Harry heard Scorpius say, “My dad’s been acting differently since he fixed your dad’s ribs. He was extra proud of himself and then he was giddy about your dad requesting him, not once but twice.”
Draco received another kiss on the neck in response.
“Well then, how about I give you a few extra lessons over the holidays so you can practice a bit more?”
“From someone else then?” Draco chased, he wasn’t a Slytherin for nothing.
As soon as she left the room, Draco turned on Potter. “What were you both on about? I am not illiterate.”
“Since you trust me,” Draco smirked. “And since she saw me eyeing you while the two of you were dancing before her speech.”
“Yes, but I didn't mean…”
Dumbledore’s portrait sniggered and Snape rolled his eyes before replying. “I don’t think there is much you can do at this point, except hope the Wizengamot is lenient in it’s sentencing since Lucius didn’t really do any of the heavy lifting. He tended to do just enough behind the scenes to get into the Dark Lord’s good graces without putting himself at risk where prosecution was concerned. However, he may have played all his cards for getting out of trouble after you defeated Voldemort the first time.”
Draco moved closer to Harry so their bodies touched and whispered in his ear. “Much better.” As he pulled back, he left a light kiss on the side of Harry's stubble covered cheek.
Draco’s tongue delved into his partner’s mouth, gliding his hand behind his head and into the messy black locks once more. He thrust his hips forward to grind their hard lengths together. Harry moaned loudly as Draco found his pulse with his tongue and covered it with his mouth, sucking and licking that sweet spot until he heard his name. “Oh, Draco.” He couldn’t help but smile before shifting his kissing to under Harry’s jaw and enjoying the smooth skin he found there.
“Try to avoid talking about Lucius, I suppose. Concentrate on what Draco has done himself and how he is continuing to change.”
“What do you want, Malfoy?” Harry asked impatiently. “I haven’t got all day.”
,” he whispered, sounding suspiciously like Granger.
Harry occasionally made suggestions, but otherwise sat back with the little speakers in his ears, listening to whatever was being emitted from his Muggle device.
He knew it was taking a lot of Harry’s willpower not to respond to Draco’s advances. “Do I really need to remind you that we’re on duty?”
“Oh?” Harry made the sound a question.
“Maybe, maybe not. But I have no doubt you love me.”
Draco whispered an incantation and the rest of the dirt and gravel were drawn out from Harry's bleeding flesh without any pain. "My job," Draco replied, matter-of-factly. He put his hand out and Louise handed him a vile of what Harry presumed contained essences of dittany. Draco carefully placed small drops of the liquid over the wound, which stopped bleeding then regrew the flesh that had been scraped away.
Harry didn’t have time to contemplate more about what Draco might be thinking, as the Chief Warlock started to address him.
He's gonna find out
Harry looked at the clock on the wall. He supposed Ron could handle things in the office for another hour or two. “Err… I guess I shouldn’t keep you waiting any longer.”
He moved his head and wished he hadn’t. The back of his head throbbed where it had hit the edge of the bar.
Harry wanted to keep walking, but Draco grabbed him around the waist and turned them around to face the group of Slytherins the call had come from. “I’ll have you know that Harry has planned a lovely picnic followed by a stroll around the lake afterwards.” Draco punctuated his comment by squeezing Harry to his side and tilting his head to rest on Harry’s. He stayed there for a few seconds before letting go and turning to walk towards the Great Hall again.
Draco noticed Madam Malkin walking in with three rolls of fabric; one dark green, one deep blue and the other crimson red. “What are you here for?”
Harry balls his hands into a fist and counts to ten while keeping his eyes tight shut. It is something that he saw on a therapy programme on telly once and has since then adopted the method to keep his temper in check. So far it has worked but with Malfoy, his temper has always been heightened so he is having a hard time not to scowl, or growl, or to swear rather colorfully and if possible to land a bruising punch on his handsome face.
“But that's not what I am worried about. At least not today.”
There is a teasing smirk on Ginny’s face and Harry makes a disgusted face at her in return which makes her laugh full blown.
“Ron, I think you would have to be my date.”
Draco keeps staring without blinking as Potter regards him with such intensity. Only the slight raised eyebrows were the reaction his question got from the golden boy or should they call him a golden man now. Unnecessary thought, Draco thinks and pushes it away.
Draco didn’t know that. Thinking to himself he again notices how lucky Potter is to have Granger as a friend.
“Draco! I thought you had already left.”
So, it's a wizard-vampire. Draco isn’t sure why he is noting down these details in his head when he will be the meal of the said creature in a while. Maybe it is just his healer’s side taking over.
“Potter, just say it.” His patience is running out and Draco does
And potter laughs at that - loud, boisterous and carefree. The only time Draco has seen him laugh like this is when he is with his friends. Being at the receiving end of Potter’s laughter brings a warm feeling to Draco. And the feeling intensifies exponentially when Potter turns around to look at him just before exiting and leaves Draco with a ghost of a smile and tingling warmth.
It takes a minute for Draco to respond and still he just nods not knowing what to say.
Harry stops opening his door for the guy and he stops coming back after like 3 days.
(in case any of you are shy and wants to ask anonymously or just scream at me for this mess)
“Sirius Black,” Harry says the name slowly “was my godfather.”
Harry can’t help but join her in.
Till then...please enjoy this.
Harry can’t see draco’s tears and the latter is relieved to notice that. But he is going mad seeing harry so bruised up. He does the only thing he can think of and calls blaise, who he knows must be in the basketball court practicing, and asks him to get any teacher asap to the brooms closet on the second floor of the school building. And then he waits. Harry is battling the unconsciousness and draco has scooted  closer to rest the battered boy’s head on his lap and tries to help him breathe better. Harry has stopped resisting his help and draco is glad for that.
Giving up on making any sense out of Potter's mood, Draco settles on the chair left to the head of the table. As potter takes his own seat on his right, all the while giving him a funny look, it finally dawned on Draco how bad of a decision it was to sit so close to Potter. Their legs are almost touching. Draco can feel Potter's body heat crashing over him from his toes up to his groin.
It has been 3 weeks and still the blank sheet stares at Harry vacantly.
Of course Draco had thought about it a lot. Researched a lot. Even if he had claimed about Potter marking him on a whim. He had a lot to think about later on. And the answer was plain as day. However, there might be things that Potter is confusing this marking with.
Drarry! Muggle AU
Vampire(s).
(tbc maybe xD)
Harry is not sure what throws him off guard more. The fact that Malfoy have been to Grimmauld place or the fact that he insinuated that the Black house looks like what it has always been - haunted and unwelcoming, or was that just exclusive to Harry. Like Harry living here has not improved the eeriness of the house even in slight.
“Wtf potter..what kinks!!!!”
“I don’t know” he tries.
Harry remembered everything from that night. In fact everything in painful detail. The fear that had clouded his mind when Malfoy’s scent reached him. He had dashed at the speed of light. Fear overcoming his whole being and words like
“Relax Draco. The meeting was cancelled.” Before Draco could switch into his dramatic mode, Padma settles down his theatrics with her announcement.
Draco is suddenly much awake. Five days. Potter has been in the forest. One part of him wants to taunt the other for not being able to catch the vampire fast enough but the other part of him knows how it would be such a douche thing to say. He decides to stay quiet and hear in Potter’s next words.
So he worked hard to be his own person in last few years. To not be the son of a death eater, to not be an ex death eater himself, to make a life out of his family name.
They have not talked about what happened that day. Thank Merlin for that. What would he even say to justify that? Who even had made the first move, he does not know. And he is glad Potter is being ignorant about that as well. But what Draco cannot ignore is
“Remember, I can’t talk parseltongue anymore so you have to abandon your kinks and talk like a normal person.”
“You are taking it quite well for some unexpected reason.” Harry just says which had Draco narrowing his eyes in suspicion.
roared in his head at that moment.
As Kreacher places the glasses on the table and fills them up with ruby red wine, Harry noticing offhandedly how the glasses are sparkly shining, Draco eyes him suspiciously and thanks Kreacher for his service. The said elf, for lack of a better word, glows up radically on getting praised by Malfoy - or probably it's the Black part of Malfoy that satisfies him. He appears far from his withered self though. It would be incorrect if Harry denied that he was not jealous of this whole ordeal.
Draco however tries to project a wandless protego in hopes of stalling his dreadful fate for few more seconds. The shield was not even halfway through when the man, the vampire expels it with his own wand.
“I did not know at first. It was actually Draco who said so.”
He nods, not really sure of his ability to speak coherently.
“Don’t bother. Sorry I asked.” Malfoy does not meet his eyes as he says it and turned around to walk towards his desk. Maybe he could feel Harry’s inner hesitation because his words completely contradict his curiosity to know more just moments ago.
Of pain.
They can talk about their past after they get out of their current situation; when harry does not look like he is dying and when draco’s heart does not feel like it is burning in anguish.
"Professor, Harry...he i-is….", that must be Granger, Draco thinks to himself. The wolf, Harry, Draco corrects himself, is just there in front of him and Weasley, Granger, and Professor are a metre behind him. All maintaining a safe distance and with an alert stance. Draco notices how Professor waves Weasley to lower his wand when the gingerhead aims it at the wolf, probably in defence in case the wolf attacks. Draco would have done the same thing, they have no idea if the beast will attack or not. If it still has Harry's memory or not. Werewolves, once transformed, do not retain the memories of their human self, so it cannot be said that the same will not be true for an animagus wolf.
If possible Draco would have liked to wipe that smug look off of Potter this very second. He manages to just scowl in response though.
It is not like Harry has never had a bad day. There have been lots in fact. Days when he is unable to write a word and is tired and exhausted; frustration running through his insides like oxygen.
Saying he was surprised by the sudden offer would be an understatement. He had been rejected by each one of the potions master he approached. And so to get an offer on its own was not something he expected. There was at least one person who was ready to look past his family name, past the death mark on his arm, past his father. And Draco would be a fool to let go of such an opportunity. He grabbed it giving it his all. It did not take him long to start loving what he was doing. There was hostility, doubts, painful jabs, insults, occasional hexes and much more to encounter every day. But he took it all in. He deserved this much at least; he would say whenever Claire or others who became his friends would ask him to respond. It did not stop suddenly. It took years for him to make everyone see him as someone other than an ex death eater. But they saw it eventually. And even if there were still few glances and glares thrown his way. There were far more smiles and politeness and above all respect for his work in the eyes of others.
“I don’t know what you are talking about.” As if that would be of any help to him but harry has to at least try. He does not like the look Hermione is giving him. Ron at least has an expression of annoyance on his face which is expected and so does not scare Harry. But Hermione’s smirk is giving all kinds of bad vibes to him.
“Potter!” Harry’s inner monologue is interrupted by the sudden call of his name in the most irritated voice possible. Before he can counter back though, his magic pulses indicating a spell being thrown at his privacy charm bubble. He looks at Draco and the other has already sensed it somehow because he is lifting his finger in a motion to ‘stay put’ and crosses the room to throw open the door with a swish of his wand, dismantling Harry's privacy spell in the process.
A voice in the back of his head questions him and he shuts out that annoying voice almost immediately.
“About me marking you. That’s what you said that day. Are you sure about that fact because I don’t..”, Harry leaves the sentence hanging there gesturing between themselves to indicate what he means, which he is sure the pointy git understood completely well but still appears clueless. The smirk on his face though does little to help hide that fact.
(See the end of the chapter for
“The house just welcomed me.” Malfoy tells him in a whisper while he slowly fingers through the tapestries on the wall beside where once hung the portrait of Walburga Black, entirely clueless about how Harry is gawking at him from the back.
It has happened all too many times, when one of them starts to execute their own plan and leaves the other no choice but to go along because otherwise the option is to just...die of an unforgivable curse.
“I will just do the customary diagnostic spells and record those for file and then you can go.” she says as she prepares to cast.
It’s a lot to take in. What all Potter just told him; why would he even do that, Draco is not sure but it's hard to digest all the information.
But only if harry had known what was about to happen today, he would have tried to escape in time.
“Stop making my life any more difficult. Why can’t you just stay the fuck out of my life? If you had to prance away like a beast then do it. Why involve me?”
“Do you know about Marauders?” Harry does not meet Malfoy’s eyes and pretends to appear busy scrolling through a random book he picked up from the bookshelf. He is sure Malfoy is not buying his act but it feels better to busy his hands and eyes with something other than stare any longer at the blonde male.
The moment the vampire tries to run past the wolf, with a low growl and a pounce the beast scratches the vampire across the chest and locks his canines onto the figure’s neck. A blood curdling scream resounds into the quiet forest as the vampire falls on the ground with a loud thud. The beast however does not step away and keeps his one paw over the fallen wizard’s heaving chest.
Ron is right and that is the only part that Harry seems to not able to figure out. He was not even aware he was capable of marking.
“Head Auror Robards in fact asked me to stay back last night. But I just had to be there. Not just because I wanted to help at least one person but there was this dire need to be present there. I don’t know what it was but I felt different. More on edge and scared if I must admit.”
Harry murmurs an ‘oh shit’ under his breath but does not raise his head even an inch.
Even if that person is potentially your mate.
So, this took me so long. Honestly, this update is kinda unexpected. I had no intentions of writing this quick update. It just so happened.
Harry would have wished for anything but this. He has no idea how to deal with Malfoy and his lack for being civil for even a second. He never wished to have anything to do with this blonde male in his entire life. Fate, however, has always been out to get Harry. And now he is stuck with Malfoy in some kind of a twisted way because his inner animal thought it was best to fuck with him to be funny.
Giving a once over to his pitch black surroundings again, Draco tries to identify the part of forest he is in even if it is a tough task to conquer as the whole forest looks vaguely similar from everywhere to him even in broad daylight so what more to expect during this hour.
“I was looking for something to pass my time when I found the letter between my father and godfather.”
When did he get there? Why Draco didn't hear him walk towards the exit? He couldn’t even sense the privacy charm lifting, only now when he focus does he notice that Potter has already dissipated the spell.
He hopes so because if it is anything else, Harry is unsure of how to react to that. He clears his throat to get Malfoy’s attention and the other whips around so quickly; though the look of surprise instantly morphs into one of annoyance. It is fascinating to see how Malfoy transitions into one emotion from another so fast. Maybe he had forgotten all together that Harry was here after his little chat with Padma, Harry thinks to himself.
“I am serious. This is important. I am not stalling.” Harry replies in quick succession and stares hard at the other man.
As his eyes linger on the clean empty white sheet of paper and the capped pen, he asks himself if it was the right decision.
“Oh Merlin! The meeting. Claire must be pissed.”
“But is it not?” Malfoy counters with a nonchalance of a hippogriff and Harry is confused between either to laugh or scoff. He decides to just stride towards the living room leaving it up to Malfoy to follow him inside. As they take their seat on the couch from across each other, Harry notices that Malfoy is still looking around as if he is searching for something. He unknowingly voices his question and is instantly met with Malfoy’s blazing gaze that makes him surprisingly nervous.
Draco knows all of this. Of Course it will be a theory only. There has never been a wolf animagus ever before. In fact nobody ever thought it to be even possible. This on top of the rarity of a different animagus and patronus form is enough to be unexplainable.
No matter how much Ginny tells him to not worry or push himself; that there is still time left before the deadline to submit the first official draft approaches, Harry can't help but feel scared and disappointed.
As potter narrated his story, the answer emerged clear through the fog of thoughts in his head.
The first thing Draco notices as he lands on solid ground again is complete blackness. A kind of dread washes over him suddenly. At first he thinks it is his claustrophobic emotions emerging again but it takes him only a few seconds to realize that those are not his emotions. They are Potter's. Thinking of the person, Draco tries to adjust to the dark, which belatedly reminds him of a situation he found himself in weeks ago. But before he could dwell onto it, pain, like nothing he had ever felt before, rakes his entire body into a quivering mess. There are no sounds of breaking and mending of bones but it feels the same. As if his, not his but Potter's body, is broken and then mended back. That must be the case in fact. Potter did say it was the memory of his first transformation. But as far as Draco knows, animagus transformation is not supposed to hurt. Not if you are a bloody wolf too. Draco however cannot be too sure. There are no living records. Nothing to base this assumption on. An animagus wolf transformation is not like a cursed werewolf transformation that only happens on the night of a full moon. But if the pain that still runs through his mind as a dull ache - not his he reminds himself again - is to be considered, Potter's transformation was not a regular one. He fills this observation to the back of his mind to ask Potter later on and readies himself to face this unlikely situation head on.
“- is your animagus form a wolf?”
I just suddenly got an email so I opened this story and reread it and the inspiration just came.
Harry is a writer and publishes books under the pseudonym Daniel Radcliffe. His last 3 books have been international best sellers and everybody wanted to see the writer in public but Harry refused.
The sudden mention of war leaves Draco cold and shivering. All the memories come rushing back and it took a great amount of self control for Draco to not let it show on his face – the vulnerability, the pain, the guilt and the aftermath of it all. The nightmares never left him. They still haunt him and he knows they will continue to do so for a long time. The screams and cries of people; the flash of green of the killing curse; the scorching heat from the fiend fire; all of it still wakes him up screaming and sweating in his bed. The war may be over outside but it is still very much going on within him.
Draco groans in pain, discomfort and cold, unbearable cold as he wakes up to complete darkness all around. He closes his eyes as pain strikes back. A dull ache in the back of his head elicits a whimper out of him and when he brings his fingers to it, they come back wet. He is unable to see its color but on inspecting his fingers closer and inhaling the pungent scent, Draco is sure of what it is - blood - his blood to be exact.
After listening to it all silently, Ginny looks at him half confused and half amused.
“You were meeting Draco today, right Harry?”
Draco's unblinking eyes and a surprised expression must have been noticed by the other as Potter extracts himself from the couch and wandless and without word accios the pensieve in front of Draco, who is now gaping at the suddenness and quickness of Potter's actions. There is a kind of urgency in Potter's behaviour, his actions and his tight expression that does not go unnoticed by Draco but are also not fully understood by the other. It was not even half an hour ago when Potter seemed so reluctant on talking and now he appears so eager to bare all his secrets just like that. Draco is confused beyond wits. He guess he will never be able to understand how Potter's mind works.
Potter is the bane of his life. The cause of every problem he had to encounter in his life. Draco is still having a hard time wrapping his head around the fact that Potter marked him, out of all the people out there, as his mate. What even!!!
“Wait”, Draco yells but gets embarrassed by the urgency in his voice and repeats it again in a lower and less urgent voice all the while trying not to blush.
"Did you find out if there were more?" No matter how much he tries, Harry can hear the waiver in Malfoy's voice. Harry had no idea Malfoy was so affected by this accident. All the times they met in the past, Malfoy never asked him even once about the case or that vampire. Neither did Harry ever thought about telling him or imagined the other might be worried about his safety any longer.
“It happened?” Malfoy spats while releasing Harry and stepping away to prance like a caged animal.
It is not entirely the truth and Harry would be damned to tell everything to Malfoy. He hopes he look and sound convincing enough for the other to not notice the waver in his voice.
Ron and harry stands there with gaping mouths while all the girls around them starts giggling.
.” Draco presses on the last word with a scowl intending his message to be received clearly.
"It's not like I don't want to tell you but more of how to say it. I am just -"
“Ron!” Harry chokes on a piece of broth while Ron snickers and Hermione giggles uncontrollably.
Harry has never seen a liquor bottle in this house. No matter how much Harry asked Kreacher to get him anything alcoholic. Neither has harry himself seen any cellar in the house. Ron had argued for five minutes straight how there was no chance that Grimmauld place had no cellar. Harry had brushed him off even if he could practically feel kreacher lying through his teeth. He was filthy rich anyways; to buy crates of beers and anything else he wished to drink.
"I searched about any wolf animagus in history but there was none. How is it that you managed to be a miracle yet again, Potter?"
"Ms Granger, please step back", Draco knows who that voice belongs to but is still unable to process why professor Mcgonagall is part of this memory. Potter never once even belatedly mentioned about the former headmistress knowing about this debacle. He should have known though, given the status of 'boy who lived' and the 'golden trio', they must have gotten all the help they could to conquer this happening.
The first thing Draco feels the moment he dives in is the unfamiliar tug that is a little less unsettling than apparition but still manages to leave him unhinged for a second.
With these final words Harry bares himself out loud in front of a person he hated for years but the very same person whom a part of him accepted as an equal - as a mate.
They are still not sure if there is only one or more. But noting from how all the bodies had been left almost drenched dry of blood every night insinuates that the creature is thirsty. Very thirsty. The kind of unquenching thirst that comes when someone is turned a vampire not longer than a fortnight.
"Why, jealous much, Potter?" And his words prove Harry right.
Speaking of the house elf, Harry hears the faint footsteps of Kreacher coming closer and closer and when he finally plucks his eyes away from Malfoy and his full Black ensemble, it is to the sight of Kreacher wobbling into the room balancing a tray in his hands.
“Ron told me to not do this. He knew it was messing with me. It was like the war all over again. People dying in front of me. And me being absolutely helpless about it.”
A story for next month then, Harry muses.
And then the second he saw Malfoy inches away from the vampire, all he could see was red. A strange madness engulfed him and he just leaped into air without much thought. He just wanted to kill the blood sucker. Why? He was not sure then. He is not fully sure now still.
“Patil…”
"I didn't lie about anything. So in my opinion I have been nothing but honest with you. I might have withheld some information but you can't really blame me. We have had a largely colourful history. It's expected of me to be a little hesitant. I have told you so much about me in the last few weeks whereas I know nothing more than I already knew about you. Don't you think it is a little unfair?"
Ron was sure the healer was alright a second ago and then suddenly the monitors were beeping and healers were filling into the room pushing them outside.
Potter, who was so immersed in his storytelling, jerks out of it so hard that he almost staggers back in his steps. His wide eyes and horrified look is enough proof that he had forgotten where he was and to whom he was reciting his story. It takes him a minute to discern his surroundings and to come in terms with the reality. His closed eyes could be a sign of calmness or of embarrassment; Draco cannot tell which one it is with absolute surety.
(In case you are unable to access my Instagram that means I have temporarily deactivated it so feel free to ping me on twitter. I mostly cry about exo there but I do talk darry from time to time)
Disappointing people after giving them hope is his biggest nightmare that he wishes never to face in reality.
They have just floo’ed back from the St. Mungo’s and are not looking forward to report back to Head Auror Robards without the statement of the main witness and the victim as well in this case.
“I-I..who?? Wh-why?”
“I thought you were going to attack Harry. It was so dark and I was far away that I couldn’t make out your identity.”
“Okay.” Draco does not know to what that response belongs to but before he can ask Potter is asking to first finish their dinner. Although, Draco wants to refuse, he is not hungry anyways, but something in Potter’s tight set of jaws and almost pleading eyes compel him to comply with his request.
They eat in almost complete silence, the only sounds filling the space around them is of the clink of cutlery and thud of wine glasses against the wooden table. For how hard Potter pleaded on finishing the meal before having their talk, he surely is doing a poor job at pretending to eat. Both of their plates are still full and appetite vanished into thin air. Having enough of idly forking through the contents of his plate, Draco settles his fork down with a loud clunk and instead sips his wine in hopes of settling his nerves. Potter sighs and does the same.
Harry does not fail to notice the flash of surprise that passes through Malfoy’s face at the mention of his father; even if the blonde pretends to smooth his expression into one of nonchalance seconds later.
The stormy grey eyes bores death glares on to his as pale deft hands clutches at the collar of his auror robes. Harry had expected a curse thrown at him. This is going well than he expected.
He is aware of how much Malfoy wants to know the reason; can see it in his eyes, in his body language. The tension in his shoulders, the strength he is putting in fisting his palms. The way he is trying to busy himself by organizing the files on an already neat desk.
As Kreacher vanishes into thin air Draco looks at Potter and finds him with an expression similar to like he has smelled his own rotten socks. Draco can practically hear him debating about something in his head, must be something stupid, Draco deduces and clears his throat in hopes of Potter getting a move on. Although he is nowhere near hungry but not eating would make things more awkward and Draco isn’t sure how the house-elf would react to him rejecting the food. Going by his personal experiences with his own house elves, they don’t take rejecting their food mildly. It causes a bloody disaster.
Draco liked knowing everything. He did not take it well when something missed his attention, when questions were left unanswered. He hated when people left his questions unanswered as well; especially when he already have a tense relationship with the said someone.
of a human.
Harry and Hermione just looks at him with fondness which the other chooses to ignore completely and instead keep mumbling things under his breath that mostly sound like - ‘that pointy git’ and ‘ferret’.
“And aren’t you bothered that it's a he. I mean i thought-”
“Hawt” she cuts in cheekily.
Draco knows all of this and had already identified the reason behind Potter’s Dad and his friends becoming an animagus. He does not stop Potter from telling it though. God knows how long he had kept all of this inside of him. With every word, every passing sentence, Potter seems to lose the thread of tension from his body. Draco can feel the wave of his strong magic settling down as his mind finally starts to find peace. So he does not intervene and let Potter tell his story.
“No.”
“We have been finding bodies - dried of any drop of blood - in a different part of Forbidden forest for more than a week now. But I am sure you know all that. You were there yourself when they were first admitted here.”
"Who said I am here for facts? If I am dragged in this mess the least you can do is be honest with me. I think I deserve that much."
“It's the middle of freakin december but yeah it's ‘warm’. So who is it??” she wiggles her brows so lewdly that Harry almost chokes on his coffee.
“See if you are worried about the manuscript submission.Then don’t be. You have enough time till the deadline.”
The revelation being too much for his still healing self knocks Draco down unconscious yet again.
Harry is pleasantly surprised because he didn’t know THAT.
“Ronald, enough. Stop behaving like a child. We are no longer in Hogwarts. And since this is something that concerns Draco equally, it is only fair to tell him first.”
“You said Draco told you that. Are you sure he is right? Maybe he was mistaken.” It was Hermione this time who voiced out her concerns.
Padma just chuckles at him. The intern has a mind to not laugh outright if he does not want to be at the receiving end of Healer Malfoy’s wrath.
Not to forget, ron would kill him before he even asked.
"You do know I am part Black, right? I visited with mother when I was little. I never met Sirius or his brother but I remember Aunt Walburga. She had scared the shit out of me the first time I saw her. I would say Aunt Bella had nothing on that old hag." Even if Malfoy is joking about his deceased aunt, Harry can still hear the tremble in his voice on naming her. He hopes the reason has nothing to do with missing her. And now that Malfoy had mentioned it, he does remember that if Sirius had not left him to inherit the Black house it might have collectively belonged to the blonde and Teddy.
He hates himself now though, seeing the state harry is in currently. Who could be this heartless to do this to him!!! His heart burns with something draco isn’t sure what to call but one thing he knows for sure is that he wants to hurt someone real bad.
Harry, being a painfully extremist anti-social person never steps out of his home more than twice a month. One is for his regular therapy session and another for a meet up with Ginny every 15th of a month.
'I wouldn't let anyone else hurt you' was something Harry wanted to say but it was not what he had accepted by himself even. So how could he tell it to the other and deal with its consequences. He was not ready. They both were not.
And it's not just them but the constant bullying he is subjected to by other students, students that come from rich backgrounds and think of him as dirt has harry living his worst nightmare in real life.
"Think about it. Okay.”
He doesn't know. But also he is not completely unaware. He did talk to Professor Mcgonagall and Hermione, god bless his best friend, who had been so forward in helping him find out answers to his questions.
But he went absolutely crazy when he saw Malfoy crashing the ground in front of him. It was like he himself was attacked. Before that his own emotions were so high on the peak that he could not realize that he was experiencing another set of emotions. However, as he quickly transformed back to his human form, still feeling the tremors of a stunner, he realized that something had changed forever that night.
"Why are you being such a git, Malfoy?"
“I did.” Malfoy answers calm and collected but he too looks around as if in wonder and awe.
Harry, however, is brought out of his rabid thoughts by Malfoy’s next words.
Before he could do something completely regrettable like say something like ‘Don’t worry. You are safe now’, Kreacher comes to save the day.
"Potter, are we really doing this or not? If you have nothing to tell me then why do you keep insisting on meeting me? I can't imagine you seeking my company because I, for one, cannot stand you and I had an impression that the feeling was mutual." Draco meant his words to have a tinge of humour but by the end of it he sounded annoyed even to his own ears. Well there is nothing he can do now.
Not to forget the big elephant in the room. How the hell Potter turned into a wolf? A full bodied wolf in fact and not just someone who inherited certain traits - out of a bite or a  curse - it does not matter. It has to be a curse. There is nothing else that could explain it. There is actually nothing that could explain this whole ordeal - wolf and the marking alike.
“I don’t know”, with such causality it is spoken that Draco, for a second stands there with mouth wide open and a stumped expression.
“You asked ‘why’. What why?” Potter asks finally looking straight at him for the first time during this whole conversation.
Now Draco is intrigued.
When Harry had arrived late for their planned dinner, Hermione had looked at him suspiciously while Ron had given him a stink eye for keeping the man away from his beloved food as harry ran late for their dinner arrangement.
“You will tell me when you are ready.” Ron does not even look at him when he says it with such confidence.
Potter does not answer though. With a heavy sigh as if the question physically pained him, he once again scans the room and Draco almost loses his cool.
Okay. That was not where Draco thought the argument would lead. Why did it end at Draco being asked to reveal something about him? How did Potter even reach that conclusion, all on his own?
Great! Just great! Not only did he mark Draco but it seems like Draco in some weird sense has marked his ownership over his house and the old elf.
Draco never understood, not then nor now, why she was going through so much pain to redeem something which was tarnished to ground. It would have been better to just leave this place and go far away. To live in solitude and in peace where the consequences of their wrong choices, of their mistakes couldn’t chase them. He knew though, deep down, he wouldn’t have survived that kind of life. She might have. But Draco already hated himself so much for being on the wrong side. For letting his father blind him from differentiating right from wrong. She always saw something good in him. Maybe it was the mother in her that made her believe that. But in the end she decided to fight for him because he was not doing it on his own. As he was busy being miserable. The outcomes of his past seventeen years weighing down on him.
“You weren’t there for the meeting when you never skip it so I thought you must have missed the memo and left early. But seeing how you are busy” a pause in which Draco can hear a hundred thousand teasing remarks he would be subjected to in the future and then Padma continues to “I will see you tomorrow”, which is nothing but code words for ‘we are so gonna talk about this tomorrow’.
“I don’t understand. If he stepped back when you called him off. So why is it bothering you so much even now!!!”
Sometimes harry is thankful of these detentions - away from the house and dudley for once even if he has to scrub dirty bathroom floors, nothing he ain’t doing back at home.
Not once they talked about how Draco was saved, or rather by whom. Weasley once again apologized for the stunner and Draco just brushed him off with a wave. He was tired and wanted nothing more than to get out of there.
As they stand in front of the table where food that could sate a whole army has been placed, house-elves really, Draco faces another challenge - where to sit exactly. There is no point in sitting all the way to the other end of the table. If they are gonna talk about what's inevitable it is only reasonable to sit where they can hear each other properly without a dozen or so dishes separating them.
Draco hates ever confiding into her after one too many drinks all those months ago.
“Oh, I bet you do.” She is grinning now and Harry feels cornered so he does the only thing he can think of - to look at his best mate for some help and gets cheated on miserably.
Harry looks a little unsettled about telling the last part. He had never injured someone so badly before during a hunt. Most of the times his team of aurors is always near so the moment he gets the hold of their culprit, the aurors are immediately upon him. But that night, Harry had not been an auror on duty. He had been someone else entirely. Still it does not please him to talk about almost killing someone without any ounce of remorse even if that person was a mass killer himself.
“Ssshhhh.What the hell. Stop screaming. And NO, I am no-not blushing!!! It's just warm in here.”
Draco buries his inner turmoil in a farthest corner when Potter starts to speak again.
Potter seems startled to hear his voice after an extended silence. Draco had gauged the reaction and had manoeuvred his body such that it wouldn't be touching that of the other when the oblivious git spasms like he predicted.
“Okay?” Harry is quick to question not knowing what Ron actually meant by it.
Without Draco’s knowledge his brain had deemed it necessary to ask another question. He knows which ‘why’ he might have meant but is it okay to ask it now. Does he have the authority to ask that of Potter? Will Potter even tell him? But then he remembers how the other has already said so much without him asking. Maybe he wants to tell Draco all of it. And maybe if Draco presented his question nicely and politely, Potter would indulge him with an answer.
He is pushing himself to get up when the sound of twigs breaking catches his attention. If not for the eerily quiet forest, Draco would have missed it.
It is not like he does not want to tell. Anyways, how do you explain something that even you are not sure of? Of Course he does not fucking know why his animagus form is different than his patronus. He doesn't know why it is a wolf too. He also does not know how much power one needs to exhibit to have two completely different species as animagus form and a patronus.
Harry looking for a partner to take to yule ball.
Draco knows that Potter can feel the relief radiating from him but at this point he does not even care what Potter thinks about it. Draco has been so eager and worried sick to know about what happened with that vampire that he has not even slept calmly in last few weeks. None of his co-workers giving him any update on the case was close to making him go crazy. It was need of the hour when he had to turn to Weasley, of all people, for any information. It was a torturous moment, calling back the ginger head to
He should have but don't after that night when he became a victim - last one - too. Head healer must have prohibited him from taking any part in the case thereof. Harry should have realized this sooner. Seeing the look on Malfoy's face, the status of that vampire clearly holds importance to him. Merlin knows how many nightmares the blonde must be having of that night. Harry himself had few. None of which went the way reality did. Every nightmare ending with him thrashing and waking up with a scream. Malfoy must have been worried sick not knowing if the creature was still living, looking for him or dead already. They should have told him sooner.
It was the first day of school and draco had been chilling in the hallways with his troupe when harry had walked past them. To everyone he seemed like a normal boy, to his friends he was another one of those charity cases but to draco...he had not been able to remove his gaze from the green of harry’s eyes. They had trapped him in one glance alone. Draco wanted to know him, wanted to be his friends but the other had refused and ran away from there. Draco has felt humiliated and embarrassed. He had become the laughing stock for everyone for almost two months. Annoyed and frustrated draco had thought nothing before starting to bully harry.
I am sorry if you were waiting for this story, i didn't want to abandon it. But life happened. I had moved to a different country and when I had finally settled a bit, this pandemic happened.
Harry had been so excited to go to school when he first learned about it. The prospect of making new friends and to learn and to just be out of the house and his cupboard had him in glee. But it soon turned out to be his biggest nightmare.
“What makes you think I marked you though? I never completely figured it out. Is it even possible for me to mark you? I don’t feel any different. I don’t feel any kind of bond towards you. Does that not say it might have been something else than marking.”
The noise around ceases to exist. Draco feels like he has stepped in an altogether different dimension where only he and Potter exist. As if gravity pulling him, Draco finds himself moving towards Potter step by step. Potter too seems to be in a similar situation. And within seconds they both are standing too close to each other. They are able to feel each other's body heat and their magic starts to intermingle; producing colorful sparks, and shivers starts to run through both of their bodies.
Draco’s train of thoughts come to an immediate halt when the true meaning behind Ron’s words register into his potions induced mind.
“He was my -”
He is fighting his beast, Draco wonders in astonishment. How powerful Harry must be, to be able to fight his animagus form. A form of a predator too. At a time when his mind is the most vulnerable. When his senses are of a wolf. Draco was thinking all this only when suddenly he feels the similar pain of breaking bones and hears the ear splitting scream. This time it passes quickly and he realises why, as he now stands in front of Potter, back in grimmauld place, his body still hunched over the pensieve and Potter eyeing him with an expression similar to that on his own face.
He couldn’t help but grimace again, watching as Gabrielle gave another great tug at her sister’s hand before finally being let free. He steeled himself as she rammed into his leg again and held tight, her head resting on his hip as if she had not a care in the world.
Luna is always a lot of fun to draw, mostly because I don't typically let myself use a lot of bright colors in my art and she basically just strong-arms me out of that mentality. I've always seen Theo and Luna as a very telling 'polar opposites' couple, which is why in direct conflict with Luna's bright colors I had Theo in mostly beige and browns. This was not only a subtle nod to his elemental magic that will be more touched on in this year (oh boy) but also just how hard he tries to be very structured and, in the end, very bland. (Theo looks so dorky in this drawing whY-)
Harry knows Draco is getting agitated. He is also aware of how he is trying to escape the blonde male’s gaze. There is nothing in the office that interests him, contrary to what Malfoy must be assuming. Nor is Harry trying to search for something. Yeah, if there was a secret passage out of here, he might have been tempted.
Harry is so grateful to have Hermione as a friend and someone who can save him from Ron. But that does not mean he was not worried about her reaction too. She has rather troubled memories of her own with the Malfoys. He hopes she knows that he wouldn't do anything that troubles her. That troubles both of them.
The accusation in Ron’s shout was apparent and it took Harry a minute to realize what just slipped his mouth.
Harry stares with an arched brow not expecting this response from the other. Malfoy does not look like he wants to do this today but his answer speaks otherwise, confusing Harry to no end.
Draco knows a little about marking. It Happens when the beast in you finds someone they deem the most compatible. But there is hardly any compatibility between them. They can’t even stand each other. No more than five minutes and they will be about ready to hex each other into oblivion.
What the hell is he even thinking? Harry questions himself in his head for a minute. And totally forgets that he is still standing in Malfoy’s office with his eyes closed and body tensed while a question is left hanging in the air between the two of them.
It all happens in quick succession - a low dangerous growl, horror-stricken gasps, a flash of magic and then two ruby red spots in the pitch blackness of the surrounding just next to where he stands.
Hermione pauses for a few seconds, looks at Harry with narrowed eyes, shakes her head and then proceed to eat dinner. It takes her only a minute to drop her cutlery and exclaim loudly as she remembers a very important piece of information.
Potter, however, does nothing of sorts. He actually does not even react. Just stares at Draco with a blank expression. It is quite unnerving for Draco to be scrutinized like this. Without being able to predict what exactly Potter is thinking about.
Draco can see how much effort harry is putting in saying those words if the hisses in between are any indication.
Potter must be feeling something too given his expression of extreme discomfort but still he does not let go of Draco's wrist and instead nudges him to sit back down.
"What happened to that vampire?"
The sudden contact sends sparks throughout his body and judging by how quickly Malfoy jerks his away and is looking at Harry wide eyed, he must have felt it too.
“Hi Draco, how do you feel today?”, Healer Padma Patil struts in to his ward with a scarny little intern on her heels.
“Potter, as much as I am greatly surprised by your cryptic talk; if you don’t have anything important to say then I would like to go. If you don’t remember I have just faced a life and death situation.”
“Potter!”
Almost.
Harry does not have to turn around to see whose voice is that - pitchy, snarky, and oh so annoying.
"Harry. Harry. Stop. Listen to us", of course it is Granger who has to try and be the voice of reason everywhere. Draco scoffs at the way Granger tries to reason with a beast, a wolf nonetheless, who is growling at them menacingly. Harry, the wolf, takes one step ahead and the professor casts a protego not at themselves but at the wolf which baffles Draco immensely. Still in this situation, they are trying to protect him from hurting themselves, rather than thinking about their own selves. What kind of a bond is this. Does a friendship of this sort still exist?
Everybody at St. Mungo’s knows how Malfoy is married to his work. Getting him out of the hospital and to go sleep in his actual bed is such a task. When he said he practically lives there, he was
Draco stops then taking in the look on Harry’s face.
Harry has no idea what Malfoy and Padma are talking about but seeing the way Malfoy is all tensed up, it must have been something related to work. Now Harry feels bad for dropping by on such short notice. Maybe he should have waited till Malfoy was off duty or on his leave day. But truth be told, he had no patience left to just sit still and not find out about what was going on. He is feeling a strange mix of emotions towards the blonde, which are not different from what he felt for the healer during school days but there is this underlying overwhelmness that Harry can’t pinpoint where it is coming from.
“weird. What the Hell Gin! I felt weird.” He does not let her speak this time and continues.
