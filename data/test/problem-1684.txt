still familiar. The boy had stopped screaming, looking up at Harry with wide eyes and a trembling lower lip.
Draco pulled away long enough to mumble something about bed and stairs, so Harry let himself be led out of the kitchen, up a flight of stairs, and down a hall to Draco's bedroom.  He noted little more than the windows before his eyes focused on the bed.  It was a large bed covered with a quilt in greens and blues.  It looked surprisingly wholesome and comfortable.  The quilt must have held some value to Draco, because he carefully folded it and set it aside before carelessly shoving the rest of the bedding down.
There was a surprising warmth in Draco's eyes.  "Yes."  His eyes sharpened and his lips quirked up.  "Unless you stay over and make it unnecessary."
As Harry watched, the woman lifted the child, kissed his cheek, and passed him to Draco. Draco took the child and kissed him as well before turning a beaming smile on the woman. On his wife. Because surely that was who the woman was. Draco’s wife. The mother of his child.
“Well then book me for arriving Wednesday night. I’d like some time to enjoy the place before the circus arrives.”
The knife clattered to the counter before Potter span around to stare at Draco with dark eyes and pink cheeks. His lips were wet and slightly parted leaving Draco no choice but to kiss him. Potter's hands grabbed at his shirt, pulling him close with a desperation Draco hadn't expected.
Aamu had worried. She knew Kauko could not call down the lady alone. When Aamu was younger, she would have wanted to intervene or wondered if she should have done more. As a young girl, Aamu had given in to regret. But she is wiser now. Her visions are not for her to help. She was too far away to help Kauko, and he needed to see Mehiläinen for himself. Aamu worried, but she waited and watched. That is her role: to see.
“We can do a lot with this,” Malfoy was murmuring and then he brandished his wand again. Harry instinctively put his hand in front of his groin, and Malfoy laughed. It was a rich, clear sound free of any malice, and it sent a shiver down Harry’s spine. “I’m not going to Vanish any more clothing. In fact, I’m going to Summon some.” With a swish and flick, a pair of jeans and a t-shirt came floating over. “Here. If you want casual,
Then Charlie said a name that caught his attention completely.  Harry hadn’t been paying enough attention to understand the context, but it must have been interesting as Charlie was now laughing at Ron’s gaping mouth.  Hermione had her own lips pressed together in a little line the way she did when she was processing new information.
A rush of anger went through Harry as he thought about the sadistic siblings who had terrorised the one place Harry thought would always be safe. He hadn’t considered Malfoy being a target, but the Carrows might have enjoyed bullying Draco once Lucius fell out of favour. The very thought made him want to punch something. He pushed his anger aside and focused on Malfoy instead. He couldn’t change the past, but he could offer support now.
"Does this mean there will be no more unannounced visits to my home?" She sounded far too smug. She was
Harry hadn’t even realized Draco was still in the country. Lucius had been killed a few years before, immediately following his release from Ministry custody. A vigilante had cast a Blasting Curse at him so strong it had exploded a large section of the Ministry Atrium around him, seriously injuring several people including Narcissa. When Draco never visited her in St Mungo’s, Harry had assumed Draco had fled the country before the attack.
He was sitting on the grass outside the Burrow. A cup was pressed into his hand, and he took it and drank without thinking.
Harry pushed open the large oak door and stepped out of the castle. A cold breeze met him, rustling his hair and pinking his cheeks. As he pulled his cloak tighter around himself, he conceded that he should have listened to Hermione and worn a hat. But time was an issue.
'And we often woke up on the couch with serious neck cramps.' Harry thought it was hilarious how his pure-blood friends fell for Muggle television and couldn't resist watching it late into the night. 'Besides, Draco
When they had finally met again, Potter had simply stared at him.  The man had moved his mouth a few times but not spoken.  When Draco told Pansy about it, she had done that snort-laugh that she thought was endearing and he thought made her sound like a pig.  She had then commented that Potter's reaction wasn't surprising given that, “the last time he saw you, you were all skeletal and grey.”
“Um...Potter? Can you …” What? Did he trust Potter to just close his eyes or should he make him leave the room? Surely Potter wouldn’t look. Why would he want to? Draco felt himself bristle at the thought of Potter not wanting to look. Draco was rather fit, after all. “Turn your head.”
The only thing about the Burrow that didn't bring Draco peace of mind was the frequent visits by Harry Potter. Seeing Potter made Draco's body fall apart: his skin felt too small, his fingers fumbled over everything, and his stomach was suddenly full of doxies. Potter was perfectly civil, but there was a palpable tension between them. Draco couldn't talk to Potter without his tongue becoming heavy and slow, so he would talk to anyone else in the room. Potter soon gave up trying to engage Draco in conversation and started to just
"Maybe." Draco smiled to himself at getting to tease Potter, especially when he felt the warm huff against his neck.
He reached Hagrid’s hut and felt a brief pang for how little he had seen his friend this year. They were both so busy: Hagrid with rebuilding the war-torn grounds and Harry with studies he had never fully focused on before. Looking at the hut, he noted the places that had been rebuilt and the scorch marks from when it had been set aflame. There was still work to be done, but Hagrid had clearly put the rest of Hogwarts before his own home. The puffs of smoke billowing out of the chimney suggested that Hagrid was home. Harry was there and undistracted by classes, as it was Saturday, but Harry turned away.
'Fuck, Harry. Oh. Gonna . . .' Draco was falling apart, sounding mindless and euphoric, and it was entirely Harry's doing.
"And you're in denial," she shot back. "What is it about Harry that turns you off? The jewel-like eyes? The toned body? Maybe it's that brilliant smile." She arched a brow in challenge. "And don't even
Draco's world ground to a halt. Potter doesn't shag? Doesn't any more or never had? Doesn't do anal or doesn't do
Harry still couldn't say that he liked dancing, but he loved the last dance with Draco. Many of the attendees had already left for their early bedtimes or to relieve the sitters watching their children, and the first notes of the slow ballad sent another wave—mainly young singles—running for the nightclubs.
with it?" Creepy Dark rituals came to mind, and Draco began pacing the small room as he wondered what Claudius might hope to gain from his heart. Did Claudius really believe that ingesting the heart of a—
Harry closed his eyes under the warm, albeit sticky, weight of Draco’s body on his chest.  When he opened them, his room was dark and Draco was gone.
Harry glanced around the room.  There were two other couples sat at tables, but Harry had yet to see any sign of a waiter.  He glanced back at Draco in time to see him roll his eyes.  “Point your wand at what you want.”  Harry arched an eyebrow and Draco mirrored the expression.
"Not usually, no. Not since Ernie, and that was mainly just curiosity about … well about kissing a boy. This was—is—about … you. You aren't like the others: wanting to talk about Voldemort or when I'll be Minister."
"I didn't want you to think I didn't know what I was doing. But apparently I didn't do a great job of winging it." Draco’s face felt hot as he confessed and he wanted to bury it in Potter’s pillow.
Harry pulled back and gave Malfoy a saucy smile. “Let me try again.” This time he took Malfoy’s cock in hand and swallowed as much as he could. The velvet heat felt right against his tongue, but he stopped when he felt the head hit his throat. He wanted to swallow Malfoy completely, but the risk of gagging kept him cautious and he put his hand to use instead.
He reached for Draco's half-opened shirt, but Draco stepped back. Draco undid his fly and pulled out his long, hard cock. It was dark pink and almost red at the wet head, and Harry's first impulse was to lick it. His mouth filled with saliva, and he decided that perhaps sucking cock would come as naturally to him as flying had. Yes, he definitely liked men. Or at least Draco.
They packed their trunks and left them for the elves to collect. Kreacher appeared with breakfast and Harry passed Draco the fruit bowl before serving himself.
Draco made a choked sound which might have been a laugh or a sob, and then he buried his face in her hair as he hugged her.
His smile faded when Flintridge rested his hand on Draco's arm and Draco didn't shake it off. Jealous heat flared up in Harry's chest until even his cheeks burned. He glared at the offending hand, but it stayed rooted to Draco's body.
“He’s pining for Zhi, but she either doesn’t know or doesn’t care,” came Draco’s commentary, this time with the pretence of looking past Harry at something on the wall.
She eyed him warily. "And in return?" Ah, she did know him better than anyone else. Except his mother. Narcissa was clairvoyant.
Draco wasn't sure if it was his bad luck or Potter's that landed their study group in quarantine. It wasn't Patil's; her life seemed quite dull.
Malfoy pulled back to meet his eye. His features were sharp, but the little smile that curved his lips was warm. “It think we needed the time, Potter.” He cocked his head and smirked. “And why should the holidays be torture? If you are implying you will miss me, wizards have invented this wonderful thing called the Floo network.”
"I'll keep fighting," Potter promised, and Draco didn't know why he cared. Draco cared—more than he should—by why did Potter? And maybe he really didn't. Maybe that is why Draco is still in his cell.
Kensa was facing him and showed only a moment of annoyance at his interruption before she recognised him and changed completely. “Oh, Mr Potter! Yes, can you believe it? How is it allowed? How can such a vile man be allowed to run a hotel? He’s ruining my brother’s wedding!”
“I was really impressed with your report on the case,” Potter went on, “Even Ron was saying how great you were, and he's not usually your biggest fan.”
"Two weeks left," Potter said in his ear. When Draco twisted around, Potter was smiling at him. "Buy you a drink?"
Harry forced himself to smile in a reassuring way. “I’ve known Draco since I was eleven years old, and I can assure you the guests of the hotel are in no danger from him. In fact, my friends Ron and Hermione are already planning their next trip there.”
"Ginny would do it for me. You could probably even stay in her room." Draco raised an eyebrow to show how unlikely it was that he would be permitted to sleep in the bedroom of the only Weasley girl. "Oh, come one. You're as gay as a pink balloon. You are clearly no threat to her virtue. As for why they'd take you in … you still playing housewife?"
“Uh…” The caller sounded confused. Or was he recognising Draco’s voice. Hopefully not! “I, um, I haven’t made one yet. That’s why I’m calling.”
Harry nodded, feeling a rush of shame that he'd been so blind to what was right in front of him. 'I think she was justified.'
Draco pulled both fingers out and held them against his chest as if they'll been burned. Potter collapsed his legs so that he was almost curled up on the bed with his face to his knees. Had Draco hurt him? Of course he had! Potter had cried out in pain. Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. What was Draco thinking? He wasn't the one to save Potter. Draco had never saved anyone. He wasn't a hero.
A cool hand slid against his cheek and pulled him from his fevered thoughts. “Potter? Do you want to know?” Malfoy looked smug and delicious, and Harry’s cock was hard just from being so close to him. Of course Harry wanted to know if Malfoy was as affected as he was! He nodded, and Malfoy’s smile cracked into a feral grin. “Well, then.” The hand on Harry’s cheek dropped to Harry’s shoulder and gently pressed down.
The way Sothman's eyes gleamed, Draco really wished Clearwater would not encourage him to find uses for Draco.  “Yes, Calinda,” Sothman said, “I'm sure I'll find Draco very accommodating.”  Draco fought down his revulsion as Clearwater smiled in her ignorance.
“Well the next group should be easier,” Charlie said.  “Researchers from the European Magical Creatures Institute.  You should know one of them,” he looked to Harry, “Luna Lovegood, remember her?”
“You’re just a snob, Draco. These aren’t your posh French things. These are proper Cornish saffron buns, or they
He began stroking Harry with slow, sure strokes. “Look how you fill my hand, Harry. God, I need both hands.” He reverently added a second hand, his eyes now locked on the space between them where his hands moved in tandem.
Did he really think Harry held a grudge after all this time? Well, Harry would put right to that. “How is Park—Pansy these days? I heard she didn’t return to Hogwarts.”
Aamu has never had a child, but she has felt the fear of a mother for her child before. She knows what the pale woman fears.
On Wednesday, Potter showed up all but shaking with anger, and Draco's curiosity overcame his stubbornness. "Break your favourite quill?" he drawled with feigned indifference.
Harry smirked as he pulled Malfoy’s trousers and pants down to his ankles, freeing his erection for Harry to see. It was exactly like every other bit of Malfoy: long, pale, beautiful, and prone to blushing. The tip was almost red and it glistened with a single drop of pre-come. Harry nuzzled against it, feeling the smear of wetness on his cheek.
Harry teased Draco that he was becoming like Dumbledore, taking in those the Ministry deemed unemployable or undesirable. Draco threw a tomato at him for the comment and then made him scrape the pulpy mass from his face into the chicken bucket so it didn’t go to waste. Harry didn’t minded too much.
Potter had the decency to blush.  “No, last night was—I was exhausted , what with the tailing and the stake outs . . .”
Harry’s mind revisited the two kisses he’d enjoyed so far and imagined kissing his way along Draco’s jaw and down his throat. Inhaling that surprisingly earthy scent from someone so polished and put-together. His hands would come up to the top buttons of that shirt and begin opening his collar.
It was still Draco's fault. If he had more experience he would know how to help Potter relax. He'd make it feel good. "I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm sorry."
children, not just Muggle-born. My parents were magical, but I didn't even know magic was real until my eleventh birthday!"
He climbed onto the bed between Draco's legs and lowered himself over him.  After indulging in more kissing, he asked about lube.  A small vial was thrust in his hands and he briefly wondered where Draco kept it to have it to hand so quickly.  The thought disappeared among more urgent thoughts of Draco's smell and taste when he kissed him.
When Mielikki has left, Aamu brings Tuisku his supper. She strokes his fur and tells him that Kauko will leave soon.
Draco was taken to a holding cell where he stripped and put on the grey robes of an Azkaban prisoner. He took one last breath of freedom and then an Auror pressed his hand to a Portkey. Leading him into the prison, the Auror had taunted him about the living arrangements not being what he was used to, but Draco said nothing. He simply followed the Auror and an Azkaban guard to his cell, laid down on the bench that was to act as his bed, and had his first restless night of sleep.
The man from Improper Use certainly did. He kept pushing forward and saying things that Draco clearly did not want to hear. Harry felt his body tense, but held himself back. Draco could handle his own and wouldn't thank him if he made a scene.
Draco looked down and realised he was still fully dressed. He flushed at being caught staring as Potter undressed and quickly stripped down to his own boxers. Once Draco removed his shirt, Potter removed his own to show that he was surprisingly toned for his someone so slender. He wasn't bulky, but there was a strength to his torso and arms that matched his natural intensity.
“The Silver Lining. The only place a wizard should ever buy Muggle clothing.”  He gestured toward the dark shop with the excitement of a father whose child had just made a Hogwarts Quidditch team. “The places in Diagon sell some Muggle stuff, but it’s always horribly out of date. And you can obviously go to a regular Muggle place, but then you have to do all the tailoring charms yourself, and I can never get the wizarding space right for a wand pocket.
Harry recognised the name of Draco’s hotel, confirming what he already knew. Despite Harry’s assurances to Ron, the bad press about the hotel had not dried up and gone away in two weeks. While Rita Skeeter had only written two more stories directly about the hotel, she had managed to find little ways to reference Draco and his hotel in other stories. She had written that the new head of St Mungo’s was as fit to run a hospital as a Malfoy was to run a hotel. Every scathing attack at the
"That night … the morning after. The French paper came, and it had a picture of you and Scorpius and your wife, and I just assumed—"
“Are you talking about me, Draco?” The woman asked, confirming Harry’s suspicion that this must be Aida.
Hearing the word “sex” from Draco’s lips sent Harry’s mind in all the wrong directions. He needed to focus on the farm and keeping Draco safe. They dismounted their brooms and hid them in a hedge with some charms for good measure. It would be safer to approach on foot, but Harry didn’t want to risk the brooms being discovered and giving them away.
"Yes, Potter. I know what a three-legged race is." Draco was reluctantly grateful to Vane that he wouldn't have to admit ignorance in front of Potter.
Kauko works hard. He is eager to learn, but not greedy. Mielikki tells her of his progress. He watches Antero and listens. He tries some things in their tongue and some in his own. He is following Antero’s path and will be able to heal like him with time.
“So?  It's not like you need the job or the measly pay that comes with it.”  Draco knew that Blaise resented having to work for the Ministry.  His mother married for money and rarely worried about that money making it to any of her children.  The fact that she had gotten him an easy job with the Wizengamot that came with power and benefits did nothing to diminish his bitterness about having to work at all.
Draco’s face shuttered and his haughty aloofness returned. “Fine.” He turned sharply and strode off with his ponytail swinging behind him like the tail of a petulant Siamese cat.
“A civilian expert who can recognise the plants we are looking for. You wouldn’t know Squib’s Friend from Bellis Perennis, especially in the winter when they aren’t flowering.”
This was the time to run to the bedroom. This was the time to leave. It wasn’t fatal, just uncomfortable. Potter would be fine on his own.
"Good morning, sleepyhead." Draco dropped a kiss onto Harry's brow. "Room service coffee is dreadful here. I'll pop out and get us something real. Feel free to sleep."
It was all a bit surreal. Had no one ever initiated conversation with Potter before, or was he just particularly receptive to Draco? Draco would like to think that it was his superior skills in linguistics.
Draco led Potter away from the dining room and down the stairs to the main entrance hall. From there they walked toward Rosamund’s kitchen until they reached the stretch of bare wall leading to the North Wing. Draco was excited to see Potter’s reaction as he placed his hand on the wall to make the passageway appeared. Potter didn’t disappoint: his eyes widened and he let out a small gasp.
"I want your big cock in me.  I want you to fill me up and make me scream.  Press inside me and make me take you.  All of you."
He considered discussing the Shaw case, but it wasn't safe to discuss an open case in public, even in a Muggle establishment.  In the end, he brought up Quidditch, and they discussed the British club teams until their pies were brought out.  He was nervous about whether Draco would like such common Muggle food, but a comment about the tenderness of the lamb and the delicacy of the sauce calmed Harry immensely.
Of course that was what he took from the story. “Well, it was easy to call you Malfoy when it was just you at school, but when the news about the attack…” Harry realised perhaps bringing up the gruesome murder of Draco’s father was not the right choice for a walk in the country. They had crossed the field to where it tumbled down to the sea. Best not to upset Draco when there was a convenient cliff to be shoved off.
“Clearwater is gone.  Off to Venice on a glorified vacation.  It's Sothman, now.”  Draco congratulated himself for saying the man's name without shuddering
Harry felt his brow drop. Why could Malfoy be interested in Hermione's work with house-elf and werewolf legislation? It couldn't be out of support, so it couldn't be good. "What of it?"
Wide eyes came up to meet Draco's. "Really? You don't think I'm mad for walking away from the Aurors?" There was something just shy of awe in his voice.
Given Parkinson's possessive friendship with Draco, Harry wasn't surprised when—within minutes of Draco returning home in shock—Parkinson had dragged the guest of honour away from the party Harry had planned for him.
Once dressed in what he hoped was a respectable outfit, he looked at the clock ticking merrily on the wall. Four hours to go. He stripped out of his clothes again and stomped off to the bathroom. He could do with a long soak.
A shout from the side caused them all to freeze. It came again, and Harry realised it was Draco calling for his son. The man must be worried sick. The boy could not be more than three or four and had vanished completely from the playground. Harry yelled back. "He’s here, Draco. He’s safe." He increased the power of his Lumos and raised it overhead.
“Honestly! What’s the use of wizarding space if you still have to squeeze your dick into tight trousers?” Malfoy gestured to his own crotch, and Harry’s eyes obediently followed. “The material lies flat to give the look, but then you can hang free. Without a charm, Muggles have to chose a side and have their dick smashed against their leg. And if they get an erection…” He looked as if he couldn’t bear to continue the thought.
Astoria lifted his chin with her hand. "Give people time, Draco. They haven’t seen you in years. They don’t know who you are now." Her soft eyes sharpened. "I suspect few of them really knew you then."
Luna’s group was staying the whole summer, so they alternated between time in the field and times at the research centre in Bârlog.  Draco remained slightly awkward with Luna, but he seemed quite close with another member of the team named Rolf.  Harry tried not to hate Rolf each time they went into the field and Draco glued himself to the other blond wizard.
When Charlie had asked about his good mood, Harry had happily gushed about his much-anticipated date.  Charlie had listened with a thoughtful look that made Harry worry.
It was a cold wet day, and the Burrow felt lonely. The constant din of falling rain was worse than silence, and no amount of tea could warm his bones. A knock sounded on the door, and Draco was almost grateful for the reminder that he was not alone in the world. He was surprised, of course, because it was too early for anyone to be dropping by for lunch.
"Not really my thing." Draco kept his tone casual but his pronunciation clear. It was essential that Potter realise Draco was interested in men if he were to have any hope of picking up on Draco's flirtations when they entered Phase Four. Potter wasn't good at subtlety.
Merlin.  No wonder Draco was a naturalist!  A cock like that should never be covered.  Even flaccid, it was long and thick. Harry clenched his arse reflexively.  A cock like that would fill him up.  It would burn, even with stretching and plenty of lube.  It would push Harry to the line between pleasurable pain and agony, have him soaked in sweat as he fought the panic of feeling ripped apart as Malfoy fucked him open.
“Well eat up.  We've only twenty minutes before those of us who work on the clock have to be at the Ministry.”
Mother ignored her as she pushed a piece of okra onto her fork to better examine. “What is this, even?” She sniffed it warily. “I smell peanuts.”
Yet once Harry and Draco had started to become friends, she had grown hostile again for no reason Harry could discover. He wondered if he'd accidentally offended her or if she was simply jealous of how close he'd become with
!  There is no defying that witch once she’s set her mind on something.  Anyway, I attended my classes, ate quickly at meals, and studied in Granger’s room or my own bed.  And as soon as I’d graduated, I left the country.”
“Voldemort did mark Draco’s arm. That was confirmed by the Aurors when collecting information to decide whether to press charges against him. It was also confirmed Draco was a schoolboy and a legal minor and in no position to refuse.”
be there, right?" Draco had all but memorised three different sex manuals and was eager to begin Phase Two: Infiltration.
"Wouldn't it be a bit … crowded?" He'd heard the Weasleys lived in a tiny hovel. "And why would they even take me in?"
Hermione was very sympathetic to his plight and arranged for him to be able to work from home. She brought him every file and document he needed from the Ministry and filled him in on each meeting he missed. His supervisor didn't seem to care so long as Hermione was checking in on him and the reports were being done. Draco had actually grown rather fond of spreading his paperwork across the large kitchen table and having the kettle to hand for easy tea refills. It was warmer, cosier, and quieter than his cramped Ministry office.
"Hey, hey." Potter stepped forward with his hands up in a placating gesture. "I didn't say you. I mean, I didn't use your name."
He was torn from his thoughts when Draco reached the top of the stair and pushed open the wood door to his spacious bedroom.  He had only a moment to take in the large white bed before Draco was on him.  Hot kisses peppered his lips before deepening into a passionate kiss of tongue and teeth.  Harry focused on undressing them both, desperate to feel the other man's skin against his own.
you, and given that he advised I write 'Death Eater Scum' in your blood to throw the Aurors off the scent, there is a good chance he was behind your father's death."
In addition to dividing chores well, they actually got along as well.  When Draco returned from the field in the evenings, they would join the team at the inn for dinner and then retreat back to their own flat for a quiet evening of reading, Gobstones, and occasionally conversation.
Pansy was nodding, but it was the humouring type and not a sign of agreement. "You are overlooking some differences between you and Macmillan that might be relevant. Macmillan was a war hero. He was in Harry's little club in fifth-year.
It was not long before Harry found himself eating where Malfoy ate and reading every article with even a casual mention of any Malfoy.  And it was the results of that informal investigation—he was not stalking—that led to Malfoy becoming Draco.  At least in his mind.
Harry looked back at Ron and saw the little furrow of concern on his brow. He understood. Perhaps the dignitary thought the dance would lead to something. Perhaps he viewed dancing as foreplay. It didn't matter. Draco would correct any misconceptions.
Malfoy was sat between two elderly women who seemed completely charmed by him. They were all blushes and giggles, and Harry wished he were closer to hear what Malfoy was saying. He hardly noticed the waiters topping up his wine again and again as he watched.
Harry wanted to ask that they eat in the sunroom—casual sounded more his style—but he’d told Draco he would eat where he was told and he didn’t want to suddenly become difficult.
Potter was quiet for the rest of the practice as his small mind tried to formulate a cunning plan. Draco hoped he didn't hurt himself.
Harry felt his face flush as he wondered if he could indeed die of mortification.  He was currently lying flat on his back, completely frozen with a pink dildo still fucking his hole.  “Stop,” he instructed the dildo in a broken voice.  The dildo stopped and Harry fumbled to pull it out.  His face burned with his humiliation.
Harry felt a new wave of blood flood his cheeks, but he refused to look away.  There was no point denying it now.  “Yes.”
“Another?” She held up his empty wine glass.  Draco considered just going home, but the lamb really was exceptional.  He nodded and she filled his glass.  As he listened to the lively folk songs playing from some hidden source and ate the perfectly cooked pie, he could almost understand why Potter spent so much time there.
Draco ignored the tiny voice, focused entirely on getting the horrible taste from his mouth. He spat out the offending mass onto his hand. It was a piece of apple so rotten it was black. He flinched and it fell to the grass.
Harry beamed, pleased to have stolen Draco's attention so easily. Draco had not only dislodged Flintridge's hand, he all but had his back to him. Harry rested his hand on Draco's shoulder, effectively barring Flintridge with his arm.
“Harry?” The spell left him and he relaxed against the dirt. His head and shoulder hurt from where he’d fallen against a raised tree root, and his ribs flared up again to remind him they hadn’t been treated.
“What happens to the food that isn’t good enough,” Harry asked as Aida sorted grapes, putting misshapen, squashed, or moldy ones into a bucket.
With his eyes closed, Draco gave himself over to the heat and firmness of the body in his arms. Potter made tiny gasps whenever Draco squeezed his arse or thrust their groins together. When they closed their lips in their kiss, they made a smacking sound that sent a shiver down Draco's spine.
Draco would probably look better in  Harry’s jeans and T-shirt than Harry did in his dress robes. Harry could just imagine the soft material of his well-worn shirt draped over Draco’s broad shoulders and clinging to his chest and flat stomach. The jeans would probably ride low on Draco’s hips, teasing Harry that they might slip lower at any moment.
Potter scrunched his face in thought. "It's kind of like a plate you throw and catch, but it's made of plastic."
Draco shot him a condescending look. “I’m not saying I joined Granger’s elf club or anything. I can see you looking all self-righteous. I still don’t agree with freeing house-elves. Bippy sobbed for a month when I freed her, and the others just moped around. Aunt Gwenna hasn’t been able to free her elf Totty because he refuses to take anything from her hand anymore. We only freed the poor things to keep the Ministry away once Granger started passing legislation. We knew the Ministry would still love to lock me up for something.”
But hadn't he already done so?  Didn't he trust Harry to pull him out of the Fiendfyre and out of Azkaban?  And he'd come through.  He'd saved Draco from death and imprisonment.  So didn't it make sense that Harry would be the one to save him from loneliness?  Because he had been alone.  He hadn't even realised how much so until Harry filled that space in his life, and he couldn't bear to imagine Harry leaving again.
It was that last word that gave Harry his courage. That complex syllable with all its little sounds uttered so easily, as if it were a genuine, non-repulsive option for them.
“No. No risk of that. I love Ron, but only in a brotherly sort of way.” Potter stared for a moment, while Draco pretended to look at his book. “And you? Are you pining for one of your friends?”
Draco had worried that his mother would be arrested as well, but Potter had made certain her name was cleared. The
“Well given your talent for finding trouble, I suppose it’s best to keep an eye on you. You never made it through a year of school without nearly dying, and a dead Harry Potter is the last thing Hotel Kalmynsi needs right now. Rita Skeeter might actually die of happiness.”
The circumstances of his arrival in Cornwall had not been pleasant. The moment his mother had woken in St Mungo’s, still covered in her husband’s blood, she had ordered her house-elf to find Draco and take him to his Great Aunt Gwenna. Draco hadn’t seen his mother until she was released from St Mungo’s weeks later, so it had fallen to Gwenna to tell him of his father’s murder and then hold him while he wept. Gwenna had never been close to her nephew—she and Lucius disagreed on almost everything—but she found words of comfort for the son who grieved him.
He kept walking until he felt something warm and soft on his lips. He tasted tart berries and felt his heart flutter. The next step fell through the ground.
In the evenings, Harry set up his Auror files on an unused desk in the library and worked quietly as Draco researched recipes or simply read for pleasure. Harry was always there, a reassuring presence as stable and warm of the stone walls of Manerji Kalmynsi herself. He was part of what made it Draco’s home.
Harry glared as Draco burrowed deeper into the bedding. 'Fine. Git.' He stood up and threw on a t-shirt and slippers.
In the mornings Draco woke to the sound of Potter hogging the shower and would squirm in his bed until he finally had access to the toilet. He wanted to teach Potter a lesson on bathroom sharing, but something about Potter and lavatories always reminded him how close Potter came to killing him. He could hold his tongue for a couple of weeks. He’d had two years of practice.
"Nah. The Hex was enough for me. The drink is for helping with my promotion."  He raised his hand and gestured to the Abbott witch who kept bar with Tom
Harry turned to face his friend and then turned back to Draco to see what Ron saw. Draco was dancing with a Czech dignitary. The man was tall and handsome, and clearly an accomplished dancer. He kept pace with Draco perfectly, and Harry saw the delight on Draco's face to be able to challenge himself.
Harry Flooed in to the village pub, gratefully noticed that the only two people—naked people—were at the far end of the room, and sprinted for the door.  Outside was a dirt road with a hedge on the other side.  And no people!  He turned left, as Luna had instructed, and ran away from the village.
The cottage wasn't huge, so it didn't take long for Harry to find them; their tenses voices were coming from the small room crammed with bookshelves that Draco teasingly called their library. Having found them, however, Harry couldn't decide whether to interrupt or let Draco fend for himself. It was Draco's party, and he could leave if he wanted to. Undecided, Harry stopped behind the door to listened.
Potter let Draco have the first shower even though he must have felt disgusting, coated in sweat and germs. While Potter had his shower, Kreacher appeared and changed both of their bedding.
—had been out drinking and dancing? Was she home minding their child like a dutiful wife, never questioning her husband's intentions?
"Back off, Malfoy," came a woman's voice. Abbott was back and, despite her words, she was smiling. "He's quite satisfied without your cock, thank you."
"Harry!"  She ran down and hugged him, and he was so focused on Malfoy that he was spared the awkwardness of being hugged by a very naked friend.  She noticed his lack of attention and turned toward Malfoy.  "Oh, you've met Draco.  Well, of course you
Draco's eyes widened, but movement drew Harry's eyes to his lips. Lips. Pink, soft-looking lips. Clever lips slightly parted in surprise at Harry's words. Oh, Merlin. Harry wanted to kiss him. Not just in some memory from a romantic moon-lit beach. He wanted to kiss Draco right there against their sitting room wall and never stop. Giddiness and relief rushed through him as he slowly regained confidence in his own feelings.
Potter looked him in the eyes. “It was really decent of you, looking after me and all. You didn’t have to. You could have ignore me as I’d been ignoring you, but you didn’t. You helped.”
“Merryn,” Draco interrupted. “We would like to eat the fabulous sole while it is still warm.” Merryn turned her head so Gabby Yarn wouldn’t be able to see her sticking her tongue out at him. Draco had to be the adult as Gabby had a clear view of his face. He smiled benignly and said, “please tell Aida it has all been fantastic.” More quietly he added, “and you don’t need to tell her she’s too old for you because she already knows.”
They continued as usual—eating, drinking, and discussing neutral topics—until they finished their first round of after dinner drinks.
Harry tried to hide his panic as he wondered how long he was expected to stay Malfoy's prisoner.  "Malfoy, it's—"  He stopped when he saw the hard look on Malfoy's face.
Draco bit back any commentary about Potter acting as chaperone to adults who were afraid to have their wedding in the home of a Death Eater. As much as he hated having Potter save him once again, he knew not to turn away help when it was desperately needed. And it wasn’t like Draco wasn’t already completely indebted to Potter. What harm could more debt do?
constellation,” she explained in that voice of hers that made Harry think she really ought to be a professor at some point; she was McGonagall’s natural successor.  “His name
Potter shrugged as if unsure his words held any weight, and Draco looked away so Potter wouldn't see that they did.
What would Draco's cock look like? Was it long and thin like Draco's build? Was it as pale as Draco's stomach or did it flush deep red like Draco's cheeks when he was embarrassed. Harry wanted to see it and touch and taste it until he knew it far better than his own, and wasn't that a surprising realisation for a man of almost twenty-one whose romantic history consisted of snogging two girls years before? He wondered how Draco would look when he came and hated that there was anything about Draco he didn't know.
Draco didn’t know what Ribena was, but he was pretty sure it was not crème de cassis. It was probably English, Muggle, and cheap. Instead of arguing, he simply raised his own apéritif in toast and took pride in the sounds of delight Potter made as he drank. Clearly not “like Ribena”.
The woman walks a long hallway made of cold stone. There are tapestries hanging between portraits of scowling faces surrounded by gold. The room is cold with great evil and the woman fears it. She wrings her hands and worries, but it is not for her own safety.
Draco lapped at his cock and then sucked it down again with an excitement he usually reserved for éclairs. Oh, fuck. Harry would never be able to watch Draco eat an éclair again. At least not in public. It was the image of Draco sucking the crème out of his favourite pastry that had Harry coming in Draco's mouth.
They exchanged awkward greetings and sat together at the one set table Draco had been fuss—preparing. Draco’s trouser’s had barely touched the velvet seat before Merryn came gliding in with two champagne flutes. Potter stared at the pink bubbly liquid with a childlike curiosity. Draco was glad he’d told Aida to keep it simple if Potter was looking at a Kir Royale as if it were new and amazing.
Harry could kiss him! Avoiding electricity would dramatically limit where the plant could be grown. Okay, maybe he would want to kiss Draco even if the man had brought him terrible news. But he hadn’t.
Well that was romance taken care of. Draco should have known better than to try to romance a Gryffindor. It was like trying to debate with a Ravenclaw or being kind to a Hufflepuff. This was Potter's area.
reviewing the No Muggleborn Left Behind paperwork, even thought we have another week before it goes in front of the Wizengamot!' Draco spoke in a way that might convince someone other than Harry that it was out of character for him to devote a Saturday night to work. Draco lived for his job with the Office of Magical Law Review and Reform, and the relaxed set of Draco's shoulders as he spoke again assured Harry that whatever was troubling Draco was not related to work.
Luckily, Malfoy didn’t seem to mind. He smiled as he led Harry to the Floo. “Keep the clothes you’re wearing. You finally look like an adult.” His brow lowered as he frowned. “I shouldn’t have Vanished your old clothes. I should have put them on trial for crimes against humanity and then
They spent the morning flying over the nearby countryside under strong Disillusionment Spells. Despite Draco being as blue as the surrounding sky, Harry always knew where he was; his presence was too powerful to be masked by any spell. They raced and tried to outdo each other's manoeuvres as they flew over pastures of oblivious cows and sheep.
“Hello, Gabby. What are you doing here?” Potter sounded annoyed but not angry. This Gabby must not be the
Out of the tunnel, he could see the landscape slope upward into a wooded area. Draco was stirring on his shoulder, but Harry ran until he reached the woods.
With their excuses established, Harry happily followed Draco back to the hotel. When they entered the front door, Draco didn’t turn down the hall toward the kitchen Harry had found him in, but instead began to ascend the grand staircase. Draco noticed his gaze and explained the hotel had three kitchens.
we did not know about before."  His eyes bore into Harry, who shifted his stance to put Luna between them.
When Potter had finished binding their legs from ankle to knee, he stood up. They were so close that there wasn't room for their arms between them.
Harry continued to stroke Draco’s hair to Draco’s mumbled protests over something or other until those bleary grey eyes finally fell shut and Draco’s breathing deepened as he slept. Then Harry tiptoed back to the kitchen to finish baking a mountain of sweets that would turn Scorpius and Teddy into sugar monsters.
By the time the sun was high in the sky, Harry was hungry and his body was feeling stiff and cold from the hours of flying. They had seen plenty of farms, but they had all been Muggle. He saw a village in the distance and gestured to Draco to land in a field. The Notice-Me-Not Charms prevented Muggles from seeing them flying overhead, but the Charm wasn’t strong enough for Muggles not to notice them landing in front of them.
Patil looked alarmed as she was handed a case of potions and told she’d be locked away with Abbott for two weeks. “But I’m not a Healer!”
He tried not to let any amusement into his voice as he contemplated how to proceed. He could admit to having made plenty of mistakes in his young life, but he was wise enough to learn from them. One thing he had learned was no good came from fighting against Potter. If Leah Bronstein and Potter wanted Potter on site for the wedding, then Potter would be there no matter what Draco said or did.
They returned to the kitchen, where Harry noticed his wand.  He'd simply left it on the sideboard as Draco had led him upstairs.  Clearly he trusted Draco more than he'd realised.  Draco poured more wine and offered Harry cheese and crackers with a comment about keeping up his strength.
Draco's brow scrunched together as if he were decoding something cryptic.  “You want to come to Vienna and go to balls that even I find tedious?  You don't even like Ministry balls where everyone speaks English and your friends are there.”
In the next room, Draco found his great aunt and mother seated at the large Elizabethan dining table that had once dominated Malfoy Manor’s second dining room and was now placed so closely to the sideboard Draco wouldn’t be able to fit into his seat if he were to gain two stone. He greeted what remained of his family as Bippy appeared and began serving dinner.
As soon as she left, Draco grabbed the Auror Request and completed it with his own name as advisor.  He completed a few more forms and slipped the Auror Request into the middle of them just as Clearwater returned.
"There you are!" Potter called out as soon as Draco Apparated into Diagon Alley. He sounded relieved, and Draco wondered if Potter thought he'd been stood up.
"Draco, isn't there something about the blind leading the blind and how that's not a good plan?" That Pansy, always against Draco's plans.
“Good iron,” he said stupidly.  If he didn’t know better, he’d have said the iron beamed.  He pulled his robes away and set his trousers in their place.  The iron happily went to work.  Several minutes later, he was dressed in warm, wrinkle-less clothes and the iron was resting on his night stand.  He made a mental note to send Hermione a thank you gift.
Draco shook images of Potter in leather from his head lest his body react. His jeans were tight enough without his groin swelling.
Draco kissed him hard, biting as much as kissing him. He pulled back with a hungry glare. “Fuck me. Fuck me hard with that huge cock of yours.”
to be asking Charlie about an apprenticeship at the dragon reserve.”  She shot Harry a little glare as if the entire tangent had been his fault.
Drinks in hand, they settled into a corner booth. “I prefer wine,” Draco confessed, “but Tom’s is shit. Better to stick to the Dragon Scale Ale.” He held up his pint in toast and Harry mirrored him. “To a job well done.”
The problem with case files was that they were rather dry reading and rarely held Harry’s attention in the face of any sort of distraction. It was why he had requested the cubicle in the corner once Gomez retired and why he kept his desk free of distractions. Now, of course, he had the greatest distraction of all sitting right across from him, using his parchment and licking his quill.
As he was leaving for the next farm, he saw movement in one of the long glass greenhouses. There was old Rodney Snipter waving a gnarled hand around as he spoke to none other than Draco Malfoy. Of course! If Squib’s Friend had been legal any time in the last century, old Rodney would know about it. Harry couldn't help but smile at Draco's cleverness.
It must be a mistake. The only one ever home at eleven was Draco, and he most certainly had not arranged a fitting. A shame, really. He hadn't had a chance to buy new robes, and his old ones were getting slightly too short at the wrists and ankles. He missed the feeling of trying on a new robe when the fabric was at its finest and the hues were at their riches. But the fact remained that no one had scheduled anything with this peddler.
Harry stepped into the shower and immediately lowered himself to his knees. The tile was unforgiving under his knees, but Harry could think of nothing but a single drop of water running the length of Draco’s cock only to dangle at the end before plunging toward the drain. Harry followed its path with his tongue, swelling with pride at the moan he pulled from Draco’s lips. It became Harry’s personal challenge to draw longer and deeper sounds, working his tongue and contracting his throat as he bobbed his head.
“All right, Potter. I’ll do my duty and inform you on the basics you should have learned in fourth year. The Potion in question is called Bloodrot Poison, which you would know if you’d been listening to Robards instead of trying to strip my robes off with your eyes.”
Draco made his way back to his own department, having agreed to dinner that Friday.  As was his habit, he stopped into Clearwater's office for his morning schmooze.  As was her habit, she was engrossed in Witch Weekly and ignoring the piles of paperwork on her desk.  Draco noticed Potter's and Weasley's Auror Request for Interdepartmental Cooperation sitting on her desk under a book entitled Bewitching Canals: A Witch's Guide to Venice .
"Harry!"  The frown had softened.  "I meant, do you still think of me as just part of my family and not … as me?"
When their eyes met, Malfoy's cheeks would turn pink and his smile made Harry's heart melt. Was he mad? Was he fancying Malfoy? The flutter in his chest was answer enough. And would it be so bad? Malfoy said he planned to come back to England, and Harry hadn't found anyone better in the past seven years. Why not see where this led?
Sylvie cackled, making her the picture of a Muggle Halloween witch. “Since I left Hogwarts, my boy.” She smiled smugly. “I just work in the shadows of Knockturn rather than this glorified badger hole.” She wrinkled her nose as she looked from Robards’ desk to the Ministry acclamations on the wall.
Draco woke early on their last day to beat Potter to the shower. He worried if he showered second he might come back to the room only to find it empty. Very soon, Potter wouldn’t be his roommate anymore. He would just be another student with his own House and his own friends, separate from Draco.
in Potter, and she'd ensured the interest was reciprocated. Draco owed her more than wine and flowers. Maybe dinner at that little French place?
“And this is Okello,” Charlie said of tall, dark-skinned wizard, “he leads the other team of wizards and witches mad enough to spend their days looking after dragons.”
He could do this.  He'd planned everything out to avoid as much human contact as possible.  It was just like going to the Healer or showering in Gryffindor.
“What happened to the Patronus? What were you thinking running in here like that?” Draco’s voice was too breathless to be properly scolding.
Mother pouted. Not in an exaggerated way. Nothing tasteless like pushing her lip out, just the tiniest trace of disappointment and sadness across her features that few but her own son would even notice. But Draco did notice, and it made him feel like absolute shit for disappointing her after all she had done for him.
Draco ran a hand down his chest and over his stomach as his relaxation gave way to interest in his fantasy.
Malfoy’s smile was as captivating as it was terrifying. “It hides from feel as well. If you want to find out if I’m hard, you have to unzip me and see.”
Draco looked up to see his supervisor, Calinda Clearwater, leaning over his desk with a sickening smile.  “I'm running late for a meeting with the Minister.”  She pouted her lips and batted her lashes at him in a manner that might have been appealing if she were not made up like a tart and if he were interested in women.  “Would you be a dear and fetch the parchments from my desk?”  Fetch.  Because he was a trained Crup.
“I look forward to working with,” he paused, “Draco.” He felt himself tilt his chin up slightly and hoped he didn’t look like a petulant child.
"Potter was perfectly civil in eighth-year, and I haven't done anything to provoke him since then." Draco had barely
Draco shook his head. "I was for a year, but Astoria filed for divorce as soon as Scorpius was born." His eyes grew shrewd. "Hermione wanted me to talk to you about that, but you have been rather difficult to pin down."
“Potter.” A spoon tapped him on the forehead and he blinked Draco’s frowning face back into focus. “Honestly, Potter. We will get to that, but first eat your damn ice cream like a proper suitor.”
Draco walked up to the large wooden door of the old manor house. Either side of it, warm lights glowed from the windows promising loved ones waiting within. He knew it was silly, but Draco couldn’t resist. He rapped his knuckles smartly on the solid wood. Soon the silent evening was interrupted by quick footsteps and muffled talking.
Harry nodded and shoved a large spoonful of ice cream into his mouth. Yes, it was Butterbeer. It was sweet and creamy, but completely unsatisfying. He managed another bite.
He stripped and climbed into the shower. It felt wonderful to be clean, but as he stood rinsing the shampoo from his hair he felt his legs protesting the standing as his lungs took issue with the hot, wet air. He began coughing as he rinsed the last of the suds away and fumbled for a towel.
Draco wrapped her in a hug, berating himself silently. He knew Vitta Hyacinthina represented just another school she would never attend. Sure, she could go to Cordon Bleu someday, but they would teach her how to work with Muggle devices that would never function in her mother’s kitchen or Draco’s. Not for the first time, he contemplated converting one of the Manerji Kalmynsi’s—soon to be Hotel Kalmynsi’s—many outbuildings into a completely Muggle kitchen. Maybe someday it would be Merryn coming back from her own training, and she could show him all she learned.
Tuesday morning, Draco arrived early and went straight from the lift to the Auror Department.  He walked along the desks looking for any sign of Potter.  Just as he was getting ready to give up, Potter and Weasley rounded the corner and nearly walked into him.
It was months later when Granger and Draco found themselves alone together at a Ministry ball. They weren't quite friends, but she and Weasley had been surprisingly accepting of his and Harry's relationship.
“Guess who I saw in the Atrium?” Ron asked, dropping his gloves and hat on the floor by the coat rack, before removing his damp travel cloak. He gave the cloak a shake, spraying water over a Wanted poster on the wall.
Draco's hearing's was near the end of June, three weeks after his birthday, and Draco hated himself for the rush of relief he had felt as Potter had marched into the courtroom with his careless grace and declared himself to be a witness for the defence. Draco wanted to feel embarrassed to be seen shackled to the chair as if he were any threat without a wand. Or any threat at all. He wanted to still have enough pride that he would rather be sentenced  to life in Azkaban than be helped by his former rival. Instead, he could only try to keep his face impassive when Potter turned to nod at him.
Draco had gotten the week off for his birthday and immediately rented a broom from Jens and disappeared. Harry had thought that he’d enjoy the privacy, but instead he found himself missing the git. He certainly missed catching Draco just out of the shower.
“Is that—” he began in a whisper, but Draco cut him off with a nod. They walked a little closer before Draco pointed to Harry and then the ground. Harry took the hint and stopped. As Draco proceeded to the cave alone, he stomped heavily in contrast to his usual graceful steps. He stood in the clearing outside of the cave for a long moment, and Harry watched his tall figure against the bright blue of the sky behind him.
So when Malfoy suggested stepping out for fresh air, Harry agreed. They pressed though groups of other people laughing and bragging in their finest robes until they reached a set of French doors that opened to the gardens. Harry didn’t know if they were really outside or not, having Flooed to the party. He didn’t even know where in the country he was. He paused to marvel at the ways of the wizarding world, and Malfoy stopped to look back at him. There was a hint of question and, perhaps, nervousness in Malfoy’s features. Harry tried for a smile that was reassuring, but feared it might have just looked goofy. It didn’t matter because Malfoy smiled back and squeezed his hand lightly. Then he led Harry into the cool spring air.
Harry grinned as he thought about the surprise birthday party he had planned for Draco. 'Hermione is picking him up at five, and they're both going to Padma's. I'll Fire-call when they're gone so you can help me get things ready.'
The rest of August passed in a blur of tour groups and researchers.  Draco and Harry had only two nights together at their flat, and both times, Draco had jumped Harry the moment the door had closed, kissing and undressing him as he pulled him down the hall to his room.  And both times, Harry had awoken alone in Draco’s large bed in his much larger room.
It was a nasty way to go, and Draco looked a bit peaky for a moment before collecting himself again.
“You missed.” Malfoy deadpanned, tugging lightly at Harry’s hair again. Harry huffed a small laugh against Malfoy’s hip. The cheeky bastard was going to be the death of him, but the thought only made him giddier.
It was an hour into the party and almost everyone was present who was going to be.  It was the perfect time for Draco to enter with his perfect posture and exquisite robes. Harry knew nothing about tailoring, but he knew that the robes showed off Draco's lithe figure, accentuating his broad shoulders and the dramatic tapering down to his narrow hips. Tonight's robes were silver and grey with just enough shimmer and sparkle to catch the eye without seeming flashy. All eyes turned with Harry's to take in the sight of beauty.
Having left the girls with two elves to help them to their temporary room, Pomfrey turned her attention to Draco and Potter. She handed Draco a case of potions. “As I told the girls, these are only to help with the symptoms. Death’s Mask cures itself once it’s run its course.”
Draco rested his hand against Harry's cheek. 'We'll take our time,' he promised, and Harry wondered if his panic had been that obvious or if Draco simply knew him that well. The slow slid of Draco's thumb across his cheekbone soothed his nerves until his heart was beating normally again.
He nodded, and she told him it was about Harry. Draco tried not to panic. Was Harry hurt? Or was this about how Harry clearly wanted nothing to do with him? Whenever they were in the same place, Harry would leer at him before suddenly looking disgusted and leaving. Apparently, he still found Draco physically attractive but otherwise repulsive. It was why Draco had declined Hermione’s invitation to the Leaky that night. He didn’t need Harry to remind him that he would never make up for his childhood.
“No, it's a communication coin.  Ron sent me a message.  I have to go.”  He suddenly realised he'd said nothing to Draco about the case or the stake-out and there was no time to explain now.  “I'm really sorry,” he added as he took out some Muggle money and set it on the table.  “Stay and have dessert.  On me.  It's really good and Rosie will . . .”  He looked longingly at the man he'd fancied for the past three years and finally gotten out on a date.  He hated that it had to end like this, but he couldn't risk his suspect getting away or Ron or Neville getting hurt in his absence.  “I'll ring you,” he said from the door of the tavern.  He'd almost said “owl,” but had caught himself just in time.
Dave, the only Muggleborn on the team, had said more than once that Bârlog should simply install some Muggle technology. He'd pointed out that Muggle villages at similar altitudes had telephones and internet that allowed them contact with the rest of the world. Harry was inclined to agree, as a telephone would allow him to hear Hermione's worried tones or Ron's rough laughter.
He cast an accusing glare to his side where Draco was cocooned in the duvet with his head buried in a pillow. Bastard! 'Give me those.' He pulled at the dark blue fabric and Draco flailed his arm in protest.
Clearwater was a pain, but she was content to look and occasionally fondle.  She'd never actually tried to bed him.  Perhaps she had some respect for her position as Department Head and didn't want to abuse her power to that extent.  Draco was confident that Sothman had no such qualms.  Draco would bet his family fortune that the man would be trying to do far more than grope within a week of becoming his supervisor.
When they sat at their table, Potter was still grinning like a fool, and Draco had to force his voice to stay casual in the light of such encouragement. "Does getting off always do this to you?"
Harry knew he needed to pull off soon or Draco would come in his mouth. He worried the taste might make him gag—Draco certainly hadn't looked pleased by the flavour—but the thought of consuming part of Draco's essence kept his lips wrapped firmly around Draco's cock.
Draco's smirk melted into a warm smile, and Harry was glad to see that they could still banter without taking offence. Just because he was serious about Draco didn't mean that he wanted them to be serious
When Draco had hung up the phone, he found himself staring at it and wondering if he’d imagined the whole thing. It was only the chiming of the grandfather clock by the front door which brought him back to himself. It was dinner time, and his great aunt and mother would be expecting him. He walked down the hallway leading to Rosamund’s kitchen but also held the secret entrance to the North Wing, the part of Manerji Kalmynsi not converted into the hotel.
It was but a slender pinky, but that fourth finger set him on fire.  His rim was pulled taught and he could barely clench at all.  Draco had most of his hand up his arse, inside him.  Harry could feel him, every twitch of his fingers and turn of his wrist.  It was fantastic, but it wasn't enough.  It wasn't right.
"Her talents lie elsewhere." As much as Blaise was quick to speak for his girlfriend, even he seemed incapable of saying anything positive for her cooking.
Of course, there was the little matter that, while Potter didn't seem to hate him anymore, they weren't exactly friendly.  He wasn't really sure what they were.  Draco hadn't seen Potter for three years after the war: Potter had been in Auror training with Weasley and Longbottom, whilst Draco had finished his N.E.W.T.'s and gone abroad to earn his masters in Potions.  Draco had even managed two weeks working on the same floor of the Ministry before their paths had crossed.
Harry’s delight in scaring Teddy quickly faded as he registered the small size of the child in his hands. He cast Lumos and nearly screamed himself at the sight of a small boy who was clearly not Teddy.
“Unhand me, you monster! What was your mother thinking, putting me between you and your food. Is she plotting my demise?” Despite his protests, Draco left his still-shrunken trunk by the main stairs and let himself be dragged down the hall to where Rosamund would be guarding dinner from her hungry daughter. It was rather nice being hurried, as if his presence were important.
Parkinson huffed and crossed her arms across her chest. 'For some completely unknown reason, although obviously not your intelligence, yes.
Draco dried hurriedly, propped against the wall, as he called back that he was fine. He wrapped the towel tightly around his waist and staggered to the door. Potter caught him by the arms as he nearly stumbled into the bedroom.
Harry vowed that he would make Draco his by the end of the night.  The question was, how?  It was Sunday, so he would be expected at the Burrow for a late lunch and Quidditch as usual.  He could cancel, but he always hated to do so with so little warning.  Mrs. Weasley surely had the roast half done at this point.  Besides, his evening was still free.
Draco felt the hope rise up in his chest and tried his best to stomp it back down. So Potter liked men. It didn’t mean he wanted Draco. He had shown clear interest in Draco’s own admission, but maybe that was just because he had thought Draco was a homophobic bigot. Maybe he wanted a gay buddy to talk shop with.
Oh.  Substances.  They didn't want Draco ; they had submitted a request to Substances and thought Draco had been assigned.  He should be so lucky.  Reading a case file sounded far more interesting than editing the stack of poorly-written reports waiting on Draco's desk.  He briefly considered playing along, but he knew that he would be in trouble once Clearwater finally got around to assigning someone else.
Even though his ex-wife had given birth to Scorpius, Astoria had always viewed herself as more surrogate than mother. She had insisted on being called Auntie so that Scorpius wouldn’t be confused or hurt that his mother had moved away to marry a man who wasn’t his father. "I’d rather be the best aunt than the worst mother," she had told him. And like most things, she got her way.
Harry’s face flamed and his throat was painfully dry. He tried to swallow, but his tongue was too heavy to move.
“I want you, Draco.  You know I want you.   I can't stand watching you parade around with that tight little arse without sinking my cock into it.”  Draco squirmed, but couldn't break free.  Despite being of similar height, Blaise had several stone of muscle on him; while Draco was long and lean, Blaise was broad and solid.
Draco’s dancing eyes meant there was more good news. “With the addition of the controlled plants they must be growing, I am almost certain they are growing in Wales.” He pulled out a map and circled an area with Harry’s quill. “Probably here.”
Draco's whole body went rigid.   Shit!  What had he done wrong?  Maybe Draco still didn't trust him.  Maybe Draco had been with men who were too rough and hurt him.  The thought made Harry sick and he vowed to make tonight pleasurable for Draco.
"There had to be something wrong." Harry went on. "Don’t you see? I couldn’t believe that this handsome, charming man who sees me for who I am—full of flaws—" He smiled at Draco’s emphatic nod. "Someone like that couldn’t really want to be with me."
When Arthur had returned to the Burrow the night of the trial and told them the verdict, Ginny and Harry had embraced in their relief.  It had been the first time they’d touched since their awkward conversation about not getting back together, and it had comforted Harry to know he hadn’t lost her as a friend.  The whole night had felt like healing and moving on.
Harry eyed the seating chart and tried not to feel disappointed that Malfoy was not at his table. Curiosity didn't make for good dinner conversation, and it was nothing but curiosity that had him tracking Malfoy's pale hair among the sea of Ministry bigwigs, society darlings, and people who nailed tapestries of their family tree to the wall. These big events always left Harry uncomfortable and bored, and it was for that reason alone that he had hoped to be seated with Malfoy. Of course he would want a little mystery among the tedium.
Harry glanced down at his Weasley jumper and jeans in the glow of a street lamp. Why wouldn’t he? He certainly couldn’t wear robes to a Muggle bar. Besides, Toby was wearing the same thing. He said as much and watched Toby’s face morph through several expressions ranging from offence to disbelief.
Draco hoped they could return to normal once all signs of Potter’s illness were gone, but Potter asked him to pick the sandwiches for lunch after days of delighting over roast beef.
“They didn’t want me to do anything at first, but when I told them who had ordered it...they were as afraid of him as anyone. So they let me help with the most basic things and I found I liked it. Not that I told anyone else that. I made sure to have a right fit about it so I’d be punished that way again. Eventually, I stopped waiting to be sent to the kitchens and started sneaking in on my own.”
Draco laughed. 'They were gossiping about us long before this. I'll bet everyone down there is saying,
It took a long moment for Draco's brain to process Potter's words. Potter had planned pre-dinner shag time into their evening? It was certainly unexpected, but who was Draco to complain about Potter trying to get on his cock? Plan be damned, Draco was going to see this through. "I did think that four was an ungodly hour for dinner."
It should have been quite odd to be kissing someone he had hated in school, but the name change bit helped.  Malfoy had broken his nose and said horrible things to Harry and his friends.  Draco had soft lips and a cock like a Beater's bat pressed against Harry's hip.
"Are you two done beating your chests?" Potter asked when Abbott left. "Or do you need to compare cock size as well?"
Draco nodded his head in acceptance and asked about the next steps in the case. Harry explained that Fernsworth would likely know everything their prisoners did by the end of the night. If there were enough information to lead to a raid, it would happen without Harry. Robards had strict rules about shifts, and Harry wasn’t on call this weekend.
Draco's large hands grabbed Harry's hips tightly as he pressed forward.  There was a moment of tension when Harry's body wouldn't give at all, and then he let himself relax and accept Draco inside him.  It burned like mad, and there was no relief when the head passed inside.  The shaft itself was too thick.  There was no give, no wiggle room, just a solid weight inside him forcing him to accept it.
Weasley rolled his eyes.  “Reading about the case.  The report talks about the symptoms of the abusers.  Although you can start with the apothecary thefts if you'd think that'd be better.  I don't really care, so long as you can tell us what the potion is and help us catch these guys.”
Draco collapsed on top of him, closed his eyes, and waited for Bernard and the white hospital walls to greet him.
Harry looked into those fierce grey eyes and knew he was well and truly in for it. He wasn’t going to be able to go back to London in a few days and put Draco out of his mind.
Malfoy was dressed in a silver-grey jumper that looked softer than even cashmere had the right to, and his long legs were encased in smart charcoal-grey trousers. For a moment, Harry thought that Malfoy had cut off his famous white-blond hair, but he soon realised that it was simply pulled back from his face, allowing only a few strands to fall against his sharp cheekbones.
Potter wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, just as he had done so many time in the past three weeks, but this time there was a tenderness and familiarity that made Draco's stomach clench. The race would be over in minutes, but the possessive hand on his hip assured him that Potter would at least bring him tea at work on Monday, if he didn't simply beg Draco to stay over on Sunday night.
He chose a more subtle vantage point when he returned, and saw Draco standing with Jason Flintridge. Flintridge was very handsome with curly brown hair, jewel-blue eyes, and a disarming smile. Draco and Hermione had often commented on the young wizard's popularity in the Ministry.
Draco leaned forward with dark eyes. 'But I'm impatient. I think I should get to open this one early.' He ran his fingertips along Harry's belt.
Luckily, Claudius didn't seem to know that Draco had forgiven Blaise as soon as Pansy had moved on and they were closer than ever. What's a few death threats between friends?
“Do I get an answer or are you going to sit in silence until the door opens and you can run screaming for the dungeons?” Potter was probably trying for light, but his nerves showed through in his voice. Making him squirm should have been fun, but Draco found himself putting his hand over Potter’s instead.
Harry set the table with the plates he had checked for obvious chips or cracks and then added candles that he Charmed to hover above them. He had even dug out a small basket for the garlic bread he’d made to go with the spaghetti bolognese. It wasn’t the poshest meal he could have planned, but he knew his home-grown vegetables and herbs would provide a rich flavour to the sauce.
that heart looked wrong. That thieving Zabini was no better than his mother. No, if Claudius wanted something done properly, if he wanted someone dead, he had to do it himself.
They never found out because, at that moment, a large owl pecked at the glass of the sitting room window. Draco and Hermione all but flew to open the latch.
one abandoned, and now Draco was reading out an interesting review of the latest Dumbledore biography—co-written by Elphias Doge and Professor McGonagall—as Harry rested his head in his lap. It had taken months for them to be able to so much as mention Dumbledore or Snape in each other's presence, but now they could speak generally about the past without fear of an argument.
The parchments were neatly stacked on her desk where she had probably left them intentionally.  She sought any excuse to send him on errands and get him away from his desk; his desk was the only place safe from her pawing hands.  He wasn't a fan of her groping, but enduring it with a smile was his best shot at promotion.  And he certainly hadn't joined the Department of Intoxicating Substances to spend his time fining bars for serving alcohol to underage wizards.
It wasn’t just Draco’s bladder that had him rushing into the lavatory each morning. He had to put a door between him and wet, almost-naked Potter before his interest made peeing impossible. There was plenty of time for thinking about Potter once he was under the hot spray of the shower.
The woman carries worry in her shoulders and face. Aamu can read it in the slightest tension of the muscles the way a scholar might read a book. The woman is proud, but she also bears great love. The love warms Aamu even as the room around them chills her skin.
Draco's laugh was clear and warm.  "Oh Harry, I secured that invitation the moment she mentioned you were coming to dinner."
Potter seemed to accept that the topic of Merryn was closed and took a bite of cake. His eyes fell shut, his lips closed around the tines of his fork, and he made a small moan of pleasure. It was rude and indecent and one of the hottest things Draco had ever seen. He stared hard at his coffee until Potter had finished eating and making inappropriate noises.
But in the end, they were so worn out by the time they made it back to the bedroom that they cuddled up together under the duvet and promptly fell asleep.
A gentle hand touched his back and slid up to his shoulder. “Controlled plants,” came Draco’s murmur by his ear. Harry’s mind supplied another scenario in which Draco might step up behind him and murmur in his ear. A scenario with less clothing and more heat. “No banned plants, but certainly they are growing controlled plants without a license.”
A key dangled in his face, and he saw Abbott smiling at him. "I'm psychic," she teased as he took the key. "Goes with the job."
." This was all too much to process. Death was quite a lot to process just on its own without Harry Potter fucking kissing him. Willingly. Twice!
"You want to know why I avoid Draco?" Harry spat. He felt only a tiny twinge of guilt at shouting in Hermione’s face. "Why don’t you ask
Draco looked to the window and saw the last traces of a golden sunset. How long had he and Potter been sharing a bed? Potter showed no signs of leaving the bed now that Draco was awake, and then Draco remembered it was Potter’s bed he had collapsed in after his shower. He tried to push himself up, but Potter promptly pushed him back down.
He was still ridiculously noble, but Draco resisted the urge to roll his eyes. “You do realise you are
When Potter arrived, Draco was glad he opted for more casual attire. They weren’t coordinated by any stretch of the imagination, but they at least looked like they’d dressed for the same occasion. Potter hesitated at the door, looking around at the walls and ceiling before his eyes fell on Draco and he smiled. A big warm grin that made Draco feel weak when it should have been reassuring.
past. I thought the worst because of mine." Harry waited until Draco met his gaze, grey eyes full of confusion. "Since Ginny and I broke up, I haven’t had a single good relationship. People want gold or fame or to satisfy their curiosity. They think I’m some sort of god, so they either live in delusion or are sorely disappointed when they begin to get to know me." He begged with his eyes for Draco to understand. "You’ve never thought I was special."
Harry laughed and shook his head.  “Someone’s barmy, but he wasn’t in Gryffindor.”  He kissed Draco’s furrowed brow and then his pouting lip.  “I love you, you know.”
"I've never done this before." Potter was a bright shade of red and his eyes were firmly locked on his own jeans. Draco stopped himself before he could admit to knowing. He wouldn't betray Pansy.
“There. No one can see or enter. Your saintly modesty is preserved,” Malfoy said in a condescending tone that would have made Snape proud. He flicked his wand yet again, and Harry’s jeans Vanished. Unrepentant little sod.
All of this meant that Potter was still a virgin with no hope of reprieve on the horizon. If Potter—who must receive dozens of offers a day—couldn't get any action, then clearly he was completely helpless on that front. His virginity was a foe he could not vanquish. He needed help. He needed a hero to save him from his empty little sex life. He needed Draco!
Pansy looked just like her mother as she poured tea for Draco and herself. He was sure she would hate the comparison, but there was something about the way she tilted her chin as she delicately lifted the handle of the teapot that reminded him of sitting in front of Mrs. Parkinson's tea settings as a small boy in shorts.
‘I’m glad you’re well, Lovegood.”  It was rushed and whispered, as if it were taking all of Draco’s effort to say it, but he had managed and Harry found himself filled with a warm rush of pride.  A little smile graced Luna’s lips.
. Toby had been approached by several good-looking Muggles before disappearing with a bear of a man for so long, Harry had assumed he’d been abandoned.
Draco shook his head at the idea of the cleverest witch of their age with anyone less than brilliant, but he supposed Hermione was never going to find anyone to match her intellect. And it must be rather flattering to be the one person who could distract Oliver Wood from Quidditch. And Oliver was rather fit, especially in those tight leather—
Draco let Harry kiss him once more before he wiggled free and opened the door. "Good. I’ll pick you up then. For now, I have to go to the Manor and extract my son without waking him—all while dodging my mother’s prying questions." He looked exasperated for a moment before an evil gleam came into his eyes. "Maybe,” he smirked at Harry. “Maybe I will tell her the Saviour just shagged me over the couch and then kicked me to the kerb without dinner."
A strong voice echoed through the emptiness. There was a finality to the tone, like someone seeking closure. Draco felt certain it was a man's voice, but faces slipped away before he could put one to the voice.
"Well, I imagine you enjoy the fieldwork aspect of being an Auror—restless as you are—whilst being Head Auror is mainly paperwork, managing subordinates, and attending meetings. I would think you'd find it rather dull and tedious."
He pushed open the door to their flat and looked around for his flatmate.  “Draco?”  No reply.  He walked through the flat to the hallway that led to their rooms.  Draco’s door was open.  “Draco?”  Lonely silence was all that replied.  Harry tried to tell himself he was too tired to feel disappointed.  He stumbled to his room, emptied his Shrunken trunk and wand from his pocket and threw himself on the bed.  Despite his fatigue, he felt too frustrated to sleep.
Harry smiled back and, in his relief, failed to block the Full Body-Bind Curse which sent him crashing to the ground. Draco rolled him over and smiled maliciously down at him. "Luckily for you, I’ve outgrown breaking noses." He looked over to where the boys had run off, and when he looked back at Harry, his eyes were serious. "I’m trying to be a better person. I’m trying to be someone Scorpius will be proud of. But my past keeps getting in the way. People keep thinking the worst of me." He flicked his wand and released Harry.
dramatic." With that, she finished her tea and set it down with a clear clink. "Off with you. Go plan your grand seduction."
Draco again woke to the feel of Potter beside him. This time he knew Potter was awake because he could feel the thrum of energy Potter emitted whenever he wasn’t in the deepest stages of sleep. Potter’s leg was twitching and he was muttering softly under his breath. Maybe reading? He often muttered as he read. There was a tapping sound, and Draco remembered Potter tapping his quills against books, parchment, tables, and even his own head. The boy had a tapping problem.
“I agree,” Charlie said—the right thing to say, according to Hermione’s smug smile. “That wizard is part dragon: fierce, proud, and ferocious. He’s a natural with the dragons on the reserve. Three months in and he acts like a professional. Only wizard I’ve ever seen touch a conscious dragon and walk away without a burn.” Something like awe or pride shone on Charlie’s face.
Harry’s excitement at finding a magically concealed farm was only tempered by his apprehension about what dangers it might bring. He glanced over to Draco, wanting to tell him to fly to safety but also knowing he first needed Draco to identify what was growing. Left alone, Harry might arrest a wizard for growing cucumbers and runner beans.
“Thank you, Draco.  You're so sweet!”  She hastily signed each form without glancing at what they were.  “Here you are!  After you file those, why don't you take a long lunch?”
Opening his eyes, Harry saw Draco’s fond smile waiting for him. He looked down at Draco’s stomach and saw Draco’s long pale fingers running through Harry’s come across his stomach and down to his own cock. His still-hard cock.
The next morning, Draco woke with the sun. He couldn't lie in when he didn't feel at home, so he decided to put himself straight to work. As the sausages cooked, he wiped down the kitchen were dust had been accumulating since the matriarch’s departure.
He paced his room after that, somehow knowing Draco wouldn’t want to be seen until he was completely put together.  He was glad he waited because the sight of Draco stepping out of his room in perfectly cut charcoal trousers, pale grey shirt, and silver robes was breathtaking.
“You said you wanted to save Leah and Jowan’s wedding. Aggravating Jowan’s sister probably isn’t the way to do it. And reminding everyone I’m here isn’t helping the hotel. It’s probably best if I do what we did before: I hide in the kitchen and let the more palatable members of the hotel interact with the guests.”
Potter grabbed his hand and pulled him forward into the pub. He noticed the warmth of Potter's hand around his, but was distracted by the thought that Potter was not letting go. There were a several groups of witches and wizards filling most of the tables, and Potter led them through the middle of the room to their usual table in the corner.   And when did that happen that there was a table at the Leaky Draco thought of as
Merryn crossed her arms across her chest in complement to her smug grin. She reminded Harry of a young Hermione being praised by a professor. Her hair was just as wild, although darker, more like Harry’s own hair. The plump woman had lighter hair than Merryn, but stood side by side, Harry could see a family resemblance.
“Very sensitive to temperature and needs sun year round to flower.” He gave Harry another look of amused condensation. “The flowers are what go in the potion.”
So Harry had stuck with his faithful dildo who always satisfied but never cuddled or joined him for dinner.  Walking into Malfoy's house, Harry realised that he had stumbled upon a walking dildo who was friends with Luna.  Sure they had both nearly killed each other in school, but they had saved each other, too.  So maybe that all cancelled out and left room for friendly shagging?
"Italian is fine. And I’m only staying for dinner." Draco’s eyes carried caution, and Harry knew he was the one to make Draco so wary. He still had work to do to regain Draco’s trust, but at least Draco would give him that chance.
Harry resisted the urge to skip through the Atrium.  Barely.  He didn't think he'd been so excited to arrive at the Ministry since his very first day as an Auror.  This time he was not thinking about the cases he would solve or the people he would save; he was thinking about seeing Draco.  And unlike previous meetings with awkward greetings and embarrassing silences, this time Harry had a legitimate reason to talk to him.  In fact, Draco had owled him last night to ask if they could meet early.
“Nothing goes to waste,” Draco assured him. “If it’s not attractive enough to serve to the guests, we eat it.” He gestured toward the fruit between them on the table. Each apple was perfectly round and richly colored. The grapes were flawless orbs of shiny skin and the raspberries were dark red and looked as soft as velvet despite being out of season. This must be the guest quality fruit.  “If it’s not good enough for us,” Draco continued, “it goes to the animals.” He nodded toward the bucket of grapes. “There will be happy chickens tonight.”
Draco popped into existence on the walkway to the Château. The morning air was crisp and clear, although he still found it hard to breathe. The weight on his chest still bore down on him no matter how many times he scolded himself. What was had he been thinking? Did he really expect Harry Potter to wait in his bed for them to share breakfast and a cuddle? Potter might have been friendly and flirtatious while trying to get into Draco’s bed, but there was no reason for him to bother the morning after.
Draco glared at her. It was generous of him to even accept her invitation to tea after the last visit to her house had scarred him with a glimpse of Longbottom's bottom.
'Harry? You all right?' Draco knelt before him and looked at him with wide, grey eyes. Harry forced himself to nod. 'Harry? Do you . . .' Draco swallowed hard as if fighting not to gag. 'Do you fancy Padma?'
"We'll need some ground rules, I think." He looked up at Draco. "First of all: names. Draco, I know that you and my son still go by surnames, but that won't work with seven Weasleys. Your father and I managed to use each other's given names … despite our differences. I expect you all to manage the same." His stern look left Draco and touched on each of his children in turn.
“Ah!”  Harry smiled to himself; he must have found it.  Draco was moaning louder and bucking his hips such that Harry had to pull back to keep from choking.  A moment later, Draco's body clenched around his fingers and hot cum splattered against the side of Harry's face.
The first few weeks, Draco had foolishly believed that he might hear from Potter. The Boy-Who-Wouldn't-Die had visited Draco at the Manor just after the war to return his wand and warn him that the Aurors were considering arresting him. Draco's father had been arrested while they were still at Hogwarts, but Draco and his mother had been permitted to return to the Manor.
The message had to be just right. The jeans showed that he was progressive and pro-Muggle. The pale blue shirt and grey jumper were to flatter his colouring and accentuate his eyes. The blazer was to give him a touch of formality to show that he took the party—and thus Pansy and Longbottom's relationship—seriously. The dragonhide boots were to give a hint of rebellion in case Potter liked bad boys.
Harry had expected Draco to tear up the papers with some choice words about Muggles, but instead he had taken it as a challenge and done a surprising amount of research: mainly watching hours and hours of television.
Harry froze. Surely that was a joke. Charlie had instructed Draco to continue showing Harry the landscape and had specifically told him to keep clear of dragons. “Are you trying to get us in trouble?”
It was hard to tell in the dark, but he thought Draco rolled his eyes as he mumbled some gentle insults.
It wasn't that Harry was particularly modest.  He had stripped down in the dorms at Hogwarts or in a Healer's office without so much as a blush, but this was dinner!  Harry had never sat down for dinner naked.  Even alone in his own home on the hottest day of the summer, he would at least wear pants!
Blaise grimaced and fidgeted with some bric-a-brac on the mantle over the fireplace. He had barely moved from the spot since he'd Flooed into Draco's study with his news. "Actually, it's your heart he wants as proof."
Parkinson turned to look at him for the first time. Her brow was low in concentration as she strode forward, stopping a little too close to him. She stared at his face with her beady brown eyes, and he avoided her gaze by watching the bubbles float up her champagne flute and pop on the surface.
He would have gone downstairs just for some company, but Charlie and Pavel were out in the field with a couple of researchers from their sister reserve in New Zealand. He could have gone to the inn, but he knew that a crowd could be lonelier than solitude.
She looked back to Harry. "Seriously though, I am so glad you are working together. Ron says you even volunteered."
Draco closed his eyes and groaned.  Strong hands closed around Harry’s biceps and warm lips pressed against his own.  He could feel the scrape of stubble and the heat of breath as Draco opened his mouth and deepened the kiss.
“And Jowan?” Draco interrupted. He didn’t need to tell Potter his hotel was only booked for one event and thus there had been no need to guess which one.
“You ready?”  Harry clutched the Floo powder tightly in the hand not on Draco’s shoulder.  His stomach was in loops from all of the Portkey and Floo travel he’d done that day, and this was the final step.  One more Floo and they’d be at the Burrow.  Draco was probably thinking the same thing as he chewed at his lower lip.  Harry squeezed his shoulder again.
He pushed by the Irish Gryffindor and a couple of gingers before he was able to find Pansy. She accepted his gifts with a pointed comment about the new vegetable plot on the side of the house.
“No, you idiot. I am worried about you getting your scent on the dragon food. The last thing we need is for an Opaleye or a Welsh Green—who usually don’t have a taste for humans, as you should know—to associate our smell with their favourite meal!”
He dropped to his knees and grabbed Draco's hips. The wool twill of Draco's trousers was rough and scratched at his hands in contrast to the gentle slide of Draco's fingers along the side of his face. He pressed one hot cheek into the coarse fabric and rather liked the sting of it against his sensitive skin. He remembered the feeling of rope burn on his wrists from Auror training and imagined being tied down as Draco used gentle kisses and soothing hands to contrast the burn of the ropes. His cheeks grew hotter as his spent cock began to stir at the thought.
“This here,” Jens had stopped abruptly in front of a minty-green building at the far end of the row, “is where you’ll be staying. Research centre down here,” he said as he walked in the main door and gestured to another door to the side of the narrow stairs in front of them. “Two flats upstairs. Charlie’s on the first floor with Pavel, and you and Draco on top.” Harry felt his cheeks go warm as they passed Charlie’s door and climbed a second flight of stairs to the flat he would be sharing with Malfoy.
“You know, it might be a hassle having you stay for the rush. Big name celebrity like you might distract people from their shopping. How about I pick out some things I think you’ll like and bring them by yours this evening?”
Potter beamed at him. "Great! Thank you! Let me grab my cloak." He ran to the door before halting and turning around. "Don't go anywhere!" He pinned Draco with his eyes until Draco nodded, and then he turned and sprinted back to the Auror division.
"The Witch's Brew does a decent meal," Draco said casually, just in case he'd imagined Potter's invitation. The poky little pub was on the outskirts of London and far from the crowds of Diagon Alley.  It was a favourite of those witches and wizards who valued privacy over proper lighting.
Harry released a long but controlled breath. “I chose a hotel that came well reviewed by the friends who have stayed there. Your newspaper reported Draco Malfoy is the owner, and I suspect that’s accurate as he took my reservation for me. By Muggle telephone, actually. Not a usual favourite of Death Eaters.”
Draco pulled him forward into a wet and messy kiss. 'To answer your questions,' Draco said as they parted, 'yes, we seem to be doing very
No, there was really only one man who was worth Draco's time and virginity.  Only Harry Potter had the power and influence to protect him within the Ministry and improve his standing in the wizarding world in general.  The world was eager to please Harry Potter, and those close to him won favour by proxy.  Even Potter's boy-toy would curry some favour.
Draco had rather liked the notion that Harry's kiss had saved him from death, but the Healer's version was much less romantic. Rather like the Healer herself.
Potter laughed at him, but it wasn’t a cruel or mocking laugh. "Idiot,” he said fondly. “You should have told me. I thought you must have had other lovers and I was terrified I was going to disappoint you."
Harry shrugged, pulled his trunk out of his pocket, and cast the charm to return it to its proper size.
“That’s right.” She smiled at him as she pulled back. “Except about macaroons.” The two laughed and Harry watched them enjoy the private joke. It was good to think Draco had made a history for himself that had nothing to do with Voldemort,
"Right. Great! Then you understand that practice is our only chance of winning the race. I recall from school that you never took well to losing."
When Draco parted his lips, Harry tasted the wine more fully and felt the silky pressure of Draco's tongue.  He was damn good with his tongue.  All of the posh talking must have made it strong and nimble.  If his cock could thrust and rub half as well as his tongue, Harry was going to die from orgasm by the end of the night.  It was a good way to go, even if it would be damn awkward for his friends.
Potter fidgeted beside him, digging into the pockets of his robes. He pulled out a length of red and white rope and held it for Draco to see. "Shall we get started?" His tone was carefully neutral, and Draco found it tedious. Even by attempting to be civil, Potter managed to annoy him.
"You want this."  There was a question in Draco's voice.  A hint of surprise and a need for reassurance.  Apparently Draco was having similar revelations.
But Harry was never very good at hiding his feelings, and one evening, as Draco and he were setting up camp, he couldn’t bite his tongue any longer.
Harry paced his desk waiting for Draco's reply.  He could easily walk across the floor to the other man's department, but he really wanted to shower and change before he let Draco near him.  He and Ron had been tailing their Scottish apothecary assistant since Tuesday morning, and Harry was filthy.  It was only Ron's indulgence that was allowing Harry the evening off to keep his date with Draco.
Robards made an annoyed grunt. “Everyone in this room has been carefully vetted, Sylvie. He’s one of ours now.”
Draco just rolled his eyes. He did that a lot. Mainly at Harry. “Come along, Potter. Now that we have you all patched up, I think you owe me dinner.”
wanted to go to Romania and work with dragons, and if being civil to Malfoy was what it took, so be it.
Potter laughed again.  Then he got a funny look in his eye and his gaze travelled to Draco's own pale blond hair.  “Yours is certainly unusual.  Can I add you to my collection?”  Potter looked him in the eye again, but he was blushing.
He walked over to the table set for two and adjusted the napkins. Again. Was that a smudge on the crystal? No, just a trick of the light. Everything was perfect. He ran his hands down his jumper to make sure it was smooth, again wondering if he should have kept the tweed jacket and tie. He’d looked quite smart, his mirror assured him, but he’d worried he’d be overdressed compared to Potter. He needed Potter to feel comfortable. To like his time here. It was the only chance of creating good press and saving the hotel from ruin.
"Teddy asked him," Harry explained. Yes, he threw an eight-year-old under the bus to save his own neck. "Scorpius said he didn’t have a mother."
The lack of news reports on Potter's love life had been attributed to fact that Potter had purchased the Prophet after the war and promptly sacked anyone who had ever written a salacious piece about him or his friends. The first to go had been the photographer who captured Potter snogging Macmillan at Potter's Ministry-sponsored, postwar birthday extravaganza.
Harry was thrown by the sudden change in conversation.  Why would Draco be surprised to hear Harry call him his boyfriend?  What else would he be when they were sleeping together and spending all their time together?  He put that thought into words.
Harry grinned like a loon all day.  For the first time, he had woken wrapped in Draco’s naked body.  They had fumbled about in bed before sharing a shower, and then Draco had let Harry make them breakfast.  By the time Draco had left to help Zhi track a brooding Fireball, Harry had been all but walking on air.
“Look at you.” Rosamund’s bright eyes darted over him. “Didn’t they feed you? What did you do with all that food you were making if none of it made it to your bones?”
He began climbing the stairs again. “We are going upstairs to the kitchens off the main dining room.” He reached the first landing and led Harry down a hallway lined with portraits and paintings in golden frames. They walked by a large doorway which showed what must be the main dining room. It was a large room with walls the color of red wine and ornate chandeliers of twisted metal. Draco bypassed a small door and led Harry to the end of the hallway where Harry was met by gleaming stone countertops, shiny pots, and baskets of brightly colored vegetables.
. It had taken some work getting Firenze to agree to talk about his treatment by wizards over the years, but the resulting interview was moving and should inspire sympathy for centaurs. He owed Pansy for making sure the interview was assigned to a young reporter who had been Firenze’s student for five years before graduating. He had known Pansy’s nose for gossip would make her a great reporter one day, and he was glad to have an ally with the major paper.
Harry was restless to get into the field and sweeping a defined area of Wales sounded much better than sitting in his cubicle waiting for Draco to find more information. He told Draco to continue researching while he began his sweep, but Draco stood abruptly and shook his head.
“The only people who wear ratty jumpers and baggy jeans to a gay bar are the people so settled into committed relationships that they no longer care about their appearance. If you’re wondering why no one tried to chat you up, it’s because they assumed there was no point. Honestly, a wedding ring would have been less of a deterrent.”
He turned and saw Malfoy up close for the first time that evening. The years abroad had been kind to him. He was still pale, despite moving to France, but his skin looked warmer and softer. There was a glow to his cheeks and a twinkle to his eyes that had not been present when they had last met in the months after the war.
“No!  You're covered in sweat and cum, and I freshly showered!  Go!  Bathe!”  Draco ignored the kicked-puppy expression and hurried to his closet to dress.  The distant sound of water running met his return to the bedroom and he had to smile.  Harry Potter was naked in his shower.  He allowed himself a moment of giddiness before heading downstairs to make breakfast.
Harry figured pointing out the Fidelius Charm would probably not change Draco’s mind. It was rather chilly and the air was heavy with the promise of more rain.
He mentioned it to Malfoy and was rewarded with more delicately articulated Latin names as Malfoy suggested plants that would grow well in the West Country. Harry’s fuzzy mind filled with images of Malfoy in his yard with bulbs and seedlings. Malfoy wouldn’t be in his nice robes for gardening. Would be wear casual robes or had he discovered Muggle fashion in Paris? Muggle styles were certainly more popular in London these days, at least among their generation.
Draco wrinkled his nose. "No. I've had quite enough of the Dark Lord, and if one of your lot is going to be Minister, it should be Granger."
Kensa’s eyes were brimming with tears. “But Merryn just told me all you have done for her. How you’ve tried to protect her just as I’ve tried to protect Jowan. I’m so sorry.”
Draco began to collapse, but propped himself on one elbow before crushing Harry completely.  That small act of kindness made warmth spread across Harry's chest.  He wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him down on top of him.
"Hey, now. I appreciate a well-fitted robe, but there is no need to choke me in this …" It seemed each time he paused for a breath, there was less and less room for him to fill his lungs. "It's … tight … too tight … air." Draco reached out for the peddler's arm to brace himself, but the little man was no longer there. Draco opened his mouth, attempted to suck in air, and collapsed into blackness.
Draco just laughed. "Now I know how to keep you in line." He composed his face in all it’s haughty glory. "My mother will hear about this!" With a cackle and a wink, he was gone, leaving Harry hoping he was kidding.
Draco was more than a little surprised to find Harry Potter in his bed the next morning.  It wasn't that he'd forgotten what they'd been up to the night before—his arse would have reminded him anyway—it's just that he had assumed Potter would disappear in the night.  Maybe the man was still tired from the Shaw case.
He saw Potter nod from the corner of his eye. "I'll meet you here after work, but I don't want to go to Malfoy Manor," Potter said. Draco was about to argue, but Potter didn't give him a chance. "In fairness, I assume you don't want to go to the Burrow."
