As a little boy, he had once gotten lost in the manor as he had played hide and seek with one of the house elves that were responsible for his education, and had ended up behind the narrow wooden door. He could still feel the cold and clammy stone walls underneath his small fingers as his curiosity had weighed out his parents' warnings. His little feet had carried him into the maze that was the mansion's dungeon.
Just a mere twenty metres away from Harry, Draco stood in the biggest parlour of his mansion, pacing back and forth nervously, trying to get his confused and illogical thoughts back into order and
and whose hair was a lost cause anyway.
peaceful and purposefully ignorant life had ended. The Dark Lord had returned, and once Draco returned back home, his father took him aside and explained to him what was expected of their family, and how he had to behave and act.
The blond sighed softly as a sad smile pulled at his lips. They’d find each other again. He really hoped so.
. Just like the time with Sirius. Hadn’t he learned out of his mistakes? Hadn’t he learned by now that he should at least listen to Hermione out of all people when she thinks there’s something wrong?
Behind him, Harry huffed. He didn’t like this whole scenario either, then. Draco smirked. “This whole thing,” he gestured wildly with his hands, “is to honour those who lost their lives during the war?” He started laughing loudly as Ackland looked ready to murder him. “You can’t be serious!”
*~*HPDM*~*
Harry smiled at that and looked up at a softly glowing face that looked even more beautiful in the flickering lights of the warm fire they were still sitting in front of.
He ran his hand over his wet face. There was no use beating himself up over it. It happened and by tomorrow, the whole wizarding world would know he was gay and easy to get. He sighed and stood up. He had to get on with his life and he had to get over this stupid trap, but most importantly, he had to get in touch with Hermione. She would know what to do!
I am not supposed to be talking about ongoing cases,” she said, as if talking to a three year old. “I’m still not supposed to.”
“All right.”
Harry shot Herm-
"Apparently."
He would wait for him. He had all the time in the world now, could do whatever he pleased, so he would wait for Harry to come to him. He would give him the time he needed, and when he was ready, he’d come to Draco, and Draco would be there for him.
, Harry figured as he sheepishly glanced up to his boyfriend to see a flicker of pain and annoyance on his face. “You knew.”
The brown-haired witch winced slightly at the mental picture of Harry and… She shuddered. "But how can you be so sure that's what he's really planning, Harry? This is Malfoy we're talking about! Not Dean or Seamus!"
On any other day, he would lie on his bed, his head turned towards the side, his eyes following the clouds in the sky. The window would be open, letting a soft breeze enter his bedroom carrying with it the sounds of birds chirping joyfully.
, earning her a disapproving stare from Madam Pince. Nothing. She could absolutely not find any information whatsoever! How was she supposed to complete this essay if she couldn’t find what she needed for it?
"But Father--"
Draco’s lips cut him off as the blonde threw himself at the Slytherin, successfully shutting him up. Harry felt like he was about to vomit. He couldn’t watch it – watch
“That he is not, my Lord. I assure you he will not disappoint you another time.”
His parents' marriage was the product of a betrothal between two high class pureblood families that had needed this connection in order to keep their influence on the wizarding world up and going. He was pretty sure that his parents loved each other, but he had never seen them act loving or caring towards each other. The only reason why he knew that his mother was able to love was her treatment of him. How she spoke with him, how she hugged him... His father had always been this untouchable persona, not even being himself whilst talking with his own son. Or maybe he couldn't act any different? He grew up with elders, never allowed to get in touch with people his age. Maybe his father didn't know how to properly interact with someone younger than him - his son at that?
Draco was disgusted.
I hope you liked it!
"They were indeed interesting, I have to say," Draco replied and a soft smile appeared on his face as he tried to look everywhere but to the spot next to him where Harry was doing the exact same thing.
“I don’t know,” Harry said, walking slowly towards the wooden table, never taking his eyes off the parchment in his hands. His brilliant eyes met my rather boring looking ones as he gave me the Ministry letter. “It’s yours. You read it. I’m sure it’s nothing too serious,” his voice was calm, his smile gentle, his lips way too soft and enticing looking for his own good.
*~*HPDM*~*
“S-Sorry, I need to… I need to go.”
"Love, you know that I can't change it now. The choice has been made and you should do everything to fulfil what's asked of you."
"But I've reserved a table at
,” he spit, disgusted, “
“What heritage?” I blinked at him owlishly. I didn’t understand a word he was saying.
“I want you to meet him sometime in the near future. He means the world to me and I would really appreciate it if you-“
“He’s messing with you! I just overheard him saying that he was just being polite about everything and didn’t want to insult you by directly telling you that he isn’t interested.” He didn’t need to know all of the insulting details. That would hurt him even more, no matter how much he found out, and she really didn’t want him to break apart completely. Not if she could do something about it.
His voice was excited, his eyes showed a determination that was endearing. It meant the world to him that he wanted him enough to ask him to abandon everything he had known and to just stay.
“What? Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course I’m alright,” Draco huffed and turned his head sideways to hide his adorable blush. Harry’s stomach made a somersault.
He would not show that kind of vulnerability! If Harry saw him like this, his damned hero instinct would kick in and he’d feel obligated to save him like he always did. That’s his thing – saving people; no matter how hopeless the situation was. Harry was too stubborn for his own good. If he’d have his way, he’d ruin his whole life just to save another, and that was what he was currently doing. If Draco allowed the Potter heir to stay, he’d seal the horrible fate looming over him. Voldemort would come after him and end what he had started. His own father would come and see to him dying of his own hand, and he would
“No, you don’t, Hermione.” He took a deep breath, lowered his head and pressed the bridge of his nose between his thumb and pointer finger. He was developing a headache. “Draco is my boyfriend,” he knew without looking that both Hermione and Ron flinched, “and I will not betray his trust just because someone told me to.”
don’t have to ask who
“It’s not going to do as you tell it to,” I said, cautiously walking through the battlefield of destroyed food and reached behind him to grab onto the blanket which was still in Harry’s vice like grip.
“Well?” I asked nervously, not really wanting to hear the answer, but wanting to hear it nevertheless.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded, thoughtful. “Madam Pomfrey said that it’s dark magic.”
Harry held his breath as the small elf moved past him.
“He’s fine,” she said as they moved towards the stairs and away from curious eyes. “He fell asleep as soon as I managed to drag him into his bed.” She chuckled, but the sadness still lingered in her eyes.
The whispered question crept out of Lucius’ corner, who came out of his shocked state and ripped his mask off his face. His expression was murderous. “What did you just say?”
“I am well, thank you, father. I have come to tell you something of great importance.”
“Draco,” the snake-like man purred, and motioned the boy to stand. The defiant look did not vanish from his pale eyes, but the Dark Lord was pleased to see worry – and, oh, was that fear? – flicker in the grey orbs. “Welcome.”
*~*HP*~*
Draco felt his heart swell. Harry forgave him! Harry actually forgave him! A grin spread over his face, lightening up the whole room. Harry opened his eyes and pressed a small kiss onto the tip of Draco’s nose.
The blond wizard couldn't help but smirk bitterly as his mother saw him down those clammy stone stairs, showing no reaction to the tortured screams that echoed through the old halls.
He would not become a Death Eater! Over his dead body!
“Would you stop that already?” She huffed as Ron tugged at his sleeve, wincing ever so slightly. “What is wrong with you?”
I have tried to compare men with women when I was in Diagon Alley and I’ve noticed more nice and good-looking features on men than I have noticed women having any. I was unsure. I was afraid and I was – I have to admit – disgusted.” Draco’s eyes lowered to the floor as he tried to find honest words. “I don’t want to be different, you know? Well, no, that is wrong. I have not wanted to be different, but now I know that there’s nothing wrong with
Leave a comment and tell me what you think! I love reading and answering reviews. They make my day.
"He's in here," the voice of Lucius Malfoy called right outside their room. Draco whimpered.
Until next time - see ya!
“Five foot? That’s insane!” Ginny heard Lavender Brown complain in the row behind her as she packed her books back in her satchel. “Flitwick already wants a three-and-a-half-foot essay on the Vanishing Charm by Tuesday, and Professor Sprout requested another three-and-a-half-foot essay by Monday. How am I going to get all of that work done in time? There’s no way!”
The steam fogged up every mirroring surface in the room, creeping into his lungs. The hot water splashed down on him as he stood in the shower, enjoying the feeling of the warmth seeping into him, into his skin, trying to cleanse it. How could he be so stupid? He shook his head and rested a hand on the wall, leaning against it, suddenly exhausted. The salty tears mixed with the hot water, running down his face and body until he couldn’t cry anymore.
Grimacing, he inhaled deeply and set out into the Great Hall, maneuvering around the injured until he reached the huddle of Weasleys. “Hermione?” he asked quietly and tapped her shoulder lightly.
“This is not about betraying anyone.” Hermione dropped Ron’s hand and stepped up to him, kneeling down next to the chair he was trying to stay in. “We have to make sure that there is no threat remaining that could cause another war.”
Ron scoffed and moved forward to Hermione, who was still kneeling on the floor, staring up at Harry with teary eyes. She didn’t move as he tried to pry her away from the chair Harry had sat in mere moments ago.
I gulped in a huge amount of air and felt the dizziness slowly leave my brain. I could blink again. I turned my head and frowned at a concerned looking Harry who was still kneeling in front of me, one hand resting on my knee, the other on my cheek. Their warmth seeped right through my skin, into my veins and onwards to each and every little part of my body, concentrating in my groin. I groaned.
"Draco, open your eyes. Please, it's me. Harry. I'm here now, love! Everything will be okay. You'll see," his muttered words fell on deaf ears as the first desperate tear dropped into blond hair. "Don't do this to me!"
His mother sniffed and turned towards his father. He knew this would happen. He knew they wouldn’t be able to accept this. He knew they wouldn’t be able to accept anything out of the ordinary. He had been no fool. He knew they wouldn’t jump up in euphoria, exclaiming how happy they were that he had found the love of his life, but he had had hope that they would at least accept it, although the chances were close to none.
He sighed as he closed his eyes. He was in heaven.
"Are you okay?"
"Did you at least bring the flour?"
“Well, what am I supposed to do then, according to your opinion?” I asked timidly, as to not aggravate her any further.
He told him that the only possibility for him to find certainty and peace was this silly bet and Pansy gave him the best cover to experience a change in his life. “First I really thought it would be a fun feature to embarrass you. Getting knowledge about my… possible different orientation would only be a plus I told myself, but…” He sighed and ran a hand through his still untidy hair.
After a hurried shower, hair still slightly moist but dressed in a smart shirt and freshly pressed pants, he felt a wave of relief wash over him. Another look at his watch told him he still had four minutes to spare.
Content, he let himself plop down onto one of his two couches, picked up one of the two fresh socks that he'd taken out of his wardrobe earlier, and set about getting the finishing touches done. One twirl with his wand later, his hair was dry, his arms and legs moisturised, and his favourite cologne flew out of the bathroom and straight into his lap, ready for application.
It had been a while since he had seen the saviour, but he hadn’t changed much. His hair was slightly longer, but still just as messy as it used to be. Draco’s hand twitched as he studied the soft texture of the black hair, pointing this and that direction. He smiled softly as his gaze travelled down his neck, over his strong, broad shoulders, over his muscled arms… He swallowed as the familiar tingling feeling shot through his stomach and into his veins, warming his body within seconds. Harry’s, no,
“Obliviate me! Please!”
He forced himself to turn his head to his right slowly. The motion made his head spin and he had to inhale deeply to not vomit all over the young man sitting hunched in an uncomfortable-looking wooden chair at his bed side. Raven hair was sticking out at unnatural angles, clumping together and making it look anything but its usually shiny nature. A small strand of the soft texture hung into closed eyes, lashes fanned over pale cheeks.
He thought disgruntled, as he stirred Pansy into the next room to be tended to by his house elves and left the hallway himself. He had to get ready for his date.
Draco’s heartbeat was so fast that he feared it would jump right out of his rib cage any second now. He swallowed as he looked into those beautiful eyes that led him through every one of his dreams. “No, it wasn’t,” he whispered as if in trance. His eyes wandered down to Harry’s lips. They looked so soft and sweet…
“Oh, God!
He blinked as a loud
“Well, do you have a better one?” Hermione snapped, ignoring Harry’s nervous fidgeting. “We have to get him out of there now. Preferably before it’s too late!”
The sky was dark as the first rain drops hit the window in his room.
Ginny shook her head disapprovingly and crouched closer to the door, waving for Dean to follow in her wake. She leaned against the old wood, pressed her ear against it and waited.
“You know what?” He stood up and helped me onto my feet. “I’ll firecall Hermione. She works in that department and I’m sure she’ll help us. Or at least tell us what to expect.”
“Yes, really,” she answered deridingly. “You’re a Death Eater and have no business anywhere near Harry Potter or this party. We’re here to honour those who died at
knew that – well, except maybe one raven-haired wizard who was enjoying his time downstairs with
“He isn’t a Death Eater,” Draco turned around and saw a livid Harry, who had effort to put his glass down slowly, as to not smash it on the table top. “He was cleared of all charges,” well, that wasn’t exactly true, but that witch didn’t need to know the minor verdicts anyway. Who was she to interfere with their business anyway?
“The lights aren’t on,” his voice could barely be heard over the rolling thunder. “What if we’re too late?”
Choices
Being out in the open for everyone to stare at and insult did not feel right while being alone. He wanted, no,
Hermione choked as a roar of applause and whistles greeted them and forced them to enter the overly decorated room full of eager wizards and witches, who eyed them with both pride and awe. Harry put on a bright – but fake – smile as he dragged a dumbstruck Hermione and an itching Ron  through the masses towards the podium, where a young witch stood, beaming down at them. She reached out with her hand as Harry and his two friends set a foot on the stairs leading onto the podium and immediately pulled Harry onto the stage, positioning herself right next to him and batting her eyelashes at him flirtatiously.
A, well,
What awaited him inside nearly had Draco lose what little food he had managed to force down this morning.
All you could hear were the flames in the fireplace and Draco’s soft and Harry’s missing breathing.
*~*HPDM*~*
Draco groaned and pushed his right hand through his messy bed hair. “What did you do?”
The curtains had not been drawn, and had been tied back neatly. Draco took a few cautious steps forward, hoping that the floorboards wouldn’t creek. He stopped dead right next to the bed, and he felt his heart pummel to the ground.
“I’ve heard from your case, Malfoy,” her voice ripped me out of my calming breathing technique and caused me to swallow way too much air at once.
“No.”
A perfectly shaped black eyebrow rose and Draco took that as his sign to get going. So he took a deep breath and told him everything. He told him about Pansy’s idea with the bet, him accepting it in order to prove not only her but himself that yes, he could manage to manipulate someone as powerful as Harry, but also that – his voice hitched slightly. He wanted to see whether all the things he had noticed in the past were mere imagination, normal things that everyone would notice or whether they had their origin in something more meaningful, something his family was sure to use as a reason to disinherit him. According to his family it was a shame for a pure-blood wizard to be attracted to…
My eyes narrowed as I tried to stare the mirror to death. Everyone knew that charms only did so much to your hair.
sniffed and turned her glare back towards me. I pushed all of my strength, conviction and energy into the corners of my mouth, only to stop right away as I saw Harry wince.
"Thank you." A pink tint coloured his cheeks as he tried to squirm under his mother's gaze. She had always enjoyed to just look at him. "You do, too."
Slowly, Draco moved forward and started to pry the blanket out from his motionless form. He lovingly covered his trembling body with it, hoping to stop him from freezing.
"Hermione, don't you think we're past that stage when we kept trying to lure each other into traps?"
The girl whimpered and curled into a tight ball, trying to protect her stomach from further harm.
The blond’s lip twitched slightly, amused.
"That I what?" Draco raised his eyebrows, waiting impatiently for Harry to continue. "That I
“Draco,” he said, his eyes not leaving the girl, as a cruel smile found its way onto his thin lips. “Come over here.”
Harry eyed the entrance to
“Harry!” Ginny gasped for breath as she skidded to a halt in front of a very confused-looking Harry, whose eyes widened slightly. “Thank goodness, I found you. I was looking everywhere for you!”
"Of course, I wouldn't," Harry said softly, voice trembling, "but this isn't the first time you…" He trailed off, not knowing how to continue. No. Not
“OUCH! Freaking...! Stop kicking me, you idiot!”
Draco frowned at it and put his right hand over the covered wound. A dull pain told him that the gash wasn’t healed yet, meaning that it would probably never completely heal either.
“Tell me again why I should help him exactly,” her voice was arrogant as she turned to the most loving and lovable person I knew. You don’t talk to him that way! Not even Granger! It just wasn’t right.
“Well, what do we have here?”
Harry smiled and cuddled closer to the blond. “They asked me to...” He swallowed and pressed his eyes shut tightly. His breathing got faster, more laboured and he felt himself being pulled into a tight embrace.
“Because they think he’s a Death Eater,” the black-haired wizard said bluntly, staring at the man in front of him, who sighed and nodded slightly. Harry groaned. “They can’t be serious! He’s not one of Voldemort’s followers! He doesn’t want to follow him.”
, that came out wrong. He
“I heard what you said,” there was no reason why I should kiss my self-respect goodbye just yet.
Silence followed the sisters' words as they watched the couple at the Gryffindor table giggle and steal a kiss every once in a while.
…when a burst of sunlight hit me straight in the face.
Draco kept himself from scoffing at the last second. Guest. Yeah, right.
“Malfoy,” he said and wiggled his hand out of the woman’s grip. “I was looking for you.”
"I will do no such thing without you and now shut up and let me think," the beautiful voice of his lover hissed as he muttered the words, "dangerous" and "killed", but the raven-haired boy didn't listen.
"Well, of course!" Malfoy huffed and jokily glared at Harry, causing his stomach to do a weird somersault within his body, leaving the smaller wizard dizzy and befuddled. "Wealth is the ability to fully experience life. Why wouldn't I use it to make this date as enjoyable as possible for both you and me?"
"Is it long still?" he shouted over the explosions and yelled incantations.
A hand grabbed his upper arm, fingers digging painfully into his biceps. “Do it, Draco, or so help me Morgana...”
*~*HPDM*~*
“What?”
He had not raised his hand to touch the window, as the door was pushed open and his fate stood in the doorway, successfully blocking all possibly escape routes. Why had he not taken the offer when he had still been able to?! Stay. How could one word hold so much power?
Surprised, the young couple at the lake turned around, only to see a very pissed off Harry Potter march their way. Blaise gulped, Hermione just barely managed to keep from rolling her eyes.
Harry smiled, relieved, and hurried through the room. He could hear the front door close shut as he reached the top of the staircase. Screeches that he was by now used to filled the halls as he raced down the stairs and nearly collided with one of the hooded figures, who caught him in time to prevent a painful collision.
she was usually right, but he had decided, against his better judgement, to not listen to her
He looked up and saw Draco stare at his arms with a weird expression on his face. Harry frowned. “Hey, you alright?” He asked softly, successfully pulling Draco out of his reveries.
have a guest." She wiggled with her eyebrows, her grin widened even more.
After what felt like an eternity, the gates came into view. Harry's leg gave an uncomfortable twinge as a curse shot right past it, heating up the air around it with an aggressive fizzle. Raising his wand arm, he shot multiple stunners and cutting curses at their attackers in quick succession, taking down three who had run directly into the curses.
Comment and tell me what you think!
Silence filled the room. The hand holding his wand was oddly stable. His breathing was calm. His heart on the other hand was racing, and he was starting to feel slightly faint.
. The papers were dying to get an exclusive interview with
Snoring was the only thing that could be heard as Daphne and her sleepy, yet alert sister sneaked down the hallway that led to the boys' dormitories. Glancing over their shoulders at every little sound they heard, they slowly made their way to the sixth year boys' sleeping quarters. A silver name plaque told the visitor who was residing in these quarters and they smirked at each other as Daphne pointed at a name in the middle of the metal plaque -
Please leave a comment and tell me what you think!
Feeling extremely satisfied as I managed to pry the soft feather blanket out of Harry’s
"And can you bring some more flour as well?" Harry asked as he kneaded the dough for the pastry. "Hermione said she has some left-over filling that she needs to get rid of before it spoils."
Before Draco could do anything more than let out an embarrassing squeak, his way too stubborn boyfriend stood up and jumped on one leg, making himself look like the buffoon Draco already knew he was.
Astoria gulped, looked up to her older sister and slowly shook her head, her dark hair swinging from side to side. “No, he didn’t have a say in this. It was –“
“WHERE ARE YOU, HONEY?”
Betrothed or not betrothed - Draco Malfoy is in love with Harry Potter. But the betrothal between the youngest Greengrass and only Malfoy heir is a binding contract. What to do to change the wizard's mind in the matter of love? Daphne knows.
Smiling sheepishly, Harry shook his head, getting the trademark smirk in response. “So?”
They were crammed in a small broom cupboard that left little room to breathe, lest move at all. They were quite literally stuck in there. Not that he minded... He had never stopped liking Ginny in a romantic way, even though Ginny had told him that she did not feel the same for him anymore. He could accept that and he was trying his absolute best to get over his infatuation with the ginger haired witch. Being pressed against her side, having her thighs press against his wasn’t really helping his case though...
Comment and tell me what you think the bracelet is for! It has a purpose :) But neither Draco, nor Harry know about it - obviously.
The injured wizard gulped, his hand limply falling onto the cold bed sheets.
He had to stay calm and think. It didn't do him any good if he went and started to get panicked. He had one room left, just about three metres ahead of him, and if that one wasn't the one he was looking for either, then he'd just turn around and search the whole freaking mansion! He was not giving up or leaving without Draco!
"Coming," he called loudly as he took his steaming pie out of the oven before hurrying down the hall to get the door.
Harry ground his teeth, resolution hardening. "In the bottom drawer," he said coldly. "Underneath your underwear."
I hope you liked it!
!” she hissed as she came to a stop right in front of the traitor, finger ramming into his chest. She ignored his shocked expression, grey eyes big and round, as she focussed solely on why she was here. “Do you even know how pathetic you are? Treating someone like that is even below
*~*HP*~*
*~*HPDM*~*
Harry tried to hide his smirk as Ron scratched his lower back. “I think George put some Tickling Solution into my robes,” he grumbled as he reached up to scratch his shoulder. “Damn it! Harry, could you help a man out?”
He didn’t know how long they stayed like this, kissing as if their lives depended on it – maybe they did – but as Harry finally pulled away, his eyes were anything but gentle. He glared at the blond and the Malfoy heir could literally see smoke come off of the man who had just taken his breath away.
Red left grey as they zoned in on the trembling girl on the floor. “What do we have here. Not brushed off your shoes before entering the room, I see?”
“I have always known who you really are, and that’s why I love you,” the raven haired wizard whispered and reached up to cup his cheek in his hand. “All these years there has been someone great underneath this layer of hatred and I’ve always believed that I’d get to see your true self one time. I haven’t been disappointed.”
This wasn’t right. They had to see that this was so wrong that nobody who was truly sane could believe this bullshit! But they didn’t.
Blaise tense posture relaxed somewhat as he heard Madam Pince’s stern voice chastise Draco and hopefully manage to stop whatever he was planning to –
That didn’t make any sense whatsoever. “Why would they do that?” I asked confused and scratched my damn shoulder blade. I should go and see a healer soon, I decided as I took a seat at the wooden kitchen table, which was still splattered with parts of our destroyed breakfast.
Pain was the first thing he noticed when his brain caught up with his surroundings. It wasn’t the type of sharp pain you had when you cut yourself with a knife or the dull ache that was caused by knocking your knee. It was a weird mixture of these two kinds; a dull, everlasting ache that felt as if his bones were on fire. He couldn’t specify its origin, as it felt like it came from within, directly from his blood, being spread through his veins by his steady heartbeat.
!" Draco hissed as his best friend peaked into the room, a big grin on her face. Hurriedly, he grabbed the white satin blanket off the bed, wrapped it around himself and rushed over to the door in order to push the nosy woman out of the manor before Harry saw her.
“I... I know that, Harry,” she stuttered and squeezed her eyes shut for a few seconds, trying to keep the tears from falling. Harry didn’t understand why she was crying as he was the only one who had the right to cry right about now!
wanted
Now the confusion was more than obvious on Malfoy's pale face. His mouth opened and closed as if he was having trouble finding words, which, not going to lie, confused Ginny a bit.
Harry blinked and stayed silent. He had to admit that there was an odd truth in what Draco had just said. He hadn’t thought about it that way. All he had seen was his friends trying to jeopardise his relationship with the Malfoy heir and trying to get him into the position of the Wizarding World’s hero again. He had enough of that role and although the newspapers still loved him and still had him on their front page even after over half a year since the end of the war, he had not been happy about giving them even more juicy news to publish.
And it hadn't been.
he needed to change into something nice.
meant something.
He didn’t raise his head to look at his father as the man slowly moved forward. He manoeuvred around the girl, careful as to not step into the puddle of blood that was slowly expanding, and stopped right next to him. The robed man rested one gloved hand on Draco’s stiff shoulders, squeezing slightly; not for comfort reasons, but as a warning. The young Malfoy didn’t let the older one know that he knew exactly what his father was doing to him. He would not let him have that satisfaction. Call it Slytherin pride or pure survival instinct; both would come out as the same at that moment.
Harry gaped at the man sitting on the bed in front of him; his aristocratic features smooth, too smooth to be honest. He knew what the blond was doing; he had seen him do it multiple times before, more often than he could have counted, and he couldn’t help but feel disappointed that he apparently still felt the need to shut him out.
"Very good."
“Of course I did, what else should I have done? Openly tell him to piss off?” Malfoy shook his head, hair swishing over his forehead. “I was raised to show manners, even if the other person doesn’t deserve them.”
what he was doing.
Blond strands of hair fell into beautiful, red-rimmed, grey eyes that shone with pain and desperation. His cheeks were red, the rest of his complexion as pale as a porcelain doll. He was beautiful, the man of his dreams but he knew that it wouldn't work like this; not if he didn't change.
Harry took a few steps towards my chair and knelt down in front of me, the parchment in his hands trembling slightly. “They say it’s due to your heritage,” he whispered, searching my face for any reactions that might tell him I knew all along.
“They told me to spy on you,” he said quietly, refusing to look away as Draco raised an eyebrow. “They want to find the remaining Death Eaters that are still running around causing havoc and they think you’d be the only way of finding them because of who your family used to be in contact with.”
that I could be half-human. Mother and father would rip their hair out if they were to find out, if they had been told there was a magical creature in our pure family history of only wizards and witches of the purest and finest blood there was. There was absolutely no way that I could be…
“He pushed me into an empty classroom and started to molest me.”
Harry gazed up into those bright grey eyes that he adored so much and held his breath. He didn’t know what he wanted to hear but he needed to hear
Dean raised his eyebrows at her, but as he saw her nod discretely, he smirked and agreed. She'd tell him what they had just done soon enough, he thought as Ginny took hold of his hand and tagged him along down the corridor in the direction of the picture with the pear.
Laughing people were mingling in the dome-like room, chatting to one another and overall waiting for the person of the evening to arrive. Said person stood in the shadows at the entrance and refused to set a foot in that nightmare of a party.
Just as he decided that he was desperate enough to get another drink, a voice inside his head, sounding suspiciously like Hermione, began scolding him.
him, would not only break Harry but infuriate me.”
Please leave a comment and tell me what you think!
“See? Everything’s alright.” Harry smiled and let himself fall back into the uncomfortable-looking wooden chair next to the blond’s bed. “Everything that we’ll have left of this night is the wound on your arm, and that will hopefully fade with time.”
A booming laugh had them freeze again as Harry pushed away from the wall he had been leaning against and leaned down to them, still giggling, as he tried to pull her away from the other Gryffindor who was doing his best in fending off the Slytherin as the latter pulled him onto his feet, the sneer more prominent on his aristocratic face than usual.
Harry Potter scowled at the large banner hanging above the festively decorated ball room in a rarely used part of the Ministry of Magic. People had told him that this part used to be where balls and festivities were being held, long before he was even born. Now the words ‘Third Anniversary of Harry Potter’s Triumph’ labelled the room Harry had no desire whatsoever to enter.
were the one who kept telling me that it would all be over once Voldemort was dead.
That time, seeing him with a bloated and burned face, a determination so sickening and incredible that he had felt his stomach drop... His breath caught in his throat as he looked at his trembling hand, still holding onto the door knob.

“How did you get me out of there?” he asked after a couple of minutes of trying to breathe calmly and evenly, and failing spectacularly.
Sometimes people had to be forced into being happy. Especially if said people were as stubborn as one Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy.

?” Malfoy recoiled, his eyes wide. “Of course not! That’s disgusting, why would you even ask me that?”
He didn’t know how long he was lying there on the chilly floor, but the dizziness did not go away; quite the contrary. The whole room had started to spin around him, forcing him to squeeze his eyes shut in order to not vomit right onto the fine mahogany. His arm was pulsating painfully, and he figured that the blood had already soaked through the pillow. That had to be a first! Not being killed by the Dark Lord or his goons, but bleeding to death because of a stupid wound. If he weren’t nearly unconscious and lucid enough, he would’ve found a certain irony in there.
This one was for the Harry Potter's World forum on FFN. (Come and join us! It's a lot of fun and there are no word count restrictions or deadlines!

“Of course! Limpy can do that, Miss. Limpy will bring tea there immediately, Miss.” And with another
“She’s fine!” Harry hurried to say and pushed a wound-up Draco Malfoy back into his pillows. “She’s completely fine now. She was hit with a cutting curse. Nothing Madam Pomfrey couldn’t fit. She’s on bed rest for the next day, but after that she’ll be back to her usual cheery self, I promise.”
*~*HP*~*
His eyes were focused on Harry’s face, which looked so different from the last time he had been able to touch and kiss him.
He sighed as he saw Hermione and Ron Weasley hurry towards him. Ron was fidgeting with his collar, Hermione tried to withstand the reflex to roll her eyes. It didn’t look really attractive if one did such a childish thing while wearing expensive dressing gowns and attending a victory party that was being held for their friend.
"Don't," he whispered and gently wiped a crystal tear from his boyfriend's face. "Don't cry. I understand."
*~*HP*~*
“I know what you’re trying to do. I know you want to
, he thought sadly as he felt his heartbreak into a million pieces, lying unmoving just like the globes of the broken heirloom.
“Please, Harry,” a soft voice interrupted the tense silence that had filled the room after his outburst.
“I want to see a five-foot essay on my desk next Monday,” Professor McGonagall said, her voice raised to be heard over the loud groans of the seventh years. “And no moaning! This is your N.E.W.T. year, so buckle up and research. Class dismissed.”
Astoria swallowed back tears as she turned her eyes towards her sister. "But he isn't."
“Hello father,” he said politely, because there wasn’t any love between them. He respected the man who sired him, but that was all.
Draco didn’t want to do anything but kiss this wonderful, strong boy, but held himself back. A lot had happened since the last time they had really talked to each other, and no matter how much it hurt, he had sworn himself to follow Harry’s lead. So, when he blinked away his happy tears and saw the love of his life smirk at him, his heart skipped a beat.
"Don't be ridiculous, Harry," Hermione snapped and whirled around from where she had been keeping an eye on the mansion. "We have to leave now and with 'we' I mean all of us. Draco," the blond's head jerked up, light grey eyes looked at her tiredly, "can you stand up?"
He was crying heavily now, tears flowing freely over his cheeks without being wiped away. And Draco just stood there in the doorway, hands on each side of his body, doing nothing. He just looked at him. And did nothing.
The young wizard glared at the werewolf for a few seconds before huffing and leaving the room. He didn’t care whether he’d get help. He’d go and get Draco, and if he died trying then the Order would maybe try and change their views on some points because they were just a bunch of prejudiced idiots, who couldn’t look past the obvious.
Draco froze, a shocked yet happy sob escaped his lips as he quickly whirled around and stared right into blinking green eyes that looked at him with both surprise, relief and love.
Of course, he'd forgotten the flour. When he came back the next morning, long after Hermione and Ron were gone, he didn't bother mentioning it.
"Why were you rummaging through my things?"
“You will do what?” His mother yelled and jumped up, completely forgetting about the cowering young man next to her. “I am fed up with this constant pureblood talk you can’t push aside for one moment, Lucius! This is your son! You should be happy that he has found someone who he deems worthy of his love and attention! You know he doesn’t give that to anyone lightly! You have made sure of that! You should be happy that he trusts us enough to tell us - in the full knowledge that he might possibly disappoint us!”
“With ‘current situation’ you mean the last two years, right?”
Why did he even bother to leave the somewhat warm Common Room in favour of the cold stone halls of Hogwarts?
There were two sides to the medal, however. Draco hadn't been someone Harry could fully trust. Well,
“Would you mind telling us what exactly you’re doing in an unused broom cupboard, both covered in dust?” Harry grinned down at her as she straightened her school robes, trying not to blush too much.
“I had started to think he was even more thickheaded than I had originally believed him to be.” Hermione grinned at her, a mug of hot cocoa in her hands. She had asked an elf for one earlier and had immediately wrapped her fingers around the warm porcelain when it had been delivered. Ginny watched Hermione’s subconscious smile every time it filled up automatically.

This one was about writing a story based on Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. Tricky, but so much fun!
"Hey." Harry looked up and saw the blond standing in the doorway, looking worried. Go figure. "Are you okay?"
"Avada Kedavra!"
“Nothing happened to you?” he asked, still mildly sceptical that the bookworm got hurt but Mister
Adrenaline pumped through his veins, washing away the pain and fear. Another one of his hexes missed its target and burned a hole into the doorway. A yelled, "Crucio" had him duck out of the way as the forbidden curse flew past him and out the glassless window behind him.

Grey eyes fluttered open and stared into glowing green ones.
"I'm fine," the raven-haired wizard bit out through clenched teeth and looked up as he heard excited voices shouting his name.
“Yes. Could you please bring some tea into the downstairs parlour? My husband, son and I would like to have a nice afternoon conversing.”
“Draco, breathe!”
“I wouldn’t expect a Death Eater to understand the word ‘honour’,” she retorted spitefully.
“Nothing!” Harry exclaimed, looking a mix of indignant and sheepish. “
“Seems like it,” Draco laughed nervously, and pushed a hand through his hair. Harry was rubbing off on him in more ways than just one. “Is he alright?” The question slipped out before he could stop himself.
“Oh, yeah?” Harry laughed and whirled around. “You have a weird way of showing that!”
“What?” He hissed back as he nodded to Harry in thanks. “It’s itching like hell, ‘Mione! I can’t help it.”
"Draco."
Voldemort did not react whatsoever. His red eyes were watching Draco closely, his dark-tinged magic sending spiky tendrils into the blond’s thoughts, looking for unguarded thoughts.

I actually told my best friend that we were past that phase when we used to try everything in our power to lure each other into traps! Seems like I was wrong. Again.” Harry turned around and started to pick up his clothes that were lying on the bed. “I actually thought you wanted to make a truce.”
*~*HPDM*~*
“Well, what do you suppose should have happened?” She hissed quietly and annoyed, both with him, herself and the two lovebirds outside the dirty broom cupboard they were hiding in which was filled with dusty, old brooms, rusty buckets and bottles of unknown liquids... and probably about a hundred or so spiders hiding behind the items stored in there.
Confused and somewhat dizzy, he turned to look at what Malfoy found so interesting that it was worth stopping his explanation and talk with him. He blinked as a bright light blinded him for a second. "What the-"
Ever again.
“I know that, love, but others don’t think the way you do,” Draco mumbled as Harry voiced his opinions out loud. “They will always see me as one of Voldemort’s followers and it doesn’t matter to them what I did was a forced reaction or a voluntary one.”
I can only imagine it too well... Harry being forced by Hermione to attend this stupid ball....
A beautiful smile stretched over Harry’s tired face, his eyes closed as he hummed softy. Draco couldn’t help himself but reach out and cradle Harry’s face in the palm of his hand. Warmth spread through his arm and up towards his heart.
“Oh, sorry.”
He turned off the water and grabbed a towel, which he used to run through his wet hair. Trickles of water ran down his neck and over his broad chest as he wrapped a dry towel around his waist and ran his fingers through his tangled hair, in hope of at least flattening it somewhat. He sighed. It looked even worse than before. Throwing the wet hair towel into the washbasin, he opened the door. A cloud of steam followed him outside and he froze.

choice and his alone.
“Will you tell me what’s wrong?” Draco’s voice was low and quiet. It seemed to blend into the background noise of crackling fire and calmed his panicked thoughts down even more.
.” And with that the lady in the portrait tutted and swung forward.
“I heard you and Nott talk earlier. Outside of the library. And now I will ask for the last time. Why are you treating Harry like this?” Crossing her arms in front of her chest, Ginny glared at Malfoy, waiting impatiently. She wanted to get out of here. Just looking at his face made her want to vomit.
“He’s in his dorm, then?” Dejectedly, Draco looked up the staircase. He wouldn’t be able to see him then. He would have to wait yet another day to see and hopefully talk to him. The hole inside him grew as the newly acquired knowledge settled in.
At first, he hadn’t really thought of it as something real, just like when kids played dress-up and pretended to be a superhero; he had wrapped himself in one of his father’s black cloaks, and pretended to be a bad wizard, powerful and feared by all around him. It had been fun, so even as a teenager he had looked back at those playdates with a fond smile on his face.
Hermione sighed and leant back into her chair. It was a Thursday evening, so, technically speaking, a school night, but this current gossip couldn’t have waited any longer. “I mean, I started to get suspicious as Harry got obsessed with following Malfoy during our sixth year, but he always ensured us that it was purely because Malfoy was planning something and, along with everything else, I just didn’t think about it anymore. But when Malfoy actually greeted Harry at the start of term? It was just a matter of time.”
The heavy hand on his shoulder squeezed painfully as Lucius softly cleared his throat. “You will be asked to give this filth what it deserves,” he muttered in a gentle tone, almost caringly, lovingly. He nearly sounded as deranged as his dear auntie Bella. Draco clenched his teeth together. “You will do as our Lord demands. You will then bow down and take on your true destiny.”
Potter did not.
Draco Malfoy was never more aggravated than during those official festivities where he was just being invited to due to one handsome wizard going by the name of Harry James Potter.
Draco stood there, not having moved an inch. His gaze resting on Harry, his lips tugged into a sad smile.
Tonight was the night of his initiation.
, that the bet existed, that you had to find out that way, that I’ve hurt you, that I’ve-“ His rambling was stopped with two very soft lips pressing against his softly, melting against his. He gasped and Harry took this opportunity to run his tongue along Draco’s teeth, teasing and testing. A shudder ran down Draco’s spine and straight to his groin. He moaned softly as Harry’s hand touched his cheek gently, letting his tongue explore the insides of Draco’s wonderful tasting mouth.
Astoria watched silently as her sister pulled out a pair of Muggle rubber gloves, pulled them over her hands and picked up a small vial from the wooden surface. "Why the gloves?" The young witch frowned as Daphne shot her a look.

Without torturing himself even more by turning back around, he reached out to open the door that would lead him out of the dorm room and away from the love of his life. Just as his hand touched the metal of the door knob, a weak voice reached his ears.
What the hell are you doing here?
His light laughter echoed through the small room as the crickets sang outside.
It had been about three hours since the Dark Lord had fallen, and Draco Malfoy didn’t know what would come next. All of his life, he had been prepared to join a war in the making, to fight for a side he hated with all that he had. Yet, being a good son and afraid of what would happen to his family, he had done as he had been told.
“Oh Merlin, Harry! I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean for any of this to happen! Really! I-“
Draco scowled. “Oh, really?” The sarcasm that dripped from those two words made Harry snicker softly behind him. He fought the smile that wanted to show itself.
Prompt: Write about someone keeping a minor secret.
“Thank you for telling me,” he murmured.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up as he scrutinised his horrified boyfriend as he was trying to rip his hair out of his scalp.
now, is it?"
Harry gaped at the old wizard sitting behind the old oak desk he had sat in front of so many times. His facial expression was serious, neutral. The roughly twenty people that were currently scattered throughout Dumbledore’s office, all staring at him with more or less cold expressions were the least one of his worries at this moment. He blinked as he tried to take in what his mentor had just asked him to do. This couldn’t be true. He had to have misunderstood what this wise man had wanted to –
“Are you sure?”
"Draco," his mother's voice was calm as her empty eyes focused on her son. "It's time."
Harry blinked for a second, pausing in his dinner preparations, before nodding. "Yeah, I think so."
A smile lightened up the Slytherin’s face as Harry leaned forward and caught his lips in a sweet kiss that would forever be engraved in his memories.
He felt oddly empty. He had spent so much time thinking about what would happen tonight that he didn't have any energy left to waste, no more tears to spend. He was fully and truly empty, exhausted to a degree he had not thought possible.
“Well...” Ginny broke off. How should she tell him? She was about to break his heart, how the hell was she supposed to do that?! It wouldn’t do him any favour of putting it mildly, making it seem less serious. She had known it all along! Draco Malfoy couldn’t be trusted, and it was her duty to keep her friend from getting heartbroken and humiliated! “Yes,” she said, keeping a close eye on his reaction. “There is something wrong. It’s Malfoy.”
Shaking his head, Harry exhaled shakily and glanced to the young Slytherin sitting next to him. A frown darkened his beautiful and flawless face and Harry complied with the urge of raising his hand and gently rubbing at the wrinkle between two perfectly formed blond eyebrows. A soft smile and a roll of light grey eyes were his reward.
He had once asked his father why they had cells and a torture chamber down there, and the man had answered with an annoyed, "Malfoy Manor is older than you can imagine, son, and back then the times were harder and more dangerous than they are now."  Never having heard the screams of the prisoners, he had believed this answer to mean that his father would never make use of the rooms the dungeons housed.

that had survived and not Voldemort. He wanted to tell him so much, but all he could do was stare at those beautiful lips and those brilliant eyes…

“I’ll find something! There has to be a potion for things like that!”

After the Triwizard Tournament, when Harry Potter had appeared outside the maze, cup clutched in one hand, and the lifeless body of Cedric Diggory in his other, he had known that the peaceful life had ended – that
Harry felt tingling butterflies do somersaults in his stomach. Seeing the dishevelled Draco Malfoy standing in front of him not being his perfectly organized self, stuttering for words, missing his gel and shoes, he felt an odd warmth spread through his body. Draco Malfoy was a pure-blood wizard to whom it was very important to be collected, strong and self-assured and yet he wasn’t anything but perfect in Harry’s eyes. He swallowed and shook his head slightly as Draco shifted and glanced up to him, looking through his bangs that hang into his beautiful face.
Trust can be gained but also lost.
On any other day, he would count down the hours until his parents would retire, so that he could force a house elf to keep its mouth shut if he wanted to stay in the service of his family for a day longer as he sneaked out of his room, down the multiple corridors that led through the whole mansion, down the grand stair case and out the doors. He would always choose one of the back entrances, the ones that were only used by servants and house elves. The sky was always clear, as if it knew what the young wizard was up to. Thunder would only wake his parents up and would, thus, make it impossible for him to seek after what he truly wanted.
The older Malfoy looked to his master, his eyes wide with panic. “I assure you, my Lord, that this is a misunderstanding. Draco is merely nervous about what will happen...”
Even at Hogwarts he hadn’t been able to breathe because students tended to follow him everywhere he went – the library, the class rooms – no matter whether it was an eighth year class and they were supposed to be in a second year one. Some even had the courage to march straight into the Quidditch changing rooms which had not only been horribly embarrassing for his boxershorts-clad self but for the other team members as well.
Harry tapped his foot, annoyed, his arms crossed over his chest, as he glared in the direction that he knew led to the dungeons.  He and Draco met at the bottom of the Great Stairs each morning, kiss each other hello and go to the Great Hall to have breakfast together – either at the Gryffindor or the Slytherin table. It was Slytherin’s turn today.
Pansy took a sip of her Earl Grey. "I need a story for my chief editor and I need it to be
Her glare zoned in on me. “Follow their instructions, of course.”
"No, Draco, I'm not okay."
He swallowed painfully as he watched Draco carefully fasten the watch around his wrist. He wanted to know whether Draco was taking this, their relationship, seriously.
Dumbledore looked at him over his half moon shaped glasses that perched on the bridge of his nose. His fingers intertwined as he patiently waited for Harry to regain his ability to think and understand the spoken words.
“I don’t know what you want me to say, Theo,” Draco Malfoy whined and pushed a hand through his immaculate hair. Which was very uncharacteristic of him, Ginny thought, but a lot had changed during the last year, so she let it slide in favour of focussing on the conversation she was sure was not meant for her ears to hear.
He was downright fuming at this point and struggling to keep his voice even. "I found the destroyed remains of a watch; the same exact watch that happens to be a family heirloom, which I gave to you
Draco stared at the very angry-looking Harry Potter in front of him. He was fuming. His handsome face was red, his beautiful eyes flashing and his adorable hair pointing in every direction. His fit body was still glistening with drops of water that ran out of his hair and caressed every perfect curve of the porcelain skin. Draco swallowed as he felt his blood flow in a direction he did not want it in at the moment. “Will you let me explain?” His voice was a mere whisper. He didn’t trust himself to speak normally, as he feared his voice might crack with the pressure that was lying on his shoulders right now. He wanted Harry to see! He needed Harry to see and he couldn’t fail!
“Draco!”
Thoughts about being disowned or killed seemed favourable at the moment and those feelings scared the hell out of him. He had never wanted to die. He thought his life a very big deal and nothing to play with. Being a Malfoy had always been a source of pride but being just Draco sounded safer to him now.
“Have you lost your freaking mind?” Harry shrieked and pushed Blaise’s hand out of the way. “No-one will obliviate anyone! Seriously!”
Sitting at a table with Malfoy now, having burning candles between them, the silver crockery glistening beautifully, he had to ask himself whether Hermione had been right the whole time.
“Why did you come here for, love?” His mother’s soft voice interrupted his thoughts as she looked at him, concerned. “You don’t have trouble with the Ministry, have you?”
followers of the most powerful dark Wizard there ever had been.
“Yes, Zabini. He was getting on Draco’s nerves, but that rightful idiot is too much of a pureblood to just tell him to bugger off and leave him alone.” That was the first time Nott had said anything and his words turned her stomach upside down.
“What are you doing here?” His voice was deadly calm, but his head was spinning. How did he get in? Why did he come here? What else did he want?
“Why did you come?” The softly asked question echoed through the deadly silent room, jumping off of the cold stone walls, assaulting the two people currently staring at each other; silver eyes emotionless, emerald ones unbelieving.
Draco smirked softly as Potter was busy rubbing his eyes.
“Yes, I’m fine.”
He was sitting on the broad window sill. The glass shielded him from the rain outside as thunder made the earth vibrate. No birds were visible tonight; they were hiding and seeking shelter as he wished he could. But he couldn't. Not for the lack of trying, though. A deep sense of helplessness washed through him as he imagined being able to just walk out of this prison he was forced to call a bedroom, through the multiple hallways that led through the whole mansion and out one of the back doors, just as he had done so many times before. Back then he had still been able to escape, even if it had been for a couple of hours each day, week or month. Now, though, he would not dare as to remove his person out of these four walls.
Harry could not even hear the thunder that was raging on outside. Thick stone walls were hiding him from the power of nature.  House elves that were usually hurrying around, waving cleaning rags or carrying tea trays were nowhere to be seen. Even the portraits that were usually eager to comment on whoever entered the main hall were quiet.
Prompts:
Harry’s head turned towards Hermione automatically, who grabbed hold of Ron’s hand as his eyes focused on her. She was nervously biting her bottom lip, her teeth leaving white marks on the soft pink flesh and her cheeks were slightly darker than usual.
“I came to apologize.” Draco winced as he saw the dead look in Harry’s bright green eyes. They glared at him as if they wished for him to drop dead this instant. “I didn’t want it to escalate like that.”
Soft footsteps caused Ginny to gasp and wiggle forward a bit so that she could peek through the key hole in the wooden door, touching his knee with her bum in the process. Dean squeezed his eyes shut tightly to keep his body’s normal reaction at bay and held his breath. He didn’t want Ginny’s wrath directed on him, Merlin forbid!
He would go even without her help. She knew him. She had grown up by his side, had gotten to know how he ticked and how he acted. The only difference between her staying or her going would be his chance of survival. She didn’t have a choice. She never did. But she didn’t care. She wouldn’t risk her brother’s life over anything. Even if that meant sneaking into Malfoy Manor. But, hey – it wasn’t as if they hadn’t done that before, right?
*~*Artist’s Flame*~*
Harry sniffed loudly, wiped away his tears, and sat up straight as he heard Draco close the front door.
Harry raised his head slowly and narrowed his eyes. The bright green irises blazed and Hermione gasped softly as she saw the anger in those usually warm depths.
She gritted her teeth as she glared at the old leather-bound book in front of her. Books had never failed her before and she wouldn’t let this stupid essay cause her to feel as if they did now!
Ron stared at her as if she had lost her mind, his mouth hanging slightly open. “That was the worst plan I’ve ever heard you come up with, ‘Mione.”
Laughter filled the room as Voldemort moved past the Malfoys and stopped right in front of the terrified Muggle.
How did he...
“I know you didn’t.” Pulling away slightly to look his boyfriend into the eyes, he smiled softly. “It wasn’t your fault.” A thin strand of white-blond hair fell into one of the grey eyes that were currently staring into bright green ones. “We’ll manage, love. I promise!”
On any other day, his heart would beat calmly in his chest, already used to the secrets and thrill that came with his activities.
“This is really important,” she said, blinking rapidly. Harry stared at her, unable to react. This couldn’t be true. This couldn’t be reality! Did she not listen to one single word that he had just said? “We have to find out how many Death Eaters are still out there and the only option we have to do this is to use our only remaining Death Eater link—“
He stopped at the double doors which led into the Great Hall. The once happy room now held an air of devastation and death. The fallen had been carried in there, and had been laid side by side. It was a grotesque view. In between the rows of bodies, various wizards and witches were moving around. Nurses and Healers were scurrying through the injured; they gave out spoon-fulls of potions and waved their wands over one burned arm or a severed leg.
“Any moment now the Dark Lord will arrive,” Lucius Malfoy’s voice was soft, velvety, almost gentle, as he whispered into his son’s ear. “He will welcome his followers, and he will include you in that welcome. Us Malfoys have been on the side of power and influence for generations now, and to now have a Lord as generous and fair as ours is, is truly a blessing. We have no right to be anything but thankful, Draco.”

“Harry, please, just let us think this through beforehand!” Hermione said desperately, her hands wringing nervously as she watched Harry hurry through his bedroom and grab his father’s cloak. “I’m sure we’ll find a solution that is perfectly safe.”
was only of physical nature. Because he had to admit… Potter was fit!
His plush and light pink lips stretched into a loving smile, his emerald orbs glistened with unshed tears and just as a soft thumb stroked his cheek did he realize that he was crying as well. He had not realized just how much he had needed these words.
Comment and tell me what you think!

“It’s going to be all right, Malf-
“My idea,” Daphne raised her head and stared right into Draco’s narrowed eyes. “You are betrothed to my sister. Your family has a binding contract with my family which existed even before the two of you were born. It is your duty to answer your family’s wishes, Draco! I wanted to remind you of that.”
And to top it off, Draco had not yet deemed Harry a visit. He had not seen the blonde wizard for a whole day and as he walked through the dark corridors of Hogwarts, making his curfew round as a Prefect, he couldn’t stop wondering what this was about.
"Is it the one I think it is?" Draco's excited voice came out of the telephone lying next to the mixer on the counter. "The one with the broccoli?"
I watched as his eyes narrowed slightly, just to quadruplicate in size right afterwards. He stared at the yellowish parchment in his hands, his pink lips slightly open. I frowned and moved a step towards him.

“Where are they?”
Draco scoffed and put his tea cup onto its saucer. "Of course, I know. You were the one to spread the rumours."

Malfoy blinked and turned to Nott, who merely shrugged. He didn’t look at all worried at her confrontation. “What exactly did I do, Weasley?” Malfoy sounded oddly tentative as he looked up at her.
The bushy-haired witch looked at Harry for some painfully long seconds. Her best friend had hectic red spots that were colouring his cheeks, his eyes were wide and desperate, and the hand that wasn’t clutching the cloak as if his life depended on it – which was very likely – clenched and unclenched in a nervous manner.
Harry pushed down his trousers and walked into the bathroom, clad in nothing but boxers. He had to take a shower. He felt dirty.
Hermione sat up and put her mug down on top of the coffee table. Upon contact, the porcelain started whirring just before the cup proceeded to jump up and down, anxious to be picked up again. “You’ll see,” she said with so much certainty that Ginny couldn’t help but believe her, “Malfoy’s changed. He would never hurt Harry.
And all of a sudden, he wasn’t so sure whether he should enter this room. He didn’t belong here. The warm feeling that had engulfed him as he had entered through the portrait hole was exchanged by a cold sense of
The young witch turned around towards her attacker and looked into the apologetic face of her boyfriend.
Memories of a conversation he had had the week before washed through his mind.
"I am so sorry! I didn't think they would find us," Malfoy closed the door behind him with a slight huff and turned around. A frown was darkening his beautiful face. Harry blinked and tried not to let his thoughts show on his face. Hermione had told him one time too many that whatever he was thinking was on display for literally everyone that knew him well enough and he wasn't that sure yet whether Malfoy was one of 'everyone'.
“He should not be nervous, my dear sniffling servant. He should embrace the opportunity instead of acting like a filthy blood traitor.”
“I didn’t know that this was what I found out. To be honest, I didn’t want to think about it being a possibility, but having spent last night with you…” A shy smile crept onto his face. His pink cheeks highlighted his bright grey eyes as he tried to, once again, find the right words. “I don’t want to go back to how it used to be! I don’t want to act as if nothing has changed because something
Draco ground his teeth and forced himself to stay rooted to the spot. He needed to find Harry. He couldn’t think about what people might do or yell once they’d seen him. All he wanted, all he
Cautiously, as to not make any sound, Harry pulled the door shut, twisting the doorknob in the last second to keep it from falling shut and possibly alerting any house elves. Trying to calm his nerves, he hurried further down the hallway to the next door. He pushed it open, only to find a relatively small room filled with bookshelves that reached to just underneath the ceiling. A desperate huff escaped him, and he moved to the next door.
His mother waved her hand in a authoritative manner, and he forced himself off the window still and onto his feet. The way the witch held herself, Draco figured that she had made sure to have her wand somewhere from where she could easily and quickly grab it. He didn't fancy being disarmed by his mother and led to the meeting room at wand point, so he decided to not give her a reason to literally force him into his imminent future.
as it locked itself. Draco could only guess how many protection spells and runes activated themselves in that very moment.
I tried to smile back, only remembering too late that it probably looked like I wanted to kill her for real. I winced as her smiled vanished and Harry’s hand squeezed my knee.
Until next time - see ya!
Nobody but Draco had known that he would be anything but a loyal servant. He hadn’t wanted to be a servant at all. It hadn’t been his decision as his father had woken him up one morning during summer break, had told him to get dressed in his finest robes and had taken him to his initiation ceremony. He had been forced to bow to the monster himself, standing in front of huddling and trembling cowards, and kiss his muddy boots. He had never felt so embarrassed and ashamed of himself as a person.
“You don’t have to ask me that question, Harry, because I absolutely agree with you. In fact, Kingsley made use of the exact same fact, but not many seemed to care. I’m sorry.”
“It’s from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures,” he said in a low voice, his eyes never leaving mine.
Harry was the best part of who Draco Malfoy was, and losing him would mean losing his own identity. Harry was not only his hope and love, but also his life. He didn’t know what he would do if the other didn’t want him anymore. He knew that he would let him go if that was what Harry wanted, but he also knew that he himself might not survive the separation.
“Hermione got hurt when we were getting you out of there,” he said and looked up at the wide grey eyes that were staring at him as if he had lost his mind.
“I’ve heard what you said,” Harry heard himself snap, ignoring the sharp intakes of air of a few people in the room he slowly started to hate that followed almost immediately after. “I’m not deaf.”
Harry's eyes jumped up to his boyfriend's face and he could feel a flicker of doubt course through him. "Of course, that's why I gave it to you," he said with more confidence than he was feeling. "I found it in the family vault and thought you might like it."
“Tonight,” he said in a calm voice, his arms spread wide as if to welcome each and every one of them, “we are gathered here for the initiation of Draco Malfoy. It is an honour to receive the mark, a sign of your true and unbreakable loyalty to what is right. Therefore, as tradition calls for it, there will be a ritual taking place,” he paused, and looked from one Death Eater to the other. Draco had never understood why he preferred them being masked and thus unrecognisable.
He had to leave. Now. It was too risky taking down Death Eater after Death Eater, possibly attracting new ones to his location.
Harry chuckled softly as he grabbed the rolling pin. "But don't forget the flour," he repeated before grabbing what was left of his stock and dusting the dough with it. "Because otherwise, I can't really make a pie out of it."
He turned on his heels and fled out of the classroom, his rounds completely forgotten. He needed to get away. Now.
It had been long past curfew when the door of the Room of Requirement opened and revealed a blond wizard stumbling into their secret meeting place. Harry was sitting on a soft dark green couch in front of the fire and stared into the flames, not reacting to the footsteps he could hear coming up to him. What had happened earlier in the evening had been bothering him and had filled all of his thoughts. He was still not over the fact that people he thought of as his family would tell him to betray a loved one.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with him,” Blaise exclaimed and started gesturing wildly, nearly punching his girlfriend in the face. “Last time I checked he was all lovey-dovey with Harry and now he behaves like Harry doesn’t even exist and starts running after me! I don’t get it!”
"I can't," he said. He had to fight to keep the tremor out of his voice. He wanted nothing more than listen to him and believe him when he said that everything would be okay, that he would be safe and nobody would be able to get to him, but he had to remain realistic. As tempting as it sounded, he had to shake his head and face the reality.
“He got a letter from your department earlier this morning, saying that he had to come to a hearing due to his newly acquired heritage,” Harry answered calmly, a gentle and peaceful smile decorated his soft lips. I swallowed. God, how much I loved that man.
"I thought this would be more fitting." Harry's eyes jumped up and locked with Malfoy's pale grey ones. He had never noticed that they had a slight blue tint in them, giving them the look of ice crystals. "When I asked you out yesterday morning, I wasn't just asking for forgiveness or whatever people like me should ask for. I know this might seem strange and weird, considering how I have behaved in the past and you have no reason whatsoever to actually believe me now, but I…"
Until next time - see ya! :D
at that! You will end this immediately, Draco, do you hear me? You will stop thinking with a certain part of your anatomy and start thinking like a Malfoy! With your brain! You will end it this very instance or I will-“
Confessing something disdained is never easy, but Draco's heart gives him strength to do what must be done - tell his parents he's in love. With Harry Potter.
The floor was covered in dark, polished wood, one huge, dark grey carpet lying in the middle of the wide hallway. Family portraits were decorating the also wooden walls, trying desperately, but failing spectacularly, to give this part of the mansion a homely feel to it. Guarded expressions, stiff postures and dull eyes did not exactly scream, ‘welcome.’
"Brilliant!"
"About one hundred metres! Incendio!" Ron yelled, quickly followed by a pained scream as one Death Eater lit up in flames, involuntarily taking two others down with him.
A shocked gasp escaped Harry before he could bite it back. Not caring whether anyone would find him anymore, he threw the door shut behind him, quickly sending a locking charm in its general direction. His cloak lay on the floor, entirely forgotten, as he rushed forward and fell onto his knees next to the person that meant the world to him.
Taking a deep breath, Harry checked whether he really was on his own in the deserted hallway and lifted his cloak off of his left hand, his right reaching for his wand. His trembling fingers curled around the cold metal of the doorknob and twisted.
On any other day, he would watch the sky for any signs of a certain white owl carrying a much waited for piece of parchment, fully knowing that what he was doing was unwelcome, forbidden, dangerous.
"Relax, I just wanted to see how it was going," she snickered and eyed the hastily thrown-over blanket that Draco was clutching onto like a lifeline. "So, your elf was right then. You
“I couldn’t have left you on your own, Draco, and you know that,” the raven-haired wizard forced his voice to not tremble. His heart was beating faster than usual, thumping violently against his rib cage, threatening to burst out of its protective shell, right into the lap of the one and only who could destroy it with a simple flick of his wrist. “I would never have left you. I told you I would stay by your side, no matter what.”
“The Weasel and Granger? Really?”
Ginny wondered as she strained to hear what the two were saying. They had to be talking about Harry, right? Who else was there? It was obvious to everyone but the two that Harry liked Malfoy and Malfoy liked Harry. Those looks, those gestures, those
‘’Yeah,’’ Malfoy said, his head cocking to the side, ‘’why is that so surprising?’’ he added belatedly.
Malfoy looked at Harry - a soft, indescribable look in his eyes - and Harry let his eyes drop back down, not able to watch the grey eyes assess him.
Draco sighed as he sat down on the bed, looking at Harry, ''I never really hated him, you know, I always quite liked him actually. He doesn't think he deserves much, you know, but he
, so good, Malfoy,” Harry spoke breathlessly.
As they started to near the ground, Malfoy slowly turned to look at him and Harry met his gaze.
''Promise me you will tell him yourself how you feel about him.''
Harry sighed, as the words Malfoy had thrown at him ran through his mind again.
‘’Well, this is fun,’’ Malfoy commented sarcastically, and Harry only hummed nervously in affirmation.
‘’What about dinner?’’ Harry whispered, hot breath ghosting across Draco’s skin, and Draco whined softly.
‘’Happy birthday, love,’’ Harry whispered, eyes twinkling, before once more smiling nervously at him. Draco frowned in question, but Harry only stepped back. He dropped the hand from Draco’s face, but kept his left hand linked with Draco’s right.
Malfoy’s expression turned sheepish at Harry’s confused look, and answered with a small shrug, ‘’I have kind of been looking for a way to talk to you, so when I saw you get on the ferris wheel, you know, I decided that this was my chance,’’ pale cheeks flushing at the admission.
- aspiring to be a Healer and Harry readying himself for an Auror career. Harry shook his head, this was not the place nor time to think about that.
‘’I’m sorry I didn’t wish you before, I was scared I would blow my cover,’’ Harry apologised. Draco looked at Harry, his arms looping around Harry’s neck. He tilted his head with a mischievous smile, and Harry raised an eyebrow.
''No,
, he had to admit) ramble off, ‘’yeah.’’
“So, do fish actually breathe air, or do they breathe water?” Draco’s voice filled the room, breaking Harry’s thoughts and Harry sighed, his fingers tightening around his pillow - which was back underneath his head, instead of on his face.
Except, he’d thought too soon.
“What are you looking at, Potter?” Malfoy spat.
Harry pulled his head away from where it was rested in the crook of Draco’s neck to look at Draco, green eyes glowing.
“We consider ourselves dry, surrounded by air, but the minute a drop of water hits us, we consider ourselves wet.”
. The second thought was
Harry moved his hips erratically, images of Draco flashing in front of his eyes. He felt the man tighten around him, the man's cock twitching and voice keening as he finished and Harry growled, hips speeding up, before he - as well - finishes with a low sigh of
A warm hand came to rest on his chest, right in the middle, and Harry gasped.
In a moment, they were standing in Draco's living room, Harry manoeuvring them up the stairs until they were in Draco's bedroom.
“Stop fucking teasing and
The silence was once more broken by Malfoy, ‘’So, what are you doing up here?’’
. He really does. I could never tell him how I feel, though, I still can't tell him how I feel - I can't tell him that I love him,'' Draco murmured.
''I promise you, he feels the same way about you. Just tell him,'' Harry said softly, a smile gracing his lips.
A feeling of hurt rushed through his body, and he knew it displayed on his face, when Malfoy looked at him with dark, clouded eyes.
Harry smiled brightly, nodding. “Brilliant, sounds like a good idea. Pick you up in an hour?”
He felt his heart go into overdrive, forgetting for a moment to keep himself in check as his heart was being monitored, the feeling of Draco’s hand burning through his Auror uniform.
"I thought you’d never ask,’’ Draco answered simply, smiling widely, pulling a stumbling and giggling Harry along with him.
Malfoy dropped to his knees and Harry opened his eyes, whimpering at the sight, and at the realisation that
He hadn't known he had wanted the touch - had missed, craved the touch -  of the man standing in front of him until Malfoy had touched him again, after all those years apart.
Draco hummed, his fingers tracing the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck, revelling in the way Harry shivered against him.
Harry looked back at the bed, watching Draco sleep for a few moments, his heart swelling in his chest as he remembered the words Draco had spoken.
Just as they were about to close the cart he was sitting in, and Harry was about to faint from the panic welling inside of him, a voice called out, ‘’Wait! Can I get on there as well?’’
His hands were cramping up from all the clenching, but Harry didn’t dare unclench his fingers either.
They sat in silence, Malfoy’s thumb rubbing along the back of his hand in comfort, and Harry’s heart nearly pounding out of his chest. The soft touch of Malfoy’s hand against his somewhat calming the rush of adrenaline within his veins. The ride down was silent - neither of them talking, instead both lost in their own thoughts.
he thought,
“Everything seems to look alright, Potter. I only need to check up on your heart real quick, and then we’re done.”
For seconds, they both sat staring, stupidly smiling at each other, before they got - literally - jolted from their daydream by the cart stopping at the entrance/exit of the ride.
He threw Malfoy off with the words - and, to be quite honest, himself as well - only for one second, though, before Malfoy spoke again, slowly stalking towards Harry until he stopped right in front of Harry’s face.
he care? This was Malfoy, but for some reason Harry wanted to know - if he’s alright, why he was crying. For some reason, all Harry wanted to do was step forward and gather Malfoy into his arms, hug him close and comfort him. And, that is not the way you should feel about someone who’s your sworn nemesis. So, instead Harry stayed silent, not knowing what to say.
Harry doesn’t know why he keeps putting himself in these situations. Because,
''You look good, Malfoy.''
Harry felt his cheeks flush and cleared his throat, nodding slightly.
Harry pulled his tongue and face away from the man's ass, moving up to kiss his lips, tongue pushing through thin lips. Harry pulled away, whispering a spell and moving his hand down, resting his fingers against the wizard's opening, feeling it stretch around the tips of his fingers. The man beneath him moaned as Harry pushed two of his fingers in, scissoring, adding a third quickly, before the man was moaning and begging beneath him. Harry pulled his fingers out, positioned himself and pushed in. Harry let his head drop with a groan at the warmth that surrounded his cock, as he bottomed out. He waited for a few moments, before the wizard pushed down, and Harry pulled back, then slammed back in - hard.
Harry looked up at the use of his first name, seeing Malfoy look back at him apprehensively. They stared at each other, Malfoy fidgeting slightly, and Harry sighed.
, and watched as Draco took out his wand.
“Breathe deeply for me, in and out,” Draco’s voice rung through his ears and Harry complied, as if he wasn’t doing that already.
And Harry groaned loudly, pushing Draco away from his chest.
Harry sniffled a bit, looking at Draco, who had a shocked expression of his face and Harry let out a humorless chuckle, before he turned and started walking towards the door.
Shaking his head to clear his mind from the sweet memory, Draco folded the paper and continued his walk into the kitchen. Another piece of glowing paper was waiting for him on the counter, and Draco immediately reached for it.
To the outside world, Draco is Draco Malfoy - heir of the Malfoys. He is elegant, articulate, sassy and witty. The epitome of a Slytherin.
throughout the day. Actually,
“Done. Everything seems normal, though your heart rate was slightly faster than average. You should probably keep an eye on that,” Draco hummed, amusement lacing his words.
, Draco Malfoy step into the room, head ducked as he looked through some parchments that he was holding in his hands. His blond, now long, hair fell across his shoulder on one side, curtaining his face and Harry’s heart stuttered at the sight.
His hands roamed down Draco’s bare chest, trailing his fingers down pale, soft skin, pinching and rolling the nipples between his fingers, making Draco arch up breathlessly.
Harry didn't know if it was his - still not completely vanished - saviour side or if it were his newly developed feelings for the boy - which had started
‘’Ah, well that makes sense,” and Harry frowned at him. Malfoy quickly continued, ‘’I mean, you don’t look like you would voluntarily make the decision to step onto the ferris wheel, seeing as -,” and Malfoy vaguely gestured in Harry’s direction, ”so, like, it makes sense that you got dared to,” Malfoy said, grimacing at himself.
Draco - and yes, Harry thought of him as Draco now, sue him - looked up at Harry, after having placed the parchments on the desk, a small smile on his face.
They were cuddled on the couch, Harvey was reading a book while Harry was reading through the Daily Prophet - which had become a hilarious obsession of him while he had been dating Malfoy.
''Wait, Harry.''
A hand on his wrist stopped him and Harry's eyes dropped down, seeing pale fingers enclosing his wrist. He followed the arm up, his eyes locking on grey ones, before he twisted his arm slightly and Malfoy's hand dropped from his wrist. Harry moved to turn again, but Malfoy's voice stopped him.
Draco scoffed lightly, then nodded, understanding perfectly. The wizard before him was exceedingly powerful, but no one would recognize him as Merlin. Having the epitome of light and good, not to mention the most powerful wizard of all time, be the first person you see after death… the prospect was a little daunting for him, even now.
Perplexed, Draco asked, “Why did you need to go after Hagrid for that? You could have just asked him later,” he hesitated a moment before adding, “Besides, Hagrid hasn’t really been the best at telling you what you need to know. He’d probably just have you glance at everything.”
Ignoring Draco’s stunned expression, Olivander rang up the purchase and bid him farewell. Draco stood in shock just outside of the shop for several minutes. The wand that had chosen him, chose those with character and loyalty? Ever since his death, Draco had been wrapped in self-loathing. It had faded to the background in the time since his rebirth, but it was still very much there. To hear that his wand would not have likely chosen a dark wizard was a gift he hadn’t expected or known that he needed.
When Harry finished heaving, he remained on the floor, his entire body trembling. Draco wrapped an arm around him, feeling Harry flinch and stiffen momentarily before relaxing into the embrace. It was a curiously intimate movement, but neither interrupted it. When Harry stopped shaking, Draco moved in front of him and tilted his face until Harry’s gaze met his. Draco was horrified to see that Harry’s face was streaked with tears. It pulled at something inside him he couldn’t identify.
Disclaimer: See Chapter 1! The conception of Merlin and his role in this story is my creation, but otherwise, I own nothing!
Sometime later Kreacher quieted, looking up at Draco with fear evident in his large eyes, “B-but...if Sirius is to be r-released, Kreacher will have to serve him. Kreacher is a bad elf for saying so, but Kreacher does not want to be serving Master Sirius. Kreacher does not like Master Sirius, but Master Sirius also hates Kreacher, and his house. Even if Kreacher was wanting to help Master Sirius, Kreacher doesn’t think Master Sirius would accept.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco laughed without humour. “You hate a dead man and you torture his son! Let me ask you this: if he didn’t look like his father, would you hate him so much?” He didn’t wait for an answer as he took a calming breath. “Tomorrow morning, Harry and I will be having a very long meeting with Dumbeldore. I will teach him Occlumency, and you will not touch his mind again.”
Tormented thoughts warred with the hope in his heart as he watched the magic, unseen to the rest of the world, stretch out towards his match.
“...hurting Young Master!”
As Draco finished shouting, he unclenched his fists and let out a heavy breath. He jerked up his head and stared at Harry, as though suddenly remembering where he was. Harry could see the panic in his eyes but was highly suspicious of Draco’s phrasing.
This chapter is shorter than the previous one, but I thought it a good place to stop for Harry. I already had this one typed up and ready to go, but hopefully I'll be able to post the next one soon. Review, please!
He almost felt relieved, although he knew he should have been punished for all the things he had done.
His mother responded by smiling gently, “That sounds wonderful. I was unable to accompany Draco today, and I think it would be beneficial to him if he were able to gather his school supplies with someone his own age. Unless your guardian would have a problem with that?” she said, looking pointedly at Hagrid, her tone practically daring him to respond negatively.
When they arrived in the muggle neighborhood, Draco looked at the space where Dobby was standing, having made himself invisible to prevent exposure. For his part, Draco was dressed in jeans, a white t-shirt, and his leather jacket. He smiled at the thought of his father seeing him like this; he was fairly sure the man would drop dead from shock.
“Yeah, I get what you mean. Honestly, though, that’s kind of a relief. Maybe I’m not that far behind,” Harry said, his tone and posture more relaxed than before.
This was evil incarnate.
“So?” Harry asked stubbornly, “Who cares about that? You aren’t your family or your father. I’m inviting you to come with us. Do you want to?”
Harry’s eyes blurred with unshed tears as he read the elegant script once again. Draco had burst into his flat and handed him the poem, and now he was kneeling, holding a ring.
He closed his eyes and allowed himself to succumb to the comfort of darkness.
Draco ignored him, completely focused on his task. Harry grumbled slightly, but remained still, knowing it wasn't worth the pain to fight the Slytherin.
The inner pep talk didn’t work very well, but as they made their way back to the sitting area, Harry screwed up every ounce of Gryffindor courage he had. Instead of sitting across from Draco, he sat next to him on the sofa. Draco looked at him curiously for a moment but didn’t comment. “Er… So… There’s something I wanted to talk to you about.”
“No, of course not. Just answer the question, please? You were dead set against him coming with us before.”
Draco seemed to guess this; he walked up to Harry and looked him in the eyes, hesitating for a moment before putting his hand on Harry’s shoulder. “There is one thing I do know about wands, Harry; they choose the wizard, but they don’t define them. Regardless of what similarities your wand shares with Voldemort’s, it’s what you do with the wand that matters most. Power means nothing compared to what you do with it. So don’t think on it another moment, alright?”
"I'll talk as I work. It will help you focus on something besides the discomfort. As for what I'm going to do, it's fairly simple. I can't work any healing magic on it, nor would I if I could. I'm not trained for it. The bleeding has slowed down a fair bit since you've stopped touching it. I'll be able to clean it properly and apply the medicine to it. After which I just need to apply the gauze and wrap your hand. Alright?"
Emerald eyes scanned the scene, desperately searching for the platinum hair and stormy grey eyes of the boy he loved. Relief swept over him as their eyes met.
He stood in the doorway for several minutes, wondering where to start, when a spark in the corner of the room caught his eye.
“I want to send you back in time.”
Still, Draco made no attempt at escape but stood still and accepted his fate.
“HOW DARE YOU!” Umbridge shrieked, “DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?! I WILL NOT BE MADE A FOOL OF BY A PATHETIC, COWARDLY, SNIVELING CHILD! I WILL HAVE YOU-”
“Do you think I give a bloody fuck about points right now?! I know because he told me, and I had to practically drag it out of him! He was sick and distraught after your lesson!” Draco spat the last word with disgust.
His heart constricted.
With that, they began to make their way through Diagon Alley. Harry and Draco quickly decided to stick close behind Hagrid. It was much easier to navigate the crowded streets when everyone quickly moved aside as he passed. There wasn’t much conversation, as the street was now extremely crowded.
Draco gasped and exclaimed, “That’s brilliant!”
, he thought,
Sirius sighed and continued, "Anyway, there's no door at first. You have to walk past the empty wall where it should be, thinking of what you want the room to become. In your case, with the lies, the prophet has been spreading and the way you are often treated at school, I figured you could use a place where no one can find you. The room can give you a place to sleep, a place to relax, or a place to vent if you need to."
He sighed in frustration as he crashed into the chair in front of his desk. He really didn’t want to leave yet… but he was running out of options.  Before he went that far with it, however, he decided to write Hermione. He didn’t want to bother her while she was looking for her parents, but there was a chance she knew something he didn’t.
Draco’s last thought was that he was getting tired of falling unconscious; it was embarrassing and inconvenient.
Draco deflated slightly, having expected this reaction, and turned to walk away. He was surprised when Harry tugged on his robe to stop him and spoke in his defense, “Stop it, Hagrid; That’s rude. We talked in the store and he seems alright. I invited him to come shopping with us.”
Olivander chuckled, “I’m afraid it was my mistake. The Malfoy family has traditionally received wands made of Blackthorn, Hawthorn, and Yew. These wands tend to choose those who seek power. Their owners are often fearsome and notorious in their lifetimes. While not always the case, owners of these wands tend to practice the Dark Arts, as many in the Malfoy family have been known to do. I’m ashamed to admit that I allowed prejudice to overcome my judgment. I do apologize.”
“Because of my success at guiding wizardkind in life, I was given the responsibility of guiding them in death. Whether good or evil, I take each witch or wizard to their next destination. Think of me as a ferryman of sorts.”
With a small amount of hesitation, Harry nodded. Draco reached into his robe and pulled out a miniature pack. He enlarged the pack and explained that it was a medical kit. Harry looked surprised until Draco explained that every Slytherin carries one for emergencies. From the pack he pulled out a small silver bowl, a bottle of water with a permanent warming charm, an ointment to prevent infection, an ointment to ease pain, clean cloths, gauze, and a wrap. Most of the items were self-explanatory. Harry only asked for clarification on the ointments because they weren't labelled.
Hagrid looked away in embarrassment, “Er...yeah. Sorry about that Harry. I didn’t even think of it,” he mumbled. “But yeah...we can head over right now and so somethin’ about yer glasses.”
Harry dissolved into laughter once again, and Draco relaxed. He couldn’t find any malice in the other boys’ words. He had to admit that his parents would have been horrified at such an “unbecoming” use of language. He couldn’t help but smile a little as he watched Harry’s behaviour. He’d been petrified throughout the entire day, fearing rejection and worse. But for Harry to laugh so freely in front of him must mean something good. For the first time in a long time, Draco allowed himself to hope.
Harry and Draco spent three days worshiping each other. Such was their reverence, it was as if each was learning the others’ body for the first time.
“Since the beginning of the school year,” Harry answered quietly, “Over the summer… well… something happened, and Dumbledore decided I needed to learn.”  Meeting his eyes, Harry took a shuddering breath before continuing. “It’s terrible, Draco. Every week it feels like he’s ripping his way through my mind, tearing into my worst and most personal memories…” He trailed off.
Draco pulled away just long enough to slip the ring on Harry's finger before he burst into laughter, knocking his now fiancé into the ground, pressing soft kisses all over his face.
With a start, Draco realized he was running late to meet Harry and broke off at a run. When he made it to Madam Malkin’s, he saw with relief that Harry was just being led to the stool for his fitting. Draco steeled himself and made his way inside, still slightly out of breath.
It took him several long minutes, which he knew must have been agonizing to Draco. He could see the fear and doubt growing within the blonde, as Harry remained silent. Finally, he was just able to force out a whispered, “Yes”
“Already taken care of,” Draco smirked again, “I used a forgery spell to pen a note to McGonagall. She’ll be away on ministry business for the rest of the week. I wanted to give us a few extra days just in case, but I don’t think it will take that long to wear her down.”
Draco heard a sniff followed by a noise that he recognized as Dobby blowing his nose in his pillowcase again. He must really do something about that, Draco thought to himself as he grimaced.
"That bloody bint, Umbridge! She made me write lines with a blood quill!" He began to pace back and forth in his rage and frustration, "I must not tell lies! What a load of bollocks! I am so bloody sick of this! Every blasted year it's something! I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, I'm the Heir of Slytherin, I'm targeted by a traitor, I put my name in the Goblet of fire, and now I'm an insane liar who seeks attention! As if I wanted my parents murdered!" His voice began to crack, tears streaming down his face, but he continued as though he didn't notice or care that he was crying for the first time in years, "As if I wanted to be raised by people who think I'm worthless! As if I wanted to be targeted every year by a madman! As if I wanted to be the one who brought him back to life and watch Cedric get murdered! I didn't want any of this! I'm either a saint or evil, and
He’d been stabbed, after all, and there was really no other explanation for coming face-to-face with Merlin, which Draco also found strangely easy to accept. If nothing else, the massive waves of power emanating from the wizard would have convinced him.
Severus continued to study him for several moments before nodding his head. Draco sighed in relief as they rose from their respective seats and stood opposite one another.
“They’re beautiful,” Draco observed.
With that, Draco released the seal on the envelope.
“Dobby is being very careful, young master,” Dobby whispered dramatically, “Dobby will not be disappointing you.” Draco heard a small pop and assumed the elf was gone. He settled down on a nearby bench to read one of his magazines and wait for Dobby to return.
Quickly, Draco used the room’s magic to summon a cushion in the area where she would land.
Blood flowed in crimson waves; the guilty indistinguishable from the innocent, despite the madness that tainted their souls.
“Part of the job description,” Merlin said with a chuckle, “In order to help souls move on to their next destination, whatever it may be, I need to help them through whatever fear, pain, or grief they may be feeling. This place allows me to hear those thoughts, regardless of any magical defence. Rest assured, I would never abuse it.”
Draco moved to a nearby alley and called softly for Kreacher. When the elf appeared moments later, Draco was grateful to see that he was already looking much better; he still looked old and worn down, but at least he was clean and wearing a fresh pillowcase.
Trigger Warning! Vivid descriptions of violence and injuries as well as physical and emotional child abuse.
After a few moments, anticipation began to get the better of Harry. He had never been very patient as it was, but now he could hardly stand it. He wished Hagrid would move a little faster. Truthfully, Harry was restless enough that he would have run all the way there if it were an option. He could hardly believe he would finally be getting new glasses.
“Oh that,” Harry said, caught off guard by the subject change, “Well, you were the one who suggested the clothes and glasses. I figured you might have other ideas, and I want to explore this place.”
The pain threatened to overwhelm him, dragging him in and out of consciousness. He could only make out snatches of what his father said as he lay there crumpled on the floor.
“We will re-charm the glasses every year when you get an exam. That is unless you choose a new pair, which you are always free to do. If you have any problems or concerns, just send an owl or come on by. Does that sound good?”
He disappeared, preparing to wreak havoc.
But then a voice in his head reminded him of his own desires to escape: to stay in the Forest of Dean, to stay in the afterlife. He could have, but he hadn’t because there were things that were more important. As much as it hurt, this had been the case for his parents too, and he understood.
While Draco would have enjoyed the opportunity to spend more time with his mother, he was relieved that at least this time he knew his way around; last time had been frightening and overwhelming. After reflecting for a few moments, Draco decided it was probably better this way; he may need the ability to move about without the concern of maintaining appearances.
Harry mulls over the summer and his encounter with Draco.
Tom rose quickly to his feet, and Harry stared him down. His eyes seemed to glow fiercely as he spoke, "I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other."
“Draco, don’t,” Harry protested. “I have to learn occlumency. Besides, I can handle it.”
Draco looked at him in pure shock, “You… what?”
“I understand. Nightmares can feel so real. But I’m not going anywhere. I’m right here,” she said as she hugged him fiercely.  His mother had no idea it had been no nightmare. It had been his reality, and he was extremely determined that it would not happen again.
He’d been offered countless jobs with the Ministry and various other protection agencies, but he didn’t want to be accepted without finishing his education, otherwise, it would just be something else he was getting because of his name. Besides that, he’d had enough fighting. He didn’t know what to do with his life, but it certainly wasn’t that.
Draco nodded in understanding, turning his eyes back to Lyra, who was still staring intently as she hummed. His pain was almost completely gone by now, but he didn’t want to move until she stopped.
understand-”
Mentally shaking himself, Harry pushed all of the dark thoughts into the back of his mind, locking them away.
Draco brightened; he’d figured things were going fairly well, but he wasn’t expecting such an invitation. But Hagrid… “I don’t think he would want me around. My father and my family have a...reputation.”
Suddenly remembering the time, Draco asked,  “Would you please take me back to my room at Malfoy Manor, and then hear me out? If you don’t want to after I’ve explained, you won’t have to. Alright?” With a large sniff, Kreacher nodded. Draco moved forward, placing his hand gently on Kreacher’s head, and they apparated out.
“Okay,” he said to himself, “The seventh floor, left-hand corridor, ridiculous tapestry…..are those trolls wearing skirts?” He shuddered briefly, then faced the wall, as Harry had instructed and….
Harry saw things along the river banks that took his breath away and left him in awe.
After months of competition using up all my writing ability, followed by months of complications from ADHD, followed by a fall down the stairs, it's finally here, and I'm finally back, healed from my fall and ADHD being properly taken care of for the first time in my life.
However, something about her horrible taste in decorating allowed Draco to slip back into his “Malfoy” mask as though it were a worn glove. He stood straight and tall, his nose held almost imperceptibly in the air so that he was looking down on everyone and everything around him, and his mouth was curved into the haughty sneer that had become his trademark.
With that, she was gone. Draco turned to Harry who said brightly, “Well, let's be off then!”
Draco practically growled the next words. “Why. Did. You. Torture. Harry. With. Legilimency.”
From that night on, they wrote to each other constantly. Harry had decided to keep his new friendship with Draco a secret, though Draco had said he could tell anyone he trusted. Harry didn't want to take any chances or deal with any judgment. He told Ron and Hermione he had been listening to a muggle TV program one day when someone said that journaling was an excellent way to control your emotions. Ron had shrugged indifferently, and Hermione had praised him for his initiative. Neither questioned him after that.
Boxes of letters, journals, pictures, and things from his brief time with his parents covered the walls and floor of the vault. It had taken him hours to go through it all, as he had to stop constantly to keep from breaking down completely. The idea that his parents had been this prepared for their deaths was more painful than he would have thought.
“Um… Draco?” Harry called, not sure what to think of the current situation.
“I’m fine, Harry. What did you see in the Pensieve? Will you tell me?” He was furious about the way his godfather had behaved, but Harry’s focus had been on the memories, and Draco wanted to know why.
Umbridge flew across the room.
Harry observed Draco for the moment, wondering about his reaction. Based on what Harry had seen so far,  he wondered if Draco was not used to thanks, praise, or even basic kindness. Harry could definitely relate to that, and it would explain the difficulties Draco seemed to have when he was thanked or even smiled at.
Draco had known that he would have to see his father again eventually. He had thought he was prepared for it. But coming back from his trip with Harry, he had almost forgotten everything. For a moment, he had been a simple eleven-year-old boy again. The abuse of his past had faded, along with the circumstances of his death. Now, with just one sentence from the house elf, It all came flooding back: the pain as the knife twisted through him, the anger and grief and the betrayal, floating in the Nothing.
After everything they had gone through, they were together forever; mind, body, and soul.
“I know you are a good house-elf Kreacher, but if my father found out…” Draco paused, not sure how to explain, but Kreacher seemed to understand.
The toad remained silent.
Kreacher’s eyes widened. He seemed to forget himself, asking forcefully, “How is you knowing this?”
Magic exploded throughout the room.
Note: the next section will be dialogue only.
“Are you sure you want to do this?”
Draco spoke haltingly, stumbling over his words, “Your clothes...they’re baggy, worn, and covered with holes,” Draco confessed, “I just...well it seems that if Hagrid brought you here as a guardian of sorts...he should take you to get some new clothes. Even if it’s just jeans and t-shirts, you’d be a lot more comfortable…” Draco trailed off, seeming to brace himself for Harry’s reaction.
Frowning, Harry set the letter down and picked up the package. Turning it over in his hands, he realized it was a book. He was suspicious, but also curious. Hermione would probably skin him alive for this... He smiled at the thought and opened it.
See chapter 1! I own nothing!
This was a problem; he really didn’t want to be covered in writing, even if it was from his soulmate. Trying to think of another option, Harry brushed the word lightly with his fingers, eyes widening as it vanished.
"Oh... of course…" and then, to his extreme embarrassment, Draco Malfoy fainted.
Draco paused, calming himself. In the two years that they had spent growing from rivals to lovers, and the months since their relationship had become something more, Harry had never given him pause to doubt him. Arguments, pranks, and rivalry were still present in their relationship; it made their time together interesting and entertaining. Draco wouldn’t have had it any other way, and he trusted Harry with every fiber of his being.
"I don't support Voldemort. My father does. But I'll get to that in a minute. As to why I never said anything, by the time I realized the truth of the matter, we were firmly on different sides in the eyes of the world. I did as my father expected. As the enemy of the Dark Lord, you were to be hated. I was expected to torment you and best you in every way. Just as an example, my father bought my way onto the quidditch team just to pit me against you. It's the same way for nearly all of Slytherin. We are expected to hate you because of who we are."
Draco could have kissed his mother, he was so grateful. Although there was a spark of recognition in her eyes, the only reaction she gave was to reach out and grasp Harry’s hand, shaking it firmly. “Wonderful to meet you. I apologize for any negative impression you might have been given of my Draco. I assure you that the actions of others in the Malfoy family do not reflect on him.”
As he tried to clear his thoughts, Draco jumped lightly when he felt a warm tingle against his hand. When he opened his eyes, he was shocked and confused to see his hand covered in ink, despite a lack of quill or ink. He watched curiously as the ink seeped into his hand, as though it was a picture drawn on parchment instead of skin. He brushed his hand with his fingers lightly, an idea occurring to him as the ink disappeared at his touch.
“If I were to send you back, it would be much further.”
Feeling strangely calmed by Healer Edwards’ deep voice and easy manner, Harry nodded and relaxed back into the chair. Healer Edwards cast several spells on Harry’s eyes, making notes as he went along. Harry was immensely surprised when Healer Edwards moved on to his glasses after only ten minutes, casting several spells on them.
“Well, that’s never happened before,” said a voice from above him, sounding slightly amused.
“Why did you leave me alone with Draco?” Harry asked hurriedly.
"What happened?" Draco yelled in alarm.
As the light of the thread grew to a blinding degree, he felt the acceptance pulse through him with a flood of warmth, chasing away all of the emptiness he had been struggling against for so long.
“Yessir, thank you!” Harry exclaimed, unable to keep the smile from his face.
“They’re called Bougainvillea,” Harry answered quietly.
Harry nodded, “It was Sirius. He loved anyone in the family who would rebel from the traditions he hated so much. When he was trapped at Grimmauld place, he researched every disowned Black Family Member. Someone had kept a record of who had been disowned and why. Intrigued, Sirius snuck away and visited the village where Eduardus had lived. Eduardus had passed long ago, but he was able to meet his descendants. They had kept his records preserved and intact, along with the diary of Luciana. Sirius was given the records in the hope that their history would continue to be passed on in other areas of the world. He never got the chance though, and the records were sealed in the vault until I came upon them.”
He felt as though he'd been hit in the head by a bludger as he registered the meaning behind Draco's words.
Anyways, love to my readers, I hope you didn't get too impatient! And I would like to thank Sowen for her invaluable help with my research, my lovely Larks for their ideas and support, and my amazing writer PTlovesmore for all that she does!
Confused by the situation, Harry decided it was best to wait outside, although he made a mental note to go inside after Draco if he wasn’t back in ten minutes. The blonde was obviously angry, and Harry got the sense that provoking his temper was a bad idea.
Ancient gnarled trees covered the island in groves, creating a beautiful green tangle that he spent hours winding his way through. Being the only person on the island, he thought it would be quiet and perhaps even lonely, but the forest was alive with the sounds of wildlife. The twitters and songs of different birds, the humming of bees, the rustling of leaves, the fluttering of swarms of butterflies, and the endless sounds of life around him created a symphony of sound that was at once soothing and exciting.
Kreacher nodded, “So...Master Sirius is being...innocent?” He shook his head furiously when Draco nodded, “But...but this does not matter! Master Sirius abandoned my mistress! My mistress is dead and it is being his fault! Master Sirius broke her heart!” Kreacher burst into sobs, dropping to the floor. Draco knew all too well the pain of loss and felt a kinship with the elf he hadn’t expected.
The couple embraced, and then began their journey; to Costa Rica, the remainder of their holiday, and the beginning of a new life together.
Suddenly, he remembered what Sirius had told him when Harry had first confided in him."We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on...that's who we really are."
Harry shifted nervously in his seat and lowered his eyes to the floor, “A couple of years,” Harry mumbled, “but it’s no big deal. I still see alright, and my family just...hasn’t had the time.”
"Trail? What trail?" Harry asked, holding the note as though it would answer him. Suddenly, threads of colourful lights appeared, intertwining until they resembled a swirling rainbow, only with many more colours. Harry was enraptured as a breeze swept through the forest, causing the rainbow to bend and sway. Unable to help himself, Harry put his hand into the stream of light. Although the rainbow moved with his hand as it had with the wind, it refused to stray from wherever it was meant to lead him.
“Please excuse my administrator. I’m afraid Miss Ames gets rather caught up in her work and we’ve been rather busy these last few days. How can I…” he paused, examining Harry closer. Harry braced himself, preparing for more unearned gratitude. Harry was relieved when Healer Edwards commented, “What on earth have you been doing to these glasses? They are barely holding together.”
Harry sighed at him. “Come on Draco, it’s just a room, it won’t bite”
Saying nothing, Draco walked towards the wall and paced three times. When the door appeared, Draco faced Umbridge, delighting in the glazed look on her face. Without another word, he stepped inside, holding open the door.
In the end, Draco knew there was nothing he could say that would get him out of this. He wasn’t going to reveal anything to his father, so the only option he could see was to shake his head again, “No, Father.”
They stood together, their gazes locked.
“My cousin...broke them...a few times,” he mumbled, looking at the ground to avoid eye contact.
As soon as classes ended for the day, Harry caught Ron and Hermione in the corridor. “Hey, guys… Can we talk?”
Nodding, Harry followed Healer Edwards through the door into the connecting hallway, watching his long black curls sway as he walked. “Where are all the machines?” Harry asked as they entered the exam room, not quite knowing what to make of it. Healer Edwards chuckled good-naturedly, “I thought the same thing on my first visit here; I’m muggleborn as you may have guessed. We don’t need machines. We use magic.
“Come on Dray, it’ll be fun…..what a load of bollocks. Gallivanting through trees, weeds, rocks, and mud. Why in the name of Merlin did I let him talk me into this?” he grumbled. He was sure his hair was in a right state by this point. His clothes were rubbish as well.
Dobby was silent for several moments, seemingly dithering between protecting Draco and following orders, “Dobby is not liking the young master going in alone. But Kreacher is needing help. Dobby will go. But young master must promise Dobby he will call if he is being in trouble. And young master must be staying in the main room on the first floor. There is being nasty things in that house, and the young master is not having his wand.”
“Oh...right,” Draco faltered, looking away in evident discomfort, “No problem.”
Draco found himself speechless, something he did not often experience. Shaking himself slightly, he asked, “Why bring me here? I take it your little Gryffindor friends don’t know. So why me, of all people?”
I can't believe it took me two weeks to update! I'm sorry, there was a lot of research and editing that went into this one!
With those last few words, he completed the wrap on Harry's hand. He placed a mild sticking charm so the wrap would not come undone on its own and let go. He sat and watched as Harry gingerly moved his hand around, wincing slightly but looking extremely relieved nevertheless. After he finished his inspection, he met Draco's nervous gaze.
“Young Master would be in danger.”
The old elf nodded, “Yes. He is being a bad wizard, and a shame to the Family.”
His mother misunderstood the reason behind his reaction and said, “Don’t you worry, darling. If you need to cry in front of me, you cry. I know your father doesn’t approve, but I’m your mother, and I’m not going to shame you for a normal human emotion.”
Draco paused at the phrasing. “Serve me?”
"Fine, Harry. I'm not made of glass." He could hear the smirk in Draco's voice. "Take care of him and get me out of here, yeah?"
“And Fudge?” Harry asked.
Draco chanted to himself over and over.
Rage like Draco had never known was flowing through his veins. “Sit here and relax, Harry. I’ll be back.”
Was this their manifestation? It was the only plausible explanation he could think of. Only one way to find out… he dipped his quill in the ink and wrote one single word.
It was! They had accepted the bond!
Draco smiled against his ear, sending shivers down his spine, "They are called Lisianthus."
Narcissa turned towards Harry, a small smile playing on her lips. "You make sure he gets himself something special, alright?” she instructed in mock sternness, as though designating an important task. “Don’t let him worry about what his father might say.”
Draco hesitated, as though not trusting what Harry was saying, “Well… yes you did. But why aren’t you angry?”
“Are you saying that Voldemort was supposed to lose? But then… why didn’t he? And when you say rewrite destiny… is that possible?
Draco’s eyes widened as he finally understood.
“Well yeah,” Harry smiled, “but what could be nobler than doing something about that evil hag? Besides,” he paused, “you’re a Slytherin, and I’m sure you have a bigger plan than treating her like a cat toy, as funny as that was.”
Steeling himself, he nodded and allowed Harry to guide him through the forest.
A weight Draco hadn’t known was there disappeared, making him feel as though he could breathe easier. Still having some time before Madam Malkins, he decided to head to Olivander’s to get his wand.
Since the moment the snake was cursed into his arm, his world had been void of everything; sight, smell, sound, taste, and feeling, all dulled. What did it matter, when he was going to die anyway?
He spent the next several days exploring every inch of his body and mind, waiting for a dream, touching strangers to see if he felt a positive or negative of any kind… nothing. It was infuriating. The only thing that kept him sane was the knowledge that his soulmate, wherever they were, had accepted the bond and were likely doing the same thing.
Harry was silent for a moment, and then, “I’ve decided to give you a chance, Draco. You helped me when I needed it last night, and you said you wanted to be my friend. I believe you.”
He paused, opening the box and revealing a beautiful gold band with pearl and sapphire inlay woven together in small knots. "Will you marry me?"
Hermione shook her head and looked at Harry, “Will you come to dinner with us tonight, Harry?”
“Well,” Hagrid said carefully, thinking out loud, “Yer safe enough here… and I suppose we did get all yer school supplies, and yeh could use some clothes and such. I’m rather worn out, but you should be able to have some fun, this bein yer first visit and all…” Hagrid stopped to think it over for a moment, “Meet me at five o’clock. At the Leaky Cauldron. Alright?”
In the silence, Harry picked up on a faint roaring sound. When his breathing and heart rate was steady again, he got up and continued on. With each step the roaring grew louder, until the forest came to a halt, revealing a large and beautiful river. He walked over to the stone bridge that connected the two sides, preparing to cross. However, when his foot touched the stone, a note and a bottle of water appeared, landing gently on the ground.
All-consuming.
Bursting into joyous laughter, ran through the pine trails as fast as he could, only stopping when he couldn't continue any further. Dropping to his knees, he desperately tried to force air into his lungs. Sweat dripped from his face and his muscles were on fire, but he felt so alive and free that he couldn't bring himself to care.
After making Harry laugh uncontrollably for several minutes the dog jumped off his lap and on to the floor, transforming into his human form.
His smirk turned to a scowl of annoyance when the knocking sounded again, only this time it seemed as though someone was trying to break the door down. “For the love of Merlin,” he grumbled to himself as he rose from his chair and prepared to carry out his threat. Snape froze in surprise as the wards admitted entrance. There were only a handful of people who were keyed into his office wards.
Concern and worry were evident on Harry’s face as he whispered, “You did. Two months ago, in your sleep. I thought I’d misheard you at first, but you’ve been saying it every night since then. I’ve waited for you to say it to me knowingly, but you never did.”
When the time came to leave the oasis, they walked through the curtain of bougainvillea hand in hand.
“Excellent question, Mr. Malfoy,” he praised. “Cedar wands are known to match with those who possess great strength of character as well as loyalty. They are also known to be very protective of those they love, and quite fierce in that protectiveness. It’s not a wand you find often in the hands of a dark witch or wizard.”
As he locked eyes with Harry, Draco noted that shock and bewilderment were plastered all over the Gryffindor’s face. Of course, he’d known it would be a bit of a shock. It was a rather bold move, particularly for a Slytherin.
The biggest thanks go to my wonderful beta
to put it on the Marauders map, but the stupid thing just kept disappearing. It was the only glitch we ever had with the map."
The instant he picked it up, Harry felt as though he was yanked through the air at top speed. A moment later, he dropped to the ground. The hard landing knocked the wind right out of him, and he struggled to catch his breath for several minutes.
Harry thought.
“Back in... when? To before I died?” Confusion swirled in his mind. It was too much to handle. Even if he did go back to that day, the most he would be able to do was escape his own death. He wouldn’t be able to save anyone… Harry would still die, and Voldemort would still win. There would be no point.
J.K. Rowling and associates own these characters. This story is for fun and not profit.
They spent the rest of that day together uninterrupted; his father was away on business. They had lunch together, walked the grounds, and talked about everything. Draco couldn’t help but hug her several times and stayed as close to her as he could, reveling in every moment of it. With every embrace, smile, and laugh they shared, Draco reminded himself that he didn’t need to carry the weight of her death anymore; she was here, alive, and he was going to make sure she stayed that way.
There on the rug was Draco Malfoy, in cat form, batting around a rather large and ugly-looking toad.
“I’m sorry Dray,” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear, “I know this isn’t your kind of thing. I shouldn’t have laughed when you fell. You were just so adorable with that petulant look on your face, I couldn’t help it. If you want to go back, we can.” Harry paused, continuing in a sultry tone, “However,” kissing Draco’s ear lightly, “the destination I had in mind is just a bit further. If we keep going, I promise, it’ll be worth it.
When school started, they began meeting in the Room of Requirement.
After six months, I was finally able to update the story! In the process, I decided to go back and edit the chapters. Chapter one has been updated as of 10/5/2021, and hopefully, the rest will follow soon!
"There we go!" Sirius shouted. "You've got to stop hiding away up here. I know you're still angry, and you have every right to be. I don't like that they've been trying to keep things from you, or how Dumbledore has handled a lot of things over the years, but you've got me pup. I'm on your side, no matter what."
After several minutes, Olivander disappeared into one of the aisles and returned with the wand Draco recognized as his; hawthorn and unicorn hair. He was surprised when nothing happened as he gripped the wand in his hand. He didn’t have long to reflect on it though, as the wand was snatched from him and replaced with another. Twenty minutes and countless wands later, Draco was beginning to worry. He didn’t have long before he was supposed to be at Madam Malkins, and couldn’t figure out why his wand hadn’t worked.
Draco smiled at the use of the nickname. He’d hated the endearment at first, but now his heart sung with joy. Harry was going to marry him. Harry was his.
Something must have shown on his face, because her eyes grew wide with concern and she rose, “Are you alright?” she asked with worry coloring her tone.
"It's alright to feel angry, Harry. It was completely unfair to you. Your friends had their hearts in the right place, even if it doesn't seem like it right now. Take some time if you need to, but try to forgive them. Close friends are irreplaceable. Take it from me. " Sirius said.
Harry started to laugh through his tears. “Draco love, you’re gaping like a fish.”
And then... nothing.
Harry was captivated by the blond’s words and could see the depth of his sincerity in the silver eyes that were intently staring at him. After a moment, he swallowed and nodded.
Draco mentally cursed himself; he should have known there would be a price to pay for a chance like this. He motioned for Merlin to continue, bracing himself for anything.
Tears flowed freely from Draco’s eyes. Why had Harry brought him here? He struggled to free himself from Harry’s embrace, wanting to escape the feeling of despair.
McGonagall was so ecstatic that she began teaching the students Defense, as well as Transfiguration. Even the laziest students, Ron included, were scrambling to learn as much as they could before Umbridge returned.
When he finally reached the shore, Harry fell to the ground in exhaustion, staring at the beam. Nothing happened. It just ebbed and flowed, like a thread of pure light. He checked the wards… there was no sign of any intruder, which meant this would have had to come from miles away. Even then… an attack should have been warded off… So what was this?
"What is he up to?" he wondered aloud as he followed the note's instructions. Inside was a plain white box. When Harry opened it, he was surprised to see nothing more than a tree branch.
Harry didn't hesitate to throw himself on the ground in front of Draco and pull him into a searing kiss. "Yes," he said as he broke away before kissing him again. "Yes, yes, yes," he said, kissing him again each time.
Chuckling lightly, Draco said, “Alright, Kreacher. I promise.”
As Harry lay in bed that night, he found himself wide-awake. He was completely drained, mentally and physically, but sleep just wouldn't come. Thoughts of his conversation with Malfoy kept replaying in his head. He felt slightly guilty for putting Malfoy off instead of answering him. He knew the other boy would worry about it until their next meeting, but he had been thoroughly exhausted and he still needed to consider the potential consequences with a clear head.
“Well...alright,” Draco paused, “But be careful Kreacher, Dementors are nothing to mess around with. If anything goes wrong, come back at once.”
This day…traipsing through a forest, being bitten by bugs, tripping and humiliating himself…Draco was mortified. He turned away from Harry, his eyes downcast, and tried in vain to fix his clothes and hair.
become overconfident.”
After finishing his lecture, he paused to gauge Harry's reaction. He would have expected rage, and maybe accusations of lying after such a speech; there were none. Harry's face seemed frozen in shock. His eyes were wide and he had gone pale.
He sank to his knees, punching his fists into the ground as hard as he could with each breath he took, determined to suffer the pain.
Draco wakes up in a strange place once again.
Almost immediately, one pair captured Harry's attention. It was a silver simple wireframe pair with oval lenses shining as they caught the sunlight from the window. He picked them up and put them on, surprised when they magically adjusted to fit his face perfectly; that was handy, he thought to himself.
“What?” Harry asked, “What did I say?”
"What the devil are you playing at Malfoy?"
Draco paused to think. The most important thing he could do for Kreacher was to give him purpose again. It was something Granger had never been able to understand. She had been correct about the treatment of house-elves; Dobby had proven that.
When the man spotted the two boys in the doorway, he turned expectantly to the receptionist, shaking his head in bemusement when he saw the chaos that surrounded her. He approached Harry and Draco and introduced himself, “Hello boys, my name is Healer Edwards,”
“Alright, calm down,” Harry laughed, “You’re as mean, nasty, and ferocious as a dragon. There’s nothing adorable about you at all.” The cat huffed and returned to his task, evidently satisfied with Harry’s answer. Shaking his head again, Harry went to sit on the sofa. After a few minutes, the cat came and sat next to him. Unable to resist, Harry began gently stroking the soft fur, refusing to think about the fact that he was petting Draco Malfoy, even in cat form.
Olivander looked at him and smiled.
Remembering his promise to Dobby, Draco said carefully, “Oh..erm…not today Kreacher.” Draco paused when he saw Kreacher seem to deflate a bit. He found he truly wanted to help Kreacher, he just wasn’t sure how.
Silver eyes, identical and yet so unlike his own, eyes glowing with murder, and a voice dripping with hatred as he confirmed Draco's worst fears.
When they arrived at the designated wall on the seventh floor, Umbridge turned to him, her already large face swelling with rage, “Ahem. I do hope you have not deceived me, Mr. Malfoy. Such trickery would be very unwise on your part.
Despite the beauty, Harry couldn't help but feel irritated. Not only had Draco used a portkey to dump him in an unknown forest, but he hadn't even seen fit to show up!.
Harry grinned, stroking Draco’s hair, relieved that his boyfriend hadn’t fled. “No Draco,” he answered softly, “The Devas carried them to their families. The Devas can speak into the minds of humans, though they are invisible to the naked eye. They used this power to send images of what had befallen the lovers. Guilt and despair filled the hearts of the people, and it was determined by all that the war should end. Talks began, and soon enough peace was achieved. The lovers were buried together in a shrine that borders both lands.”
Draco nodded, remembering his annoyance at the sudden absence, followed by surprise when Harry returned and suggested they take a holiday together.
When they finally broke apart, shining silver eyes met blazing emerald green, and an understanding passed between them. There could have been fear, hesitancy, awkwardness, or doubt, but there was none—only passion and determination.
Draco reflected as he silently observed. He'd known for nearly a year now that he needed to approach Harry. There were apologies and explanations he needed to give. He'd tried since the start of term, but each time he was gripped by fear and fell back into the same old patterns of rivalry. Tonight was no different. Draco still couldn't face him, especially not now, while the Gryffindor was injured and cursing the world.
Once again Draco was nearly thrown into shock. This had been the last thing he expected. He knew Harry had no idea of who Draco really was, and had hoped beyond hope for a fresh start. It never occurred to him how little he actually knew about his long-time rival. At once he was gripped by fear. Although his father had never actually hurt him, Lucius Malfoy did not permit defiance and was certainly a dangerous man. Though he had never been on the brunt end of his father's rage, he had seen it enough times to be afraid of it. He also had no idea how the other Slytherins would react once word got out. He could be ostracized, disowned, possibly even hurt or killed. Could he risk all of that for a chance to be free? He knew if he remained silent he would be forced into servitude under that madman, and soon. He would no doubt be tortured regardless of any efforts he made. He would eventually be forced to hurt others, to kill. That thought decided for him, and he knew what he had to do.
how you feel. I was at least informed ahead of time, but knowing what the houses mean doesn't always prepare you. Some know exactly where they should or want to go, but I think most of us have no idea where we belong. I certainly don't."
“Would Young Malfoy care to look around the house?”
Incredibly humbled, Draco looked away and rose to his feet, wincing as he registered the pain in his hands.
Harry closed the magazine, tossing it aside on the couch, before he turned his body slightly to face Harvey. ''I wasn't,'' - okay, a lie, but it wasn't like he was actually interested in Malfoy's life, he just happened to come across it while flicking through the pages and told Harvey so, ''I was just looking through the magazine and it happened to feature an article on Draco,'' Harry finished with a small shrug.
“I mean, we breathe oxygen,” Right now, Harry wishes he didn’t, “because we are surrounded by air. But, by that logic, would fish breathe water, since they are completely surrounded by water?”
, Harry thinks, eyes closing in mortification.
Harry thrust his hips, guiding Malfoy’s head with the hand in his hair, softly hitting the back of Malfoy’s throat with his cock - revelling in the small moans and gagging sounds that left Malfoy’s mouth.
‘’I was wondering if you would like to go on a date with me,’’ Malfoy rushed out, Harry straining to pick the words apart.
Harry bit on the man's nipple, hearing him squeal, and stroked his hands down the lithe body beneath him. He leaned up, straddling agile hips, discarding his own shirt, before moving his hands down to work the man's jeans open. Harry leaned up to pull the jeans and underpants off the man's legs before quickly pulling his pants off. He leaned on his knees, sliding his hands up along hairy legs, pulling them up and apart slightly to settle himself in between them and bringing his head down.
Harry had come to discover several things about Draco in the time that they had been dating - he knows Draco like no one else does.
“I get off in an hour, how about a drink?” Draco asked, “You know, to keep an eye on you,” he finished softly.
The fluttering of the paper against his skin, snapped him from his thoughts. Draco traced his finger across the letters once more, before carefully folding the paper back into its original form. He turned and walked into the living room, eyes searching for Harry, but instead falling on another glowing piece of paper; this one taped to the couch.
“Fuck,” he breathed out.
Harry’s breath hitched, heart skipping in his chest. The look in Draco’s eyes was uncertain, a slight flush spreading across the highs of his cheeks - so light, Harry had to squint to see it.
He shook his head,
''Yes, we can try, we can fight,'' Harry brought out, his voice choked.
Harry looked back the club for a moment, before answering. ''I told her to stay, that I would take you back home.'' Harry stayed quiet, before reluctantly adding as an afterthought, ''unless you want Pansy to bring you.''
"If you have nothing else planned,’’ Harry started to ask in a slow voice, his head cocking to the side, "we could also have that date now?’’
Harry heard the door open and close and he closed his eyes, a tear escaping his left eye and he took in a shaky breath.
‘’Sorry,’’ Harry heard Malfoy apologize, his eyes still on the hand hovering questioningly above his, ‘’didn’t mean to scare you. Just, I thought, -’’ Malfoy stuttered, ‘’maybe I could hold your hand?’’
Silence overtook them once more, and Harry was considering to make a flimsy excuse to dodge the awkwardness - and the racing heart he had been experiencing since Malfoy came to stand with him, which was really just nervousness and awkwardness, right? - when Malfoy started talking again, stepping closer and putting a warm hand on his arm.
Harry sat on the couch, head shaking slightly as he denied it, still, - unconvincingly, because he knows Harvey has a point somewhere. He knows he never actually put his relationship - or as far as it could be called one - with Draco behind him, he never let go of it. Whatever it was, whatever they had, it was something - to Harry, at least.
Finally, Draco stepped back and Harry let out a breath, calming his heart and reducing the slight dizziness that had developed in his head.
''Let's Apparate you home, yeah,'' Harry said quickly, putting his arm around Draco's waist more tightly to Side-Apparate him alongside Harry.
Draco's eyes lit up, a smile growing on his face and he surged forward to hug Harry, face coming to rest in the crook of Harry's neck. Harry fell into Draco's arms, as easily as the first time, and sighed happily.
Draco waved his wand once more, in the general direction of Harry’s chest, and a number appeared next to Harry’s body.
Malfoy came to stand next to him, waved for a drink, then turned his body toward Harry.
, Harry chastised himself.
Malfoy snorted next to him, ‘’Thank you, I appreciate that, but for the record, I think you’re hot as well.’’
Harry pulled away from Draco’s lips, placing feather light kisses down Draco’s neck, pausing to suck a mark on Draco’s pulse point and the hand in his hair tightened, making Harry groan.
The door clicks open and Harry snaps his head up to see,
“Potter.” Harry stopped, looking over his shoulders to see Draco at his desk, rifling through pieces of parchment with a smile on his face. Draco let his eyes flit up to meet his.
Harry nodded tersely, but also slightly pleased in the back of his mind that his crush knew his name, and Malfoy smiled, nodding back, ‘’Draco Malfoy.’’
Currently, he found himself on top of some guy - Ryley? Or was it Ryan? He doesn't quite remember - as they made out, hands roaming and exploring each other's bodies. Harry slid his hands under the shirt, nudging it up until the man underneath him leaned up for Harry to slide the shirt off, and Harry dropped his head to the dark nipples, enclosing his mouth around it.
. And now,
Harry jogged to catch up slightly with Draco, stopping right in front of him as nerves filled his body.
''I can't be with somebody who is still in love with someone else, Harry, I'm sorry,'' Harvey said, and Harry's heart clenched slightly. Harvey stood still for a few moments, before he turned slightly, ''If - at some point - you feel like you can move on, you know where to find me,'' Harvey finished softly, before he turned and walked away.
‘’Draco, the past five years we have been together, have quite possibly been the five best ones in my life,’’ Harry began, voice trembling with nerves, ‘’and although we have had our past and have never quite seen eye to eye, I was never really surprised at the realization that it was you for me; that it had always been you for me, from Hogwarts to now. Because you are, and always have been, my light in a life full of darkness. Because my eyes always look for you, even when you are not around me. Because my mind is always stuck on thoughts of you. But, most importantly, because I am, always have been, and always will be irrevocably in love with you. Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you do me the honor and absolute joy of becoming your husband?’’
Harry mentally reassured himself,
“Look at you, taking me so well, Malfoy. You like it, don’t you?” Malfoy inhaled sharply through his nose, eyes closing and opening again, darkening as he nodded slightly, carefully around Harry’s cock, and Harry groaned softly. “Such a cock slut, aren’t you? If I had known this would be the way to shut you up, I’d have done this much sooner.”
''I am glad to see you are doing okay,'' and Harry's head snapped up, confusion clouding his mind, ''after what happened between us,'' Malfoy clarified softly and Harry froze, letting his eyes drop to where Malfoy's hand was resting on his arm, heat burning through the material of his dress robes, before flicking his eyes back up to Malfoy - noticing that all of a sudden they were standing right in front of each other, and Harry inhaled sharply, heart skipping.
''How's the Healer career treating you?'' Harry asked, as he kept his eyes firmly on the glass in his hand.
, Harry thought as the cart began to move. Harry chanced a quick glance at the ground, and immediately regretted it as a soft whimper escaped his lips and his chest tightened. They weren’t even that high off the ground yet, and Harry felt a wave of nausea go through his body as he watched the cart getting lifted higher and higher from the ground.
''I love you,'' Harry whispered into the silence, bending down to place a kiss on top of Draco's head, before he walked back downstairs, Apparating himself to his home with a smile on his face.
An arm around his waist pulled his gaze away from the picture and the article, and Harry looked up to see Harvey looking at him, blue eyes flicking to the pages Harry had laying open on his lap. The arm around his waist tightened, and Harry briefly closed his eyes - praying that this isn't going to go where he highly suspects where it is going.
Malfoy pulled back, placing kisses down his neck, sucking on his pulse point and Harry groaned, dropping his head back as he pushed his hips into Malfoy’s.
Maybe, just maybe, they could finally settle their differences, Harry thought.
They still needed to work out a lot of things together, needed to build up their trust again, all amongst other things - so, they might not be completely okay yet, but at least it was a start. A good start, Harry thought.
The sound of someone clearing his throat next to him, set off another stream of thoughts in his mind.
After a few seconds, Malfoy relaxed into a sitting position, leaning his head forward against Harry’s chest. Malfoy waved a hand around lazily to cast a charm to clean himself. Their panting was the only sound in the room, as they tried to come down from their climaxes.
‘’So, -’’ Malfoy spoke at the same time that Harry opened his mouth to start saying, ‘’Tha-’’.
The right side - the main article - showed a head title in black letters (''Draco Malfoy: The biggest, contemporary Healer'') and Harry skimmed through the first few sentences of the articles, where Malfoy's past as a Death Eater has been highlighted severely, before Skeeter moves on to Malfoy's current career as a Healer - displaying him as one of the best, and Harry can't help but feel a rush of pride swell inside of him at the words.
Harry looked at Malfoy, eyes flicking between Malfoy’s, why
Draco pulled away first, resting his forehead against Harry's, their breaths mingling as they panted softly. Draco's hands rested on the back of Harry's neck, fingers running through the hair at the nape of his neck and - although Harry hated himself for falling back into Draco's arms this easily, this fast - Harry shivered at the touch.
And Harry loves it - loves that Draco is so comfortable with him to let the actual, real him out in front of Harry, loves that he lets his walls down,
To and for Harry, within their home, Draco is different. It isn’t that Draco isn’t elegant or witty and everything else he is outside of their home, because he definitely is. It’s that he’s so much more
''You don't look so bad yourself, Potter,'' Malfoy answered, and Harry felt his heart skip -
When he opened them again, he saw Malfoy walking over to him and Harry's heart went in overdrive, hands getting clammy and mouth dry.
''You still have feelings for him,'' Harvey said. It wasn't a question, it was a statement.
, Harry thought.
Draco didn't notice, continuing his speech. ''He's also really grown muscles, you know, like he is
‘’Your name?’’ Malfoy asked uncertainly, seemingly doubting himself, when Harry didn’t answer the question.
Harry moaned, bucking his own hips, and brought his arms up to encircle them around Malfoy’s neck to pull him closer.
‘’You’re welcome,’’ Malfoy answered with a shy smile, before he cocked his head in question, ‘’actually, I was wondering…’’
Malfoy and him were standing on the opposite sides of the bathroom, glares on both their faces. Harry had followed Malfoy in here, found him crying as he stood bend over the sink in the bathroom. Malfoy’s eyes had widened, staring at him as Harry had walked in - frozen in the doorway - and Harry had seen his body shaking. But in a split second, Malfoy had pulled himself together, and looked at Harry with a cold glare. Which brings him to what they are doing now - staring each other down.
Harry shook his head, that fight had been last one of the many they had had before, and also one of their worst. Malfoy had been right - they did not work together, they were too different. But, then again, hadn't they been similar in the way that they had both been children in the war, who had never asked to be in the position that they had been thrown in? Hadn't they left behind their rivalry, hadn't they had something special, something worth fighting for?
,'' Malfoy spat, before he turned and stalked off, leaving Harry standing at the bar, his heart shattering to pieces - all over again.
?’’ Harry blurted out, and winced at the fact that he had just spoken that thought aloud.
Harry’s eyes widened,
Harry closed his eyes tightly, an effort to ground himself.
He tried to push away the fact the Draco was literally standing in front of him, his breath and warmth enveloping Harry.
Harry’s face flushed, as did Malfoy’s - or, Draco's.
Draco gathered his hair up into a low ponytail - Harry briefly wondered if the hair felt as soft as it looked, the urge to run his fingers through it growing immensely as he watched Draco neatly tie his hair back.
Draco shook his head and Harry smiled, standing up and holding his hand out for Draco. Draco stood, swaying slightly, but Harry steadied him with hands on Draco's waist and he turned them, one arm still around Draco as he walked them to a point, where they could safely Apparate.
Despite the fact that his mind was purely focusing on the fact that they were
He looked up at Draco, who was looking at him with a slight glitter in his eyes.
The tip of Malfoy’s tongue traced his lip and Harry opened his mouth willingly, moaning as Malfoy’s tongue slipped inside, exploring his mouth.
Harry stared blankly at where Malfoy’s fingers were now softly, barely, brushing the top of his hand, and Malfoy rushed to explain himself.
''Don't try denying it, you know it's true. Everytime I say something remotely negative about Draco when we come across a topic that features him, you get all defensive on him or you close yourself off from me. Everytime we encounter something that is Malfoy-related, you get this look on your face - like just now with the article. And that's not all of it, there are several more signs, Harry.''
Harry nodded again, before softly whispering an, ‘’I know.’’
“So, if we consider ourselves dry, do fish consider themselves dry surrounded by water? And if they do, do they think of themselves as wet when they come in touch with air? Or, do you think they - “
Harry heard Draco hum, and he breathed deeply to calm himself, when he heard Draco speak and his heart jumped again.
He stood from the bed, gathering his jacket that he’d thrown over the chair next to it.
‘’Hey, you okay?’’
He thanked Draco, quickly turning afterwards to walk out of the office as fast as he could.
''What do you want, Malfoy?'' Harry saw Malfoy flinch a bit, before he seemed to recollect himself.
Harry nodded, wiping his hands on his trousers, as Draco came to stand before him.
The cart was still making its way down, moving along with the soft breeze of the wind and Harry took a deep breath, his fingers tightening ever so slightly both around Malfoy’s hand and the side of the cart.
Harry pressed a small kiss on top of Malfoy’s head and circled his arms around the lithe body to pull the boy closer to his own body, holding him tightly, as Malfoy nuzzled his head into his chest.
, yes, what else did you expect me to say? Of course, I will marry you, Harry,’’ Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, leaning back to lock their lips together.
After a few seconds Harry was the one to break the silence, shortly asking, ‘’You?’’
Still muttering to himself, Draco turned to hang his keys on the hook next to the door. He froze as his gaze fell onto a fluttering, glowing piece of paper, taped to the back of the door. Draco frowned, his right hand resting on his wand in his back pocket as his left hand reached out to peel the paper from the door.
That's how Harry found himself, months later, on the same couch in his living room with his new boyfriend, Harvey. Harvey was a wizard - a halfblood -, slightly taller than him, slightly tanned with blond-brown hair and blue eyes.
Malfoy stayed quiet for a few seconds, and Harry felt the guy eyeing him, before he spoke up again.
''I just wanted to - talk,'' Malfoy finished lamely, hands wringing.
At once, relief flooded Harry’s veins and he made quick work to hastily shove not only himself, but also Draco, out of the cart.
Draco pulled back, resting his head against Harry’s, his eyes locked on where Harry was putting the ring around his finger. Harry’s fingers traced the edge of the ring, before he turned his head to look at Draco again.
‘’So,’’ Malfoy dragged out, ‘’Harry Potter, right?’’
to you,'' Harry said, eyes tearing slightly and he blinked, wishing for them to go away, ''But, probably worst of all, I am sorry that I am still so in love with you that I am fucking up all of my relationships, letting you cloud my mind and my thoughts. That I am still so in love with you that I would do anything to get you back, that I would still fight for you, even though I know you don't - and probably never will - love me as much as I have loved you, as I still do.''
''I'm sorry about that,'' Malfoy said, and Harry shrugged before answering, ''I like teaching, working with the kids.''
Harry groaned internally. It would be so effective, just pulling the pillow from under his head to smack it right in the middle of Draco’s face.  Though, Harry highly doubted it would shut Draco up. He’d probably just be astonished, stunned, but continue his rant a few minutes later about…
Malfoy obediently opened his mouth, moaning as Harry slid into his mouth, and he hollowed his cheeks as he slid back up.
''Potter,'' Malfoy said, and Harry looked sideways at Malfoy, nodding his head in acknowledgement, ''Malfoy.''
Harry lifted his hand to grab onto Draco's hand, that had been resting underneath Harry's chin, and he laced their fingers together. He squeezed the hand, looking up at Draco again, before he nodded slightly.
Draco Malfoy, as you might want to know, was the hottest (albeit, most arrogant) guy at school, and Harry had been hopelessly crushing on the guy for months (okay, years, sue him).
than he is Malfoy, within their home.Draco is messy - granted, not as much as Harry - he is clumsy, and he talks
‘’- can’t believe the lot of them. Not that I expect a huge acknowledgement from them, but not even a small happy birthday. From
‘’I do know some ways in which you can make it up to me,’’ Draco whispered, and Harry’s eyes darkened at the words. The arms around Draco’s pulled him closer, and Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck, lips brushing against the junction between his collarbone and neck.
Draco bit his lip to fight the smile and blush from forming on his face as he remembered, and he quickly folded the paper and made his way into the adjoining bathroom. On the mirror, a piece of paper was fluttering, calling out to him. Draco reached for it.
His muscles relaxed and he pulled Malfoy’s mouth of him, letting go of Malfoy’s hair, as he let himself drop on the cold tiles - spent.
‘’Harry?’’ Draco questioned, but Harry shushed him, before kneeling down onto one knee. Draco’s breath hitched, his eyes widening, as the words from the last piece of parchment he’d found, repeated themselves in his mind. The place where you will hopefully say yes.
But, right now, Harry was pushing all of that to the back of his mind. All he could think about at this moment, was the fact that he was getting more and more exasperated, more annoyed and was this close to smacking the blond in the face, if only to shut him up for one minute.
Draco cautiously unfolded the paper, eyes tracing the words scribbled neatly on the paper.
‘’No, no, I mean yes, I mean, - ’’ Harry rushed out, before laughing nervously and taking a deep breath to start over, ‘’what I mean to say, is I would love to go on a date with you.’’
, Harry felt himself flush.
‘’Great, great.’’ Draco nodded, before pursing his lips awkwardly.
Another look outside the cart told him that they were the next cart to get to the top, and Harry felt a small rush of relief, before it vanished just as quickly as it had come as the cart rumbled, creaking loudly only to come to a stop at the top.
be cursed.
''Do I?'' Harry asked, struggling a bit to keep a giggling Draco upright. His eye fell on an alley - seemingly empty, perfect place to Apparate, Harry thought - a bit further away and he steered them both into that direction.
Harry pulled out a dark green, velvet box from behind him and opened it. A simple, silver band was nestled inside. Draco’s eyes blurred with tears, and he blinked, sniffing. Harry was looking at him, nervous and waiting, and Draco gasped as he remembered he was supposed to
Draco nodded, humming affirmatively, ''Harry also has that messy, just-out-of-bed look going on with his hair,'' Draco said with a vague wave of his hand, and Harry snorted a bit, turning them around the corner into the alley - which was indeed empty and abandoned, ''It's quite a hot look,'' Draco continued to say and Harry froze.
''I really am sorry, Harry. I know I have hurt you, several times, and you didn't deserve that, especially not you. I will spend my life making it up to you, but for now, can we start trying this again? Can we fight for this, for us?'' Draco's voice was soft, vulnerable and Harry searched Draco's eyes and face.
It was way past 2 A.M., all Harry wanted to do was sleep, but Draco seemed to be full of energy - breaking the silence they were in with a new question every so often.
They both chuckled softly, before Malfoy gestured for Harry to go first.
Harry flicked the pages, snorting occasionally, before he stopped on a page with an article about Malfoy. A picture of Malfoy in a dark blue, muggle suit adorned the whole of the left page. Malfoy was holding the jacket, slung over his shoulder, while looking into the camera with a smouldering look. Malfoy's name was written in fancy letters underneath the picture.
Harry raised an eyebrow, and Malfoy’s lips quirked up.
“Shutting you up, apparently,” Harry said, before he dropped his head, mouth enclosing around a pink nub, Draco whining softly and Harry felt as the hand in his hair pushed his head closer to Draco’s chest.
''You know,'' Draco spoke, and Harry hummed inquisitively, ''you look very much like - like Potter, like Harry.'' Draco giggled and Harry smiled, heart skipping at the mention of his first name. Even as they had been paired at the Aurors, Draco had not lost the habit of calling Harry by his last name. Draco had only ever called him Potter, with just two exceptions (on Harry's birthday and when Harry had been hit by a curse during a chase).
A muffled groan made him look back up at Malfoy, and his cock twitched slightly at the sight before him.
The cart shuddered, beginning its descend, and Harry squealed, his hands tightening on the rails along the cart once more. A touch against his hand, the one clenched next to him, made him jump and the cart wiggled again, making Harry inhale sharply before he drew his gaze to where pale, long fingers hesitatingly hovered above his hand.
, Harry was so done. He loved Draco, but he was so done, utterly done. He didn’t need to know about fish, didn’t want to know about fish. All he needed and wanted, was for Draco to
As he let his eyes trace the letters once more with a small smile on his face, the memory fading to the edges of his mind, his eye fell on a small arrow in the bottom corner of the parchment and Draco raised his eyebrow, before turning the paper around.
Pale hands came up to swiftly unbutton his jeans, pulling them down along with his pants and Harry hissed as his cock sprung up, the cold air hitting his skin.
Harry had tried turning his back to Draco, had tried putting a Silencing Charm on Draco (only for Draco to slap him on the arm repeatedly, until Harry conceded and took it off), had even tried to slap his hand over Draco’s mouth (only for Draco to lick his palm, and Harry to pull it away with a frown). Lastly, he had tried to put a pillow over his head - Muggle style, briefly thinking that it might even take mercy on him and suffocate him. But, alas, nothing had happened, nor had anything helped.
Harry nodded,
His eyes finally fell on top of a hunched figure sitting on a bench to the left, long and blond hair falling down the back. Harry walked over, sitting himself down next to Draco - softly, as not to startle him.
Draco folded the paper and cleared his throat against the rush of emotions that flooded through him, walking out of the kitchen to make his way into the bedroom - still in search of Harry. On the bed, another piece of paper was waiting for him, and Draco picked it up.
Harry chuckled shakily, shock still running through his veins from Draco's admission. He brought his hands up to take Draco's into his, squeezing softly, ''I won't tell him, if you promise something in return,'' he said. Draco nodded fervently, eyes wide and Harry smiled, feeling his chest warm.
Malfoy took a step back, putting distance between them, and Harry had to keep himself from stepping forward to follow him. Harry wanted to reach out, speak out, stop Malfoy from running - once more. His heart had been broken by Malfoy, but he had put that aside him, he had healed from that fight. They had both healed from everything, hadn't they? They had grown, matured, settled, so
Harry sat in his living room, a book opened on his lap, but not quite reading. His mind was still stuck on Malfoy - even though weeks had passed since their run-in at the Ministry function, after which they hadn't seen each other again.
Harry hesitatingly reached out to brush his hand against Draco’s again, this time linking his index finger with Draco’s pinkie.
Harry walked through some corridors, before he finally reached the bathroom and he slipped inside, standing in front of the mirror while he rested his hands on the sink. Harry breathed in - deeply - before he slowly breathed out again, repeating the process a few times, before he felt his heart rate go back to normal and he opened his eyes, looking up. His gaze caught Malfoy's, who had - apparently - come in as well and was staring at him through the mirror.
Harry gasped softly at the words, his heart stuttering in his chest.
Harry stood at the bar, a glass of Firewhisky in his hand, as he looked around the room - surveying as people were chatting, laughing and dancing cheerily. It had been ten years since the end of the War and the Ministry had decided to hold a special function, Harry being the first one to get invited. And, although Harry had really not wanted to be there, he was obligated to, which is how he found himself standing at the function.
Harry clenched his hands into fists, ground his teeth, “Suck my dick, Malfoy,” he spat and
Harry surveyed the scene they found themselves in, the situation from Sixth Year flashing through his mind, when he had found Malfoy crying in the bathroom and it had escalated badly between the two of them. He removed his hands from the sink, running one through his hair, before he turned slowly. He looked at Malfoy, before he sighed and made move to walk past Malfoy and through the door to go home.
‘’Can wait,’’ Draco gasped, before stepping out of the embrace and desperately pulling Harry towards the ladder to take them back to their room, Harry’s soft laughter reverberating around them.
Harry rubbed a hand down his face. Maybe it was time to move on, let go - replaying what had happened in the past would do nothing for him. As Dumbledore had told him,
Draco waved the wand and Harry watched as the data appeared next to him, Draco’s grey eyes - looking lighter and even more beautiful than they they had been, months ago - flicking from side to side as he read the words and numbers, taking in the lights that appeared as well.
,” Harry said, grinding his hips up toward Malfoy's face to make his point.
Draco stared at him for a few moments, ''Where's Pansy?'' he finally asked.
“So, if all animals could talk and we could hear all of them, which do you think would be the rudest?” Draco whispered softly, tiredly against Harry’s neck, where he’d burrowed his face.
Harry pulls out, breathing heavily and he threw an arm over his eyes.
Malfoy hummed distractedly, before he said, ‘’Oh! What I am doing here? Good question.’’
Malfoy laughed coldly, “Thought so, Potter. Why don’t you go back to your little friends, yeah? Those Gryffindors, go kiss their asses, Golden Boy.”
“Potter, good to see you again. How about we get you checked up, yes?”
Draco nodded, turning back to his parchments, but not before Harry could see his smile growing.
Harry thought back to the last fight they had had, when they had still been involved with each other. Malfoy had screamed out similar words at Harry, before the man had walked out of the door, and out of Harry's life for good.
Draco pulled at Harry’s hand, urging the man to stand up, flinging himself at Harry the moment he was standing.
Malfoy moaned loudly around Harry’s cock and Harry’s hips stuttered at the vibration. He thrust his hips deeply, a mantra of “fuck, fuck, fuck,” leaving his mouth as heat coiled in his stomach.
“What are you doing?” Draco breathed.
,’’ Draco growled out softly. Deep down, Draco knew that the fact, in general, that no one had wished him on his birthday did not bother him. No, deep down, Draco knew what had in fact angered him, was that his boyfriend had not wished him
. The cart wiggled and Harry squeezed his eyes together, before taking in a deep breath, his heart thundering in his chest.
Harry’s eyes widened, ‘’You wanted to talk to
The first thought that flashed through his mind as Harry settled himself nervously into the seat of the ferris wheel, was that
Draco's stare grew morose, head shaking from side to side, ''But, what if he doesn't feel the same about me? He can't feel the same about me, he must still hate, or at least dislike me,'' Draco said, and Harry felt his heart break. Had he really let Draco feel as if he still didn't like him?
''It's great, how is your Auror force?''
Apparently not, no.
date?
A hand on his arm pulled him around, and not a second later warm lips found his and Harry gasped in surprise, his arms finding an almost familiar - but, slightly more defined - waist. His fingers dug into the material of Draco's dress robes, as Harry clung to him desperately, their lips moving together in a teeth clashing kiss, before it softened slightly.
Harry sat on the bed that was placed in the middle of the examination room, looking around at the posters adorning the walls as he waited for the Healer.
Harry began shaking his head, denying it, when Harvey spoke up again.
Once more, he glanced to the ground below and saw that they were almost at the top of the ferris wheel and he sighed with a slight quiver.
Draco gasped as well - as if just noticing what he'd said, and that he wasn't alone in the room - and Harry snapped his eyes to look at Draco, alarmed, who was looking back at him - just as alarmed, ''You can't tell him, he can't ever know,'' Draco rushed out, as he stood unsteadily and Harry rushed forward to catch Draco, pale hands coming up to rest on Harry's cheeks as Draco forced his head to face him, ''You need to promise me, don't tell him.''
Harry slid off Draco, panting, and gathered Draco in his arms. He felt Draco lean his head against his chest and he rested his head atop Draco’s, eyes closing contentedly and tiredly.
am sorry, Draco. I am sorry that we didn't work out before, that you didn't want to fight for what we had, that you just up and left and discarded me to the side like I was just - some toy for you. Like I meant
''Draco,'’ Harry called softly, and he watched as Draco raised his head to look at him. Harry smiled at Draco, his eyes tracing over Draco's figure. He noticed the slight shivering and he took off his jacket placing it over Draco's shoulders, fingers brushing against cold arms.
‘’Hi,’’ Harry greeted, stepping closer to Draco to link their hands together. Draco leaned up to place a small kiss onto Harry’s lips, ‘’Hi,’’ he whispered back.
, Harry thought, actually feeling like he would cry like Malfoy mentioned mere seconds ago,
Harry took a deep breath, counting up to 3 and back, before he nodded just so slightly to assure that
‘’Well, I actually saw you get onto the ride on your own and took a chance,’’ Malfoy answered slowly, and Harry glanced at him with a raised eyebrow,
,'' Draco mumbled through giggles, Harry cleared his throat as his cheeks warmed a bit. ''Just imagine running your hands across those abs,'' Draco nearly moaned and Harry yelped, cutting Draco off, not wanting Draco to continue as Harry isn't sure what he'd do if Draco did, and he didn't want to do anything with Draco being this drunk.
