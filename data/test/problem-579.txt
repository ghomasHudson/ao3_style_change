Another figure just lying in pain while glance a little, and in end giving with no answer to report to toward the dark figure Infront of him that is known as ‚Äòdark lord or the name that should not be name ‚ÄòVoldemort‚Äô.
‚ÄòAHHHHH! Where who what? The heck pansy you- ‚Äòdraco glare toward the figure infront of him who had a grin appear on her face like a mask is already attach on it.
I had this sudden awoken or did i- ‚Äòoh merlin beard! The book yess! the book had the answer!‚Äô Draco said as he sees the book lay on top of the small table top.
Slowly harry breath, 'well yeah i went that section..but what it had to do that happen with ron?'
‚Äòfo-forgive me fo-for this m-matter I I h-had a news for m-master‚Äô a female feels her body getting heavier as the man slowly to calm down.
(2): THERE ARE SOME DARK PART BUT SHORT. Don‚Äôt worry~
End of the triple story were not success but will try another triple..
I jarred into consciousness in the warm silence I never expected to feel, with the acute awareness that I was alone in this beautiful room. Which kind of similarity Deja vu vibe feels on it.
Hermione and harry examine ron face which still look fresh bruise. While draco still curious why ron attitude change from 180 degree to 360 degree form of people.
Ron face look groan for the broom that seem rolling over than going up, 'Up! U-' the broom end up too fast, which smacking ron face.
With no need to look back, Hermione coldly went back to the Gryffindor room.
Stubbling opening his last pajamas, ready to stand still as he turn the water above him-
Zzzz...
‚Äòlet‚Äôs make a plan first then we move for the hunt brother!‚Äô
.....
But. Why harry here met with me. In my day here, i suppose to meet the clumsy neville. Not harry potter. I feel i change a history time line here. He wonder in alert as more pale cover his face again.
Just what the heck is going. He wonders with many questions in his thought and wait for the book to says something but instead, he heard was a sound of silent from the mystery book.
‚Äòare you sure this is the right book, mione?!‚Äô the male voice, name draco that seem had the look of doubting about the book called ‚Äòdesire‚Äô.
He hesitated. ‚ÄòThat doesn‚Äôt.‚Äô
The words keep repeat till they arrive to the sofa, harry slowly put draco on the sofa as he sit on floor holding draco's left hand. Fear draco will be disappear.
Well hello readers..got quite busy with assignment made me stress out
‚Äòwakey wakey little padma~‚Äô the male figure stares the girl laying naked with no clothes to cover her, as he devours her beautifully again and again.
"-last or first fleux-'
A wand ready on his hand as-
Very deja vu moment. He thought in flashed memory playing on his mind.
‚ÄòI‚Äôm coming~ I‚Äôm coming- ‚Äòthe older brother trying to catch up his little brother that already fast on his feet.
Harry was hanging and the broom were acting weird, while he was trying to seek the seeker's ball.
‚Äòguys..listen to this passage, it says that if somebody or a person made a contract to do the virgin person, will be the second complete after the first stage that already been done, which is the sacrifice of person who had the red hair heritage-‚Äò
Neville fall hard to the ground.
Gosh that theo. He groan as he begin again his search for the weird pain he having.
Draco heart seem faster to heard that rough tone he never expect to heard from eleven years old boy, harry.
'ahh' neville scream in pain, 'looks like it broken bone here, better need you hurry in hospital now. And Students! the class is still on and stay here after i sent mr neville' madam rolanda carry neville in speed ahead to the hospital wing.
In the morning of class, all students of slytherin and griffidor were having a broom class session.
He look back to the person who still in stand mode, slowly he near the person 'pansy..thats enough, lets just go to potion class. My godfather is not really kind if we're late'
'ouh draco' harry accidently spoke the malfoy name made hermione beside him smile and ron shaking his head for harry behavior stalk toward the malfoy, draco.
Lets roll~
'come..' the voice pursue again.
‚Äòyeah yeah I know, curse me to dead spell bla.. bla.. but that‚Äôs so lame draky.. and I really need your help‚Äô pansy had her eyes in weird twinkle, making draco want to go back to his fluffy pillow.
With that, silence once again in the young draco room.
Meanwhile in the other side‚Ä¶
The crowd were viral fuses that seem unstop as the both team, griffidors and slytherin are in their position.
'hmmmm' he hummed as he read once again the passage carefully. Hoping he may had the answer that he had miss out.
Theo was our bestfriend. But after the fight between theo and pansy. The friend bound take him to choose side.
I wonder‚Ä¶
'well done miss granger and so do you mr malfoy. Both get 40 point each' smile the professor filius and moody ron hearing that the girl can made it fly.
'oke class, lets begin the wand in simple pose' said professor Filius, as he demostrate the wand.
An odd book made him decide to borrow for only 1 month request. Glad it really need for him to findout about the specific of the dream he having.
What he sees was, Hermione mouth was shut close with some strange red towel and her hand tied behind the tree that had a human face on it.
'no im not. Some people ask me that before and end up look sorry for insult' the blond boy calmly reply back to them.
‚Äòyes, my dear... the warrior wins by that we must protect our dear warrior~‚Äô says the mistress in smile as the people who disagree seem to happy as well. All awed in smile and by that the boy is destiny for his path to be bless by the lord himself, the god of the world.
Draco tease back for harry reply 'ouh harry..of course i support you and goodluck there' made harry smile again in return, as harry take the goodbye to him and walk to ready to start the game.
'well then..see you at hogwart, harry, byeee!' waving to harry before he run up where his mother still walk far ahead.
But. Who is that man? Said draco to himself as his eyes lurk to the wall where the figure stand few moment just now.
.....
The wand flash beautiful strong glow in the hold of harry. The boy look extremely happy for his wand.
'ah..' a voice inside sound a wake enough for her to heard.
He wonder who that man is? Draco thought as he look again around the other large window.
How draco going to explain and ron had made a contract with a dark desire he had..
'well..its urmm-' draco feel hard to tell but, before he open his month to answer, been cut off by hermione instead.
Well..im happy to triple story today..as i promise..
‚ÄòI wonder what harry smiling about in his dream I wonder hmm‚Ä¶?‚Äô a voice from a brown-hair girl looking more tired from staying up all night. As she keeps thinking the same thought over and over again for the dead of all her classmates, her best friends, the people she knows, especially what break her heart, is her parents.
'STAy AWAy!!!!' ron voice got deep as he put his head in pain.
‚Äò‚Ä¶I know severus but he needs you to control his form and i- ‚Äò
‚Äò-we disagree!! The fleux must be protected while he not need to worry for this matter! He just eleven years old YOU People gone crazy with decision of-‚Äò
‚Äòyes mother~ in muggle world. will see you soon on Saturday. Goodbye mother‚Äô
‚Äòwouh..‚Äô
Feeling his eyes slowly to feel down.
He the malfoy had find out that he is blood tie with a name called 'fleux' . He still curious as always and need to be wait for later.
'it is non of your business, traitor!' the boy, theo claim to be annoyed for draco to need fight from hex the person infront of him.
Just short notes here:
'drake? Im bored' pansy complain as she look like pms day.
'Up!' he said in second time and it work strongly for the young malfoy, which receive a warm smile from harry.
...im the sorting hat...
He do feel tired.. Better went to sleep now..
Hermione signed, 'what am I going to do? Ron and harry is still unawake, while I scold harshly toward Draco even, he doesn‚Äôt anything wrong. On other hand, why pansy give me that potion?'
'whats funny draco!' theo spat in hatred toward the young malfoy.
Next, the comptition is on for hermione and draco, as the nerdies and smart know it all...and maybe there can be bestie in next chapter.
Once again pansy slap theo. Draco thought in alarm to heard the sound of slam made him whimper.
'what had I done?!' harry speak in his mind in shock for hurting his draco.
He walk down to the stair that seem odd as it seemly gave it path toward where sorting hat located.
‚Äòwhy now? I can‚Äôt seem to understand what you‚Äôre trying to say miss granger?‚Äô said the mystery man in curious tone of hermione‚Äôs question.
The charming bright night of moon seem blinking the star as uncertain event happen after the night accident of troll. That uncertain happen upon from one of the slytherin student, young malfoy.
‚Äòwhat the?‚Äô
‚Äòhmmm... I see and did you know what is the name of that warrior?‚Äô the man asked his servant for more information.
'hey? Draco' a male voice speak from behind, as draco trying to calm his heart racing.
Draco land in hurry as he nearly trips down, ‚ÄúHermione! What is going on here? And why are you tied up or- ‚ÄúDraco bubbling as he tried to cut the rope that tied her hand and take out the weird towel in her mouth.
Well this is new. To see mr potter fear of reject. He thought to himself.
‚Äòplan? What‚Äôs that?‚Äô seeing his sister grinning for him not knowing the simple word she given.
‚ÄòGO back to bed. This is between your mother and me‚Äô Lucius stated in firm as stare with tears dropping slowly.
Another updates.. For you dear readers üíñüçÄ
‚Äòah yes draco?‚Äô
Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.
I change my mind and decided to challenge myself on sat or sun for new update‚Ä¶ hopefully I will make it to had many drama scripts in my head right now.
‚Äòis me mione!‚Äô said draco in big smile behind the closed door, knowing hermione tend to feel anxious with people this days.
Looking the guilty dooby 'forgive me master draco and what is that you need?'
‚Äòy-yes master‚Äô
‚Äúemm well I had another idea that can safe both of your friend?‚Äù
'hmmm..hmmm..the man is cold~ and lay up for another day..hmm hmmm..i-' the open door slide open made him stop his singing tune.
Severus and Minerva had the same thought as they both walk to their way to the class to proceed the teaching going, ‚Äòjust who is it that send letters to them? And why them that receive it?‚Äô
To her shock, she never thought her emotion quickly became anger as she knew this person that wearing proudly with Slytherin symbol attach on the long sleeves of the jacket, ‚ÄòYou‚Ä¶‚Äô She begun, ready to spring on her again.
He suppose to met clumsly neville in diagon alley but instead harry.. There..before went to mr oliver, aka..i had issues with name.soe for wrong grammar..so shush.. The mr-wand-know..for me he kinda creepy in smart..my opinion so no hate me for it oke..
‚ÄòI can‚Äôt do that! Mione!‚Äô
'shh..shh..my dear boy there there..mummy here' the mother voice like a lullaby to his ear.
The boy struggled to the right to the left and feeling drown all it once, 'no! Please don't hurt m-my brother!! Stop pl-' the young malfoy body shaken in fear as he still unease from the nightmare.
‚Äòl-let me think about it my love. We need to talk to Severus about this as well...  only him‚Ä¶ maybe can gave us some advice or help that we need right now‚Äô said lucius looking straight at his wife‚Äôs eyes, that full of tears of pain begging toward him.
What is wrong with this wolf? Thought Severus staring at the person, Remus who is busy staring in interest toward the floor than to him.
*sound of door open*
Each of them thinking the same thing and worry for that person who decide not to awake ‚Äòron..please wakeup‚Äô
‚ÄòI know! but he is our first son and older brother to draco, Lucius! Please!‚Äô begged the women with her tears burst in plead for her husband to save their lost son. It was decade of years for the wait after draco was still young back then.
‚Äòboobaboo‚Ä¶‚Äô
'..why indeed little one..' as if teasing him for being wary.
Unknown to them, the shadow man heard the whole talk between them and the shadow man soon dissappear, as if he was not there.
All the crowded people bowed in respect toward their mistress. One of the crowded, which is the soldier who prepared to speak out loud, ‚Äò‚ÄôTHE VOTE IS CLOSED!‚Äô he repeat it again, ‚ÄòTHE VOTE IS CLOSED!‚Äô
There was no good way to deal with this reality. Draco felt the tense, clenching panic and worry of sweeping despair hit her, leaving her unsure how to contain her panics. Harry's cock continued plundering away at her mouth, making her drool down onto her newly grown tits and struggling to fathom how any of this was supposed to work. She felt lost here, and the only direction that she felt like she had was to throw herself right into Harry's arms. It wasn‚Äôt what she wanted in the least. But there she was, growing desperate and panicked. The wetness between her legs didn't even really make sense to her; this newly grown pussy was something she had no frame of reference for how to experience, but she didn't have anything resembling a choice here. The growing chaos hit her head-on, and she was powerless against it.
Harry didn't know what the hell this was, but he didn't have a choice here. "Are you going to just talk?" he asked, dismissive and bitter as he stared Draco down from his spot. "You're the one who wanted this duel, now you're stalling."
Darcy was waiting for something else, too. When her door opened again, she was hopeful, wide-eyed, expecting. "Is it here?"
It was only, the two of them in the room, lit by candlelight, with the sounds of raw, brutal sex ringing out brighter and harsher with reach slam forward. There was nothing even resembling sense here, and with each stroke of his hops, Harry imposed upon Darcy his absolute worst, making her tremble and shiver harder through these feelings, growing messier under the oppressing pressures all demanding something worse and weirder and more chaotic with each shove forward. Harry found his groove, using his leverage on her hair to take her even harder.
*******************************
"Nobody respects me now," Darcy muttered, isolated in her dorm room, wrapped in blankets to help cover up her new body, scowling her way through eating the plate of breakfast someone had brought her down. She hadn't shown her face for days, buried deep in horrible embarrassment and the pointed certainty that more problems would arise from it. As few people knew about her duel failures as she could get away with, for fear of mockery and exposure. But hiding down here wasn't only a means of preserving her dignity; Darcy knew that leaving the Slytherin dorms would get her back in the line of fire for whatever depravity Harry wanted from her.
On the other side of the building, a furious figure chatter the books that mess all the entrance, as he trying to find the book of dark desire as well, 'where is it?! damn it!' the room were a mess, with one spell of his wand the library back to the way it is.
'aha!' a voice starled both harry and draco, as their eyes in quesion for hermione standing in idea.
Draco feel curious for the figure doing strange way toward Harry with the familiar red towel ‚Äújust who is that?‚Äù he whispers and carefully in silence made a spell toward himself, so he will be invisible from the figure from seeing him.
'Don't call me that pansy, sound weird!' looking back at pansy, as she smirk for his reaction.
‚Äò-we should prison the last fleux!! To protect him from the dark one and the enemy of cladorv!!-‚Äô
'told yah' pansy tease.
With that, the game of quittich is end.
Happy chinese new year to you all..
‚ÄúI... I was ermm‚Ä¶‚Äù pansy feel sad for not be an honest toward her close‚Äôs childhood friend, Draco.
‚Äòhmm hmm.. try to find me is it? Little girl? Wheres your master, leon?‚Äô demand from the unknown male voice that only her ears to heard, but can‚Äôt even see the unknown man in naked eyes.
' the dark desire!' draco answer correctly, hermione nod in agree.
‚ÄòI know severus but please for the student‚Ä¶ you just gave the potion and walk away. I know you still hurt for what they done, or he done‚Äô
'..yes..' it whisper. His mind stop and his eyes wide when he realise that 'it' read his mind.
Just who is he exactly. What secret his family hide. Draco frown in thought as he see his mother that always had the looks of panic and alert whenever he sit on the manor's library.
I wonder if it happen in train or somewhere..
Her silence was the only she gives to her master and with that, she disappears to finish her mission once again.
‚Äòdra-draco? Mi-mione? So-sorry guys I i-‚Äò
Thrust
Be curious reader..this is just about to start..
‚Äòplease‚Ä¶just tell me what year is this?‚Äô Draco plead as he repeat again his question.
‚Äòerrmm..it is at 11pm that day, that I read and copy this and-‚Äò
‚Äòwhat the?‚Äô Draco startled as he scans toward the mirror while looking back to himself then back to the mirror. The mirror shown his image self but in more beautiful way as the hair is longer below his hip, with wavy look. Not only that, his lips became more plump and-
The wolf lay back. Severus remembered the way he‚Äôd clutched his hand in pain after the fight with his own friend Sirius who accusing Remus of joining with the dark one and seeing Remus just relaxed on his back as Severus slowly massaging his hand.
*‚Ä¶earlier hour ago before it happens‚Ä¶*
'Hermione?' the boy spoke in question toward her who still reading the large book.
........
Trust issues happen toward Draco, Hermione and Pansy. Just what happen here?
-35...yes‚Ä¶36...no... 37.. yes‚Ä¶38... n- ‚Äò
The words shiver all over to remember why he still in run. He must. But how-
‚Äòwhy‚Ä¶just why! he rapes me! why he does it! Why just why! I-I thought we-we were family‚Ä¶I I‚Ä¶‚Äô tears burst as her heart torn for the truth, she had facing the trap she had not foreseen. God‚Ä¶ how on earth am I going to tell the truth to our family now. she in blankness in her mind, thinking that her family may deny or not. The truth must be told or...is it?
Now i had my free time to do this..
Opps...well lets begin..
'what do you want theor!' said pansy in anger mode.
‚Äòget out! Please‚Ä¶Lucas‚Äô yelled his father as he ran out with the door slam hard behind him.
‚Äòyou what? Lucius...honey I‚Äôm not asking for forever staying there‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm only staying there until our youngest son is born. Our little dragon who know nothing about his second brother‚Ä¶ or this devil man or his godfather that trap in that man‚Äôs hand and you! His own father..‚Äô said Narcissa as she glare toward the man who stand with hand had a black symbol on it.
The voice seem loud as he reach closer to the abandon house.
With that. Blackness is all he see.
The night was never ending of integration for both of the man. One seem stern for answer while one denied to tell than speak for the truth ,that the lord is indeed alive.
(See the end of the chapter for
‚Äòmistress, master Allen is already in dine room and I hope mistress enjoy the food,‚Äô he said with simple smile on his face.
As the time when by, it seems the ritual was done with the strange red flame that burst out of Harry‚Äôs body. Strange as it be‚Ä¶it was not a ritual I seen before, Draco thought as his eyes follow his childhood friend, pansy move into shadow and gone within a second.
'Child..is me madam poppy' slowly open the door while strolling the table full of medicine potion ready to cure ron's bruisers. One by one, the potion is pored to ron's body, each potion had different effect.
‚Äòhmm hmm.. such a delicious girl you had there, leon?‚Äô
The man name tanaka stop for a second as he takes a drink from the cup that serve on the long wood table, ‚Äò-And the safety of his will be fine, which I heard he had safely receive the forbidden wand and he been knowledge as the master of that wand. His magic will not detect as the wand control his magic and people like, outsider will only see him as the low magic‚Äô
Thank you for the kudos and bookmarks of this book that I made, may god bless you~
‚Äòalright then I agree with you, about you harry?‚Äô hermione says as she try to smile for them to see that she is going to be okay.
‚ÄòMarly! Where are you! Mar- ‚Äòshout the male voice again, as Draco feeling nervous as if he knows this person. but he doesn‚Äôt what or why he feels guilty.
Knock‚Ä¶
‚Äòyou got to be kidding me, Lupin. How can you not know that Lucius is Slytherin boy and also as head boy. I never thought wolf had this loss memory‚Äô
With that, his out to sleep on his old bed in his memory and snoring for first class tomorrow once again.
...thats the end of the each sort of house...
.....
'ron! Please!' hermione beg as ron finally confront them but still stay low on his head.
Knock.
He looks like under a spell? Draco thought as he looks carefully on ron behaviour.
You wonder why draco is not in different sort of house? Well that in next chapter...
The ritual of the bind spell was indeed complete. As the girl name padma patil was save as the marks slowly to disappear as if it was not there, however, the man name leon or terry was already dead as he says his last breath of a vow word for the two girls, he know.
There. The man that I see yesterday before she I mean me faint, ‚Äòerr hello?‚Äô as he slowly went to man name, Allen that seem prepare to pull the chair ready for him. I mean her.
Professor Severus feel relieved, knowing the headmaster not knowing the current happen for his godson as the warrior other than that harry prat potter.
In ther other side of the left room seem occupied by a man holding a fragile lizard while shutter to speak infront of the angry person came through the room.
The continue of the seer section and how it connected with fleux's history..
As he looks behind, he faces lit up into smile ‚Äúoh my‚Ä¶Cedric? What are you doing here?‚Äù
Pansy smiling for seeing her childhood friend was back as draco again and not the malfoy way of attitude, softly she tease back 'and theres draco i know as well'
The spell they wanted Draco to use was an old and depraved one. The loser was turned by force into a girl to be taken as a prize by the victor, with the victor feeling an intense compulsion to make the loser their bitch. A single load of cum filling the newly grown womb would make the situation permanent, and the intense compulsion to dominate would grow easier but still always be there as a hard greed for domination. Draco hadn't known any of this in its specifics, and she was about to learn the hard way.
"Holy shit," Harry groaned, not having seen that coming but finding himself all the more eager to lean into this pleasure as she worked for his attention. "You're getting into it. That feels so good." He grabbed her head and pushed the blonde down a bit more. "Can you taste yourself on me?" He couldn't resist gloating, but with Darcy looking up so meekly at him and clearly opening herself up to the sweeping pressure and panic of these ecstasies, could Harry really be blamed for that? He beheld the sweet, hopeless wreck of a girl compeltely lost to her own desires, fumbling deeper into the obedient reverence of magical submission.
She came hard, a howling and hopeless wreck giving up fully to the demanding tide of pure, crushing ecstasy. This felt too good to make any sense of, and Darcy plunged into the shaky guilt and fever of giving up to all of it, a hopeless mess wracked by ecstasy. "Potter, this doesn't mean anything!" she shrieked, blatantly unraveling under the orgasmic fever of passions too pure to resist, but she just had to accept it as inevitable, had to succumb to the hopeless, slavish passions taking her too far and too deep. It was insanity, her limbs almost wrapping around his body in acceptance and surrender of these unruly passions. It made her sick to know she was this powerless.
Her voice was a strained, painful screech now. Darcy was awash in the most hopeless and volatile emotions Harry could have ever imagined. He had no idea what to do here, but he felt bad for Darcy. He felt bad for Darcy in the way he would have felt bad for a normal person. One who hadn't insulted and attacked him, who treated him like shit. Who, by her own confessions, seemed to have challenged him to that duel under the orders of a wizard who wanted him dead. Every single thing Darcy had ever done to Harry made this seem simple to him, and she was right. He owned her now, and he could have easily dragged her by the hair and used her in front of everyone, called her a victory prize, rallied the morale of the Gryffindor house by railing Malfoy's big ass in front of them. That was how he'd used her when he won. Taunted her in a gloating victory lap while indulging in a body he now by all rights owned. Now he could do it even harder and let everyone behold his dominance.
.....
‚ÄòQUIET! YOU STUPID GIRL! TELL ME WHERES LEON!‚Äô
For once, he end up lost his 'malfoy-ego- as he feel his emotion break down for seeing his mother alive again.
''well yeah?' the first twin said
‚Äòwe did not say use him! we nee- ‚Äò
Cold. He thought as he carefully skip down the hallway.
Madam poppy examine ron over 2 minute as she heal with a potion dap on ron skin. The purple-green bruise seem nearly gonee as the redness were left as a sign to recovery.
The man 'draco' hurry to the bathroom and still avoid from looking at the mirror.
'from who pansy?' draco question while stand beside the grinning pansy.
Very similar but where. He wonder as he look the house seem unoccupied of people.
‚ÄòMarly? Are you okay? Are-‚Äò
....'-the dark desire needed someone who is pure or sinner for the ritual to be complete as-'
As his bestie left, draco read the letter one more time.
The glow shine to blue to red and pure white like the reaction before in the wand shop. There. A black ink that look like curse forms shimmer.
Slowly he open. Unbelieve able he thought as he seemly touch and feel emotion boiled inside him.
Something change on the green wall. The sound were loud but non of the people in the room were wide wake. As if the sound is not loud enough.
'why indeed.. You were tasked to stay there..and i know you are indeed many kind that..fit with other sort of house..but..you were tasked to be slytherin..' the more the sorting hat explain, the more puzzle draco about 'who' given him that task.
'‚Ä¶the down of fall may upon you, the fall of you is bound, let the term of soul is broken, made this person to sleep till dead, let the charm work for the cur- '
But only silent was answering to them both.
.....
'he may..but he the one the last fleux. His blood is half malfoy, half black family and half fleux..' the other male remain stay his believe.
Hmmm. Hmmm. Hmm-
.....
‚Äòyes, mother I‚Äôm telling the truth. I tell him that I meet him on Saturday, in private of course. And maybe mother and dad can see him on that day. I will tell the letter met us at London‚Äô said cedric, still in his smiling face.
'..only you can heard and see...' the book spoke and that still creep the young malfoy out.
The clothes looks half torn from the shirt he seen, while the pants still look fresh undisturb.
Draco pause a moment, ‚Äòharry can you give the water bottle, which is beside you?‚Äô
‚Äòbut father-‚Äò Lucas wanted to argue but seeing his father in tears and madness in his eyes make him having mix feeling inside.
‚Äòright yes that‚Äôs correct well... I ermm get going now and Im from the house of Hufflepuff. Maybe see you on Saturday morning? Said cedric, hoping that his cousin, draco will be want to see him in that day.
'err yeah' draco reply while looking away to hide his burning face, 'gosh why now! my blush is appear? gosh help me merlin and why did-'
‚Äòwell I had big news for mother and dad‚Äô
Let‚Äôs just begin these clues started~
'ohmy! Don't tell me you want to see that section!' draco's face had the look what hermione want to find.
Still in 15 minute done his so long bath as eleven again is still unbelieve for him. As if its a dream or a curse play in his head and he is laying dead to see it and-
sorry for the late updated..
Harry smile to draco and draco smile back in return, with that, draco back in his eating mode.
And yes again, i do like some original stay in this.
The boy slowly gulp like its hard to speak 'urmm..no i don't know, but i heard my parent is griffidor! And maybe i think i am griffidor. What about you?'
‚Äòhermione? Is that how it supposed to be happen?‚Äô a beautiful blond male, draco malfoy looks disbelieved what he heard on his ears, usually it was the mystery book that whisper on his ears.
As he shake his head for the feeling of butterfly inside of him, he ask what normally to ask for first year student 'by the way..do you know what sort house you may be?'
‚ÄòI hope this conclusion is right, cause we never know if this book can be seen at night or not!‚Äô
Just open you damn eyes gurgh!-‚Äò the blond boy named, Draco Malfoy as he seem lost his strength. What is wrong with me, thought Draco as he seems in lost thought. And why do I feel so weak-
here is the dark desire part 3, I decide to called it as ‚Äòunexpected‚Ä¶‚Äô, the reason is to made it more mystery and for you to be curious..
'..look..boy..look..my magic its real and..i will guide you..as promise..' the book reply as if it know his question for why he here.
Ahh..he remember this, that harry as seeker in the griffidors team. Draco smile as he watch harry follow professor minerva.
‚Äòsilent! Didddn‚Äôt I tttold you that yyyou must do ttthis mission wwwell‚Ä¶dddid you PETER! Crucio! ‚Äô hissed the dark lord again as he feel satisfied with the punishment.
‚Äòmiss him? Are u?‚Äô
The class end and things were not good as it seem from one of the students.
Boom. The boy face were black as chacoal colour and beside the boy is harry, 'sir..i think we need a new feather here'.
.....
‚Äòbrother! brother! come come plea- ‚Äòfeeling the wind getting strong for muggle game of kite to play for these two brothers, sons of Malfoy.
‚ÄòI heard it loud and clear. So, my dear cousin, may I know your name?‚Äô draco stare ahead to this mystery cousin of his.
‚ÄòI know my dear son~ lets keep praying my dear son‚Äô the mistress holding in pray position in hoping the warrior win.
Blink. Blink. He repeat the action toward the book beside him.
'what is it mother?' he ask to his smiling mother. Feel weird to see her smile. Did she smile before?.
'coming!' shout draco back as he hurry went down the stairs.
‚Äòyou called me mione! at last! Im glad you called me that draco‚Äô
'i wish that this is not a merely crush' said harry to himself as he walk toward the griffidors dorm.
Wonder who is this male is? Draco thought in his mind.
Clark? He ask to himself as he still not knowing about fleux's history and now this book.
...you may as ravenclaw...
Lets begin this triple story....
The male figure seems to tracked my gaze as it rose seeing my self from up to down whether I‚Äôm injured or not?
‚Äòthis is strange‚Äô Draco mumbled while trying his best to regain his eye-sight back.
Instead of answering pansy, theo then fly with the broom and still holding neville's ball.
‚Äòwell.. it just simple question which is not that harmfully to say right?‚Äô Remus calmly said as he smile wide toward the man name Severus, who had confuse face written on his face.
(3): please help me of a name or any name for this werewolf man? Please comment for this chapter. ASAP.
'-like you the one to talk pansy! Panty i called yah! You fuc- the loud slap on theo face is clear for all people there see. How red it was.
The clock sound seem echo and loud within the room as it repeat the sound.
Harry felt that he need to promise himself and to draco that he, harry potter, will not hurt anyone. Especially the one he love so much, which is draco.
Instead of screaming like other student. They heard non from the blond boy, slowly they open their eyes and see that the blond boy using a tease voice cooing the spider like its cute animal, that still stay on his lap the same position they throw.
'its fleux kind. I wonder why it fit you. Are you, young malfoy, the last fleux in forbidden tides family?' mr oliver curiously question him but before he stated his comment. His mother gave mr oliver a very quick words in anger 'how much!'
Cheeky but not. He whimper in thought as he stumble again to wear a hogwart uniform.
Froze. Thats what he felt right now.
In the full moon of night, the huffed of the wolf howl as the girl keep begging to stop for this man to stop.
'i wonder wheres ron? But i seen him with some slytherin if im not mistaken' harry face wonder as he stare hermione's confuses eyes.
Wonder what this figure wants‚Ä¶
‚Äòplease..somebody help me..please let me out I beg you..please‚Äô the girl name Padma patil, feel her throat sore as she still bang her head behind the close door.
'imup' the young malfoy mumble in his still state of sleep form, as he slowly walk to the big bathroom.
'er yeah..hey' in the minute, the boy name harry awkwardly reply back to the twins. The twins gave harry a cheeky smile and harry smilling back. Which still awkward way.
Breath in. Out. In. Out. Come on malfoy, calm down,  is just harry. Yep just harry. Draco calmly focus his breath in his mind as harry seem lost in thought. Not knowing that draco in panic moment.
...help me... somebody... merlin help me...
Very interesting. He thought as he slowly walk to the hall for the sorting hat ceremony.
......
Man~ well shall we begin dear readers..
'..well..yes young..draco..its a history about..fleux..that been century to your..family black and..malfoy and also fleux bound to it..' the book stop as for the young draco to regain the information.
‚Äò-Severus, look‚Ä¶I‚Äôm here because Dumbledore hire me, that‚Äôs it! Nothing more nothing less‚Äô the man with his aura of werewolf blood that booming in his body and his name is Remus Lupin.
His heart ache of the loss of his first son and also grieve toward his second son, that died before draco is even born, and he knew draco need know the truth from them. But when.
All the people even the mistress and the son looking anticipated toward the last speech of the vote, feeling the nervous was all in heard.
His mind flashed for the warm kiss feel on his forehead and the wand appear next him. All he know that he did put in the bag, and not beside him.
‚Äújust tell me later hermione. Right now, I think you need madam poppy to check up on you!‚Äù
The twins looks confuse why the beautfiul blond infront of them, is not replying back to them.
‚ÄòMarly! Are you listening? You know that you‚Äôre women and staying alone in the woods is dangerous you know and-‚Äò
'funny to see traitor of slytherin here' annoying voice appear to stop them from teasing each other.
So, he decided to use the muggle and un-Malfoy way, which is blinking. Yes, blinking like crazy to massage the muscle to make it more-
Well. Better put this bag before other student came.
'WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS, QUIRELL!!' the man voice echo the empty room as professor quirell seem to quiet downn than answering more.
With that, the elf gone.
'well let me see if you can catch this?!' theo throw the ball and with that, harry speed his flying to save the ball.
'lets just hope the professor is not here ron' groan another male voice.
'Draco!'
‚Äòplease‚Ä¶ find him, dear!‚Äô
I wonder how draco react?
Draco was shock as he knows this figure and that the figure was‚Ä¶
Beside him, pansy still giggling non stop as the stare from harry is still on him.
In middle of the night, different place of location but shocking drive happen for each students involved in that night.
'Alright lets go to sleep now, and I will see you guys tomorrow morning at 7am. don't be late. You need a good rest draco and harry, please rest as well with draco' Hermione bid her goodbye as she went to the gryffidors's dorm.
And when..he ready to went back home, which take him to catch up his angry mother that walk far ahead from him. Harry  had stop him.
the stories of the dark desire in another chapter which is in 28 or 29... both chapter I will updated soon.
The glow made a bound between the wand and the boy. The book whisper of same word 'slsi slsi slsi slsi slsi' making the glow more shine that before.
'harry, we better ask hagrid what the thing he was holding there for the someone who want to break a volt for that' hermione who now sitting next harry as she finish her explaining.
‚Äòaza..cough cough..‚Äô the man feel his leg loose in weak as he know that need to complete the spell for his master.
'my Frog!' a boy, neville screaming seeing his lost frog.
‚Äòmother~ im scared‚Äô says the young boy looking in sadness toward his mother‚Äôs eyes, mistress laila.
Then everything was dark to him.
It took them nearly an hour to figure out how to adjusted the information they just receive for the first time in the history, since harry been earn as the boy-who-lived. Now, the wave of news is turn to another boy, they never expected there will be a danger and an enemy arrive that will harm to that boy. And that boy is Draco Malfoy.
Riding the train is the best for him. As the window view never fall him as he still awed in the beauty view he love seen. The sky looks beautiful blue and the green forest that shimmer its beauty for people to look in calm moment.
'sorry..just i ermm..feel unwell' he lied as he know the book were whisper to him but no one does heard the book nor see it.
The book written clearly 'Beware of the seer's vision' his mind curious in question as he turn behind the book, 'done by fleux clark'
‚Äòmione!‚Äô
Draco nodded in agreement as harry decided to ask some more, ‚Äòso.. this book of dark desire can be seen the same as the one like the copy that you had, mione?‚Äô
*hoot*
Thank you again for comment and kudos..feel bless all over..
'give it back. Theo!' harry demand as the boy also riding on the broom.
Looking draco face also, making harry more worried and, they really need to do something about it, 'how about we go to the forbidden section to look more information about it. And Its better to know why it happen to ron. Why only ron involved.'
Instead of answering more, draco hug his bestie, pansy whose heart hurt to hit again her crush, theo.
The sunny day were still out as the two people waiting outside Hagrid's hut. One particular person seem worry and anxious to see him and worry about his other fren for being missing.
'dark desire? Is it a spell?' harry ask once more.
'Alright mione' both males says the same respond and slowly walk in the other room, not far from ron's room.
'hmmm hmmm.. Hmmm hmmm..wise is told~ told wise..dear is gone..hmmm hmmm hmmm-' as he was humming and again he been stop to humming the tune.
In her guts were right, the figure did follow her even in a slow walk, ‚Äòwho is this person‚Äô Hermione whisper softly, not even bare to spare a glaze behind her. Fearing inching her mind as if telling her to run but in her heart must facing the enemy, even if its danger.
‚Äòi‚Ä¶ wish I can forget minerva, im already old and I still like- ‚Äò
Gosh.. He feel hate school morning today. He wonder as he nearly half fall and half asleep toward the big bathroom.
‚Äò-why are you here!? Trying to hurt me again- ‚Äòsaid the man with his clothes full of blackness might attract any man and women without the man noticing of the attention at all.
‚ÄòYou‚Ä¶‚Äô She began, ready to spring on her again. To scratch out her eyes and choke her with her bare hands. She spoke as if Ron Weasley deserve to be a curse or Harry Potter deserve to be coma for an unknown reason. As if one of these occurrences could be not so-called betray toward my new best friend, Draco.
The mother trying calming him down as the boy still in tears for remember the dark night he never ever forget. Where his mother laying there dying.
The sound of bell ring behind him. 'oh hello?' a familiar voice saying to him. While his back is only the person seeing.
‚Äòpan!‚Äô he begs loudly
Draco look ron face getting healthy than the pale person before, 'just what happen to you, ron?'
‚Äúyou know~ your words I can‚Äôt trust at all and where were you when I need your help! I‚Äôm lucky enough that Draco the one that save and help me in that
I‚Äôm super sorry for the super late as I had need time to recall the dream, I had for the past few month and happy new year everyone (super late well yeah) and gong xi fa chai (for Chinese New Year). work from home ah ah...
The warm fire place warm the slytherin living room kind of form for any slytherin student to sit on. The design of silver and floral really epic of the simbolic of the green slytherin
.....
‚ÄòYOU‚ÄôRE what! Protect us to safety! Then why you submit with devil man who will kill anyone include our sons that still alive. Don‚Äôt tell me you forgot our middle son, Alex! He was just young and now! You follow that sociopath or devil I didn‚Äôt know how or when!‚Äô
He see that train still not full and only few people there.
'‚Ä¶the deed was odd, the deem to bound, the down of fall- 'the female figure name pansy whisper the weird mantra that sound like a poem word.
'-the ball were taken by the chaser of griffidors and goes to the big ring and goal!! The first of 10 goes to griffidors!!' as the finish speak of speaker made the crowd viral from the griffidors house.
But, they feel happy knowing the boy inside is honest.
‚Äòoh god‚Ä¶‚Äô
What is it about him that seem made males to look at him that curious. He thought as the both male whispering ear to ear, so that harry and him can't heard it.
The girl grumbling her speech fast as she begin '..the dangeroustermsforusto..do the potionisnotaccident..to..ermm happen as we studentsmustslowlystirthepotion..whichermm..follow..theinstructuon..and and err..the worse part istomade the potion..err explode.'
Neither harry and draco knows that other weasley also heard his answer, ron and percy, which also included others griffidors, neville and hermione.
‚Äòwell... it was not the right time when he was very young. Too young even for me to be near him. Now he is adult. Now. finally, I can speak the trut- ‚Äòdraco feel cedric tone had the sad tone again.
On the same evening in the other side of the building, there a bushy girl seem search through every section and reading every page without any miss at all.
‚Äòalright now go!! And protect him as I command!!‚Äô the female voice command like leader terms way.
'what? Want me to slap you again' the person still in anger manner as theo walk away with the minion follow behind him.
'good night..my dear nephew..be safe' the women kiss the young boy forehead and form away as tickling dust fairy.
Well here is the continuing story of Padma, which is kind of short (from dark desire, if you read from previous ones) of new torture or is it her beginning of freedom. The time keep ticking‚Ä¶. (padma‚Äôs part scene):
‚Äògoshh.. le- lets ahahahha‚Äô looking at draco in tears was really make her want to laugh out loud.
The fire feeling had warm the surrounding area, as the two student of griffidors focus on listening, and understand, for what happen to their friend, the weasley that became like this.
‚ÄòSILENCE!! YOU USELESS BOY! If that boy had found out how to break the curse, we all will be useless you must know that!! YOU USELESS BOY SERVANT!‚Äô
Feeling relieved to harry oke. He thought as his face back to normal.
Well lets the curious begin..
'welcome..young malfoy..' the sorting hat speak.
‚Äúif Cedric is my cousin now? will the dead of Cedric can be avoided?‚Äù whisper Draco as he about to open Harry‚Äôs room. There he saw an unfamiliar figure holding a red towel and in the same time hold Harry‚Äôs hand.
Something happen to someone and it was weasley but which one?
‚Äòfor-forgive me mas-master. The informati-ion that I got that the castle is full of protection spell and I umm- ‚Äòthe girl feels her mind blank and bowed lower than before, which she feel in fear  for the master in front of her.
‚ÄòI well... can we meet again? In private of course. Its err...‚Äô cedric said in firm way, while draco had his right brow up.
Hmmm. Hmmm. He hummed the tone of muggle music he had heard before when he as there.
Looking the path infront of him is still so unreal. Like it made him feel that he still in wildest dream. But he do still felt it. As he step down from the train.
'harry! Seriously stop! He will be there' the female huffed, as the boy name harry still walking back to back like theres a baby arrive to be born.
Well..lets roll it, i repeat~
Please wakeup harry‚Ä¶ron‚Ä¶we both need you... really really need you guys
‚ÄòHARRY!! JUST STOP! PLEASE calmed down please!‚Äô hermione look at harry in fear as if harry was not harry potter. But was him. Him is The one who should not to be name.
‚Äòplease! no!‚Äô
'well..well the celebrity is here, let me ask you a question boy, what is the first thing you need for fever cure'
'i think you know me' the blond boy scoffed for the twins confusion face.
'-ohmy--' the crowd seem focus to that person and that person is harry.
'stop stop..stop doing it like a madman and its wingardium leviosa not leviohsa' said the smart girl, hermione, which made ron groan hearing the girl statement.
...you may as slytherin...
After grabbing something to eat at the dining hall at Hogwarts, the three students began to walk back to the library that the brown-haired girl name hermione granger, already reserve the room again. The conservation was tense and deep in thinking of the book may or may not work for them to see and read.
'way best for me, mr sorting hat' he whisper for the sorting to heard.
'..yes your..great grandfather..come..you had no time..'
Fierce miss malfoy is not burning i made, just cute kind loving toward her only son, draco.
''ah..nothing, just feel weird. Don't worry about it pansy' looking relieve for pansy to stop from questionning him again.
‚ÄòGrrr I try sister‚Ä¶ but that human is very stubborn and maybe we should just kill his little brother! we did it before sister‚Äô reply the younger brother, name Clarus.
‚Äò‚Ä¶don‚Äôt worry severus as you can see, your potion may help him and by- ‚Äò
'don't callee me that pansy. And its not nerdy!' draco looking mused to see his bestie, pansy look more snicker than before.
Upon the warm atmosphere, the boy read in the silence time for himself. As all students sleep tight for adventure trip on the largest mansion own by Eagit Filut.
'-curse of him may open may close, the spirit kill his vibe of braveness, will it may upon of my trust as Slytherin, put this curse with my soul, let it burn to his told and let it be dry for his lover kiss to cure it all and-'
‚ÄòDoes it hurt?‚Äô Severus whispered with a more gentle tone.
Hearing his name been called is nostalgia again all over. Will he be stay in his olld house or worst another.
Lucas smile with ease as his baby brother slowly to feel sleepy with his small cute yawn,‚Äônite boba‚Äô while carrying him toward his cozy bed, ‚Äòwell.. I guess my baby brother is sleep mate now‚Ä¶ I love you my dear baby brother‚Äô
'it is a easy job, what you need is to kill her and don't forget that the ritual is not done yet!' the figure with only the eyes is seen, which wearing a mask with a symbol of red skull attach on it.
Smiling for himself and wonder why the sorting hat put him in his old house.
That‚Äôs a women‚Äôs name. just why this person-
'ron! Ron wakeup!!' hermione moved fast toward the fallen weasley.
At first the library seems odd than cozy to see in the middle of night of 10.50pm, hermione look around and feel shiver on her spine when she thought about the book name ‚Äòdark desire‚Äô.
'..come..' the voice repeat slightly to his ears.
'geez dray' the glare still towarr her.
‚ÄòOf course Draco I know, is not guilty at this matter because he was so busy worry about them and me than been involved. But you! You‚Äôre his close friend that trying to harm us and him. Like! Who does that! And now‚Ä¶ you telling me, that you won‚Äôt tell me! who was that person planning this ridiculous curse! Now I feel like it is useless to talk with you anymore!... I need space away from you‚Ä¶ Merlin damn sleep too‚Ä¶so BYE!‚Äô Hermione responded infirm and angry tone, as she pushed her way to the hallway toward the Gryffindor dorm.
‚Äòwhere am I‚Ä¶ wait?‚Äô pause the boy name Draco, as he realizes his voice sound like more feminine. These thoughts had me out of the bed and stumble toward the bathroom that seem open for me to see what happen to-
‚ÄòTHAT‚Äôs not possible,‚Äô  Remus said in firm and hatred bolded on the each sentence without looking the man that keep staring him in curious pace.
All the crowded look at each other as the opinion of the man seem very accepted and one of the group member in elves tripe decide to ask some question, ‚Äòwhat about the boy answer? Will he be saying yes for this matter of his and this kingdom‚Äôs future?! and also will he safe as he will be train my us all and, his magic will detect by them?!‚Äô
‚ÄòSILENCE PEOPLE! now lets begin our meeting by saying agree to this of not‚Äô once again the meeting is restarting to discuss whether it is right or not for boy, draco.
Darcy was supposed to move in to the girls' dorms later that day, arrangements made with the school to set up another bed and dresser in that room to let Darcy be with girls instead of with boys. Clearly, that place wasn't going to be any less hostile. Tears began to run down her face, but she wiped them away, shaking her head firmly, trying her best to keep from thinking about it. No parents. No girlfriend. No friends. Everyone was leaving her behind.
"I guess the spell only makes you submit, but it doesn't get rid of your attitude. You lost, Malfoy. Do you want to take something with grace for the first time in your life, or should I fuck it out of you?" The spell kept nudging him toward harshness in turn, but it felt rewarding, every vulgar response to Darcy making his cock ache harder, making his head spin with throbbing excitement and a focused delirium. Mounting pressures and demands grew fiercer by the second. "Or maybe I should grab your tits and fuck them myself."
‚ÄòAnswer me you‚Äôre WORTHLESS WOMEN!‚Äô
Now the question is brought up by the mistress, ‚Äòwill that boy be the warrior of the fleux?‚Äô as the people looking forward for the man, tanaka to answer the mistress‚Äôs question.
In the 1947‚Ä¶wind blowing as-
The room were mystery and only for slytherin side require for private to do so. The warmness seem slowly gone as the cold calmly ease the room
The heat come back again. He thought nervously know that the boy is looking at him with that forest eyes.
'its the same book that similar that happen to that person and its happen toward ron' draco reply back toward harry's unsolve question.
In the night where the library was supposed to be unallowed any visitors to be there, but there was a dim light for the young girl.
'well hello there~' one of the twin male seemly playful said and the other one seem stare toward him like harry did just now.
'why' he voice out to the book.
Wait. Cedric? Who is that? That boy is my cousin? Draco feel his mind is full of question.
‚Äòwohuuuuuu! Mother mother! The warrior wins he win!‚Äô shout the young boy name Allan in his happiness moment to heard the happy news, as his mother, the mistress Laila Merlyn.
‚Äúpansy! Seriously! Do I look like bad friend and why do I feel I don‚Äôt believe your words?‚Äù
'ah..yes please sit harry. Sorry i just shock for you here. And yes i was here early and you know my family is early bird' he yawn as prove his statement.
'NO!' harry pull back his hand from draco's full force, which end up draco fall down harshly, 'Owww!'
'made sure harry is injure and don't fail me!' the man speak in stern as professor quirell close again the cloth back on his head.
Within an hour‚Ä¶
‚Äòstop! I think draco need to heard all of this from you and not me, cedric. I‚Äôm just a third party. Even if draco is considered as my family. But. Me as his best friend must be respect his feeling no matter what situation. I‚Äôm sorry for my curious question. Sorry cedric‚Äô replied hermione with small warm smile she gave toward the boy, cedric diggory, who were waiting for the arrival of his cousin, draco.
Severus scanning the blinding little darkness of the room. Seeing only the fire pit that light up that can only dim more as the fire slowly to wideout.
'move away children' madam rolanda demand to the crowded students infront.
Draco nod in agree to harry as he curious to see hermione behavior is not the same hyper than she was at the morning, ‚Äòmione.. harry.. we better hurry to the room now. I feel the library at night is not good at this night today‚Äô
The frog search seem forgetten as the time flies. The train stop and that means they had arrive at the station.
(‚Ä¶another flashback memory in most precious moment, after Alex Malfoy was death for four years in the half, Draco is already reborn)
As they went there, there were shocking statement they heard.
Something pop a question in her mind made her brow up in question, 'by the way, harry? Wheres ron?'
'ugh!' a sound of someone in pain made him freeze to stop.
Enjoy my unmatch and change scene in different way to tell and enjoy the dramantic moment..
Harry gave a warm smile, 'yep im ready to beat your house. Sorry draco and please support me tho?'
Another shadow watch the whole thing. And with that, the shadow silently dissapear unnotice by the madness figure.
I wonder if i can made draco more curious and smart. He is likely my favourite slytherin, i can't stop that. But i do want him to had a hidden smart boy than other slytherin.
afternoon!‚Äù
'hey also hermione' draco look past hermione to greet her as well with warm smile giving to her.
That morning before the dinner happen, draco saw a man that really hide well like a shadow form. Who is that man?
'dobby?' he repeat and dobby still unmove.
thank you again for the lovely kudos, I can't stop saying it eheheh.
‚Äòlook! I‚Äôm here to give you a simple explanation I- said Pansy, but cut off by Hermione as she glares hard with disbelief in her eyes.
Like a time tunner.
'boy...' a voice from the book called out as, he slowly rises up from the ground floor.
With that, he faint with one knows the cause of it
'I really don't get it why headmaster accept someone like her!'
Why do he feel theres a eyes toward him. He thought in wary as he looks his surrounding.
'hmmm..i see that some of the four type rule had the related to ron, but I think that I need more, I cough cough-co uh cough sorry guys, harry can you get me water please?' draco's throat feel thirst as the shock of harry's situation of madness and now its ron's situation that involved of blood.
'now..its your turn mr malfoy~' mr oliver said that snap him away from harry happy day.
'wait!! you tell me that, our R.O.N is been use for his blood and why is it must hi-' Harry pause Hermione's word seem not to believe what he just heard, even the first sentence is not even done to be read by Hermione.
The word attach on the boy tatoo is 'bare of the newborn fleux'
'i forget. Oh shoot are we late. Draco we must-'
As soon as he arrives, his eyes won‚Äôt just believe what he just seen in front of him.
What happen to ron when he suddenly looks scary in meeting with hermione and harry?
Very alarming and-
But Draco meet a man who is the first malfoy but as his great great grandpa the lord Malfoy Wezchelfirce (I choose this name because I had this bizzare dream about is so yep...) (will use this name in diff chapter)
The soldier with the green symbol with the star ink on it on his head as if it is natural, ‚Äòthe vote for the warrior of the fleux for the young Malfoy, draco is about 1000 vote of yes. And the vote that disagree for the young Malfoy is about- ‚Äò
****************************
"You're disgusting," she said, but as she started to work up and down his dick with her breasts, how much did that judgment really mean? She was completely powerless against the pressures of his worst attentions, her body guided up and down his shaft in obedient gestures making all too clear what her body was ready to do, given the chance. Her eyes drifted toward his lap, and for all the disgust she was supposed to be bound by, all she could do was stare at Harry's impressive cock, almost drooling in the face of such ravenous temptation and passion. She'd never felt anything like this, and certainly never felt any attraction toward Harry, but there she was, falling desperately, dizzily deeper into the fascination and panic of letting this push her limits, and she could do nothing about it.
Harry didn't stop until he got what he wanted, until he was slamming forward and erupting down her throat. Draco struggled and sputtered her way through the taste of bitter semen flooding her mouth and gushing down her gullet, hitting her with overbearing sweeps of a pressure she was powerless to fight. It was too much, her thoughts spiraling out of control and plunging into the chaotic, dizzy haze of a pressure she wanted nothing to do with, but the choice wasn't hers. Not here. Her body was stuck in the swampy haze and chaos of having to submit fully, wishing for a clarity and a focus where there was absolutely none. Draco had to swallow, struggling to deal with the utter collapse of her pride as she eased back in total panic and felt like she had simply broken.
"But it did," Harry said. "You can accept that, or you can keep fighting, but either way..." Harry drew away from her, pulling out of her pussy and watching ash is load began to ooze out of her well fucked hole. "You're going to sit up and give me a titfuck." Shamelessly loving every second of the control he held over this situation, Harry craved more attention and more sinful indulgence in Darcy's body. She was beholden to his every word, left with no choice but to perform and submit, and the power that gave him over her was tremendous. Shuffling up to her feet, all Darcy could do was grab hold of her breasts and wrap them around Harry's cock, offering herself up fully to the pressures and the madness of something that felt utterly inevitable, that made her body shudder through the hopeless hunger and heat of this moment.
This was pure insanity. Harry had left Darcy to collect herself over a few nights, not in any hurry to gloat about it for a while, but now, before his eyes, Darcy was breaking down, and that was the one thing Harry was prepared for the least. Even the gender transformation and railing Darcy every which way was easier to swallow than the sight of the blonde crying on her knees, having screamed at a painting for him and now completely lost to her own emotions. Far be it from Harry to want to feel any sort of sympathy for Malfoy, but what was he supposed to do in a situation like this? He felt a weird sense of emotional panic, unable to deny that there was something to the sight of her sobbing that made him put aside every petty ugliness in their past to step forward and ask the one thing it seemed Darcy really needed someone to ask.
Opening the letter, she had hopes. Horribly tempered and uncertain hopes, but hopes. Within this letter was going to be the word back from her parents, and hopefully, it would be good news. Acceptance. Forgiveness. She'd failed to stop Harry, and now she was stuck as a girl. Voldemort himself had wanted her to do this, and what had that earned her?
There was one 'good' thing about the tantrum she threw: people in the common room could hear it. Some girl standing outside screaming at the top of her lungs to see 'Potter'. It was definitely Malfoy. Everyone knew it.
Hogwarts kept a stock of second-hand uniforms for poor students, or students whose clothes were damaged by some sort of magical mishap. Darcy focused on the poor part as the uniform of some equally buxom Slytherin from ten years ago's uniform became her own. It wasn't something she was proud of in the least, but pride wasn't something Darcy got to deal with anymore. She couldn't deal with Crabbe or Goyle anymore. Not even Blaise. All three of them were the absolute worst to her now, being sexist pigs non-stop.
Darcy's hand reached out from her wrapping of blankets, and her hand snapped out toward it, a scowl spread across her face. "Leave," she said, clutching the letter tightly, burning up in raw shame as she tried to compose herself enough to open it up. Crabbe and Goyle used to be ready to do anything for her. Now, they were too busy laughing like jackals about the idea she had breasts. It was a fall greater and more infuriating than Darcy knew how to deal with, but she remained ultimately powerless here.
"Darcy," he said again. "Your name is Darcy now."
The squirming, bitter refusal on Darcy's part to conceded how badly she wanted it felt less and less convincing by the second. She was caught in the bizarre spiral of panic and worry, wondering how to stand up for herself while inching ever closer to conceding to Harry that she liked it. The taste of her pussy was indeed all over his cock, but somehow the tart flavour didn't bother her. As a boy, eating pussy had been awful and Draco had gone to every length possible not to eat Pansy out. But here, slathered around Harry's cock, it tasted oddly enticing, hitting her in a way that still didn't make a lot of sense, but in the place of sense came something more satisfying and ravenous, a passion growing fiercer with each shove forward, demanding so much and leaving no sense of control to spare these growing panics. It just kept building.
Harry's reply was a sharp and incisive, "It is." The absolute worst of the spell's influence was gone, but he remained harsh, staring down at her with the full certainty he owned her, and the desire to keep dominating her. "This was your spell, Darcy."
"You were going to turn me into a girl?" Harry was incredulous, but not exactly against what eh was looking at here. Maybe it was the way the sight of Draco's new female form seemed pretty hot in a bitchy mean girl kinda way. Maybe it was her absolutely massive tits. Draco's pants had stayed intact, but strained under a bigger ass and rounder hips. He could only imagine how gorgeous her legs looked. "You were going to turn me into a girl." He said it again. Angrier this time. A violet glow began on him just as intense, another part of the spell that Draco hadn't even begun to realize the scope of when he committed to doing this, but had he known it, maybe he would have been more apprehensive.
So she sat and she stewed, seeing the dirty looks she got, brought the work she missed in class while insisting she'd come down with 'sickness'. Madame Pomfrey had been down to examine her and agreed that until there was a solution found, missing class was ideal, but Darcy knew there wasn't any good way out of this. She‚Äôd read up on the ritual--there wasn't a damn thing else to do--and discoverer that once the loser was cummed inside of, the spell was permanent, with no known wizard ever managing to break it once a couple had mated to completion. She was bound to Harry now, and would be for the rest of her life, by all accounts.
Where once the snide and vain boy lay, now lay a girl whose platinum blonde hair suddenly ran long, reaching down past her shoulders. Her face took on sharper features, softer and fuller lips looking perfect for pursing while sending catty comments about classmates sailing across the room. But those weren't the things Harry noticed first. What he noticed first were the outrageously plump tits that had torn Draco's button-down shirt wide open, forcing to apart and leaving them shamelessly exposed. There was no way Harry could have paid notice to anything else in the sudden surprise of the moment, his eyes tightening their focus on her chest.
"If you're hanging out with us because you think we'd protect you from him, you're a dumb bitch," Tracey Davis said.  "We wouldn't even protect you if Crabbe and Goyle wanted to fuck you."

It felt good. it felt so good. She hated that fact more than anything, thrashing under the guilty ache and worry of these pressures, but the reality was, this all felt amazing. Searing ecstasy took her down low, left her a twisting wreck struggling to deal with how senselessly all these pleasures could wear at her. Draco couldn't help but burn for more of this, her hips rising off of the floor, moans struggling to try and escape from her lips in a desperate show of passion and heat, of a fire burning brighter through her, and she just didn't have a prayer of stopping it now. It was too much, and every part of her body ached and burned with a focused sense of dismay.
"You were going to turn me into a girl and fuck me," Harry scowled, his hand going for his jeans, posture shifting as he pulled his zipper down and opened himself up to the sudden chaos of his strangest wants. "It failed, Malfoy. You're the girl now. You're my girl now." Something came over him that he didn't fully understand, driven by the spell itself and compelling him forward with a harsh spike of greed and want.
Draco didn't want this duel. The thought made him wince. He was compelled to do it. By his father, by the other Death Eaters, by the desire to do something to prove he was worthy and that he and he alone could remove Harry Potter as a threat. Success here would silence everybody and solidify himself as a success story, as someone who Voldemort would want in his service. "You don't want me to stop talking, because once this duel begins, you will be a slave to the Malfoy family." Draco didn't understand this ritual much himself. The stakes and the circumstances behind this obscure ceremony left him completely unsure of what would even happen. From what he'd been told, the loser would become instantly bound under the heel of the winner, subjugated and beholden to every command. There was a cold cell waiting for Harry, and he'd step into it and never see the light of day again.
Darcy was sure Harry was done now. She needed him to be, feeling the dizzy ache and the delirium of having been completely overwhelmed, taken to the limit by Harry and his absolute worst efforts. "Okay," she said, drawing away, wiping some cum off of her face. "That was--never speak of this again, Potter, or I will make sure your life is destroyed."
It took all of five seconds of Darcy's furniture being brought into the girls' room for her year for Pansy to 'accidentally' douse the mattress in a liquid used for the creation of discrete 'short range' stink bombs, a common prank from the Weasley twins when they wanted one specific person to have to smell something awful but wanted to avoid a teacher's detection for as long as possible. The bed reeked of death, and Darcy had to stand there with her effects in a box and nowhere to put it. Darcy didn't even bother to check the drawers; she noticed a billowing green smoke spilling out of one of the drawers, and she just knew they weren't safe either.
Darcy was red in the face, screaming at the painting of the Fat Lady while demanding entry into Gryffindor Tower. Her body trembled with rage and with panic. She wanted to cry, but all of her sorrow manifested as blistering anger. That was all Darcy was really ever equipped to feel. She was furious with this, but she didn't care. She stomped around, slamming against the wall, threatening the painting and looking like an absolute embarrassment in trying to do so, having no diea what else she could do in the face of this all. Things had been humiliating enough for her already, but she wasn't getting better, and this obstacle now to her even beign able to rest was infuriating.
Harry had no intention of engaging in any real duel with Draco. He moved to catch him off guard with a single spell, sidestepping a sudden shot of magic from Draco and casting his disarming charm. It was the 'safe' method. The easy method. Draco didn't see it coming, so locked into his violent mindset that he never considered defense, let alone defense against a non-attack. Not until his wand left his hand and was soaring across the room. Draco couldn't do a damn thing about it, watching the wand go and yelling out in panic. The duel was over in mere seconds, and embarrassment would surely follow.
