Potter’s warm hands cup his arse cheeks and pry them apart. It’s a baptism of fire when the slow drag of Potter’s tongue trails up his taint to his hole.
“What?” Draco feigned surprise. He glanced down at the chart. “This says you’re Father Christmas!” He turned to the intern who’d been watching the both of them with wide eyes. “Get me this man’s actual chart.”
Andromeda became a devoted focus for Narcissa, and in turn, so did Edward Lupin. Luncheons and dinners evolved into holidays and vacations spent in each other’s company. For someone like Draco who had spent half his life in the solitary confines of his own rigid familial structure, the burgeoning new paradigm left him ill at ease and full of doubts. How could forgiveness come so easily? How could pain be replaced with hope? How could he ever look either his aunt or his cousin in the eye without feeling the excruciating remorse of having failed them?
Draco eyed her while she spoke, shocked to see her in crimson robes with the Ministry seal plastered across her left breast. Draco kept his features neutral and asked, “On your way to work?”
“I was wondering when you would notice.” Malfoy crossed his arms and bit his lip. “Where should I start?” His gaze swept over Harry. Malfoy’s face was the epitome of control, the exception being an untamed darkness eclipsing his eyes. “Perhaps with the table of contents you failed to include in your latest report?”
Draco studied Potter. He was offering his godson a slight smile, which may have fooled the ten-year old, but Draco could see the grief in Potter’s eyes. It pulled at a deep part of him that he dared not ever acknowledge, at memories that he never wanted to relive. For a brief moment, Draco had wanted to selfishly champion the Slytherins, but the desire to do so quickly faded when Teddy let out a large sigh.
It all felt familiar and yet still so unknown to him, but in a few short years, the togetherness became an intrinsic part of his happiness.
Draco rolls up his notes and shoves them in his briefcase. When he turns around, Potter’s come to his side of the counter with a look in his eyes that Draco would say is no longer mild satisfaction but heated desire.
“Wow,” she pressed her lips together. “Well, take some time to yourself. Maybe grab an extra session with your Mind Healer.”
Draco rushed into the O.R. prep room and backed himself against the wall. His first patient was bleeding out. His first patient was suffering unknown wounds from an unknown combination of spells and had a hemothorax.
Potter bites his lip and shouts back, “There’s something up here.” Thomas nods and makes his way up to join them. Draco’s curiosity intensifies as Potter takes out his wand and casts disillusionment charms on them. “Come on,” he says and points to the fallen tree.
“So Draco,” Blaise said, widening his eyes and turning his head away from Theo. “Pansy told me she and Alicia came over and rid your bedroom of a Voldy Signet?”
“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” Blaise shakes his head. “We don’t know how magic will interact with the charmed lake water.”
Draco glared at him and pulled out his wand. “It’s a broken leg. We get to see how badly damaged everything is—” Draco raised it, “Do I have your permission to perform an assessment charm?”
Harry had taken care to showcase the paintings and their artist, and the consideration for the work and for Draco and his family heritage was almost too much to fathom. There were no other works of art with such careful placement, and the only explanation Draco could imagine was that Harry was in fact trying to preserve the Black family history in one way or another.
“You’re awake,” Draco raises a brow. He takes a few more steps forward and stands next to an oversized armchair.
“He hasn’t woken up?” Draco rushed forward and examined Potter’s appearance. He was wearing a baggy t-shirt and boxers and had scrapes and bruises all over the exposed skin of his arms and legs. Draco leaned down and lifted his eyelids, casting a
When he pulls the quill back to admire his work, it brushes across his lips in a feathery light touch. He closes his eyes at the sensation and revels in the tease of it. A gasp sounds from across the room. Draco’s eyes snap open. Potter is staring at him from the other side of the counter, his face flushed.
Potter shakes his head. “There are five enclosures...one for Ron and Hermione. One for Dean and Seamus. One for Luna, Justin, and Caleb—”
Draco dressed himself quickly, throwing on a faded blue t-shirt and a pair of old jeans before grabbing his medical supply bag. He rushed to the Floo and didn’t look back, shouting his aunt’s address and stepping into the flames.
After he casts extra warming charms on his boots and gloves, Draco begins to admire his surroundings. The forest vibrates with magic, from the critters scurrying at their feet to the languid enchanted frostvines that wrap around the trunks of trees to warm them. Draco’s never been surrounded by so many new and different magical species in one place. He’s mesmerised but also disappointed that he only just took the time to experience it on their last day.
“But what does it matter if at the end of the day he treats you with respect? Values you as a person? A...friend even?”
“You’re right,” Potter nods. Draco’s certain he’s never heard Potter’s voice so deep. He’s never heard it come from a place like this. “I should be the one devouring you.”
Draco’s eyes went wide as he realised how monumentally unorthodox the request was and by the look of shock on Weasley’s face, he was shocked as well.
The other man stares back at Draco, his eyes saturated in lazy contentment. “I was waiting for you to come to bed.”
He kept a quick pace down the deserted walk, still unpacking his rather unexpected encounter with Weasley. Draco had anticipated malign looks at the very least, and stinging curses and wands out at the worst. He hadn’t considered Weasley would’ve used the last decade to mature in some of the same ways Draco had. There’d been no insults between them, no punches or curses thrown. In fact, Draco stopped mid-step when he realised Weasley had actually thanked him—for delivering the pallet and for taking care of Potter.
“I don’t know,” he replied, his blue eyes wide. He gulped. “We were supposed to have dinner with him and he never showed. After we ate, we went over…”
, he thought. He pocketed his wand and turned to leave, his ponytail sliding forward over his left shoulder.
He takes a few deep breaths and tries not to startle as the soft hairs from Potter’s legs tickle his fingers. Draco reaches Potter’s thighs and thinks he might cry. The thick, corded muscles of his quads peek out above his knees, and Draco doesn’t want to think about what they look like in flexed, what power they could give him when he’s—
He poured himself another glass of wine. He let the warmth of it seep through him as he drank it. The flavours tickled his palate and the alcohol loosened his spirit. It managed to relax some of the parts of him that he kept coiled and subdued. Forty minutes passed and suddenly he was mildly drunk. So he let himself get angry.
Weasley attempts to cast several Warming Charms. “Nothing’s been working.” He kneels down and grabs Potter’s face. “Harry!”
Draco almost fell backwards at the shock of it. Harry Potter standing in the middle of Borgin and Burkes, his eyes a desperate, vivid green. Draco didn’t have a chance to blink before something moved near Potter, something metal, scraping harshly against glass—but Draco was too transfixed to break his gaze.
“There were a few reasons,” Potter bit his lip and met Draco’s eyes, raising a finger and pointing to him. “He’s one of them.”
Having his hair down was liberating, but Draco decided he was against going out in public looking like a recognisable Death Eater, or rather, a somewhat more notorious one. To be mistaken for Lucius was a moment he’d dreaded and imagined a thousand times over. And yet, he didn’t want to tie his hair back up. So he gathered a bit of it from the upper half and tied about half of it up with the ribbon. A few strands fell around his face, and he thought the compromise suited him well.
Draco craned his head around to see what she meant. He looked just in time to see Potter leaving the dance floor, wobbly on his feet, animatedly having a conversation with three of the people who had been dancing with him, one of whom was helping him stay on his feet.
The sun was just peeking through the bay windows of the foyer as Draco arrived home, exhausted and on edge after a gruelling fifteen-hour spinal regrowth. But it was Sunday, and he knew his mother had a full breakfast spread waiting for him. Draco had planned on eating and visiting with her before showering and passing out for at least a few hours of rest.
Draco let out a sigh of relief. He just needed to steady himself; he needed to be alone. “Potter,” he managed to say, his eyes still cast downward. “
Draco can hardly breathe as he hooks his thumbs under the waistband of his pants and tugs them down. He turns and shuffles toward the pool, aching to get under the water and cover his slight arousal.
“I—” Draco stared at her and suddenly felt an overwhelming rush of regret. How could he jeopardise what they were building by doing something illegal in their home? And for what? His own twisted satisfaction? Harry Potter’s arse?
Though there are a handful of times Potter’s gaze flickers across the fire. When their eyes meet, something subtle and sensual rises up within Draco, so he looks away and concentrates on Longbottom’s current Herbology experiment and removes all thoughts of firelit green eyes from his mind.
“They’re living in holes in the soil,” Malfoy droled. “If there’s anything down there, I’m sure they’ve made use of it by now. Ask them if they’ve got any human femurs for bed posts?”
Draco followed him inside, somewhat eager to see what Potter had done with the Black family home. Whatever decor might have remained when Potter inherited the property, the home now featured a modest Muggle style with few furnishings of a modern, simplistic design.
Potter stares at him, a faint flush spreading from his face and down his neck. The steam must really be affecting him. He breaks his gaze and runs his fingers over the top of the water, saying, “It’s—it feels good—to ahh—” He bites his lip. “You know, I still haven’t felt a normal temperature since Ron push—” he stops. “Since the lake.”
“You don’t think this would take away from the character of the room?” Harry asks, holding up a pale grey sample to the wall.
“So...” she said. Even in the darkness of early evening, with only the streetlamps illuminating them, her eyes were bright and wide and fixed on him intently. She licked her lips. “That was wild.”
“Did you just say—” Draco caught Potter saying as he entered the room. When their eyes met, Draco almost fell backwards from the vibrant intensity of
Pansy and Blaise led him to a round booth on a raised platform overlooking the main dancefloor where a group of familiar faces greeted them. Greg Goyle was sitting cosy next to Daphne Greengrass, while across the table, Theodore Nott sat practically coiled around another man who looked mildly familiar, but Draco couldn’t place him.
He sighed and closed his eyes. He had spent almost ten years training for this day. He’d been methodical in his work, had sacrificed so much, had grown an easy, addictive confidence that grounded him. And yet, the moment was here and it didn’t quite feel real.
Harry shivered as Malfoy’s words sent sparks of want through him and he didn’t skip a beat. “I want your mouth on me.”
The cork slides up with a pop and Harry raises a brow. “I know, but this way is more satisfying.” He walks the bottle over to the table where Draco had failed to notice two place settings laid out. “And how many times do I have to say...it’s
“I’ve done some thinking,” he manages to say. His eyes adjust to the dark room and he it feels like an eternity before Potter replies.
Draco rolls onto his back and stares at the ceiling, desperate to hide the swell of emotions he’s feeling. It’s all so much at once, and at the same time, he’s convinced he’ll never get enough of it. He turns his head and looks at Harry. They share a tender moment as Harry’s hand comes up and rests on Draco’s thigh, stroking it lightly, lovingly, almost possessively.
“I’ve spent the last fifteen minutes with my tongue up your arse and you can’t even call me by my first name?”
“Why on earth would you?” Draco asks, mind focusing back to their earlier conversation. Potter and Ginevra weren’t together anymore.
The back and forth between them tugged at the closed doors of some odd, amusing nostalgia. It was as if their words and his inebriation were breaking through most of Draco’s self-imposed barriers and allowing him to feel the familiar satisfaction gained from riling Potter up. The challenging glint in his eyes was beguiling, and Draco wanted more of it focused on him.
Potter cleared his throat. “I knew a few Hufflepuffs who were braver and stronger than most Gryffindors.”
He bit his lip and tried to think of all the things he’d wanted to say to Potter, but at the time, they’d only evolved from
He took a quick shower, cast a Blackout Charm on his bedroom windows, and slid under his plush comforter. He’d been sleeping much better since that night at the Tricky Thestral. While it brought him no pleasure admitting anything that might boost Blaise’s ego, Draco had to admit that his friend’s reassuring words and offer to get the Brilhante Berries had somehow flipped a switch in him, as if the knowledge that he
There in the midst of unidentifiable bodies pressed together, he could easily discern Harry Potter clinging to a man and dancing provocatively to the music.
Biting his lip, Draco curses his luck. The pout Potter gives him could’ve made the Dark Lord himself turn sides in the war.
He’d clutched the parchment so tightly it crumpled in his hands. He’d scarcely been able to breathe or stop the flood of tears that fell from his eyes.
Draco blinks. “You had a lot riding on the chance that I was a Phaeden Blanchfarx fan. You’re lucky Blaise gave them to me for Christmas.”
“Merlin,” Draco closes his eyes. He’d be daft to let this moment slip away. He takes a deep breath and stands up. He glances at himself in the mirror, runs a hand through his hair, and leaves his room before he can talk himself out of it.
In his third week, a potions accident in a private lab brought eight badly burned individuals into his ward, three of which he lost on the operating table. And despite having ample experience dealing with similar cases in Paris, seeing the charred skin, smelling the burning flesh, and recognising the look of pained terror on the victims’ faces never got any easier. No matter how much he tried to compartmentalise, he inevitably saw Vince reflected in each and every one of the burn victims he treated. When he couldn't save them all, it crushed him on both a personal and professional level.
The memory grounded him and he felt a bit more at ease. Draco walked up to the till counter and explained he was there for a delivery. A rather disgruntled looking clerk nodded and waved him behind the counter and through a beaded curtain. The shoppe’s backroom looked like a bomb had gone off. A dreary sort of purple fog hung low on the ground as a stack of boxes and books rose up to the ceiling.
Draco felt as if he needed to ask permission before he could begin searching for substances and drugs amongst Potter’s things. He glanced around, unsure of where he would even begin.
“They—” Draco stops, his thoughts flooded with Weasley and Finnigan’s remarks. He concedes the point. “So what if they do.”
A simple Vitals Charm revealed an accelerating heart rate and extremely low pressure, which was no revelation given the amount of blood covering the man’s torso. Draco rushed a minor assessment on the large gash over the man’s left lung, certain it would show a hemothorax. It did. There was blood pooling in the man’s chest cavity.
took full stock of someone’s magic and put it into a series of quantifiable terms. It helped establish magical signatures and residual spells and was mostly used by Healers in congruence with law enforcement agencies. But there were a handful of cases where a person’s magic could affect them, causing problems from within, and lead to any number of other side effects.
Potter breaks his reverie and sits down next to him. “You alright? You’ve been quiet ever since the Fae this afternoon.”
Draco’s fingers find their way to his flies which he unzips as fast as he can. Potter steps back as Draco drops his trousers, kicking out of them eager to return to Potter's embrace.
They stay there watching for what feels like hours when in reality Draco knows it’s only about half an hour. Potter taps them on the shoulder and guides them back to the main forest path. When Draco makes his way across the fallen tree, he can feel the phantom touch of Potter’s hands on him. The combination of the memory and the electric Fae magic leaving his system gives Draco a subtle, sultry sort of intoxication. He barely remembers the trek back to the cabin he’s so caught up the warm, enchanted daze.
He finds his way into the kitchen and spies the table filled with wrapped gifts and envelopes, and mortification hits him that he’s forgotten to get a gift. He rushes home through the Floo to find an empty sketchbook and set of charcoals for Teddy.
All through his internship in France, Draco surprised even himself with moments of clarity and resourcefulness. In the harrowing life or death situations in which mere seconds could change the course of someone’s life; when everyone else was stumbling, falling over the precipice of mystery, Draco would cross the threshold of clarity with a steady and practised hand.
The door behind him slammed opened and someone rushed in. Harry craned his head around and eyed Vesper from the Beast Division. The man stopped, hunched over, and rested his hands on his knees, panting heavily to catch his breath.
Weasley and Finnigan head inside and Potter sidles up next to Draco. The heat radiating from him is enough to make Draco think he might’ve cast a Warming Charm on himself.
It takes about a half an hour for them to climb the lower hillside to the springs at the base of one of the mountains.
He closed his eyes and downed his drink. “Oh, here we go.” He stood and went to meet her in the hall. “I’m here,” he called. “What in Merlin’s name—” Draco started, but stopped when Pansy’s form came into view. She was wearing some sort of black mini-dress and strappy shoes and was barrelling toward him with a wild sort of determination.
He manages to get the joggers on after taking a moment to recite a few potions recipes in his head. He stays busy casting Warming Charms on throw blankets and couch cushions, then makes two cups of tea and puts a Stasis Charm on them should Potter wake. When Draco finally finishes tucking Potter in, he wipes his brow and realises he’s been sweating. Between the blazing fireplace and all the Warming Charms and Potter’s bloody girthy pleasure rod, Draco’s begun to overheat.
Most of the hospital staff, his mentors, and his patients would have heralded Draco as the next prodigy; but with every single success came the inevitable criticism and confabulating, the whispers of his weekly parole meetings and glances cast down to the long-sleeves of his robes. The mistakes of his childhood always seemed to shadow him when the spotlight was brightest on his achievements, when Draco might believe that he could be totally and utterly redeemed; it became apparent that would never be the case. No matter how much work he put in, the past could not be erased.
Draco blinked and sighed, “A year of not having the threat of Azkaban looming over one’s head might do the trick.”
Before he could process what he was seeing, Mr Burke shuffled back to the counter saying something about silver knobs. Draco turned his head for a brief moment to acknowledge the man, and by the time he’d turned back around, Potter was nowhere to be seen.
“You’ll be rehanging these around the home?” Draco asks, a hint of surprise in his tone as he casts a glance at some of the undignified medieval depictions of Muggles.
” Granger clenched her jaw and stared down at the ground. He realised they didn’t necessarily want answers in that moment, they wanted comfort. And they needed to be able to trust him. “I can’t tell you what exactly is wrong with him,” he finally said. “But the initial evaluation leads me to believe there is no lasting damage. If I’d have to take a guess, I would say that a few factors have led to a state of complete physical exhaustion, and he’s merely in a regenerative state. In such a deep sleep, it is rare, but one can have an episode similar to a night terror when the sleep cycle is interrupted or…” He paused and turned to Granger. “Potter is strong. Stronger than most. He will be alright. I have to be as thorough as possible, and that means examining the state of his magic.”
Harry pours two glasses of wine and motions for Draco to sit. Not only is the chicken carbonara fantastic, but the freshly baked bread and wine selection makes the meal complete. Perhaps it isn’t that shocking that Harry Potter can cook. Draco idly muses that pasta isn’t too terribly difficult. He admits that bread can be harder to master, but focuses on other things, dismissing that line of thinking. Later, when he’s alone, safe and secure and not sitting at Harry Potter’s kitchen table, he’ll imagine the care and attention Harry must’ve taken, his strong hands kneading dough in a simple, methodical rhythm.
He started back toward the Trauma Station to see if he could offload some of his cases, but someone grabbed his arm and hauled him back around.
After opening every cabinet and drawer in the bathroom and finding nothing, they searched the bedroom. The first thing Weasley did was walk up to the four-poster and cast a
“Your willful ignorance is only sexy when I’m not leaking through my pants,” Potter seethes. He stands and catches Draco’s gaze in a sizzling, intense look, pointing a finger and pressing it into Draco’s chest. “Figure out if you want this.”
“The lake was not part of the plan. But the books were. I knew you would love them and we could talk about them, and maybe, eventually, about us.”
, the fact that it had only been eleven days since Potter’s left arm reattachment surgery, and the startling statement Patil had made during their first Post-Op check-in:
At first, he focused on the family unit — the thing that perplexed him most — and how it had changed; suffered; evolved. The permanence of empty chairs at dinner tables, he thought, showed the mark of loved ones lost to death, but also, from the Death Eater’s view, life imprisonment. His self-portrait of his family’s Christmas dinner showed two older matriarchs, a six-year-old boy, and Draco seated at a table for eight. The missing figures were replaced with shadows and empty spaces, the hollow reminders of loss.
He carried the packages out by their strings and rushed to the designated Diagon Apparition point, his thoughts a tangled mess of anxiety and doubt. Had Potter really been there? Draco could’ve sworn he’d been standing not ten feet from him. If he
“I can’t deal with you,” Blaise walks away and hauls himself into the sleigh to sit beside Longbottom.
There was some shuffling to his left and Draco turned back to his friends. Pansy waved at him to get his attention and distributed the drinks.
Whatever reprehensible reputation followed him, Draco’s credentials as a healer were indisputable. When it came time to move on from Notre Dame, to apply for the position of healer-in-charge, Draco considered a myriad of different options. He’d looked at private clinics, foreign institutes and outreach programs across the globe. He’d sent his resume and letters of recommendation to Russia, Japan, South Africa and New Mexico, United States. Never did he consider a move back to England, especially not after the varying levels of judgment he had faced in France.
Fueled by the sudden comprehension of his feelings, Draco turned off the shower, dried himself, and rushed to the desk in his bedroom. He scribbled out a note to Blaise.
“This is ridiculous.” There was a crash as something metal hit the floor, presumably Potter’s food tray. “Where is Healer Grisham?”
Draco’s mouth dropped. “He—heals...fast?” He blinked. “You mean to say he has an active immune system and healthy cell regeneration indicative of a healthy person in peak physical condition.”
“I think we should each take a wall to concentrate on while we cast it out.” She cocked an eyebrow and turned to Alicia. “Thoughts on the proper casting ritual?”
“Ergo...” Potter leans down and skirts his lips over the sensitive skin just below Draco’s jaw, right over his rapidly pounding pulse. The contact sends a surge of heat straight to Draco’s cock and he holds back a groan. When Potter lifts his head back up and meets Draco’s gaze, Draco can only make out a sliver of green around his pupils. Potter says, “I can’t think of a single reason we shouldn't be fucking. Can you?”
Draco almost sneered but closed his eyes instead and pretended he was speaking to a true invalid. “Did you hit your head?” he asked in as neutral of a tone as he could.
“How do you know how things were before? It’s never explicitly stated what type of friendship they had.”
He slowed down his stride after that and enjoyed the rest of his quiet stroll. He found amusement in the fact that Blaise was in fact pulling Draco out of his shell, little by little, even if he hadn’t meant to, exactly. He wondered if there had even been a raid that afternoon or if Blaise was simply pulling one over on him.
“I told you, they belong together.” Potter’s stare turns from wistful to compelling. He clenches his jaw and levels Draco with what feels like a challenge.
“If you’ll just drop it there,” the clerk pointed to an empty space near a corner. “I’ll sign for it.”
“You submit reports littered with factual errors, not to mention the new and fascinating spellings you seem to dream up with each new piece of paperwork.” Malfoy laughed, “It’s almost as if you
“The MagiConservationists charmed the lake to stay at a certain temperature year-round to protect the endangered fauna within.” Weasley turns around, wide-eyed, as Draco adds, “The water is charmed to stay very cold. Unless you know the counter—”
He locked his bedroom door and warded it so strongly that Narcissa couldn’t get in even if she burned the Manor to the ground. He slowly stripped out of his clothes and walked into his bathroom, opening the wall cabinet and looking for a Hangover Elixir. He pushed a few bottles aside and when his fingers brushed over an anti-inflammatory potion, he briefly thought about picking it up and taking it to Potter. The thought left him almost as soon as it had arrived, and Draco continued browsing his stores until he found what he was looking for.
“What did you smell,” Potter said. His eyes were bright and animated as he lifted the glass to his nose. “When you sniffed it?”
“No chance,” Pansy replied. “Wireless One is repeating that Viktor Krum interview.” The mention of Krum catapulted the two women into a fervent discussion of Eastern European accents which resulted in them both attempting to mimic noteworthy individuals’ voices.
On the other side, a shift in magic leaves Draco feeling electric. The forest is more vibrant, charged with something beautiful and simultaneously terrifying. Draco can feel it in his blood: Fae.
He arrived early, before seven, eager to settle in and get to work. The administrators set an introductory meeting for ten o’clock, giving Draco ample time to orient himself with the hospital. He walked the halls and spent his first few minutes at the main station in the Trauma Ward getting familiar with the current patients and procedures. Little differed from Notre Dame, with the exception of the Emergency Auror Receiving (E.A.R.) apparition point against the far wall of the waiting room. The French Aurors had their own hospital and team of Healers, but the Ministry used St Mungo’s for all its medical needs.
for interviews.” He stopped and let out a long sigh. “It’s been a nightmare. Half of my staff were being questioned most of the day.” Blaise eyed him and smiled. “Say, you look quite fit. You have a date or something?”
Draco walked around the bed and found Weasley standing over the newly repaired nightstand holding three small, clear glass vials. He handed them to Draco. They were Muggle medicine, containing all the standard jargon and labels consistent with names, dosages, and warnings which clearly identified them as morphine.
Spinnet could barely get her words out between laughs when Pansy tried her hand at it. “You sound—like—half your tongue’s gone numb!”
He pressed the glass between his lips and tilted it back, letting the dark purple liquid spill into his mouth. Draco watched him drink, as if transfixed, while Potter slowly swallowed, removed the glass, and licked his lower lip.
Malfoy’s hands flew forward, one gripping the back of Harry’s neck and the other pushing his chin up. “Tell me you want me to kiss you. Tell me you want my lips on you. Tell me you want this.” Malfoy was practically panting. “Tell me, and it will be yours.”
He grins at Draco. “You know,” Potter says as he leans forward and sets down his tea. “Muggles often use skin-to-skin contact to reverse hypothermia.”
Draco didn’t consider the looks, or the whispers, or the different ways it might prove harmful for him to return to the United Kingdom. He thought of his mother’s smile when they’d step through the double doors into the Manor and all that could be made right — perfect — if given the chance. Somewhere buried within him, he chanced a small hope, one that he’d never dared to acknowledge before the letter, that perhaps one day he might mend his fractured soul. Through his service, and dedication, and perfection, maybe he could find his redemption.
“It is,” Potter levels him with a stare, eyes green and bright in the shadows of the forest. He turns away. “You should see this,” he says, and motions for Draco to follow him.
Malfoy slowly took off his suit coat and folded it over the back of his chair. He started rolling up his sleeves as he walked over, staring down at Harry as he approached. “I think it’s time the Head Underwriter for Magical Pedantry taught the Head Auror a lesson in how to submit”—he smirked—“reports.”
“Holy fuck,” Draco almost screams at the contact. Potter’s cock brushes against his own aching erection, and he’s suddenly desperate for more. For anything. For everything. He clings to Potter’s shoulders and grinds his crotch down again, bathing in the vibrations against his chest as Potter stops kissing his scars to let out a long, deep moan.
“Not everything worth looking for is in a brochure,” Potter smiles back at him. “Sometimes...sometimes the things worth finding are buried in the rough.”
“You can start by untying me,” Harry said, schooling his features into something as neutral as possible as Malfoy stepped even closer to him.
He’s cut off when Draco grabs his hips and pulls him forward, taking him in to the hilt. But Potter doesn’t move, he just stares at Draco.
“How fortuitous!” Draco lifted his gaze in time to see Pansy Parkinson slide into the seat across from him. She was beaming with a cunning, delightful glee that immediately put Draco on edge. She smiled, “We were just talking about you.”
Draco held the gaze for longer than was comfortable and sighed. He grabbed the wineglass and slowly emptied the bottle into it, his mind full of all the various ways to savour and explore those things which are complex and worth understanding.
and prep him for surgery,” Draco breathed. He glanced around and met the nurse’s eyes. “Now!” He gulped and took a step back. “And get me a second Healer to assist. Someone from Spell Damage.”
“Blaise, Theo, Greg, Daphne,” she listed, “And we’ll probably meet up with a few others.” She smiled maniacally. “It’s Ladies Night at the Tricky Thestral.”
By the time he makes it outside, the others are gathering around the sleigh. Potter’s petting the thestral.
The others return close to dark and Draco distracts himself with the food preparations and getting the bonfire ready. Blaise is preoccupied with Longbottom and doesn’t pay Draco much attention. Weasley, Granger, and everyone else escapes to their rooms leaving Thomas and Finnigan to assist Draco with dinner.
“Sometimes I think if I had a redo,” Potter almost whispers, “There’s things I would go back and change.”
He knew the future could be something special, but as he sat down behind his desk, the day’s events came rushing back to him.
“Has it really been eleven years?” Harry asks. He finishes off his glass of wine and stands. Draco is unable to stop himself from cataloguing Harry’s form as he clears their finished plates and returns to the table.
“Since I decided to seduce a pureblood git.” Potter leans in and captures Draco’s lips. Draco thinks he should be numb to the heat of it, but it’s exquisite and intoxicating. Potter’s caught him in one swift action,  and all Draco wants is to get lost in it. He can’t figure out why it feels so perfect, being trapped by Potter’s arms, his lips, his entire being. Potter’s caged him in, and yet, Draco’s never felt freer. It’s all he’s ever wanted, and it’s only a kiss.
The first time Draco saw something new etched onto the features of The Boy Who Lived, it barely even registered. It was the momentous occasion when the man he’d grown up despising offered him a kind and level stare and seemingly forgave Draco his faults and his wrongs and proceeded to challenge anyone who dared do otherwise.
Draco closed his eyes. No one, not even Blaise, could get their hands on the potion that could knock out bloody dragons. Magizoologists and dragon tamers had to apply for special dispensations and grants just to acquire all the ingredients. Draco shook his head. “How did he get this?”
“I appreciate that,” Draco replied. He couldn’t stand the way her face seemed pained at the topic, and he knew that she blamed herself for causing him distress. “I’m not angry,” he offered. “I’m not upset with you and I don’t blame you for seeing him.” He closed his eyes and searched for more honest words inside him. “I don’t blame you for still loving him.”
“What?” Draco snapped. “How on earth would that—” But he stopped when he realised her words had struck a nerve, prodding at memories he didn’t dare touch with a twenty-foot dragon prod.
They made the trek up two flights of stairs to the third floor where they found the room destroyed. Draco observed over the overturned wardrobe, a broken bedside table, and the far window shattered on the ground.
“I may have a higher than average ability to handle certain social topics with poise,” he said, scrunching up his nose, “But I certainly
Pansy gave him a look of confusion. She eyed him speculatively then glanced at the dance floor and said, “He’s been on desk duty at the D.M.L.E. since you treated him.” She took a sip from her drink and raised an eyebrow. “Don’t you have something you can prescribe him to help with—” She flung her hand into the air and whirled it around, “
Blinking, Draco offered her a tentative smile and crossed the room to greet her. “Mother, I retrieved the jewellery boxes from the shoppe.” He stopped in front of her and leaned down to kiss her cheek. “I saw,” she smiled. “I wasn’t expecting you back so soon.” She eyed his casual attire. “You look quite handsome.”
“I am here to identify what he took so that I can administer a treatment plan that will not have negative interactions with the substance,” Draco explained. He pointed to the bathroom. “If you want to take advantage of this and get rid of some of these
He remembers Potter’s regret, his apologies—all sixteen of them. Some delivered over piles of study materials during eighth year, others slurred over drinks at the Leaky, and then there was the one late night Floo-call when Draco was back from Paris on holiday. Sometimes the thought of Potter’s regret only made Draco burn hotter, even if it was knowing he’d only been in Potter’s head as a mistake.
“With that, it looks like we are out of time,” Malfoy announced. “Thank you for your interesting questions. From everyone at the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, stay safe and if you see something, have your wand ready and take a closer—”
promptly spit it out gracelessly across the table. “Circe, Blaise, what the fuck!” Everyone laughed and Draco quickly cast a
Andromeda insisted Draco stay for lunch. He found himself plopped on a pillow on the floor of the sitting room drawing Quidditch moves in the air with his wand while Teddy looked on in awe. Potter sat on the couch with his broken Firebolt watching the two of them with keen interest, his broom mending kit forgotten to the side.
Draco turns to him and sighs. “Doesn’t matter, really. In the end, we’ll all be eating kebabs off the skewer, now won’t we?”
“Draco!” Pansy’s hand shot out from the table, her napkin dangling between her fingers. “You’ll get stains on your scrubs before you even start.”
Draco opens his mouth before he really thinks about what he’s saying. “I could think of a few things that would warm you up.” His eyes almost bulge out of their sockets when he realises how sultry his words sounded. “I mean—”
He helped Potter up and sat him at the kitchen table. Draco paced back and forth trying to decide what he should do or say. His mind was a flurry of stress, excitement, and shock, all combinations of the night’s events up until that point, and all
It’s the following year in mid-July when Draco receives the owl from Harry Potter asking if he’d be interested in the restoration of a few paintings.
After that, Draco saw Harry Potter a few times in passing, but could barely look him in the eyes. Draco had reached a point where he knew exactly what he would see behind those token spectacles, yet he wasn’t quite certain what could be gleaned from his own metallic stare. And his feelings, every day a bit more complicated, could not be revealed to anyone, let alone Harry Potter.
“I am not Orion,” Draco says. Without a thought, he reaches out and squeezes Potter’s shoulder before padding into the kitchen to prepare the bonfire dinner. It’s only after a few minutes of distraction that Draco realises what a comfortable show of affection he’d just bestowed on Potter.
The sound of even an innocuous command from Potter’s lips stirs Draco’s blood. For a moment he panics until he remembers how flushed his cheeks already are from the heat. He’s relieved but also mortified that Potter’s words caused such a reaction. Merlin, the slightest commanding tone from the man and Draco’s a blushing, aroused mess. Though, in all honesty, it’s really anything from Potter these days, and he’s turned to a blushing, aroused mess.
“You’re looking well,” Harry Potter had said to Draco at the punch table. Potter stood rigid and looked almost ill, pale and squinting at Draco in the sunlight. “At least, I mean, better than last time I saw you. Er—you know, at the trial?”
It hadn’t been half bad if he was honest. The show received mixed reviews. In fact, he revelled in the unexpected comments that congratulated the theme of accidental mishaps, going so far as to connect the daily faux-pas to much broader instances of one’s own undoing. Of course, Draco’s shock was replaced with mild contempt when he spotted the comments from show-attendee Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived had been there with friends, apparently, and when asked to give his thoughts on the works, merely stated,
Draco dismissed the intern and closed the chart, letting his arms fall to his sides. He fixed Potter with a serious look and tried to seem as considerate and neutral as possible. “What seems to be the issue?”
Draco tilted his head and walked straight back to his office. He gathered his things and went home without another thought. When he stepped out of the Floo, the only thing on his mind was a hot shower and the wish that he might find the strength not to wank himself raw thinking about things he shouldn’t even have knowledge of—things like desperate green eyes, powerful magic, and plush blue comforters on mahogany beds.
It still didn’t feel real as he put on his robes the next morning and examined himself in the mirror. He looked the same as he had in Paris; pale skin, tied back long blond hair, the mole on his cheek near his left ear, the white, raised skin peeking up over the collar of his robes — the start of a long series of unhealable scars. There were few things that left scars one couldn’t magic away later. Those marks on his chest and abdomen were mere physical representations of the shadows and trauma that would be with him for the rest of his life.
. Draco had been apprehensive about any wild and crazy plans Blaise might’ve made, but the first afternoon saw them ending up at the Leaky Cauldron where they proceeded to get pissed and reminisce over their early school days, Pansy’s antics, and silly and strange stories from Draco’s time in Paris.
He doesn’t recognise the potion brand, so he holds it up and reads the label aloud. “Hortwin’s Handy Happiness Handicraft Lubrica—”
, but on the fourth morning when he sees Potter descend the stairs and meet him in the kitchen in nothing but his pyjama bottoms and a messy case of bedhead, Draco nearly loses his mind.
A moment later, Blaise and Weasley stagger forward, a large bundle with wild, raven hair in their arms.
. But it wasn’t the sort of desperation Draco had fantasised about, it was a heartbreaking silent agony, followed by the frank statement,
“Yes, I work at the hospital full-time, I was just—” he paused to try and alleviate the coiled tension in his chest. There was no reason he should let himself feel like such a pariah. Draco took a deep breath and offered Weasley a conciliatory smile. “Blaise and I had plans this afternoon but due to the raid that occurred at a nearby shoppe, he became too engaged with affairs of business to leave. I offered to help.”
If he—a former Death Eater—can manage to graduate first in his class at the Paris School of Potions Mastery despite the derision of his classmates and bias of his instructors, then he can endure a few moments of physical contact with the subject of his unrequited sentiments.
Draco sighs when he realises the way the light and the colours of the room highlight the green in Harry’s eyes.
They stood holding each other until there were no more tears between them. When Narcissa pulled away from him, Draco offered her a smile. “I love you,” he said. “And I want you to know that I could never be angry with you for the love in your heart.”
October proved to be the busiest month yet for the Trauma Ward at St Mungo’s. Due to professional and intramural Quidditch overlapping, he saw all sorts of injuries from collisions to brain contusions to broom impalement. The weekend prior, the convention center at Diagon Alley had hosted an international Potioneering workshop, which ended with several individuals having seared something, severed something, or been exposed to some form of magical toxicity or poison. Needless to say, Draco had been kept on his toes for the better part of the month.
in it despite the Workplace Ethics and Training classes they’d been forced to attend after the last incident. Harry did not want to attend W.E.T. classes again, let alone with a man who took every opportunity to make innuendos throughout said mandatory classes.
“Use of silverware shouldn’t be how you measure civility,” Potter leans in. Draco can feel his warm breath against his cheek.
Pansy got up to get them all a round of drinks, and while Greg turned to Daphne, Theo and Blaise seemed to be in a heated discussion with the man underneath Theo that no one had bothered to introduce to Draco. With everyone else otherwise engaged, Draco’s attention wandered back to the dance floor. He absentmindedly stared out into the crowd until his eyes landed on Potter.
“Earth to Draco?” Pansy poked him. “This shirt...” she said and pushed a long-sleeved black button up to his chest. “...will kill.”
staring at them, so it didn’t matter either way. Malfoy sighed. “I cannot accept these at this time.”
Of course, he’d look his best when he wasn’t trying at all — barely conscious — and wearing next to nothing. Draco spends most of the morning doing figure sketches, quickly putting down the lines and curves and shading needed to capture that moment forever. He tells himself the practice is good for him, that he needs to pay better attention to muscle definition and the — ideal — human form. With the restoration forgotten, he loses half the day, and it’s a wonder that he gets any work done with
“There are many potions I could have administered.” He nervously licks his lips. “Too bad for international potionery laws and ingredient restrictions.” He turns the tables, “Why didn’t you speak up?”
“Hmm,” Draco nodded. He took one last look at the faded scar and then returned his attention to the open chest cavity.
“I’m kidding.” Potter sends him a warm smile. “Maybe I’ve…” His gaze drops to the bag abandoned at Draco’s side. “What have you got there?”
store put his nerves into overdrive. He tried not to let his imagination run wild with scenarios, and instead speculated what Blaise might have planned for them. They didn’t always end up at the Leaky; sometimes Blaise Apparated them to Quidditch matches or various other points of interest. On the last occasion, it was to Hogsmeade for the Autumn Sweets Festival. Draco had eaten so many different kinds of apple, pumpkin, and caramel concoctions that day that he’d felt sick for hours afterwards.
He grabbed the soap and started cleaning his body, his mind jumping to his later encounter with Potter, another instance where someone appeared where they shouldn’t have. Normal people saw Healers at offices or hospitals. Occasionally, healers made housecalls. No one was ever rude enough to presume it could go the other way around!
The contact seems to shock the other man and Potter startles back against the sofa. Draco watches the blanket around his shoulders slide off a few inches. He sees that a healthy color has returned to his skin and all Draco wants to do is to run his tongue over that collarbone and bite down.
“For the first time,” Harry continues “it looked like you had hope. Plus, you’d filled out a bit.” He takes a sip of wine and bats his eyes at Draco. “You looked rather fit.”
“I—” but Draco’s interrupted by a series of shouts from the other side of the fire. Weasley and Finnigan can’t decide if the meat is cooked through. Draco rolls his eyes and abandons Thomas and the flaming chess pieces to save the food.
. But on the rare occasion, his Mind Healer had insisted he use one, and for that, he could at least be grateful he was comfortable enough with the process to put his mind at ease now.
Opening the doors to Draco’s room, Spinnet and Pansy stepped inside and immediately cast a Shield Charm around themselves. Pansy turned and quickly shot a sealing ward on the doorway before heading to the far wall by Draco’s bed.
Potter offered him a wry smile and stood up. “Probably more times than you have.” He walked over to the counter, grabbed Draco’s wine glass, and downed the rest of its contents. “That’s very nice,” he said.
“Well,” Patil said, “I have thirteen hours to go, so I’ll be back for the next two check-ins. Will you be here?”
Draco laughed, “No, Potter, it’s a—you know what, just try it. Take it slow this time.” He handed the glass back to him. Their fingers brushed in the exchange and the contact sent a tingle up Draco’s arm. He had been warmed through from drinking before Potter even arrived, but one touch from the man had turned the blood in his veins to fire.
In an attempt to remain professional and retain all decorum, Draco smiled. “Articulate as ever, Mr Potter,” he said. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I’m the newly appointed Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward.” He walked up to the intern and grabbed the chart out of her hands. He flipped through the familiar pages casually. “And judging by your patient history, it seems safe to assume we’ll be seeing a lot of each other in the future.”
Between walking in on and Finnigan sucking Thomas off in the kitchen one morning, to seeing Potter bake brownies and make love to the batter spatula with his tongue, Draco’s cast at least six disillusionment spells on his crotch. He’s starting to think the spells are contributing to his arousal as he wanks in the shower to thoughts of Potter’s tongue licking the underside of his cock.
The next few weeks are exhausting as Draco adjusts to the rather unfortunate increase in contact with the man that he tries to tell himself isn’t actually that attractive. He reminds himself that it’s all business, a simple transaction and a favour to
“Where in Salazar’s name is Blaise?” Draco mutters. After another ten minutes pass, he joins Thomas and Finnigan and begrudgingly plays Fire Chess against Thomas.
Harry laughed. “I don’t know what to say.” He paused and then went back over Draco’s words in his head, trying not to think about the honest admission at the end of the list. “Wait,” Harry tilted his head, “Can you explain the Oxford comma to me?”
“That will be all,” Malfoy said. The door closed and Malfoy turned back to Harry. “Now then, where were we?” “As much as I’d like to stay,” Harry swallowed, “for the rest of—er—your instruction, I’m supposed to be leaving on vacation this afternoon.”
“They were about to have a row. I’d imagine,” Draco says, “They would’ve torn each other to shreds.”
After Potter’s admission at the springs that he’d enjoyed their previous conversation, Draco hopes their discussion will improve his mood—for the sake of the cookies.
The entire process was over before Draco could pick his jaw up off the floor. “Phew,” Pansy exhaled. She wiped her brow. “Thought that last one might get through.”
The assessment charm worked its way over the afflicted area in a fog of golden mist before clinging to Potter’s tanned leg, sinking beneath the skin.
Draco immediately recognised the desperation behind them. He’d seen it that night at Borgin and Burkes. The moment he made the connection, Potter’s head jerked to the doorway and his face shifted to something completely neutral. “Mrs Malfoy,” he smiled.
“I’m fine,” Draco replies. He tilts his head and decides to ask Potter how he knew about the veil. “It wasn’t in the brochure,” Draco adds.
Malfoy stared at him for a long time before he casually walked to the door, opened it, and called out, “Cancel the rest of my appointments for the rest of the week.”
At first, he didn’t want to go to the feast, but at the urging of his mind healer and his mother, he’d attended. The first year, it wasn’t as bad as he’d expected, at least, hardly anyone noticed him. Everyone seemed distracted — haunted even — as if their eyes weren’t focused on the present but instead the events of the past.
Draco shook his head. “I don’t know. I’m not here every night, and I don’t spend much time there apart from when I sleep.” He thought about some of his sleepless nights, of waking up drenched in sweat and full of an unexplainable anxiety. It wasn’t like that every time he slept there, but enough times to make him wary of an outside force. “I wouldn’t say it’s constant,” he added.
Narcissa Malfoy has always been a proud and protective wife and mother, but her view of herself seemed to expand after the war. She set an example for Draco in so many ways, but first and foremost in the acts of reconciliation and forgiveness. With the foundations of blood purity all but demolished, what remained was simply blood — family — and the memories that bound them all to each other.
She shook her head and grinned, turned on her heel and walked away. “See you tomorrow,” she called back before Apparating.
Malfoy stopped circling, leaned down, and firmly grabbed Harry’s chin. “If you put even a fifth of the effort into your reports as you did your body, Potter…”
Blaise smirks over his shoulder. “Come now, you wouldn’t let Harry Potter die on your watch.” He rushes out and leaves Draco hovering over Potter, dumbfounded and, frankly, more than a bit aroused.
Potter stopped and stared at the open bottle of wine and the takeaway, leaning over to inspect the open food container. “By yourself tonight?”
“Why is it so unbelievable, Potter? That people want to hear the juiciest crime news from the Saviour himself?” Malfoy pursed those perfect lips and Harry had to turn away to collect himself.
“Maybe later,” Malfoy said, pulling away and spitting down where his hand was jerking Harry off. “You’re so desperate for it, you wouldn’t last anyway, Potter.”
“Healer-in-Charge Malfoy.” Blaise pulled up a third chair from another table and sat between them. “Congrats, mate. How long have you been back?” He turned to Pansy and grinned, “The man’s got a talent for eluding us.”
His mother set the pitcher down and approached him. “What is it?” He stayed silent and she grabbed his face. “Tell me.”
Draco doesn’t mean to stay in the kitchen working, but he’d been talking to Granger about some new potion laws and had to jot down his ideas. He’d promised himself he’d stay away from work, but the concepts were quite thrilling and, after all, he did have his glass of wine to finish. He takes a sip and then completes his final thoughts.
He offers him another wide smile and Draco blinks. “No,” Harry says, “but Teddy likes to talk about the peacocks. Narcissa keeps him entertained with lots of stories.”
Draco stood in the hallway with bated breath as nothing but silence came from the patient’s room. He decided now was as good a time as any to go in, what with the kneazle out of the bag. He pressed the palms of his hands over the front of his robes and took the first step through the doorway.
As it was a Friday and they were understaffed, Draco picked up a double-rotation and barely had time to eat until well after eight in the evening. It seemed the closer it got to Halloween, the gorier some of the injuries became. He’d reattached a foot and pulled out an entire set of antique silverware from a man’s back before noon. The cases only became more ridiculous as the day went on. So when the Healer-in-Charge of Orthopedics asked him to assist on a hip repair and regrowth, he jumped at the chance to get away from the madness.
“He said he needed to catch up with the others,” Blaise explains. “I take it you were too distracted to notice? Accio Joggers!” The whirl swooshes down the hall and a pair of dark blue joggers fly into the room. Blaise catches them and tosses them to a stupified Draco. He can’t quite wrap his head around the fact that Potter’s best friend left. For what? Scenic views and a well-assembled prosciutto and cheese plate? Draco would know, he put the picnic basket together.
For the first time since she’d arrived, Alicia turned to Draco and addressed him. “Do you think this is a remnant of the Dark Lord’s magic use? Or could it potentially be a build-up of lesser Dark magic users’ power?”
of fresh linen fragrance. Next, Weasley cast mending charms on the torn pillows, restuffing them and placing them up against the mahogany headboard. Judging by the way he arranged the pillows, leaving a lumpy white one on the right side, Draco wondered if it wasn’t the first time Weasley had to clean up Potter’s bedroom.
He also realised how fucking exhausted he looked. Even in the flashing lights and moving shadows cast on the dance floor, Draco could make out the dark circles under Potter’s eyes.
It had almost been three months since Draco’s first day as Healer-in-Charge of the Trauma Ward. He would love to say that it had been easy, that all his years of hard work and sacrifice had given way to a smooth transition into the elevated position. But it had been hell. He would never say those words aloud, knowing full well things could always get worse. However, he could admit that around every corner, if there was something that could go awry, chances are it did.
He’s saved the trouble when Harry says, “I’m sorry, I just realised the time. I can’t believe I’ve kept you this long, it’s nearly midnight.”
. Saying I love you and hearing it returned, at the kitchen sink in passing and breathlessly in the throes of making love. Draco shakes his head again. “He doesn’t feel the same way.”
Surely, he can leave him alone for a few moments? Draco rises and makes for the hallway, intent on a change of clothes. He doesn’t wait another moment and pulls the jumper over his head, relishing in the relief as his bare skin breathes in the open air of the cabin. He takes one more glance at Potter asleep on the sofa and then heads down the hall.
Potter lifts his hand to Draco’s cheek and gently strokes it. The touch is tender and Draco aches. His heart flips and his cock twitches.
Draco eyes Finnigan with suspicion, cautious not react. “Serving spoon,” he answers and turns to Weasley. “Plates, utensils...for those civilised enough to use them.”
Draco had learned early in his internship the differences between accidental injuries and injuries of intent. Accidental injuries were easiest to fix once identified, and more often than not, left very few traces behind. But injuries of intent were far more complex and entangled with the fabric of an individual’s magic. Premeditated injuries, Draco learned, sliced and bruised and aimed to leave a mark, and that sort of intention was powerful, oftentimes, and in his case, too powerful to erase.
All at once he felt overjoyed, humiliated, unsteady, righteous and smug. It had taken a few brief moments for him to conclude that it was indeed not a joke or mistake, but an actual, honest to Merlin offer for the position of a lifetime.
“Yes, well…” Draco trails off, unable to formulate a coherent thought after the image of his bare skin against Potter’s flashes in his mind. His cock twitches and crosses his legs.
Rushing to the platform with his wand ready, Draco didn’t register the face of the patient, just the sheer amount of blood gushing from the man’s chest wounds.
Draco whines at the loss. He thinks he’s almost the point where he can’t take it anymore. “Fuck, Harry, okay. Harry. Please.”
“Even you can’t jump headfirst into an enchanted lake without repercussions.” He smiles at him, and his eyes travel down Potter’s body. Draco remembers that Potter needs clothes. He turns to tell Blaise as much, but his gaze falls to Potter’s naked lower body. Draco shudders and his mouth drops open involuntarily. Potter’s muscular legs are perfectly sculpted masterpieces and the treasure that sits between them…
Potter nods. He leans forward and grabs the other cup of tea on the table and hands it to Draco. Their fingers touch and Draco almost drops the cup. “Oh,” he quickly throws his other hand forward to hold the bottom and accidentally caresses Potter’s wrist.
Draco sighs. He and Lovegood had voted for Greece, but the Gryffindors and Blaise had overruled them. Leave it to those fools to forego any sort of research about their destination. Draco’s sure from the expression on Weasley’s face he only looked at the pictures.
“Really?” He dropped his gaze to the ground and grabbed the ribbon. “Between Gryffindor and Hufflepuff?”
“I—” Draco can’t think. He can’t even remember what he said. He presses a hand to his erection and groans. “I’ll call you whatever you want, I just need you back inside me.”
a night terror, he would’ve woken up by now. There is an underlying condition causing this.” He turned to the intern. “Mr Masker, get him admitted and transferred to a private room. I want a full array of elixirs on hand. And get someone from Hematology to come take his blood sample. Run a full spectrum.” He paused and eyed Potter’s face. He thought about his tolerance for pain and his ability to heal faster than normal. “And have them start a
Narcissa nodded as she sliced a loaf of bread and began buttering the sides before tossing them in the pan to crisp up.
It may have started from a place of malice, but the more Draco painted, the more he understood the other man. And that’s when understanding turned to something a bit more inconvenient.
“Nah,” Teddy scrunched his nose. “I don’t like yellow! Plus I want to go on adventures and be brave and strong like Harry!”
He leans back and grasps Potter’s thighs for support as he lifts his hips only to slide back down again. Potter’s fingers sink into Draco’s legs as he watches Draco fuck himself on his cock. Draco feels his stare, feels the kindling of desire between them. He glances down and sees Potter watching Draco’s cock as it bounces against his stomach.
With that thought, he meditated for a few minutes to clear his head of any lingering emotions, to orient his mind to be clinical and completely professional. When he was ready, Draco wrote an exhaustive Post-Op report, sparing no detail, if only to remind himself that he had truly been methodical and vigilant in the O.R.. He had been perfect.
Draco glanced at the swollen leg and dropped the jacket back over it. “Aunt Andi, why don’t you take Teddy back to the house. I can handle it from here.”
“For…” Blaise bit his lip for a moment. “I can’t even count how many things.” “Come on, Blaise!” Draco insisted, “I can
He wanted to settle into his office, but he opted to sit at the Trauma Station for a few hours to better reinforce the system and continue to familiarise himself with the patients. He took a seat and crossed his legs, flipping through charts and making notations in his personal logbook. He was eyeing a patient presenting with unpredictable finger elongation when a series of pops from the Emergency Auror Receiving (E.A.R.) startled him.
“You’ve done this before,” Draco said as he turned and walked over to the wardrobe. He cast a silent
Draco stares at him, a surge of fear rippling through him. It’s one plunge, he thinks. Once off the cliff and then the fall will overtake him. “I’m yours,” Draco decides. “I want anything you see fit to give me.”
Draco clenched his jaw, feeling the silent doubt and underlying concern that lingered behind Weasley’s question. Healers didn’t just go around prodding at people’s magic, and Draco hadn’t ordered the test lightly. He couldn’t decide if Weasley and Granger were generally unsettled because of the nature of the test or if they were suspicious because he had been the one to order it. Draco calmly collected himself and stated, “We won’t get that test back until morning.”
Harry comes, jerking his hips and writhing under him, grasping Draco’s shoulders in a bruising grip. When Draco slowly unwraps his fingers from Harry’s softening erection, Harry lifts a hand and caresses the edge of Draco’s jaw.
He performed the ritual to remove the memory and stared at the fluid mercury substance in the Pensieve’s basin. Had Lucius used it daily, picking out details and possibilities for ventures or illicit plans? Had he removed anything, permanently? Draco always assumed Lucius had done monstrous things, but when he’d grown up with him, he never imagined the father of his childhood had been a monster, a torturer, a killer. But Lucius had done things that Draco could never understand.
Harry bit his lip as Malfoy nosed at his neck, breath warm against his skin, the heat of which distracted Harry from Malfoy’s errant touches at his sides.
The night passes in hushed confessions and tentative touches that turn into loud moans and the rough press of their bodies together. At one point, Draco presses his fingers against Harry’s chest, remembering how cold and pale his skin had been the day he fell in the lake. He’s flushed and panting as Draco jerks him off and holds him down. When his eyes glance up and meet Harry’s, he can’t help the words that tumble out of his mouth.
Potter grabs his hips and pulls him onto the bed. He pushes Draco’s legs and makes him straddle his lap so that Draco’s looking down at him. Hands trace the planes of Draco’s back, mapping him out while a tongue dips forward and licks across his collarbone. Draco balances his arms over Potter’s shoulders, carding his fingers through his soft, untamed hair thinking he could get off with just Potter’s mouth on his skin. He’s relishing in the wet sensations of it when Potter digs his fingers into Draco’s hips and pushes them down to meet his own.
The night before, he’d run his fingers over the embroidery on his robes. He laid them out, pristine and perfect, just like him. He had never had any doubts about becoming a healer. His mother had always told him he had all the token traits of a good one — a great one — and the profession would suit him. He soon found that his cunning, his stubbornness and his determination pushed him past the ranks of his peers. When he was faced with a problem, with something to fix, Draco wouldn’t stop until it was perfect.
Draco couldn’t be sure how long he slept before an incessant rattling against one of his windows roused him from his slumber.
As soon as the door closed, Malfoy pressed himself against Harry’s back, wrapping his hands around him. They trailed over Harry’s chest and came to rest on the edges of his cloak before he peeled the fabric back and over Harry’s shoulders, tossing it haphazardly to the side.
“Mind the stasis spells!” Draco calls out as he settles in on the couch and sips his red wine. The fire still blazes strong, and the overwhelming heat embraces him again. He looks around for his book. That’s when he sees it: Potter’s toiletries bag open and sitting on the side table, the lubricant bottle sticking straight up for all to notice.
“What a tosser,” Weasley laughed. A moment of shared amusement passed between them and a weight was lifted off Draco’s shoulders. “Well,” Weasley said, “I suppose I should thank you for bringing that over then.” He scratched his neck and looked away. “And probably for fixing Harry up so well back in June.” He lowered his voice. “And making him rest up for those weeks. You know, he doesn’t get enough time off. I try to tell him to take a vacation but…”
“This better be bloody important,” he said aloud as he grabbed the hastily sealed parchment and ripped it open.
“I am,” Draco nodded, and without really thinking said, “but the nightmares right now are—” Once he caught himself, he stopped, and stared down at the floor.
By four in the morning, the energy elixir Draco had taken was wearing off and his exhaustion began showing itself in the form of sore muscles, aching feet, and an unidentifiable weight of anxiety in his chest. His rotation was scheduled to end in two hours but he couldn’t leave until he’d at least put a treatment plan in place for Potter. He welcomed the scenario where he could leave without having to speak with him.
Draco huffed, “Pfft. That is not how I would’ve described it.” He turned to her and added, “Thank you, though.”
He rolled his eyes and vanished the parchment, heading back to the kitchen with a smile on his face.
“We found him thrashing around his room,” Weasley said. “He’s injured himself but he won’t wake up.”
“A rose,” Harry leans in, “is a rose is a rose is a rose.” He’s inches from Draco’s face and gazing at him as if Draco is worthy, and precious, and
Of course, as soon as Blaise found out, he’d jumped at the chance to steal Draco away for a few afternoons a month of what he called
“You all have a real problem,” he slurred, clearly heavily inebriated, “with being attracted to Gryffindors! Dun you?”
He wallows in shame and when everything’s finished, he decides not to wait for Harry to get home. He can think of no reason — no apparent need — to see Harry’s reactions and hear his praises directed toward Draco’s handiwork. Near the Floo, Draco leaves a concise and professional parting note, but can’t seem to stop himself from signing it;
And only after they crowded around the body, after IV blood had been administered, after Draco and Patil stopped the bleeding, after the patient’s heart rate and blood pressure stabilised and Draco could perform the tube thoracostomy, after the sizzled and scorched skin began to knit itself back together, after the minutes turned to hours, only
“Will you two please take your foreplay into a bedroom,” he begs. “And for Merlin’s sake—for all our sakes—please cast a Silencing Charm.”
Blaise scowled and pointed to the stack of books on Draco’s nightstand. “Who comes on vacation to read?”
Draco knew he was quite capable of handling far worse injuries and yet he couldn’t shake the faint remnants of his earlier panic as he shut the door to his office. The sparsely decorated room had a desk, three chairs, an empty bookcase, and a large window with cream-coloured curtains. While it wasn’t much, it held the potential to be at the foundation of his success. He’d hold meetings, write papers, perhaps even unwind with a finger of Odgen’s after a long rotation. His imagination worked out different ways he could make it his own, and he allowed himself to contemplate the amount of time he might be at St Mungo’s.
In the instant between when Potter’s lips downturned into a frown and then formed his blunt question, Draco decided to take a page from Patil’s book. If they could be brutally honest, why couldn’t he?
?” she asked, her voice teetering on the edge of anger. “You don’t have his consent to poke around in his magic!”
As it turned out the Tricky Thestral was a full-scale nightclub. Draco hadn’t been prepared for the sensory overstimulation of loud music, flashing lights, and clouds of various perfumes and colognes mixed with sweat. He observed the crowds on the large dancefloor, eyeing a few people he thought he recognised.
He gave them the tour through the West Wing and explained some of the abhorrent things he’d managed to remove when he and his mother had first moved back. Pansy seemed impressed but Spinnet merely gave Draco a blank expression. Once they reached the double doors to his bedroom, Pansy stopped him from going inside.
The truth was something Draco didn’t want to hear, but Salazar knows, it was what he’d needed. It was truth he sought with every stroke of his brush, and truth that he yearned for when he decided that one day their roles would be reversed. One day it would be Harry Potter on the spot, and Draco would have him on trial for the things that he’d done and he would show the world — and show Harry —
Draco gave him a large, genuine smile, and Blaise changed the subject to Quidditch while they waited in the queue.
He changed the subject to the review of their patient’s chart and the Post-Op check-in they needed to complete. Once he stepped into the patient’s room and started the assessment, a switch turned on inside him and the disquiet within fell away. Draco was able to go about his job with ease, his mind clear of any and all distractions.
They Apparated to a pavement on a posh street lined with large townhomes. Draco glanced around; he figured they were somewhere in London, perhaps Islington. Weasley took a step toward the homes and the two in front of them began rocking, separating from each other and shifting apart to reveal a third townhome between them.
When they got back to the booth, Theo had vacated his spot on top of the unnamed man and was sitting on his own having an animated conversation with Pansy. Draco considered Theo for a moment, idly allowing himself to wonder if the rumours he’d heard a few years back were true. Was he still working with Lucius? Were they close? Was his father in Britain? He suddenly had so many questions and he didn’t particularly like the curiosity springing up inside him.
With both his elbows on the table, Theo said, “The cocks lining up on the dance floor beg to differ.”
He realises quickly that Harry had been sincere in his initial letter when he’d said he valued and respected Draco’s skills. Once Harry had left him alone on the first day of the project, Draco had taken several walkthroughs of the home for the sole — hand to Salazar — purpose of inspecting the installations of his paintings. He was impressed with the positioning of
His mind immediately flashed to Potter, and while Draco attempted to push those unsettling thoughts from his mind, he said distractedly, “I saw Ronald Weasley today.”
Blaise pushes Weasley aside. “We have to get him out of these wet clothes.” He bends over and unfastens Potter’s boots. “Draco?”
in his desk. By the time he made it to the Trauma Station, the analysis of Muggle substances had come back, and both he and Masker put forth a simple treatment plan to detoxify Potter’s system and keep him sedated and stable. When Draco signed the bottom of the chart, Masker raised a brow. “And the
“You should write a paper,” Patil had commented as they got lunch in the cantina. “Brag about how great you are.”
“Ron, don’t talk with your mouth full,” Granger interrupts. She offers Draco a slight smile and then goes back to casting fire charms.
Potter blinks, his gaze falling from Draco’s eyes to his lips, to his chest, where his stare lingers on Draco’s Sectumsempra scars. When Draco looks at those scars in the mirror it’s always made him feel a rush of twisted pleasure, the idea that he was marked permanently by Potter. It shouldn’t send a spark of arousal to his cock, but the sight of Potter’s gaze on his own handiwork turns Draco on.
By the time the bloodwork came through, Draco considered himself refreshed and ready to handle whatever the night might throw at him. Yet when he stood at the Trauma Station, the results in hand, he was utterly bewildered and suddenly deeply, deeply concerned.
Potter smiles. “I was awake the entire time. At least, I think I was. I remember most of it.” Draco stares at his lips as he takes a long sip of tea. Potter eyes him curiously. “Come and sit. Have some tea with me.”
Patil’s silverware clanked against her plate and her head jerked up, craning to the side to follow Draco’s line of sight.
He can feel Potter smile against his thigh just as the hand lets his cock fall back against his belly. It feels like ages before Potter’s tongue presses against the base of Draco’s cock and licks up the underside of the shaft.
Draco couldn’t be certain who the others were; he wasn’t familiar with Ministry employees. But there was no mistaking
Malfoy smirked. “The state of their clothes? Why, I’d never seen pirates wearing designer threads straight from this season’s runways in Milan.”
“No?” Weasley said, his voice unsure. He stepped into the room and grabbed the bottle out of Draco’s hands and let what was left in the bottle swirl, revealing its contents to be a thick, silvery opalescent liquid. “Is that…?”
Draco sobbed as he came, and after a few moments, the water washed away the evidence of his fantasy. He wished he could erase the tacit decision that he was going to help Potter in any way that he could, starting with helping keep the demons away. He pushed aside the obvious realisation that—as both a Healer and Draco bloody Malfoy—sent him reeling...he unequivocally wanted to fuck Potter senseless.
“Healer Malfoy,” Potter managed to say through gritted teeth, his expression pained. Potter’s gaze fell to Draco’s neck, and he realised his scars weren’t as hidden by the t-shirt he wore.
Draco smiled. “I enjoyed being a Seeker. But I think for all the wrong reasons. My father wanted me to play that position.”
Harry unbuttoned his uniform robes and settled in on the barstool. It was a Friday evening and the Leaky was packed. Harry had stayed late at work rewriting his last six reports for H.U.M.P. and by the time he and Ron made it to the pub, their usual booth was taken. Harry adjusted his position on the barstool and sighed into his pint. “It’s Malfoy’s stupid lips—I mean his smirk. I see him every time I go to write my expenditure reports!”
“You’re having nightmares again?” Blaise furrowed his brows and grabbed Draco’s shoulder. “What about your stash of the special Dreamless?”
If he’s going to do this, he wants to see it. He wants to see Potter’s face when he tells him everything he has to say.
Sighing, Potter replied, “I was out on a...personal errand...and I may have dislocated my shoulder.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “How high up were you when you fell?” He dropped his bag and knelt beside him, unrolling the jacket that had been placed over Potter’s lower right leg. His blue jeans had been cut open revealing a swollen, rapidly bruising shin with a slight bulge on the inner upper calf.
Draco refills his tea and sits beside the window. The midday light reflects off the snow blanketing the ground, giving the illusion of a warm and airy day. But Draco knows better. He knows the wind howls through the forest, its icy chill inescapable in the open air. Why the others would want to traipse around out there eludes him. He’s content to experience the winter splendor from behind a thick window, with a warm cup of tea in hand, and a good book.
Draco scoffs. “I haven’t been waiting for anything, Blaise. You don’t wait for something you know is never going to happen.”
Draco held up a large green bottle with small script engraved down the side that had caught his attention. He needed someone else to confirm that it was in fact what he thought it was. “Do you know what this is?” he said through gritted teeth. He read the inscription aloud. “
He followed her not half a minute later and regarded the operating room staff bustling around finishing their preparations and readying the patient for surgery. Harry Potter—the patient—lay prone on the operating table, the stasis spell fading over the wounds in his thoracic region. Draco briefly recalled the dozen appearances of
“Fuck,” Harry cursed, teetering on the edge of his orgasm. Malfoy sped up the motion of his hand and began whispering filthy things in Harry’s ear.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d applied a Trimming Charm. He thoughtlessly raised his right hand and ran his fingers through the soft hair before reaching for the green ribbon at the nape of his neck and pulling it loose.
When he finally made it to the shoppe, he took a deep breath and calmly walked inside. It was just as he’d remembered, but he didn’t waste any time looking around. Draco headed straight to the counter, rang the bell, and waited to be helped.
Draco is simultaneously comforted and terrified by the ease at which Blaise suggests he sleep with Potter. It must show on his face because Blaise grips his shoulders and flashes him a stern look.
Two days later, the blood bank ran out of O-positive and the shortage caused him issues and delays, forcing him to get creative with a patient’s surgical plan. He’d consulted a few medical papers but found little to assist him. For one of the first times in his career, the established texts had failed him. He had to rely on his own skill and ingenuity. Once again, he’d found himself standing in Pre-Op, a bundle of nerves and uncertainty. It reminded him of his first day. It reminded Draco of
“Hmm.” Potter closed his eyes and tilted the glass back, stopping before the liquid neared the edge. He swiped his nose over it a few times. With his eyes still closed, he licked his lips. “Berries,” he said, “And...something floral.”
Draco leans in and examines the painting. It was from his first public show all those years before, one of the more complicated scenes he’d done of a man placing a bowl on a countertop, not realising it will fall. Draco’s eyes fill with tears as he takes in the simple, elegant frame, as he traces his fingers over the gold plaque at the bottom.
But he couldn’t spout off unproven theories and he certainly wouldn’t openly divulge patient information, even to his best friend, even within the walls of his house, even standing in his bedroom. Draco had the beginning of a theory taking shape in the back of his mind: it all went pack to Padma Patil’s words during their first Post-Op check-in.
Potter stands and rushes to Draco, clutching his face in his hands and crushing their lips together. The pressure is too much, and the heat is searing, but Draco thinks if Harry Potter is fire then all he wants to do is burn. His hands wander down Potter’s sides, lingering over the dip in his hips. When Potter breaks the kiss and leans down to bite Draco’s ear, Draco’s fingers dig into the fabric of Potter’s pants, pulling him against Draco with such force it almost knocks him over.
Draco sighed, her words mirroring some of his past feelings. “You don’t have to explain yourself to me.”
When Draco stepped over the orange daylilies, he saw Andromeda standing over someone laid out on the ground and Teddy planted right next to her, unharmed.
Draco grips the joggers and turns back to Potter. His serene features are paler than usual, his cheeks lacking in their normal lively color. Draco resolves to get Potter clothed and averts his eyes as he shuffles to the other end of the sofa. After casting a Warming Charm on the joggers, Draco attempts to pull them up over Potter’s legs.
“This is incredible,” Thomas whispers as he kneels down beside them. Draco’s unable to tear his eyes away as he silently nods in agreement.
They stumble out of the kitchen and make for the hallway, but Potter can’t keep his hands off Draco’s waist. He doesn’t even realise he’s pushed Potter against the hallway wall and threaded his fingers into his hair until Potter’s moaning while Draco pulls his hair and ravages his tan, exposed throat.  The sounds he’s making go straight to Draco’s cock, and a pleasurable chill races up his spine.
He nodded and grabbed his tea, downing the rest of it in an attempt to chase her words away before he let them resonate on a deeper level than the trials and tribulations of the Manor’s squirrel population.
“Yes!” Blaise grinned. He turned to Pansy and raised his eyebrows suggestively. “What about you and your obsession with that hack in Sports and Gaming? Cormac McLaggin?”
It’s a flurry of thank yous and the gathering of his cloak and his messenger bag and Draco rushes to get to the Floo and avoids meeting Harry’s eyes. But Harry is there every step of the way, an annoyingly attentive and charming host — is there a limit to things that man is good at? — to Draco’s utter dismay.
“Weasley,” Draco returned, he quickly formulated a suitable explanation for having been there. “Blaise Zabini asked me to deliver a pallet to you.”
His surprise quickly becomes excitement as Draco returns to the sofa and dives into a heated discussion with Potter. They talk about the genius twists of each book, the dysfunctional past of the main character, and the bitter dispute with his old friend that haunts him through the entire series.
The dancing continues as the songs change. People mingle and talk, and Draco ends up watching from his seat, appreciating the happy sounds of laughter and love. He’s only had a handful of moments like this since the end of the war, and he wants to catalogue and savor it.
The conversation turns back to the plot of the book for a few minutes until Granger comes in and invites them to join her on an afternoon stroll.
Draco’s mouth drops and his gaze falls to the table. He’s sure his heart is about to leap out of his chest. He’s trying to come up with a reply, anything, something, maybe a taunt about Harry’s eyesight, but his mind and body and soul seem to be at odds deciding what the proper reply should be.
Something happened to Malfoy when he rolled his chair up to the mic and carefully slid the earphones over his head; a sort of weight seemed to fall from his shoulders and give way to an odd gleam that shone in his eyes; when he leaned forward and said, “Hello citizens of Britain, it’s your favourite heroic duo,” his voice carried a deeper timbre that sent shockwaves up Harry’s spine. It also sent a few sizzling electric currents of arousal elsewhere as well.
Harry groaned when Malfoy tugged up the hem of his jumper, hands exploring the bare skin underneath. “What’s that?”
Harry blinks. “Uncomfortable?” His mouth falls open and he briefly shakes his head. “This is...overwhelming. I can’t believe you’d spend this much time...on me. That you would…” He breaks their gaze and looks back over the collection of sketches and paintings.
Draco quickly sobered up at the realisation that the man had reset his shoulder on the first try, which rarely happened unless it had been dislocated before.
Blaise rolled his eyes. “You’re being dramatic. Besides, they’ll be so thankful for the goods they wouldn’t care if it was the Dark Lord himself dropping off the parcels.”
Masker huffed and walked out, slamming the door behind him. Draco understood the appeal. It was, first and foremost, an interesting case, but it was also Harry Potter. A small part of Draco wished he’d never have to deal with Potter, but a growing part of him had warmed up to the idea of it, of getting satisfaction from it. He pushed that realisation away and broke the charmed seal on the results envelope.
Curious about the amount of Ministry traffic the Trauma Ward processed, Draco grabbed the previous month’s E.A.R. log and decided to grab a cup of coffee. He had hours before his meeting with the administrators and without privileges, there wasn’t much he could do apart from idling about and look around. After all, Draco Malfoy certainly had to adhere to the rules and regulations for
After the broadcast was over, they stood and stretched, and Harry buzzed with the thrill of the aftershow high.
He ran the shower as hot as it would go and stepped inside, the burn of the water a sweet relief from the ache of all that he was feeling and couldn’t face. He bit his lip to stop himself from cursing as he thought about Lucius having dinner with his mother, about how the moment of seeing his father again had been decided for him by some ridiculous coincidence. Draco was the one who was supposed to grant that first meeting.
He makes his way back to the great room and takes a tentative glance at the sofa. Potter’s awake and sitting up, cradling a cup of tea in his hands. Draco lingers in the hallway. He licks his lips, clutches the toiletries bag to his chest, and takes a step into the room. Potter’s green eyes flicker to his and the intensity captured in them is the hottest heat source in the room.
came back first. Masker dropped it on Draco’s desk personally and waited silently in his office for a discussion of the results. Draco stared at him. “Yes?”
“It’s not so bad,” Potter laughs, but Draco hears the tick. It’s fake, like half the laughs Potter offers the dull and useless worshipers that try to get his attention.
!” the man’s eyes gleamed. He smiled with a bit of bashful pride. “I managed to finish that this morning! Oh, apologies, I’m Caractacus Burke, Jr.”
Blue eyes narrowed and bore into his. “I see,” Weasley said slowly. After a brief pause, he started chuckling. “Let me guess, Zabini put you up to coming here?”
as the light managed to draw attention to it no matter where one sat in the room. But even more so, Draco was pleasantly surprised by the small gold plaques that adorned the center of the frames on both his works.
Luckily for Draco, the sun was just setting and the streets seemed to be emptying as people went home or ventured into restaurants to eat. He figured it was as good a time as any to dash into Borgin and Burkes without being seen. He wasn’t doing anything wrong by setting foot into Knockturn Alley, but he couldn’t avoid feeling as if he were two steps away from being accused of breaking the law.
Draco makes his way past the sitting room, down the hallway toward his room and studio. He’s in a hurry and finds the items quickly, not noticing the bouquet of a few dozen red roses set down on his desk until he’s turned to leave.
He fell asleep thinking of friends, squirrels, and the unending list of reckless things people might do for the ones that they love.
Potter stands in the entry to the hallway wearing a thick knitted jumper, a healthy color restored to his cheeks.
Not five minutes after Pansy had sent off her Patronus, Alicia Spinnet stepped through the main Floo and scowled. “This better be important,” she said. “I was
“You put him in charge,” Weasley says. He stands next to Draco and offers him a warmed butter roll. Draco declines and Weasley immediately raises it to his mouth and takes a large bite. “When you and ‘arry—”
Potter swims away from Draco and lifts himself out of the pool. Draco tries to avert his eyes but can’t seem to tear them away from Potter’s arse until he casts a drying charm and bends over to pick up his pants. Draco looks away, blushing, and gets out of the hot springs. They remain silent as they dress and Draco makes sure to take as long as humanly possible so he can be alone to cast the Disillusionment Charm on his trousers.
“I am not interested in hiking to a scenic overlook and freezing my bollocks off.” Draco got up and helped Blaise button his coat. “When you get to the top, Apparate back here and get me.”
But for whatever reason, Draco couldn’t take his eyes off of him. His hips were mesmerising, their rhythm with the music such that Potter seemed free and lost in the melody—consumed by it. Draco followed the planes of his body, from his hips to his sides to his taut arms pressed against the man opposite him. The cotton v-neck he was wearing left little to the imagination, not that Draco had to imagine the body beneath. But seeing it on the O.R. table and seeing Potter like this were two vastly different things. In the current setting, Draco had taken down the barrier of propriety he normally kept raised to keep his authority and professionalism intact in regard to patients. Staring at Potter, as he threw his head back and closed his eyes, his face free from burden, Draco realised how completely and utterly beautiful the man was.
“No,” Draco shook his head. The bloodwork had clearly shown traces of what could only be Muggle substances. “We’re looking for Muggle drugs. Let’s keep at it.”
Harry stares at him for a long time in silence and Draco wonders if he said something wrong. But then Harry pulls another light grey swatch from the pile and holds it up, smiling. “I think...this one! It reminds me of your eyes. It’s a bit silvery, and with the carpet, it would give us Slytherin colours which are in keeping with the Black aesthetic...right?”
“You can’t be anything other than what you are,” Harry whispers and kisses Draco softly. “And that’s the man that I love.”
Harry offers him a coy smile. “Because there’s no mistaking,” Harry takes a step toward him, “what two dozen red roses mean.”
Draco rolls his eyes and walks into the cabin, happy that Blaise can manage to bed not one, but two Gryffindors in a matter of days. He’d be satisfied with the one, really. If only such things were possible.
The door jingled with a bell and a few patrons turned their heads to glance at him. A moment later, a handful of individuals, all wearing bright orange aprons, turned and shouted in unison, “Welcome to Weasleys Wizard Wheezes where wholly wobbles, wares, and wishes are wrapped up and waiting for you!”
“Quidditch accident,” he replied. He couldn’t tell her it had been an England National Team player, due to Healer-Patient confidentiality, or that he wasn’t certain if they’d ever regain complete function of their legs again. He just assured her, “They should make it through just fine.”
“Hmm,” Malfoy hummed, narrowing his eyes and pushing his lips together into a thin line (Harry was definitely
looking at his lips again). “Well we can start with the use of such inappropriate language,” Malfoy explained.
She pressed on with the conversation despite his silence. “You know, we all have issues with our parents.”
for doing what was necessary to serve the interests of the patient. He’d never cared about their feelings. He cared about solving their problems—about saving their lives.
He was standing at the bar drinking an obnoxiously fruity alcoholic beverage, eyeing the shimmer and shine of the wizarding world elite, waiting expectantly to see who might bid on one of his paintings. It had taken some years, but his work had gathered a following and gained acclaim from several rather ancient and haughty art critics. While Draco knew himself well enough to know what motivated him to paint, and although his truth was all he really needed, he constantly struggled with the reality of how nice it felt to receive such glowing approval from those whose mere words could elevate or destroy him. That kind of transaction, the sort of coveted notoriety that dictated people’s careers — and in some cases, their very lives — left a bitter taste in his mouth. It all reminded him a little too much of certain things from his past.
When Draco regained his composure, it was nearly seven in the morning. He gathered his thoughts, and locked the results of Potter’s
results, Draco distracted himself by checking in on his other patients and updating their charts. The Trauma Ward had quieted for the evening but as Saturday turned into early Sunday, the typical array of weekend cases would undoubtedly crowd the waiting room.
Weasley pressed his lips together in a firm line before glancing off to the side. “Alright,” he said. “Let me let ‘Mione know what’s going on and I’ll take you.”
Malfoy pulled a pocket watch from his well-fitted waistcoat. “It’s six-thirty-nine in the morning, Head Auror Potter, and I have an appointment at six-forty.”
She never summoned Spinnet to the Manor again, but she continued to work diligently with Draco a few times a week well into August.
“That’s Lee’s job,” Pansy teased. She let out a short laugh and then turned to Draco. “Will you lead the way?”
“Fuck, fuck,” Draco repeats, unable to form a single coherent thought as Potter’s tongue breaches him. “Fuck,” he moans.
, and the other half is begging Draco to be rational about how much Potter may have had to drink, or how much it might hurt him seeing everyone else paired off for the majority of the trip. Or tripled off, if you’re Blaise.
He finished up his duties and changed into casual grey robes and a lightweight black cloak. Draco turned to check his appearance in the slender mirror he’d hung on the wall near his desk, and the reflection startled him.
Draco paused as an odd feeling crept its way into his chest. He pushed the feeling aside and pointed to Potter. “Before you go to bed, you need to ice your shoulder and take an anti-inflammatory potion.” He shook his head, and kept pushing whatever was twisting inside him away, adding, “And don’t ever come here expecting medical treatment again.”
“Clear up my…” Harry trailed off as his eyes bolted to Malfoy’s similarly empty desktop. “Bugger me.”
They bundle up and put their boots on, meeting Granger, Weasley, and Thomas in front of the cabin. Draco follows behind Thomas as the group wanders toward the densely forested area of the valley. The sun is bright and the glittery white snow reflects its brilliance all around them, illuminating the even shadier parts of the forest floor.
Patil’s words bothered Draco, but he found himself distracted with more pressing things. Potter’s vitals were strong and he had come through surgery remarkably well for the injuries he’d sustained. But he showed signs of malnutrition and exhaustion; he weighed less than he should, he had patches of hair loss around the sides of his face, and the dark circles under his eyes were too pronounced to have been a result of his recent trauma. Draco considered the patient’s recent history and if it was possible he’d been working himself too hard.
Draco narrowed his eyes and replied to Blaise, “There’s nothing on this earth that can help that man.”
“I wish it were under better circumstances,” Luna said. “But I must ask you for the truth about the Pentacle Pirates.”
It took a few visits before he told Pansy about his bedroom. The first time she set foot in it, she immediately went into a coughing fit and walked back out into the hallway.
“Oh,” Pansy batted at his arm. “It’s not just for women and straights. It’s a midweek singles night.” She nudged him. “When’s the last time you had sex?”
The entire conversation had stirred up too many warring feelings inside him. Draco desperately craved having someone in his bed to satiate his physical desires. While he felt no shame in using his own hands or something from his stash of charmed toys, nothing replaced the warmth of someone else’s body, their breath hot against his skin, or all the other incalculable and exclusive sensations that only another person could supply. He’d had fuck buddies in France, a few that lasted longer than a year, but nothing serious ever presented itself to him. He wasn’t sure he would’ve considered it even if it had.
Draco woke up three hours early and stared at the ceiling. He stared at the white plaster until his eyes hurt. He was riddled with a nagging, unsettling feeling; it had been a long time since he’d felt quite so uneasy and it was almost a foreign, new experience. It had to be that he was back in the house,
“Why the fuck not?” Harry burst out, his wide, enraged eyes darting up to Malfoy’s relaxed grey gaze.
Potter raises his hand and splashes a bit of water toward Draco. “I didn’t want to make a fuss. Besides, I’m sure it’s all in my head.” He smiles, and the warmth in his eyes triggers a familiar ache in Draco’s chest.
He finished writing and threw his quill down on his desk. “The Auror Department’s yearly expenditures are of the utmost importance, Potter.” He licked his lips and eyed Harry from head to toe. “It is my duty to make sure you’ve thoroughly completed them to the letter of the law.”
But sometimes, when he crawled into his king-sized bed alone on particularly late nights, he absently wondered if there would ever be someone on the other side waiting for him, someone to comfort him and ease his worries. Those types of thoughts were fleeting, and Draco was always quick to remind himself of his own self-sufficiency. He wouldn’t acknowledge that it might be an old, underlying fear that drove him to his self-isolation. But the radical change in his life had shaken the foundations of his desires. He had never allowed himself to hope for a return to England. And yet here he was. He wouldn’t have dared to dream that there would be someone among his peers who might be able to forgive the mistakes of his past. But then there was Padma Patil, brutal and honest, yet respectful; she was turning out to be someone whose company he enjoyed, someone he trusted. Alicia Spinnet had been civil towards him, and the depth of her partnership with Pansy was proof that Slytherins on the wrong side of the war could be accepted by Gryffindors, appreciated, cherished even. And then there was Harry Potter.
It wasn’t as if he hadn’t been expecting it—his mother seeing Lucius. The man was the love of her life. Draco could never fault her for wanting to go to him. He’d suspected she likely had on a few occasions when parts of her stories hadn’t matched up over the years. Just like him, Narcissa had been through Hell and back. She could and should do whatever she wanted, and he knew she would as long as it didn’t hurt Draco.
to wake up early and come in for his 6:30 a.m. meeting about funds related to the Browder-Ivanovich case.
“I’m going to wrap my lips around that thick cock and tease you until you’re on the edge,” Malfoy said. “I’m going to lick my way inside you and have you pliant under me, just begging for me to fuck you senseless.” Malfoy pulled back and looked Harry in the eyes. “I’m going to fuck you so long and so hard that you won’t even know your own name,” he said. “Only mine.”
...and Draco appreciated Blaise’s joke, but Potter didn’t need an oratorical potion. The man needed actual help. He briefly considered getting up and going over to him, but suddenly Ronald Weasley appeared and dragged Potter away from the group, taking him in the direction of the exit.
Draco shook himself from the memory and immediately readied his Patronus with a message to Patil. Looking over his desk, he gathered any immediate paperwork and brought it with him to the Trauma Station, where he stayed busy until Potter’s room was set up and ready.
She set a cup on his desk and sat in one of the extra chairs, taking a slow sip from the other coffee. Picking up the cup, Draco eyed her. “It’s not poisoned, is it?”
Potter—the patient—made it through the gruelling nine-hour surgery with no complications, and at least Draco had
His temperature was slightly elevated, but not quite feverish. He showed signs of heavy perspiration in his greasy hair and the pile of his soiled clothes on the side table, but almost felt cold to the touch when Draco put his hand to Potter’s forehead. He took a quick study of his breathing and felt confident his lungs and heart were healthy.
Draco took the slight trace of malice in her voice and the glint of hatred in her stare and turned it over in his gut. He let it overwhelm him and make his insides sour, until all his nervous energy, all his pride, and his entire sense of self was gone. He waited until all that was left in his mind was the procedure for draining blood from within the pleural cavity, the patchwork of wounds on the faceless patient, and the puzzle of what exactly had wreaked so much havoc on the man’s body. When he raised his eyes to return her stare, all he saw was a Spell Damage Healer.
Draco crossed his arms and frowned. “Yes, well I very well can’t brew that now can I? What with the key ingredient being illegal. I wouldn’t dare attempt it here where there are likely eyes watching my every move.”
The two women devolved into playful bickering until eventually Spinnet, realising the late hour, excused herself to the Floo.
She smiled and they began walking toward the Apparition Point. “That could not have been easy,” she said. “Was that the first time you’d seen him?”
should sufficiently keep a patient anaesthetised for hours. He glanced over the chart and baulked at the last surgery listed eleven days prior:
Standing up straight, Draco focused his attention back on the assessment. “You know, they say Healers have to cultivate a good bedside manner, but no one ever discusses how completely rude and abhorrent patients can be.”
Blaise grinned. “There he is. That’s the bastard I remember.” Draco rolled his eyes and softly shook his head from side to side in feigned contempt. Blaise held his stare for a few moments and his brows furrowed up in mild concern. “It isn’t the work that worries me, though. Should you —” He paused as if realising he needed to choose his next words wisely. “—be rushing into the job before getting settled?”
Draco finishes himself off in record time and dresses quickly. He’s out the door and about to call out for Blaise when he almost runs smack into a thestral at the steps of the cabin. “What—”
She snorted. “Well,” she patted his back and started forward. “Good thing I had them throw in a bottle of that wine for you.” Draco’s head snapped up and when he met her eyes, she laughed. “Trust me.
“Hmmph,” Spinnet smiled at Pansy, quite pleased with herself for the reaction she’d gotten from Draco. “If it’s the Dark Lord’s handiwork, we’ll have to use a Patronus Deductio.”
He started to speak, but the remnants of Potter’s exhaustion overtook him again and he had to pause for over a minute to steady himself. “As soon as the bloodwork comes back,” he said.
“Don’t bother,” Harry mutters. He turns pushes past them and heads to his bedroom at the end of the hall.
house in Draco’s mind. He catalogues the collection of keys, glasses, packs of gum and quills that Harry keeps on a tray by the Floo and grows to appreciate the mess of paperwork and open texts spread out on the formal dining room table. When he asks Harry why he doesn’t use the rather large, ornately carved desk in the study, he gets waved away.
It was as if everything had come back full circle. He’d returned to Britain, restored the Manor, and reestablished himself in Wizarding society.
Draco turns around and eyes the room. Potter’s luggage is shoved in the corner on a chair, his trousers lie discarded on the floor between the door and bed, and he’s sitting up on the mattress. Draco can’t see his face in the darkness. He pulls out his wand and lights the bedside lamp.
Draco feels compelled to elaborate. “I have a spectacular job, wonderful friends, and thankfully another six vacation days I can use to bugger off to Greece and forget all about this horrendous snowcasm.”
stare. Potter’s eyes were in fact as green as Draco remembered, and they narrowed on him as Potter frowned. “What the hell are you doing here?”
Draco stares after him feeling as if he’s just been hit with a Stupify. He’s not sure how much time passes before Blaise grabs his arm and nudges him into his bedroom.
“Perfect.” Draco leans over to Blaise and whispers, “We’re here undressing the Savior, and Weasley’s got his wand ready to set this entire place on fire.”
He moans and starts to buck his hips, matching every one of Draco’s movements with more force than before. The shockwaves hit him; Draco knows he’s close. So close. He brings Potters hand to his cock and nods his head. With fingers covered in Draco’s slick, Potter wraps his hand around Draco’s cock and starts pumping.
Harry licked his lips. He knew he was about to step into a trap. He didn’t care, he realised suddenly, because any trap that started with Malfoy’s lips was worth diving headfirst into.
“No,” Blaise said. “It would take too long to explain it all, but thanks for offering, mate.” An owl flew in through an open window by the back door, tossed a rolled-up parchment at Blaise, screeched at him, then flew back outside. “Fuck,” he muttered as he stared at the unopened letter. “That’s their fourth reminder today.”
“Cold,” he says through rattling teeth. His hand finds Draco’s and brings it back to rest atop his chest.
Separately, on Thursday and Sunday evenings, Pansy would stay over and offer assistance clearing Dark magic. Part of Draco’s added stress was his inability to sleep well, which he believed to be caused by several different errant spells and curses that lingered in his bedroom. In France, he’d used an altered version of the Dreamless Sleep potion of his own formula on occasion. He’d found it to be stronger and more dependable, a guaranteed good night’s rest. But he was wary of brewing it again having just resettled in Britain, where one of the key ingredients was illegal.
“Is that...Theo Nott?” Draco asked. The last Draco had heard, his father had been working closely with Theo on a lucrative private project. Just hearing the name left him feeling a bit sour.
He doesn’t even bother knocking. He opens Potter’s door, turns and closes it slowly, laying his palm against the door as it softly wedges into the frame. He’s desperately trying to manage his breathing, but Draco can’t seem to catch his breath.
“Honestly, temperature charms are the first thing you learn.” He pushes Weasley out of the way. That’s when Draco sees that Potter has stolen a spot near the edge of grill, smiling at Finnigan and Weasley, he’s shaking his head. When his eyes meet Draco’s across the smoky scene, Potter slowly lifts a bottle of butterbeer to his lips and offers him a sultry look.
He’s been back in his own studio for two days and the absence of green eyes and Earl Grey first thing in the morning has left Draco feeling listless and empty. He’s somehow become conditioned to seeing Harry’s smile, and hearing his voice, and feeling as if he could possibly have belonged somewhere in the other man’s routine. He thought he might receive a note from Harry in response to the project’s completion, but to his unadmitted disappointment, there has been none.
Potter nods. “Orion is trying to ignore Phaeden, but he can’t help himself. When he sees him struggling with the moral dilemma of the case, Orion has to reach out.” Potter raises a brow. “That scene in the train compartment...always felt incomplete to me. If they hadn’t been interrupted, what would have happened?”
And it’s some minutes after that—as he skewers the kebabs—that he thinks maybe Potter meant to compare Draco to Orion during their discussion.
But their paths rarely crossed at the Remembrance Day feasts after the first one. Draco was thankful for that. As memories of the loss and the violence faded, people’s eyes were steadily more focused present. All the feasts following the first commemoration, Draco had a distinct feeling — from stares to scowls to outright curses — that his memories and his experiences were best left remembered within the confines of his own mind.
mandated by the Chief of Healers who’d given an evaluation of Draco to the Board of Directors on the last day of summer.
Draco’s morning passed in a blur as he met with the administrative board and then introduced himself to his Trauma Ward staff. He skipped lunch and opted to keep familiarising himself with the current trauma patients by walking the Ward and questioning the staff.
“Malfoy.” The tall redhead nodded. His face remained unreadable and Draco thought his jaw might be clenched but couldn’t tell for sure due to his bushy, auburn beard.
“I wanted you to fix my shoulder,” Potter explained. “But since you’re unwilling, would you kindly move out of my way?”
“I mean, he catches my mistakes,” Harry explained. “It started when I had just become Head Auror. He would point out all my errors and even tell me to use different forms because the ones I’d submitted didn’t actually ask for what I needed.” Harry bit his lip. “But then I started to think about him every time I filled out a request and I made even more mistakes. He started to get a bit…” He tried not to picture Malfoy’s self-satisfied smirk. “…smug…after that.”
The door to the room swings open and Ginevra storms in. Draco’s eyes bulge and he thinks it’s finally happening. This is the end, the dream has become a nightmare and he’s about to wake up.
Weasley seemed to snap out of his thoughts and nodded. “Right. Well, I guess I’ll see you around.” He walked away and positioned himself behind the counter close enough to bark orders at some of the staff.
The switchboard operator gave them a thumbs up, so Harry started, “Hello and thank you for calling in this afternoon. What’s your name?”
The skin around Malfoy’s eyes wrinkled as he gazed between their mics and stared at Harry, a look layered in amusement and hunger. “Harry and I have much to divulge, but I would be remiss not to start with this week’s biggest news.”
Draco sits clutching his wine, trying not laugh as Weasley attempts to out boogie Thomas to the Weird Sisters.
“You two look like you’ve got it covered,” he says and raises his wand to the fireplace. “I’ll get the fire nice and hot with some Kindling Charms.”
“This too,” Potter tugs at Draco’s jumper. They both pull it over his head and hold it between them for a moment. Potter stares at him. “Will you let me touch you?” He pulls the jumper out of Draco’s grasp and tosses it to the side. “Will you let me make you feel good, Draco?”
The man stepped forward and smiled. “Malfoy, there you are,” he said, his chest heaving up and down in quick breaths. “It’s great to see you.”
The tension pulls at every nerve in his body as everything tightens, waiting for that final moment that would bring him over the edge. “Potter,” he whines, “please.”
He mutters the lube spell again followed by a protection charm. “You said I could do whatever I wanted,” he gazes at Draco hopefully, “Is this okay?”
But to Draco’s dismay, such moments of sadness were chased away with the immediate and surprising levities of simple moments. He’d quickly done the softer ink sketch of Christmas morning with big broad strokes; he drew the figures of himself and Teddy in their pyjamas, all smiles and playfulness while his mother and aunt looked on with cheery fondness and warmth. The moment plastered itself into his mind and heart as he catalogued the ease of his mother’s countenance, the cadence of Teddy’s laugh, and the light in Andromeda’s eyes.
Two hours later, they’re all gathered around the fire listening to the wireless and sharing stories from their jobs. Finnigan finishes telling the story of a man who asked him to cast a magnifying charm on the crotch of a pair of trousers from the shop, and Draco can’t help but laugh.
“Blaise,” Draco clears his throat and tears his gaze away from Potter’s—even when cold—well-endowed cock. It’s practically a plea when he asks, “Please fetch him some fresh clothes? And Weasley, make yourself useful and bring us some tea.”
“Blaise is busy right now,” Ginevra frowns. Draco realises she’s completely naked and blushes. She points to both of them on the bed. “But we—all of us in this cabin—would appreciate it if you could cast a Silencing Charm as soon as I leave the room.” She shakes her head and turns around. “I swear to—” she slams the door.
The sheets straightened out and rolled up to the headboard, the plush dark blue comforter not far behind, before tucking themselves under the sides of the mattress and giving off a
“We didn’t talk about anything important,” Draco lies, his mind reliving each and every moment the two of them were naked together.
“No.” Draco looked away. “I will not see you. I will not acknowledge you. I will not speak with you until
“Excellent.” Malfoy proceeded to help the next caller uncover the secret history of an ancient mythical burial ground in their home’s garden. “Have you tried questioning the gnomes?”
Draco glared at him. “Don’t worry, Pansy,” he said and turned his head to lock eyes with her. “These scrubs are spelled to repel liquids. But your concern is appreciated.”
He didn’t have the strength to tell her he hadn’t found a Mind Healer in Britain yet. With all the things he had to do between the move, the new job, the settling in, finding a suitable Mind Healer had completely been forgotten.
.” His father now stood on the other side of the nearby table with hands clutching the back of the empty chair.
Getting the waist of the joggers up to the base of Potter’ crotch is a quite a task when he’s not looking, but Draco’s sure if he sees that cock again he’ll pass out. Give it to Potter to have a thick prick, and fuck—Draco was thinking about it again.
“You saved enough. How many places do you think you could be at once? It was a war, Potter. The lives lost aren’t your responsibility.” Draco doesn’t say the blame falls to the Dark Lord, to the people who pledged service to him and carried out atrocities in his name. He doesn’t say he’s the one who should bear the breadth of the guilt between them.
Draco hadn’t known how much he’d needed it until he found himself looking forward to their afternoons together. It had been a rare occurrence for him to glance at the clock during his shifts back in France; he could only recall doing so for things like his mother’s birthday or the rare occasions when he’d had plans to fuck someone when he left the hospital.
He knew her. He knew that face. The dark eyes boring into him were questioning but held the distinct slant of familiarity and disdain.
“You’ll want this room to be used,” he says. He thinks of all the history and emptiness that fills Malfoy Manor and pictures all the rooms that stay vacant and covered in drop cloths, unable to imagine a time when they would ever be used again. Draco wonders why he’d never thought to restore his family home, and then it hits him. “You’ll want it to be lived in,” he says, “By you, by Teddy, and...the people you choose to make a life with.”
“One can never be too thorough,” Malfoy smiled. He started trailing kisses over the sensitive skin of Harry’s neck.
Patil clicked her tongue and removed a clamp. “With this one,” she pointed, “it’s almost like he does it on purpose.”
Draco starts to think about it as Potter’s hands come up and cup his cheeks. “Don’t think about it too much. You want me, I want you. What else is there to it?”
Draco nodded. “It was a spinal reconstruction, and we had a tough spot of it with the spinal fusion. The patient’s vitals kept tanking.”
He bit his lip and dropped his gaze to the floor. He didn’t have the energy left to try and hide it from her. “I wanted to make my version of Dreamless Sleep.” He sighed, “For Harry Potter.”
want?” Malfoy leaned down, his mouth suddenly inches from Harry’s. “Or would you like to finally find out what it feels like?”
He poured himself a finger of Ogden’s and downed it immediately, lowering his hand so violently the glass nearly broke on the table. The sound of it sent a jolt of recognition through him.
“Orion is a fool,” Draco shakes his head. “He refuses to see things from Phaeden’s point of view. It’s his undoing.”
“It’s the perfect size for that space over the mantle in the upstairs sitting room,” Harry Potter said to Neville Longbottom as he approached the auction claims desk at the end of the event.
When breakfast was ready, they both ate slowly and sat in silence. Draco enjoyed eating in the morning at the small table in the kitchen, the view from which overlooked the old pond on the side of the Manor. With the new day’s sun beginning to creep over the older trees, the life of the estate started to come alive. He watched the ducks with interest but found himself constantly distracted by the squirrels’ antics. There was one grey squirrel in particular he found quite amusing; it would often run up to its counterparts, smack them, and then dash away and up a nearby tree. Half of the squirrel’s tail was missing and Draco always imagined it had lost it in some cavalier or audacious showing.
and everything possible to elevate their family, to redeem them in the eyes of that psychopath; he’d shown Draco that how the Malfoys were seen, how they were put down in the history books,
Potter appeared more intoxicated with every step he took toward a booth on the middle platform. At one point, he was holding on to the man next to him and just staring off at the ground, his face slack and his eyes wholly dark and empty. He looked almost...
He chastised himself for being so nervous. He heard Blaise’s voice in his head and reminded himself that he was being ridiculous. Of course the shoppe owners wanted their goods, they had a bloody business to run. A business which, Draco noted, had been open for more than a decade and was thriving. They wouldn’t do anything to jeopardise that. Draco would be fine. The most he might get was a bruised ego.
“Well, just last week,” Pansy explained. “Alicia and I were getting treated for a Snivelling Hex and the paperwork to get back into the field was longer than the N.E.W.T.s!”
“That could be arranged,” Malfoy strode into the office, a devious smirk plastered across his face. Harry frowned. “Potter, let’s go.”
And as love stories go, this one isn’t too extraordinary, but Harry Potter — luckily — knows how much Draco Malfoy loves him.
“During your first Post-Op check, I did notice how remarkably well your injuries were progressing,” Draco said. “And your vitals were very strong, better than expected.” He turned back to Potter and smiled. “If, say, over the course of the next few days, things continue improving, I may readjust my recommendation in your discharge papers.”
They make their way up a slight hill to a large cluster of old trees. Potter leads Draco up to the top of a rocky incline, with a fallen tree bridging the gap over a ravine.
Smirking, Malfoy crossed his arms and licked his lips. Harry’s eyes followed the movement, glossing over as Malfoy’s efforts left his lips wet and pink. “We should depart,” that perfect mouth said. Harry blinked. “We wouldn’t want to keep our avid listeners waiting.”
When he reached the entrance to the shoppe, he didn’t even take a second look. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.
“I know that!” she said, flustered. “It’s your first day and I don’t want you to—well, we’re probably going to be working together a lot, and I wouldn’t want us to get a shoddy start.”
Malfoy smirked. “Any yearly report longer than ten pages is required to have a table of contents.” He approached Harry and trailed a slow, teasing caress down the side of his neck. “Shall I start with the introduction?”
He concentrated on finishing the reports, eyeing his packed bags in the corner of his office. He had no idea what he would do with no itinerary or plans for four whole days, but as the minutes passed, he found himself getting more and more excited at the thought.
“Clearly,” Blaise crosses his arms, “He’s gone for you as well judging by the fact that despite all your oblivious rejections of his quite obvious advances, he keeps trying. I knew Gryffindors were stubborn but I can’t believe he hasn’t given up by now.  I mean fuck Draco, he must be getting desperate, he had Ron throw him into an enchanted lake just to have an excuse to be alone with you.”
They finished their coffees while Draco put the final touches on the Post-Op report. They chatted more about the state of the hospital refreshments and pastries as they headed to complete the routine Post-Op check on the patient.
Draco can’t think. He can barely breathe. Potter steps closer and all Draco can do is stare at his lips, curled in an upward, predatory grin. Potter’s eyes fall, traveling down the length of Draco’s body, and he can’t help but shiver.
Blaise rolled his eyes. They walked into the cabin’s great room. “You know we can’t Apparate in Norway.”
Draco tilted his head, unsure of where Potter was going with this. “That is standard for the injuries and trauma you went through.”
“Okay!” Draco throws up his hands. “I’m just taken aback by this. Blaise this is—there’s so much built up between us, and the things I’ve imagined! For fuck’s sake, I haven’t wanked to anyone but him in years.”
The memory of Potter standing in his kitchen sent a rush of adrenaline through him, and Draco bolted up and out of his office toward Potter’s room. Nothing had changed in his absence and he offered up his silent thanks that he didn’t have to talk to Potter just yet. He wasn’t sure what he would say. As his Healer, he only had questions. As his—as a person with their history and shared relations, he couldn’t put into words what he wanted to express: bitterness, jealousy, frustration, desire, obsession,
Draco decided to try the bathroom and stepped over a pile of brightly coloured knitted jumpers before shuffling over a collection of shoes. He had to tiptoe around various piles of dirty clothes and towels to get to the counter. Atop the marble sat dozens of glass bottles, some empty and toppled over, others full to the brim of various elixirs and potions some of which he recognised by sight. There were anti-inflammatory potions, Skele-Gro, hangover cures, energy elixirs, Draught of Living Death, and—
Potter shakes his head. “Not lives—I mean—yes, I would try to save my—but I meant—” He stares at Draco like he’s dissecting him, piece by piece, pulling the parts of him away that he’d built up to hide the darker, troubled things that had always weighed him down. “I just meant, I might have done things differently. Especially with us.”
“You’re so fucking beautiful,” he says and meets Draco’s eyes. Potter’s flushed, biting his lips, eyeing Draco with awe as if he’s some sort of divine being. “I want you to come all over me, Draco. I want—”
He and Patil worked methodically in silence for several more minutes before she took a step back and stretched her arms. “I have no idea why you seemed so stressed earlier,” she said. “It seems to me you could’ve performed this procedure in your sleep.”
Weasley cleared his throat. “Check the bathroom. Maybe the bedside table.” He pointed at what remained of the nightstand. “Or what’s left of it.”
Draco settled into his favourite armchair in the study, sitting back and sipping a glass of firewhisky. It was his first Wednesday off in weeks, and he had the Manor to himself. Narcissa was visiting a friend in France, Blaise was doing Merlin knew what, and Pansy was supposedly on assignment in Ireland.
“Bit paranoid, that,” Blaise rolled his eyes. He bit his lip and a thoughtful look came over him. “And you’re sure regular Dreamless won’t help?”
art show because surely he went to all sorts of events all over town. But something churns in Draco’s chest when he thinks about the other paintings, the reverence Harry seems to have for Draco’s work, and the way he’d said,
He reads for half an hour, spellbound by the intriguing mystery at his fingertips. With each new readthrough, Draco notices subtle details he’d missed the previous times. But his eyes grow tired of the text, and his gaze wanders from the pages to the treeline outside where a blur of movement catches his eye.
The night went on with a few more rounds of drinks and topics that kept the focus away from Draco. The group mostly spoke on the subjects related to their jobs, which gave Pansy and Theo ample time to complain about Curse-breaking and unnecessary bureaucracy.
Once in his room, he rummages through his luggage to find something more suitable for the blistering heat of the main room. He settles on a thin, dark green henley. When he goes to the bathroom to splash some water on his face, he doesn’t expect to see flushed cheeks and swollen lips in the mirror. He can understand the rosy complexion, the heat in the other room is almost unbearable. But his lips? Had he been biting them and not even noticed? He shakes his head.
Pansy snorted and patted him on the back. “No, Draco,” she grinned, “she really means it.” She blinked and stood a bit taller. “You let a qualified professional do the job that you couldn’t. It’s alright. Just admit it.”
Spinnet put her hand up and tried to catch her breath. “Nothing was getting through our wards,” she managed. After a few deep breaths, she turned to Draco. “And thank you.”
“I’m not going to ask you to do that for me,” Draco replied. He knew Blaise dipped into illegal imports with his business, and that he managed to get away with practically everything he did.
Blaise storms off and joins the others as they discuss how they’re going to divide the five hot springs enclosures between them. Draco notices Potter lagging behind and briefly thinks he might be waiting for him. But that would be ridiculous.
“Oh yeah,” Potter nodded. Draco eyed the state of him, from his wet hair clinging to his cheeks to the clothes plastered skintight down his body. Potter chuckled, “I—uh, some help maybe?”
Greg leaned forward and smiled at Draco. “How is the hospital, by the way?” Draco offered him a smile, thankful for the subject change. “It’s going well,” he said in a raised voice so it carried over the music. “As well as can be expected, what with it being
Blaise shrugged. “With any luck, maybe none of them will be there and some lowly part-time worker will receive the delivery.”
Draco mulls over the letter for half a day before attempting to draft a reply. He’s intrigued by the invitation to help restore the Black ancestral home and simultaneously mortified that accepting Harry Potter’s request would mean their interactions would increase exponentially. It’s all settled, however, when against his better judgment, he finishes off a bottle of wine and dares to send the succinct reply of
Draco stood off to the side and watched them with interest. At first, it amused him to see Pansy interacting with Spinnet; he’d never anticipated the pair of them getting on so well. But after a few moments, the howling and the laughter made him ache for the days when he’d had friends like that, times when he’d laughed so hard tears streamed from his eyes, the days when someone would drop everything they were doing in an instant to come to him when he called.
Draco wanted his control back. He wanted control of his emotions, control of his life, control of his—desire. He braced himself against the tile and imagined a scenario where he had all of Harry Potter’s strength and recklessness and willpower beneath him, at his mercy, conquered. Draco had all the control, and those green eyes stared back at him, desperate for whatever he dared give. He came with a shout, so loud it echoed against the tile and rang in his ears before his vision whited out and he got lost in the release. When Draco came back to himself, he was on the floor of the shower, cold, empty, and alone.
arousal — and while there was definitely a path to kink exploration there, instead he followed the deepest yearnings of his heart. It took quite a long time to figure out what those yearnings were. He had a few drunken nights, more than a few pub brawls and skirmishes, and several dozen hours with a mind healer before he could admit what exactly those yearnings were.
He followed her cue and Apparated to the Manor’s foyer, kicking off his shoes and heading straight for the kitchen and the corkscrew.
Potter’s features had furrowed and his mouth was agape, as if in pain. “Is something wrong?” Draco immediately asked and glanced at his shoulder.
It took five minutes for Draco to change out of his scrubs and into casual robes, gather the needed materials for potential evidence collection, and meet Weasley at the Non-Medical Apparition Point in the lobby.
“I can take care of myself,” Draco replied. He pinched at the hem of his long-sleeve undershirt and then forced his hands in his lap. He knew exactly where Blaise’s mind had gone. His old friend was thinking of how Draco would be treated because of his past, his crimes, his family. “If St Mungo’s had a problem with me,” Draco said, “I wouldn’t have been offered the position in the first place. Rest assured, there isn’t a single thing I haven’t considered or anticipated.”
“Well,” she started slowly, “I’m sort of trying to picture you as someone else?” Patil raised her shoulders in compunction and grimaced. “Otherwise I may break my oath of
“Tell me how it feels,” Draco demands. He’s careful to watch every muscle of Potter’s face as Draco slowly tilts his hips and starts grinding on his cock. Potter’s eyes unfocus, his mouth falls open, and that’s all the invitation Draco needs. He wraps his legs around Potter’s waist and flips them over, so he’s straddling him once again. The change of angle pushes Potter’s cock deeper and Draco leans forward and steadies himself on Potter’s chest.
“Your report recommends two weeks of bed rest and three additional weeks of rest and rehabilitation.” Potter’s jaw clenched.
“What is the purpose of having gorgeous long hair if you won’t let anyone see you with it down?” she pouted as they walked to the foyer.
“They knew I was in good hands,” Potter smiles. “Is that the third Phaeden Blanchfarx? I love that one.”
“I wish they’d given you more time,” his mother had said over Sunday afternoon tea. “Monday is so soon. And you will be working those long shifts. I’ll hardly see you.” She pursed her lips and glanced away, her eyes drifting toward the East Wing. “There are things I would rather not…”
He’s clutching the sheets and tearing up the bed, writhing in something he’d never describe as pleasure, but instead blissful agony. He’s desperate for it but knows he’ll never get enough; it’s a teasing dance when Potter’s lips suck and his tongue slides in and out of him. When Potter pauses to spit in his hand, Draco thinks he might die from the loss of his tongue, but then he buries his face in Draco’s arse again, only this time his hand reaches up and starts stroking his achingly hard cock.
Draco gulped and nodded. He didn’t look at Potter again as he followed his aunt out of the room and into the study. She offered him a quick smile before explaining the various things she’d found in some boxes in her garage. “Old memories,” she said, handing him a stack of scrapbooks. “I think your mother will enjoy them.”
,” Malfoy whispered, and then suddenly his hands were cupping Harry’s arse, squeezing and kneading the muscle there. Harry let out an involuntary moan and leaned back. “You take care to maintain your body,” Malfoy continued. Harry opened his eyes and watched as Malfoy stepped back and began a slow circle around him. “You’re a middle-aged man promoted to a thankless desk job and yet you have the body of someone much younger and more active.” Malfoy smirked. “One can only assume the
“It’s going to be alright,” the young mother offered the man. It was the fourth time she’d rushed her partner in for a finger reattachment. “They’re really good here.”
“Fuck, Draco,” Potter’s breath is hot against the skin of his neck. “I need you in my bed right now.” He runs his hands over Draco’s shoulders, down his chest, only to stop and cup Draco’s hardening cock through his trousers. “And I need these off.”
His eyes flew open and he shook his head. “No, Mother, I don’t—” He sighed. “You got to choose him, on some level. You chose to love him and be his partner and have a life with him.” Draco couldn’t stop the tears forming in his eyes. “I had no choice but to trust my father and believe in him...believe he knew what was right and he was going to take care of me.” Draco wiped his cheeks. “He was supposed to take care of me. But…”
“How should I drink it, then?” Potter asked, holding out the glass, his eyes bright and challenging.
Draco wondered what knowledge Potter’s friends had of the substances he took. “Well, I need to find out exactly what they are. Would you—” Draco wanted to ask Weasley to go back to Potter’s and collect whatever he could find, but Draco realised he might not know what to look for. Without thinking he asked, “Would you take me there?”
“These are very old,” he says as he examines the levels of dust and grime clinging to the surfaces. He can already safely assert that at least half of them were done before the Statute of Secrecy based on some daring depictions with Muggles and the various styles and strokes. A few have water damage, others spell damage, but with the exception of a charred tapestry, there isn’t anything Draco feels he can’t fix.
“Merlin!” Draco shouts. The slightest press against his prostate sends a sizzle up into his core. Everytime Potter moves against it, something builds more and more inside him.
Pansy’s eyes fell to him and she straightened up, her smile fading. In her normal voice, she said, “But anyway, I—we need your help with a Signet Curse.”
Finnigan levitates the wireless with him as he goes, and suddenly the outdoor bonfire has turned into a dance off.
Malfoy leaned forward and licked a stripe up Harry’s neck and nibbled on his earlobe before whispering, “Can you blame me?” He was panting and moaning right along with Harry, and the sounds he was making were about to push Harry over the edge. “Potter, I’ve been hot for you for the past thirty years.”
“There,” Draco sat back. He looked at the leg and clung to a small feeling of accomplishment, ignoring the alarms in the more logical parts of his mind that told him they needed to go to the hospital.
, sexuality—and how little those things actually mattered. What had meant the most to Draco, in the end, had been his mother’s love, a love which had been planted and nurtured and slowly cultivated a guiding voice within him. That voice had stopped him from murder, had stopped him from taking steps and going places that he could never come back from. He had made terrible choices in life, but that voice within him had kept him from making unthinkable mistakes.
. He’s never once offered me more than a casual thank you note or a round at the Leaky. For Salazar’s sake, Draco, if he dropped to his knees for me, I’d—”
“I don’t know, there’s lots of people I would save,” he turns his head to the side and stares off at the enclosure walls.
Nodding his head, Draco steps forward and kisses him softly. “Yes,” he says, followed by a shaky, “Please.”
Draco stands and walks over to him, unable to tear his eyes away from the stupidly content and peaceful expression on Potter’s face. Careful not to disturb him, he picks up the blanket and tucks it around his shoulders. A hand darts out and grabs his arm.
“You want to give up on something before you even start it—anytime it has to do with your heart.” Blaise purses his lips. “It’s the only thing you know you can control.”
Fourteen hours later, he gives up and throws a drop cloth over the canvas, beyond frustrated that he still can’t get the right colour of green to highlight Harry’s eyes. A few minutes later, an owl comes billowing in through his open studio window and he recognises it immediately as his mother’s eagle owl. He gives it a treat and snatches the letter. It’s an invitation to a final luncheon for Teddy before he leaves for Hogwarts.
He silently entered the kitchen and slid into his usual spot at the table, eying Narcissa as she busied herself with something on the counter. When she approached with their plates, he nodded at the usual spread of food and said, “Thank you.”
He clutched the bag to his chest and smiled. “I—I don’t know what to say. Thank you,” he added quickly. He studied her for a moment. “Padma.”
So he’d made the non-refundable reservation for a small cottage near the shore before he could change his mind. His bags were packed and his Portkey to the village had been sent down from the Department of Magical Transportation.
“Depressing?” Harry smiled slightly and glanced in Draco’s direction. “It’s a commentary,” he said, “on the fall of Pureblood idealism.” He playfully elbowed Longbottom in the ribs. “It’s perfect for Grimmauld Place.”
Harry felt the blush creep up from his chest at the backhanded compliment Malfoy had given him, and he did not particularly want to acknowledge how it made his cock twitch. “Sounds like you’ve been admiring my body, Malfoy,” Harry said, struggling against the restraints.
Narcissa sighed and after a brief pause, smiled. “Yes, I suppose you’re right. No need to busy ourselves with things best left to the professionals.”
She smirked. “Oh come on! Narcissa’s out of town, this is the best night to pull.” She grabbed him and forced him down the hallway in the direction of his bedroom. “If we get you changed into something a bit more enticing, they’ll be throwing themselves at you left and right.”
It’s large enough that Draco doesn’t have to concentrate too hard on balancing, but when he’s about halfway across, he looks down, missteps, and fumbles forward. Firm hands grip his hips from behind and steady him until he can stand up straight and regain his balance. He turns his head and shivers. Potter’s directly behind him, almost pushed up against his back.
He readied himself for bed and tossed and turned for hours before falling into a fitful, uneasy sleep where he searched and searched but never found the green eyes he was looking for.
“The main salon at Grimmauld Place,” she replies, but her attention is stolen by a raucous Teddy who’s just come in from the garden with his brand new Firebolt. She waves at Draco to excuse herself and attends to her grandson, leaving Draco alone with the astonishing revelation that Harry Potter has purchased another one of his paintings to hang inside his house.
He grabs the platter and moves it to the table of food, casting a Stasis Charm. Blaise finally shows up, carrying a bottle of wine in each hand, Ginevra and Longbottom trailing close behind.
“You’ve been running the Trauma Ward expertly these past few months and we’re quite proud of the rate of recovery and feedback we are receiving.”
He knows Blaise doesn’t need him, but Slytherins prefer a partner when in the presence of other houses. They can share secret, judgmental looks and revel in the sharp, stinging replies they throw at their companions. Draco wouldn’t want to miss any of Blaise’s witty retorts, but he suspects his friend tones down his cunning when in the company of a certain desirable Herbology Master. Draco begins to doubt Blaise even cares that he’s absent from the outing.
“I had to cut my dinner plans short,” Draco said, and then he noticed Potter dripping all over the floor. He took out his wand and cast several dying spells in quick succession. “Why are you all wet?” His gaze fell to where Potter clutched his left arm. “And what is wrong with you?”
He raised the crystal to his lips and paused, ever so slightly shaking his head to inhale the intoxicating scent of black currants, blueberries, and fresh violets. He closed his eyes and pictured the white villa and the stone paths, the orchards and the vines, and the bright sun kissing his skin. He took a sip and let it christen him, full-bodied and powerful, yet elegant, enough to be cherished and enjoyed—enough to satisfy him in this single moment. He lowered the glass from his lips and opened his eyes.
Draco threw up a hand. “I’m not saying I will make any exceptions for you or falsify anything on your behalf. If the assessments come back anything but positive, it’s out of my hands.”
He’s not the least bit surprised that Potter’s bare chest is an exquisite masterpiece. Beneath the collection of soft curls, the tanned skin tells the story of a reckless junior Auror learning to exercise restraint and balance his ego. The scars across his body are like trophies of his successes, some perhaps painful reminders of his failures. Draco can’t help but feel both honored and insecure in the presence of someone so courageous. Draco has his own scars, some by Potter’s hand, but nothing from his past brings him anything but darkness.
“Well?” she scoffed, charming the O.R. scrubs over her regular ones. In a display of practised wandless magic, her scrub cap effortlessly wrapped around her hair and tied a bow at the nape of her neck. “Malfoy!”
Draco deflected, not wanting to remotely consider the long list of things that had kept him from sleep. He’d worried over his mother, and how things were going with Lucius. He worried that he’d been too cold to her and felt like garbage for not apologising. He stressed over the sudden realisation that Lucius could be around any corner, at any time. Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to handle another sighting. And he especially, resolutely, without a doubt, did
Draco paused as he raised his wand to cast a Neural Cerebrus Assessment. While it wasn’t even remotely as definitive as some of the more invasive Mind Healer techniques, it would breach Potter’s mind and hopefully shed light on what was going on. Draco stood there, suddenly filled with guilt. He knew it was necessary to get feedback on Potter’s brain activity, but it was also so thorough that it would provide Draco with insight into what Potter might be feeling emotionally, if anything at all. For a moment, Draco doubted himself as he considered the charm and how it might violate the modest amount of trust that Potter had afforded him. Which was ridiculous. Why did he care?
“For fuck’s sake, if that pyre hadn’t already been on fire, his gaze alone would have set it ablaze. He was half hard all night sitting there staring at you.” Blaise steps close and lightly slaps Draco’s cheek. “Do us all a favor and give the man some relief, yeah?”
Alicia hadn’t taken her eyes off Draco and pressed him further. “Is it possible that the Dark Lord did something to your chambers to affect your ability to complete his assignment?”
was one of the oil paintings up for auction and it held subtle pieces of Draco in every single stroke. The Malfoys had cultivated peacocks for centuries, and when Draco’s mind healer had asked him to identify some of the things that he still loved about his family’s estate, the memories from his childhood of collecting feathers and terrorising the peafowl had brought a smile to his face. But the reality after the war was something altogether less familiar. Gone were the dozens of prideful peacocks. All that remained were two haggard old males, missing half their feathers, and there were disfigurations where their legs and wings had broken and healed over. Their injuries forced them to cobble around the grounds without a shred of the lurid and distinguishable figures that they’d formerly carried.
The sight of Potter quickened Draco’s pulse and stirred up something hot and primal within him. There were other men dancing, men who were equally fit and, objectively speaking, fell into the category of what Draco liked—slim, pliable, and not the bloody Boy Who lived. Draco tended to gravitate toward men who were shorter and thinner than he was, men who submit to his desire to take the lead, men who wouldn’t be able to corner him into doing anything he didn’t want to do. He knew he needed control, and he knew Potter was someone who undoubtedly would never submit, at the very least, to someone like Draco.
“This way,” Potter trails his hand over Draco’s shoulder, stepping in front of him to lead the way. A few minutes later and they’re at the edge of a clearing where the veil between the Fae and the mortal world opens.
Draco took that as a cue to continue his conversation with Teddy, who quickly switched subjects to Gobstones and pulled out his set. The early afternoon flew by with discussions of Hogwarts and Teddy’s excitement to be finally attending school the following year. Andromeda had joined them but she sat silently in a rocking chair near the fireplace, nodding her head and smiling as she followed their conversation. They talked about classes, professors, Peeves, and the staircases, before inevitably delving into the Houses and their token characteristics.
Before he was friends with Potter, seeing his success would bring resentment and anguish. But now...Now when Draco sees his success right in front of him in the flesh, his feels quite the opposite, and something entirely inappropriate given Potter’s present situation.
He wanted so badly for the words that Harry had said to be true. Draco desperately needed to be redeemed, to be someone other than the young man that he was. He’d been handed such privilege, been given a place at Hogwarts where he utilised his clever nature and all the masks and subterfuge that had been ingrained in him. He’d had a hand in devious plots and people had died. And yet Harry Potter stood in front of all of wizardom and told a different tale. He spoke of a different side of Draco, and perhaps even shined a light on the truth.
“I’ll make sure she gets these right away,” Draco promised and shrunk the stack to a manageable size to fit it in his pocket. He smiled and nodded, “Well, then, if that’s all? I’ll go say goodbye to Teddy.”
