Leaning against the wall, Draco staggers away from the main room. He finds a narrow service corridor and stumbles into a storeroom crowded with old furniture. He drops down heavily on a heavily stained bench.
Draco screams, slamming his hands into Potter’s chest. Potter gasps, falling backwards, tripping over a bench. His wand clatters to the ground, the light spinning around the room. Draco whirls around, kicking the door open, bursting out into the corridor. He shoves past a startled witch, who yells out angrily.
‘Sirius!’ Harry shouts, dropping his things and throwing his arms around his godfather, knocking him backwards into the foyer.
you enough?’ Harry exclaims. ‘You stupid little twat! I talk to you more than I talk to my friends. I fly two hours at least four times a week to go see you. I wrote at least fifty letters to the Head Auror, begging for your early release. Don’t like you enough? I fucking
Harry must be misunderstanding something. Doesn’t he see that Draco is only trying to help? He struggles to speak past the clammy feeling in his chest; fear, he realises distantly, fear that Harry will be furious enough to push him away.
She had been trying to make Harry and Ron go back with her, but Ron had fobbed her off. ‘Fred and George didn’t have the “proper qualifications” and they are – were – George is bloody successful,’ he pointed out, flustered by his grammatical misstep; they pretended not to notice. ‘Anyway,
Theo threw himself onto Draco, hissing and spitting curses. Draco caught words of virulent hatred and rage as the other man rained blows down on his face and torso. Between the poison coursing through his veins and Theo’s abuse, there was little Draco could do but to hold his hands up to his face.
him. He was the cut-grass scent of the Quidditch pitch, the musk of sweat, and the warmth of freshly brewed tea.
“Oh, no,” the Veela looked surprised that he should even ask. “We Veelas, we love deeply and truly. If we are lucky, we meet our Heart’s Desire in our lifetime. We are able to live without them, of course, but once we meet them, we
Dumbledore pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes. ‘Yes. Created in the child when he killed James and Lily. I don’t think Voldemort realised.’
As he made his way down, he indulged in a few daydreams about Potter. Maybe after the Christmas party, Potter would be in enough of a holiday spirit to let Draco give him a rimjob.
Draco is an alabaster statue carved by moonlight: the curve of his cheek, the bloom of his lips, and long hair twisted into a single, thick braid. He is broader in the shoulders, lithe and slender. Harry thinks of Greek gods on plinths, this creature of delicate beauty, as breakable as time-blasted ancient marble. His heart is beating in time with another, something trembling in his chest.
Draco lets go, and Harry staggers back, wiping his mouth furiously with the back of his hand. Draco’s heart withers, turns to dust from his mate’s blatant rejection;
A flash of pity crossed Healer Mitra’s face, and that shook Draco from his reverie. Not even in his grave should Draco Malfoy be pitied. He drew himself together with difficulty.
Draco had completely underestimated Weasley’s intuitiveness. On the fourteenth day without Harry, Weasley rested his chin on the counter, and abruptly said, “Why are you and Harry still fighting?”
It was an invasion like Draco had never felt; Snape’s will was an army of thousands against his force of a single knight. He was an observer in a vessel where control had been violently wrested from him. From a distant, he watched as his body ran towards the gates, head looking on straight forward, a vast black ocean of despair lapping at his consciousness. Behind him, Snape had turned around to face Harry Potter.
Yes, it’s Ron and Neville, who sounds like he’s on the verge of tears. With an effort, driven by sheer irritation and desire to tell them to
‘It doesn’t hurt,’ Harry assures him, smirking in amusement, his cheeks still red. ‘It’s not like the potions—at all, trust me. It’s …’ He screws up his face, embarrassed. ‘Merlin, do I really have to say this?’
‘I’m on the committee too,’ Hagrid said cheerily. ‘So we oughta be seein’ each other a lot over the next few months. This will be fun, yeh’ll see, Harry! Loads of yer ole school chums on the committee.’
He looks down at his chest, where the Killing Curse struck him. He tries not to think about what he lost, and begins moving towards the boat. His feet are soundless, and he doesn’t make the slightest impression on the sand. That must be where he’s supposed to go, but why are some people not getting on? He hangs back from the silent queue, watching, but still bewildered, he taps a black-haired man, who is also standing aside.
Draco fiddled with his fork, pushing his mashed potatoes around his plate. The oily film on the gravy broke as the brown sauce swilled around his plate. Up and down the table, the other Death Eaters made polite conversation, enthusing about Quidditch teams and gossiping about upcoming social events.
Draco came across the Room of Hidden Things quite by accident at the end of fifth year. He had been racing along the seventh floor, desperate to find out what Potter had been so secretive about and the door appeared out of nowhere.
Draco gritted his teeth. Walking into the kitchen was nearly as hard as walking into the courtroom for his trial had been.
Jonas came with a high-pitched shriek, his come slipping warm into Draco’s mouth. Draco spat and moved up, flipping the older man onto his front. Jonas hitched his arse up into the air obligingly and Draco entered in a single, smooth motion, suppressing a deep groan. Holding Jonas by his hips, Draco closed his eyes and began thrusting, the slap of skin on skin filling the air. Images flashed before his eyes: memories spliced with fantasies. Angry green eyes spitting unholy fire. A thin pale face screwed up in fury, transmuting into wild lust. Chapped pale lips parting to shout a hex, closing around Draco’s cock.
He was inconsolable, but he did not tell his mother or Blaise: Voldemort was rising at court, and three months after the ball, Father fell from his horse on a hunting trip, and died in the hunting lodge leagues away from the palace. Voldemort and his Death Eaters bore home his body wrapped in linen and stinking of rotting flesh and dead flowers.
Neville joins in here, sharing horror stories from relatives who clearly took wicked delight in scaring the boy. Their conversation flows more naturally and enjoyably than Draco could have imagined; Harry clearly has much insider knowledge into Hogwarts, since he was raised by a Hogwarts professor. He talks about her enthusiastically, describing her as a patient, loving teacher, although from Neville’s expression, Draco suspects Harry to be unabashedly biased.
Draco managed to eke a modicum of curiosity and looked up cautiously. He squinted against the glare of Jackson’s wand, making out Jackson’s spare, austere figure and behind him, a taller figure draped in oversized black robes. Jackson pointed his wand to the side and Draco saw that it was Snape.
When Draco did not answer because his tongue was stone and his words were trapped in a vacuum, Lord Voldemort raised his wand and pointed it at Draco’s mother. ‘
Draco laughed when the Healers told him what he had become five years ago. The Malfoys had always worn their pureblood status as a well-polished badge of honour. To think that a lusty Malfoy ancestor had taken a Veela for a wife! Not that Draco is complaining – that trace of Veela blood and magic is the only reason he survived the magic extraction spells, albeit with the side effect of his body completely adopting Veela magic.
Hermione, shouted down from the common room with a scared Lavender in tow, cannot get Harry to see reason either. Draco has to lock Harry in his arms to stop him from going off, while Ron and Neville run to get McGonagall and Dumbledore. Dean and Seamus hover worriedly in the background, staring at Harry hurling invective at everyone for getting in his way.
Draco tilts his head, his smile widening. ‘Or was it something else? Can Champions be each other’s date to the ball?’
All his life, Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy had told him he was their precious son. He was brilliant and smart and good at anything he put his mind to. He was their hope, they told him, and he would bring glory to the Malfoy name no matter what he chose to do because he was their son.
Draco’s back prickles, his nails digging painfully into his palms. His claws are emerging. He squeezes his eyes shut, holding his breath. It is slightly easier when he cannot see, cannot smell the other boy. What is happening? It’s a Veela thing, he knows it. He could have screamed in frustration.
have none of the advantages of wizardkind. Witches and wizards have spells they could cast and potions they could imbibe to prevent diseases due to intercourse or – Merlin forbid – unwanted pregnancies.
Of course Draco couldn’t just let that go. He stopped as well and pulled on his best sneer. ‘It isn’t enough that you’ve put an innocent man in Azkaban; you’re trying to accuse
Potter returned his stare, green eyes glittering with malice. ‘I’ve told you before, Malfoy, I’m not
Harry jolted; his hand was terribly burnt and black. Minnie opened her mouth, horrified. The Headmaster realised his mistake and quickly shook his sleeve down. Ignoring their expressions, he continued talking about what they must do next. It was clear that he did not wish to talk about the injury, and Minnie could not press him this time.
‘Mr Remus Lupin – your wand is ten-and-a-quarter inches, cypress, unicorn hair. It is, of course, a close mate to Mr Black’s. Yes, soulmates would have complementary magic signatures, and we see that in the wands that chose you. Yes, yes, your case has given profound first-hand insight into wandlore regarding soulmates,’ Ollivander says, very pleased, and turns to Minnie. ‘And Miss Minerva McGonagall – nine-and-a-half inches, fir, dragon heartstring. The survivor’s wand, of course, of course …’
“Yes,” Healer Mitra said. “Being Veela, of course, comes with various advantages and disadvantages. I have several books you can read, and if you would like to speak to an actual Veela, I can help arrange it for you.”
that you’re here with us,’ Harry says, glancing around at Hermione, Ron and Neville, the boys on his other side. ‘Don’t you reckon?’
A hand seized him by the lapels of his coat, shoved him into hard stone, a wand stabbed above his sternum. Luc’s brown eyes shone in the dim light, hard and unforgiving as bits of amber. He made a sound of disgust, releasing Harry and stepping back. ‘What the fuck do you want, Potter?’
It’s the same snow and ice he carries with him from the day Voldemort fell. Harry held him for hours that night, rubbing warmth into those marble limbs, cleaning the bloodied claws, kissing the distant face, until Draco was a man again. But even as the dirty water swirled down the drains, Harry washing the battle from Draco’s skin glowing white beneath his dark hands, Draco did not thaw—and he does not leave Harry’s side.
Shaking, a slave to the compulsion, he drove his cock, leaking pre-come, into the stranger's wet heat. He still hears the omega's voice: a scream of ecstasy, hands clawing his bare back, hips bucking up, strong legs closing around Eltanin's waist. "
She was asking him to run away with her, to leave Father to suffer his fate, to leave everything behind so that he could live. No, she was
This should be enough: Draco doesn’t think he can take much more. Harry has been considerate, insisting Draco spend time with Nolan. ‘Don’t be a berk—the two of you will be long distance after this year, you should be with him as much as you can now,’ Harry said, waving him off. ‘I’m fine, I think I’m getting closer to the perfect potion.’
He felt the weight of it on his shoulders as he stood at the bottom of the broad steps leading up to the Entrance Hall. The massive front doors were thrown open, the strong light from the chandeliers spilling down the steps and across the lawn. Harry shivered, shoving his icy hands into his coat pockets.
Draco slid into the pool, turning the taps off once it was half-filled. He made a brief show of washing himself, the hot water pleasant against his skin. He settled on the ledge set into the walls of the pool. Leaning back, he closed his eyes and wrapped his hand around his hardening cock. He definitely heard a gasp this time.
Draco’s heart stuttered, his brain screaming out in alarm. Merlin, he was well and truly knackered. He couldn’t think through the thick haze of bone-deep exhaustion. He was cold too, the frost of the grass melting on the back of his robes.
During the dinner, Andromeda regaled them with stories of her childhood adventures with Draco’s mother. Bellatrix wasn’t mentioned once. It seemed Andromeda and Narcissa had grown up quite close even if they disagreed widely on key matters. Draco listened wistfully, wondering what it might have been like if Narcissa was more like Andromeda.
‘Yeah? Well, Potter is a pillock!’ Kingsbury shouted and that was the moment he had utterly lost the room.
Draco slips out of bed. He goes over to Harry, slipping his arms around him from behind. Resting his chin on Harry’s shoulder, he grimaces down at the ugly thing in Harry’s palm. To think this gaudy gold thing could have contained a piece of the Dark Lord’s soul … He hesitates, but Harry senses his unease and turns to look at him questioningly.
The chains holding him sitting upright against the cold slimy walls clinked as he involuntarily jerked, hands clawing, swollen mouth gaping wordlessly.
Glowing with the healthy tan she had carefully cultivated on the beaches of St Tropez, Pansy chattered away about her brilliant summer. She was, in her own way, trying to distract Draco from the nosy stares their compartment were receiving from people passing by. He sat and nodded, looking out the window at the platform.
Harry drops the blanket from around him, and surges across the bed. Malfoy’s eyes widen, as he falls back, Harry taking him by his shoulders.
An hour for homework and then he would have to sneak out to the Room of Hidden Things. Another night with the Cabinet – not that he could sleep, knowing that he had the Cabinet to work on.
‘Oh! Harry, the militia is at Meryton!’ Lydia cries, giggling giddily and spinning around the kitchen. ‘Is not that the most wonderful news? Officers! Officers in their smart, red coats!’
Draco laughs. ‘Oh right, I forgot. You need everything to be said, don’t you? Well, Potter, I like you too. Why else would I submit myself to this ridiculous idea of yours to have supper out here on a cold night? I like you enough to forgo reason and logic. I really fucking like you, Potter.’
Dressed in grey robes, he fairly faded into the stone of the room’s walls. Only his eyes shone, beautiful and entrancing. He walked to the foot of Draco’s bed, looking utterly cocksure. Light and shadows flickered across the smooth planes of his blandly good-looking face, darkness dipping between his full lips. Draco’s stomach clenched, his disquiet fading at the sight of the man’s loose gait, open hands.
‘Enough,’ he said firmly, ignoring the pleading look Potter shot him. ‘Merlin’s beard, you’re such a horny git.’
Zabini turned yellow under his golden-brown complexion. ‘You wouldn’t dare. Don’t you fucking dare, Malfoy.’
The twin occasions of Draco and Bingley’s engagements lure Darcy out of Derbyshire, and back to Netherfield, where Bingley have once again, happily settled. It appears that it was indeed Darcy who was the main perpetrator in Bingley’s departure, albeit with the Bingley sisters’ eager assistance. He
The words had slipped out, traitorous as Veritaserum. Draco hoped fervently that his embarrassment had not broken through his calm façade. Potter stared at him, mouth open, for a moment before closing it with a clack of teeth.
‘What are you smiling about, Potter?’ a woman growls, voice husky like a smoker’s, taking a threatening step forward. ‘Think you will be getting out of this, are you? If you’re as good an Auror as they say you are, how did we get the prince, eh?
His eyes flying open, Harry leaps to his feet, fists clenched by his sides. ‘STOP IT!’ he roars, the conflagration of his rage sweeping through him, obliterating his self-control. ‘
Sometimes, Draco thinks of his transformation as a stillborn phoenix rebirth. Where the firebird pops out of the ash as a whole, healthy creature, Draco is still soot, hopeless and useless – utterly bereft of wizard magic.
‘No,’ Harry says again. ‘You should go to the ball with Nolan—have fun. I’ll be fine. I’m trying out the new potion I developed, to see if it reduces the strain on my magic. I think it’ll work, so I should be better than ever this month.’
to know what you’re doing so we can save you from the next stupid thing you’re going to do. You have no right to be so bloody rude to Pans when she’s only trying to help!’
Draco laughs, running a hand through his loose hair. ‘Well, it will be amusing to see how my parents take to chopsticks.’
Harry stood, looking at him, thinking. Malfoy had said once that Harry hadn’t the capacity to be a Slytherin. Well now, Harry was about to prove the conniving blonde bastard wrong.
Draco swallows past the lump in his throat and pulls off his robes, the slithering of cloth absurdly loud in the graveyard. He holds it out to Potter. The boy stares at the bundled cloth for a few seconds before reaching out for it. His fingertips – ice-cold and wet – brush the back of Draco’s hand, and Draco is stumbling back before he realises it, his skin crawling with revulsion.
‘Here?’ Harry looked around and realised that he hadn’t turned down some random alley. His feet had brought him to Knockturn Alley.
He carefully moved another desk off Draco’s right arm, reached in and grabbed him. Potter’s arms snaked around Draco’s shoulders and Draco was pulled tight against Potter. They tumbled through the air, Potter’s Levitation Spell gone awry. They landed painfully on top of a slope of desks near the windows. Potter, wrapped tightly around Draco, bore the brunt of their rough landing.
Whatever it was Potter was saying to Weasley, it didn’t seem he managed to convince the other man. The train’s whistle pierced the air and doors began slamming shut up and down the train. The Weasley mother beckoned to Potter. Potter went and Draco lost sight of him.
‘Like what?’ Draco was goading him, he knew, but when Potter was angry, he kissed Draco like a living wet dream.
The house elves are rather alarmed at Draco’s naked state in this chilly weather, and they hurry to dress him. Once he is dressed, Draco asks for parchment and pen—he’s going to write a letter. Dumbledore is the man who holds the power now, and Malfoys have never been above appealing to those in power.
‘What?’ Draco says blankly; Merlin, was that how he came across? ‘I mean no offence, Potter. I only mean to say that yes, I am aware that you are Harry Potter. My name is –’
Harry feels like he has missed a step and finds the ground disappearing beneath him. He is discombobulated by the rapidity – and ease – with which Mr. Creevey brings up his brother, Colin. Colin was the first in his Muggle family to attend Hogwarts, and in his eagerness to embrace wizarding culture, he had for some reason fixed upon Harry as a role model for a young wizard. Harry had not minded, for Colin was harmless, and after the boy had found his own group of friends, the hero worship dissipated a little. Harry thinks sometimes that if Colin’s fixation with him had disappeared entirely, the boy might not have died.
Sirius’s parents threw him out when he was fourteen and decided he was no longer going to take the omega suppressant potion they forced him to take; it was a humiliation for the Black family to have an omega son. It was Harry’s dad’s family who took Sirius in. When the war came, Sirius didn’t show any mercy in fighting against his own family, and when his side won, he delivered those still hiding out in 12 Grimmauld Place to the Aurors himself, including his own father. But his mother escaped, and it was her who sent the assassins after Sirius.
By the time they parted, come was smeared all over Malfoy’s face and Harry couldn’t help but laugh at the sight of it. Malfoy shot him a look and shoved his hands under Harry’s jumper. ‘Clothes off,’ he said, voice low and sultry and promising; Harry couldn’t take his clothes off fast enough.
He couldn’t sleep the slightest bit, and got up before Harry. He thinks he will make the pancakes first. Surprise Harry with breakfast in bed. Show him that Draco truly is the perfect roommate, and Harry mustn’t move out.
Draco had just been dismissed from attending the Dark Lord in what used to be Lucius Malfoy’s study. Lord Voldemort had been amused by Draco seducing Harry Potter, amused enough to release Lucius Malfoy from Azkaban. Draco’s father was now resting in a room upstairs, cared for by two house elves.
It took Draco a few moments to corral a response. ‘Are you barmy? Did you get too much sunlight when you were at the equator?’
‘Yes, such a pity. His mistake was adopting a filthy creature like you. What are you good for? You taint the pureblood Malfoy bloodline. Such a pity … Don’t you see?’ the Dark Lord asks the closest Death Eater conversationally. ‘This is what we are fighting to protect. Would you want such a creature for a son-in-law, Nott?’
Dumbledore ignores him, tossing a handful of Floo powder into the fire. ‘12 Grimmauld Place.’ His shouts summon a house elf, who quickly fetches the masters. Sirius and Remus come rushing to the kitchen, their heads popping up in the Floo fire.
Zabini had kissed Draco in the shadows of the Slytherin common room when they were thirteen because he knew Pansy was in love with him. Draco, clueless, still harbouring a soft spot for the git from a long-dismissed crush, let him. Pansy wouldn’t speak to him for a week after that. When Draco asked Zabini point-blank why he did it, Zabini merely shrugged and replied: ‘You liked it, didn’t you?’ And Salazar slay him, Draco did.
No, Harry Potter certainly could. This was the same foolhardy boy who, when he was eleven, plunged headfirst into a booby-trapped dungeon to retrieve the Philosopher’s Stone from a mad professor. Potter had no sense of self-preservation whatsoever.
The fireplace flares, as early dawn begins to steal into the common room. They perk up from their half-sleep. It is Dumbledore, blood streaked on his craggy face, beard singed in patches. He looks straight at Draco.
They land in the courtyard behind the main Portkey office for London in Diagon Alley, and are happily received by their waiting relatives. Immediately outside in the main thoroughfare of Diagon Alley, the new arrivals are buffeted by the crowd thronging wizarding London’s most popular shopping street. Their uncle most considerately proposes taking their tea in a quiet tea shop, to which his nephew and nieces agree eagerly.
Draco gazes at Harry Potter, whose green eyes are clear-sighted and determined behind his glasses, a faint flush to his cheeks, lips pursed. Around them, the world whirls, adults clamouring and excitable.
me,’ Harry says. ‘I love you even if you hate yourself – and I will love you until you love yourself too.’
‘Darcy looked rather suspicious,’ Lizzy says, looking with distress at Jane’s closed expression. ‘He saw us as we were bringing Lydia out of the manor. He might have … formed assumptions about her.’
, looking quivery. The wizard shoved his empty plate at her, commanding her to come back with more food. Cherry looked at Narcissa, who nodded. The house elf disappeared.
The Polyjuice Potion having worn out two hours ago, Zabini was sitting against a wall, dark head bent over a book. He looked up, closing his book with a
‘I have offended you, Bennet. It was unconsciously done,’ Malfoy’s voice is crisp and clear. ‘I am very sorry that I did. I ask only for your forgiveness and your sufferance. That is all I will say to you. You need not fear my presumption in approaching you or your family ever again – I will not pollute your sight any further. Good evening.’
rather too forcefully, because Draco is always good. As Pansy and he walk away, he hears a lady squeal: ‘Ooh, they will make a lovely pair when they are older!’
And he is filled with the icy-cold certainty that Minnie will send him back now, because Elphie is gone, and she is sad, and Harry has done nothing, but make her angry. His knees nearly buckle beneath him, and he holds on tighter to the broom to remain standing.
‘I know I made a mistake—I should have told you where I was going—I should have told you I needed time—it was irresponsible and awful of me. I’m sorry, I’m so very sorry, Harry,
‘They say that all Slytherins are loyal to the Dark Lord,’ Draco whispers, staring down at Zabini’s wide, tear-filled eyes. ‘I hope you’re not, because if what you
He gazes upon his woefully inadequate romantic history with a resigned eye. When his sisters are married, he supposes he must reside alone at Longbourn with their parents. Life at Longbourn without Jane or Lizzy is a dreary aspect. He endeavours to pretend such an outcome is far in the future, but his – and Mrs. Bennet’s – observations of Bingley’s besotted behaviour tell him that the time for Jane to leave them will come sooner than he would like it to. However, Jane has been remarkably reticent about her feelings towards the gentleman, and Lizzy and Harry are unable to penetrate behind her silence.
It was two months after the end of the war and yet Potter still looked wretchedly skinny. He hadn’t been sleeping much and his eyes still carried that hunted, tensed look. He barely looked at Draco.
Lizzy, for all her contempt for romance and marriage, is at heart as large a romantic as Madame Laverne de Montmorency, the inventor of the world’s most potent love potions. Harry knows that Lizzy has embarked on a few love affairs while in Hogwarts, but the war and the Bennet family’s subsequent self-imposed isolation put an end to that. Not for the first time in recent months, Harry wonders if he might take his sisters to London. They would like it, and their father would welcome the quiet.
Draco left with his arms laden with food and the dawning realisation that the Hogwarts house elves didn’t miss much. His mind wandered towards the sex lives of house elves and he shuddered. It was wrong somehow, wondering how house elves got off; it was like imagining your granny going at it.
’s fault really. How could Potter have known there was Veela ancestry in the Malfoy bloodline? Merlin,
Draco continues talking, his voice airy and his footsteps loud and obnoxious in the quiet forest. ‘As you can imagine, my mission is exceedingly urgent. I can assure you, Potter, that a meeting in the Forbidden Forest was at the very bottom of my list of expectations for today.’
He hadn’t taken two steps before Goyle called out. ‘Potter! Have you had tea? Would you like to come in?’ The large man looked nervous as Harry considered his offer.
Harry sits at the dinner table with Minnie, Sirius, Moony and Dumbledore, laughing at the silly stories Sirius tells about the Muggles he meets at his job as a bartender in a Muggle pub. A pile of presents sits next to him, waiting to be opened. The kitchen is warm and smells of the cake Minnie baked for his birthday. There is a light, warm and soft, deep in Harry’s chest; this –
Bingley, who has heard the excuse in numerous occasion, welcomes the Bennets warmly, ignorant of the quizzical glances their party receives from Muggles disembarking from their carriages. Their host is very quick to claim Jane for two dances, something Mrs. Bennet notes with a bright, approving eye.
‘Hermione isn’t an obnoxious know-it-all,’ Potter said huffily. ‘She’s just really smart and she likes learning and – oh, all right,’ he muttered at the look on Draco’s face. ‘She
be some boundaries he can draw. He won’t say the words that make Draco thinks he needs him—even if his mate insists on protecting him. He mustn’t encourage him.
That night hiding in the woods, Draco’s arms circled tight around him as they crouched behind a tree, is the last time Draco touched him willingly. Draco still soothes Harry’s aches and mends his wounds—needed after the First Task with the dragons—but there is a strange formality to it: Draco asking Harry if he might help, his fingers pressed to the inside of Harry’s wrist.
‘I’m Harry Potter, by the way,’ Harry Potter says abruptly, sticking his hand out. ‘It’s nice to meet you.’
Draco stood in the vast echoic room, staring at the tall thin dark cabinet. He had been going over every inch of the Vanishing Cabinet for the past three hours and was completely and utterly spent. This was how he had been spending most of his nights for the past week.
When Sirius and Remus—as they insist he call them—send them up to their rooms to unpack before dinner, Draco catches Harry’s elbow, as they climb the stairs. Harry says, ‘Thanks, mate,’ with a grateful smile, the tiredness softening on his face, and Draco smiles back gladly.
The rest of his path unfolded before him, crooked and treacherous with traps and pitfalls. He hurried on grimly, the brief glow of success disappearing into his wintry determination.
‘Here,’ Draco says eagerly, taking Harry’s hand—the bleeding stops and the skin starts to knit together—and pulling him through.
Lily and James are different, but people react so badly to learning that their child is omega—and their firstborn at that! The poor child—’
His magic flares up, rough as sandpaper against Draco’s senses, and every streetlamp in the alley shatters, the glass tinkling down the ground in a shower. Alarmed shouts ring out, echoing down the alley. Potter pushes Draco up against the wall, the back of Draco’s head bumping against the brick painfully.
Potter shook his head, grimacing. “Unfortunately, no. There is only one registered seller of Angel’s Trumpet in England, and he has not sold any in the past year. Your attacker must have bought it from the black market or from a seller outside of the United Kingdom. We are trying to track down a seller on the black market, and coordinating with the French Magical Law Enforcement. France has a number of registered sellers.”
, Eltanin thinks with faint amusement. The other Gryffindors roll their eyes, clearly used to such banter.
Mother gripped him tighter. ‘You cannot afford to be foolish anymore, Draco! You’ve always been … obsessed with Potter, no, there is no use denying it, I am your mother, I know. You stay away from Potter and do what you must. Do you hear me?’
“No,” Potter shook his head. “You didn’t want my help, so fine, I’m washing my hands of this case. You can talk to the next Auror.”
Of Mr. Darcy, with his fine, tall person, handsome features and noble mien, within five minutes of his entrance, circulates news of his having ten thousand a year. Of the remaining two gentlemen and lady, the Muggle community finds themselves bereft of any information beyond their names that could illuminate their background.
Draco has fully transformed – something he has refused to do in Harry’s presence for years, despite Harry repeatedly telling him he doesn’t mind. Draco in his normal form is stunning enough, but this aspect of Draco is incomprehensibly beautiful. He is taller, his shoulders broad and arms thicker to bear the weight of white wings sweeping from his back, larger than Draco’s entire frame. His arms and feet are clawed, hard and grey as cast-iron, and his entire body is covered in white, downy feathers like baby birds’.
The wind wails down the sloping sides of the wizarding graveyard, scattering pebbles and desiccated plants. The moon appears from behind the clouds, blazing down upon the stone cauldron. The night is not wicked, but gods, how much the moon loves to lend its power to the Dark Arts.
‘Curious,’ Darcy says with a glance at Lizzy, who is pointedly not looking at him. ‘I would loath my sister to trouble herself with anything more than simple housekeeping.’
But looking down now at the child in her arms, Narcissa wonders dazedly how she could have wanted any other child. This boy is
Malfoy is flying with the thunderstorm of his rage, and Harry knows by now that there is only waiting for the storm to dissipate.
‘Nosebleed,’ Draco says with great nonchalance. ‘I’m fine now. The bleeding’s stopped.’ Blood trickles down his spine. ‘Don’t worry.’ He rises from the bench, forcing Potter back onto his feet as well. ‘Come on. I still need to get that drink and I
‘No, Harry, you would serve us far better by staying. Longbourn would surely fall apart if you should leave it to us,’ she said, waving her butter knife around the table.
. Why does he have to go and think that? Because now he is looking at Draco again, and he sees the shadows smeared like ink stains beneath those grey eyes, and the tightly pursed lips, and the skin pale as a banshee’s.
‘Snape was dying,’ Potter continues. ‘And he gave me his memories – of my mother, of you. He wanted to save you, you know, but he … he had to see his mission through. He had to help me defeat Voldemort. Otherwise … otherwise he would have taken you away that night he went to see you. He killed Jackson.’
There is only the suggestion of movement and the merest pressure on her temples, but it does not matter what else Poppy Pomfrey remembers, because soon, she will not be able to recall anything of what she did or where she went on the night of 31 July 1980. She stares into Albus’ bright blue eyes, her face slack and empty.
Crabbe and Goyle were … well, they were Crabbe and Goyle. In the past few months, Pansy had become more of their leader than Draco had. It seemed they took their lead from her now, which suited Draco fine because it gave him more freedom to duck into dusty cupboards with Potter.
Old Horace Slughorn was a Slytherin, no doubt, and clearly an extremely talented Potions Master. Draco eyed the tiny corked glass bottle Slughorn took out of his pocket, the desire to possess it clawing at his insides. Imagine what he could do with twelve hours of perfect luck! He wouldn’t use it for something so mundane as Quidditch or exams. There was simply so much he had to be lucky in doing …
‘It’ll be weird having Potions without Snape,’ Nott was musing. ‘Slughorn doesn’t really seem like a
‘No, it’s clear that you must stay here,’ Dumbledore interjected before Sirius or Moony could say anything. ‘Any information you can give us about the Dark Lord would be useful—if you do wish to join the Order.’
Mrs. Bennet is quick to censure her husband for what she sees as an unjust attack upon her favourite child. ‘It is only to be expected for a young girl to have her head turned by a handsome young man once in a while! Yes, it is only to be expected when you do not take us to London or Bath for more varied society.’
He presses his knuckles into his forehead, taking deep steady breaths. He has to return soon; Potter will think he is avoiding him. The image of Potter laughing with that stranger flashes through his mind and the jealous creature in his chest roars again. He stifles a groan, reaching behind to pull out another feather, his back burning.
Granger grabbed Potter’s arm, her face reflecting Draco’s alarm. ‘Harry, no! Think … you mustn’t … you’ll be in such trouble …’
, Harry reminds himself fiercely. Draco is right that being soulmates is an unavoidable fact. He cannot change how Draco—and his family—has become so enmeshed in his problems, but there
‘I wouldn’t finish it all,’ Harry protests. ‘We haven’t started on pudding yet, sir! So, you are just in time.’
Harry thinks that she has nothing to fear, and he likes seeing how many of her former students still clearly remember and admire her. It’ll be nice having Minnie at Hogwarts, even if he has to remember to call her Professor in class.
It is three days later, after Minnie takes him flying and they are sitting down to lunch, that Harry feels just that bit lighter than he has since Sirius got hurt. Madam Pomfrey has managed to patch Sirius up all right without taking him to the wizarding hospital, St. Mungo’s, so he is resting at home for now, as Moony told Minnie and Harry over Floo last night. Moony looked so gaunt and pale, but he managed a smile for Harry. When Minnie asks him if he might like to hear what happened to his godfather, Harry thinks that he must be strong like Moony, and he nods.
He shakes his head, thrilled. ‘Most curious – far more interesting than that phoenix wand, I would say! I hardly work with Veela hair – this is a very new wand. I only made it a month ago – it almost feels as if it was made for you, eh? Well, well,
Draco gazes at him, eyes soft and lips curled into a slight smile. There is an unspeakable yearning in the lines of his face, in the lines of his body leaning towards Harry. It is absolutely devastating, Harry floundering in the wreckage of coherent thought. He can only think:
All these thoughts of war leave Harry in a very black mood for Malfoy’s visit. Lizzy has offered to sit with him, an unspoken attempt on her part for rapprochement. Harry happily accepts her offer. Dobby shows Malfoy into the drawing room, his enormous green eyes full of curiosity at this new young wizard. The door closes behind Malfoy, who takes a step forward and is nearly tripped by the ottoman he so courteously suppressed yesterday.
‘Malfoy,’ Potter tries to catch his elbow, but Draco sidesteps him, turning to look at him, the doorway behind him.
This hasn’t changed: Draco’s insistence that he would help Harry. The blond has the slightly warped idea that to be a good friend, he must be useful, even at his own expense. Harry mustn’t allow him to do it again.
‘Same as you I suppose, sleeping was always difficult for me, my household was never quiet my parents either argued constantly or were throwing parties that never seemed to end, I suppose my body just tuned itself to staying up late and not sleeping’ he explained, it sounded like torture, knowing what caused you to stay up could have been avoided if his parents had of appreciated his need for sleep rather than their own, Harry’s reasons for a lack of sleep were unfortunately not that subdued, ‘but I think you have something more on your mind than why I was out last night’
‘That’s not fair, you shouldn’t have had to deal with it’ his voice raised slightly in anger, ‘it wasn't your burden to bear, to hide away, it’s not fair!’ the boy grabbed his hands as he looked up at him his voice calmed as his grey eyes fell onto him.
‘Harry... just ask what you want to ask me don’t beat around the whomping willow’ he was straight to the point, harry could appreciate that.
‘Yeah exactly what Hermione said, it’s a two-way thing Harry, we’re friends and we’re here through battling the dark arts to stupid class essays but you have to do the same for us, does that sound fair?’ Ron asked the two now turning to face him as he nodded in reply to the boys' question.
‘Is it weird that I found the whole you feasting thing kind of hot?’ he said reluctantly going red slightly, ‘like I really enjoyed watching you eat, the passion it was-’ the boy broke the space between them kissing him heavily jumping onto his lap as he did, the tension between them after everything that had just happened was immeasurable, Harry shivered as the boy began kissing his neck, the cool feeling of his fangs ever so slightly brushing on his neck, before he could even suggest it he felt the boys fangs being inserted into his neck.
‘Wow... wow’ was all he said before getting up and walking down the stairs of the quidditch spectator stand, his classmate following quickly behind him.
‘I am sorry to burst your bubble Potter but I am not a werewolf, and here I thought you were onto something’ he said shaking his head with a smile, ‘is that seriously what you wanted to ask me?’
‘When you say cathartic... do you think it could be done without turning someone? Like just for the feeding and the catharsis, like a win-win situation without the transformation’
‘Well I wouldn’t want to make you feel bad... I don’t like it when others make me feel bad and i certainly didn't like it when you did it... I would never do that to you, at least not intentionally...’ he turned to face him, his fangs were exposed and Harry couldn’t tell if that was something he had intended or if it was just a natural state for him at this point, ‘I missed talking to you, I’ll admit that I was kind of hiding from you but I really didn’t want to, all I wanted was to talk to you’
He walked further into the forest as the trees around him grew heavier and the light from the moon disappeared behind the trees, somehow the further he seemed to walk into the forbidden forest the colder he seemed to get, he wanted the boys wrapped around him to keep him warm and he wasn’t getting it at that moment. The noises of creatures around him appeared to increase but appeared to be moving away from him and further away, meaning they were running away from something or someone... Draco. He edged forward into the woods hoping the person that they were running from was in fact Draco and not some dark wizard who had come to kill Harry, either way at least he wouldn’t be alone anymore, he would have company one way or another and perhaps the cool touch of death would remind him of the cold touch of the boy he had grown to care for, his Draco Malfoy.
‘I understand, you’re both right I've been an absolute blast-ended skrewt and I'm sorry about that, and as for the whole Draco being a werewolf thing well you two don’t have to worry about that anymore, I put that to bed’
‘Don’t let me interrupt please... finish’ he grabbed the boy's hand and led him to the bowtruckle once again kneeling down with him, ‘eat for me Draco, I wanna watch you do it’ he whispered in the boy’s ear, like nothing he went down to the neck draining the blood as he ran his hands through the boy's hair, the sight of him feeding was intoxicating as he pushed his head slightly into the beast.
‘How does he keep doing that? How does someone just disappear without a trace without anyone noticing?’ this was the fourth time Harry had asked those questions to the annoyance of Hermione and Ron, ‘and why does he know so much about werewolves? Half of that stuff wasn’t even in our textbooks so how does he know any of it?’
‘Well that has made me lose my appetite’ the two raised their eyes at the red headed boy before seeing him eat a piece of toast and laughing, ‘we should go we’re going to be late for defense against the dark arts’ they nodded in agreement and rose from the table they were at.
‘Well if I haven't eaten in a while blood can trigger it but aside from that no, not really, no full moons or anything like that’
The two walked onto the quidditch pitches, Harry led him up the stairs of the Slytherin stand as he followed him in silence, they finally reached the top sitting in the spectators' seats beside one another. They looked up at the night sky the stars sparkled like diamonds and his vision fixed on the moon, the revealing moon that had given him so much to think about the past two days. His gaze eventually turned to the blonde-haired boy sitting beside him, he had a look of terror in his eyes, a look he had never seen on his face before. Not that he had seen him much before.
‘Would you ever do it? If someone let you that is...’ he was drawing closer to the boy, breaking the gap between then, ‘would you do it with me?’ he was walking on thin ice; this was a dangerous game but right now he didn’t care.
The two were practically inseparable that entire day and worked together in almost every class they had together, although they couldn’t understand why everyone around them could tell the two were infinitely happier with one another than they ever were on their own. They also were doing better in their classes academically as well, they were quite the duo, even Hermione was impressed with how they were doing class, she would never say it but Harry had a feeling that she might feel slightly threatened by the two of them when they worked with one another.
The moon, despite not being full, was as bright as it had been the night before when he had Draco Malfoy crashing into him and knocking himself out, the absolute git. The moon looked more intruding that night, perhaps because of the theory he now had about the young Malfoy boy. It had revealed something he had never wished it to, although he supposed that was the curse of the truth, it wouldn’t always be pretty in fact it often wasn’t, revealing dark truths often came with a deep sacrifice on both sides and you wouldn’t always like what you heard. Yet still he spun in the light of the moon that shone through his dorm window. Tonight he lifted his maroon sweater once more but decided it best to throw a pair of trousers over his bare legs, though he still left his feet uncovered, he had enjoyed the cool touch under his feet last night and he wished to feel it again, the cold feeling of the floor was already exciting him to the journey he would make tonight, this time he planned on going directly out onto the castle grounds, no more following shadows or chasing theories of lycanthropy in his fellow students.
‘No, it couldn’t' Harry answered shaking his head, already knowing what she was going to suggest, ‘i spoke to him last week, he has a large supply to keep him from transforming and he’s with Tonks anyway, she wouldn’t have let this happen... this was something else’
The soft sound of footsteps that echoed slightly through the corridors revealed to Harry that he was not alone wandering these halls and while he should have felt nervous at it being a professor or Filch, something in him knew that it was someone in a position similar to his own and in an action almost like a dream his feet wandered the halls the cold touch of the stone staircases beneath his feet increasing with every step he took towards the sound he had heard moments ago. He regained his focus from his dream like walk when he stood in front of the mirror of Erised, an object he had not seen since his first year in the magical school when he had his first encounter with the dark lord that had continued to terrorise his life ever since that day when he had picked the blood red philosophers stone out of his pocket upon it’s revelation from his reflection when he looked in the mirror. That was before its inevitable destruction, he still felt guilty in a manner like his actions were the reason Nicholas Flammel and his wife were going to die, while this obviously wasn’t true the thought sometimes crossed his mind and saddened him.
He brushed the boy's white blonde hair out of his eyes revealing a slight scarring on his head most likely from the two of them crashing into one another, although now that he thought about it, they hadn’t exactly crashed into one another, the blonde-haired boy had crashed into him, after following him for a majority of the night. He lifted his sleeve to the boy's head wiping the blood from his head, although as he wiped it away, he realised the blood was not Draco’s but was in fact Harry’s, he hadn’t even realised he was bleeding until then and as he lifted his hand to his head, he found that his hand had more blood on it than he would prefer, that being none. As the blood dripped from his hand onto the grass, he wiped it on his maroon sweater, if it stained it would be hard to notice and if anyone did, they would assume it was from a rather eventful quidditch match. The boy below him moved slightly letting out a soft groan, he rubbed his hand on the boys head hoping to soothe him, he felt that the rest might actually do him some good, he looked like he needed it, Harry wished it had been enough to knock him out too although he realised they would both then be helpless and vulnerable if they were knocked out in the middle of the Hogwarts grounds in the cold of the October weather without anyone to care for him. Now the duty of care fell upon him, despite not knowing him very well or at all now that he thought of it, he still had a responsibility to take care of him stalker like tendencies or not, he was hurt and alone... he would put an end to those two things as quickly as he could, he had already fixed the alone part, although he was knocked out, he enjoyed the boys' company.
Draco wants to hide Harry from the stares, to turn away and hold him until the tarry blackness covering his mind has gone. He feels it: Voldemort’s stain all throughout Harry. He has wrecked Harry’s logic, putting in place only implacable fear and loathing. But Draco doesn’t know what to say that Voldemort’s pollution wouldn’t turn Harry against him, so he grits his teeth and holds Harry closer, ignoring the dull kicks and scratches.
Draco stared at him and knew that Potter honestly believed in Dumbledore. He truly thought Dumbledore could make anything go right, that Dumbledore could save them all. For a moment, he allowed himself to indulge in Potter’s fantasies.
Seated comfortably, the Bennet siblings can now examine each other at luxury. Harry is gratified to see Mary well. The quietest of his sisters with awkward manners, Mary did not find it easy living amongst four other sisters pretty and memorable in their own ways. It was at Hogwarts and in Ravenclaw that she flourished and revealed her genius in Potion-making. She carries herself with assurance now, her smile wide and vibrant, and she addresses her siblings with none of the painful self-consciousness that marred her childhood.
‘We don’t have a happy ending, I’m afraid,’ he said. ‘Or you would have already met him. Towards the end, my younger brother, Aberforth, protested our relationship. He thought I was spending too much time with my lover and too little time with our family. He was upset and jealous and … I wasn’t a good brother – no, I’m still a terrible brother. A fight broke out between the three of us – my lover, Abe, and I – and … my younger sister Ariana was killed.’
‘It was a mistake – such a stupid mistake – giving in to Voldemort,’ Draco whispers. ‘As if I could ever do anything to help him kill you. When we all thought you were dead … I thought I might die too, without ever telling you what you meant to me. This is bloody warped, isn’t it? Bloody perverse.
Draco sat there in the idyll of his childhood garden, holding his weeping mother in his arms. He felt her tears seep through the front of his robes, hot and burning against his cold skin. He closed his eyes, feeling the breeze on his dry cheeks.
Potter was sitting at a pea-green desk, waving his wand repeatedly over the badly scratched surface. He didn’t look up when Draco walked over. Draco kicked the table’s leg, causing the table and attached bench to jerk. Potter straightened, but still wouldn’t look up, his fists clenched, every line of his body screaming tension.
Potter's hand flies to his face. "Voldemort gave it to me, but I paid him back: I killed him. I … that night … I panicked. I close to the start of heat, and Dumbledore warned me not to leave the room, but I was so bored. I … I thought you might think I was …
‘But she is prone to anything that offers her the greatest adventure. She has her flights of whimsy – cast your mind back to her disastrous experiment with giant-hunting,’ Lizzy chimes in with a laugh. ‘The girl is quite mad, isn’t she?’
Harry dreams of the beach at dusk, the sand somehow black beneath his bare feet. He stands at the very edge of the waves, watching blurry grey figures board a boat. He senses someone next to him, and turns. A man who looks like Sirius is staring at him in confusion, brows deeply furrowed.
‘Let’s write to Dumbledore ourselves,’ Father blurts. ‘The Headmaster loves his causes and campaigns, doesn’t he? The old man will give us a listen at the very least – you know how Gryffindors love their fair play.’
Potter was indeed with Dumbledore. They arrived on broomsticks, sweeping over the crenelated ramparts and landing not two metres away from Draco. By the sickly green light of the Dark Mark, Dumbledore looked ghastly. He was pale – too pale – and he listed to one sight, clutching that horrible blackened hand of his to his chest. Potter looked up at the Dark Mark, his face fixed in a rictus of fear.
He regretted it the moment he allowed himself to think it. Sickened, he sat down heavily at the foot of his bed, covering his face with his hands. Potter always had a way of crawling beneath his skin, seething there like baneberry poison.
To which he replies: ‘I must presume that you reveal such a weighty secret to me only with two intentions. One, you wish to kill me, and since I will be silent forever, it does not matter what I know. Two, you wish to marry me, for this is a secret I must know in order to be part of your family. If you were to reject my second proposal, you might as well kill me, for I do not think my heart could bear losing you once more.’
Draco obeys, squeezing his hands into fists, focussing his mind on the rush of air through his nose and down his throat and out of his mouth again. His heartbeat is thunderous in his ears, but he feels he can think again, through the screaming terror that he cannot feel Harry’s presence. He opens his eyes to see the two professors watching him, Dumbledore with an odd glimmer in his wise blue eyes.
Draco’s head is spinning. He has never experienced such a thing, the sensation as if the very earth is sliding beneath his feet. People are saying such things about him and his family? He clasps his hands together to steady himself, focussing his mind on the heat between his palms. ‘Of course I’m real,’ he blurts unthinkingly.
Harry, watching him, his mouth suddenly dry and his palms sweaty again, imagines a cloudless summer’s day in a flowering garden, a slice of sticky-sweet apple pie in his hands and joy warm and buzzing in his heart. Dizzily, he wonders if he might have asked the wrong question.
Potter looked at him and Draco saw that monster lurking behind his Boy Hero façade. Something wrenched within Draco’s chest. He had to clench his trembling hands to stop from reaching out for Potter.
His sisters were not directly involved in the battles against the Knights for Freedom. Harry had expressly forbidden it. While his sisters are very much their own persons with determined opinions and powers, they must concede to him on matters of war, because he had proven himself at seventeen by commanding the resistance during the siege of Hogwarts by the Knights. The Aurors finally freed them after three months. Lizzy was unable to hold out against Harry on account of a long recovery from the grievous injuries suffered from plunging half-starved into that final rout against the Knights. It hence came to be only Harry, Ron and Hermione who joined the Aurors in the long fight against the insidious order.
“Well, yeah, you haven’t exactly talked enough for it to be considered fighting,” Weasley wrinkled his nose. “Nah, you two gits are just enjoying making yourselves miserable, aren’t you?”
Jane studies him, a wry smile on her face. ‘You are giving me a warning, are not you? You think there will be a possibility we might get thrown together again.’
Lizzy explains her absoprtion with Wickham’s conversation with alacrity the next day. She describes to Harry and Jane with glee Darcy’s alleged transgressions towards the other gentleman, painting an image of a cruel, jealous man who kept Wickham’s rightful inheritance from him. Harry and Jane are uneasy with the vindictiveness in Lizzy’s eyes.
‘What do you think?’ Harry asks, waving vaguely around the room. ‘It’s not much, but it’s the best I could find on short notice, and I thought we should stay in a wizarding village, you know, it’ll be easier for you. We can move when we find somewhere better.’
. Draco realised he was hungry too. The lunch he had at St Mungo’s seemed bland and poor in comparison to the stir-fried chicken, fluffy chives-and-chorizo omelette, roast buttered potatoes, and fresh peas and carrots Potter served up.
Narcissa Malfoy leaves with Bellatrix Lestrange’s body—Andromeda refuses to even look at it—but Draco stays by Harry’s side, his claws and wings still splattered with blood. He doesn’t speak, and growls at anyone who comes too close. Harry doesn’t mind, because when the wailing rises to the rafters of the Great Hall, where their fallen heroes are laid, he is desperate for any distance he can get.
‘Like you think they’re lesser than you because they’re poor! The Weasleys have more integrity and honour than your entire family have in a single little fingernail.’
There is a candy shop with cages of all sorts of sweet confections in the form of animals, barking and roaring and bellowing. There is a pet shop right next to it with actual animals in the window: cats with luxurious fur that glows red one second, and blue the next. There is a broom shop with a single golden broom in the window, accompanied by a sign that reads: ‘Nimbus 2000’.
The grand estate has been let at last to a young man of large fortune from the north of England, and Mr. Henry has been obliged by his mother to visit him. Mr. Bennet was very direct in his refusal to wait upon a Muggle; Mrs. Bennet would surely have acquiesced with his haughty disregard of Muggles, if the man were not so wealthy.
It is rare now for the two families to sit down for dinner together. Remus has been sent to make connections with other werewolves, persuading them away from Voldemort’s poisonous rhetoric, while Sirius is working with the Malfoys to analyse whom in the pureblood society could they turn from the Death Eaters. Lucius, too, often sits with Dumbledore behind impenetrable doors to dredge up what he remembers of his former lord.
Instead of drawing away, Potter clutched his hand more tightly. ‘I have to tell Dumbledore this, you know.’
Draco knows the source of that sickly-sweet stench now: this scrawny, bespectacled, dark-haired boy standing to him. If he thought the smell in Ollivanders was bad, it is far,
‘Are we doing this here?’ Draco asks with a giddy, high-pitched laugh. ‘I’m afraid my problem is a little more complicated than a ten-minute consultation would entail. You will need to invite me in for tea. At your home.’
Filch came for them two hours later. They had spent thirty minutes arguing and the rest of it snogging. Draco was lying on Potter, his erection straining in his pants, and wondering if it was too soon to offer Potter a blowjob. Once or twice, Draco could feel Potter’s cock pressing against his hip, but Potter always moved away.
Harry smoothens out the paper; it’s a little crinkled from how hard he pressed in to keep his handwriting neat. He can’t wait to show Sirius what he has done. It was
‘Well, I see that I must place you in Gryffindor. Very well, you are not lacking in courage after all. So be it—
is crashing to the ground next to the omega, cuddling the other boy in close, babbling about the Draco constellation and the star within it he was named for, and Draco's destined companion Hercules wheeling in the starry skies above their naked bodies. He said he would name his omega
A thought flashes across his mind, blinding in its clarity: this is the reason why Harry himself has such an acute sense for Draco, why his wand with its Veela hair core heats up in Draco’s presence. They say omegas and alphas are naturally drawn to each other—their biology demands it. Harry is after all, omega, and Draco is alpha, Veela,
Harry groans, dropping his hands to Draco’s hips, his fingers hot against the skin. Their eyes meet, Harry’s eyes molten with heat and desire. Draco’s stomach clenches, a heat stirring in his belly.
him. As he waits for his turn, he wonders how his parents might react when they find out he’s in Gryffindor.
‘There are many things I would like to be for you,’ Harry replies, cupping Draco’s face in his hands.
‘No, no, I don’t mean you aren’t good at Potions and fighting and all the other things, but you aren’t very aware of the things around you. Come on, I’m sure your friends have called you blind before?’
‘No,’ Regulus brushes his question aside impatiently. ‘But if the Dark Lord is still alive, everyone is still in danger! What have you done, boy?’
Fred and George have been looking at each other shiftily. Fred nudges his brother, who leans forward to announce grandly: ‘Secret passageways.’ They have the attention of the group now. Fred picks up the thread: ‘We found this map in Filch’s office,’ —everyone ignores Hermione’s outraged ‘Were you sneaking?’ — ‘and it shows us all the passageways and corridors in Hogwarts,
“Here you go,” Potter handed him a glass of blood-red wine. “Elf-made wine. Made by Kreacher himself. Apparently, it’s a Black family special.”
But it is a good thing Harry sees into Voldemort’s head, because the Order’s missions are getting more dangerous. More Death Eaters and their supporters have, like termites, come crawling out of the woodwork. There are even a few of them in the Ministry itself, paying lip service to the paranoid Fudge and spying on Order members like Shacklebolt and Tonks.
way of living. I am not about to give up my work for a chance at love. Yet he is a most lovely man … I have not met any other man with his sweetness and patience in temperament.’
me.’ He gave a bark of acerbic laughter; Zabini involuntarily cringed. ‘Get out of my room, Zabini.’
“I’ll talk to Harry tomorrow. I need tonight to … to think about this,” Draco said. “I won’t leave Theo’s house, I promise. You can set the wards there and everything. Harry can’t possibly blame you if you got me talking to him again, can he?”
“Yeah … and … and I’m so relieved you feel the same way,” Harry was flushing. “The potion – I used a strand of my hair. I thought I … I could anchor your soul to me, to this world, so you wouldn’t – wouldn’t die. I didn’t understand the implications until Healer Mitra explained afterwards. By then it was too late … still, I couldn’t have allowed you to die.”
Harry licks his lips nervously, tapping his wand against his thigh. ‘Well, I didn’t think you would like to live with my godfathers, or your mother … unless you
As they walk on, Draco looks doubtfully at Father’s former acquaintances standing across the street. The children look like witless buffoons, gawping at him and flushing when their eyes meet. He remembers Father mentioning the names
He licks his lips, tasting the ash on them, eyes fixed on the cauldron. He has not moved from the spot he landed in. His limbs are quivering, bone-deep. He cannot move. Salazar, he has come to the final moment, and
Harry hears from Ron how Draco and George dream up the most brilliant and awful jokes over beers in the flat above the shop; how he gleefully demonstrates the latest jokes on himself in the front of the shop, and Draco’s Demo Hour becomes one of their best attractions; how the shop—and Diagon Alley in general—is seeing patronage from magical creatures who have always been part of wizarding society, but on its fringe, and the merchants, savvy as ever, have started offering more diverse wares.
Red-faced, Harry stumbles to join Granger and Longbottom, glancing apologetically at Draco as he goes. Like everybody else, Harry expects a Malfoy to be a Slytherin. Draco knows that is what his parents expect as well, all the more because they
, the Forbidden Forest black behind him, he is almost a hinkypunk – a smudge of wispy white smoke – except that the magical creature would turn solid under direct light. A ghoul, or a boggart then: Harry has unwittingly attracted its attention in a forest teeming with creatures classified XXXX and above.
The king exhales, rolling his eyes. "Is it foolish that I doubt you mean truly to poison your omega?"
Harry pulled away, breathing heavily, pushing his glasses back on properly. Luc blinked up at him, looking dazed. He searched that dark-eyed, snub-nosed, round face desperately, his fingers digging into the flesh of Luc’s upper arms.
‘So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have feared my interference? You realise that, had anybody else failed to come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there, Draco –’
Draco’s room for the next week was right across the hallway from Potter’s own. His civil “Thank you” was received with a glare, and Potter went stomping back down the stairs.
‘You’d rather pretend friendship is something noble and selfless. Nobody is selfless in this world, Potter. We are only ever do things for our own benefit.’
; the words echo in his head. He clenches his fist, the heat from the Veela wand still tingling on his fingertips. Inhaling sharply, he picks it up, and this time, when the wand sears against his palm, he doesn’t drop it. The heat dissipates into gentle warmth that feels almost like a handshake. Harry releases a shaky breath. He could use this wand.
you really Draco Malfoy? Why aren’t you using your wand?’ Harry nods towards the other man’s right hand.
couldn’t be held responsible for what he said when they were alone together. Draco hadn’t taken a drop of Amortentia from Potter. Everything Draco had said, he had meant, and Potter knew it.
was the one who brought him here, wasn’t she? It seemed that the planning committee hardly needed any more help; they had most of the details of the ball ironed out, and it was only when they needed a “fresh eye” or “outsider’s opinion” that they sought Harry’s or Luc’s.
Does she know what she has done by bringing him here, to these green windswept hills, where if he flies high enough, he can see the ocean glinting on sunny days?
A cloud drifted away and moonlight lanced down on them and Potter recoiled. The yearning Draco saw on his face collapsed into horror when he realised whom he was about to kiss. Draco felt his chest break wide open, his insides grey-pink and slimy with gore and gristle. Potter was already stumbling backwards, shaking his head in disbelief, brandishing his broom like a sword. He twisted around, about to flee like a clawless kitten.
The house elves are rather alarmed at Draco’s naked state in this chilly weather, and they hurry to dress him. Once he is dressed, Draco asks for parchment and pen – he’s going to write a letter. Dumbledore is the man who holds the power now, and Malfoys have never been above appealing to those in power.
He looks further down the beach. There is a boat in the water, its hull resting on the sand, and people are getting on. There are others sitting in the sand, watching the boat, most of them alone. One or two are looking at him with vague interest, as if trying to figure out if they know him. They look away after a while.
guys, for Merlin’s sake! He had already done his bit, given up all he could to save everyone. Where did this
If it weren’t his … he thought back to his fight with Potter and how Granger had tossed their things higgledy-piggledy into the respective bags. So this had to be Potter’s.
by the people around them. It doesn’t make sense – does his father not go out for numerous meetings with this and that committee? Are owls not arriving with dinner and party invites every other day? Pansy has made a mistake, calling his family odd. He isn’t so sure he so eager to make her acquaintance now.
“Harry here is clearly your leader, and why repeat yourself three times when you could say it once and get the same response.”
He raised his glass and drank, and Michael did the same. And then Blaise held his eyes and kept drinking, and Michael did too until he was struggling with gulp and turning redder and redder under Blaise’s calmly assessing. He put the glass down with a gasp.
They were mates again. It was nice. It was fine. Harry wouldn’t push, whatever that meant. However much he wanted to.
Now that he had a lot of time to reflect on Draco without filling it up with sex or awkwardness, it was becoming apparent just how much he thought about him. The answer was too much. Every two seconds, approximately. He’d be doing something normal, like showering or eating his toast, and suddenly he’d be wondering about what Draco was like as a baby. His lecturer would mispronounce something or the muggle girl who sat in front of him in philosophy would wear a particularly ugly outfit and he’d suddenly be full of anticipation for what Draco might say about it. And then there was the wanking, of course. He tried to vary it up to stop himself from becoming a complete sad sack. He’d start off very deliberately thinking of Charlie Weasley’s calloused hands or the way Hannah had looked in her little skirt last night, and he’d always end up back on Malfoy, twisting up the sheets as he got fucked.
There was a lot in that statement that Harry didn’t think he had time to unpack. “Uh, it’s just sex. I think. And she might be seeing Terry Boot too.”
“I don’t think I can,” said Dean, his voice hollow. “I think I may be finally, officially out of tears. Hooray for me, right?”
“I dunno. I might be a better student, I suppose.” He scoured a line into the tabletop with his fingernail. “I like to think we wouldn’t have hated each other as much. Gryffindor and Slytherin. I mean yeah, you were pretty shitty pre-teens. But I bet you were a cool seventeen year old aside from the blood prejudice. Some of the stories Blaise tells are pretty funny. Sometimes I wish - “ He stopped.
“I started shagging Potter,” said Draco, nodding wisely. “And his personality vastly improved, and your gratitude overwhelmed your good sense.”
“He’s a good person, right? They all are. They’re all such good people, and that means that anything they do to the evil people like us is justified. He is Ron Weasley, hero of the wizarding world, and he doesn’t end up with a girl like you. Do you really think you could give him what he wants, Pansy? He was with Granger. That’s who he wants. He wants babies and domesticity and uncomplicated goodness, and I’m sorry, Pans, but that’s not you.”
“Won,” said Hermione bitterly. “Well, I broke up with Ron, so I guess no one wins this round.” Parvati was looking away into the distance, her eyes glimmering.
“Ding ding ding! He really is smarter than he looks, Corner. And much handier with a wand. After all, he killed Voldemort. I can’t imagine he would have much difficulty killing you.”
“If I didn’t want to talk to you, I wouldn’t be here, would I?” said Dean. Harry edged along, driven by unquenchable nosiness. Dean and Seamus were encamped behind a pair of mini firs, looking furious.
“Goldstein,” said Hermione through her hands. “And it was really bloody good, Harry. I mean, not to imply that Ron wasn’t – “
“Well, I suppose I can always just set myself on fire,” he said, and strode away from the bar, leaving her to pay for his hideously expensive whiskey.
Finally, this chapter might be a little shorter than the others, and the next one will be too. They were initially one super chapter, but it got so long that I felt they needed to be split up.
“Well, from what I remember, that can’t have been too bad. Hey, do you remember the day you duelled me in the DA? You were terrifying. I think you were still sore from beating Ron earlier.”
“Get in,” said Draco. “We were all doing what you were doing, and then we all heard what you heard, and then we all did what you did. And now we’re all in here.”
“You mad bastard, you can’t think I - “ He was cut off by a scream, as Blaise pressed his foot back down on his broken knee.
“Being in a stable relationship,” said Hermione, “with someone who can actually talk about feelings.”
Harry caught his wrist in his hand. “It’s not cowardice. I’m going to be absolutely thrilled the day that I get to stand next to you and introduce you as my boyfriend, but it’s ok for me to wait. I’ll think of it as something to look forward to.”
“Yeah,” said Blaise. “The other day I was daydreaming. You know what I normally daydream about? Filthy, terrible things. Sometimes even filthy things involving you. But on this occasion I started day dreaming about our wedding, Susan. Our wedding. I’ve planned the colour scheme. It’s going to be beautiful and you’re only allowed to plan the seating chart because you’re good at politics but your aesthetic sense is terrible.”
Harry took his hand, guided it to the faint lightning scar on his chest that matched the one on his forehead. “When I walked into the forest – I felt relieved then too.”
“I don’t think I can change either.” He stared down the depths of the bottle. “I think I’m just Harry forever. No one seems to need Just Harry anymore.”
“Then let me explain some things to you,” said Theo. “Maybe he gets on with you now. Hell, Potter and Malfoy get on, stranger things have happened. Maybe he’d even like to fuck you, Pansy. But you do not get the boy. You do not get this happy ending that you seem to have constructed in your head. He will use you for sex and chuck you over for a lark and laugh it up with his Gryffindor mates about the time he actually got under the skin of the ice bitch of Slytherin.”
Susan rolled his eyes but accepted his arm with good grace, and when Harry turned back to Draco he was disappearing through the door with Ron, who shot him a thumbs up.
She eyed him. “It’s never going to not be weird, you know. You two being friends. How do you do it?”
“Hello,” said the exquisitely pretty blonde from the Slytherin set, appearing next to Morag. “You’re Morag MacDougal, aren’t you?”
Harry threw up his hands. “Fine! Fuck both of you. I’m going to go and try to get my shitshow back on the road. Blaise, good luck with your weird romantic plans. Pansy, try talking to people without veiled threats, it might get you somewhere.”
“No, you don’t. But you’ve got tension. Ohhh, it was sexual tension. It was sexual tension all along.”
“Is the penalty having to drink an appletini like we’re divorced suburbanites in the nineteen-eighties?”
“If all that’s separating you from sucking Zabini’s cock is a drink or two, maybe you’re not that straight,” said Dean. He was snarling now.
“I think Susan probably doesn’t need a nightcap.” There was Anthony, face resolute. “Why don’t you sit outside with us and have some fresh air?”
The thought of getting off with someone else didn’t seem terribly appealing, now that he thought about it. But it wasn’t like he could keep doing this forever – hanging around Draco and stealing these little moments. Eventually he’d have to find someone serious, wouldn’t he? Unless he and Draco – no. That wouldn’t happen.
“What, cause I’m so thick?” said Harry. “Says something about you that you were beaten by me, doesn’t it?”
“This is going to end in tears,” muttered Morag, and Harry grabbed the joint out of Dean’s hand and took a toke like a normal person, thank you very much.
“Because it will be interesting,” he said, as Pansy scoffed. “Anyway, I want to see what a Weasley club is like. I promise to send you all the dirty details.”
hug her and tell her that of course she was pretty, there were loads of blokes out there who would be lucky to have her. And he’d be biased because he had to say that, and she would know that, but it would probably still cheer her up a bit. She picked up her coat and opened the door, determined to make the best of today, and found Draco Malfoy out there, standing stiff as a board.
“All right. In that case, I definitely pulled you here so that I could have my wicked way with you.” That got him a watery laugh and a middle finger. “Look, Pansy. I’ll try and talk to Draco tonight, all right? But – I cannot stress this enough – he will likely tell me to fuck off and die. So no promises.”
“Closer to Engineering,” said Dean, “but close enough.” He dropped his voice. “Metollagy. Hermione, I assume you’re doing ‘law’. Harry?”
Harry nodded, because as far as he could tell giving advice was just saying vague statements and letting people draw what they wanted from them. Blaise considered his words for a second, or possibly just considered the wine. Then he suddenly jumped up, with a little ‘a-ha!’ that struck Harry, hysterically tired, with a new fit of giggles.
Seamus scoffed. “Yeah, but that would upset Dean.” His face changed from scowling to sad. “I don’t want to upset Dean. I just keep doing it. I’m poison, ‘Mione. I fuck up everything I touch.”
She didn’t want to, not really. She’d never thought that she and Parvati would have much in common – but she’d never thought she could be a Ravenclaw heart throb, either, or apart from Ron, or apologised to by Draco Malfoy.
Because there was Malfoy. Getting off. With a boy. He was pushed up onto the counter, his arms twined round the back of one of the Ilvermony lads, pushing into him with little rolls of his hips. He was moaning, actually moaning, pornographic and deliberate and probably much better than Harry sounded when he was having sex. His mouth was on the boys neck, nuzzling in, pulling back with a soft wet sound and leaving behind a bruised purple mark.
He raises his head. Draco watches him, his eyes searching, scrutinising, picking up the pebbles he sees and examining them, wondering if he might toss them into the lake to see what he disturbs. The smile is gone from his face, leaving behind only thoughtfulness.
Potter wasn’t in bed tonight. He was in the air, lapping the pitch again and again on his Firebolt, head thrown back, dark hair streaming in the wind. Draco stood under the bleachers and watched that improbable creature gleaming under moonlight through the wooden poles and slats, arms wrapped tightly around himself against the cold.
‘I asked Minnie, and she told me they—his parents—have made public apologies, and they donated to the country’s rebuilding after the war,’ Harry says, a stubborn edge to his tone. ‘I don’t—I don’t want to start school having already made an enemy, Pads. I … I would rather try to be friends with Draco.’
‘And I’m going to take it a step further,’ Zabini announces, and swiftly licks his thumb before swiping it against Harry’s neck.
Silence fell between them, Draco’s head drooping, Harry knotting the leather cord. He held out the bracelet, the bead threaded through. ‘Give me your hand.’
Harry’s lips are cool and dry—and soft. Draco is astonished by the lightning that bolts through him from the merest of touches: pleasure heating his blood. He wants more, but Harry is recoiling, looking at him with utmost horror.
‘Up the stairs and first doors to the left,’ Zabini replies promptly, his smirk widening into a grin. ‘But before you go, Bennet, are you certain your house elf desires a mate? For my acquaintance would be extremely reluctant to let their house elf enter a household that does not want it.’
"We?" he echoes, and makes a show of glancing up and down the line of Gryffindors. "I have never fucked alphas before, but I suppose if that is the price you demand for us to keep our lives, I would pay it."
Harry stared, taken aback by how small Luc had felt beneath his hand and the demented rage obvious on Luc’s face. The other man was pointing his wand in Harry’s face, hand shaking uncontrollably.
He is struggling more with the suppressant potion he must take every month: a black, viscous liquid that tastes of oil and milk. He has to choke it down, eyes watering, under the eyes of Professor Severus Snape, the greasy-haired man who teaches Potions at Hogwarts. Harry didn’t think he could dislike someone as much as the Dursleys, but Snape comes close. The man has the nerve to speak to Minnie with such derision about the desperate state of Gryffindor House, which she used to be Head of before she left Hogwarts to take care of Harry.
‘No,’ he said and something on Potter’s face relaxed, as if he had dreading Draco’s answer. He didn’t probe further, merely nodded and waited for Draco to ask his question.
Harry stepped in front of him, forcing the other man to stop. He was inexplicably annoyed. Luc’s words reminded him of what Luna had said that night in the pub and rang with the accusations of prejudice Zabini had unfairly hurled at him last week. Harry
That was the undeniable truth: when you were a hero, the world remade itself to bring you anything you could need to slay monsters; when you were an inconsequential character, the world either erased you or remade you into one of its monsters to be slayed.
‘I don’t need it,’ he mutters, tugging his arm in a futile effort against Draco’s strength. ‘I’m fine, Malfoy. Let go.’
Draco knows it’s true: he smells Ginny Weasley on Harry far too often. It’s not deliberate; human alphas have too weak a sense of smell to be able to discern the pheromones they release. Instead, they sense on a primal level the pheromones that announce a rival alpha, or imply an alpha’s lover. Ginny and Neville probably don’t realise they have been inadvertently marking Harry.
Draco is bucking his body closer to Harry, desperate hands tearing at sweater and trousers, whimpering for bare skin and closeness and heat and friction. Harry is laughing again, swatting Draco’s hands away— ‘
His cock hardened further. His throat was tight. He could only shake his head. He lined his cock up against Potter’s cleft. Potter’s eyes widened. Then Draco started moving, slipping his cock in and out between the cheeks of Potter’s beautiful arse. Potter relaxed instantly, dropping his head back onto his arm, tightening his arse obligingly.
‘He was cold to Pansy and I when Draco first introduced us,’ Zabini is saying, smirking in the direction of Darcy. ‘It is better now, but I doubt the man will ever be easy around us. He is an exceedingly private gentleman, who prefers not to seek the company of strangers. He does like Draco though – perhaps because of how quiet and inoffensive Draco is now, that wretched creature. He condescends to be civil to Pansy and I. I wonder at his eagerness to be near Miss Elizabeth Bennet.’
The older man is surprised. ‘Ah, you don’t know what it means. Well, that is fine. I am Mathis, and you will be coming with me. This is quite enough of acting the child. What are you thinking, throwing a tantrum like this!’
Draco is bored. He sits next to his mother, kicking his foot against the table leg, ignoring her warning looks. They are at Mrs Parkinson’s tea party, sitting at dainty round tables in the middle of perfectly manicured gardens. The ladies are making mind-numbingly dull conversation over tasteless tea and bland cakes. He has eaten at least seven of those little cakes, and watched the dragon shrub cavort around them for the tenth time already.
‘Right, I’m sure that will go down well,’ Draco said sarcastically. ‘Good evening, Madam Pomfrey, say, my Dark Mark isn’t healing, do you think you can do something about it? I need it in case the Dark Lord would like to summon me to do his bidding. Oh yes, Potter,
. He does not wait before striding out of the dining room, ignoring the guards he startles on the other side of the door.
This is inconceivable, the sight of Malfoy in his bedroom, lips kiss-bruised, looking as if he likes nothing better than to hit Harry with a
Before Draco could think, Snape raised his wand and pointed it at Dumbledore’s chest. His hand was shaking.
‘I don’t need your pity,’ Harry says harshly, eyes diamond-bright, steel-sharp. ‘I don’t need you to say those things
And those wretched nights he spent weeping into pillows, weak and grey, feeling as if the heat suppression potion has sucked the magic from his bones—all for the sake of defeating Voldemort, to protect the omega. Harry was only ever a weapon, and it was never because he was innately talented or powerful; it was only because of a fucking mistake Voldemort made—the Dark Lord was his own undoing.
Draco met his dark, smouldering eyes and remembered a messy kiss that tasted of Butterbeer. Jonas was the first man he fucked, but Zabini was the first boy he kissed.
Harry shakes his head, and tries again; the distinction is important to make. ‘But we aren’t boyfriends or lovers or whatever. It’s only—because we were apart for so long. It’s only because we’re soulmates.’
‘Hullo! Another first year? You’ll be wanting the standard set of robes, I suppose?’ she asks energetically, her eyes already taking Harry’s measurements. ‘Well, come along then. I’ll get you sorted out. Don’t have any siblings, I suppose? No hand-me-downs to take advantage of?’
Minnie is gratified by the attention. She was excited when she announced at dinner a few months ago that she shall be returning to Hogwarts to teach, but she had added, rather cynically: ‘Ah, but it has been six years. I wonder if my teaching techniques are still up to scratch.’
Growing up in the exclusive society of pureblood British wizards and witches, there weren’t many gay wizards around Draco’s age, so Jonas was the first man he ever had.
. Dead, and Draco helped to kill him. Potter’s face softened. He moved in close to Draco, brushing Draco’s face gently where he had hit him earlier with the same hand.
‘Lizzy!’ Jane and Harry exclaim, the former in outrage and the latter in dismay, as Kitty gives a shriek of laughter.
,’ Creevey says, his tone caught between wonder and devastation. ‘That was what I told him when he sneaked off – that I would kill him if he does not come back. I
‘Right,’ Harry says, a little disappointed; he thought Malfoy had noticed him especially. ‘So … what’s your favourite pudding?’
Mother nodded briskly, looking down at her plate. She was fastidiously cutting up her kippers. ‘I’m thinking of paying them a visit.’
It was a glass bead, shaped like a teardrop with a hole through the round middle. Harry took it, surprised by its warmth. Draco looked over his shoulder, at Moaning Myrtle’s usual haunting spot.
The worst of his agonies: two lines on his back, slashing down in an upside-down V. The skin is smooth there, no outward sign of trauma. The pain is deep down in his bones, a hot ache that throbs with every movement.
Draco ignores him. A few other Veelas have come and looked at him with the same fascination one would give a caged Manticore. They have tried talking to him, meaningless words about
The other Slytherins noticed too. Pansy would gleefully deride Potter, looking at Draco hopefully, but Draco wouldn’t join in. Much as it thrilled him to truly have a one-up over Potter, he couldn’t expend the effort to poke fun at the Boy Who Lived anymore. Working on the Cabinet was taking over every waking minute of his life.
Potter stared at him, eyes bright, muscles taut on his neck. It was silent between them for a long while, neither breaking his gaze.
“You have heard of Ravijojla? Yes. When her king would not have her, she had to settle for being his sister. It is a painful existence, being unable to claim your Heart’s Desire. She eventually killed herself; the pain of seeing him with another was too much to bear.”
“She tells us you are learning wandcraft from Ollivander’s now,” Granger said, pulling out a chair next to her.
But of course, the women had their own reasons for rejecting Mrs Zabini. Draco had seen Zabini’s photos of his mum: sloe-eyed, satiny brown skin, waves of shiny black hair – all the ingredients for a woman any man would take the chance with despite knowing her (wealthy) exes were somehow all dead. Zabini was tight-lipped on that subject, but Draco got the inkling that it was a family curse.
And Bellatrix fell. Aunt Andromeda broke off with a savage wail, turning away into Uncle Ted’s arms, and they both sobbed. Mother stared down at her sister’s broken body, and with a brutality Draco didn’t expect, kicked the corpse hard. She looked up and met Draco’s eyes with a frosty, steely glare. Narcissa Malfoy is not a woman anyone should cross.
Draco will never get used to how exuberantly Harry greets his godfathers, no matter how many times he sees when they pick him up at the train station at the end of term. It makes his parents’ reception seems so cold—an enquiry about his train ride, a gentle pat on the back; but their smiles tell him enough about how glad they are to have him home.
“What? Oh, your explanation, not Pansy’s reasoning. Sorry, that’s still bullshit. Two-hundred-and-eighty-people for one – fine, I get that. I was ready to make the same bargain, ok? But she wasn’t just for giving me up, she was ready to surrender to Voldemort and let him win. How many creatures are there in the magical world, Malfoy? More or less than two-hundred and eighty? Kind of throws Pansy’s calculations off a bit, doesn’t it? What about the Muggles? There’s eight billion of them in the world, apparently. When would Voldemort have stopped?”
“Oh, all right then,” said Harry, trying to put on some good cheer. “I was only going to unpack anyway. We can save that for tomorrow.”
“I figured. Everyone in there won’t stop looking at me like I’m about to fall to my knees and wail ‘oh god why’.”
Hermione felt her cheeks burn, and pushed past the two of them. Behind her, Parvati was hissing something at her sister. She didn’t know what that meant, and honestly? She didn’t care. What? You’re going to have a good year because you’re such a bookworm, Hermione? You’re going to have a good year (sarcastic) you sad sack? You’re going to have a good year  - because you weren’t paying attention to your precarious stack of books, and have now accidentally clocked someone in the chest with one, apparently.
Hermione wrinkled her nose. “I don’t think we should treat our first year of academic studies as an excuse to drink constantly – “
“Oh Jesus,” said Draco. “He’s not going to propose, is he? I understand he’s in love, but really, it’s a little early.”
“I’m sorry,” he said, to Harry’s questioning look. “It’s just – if they see me holding your arm, you know what they’ll say. I didn’t realise they’d be here. Stupid of me, of course. You – you don’t want that.”
Harry had sent a Patronus up to her, but she’d sent one back down announcing that she was very busy setting up her room, and could they maybe turn the music down?  “Nah, she’s busy. She was talking earlier about optimising the space in her room for learning.”
Malfoy was aiming to hurt, but there was nothing there to wound. Harry smiled. “We were never really together. And then we were definitely never together, because she realised she’s a lesbian.” And then he waited for Draco to say something hideous so he could hex him.
“Are those frills around the neckline?” said Susan. “God, they are. Who’s still wearing frills in this day and age?”
The thought was like poison, curling round his heart. Why did he care? Nice and friendly, just like Hermione had said. That’s what they’d been. That’s what Draco had been trying to tell him, when he called him
So Michael did. And he drank. He told them that Susan had been a frightfully dull conversationalist as he finished off the bottle. He told them that she was acting far too picky for someone with a body like that as Blaise called for more whiskeys. He told them that he’d been a perfect gentleman all night, and it wasn’t his fault she didn’t appreciate that as she should, while Blaise nodded and made soothing sounds and announced that that called for a round of shots. He told them, over and over, that he’d only been trying to be nice, that she was probably a fucking virgin anyway. And he drank, and drank and drank while Blaise smiled darkly and poured his own drinks away when Michael wasn’t looking.
“A few letters. I don’t have a lot of time to write, and from the sounds of it neither does she. She must be pretty busy studying, I guess.”
“I don’t know. It would feel a bit like hiding from the past, you know?” He leant into the warmth of Harry’s shoulder. “I am serious about making amends. Let’s not talk about it.”
