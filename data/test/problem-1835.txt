Hermione
“Not here. Mother will have a fit if she hears about this and can’t fuss over me herself! We should go back, and I’ll go to St Mungo’s.” Draco looks down at the bandage. “But I don’t think I can Apparate or Floo. I don’t want to risk it starting to bleed again while we’re in transit. I’ll be fine on my broom, as long as we don’t fly too high and fast.”
“Reducto!”
“I already got it. And a set of flying robes.”
Draco Malfoy gives you your orders? Does he take part in the meetings you told me about?
“Are you sure about this?” Draco asks. ”We’re going against everything we’ve been taught… I mean, I’m purposely destroying an ancient magical artefact, and you’re destroying evidence. If this gets out we’ll probably both get fired. Or worse.”
The boat bumps gently against a tiny sliver of sandy coastline hidden by the cliffs. There’s nothing here except a wooden post, overgrown with slimy seaweed, and a rough path leading further inland. Malfoy fumbles a little with the rope, but, in the end, he manages to get the boat tied securely to the post. Harry turns toward the path, but Malfoy doesn’t follow him.
“Let me try,” he says, and draws his wand.
“I suppose not. Think it’s fake?”
Draco pulls back enough to stare at him, and Harry has to force himself to meet his eyes. A rejection now is going to hurt like hell, and it’s not only his pride that’ll be smarting, he realises.
"No. But I think I know why you do. You're a half-blood. I think that's why it’s reacting to you. I can disable it, but I may need your help."
Harry stares at the small print on the memo-plane, and bangs his head against his desk in frustration. Ron pokes his head around the flimsy wall separating their cubicles.
“Yeah, I know. I am. And a night out will be fun.”
When they get back to Level Two, the Polyjuice is starting to wear off. Ron shrugs on his robes and slumps in his chair.
“Yeah. Hang on. I’ll tell Davies to get a hold of someone from Creatures.”
The second they’re gone, he twists around in the chair to look at Draco. He’s leaning against a cupboard, one jeans-clad leg folded over the other, and looking oddly relaxed in the Grangers’ very mundane kitchen.
“Who the fuck made you the boss?” Matt mutters, but he starts stacking the stones more carefully.  The hole grows rapidly, and a few minutes later, Bludger starts rummaging in his pockets. He takes out a small, unassuming package. It’s square, flat and wrapped in an old pillowcase with bubbling cauldrons on it. He sets it down on the pile of stones and points his wand at it.
“Harry?” Ron shakes his shoulder, and he straightens up. There’s a bit of a drool spot on his forearm, where he’s been resting his head. But, luckily, the casefile underneath is dry. He wipes at the corner of his mouth.
There are four people in the room, that he can see. Possibly more, but he doesn’t want to risk getting too close to the window.  He fumbles for Ron and carefully presses four fingers into his arm, one at the time. They’re all wearing black, hooded robes, and Harry almost laughs out loud. What a fucking cliché!
Adrian and Adrienne. Poor kids! Harry follows Ron into the fireplace and Jenkins throws down the Floo Powder, shouting Adrienne Wright’s address.
“Are you saying we should stop trying?”
¨”Why?” Ron asks.
“Do you want to rest up a bit before we go? It’s almost two hours of flying...”
“I don’t know. I’m feeling a bit dizzy,” Draco murmurs. His face is greyish and his eyes are wide and unfocused. Panicky. Fuck! He has to do something.
"Not because I want to. But I have obligations at home in the morning."
“Brooms?” His expression morphs from apprehension into confusion.
“Yes, Auror Potter, Sir. Blimpy didn’t see, but elf magic is not like human magic. Blimpy could tell!”
“Oh, leave them be,” chides a young girl in a glittering robe. “Young Draco’s hardly the first to bring a Blood Traitor into the house. Your great uncle Hector was a Weasley, wasn’t he?”
Malfoy is glaring at them with his arms crossed in front of him, and Harry can’t help noticing that doing manual labour has been really good for him. He’s slender, but not as thin as he was at Hogwarts. His chest and arms are looking perfectly sculpted, even concealed under a thick black jumper. He also can’t exactly help agreeing that he has a point. They’re essentially asking him to be their research assistant, without offering him anything in return. Not even a basic level of trust. Ron is shifting in his chair beside him, undoubtedly about to say something less than nice.
“Let’s put the Cloak on and go back there.”
We know you’re not doing this by yourself. Who gives orders to your acquaintance, Bludger?
Williamson’s voluminous belly sweeps his notepad off the table as he climbs to his feet. He’s got a cold and boring night ahead of him, and he doesn’t bother hiding his scowl. Someone snickers, but is cut off abruptly by Savage’s next bark of names.
“If it’s Draco’s word against Donovan’s, they’ll have to bring it to the Wizengamot.”
The door slides closed behind him, and he slumps against the wall, casting a thorough cleaning charm on his shoes. He’s probably going to get called into Savage’s office tomorrow and lectured about proper press etiquette. But really! Percy is so power hungry, he’s starting to wonder if he’s learned anything at all from his stint as one of Umbridge’s toadies. Ha! Toadies. He smirks at his own joke. The lift pings, and he steps out. Compared to the atrium, Level Two is a quiet haven. Gracie is using her wand to sort a stack of folders, and there are a few DMLE officers chatting over their desks, but no one seems to be in any great hurry. He catches Davies’ eye and sends him a smile and a wave, letting him know that he’s safely back. Then he makes his way to the Auror Department and sinks into his chair.
He pushes past Donovan, but he can’t escape the sound of his voice, as he calls after him.
Ron shrugs.
“But I don’t really want to have a blind date with an Unspeakable. What are we going to talk about? I’m telling her we’re busy with the case, but maybe when we’ve solved it.”
“I know, but ‘Mione, it’s not like you don’t know how to fight… and you’d be under the cloak...”
“Here you are.” He shows Ron a page in the book, and he copies it to his notepad.
“How’s it going?”
The warm curl in Harry’s belly spreads to his chest.
“Is that a yes?”
He opens the door to the Department of Mysteries. The room is empty, except for a bored young wizard in apprentice robes, guarding the door to the next room.
“Dismantle the wards, then stay back and let you do the actual search, and be ready to call the Aurors,” Draco summarises.
“Why can’t we just go ahead and steal the Mudbloods’ magic now?” Tanned Bloke supplies.
“Sure. Stand back. I’ll be right there.”
“I’m not,” Draco repeats. “I want to see where this leads. I just don’t think that it’s a good idea to go any further while everything else is still so chaotic.”
“Your father has been controlling the New Dawn from his cell. The guard who was hostile to you is Bludger’s brother. Your father used him to get messages to his minions. And Bludger might be hiding in your summer house in France.”
“You’re welcome. Now, try to stand up.”
Draco draws his wand and points it at his father’s temple. The memory is thin and immaterial, only a wispy curl of smoke, but it’s there. Harry holds out the vial he’s kept in his pocket, and Draco slips the memory inside.
He doesn’t meet with us. I reckon he doesn’t like getting his poncy hands dirty. But according to Bludger, our orders come from Malfoy.
Draco's mouth is sliding down his throat now. Kissing, licking, nipping. The small, playful bites are just hard enough to send jolts of pleasure and pain straight to his cock. He turns his head to give Draco better access to the soft skin over his collarbone, and lets his lips brush over a slender wrist, tasting the salty skin there. Draco's mouth stills and his body goes rigid. Harry opens his eyes and there it is, only centimetres from his face. The blurred smudge of the Mark is so close it doesn’t even form a recognisable picture. Draco's breath is coming in quick, shallow huffs. Harry leans in and very deliberately kisses the scarred skin. He can feel Draco tensing up even more, and then relaxing. He turns his head and kisses Draco's other wrist, and he feels more than hears him exhale a long, shuddering sigh. Draco’s hands tighten on his wrists, a warning to keep them where they are. He closes his eyes and gives in to the sensations Draco chooses to give him. Everything quickly becomes a blur of hot and sticky and more-yes-please-oh-fuck-now! until somehow he’s naked on his back with a pillow shoved under his arse, and he’s moaning as Draco sinks down on his cock. The tight heat makes him gasp, and Draco leans down and covers his mouth in a rough kiss.
They order their drinks and find a quiet table in a corner.
What the fuck is happening? Death Eater activity? Draco isn’t a Death Eater. He needs to get to the Ministry, right now. He grabs the first items of clothes he can find and throws them on, rips his uniform robes from the hanger and pulls them over his head, already walking towards the fireplace.
The young man looks up at Harry for the first time, curiosity written all over his face. Harry can tell exactly when he is recognised.
"That too." She waves a hand, as if wading through mud is a perfectly normal part of the job as an Unspeakable. Maybe it is. It’s not like he really knows anything about Unspeakables.
“Right. Savage was asking for you. I told her you were getting your injuries fixed and you’d check in when you got here.”
“Poor Hermione!”
“Yes, you probably should.”
“Harry!” He jumps to his feet and takes a few steps. But then he hesitates and a guarded look seeps into his eyes. Harry is itching to reach out and smooth that small frown line between his brows, but Draco has stopped in the middle of the small room, too far away to touch.
“Draco.”
There’s an elbow to his ribs, and when he looks over at Ron, he can just about make out the outline of his wand arm, and hear a whispered spell aimed at the windowpane. A tiny portion of the glass vanishes. Enough to feed a concealed Extendable Ear through. Ron hands him an end piece, and he quickly stuffs it into his own ear and sees Ron do the same. Then he turns his attention back to the people inside.
“It is a great comfort to me, to have Harry and my brother Ronald working with me here at the Ministry, to help ensure a safe environment for the average British witch and wizard.”
Ron looks sympathetic, but Harry knows that if Hermione has set her mind to something, he’ll  be powerless to stop her. It’s been six month since he came home to an empty flat and a letter from Philippe saying that he was moving back to Paris. He had hoped that Hermione would leave him alone for awhile yet, but hopefully a night out clubbing will be the extent of it. He really doesn’t want to become her next cause.
The heavy door creaks open, and then slams behind them. Harry looks up, and there he is, Lucius Malfoy, wearing the same tattered, dirty robes he had on when he was taken into custody after the Battle of Hogwarts, and the same haughty sneer. He’s sitting on a wooden stool, and his hands and feet are chained to iron rings in the floor. By his posture, he might as well be sitting on a throne.
“I… no. Not really. My friends persuaded me to come out with them tonight, actually.”
Harry checks his watch. It’s been almost an hour, and he really wants to punch Brigg in his stupid, smug mouth. He’s sitting there, smirking at them and refusing to answer questions, while his brother gets more and more time to slip away. Ron looks like he’s about ready to perform an unauthorised Legilimens, or maybe cast an Unforgivable. Which might be a really bad idea, since Savage is standing on the other side of the one way window behind him.
The way father and son stare at each other is so intense, he has to fight the urge to squirm or fidget with the tiny buttons on his sleeve. Finally, Lucius gives a minute nod.
“Can’t go back to Kitty,” Bludger says. “Boss says it’s not safe.”
“What’s that?”
Draco looks up, startled, and almost falls off the bench.
They say their goodbyes, and Ron grabs Hermione’s hand. She turns back, her hand already resting on the door knob. “I'll meet you tomorrow at the ministry, so we can get ready before the match. Draco, you’re taller than me, so you'll have to disillusion your feet when we're under the cloak.”
Ron’s smile dims at the sight of the overstacked desk.
Harry remembers too. There’s a vivid flash in his mind of scorching heat, wiry arms around his waist, a chest pressed against his back, and shallow puffs of breath in his ear. He shakes it off quickly. He hasn’t thought about Draco Malfoy in years, and he’s not about to begin now.
“Who are these people? The same meeting place? You’d think they would know we’ll be watching it. Actually, this is stupid enough, it might be a trap. Are you free to assist me?”
The Floo flashes, and Hermione steps out of the fireplace. She looks ten years older than she did a week ago. There are dark smudges under her eyes, and her hair has escaped from her usually neat bun and is framing her face in a frizzy mess of curls, but she still manages a small smile when she catches sight of him.
He gets up from his chair and gestures to the elf that she’s free to go. But before she can get up, a thought occurs to him.
Harry feels his lips tug up into a smile.
The whole stadium errupts in shouts and gasps, and Harry turns his head to the game. The Tornadoes beaters have just performed a stunning  Dopplebeater Defence, and Harry finds himself cheering and shouting without having to act at all. The bludger zooms towards one of the Wanderers beaters, who has his back turned, following the trajectory of the two seekers, as they fly side by side towards one end of the stadium. He gasps as the ball speeds towards  the oblivious man, but just as Harry is about to close his eyes to avoid having to watch the man’s skull split open, he turns and avoids it by a last second Sloth Grip Roll.
“Do you know why we’re here?”
The conference room isn’t free, but the small interview room on Level Two is. Ron takes the good chair, and Harry grudgingly sinks down in the uncomfortable one they usually give to suspects.
“Malfoy?”
“I don’t know. It’s not their family crest. I checked.”
Draco clears his throat and nods at the Pensieve that’s been set up on a low table next to his desk.
“Yes, ancient and dark. I spotted both Magick Moste Evile and Secrets of the Darkest Art.”
“Hermione’s just run to the shop for some dinner supplies,” he says, opening the fridge and pulling out a bottle of milk. “Seems we’re out of almost everything. Now, tell me about Lucius’ memory.”
Auror Potter,
“Draco Malfoy said you could use his house?”
Harry only just has time to kneel before a pair of small, round arms are flung around his neck, and his nose is buried in bushy red curls.
“There’s one at the library in the department of mysteries. And it’s clear of Dark magic, so we’ll be able to handle it.”
“Did you get his name?”
The lights in the club are dim, and the air is filled with multi-coloured smoke. The only well lit place is the small stage in the back, where a band is setting up. He spots Hermione and Ron at the bar, where Ron is talking animatedly to Seamus. Harry slips onto the stool next to Hermione, slinging an arm around her back in greeting.
“Hello, Rose. How are you?”
“Draco!” Hermione sounds exactly like she used to, when she reprimanded Harry and Ron back at school, and Harry can’t help smirking.
“Yes. Many years ago. Men in robes and masks came and asked about the book, and Mistress told them she didn’t know. And when they left, she told Blimpy they were not worthy and should leave us alone.”
“Thanks for the warning, mate.”
“Your emergency Portkeys. Put them in your pockets, and I’ll activate them for you. If you touch them, you’ll be transported to a secure room, and we’ll come and get you. Please keep them hidden from view at all times,” the guard instructs. “If you’ll please come with me, I’ll let you into the cellblock. The prisoner you’re interested in has been moved to the interview room at the end of the hall. It’s soundproof.” He smirks at Harry. “To ensure privacy.”
“Yes, Rosie. You have to wear socks. It’s cold. Look! There’s snow on the ground,” comes Hermione’s weary reply. This is obviously a conversation which has been going on for some time.
“Wait! This chapter is not about spells to help you become a thief.” She’s got Secrets of the Darkest Arts floating in front of her and is using her wand to turn the pages.
"I hope so. You can't feel the wards anymore?"
The study reminds Harry of Draco’s office at the museum, except there’s no sign of Muggle technology. He’s glad in a way. A laptop in Malfoy Manor would probably be one surreal thing too many on this already bizarre day. Besides, it’d probably blow up from all the magical energy inside the Manor.
"I can see why that might have been tempt- ah! Tobby, thank you."
“Er… still no magic, but at least I’m not in hospital.” His tone is casual, but the stoic look on his face isn’t quite convincing anyone.
Draco screams, and drops to the ground, and Harry’s blood runs cold.
Punching the stupid wanker in the face won’t get him to Draco, so he grits his teeth and shrugs.
“Potter?”
Ron looks at him like he’s grown an extra head.
“Fuck!”
“Fuck, I was stupid!” Draco murmurs against his lips. “Thinking I would be able to just put this out of my mind and go on like nothing happened.”
“Right,” he says. “I’d better go.”
“What does it say?”
Harry unstoppers the potion and downs it in one go, carefully swallowing it all, and trying not to think about the slightly lumpy texture and the muddy taste. He watches as Draco dips slender fingers in the soft, golden salve. The first gentle pass of those fingers over the sensitive skin of his newly healed arm leaves him shivering. Draco bows his head over his arm, and applies the salve with gentle, careful movements. Maybe it's the almost-caress, maybe it's the smell of honey and chamomile. Whatever it is, it makes Harry's pain-clenched muscles relax, and his breathing evens out. Something warm curls low in his belly and he shivers again. Draco looks up at him through almost silver lashes. His eyes look darker in the low light from the fireplace.
“I’ll check back as soon as I can,” he says, already turning on his heel to make the jump to the DMLE. The last thing he sees before he Disapparates is Draco's face, pinched in worry.
“At least we got this one. Let’s get him back to the Ministry.”
“But what if Malfoy really is their boss?”
“The wards are strong enough. We’ll send someone back for him. Come on mate!”
“The internet,” Ron says faintly. “Right.”
“Urgh. Do we have to?” Ron’s hands instinctively come up to cover his chest.
“Hmm. There are myths about artefacts with those properties, yes.”
Ron narrows his eyes.
"You're good at that."
There’s a bit of shuffling around and a few muttered curses as the Cloak slips, but in the end, all three of them manage to fit under it, and they make their way across the moor and into the stadium. They find a quiet spot under the stands, and Harry slips the hair into the vial of potion. It swirls and bubbles, and then the smoke clears. Jamie Cadogan smells a bit like gasoline, and the potion has a nasty, oily look to it. Harry gulps down half the vial, wishing that he'd thought to bring a freshmint. The taste makes him gag, but only for a few seconds. Then the feeling of his body simultaneously stretching and shrinking is so overwhelming that he can’t focus on anything else. His waist grows wider, and his face turns pudgy and pimply. He can feel his fingers grow shorter and wider too, and when he looks down, he has to take off his glasses to see his ragged fingernails clearly. Hermione holds out a hand for the glasses, but the thought of giving them up makes him feel oddly exposed. He slips them into his pocket instead.
“Thought you might,” Ron mutters. “Go on!”
Half an hour later, Ron hops down from the stool and excuses himself for the bathroom. He slips through the back door unseen, and Harry has to run to catch up with him outside Borgin and Burkes.
“I agree with Hermione. A Pensieve  is just a magical substance. Like a potion that you submerge yourself in. Most potions work on Squibs. Even on Muggles.” He shrugs. “But maybe it’s better if we take turns, if you’ll be more comfortable that way.”
Ron frowns but nods and disappears back to his own cubicle.
“It’s a moot point. Due to your undignified lifestyle choices, the Malfoy line is going to end with you.”
“I know some of it might be confidential, and I’m not asking you to tell me anything like that,” Malfoy says at last. “But I need to know what precisely it is that you want my help with. Because I am going to help you, if I can, but I have a job here too. It might not mean a lot to you, but Stonehenge IV is probably the most important excavation in a decade, and I’m not leaving it to a couple of interns so I can go and be your research assistant. I’ve better things to do with my time than look up references for you two, at least unless you give me a good reason.”
And yes, Harry thinks, that is exactly what it looks–and smells–like. The disgusting smell comes from the soiled trousers clinging to the victim’s legs. Harry takes a closer look at the man, again cataloguing for the Pensieve. The victim is male and middle aged. He’s wearing a stained, grayish white shirt that might once have been part of a set of wizards’ formal wear, if the ruffles and the golden cuff links are any indication. His dark grey trousers are old and dirty. His face is sallow, but that may be due to the manner of death. His greying hair is swept back and tied with a black string at his nape. There is a yellow discolouration on the first and second finger of his right hand, likely caused by chain smoking. Harry’s eyes wander to a piece of parchment lying next to the victim’s wrist. It’s torn, but there is part of a drawing on it. A sunrise or sunset, and some lines. Harry carefully levitates it off the bed and keeps it hovering in mid air waiting for Ron to cast the usual protective charms on it. Instead, he conjures a very Muggle looking Ziploc bag. Harry sends him a questioning look and gets a sheepish grin in return.
“Yes, Auror Potter, Sir.” The little elf nods. “ Blimpy will be going to her mistress’ second cousin’s house.”
And here he goes again, sounding like an idiot. But Draco just smirks.
The elf nods and sniffles, and Harry conjures a handkerchief.
And then the searing pain is gone, replaced by a sudden numbness. Draco is staring at him with his wand still raised. Harry stares back.
Their steps echo off the stone walls as they walk down a narrow hallway lined with anonymous wooden doors. Each door has a number painted on it and a tiny window covered with thick iron bars. He’d expected it to be loud, but the sound of their boots against the flagstone is the only sound there is to be heard. He glances at the barred windows, but no one seems to react to their presence at all. The guard takes out a key and unlocks the slightly wider, numberless door at the end of the corridor.
“Yes. Might be a coincidence?”
“Excuse me. We’re here to see one of your curators. Draco Malfoy. We have an appointment.”
Before he’s even fully aware what he’s doing, the door is blasted off its hinges.
“Brilliant! Thanks.” The smile is so sudden and so big, his cheeks hurt. “So, I’ve got my potion, and you’ve got the Cloak. We’d better get moving. You never know when Shannon’ll catch the snitch. She’s dead fast.”
“Harry? Are you listening?” Hermione sounds like she’s been trying to get his attention for a while.
“Yeah, yeah.” Bludger turns to the tall, slender figure to his right. “Did you bring it or what?”
“I’ll send for a team to pick them up. You’re not fit to Apparate or Floo.” And I’m not going anywhere without you, he finishes silently.
Harry takes a deep breath and plunges into the liquid.
“Easy there, Weasley,” Malfoy says mildly. “You know, it might help if you told me what exactly it is that you’re investigating. If you don’t, I can’t judge which informations might be important.”
Mr Granger pokes his head around the door. “Is there anything I can do to help? Would you like me to get a painkiller for you? I have some Ibuprofen…Or I could see if Hermione has one of those potions in her old bedroom…”
"I'll see what I can do." Savage gives him a small smile and rustles her papers to indicate that the conversation is over. Harry nods. His hand is already at the door handle, when Savage calls after them.
“Probably in Ireland. That’s what he was planning, anyway. I suppose he could be in France. Malfoy said we could use his house in Bordeaux. But Johnny was nervous about not speaking French.”
“Good work on the diary, Auror Potter.” Savage gives him a stern look. “I trust that I won’t have to tell you what I think about putting civilians at risk by bringing them along on a mission. Or about the possible sanctions, if you should choose to do so again.”
“The Mad Muggle?!? I suppose it’s best if I don’t ask.” he says, once he’s regained a bit of control.
They’re greeted with a murmur of voices from the Aurors and MLE officers on duty. Hestia Jones and Jolene Harris are finishing up their night shift by discussing something that involves a lot of pointing at the huge map of London on the wall. Their red robes are slung over the backs of their chairs, and if Jolene’s singed hair is any indication, they’ve had quite the exciting night.
“Er,” Harry says. “I nicked Mum’s.” His heart is racing and he’s desperately trying to come up with a reason why Jamie Cadogan would have to steal his mother’s wand.
“Good thinking with the shoelace,” Harry whispers. “Where the fuck is Scara Brae?”
Harry leans in to kiss that smirky smile off his mouth. Draco meets him half way. His lips are hungry, almost forceful, and Harry finds himself being grabbed by the wrists and pushed back against the cushion, his head framed by lean, lightly tanned forearms, and his vision obscured by strands of blond hair.
“But… we need him to tell us about the cup. You should have heard me yammering on about my interest in antiques.”
“Oi! Jamie! What kept you?” Bludger asks.
Draco doesn’t answer, but his eyes open sluggishly, and he blinks up at him a few times. Fifi appears with a vial of sparkly liquid, and he presses it to Draco’s lips.
“Er… the letter from your mum?”
"Is this really coming from the man who accused me of horrible pick up lines?!"
“When did Lucius Malfoy say this?”
“When was the last time you spoke to your brother?” Ron asks.
The cottage is a pit. There’s the clutter that comes from someone living alone and not bothering to pick up after himself; plates of half eaten food, cold cups of tea and an overflowing ashtray are scattered over every available surface. And then there are all the signs of someone ransacking the place. Furniture has been tipped over, the cupboard is gaping open and an old cloak has been tossed on the floor. A few books have been tossed to the ground, surrounded by torn out pages. A beer bottle has been knocked over and a puddle of cheap, Muggle lager is seeping into the threadbare carpet next to the upended armchair. Harry mentally catalogues it all, careful to look in all directions and take in as many details as possible for later Pensieve viewing. Beside him, he hears the familiar mumbling of Ron’s voice, while he casts detecting charms, trying to find out what kind of magic was last used here, and when.
“Fuck!” We were so close!” Ron kicks the door and it slams shut.
“Bloody hell, this is disgusting!” Ron’s voice is slightly muffled by the Bubblehead Charm he has cast on himself. He’s looking at the dead man on the bed with an expression that’s more horrified than professionally neutral. Harry can’t really blame him. He casts a Bubblehead Charm on himself before stepping around the puddle of blood on the floor to take a closer look.
A small elf, dressed in a linen dish towel appears with a pop.
George nods. “Yeah. Those new regulatory laws on magical experimentation are making it damn near impossible to be inventive. It’s illegal to brew potions that are not on the Ministry’s approved list. It used to be the other way around, but apparently people need to be protected from their own stupidity more than they need new solutions to their problems.”
“It’s disturbing that you’re smiling like that when you’re thinking about your wife punching someone in the face, you know,” he says.
“S’ not your fault.”
Ron is already conjuring one of his Muggle evidence bags, when Harry spots the pendant. It’s almost obscured by the blood, but the engraving is the same as on the cuff link. A snake writhing around the stem of a cup or trophy.
“I know. I’m sorry,” he offers. What else can he say?
“Right. Focussed.” Like this won’t leave him reeling for days. He stands up and puts the t-shirt on, grateful that his face is hidden for a few precious moments. The soft fabric enveloping him in a cloud of Draco’s scent is pure torture. When he yanks his head free of the shirt and adjusts his glasses, Draco is standing in front of him. He reaches out a hand, but seems to change his mind about touching him, and lets it fall to his side, before it brushes his arm.
“The interesting thing is, in the Iron Age, caries were associated with wealth and aristocracy. Poor people had quite healthy teeth.” Draco leans back in his chair and takes his elbows off the table, so Harry can set a plate down.
“What are you going to do about those two?” Draco gestures vaguely to Bludger and Matt on the floor next to the dining table.
“Just be ready to Portkey there if I contact you.”
“Protego!” Matt goes down, but not before he’s thrown a shield in front of Bludger, who’s jumping to his feet and grabbing a canvas tote from the floor. Harry watches as he turns on his heel to Disapparate, but instead of vanishing, he overbalances and stumbles into the table. The bag rolls away from him with a metallic clank and Harry spots a glimpse of gold.
It’s hard to see the blood against the dark wool of his trousers, but there’s already a red smudge on the floor, where his leg is resting. When he touches Draco’s leg, his hands come away wet. He rips the fabric and his stomach turns at the sight of the deep, uneven gash. Remembering his emergency first aid training, he lifts the leg and presses his hands down above the wound, trying to slow the bleeding.
“No, poor Percy, when mum gets a hold of him! You know how worried she’s been since I ended up in here, and now she’s blaming him.” Ron smirks, and Harry can’t help return it. The tension’s gone, and they move onto discuss if the crap hospital food is worse than the crap food in the ministry cafeteria, and whether Percy’s going to be even more of an arse if he’s reelected or if it’ll make him relax just a fraction.
The locks click, and Draco pushes the door open.
Picturing Narcissa Malfoy in a flowery dress, carrying a wicker basket full of produce, is enough to make his head hurt.
The small back room reminds him uncomfortably of Mrs. Figgs' sitting room back at Privet Drive. It's run down and smells of dust and cats.
“I’d rather take my chances with the Wizengamot.”
Ron looks like he’s about to jump out of bed and shake Harry again.
“Sorry. What did you say?”
He must have made some sort of noise, because Malfoy snatches his hand away as of he’s been burned and takes a self conscious step back.
The young mediwizard behind the counter looks up and waves as they pass. Harry’s been making more visits to St. Mungo’s in the past week than ever before. Sometimes alone, and in the last few days, sometimes escorting Narcissa Malfoy. Contrary to his previous visits to the hospital, he doesn’t really mind. Especially not today. Because today, he’s got Draco’s bag slung over his shoulder, and Draco walking next to him to the Floo. Except Draco has stopped to look at the screen on the wall in the waiting area, where they’re showing scenes from Percy’s victory party. Statistics from different districts, Percy waving at a group of happy volunteers and a flustered looking Molly in a new dress. Draco turns to him and he shrugs. Percy will get four more years as Minister. But he won’t have the unlimited power that the Chalice offers. It might not be ideal, but it’s good enough for now. A lot can happen in four years, Harry thinks. But right now, that’s not really important.
“Yeah. Sure. Mind if I put some clothes on first?” Ron steps out from behind the fridge door. He’s naked, and clutching a jug of milk, which he’s placed strategically in front of his groin. Harry rapidly averts his eyes.
“Oh,” Draco says faintly. He walks back to the bench and sits down, resting his elbows on his knees, and cradling his head in his hands. “Are you? Able to help me?”
"Come 'round for breakfast tomorrow and I'll show you?" She smiled at him. The expression was so earnest and concerned that all of a sudden it didn't matter how much of a nag she could be sometimes.
“Er. No. Please do. I’ll just…make a cup of tea and wait here.”
“Sure. I think the conference room is free. I’ll get a cuppa. D’you want one?
Harry can’t help the answering smile stretching slowly across his own face. Ron and Hermione really are the perfect couple, and he’s so happy to have witnessed them going from friends to lovers to the settled couple with a baby they are now. They really deserve their happiness after everything that’s happened. He mentally shakes himself. An end of the week trip to the pub with his colleagues is not the time or the place to be sentimental.
“No,  Auror Potter, Sir. No masks. But they were having the bad magic. Like before. In the skull. Blimpy could tell.”
“Let’s watch it together. All of us.”
He looks up into the stand, and finds a sea of red. It’s probably a bad idea to go up there. He had a chance to review Jamie Cadogan’s file this morning, and he’s been in his fair share of fights with fans of other teams.
At first glance the bedroom looks undisturbed. But then Ron casts a charm to draw the curtains on the modest four poster bed aside, and there she is. Adrienne Wright. She’s wearing a baby pink dressing gown and fuzzy slippers. And it looks like the cause of death is the same as it was for her brother. There’s a gaping wound in her neck and a crusty pool of dried blood on the sheet.
Oh fucking hell. Reminding Draco of the past is probably a really bad idea. But Draco just smiles that small, nostalgic smile again.
“Jamie,” he says slowly, “What the fuck happened to your wand?”
“Yes,” the tall man drawls. "My research suggests that this is indeed the chalice we’ve been looking for.” Harry frowns. It’s hard to hear over the crackling on the Extendable Ear, but that voice... He leans a bit closer to the window, trying to get a look at the face under the hood. A dry twig of heather crunches under his foot.
Tobby? Harry can’t help wondering if he’s standing in front of one of Dobby’s relatives, but given how his old friend used to speak of them, he’s not sure if he dares to ask. Before he can make up his mind, Tobby disappears with an extremely muted pop.
“When were you planning to steal the magic?”
Harry checks that Rose is sleeping, and tiptoes back to the sofa. He itches to pour himself a healthy dram, but he has fucked up badly enough as it is. Drinking while babysitting is taking it one step too far, even for him, and even if these last days have been a lot more hectic than usual. How long has Ron been at St Mungo’s now? He ticks the days off on his fingers. It’s Tuesday, so... five days! Has it really been almost a week?
“I hope that he’ll be able to help me solve a murder case involving an ancient artefact,” he bites out.
They apparate into Bludger’s brother’s garden, and Harry barely has time to find his feet, before he’s overtaken by a violent shiver. The wind that whips through his hair and presses the freezing cold, humid air through his robes carries the smell of the ocean. He can hear the waves crashing onto the rocks on the shore behind the small cottage and the attached shed, which looks like it might blow away in the wind. There’s nothing here but seagulls and yellow, half dead grass. He shivers again, fighting the urge to wrap his arms around his body for heat.
“Do you know why I’ve been called in?”
The missing page is towards the back. Ron turns a few pages, and Harry leans over his shoulder to read the chapter title, Magic Theft.
“Bloody hell! That was awful! His hands were all over me! Do women really have to put up with this? I’ll never scoff at one of Hermione’s sexism rants again!” He conjures a tissue and starts wiping off the makeup.
Harry slaps him on the shoulder.
Harry does his best to keep his face neutral. The question is innocent enough, after all. If you don’t know Donovan, that is.
Then they’re gone, and two heads appear right next to him.
Hermione tears herself away from the books, and Harry hands Draco the vial.
“I think I’ll leave the detective work to you, Harry,” Hermione says. “I promised Ron I’d come and see him as soon as I brought you here.” She gives him a quick hug and a kiss on the cheek, and leaves. Harry suddenly feels exposed. Sitting in a comfortable chair in front of the fire and having a civil conversation with Malfoy seems like one of the strangest situations he has ever found himself in. He flounders for something to say for what seems like minutes after Hermione has closed the door behind her.
“Yes. I’ll lift his arm and you can unbutton the shirt.”
Lucius returns to the Manor. He reads loads of books and writes notes in a journal that he hides inside a hollow tome. There is something about snakes and references to ancient cults. Something about a ritual in a secret language, and using the blood of the victim to release the magic from the cup. But nothing about how to find the cup itself.
“I... “ Draco runs a hand through his hair, making it stick up in uneven tufts. Harry sort of wants to reach out and pat it down. A dishevelled Malfoy must be against the natural order of things. Malfoy shakes his head.
“Maybe not. Rose ripped out some pages from a few of Hermione’s books before she child-proofed her library.” Ron grimaces, and Harry can understand why. He can just about picture the look on Hermione’s face when she found her precious books torn and abused.
“Good to see you’ve got your priorities straight, mate.”
Adrienne’s home is the polar opposite to her brother’s in many ways. For a brief moment, Harry feels like he has stepped into Umbridge’s old office. There is a lot of floral patterned chintz and doilies. And cats. Lots of cats. A fat, white one winds itself around his legs and purrs loudly.
“We’ll just tell them that I swerved off course because of my leg, and you had to do a Wronski Feint. It dropped out of your pocket when you saved my life with your mad flying skills.”
Harry nods. He's dreamed about doing something like that himself. Get away from all the preconceived notions of who he's supposed to be.
“Sorry I’m late. I had to stop by the excavation. One of the trainees forgot to cover up the trenches. Again. And it’s been raining a lot this morning.”
“You can go back home, Persephone. I’ll read the letter as soon as I get dressed,” he urges.
Getting someone cleared of a SDEA accusation turns out to be a lot more difficult than getting them accused in the first place. There are over ten pages of forms to fill out, before they can even begin the process, and after that, they’ll have to interview Jamie Cadogan to confirm Brigg’s story.
"You're welcome," Draco says, gravely. Then he leers. "Besides, you're plenty big as far as I can tell."
"Good. I don't like being here."
“That’s actually clever,” she says. The surprise is almost masked by the compliment.
“It’s possible. But we’d have to match all the ripped out pages with the books to find out. It’d take forever, and probably lead to nothing.” Harry takes off his glasses and rubs at the pressure points where they’ve been digging into his nose. The idea of using hours matching scraps of paper doesn’t seem particularly attractive.
The apprentice must have seen something in his expression. Something that gives away his anxiousness.
Donovan laughs. It’s an ugly sound, ricocheting off the walls in the empty corridor. “I knew you weren’t the poster boy everyone makes you out to be. He’s in 23.”
“I’ll help, if you need it,” Hermione cuts in quietly. “Your mother was perfectly polite to me that one time we met in Madame Malkins last year, and… Just tell me if you need any help.” She bites her lip.
Hestia waves at them, and comes over.
“What’d they say at St. Mungo’s?”
“That’s the worst explanation for anything, I’ve ever heard.”
“Yeah…” Ron sounds completely lost.
Lucius? Fuck! Of course. He goes over Jamie Cadogan’s statement again. ‘According to Bludger, our orders come from Malfoy.’ The ice melts just a little, and he listens avidly as Ron asks the next question.
“Yes. He’s my brother.”
The DMLE is quiet when Harry steps out of the lift and makes his way down the hall to his cubicle. Donovan sneers at him from his usual place slouched against the wall next to the small tea kitchen.
“That’s good, then. We’ll find you there if we need you. You’re free to go, Blimpy.”
“Interesting? Hmm. I think so too. So, what do you do, when you’re not choking on your Firewhiskey, Harry?”
“You are such an idiot, George Weasley.” Angelina doesn’t quite manage to keep the affection out of her voice.
“Dunno.” He’s back to scowling now.
He’s firing his first stunner before he’s even fully inside the room.
“I think I need you to be a bit more specific than that,” he drawls, “There are literally hundreds of thousands of ancient magical artefacts.”
“Look at that! You’ve ruined any chance I might have had with him now.”
“Draco, look out!” he shouts, but his voice drowns in the battle noise.
Ron knocks, and Harry squares his shoulders, attempting to look professional despite the cold.
Savage looks at him for so long that he has to consciously keep himself from squirming like a Hogwarts first year, unable to answer a question in Snape’s potions class. Then she nods curtly.
“W-what?” His mind supplies a not at all helpful stream of memories of hands gliding over skin and mouths meeting, tasting, exploring.
Ron throws the blanket aside and swings his purple clad legs over the side of the bed. Before Harry knows what’s happening, Ron is standing in front of him, with his hands on his shoulders. His face is completely blank, but his eyes are blue fire.
“Even better,” Draco says. Then he starts walking towards the village square. Harry falls into step beside him.
“Yeah. Or maybe we’ll continue with the murder case.” Harry pushes his chair back and gets up. “Only one way to find out.”
“And you’re leaving.”
The backup team arrives in a matter of minutes after he’s sent a message to Savage through the Protean charm on his badge. Relief courses through him, when he sees Hestia and her partner Williamson Apparate in the square outside. Good. These two aren’t going to give him grief about wanting to stay with Draco. Hestia smiles and waves at him, when she spots him through the window. He looks to where Draco is sitting in a comfortable chair, transfigured from one of the hard backed dining chairs. He’s starting to get a bit of colour back, and the bandage is as pristine and white as it was ten minutes ago when he and Fifi changed it. The wound must have stopped bleeding. At least for now. A curse wound like that isn’t easy to heal, though. Draco’ll have to see a healer as soon as possible.
“I’m so sorry, Hermione,” he says into her hair.
Hermione pokes him gently in the back, and Harry realises that he’s been staring–again. Draco must think he’s a total idiot, the way he keeps falling off the face of the earth whenever he moves or talks or… yeah. He’s utterly fucked.
The Malfoy’s summer residence is nothing like Harry expects. Not that he’s spent a great amount of time imagining it. But the vague image of a huge chateau he’s built in his mind is not accurate at all. They touch the ground under the cover of a small patch of trees right outside a small village. The first alders and poplars are just starting to bud, and the sun is warm enough that Harry turns his face up for a few seconds and just stands there, soaking in the rays, before remembering where he is, and why. When he opens his eyes again, Draco’s looking at him with an expression he can only describe as… fond. Something heavy that he didn’t even know was holding him down is lifting from his shoulders, making it suddenly easier to breathe.
A small silver vase flies into his hand. He transfigures it into a pair of scissors, and cuts all the way around Draco’s thigh, making the ripped fabric fall away and leaving Draco’s leg exposed from his mid thigh down. He checks Draco over again. His face is white, and his breathing is getting shallow. He must have lost more blood than Harry thought. Fuck! He hopes Fifi hurries with the Potion!
“I should stay away from cutting curses.”
The crime scene is in a small cottage surrounded by an overgrown garden and a fence that might once have been white. Everything is covered by a slushy, grey layer of sleet that seeps into the fabric of their cloaks and trousers on the short walk from the street to the front door. The cottage is sitting on a dirt road on the outskirts of a Muggle village, and any hope Savage may have had of reassuring the public by sending Harry and Ron there is clearly in vain. There’s not a single person in sight, apart from the two DMLE officers slouching against the door. The older of the pair gives them a quick once-over and doesn’t bother asking for ID when he sees their red robes. He also doesn’t bother returning their greeting, but he does push away from the door enough for them to slip by. The younger one, Davies, who sometimes comes along on after-work trips to the Leaky Cauldron, greets them with a smile.
“Yes. With Draco Malfoy. I’m Hermione Granger. I work with him at Stonehenge.”
“No. I’ll wait until the game starts. It’ll buy me some extra time. Besides, it’ll help me build my credibility. I’ll tell them my mum didn’t want me to go to the match.”
Draco smiles at him.  “We should probably start by trying to break the curses on that notebook.”
“Yes, Potter. He is. He’s also the one who did research on the Chalice when the Dark Lord was looking for it. And some of the notes he left in his books suggest that he knows how to free the magic and transfer it back, once the chalice has taken it. It’ll probably take a few weeks to organise a visit, though. Unless I’m accompanying an Auror who’s conducting an investigation...”
“Looks like he shat himself. Literally,” Ron mumbles.
“I…” He shakes his head. “Best mate or not, I am absolutely not having this conversation with you.”
Malfoy considers him through tired eyes for a few seconds. Then he nods.
“Oi! Jamie! You have trouble tying that shoe of yours? Mummy usually does it for you?”
He really doesn’t want. What he wants to do is go inside and see if Ron’s all right.
“You’re welcome to borrow it, if you want. It has some very interesting notes in the margins, made by my great uncle.”
“We have to go to your house in France,” Harry explains.
“Might be. Or maybe it’s not. It’s something to keep in mind, at least.”
He offers Malfoy a basic rundown of the case, ignoring Ron’s scowl. He doesn’t mention anything about the New Dawn, or Bludger, though. He just tells him about the double murder, the missing book pages and the symbols found on both victims. Malfoy leans forward with his elbows on the table, and rests his no-longer-pointy chin on top of his folded hands, listening intently.
Even on the broom, he can see how Draco’s shoulders tense. He pushes his broom so close their knees are touching. It’s a dangerous maneuver this high up, but he’s not having this conversation in shouts, and they’re both good flyers. He loosens his grip on the broom, steering one handed for a moment, as he reaches out and rests his hand on Draco’s arm.
“Erm. I work in law enforcement. What about you?”
“Do you want to see a healer?”
“I have information that I want to share with you. All of you. And I sort of need to ask you a favour. But please, come back to my flat with me after. I can’t focus on anything, when all I can think of is getting you out of those clothes and into my bed.”
“Yes. I will.”
“Er, yes. Right. I will. Thank you.” He picks up the bandages, and starts wrapping them around the wound. No. He’ll have to remove more of the fabric first. But a cutting spell isn’t really an option. He looks around.
"You were sleeping so well. I didn't want to wake you. I was going to leave a note..."
“The telly. That’s great, mate. Does Savage think it’s brilliant too? Or are we going to get yelled at for contaminating the evidence?”
“Yes.”
“Since you are apparently unable to sit still, I have a new assignment for the two of you.”
"Thank you, Officer Davies. Would you mind staying while I conduct the interview?"
“May I help you?” he drones, without looking at Harry.
“Thank you. I’m sure you’re right. Are you sure there’s no way to contact them?”
“...understand the needs of the ordinary witch and wizard. Which is why I am asking for four more years to do my best to serve our community and continue to meet those needs!” He finishes with a practised smile and a well choreographed tilt to his head, which makes his profile align perfectly with the new statue of Dumbledore that’s been erected at one end of the Atrium.
Does he? He cradles his head in his hands and closes his eyes. He’s been so sure that Draco’s innocent, but… a statement under Veritaserum is hard to argue against. And yet, all he sees in his mind is Draco looking at him with those dark circles under his eyes, swearing that he hasn’t done anything, without knowing what he’s even charged with. Fuck!
“No, it’s fine. It’d be awkward if you didn’t remember what we talked about last time.”
“Bloody Wanderers!” Harry scowls and kicks at the railing in front of him.
“Here you are. It’ll be a bit crowded, but I think there’s room for all of us to watch at the same time.”
"Does Master's guest want his shirt cleaned?"
Malfoy rests his elbow on the table and props his hand against his chin. Harry’s eyes are drawn to the way his long, slender fingers wrap against the smooth skin on his jaw. He has a sudden urge to lean in and kiss him, to taste the skin and discover if Malfoy is really as clean shaven as he looks, or if there is a hint of invisible, blond stubble against his lips. Fuck no! Thinking about kissing Malfoy is bad. Very bad! He’s only had the two drinks, but it feels like a lot more. His eyes drift back to Malfoy’s face. He’s smiling, Harry realises. And his mouth looks a lot nicer when he’s not sneering. Pretty and soft, with lips that are just full enough to be kissable, but not pouty enough to be girly.
A half snort/half giggle bursts out of him before he can try to rein it in. He lifts his glass. “To Percy! I hope Molly is actually able to make him stop and think...”
“I do have Level A clearance, Ronald. In case you forgot,” she tells him over her shoulder.
Harry slings an arm around Ron’s shoulder and activates the Portkey.
“Yes. Sorry. I didn’t think… Sorry.” Harry stammers, and immediately wishes he’d kept his mouth shut. “I’ll help too, if I can.”
“No problem, Malfoy. Come on. I’ll get the first round.”
He covers them with the Cloak, and they sneak back towards the house. When they’re half way up the path, the door opens. Mr Brigg looks around before he steps outside, and makes his way to the shed.
“Looks serious,” he whispers to Ron before the room is called to order.
“The healers don’t know what to think. They’ve moved him from the General Ward to the Curse Unit.” Her voice trembles, and Harry reaches out and pulls her into a tight hug, wishing he could keep it all away from her by hiding her in his arms.
“What is it?”
He shakes his head, curls bouncing around his face. “Sorry, Auror Potter. I’m not allowed in there when they do experimental magic.”
“I hope so.” Hestia's grin turns slightly smug, but he can't really blame her. The fireworks case has been giving them headaches for weeks.
“Okay. We’ll ask her tonight then.”
“It’s a dark artefact,” Harry says. “It’s supposed to be very powerful. Something that can steal people’s magic and store it.”
He reads over the statement one more time. Our orders come from Malfoy. What the hell have you done, Draco? He hears Draco’s weary voice in his head. ‘Whatever those charges are, I didn’t do anything. You believe that, don’t you?’
“You wanted to see me, Ma’am?”
“Thank you, Sir,” Harry says, and suppresses the urge to stomp on Percy’s foot. “Speaking of Ron, you’ll have to excuse me, Sir. I need to go and brief him about our latest case.” He nods at the reporters, and the cameras go crazy again. “...and on the fact that his brother is a complete wanker,” he mutters under his breath, as he escapes into the lift.
“Here you go.” Draco hands him a spoon and measures out the potion. “I don’t think you need more than this. It’s not a very complicated break…”
“Why?” Fuck. That’s sounded really clingy. “I mean… we could really use your help with the diary!”
It’s almost two hours before the door finally opens.
”Did you just imply that I’m an idiot?”
“They must have come from his family home. Do you think the drawing next to the body came from one of the books?”
Mr Granger convinces them to stay for lunch. Harry sets the table, only half listening to the fairly disgusting conversation between Mr Granger and Draco about various forms of tooth decay in Iron Age skeletons. Hermione is trying to convince Rose that she should wear socks, and Ron is at the kitchen table, trying his best to look as if he knows what he’s doing with Mr Granger’s computer. He’s making a decent effort, Harry thinks. But on the other hand, what does he know? The last time he used a computer, it was a big, boxy thing with a huge screen and a cord and a… clicky thing. This one’s much smaller, not unlike the one he saw in Draco’s office at the museum.
The awkward silence after Ron leaves makes Harry squirm in his seat. Mr Brigg just sits there, glancing through the window towards the sea, like he’d rather be taking a brisk walk, than sitting here. Finally the silence becomes too much for him.
The young man looks up and blinks owlishly at him from behind glasses even thicker than his own.
(Suspect is shrugging)
“Where do we go?” Tall Bloke asks.
“Why the fuck not?” Harry shouts back. “It could have kept you out of fucking prison! You could have gone to Azkaban, you stubborn git!”
He walks down the stairs in a daze. It isn’t until he’s actually standing in front of the heavy door that he starts thinking about what to actually say. He’s been determined to fix things, since five minutes after he slammed this door yesterday morning, but it’s been sort of vague… something he had to do later. And all of a sudden, later is now. He casts the complicated unlocking charm, and turns the knob.
“To Percy!” Ron echos, and takes a healthy swig of his own drink.
“Yeah…I think we need to borrow another hair from Gracie.”
Malfoy’s lips curl up into a smile, and Harry realises that he hasn’t actually stopped staring at them.
Fuck! He hadn’t expected Malfoy of all people to be that candid. Of course he can keep a secret–if he wants to. But does he? So far, he has had no reason not to trust Malfoy. Hermione is usually an excellent judge of character, and she seems to get along with him. On the other hand… this is Malfoy.
He smiles. It makes sense for Ron to stay with Hermione’s parents, he supposes. And Ron won’t exactly find it a hardship. His interest in Muggle objects has grown over the years, almost rivaling his father’s. Besides, everything in Ron and Hermione’s cottage is operated by magic. Ron won’t even be able to open the door, without magic to take down the childproofing wards, or make himself a cup of tea, without casting a charm on the kettle.
“Stupefy!”
“I know. A counter statement would’ve been a good start, but Cadogan didn’t bother getting one before he locked Draco up for the night. And I don’t think it’s going to count, if I get one. I’m too biased.”
They’re in the kitchen now, and Mr Granger is pulling out a chair for him. He groans, first in relief, when he’s finally sitting down, and then in pain, when Ron lifts his foot onto the table. Hermione casts a cooling charm on his ankle, and the pain lessens enough that he’s able to think straight.
“But Ma’am,” Harry resists the urge to rub a hand over his eyes. They’ve been discussing this for almost twenty minutes, and Savage isn’t listening to a word they’re saying. He tries again anyway.
“Harry…”
“It’s a nice broom,” Ron says. “You should talk to Davies,” he mutters under his breath. “Get him to take Jamie Cadogan in for a friendly chat about illegal potions. That way, you’ll be able to avoid him at the match.”
Smith glares.
“Aren’t you going to thank me? I’m the one who made the arrest!”
The silence stretches into something almost tangible. Tangible and bloody uncomfortable! He has to resist the urge to squirm in his uncomfortable seat.
The lift door opens and they enter. The Ministry is deserted this time on a Saturday morning. No one else needs to get on or off the lift, so the ride to Level Two is quicker than usual.
“Fuck! Harry! You’re so fucking perfect like this! Letting me use you. Letting me fuck myself on your cock,” Draco breathes, the words hot across his ear, and he shudders and bucks against him, chasing the feeling of Draco clenching tight around his cock.
“Yes. Of course I did.” He fumbles in the leather bag he’s carrying over his shoulder, and draws out a dented, brass goblet. Harry leans a bit closer to the window. If that’s the Chalice, it’s certainly nowhere near as impressive as he’d imagined.
“Thanks, Hermione.”
“I honestly don’t know.”
“So you’ll be back tomorrow?”
“You have about twenty minutes before the potion wears off,” Hermione says. “You’ll have to see where they’re hiding the pages and find an excuse to go, so they won’t get suspicious and hide them somewhere else.”
Draco opens the door, and Harry is immediately attacked by a small bundle of bushy hair and bouncy energy.
"And muddy, after what I hear..."
"Your work... It's not what I'd have expected you to do. The old you, I mean."
He grabs a handful of Floo powder and is gone in a shower of sparks, before Harry has the time to answer. “Bye,” he mumbles to the brightly glowing embers. Then he takes his own handful of powder, steps into the fire and calls out his destination.
Harry snorts. Like father, like son.
Ron shrugs.
"And that's exactly why I decided to do it. It's not exactly glamorous, you know. The pay is so ridiculous you'd laugh. And I only got the curator position because there were't any other candidates under the age of ninety. But I really enjoy it."
“Thank you, Cho.”
“What exactly does that mean? Experimental magic…”
“I’d rather have her cross with me, than have her injured.”
“... getting close,” the smallest of them is saying. Judging by the voice, it’s a young man.
I am sorry to inconvenience you at this late hour. I am writing to you on behalf of my son, since I understand that you are on friendly terms. I will be brief. Draco needs your help. He has been taken into Auror custody, on suspicion of Death Eater activity. He is being held in the Ministry for the time being. Please, Mr Potter. I urge you to help him, if you are in any way capable.
Draco shakes his head. “It’s fine. Some minor damage to the base, but I managed to contain it with a few sponges and a bucket, and Martin can clean up the rest of the mess tomorrow, since he’s the one who started it.” He casts a Cleaning Charm on his muddy trousers. Then he pulls out the offered chair and busies himself pouring milk and tea and stirring in an obscene amount of sugar. Finally, he looks up.
At first, nothing happens. Draco is frowning in concentration. He grips his wand a little tighter and tries again. The Dark Magic starts to build. Harry feels it expanding around him. It's like an invisible fist is pressing in on his chest and making him choke and gasp for air. The pressure intensifies until his vision blurs and he has to fight to keep his thoughts focussed.
Ron nods, and gets his pen and notepad.  “Where can we find your cousin?”
“And under which circumstances did this conversation take place?”
"The Chalice takes the magic from anyone who touches it. And, if you perform the right rituals, it can be set to take magic from people in a certain location or with a certain magical signature. Like Mudbloods." Smith smirks. "And I know that since you don't have the Chalice, and you have no clue how to release the magic, Weasley is no more than a squib."
Mr Brigg opens the door a bit wider, and they step into the small, cluttered cottage. “I suppose you’ll want a cuppa?”
“He has a cottage in Wimbourne. Works for the Wasps. Seems that Quidditch and crime go hand in hand in this family. I can find the address for you, if you want.”
“Y-yes. Of course it is. I just wasn’t sure we had the same priorities.”
“I think so. Got my wand, got my Cloak, got my emergency Portkey...”
“No.”
“Do you have any idea where he might be hiding? Old friends? Ex-girlfriends?”
Harry can’t help smiling. “Yeah, mate. You probably are.” He holds open the door to Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and gallantly gestures for Ron to enter first.
“Yeah, I know, but…”
“She came up with a spell to put them back together. We could ask her how she did it,” Ron says.
"Yes." He shrugs. "Can't say I wasn't tempted to do what you did, though."
“I hope nothing happened to the stone altar!” she says. “You’ve been working on that section for weeks!”
“Good.”
Savage turns back to the presentation she’s been viewing, and the dismissal couldn’t have been clearer if she’d said the words out loud. It’s probably best not to push his luck by going against a direct order, so instead of going to the interview room, he heads back towards the lift.
He slumps down in his chair. He knows Ron’s right. Of course he is. But for some reason he thought that his friends would have a solution.
Harry quickly snatches his hand back. Malfoy is standing in the doorway, looking distractingly different from his old self. Harry suspects he should have anticipated it after yesterday, but this Malfoy, with his small smile, windswept hair, sturdy khaki trousers and black, woolly turtleneck will take some time to get used to.
“Figures. What did you hear? Wait. Hermione should hear this too. I think she’s in the dining room, trying to convert it into a study.”
Harry steps in front of Ron and puts a hand on his shoulder.
“I’m sure you will. The magic in a Pensieve is not triggered by the person watching. It’s triggered by the reaction of the Pensieve liquid and the memory. Besides, even if it was triggered by a person, it should be enough that one of the people watching has magic.”
“I tried to tell her that you’re fine…”
"Come on, then. We can use the Floo in here," Malfoy says. He's leaning against the doorframe next to the bar, and Harry jumps to his feet and hurries after him, without meeting his eyes.
Draco shows them the way to his study again. Harry watches Ron’s face, as he takes in the surroundings, noticing all the small differences. The portraits are whispering to each other and pointing.
Harry follows Malfoys movements as he stands up and paces in front of the fireplace.
“You’re welcome. Can we focus on the actual memory now?”
“Thanks,” he whispers back.
“Yes, Sir.”
“Lucius Malfoy is a prisoner, and you’re a guard at Azkaban Prison, is that correct?”
She pulls a bent teaspoon from her desk drawer, and Harry’s heart sinks.
“I’m not sure that’ll work,” Hermione says.
Harry watches him leave.
“Oh. Sorry, mate.”
”Those artefacts are more than four thousand years old, Potter, and the only thing holding them together is the charms I put on the bag. Don’t damage them.”
“Right. You do realise she’s not exactly going to be pleased about that, don’t you?”
“Yeah, alright.” Tanned Bloke’s shoulders slump. “I need to piss before we leave.” He walks towards the door, and Harry flattens himself against the uneven wall and tries not to breathe too loudly.
“Since we started working together. It was awkward at first, but Draco always puts work first. He’s not the kind of person who puts personal opinions before what’s best for the project he’s working on.” The last sentence is delivered with a very pointed look.
“He didn’t. The ritual would be worthless to the Dark Lord, if he didn’t have access to the cup itself. My father didn’t seem to think it was terribly important.”
The dilapidated barn near the stadium is not the best place, but it’s all they were able to find at such short notice. Harry checks again, but no one seems to have noticed the three pops of Apparition. Not that there’s anyone about to notice, apart from a flock of sheep. He can see the sky blue silhouettes of the Tornados fans and the blood red of the Wanderers fans in the distance, making their way towards the small crop of trees that conceal the stadium. He looks back at his two companions. Hermione and Draco look totally out of place in their hastily bought Tornadoes paraphernalia. Of course, it had been Hermione’s idea to buy clothes that would make them blend into the crowd, if the cloak should fail them somehow. But the light blue of the jersey makes Draco’s eyes look almost blue, and Harry has to resist the urge to just stand there and stare at him. At least he doesn’t stare at his face. Instead, he lets his gaze wander down his body, past his lightly muscled chest and his lean thighs to where his feet used to be. They’re not there now. Knowing that they should be, he can just about make out their outline, when Draco moves, but that’s it.
He should probably say something to that. Something deep enough to acknowledge what Malfoy’s shared, but subtle enough that he won’t be embarrassed. But the words just won’t come.
“Accio vase!”
Harry runs a hand over his face, trying, and probably failing, to hide his frustration with the tiny quivering elf. She’s wearing what looks like a frilly kitchen curtain draped like a toga, and a crochet doily as a floppy hat. Her feet are dangling off the chair, and her hunched shoulders and wobbling lower lip make her look like a small, frightened child. Harry pastes on his most patient smile and tries again.
“Savage tried to talk me into taking a week of leave, but I wouldn’t hear of it. I’ve rested more than enough!”
"You invented it yourself? That’s brilliant! Can you show me?"
“What’s happened?”
Interrogating Smith turned out to be more or less a waste of time. Harry shudders at the memory of the fanatic glint in Smith’s eyes. The little shit hadn't managed to give him much to go on; only a couple of first names of group members, and some locations where they met. But his ramblings about pure-bloods taking over the world, and putting Muggle-borns in their rightful place had sounded too much like something Harry’s heard before, through ears that weren’t quite his own.
They Floo back to the flat together. Somehow, it’s not as awkward as he might have imagined–if he’d ever imagined something like this–having Draco there, in his cozy but not exactly posh living room, on his sofa, with a bottle of lager in his hand. He doesn’t look out of place at all. Harry sits down beside him and he smiles.
“The sunrise?” Ron frowns. “That sounds like nonsense. Unless… wait a minute. Do you remember last month? That crazy, drunk bugger we helped Davies haul in for harassing a Muggleborn! Howard. He kept babbling about a new dawn and how the new dawn would solve all our problems. I thought he was just pissed, but what if that’s actually a thing? The New Dawn?”
“Oh!” Harry fiddles with his tea cup. He suspects this is one of those things he should know, except his primary school years were spent trying to avoid getting beaten up by Dudley. Which made it hard to focus on actually learning things.
“What the hell happened?”
“...never find it where I’ve hidden it,” Bludger says.
“There he is! The man we’ve all been waiting for!”
He Floos home after having put Rose to bed and having an awkward cup of tea. He’s barely slumped into his favourite armchair, when the Floo flares to life.
“Erm… My foot’s not broken.” It’s not a lie. At least it’s not broken right now. But Ron isn’t that easy to fool.
“I see.” He’s always imagined that someone who’s been in Azkaban for a long time would sound hoarse and broken. But Lucius doesn’t sound like someone who has been rotting away in a prison cell for years. His voice is as smooth and perfectly modulated as ever. He tilts his head a little, and stares at Harry like he’s a particularly unpleasant potions ingredient. “And exactly what kind of… favour is it that you’re hoping my son will provide you, Mr Potter?”
Oh! Oh shit. Hermione’s right. The blond is coming over. Harry gulps a mouthful of ice water and wipes his hands on his jeans.
Malfoy’s office is at the very end of the corridor. The door is open, and the room beyond is bathed in pale winter sunlight.
He keeps his word. The blinking digital watch on the oven tells him that it’s only a few minutes, before he’s back, though Harry thinks it feels like much longer. The Ibumetin is starting to work, and he’s cast another cooling charm on his leg, so he’s not exactly in pain, as long as he doesn’t move his leg–just uncomfortable, sitting on the hard kitchen chair with his leg on the table.
“You should go home. Get some real sleep,” Ron advises.
Ron nods. “Please.”
“You mentioned that you might be able to find some more information on the Chalice?”
“Yes. Of course we should. I’ve no idea where to start, though.”
They’re sitting on the sofa with a stack of take away containers spread across the coffee table. Rose is sleeping soundly, her head resting against Ron’s thigh and her feet in Harry’s lap. Harry can’t stop thinking about Hermione’s suggestion from earlier. Apparently, neither can Ron.
“Yeah. I might be the idiot who grabbed a cursed cup and got his magic stolen, but I’m still the reasonable one around here. ‘Mione’s invited Malfoy.”
Stupid, arrogant fuck!
They wait another half hour. It’s twenty past eight now, and the Warming Charm has worn off. Harry is about to suggest they go home, when Ron elbows him in the ribs and nods towards the stone hut.
When he looks up after finishing the entire bottle of juice, there’s an owl landing on his window sill. It’s one of the slightly bedraggled looking  ministry owls, and Harry sighs. More work. On a Saturday morning. Lovely! He opens the window, and avoids getting bitten by the grumpy bird long enough to untie the message from its leg and shove it back outside.
“Finished enjoying the scenery?”
“No. Yes. God, I don’t know. I was worried about you. About you. You’ve proved to be practically impossible to get rid of, and yet I was in there thinking about the most unlikely scenarios.”
"You're leaving?"
He jumps up and meets them halfway across the room.
“Maybe you don’t. Have you thought about bringing in an expert? Someone who knows about ancient artefacts.”
He puts the tray down on the table next to Ron and grabs one of the glasses.
“Listen to this: Stealing Magic also known as Theft Spells is used when a witch or wizard wishes to acquire the magic of other witches or wizards. This is not your everyday Unforgivable, for it goes against the very nature of magic to be transferred from one individual to another. Only very few have tried to do this, and fewer still have succeeded.” She points at where the page has been ripped out. “And look! There were handwritten notes in the margin here.”
Of course she did. It takes a lot more than a murder case to get the Head Auror out of bed before eight a.m. on a Saturday.
“Fifi!” he yells, desperately.
“I wasn’t. But things are looking a lot more interesting now.” Harry smiles in a way that he hopes is just the right mixture of seductive and friendly. He’s crap at these things, so he probably looks more constipated than smoldering, but Adam doesn’t seem to mind.
“Fuck’s sake, Hermione!” He gasps.
“Yeah. We’ve identified the leader, but he’s not talking about the cup.”
“I really hope you cast a thorough cleaning charm on those shoes,” Draco says.
“I’ll just go and powder my nose.”
Ron snags a biscuit from the apparently not-so-secret stash he keeps in his drawer. He takes a bite, and gestures at the case file with his half eaten shortbread. “What are you reading?”
Savage isn’t in her office, but Harry finds her in the conference room, when he makes his way back to his cubicle. She’s sitting alone, going through a presentation.
Howard is a bully. There’s no other word for it. He’s big and hulking and slightly chubby in a way that reminds Harry uncomfortably of Dudley. Not that Dudders is a bully these days. He’s quite a nice bloke, actually. Harry goes for a pint with him once in awhile. But there’s a part of him that will always feel slightly threatened by big, hulking people, and Ron’s warm, solid presence next to him feels comforting. Howard is slouched in the uncomfortable chair in the interview room. He’s scowling defiantly, but his knee is bouncing and he’s chewing on a ragged thumbnail.
Harry can’t help blushing.
Draco has his arms crossed in front of his chest, but his face is completely blank. The only thing that betrays emotion is his eyes. They’re so full of panic, Harry can almost feel it himself. Guilty eyes, the Auror part of his mind supplies. Harry tells it to shut up, and tries again.
“Men in robes and masks? Death Eaters?”
He decides that writing a memo for Hermione will save him a lot of time; no one is let into the Department of Mysteries without having a barrage of spells shot at them and signing a three foot long non-disclosure agreement. Then, he summons a fresh cup of tea and starts on his report to Savage about his trip to Azkaban. He is trying to determine how many details of Draco’s conversation with his father he wants to put in when Hermione pokes her head in. Harry rolls up the parchment, and gets to his feet, grabbing the vial off his desk.
“Yes, sure…” On the one hand, it might keep him out of the hospital, but on the other, if the break is really serious, it might be best to know. He’ll survive his hospital phobia if he really has to. Draco casts a complicated charm, and there’s a faint red glow a few centimetres above his ankle.
“It does sound pretentious as fuck,” Ron says.  “But then again, so does ‘the Dark Lord’ and ‘Death Eaters’. Most dark wizards are just cocky little bastards, I reckon.”
“Do you know how to stop the blood? He was hid with a Severing Charm.” Harry explains.
“No!”
“Ah. So you’re not planning to stay then?”
“It was the people in the black robes. They talked about the book, and then they killed Blimpy’s poor mistress.”
The game ends almost an hour later, when Shannon finally catches the snitch, and the Tornadoes win 260-190. They make their way back across the moor with the other fans, lagers in hand and singing… well, more like shouting, but that might be better, because Harry doesn’t know all the words.
“No. Draco Malfoy.”
“What the hell are you talking about? My house in France?” He narrows his eyes. “I hope you’re not asking me to flee the fucking country, Potter. Because I’m not going to run away like a fucking criminal!”
The door closes with a soft click, and Harry turns to look at Draco. He’s looking a little shaken.
“Yes. We probably should. In case.” He draws his wand and casts a spell that’ll make the boat stay in place unless one of them actually touches it. Malfoy layers his own complicated charm on top of Harry’s before he turns his collar up against the rain and makes his way toward the forbidding building looming in the distance.
Ron looks up and smiles at Hermione. “Research is top priority right now. ‘Mione, you and Malfoy should probably be in charge of this part, since you both have access to libraries.” He grimaces. “I’m sorry I can’t do anything to help.”
Oh, fuck! They can’t move. Not without being seen. And Harry is suddenly hyper aware of the wards pressing in on his magic. Confining him. Disapparating is not an option. They could try to fight, but there are four wands trained on them. He feels Ron reaching for the emergency Portkey in his robe pocket, and grab his arm. And then the tall man throws his head back and a flash of pale blond hair catches Harry’s attention.
Draco smiles. It’s a small thing. Just a quirk of lips, really, but it seems genuine enough.
Savage nods and sends them out of her office with a wave.
“Listen here, Harry! You do not get to blame yourself for this. I’m a bloody Auror. I know how to handle cursed objects, and touching them with my bare hands is not the way to do it. So get this through your thick skull once and for all, because I’m getting sick of repeating myself. This. Is. Not. Your. Fault!” He emphasises the last few words with none too gentle pushes on Harry’s shoulders, making him shake back and forth. There’s an odd buzzing in his ears, and Ron shoves him into the hard visitors’ chair before he climbs back into the bed and flings the blanket over his legs with a huff. They stare at eachother for a while. Rons eyes are completely sincere, as he meets Harry’s baffled look.  He really believes what he’s just said. Harry doesn’t. But he’s got brains enough to keep that to himself.
“Right… Let’s grab the Portkey instead. We’ll sort this back at the Ministry.”
Of course this is the wrong thing to say. Before he knows it, Hermione is yanking at his arm, casting a diagnostic charm on the perfectly healed skin where the burn used to be, and muttering about stupid boys and how he’s so  stubborn that he hasn’t been to see a healer. Harry glances helplessly at Ron, but he just shakes his head in mock sadness and mouths, “Draco,” while rolling his eyes. Unhelpful bastard!
"Just be ready to cast a Shield Charm, in case the wards don't react well to me."
“Harry! It’s so good to see you.” She returns his hug so enthusiastically that he almost slips off the barstool.
Stupid, arrogant fuck! Harry glares at him.
“And do you know where Bludger might be right now?”
“Yeah. I can imagine.” Harry winces. Hermione had lost her former love for early starts after becoming a mum. These days she’ll happily stay in bed until noon, if given the chance. And she doesn’t take disturbances lightly.
Harry dives out of the way of the Severing Charm, and spots Matt trying to snatch package. Without getting to his feet, he lunges for it, and manages to grab hold. But it’s slick from the mist on the outside of the repelling layer, and he feels his wand slip from his hand as he yanks the pages out of Matt’s hands. He rolls behind the small pile of stones, taking what little protection they offer, and not caring about the burst of pain in his leg, when he lands there. He can hear curses and hexes being cast, and Hermione’s voice yelling ‘Protego!’ right before a sickening green light bounces off the newly erected shields right in front of his face. He fumbles desperately in his pocket, finally finds his glasses and slams them onto his face, already looking around for his missing wand. He spots it in a small crevice between two stone slabs, where the wall meets the floor. It’s a few paces away, and judging by the pain in his leg, he’ll have to use his arms for support if he’s going to move, which means letting go of the pages. He tucks it against his torso with one hand and arm, and uses the other to lever himself up to get a better look at what’s going on. Hermione must still be under the cloak, somewhere further back, but Draco is standing a few steps behind him to his left, hurling hexes and curses at an impressive speed. He’s focussing so hard on his duel with Bludger that he doesn’t see Matt come at him.
The Firewhiskey burns its way through his system, chasing away the lingering cold and leaving a pleasant buzz in its place. He watches as Malfoy takes a sip, following the bob of his throat as he swallows. Malfoy is still looking a bit pinched, but the Firewhiskey is doing its job, bringing a flush to his cheeks and erasing the frown he’s been wearing since they left Azkaban. Or since they arrived there, actually. Grey eyes meet Harry’s gaze, and Malfoy clears his throat and squares his shoulders.
“NO.” Rose is saying.
“How is it?”
Ron gapes at her. “
“Do you want to ask the questions, or do you want me to?” Ron asks. This is a well worn routine. They go over cases by asking each other questions and providing the answers. Sometimes all it takes is someone asking the right question. Sometimes it’s not even necessary to ask, simply saying things out loud makes the last piece of the puzzle fall into place.
“He’s healthy, physically, but there’s no sign of his magic returning,” Hermione replies. The wobble in her voice is almost inaudible, especially to someone who doesn’t know her well.
Bludger is inside with two of his mates. They haven’t bothered with robes this time, just filthy jeans and faded quidditch shirts and bottles of cheap lager. They look like they’ve Apparated here directly from the pub. One of them is so tall that the Tornadoes shirt he’s wearing reveals a strip of pasty-looking belly fat. The other, Harry recognises from the Beheaded Goblin. He’s young, chubby and unnaturally tanned for winter. He’s wearing a gold chain around his neck and a pair of jeans so baggy they seem like they might drop around his ankles at any moment.. His beefy arms are covered in tattoos, and not exactly the kind that could be considered works of art. Some of them look like he’s spelled them on himself. They’re talking, and Harry roams in his pocket for the Disillusioned Extendable Ear he grabbed from the department. It’s not easy to unroll it by feel, but he manages, and feeds it through the same crack he and Ron used.
“I’m going to pick up Rose now,” she says. “I’m getting curry on the way. Do you want to join us, Harry?”
“Have you both gone mental?” Harry enquires. They both grin at him.
Malfoy bends over with his head low and his hands resting on his knees and takes a few deep, shuddering breaths.
“But it’s the only way to prove that you’re not their leader!”
“Yeah. I figured. There’s not much to talk about, really. They still can’t find anything wrong with me, physically. I’m healthy as a hippogriff, except that I’m a Squib.”
"Yeah. He offered me a trainee position after the war. In case I wanted to escape all the publicity."
“Mother won’t like having Ministry officials here. After the war- It’ll remind her-”
“No problem, Ron. I’ll owl the official report as soon as I can.” She turns around and gives Harry a small smile. “Bye, Harry!”
"What do I think what is, Potter?"
“I heard that, Ronald!” comes the muffled reply from the kitchen.
“What? No!” The look in Malfoy’s eyes is more sincere than Harry has ever seen. There’s no calculation left on his face. Perhaps it’s the Firewhiskey, or just plain exhaustion. “I wanted to be there, and Fath- my father… I suspected that he’d behave like that. It was unpleasant, but it wasn’t really a surprise.” He coughs. “About what he insinuated… I hope you’re not going to spread the word. My friends know… but I like to keep private matters private.”
“Together?” Draco asks.
Harry watches as he folds one slim leg over the other, and his trousers ride up to reveal a sliver of lightly tanned skin, contrasting with the black dragonhide of his boots. He tears his gaze away, but doesn’t like the knowing gleam in Lucius’ eyes at all.
Draco narrows his eyes slightly and raises his wand again. He doesn’t even have time to get nervous, not really. Then he feels his hair being tugged this way and that, before it settles into some elaborate style that’s not at all like his usual scruffy look.
Harry can feel the heat spreading up his neck and across his cheeks. Fuck. He’s probably bright red and splotchy. How did he miss the fact that letting Draco see the memory would mean he’d know about the shoe pissing thing? He looks at his battered old trainers. They’re not looking any worse than they did this morning. The cleaning charm must have been thorough enough. But still…
“Well then. What is it that you need my help with?”
Draco’s busies himself with tea and mugs, hiding his expression in a cloud of steam and a curtain of shiny hair. Harry holds his breath.
“Yes, obviously.” The smirk turns into a small but genuine smile. “Will you Floo me, when you’re done?”
“Yes, I have time. I had Molly pick her up, but the Pensieve in the Department of Mysteries is being used for some very important research. It won’t be available for at least a few days.”
“Father.” Draco offers him a small nod, and takes a seat in one of the two comfortable chairs set out for them.
Very carefully, he reaches out and puts a hand on Draco’s arm. The soft wool of his jumper is a warm caress to the sensitive skin on his newly healed palm. He can feel the muscle underneath trembling slightly. Then Draco’s arm softens under his touch, and Harry leans in the rest of the way, brushing cold lips over warm ones, and breathing in the scent of fresh winter air and man.
“Right. And you’ve already set up Surveillance Charms on the meeting places Smith told you about, which means that you won’t need our help right now. All you have to do is wait for someone to do something stupid. I don’t think you’ll have to wait too long with that lot.”
“Yeah.” Ron is reading over Hermione’s shoulder. “It says something here about a vessel for storing the magic. The Chalice of Infinite Magic.”
Hermione raises her head from the diary. She rubs at her temples for a second, trying to erase the tension, the way she always does after a particularly gruelling reading session. “I think it’ll be about an hour still,” she says. “Plenty of time for you to go and check in with Savage.”
Hermione has been levitating the kettle and an extra mug over to the table, but now they hover in mid-air, while she turns and looks at Draco worriedly.
“Your friend is scary, you know that?”
Draco shakes his head.
Ginny and Angelina are making their way over. Ginny is still holding on to the crate of extendable ears she was stacking, and Angelina is wiping her hand on her robes, ready to greet the new girl.
“A few weeks ago.”
“Diffindo!“
Ron is already grabbing his robes from the rack, and Harry hurries down the corridor to catch up.
“Bloody hell,” Ron whispers. He strokes Rose’s sweaty hair away from her face and shakes his head. “Your mother has gone soft in her old age. But don’t worry. I’ll always be the voice of reason in this family.”
“To get you out.”
"Right. Let's talk about the group of people who call themselves the New Dawn."
Harry moves his head a fragment to indicate a nod.
“Fifi will get a Blood-Replenishing Potion. Monsieur Draco’s friend should wrap the leg.” The little elf snaps her fingers, and a small mountain of white bandages appear. She sends him a stern look. “Be careful. Do not hurt Monsieur Draco. Fifi will be back shortly.”
“If it didn’t set off the trace, then what’s the connection?”
Heal it? He looks down at his arm. A light cloud of steam is rising from the sodden and scorched remains of his sleeve, and underneath, the skin is red and blistering. A dull throbbing, different and somehow even worse than the sharp pain from before penetrates the numbness. He starts unbuttoning his shirt with shaking fingers, but fuck, it hurts now, and his legs are getting sort of wobbly from the adrenaline rush. He slumps against the edge of the desk and blinks up at Draco, trying to figure out how to move his hands.
“Oh, shut up,” Draco snaps. “Or I’ll have you hung in the sunroom, and you’ll fade.”
He holds out his hand, and Harry hands over the next charteque in the pile. He grabs a biscuit of his own, before he goes back to the file.
“Don’t worry about me, Potter. I’ll be perfectly fine. It might be best if I calm down a bit before I go home, though. It wouldn’t be fair to Mother if she saw me this unsettled...”
He extracts the memory of what happened, before thinking about it too much can make his own thoughts interfere with the pure sensory memory. When he’s drawn the silver strand from his temple, he stoppers the vial, and closes his eyes, letting the conversation between the Death Eaters unfold again in his mind. Fuck, he misses Ron right now! Going over this by himself feels all kinds of wrong. He tries to look at the information from all angles, but somehow, knowing that he can’t bounce his ideas back and forth with Ron keeps tripping him up.
Draco flips the book open and points to a section written in green ink and underlined in black.
“It doesn’t really mean anything…” he hedges. “I mean… It just means that they haven’t done that particular spell before.”
“Sorry to interrupt,” he pants. “But they’ve found a witness!”
He leans forward and takes a look inside. He catalogues the room carefully. There’s only one door, and the window is too narrow to be used as an escape route. He can feel the anti-Apparition wards, like a lingering claustrophobia, pressing in on all his senses. It’s not the sensation that’s unpleasant. Not really. It’s the awareness of what it means that makes his skin crawl and his heart slam almost painfully against his ribs.
“She’s at the playground with your mum.”
Savage takes off her reading glasses and leans forward in her comfortable leather chair. She rests her arms on her desk and levels Harry with a look that makes it perfectly clear that she wants this conversation to end. Now.
“You might call ’em that, yeah.”
Lucius standing in a room full of patterned chintz and doilies. A fat, white cat is winding itself around his legs and purring. He tries to charm Adrienne Wright with smiles and gentlemanly manners. He tries to reason with her and appeal to her pure-blood upbringing. He tries to buy the information with gold. Finally, he loses his temper. A terrified house-elf is hiding behind an overstuffed, floral armchair as he threatens her with the wrath of the Dark Lord. Adrienne doesn’t even hesitate. She just asks her house-elf to escort their guest to the door, and before Harry knows it, Lucius Malfoy finds himself being unceremoniously dumped at the doorstep, and the door slams shut behind him.
Cold numbness spreads through Harry’s body and settles like a lump of ice in the pit of his stomach. He starts to pull away, but Draco stops him with a hand on his chest.
“You’re back!” Draco says.
“Let’s get this one back for questioning.” Ron nods at Smith. “Might not be the one you were thinking it was, but he’s still a shitty little coward!” He grabs his wand and conjures a length of rope. Except nothing happens.
“A chalice!” Hermione says. “Of course! Like the one on the pendant. And the cuff links!”
“Protego!” Hermione yells, but the curse is already cutting through the air. It slides off the shield in front of Draco, and is deflected right toward where he’s hiding. He acts on pure instinct, curls up in a tiny ball behind his small stone hideaway, with the package cradled protectively against his chest. There’s a deafening crack that leaves his ears ringing, as the stones in front of him splinter. He feels the package starting to slide out of his hands, and desperately grasps at the torn pillowcase with numb fingers. And then there’s Draco’s arm around him and Hermione’s voice in his ear telling him that she’s got his wand, and the sickening tug behind his navel that tells him that they’re Disapparating.
