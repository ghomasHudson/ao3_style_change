As if on cue, the door burst open and in came Harry and the two other Gryffindor’s...Dean and...Sean? Maybe? Harry entered, with a smug smile that made Draco’s heart beat a few paced faster, and held up a full cart of Fire Whiskey. “Who’s ready?”
“Don’t think so Potter.” Draco rolled his eyes, but then he felt Harry’s face be drawn to his and soon their lips were pressed together. Their kiss was gentle, affirming, and absolutely necessary. The kiss you give someone who lets them take you apart, and be taken apart in return.
“As we’re Gryffindor’s, I don’t think you would have seen us much anyway. Name’s Barren.” The leader, apparently Barren which is an incredibly un-Gryffindor name in Draco’s opinion, scoffed. “This is Wes” he nodded at the other guy, “and Kel” he nodded at the girl. Draco couldn’t help but think it sounded a lot like ‘kill’.
“I’m-“ Harry began only to be cut off by “if you say I’m sorry I’ll pitch you off the tower” snapped Draco, hating how tight his voice was becoming. “I am” Harry whispered, taking Draco’s hand and gently rubbing small circles into it with his palm. Draco was over come with this...disgusting guilt because he wanted to badly to be comforted torn by the knowledge that he deserved these scars.
Draco took a deep breath, glancing over at Harry one more time before closing his eyes and screaming, “FUCK IT!”
Draco hissed impatiently but Harry smirked, pulling back. Instead of doing down, Harry sat up which to Draco’s dismay. However, his retort died when Harry’s intense gaze met his and Harry started unbuttoning his own shirt. Draco watched, the thought that he had never seen Golden Boy undress before winding through his head.
Draco had to walk around Hogwarts, filled with mostly people who hated him. As Draco was carefully applying the glamor’s, even doing the ones on his chest just incase, Harry came up behind him, hugging him. Draco melted into the touch, finding it stabilizing as the imperfections were spelled away.
“Please...fuck me” Draco whispered, whimpering with each thrust. Harry moaned, nodding before he kept his grip on Malfoy’s waist and spun them. Draco’s back slammed against the bed. In an instant, Harry had tucked Draco’s legs over his shoulders and pushed into him again. The new angle was electric. Harry felt himself pulse inside Draco’s heat, leaning down to kiss an incoherent Draco.
It took Malfoy another three minutes, Harry should know, he counted, to appear. His clothes had been dried, blood disappeared except for a faint rosy stain, though Harry could have just been imagining it. He let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“One of those things will happen” Draco shrugged, nudging into Harry’s chest. Harry immediately wrapped his arms around Draco, holding him close.
Draco shook his head in what he hoped was a casual manner “It’s stupid. I tripped, on one of the table and I...that’s why I didn’t tell you.” When Draco looked up he was met with suspicious eyes.
Draco couldn’t help but laugh, though it sounded a bit wet. A bit like a sob. “I just...I get so anxious. That I’m doing everything right, that I’m pleasing everyone. I know I don’t come off as a people pleaser, but that’s because most of my life I was trying to please my father and I was so afraid I-...I was in so much pain that I lost empathy for others and gods-“ Draco cut his rambling, burying his face in his hands. “I’m so sick of feeling like this.” He held his left arm up, the Mark and the deep scar present.
After a little more, Draco reached down to stroke himself, needing more friction. Harry let him, tightening his grip on Draco’s thighs and the thought of him bruising from Harry’s grip on him made Draco’s toes curl.
Draco thought dejectedly, turning and climbing back up as quietly as possible. He had just sat back down, wrapping the blanket around him when he heard footsteps. Immediately, Draco stood up, hand drawn. It was really an instinct at this point, as an ex-death eater.
Draco’s eyes widened, his mouth stilling, only for a moment before taking a shaking breath and continued. He reached back, widening his knees. He pulled off for a moment to mutter some spells but soon resumed his musings. Harry watched, transfixed as Draco reached behind him. After a moment his eyes fluttered.
Quidditch trials went alright. Honestly, if anything it was a decent distraction from the pain while also being a good time to plan what the hell he was gonna tell Potter. I mean he was going to have to walk
After multiple rounds of explaining the instructions, everyone was ready to play. The drinking rules were simple, shot before, shot if you got out, and if you were already out, a sip every time someone else got out.
So taking a deep breath, and looking intensely at the ceiling, Draco grabbed onto the table and pulled himself up. Even without putting pressure on it, his ankle ached. He gently, put it down, audibly groaned in pain and quickly picked it back up. Broom it is then.
The rest of the opening speech came and went, Harry much to distracted to hear any of it. The feast had just begun when Harry slipped out, taking a sandwich with him. The noise was just...hundreds of students in one Great Hall was a stark contrast to the silence of Grimmauld Place. He’d get used to it, just...not yet.
Harry didn’t respond as his mouth was rather occupied, having finally swallowed Draco fully. Draco felt tension pool in his stomach. His brain having a hard time thinking of anything besides how hot and wet Harry felt around him, so he didn’t try to.
“Right, right uh...I’m gonna have a shower.” Draco muttered, feeling so guilty and so annoyed at himself. Draco just felt too naked, literally and metaphorically.
Granger rolled her eyes, playing for casualty. “It was second year” she dismissed, “and for like two weeks.”
Harry, the boy who countered the Dark Lord with Expelliarmus, looked about ready to kill someone. He was pacing now, trying to expel the rage that boiled through him but to no avail. He’s always been a protective person but especially now, when Harry’s finally,
“To? To what, Potter? Be eloquent, please” Draco teased, both with his words and his hand. Harry rolled his eyes, leaning forward and kissing the smirk right off his face. When he pulled back, Harry whispered, “Do you want me to fuck you, Draco?”
Well, if nothing else the next few hours certainly won’t be the worst thing Harry’s lived through in the castle in the very least. On his walk to Gryffindor common room, Harry couldn’t stop scanning those who walked past him, anger making his skin crawl, as though Draco’s assailants would just come up and announce themselves to him. But then again, maybe they would. Stranger things had happened. Either way, nothing deterred him from glaring suspiciously as every Gryffindor who walked past him.
Draco rolled his eyes, “Merlin knows why. You looked like you had a dog on your head the entire year.”
Draco had to look away from the earnestness in Harry’s eyes. “No...I just...it would be so much easier for you, if you just let me go.” He whispered, squeezing Harry’s hand. The hand squeezed back then tugged Draco into a hug, holding him tightly.
Draco moaned, aroused beyond cognition as he felt himself be surrounded by Harry. Harry thrust into him hard, again and again. “I’m gonna-“ Draco whimpered, but cut himself off as Harry buried himself deep in Draco, who came on Harry’s name. Draco felt himself clench around Harry, his stomach tight, and his vision blur. The hot pulse in him as Harry came only spurred Draco on more.
Draco nodded, realizing he had never thought of Potter’s scar as...well as scar. It was always this mark of glory. “I guess you do.” He whispered back.
Draco moaned, the sensation bursting into every part of his body. When Harry looked up at him, tongue still fuckin into Draco, with such sincere want, it was too much. Draco’s moan turned horse, his breathing stopped as pulses of pleasure took over his body. Distantly, he was aware of Potter stroking him through it, but all Draco could really feel were the tremors of pleasure as his body found release.
Draco smirked, working his palm over Harry, enjoying the rush of power it gave him in making the Golden One feel good, be so responsive to his hand.
Harry broke off after a moment, kissing down Draco’s neck, “no marks, I know” before Draco could remind him. He traced down the scars on Draco’s chest with his mouth, eyes flicking up to check Draco’s face. Draco was just staring at him, hands still held int Harry’s hair. Maybe he felt safer, like he had control of the situation.
“Mate, you answered truthfully, you don’t have to drink” Blaise commented but Draco barely heard, too busy staring at Potter who was looking forlornly into his glass.
The group had gone on ahead, back to the locker room, by the time Draco snapped out of his thought. Boy Wonder was still there though. Damn him.
. He thought he was just playing into Harry’s fantasy but maybe this was something for him too. He shook his head, thoughts later, Harry now.
“I distinctly recall you just said this was ‘for me.’ Draco fake pouted though at this point his resolve was pretty weak. He was getting hard from
“Who’re you?” Harry spat, his voice thin. Weasel had stood up behind Harry, looking like he was ready to grab him less he acting stupidly. Which was entirely likely.
Draco heard silence, but also some cheers. Well, that was a nice touch. When he turned the corner, out of the view from the Great Hall, he saw that Harry had followed up. Draco bit his lip, holding back a laugh. Harry was grinning like an idiot, though he was still tense as though he wanted to go back and break Barren’s ankles himself. Harry hurried towards him, walking right up to Draco and pulled him into a kiss.
Immediately, the students who had been making their way to class stopped, forming a circle as to what would probably be the most entertaining part of their day. Barren looked confused at Harry’s action, offering up a smile. “Just trying to keep the halls safe.”
Immediately, Draco wrapped himself around Harry. He’d seen Draco after they’d fucked last night but this was a new Draco, this was a fucked out Draco and it was one the most endearing things Harry had ever seen.
“Why didn’t you draw your wand?” Harry called after him eventually. Malfoy stopped, halfway down the corridor.
Because Draco’s done casual sex. He’s done empty classroom, spell prep, sex and it serves its purpose. But it’s always been dark. Quick. Wordless. Not about who but the act.
” insisted Malfoy, knowing using his name would get Harry’s attention, “just go back first. I’ll go after. It’s not like we don’t share a room anyway.”
As soon as the door shut, Draco let out a breath. It felt like he aged at least five years. Harry even seem more relieved now, collapsing over Draco, nuzzling back to where he used to be. Draco immediately wrapped his arms around him, pulling Harry’s face up so Draco could press his lips to his.
Harry’s pulse raced under Draco’s lips. He pressed, sucked, and bit along Harry’s collar bone while his other hand took Harry fully out of his pants. The heavy weight sat nicely in his hands and he ran his thumb gently across the tip.
Harry watched, trying to process everything Draco just said but was even more confused when, very quickly, Draco turned around and kissed him.
“I regret being so afraid” Potter said finally, making pointed eye contact with Draco before raising his glass in cheers, taking the shot and then another.
Harry watched Draco’s face intently, trying not to be too distracting by the hand Draco had on his cock incase he hurt him. After a while, and enjoying watching Malfoy growing increasingly desperate, Draco finally whispered, “I’m ready. Do it.”
“I don’t think I’ve cried since...since that night in the bathrooms...” Draco whispered, trying really hard to dampen the embarrassment that threatened to creep in.
“You don’t have to-“ Harry whispered but was cut off by Draco’s tongue, and a skillful twist of his wrist. It didn’t take long until Harry was moaning Draco’s name, coating Draco’s hand as he came.
Draco did, blushing immediately with the care Harry was looking at him with. Harry smiled, kissing Draco one more time before continuing to unbutton Draco’s shirt. They both held their breath as Harry undid the last button and pushed the fabric away from the scars. They looked deeper in the shadow of the room. Harry looked down, took a breath, and looked up locking eyes with Draco. Harry’s eyes were hooded, guilt pooled behind his irises. Draco reached up, taking Harry’s hand in his and placed it on his chest, right over the worst scar.
for Draco. Even before his scars, which amplified it in a different way. He would limit his meals, keep journals of his weight. His body was his temple, one he had spent years constructing. To know someone, and especially someone that was publicly qualified as
“What happened” Potter demanded, his voice tight and demanding. When Draco shook his head, Potter only stepped closer, forcibly maneuvering Draco’s arm around Harry’s shoulders. “Draco.”
Harry growled, genuinely growled Draco would not admit how hot he found it, and surged forward, kissing Draco intensely. Draco gasped, overcome by how intensely Potter was kissing him, like he needed to catch up. Between lips and teeth, Draco mumbled something and his own vest and shirt were spelled away. They needed to be cleaned now anyway and there was no way Potter was going to make it through all those buttons.
years got there, he brushed his fingers along his thighs were he knew Potter’s fingers were bruised into him. He ran his fingers over his collar bone, where his skin still tingled from Potter’s kisses. Before he finally placed his hand on his heart, and felt it beat against his hands, beat for that Stupid Potter boy. Harry. Draco smiled into his broom polish as he corrected himself, before the smile quickly faded as the sound of footsteps approached.
gorgeous. I’m interested in messy, unkept, exciting, rough, real love. And-and I’m not saying that- I know we’re just starting off but to...give you an idea, that’s what I need. And I think that’s what you need to.”
Upon arriving, he saw that Harry was already there. Wearing just a t-shirt and sweatpants, Draco took a moment to admire Potter in his fully glory before zooming past him. If he was going to convince Potter he was fine, it had to be all out. “Too slow, Potter” he teased.
“Ah, yes thank you for that helpful advice. Let me just tell them to ‘bugger off’ that’ll fix it” came Draco’s dry reply.
Harry ran his hands down Draco’s chest, this time lifting the shirt off Draco’s shoulders and it too joined Harry’s clothes on the floor. Once again Harry’s fingers arrived at Draco’s waist line but this time they nimbly started undoing the buttons, then Harry fuckin Potter, the Boy Who Lived, took Draco’s zipper between his teeth and tugged. And fuck if that wasn’t one of the hottest things Draco had ever seen.
The warm water gently pattered over them as they stood there, Harry gently holding onto Draco, who seemed to give himself over completely. “It’s hard for me to accept affection.” Mumbled Draco into Harry’s chest after a while. “My parents never hugged me. Mother sometimes did when I was younger but...appearances and all that. And anyone I’ve ever...fucked.” Draco spat out, “didn’t care who I was, actually I think they didn’t want it to be me. Or like I was a bet or a dare or a challenge. No one’s ever,
Harry kneed over Malfoy, forgetting magic for the moment, just focused on the need to stop, stop this all from happening. “I’m- I’m so sorry Draco I didn’t know what it did- I didn’t-“ he stuttered, watching the man who had fascinated him, taken over his life bleed away under him.
The jealousy pushed Harry up the stairs, the need to protect kept him close behind Draco. The just pure lust he felt at seeing Draco in that outfit kept his eyes wandering. The rage was still there, making his steps heavy. Still with half a mind to go back and teach Barren a lesson. Draco was probably aware of that, because he made sure to make his way to the 8
But eventually they did have to pull back. Draco did first, saying that they had both been gone for too long and people would draw conclusions.
“Harry” Draco repeated, firmer this time to try and call him back to reality. “It was a long time ago. They don’t hurt I...” he cut off because he couldn’t exactly say it was okay, because it had been one of the scariest moments of Draco’s life, which was an accomplishment to achieve.
“Bloody liar” Draco protested, but Harry cut him off again. “Okay, yeah I do want to sleep with you but I...I want more than that. Much more than that.”
Draco felt like he had shut down and was in the beginning of a reboot. Affection. Cannot compute. Eventually he stuttered out a, “when are your classes?”
“Merlin Harry” Draco moaned, grateful he had the thought to put the silencing charms up. The sight of Harry’s fingers disappearing between his legs was almost too much. The fingers were a lot, but not nearly enough at the same time. He reached down, wrapping his long fingers around Harry’s length, stroking it. Harry moaned, stopping their kiss as he fought to regain to control over his breathing. Draco kept stroking lightly, relishing the feeling of Harry’s fingers fucking into him.
Draco transformed back his mug, indignantly, but the tea tasted much more...earthy now and he put it down in defeat. “Why do you even care? Why tell me this?”
Draco’s hair, instead of sleeked down, had more volume. He had allowed some the front few strands to curl, while the rest were pushed back. Yes, Draco thought as he admired himself in the mirror, Harry’s going to have a miserable time. And truthfully, Draco felt more like himself than he had in a while.
Draco felt his back hit the door, hard. Harry had him pressed against the door, hands still gripping Draco’s thighs to hold him up but now Harry was pressed right in between Draco’s legs, right into his crotch and Draco couldn’t help the obscene moan that escaped his mouth. Thank Merlin for silencing charms.
“I’m not hurt, I told you just a little sore I just....” Draco sighed, “I’m not used to....kindness.” He winced at his words. Even to him, that sounded a tad dramatic even if it was true.
moan into each other’s mouths. Draco smirked in satisfaction, eyes fluttering with the immediate satisfaction of feeling roll his hips back, creating a glorious,
“I hate my dad more than anything in the world.” Draco began suddenly, “he’s a repugnant, evil, homophobic man and I’m happy he’s sitting,
“Fine” sighed Draco and with another flick, the bottle spun again. Out of the corner of his eye, Draco swore he saw Harry flick his wand. Why was it in his hand? He was too busy looking at Harry and his slight murmuring until a chorus of “ooooooo”s broke him out. It had landed on Harry.
“My uncle and my aunt locked me in a closet underneath the stairs for twelve years.” Harry whispered, kissing Draco’s wrist. As though he needed something good to prepare him for a bad thought. “They knew I was magical but didn’t tell me. Not for twelve years.”
Not for long, of course, Harry returned in under ten minutes with two sandwiches and a plate of biscuits in hand. He set them down, and Draco started eating immediately. They ate in silence, both starving. It was only when Draco had finished his first biscuit that he again whispered, “kiss me?”
He put his glamor’s back up before whispering “alohamora” he whispered, the door opening to reveal...Luna? The only other person close to as pale as Draco was stood in the doorway, smiling whimsically. “Hello Draco.”
The brunette’s eyes widened, a moan echoing through their conjoined mouths. They stayed like that for a few seconds longer, before Draco pulled back. “Be good.” And dropped to his knees.
Harry almost flinched at the touch, so caught up in his head, but relaxed immediately, almost becoming shy when Draco saw the blood seeping from his knuckles. “Nothing Hermione can’t fix.”
“What about you?” Draco asked, slightly scared at hearing the answer. “When could I have kissed you?”
Draco thinks distantly, his entire body feeling like it’s being sucked dry by a thousand paper cuts.
“Because I don’t care” Malfoy whispered, the repeated louder. “Because I do not care, Potter.” And with that, he turned the corner, leaving Harry staring after him.
time that day both considered just making the door invisible. But Draco was the one that realized that they hadn’t locked it this time.
“I’ll be fine, you know” Draco insisted, thinking the pillow stack underneath his ankle was a bit much.
“Here boy”, Blaise called smugly and Ron begrudgingly crawled over to him, glaring at Dean and Seamus.
Draco nodded, feeling his heart ache at how choked up Harry had become. “But think of how many you did save.”
. Harry noticed a decent amount of guys, and girls but Harry wasn’t worried about them, looking at Draco in a similar way to Harry. Except they weren’t sitting on their hands. In fact, as Draco approached the 8
between he and Draco and the past months but they hadn’t talked. About any of it. Ever. And now that they were finally on the same side, maybe, just maybe they could finally just talk.
who was the bloody Chosen One. It was also just a bit hot, having Harry be so protective of him. A novel feeling. “This is why we can never be public.” Draco whispered, watching for Harry’s reaction.
“Not gonna- last-“ Harry panted, the slap of skin on skin mixed with the banging of Draco’s back into the door was a symphony. Draco’s incoherent babbling the soloist.
Dean, or was this one Seamus, was going on about explaining the rules to what sounded like a torture exercise in a slippery, colorful rug, Draco regarded Potter. He looked...awful frankly. When no one was looking at him Potter’s usually bright face was deep set with exhaustion, his eyes bleary as he stared into- Draco quickly looked away, taking a sip of his drink as Potter locked eyes with him.
“Your ankle” Harry gasped, breaking away from their kiss before he got too carried away. It took a considerable amount of will power. “We can’t...it’ll hurt.”
Harry whined but Draco just pressed another finger in. “Quiet” Draco snapped, his whispered transforming into more of a bite. After a few more moments of teasing, Draco removed his fingers from Harry’s mouth and wrapped that hand around Harry, keeping eye contact as he pumped him from base to tip.
“Let him. Give him something to discover” Harry teased back, pushing back against Draco to kissing him hungrily. Draco responded just as fiercely before pulling back again.
That made everyone’s eyes widen. Did he say that out loud? Guess he did. Not like it was a massive secret anyway. People probably had suspicions.
Taking advantage of Harry’s momentary distraction, Draco moved his lips to Harry’s dark skinned neck, aiming for the spot just below his jaw, and bit, working hard to leave Harry a lasting mark there because apparently he was feeling possessive of someone he had not right to be.
gotten Draco into his arms it seemed extremely unfair that Harry would need to fight to keep him there.
“Much more myself” Draco teased back, but it was so genuine that Harry couldn’t help but smile. He did look much more himself.
“Yes, actually. Because...I couldn’t go on letting everything matter so much, you know? Let the things that really matter, the really important bits, they’ll stick out but the rest, why bother?”
he realized, the words coming out before he knew they would. “I want to jump” he whispered, so softly, like in defeat, eyes looking at the ledge.
Immediately, Harry’s hand curled into a fist, ready to step in if this fucker tried anything. But instead of hurting, Tom (?) just looking Draco up and down and smiled.
Draco turned, ignoring Barren’s presence all together. Harry saw red begin to cloud his vision. If breaking Draco’s ankle was Barren’s introduction, he shuddered to think what would follow. Not that Harry would allow it of course.
“You called me your boyfriend. You’ve never done that” Harry explained, eyes trailing from Draco’s eyes down to his lips and back up again, just in time to see Draco roll his eyes.
“Thinking. You got all tense. Stoppit. It’s too early for thinking.” Harry mumbled, sleep making his voice deep and husky and
. Draco then felt himself being lifted upward by strong hands underneath his thighs. Instinctively, Draco wrapped his legs around Harry’s waist. Both groaned as their crotches ground against the other, desperate for friction.
“What do you have for the rest of the day?” Harry mumbled into Draco’s skin which buzzed with each word.
Harry smiled, leaning in to kiss Draco, keeping his arms wrapped tightly around him, never wanting to let go.
Now, tangling himself with a bunch of his classmates that surely hated him wasn’t on his to-do list, but Luna dragged him up and you just...can’t say no to Luna. So Draco, Harry, Pansy, Granger and...where did Luna go? Just those four were up, standing unsure on the edge of the mat.
Draco got up off his chair, crossing the circle to Granger and kneeling down in front of her. He checked for a nod, that it was okay, before lightly pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth, really her cheek.
“Alright...left foot blue.” Easy. He’s totally got this. Weasley could call whatever he wanted, this was totally do able.
Draco stopped breathing, the genuineness in the movement combined with the look of tumultuous regret that filled Potter’s face was too much. He opened his mouth to speak, but what would he say?
Draco tore his gaze away from where he was tracing along the scars on his torso with malice, and to the door. “You can come in.” Draco called, though it might not have come out all that loudly. Either way, within a second Harry had pulled the door open. His eyes wide and concerned. After a moment, Harry shut the door behind him. Through the frosted glass door, Draco could see Harry step cautiously closer to the shower.
“Really?” asked Blaise which was followed by Pansy’s “of course you twat.” Draco wouldn’t allow himself to look at Potter.
The stretch was incredible. Draco bit his lip to stop himself from groaning in pain. Harry had prepared him, but there was still a size discrepancy between fingers and what was currently working its way between Draco’s legs. He let out a breath, stopping halfway.
Well, fuck. Draco’s only choice was to put his right leg over Potter’s right arm and suddenly Draco felt a horrifically noticeable blush paint his face because his crotch was suddenly
Harry planted a kiss a little lower on Draco’s neck, pulling at the blonde until he was seated in Harry’s lap. Draco looked down at him, eyes wide in confusion and lust. “Tonight feels too...personal for that.”
“Not yet” Harry countered, biting down on Draco’s collar bone for good measure. When there was a knock on the door for the
Truthfully, Harry couldn’t take Draco asking for the second morning in a row about whether this was a mistake. It had been painful to convince the blonde to give them a try already. And with some people already set against them, it seemed unfair that Harry should have to fight Draco too.
“Get on with it then” Draco dismissed, sounding bored. The three chuckled, and Draco briefly wondered if he had looked this pathetic in his younger years.
“Another. Another please Harry” Draco pleaded after a while, spreading his legs further to emphasize. “If don’t feel you in me soon, I’m going to combust” Draco announced dramatically, moaning deeply when Harry pressed a third one finger in.
He moaned around Harry’s cock which made Harry thrust sharply into Draco’s mouth. “Sorry, sorry sorry-“ Harry stuttered, thumb gently rubbing Draco’s cheek. It was fifthly. And he loved it. Watching Draco
“Gryffindor common room. Fifteen minutes. Or I’ll send Neville” Hermione prompted, waiting until Harry nodded before waving goodbye to Draco and exiting the room.
to be public, Draco.” Harry countered, leaning in close to Draco’s face, putting his other hand gently on Draco’s face.
After a moment, as they both settled into the after glow, Harry pressed another kiss onto Draco’s lips. “Did you feel good?”
Harry grinned cheekily, his hips rocking lightly up to meet Draco’s decided still ones. “He wasn’t going to enter....you look good up there you know.”
“We’re onto you and Golden Boy” Barren sneered and Draco’s heart stopped. “You know you’re rooming together. Don’t you dare think that you’ll get away with killing him now, because we’ll be watching you-“
Harry put his hand on Draco’s squeezing it, “I did mean for tonight to be more...” he interlaced his fingers with Draco’s and pulled his hand off of his arm. “I’m not sorry, or anything before you say anything like that I just...I’m not good with...emotions.” Harry finished slowly, looking up to find Draco’s eyes watching him intently.
he heard he came hard. He felt his whole body tremble, aware of nothing except his hips jerking wildly as he tried to drive Draco to the edge as well.
Draco watched him pace, feeling the rage radiate off of him. He wouldn’t lie, it was felt good to have someone one his side, not just someone his
When Harry stepped out of his pants Draco felt his jaw drop open. Firstly, the shamelessness of it all was delicious, paired with seeing all of Harry. Unabashed, toned,
. ‘No, oh no oh nonononono’ Harry panics internally, watching pools of crimson blood well up out of Malfoy’s stark white shirt that covers his twitching body.
“You’re deflecting again” Draco scolded, raising an eyebrow in return. “I’m not- I’m not trying to pry or compare battle scars or anything I’m just...you can talk to me, Harry. If we’re...if we’re gonna give this thing a proper go, I think talking to each other is..”
“Get up here” Harry whispered, placing his hands on Draco’s waist and pulled him until Draco straddled him. He looked so good up there, Harry had to work not to come on the spot.
Especially when Harry lightly traced Draco’s collar bone then stopped at his shirt buttons. Draco bit his lip, knowing this was the point when all went wrong last time. Harry ghosted his fingers down Draco’s torso and the blonde shivered. Harry leaned down kissing at the bottom of the scar on Draco’s face, right below the jaw and kissing up it at the same time his hands rubbed at where Draco’s nipples were.
When they finally pulled apart, both with small smiles on their lips, Draco didn’t let him get far. Harry’s hands were framing Draco’s face, his green eyes looking gently in Draco’s. Draco closed his eyes, opting instead to meld with mouth into Harry’s. This morning felt like everyone had more of a right to Draco’s life than he had. A consistent feeling, really since the trials. He need
Draco bit his own lip hard to not give Harry the satisfaction of moaning at his voice alone. Draco nodded, leaning in to brush his lips against Harry’s, pale eyes meeting piercing green ones before whispering, “yes, I want you to fuck me...
As Harry stood there, hugging the man who he cared so much for, he played the conversation he had to have with Ginny in his mind. And of course to walk around the castle as the Chosen One, the castle where he lost so much.
“Well, why do you care? March into Gryffindor common room and beat them up? I told you, I’m not welcome here. Whatever.” Draco assured, trying his best to appear casual. Part of him would want nothing more than for Harry to stand up for him. Let the whole school see that Harry chose
Eventually, Draco pulled back, not going far, partially because Harry wouldn’t let him. “I don’t...thank you for telling me this Draco I...I can’t imagine this is easy or comfortable but I’m...I want to help you.”
Harry was face to face with Barren, who still looked like he was waiting for Harry to praise him. Draco glanced around and saw basically the entire Great Hall stare at them. Part of Draco just wanted Harry to play along with it. It would make it easier. But Draco knew that look.
the door closed and Draco didn’t have the worry about the cloak, it fell to the ground and Harry slammed Draco against the door. Instantly, locking and silencing charms were murmured by Draco while Harry spelled away their clothes. Harry hooked the fingers he had inside of Draco, “you’re mad.” He laughed, preening at the way Draco shuddered beneath him.
Potter sucks in a lungful of air the moment Draco connects their fingers. Draco can feel it too: the expanse of magic, deeper than the rolling sea and twice as chaotic.
apartment, he realized immediately as he glanced around at her messy kitchen, the stacks of books that seemed to spring from every possible surface and cubby. She’d been training for some promotion in the Ministry or other, Draco recalled reading in
Potter blinked at him, and Draco felt himself grow angrier still — because of course he thought this would be okay. Of course he thought he could just swoop back into Draco’s life, that they could just pick up where they left off like he hadn’t just up and left one day and never returned. Because for Potter, everyone’s life succumbed to his; his attention was such a rare, cherished thing that he could sprinkle it wherever he liked with no consistency, and people would just lap it up. Hell, Granger and Weasley were probably used to only seeing him on his own erratic schedule, when he wasn’t fucking off doing whatever it was a war hero does on his victory lap.
Harry exhaled, deflating a bit, which brought Draco some amount of satisfaction. He caught a few glares from the Potter Heads who milled around the shop, jealously waiting until Potter’s attention would free up again. Draco considered playing dumb; for all Potter knew, the Polyjuice hadn’t worn off that night in Granger’s flat until after Draco left. Maybe he could pretend he didn’t know this secret of Potter’s, didn’t know anything about him, and then maybe this time he wouldn’t get sucked up into it again.
“You want more,” Draco says again as Potter stains his neck with pink kisses. “You could do so much. You could be so much.”
much, but not like this, and none of my Reviving charms are working, and we think a Propago Potion might help, but I’m not sure of the interactions, and so I wanted someone to check my work, but no one at Hogwarts will owl back, so I just reckoned —”
Draco could almost believe it: the tenderness in Potter’s hands, his kisses. He could almost believe there was something deeper than need here, than power. He could almost believe that Potter cared that Draco was slowly withering away, fading into nothing while Potter’s power grew.
Draco laughs. Potter doesn’t like that. It shows in the way he crashes his lips against Draco’s, kissing him like it’s a punishment. He bites at Draco’s bottom lip until the metallic taste of blood fills his mouth. Potter pushes his tongue between Draco’s lips, greedy for every last drop.
“My business?” the man repeated again, glancing down at the sachet of scales in his hands. His face twisted solemnly, and Draco was almost a bit disappointed that it seemed so easy to talk him out of whatever illicit behavior he was obviously engaged in.
And that’s how the morning was. Harry was absolutely terrible at washing hair, unsurprisingly, but Draco didn’t complain. Or well, he did. But he did it productively. Harry absolutely did not get a hard on when Draco washed his hair. That would be ridiculous. Too bad Draco was so proud of himself.
“That’s a lot of deserves.” Draco muttered, still spaced out. His concentration had slipped and his glamors had faded. Now the scars along his arm, chest, and face were all too prevalent. But this was so easy, so familiar. It was nearly every day of sixth year, even fifth year. Which were only mildly better than fourth and third year. Well, actually probably a lot better.
But of course, after the three words there’s the end of the sentence. And for them, that end was a knock at the door and a distinct Weasley voice, “Harry? Why’s your door locked? Quidditch try outs today, mate....Harry?”
in Azkaban.” He took a breath, eyes scanning over to Harry to watch his reaction. “But I know when he’s gone I’d miss him more than anything. The memory of what he could have been, really.”
Stealing Harry’s Invisibility Cloak for voyeurism? They hadn’t even held hands in public. The only inclination that this might be something Harry would be interested in was when Weasel was knocking on their door and Harry pulled Draco on top, or how Harry reacted when Draco kissed him earlier, or actually come to think of it how Harry was absolutely down to fuck Draco in the Astronomy Tower-
, tears. Draco was crying. The first tear had slipped out with his confession, and the rest had followed. His body shook now, the panic and guilt erupting from him in sobs. Harry tugged him quickly towards him, his strong arms wrapping around Draco and holding him securely against him. Harry was in shock, only running on his instinct that told him to
“You’re the one that wants this” Harry reminded him, really trying to restrain himself from just wrecking Draco right there. Or maybe on the door...
Draco stepped forward, slowly, fully into Harry’s space and slowly ran a hand through his hair, resting it in those wild(ly soft) curls, the other hand traced Harry’s lips lightly with his thumb. Was Potter- no there’s no way Potter would be blushing at this. Satisfied, Draco shifted the hand on Harry’s lips to take purchase in his hair as well before he leaned forward, and just said
“I just mean that...what if this was just sexual. There’s been tension between us for years, yes you know there has, and we just needed a...release.”
“Twat” Harry countered smugly, as Draco pulled back. He stayed in Harry’s arms but wasn’t pressed against him anymore. “I’m sorry I triggered this, I was just trying to make sure you’re okay.”
“What are you thinking about then?” Draco asked, doing his best to sound casual but somewhat amazed he felt so bold.
So Draco just nodded, busying himself for carding his hand through Potter’s hair in what was hopefully a smoothing manner. After a moment, Draco felt Harry shift again and he quickly went to pull his hand away. Harry caught the pale hand, which looked exceptionally pale against Potter’s own dark sin, and brought it to his lips, kissing it.
The words “I love you” hung around the air, were pressed into the others mouths with tongues, but weren’t said. Because it had been less than 24 hours, because what if the other ran, if it was too much, too soon. The words “I love you” were made physical by Harry’s hands on Draco’s waist, pulling him closer and holding him there. By Draco’s lips pressing into Harry’s, by his tongue tracing the words he couldn’t say.
that Harry would actually keep quiet, Draco surged forward and kissed him. Well, less of a kiss more of a merging of mouths. Harry kissed him hard, wrapping his hands instantly in Draco’s hair, fingers finding purchase in the once neat hair.
“I actually just did” Draco teased, though it wasn’t harsh. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you who it was...but you know now.” He whispered, knowing they were going to talk about it eventually.
Draco’s eyes flicked to Harry, smirking slightly before he looked back at the guy. “Can I help you?”
. “Is this okay, Draco?” Harry asked, his face dangerously close to Draco’s ass, it was tremendously distracting.
See? Told you I'd update it. This chapter takes a lot of twists and turns, hope you enjoy! Also comments truly make my day.
Draco, for his part, shrugged off the two goonies who ran to help Barren. His first instinct was to run. All this unwanted attention, Harry
Draco shrugged, “I’ll tell you later.” He whispered a cleaning spell, ridding both of them of stickiness. Harry pressed another yet another kiss against Draco’s lips, “thank you for giving us a chance.”
Harry watched as Draco, keeping his eyes on Harry, slowly dropped his jaw and stuck his tongue out. He rested just the tip of Harry on his tongue, coaxing along slowly, tasting him. Slowly, Draco leaned forward and Harry bit down
“I don’t want to hurt you.” Harry whispered, rolling onto his side so he was facing a blushing Draco. He couldn’t help but smile, taking his hands and running them up Draco’s back.
Alive, but only just so. Even for Malfoy, he looked sickly pale. His white skin contrasted harshly with the dark circles, highlighting the hollow look in his eyes. Harry watched as Malfoy fiddled with the ring he knew Malfoy always wore harshly, not quite worked up the courage to step out fully. Not for the first time, Harry considered the privilege, for he could think of no other word for it, to watch the great Draco Malfoy, pride of Slytherin and man of ice, when he thought he was alone. It hadn’t been intentional, but after all this time, the moments Harry could see the vulnerability that was shocking to Harry in the beginning, Harry had begun, against his will, to reconsider his idea of Malfoy. Yes, he was undoubtably up to something, but the man didn’t exactly seem...happy about it. If anything, the more the year progressed, Malfoy seemed more and more like a skeleton walking.
Harry sighed, kissing Draco one last time before standing up. A few more hours and he’s be back in this room with his boyfriend. It’ll be fine.
or just like touch in general, or actions or- they’re a good...way for me to communicate how much...what I feel about you. For you. So- and I’m only saying this because, well yesterday you asked whether this was a mistake and I can’t take that. Again.”
“Why did you spill your drink?” Harry asked, making it sound so casual but Ron took a step forward, placing a hand on Harry’s shoulder. Draco looked around, virtually
“Show’s over.” Draco spat to the crowd, whipping his robe dramatically. He had an image to uphold after all. As they walked Draco almost felt physically burnt by the rage steaming off of Harry. Checking no one was around, Draco gently grabbed Harry’s right hand wincing when he saw the brusing.
He looked a bit better than he did at the trial, some color back in his colorless complexation. But the main thing Harry couldn’t take his eyes off of was the scar that ran up the right side of his neck, over his jaw into his cheek. Then another seemed to just break off, running through his eye.
Without having much memory of how he got there, Draco arrived at the top of the astronomy tower, the familiar sights of his panic spot comforting to him. He checked one of the chests and...yes, perfect. The blanket he had stashed away 6
“Don’t presume to know anything about a war you didn’t fight in. Or a man you know nothing about.” Harry spat back which was surprisingly elegant given the rage that currently fueled his body.
This was news to both Harry and Draco. Time flew when you’re having your ankle repaired and almost having sex with your secret boyfriend apparently.
“Crowds aren’t really my thing anymore” Harry admitted, far more honestly than he had originally intended. “You?”
Draco snatched his wrist away from Harry, automatically defensive of the scar riddled mark. The scars on the mark were immediately hidden under a glamor. “I should think it obvious why.”
Draco rolled his eyes, pushing Harry’s head down so he was level with Draco’s obvious erection. “Thank you for asking but Potter, I swear if you don’t fuck me soon I’ll do it myself.” He had almost said he’d reconsider Tommy’s offer but that seemed a bit too far.
“Important yeah.” Hummed Potter in agreement, the warmth starting to flood back into his eyes. He turned, gazing at Draco as he brought his hand up to his mouth, and kissed the pale hand.
. He got up, slowly facing the mirror which reflected back smooth, untouched skin. With a wave of his hand, the scars were back, and Draco delicately ran his finger up them. He had truly failed at being a Malfoy. He just wished he knew if he stilled cared that he did.
“What are you doing after?” Tom questioned casually. But Harry felt his skin crawl. He knew Draco had been with other men before him, and it didn’t bother Harry that would be possessive and ridiculous but now that Draco was
“Get a better grip.” Draco asked Barren, taking the goblet and throwing the rest of the pumpkin juice in Barren’s face. He turned sharply, and strutted out the door, smirking. Ultimately, that may have not been the best move but he’s only human after all.
Harry smirked, rocking up into Draco lightly as he called back, “yeah, thanks, just have a bit of a hangover.” Draco bit harder, using his mental power to
“Uhhh” he began, because which one was worse? Truth he could reveal too much but a dare could do just as much damage, maybe he should-
Draco felt like there were thousands of words pressed against his chest, the points of the letters spiking into his chest. He opened his mouth and closed it, his hands shaking in Potter’s grasp. His control, his resolve, caught just like the breath was caught in his throat.
Draco was so lost in pleasure, of the glorious feeling of Harry’s hands opening him that he had completely forgotten about- Harry stopped, stiff, completely. Draco opened his eyes, looking at Harry who looked wrecked, no longer in the sexual way. His eyes were wide in dry shock, guilt seemed to deepen the lines in his face.
Harry nodded, squeezing Draco’s waist encouragingly. Draco sat up, reaching behind him to grab Harry’s cock. He muttered a protection charm before aligning himself over it. Draco took a deep breath, and slowly began to lower himself onto Harry.
“Bedroom,” Draco reminded Potter one night as he uncorked a bottle after a long lull in conversation.
The one thing that did not change was his status. As Draco crushed, peeled, and stirred, adapting the Propago potion skillfully into something more specified to counteract the effects he knew of Nox, Potter remained in a trance, breath still, limbs limp, not unlike the students and staff who had been petrified by the Basilisk Draco’s second year.
It was a longer stretch of absence than the public was used to, and far longer than Draco believed he could stand — six entire months during which he heard nothing. And then Potter reappeared on the cover of The Prophet, a photo of him glowering against camera flashes as he herded some shackled dark wizard or former Death Eater or other into the temporary Ministry penitentiary where they’d no doubt be herded off to Azkaban. Draco had waited for weeks after that, months, knowing that Potter was alive and okay, but he never reached out again, never so much as replied to Draco’s owls until the day he strolled by the Potions shop two years later, too much a coward to even wear his own face.
He knew he should care in some way, should probably owl Granger or Weasley and tell them their ickle traumatized Hero was still unable to face reality sober for any length of time — with the amount of scales Potter was buying, he could be brewing enough Nox to keep him in a fucked up state virtually around the clock.
“This way,” Granger said, her voice clipped. Draco followed her into her small living room, where someone was huddled on the couch. Unable to slow himself, Draco sped around to see.
Then Harry would be gone without warning for weeks, off on some mission or tour, and return for another few weeks — months, if Draco was lucky — of something fast and fiery and fleeting and which only resembled romance because they occasionally snogged and often shagged.
‘For the fourth time Harry we don’t know maybe he’s just another Hermione and we never noticed, some people are just clever like that you know’ Ron answered growing rather annoyed at the boy and his repeated questioning about their classmate.
‘Well I mean the only other thing I can think of is a vampire but that's not...’ he looked at the boy smirking and saw his teeth growing slightly sharper with each second until they were completely fangs and he jumped slightly, the boys smirk disappeared and he looked rather hurt by his reaction, he slowly moved forward and looked at the fangs smiling, ‘woah, those are so cool, are they fully functional? Like are you a really a vampire? This isn’t a dream?’
As the night moved on the two lay in each other's arms and smirked at one another as the moonlight made their skin glow, as the night moved on Harry began to feel a sharp pain in his gums and moaned in agony at the sudden pain that shot through his body, he felt his gum and winced as he noticed his finger was cut under the sharpness of his canine teeth, he looked at the boy beside him holding the bloodied finger in his direction, the boy smirked licking the blood off of his finger planting a kiss on his lips before the boy pulled away in pain, Draco apologized if he had bit him again promising he hadn't meant to but joking that he could if he wanted him too but Harry wasn’t laughing along at his joke, in fact he looked rather concerned much to Draco’s surprise, had he gone too far with the jokes?
He walked down the corridor as the shadow grew shorter and almost disappeared from his sight, his eyes were heavy from tiredness yet he did not feel sleepy, the bags under his eyes were so dark and deep that they could have held all of the tragedies he had faced in his lifetime and possibly more. Had he imagined that shadow? Was he hallucinating from a lack of sleep? He no longer cared and he dragged his feet across the cool touch of the stone following the path of the long corridor as it led to steps that would lead him to the outdoor grounds of the Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry. He stepped through the ajar wooden door and walked down the steps to the grass. The grass was cool beneath his feet, it tickled him slightly with every movement the tickling sensation increased.
They left the great hall in unison and ignored the stares and whispers that had come with their leaving, they walked through the halls in a V-shaped formation as those around them moved out of their way the only ones bothering to say anything were the Hogwarts ghosts likely because they were dead and the trio could do nothing to them, although there were some ghosts that still kept their distance. They walked through the big wooden doors into the defense against the dark arts classroom all of them sitting at their desks, they appeared to be the last ones to arrive although their professor did not seem to be present in the class, they had cut it very close. Moments later the door opened dramatically and the blinds closed in unison as professor snape walked closer to them stopping in front of the class. The sound of the door opening again caused them all to turn, including Snape, to see the blonde-haired boy Harry had been discussing at the breakfast table.
‘I never sleep well, I haven't since I was very young and with everything with you know who its only gotten worse, last night I just decided to leave my dorm rather than sit there doing nothing like I normally do’ he smirked, ‘yes I came here to find you, don’t get too cocky about it, so why were you out?’
‘Well I don’t know whether to lie or to tell the truth and have you reprimand me’ before she could open her mouth to call him and idiot or whatever she was going to say she added, ‘in my defense it naturally flowed into the conversation we were having at the time and I asked him in a non-accusing way and he laughed about it and we moved on from that subject quite quickly, it wasn’t a big thing or anything like that and he didn’t seem to care... he’s a good kid it’s a shame that so many people whisper and spread rumors about him, he’s nothing like they say he is, nowhere close to that’ his eyes fell slightly, thinking about he was no better than the people he was talking about, he had gotten overexcited and asked him to bite him, he wasn’t going to tell them that of course, they would absolutely flip and it wasn’t really his place to tell anyone, it was Draco’s.
Draco reached a shaky hand out to Potter’s shoulder, rocking him slightly until his eyes slowly opened. He jerked back into the couch when he saw Draco, wiping desperately at his eyes, and Summoned his glasses with a flick of his wrist. Draco rocked uncomfortably on his foot when he realized that Potter was blubbering: low, quiet, but nevertheless unceasing sobs were spilling out of his mouth, and he covered it in an attempt to stop them. Eventually, he sucked a long breath in through his mouth and looked up at Draco pitifully.
“I should have stopped him,” Granger murmured, both of her hands against her mouth, a caricature of fear and concern. Despite himself, her worry lit something dark within Draco — a resentment for the heroes’ unrestrained willingness to call on the villain in times of need, to demand his help without even having the courtesy of admitting who he was helping, loyal as these unrelenting Gryffindors always were to their friend.
Harry wrapped both of his hands around Draco’s, holding him tightly, pleadingly as he locked him with his gaze, and Draco found himself beginning to fall into those pits of silver green.
“Right,” Draco said, and though he wanted to ask, something held him back. “Then what can I do for you, Mr. Potter?”
Draco traipsed around to the front of the couch quietly, and watched as Potter slept. Despite himself, he bent down slightly to see that small tears were welling in the creases of Potter’s eyes. As he watched, one finally brimmed and spilled over his cheek.
It wasn’t until he actually saw the state of Potter’s brewing that it all suddenly began to feel real. Draco eyed the small, messy desk and cauldron Potter had set up in his equally cluttered living room — and he couldn’t help but smirk.
“Quiet yourself,” Draco hummed as he put his case down and took off his coat. “Ears everywhere. We wouldn’t want the entire wizarding community to find out about The Boy Who —”
The next time the yellow haired man appeared there was a gaggle of young witches stirring through the shop, chattering over the Lip Lock potions Draco had brewed just that morning. The man pretended to be transfixed with the display of Frog Knuckles in the window, but Draco knew he was just waiting for the crowds to leave. The moment after Draco checked the witches out, he crossed the room over to the man before he could come to the register.
“And there?” Draco asked as Potter undressed, because he might as well, eyeing the uncomfortable-looking armchair. When Potter gazed blankly at him, Draco continued, “If you’re serious about harm reduction, you’d best be somewhere you can sleep fitlessly.” The truth was, it didn’t actually matter, but he couldn’t stand to see Potter all crumpled up again like he had that night. He tried not to think about all of the nights Potter must have spent curled up in that little armchair, somewhere between dreams and the abyss, too humble and daft to even realize he deserved to sleep in a bloody bed.
Harry sat on his bed and took Draco’s hands in his, pulling him closer. “Draco,” he said quietly. “I’m not leaving you.”
“Right,” Draco murmured, producing three more vials of his Nox from his bag. “I suppose these are for you, then.”
Potter breathes heavily into Draco’s hair, and kisses Draco’s neck just once before pulling out. The bedsheets slacken around Draco’s wrists. Potter rolls onto his back on the bed next to him, staring at the ceiling.
“It’s fine,” Draco said firmly, producing a shrunken bag from his robes’ pocket and pulling out several vials and a small desk with a miniature inbuilt cauldron and cutting board for him to work on. He held his hand out to Granger, who seemed shocked to silence, whether by Draco’s willingness to help or his apparent indifference to the situation. She blinked at it and then dropped the bag of Occamy teeth into his hands as he began to prepare ingredients.
“Quiet,” Draco said, careful to temper his voice with patience. He glanced up at the man, eyes swimming in lifeless circles, as the faintest etchings of a jagged scar began to crease into his forehead. “He’ll be fine as long as I can work in quiet.”
“Thank you,” Potter finally said, leaning against the till as he spoke. “For coming to Hermione’s that night. I could have died.”
“I can’t say I’ve ever had a need for this particular product,” Draco replied flatly, taking the man’s Galleons and adding them to the till.
“Don’t you —” Draco heard himself saying. “It’s just — you’re going to sleep in those?” he asked, looking at Potter in his crumpled robes.
Potter smirked, and then it faded. “You know,” he said, his voice so low it was nearly a whisper. “I did try. I did try with you.”
As if by clockwork, the shop owner brought the scales up that evening while he was taking inventory. “I haven’t seen so much movement in this product in years,” Ragbin said, holding one of the shimmering bags in his hand almost inquisitively.
“Wine? Firewhiskey?” Harry asked as they rounded into the kitchen — he was even hosting now. “I actually know where everything is now,” he said. “Hermione and Ron came round to help me clean.”
And then, as if Draco’s mere presence in the flat set him off, Potter was screaming. Not shouts or cries of battle or strength, but miserable, petrified things, small whimpers interspersed with anguished shrieks and begging. “No,” Potter shouted, his eyes still closed as he squirmed against the couch, still shouting. “No! Not — Please!”
Draco climbs out of his bed and walks over to him. Potter bristles at his mere presence. He hates Draco now, but one day, he’ll be grateful. One day, he’ll understand.
And so he didn’t. The man looked up at him and his face turned into something like a smile, something with a twinge of embarrassment as he checked out with a few potions — a minty breath potion, a hangover cure potion, and an anti-nausea potion, all options that anyone with the faintest skill could make easily and more affordably — and the mermaid scales thrown in as if an afterthought, as if the odd ingredient might go unnoticed amid all of the distraction the others supplied. Draco rang him up, he nodded, and he left.
Potter scowled but finally tipped back the potion. He took his glasses off and ran both hands through his hair, an act of self-soothing so subtle that Draco almost missed it, and pushed back against his pillows. “You know, Draco...” he started, his voice already dreamy. And then his eyes slipped closed, and he was gone.
“How do you like it?” the man blurted out that time, and immediately looked slightly cross with himself, like he hadn’t thought it through.
“I’ll come round,” Draco sighed, displeased to even be hearing the words, let alone saying them. “I’ll come round in a few days to see how you are.” He glanced up at Potter, and knew that his expression must be one of resentment despite his words. “If you’d like.”
Draco fixed him with an expectant look, and Potter started, then began thumbing through stacks of ingredients and papers on the desk until he procured a small black notebook and opened to his recipe. Draco skimmed over it, only tangentially familiar with the potion’s origins and effects. “Did you figure out how to make it yourself?”
“I can just get more of everything,” Potter pointed out stubbornly, following Draco into the shop where Ragbin stood behind the counter, whose eyes immediately turned into dinner plates as he spotted Potter and then, displaying a refreshing amount of restraint, he dipped into the back room.
Without a word, he dropped down to his knees. “What are you —” Harry asked as Draco drew his wand, murmuring a quick Revelatory charm.
The first thing Draco noticed about him when he finally managed to approach the counter was that he looked so much more alive. He looked fuller, like he had put some meat on his bones, the bags under his eyes were gone, and that devilish glint that had been lacking finally returned to them. He looked more like himself than he had in years.
Potter looks up in the chaos, not even bothering to grab his wand as two nearby witches scramble to cast
“Sure you can manage the crowds?” Draco asked, and though he’d meant it as a joke, the thought settled into his bones: Harry was willing not only to brave the public, not only to brave reality, but to do so with a former Death Eater — with Draco by his side.
Potter showed up first as the same blonde haired, dark-eyed man. He just hovered in the corner of the shop for a few minutes, shuffled in and out with a crowd, as if he was dipping his feet in the water, and then vanished.
The flat was even more cluttered than Granger’s, and considering the man currently sat unchallenged as the Most Powerful Wizard In The World, he certainly didn’t seem to bother to employ magic to cook or clean often. There were dishes piled high in the sink, official-looking, stamped and embossed papers crumpled and strewn about, robes tossed over desks and chairs and nearly every surface cluttered with any variety of items, including what appeared to be a stack of several unopened gifts in the corner.
“Will you come?” Potter asked suddenly, and Draco knew immediately that it was simply a favor, nothing more than an odd fraternity, and it made his insides twist. “Will you stay?”
“They’re not for everyone,” Draco said after a moment, nodding. He was aware that what drew him to potions — the precision, the nuance, the lurking
Potter’s face blankens in awe as they look around. The drops of rain have stopped mid-fall, surrounding them with a million beads of water as if time has frozen. Draco looks up at the sky where a burst of lightning hangs in stasis, illuminating the angry purple clouds around it.
“We need Occamy teeth,” Granger squabbled out. Draco blinked at her, and she gave one of those exasperated pleading looks she always shot the other two.
But the truth was, it was getting harder and harder to see Potter when he took the Nox —  the way he’d lie there completely vacant, like his soul was taking a vacation from being housed in his very body. The comparison was even more stark after the modified Nox had returned some vigor to his countenance.
But then Potter runs a finger across his palm, splitting it down its scar without breaking the kiss. Potter will heal it later, if there is anything left to heal. But for now, Draco gives him everything, and Potter will take and take until not a single drop remains.
When he looked back, Potter still had that stupid, sad smile on his face. “I gave the most I could.”
“I was always rubbish at potions,” the man said, staring at the counter. “I find them quite finicky.”
He looked down and Harry let out a small whimper, and instead reached down to undo his own belt. Draco looked down to what his foot had hit, and realized that it was nothing. There was nothing there.
Potter stirred with a start, lancing forward onto his hands and knees, and for the briefest moment, there was something dark in his eye — utter terror, Draco realized. Then he blinked it away and looked up grinningly, and Draco was disarmed just as always. “Funny running into you here,” he said, rubbing his neck.
“Take me,” Draco hisses into his bed. Potter could vanish their clothes with an errant thought, but instead he just shoves Draco’s trousers down around his thighs.
Draco watches the rest of it unfold from Potter’s flat. The DMLE succumbs first, and then the Wizengamot, and then, inevitably, the entire Wizarding world.
Draco wakes in the middle of the night to find him standing in his bedroom. He has no idea how long Potter has been standing there. He seems wired, like he no longer needs to sleep at all.
“And the owner has requested proof of identity for anyone purchasing scales,” Draco lied. “So it may be best to source your ingredients elsewhere.”
Potter takes him by the wrist. There’s still a scar from the first time. Potter doesn’t even touch his wand. Draco hisses as the scar reopens, inky red spilling out into the crevices between his fingers.
The brew in his cauldron bubbled pink, belched a cloud of sparkling green dust, and cooled to a milky blue liquid not unlike the way memories appear in pensieves. Draco measured a dose into a vial, added a cork, and tossed it over to Granger who leapt to catch it desperately, in a clear display of how precious this was to her and how little Draco cared. He began packing his things as Granger and Weasley stared down at him in awe.
Though it was nearly impossible, Draco pulled away, sucking in a deep breath. Harry’s hair was even more of a mess, and it felt impossible not to touch again, impossible not to be on top of him, all over him, touching him desperately and greedily for eternities.
“You have good friends,” Draco said, and it was the truth. He felt a cautious relief crash over him as he glanced around, and realized that he alone was not strong enough to pull Harry from whatever he had been sinking into, but that maybe, alongside Granger and Weasley, he’d at least helped. “Firewhiskey will do.”
Droplets of water from the rain catch on Potter’s glasses, hiding his eyes. Draco presses his thumbnail into his own index finger, a spark of magic letting him push past flesh until a bead of red rises to the surface. Potter’s hand trembles as Draco repeats the action on him.
The man was a petty thief, nothing that warranted such exacting force. Potter shot off a binding spell, and the cords wrapped so tightly into the man’s skin that it cut into his wrists and throat, bleeding him dry before the other Aurors even caught up with him.
“Anything that requires that much mermaid scale would also have quite potent physiological and meta-magical side effects,” Ragbin said, returning the scales to the shelf and continuing his inventory. “Potentially be highly addictive. We may need to rank up our regulations. I don’t need the Ministry breathing down our necks again.” Draco’s mind flitted back to the man earlier, who didn’t seem like the addicted type, nor the potion pusher type. He didn’t seem like any type, in fact; it was impossible to place him.
“He hasn’t moved,” Granger was blubbering, her composure breaking down in an instant. “He hasn’t moved in almost a day. He sleeps so much, he sleeps
kind of path in life or he’d slowly drive himself insane. Of course, it took as much time for the Wizarding World to accept former Death Eaters back into society, and yet longer time for him to find a Potions master willing to take him on, even as an apprentice.
When Potter finally walked up to the till, he opened his mouth and then closed it, and Draco realized that, much like everything else Potter did, he hadn’t thought this through at all.
So it was true; she hadn’t been here before, yet she knew what she was looking for, knew where to find it. She glowered at him, clearly mistaking his confusion for scorn, and he couldn’t blame her, so swirled the two were within him.
“You couldn’t’ve,” Draco said, busying himself aimlessly with his ledger and refusing to make eye contact. “But you will,” he added.
“Draco,” he said, but Draco wasn’t listening. He dropped the box onto the bed and opened it to find over a dozen small vials of deep, midnight purple liquid that glimmered with the disturbance of motion.
The first time they do it is at Neville Longbottom’s housewarming party. Draco gets invited because Neville is dating Luna. Potter gets invited because Potter gets invited to everything.
Hatred burns behind Potter’s eyes. Draco thinks he might storm out, or hex him. He can feel it rolling off of Potter, the power uncoiling within. He’s channeling it into his emotions, into hatred, the way he always has.
Potter gently works his way from under Draco and climbs atop him. He kisses Draco’s hair and temple, slowly unbuttoning his shirt.
Draco began coming round most evenings after work, sometimes delivering potions, other times not. For the most part, when he came by, Potter was a shell, whether because he was using or because he was swimming through the haze of after effects. Often, Draco came by to find him sleeping, and left just as quickly, not eager to discover whether this slumber would crescendo into a screaming fit or not.
Harry leaned back, propping himself up on the bed. “I gave your recipe to Hermione,” he said. “So you wouldn’t have to keep brewing it. I didn’t think you’d mind.”
Harry had leaned across the kitchen island and was kissing him before Draco even realized what was happening. It was gentle at first, then firm like it always was, Harry’s kisses just an extension of himself: heated, unwavering, and fearless. As Draco was just about to let himself reach up and tangle his hands through Harry’s hair, Harry pulled away.
‘Very good Mr. Malfoy’ Snape acknowledged as he read from the defense against the dark arts textbook, ‘it is as Mr. Malfoy has just said, there are a number of telltale signs of a werewolf from the emotional to the physical yet all are equally important in identifying a werewolf, of course there have been regulations on werewolves since the 1637 werewolf code of conduct formed by the wizarding council, before the time of the ministry of course however more recently in our history the ministry has passed the anti-werewolf legislation making it impossible for werewolves to do much in common society’
‘Knowledgeable on this topic, aren’t we?’ snape inquired as he corrected himself, ‘making it extremely difficult for werewolves to do much in common society, does that suit you better Mr. Malfoy?’ with an embarrassed nod Snape continued the lesson but Harry wasn’t listening he was too focused on the boy across from him.
‘Well now I just feel stupid....’ he sighed shaking his head, ‘I really thought I was on to something’
He continued to walk pretending he had not heard the crackling of the leaves under the feet of those who had been following him. He walked further into the night turning at the whomping willow tree and disappearing from the view of anyone who might have been following. He could hear their footsteps come to a stop and felt their hesitation in the air, they were most likely looking to see where the boy had gone. As he peered from the side of the whomping willow he saw no one standing there before he could even wonder where they had gone, he felt the knock of someone crashing into him as the two were knocked onto the grass and tangled in each other.
Harry was making quick work of his robes, yanking free from them to reveal yet another of those one of those muggle shirts again, with a strange, colorful logo sprawled across it. He reached over and yanked at Draco’s robes, who stepped closer to let Harry’s nimble fingers work, and tripped against something jutting out from under the bed.
The pallid, scattered energy of the flat Draco had visited only a few weeks ago had entirely transformed.
Draco could not afford to be surprised by the state of Potter’s flat; he was too busy being surprised by the fact that Potter had a flat to begin with. Before Potter vanished, he had been rotating through the apartments of Granger and Weasley, and then eventually Draco’s as well. At the time, Draco had assumed it was Potter’s reluctance to be tied down that kept him so scattered, but now he wondered whether it was more about Potter’s reluctance to be alone.
“Draco,” he called, and Draco stopped, his hand on the door, giving Potter one last chance to say something — anything — that mattered, that could convince him this wasn’t a complete waste of his time.
of eliciting catastrophic results by taking one microscopic misstep — was precisely what many found to be so off putting.
“I can’t imagine that would be very good for your business,” Draco added, not meaning for it to sound so much like a threat as it did.
Draco blinked, unsure if Potter was being purposefully daft, or if he really thought that who was brewing his narcotic potions was why he was upset. He turned one of the vials over in his hand, and then replaced it before swiftly turning and leaving the room.
And then the man burst out laughing, a deep, hearty sound that came from somewhere low in his belly. For someone who seemed so reticent of attention, being the loudest thing in the room didn’t seem to bother him; Draco could even hear Ragbin stir in his office at the disturbance.
He placed the potions on the till silently, the faintest of smiles playing at his lips. Draco added everything to the till wordlessly, and for a moment he thought that maybe neither of them would speak, that maybe this was all a fat lot of nothing, unrelated coincidences that had nothing to do with Granger, or —
Sometimes when he came by, Weasley or Granger were there — more than once he’d Floo’d into Potter’s den while they were in the middle of conversation, Granger casting a gaze at him over her shoulder that could petrify Salazar himself as Draco deposited the Nox and left. One time, he walked in on Potter and Weasley sat on the floor of Potter’s kitchen, snickering mysteriously until Draco realized they were in the middle of a game of Exploding Snaps.
“Not that it’s my business,” he said, making a show of restocking vials and Quick-Cut Blades to the shelves and speaking out of the corner of his mouth. “But if I were you, I’d at least diversify a bit.”
Potter shook his head immediately. “Course not,” he said. “I was always rubbish at potions.” He paused as Draco recalled his yellow-haired alter ego. “Actually filched it from the Ministry,” he continued nonchalantly as Draco pulled a stool up to the desk and began to pen through the recipe. “They were running a case to get it off the streets, and—”
— from his eye while Draco tried to decipher what in Merlin’s name was so funny. “Thank you,” he said, putting his hand into Draco’s, which confused him until he realized he was holding a fistful of coins, the scales in another. “I’ll take that under advisement.”
Draco latches his mouth onto his neck, flicking his tongue against Potter’s trembling skin. The next thing he knows, he’s being thrown against the room by an invisible burst of force.
“I don’t want someone else,” Potter says. He strokes Draco’s hair, a spark of magic running down his scalp. “I want you.”
and then reappearing in his life through disguise, voyeuristically, with no intentions of actually reconnecting with Draco. As if anything could justify it.
The moment he saw her slip through the door to the shop, Draco pondered what he considered each time this happened: packing up his things and moving to Scotland, or Morocco, or God, even America. Anywhere that he didn’t have to do this — to see the people he had been guided into attempting to destroy, to have it all wash back against him and then to have to chat with them and act like it never happened, though it was never quite like that with Granger.
Potter’s fingers had closed around the vial, and they shook slightly as he gazed down at it. Draco began gathering his things, already knowing the answer would be no.
Draco knew that Potter wasn’t dead by the next morning. If that potion were to kill him, it would be immediate, and there would be no way Granger and Weasley could hold it together enough to keep that under wraps for more than a few hours. If Potter had died, he’d have seen it splayed out across The Prophet  — or he’d simply awaken to the sounds of people wailing and mourning and gnashing their teeth in the streets across the entire Wizarding community.
“See you tonight,” Harry said, and drew the eager attention of the crowd with him when he turned to leave.
“Draco,” Potter started, and something caught in Draco’s throat with that, the combination of the use of his first name, the look in Potter’s eye, the discomfort of seeing this side of someone he had only seen in headlines and photoshoots for the past two years, so vulnerable, so afraid.
Draco doesn’t wait for Potter to figure out what’s going on, to resist. He grasps Potter’s hand in his, connecting their wounds. A stream of red winds down his wrist, a font of blood intermingled.
Draco excused himself to Ragbin and followed Granger and Weasley outside of the shop, where Granger looped her arm through his and Side-Alonged them into an apartment —
“I should have stopped him. But I couldn’t —” she glanced at Weasley as if for confirmation. “He said he was going to stop. I—”
When they went back to Harry’s after dinner, Draco was stunned to silence to see that the flat was clean. Though he used that term rather loosely, all of the paths were navigable, every surface cleared, knick knacks and gifts relegated into their proper places, papers filed away somewhere out of sight. He’d even charmed an iron to make quick work of some of his robes.
The potion turned from its inky shade of black to a cool shade of dark purple as Draco added his ingredients - a few revitalizing additions and some that would absorb the darker effects of the potion were all he could really offer. Nothing he could do would make it entirely safe if Potter still wanted it to work.
Potter kisses like someone who helps old ladies cross the street, but he fucks like the man who killed the Dark Lord. He pins Draco against the counter and takes him from behind, kissing his neck like they’re in love. Draco watches it all in the mirror: his own face flushed and clammy, his hair disheveled.
“I know that,” Harry said and flopped back onto the bed. And despite himself, Draco felt pity brewing within him. Imagine — pitying Harry Potter, the man who could have everything he wanted — including Draco, if he really wanted him — and chose to live alone in a dump of a flat and spend his days in various states of inebriation and watch as the world spun on without him. And yet, for the first time, Draco considered that maybe this really was Harry’s best.
Potter stood and Draco followed him to his bedroom, where Potter paused in his bed frame. “Just a moment,” he mumbled, and Draco watched as he blocked the door for a few moments, gesturing lazy, wandless spells with a casualness that made Draco’s blood boil for some reason. When they finally pressed inside, the room was still in a similar state of disaster as the rest of the home, and Draco tried not to wonder what had needed moving or hiding.
“I suppose so,” Potter breathed, and Draco soured as he realized the hurt in his voice didn’t bring any amount of pride or satisfaction; it just felt rotten.
“Malfoy,” Weasley said by way of some odd greeting. He seemed out of breath. Of the two, Weasley had inexplicably been more warm toward Draco on the odd times they crossed paths, perhaps simply because he was better at compartmentalizing. “Can you —” he stammered, his face growing as red as his hair. “Are you —”
reports the events matter-of-factly the next day, without any of their usual sensationalism. They don’t want to cross him. They’re afraid.
“I didn’t know you — worked here,” Granger said slowly, and Draco felt himself flush. Granger had never forgiven him, would never; most wouldn’t, but she also wouldn’t pretend that she had like so many others did. She was probably judging the shop, he thought as he watched her glance around and take it all in, wondering what kind of an establishment would hire a filthy former Death Eater. Draco was rolling another half-insulting inquiry on his tongue when she spoke again, quietly, so close to him.
Potter sank into the small armchair that sat by the desk, and for a moment, Draco thought that he might fall asleep again.
Potter stopped coming by after that, and Draco figured it was only as to be expected. There was nothing Potter was better at than disappearing — his ability to remain a shrouded figure after the war had always been nothing short of impressive, considering often even the most advanced Wizards were incapable of locating him. His public appearances were always inconsistent at best, and he often didn’t even attend events that were thrown in his honor — though how could he, considering how many there were?
Draco turned to look at him, and Harry sat up slowly in the bed before kissing Draco gently, so gently, and running a hand through his hair until it rested at the back of his neck. The gesture was so chaste and yet more intimate than anything else Draco could think of, and fire brimmed in his chest although he remained dizzy with the feeling of Harry’s lips against his, something that never failed to ignite him.
Draco climbs atop him. He presses his teeth into his bottom lip until blood springs anew and then presses kisses to Potter’s neck, leaving a trail of red splotches.
Things were difficult, of course, but simple in the years after the war before he’d reconnected with Harry. And then they crossed paths at a pub in Diagon Alley where Draco and his friends happened to be on a rare night the one and only Golden Trio made a public appearance.
“It keeps happening,” Potter says between hitched breaths as he zips up his fly. “Why does it keep happening? I thought we had to —” he hesitates, watching Draco dust off his robes. It’s like he doesn’t want to say it.
Within seconds, there was a gaggle of witches and wizards who wanted a piece of him — some even literally, judging by the way that they pulled at his arm, yanked at his robes, even twisted their fingers around a lock of his hair.
Potter was there when the shop opened the next day. He looked healthier, pinker behind the cheeks, but nonetheless tired, and this time with an added layer of irritation.
Draco has been sleeping for nearly fifteen hours a day. He’s been battling pounding migraines and endless, churning nausea. He can hardly cast first year charms. He’s been washing his dishes by hand.
“What would they think?” he murmured, mostly to himself. “The Wizarding World’s most cherished hero, holed up in some flat and brewing himself into a state of permanent stupor.” He knew he was being cruel, but he found himself uncaring as he picked up an ink-black vial of Potter’s personally blended Nox, and then set it down to pick up a bottle of Polyjuice. “Or hiding from the public on the rare occasion he remains sober.”
And it had been so easy, so painfully easy to just pick up where they had left off. It already felt like they had, and that maybe the only thing standing between them was Draco’s inability to swallow a grudge.
Most people’s lives began to open up, to improve or at least drastically change once they were finished with school. This wasn’t the case for Draco, for his friends, for anyone who had seen what they saw as children. Because what could life possibly have in store for him that was more unforgettable than a
“It’s too much,” Potter says. He pulls at the collar of his shirt, like something inside of him is trying to get out, like he’s burning from the inside. For just a moment, the vulnerability returns, his grimace like that of a confused child.
The man didn’t come the next day, or the next day, or the next. He didn’t come the entirety of the next week. But someone else did: Granger.
“You’re going to die,” Potter tells him one night. He takes off his cloak and hangs it on the wall. It isn’t mournful; it’s nothing more than an observation.
“You can control it,” Draco says. “You can do anything with it.” He lifts his upturned hand. “Anything you want.”
Despite himself, despite his every instinct not to care, Draco did. So, once he felt comfortable that Potter was thoroughly out of it, he went into the living room, shrunk down all of the vials, beakers, cauldrons, and ingredients in Potter’s potions stock into a bag, and apparated out of the flat.
The yellow haired man was sprawled across the couch, his robes halfway opened and revealing a muggle T-shirt, like he’d been in the middle of getting dressed when he collapsed. His head was pressed into the armrest in an awkward position, and it would almost appear that he was asleep, were it not for the fact that his eyes were wide open, glassy and motionless, transfixed by the ceiling. His expression was blank, if not a little loopy.
“No,” the man replied immediately and smiled down at the scales Draco had placed in front of him. “No. Thanks,” he said, and he left.
“So,” Potter said as he sat on one side of his bed, leaving a conspicuous amount of space to his right. He grinned stupidly up at Draco, for once showing the fire that he seemed so much to be lacking lately. “Are you just going to watch then?”
Harry nodded, turning to his cabinet. Stubble was burgeoning at his cheeks, his hair messy as always, but in the lively, defiant way Draco liked. He looked humble. He looked himself. He worked quickly, putting their coats up and setting down glasses and only occasionally grabbing his wand to perform a spell, which bothered Draco a lot less than it had a few weeks ago, because he knew Harry wasn’t showing off; it was just the way he was.
“Or are you high right now?” Draco asked, his voice thick with a sneer. “Are you going to splinch us?” Potter glanced at him, rolling his eyes with a spark of fiery personality Draco hadn’t realized he’d been trying to elicit from him.
Potter nodded casually, yawning as he turned to the bedroom. As Draco followed, he tossed him another of his muggle t-shirts and some linen-y bottoms to sleep in, and then changed himself, first his bottoms and then his t-shirt, yanking it over his head before replacing it with a shirt that looked softer if not equally nondescript. And then he climbed into bed, leaving ample room for Draco again, and the absolute unchallenged intimacy of it made Draco stew.
“A Ministry list?” the man said, the corner of his lip pulling up like he had heard something very funny.
He’d learned that wasn’t something he could take for granted, seeing Potter again. He’d taken it for granted once, but he knew better now.
