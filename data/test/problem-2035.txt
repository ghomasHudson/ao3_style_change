"What?"
“Thank you. Is it alright if we leave it like that?”
“Shut up, Malfoy. Why are you out past curfew?”
Harry flinches because – because no, that isn’t why he is there, but of course, that’s what Malfoy would assume. It’s been hours since he stood in Ginny’s sunlit room and they joked about the lack of dating opportunities on a horcrux hunt, but he can still recall the feeling of her hand on his neck, the press of her soft lips, the flowery smell of her that was everywhere in the room.
“Why didn’t you come? Why didn’t you write me back? I mean, it’s not like my life revolves around you coming to my parties, but I don’t like to be stood up and I don’t like to be ignored, so you better have a pretty good excuse for being such a prick.”
“I probably should. Goodbye again, professor.”
He turned to look at her and didn’t hear the rest of Ginny’s sentence.
“Look, you can’t tell Ron or Hermione or anyone else about this, okay?”
“No, I really don’t see how it could work in the pit,” said Granger, continuing some argument the others hadn’t been part of. “Choking the dementors should work, but if the pit is some sort of source, as we have considered it so far, then starving it doesn’t make sense.”
“I am not!”
“You’re the one who insisted we don’t tell the others,” he said.
Harry shrugged.
“I might not have an invisibility cloak, but my disillusionment is perfectly good.”
,” he whispered.
“Yes.”
“Oh, you would? Is that your plan this year? Keeping your head down and hoping they forgive you?”
Harry wasn’t sure how he looked.
“No, I doubt she’d talk to me if she ‘d already convinced Potter to stay away.”
Ron looked confused.
“What?”
Of course the only Ravenclaw in on the mission ought to have been part of their endless library search, but she had kept her distance. He had thought that their group was only divided into heroes and Slytherins, but that might be wrong. Maybe he had noticed that Ginny Weasley, Lovegood and Longbottom had become a trio in their own right last year, the obvious challengers of the Carrows, but he supposed he had only thought of them as stand-ins for Granger, Potter and Ronald, had never considered them to be anything in their own right. Yet here they were, still a trio, more reliant on each other than on Potter, close in a way that the golden trio wasn’t anymore. And he hadn’t noticed because even though Potter’s friends had seemed unlikely choices for heroic companions, those three were even less likely heroes. It wasn’t just Draco who had been underestimating them, overlooking them, dismissing them: Potter, Granger and Weasley had been doing the same thing.
," he said and across the map, hundreds of little, red dots lit up.
“You called us Death Eaters. Neither my family nor I supported Voldemort at any point.”
“Yes, mother wasn’t really fit for going out.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
“I’ll see you around?” he said.
would have gotten them somewhere, would probably have resulted in a duel, and possibly Harry would have been able to get a punch or two in there as well.
“Well,” she said. “That was…”
“And then you became insomnia-buddies?” he asked. “Just like that?”
At first, he'd moved in with Pansy at Parkinson Park. Of course, that hadn't been a permanent solution, but she'd been glad to have him, and talking to her had been a bit easier than talking to his mother. And at some point during that time, the idea had taken shape. The perfect solution.
“How was your summer?” he asked.
"Smoking," he huffed. "You're leaving?"
!” he cried.
“I said: Who the hell talks like that this early in the morning?”
There was something peculiar in Potter’s expression, as if he was searching for something in Draco’s face and the search had distracted him from slipping into his usual mask of obvious revulsion. Draco felt a well-known irritation stirring.
Harry teaches Dumbledore’s Army and Draco joins the inquisitorial squad. It probably should have ended then but it doesn’t. Draco wears the shiny silver
Harry leaned back in his chair, eyeing Malfoy.
They all ate dinner together, but afterwards the party split into factions. George, who was more like his old self than he had been for the rest of the holidays, left the party with Lee Jordan, Alicia Spinnet and Katie Bell to go to clubs in muggle London. They carried suspiciously large bags that Ginny said were filled with fireworks from the joke shop. The adults stayed in the downstairs rooms of the burrow, and Harry and his friends retreated upstairs.
Draco’s heart was pounding.
Draco looked away. Well then.
“Of course,” she said.
“Look, I’m sorry.”
Malfoy switched on an electrical kettle in the little kitchen. He opened a cupboard over the sink, taking out a teapot and two delicately painted china tea cups.
"And he was a git about it?" Ron guessed.
“I might have,” said Blaise slowly. “But I think we should make last year an exception, don’t you? I mean,
“Right. It has.”
He couldn’t even remember when he had stopped tolerating Draco or defending him out of some principle, and had actually started to like him. It had happened so slowly he had hardly noticed.
“Sorry,” Draco said. “Nott is a light sleeper, so I had to wait.”
Something clicked into place and Harry knew that Malfoy had said too much. The meeting made sense; the small talk and the firewhisky made sense.
He stood frozen and watched as Weasley ran for his sister, followed seconds later by Longbottom, Lovegood and Harry. The dark shape of her body disappeared from Draco’s view when they crowded around her. He watched as Granger yanked her wand from Pansy’s limp hand and went to join them. Pansy was still breathing heavily, her mouth half open, her face red and splotchy, strands of black hair clung to her cheeks.
"I wasn't that good."
“We know about the security too,” said Malfoy. “The island itself is unplottable, but there is a house for the guards on the coast, and it’s possible to apparate there. When I went, there were only six aurors stationed at the prison, four at the tower and two at the house. The tower is hidden by some sort of disillusionment, so it’s invisible until you get close. And the dementor’s pit is at the bottom.”
Draco rolled his eyes.
“’Morning,” she said, reaching for the tea.
Then he turned and walked away down the hall.
“Well, this is also the only place where we can buy firewhisky. He doesn’t care that we’re in school,” said Malfoy, gesturing towards Aberforth, who was in the middle of pouring a greenish liquid into the glasses of two figures at the bar wearing identical, broad rimmed hats with black veils hanging down from them.
She rolled her eyes at him.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
"How do you know I don't? I have colleagues, and… oh, fuck it," Malfoy cut himself off, the nonchalance of his tone falling away. "I'm allowed to do magic, but it's being monitored, so I've been trying to minimize it. The Ministry likes to use the statute of secrecy as an excuse to harass me."
“There isn’t much else for us to do,” said Ginny. “Turns out there really isn’t much other security apart from the walls and the sea and the dementors. We’ve pored over those newspaper article, and they only mentioned upping the security once after Sirius escaped, but it doesn’t seem like anyone ever pursued the idea. We’re pretty much ready to go.”
Draco sneered.
Irie smirked.
"Why aren't you using magic, then?" he asked.
Malfoy stopped talking and lowered the glass, which he had just raised to his lips.
Draco nodded curtly at him. Pansy had her lips pressed together in a hard line and was staring past the boy at the other Weasley standing right behind him.
Harry glanced out the window. It had started drizzling. The headlights of a car cut through the darkness outside.
“I am not Albus Dumbledore,” she said. “I deal with children, not politics.”
“Shit. Okay, well… wow.”
"Did Mal- did Draco leave?"
“If you’re up for it…”
Harry took a deep breath.
He was in his crumpled school robes, hair sticking all over the place as usual, a wry smile playing around his lips and Draco’s heart made a strange jerk at the sight of him. He felt suddenly self conscious in his stiff robes with all their silver clasps and polished jet bead fastenings. It wasn’t as if Harry didn’t know where he was going, but Draco had so far avoided telling him much about it.
“Come on,” he said.
“If everything is settled, then I suggest we get back to the castle. Do you want to leave first?”
“What was that?” Draco asked.
She didn’t wait for an answer, but walked quickly to the steps to the girl’s dormitories and disappeared upstairs without looking back at him. Harry didn’t move. He sat motionless in his chair and stared into the embers, as the guilt he had been supressing the whole day came back ten times stronger. He shouldn’t have defended Malfoy. He didn’t even want to defend him; Hermione was probably right about him. But that was exactly why she wasn’t supposed to have found out. It should have been secret until Harry had had time to figure it out on his own.
Harry wondered why Draco thought Irie would have been in Slytherin. Everything about the way she was looking at him right then screamed of Gryffindor. Harry shook his head quickly.
"Sorry," he said.
Lovegood nodded.
“So that’s your worst fear?” he spat. “A dementor?”
“Thank you,” he says, putting down his suitcase at the end of the bed. “This is… thank you.”
“I’m very sorry about this, Granger,” he said. “Potter. Weasley. You are very welcome at our table.”
“I’m not going to stay here for your bullshit. And the deal is off.”
Dean stood by Seamus’ bed with his pillow under his arm and Ron was pointing accusingly at him.
"Potter," Draco said. "I'm gay."
“You’re being an idiot.”
“We need to talk,” said Malfoy.
Harry shrugged.
“I need you to help me destroy it.”
Harry didn't say anything.
“Welcome to the club. Now, may I return to my bed or do you wish to continue the interrogation?”
“It’s not a guilt trip,” he said.
“You don’t look very hung over to me,” said Ron.
That much was true, he thought. It wasn’t the whole truth either, but he wasn’t sure about the rest. He reached for Malfoy’s hand, but it jerked away as soon as his fingers brushed his knuckles.
“Your sleeves,” he said, gesturing to Draco as he repeated the words with less certainty this time, as if he had just realized that Draco might be showing off the mark on purpose.
Potter was staring at him.
“Easy enough,” said Ginny. “The changing rooms weren’t locked, only the broom shed. Got it open with an
“Do you ever feel like he’s still inside your head?” Harry asked.
“What now, Potter?” he said quietly.
Her eyebrows shot up and suddenly she looked nervous.
Potter hesitated.
“What?”
“Yes,” she said and he stood up. “But you can come back here whenever you want to, if you ever want to talk to me again. I still think you might benefit from the therapy. Please tell me if you change your mind about it. And if you have trouble sleeping, you can always go see Madam Pomfrey.”
He reached out towards the bars of the cell door, but then stopped, glancing down at the thread of silver that ran across them. Harry was close enough now that he could have reached out to pull him back, but he didn’t. Instead, he looked into the cell. Through the shimmer of light, he could make out the figure of a man huddled under a blanket, his face peeking out but half obscured by shadows. His cheeks were sunken and his skin ashen, and Harry hardly recognized him without his long, silky hair. Of course Harry had known Lucius would be there somewhere in Azkaban, Draco had told them. But he hadn’t spared it a single thought that they might find him. They had to have passed him on the way down too and he hadn’t even noticed.
from that morning, reading the headlines and skimming the articles. He was half listening to Daphne, Tracey and Millicent’s conversation. The returned seventh years had claimed this corner of the common room as their own, and it wasn’t long before Pansy joined them as well. The conversation broke of when Blaise showed up.
“I was at your trial,” said Potter.
“Shit,” he said. “This is ridiculous! Why did I ever think we could pull this off? How come it’s a dementor? I don’t see why you’re afraid of them if you’ve been able to cast a patronus since you were
He brings the plates down again himself, at night because he’s never actually washed dishes before and doesn’t want anyone to laugh at him if he’s doing it wrong. And one night, when he’s on his way back to his room, he hears low voices speaking urgently from the living room. He hesitates for a moment, then sneaks a little closer to the door. A floorboard creaks under his weight and he freezes.
It wasn’t all dark and dangerous magic, some of the books were just incredibly rare or incredibly old and most of them incredibly valuable, so it made sense to keep them off the shelves that were accessible to 11-year-olds. It could take forever to find what you were looking for in there, but Draco had become well-acquainted with the section during his sixth year. It felt like he had lived there some weeks, scouring the shelves for some dark or forgotten magic that might have enabled him to assassinate the headmaster. He hadn’t had much success – not that there was a shortage of the dark or the obscure, but most of it had been far out of reach of his magical abilities. It had been quite unsettling too.
"Didn't you just go?" she asked, but Harry was already standing up.
“Lovely.”
do you have so much family?”
Harry grinned and swung a leg over his Firebolt. They kicked off and rose high into the air, two arrows shooting straight up towards the clouds. Simultaneously they broke their ascend and curved, racing each other to the treeline.
She reached for the tea and poured herself a cup.
“I know!” Harry said. “He was such a prick. He still is, but he’s also not. I think maybe he just took a really long time to grow up.”
“Probably,” he said.
“What happened? Is it true you attacked a Hufflepuff?”
“What, and wizards
Draco let go of his arm and Potter made it about two wobbly steps before he tripped over the curb and Draco grabbed him again.
He thought she would have left.
“Oh, right.”
"Apparently. Hold on, I’ll let you see for yourself."
sort of magic that I couldn’t do twice as well?” he continued as he tucked his wand away in a pocket
as one of his most trusted confidants, the one who loved his family more than anything, who loved
Draco got to his feet, wiping mud from his face. Seamus Finnigan was laughing hysterically next to Ernie Macmillan, who had his wand out. Several other Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors and a few stray Ravenclaws had stopped to watch as well.
“You did plenty of times last year.”
It takes him a moment before he notices Malfoy is crying.
“The duel wasn’t over. I could still fight, so she shouldn’t have assumed it was - and you should probably make a note of that before you try to use
The way his patronus had just flickered out worried him. It suddenly seemed like a feeble protection from whatever was down here. He finally understood what Draco had meant about the building itself being evil – it was like it resonated the powers of the dementors. There hadn’t been any dementors near when he went into the hallway, but when his patronus vanished, he had heard his mom screaming. He thought he would probably have passed out too if Draco hadn’t collapsed first and snapped him out of his hallucinations.
“Is that what you tell yourself?”
“I just want to fly a bit longer,” he told Ron. “I’ll be up in an hour or so.”
“Present”, he said.
“No, I want you to keep standing there awkwardly for the rest of eternity.”
“He has figured it out.”
horses.”
”Because it’s not like we’re better or more moral people than everyone else in the wizarding world.”
In Gryffindor, Harry had returned to the common room to find that his friends regrouped by the fireplace and waiting for him.
Harry, Draco and Hermione all looked up.
“Oh god,” he said.
“Everything alright?” asked Longbottom.
“The one who managed to keep going after the first war, who rebuilt his entire reputation and ended up standing beside the Minister for Magic for
He stood for a moment out in the hallway, gathering himself and watching the door fade away into the stones. He had no idea why he had just had this conversation. Or what exactly it was he had been trying to tell Granger. One thing did seem pretty clear though. They were never going to figure out what to do about the pit no matter how much time they spent on research. He would have to tell Harry that they had found a way to kill the dementors. They didn’t have any more excuses to wait. And it would probably turn out to be exactly as Granger predicted: they would go and try to do the impossible, probably find themselves underprepared for it, and then wait for chaos to break loose around them. It was nice to know that at least some of them had tried that before, because personally, he was terrified.
“No they won’t. I’ll go talk to her. She’s not going to tell.”
He felt pretty certain that there were no books about the prison of Azkaban. He couldn’t tell the others of course, but he had actually tried to look dementors up once before – back in his third year when Potter was going around fainting all over the place and it had seemed such a golden opportunity for messing with him. It was more than a little embarrassing to remember how important that had been to him and if anyone ever decided to bring it up, he would deny everything.
Seamus was still laughing too hard to answer.
“Hello?” he said. “Are you there? Did something happen?”
They have to talk to someone about that, right?”
She let her hand fall and was rested her arms on her knees. She was looking past him again, at the windows behind him instead of at him.
Draco shook his head.
“Must have been really desperate to see me, then.”
“I’m exactly like him.”
She stood up.
“We could try.”
"Despite what you were raised to believe, Draco, the world does not actually revolve around you," he said. "No one is going to give a griphon's ass if they see you being pathetic in a pub."
“Come on, Draco, focus!” he said, but Draco didn’t seem to hear him.
“Blimey, Hermione’s right about you.”
“You are such an arsehole, Potter,” he hissed.
“He was a
“Draco, is that you?” sang Pansy’s sharp, all too energetic voice.
He wondered if it was time he just gave up on this whole thing and went home.
“Are you serious?” asked Ron.
“Honestly, Draco, don’t count on it.”
“That’s Rabastan Lestrange. The one who…”
“Oh great, now he’s throwing up,” said a faraway voice. “Do we have more chocolate?”
Narcissa knocked on the front door when they reached it. Draco looked grimly out at the sea. The door opened and they both looked up at the man in front of them. He was tall and seemed as colourless as the landscape around him. It was impossible to guess his age. His face was weather-beaten and he wore muggle clothing – if it hadn’t been for the wand in his hand, he could just as well have been a local fisherman. Draco knew the aurors were only stationed at Azkaban for short periods of time, but this man looked like he had lived by this coast his whole life.
“It was never about my reputation.”
He never planned on talking to him about it. He had contented himself with knowing this was just something he would have to live with – the awareness that he had been that close to killing someone.  So it’s just a coincidence when they run into each other and happen to be in an empty corridor. If they had just kept walking, they could even have made it past that interaction, which Harry realizes only the second after he has stopped and they stand there, staring at each other. Malfoy has dark circles under his eyes, his lips are pressed into a hard, thin line. He isn’t going to say anything, he just watches Harry, while Harry struggles find a single word in the English language that’s less useless than “sorry.”
Draco sighed.
The airspace above the Forbidden Forest was just as off-limits to students as the forest itself and flying over it was not allowed. But it was beautiful from above and there was a certain appeal to the thought that his flight over the dark treetops included some element of danger. He dropped and swooped low over the trees. The forest stretched for miles in every direction and though the leaves were yellowing, they still clung to the branches, and the foliage hid almost everything below. However, once or twice he caught a glimpse of movement in a clearing or eyes glinting in the trees and a jolt of adrenaline went through him. Far away he saw a thestral gliding in circles against the quickly darkening sky and then head of towards the mountains. Harry changed direction and followed it.
“Where’s the ferret?” he asked.
She shrugged.
“Hello, Malfoy,” Weasley said.
She nodded.
“Okay, I know you don’t want to talk about this with me, I know how you feel about me-“
Golden sunlight poured through the windows of the transfiguration classroom. It was still only early February and outside the wind was sharp and biting cold, but the soft sunlight made it feel like spring was coming closer and the castle seemed warmer and friendlier than it had in months.
“So Monday, then?”
Draco glared at her.
"Hope you're happy," he said.
"We're leaving," Draco said, pulling away from Pansy.
, and yet all the furniture in there looked ancient. There were ornate carvings on the bed, the upholstery of the couch looked like velvet or something like that, and Harry was pretty sure the silver handles on the dresser were shaped like tiny snakes. But then right next to that sort of antique grandeur there was the kitchen which was plain and IKEA-like and muggle, and the curtains were an odd mustard yellow with an ugly tartan pattern and a couple of stains that were clearly visible even from across the room. He didn't know what he had expected. It wasn't like he had spent much time imagining what Malfoy's flat would look like, but he really hadn't thought it could be anything other than immaculate, pristine and polished. He should probably have stopped thinking he knew what to expect from Malfoy after the pub. Or at least after the jeans.
“I talked to Malfoy after you left,” said Harry. “And it didn’t sound like he’d told Parkinson what we’d be meeting about or who were coming or anything, so I suppose she wasn’t prepared for it. I think Malfoy really wants to cooperate, so he’ll probably tell her to… you know, he’ll probably talk to her if we ask him to.”
"Doesn't look like it was fine," he said in that disarming, unimpressed way of his, and Harry's anger deflated a little.
“Harry, stop freaking out!”
“We’ll talk about the rest later.”
in there, Ron. Get your mind out of the gutter.”
here. I just thought you might prefer not to be seen with me."
“Alright, we’ll save you a seat.”
, and yet people seem to be confused as to which pure families proved themselves to be true and which ones were the Voldemort-supporters.”
Harry had always wondered at how different the process of moving into Hogwarts at the beginning of a school year was from moving everyone out at the end of one. There was a certain order and ceremony to returning to Hogwarts after the holidays, as everyone slipped into the order of years and houses, prefects and professors, but when summer approached, each day of good weather seemed like a reminder that school rules would soon be suspended, that they were approaching two months of freedom and no homework. There was a very persistent, school wide agreement among the students that you couldn’t get detentions when the O.W.L’s and N.E.W.T’s were over – Harry had never heard any of the teachers confirm it, but that didn’t seem to matter. As soon as the fifth and seventh years had sat their exams, respect for school rules was replaced by a rapidly spreading restlessness, a giddy longing for summer, which peaked in the last week of school in the form of late night common room parties, skipping classes for impromptu quidditch matches and a broad variety of Weasley-inspired shenanigans. The professors still detracted house points, but otherwise didn’t do much to rein it in. The end of school chaos had long ago become a tradition that no one bothered trying to contain.
“Look, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “Can we talk about something else? I have to spend the whole evening in detention with the idiot, so I think I have been punished enough.”
"Ignore them," she hissed.
Harry was alone in the darkened living room at Grimmauld Place. Ron and Hermione had both gone to bed a while ago. Harry had considered doing the same. He had had a glass of firewhisky and then another one and he should probably have gone to his room and at least tried to go to sleep, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to, so he had stayed where he was, in the soft armchair in the living room, listening to the nighttime noises of the old house.
“Hey,” he said. “I’ve been waiting, I was starting to worry I might have missed you. I wanted to see you off.”
He shrugged.
“No of course not,” she said, rolling her eyes. “I wasn’t talking about the press.”
He looked at her, surprised.
“Look," he began irritably, then cut himself off. He took a deep breath. "It’s… I don’t know what to tell you, Malfoy," he said. "It’s fine. It was a long time ago.”
He didn’t want to have this conversation with her.
Ron groaned in agony.
“They aren’t like anything we’ve covered in class,” she said. “But I think they might be variations of protection-runes. And this one,“ she tapped
Draco picked up Potter’s hand that lay curled loosely against his chest, and threaded their fingers together.
"I just… fuck. Why were you even there?"
Harry waved a hand irritably.
“Of course I’m still a Cannons fan, I’m just saying-“
“What?” he coughed.
“Yeah, right,” said Ginny, turning back to her own table as Slughorn began explaining the theory behind brewing the advanced antidote to the curses they had read about in their homework.
She said it heavily, with certainty, and there was something dark in her expression.
“Draco?” she said, straightening up. “Hi, wow, you’re late.”
“You can side-along two at a time?”
“Oh hush, I’m just naturally charming – isn’t it better than Pansy being a bitch to you? You never tell
It took a second before Draco understood what he meant by that.
"You're sure your name is Harry," Irie asked with a grin. "You're not secretly called some posh name like… I don't know, Harrington or something?"
, before he was shoved back, hard enough that he lost his balance and tumbled over.
“The Hog’s Head?” suggested Padma. “For the nostalgia, you know. And the beer is cheap.”
“I thought about it, but from what Luna said I suppose that had to do with exorcising a dementor. I think it’s too dangerous to try… besides, she said it didn’t work.”
Draco put his bag down on the floor and then curled up in one of the arm chairs. He had brought his textbooks with him, thinking he would want to be distracted, but he couldn’t bring himself to open any of them. He remembered how he had decided, after his first visit to Azkaban, that he already considered his father to be dead. It was odd how big the difference was between considering someone to be dead, and then for them to actually die.
They followed the other Slytherins inside.
“Good,” he said.
He really was a prick. He hated listening to himself being a prick, but at this point, Potter was practically
“Maybe. Yes, actually, that’s not a bad idea. Put it in the pile.”
Draco was on his second cup of coffee when the owls arrived. They swooped in through the windows and his nerves spiked again as all around him the day’s
“Can I see?” she asked, and Lovegood handed her the book for a closer look.
“He can’t want revenge, Harry saved his life. And I don’t think Malfoy was all that fond of Voldemort…”
Weasley looked coolly at her, clearly not appreciating the input, but she did step towards the two pairs still fighting.
“Don’t be an idiot, Harry,” Hermione said. “Of course we’re coming back.”
"What? No. No, I'm not-"
And everything inside him froze. He still had his arm stretched out towards her and her eyes moved ever so slowly from the mark to his face. Draco felt his lungs collapse, his heart dropping into his stomach. Her mouth was moving but for a second no words came out.
“You… what?”
That was when he had gone outside to talk to Malfoy, who was apparently
Malfoy pulled an envelope from his pocket.
"Nothing. Nothing uh… just. Irie said you're odd. Not in a bad way. Seems like she likes you."
“Sorry?”
“There you are!” he called.
“Okay,” he said with a glance towards the stairs. “Sure.”
“Potter, you will be brewing your skelegro-potion again, so you can set up your cauldron anywhere you like. Everything you’ll need is already on the table. Malfoy, if you’ll come with me.”
He could see Mark from where they stood, still outside, leaning against a wall, just a silhouette against the light from inside.
“Oh. We don’t have to, it’s fine.”
“Not a lot. I’ve only just started reading,” she said. “I left the restricted section to you, but you took a while to get here, so I’ve been through the rest of the library – I figured it was better to get a broader sense of what was there before we started reading in detail.”
It was a strange week that followed the night Harry had spent with Draco in the secret room. He had to pretend that everything was normal, but he felt so obvious, like anyone who cared to look would be able to read it off him. He got distracted every time he caught sight of Draco, his heart immediately throwing itself into fits, and Harry would loose the thread of where he was going with whatever conversation he had just been in the middle of. Draco was doing much better, his studied indifference towards Harry was so flawless Harry had even started to get worried – but then Draco would gently bump into him when he passed him in the hall, or he would mutter insults at him when they were getting their ingredients for potions, and then he would catch Harry’s eye and there would be that smirk on his face, like he knew exactly how worried Harry got and was enjoying it immensely. And for some reason that was reassuring and would leave Harry with a mood that had risen by ten degrees.
“I’m glad to see you’re alright,” he said quietly.
“Yeah, forget I said anything.”
“Yes, I gathered as much.”
Her and Ron had re-joined them, she was leaning against him, his arm was looped around her waist.
"Where did you even take us?" he asked, casting his eyes around, mostly to make sure no one was around to witness the scene.
“I think so,” he said.
There was a slightly manic glint in Draco's eyes, right behind the sneering irritation, and for a second he reminded Harry absurdly of Mr Weasley.
His silver snake reappeared and he felt slightly better.
Harry dug his hands into his pockets. His mind was still hazy from drinking. Words and thoughts were coming slowly. Malfoy jutted out his chin.
“I need to talk to you,” she said.
There was a space of silence.
Harry was seriously considering not going that evening. It would be so much easier to just pretend he had forgotten. He could talk to Malfoy later, when he was able to look at his face without thinking about the kiss.
“Maybe he wasn’t able to sneak out,” said Harry, trying to sound less anxious about it than he was.
Harry looked out the windows.
“Just leave him alone. He has just as much a right to be here as we do.”
"So, when do you think the ministry people will be here?"
Harry comes and they only take a couple of seconds to catch their breaths before they disentangle from each other and Harry leaves. Draco takes a bit longer, needing a moment to steady himself, his dick still hard, his heart still beating, his fingers sticky with Potter’s come. He stays alone in the classroom and gets himself off before he leaves.
“I’m sorry I had to get you into detention.”
"It went fine, I suppose. I said what I wanted to but - do you remember that pub near my flat I've mentioned? I asked him if we could meet there since it's near the tube station - that's the underground trains I've told you about - anyway, I thought it'd be easy for him to find so… not that it made a difference, though, he was half an hour late, but the place is
“It’s evil,” he said, and the intensity in his own voice surprised him.
They were on their way up the last staircase, the one that led to the corridor with the fat lady’s portrait, when Hermione broke the silence.
“He’s not.”
She glared at him.
He sank into an armchair by the fireplace. She sat down across from him and looked at him with an expression of mixed concern and sternness that reminded him of terribly McGonagall.
Potter groaned.
She had flipped open the book while Granger spoke and was already immersed in it. A tiny smile played around the corners of her mouth.
“Bring Seamus with you, I don’t think he can walk on his own.”
“So why not-“
“Tell me again, how it was you suddenly became good at Potions after sucking worse than I did?” said Ron.
"I can't believe we almost blew your cover," Harry said.
Harry had to hold back a laugh, mostly because Malfoy attempting to parody his own poshness was almost indistinguishable from him simply being posh.
“Yeah. There aren’t a lot of second years either.”
“I didn’t think I was being friendly.”
Draco did.
“Now? I’m kind of tired.”
“Alright.”
“Yeah, I know, Malfoy. How does any of that relate to Azkaban?” she asked, not sharply, just prodding to make sure he was going somewhere.
“Look, Potter, I’m sorry about your potion earlier-“
“We should get going,” he said. “Your friends are waiting for you. They’re probably worried I’ve killed you.”
when the patronus is cast, which could just be a stylistic figure of course except”- she skipped another two pages ahead - ”here she says that they are also smaller in remote areas.”
Granger and Lovegood had taught them the runes. They didn’t have to understand them as long as they drew them correctly, so they moved forward in succession, spreading out over a stretch of wall, each etching a rune into the walls with the tip of their wands, then they all moved further down, repeated the process. The chain would run along the surface of the wall the way it had in the secret room. They had tested it across a window and it was able to breach the gap, so they assumed it would go across the cells as well as long as there was a rune on either side. The width of it was enough to shut the dementors out of the cells completely. And hopefully that would work.
“Nothing. There is nothing about Azkaban.”
There was the sound of running footsteps behind him and Harry whipped around just as Malfoy caught up with him.
“I didn’t.”
He reached the apparition point in front of the house. He had asked Hermione about them. Apparently he had been apparating illegally all over London for the past year and no one had bothered to tell him. Harry checked that the street was empty, then pulled out his wand.
Slughorn put a hand on Draco’s shoulder and it was probably supposed to demonstrate to his mother how
“Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day,” she says.
“Alright,” said Hermione. “See you later, then.”
“Really?” said Malfoy tersely, as if the word was bitter in his mouth.
"It's my birthday," Blaise added. "You can't go home now!"
“You’ll get used to it,” said Hermione.
"Alright, what?"
“I know-“
“Thanks,” she said. “Madam Pomfrey, I’m really sorry about this.”
“Which one?”
Potter only looked surprised for a second before he snapped back into paranoia.
Draco turned away from him and walked towards the door – he wasn’t going to deal with this. He was getting angry, and getting angry at Potter even though it wasn’t Potter’s fault. Just too much humiliation at once. He had never been good with humiliation. He would just leave before he said something stupid.
“I wasn’t,” said Harry. “We just talked a bit before the holidays. I thought he might have changed. I know, it’s ridiculous, you don’t have to tell me.”
“Right. My name is Belby, over there is Jansson,” he gestured to the woman who smiled thinly at them. “We’ll be taking you to the prison, but first I need both of you to place your wands on the table here, and afterwards we’re going to perform a quick security check to verify your identities and to check for any concealment spells, hidden wands, weapons, food, etcetera. You are not allowed to bring anything into Azkaban except for yourselves and the robes you’re wearing, so if you’re carrying anything with you apart from your wands, please place these objects on the table as well.”
“You think this would work down there?”
“What?” he said, looking up at her. “Oh, no reason.”
“Just unlock it,” he said. “Don’t open it. One of us should cast a patronus first.”
“We both do. I don’t want that kind of attention either.”
"It's alright," Harry said. "You can ask."
Ginny shrugged.
“Luna and I can take the brooms back to the locker rooms,” said Ginny when they were almost at the steps to the Entrance Hall. “You two just hurry and get Hermione to the Hospital Wing.”
“Look, why can’t you just tell me what’s going on?” demanded Potter, his frantic, irritated face just inches away from Draco’s. “I’m sorry about whatever it was I did, but you can’t just walk away.”
"Nice to meet you," he said.
“Oh, so you didn’t run, it was just that the stairs were a bit hard for you? Merlin, Harry, you’re getting out of shape now that you’re not chasing dark lords all the time, maybe I should write to some of my relatives-”
“What did you want to say, then?” asked Hermione, when he had been quiet for too long.
“Goodnight. You too Harry.”
And Ron didn’t hate the aurors. He took to it well. People liked him, both the instructors and the other trainees. And he was good at it. Better than Harry. Which was a good thing, Harry reminded himself. Harry had always known Ron was brilliant, but it was nice that other people were starting to realize it too. That Ron was starting to believe it.
“Nothing,” he said, trying to sound surprised. “Why would you ask that?”
But of course it wasn’t. That was the whole point. He should have just pulled his hand back as soon as Potter touched him, and now it was too late for that. Now he would have to
“I’m leaving soon,” he says instead. “And she’s going back to Hogwarts. Mr Weasley said there would be Death Eaters there this year. At the school.”
The staircase in the west wing was the least used way of getting to the lower levels of the castle, so it was unlikely they would be spotted. Still, Draco couldn’t see the point of meeting there instead of in the secret room as they had every other time.
“Hermione said she had found something, I thought maybe it was about that?” said Potter, interrupting Draco’s train wreck of thought.
“I remember that, because I was looking right at him,” she said. “I asked him to help me, in between the curses. And he just stood there, completely unaffected.”
Draco glanced over at him. His head hung limply forward. His sweater was too big and kind of lumpy, managing to swallow the shape of his shoulders, even though Potter wasn't exactly scrawny anymore. Draco tried not to look at Potter's neck, that small stretch of smooth, brown skin exposed between Potter's hair and his collar. He tried not to think about what it might be like to touch him there, to run his fingers through his thick, black hair. It didn't go very well.
“Shit, we’ll have to cook too!”
He wasn’t quite looking at Harry, but he wasn’t looking away either. He was drumming his fingers restlessly against the cigarette package in his hand.
“Malfoy-“ he starts, barely calm, but Draco cuts him off:
He didn’t mind so much today that they weren’t getting anywhere. He could remember casting the patronus the night before. The room still felt brighter. But he could tell it was getting on Granger’s nerves.
“Please don’t kill me,” said Matthew.
. I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
“Yes, and it’s okay.”
“I’m guessing cold feet,” said Ron. “How long do we give him?”
“Yeah? I mean, I thought you liked girls, but you know…”
He broke off and looked from Harry to Hermione.
It didn’t sound like nothing, and suddenly the silence between them was tense rather than triumphant. He knew it seconds before it happened what it was Potter was about to say, because apparently he hadn’t gotten away with anything. Potter hadn’t let it go, he had just saved it for later. For now, apparently.
The four of them joined the steady trickle of students coming down the marble staircase. Ahead of them, Draco noticed professor Sprout and the headmistress standing close together outside the doors to the Great Hall. They were talking fervently, and then Sprout gestured to the stairs, McGonagall turned her head and looked right at the little group of Slytherins. Her eyes settled on Draco. For a short moment, she held his gaze and his heart stilled. Then she turned back to sprout, and Draco grabbed Pansy’s arm.
“I trust him.”
She sighed.
He fought back irritation – he couldn’t blame her that she hadn’t gotten anywhere. He should have been working too, pulling his part of it.
“I don’t know!” he said. “I don’t know anything about it except that it’s bad. I think it might be sort of like… like a very bright light, you know? You can’t look at it directly without hurting your eyes, but even though you don’t look at the source, you can still see the light - and maybe Azkaban is evil in the same way, where it hurts too much to think about it, so people just don’t, and instead it becomes this black spot that they work around without considering it, even the ones who guard the place, and the ones who sentence people to go to there. But just because we don’t look at the source that doesn’t mean the evil doesn’t affect us. Does that make sense?”
He was leading them swiftly down the hallway outside the office.
“I think I could sleep too.”
“Yeah,” said Draco. “I can.”
a possibility, Harry,” she said, eyeing him before he could speak. “But no matter what his intentions are, I think we can agree that Azkaban is something we should do something about. We’ll have to do some research, check up on some of the things he said and find out the best course of action, which might be not to go there at all. And if we do have to and we still don’t trust him, then we just won’t take him with us. It’s not like he’ll be able to secretly turn the plans into something else if we’re all working together.”
Harry ascended the stairs and made his way back to Gryffindor tower. It was a long walk from the dungeons and since the corridors were mostly empty this time of night, it gave him some time to think.
She turned to look out at the scenery rushing by outside. She tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. He remembered that his mother used to talk about how well he and Pansy matched, her jet-black hair and his white-blond, his paleness to her darker colours. He remembered how she had stopped when it became clear that Pansy wouldn’t grow up to be pretty. She did look pretty to him, though she always got pissed when he tried to tell her. He realized how much he had missed her and her meanness. She was hard and sharp and would never be nice, not even to him, but their friendship was one thing he didn’t need to spend his time mending.
Pansy shrugged.
“I’m seriously concerned about your mental health, Potter. Would you mind giving me a heads up if you’re about to be possessed by some freaky creature from down there?”
Ron frowned at him, but didn’t say anything. He resumed his reading of the chocolate frog cards. There was a stretch of silence before Draco cleared his throat and in a strained attempt at a casual tone asked Harry:
Her voice finally became serious, hard and sharp the way it did when she would quiz him and Ron on homework:
“Yeah. I was afraid I wouldn’t catch you before you left.”
“I would prefer if we could talk face to face. I know you have no reason to want to meet with me, but I would be very grateful if you would… consider it, at least.”
more than anything – and he was so proud of you, Draco. He loved you so much.”
“That was all practical, this is theory. I hate theory.”
“He might have faked it,” he said. “But I won’t see him again no matter if he’s alive or dead, so it doesn’t matter that much to me.”
“What?”
He would have liked to get a hold of Potter, but he had no way of contacting him. Sending him an owl this time of night would likely result in waking up every Gryffindor in his dormitory, and Potter had asked that they be discreet, so sending him panicked notes about his nightmares at ungodly hours was probably not the best way to go about it.
“Harry!” exclaimed Parvati, and Harry started and realized he had accidentally tilted the pitcher, spilling a sea of juice on the table.
She was about to say something else, but then the portrait hole burst open and the rest of the Gryffindor quidditch team emerged, chatting happily. Ron made a beeline for the table where Harry and Hermione sat.
He looked worn out.
Harry turned around in his seat to see another person approaching their table. He was a white boy with soft, brown curls and bright, smiling eyes.
“No, it’s not about him! Didn’t you hear what I said? He’s dead. It’s that place – it’s evil.”
He pulls his hands back, sits back up, still in Draco’s lap, but only for a second. Draco reaches out to touch him and Harry moves away.
It was such a small inflection in his tone. He probably would have sounded polite to anyone else, but Harry could hear the laugh, the condescending smile that was just about to break through.
He had been screaming.
Crabbe had known it too.
Draco laughed. It hurt terribly and sounded shallow and broken. He heard the door slam. His laughter dried out. He took a deep breath and sat up slowly, his body aching, then carefully stood up. He touched his chin again where Potter had struck him. It was sore. There would probably be a bruise, but it was nothing he couldn’t fix himself. At least his teeth were intact. He straightened his clothes, ran his fingers through his hair to put it back in place and wiped a bit of blood from the corner of this mouth.
She put her hand on the door and looked quickly back at them.
“You think?” he said.
He could hear her thinking she was being sensible, hear her deciding in her head that she wasn’t lecturing him. And he thought he had been rehearsing sentences in his head too, but they were all gone. He tried to push the irritation back into a corner of his mind, reminded himself that he wanted them to make up.
"Why the hell are you up so early, then?"
“That’s good, then we won’t have people accidentally passing by. It’s not the room of requirement, but I suppose it’ll have to do. We’ll need to figure out a couple of different routes to get here, though, so people don’t see us wandering off to the same, empty part of the castle every week or however often we’ll be meeting. Do you have the map with you?”
you?”
She looked at him.
“And what if Malfoy
“Think so. This isn’t weird is it?”
"Oh," Malfoy said. "I thought…" He began, but trailed off.
Draco rolled up his sleeves. He usually never did, never wore short sleeves on anything, and kept his arms covered at all times. But it was awfully hot in there, and he was at work, he was wearing his apron and he was invisible. Irie had seen the mark before anyway. She'd told him it was a cool tattoo.
“That’s interesting. Maybe it’s broken. After Longbottom you’re probably the least Slytherin student in all of Hogwarts.”
“It’s alright, Harry,” she said. “I think we all overreacted a bit. So what do you think we should do about Azkaban?”
“No, of course not. I haven’t spent Christmas with them since I was 10.”
"I wanted to ask you about something," she said.
"I'll be going out after dinner," he said.
She kept her stiff gaze turned away from him
“I think she will be.”
“Something like that. By the way, your owl came after you left. She let me have the letter when I said I’d bring it up here.”
“Then why-“
“Where are we going?” called Malfoy, when he was close enough to be heard.
Harry flinched. But Ron and Hermione already knew, the others would find out sooner or later.
“Yeah,” he said lamely.
this works, we might be able to create a sort of… web. Right?”
Draco went to the library after dinner to start his work on an essay for Muggle Studies. It had remained a mandatory class, though the curriculum had changed drastically since the previous year, and he was having a hard time keeping up. The teacher was fairly competent, though it seemed to him she was trying to squeeze way too much information into one year of teaching, and covering too broad areas for one subject, which meant that the content of the lessons varied greatly from time to time. Sometimes she was teaching political science or economics, which was like the muggle version of what Draco’s private tutors had taught him when he was younger. Other times the class completely shifted it’s focus onto arithmancy and muggle science, which would then turn into a history-class instead. It was a nightmare, and Draco was aware that he might have to ask some of the halfblood Ravenclaws for help sooner or later.
"It's not as straight forward as you might think. You should have seen the looks I got the first time I asked someone for a quill. And actually, can you explain that to me - why do we spend galleons and galleons on self-inking quills when muggles have already invented
“Don’t you think that might pose a tiny problem for us when we go to Azkaban?”
“Good.”
, it's unbearable."
to assume that there is a vast, hidden magical society existing invisibly in parallel with their own. They assume I'm just weird."
Hermione was sitting in a corner of the common room with a couple of the other Gryffindors. Seamus looked up when Ron and Harry came over.
Harry nodded. Quiet settled between them. Harry glanced around the room, searching for something else to talk about, but once again every topic felt loaded.
Professor McGonagall sat behind her desk and looked up when Draco stepped inside.
She stopped.
"It's not my fault you don't know how to cross a fucking street."
Harry's jaw tightened.
He went in and closed the door behind him. Pansy was sitting on her bed, she had probably been talking to Daphne before he came.
“Stay away from my friends!”
He isn’t lying, though. He isn’t lying, but it still takes Draco a second to comprehend the words. A second to reshape the memory. A dark tower on a cold night, a flash of green, an old man falling limply over the battlements. Draco’s wand still pointed at him, even if he didn’t cast the spell. And Potter there, watching the whole thing. Draco feels like he’s falling. His skin is jittery, he wants to run, but he remains stiffly frozen in place.
“So it’s just me?” said Potter, halfway smiling as if he wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the two of them confiding in each other.
Potter smiled, and Draco could feel his heartbeat all the way to the tips of his fingers. And then Potter moved his hand from Draco's shoulder to his neck, fingertips resting lightly against his skin, surely able to feel his pulse hammering out the rhythm of Draco's panic as Potter halfway leaned halfway stumbled into another kiss. It was clumsy, just a brief press of soft lips, a second where Draco could smell Potter's awful breath when he pulled away, the pressure of Potter's hand on his shoulder as he braced against him for balance. Draco's mind didn't even have time to catch up before it was over. Potter's eyes were half-closed, he seemed to be looking down at where his hand was resting on Draco's arm as if he too was confused about what it was doing there.
“He has to know about the source. He would know where the dementors come from.”
“We are witnessing
“Right,” said Harry. “Of course. Who knows memory charms apart from Hermione?”
“Would you maybe turn on the light?” he asked.
He reached for the door handle.
,” she said forcefully.
He wasn’t even sure what he was trying to say anymore.
Harry raised his wand.
– he’s the one you’re friends with.”
“You can say his name.”
rang out in the corridor, they stabbed through Draco and he ignored it perfectly as he kept on walking – which meant he was yanked backwards when Pansy stopped and was only inches from crashing into Blaise as he spun round, his wand already out and aimed at the girl’s back.
“You should really start calling me Harry.”
“Me too.”
Malfoy nodded. Harry sort of expected him to go on, to say something else, maybe ask more about patronus shapes, but he didn’t.
"Well, that's not very reassuring," she said, but she sat down anyway.
“We’re not going to the secret room.”
Draco sank deeper into the seat with a low groan and hid his face in his hands.
“Fuck you, Malfoy. I swear, if you’re plotting anything-“
Ron laughed.
"Since they started jumping at every little chance they get to get me in trouble, Potter. I'm not exactly popular with them at the moment."
Draco looked at her. Her skin was sallow in the ghostly light. The need to hurry was gone. Here, time stood still.
“What?”
So they would be back soon. That should have made him feel better. It didn't. It would be nice to have Malfoy back, to have just one person in the room he actually knew. But he didn't like Mark. He was nice enough, he just seemed a bit… clingy. He had just met Malfoy, so why was he hanging all over him? Shouldn't he talk to his friends too, instead of leaving that to Harry?
It sounds exactly as dumb as he thought it would.
There was a rustle of paper, and Draco turned away from the patronus to see Lovegood pulling out the sketch of Azkaban that he had made for Granger for what seemed a hundred years ago. Draco wasn’t good at drawing. He apparently wasn’t very good at remembering architectural layouts either, and the sketch was pretty lacking. Lovegood took a quill and placed little marks along the wall of his attempt to do a cross section of the building. Draco clenched and unclenched his hands as he watched her. He looked from her to Granger.
“It’s fine, you’ll be fine,” said Harry, his words nearly drowned out by another barrage of spells from above. “We’ll get you to the hospital wing as soon as we’re back.”
”Oh, we should have bought something for Professor McGonagall!” said Hermione when she saw it. ”Why didn’t we think of that?”
Three cells from Lucius, Granger stopped. Draco didn’t want to look, but he heard her gasp and couldn’t help it. He followed her gaze to the human figure that lay sunken into a heap against the back wall of the cell. Chains trailed from the bone-like wrists to bolts in the wall. The hands were bloody messes, wrong and shapeless, like he had been fighting his restraints until he started breaking bones, and then perhaps beyond that. He was only half clothed. The dirty rags barely covered his upper body and failed completely to hide his genitals or the dark streaks of filth down his thighs. His head hung forward, his face barely visible. His hair was matted in thick clots but barely reached past his ears. They must have shaved him when he was imprisoned, because the last time Draco had seen the man in the cell, his hair had been long – long and clean and shiny, tied back in an elegant ponytail.
The anti-climax of their discovery settled in his chest as a tense lump of anticipation. He remembered his thoughts from the other night. As soon as they had even the slightest chance of success, they had to go. So if they thought this might work, if this was the solution they were going with, that meant they were going to Azkaban.
Harry looked up at him.
He was hit suddenly by vivid memories of the time he had spent guarded by dementors before his trial; the way a smell can trigger half forgotten childhood memories, so his fear tasted queasily of dementors. The fear convulsed in his chest, he was about to turn around, tell them it was hopeless and – and there was the tower. It materialized suddenly about a hundred meters ahead of them where before there had been nothing; a looming, triangular building shrouded in unnatural silence. Draco breathed a sigh of relief. He adjusted their direction. They began their descent.
Granger had pulled out her wand. She held the book in her other hand and carefully recreated the pair of runes on the wall. Then she moved about a foot down the wall and did it again. She levelled her wand at the second set. Draco recognized the stance immediately, the way she placed her fingers on her wand, he had done it a thousand times himself by now. But it was very different from watching Potter cast the spell – he did it so effortlessly, made it look so straightforward, like it was just brandishing and shouting. Granger’s brow was furrowed in concentration, her hand tense on the wand - she made it look exactly as difficult as it was.
He ignored her.
A second crash and the light in the tower dimmed as if the power had been cut. The glow condensed around the thin wire of the patronus chain, and then it snapped just as Draco’s patronus had in the pit. Harry threw himself at the railing, looking up in time to see red light flashing from the topmost gallery. A girl cried out, the words lost as her voice echoed down the tower. Harry thought it might have been Ginny.
She shrugged.
“He isn’t here yet,” he informed him.
"What are you waiting for, Potter?" he snapped.
He flicked his wrist, she parried.
me. And then he laughed about it like it was just a joke, and then he just left.”
“Malfoy.”
Harry leaned against the wall. There was a microwave in the kitchen. Harry couldn't remember the last time he had seen one of those. It had probably been at Hermione's parent’s house, but he hadn't visited them in forever. He really didn't spend a lot of time in muggle homes anymore.
“You think we aren’t?”
“What does Granger say about me?” he asked, grinning back.
“I don’t know,” said Granger. “He looks ancient.”
“So can you do it?” he asked. “The patronus charm?”
“No. Sometimes I just can’t believe the shit Potter has gotten all of you into. I assume it was his idea?”
“Right, I meant apart from that. You’re sure you don’t want us to help out a bit with that? I know Luna is helping you, but the rest of us have time too…?”
Harry crossed and uncrossed his arms. Ron released Hermione and she looked up at him and then at Harry with a wry smile.
“What about Hermione?” said Harry.
Harry slumps against the wall, heart thundering, his whole body feels electric, his fingers might be trembling. He watches as Malfoy pulls out his wand and locks the door before turning back to him. Malfoy’s face is flushed. He takes a step toward Harry, Harry leans in but Malfoy shoves him back, his hand flat on Harry’s chest, and about half of Harry’s excitement is pure adrenaline, because they didn’t use to lock the door, that was part of the game, and Harry was always the one who shoved. He can feel Malfoy’s breath on his face. Malfoy is looking down, eyes fixed on the hand on Harry’s chest that keeps him pressed back against the wall. His mouth is slightly open, Harry wants to kiss him again, which is weird now that he is so painfully aware that Draco shouldn’t be attractive. It’s something he’s been trying to focus on all year, looking for everything ugly about Malfoy, all the marks of his desperation; his sleep deprived eyes, hollowing cheeks, sallow skin, as well as the things that were always there; his too narrow, too pointy face, his too long nose, his thin lips. And he’s an awful person, obviously. And once again it doesn’t seem to matter at all. Harry laughs.
He zoned out, thoughts drifting back to the coffee shop, and then to the girl, and then, inevitably, to Potter. He put his hand over his left arm and rubbed at the mark with his thumb - he couldn't feel it through the fabric, but every so often there was an imagined itch, a slight burning… Between the bodies of the people standing in the middle aisle, he caught a glimpse of his own face reflected in the dark glass opposite him. He looked scruffy and worn and exactly as tired as he felt. The shock had mostly lifted, but there was still that lump of sadness in his gut.
“You’ve been pushing me away all year.”
“Oh,” she said and lowered her voice. “How is she doing?”
Harry looked at the glass and then up at Malfoy.
Harry had noticed it too. It was a small place with grimy windows and a sort of run down air about it, but not in the cosy way of the place they had been with Malfoy's colleagues.
“God,” she said quietly.
He convinces himself that it’s over, but two days later he’s in a bathroom stall with his hand curled in Draco’s silky, blond hair. And the day after that, Draco whispers in his ear again.
Potter stopped. Draco walked faster down the steps to catch up with him, and then they were both standing there at the foot of the stairs with just a little more distance between them than what would be considered relaxed, a little too far apart for a normal conversation. And Draco realized that he had called out before actually thinking about what he wanted to say.
Her voice was glass.
“You shouldn’t have had to go there,” she said. “You shouldn’t have had to see your father like that.”
“Malfoy and Luna and I, we’ve figured out how to kill the dementors.”
“Yeah. We got it back in the wardrobe, but he was pissed. And really freaked out. He looked completely shaken, so I – this is the weird part. You can laugh if you want to.”
They did not laugh, but the figure of Lord Voldemort had stopped moving.
But Potter didn't let go, he just leaned into Draco a little more, his face so close Draco could smell the beer on his breath. Potter was staring at him, brow furrowed, his eyes swimming and unfocused.
“Harry, wait a second,” said Hermione.
“Yeah,” he said.
Slowly, he climbed to his feet.
Without their watches, he quickly lost sense of time. It reminded him of the Department of Mysteries, this endless walk down dark routes where they had no idea what awaited them. Draco looked scared. His eyes darted back and forth, he kept looking back over his shoulder. Harry tried not to worry about Ron and Ginny or Neville and Luna, wherever they were above them.
“It’s just that you were turning all
They stayed in the room for a while, but not much else was said. They mostly kissed, which was surprisingly easy. It didn’t leave any room for thinking.
Granger ignored her, her eyes were on Draco. She looked far too serious for his liking.
That smirk – it really wasn’t a wonder that Harry had always suspected him of being up to something when the guy managed to look like a cat that had just devoured someone’s goldfish about eighty percent of the time he came close to smiling. Harry turned away so he wouldn’t have to look at him. It was good his control of the patronus was so secure now; he was pretty sure he wouldn’t have been able to focus enough to cast it with a smirking Malfoy in the room back when he was thirteen.
"I've got a muggle job, Potter,” Malfoy said, undoing the window latch. “Very hard to get through without cigarette breaks."
,” said Ron at the same time Hermione said “
“Shut up, you lying bitch. You have no idea what you’re talking about.”
"Odd," Harry said, without thinking.
“I just want some sort of explanation, alright-“
“Yeah. It was brilliant.”
Malfoy remains in the hospital wing for two days. Harry can’t help thinking it ought to take longer when you’ve been that close to dying. He also can’t stop staring at Malfoy. He wishes he would make a scene out of it like he did the time Buckbeak scratched him – it would be so nice if he would just go back to being awful so things could stop being so complicated and Harry could simply hate him again.
“I just… didn’t expect you to show up.”
Harry hesitated.
Hermione’s blush deepened.
She dropped the hand that was on his shoulder and instead took hold of his forearm.
“Are we going to do group battles too?” she called to them.
"I'm buying a drink," he said, mimicking Draco's cool tone so perfectly, Draco ought to receive an Order of Merlin for not punching him in the face.
She lifted her head with a start, her eyes slow and confused before they settled on him. She stood up quickly, gathering her robes around her against the cold.
and him trying to explain that they were definitely
that a lot of students wouldn’t be returning to Hogwarts after the horrors of the previous year when Snape and the Carrows ran the school. Many had moved to other schools abroad or they had been pulled out to be home-schooled. And of course there had been casualties amongst the students too. She didn’t know exactly how many it was.
The dormitory filled with a soft, pearly glow.
"Really?"
“Oh, the hours of Potter-analysis I could have been spared from if only you had found out earlier.”
Granger hesitated.
“Expecto patronum!” he yelled, but it didn’t sound like a spell anymore; they were just words.
"I don't really care. But you're right, the Leaky would probably be awful."
Potter approached him the day after the unsuccessful meeting to tell him that Lovegood and the other Gryffindors were still with them. It was four more days before they were able to gather again for a second attempt at planning.
It went more easily than he had dared to hope. He was waiting by the stairs to the dungeon – he was always waiting, apparently Potter had no qualms about the minutes of agony and boredom he so shamelessly put Draco through whenever they were supposed to meet. And if he was going to show up at all, then today of all days it would have been a kind gesture to be on time, but apparently that was beyond Potter’s capability.
“That’s not true-“ Hermione began.
“Right,” said Potter. “Do you want to meet back here tomorrow and get started?”
He passed through the great oak doors and out into the chill evening air. It wasn’t completely dark yet. Great clouds were rolling over the skies like soft mountains, coloured gold and rose by the last rays of sunlight. Autumn was coming and though the day had been fairly warm, the temperature was dropping quickly. His school robes were charmed to adjust to the weather within a certain limit, and they would be fine for flying, even if they weren’t as good as his quidditch robes. Harry mounted his broom and kicked off. He sped upwards, accelerating to greater height as his mind went quiet, his thoughts unable to keep up, and blind relief surged through him. He headed towards the forest.
She shook her head.
“I can pay for my own drinks.”
He pressed his lips together and said nothing more.
“Hi,” he said.
"How? You aren't breaking the statute if you're just here by yourself."
Malfoy shrugged.
“That’s different!” he sputtered. “That’s- we’re not-  Besides, boys can’t even get into the girls’ dormitories, the stairs turn into a slide!”
“I do like girls, though. Not anyone specific, not right now but just… in general?”
“It could have been a natural occurrence. A place that made people evil, not a place made evil by people. But it looks like this was always the intention. It was made to be a prison. Makes you feel sort of hopeless, doesn’t it?”
“Why do you need her?” asked Matthew.
There shouldn’t have been any doubt.
"Thought you said you didn't visit Diagon Alley anymore."
"I guess one of us has to be."
“If I may.”
He grabbed Granger’s arm and pulled her up. Her eyes were unfocused, she blinked slowly. Her wand slipped between her fingers and clattered to the floor. The ghostly remnant of the otter patronus vaporizedt, the dementors flocked closer, and Draco felt the endless misery drift from his mind throughout his whole body like a cold shiver, the sort of sadness that meant he would never be happy again. The nostrils of Harry’s stag flared wide as it tripped a nervous step backwards. Draco inadvertently followed the movement.
“I don’t know.”
The paper is red soaked through already, so he takes it off and throws it in the bin by the door. Draco gets off the table and crosses over to him.
“I didn’t die.”
He straightened up and looked towards the staircase at the end of the hallway with the expression of a man facing Azkaban.
“Didn’t see you cast one either.”
"Oh, shut up," Draco snapped. "Anyway, Potter, these are my colleagues, who I am sure would eventually introduce themselves if we waited long enough, but how about we just get it over with now?"
from his expression, to see the fury and the betrayal in his eyes.
Draco felt an uncomfortable twist in his gut.
“No one’s listening.”
“Good thing they’re friendly!”
“Yeah? And how did it go with
Harry shrugged.
,” said McGonagall, unfazed. “They’re a kind of muggle mind-healers.”
“That chapter made no sense at all,” said Granger.
“Sounds possible,” he said. “It’s a good theory. But it won’t help us actually do it.”
“Yes.”
“No thanks,” she said. “I think we’re on the right track, we just keep hitting… walls.”
"Why can't she ask me herself?" Harry snarled.
“Then what were you freaking out about?”
“Dumbledore isn’t here!” hisses Tonks. “What about your own children?”
“Is that really what you think of me? I do want this. I want it so badly, and I don’t give a fuck about the secrecy. I never expected anything else. I know you would break this off with me in a heartbeat if one of them as much as looked at you funny.”
“Speaking of ferrets, look who’s coming down late today,” said Ron.
He still wasn't looking at Draco's face when he said it. His thumb was stroking the fabric of Draco's sleeve. Draco just stared at him. At this drunk boy, who was definitely Harry Potter, who looked like he would pass out the second he was horizontal, who still for some reason had decided to stay standing, who had just kissed him, again, and was still touching him, as if that was allowed.
Lovegood nodded.
“Of course you didn’t,” he breathes and it’s almost a laugh.
“No, I got the
Potter looked disoriented for a second, and Draco could feel it too: the ground shifting beneath them, because they both remembered yesterday. Things were different now. This wouldn’t be a fight.
,” he said, but he put his wand back in its holster, and just like that, Draco became air.
Harry nodded to the parchment.
Harry sighed.
Draco nodded.
Thankfully, the street was deserted except for the two of them. Only about every other street lamp was lit, the sickly yellow circles beneath them seeming to serve more to highlight the darkness than to actually brighten the street. The houses were big but decrepit, looming hollow-eyed behind Georgian terraces and ornate iron railings. It looked like it might have been a wealthy neighbourhood once, but now the air had a distinct smell of piss and there were overflowing rubbish bins by nearly every front yard.
She looked absolutely shocked – if he had known this was such a sensitive subject he certainly would have breached it more carefully, but he hadn’t expected her to be so touchy about the library of all things.
“They won’t want to,” said Hermione.
Pansy frowned.
“About what?”
“What, you’re not going to tell me what happened?”
Ginny lowered her wand. She was sweating and out of breath. Ron was bleeding from where a severing charm or something like it had brushed his cheek. Harry’s heart was pounding hard, his fingers felt strange and numb. He watched Neville step over the fallen auror at his feet to kneel down by Luna.
“You wouldn’t understand,” he said.
“I’m better now.”
“It’s a hallway,” he said.
The warmth lingered and they stayed outside for the rest of the afternoon. Dean, Seamus and Hannah Abbott joined them under the willow later on and overall it was very pleasant, except Harry felt like they might have dismissed the issue of Malfoy a little too quickly. He didn’t bring it up again, but he couldn’t stop worrying and their apparent carelessness annoyed him. When they went to the Great Hall for dinner, he kept an eye on the Slytherin table as it filled up. Malfoy wasn’t with Blaise Zabini and Daphne Greengrass, or with Tracey Davis, Millicent Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson, who came in shortly after the other two. In fact, he didn’t show up until the food had already appeared on the tables, and when he did he was by himself.
,” he interrupted her. “As long as we don’t try to move anyone, they don’t alert the aurors, that’s the only reason we can do this. We don’t know what will happen if we start
Draco smiled meekly at that and Pansy did too. He reached for her and pulled her into a hug. Her arms tightened around him immediately, reflexively. He held onto her and breathed in the familiar scent of her hair, felt the rhythm of her chest rising and falling against his, and the calm and safety that her closeness promised.
Pansy nodded.
There was a crashing sound of branches snapping.
He wasn’t looking at her anymore.
, Harry, you don’t have to keep it from us.”
”I’m sure she doesn’t care,” Harry said.
should stop talking like you were just innocent bystanders - you were all helping them, you were turning us in.”
“You already know why,” he said. “Why are you asking me?”
None of the Gryffindor boys had started packing until the last evening, so after the feast their dormitory dissolved into accusations of uniform theft, attempts at bribing each other to face Madam Pince and turn in the overdue library books that had turned up in the strangest places, yelling about summer plans and promises of writing each other and keeping in touch. They didn’t get much sleep.
“Well, shit.”
“I’m so sorry, my love,” said Narcissa.
“It was his own fault,” said Potter, but he glanced away when he said it. “He started the fire.”
“Bloody hell, will you keep it down?” he hisses. “I told you, that’s not what I’m here for.”
“He is such a
The silvery light illuminated both of them and Draco could feel the protection of the spell as a physical touch of warmth. He looked at Potter, smiling so much it hurt, and Potter was grinning back at him. It felt like doing magic for the first time.
“Yes,” he said.
“I’m sure.”
“It is for me!”
His voiced echoed off the walls but Harry kept walking. When he disappeared around a corner, Draco’s arms fell to his sides. He took a deep breath to compose himself, suppress the boiling feelings, and then he started walking down the hall to the dungeons.
"Yes," said Malfoy calmly, as if he hadn't noticed Harry's near-death experience at all.
"I'm meeting some friends for chips and a pint in half an hour."
“Merlin, poor child,” she muttered.
They had slowed down and were gliding quietly through the air. Harry’s heart was still pounding, but he could feel the shock seeping out of him. He was watching Malfoy, who rolled his eyes at him.
“Me too. But it’s more Tom than Voldemort.”
“Think you would have done well in Slytherin, Potter?”
They finished their breakfast and managed to keep up a bit of conversation, though it mainly consisted of people asking to be passed the jam or the juice or the toast with perhaps too many pleases and thank yous. There were no other outbursts from the Slytherins. When the Gryffindors were done eating, they excused themselves, and just as he stood up, Harry leaned in close to Draco and whispered:
"I guess," Harry said.
“Aren’t you two still fighting?” asked Tracey.
“Alright.”
Malfoy snorted.
“I know it,” said Granger.
Potter laughed.
She let go of Harry’s arm and he took a hesitant step towards Draco.
“I’ve been thinking about why we’re doing this,” said Granger.
"What does it matter?" Ron snapped. "She's not the only one who's worried, you know, and I think we need to talk about-"
“Really?”
He was only halfway asleep and it was only halfway a dream: the icy, feathery touch of Malfoy’s fingers on his skin. The strange look in his eyes when he leaned towards him. The soft press of his lips against Harry’s. The way the kiss had trickled through him. The violent burst of
“What do you suggest we do?” asks Mrs Weasley sharply. “Send him back out there to be killed?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter’s smile faded and Draco wanted to kick himself.
"Grimmauld Place," Potter said. " 's where I live. Number 12."
“Hermione really wants us to learn magical housekeeping though…”
Ron didn't look up from his book, but he wasn’t turning the pages either.
“When did I say that? You met with Harry Potter, most famous wizard in Britain, your childhood crush and your self-proclaimed nemesis, in what universe would I not want to know how it went?"
She wasn’t being loud, none of them were, but her voice was pulled tight as a wire. Harry hadn’t known that she hated her. They had never talked about Parkinson except in relation to Malfoy, but looking at the way the two girls were staring at each other, he had never despised Malfoy half as much as Ginny despised Pansy.
“Please?” he said.
After Christmas, it was friends and order members who flocked to the burrow. Hermione had insisted on spending most of her break at home and didn’t arrive until the day before New Years. She had been very tense when her parents picked her up at the train station. She hadn’t said anything, but Harry thought it had to be because of the memory charm. Their memories had been restored, but it had to be hard to forget that not that long ago, they wouldn’t even have recognized her. Luna, Neville, Dean and Seamus came for the New Years Eve party too.
Light flared from the tip of Hermione’s wand, illuminating the darkness, the staircase and the dementors. They were everywhere. Close, towering over them on every side, only just out of reach of the patronuses. Draco made a strangled noise behind him. Harry felt his stomach twist. Each winded breath was a cold stab down his throat. He had never seen this many dementors in his life; they were packed together so tightly the movement of one was a wave through all of them, the mass parting ahead of their little group and retracting again behind. Harry hadn’t noticed the sound before, in the dark it had seemed only a draught of wind. Now he could see the gaping mouths and the sound dissolved into hundreds of individual breaths.
“Oh, right I forgot,” Malfoy sneers. “
“This isn’t getting us anywhere. I’ll head back down to the library. Who knows, there might be
She closed her book, keeping a finger between the pages.
“Yeah, I used to think that too. I’ve been talking to him for a while, Ron, and like I said, I’m not an idiot-“
He didn’t need a potion to help him sleep. Of course there was no shame in needing one, as Neville had said. Except he had thought Harry couldn’t sleep because of the war. He had thought Harry was awake because of nightmares. And Neville was wrong. And Harry was ashamed. It coiled and twisted in his gut. He was never going to sleep again.
She crossed her arms.
"Being a dick?"
Maya raised her glass.
“Why did you and Weasley break up?” Draco asks, as if reading Harry’s mind.
“I don’t know.”
“That’s not the point, I know he couldn’t,” Hermione snapped. “The point is that that’s not something normal people should be able to just watch, but he’s probably been practicing the cruciatus curse on first years, and he’d lived in that house with all those Death Eaters for who knows how long, so he’d probably seen it a hundred times before, so he
“It’s not my fault you’re practically an elf,” said Draco, ignoring Harry’s attempts to free himself. “Besides, I feel absolutely awful. Someone had the brilliant idea that we should have a little end of the year party in Slytherin last night, I’ve hardly slept at all.”
“Sorry.”
"What? Sorry, did you say something?"
"Yeah, I suppose it is," said Harry lamely.
“Well,” said Ginny. “Should we get going?”
“It’s weird that they let the Death Eaters come back, isn’t it?” commented Justin Finch Fletchley instead.
Potter was scowling at him. Behind him, Draco could make out Granger watching them. He couldn't imagine she would approve of Potter accosting him like this and he really wished she had done a better job of holding him back.
They would end up with their own cells.
Draco slammed the door behind him.
Harry turned to look behind them. He could make out the castle as a black shape in the darkness, dotted with the golden lights of the windows like a strange, low hanging cluster of stars.
“So… you don’t want to visit your father?”
“Goodbye,” she said. “I’ll see you this summer.”
He raised his wand and began casting spells, going through a long series of revealing and disarming charms, half of which Draco had never heard before. The other auror, Jansson, had her wand trained on them as well, but didn’t cast any spells. He assumed she was just standing by as extra security if they were to try anything even without their wands, but then he felt the clammy sensation of another mind brushing against his own. He started. The feeling was gone before he managed to put up any occlumency barriers. He scowled at her and there was the tiniest notion of a smile on her face. Belby finished up his incantations and asked them to follow him.
“When?” shot Matthew.
She licked her chapped lips and mumbled something else, but he couldn’t make out the words. He could hardly make out her face anymore either and he realized how dark it had gotten around them, that the light was the flickering yellow of oil lamps not the steady silver of the patronus. He turned, and saw the backs of his mother and the auror far ahead. They hadn’t noticed he had stopped. He felt the unnatural cold biting into his flesh.
“I was
this."
“Hey, can I talk to you for a second?” he asked her.
Then he pulled out his wand and twirled it between his fingers for a while, already knowing which spell he was going to cast, but putting it off for no reason other than that it was slightly embarrassing even with no one there to see him.
remembered to cover it up. He considered reaching for his wand – he wouldn’t mind going to Azkaban, that was fine, as long as he got to kill Harry Potter and forget that this ever happened. He yanked down his sleeve staring defiantly back at Potter.
, so it obviously didn't count, and Draco's brain absolutely shouldn't be short circuiting over the fact that he was touching him.
“Maybe I just wanted to give Gryffindor a shot at winning this year.”
He stood with his back to Draco, his hand resting on the knob. Draco watched his shoulders rise and fall. He was clutching his wand tightly. The room was silent. Draco could hear his own, uneven breath.
“I didn’t want to be in some classroom where people might accidentally walk in.”
“There they are,” said Luna.
“And what if I survive too?”
“Sorry,” he said, hastily putting it back down and reaching for napkins to throw in the puddle and soak up the mess.
Harry picked a workstation and pulled out his potions textbook. He listened to Slughorn instruct Malfoy on how he wanted him to catalogue newly received ingredients for the potions class.
But then they'd had time, and Ron and Hermione had started to breathe easier, and Harry had just slept less and less. He'd been constantly tired. He hadn't talked much to the other people in the auror training program, and he had never gone with them when they went out for drinks. Ron had done his best to bring him along, to drag him into conversations, and he'd been nice about it, but Harry had known he was holding him back, getting in the way of Ron making new friends. Harry hadn't wanted to make new friends. He hadn't liked any of them much. He'd dragged himself through four months of training and hated every minute of it, but it had taken Hermione sitting him down and telling him he had to quit before he'd even realized that it wasn’t supposed to be like that. He'd just assumed everyone else hated it too – half the time all they'd talked about was how hard it was and how unfair the teachers were. He supposed he'd expected it to be more like the DA or the Order of the Phoenix. Something that made sense, seemed meaningful, where he could keep doing what he was good at. It turned out fighting Voldemort didn’t actually prepare you for working in law enforcement. Most people there hadn't been like Tonks or Moody. It turned out Harry wasn’t very good at following orders. It turned out he still hated the Ministry – it was changing after the war, sure, but it wasn’t changing very quickly. His instructors, the older officers, hadn't wanted him to think for himself, but he sure as hell hadn't been going to let them think for him.
He fell silent again.
“What?”
"Do you hear yourself?" Blaise said. "You're not Harry Potter, for Merlin's sake. So what if a couple of people who thought you'd fled the country find out you're still in London? I promise I'll drag you out of there if you try to sing, but you would have to embarrass yourself pretty extravagantly if you're going to spawn the kind of gossip you seem to imagine your mere presence will cause."
And then the phone rang.
Harry turned to reach for the clock on his desk and winced. His head hurt. A nauseating tightness behind the eyes, an insistent pounding in his temples. Everything hurt. His mouth tasted like something had died in there.
"You know I could make you a sleeping draught if you ever needed one-"
“You think they would have let me into the room of requirement? Really? I didn’t have a choice, Potter.”
So he kissed him. Gently, carefully. Potter’s lips were chapped and dry, but his mouth was soft, he didn’t pull away. Draco could feel the silken warmth of his breath on his mouth when he pulled back. He closed his eyes for a second and swallowed. Then he lowered his hand. Potter had let go of his arm.
Most of his friends from Hogwarts had found out he had some kind of muggle job, but Pansy was the only one who knew what he actually did. She had been laughing herself into hysterics thinking about him saying "good morning" and "how may I help you?" to perfect strangers all day, and he had fed her with stories of his misery, but he never told her about this: that when he went into the tiny closet they called the back room and put on his stupid, green apron, he became invisible. When he went back out there and stood behind the counter, he wasn't Draco Malfoy to anyone. None of them knew of his father or his family, they didn't know about the war or about Voldemort. Even if they came in every single day, most of them wouldn't even remember his face. He was Draco to his coworkers, and to everyone else he was just the bloke at Starbucks who handed them their coffee. And it was such a relief every single time.
“You’re an idiot.”
"I'm home!" sounded Hermione's muffled voice.
“Alright,” he said, a bit out of breath. “Okay, so… Right.”
When Harry arrived at the potions classroom that evening, Malfoy was already there. He stood in the dimly lit corridor, leaning against the wall. He looked up when Harry came down the stairs.
Draco stood up to follow Potter’s friends out. He was still shocked over Pansy’s sudden outburst. He had no idea what she would be like when he talked to her later. Would she be mad at him for bringing her? But he couldn’t have known the Weasley girl would be there.
But Potter ignored him and took his arm again so Draco had to follow into the small empty room, an extra space meant for group work. There was a circular table with chairs around it in there, some shelves with a couple of spellbooks, and a window facing the grounds outside. Draco folded his arms and looked impatiently at Potter as he closed the door behind him. He ran a hand through the hopeless mop of hair on his head.
The first breakthrough was his patronus. His evening practices with Potter had turned into a pretty pleasant way of spending time, despite his continuous failure to grasp the spell. They would take breaks and just talk for a bit about different things that were mostly unrelated to the mission and the war, and it was nice. Potter became better at picking up on his sarcasm. Draco became better at not overthinking everything, at allowing his guard down. He supposed it was a good thing. And anyway, he could tell it bothered Potter when he tried to keep him at arm’s distance, and so he didn’t, even though he knew he should.
“Really?” he said. “House Malfoy might have lost its political influence, that’s true, but who do you honestly expect to take its place? House Longbottom? I would say Zabini or Greengrass are both better guesses: Both ancient and noble houses with a rather more significant political history than any of the ancient houses tied to Gryffindor. Both houses are also known blood purists. I can count on two hands how many seats have opened in the Wizengamot now that you’ve flushed out the Death Eaters – one hand, probably, depending on how you define “open”. Soldiers don’t do politics, heroes rarely do politics, which means that outside of wars, they don’t have any power. Has it completely escaped your notice that that the wizarding government is an aristocracy, not a democracy?”
“Thank you,” he said as she slipped past him down the stairs.
It was only when he reached the portrait of the fat lady, that he realized that he was still smiling like an idiot, and quickly wiped the grin off his face. The fat lady was asleep in her frame. He cleared his throat, but she didn’t wake.
Her voice was firm, but her eyes were wide and scared. Harry wished suddenly that they hadn’t left Ron upstairs. He was better at keeping his head than Hermione, and she looked like she was about to panic.
“Sorry about the Gryffindors,” he said.
“Actually, why are we even here?”
“At least Parkinson refused the offer.”
The names of the dead prisoners were made public shortly after. Draco felt he had known it for a while; he wasn’t surprised. That didn’t change the way the floor seemed to fall away under him when he read it. Knowing didn’t mean it didn’t feel like being stabbed repeatedly in the chest.
He still hadn’t let go.
“Do you mind if I sit?” he asked.
“No.”
Rage flared in Harry’s eyes.
She sighed.
“Are they lost?” someone muttered.
“You actually think I would do that?”
“Hermione, maybe Draco was right,” said Harry.
“I just said that there wasn’t going to be any cooperation,” she said.
“And I’m saving you from starvation, that’s my hard-earned salary you’re putting on your toast there,” said Ron, with a grin snatching the jam out of Harry’s reach.
“No. I would have pulled my child out of school too if that was what their first year was like. Especially the muggleborn.”
“Maybe…” said Dean and turned his attention to the front of the classroom, where professor Binns had just drifted through the wall.
“You don’t know that. Harry doesn’t know that, and he – I don’t deserve him.”
He stopped the pounding immediately. Pansy stood in the doorway, watching him with her arms crossed in front of her.
He got up to find a pen and extracted a piece of parchment from a pile of Hermione’s drafts of articles and petitions. He jotted down the address.
“I’ll head down to the library,” she said and then added to Pansy: “And I think it would be great if you could look at the Prophet’s archives. Pull out everything you can find about Azkaban, I think especially Sirius’ escape and the mass breakout in ’96. Those are the only breakouts I know about and they’re too recent to be in any books yet, but of course practically anything you can find on Azkaban would be helpful. If Malfoy is right, there might not be a lot of literature about the place…”
Harry shrugged.
“Do you think they’ll still use it as a prison?” asked Luna quietly.
Potter straightened up and Draco started and quickly looked away. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter lean back and rest his head against the door behind them. He had his eyes closed and Draco could see his Adam's apple move when he swallowed.
“Why would you
“But we’re not trained aurors.”
“It’s not that simple,” he told her.
“They were Death Eaters!”
“Sounds like a good idea.”
Pansy was right. He was such an idiot.
“Sorry, boys,” said Slughorn. “I got held up after dinner.”
“Right – yes, of course you can. But you’ll need to get permission from Madam Pince, and she’ll be watching you like a hawk while you’re in there and she won’t let you take out more than two, maybe three books, if you’re lucky.”
“I saw you in the Astronomy Tower,” he says finally.
“Why weren’t we?” asked Ginny. “We didn’t even bother to cover our faces.”
Their little circles of silver light moved slowly downwards through the levels, leaving a string of runes behind them. The dementors didn’t come near them, but they were there, in the wide, empty space between the three walls along which the gallery ran; in the cells opposite the patronuses or on the lower levels. Tattered cloaks that moved like shadows over the walls. The faint sound of rattling breaths.
“Yes of course,” she said. “I guess it’s a lot today. I’ll tell them you’re good.”
He reached for his wand – he was far beyond the point where blowing up a door to wake someone up would be a drastic move, and if for some insane reason Madam Pomfrey wasn’t in her quarters, maybe the noise would be loud enough to wake up another teacher, anyone who knew anything about healing spells, and then to hell with all of the secrecy- the door was pulled open and Madam Pomfrey, wrapped in her dressing gown, blinked up at him with sleep-drunk eyes.
Part of him is itching to go. He can feel Ron and Hermione getting restless too. The longer they wait the more time they have to dwell on all the things they don’t know. They aren’t ready, but they never will be. Harry wears the fake horcrux under his shirt, and it’s a constant reminder that they are already one step behind.
“Harry, will you give me a hand?” asked Hermione.
“You can just say what you think. That’s what I’m trying to do.”
Draco slipped his hand into his pocket, feeling the edge of the envelope.
"I'm working up to it."
“No, if I did I would’ve been a raging alcoholic by now.”
Harry shrugged and looked away.
“Did she tell you something?” said Harry.
“I just have better things to do with my time, okay?”
Harry shook his head.
He slammed the stall door closed behind him and slumped against it. He heaved a deep breath. His heart was still racing and his head was spinning, though he wasn't sure if that was from the beer or the conversation.
“Well, it actually wasn’t all that terrible,” she said. “I found some interesting books. I haven’t found anything really useful yet, but I’m sure I will, I just need a bit more time.”
Harry shrugged.
Malfoy hummed, a small, noncommittal sound.
Malfoy sighed.
“Now is fine, Malfoy.”
"Okay?"
He only needed to get Potter by himself for a few seconds so they could set up a meeting, but there never seemed to be a chance. In one of his more desperate moments, he had considered pulling the detention-trick again, but Potter didn’t want people to find out. A second showy classroom fight and subsequent detention probably wouldn’t lead anyone to draw the right conclusions, but it might still end up pushing Potter away. The last thing Draco wanted was for him to decide that it was too risky and call it off. Draco wasn’t going to fuck it up by calling attention to himself.
Harry stifled a yawn.
He saw Potter’s grip tighten around his wand.
"It was fine," Harry snarled.
“Memories aren’t powerful,” said Malfoy.
“You’re trying to be a Gryffindor! You’re turning your back on your family and on your house just because-“
Draco stared at her. Then he turned to look down the table, making sure he was sitting with the right house. A few of the other Slytherins were staring back. Most were studiously pretending they hadn’t noticed the Gryffindors.
Hermione came down late for breakfast the next morning. Harry and Ron had almost finished and Harry was just pushing his scrambled eggs around on his plate when she sat down next to him.
“I hope you’re serious about the silencing spells, Seamus,” he said.
“I won’t tell anyone.”
Harry pulls away from the kiss, looking down while he gets Draco’s trousers open. He shoves his hand down Draco’s pants and Draco cries out, soft, and curls forward into Harry’s shoulder, hot breaths gusting over Harry’s neck, and Harry’s heart is pounding like crazy, like it’s trying to smash its way through his chest.
It was a reciprocal game of guessing the truth, Harry thought. Because he was lying too. He made jokes, he had invited Malfoy to go flying, defended him in front of the others and joined him in his drinking. He didn’t know if any of that was true either, or if he was just playing along.
“Goodnight, Harry,” she said.” This was nice.”
“I couldn’t stand dealing with them for one more second tonight.”
Malfoy nodded.
“I thought you said you were going to keep your head down. How does that fit with clawing your way back to the top of their stupid hierarchy?”
It was a serpent. He had not been certain that it would be. He thought perhaps he had changed too much, but as soon as he saw it, he knew that it was right. He was a Malfoy, he was a Slytherin: of course it was a serpent.
“It doesn’t sound very likely that he’s plotting something against Harry either. The war probably took its toll on him too, it makes sense if he acts a bit different this year.”
He looked up from the letter. Malfoy was staring past him, frowning.
“Empty classroom in the west wing, fourth floor, tonight.”
Ron didn’t say anything. It was hard to read the look on his face.
She sounded like she meant it and for a second a small hope flickered in his chest, the thought that there might be a small chance that the headmistress could understand, that perhaps she already knew
“Tonks, please,” Mr Weasley says, putting a hand on her shoulder.
“Cut it out, Malfoy.”
She rifled through the papers on the table, upsetting the order, but Granger didn’t comment.
A few minutes later, Draco left the secret room and headed to the library to study with Hermione Granger.
“Your wand,” he said, handing it over.
He could feel the conversation spiralling out of control, but he was too angry to stop himself. Of course she would have the wrong idea about all of it. This was why they didn’t want people to know, because Pansy was his friend and she still didn’t believe that it could be anything other than a plot on Draco’s part, she hadn’t even for one second considered that he might genuinely like Harry or that it was possible that Harry liked him back. And now he wasn’t even sure if Harry believed it either.
“Oh sure, it’s just my hand,” said Draco. “You’re just holding my hand, nothing weird about that.”
“Well,” Hermione said, “whatever they said, they’re wrong and the wizards are right about this one. All the sensible muggles agree with them.”
They split up. Draco led the way along the gallery followed by Harry, Granger, Lovegood and Longbottom, as they headed for the cells.
"Alright, just-Harry," she said. "Cheers to that."
“And we won’t be able to find out either,” she said.
bothered by Parkinson hooking up with other blokes, because he was
"It's not like
“I don’t care how
"Sorry," Malfoy said quickly, interrupting Harry's train of thought before he could even formulate some sarcastic response. "That was a stupid suggestion. I'll just head back then," he said, already turning away from Harry.
Draco’s feet were heavy. He wasn’t sure he could walk all the way back up. His anger was gone, he just felt cold. Small and cold and scared. He watched his mother’s back. She seemed to walk straighter now than she had on the way down. He did not reach for her hand this time.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. “Even then. I could give you a lesson some time. It looks like you won’t stop being a media darling just because you-know-who is gone.”
Neville cast a quick glance over his shoulder toward Seamus’ bed.
Harry comes of age at the burrow and Dumbledore leaves him the snitch for no apparent reason. The trace is lifted and the last barrier keeping them from going to hunt for horcruxes is gone. Of course, they will stay for the wedding, but then the time is up. One more day.
"Did you actually forget?" she said.
It was the strangest thing. Going to bed like everything was normal, while knowing that three of the five people in the room would only sleep for a few hours, and then they would head out to meet with Luna and Draco and the girls. And they would go to Azkaban. And in five or six hours it would all be over, and they would either be back in their beds at Hogwarts, or in auror custody, on their way to either the Ministry or St. Mungo’s.
“Why are you all letting him sit here after what he did to us?” the kid pointed angrily at Harry.
He dumped the rest of his breakfast into the bin.
He withdrew an envelope from the pocket of his robes and handed it to Draco. Draco took it hesitantly. It had the family crest pressed into the wax seal, so it had to be from his mother, but she must have considered it urgent if she hadn’t just waited for the morning owl post. He broke the seal and pulled out the letter. It was very short. Nott was still lingering around the room, flipping through the library books on his bedside table, when Draco had read through it twice. He read it again. A grey feeling was spreading its tendrils in his chest.
Malfoy didn’t look up, his eyes were fixed on his glass. His tone had gone up just a bit when he asked about it, a little too casual not to sound forced.
He shrugged.
,” he said. “Someone has to go, and currently it’s on our odd little group, because we seem to be the only ones who’ve noticed and we don’t believe there’s a chance of getting someone else, someone more qualified, to listen, but if we could just have reported this to the ministry and be done with it, we would have. I would have done it in a second. I tried to get the headmistress to listen before I even mentioned it to Potter. And if I knew someone else was doing it, I wouldn’t go. And no one says all of us have to either. Pansy isn’t going, and I don’t blame her.”
“I had this idea,” he said, avoiding looking directly at Luna.
Harry tried to interrupt, but she kept talking:
Granger sighed and buried her fingers in her hair.
“I suppose. We sort of had a fight yesterday.”
“When?” demanded Draco.
Harry doesn’t say anything. He remembers that moment in the astronomy tower, when Draco lowered his wand, the rush of relief he felt. And now he feels a stab of burning anger towards Dumbledore, like he hasn’t since he was fifteen – he wanted Draco to get out, of course he did, but not like this. His head is ringing with every single ugly thing Malfoy has ever said about Mrs Weasley or about the Burrow, about Ron's second-hand robes and Mr Weasley’s meagre Ministry position. He wanted him to be safe, he really did, but he doesn’t want him in this house, doesn’t want him to look at this warm, loving place, the last untainted place Harry has left, and make it all seem small.
“That slimy little-“ George is interrupted by Mr Weasley before he can finish:
“It’s just, I’ve sort of become used to doing research on my own,” she said.
Hermione gave Harry a weird look. Ron shrugged.
“No!” Harry screamed.
She shrugged.
“Last I heard was a rumour that they found him dead in Portugal.”
“The Marauder’s Map.”
“Okay,” repeated Harry.
“At least Slughorn said you could spend your detention remaking your potion, so you’ll still have something to turn in,” said Hermione.
“I just need to get my broom,” muttered Harry without looking at him.
That was before the pictures were leaked.
Ron raised an eyebrow.
“We should hurry,” said Harry.
But he could still remember the tingle of Potter’s breath on his face.
. It sounds like just your sort of thing.”
It seemed an odd thing to speak to the snake; it was not a magical creature or even a conjured one, just an apparition of his own magic. But as soon as he spoke, the snake raised its head and watched him attentively.
Malfoy kept looking at him, like he was waiting for Harry to actually say something.
“I know.”
“I thought you had caught on to the fact that I am no longer in a position where I can order my friends around,” he said.
“Not here yet,” said Hermione.
And there it was again – pity. Draco felt anger curling up inside him again, sharp and acidic, like vomit rising in his throat.
“I’m not sure,” he said. “I just think – even if all the dementors were removed, there might be something evil left. Something deeper. Like the walls would still drive people mad.”
Draco took a deep breath. It felt like his heart was trying to climb out his throat.
“No? You have your wand out – are you sure you don’t want to disarm me just to be on the safe side?”
Even if they succeeded somehow, they wouldn’t make it back in time.
“Sure,” said Ginny. “Because that’s what Neville’s worried about – that they’re sleeping.”
“You didn’t know?” he asks.
Ginny narrowed her eyes.
“Yes, what a bloody excellent example, Potter! Bravo, absolutely impressive.”
“Some have,” said Justin.
“That’s cold,” he said.
"Nothing."
It turned out the afternoon Draco and Harry had spent up in the Astronomy tower was going to be the last good weather they would get in a while. The very next day the sky had turned grey again and it was pouring down from the heavy bellies of ominously dark clouds. The students retracted back into the castle and holed up in their common rooms between classes.
Harry sighed inwardly. He was so tired of this. Why was she so stubborn? Why did they all look like they agreed with her?
Somehow it was more painful to hear Malfoy tell it this time. He looked much more uncomfortable than he had during their detention and for a moment Harry regretted having asked so many of his friends to come.
“She also said that she doesn’t like Malfoy very much, because he used to be awful to her, and when I asked her how she felt about Parkinson, she just said “worse”.”
“She lets you into the restricted section and she lets you read the books there – that’s probably more than she allows any other of the other muggleborn students to do.”
Harry slumps back against the wall and buries his fingers in his hair. He is so tired. Draco is watching him and the air still feels fraught between them. Draco still looks like he’s falling apart and Harry thinks he probably is too, except he knows he can’t, and maybe that’s why he tells him.
Matthew grinned.
“I wouldn’t exactly say
"And after?" Harry asked.
They both had their hands on the table, holding on to the edge. Draco was very aware of that one inch of space between their fingers. Potter shifted next to him.
“Fuck!”
Draco’s jaw was working, his hands clenching and unclenching.
“Hi, Harry,” she said airily.
Draco looked surprised at her.
“Hey, is there room in – oh. Never mind.”
Madam Pomfrey looked at her.
And Draco hates Harry because he’s fifteen and that itch, that stupid want and waiting that he hasn’t recognized as anything but bitter hatred before, that itch is rearing its head and he is having dreams too, ugly, dark and shameful dreams, so he milks Harry’s anger for all it’s worth, tormenting him with his craziness. He would rather believe the Dark Lord hasn’t risen anyway.
“Yes. But she is very pretty and she’s really good at quidditch, and people like her a lot because she’s funny and strong and she cares a lot about everyone. She’s very smart too, and all the boys like her. I think it’s very understandable why other girls might be jealous of her.”
“So I’m not mad at you.”
“It was.”
Draco followed Pansy as she made her way towards the Gryffindors.
“Okay. Thank you,” he said.
Draco grimaced.
“What?!” Ginny exclaims when it’s announced over dinner that evening.
There were startled cries from the others when she collapsed.
He took a deep breath.
But Potter just stared at him, wide eyed and dumbfounded.
Harry looked at Hermione. She lay flat on her back, the rise and fall of her chest was quick, but there was no more wheezing. Madam Pomfrey gently put an arm around her and helped her to sit up. The collar of her shirt was soaked. Her skin was glistening – whether from sweat or spells or potions, Harry had no idea – but the burns were gone. Ron came back with the water. He handed it to Madam Pomfrey, who held it to Hermione’s lips.
He was flipping through his textbook when he glanced up and caught Potter staring at him. He raised an eyebrow at him and the other boy immediately turned away. Potter was another problem he would have to find a way to deal with. Draco figured he could work his way back into the respectable hierarchy of the Slytherins in the course of the year one way or another. Blaise wasn’t going to be able to keep up his cold attitude no matter how hard he tried, and though he had never really had much to do with Nott, he might be able to win him over this year. No bonding-over-lost-fathers, of course, but Nott had more family left than Draco did, and he was from a noble and most ancient house with significant political influence, so he could become a powerful ally if they could just overcome the Death Eater associations. In that respect Nott was already doing much better than Draco: even the less than intelligent members of Gryffindor house seemed to be able to distinguish Theodore from Cantankerous, and they weren’t doing nearly as well with Draco and Lucius. However, the difficult part was figuring out how much political influence Potter’s faction had gained. No doubt the houses of Longbottom and Bones would try to use the hero-status of their relatives to grasp at power, but it was unlikely anyone but the heroes themselves would have success. It was all a question of whether or not they would be able to use the power, but Dumbledore’s Army had created soldiers not politicians, so really, it seemed unlikely. They hadn’t been raised like he had…
Draco spat on the floor. His head hurt like hell.
It was rare that all of their little group gathered at once, but a steady stream of information passed between them. They filtered in and out of the secret room at different times. For all of them it had once been routine practice to keep most of their activities secret, to stay under the radar of teachers and remain inconspicuous to other students. It was easy to fall back into old habits. Once, Draco came up there and found a stack of old newspaper articles that had appeared next to his and Granger’s books and notes, and Pansy hadn’t even mentioned it to him.
Harry touched Draco’s arm and he flinched, turning to Harry with a guilty look on his face.
“You owe me,” Potter continued. “I saved your life in the room of requirement.”
“You’re not in a position to doubt her.”
“Fuck you, Potter.”
Draco knew that spell. Or he knew variations of it. There were different wand movements that meant different duration and coverage. The incantation was the same though, and all variations served the same purpose: it was a shield charm against dark curses that would block almost anything short of unforgiveables.
"Just get here. And think of some excuse for why you weren't on time, I do not have the patience for Blaise being sulky about it the whole evening," she said and hung up before he could reply.
They put on their coats and left the pub. There were quick, awkward goodbyes outside, where they both pretended it hadn't been weird. Malfoy thanked Harry for showing up, Harry said it was nice to see him and Malfoy said it back, and Harry wasn’t sure if he might have meant it, but then Malfoy was walking away up the street and Harry was heading back to the underground, and he realized it didn’t matter, because he was never going to talk to him again.
"Harry," Hermione whispered. "Who's here?"
Draco leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms in front of him.
evil. You know what dementors are like – why would anyone use them to guard a prison? People have been sent there for theft, for underage magic, tiny things like that. To be locked up with dementors until they die or go mad. People aren’t supposed to do that to each other. It’s wrong. It’s sick.”
She looped a hand under both Ron's and Harry’s arm and dragged them with her up the stairs.
Of course, when he had daydreamed about it, he hadn't imagined Potter too wasted to walk or unlock the door to his own house. Hadn't added the detail of Potter throwing up in the gutter either.
Ginny looked at her watch.
“Really?”
"Shit," he muttered.
The bloke he had kissed was Malfoy. Draco. And despite how awful that was supposed to be, despite his disagreement with Ron, his shame had drastically diminished. He was just happy in a violent, wonderful, all-encompassing way that made him feel slightly drunk. It felt like a victory, and there was just a second where he was excited to tell his friends about it, before he remembered that he couldn’t.
going to go back to normal!"
He waited for Malfoy to go on, but he didn't. Considering that Malfoy was the one who had asked him to come here, Harry felt like he was carrying more than his weight keeping this conversation going.
"I think I should probably go home," he said.
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
The other girl glanced at Draco, but she didn't let go of her friend.
“Couldn’t think of anything else.”
“What did you lie about?”
“Okay, good. Obviously if you do see Malfoy trying to feed poison to first years you should tell us, just don’t spend all your time stalking him on the Marauder’s Map or anything.”
“I sleep really well in class, though.”
“I’m sorry.”
“Really, you’re asking me that? What do you want me to say? That I think you were a hero for bullying little kids and snitching on those of us who were trying to fight back last year? Because that’s not going to happen.”
“Magical London isn’t that big. So are you living alone or with Weasley or…?”
”But we’re not kids.”
“Yeah, well he’s a sadistic bastard. He doesn’t need a reason to do anything,” growled Harry.
Potter shrugged and they went back to Draco’s desk, where his cauldron was still out and scalpels and leftover ingredients were scattered on the cutting board. He took out his wand and started cleaning up. Potter was leaning on one of the other desks, watching him, and Draco felt a tug at the knot of cramped, nervous happiness in his chest.
“We’re fine,” said Harry, a little way ahead of them.
"Yes, of course," said Malfoy, rolling his eyes. "Why am I even surprised?"
“I’ll go up there with you, Neville,” he said, still grinning.
“His father has disappeared, that’s all I know. I assume he’s fled abroad. Theo lives with his grandparents now.”
It started with the phone call.
“I know. It’s weird.”
Potter smiled vaguely.
“You’re impossible,” she said.
“It went pretty well, I think. I’m not sure…”
“I thought you were all about the Harpies now?”
Potter raised an eyebrow.
sitting at our table and acting all chummy like we’re all the best of friends,” said Blaise.
“Why would I be snogging him if I didn’t like him?”
Draco nodded.
for this. Once, the whole purpose of befriending Harry had been to get the people in this room to give him the attention they were giving him now, to regain their admiration, to prove that they had all been wrong to count him out. It felt good, only not as good as he had thought it would. It wasn’t great, it wasn’t a sweeping sense of redemption, because their approval was no longer the thing he wanted most in the world. They weren’t his friends. Pansy was his friend and so was Harry. And they had already forgiven him.
Potter opened his eyes and turned his head to look at Draco.
“I saw it. I’ve read all her notes too, you know. She can’t be in Ravenclaw for nothing. I’m beginning to hope she’ll actually come up with some genius solution to this all of a sudden.”
But the laugh dies in his chest, never making it out into that dark, quiet house around them.
She started and looked up at him.
Hermione sighed.
“Are you scared?”
you Slytherin? The hat doesn’t give suggestions, it just places you in the house that best fits your abilities.”
There was a general murmur of agreement.
“No thanks, Neville.”
“Yeah, it is.”
“Forget it,” he said. “Let’s go.”
“She’s probably just disappointed that that book she picked up didn’t turn out to be a help with you-know-what after all,” he told him one evening they were on their way down to the Great Hall.
"Did you sleep alright?" she asked. "You look tired."
“Fine.”
Harry reached for his hand, his fingers were icy cold. He squeezed it tightly. It felt like he ought to say something while they were here, these few seconds they had to themselves. It was becoming harder and harder not to think about the fact that they might not both make it through the night.
“Draco, if they knew, there would be aurors running all over the place. Just act normal. Stop freaking out. Come on.”
Pansy shrugged.
He took her arm again and they turned to the steps. They ascended in silence, but he knew they were all thinking the same thing: It had worked.
Malfoy stubbed out his cigarette and looked back at Harry, his expression bored, like he had just been indulging Harry by talking about it. He cocked his head.
Then Draco stepped back, putting the proper distance between them, ignoring the frantic pounding of his heart trying to smash its way through his chest. He forced his face into a grin.
“I’m serious,” he says. “What the hell do you want?”
“It’s been a while since we were really your students, hasn’t it?” said Ginny with a smirk.
Draco straightened his shirt, as if that did any good other than call attention to it.
“Why do you care?” he snapped at her. “You get top marks on everything whether you do the work or not, and it’s not like
“I’m trying to get an internship on the
“I haven’t found anything. Or thought of anything.”
“Bring it back! I need it! Please, please!”
"Alright. I'll head home, then," he said.
Narrow metal stairs were bolted unto the side of the building and rose all the way to the top, where the only entrance to the tower was. It was a long, slow climb to the top, where they were led through a metal door, down a hallway to a small office, where four other aurors were seated around a table in the soft, silvery glow of a crow patronus that was perched on the back of one of the chairs. They were playing cards and only looked up from their game when Belby knocked on the doorframe.
She glanced in his and Pansy’s direction – he supposed they were usually the wrong people.
“Why should we be fair?”
They were all staring at him, except for Pansy who was looking away and probably either choking herself not to laugh or just rolling her eyes painfully hard at his stupidity.
“It’s gonna be really scary being on our own afterwards. Can any of you do laundry magically? How come they haven’t taught us that? I mean, I can stun Death Eaters, sure, but I can’t do my bloody laundry,” said Seamus.
He couldn’t even tell how many dementors were between him and Draco now; his patronus was doing nothing to push them away, it stayed by him and Hermione but Harry could feel his own mind starting to slip; for a second his vision was swallowed by the memory of a bright, green light. He shook his head violently and the dementors swam back into view. Harry aimed his wand at them, his mind empty except for the knowledge that he wasn’t going to lose him, that he was going to get all of them home safely.
Draco doesn’t remember making the decision to kiss him. There’s a glip of terror in his chest when their lips meet and for a second Harry remains frozen. But then his lips move, he kisses him back. His hand buries itself in Draco’s hair, pulling him closer. He finally releases Draco’s arm to reach for his hip instead. Draco takes a step back and Harry follows, the back of Draco’s knees hit the bed and he falls onto the mattress, and Harry follows. He climbs over him, holding himself above Draco, supporting his weight with one hand, while the other runs up Draco’s side as he keeps kissing him, and Draco is clinging to him, desperately wanting him closer. Ragged breaths escape between them, the bed creaks with every movement, springs screaming when Harry shifts his weight to kiss Draco’s neck, his collarbone, and Draco drags him back to his mouth so he can kiss him again, and he keeps running his fingers through that thick mess of hair, again and again. He’s out of breath and half hard, he isn’t sure when that happened. He presses his face into Harry’s neck, breathing heavily, and then he feels Harry’s fingers at his waist, warm hands brushing his skin as Harry pushes his shirt up.
“Shut up, you prick,” said Ginevra, pushing past him.
to see him like this, so why the hell had he decided that
Malfoy shrugged.
“Didn’t you hear him?” he hissed.
“What would he have to say to Harry that might be important?” Ron said. “It could be a trap for all we know.”
“There wasn’t a lot of doubt about which house you belonged to, was there?”
“You’re the only one who’s fighting, mate,” said Ron.
“Hi.”
“You don’t think they’ll try to bring the dementors back?” asked Ginny.
Harry nodded.
Harry stared ahead of him as his tired brain tried to make sense of what Malfoy, Draco fucking Malfoy, was asking him.
“I told you to shut your mouth. You have no idea what went on in Slytherin last year,” she said, standing up.
He was already hearing the words in Mr Weasley’s broken voice:
He took another step down the stairs, the snake moved with him, the dementors surged back. They moved on.
He got to his feet and then extended a hand to Granger to pull her up too.
He didn’t know what to tell them. They were all looking at him as if he had betrayed them, and he realized that was something he had been waiting for – had been dreading for years now. He had imagined it a thousand times, what it would be like when he finally let them down. He had thought it would be over something more inevitable, that when he eventually failed to live up their expectations, it would be because his luck had finally run out and there was some miracle that he couldn’t pull off. This was all just bad decisions. It was something he should have been able to avoid.
"That she was cheating on you?"
It was not a very big sofa. Potter leaned down to untie his shoes.
“Survived.”
Malfoy looked surprised for a second, as if he had momentarily forgotten that this was why Harry was here; that Harry wasn't just hanging out in his apartment. It was odd.
“I thought maybe… you know, just speaking of Ginny, I thought we might start up Dumbledore’s Army again?”
He walked over to them, but Hermione remained absorbed in her paper.
? You want to make this about her?”
“How can you believe that-“
"Our… relationship?" he asked slowly.
“I still don’t know what you want from me,” said Harry.
about it, humouring Draco out of pity.
“Harry, will you pass me the monkshood?” said a soft voice right next to him, and he started.
“I’m not going to France,” Draco says, watching Harry from the doorway as he starts down the stairs.
“Expecto patronum!” cried Malfoy; there was no light, no patronus.
“See you around,” he said with a smirk and slipped away, another Slytherin quickly taking his spot by the table.
"Do you have any idea what that was about? Does the tattoo like… mean something or…?"
Draco didn’t look at the Gryffindor table again, but he had a prickling sense of being watched. He was relieved to get out of there when he and Pansy left after the pudding. He had just relaxed enough to laugh at one of Pansy’s jokes when Granger caught up with them.
“You're nothing to them," he continued. "Being a Malfoy isn’t much to brag about anymore. Are you really so sure you’re still part of that
"Only a little bit. What did you say about the crates?"
“Harry, I-“
“Hi.”
There are four people in there. He can see Mrs Weasley sitting on the couch, Tonks and Mr Weasley stand by the fireplace. Lupin is hovering by one of the armchairs. They all look tired.
Potter opened his eyes, which was sort of spectacular to watch when you were this close to his face. Every time, Draco was a little bit surprised at how green they were.
“Do you think this is a good idea?” he asked.
“I talked to Ron about it, and he said he was really scared of Azkaban when he was little. And his mother told him he was being silly, that there was nothing to be afraid of because he would never go to Azkaban, and then he said something really interesting: He said he hadn’t cared that he wasn’t going there, he’d been scared because it existed, and he’d wanted it to go away. Do you see? That’s exactly what you said: It shouldn’t be allowed to exist. So I thought that maybe kids know about it, the evil, maybe they can even feel it, and the older you get, the better you become at ignoring it.”
“That’s different.”
Ginevra reached out a hand and traced a path on the map.
“I’ll only be gone for a day,” he said.
The flat was tiny. It was basically one room, with the kitchen part sectioned off by a wall with an open doorway and the rest of it doubling as bedroom and living room. There was a book case squeezed awkwardly into one corner, with more books stacked on the floor next to it. There was a messy bed and a dresser in another corner of the room and a tiny, antique looking couch, a coffee table and reading light by the window. It was a very strange flat. It was crammed and worn and not a lot of light came through the window, but it wasn't
That was when he had gone outside to talk to Malfoy.
"Yes, exactly," Malfoy said. "Scottish thing, actually. Something we say up North. Where our school was. Is."
“What are you so nervous about? Nothing’s going to attack us up here,” he said.
“I’m heading to class, does anyone want to come?”
Draco nodded.
“And Draco is back at school now. He’s doing very well.”
"Right. I guess. But if you're meeting your friends that's probably not a good idea."
He shrugged.
“No, of course not. Everybody knows you hate me; they’d assume it was blackmail. I want us to stop hating each other for no reason, just as you suggested.”
Hermione stood up.
“I can’t believe he did that,” said Hermione. “It was completely pointless.”
"Is Hermione home?" he asked.
Draco pushed down the handle and shouldered the door open.
"Alright."
"Yeah. I was supposed to give it to him after the trials, but there wasn’t really a chance, so I just sort of forgot."
“I’ll keep my naps to other subjects.”
It would have been impossible not to feel at least a little hopeful, but Draco was all too familiar with the sluggish process of the Ministry. It was clear that a new prison would have to be established, as well as a new system of imprisonment, but Draco fully expected it to take at least a year before the Ministry would be able to move any prisoners away from the Azkaban tower.
“I know,” he said. “The truce is over, that’s fine. I don’t want you to spend time with me as some sort of charity event. I just wanted to tell you – because it seems the message didn’t sink in the last time – that nothing that happened in that tower mattered, so you can stop acting like you’ll die from shame just from being in the same room as me, because if you don’t, I promise you this is going to be a very long year for both of us. You’re making
“I live in London now.”
Granger sighed.
Potter shrugged.
Harry nodded.
“Because you couldn’t figure out how to use the tube?”
safety. It seems like one patronus for three people might be a bit inadequate.”
Draco saw his wand twitch, but he kept speaking.
, then
!” and Draco’s own wand flew from his grip.
“Right. So you’ll stop bothering my friends?”
“Sure,” said Harry. “Interhouse unity and all that.”
Harry didn’t seem to hear him, so Draco crouched down too, breathing in the acrid scent of burnt hair. Granger’s robes were singed and he could see burns on her hands and wrists as well as around her nose and mouth. A soundless cough shuddered through her. He pointed his wand at her throat, muttering the incantation. He moved to her chest, repeated it. Her breathing became easier.
“We’re just talking,” he said. “I’ve been talking to him.”
“But Harry, that was all the way back in October!” she said, exasperated.
“It’s fine.”
“Where have you been?” asked Tracey eagerly. “I haven’t had a chance to talk to you all day.”
He turned to walk back up the street they had come and unwound his scarf as he went. He turned to check the others had disappeared behind him before he wrapped the scarf around his head so it covered most of his face. So far there had been enough for the
“Before the holidays, you seemed to be improving. In fact, I thought it seemed you were doing… rather well.”
"It's for his own good! You know he needs to get over Adrian. And Draco is kind of his type, right?"
“It’s so
“Can I see it?” Potter asks, nonsensically, and Draco frowns.
They moved as fast as they could along the galleries of the fifth floor and then the sixth. The voices of people shouting curses became clearer, the light of the spells continued to flash like lightning above them, but Hermione wasn’t breathing right and each step seemed to cause her agony, so by the time they reached the second floor from the top, they had once again slowed almost to a walk. She heaved in gasps of air and then coughed hard, buckling over and clinging to Harry to stay upright.
"Hey, Malfoy…" he slurred.
The stag turned its head to look at them – there was nothing for it to protect them from, so it just stood there, emanating soft light and gentle warmth and a calm sense of rightness and safety and happiness.
But he didn’t say anything. Pansy turned away from him to look out the window again. The anger seemed to have burned out of her and now she just looked sad.
“I don’t know the spell,” he said.
“I’m tired, I’ll go to bed. Goodnight,” he said and headed for the dorms with long, even strides.
“I met with Potter.”
“I’m not shocked, I’m just… surprised. And not because of the muggles, it’s just that you’re… you.”
They fell quiet again.
“I don’t doubt that, but I can borrow books from the restricted section.”
“Have you seen Pansy?” he asked, not even bothering to sound calm or trying to appear like he wasn’t riled up.
“So I’ve heard.”
“We won’t-“ Harry said hurriedly, but McGonagall continued before he could finish:
He put the parchment down and settled himself on the couch, resting his head on his hand and looking expectantly up at Harry.
“The Malfoy thing,” she said, “I think you should drop it. I can tell you’re about to get yourself really worked up about it, and I honestly don’t think there’s anything going on. Nothing serious and nothing that concerns us anyway. If he’s having a fight with his friends, then fine, let him.”
“I’m sorry-“ he began, but Draco cut him off, shaking his head.
Harry leaned towards her.
Draco's fingers tightened around his glass.
“Fine,” he repeated heavily.
“Why not?” asked Ginevra, already sounding accusatory.
Because she isn’t. Not technically. Even if today made it feel like perhaps she still was, or a promise that she would be again. When the war is over. If they both make it.
“Yeah, I did.”
“You think our world is different now, because of you.”
“Here!” exclaimed Lovegood.
He looked down at his essay. It had his name and the date at the top, and a sorry-looking, half finished sentence beneath. He couldn’t remember what he had just read or what he had been meaning to write. He put down his quill.
She was speaking fast and excitedly. She had put the book down in front of them next to her sketches of the dementor’s possible area of influence, pointing to the pages from which she drew her points. To say that they had talked about all of this before was something of an overstatement. He vaguely remembered having glimpsed her sketches, but they definitely hadn’t pursued any of her ideas.
“Hey, Potter,” he calls, and Harry stops with his hand on the door and glances back at him.
“Oh,” she said. “It’s and owl.”
“I’m not,” said Harry.
They made their way up the stairs and Potter released his death grip on Draco to slump against the door instead. Draco looked away and took a deep breath to steady himself.
I’ll come back. So maybe if she doesn’t feel like she has to wait for me, it’ll hurt less if I don’t.”
And even though there ought to be thousands of possible answers to that question, Harry hesitated. The problem was that by meeting here and by their previous agreements, most of the reasons for their enmity had been suspended. His first answer would have been “because we hate each other,” but they were only having this conversation in the first place because the reasonability of that hatred had been called into question. He could have listed some of the terrible things Malfoy had done over the years, but in many of those instances they had been equally awful to each other, and even when they hadn’t, a war had happened since then. Harry wasn’t sure he had actually meant to suggest a truce when he said that things had changed, but the war did seem to have created a chasm between the “before” and “after”, and he wasn’t sure where those two worlds overlapped and where they didn’t.
“I know it’s dangerous, but-“
“What?” she called back.
“That’s what this is,” he said. “You want me to…
“Okay, I’m done,” Malfoy said. “You’ve been looking like you wanted to leave since the second you stepped in here, so I’m not going to keep you any longer."
Blaise showed up surrounded by his usual group of friends – most of whom used to be Draco’s friends, but he hardly even cared anymore. Nott showed up alone. Both of them sent long looks in Draco’s direction; neither of them sat down near him.
“What, the whisky? I figured we needed something stronger than butterbeer.”
"Do you think it'll get passed?"
“It sort of feels like I’ve taken you hostage, doesn’t it?”
"Oh. Yes, it says so on the packet.” Malfoy gazed out the window, looking pensive for a moment. “You know, you should start smoking, Potter. It would make a beautiful headline:
Nott shrugged. He walked with Draco to the door and down the stairs.
“Don’t be silly. They’ve really been worried about you, Draco. My mum would love to talk to you, Narcissa hasn’t written her a lot this summer, she wants to know how the two of you are getting on.”
There were fewer insults thrown at him and no hexes at all – he knew they had not stopped out of pity but because they were satisfied. No one cared much exactly what had happened to him. The important part was that he had been pacified. And Draco didn’t mind being left alone. It allowed him to sleepwalk.
“Don’t know,” he muttered.
“Yes. Is it going badly?”
"I guess it has to be."
Of course of all the students at Hogwarts, Potter was the one who seemed to have missed the note that Draco was to be ignored. Draco noticed he was looking at him in potions, trying to get eye contact. It was a theory oriented lesson, so they didn’t get out of their seats, and Draco didn’t look up from his notes at all until they were dismissed. He was the first one out of the classroom.
Potter didn’t rise to the insult.
And Granger and Lovegood didn’t like each other.
"Something came up, but look-"
was seeking out Malfoy, what exactly he was looking for when he snuck out to meet him. He hated the part of himself that for some reason wanted to see him and there was no desire to examine that want any closer. He can remember every single excuse that went through his head that year, he’s been rehearsing them daily since Malfoy showed up at the Burrow; he had excuses but not a
“Draco, are alright?” Pansy asked.
Harry drags his eyes away from the mark to look at him.
Harry pulled out his wand, hesitating for a moment.
“Can I talk to you for a second?”
Something sweet and viscid swelled in his mouth. He couldn’t swallow it. He couldn’t breathe. He turned over and retched. His eyes were dry and prickly. The acrid smell filled his nostrils. He retched again, his stomach and throat convulsing until he was just spitting out thin threads of bile.
Ron nodded.
The next time Slytherin and Gryffindor had classes together was in Transfiguration. Draco didn’t look in Potter’s direction at all during this lesson, so he didn’t know if he had been staring again, but he still wanted to leave as quickly as possible when it was over. He had already stood up and had his bag over his shoulder when McGonagall called on him.
Draco’s eyes flashed to Potter, who looked terrified, but he was watching Draco, not the creature. Draco felt a rush of anger in the midst of his confusion –
“Again?”
“But I’ll leave you to it then.”
They had history of magic with the Ravenclaws.
She coughed into her sleeve, letting go of Harry to steady herself with a hand against the wall instead. Harry was about to protest when a curse and a scream sounded in close succession from above.
“What did I do now?” asked Draco.
“Sure! Thanks Neville.”
On the third day after they had slept in the secret room, Draco, Pansy Parkinson and Tracey Davies passed Harry in the hallway, and Draco brushed so close by him, their hands touched. Later, Harry found a note in his pocket.
"It's mine, I think."
Draco grimaced.
Draco rolled his eyes - it was like speaking to a troll.
“So he wants to keep it secret,” she said.
“It’s fine, I know where he keeps it. He won’t mind.”
Harry and Ron exchanged glances, but before either of them could say anything, Hermione spoke up again:
Now it was her who interrupted him and her voice was suddenly stern again.
Neville shrugged. There were too many students crowding around the tables with ingredients for them to reach it, so they waited in the back for some of the others to finish up.
Harry didn’t have a chance to protest. They had reached the Great Hall and had to change the subject.
"What?"
Harry slipped out the door and back into bed. If Neville hadn’t been awake he might have taken his Firebolt and gone flying for a bit, that would have calmed him down.
“Do you think maybe we could-“ he began again, but before he could finish his sentence, a mighty crash sounded from above.
There came no reply. Draco reached for the bottle. There was still a bit of brain activity left to kill.
“Sorry for breaking up you and Potter.”
“So if we assume that’s right then it should just be a matter of keeping them in one place and preventing them from feeding on anything within their reach, and then they would just- because see, here,” she flipped to a new page in the book, one of the chapters in verse. “She says here that they become
“Come on,” he says, dragging Harry with him into the nearest classroom.
“What is that supposed to mean? You know, when it had been three weeks since your trial and I
The first drop of rain hit his forehead. Dark spots dotted the ground.
He shook his head.
“And you won’t,” she said. “We can choose how we want to remember people. To me, your father will always be the man he was before the Dark Lord ruined him-“
“No. Well, yes, I suppose you could say that, but not really,” he babbled. “I like talking to you, I honestly do. I thought the feeling was mutual.”
He had been hoping until the last second that he had been wrong. He had really hoped this was about something else.
Harry tried to reconcile the image with the things Hermione had said, with the Malfoy he knew and hated. He wondered if Malfoy was acting – not the drunk part, he couldn’t have faked that, but the likeable parts. The part that had sent him the embarrassing note, the one that told him to leave and didn’t mean it, the one that was afraid to visit his father. Malfoy had admitted it at the pub, that he was using Harry. Harry wondered why he hadn’t just left as soon as he found out. It hadn’t seemed so obvious at the time that that was what he should have done. It still didn’t, really.
“That’s probably not unlikely,” he said.
“We don’t know.”
“I probably would. He’d deserve it too.”
us, could have splinched us completely!"
was the title of the first one. It had a picture of a light switch on it, the switch being flipped up and down and a light bulb going on and off next to it. The next one was
He was not even halfway through his smoke before the door was opened and Irie popped her head out.
“As for scarring, this is dark magic, but I think we got lucky. Your face is going to be fine. I’m sorry to say I can’t promise about your hands. You’ve had a heavy dose of skin replenishing potions and those should do for the worst of it, but your skin will be very sensitive for the next couple of days. There might be a certain numbness too, but you should regain all feeling shortly.”
“I think you or Harry can.”
“What, that she’s mean?” he asked. “Of course she knows.”
“Yes," Malfoy said, taking another deep drag of his cigarette. "You know, I think I liked corruption better back when it was mostly about giving my family special privileges.”
But he doesn’t. And Dumbledore dies. And the world accelerates then, the war gathers momentum around them, and Harry and Draco are both swept up in it. When they see each other again the lines are clearly drawn and they’re back to playing the parts they were supposed to.
“I don’t know,” he said. “I didn’t really know him. Maybe. I miss the grades.”
Potter closed his eyes.
A pleasant shiver surged through Draco’s body.
"I thought that was why you asked."
He saw Potter’s face fall, crumbling like burnt paper while he spoke. He saw disbelief turn to anger. He saw him move and he felt pain exploding through his face as Potter’s knuckles made contact with his jaw. His teeth clamped down hard on his tongue, he staggered backwards, lifted a hand carefully to his chin and felt the warm, rusty taste of blood in his mouth.
Granger crossed her arms in front of her, pulling up her shoulders like she was cold.
“After everything you did, you’re not even ashamed of it?”
“Promise me you won’t let him hurt you. You don’t deserve that no matter what his friends think of you. And he isn’t worth it no matter how famous he is.”
break?"
He reached behind him for the door handle, turned it, and hurried out and away down the corridor as fast as he could.
“Shit…” breathed Draco.
Harry made a noncommittal noise and shovelled some more bacon into his mouth. He kind of wished he had gotten to eat his breakfast before Ron decided to interrogate him. He felt fine now, but truth was there was a lot he couldn't actually remember from last night. He wasn't sure when Ron and Hermione had even left. He remembered them being there and then not being there anymore. He remembered Neville leaving and how he had started zoning out from the conversation because he had never really gotten close with the non-Gryffindor DA members the way Dean and Seamus had. Even after all this time, there still seemed to be in-jokes he wasn't getting.
want to hear what you’ve heard,” he said.
“Sorry?” he said, a bit disoriented.
“Why did you do that?”
"I'm fine," he said, reaching for his coat.
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good!”
