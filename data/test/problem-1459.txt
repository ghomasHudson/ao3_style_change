It didn’t even matter that he couldn’t sleep. This place, wherever it was, was warm and safe, not like his cell. Even if Potter knew it was Draco, he wouldn’t exactly have turned him out on the street either, would he? The weasel would have, but then Draco shouldn’t expect any less based on how he’d treated him and the whole weasel clan over the years.
‘What the hell is this?’ A file was shoved directly into his chest and he nearly dropped it as the force of the impact knocked the air out of him. Draco immediately recognised it as his Ministry personnel file. He opened it and on the first page was his basic information and a thankfully updated headshot. It had originally been his Azkaban mugshot, not his finest hour.
“Why?” Although something had shifted between them, he still had a hard time understanding the concept of her trying to help him. He wondered whether she had talked about him with Luna, whether she talked about him at all.
“Nothing, I was just working on the wards. No time to explain. I really need to go now, ok? You’ll be alright here?” It was a stupid question because nothing was going to stop him leaving, but she nodded anyway.
Bracing himself to see one of dozens of horrible memories from his past, Draco was not prepared for the flash of red hair, a blast of brilliant green light, and the distinct voice of a woman shouting, “HARRY!”
“You don’t understand,” Harry said quietly. He had only come here to give him his wand back... he should have kept his mouth shut.
‘Draco,’ Harry said carefully. He walked around the table and pulled him into a hug. ‘I don’t need to pretend to be someone else to go out to dinner with you. I just wanted to be sure it’s something you really want. If you do, then we can go. Is it what you want? I thought you wanted to wait until we could tell Teddy when he gets back from school.’
‘How do you know that? Look at what’s happened! This came back!’ He wrenched the sleeve of his jumper up and shoved the mess of the mark into Harry’s face. ‘Would normal people have this show up if their magic went haywire? NO! Why? Because normal people aren’t stupid enough to get shit like this branded on them in the first place!’ He pretended like the mistakes he made as a teenager didn’t matter anymore, but they did. He was forever aware of how much one bad decision could impact his entire life. He didn’t trust himself not to do that again.
The Granger-Weasleys had already arrived due to Hermione’s excessive punctuality, as had Fred and Angelina, but thankfully the others were even later than Harry and Draco. Teddy and Victoire were chatting and giggling in the corner as Victoire played with Rose.
‘Right.’ Draco had no idea what to say. Harry had gone behind his back yet again. Maybe, if Harry had just asked Draco, he’d have told him. Then again, Draco had never given him much reason to believe he would tell the truth. He’d made such a mess. Still, he thought they’d turned a corner after their last meeting and he’d hoped Harry would have learned from his mistakes by now. Apparently not.
Beneath the stark headline was a picture taken in Diagon Alley. Floating lanterns were lit along the cobbled street and hordes of people crowded in shop doorways and along the pavements, each holding a candle. There were small children on their parents’ shoulders delighted by the twinkling lights, unaware of their significance, and teenagers with tear-streaked faces. Potter’s face loomed above them, looking more regal and far more distinguished than he really was with his head tilted just so and perfectly groomed stubble. There were similar photos taken in the Great Hall at Hogwarts and at the stadium where the Harpies played, the largest quidditch stadium in England, full to bursting. It appeared the whole wizarding world was in mourning for a man Draco wasn’t sure was even dead. Certainly nothing official had made any hint of it.
Draco was twelve the first time he realised he had a crush on Harry Potter. The whole of his first year he had spent in a rage at the audacity of Potter to reject his friendship. He had raged to his friends, his father, his mother, the elves, anyone who would listen, until eventually no one would take any more. It was at that point, when Draco was forced to keep his hurt feelings to himself, that he started to realise what had really happened. Although too young to understand half of the words he parroted from his father, he was astute enough to recognise that he had been rude. If he had only taken the time to calmly explain the situation to Potter, he could have made him understand.
“We’re looking for something dating to around the seventeenth century.” She said as she scanned the first bookcase. “I’m not sure exactly what kind of thing it would be in. It might be something totally unmarked, or it could be hidden in a Dark Arts book. It’s really difficult to say.
‘Are you ok?’ Harry wrapped his arms around him, and Draco nestled into the additional warmth, sliding his arms between Harry’s open coat and the jumper underneath.
‘It’s fine.’ He turned to find Harry standing there was water dripping from the ends of his hair, a bottle of wine in one hand, and two glasses in the other. ‘Did you shower without me?’ He asked him with indignation.
‘He was always going to come back though, wasn’t he? He promised me he’d be here when I came back.’ Teddy’s confidence in Draco was betrayed by the wobble in his voice. Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
By the time they’d folded the pastry six times, Draco was surprisingly tired. Thankfully the pastry needed time to chill before they could do anything with it. For once Draco’s chilled fingers were actually useful. Handling the pastry too much made it too warm which was a greater problem for Harry than Draco.
, maybe we can talk about it when we get home.’ Harry seemed uncertain and his hesitation made him realise how stupid an idea it was in the first place. His gaze dropped to the floor and he tried his best not to show Harry how much it affected him.
‘Yes?’ He called distractedly as he tried to finish the last line. He was always terrible at finding his place when he was reading.
‘Really?’ Teddy’s eyes went wide with interest. Ironic considering he’d only just been telling them how he wasn’t all that interested in quidditch. Still, he’d always found it sweet the way Teddy put Harry on a pedestal. Draco had done the same with his own father at that age, although Harry more than deserved his place.
‘I’m looking forward to seeing what you’ve done with the chateau though. When do we go?’ Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was deliberately avoiding talking about Wood or if he was unaware of how hurt Draco was because of it.
Even though it was freezing cold, Harry felt compelled to stop and take in the sight before him. Malfoy’s weather system was emanating from a small, blue-tinged glass jar set by her feet. She was sitting on a short stool with her guitar in her lap, plucking a twinkling little melody which reminded Harry of hot summer evenings even though it was early November and bitterly cold. Just as Harry edged closer, behind a bush that sheltered him from the harsh wind, the melody changed, and she started to sing.
‘The visions you had during the separation of your magic have your healers believing it may be psychological damage stopping your magic from returning. I’m here to help you discover any underlying issues that might be causing this blockage.’ Smith kept a neutral expression whilst Draco rolled his eyes. He’d heard this a hundred times before and he didn’t believe a word of it.
“Is as useful as a chocolate teapot,” Draco finished for her. “I’m sorry. I didn’t want to imply that I don’t want to help, I do, but I also don’t think Potter would want you to harm yourself trying to help him.”
‘I suppose you think you’re clever then.’ Harry turned away from the door and walked down the landing to their room, so Draco took that as a cue to follow.
That evening, just before they went to bed, Draco added the hair Granger had supplied to the Polyjuice. It fizzed and spluttered, his turning a murky green and Granger’s turning a reddish brown. Polyjuice wasn’t meant to work so well with muggles, that much was obvious.
“I suppose I could slow down a bit. But just know you can’t police what I eat, Potter! It’s not my fault your taste buds are terrible…” He looked at Harry with that haughty expression that used to make Harry want to punch him in the face, but now makes him laugh.
‘I tried, Hermione. I’ve made it four months and nothing’s any different.’ He was frustrated. He’d hoped she’d see the effort he’d gone to and how much it had affected him.
Smith seemed to perk up at this, the sadistic prick. ‘Might be? Did something happen between you?’ Smith lent forward and Draco once again felt trapped. He thought about just telling Smith. After all, he didn’t really have much to lose. It would fill the time and wasn’t he just saying the other day that he could use someone to talk to? Weeks rather. He forgot how long he was asleep.
‘I could get used to that,’ he said when they landed perfectly with Draco’s arms still wrapped around Harry. Unfortunately, he had to let go of him so that they could walk inside, otherwise he would’ve overstayed his welcome.
“Of course, your cousin and I have much to discuss.” Remus smiled and it showed the papery thinness of his skin. Harry glanced at Sirius who was eyeing Remus with concern. Harry had only ever known Remus to look sickly, but he supposed Sirius had more often seen him as a young and, relatively, healthy teenager. Sirius was notably quiet, but Harry hoped that he would open up to Remus in a way that he couldn’t with Harry.
“Why? What have you two done? I should have known the two of you coming here together would mean nothing but trouble…” Harry ran his eyes over the tapestry again. Something was wrong.
“What did it feel like, risking everything for someone who might not appreciate it?” He asks instead.
Draco nods, and ponders the name as he walks toward the exit, suddenly remembering it from History of Magic. Isn’t that where Merlin served as court sorcerer?
“Look who’s back, the filthy half-breed — Oh dear, isn’t this Narcissa’s boy? What a pleasant surprise.”
He’s standing in what looks like a medieval-style bedchamber. The room is in pristine conditions, decorated in red and gold, brightly lit with floating candles. Walking past the ornate wooden dining table and then through another doorway, a large four-poster bed sits at the center of the room, with gold-embroidered red velvet hanging on the sides. There’s a work desk by the windows, which open toward the lake, and the cold winter air seeping through the seams between the delicate glass panes reminds Draco that this is all very much real. He looks around the room in search of any signs of damage from the fire—burnt down walls, destroyed furniture, anything—yet found absolutely none, as if the place was only furnished yesterday.
Harry sighs, not about to lie. He watches as Draco pulls out his wand to dust off the shelves, his grey eyes gleaming at the sight of the volumes. Many of the titles are in ancient runes that Harry can’t even pretend to understand.
“Since when do you listen to the radio?” Potter leans over to examine the parts with curiosity, and Draco gets temporarily distracted by how dangerously close he is that he nearly breaks a wire.
“About Camelot.” The look on the great wizard’s face is the most somber Draco has ever seen. “About Arthur.”
“There might have been, but I can’t remember. I could ask Hermione to find the book again, if you’d like to read it?” Harry offers sheepishly. “Though I don’t think that helps with our current missing portrait case. He must have gone to another portrait of his, right? One of those Chocolate Frog cards, maybe? I don't really see why you'd be so concerned. ”
He lets the letter slip out of his hand onto the table, and buries his face in his palms so as not to die of sheer embarrassment. Merlin, not only has his mother heard about the rumors, she’s
“There’s — something in there.” He struggles for an explanation that wouldn’t sound too suspicious. As he expected, Harry looks perplexed by the ambiguous answer. He huffs impatiently. “There’s a portrait of the creator of the room. His identity has remained hidden all this time and — I need to ask him before I could tell you more about it, or let you come in.”
Realizing that the curses were coming from the portrait of Walburga Black, Draco relaxes a little, smiling wryly.
Wow, I truly did not expect the response the last update got. Thank you guys so much for reading. I love this story too much to really let it go, and I'm so sorry I left for so long. Regardless if you're old or new, welcome (back?), and I'm so thrilled that you're here.
Harry has just finished reading the letter in the living room when he hears Draco calling his name as he practically stomps down the stairs. He turns to find Draco at the bottom of the staircase, holding up a large book titled
As they’re walking back to the main road, Potter finally notices the group of Hufflepuffs still looking at them, and smiles at them tentatively as a greeting. Draco takes the opportunity to insert some distance between them, trying to do some damage control on what would surely become
“Oh, he probably thinks that I’m up to some shady business again. After all, he was right before, so he must believe he’s right this time around, too.” Merlin falls silent, and Draco can’t help rambling on, barely masking the inexplicable anger raging through him with acrid sarcasm.
“Don’t flatter yourselves. The decor has nothing to do with Gryffindor.” Draco scowls. “He said this is what Camelot looked like.”
“Just so you don’t accidentally end up somewhere else, when you come back, remember to require ‘Camelot’,” Merlin adds.
Nothing serious, of course, they are only a group of young Ravenclaws. Draco vaguely recognizes the blond girl leading the group — her parents died in the series of raids on Muggleborns early on in the summer last year. Draco had very little to do with those, having been essentially locked up in the Manor at the time, though that’s not to say he doesn’t feel somewhat responsible for it.
“Alright, so why don’t you tell me what conclusion you would jump to?” He tries to keep the bitterness out of his tone. It doesn't work.
“And you say you’re not suspicious. How convincing, Potter.” He closes his eyes and settles for the truth, suddenly exhausted. “I’m fixing that room. You’ve got a problem with that?”
“Do you not?” He breathes, then swallows hard when he hears the tremble in his own voice, suddenly terrified of what it might give away. He wants to step back, but his limbs don’t seem to be listening to him. It’s not even a question.
“Any plans today?” Potter asks after a long moment of silence. There’s a nervous edge to his voice, and Draco’s brows furrow at that.
Then Draco’s looking closely at the photo, and he begins to realize why he, at least, didn’t notice the photographer. Potter is smiling at him as he hands over a cup of hot chocolate, and as Draco reaches out, their fingers brush for what is definitely longer than necessary. Unlike Potter, his face is not visible in the photo, but he knows for a fact that he was blushing then at the jolt of electricity coursing through his veins, just like he is now at the memory of it.
“No, Potter.” He shakes his head. “If I had to guess, it’ll be along the lines of, ‘former Death Eater using the Saviour to salvage his reputation’ that sort of thing. Some might even say I have you under an Imperius.”
I'm so sorry I left this story the way it was, but I never intended on abandoning it. I still have the entire outline, and hopefully I can finish it in the coming weeks.
Draco feels his cheeks grow warm at the casual use of his first name. They could be on first-name basis now, he remembers, beyond amazed, because who would’ve thought? Although, he's not entirely certain if he's ready to say it out loud. He sits back down on the edge of Potter’s bed, hands twitching awkwardly, suddenly not knowing what to do. He wonders briefly if Potter might go back to sleep.
Harry gives the room another once-over, but finds nothing in particular that seems out of the ordinary. He turns back to observe the now Merlin-less portrait. There’s an empty wooden chair next to a fireplace, and in the back of the room, the open windows look out onto a lake. There’s a wooden door by the windows, but it’s shut.
It’s a little excessive, even for him. But whenever Draco tries to protest, Harry just shrugs and brushes it off with some bollock excuse about inter-house unity, and such. And Draco? Well, let’s just say he didn’t have the heart to argue with him, especially since not getting hexed by screaming girls is rather nice.
“Fine.” Not that he ever thought he could be immune to Potter saying his name like that, but he doesn’t like being proven right. “I won’t.”
“If you really don’t want to go to that it’s fine.” Harry looks a little put out at that. “But I’m sure Molly and Arthur would love to have you there.”
“I know, I just — I dream about it, you know. Sometimes in those dreams you — ” He can’t seem to get the words out, but Draco thinks he knows what he’s trying to say.
If he really thinks about it, it might’ve actually been sixth year, when he was desperately trying to figure out what Draco was up to. While he can now admit that his motives in tracking down Draco then were less clear cut than he had made himself and everyone else believe, his instincts were right in that it was, in fact, tied to Voldemort business, the way much of his life has been.
“Just to make sure it’s nothing serious. You never know what the kids might be up to these days, right, Harry?” Lovegood looks at Potter expectantly, who appears utterly puzzled for a second before a blush creeps onto his cheeks.
“What are you doing for Christmas?” Harry asks him one day while they are sauntering over to Potions. He must say, ever since they became friends, Slughorn has been much nicer to him, which makes Potions much more enjoyable, even with Harry’s unsalvageable brewing skills.
‘What? Why? What’s happening?’ He tried to ask as Harry steered him to the bottom of the stairs and gave him quite a forceful nudge in the small on his back.
“Go!” He said a little too harshly. She swallowed nervously but did as he told her. When the door clicked shut, he dropped the fox on the bed. “What the hell do you think you’re playing at?” He asked it. “I was about to have a very important conversation and I think you knew that full well. What was the point in you showing up here if you can’t even talk? Because you came here for a reason, didn’t you? You know something.”
Sirius looked a bit bemused. “Oh?” It was then that Harry realised he hadn’t lifted the disillusionment charm yet. He pulled his wand out and aimed it at Aspen with great difficulty, as he was zigzagging down the hallway at great speed. While he had his wand out, he pulled his sleeve up and inspected the bite Aspen had given him. It hurt but he was right that it hadn’t drawn blood, so he put his wand away and made a mental note to find some salve later.
“HARRY!!! THERE’S NO HUMMUS LEFT!” Draco shouted from the kitchen. If Harry had a galleon for every time Draco said that…
‘So long as you don’t run off with some toyboy quidditch player.’ It was a low blow, he’d admit that.
‘I’m very sorry about that. I don’t think you have anything to hide but the healer said it might upset the other patients.’ Draco had been studiously avoiding looking at anyone else in the ward since he didn’t want to think about where in the hospital he was. So long as he wasn’t anywhere near the Janus Thickey Ward he supposed he’d be ok.
lived in my house. I know he was there, as in, factually I know it, but I don’t have any specific memories of it. All I remember was the fear. A few days ago, Harry asked me about my wand and I’d completely forgotten he’d taken it from me. I mean, I knew he had, but I’d forgotten that he had it and he used it to defeat
‘I needed some time to myself.’ Harry sat down on the grass next to him and slung an arm over his shoulders. He wanted to push him away, he burned with the desire to get as far away as possible, but he also knew he shouldn’t have been sat outside in the cold for so long, and he probably needed Harry’s body heat – and his warming charms.
He stood before Harry, his face a blank slate. Harry looked him in the eyes, waiting for him to explain what the heck he was doing. Draco couldn’t really explain though, it didn’t make a lot of sense really, it just felt like something he needed to do. The bed was warm when Draco climbed in and he was immensely grateful that Spungen was around. He wondered if he should employ more house elves – the chateau wouldn’t run itself and it was such a large property for Spungen to manage on his own. That wasn’t exactly a priority now, however.
‘Harry sent the cavalry?’ He asked, his voice sounding bored. Hermione whipped around. She was dressed oddly formally for a Saturday afternoon in a pale pink evening dress and dangling diamond earrings far too fancy to have been bought by a Weasley.
‘Let’s go somewhere.’ He suggested. They very rarely went out to dinner, but Draco was feeling brave.
It wasn’t until he’d brought the box into the living room that he realised the whole endeavour had been a waste of time. The decorations were stored under a shrinking charm so that they’d take up less storage space and since Draco couldn’t practice magic, he had no way of actually putting them up. He considered going to buy a tree, but that would involve more floo travel and he wasn’t sure he was up for that either.
Draco looked sideways at Granger who shook her head as if trying to wake herself up. “Okay… go for it,” she said warily.
Inside, the chateau was much as Draco had expected it. The hallway was almost completely white marble with a wide central staircase complete with gilded gold handrails. As he glanced around, the whole place screamed grandeur, but years of neglect had taken its toll. The giant crystal chandelier had fallen from the ceiling at some point, leaving a gaping hole in the ornate ceiling mouldings and a scattering of jewels across the floor that were so dusty they probably wouldn’t even glint should they be exposed to sunlight.
Teddy rushed off upstairs the second they got home – presumably to play with some of his Christmas presents, and Draco flopped bonelessly onto the sofa. He spent a lot of time there these days. He channel surfed for a few minutes but if he was being completely honest he wasn’t really bothered about television, so he ended up pulling out his journal and wrote about how Christmas had been and Harry’s disappearance earlier. Two hours later and no sign of Harry or Teddy, Draco was getting irritable.
“I don’t know if he did. All I’m saying is that was something he mentioned. He didn’t exactly give me his day by day schedule.” She had started pacing the room at some point during his account. If relating what he knew to her hadn’t drained him enough, her pacing surely would.
‘Potter. You need to leave.’ Draco could feel his anxiety building and he was not about to have a breakdown in the middle of work.
“Potter, what are you-” Harry settled with his back against the trees and held an arm out for Draco. The frown disappeared and a beautiful grin spread across Draco’s face, showing off his perfectly straight teeth. Draco glanced sideways at Harry as if asking for permission to move and Harry nodded. Something tight unfurled in Harry’s chest when Draco curled into Harry’s side and rested his head on Harry’s chest. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and sighed when a feeling of peace settled over him. He cast a strong cooling charm over them so that they wouldn’t boil.
‘You need to get me out of here. Please.’ When he opened his eyes again, he found Harry scanning the crowed for the quickest way out. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco was disappointed that Harry hadn’t known in an instant. Surely the auror in him was still trained to find the exit points in any given situation.
‘No. I thought maybe things didn’t sound great, but I didn’t know if that was just normal separation anxiety.’ He warmed his hands against his tea mug and wondered how they were going to deal with everything. He felt like he was waiting for so many things – he was waiting for Teddy to come home to find out what was going on, he was waiting for his magic to come back so that things could get back to normal. What else was he waiting for that he didn’t even realise? What if he waited forever for things that were never coming?
‘Daddy, I don’t think that’s a good idea. Dad prefers simple things. Like that time when I was six and Mipsy knitted those awful socks for him because she said Dobby would have wanted him to have them. He cried, remember?’ Draco shook his head at the fond memory. He’d taken the absolute piss of course.
“Do you think hummus goes with chocolate?” Draco asked him, completely oblivious to what he was doing to Harry.
‘Ok, then what’s going on?’ Harry asked him. He was watching Draco intently with an expression full of concern and Draco wanted so much to hate him for accusing him of an addiction, for betraying his trust and for stealing from him, but he couldn’t because despite all that, he still loved him.
‘Don’t be silly, Ted. You’re not defined by your house; just give it a go and you might surprise yourself.’ Draco watched words appear on the thick parchment in a chicken-scratch hand almost identical to Harry’s – it wasn’t difficult to figure out who it belonged to.
“I’ve never seen anything quite like this…” Granger said with wonder as they approach the deep mahogany door. Even Draco could admit that it was an impressive door. It was goblin-made, back in the days before they got big-headed and only worked with precious metal. The wood was intricately carved with all kinds of ancient pureblood symbolisms – a mixture between standard emblems like swans and bees, and family-specific engravings such as the Malfoy family crest. Draco read the words
It wasn’t the same now though. He supposed much of that feeling must’ve come from knowing Harry was here waiting for him. The house hadn’t been enveloped in magic long enough to be quite as sentient as the manor or the Black estate, but Draco thought he could feel a little something from the wards, as if they were happy to see him again. After all, he helped create them.
“You mean, you haven’t thought about this already? Are you serious? You’re supposed to be doing all of this
‘Yeah, would you have come otherwise?’ They both seemed keen to know and if Draco was honest, he’d had enough of his friends prying in his and Harry’s affairs. They were done, there was nothing more left to be said.
In the few seconds it took Harry to get out of the car after Draco, he was already soaked to the bone. The rain was getting heavier and heavier by the minute. Even though it was a relatively warm day, this was still England, and the rainwater was freezing. When he saw Harry emerge from the passenger’s seat, Draco turned on him.
‘It’s important for him to see you well though. He spent the end of his holiday watching you out cold in a hospital bed. One time, Harry had to take him home because you did that weird, awake but no one’s home thing. Even if he hasn’t told you, he’ll be worrying about you up at Hogwarts.’ Draco hadn’t known that, he hadn’t even thought about it. For once, he thought the Weasel might be right.
‘You should leave it until he comes home,’ Draco said to him. Harry nodded but didn’t look away from the empty treetop. Draco slipped an arm around his waist and rested his chin on his shoulder. ‘You’ve done really well you know. You made it through his first term away.’
Pansy had taken his arrest as an invitation to move in with him and whilst he was grateful for her company, more so than he could ever have anticipated, it also meant he was seeing a lot more of Granger. Granger, according to Pansy, was only around the Manor under the pretext of helping Draco avoid a sentence in Azkaban. Considering she hadn’t explicitly said she was going to do anything of the sort, and there was no reason to suspect he was about to be arrested again, Draco was dubious.
“You look like shit,” Pansy remarked when she saw him for the first time that morning. Her gaze flicked up and down him as she took in his strange new apparel.
With an absent wave of his hand, Harry righted the scattered bottles and fixed Hermione’s foundation, although it was unlikely she’d be back to claim it anytime soon. Then he turned his attention to the fox.
‘Anyway, I just came to see if the rumours about you leaving were true. I want you to know that I don’t agree with it but seeing as I’m not your mother, I won’t argue with you about it anymore.’
She wasn’t looking at him. Instead she was looking at the solitary window on the wall to the right of the tapestry. It had no view except for a large sycamore tree whose branches obscured the streets behind the house. There was nothing but bare twigs now that autumn was paving the way for winter. Still, it gave her something to look at that wasn’t him.
‘Be honest with me,’ he didn’t like the way that sounded. ‘Do you want to be here?’ Draco went cold.
Over dinner of a rich lamb casserole that wasn’t really to Harry’s taste but appealed very much to Sirius’ canine appetites, Sirius told him that Malfoy talked about Harry a lot the last time she came to visit. Harry thought that was strange because whenever he went to Luna’s, Malfoy skulked around in the background and played games with Aspen rather than speak to him. To hear Sirius tell it, it sounded like he and Malfoy had become best friends over the past month. Maybe he should have made a better effort to get along with her, although he was still utterly tongue-tied whenever she entered the room which made it infinitely difficult.
They searched meticulously through the seventeenth-century section. It was like looking for a needle in a haystack but whenever Draco glanced over at Granger and saw the look of determined concentration on her face, he couldn’t help but redouble his efforts.
‘What utter rot.’ Draco rolled his eyes, ‘if I stop calling you Potter everyone will think I’ve gone mad. Besides, who said anything about marrying you?’ He watched as Harry’s face dropped into mock-horror.
Draco glanced over at a picture frame above the fireplace. It had been taken when Teddy was a small baby, before he and Harry had been married. Teddy was squirming in Harry’s arms and wiggling his chubby little fingers at Draco. Mrs Weasley had managed to capture the exact moment Teddy’s hair had changed from his favourite turquoise shade, but he’d had less control over it when he was a baby, and it ended up half white-blond, half jet black. Draco realised that it wasn’t just about him and Harry. Teddy had been, and still was, as much part of their relationship as he or Harry ever were. Draco owed it to Teddy to own up to his mistakes. He’d taken yet another happy family away from a kind hearted little boy who deserved so much more. He shook his head as he made his choice. It was now or never.
‘If you’re back here…does that mean…?’ He looked nervously between Draco and Harry. Somehow, despite everything, this was the hardest question of all. They’d never really agreed on anything, besides the obvious that they’d be damned if they lost each other again. They were still divorced though, and it wouldn’t exactly be wise to change that too soon. Not when everything was so up in the air…
‘They’re funny about that now…parents taking photos of children. Political correctness gone mad and all that. It keeps them safe though. We can always take photos of her before she goes, she loves your camera.’ Draco was overly concerned with the children having photos. It seemed silly, but without parents to dote on them, it would be so easy for their lives to pass them by without them having anything to look back on. Draco didn’t want that.
“What is this about then?” He asked when they were settled with their tea. There was a pause as Granger looked to Pansy, who nodded in encouragement.
Harry had already turned away and gone back to making tea. Draco realised that Harry remembered Draco didn’t drink coffee first thing in the morning because it gave him a caffeine crash too early in the day.
“Yeah, you’re right. You look like you could use a nap.” Sirius threw his head back and barked out a laugh, shoving Harry’s shoulder playfully. His entire faced changed when he laughed like that; he seemed younger, more alive, more like that teenager Harry had seen in Snape’s memories. He would have liked to have known Sirius back then, but he was immensely grateful he was getting to know him now.
His body felt too foreign as he watched Potter stumbling about the kitchen trying to figure out what to do with a fox. Draco took the time to assess the sensations he had been barraged with when he had initially transformed. The almost-extrasensory perception that came with his sharpened sense of smell and vision, the new centre of gravity and crazy agility. It wasn’t exactly an unpleasant feeling, to be a fox, but he also hadn’t yet learned his vulpine personality, and he could feel the fox’s instinct to run vying with his own to stay.
‘Bad one, huh.’ He said. She nodded and smiled at him kindly. She was pretty, if you were into that kind of thing. Long, dark hair and wide, unassuming eyes.
Harry’s hand had stilled in the fox’s fur while he thought, and it didn’t like no longer being centre of attention. It sat up and began whining again. Taking his life in his hands once more, Harry dared to lift the animal up and carry it through the doorway. It hissed and spat at him, clawing at his arms and leaving angry red welts.
‘It’s just gone eleven. I would’ve been here to see you sooner, but I got caught up. One of the Aurors got injured on a raid and I had paperwork up to my ears.’ He should’ve sounded annoyed, but Draco could tell even with his eyes closed by the lilt of his voice, Harry was smiling as he said it. He felt him smooth a loose strand of hair away from Draco’s face. He’d been wearing it longer than he used to, and it was just long enough to hang in his eyes if he didn’t style it.
“I’ve actually never thought about who might’ve created the room. Though I did once think if it might be another Chamber of Secrets, that sort of thing.”
“You’re Merlin.” He shakes his head, trying to process the information, before suddenly realizing that he’s talking to one of the greatest wizards of all time. “I mean,
Before he could even start processing what’s been said, Potter rushes past him up the stairwell, and with a rather loud slam of the door disappears into his room in a whirlwind. Draco leans back against the wall and stares blankly at Potter’s door, unable to quiet the chaotic voices in his head.
he doesn’t say. “Last time I was there, I managed to get several things in the room to transform at the same time, but they stopped responding after a while. Also, the room is technically still undergoing self-repair, so it’s sort of expected that it wouldn’t work quite right. I might give it another try before Christmas. Have you ever heard of self-repair magic, by the way?”
“I, well, overheard Parkinson talking about it with Zabini. She hinted at it, that you—” Potter swallows hard but holds his gaze, his eyes the softest Draco has ever seen, “I could always hear you leaving in the middle of the night.”
Another song is coming up now, a melancholic guitar intro filling the room, and it seems like Potter knows and likes it well.
Draco reaches out and touches the cloak, pinching the silky fabric for a brief moment just to scare the boy under it, before letting it slip through his fingers again. He could picture the face underneath, and it almost makes him laugh.
“Yeah, I think his death was prophesied?” Harry pulls a face at that. “Must say I’m not a huge fan of that.”
“I just — ” There’s a brief, frustrated pause, and Potter runs his fingers through the unruly dark strands on his head, like he’s already regretting what he’s about to say, but can’t seem to stop himself because he simply can’t hold it in anymore.
“Theoretically. I just don’t think that’s really where he went.” Draco shakes his head, frowning as he examines the portrait up close. “He’s young in this portrait, Harry, only a few years older than us. And I’m quite certain that there are no other known portraits of him in his youth in Wizarding Britain.”
To his surprise, the other boy barks out a loud laugh, and he can’t seem to stop his lips from curling upwards into a smile, too.
They walk back together in tense silence, accompanied only by the monotonous taps of their footsteps echoing in the dark and empty hallway. Eventually, Potter follows him through the portrait entrance. And just as he’s heading up the staircase back to his room, he hears Potter blurt out, like it had taken him all this while to muster up the courage—
The rational side of him knows that it could just be Potter being his usual altruistic self, but still that doesn’t make sense. Saving his life and testifying at his trial was the work of his moral integrity and sense of righteousness, but this — this is something different. This is kindness, and Harry Potter has never shown him kindness, nor did he ever have a reason to.
“Draco, listen to me.” He meets his eyes and demands, and Draco’s chest clenches at the way his name rolls off of Potter tongue, soft and sincere, like that’s how he’s always been calling him. “You can’t erase what you’ve done, that’s true, but that doesn’t mean your life has to be defined by it. You are not a bad person—far from it, in fact, so stop punishing yourself for a choice you never made. It’s all over now and you survived. And what’s the point of making it out alive, if you refused to
, when the rest of his home was submerged in darkness and reeked of the rusty scent of blood. He turns to meet Potter’s gaze. It's
Potter noticeably pauses for a brief moment as if there’s something else he wants to say, but then changes his mind and looks away.
Draco laughs at how close that is to what he first believed, and Harry turns to stare at him in surprise.
Staring at the portrait, Harry feels a sense of déjà vu surging through him. It’s as if he’s been in a very similar situation before, but when, exactly?
“Oh, that’s brilliant.” Harry is too busy being genuinely delighted to notice Draco’s slightly pained expression. “Please thank your mum for me.”
He glances up at Potter, whose soft expression speaks encouragement, and something that resembles hope.
His voice is shaking, and it probably comes across as a little too desperate. Panic rises in his chest, filling up his lungs and making him a little dizzy. There’s a heavy lump in his throat and he swallows hard, barely breathing. It takes all of his courage (if he even has any to begin with) to turn around to look at Potter, bracing himself for everything from disbelief to mockery.
Draco hops off the bed and all but runs out the door before he could change his mind. He could only hope that it doesn’t end in utter disaster, although he doubts that it really can at this point. After all, nothing can be worse than almost killing each other, right?
I realize I should probably clarify the housing situation here. The house system is still intact, but the eighth years live together in a separate dorm. They have single rooms and much more freedom around the school since they're all adults.
He had meant it as a joke, of course, but Potter huffs in mock annoyance and gets up, kneels beside his bed to reach for something from underneath. Moments later he’s back on his feet, holding up a bottle of Firewhiskey and waving it in front of Draco.
“So what if I am?” Surprisingly, Potter simply shrugs and takes a sip, before holding out the bottle towards him, grinning. “Are you saying no?”
“Well, Helga was hoping that I’d change my mind and come back someday, so she wanted to keep my residence. I thought that it might as well benefit some students in my absence.”
away from his reach, it pains Draco to even glance at his face when they pass each other by in the halls. Yet despite Draco’s avoidance and silence, he’s still here, following him at three o’clock in the morning like it’s Sixth Year all over again, like he’s afraid that Draco might inevitably tumble down some rabbit hole of dark magic, rendering his sincere testimony before Wizengamot a blatant lie, making him regret the decision to save him.
Over the past week, Merlin has been giving him spells to try out at various objects in the room to test combinations and effects. Just the day before, Draco has gotten the table to respond to a request and transfigure into a chair, though it refuses to turn back.
way better than what Salazar Slytherin decided to leave behind in the castle.” Harry muses, glancing around. “Though this looks more like Gryffindor Tower than anything remotely Slytherin.”
He thinks he’s finally starting to understand why Potter is reacting like this. This self-sacrificing idiot with a saviour complex. Brave, kind, stupid Potter, who always wants to fix everything by himself.
She pulls out a rolled-up newspaper from her robe pocket and tosses it at Draco. He reflexively snatches it out of the air right before it hits him in the face. And just as she says, there on the front page is a photo of them at the counter at Three Broomsticks. He’s momentarily surprised that neither of them noticed someone snapping the shot. After all, both of them are as paranoid as you can get about unwanted attention these days, though for completely different reasons.
“Because — It’s dangerous, alright?” He sighs and mutters a response quietly. The rum burns pleasantly in his stomach and starts to make him feel warm and fuzzy all over.
“Draco!” He hears Lovegood shout first. The older Ravenclaw sprints up to his attackers before they could get the chance to scatter and disappear. Potter is running towards him.
The mention of Granger pulls Draco back into reality. They’re reaching the end of the hall now, the warm glow of the lamps hanging by the portrait entrance comes into view, and his heart sinks involuntarily at the thought of their first proper conversation ending before it’s even started. An unusually impulsive idea occurs to him then, and he gives himself no time to hesitate before blurting it out.
“Once in a while for dinner, when I was a child.” Draco nods pensively. “It’s sort of gloomy, isn’t it? Though that old house-elf did like me, for whatever reason. He used to scare all the other children away but brought me biscuits sometimes, the good ones.”
“Both of you survived the war and are given the opportunity to choose again, so why won’t you take it?”
“Wait, wait, let me get this straight — ” Draco’s almost finished with his rum when Merlin starts talking about a speaking dragon that sees the future. “You worked as a
and leans back against the wall to wait, assuming that Draco would have to have some sort of discussion with the mysterious portrait. What he did not expect was that Draco would come back outside in literal seconds.
Pocketing his wand and snatching the notebook on his bedside table, Draco heads down the spiral staircase. The Eighth Year Common Room is quiet save for the crackling of wood in the fireplace and the howling of the wind coming from the outside. The door swings open with a light push, and he steps into the empty corridor. Eighth-Years are no longer bound to their old curfews, only that they can’t leave the interiors of the castle after dark. At the beginning of the semester, Draco would spend sleepless nights in an alcove in the library, obsessively reading just to get out of his own head. Now, however, he’s found something else to occupy himself.
Pansy’s at his door, her arms crossed over her chest, wand in hand, glaring at him in anger and disbelief.
When Draco scrambles to pull his left sleeve back down it’s already too late. Potter’s staring at his left forearm, at the remnant of the Dark Mark now covered in long, thin scars.
“There aren’t many things I don’t know.” The man who claims to be Merlin smiles mysteriously, “You also look awful like your ancestor. He was in my year. Kind of a prat if you ask me, but rather brilliant at potions.”
Draco raises a quizzical eyebrow. Oh, right. Harry hasn’t had the opportunity to tell him that Molly had already owled him back with an enthusiastic welcome.
Draco had pictured numerous scenarios where this apology would take place, but this surely isn't one of them. The conversations he had drawn up in his head were awkward at best, often forced, and some even hostile and violent, but they were never like this, never
“Sorry, sorry.” Potter jumps up and offers a hand out to him. The gesture abruptly reminds him of a very different day, when they were surrounded by fire instead of ice. Potter looks like he’s realized it too, and Draco can see the overwhelming uncertainty on his face, like he isn’t sure if he should retract his hand. But before he can decide, Draco takes it. He thinks perhaps he always will.
“I see you haven’t changed at all, Potter.” He leans in to whisper in his ear, and tries not to think too much about why the other boy shivers at his touch.
“Kreacher? No bloody way!” The dark-haired boy huffs out a laugh. “He still hates me, always complaining to his old mistress in the portrait.”
“You heard me,” Potter mutters, his jaws tightening, and Draco’s not entirely sure if he wants to punch it or trace his finger over it.
“Oh, come on Malfoy,” Potter glances back up at him and rolls his eyes. “I know you think that I’m following you because I still doubt you, because I suspect that you’re up to no good.”
“The other day, when you asked me why I was following you—” After a long silence, Potter whispers. He’s staring at the longest scar, the one that splits the faded skull in half, looking pained for reasons unknown, glancing back up at him, “I wasn’t lying when I said I was worried.”
“You do intend to keep on repairing this room, don’t you?” Merlin eyes him quizzically, and the dragon in his hand turns to him too.
“Uh, great.” Harry’s eyes widen in surprise before he grins widely, and his eyes glimmer behind those new glasses of his — that
He turns back to the parcel after a moment and picks up one wrapped in red tissue paper. There seems to be a small rectangular box inside, and now he can’t for the life of him figure out what his mother could’ve gotten for Harry. He ponders opening it out of curiosity, but before he could even make a decision, he’s startled by a pair of hands grasping onto his shoulders, so much so that he almost drops the box altogether. He doesn’t have to turn around to know who it is.
Pansy sighs, and for a moment she reminds him of Granger when Potter or Weasley is being exceedingly stupid. “You know, for how much you stare at him, it’s a miracle how much you don’t
“Back when I taught Transfiguration here, yes.” Merlin nods. “Before I left, I turned it into what you know to be the Room of Requirement.”
He doesn’t even need to check the byline to know who could come up with such a disgustingly sensational title.
Potter’s gaze is flickering, and there’s a slight, almost imperceptible tremor in the hand tightly gripping his wand, betraying his thinly veiled nervousness.
Draco freezes, unable to withdraw his arm despite the disapproving voice screaming in his head. He glances at the calloused fingers wrapped tightly around his wrist, and then looks back at Potter expectantly.
“You’re joking. There’s no known portrait of Merlin at Hogwarts. And you can’t possibly be—Those are peasant clothes you’re wearing, and you don’t have a beard.”
Draco feigns a scoff, but takes the bottle from him, drinks, savoring the pleasant burn as the alcohol hits the back of his throat, and listens to the song anyway. The lead singer’s voice is raspy but gentle, strangely comforting in the middle of the night. It’s still a rock song, but not so loud and clamorous as some of the other ones he’s heard. It’s not a bad one, he admits to himself with a shrug. He fails to catch any of the lyrics, though, because he soon gets a little distracted by his former nemesis. Potter’s eyes are closed and his head’s leaned back, exposing his slender neck and his Adam’s apple. He’s singing along to the song softly, appearing more relaxed than Draco has ever seen.
“Potter.” He jumps out of bed and shoves the dark-haired boy still sprawled on top of the covers. “We’re going to be late.”
“Malfoy.” When he opens up the back cover, revealing the components and colorful wires, Potter pokes a finger at him, “You’re not going to break it, right?”
“Which, mind you, includes saving my life.” He cracks a smile, but the look in his eyes soon turns somber. “I was there when Dumbledore died, you know.”
“All these years, I couldn’t stop thinking that maybe if I wasn’t a Malfoy and he wasn’t the Chosen One, we’d probably — get on, you know?”
Harry shakes his head, thinking back on the books that Dudley never cared for. Harry used to read those strange tales at night, and would dream that a magical talking dragon would come take him away from that dreadful cupboard under the stairs.
While the students around them were all genuinely shocked at first, some faculty members raised an occasional eyebrow, it quickly became enough of a norm that no one really bats an eyelash now. Draco has already had a few genuinely entertaining chess matches with Weasley and regularly sits with Granger at the library. Even Pansy, on the rare occasions where she sees him eating lunch by himself, would casually ask where his ‘golden boyfriend’ is, a question to which Draco’s only response is:
The Room of Requirement wasn’t exactly on top of anyone’s list in the rebuilding of Hogwarts over the summer. Draco, however, recently stumbled upon some books on sentient object repairs and transfiguration implementation that made him want to try to fix it. He’s spent every night since Halloween performing combinations of spells at the brick wall, and he’s gotten so far as getting the double door to show up. He can tell that he’s almost there, and it’s an exhilarating feeling.
“But what’s your portrait doing in Gryffindor’s secret room? I thought you were a Slytherin?” Draco frowns. This is all too bizarre.
He turns to look at Harry, who looks perfectly at home sitting at the Slytherin table, chewing on a piece of toast and stealing sips from Draco’s coffee. He wonders if his mother knew then. Though even if she didn’t, she definitely knows now.
taste in music.” Rolling his eyes, Draco drawls sarcastically, “If you can’t tone it down, at least listen to a better station.”
Because Potter should never be able to see through him. Because he should never know that even though Draco didn’t
In the weeks leading up to Christmas holidays, Draco spent his days with Harry tagging along almost wherever he goes.
Draco returns to the room that night slightly earlier than usual, having come straight from the library with all the relevant books and notes he’s collected on the subject.
Merlin’s quiet for a long moment. And when Draco turns to look at the portrait wizard again, he’s staring at him with a frown, as if he’s seeing another person through Draco.
“Why, Potter.” Draco whispers, half stunned and half mesmerized, trying in vain to calm his frantically beating heart, “I’m beginning to think that you secretly care about me.”
“You should hire an interior decorator.” Draco gazes at the family tree tapestry in Regulus’s old room, frowning at the scorched spot where Sirius’ name had been. Harry thinks he really ought to learn to mend that at some point. “This place is in worse shape than the Manor had been last year.”
“Blimey, that’s not at all what Binns told us in History of Magic.” Draco forces himself to stop laughing when his stomach starts to hurt, and clears his throat a few times to recover. “But you must’ve got on with him well enough to become his court sorcerer later, no?”
It’s the last thing Draco sees before he startles awake, drenched in cold sweat. The clock on his bedside table tells him it’s three in the morning. He lies there and inhales deeply, filling his lungs with the familiar air that now smells vaguely of pines and holly from the newly installed Christmas decorations. After a few moments, his breathing finally slows. Even in dreams, the heat makes him feel as if he’s suffocating.
It’s a little cramped under the cloak. They’re close, too close, practically pressed up against each other’s sides, and Harry can feel Draco’s warm breath on his temple. He wonders wildly if in turn, he can hear his thundering heartbeat.
Potter reaches out silently, but his fingers don’t land on or even near the wound. They graze a few smaller, much older scars instead, right over his heart.
“If he’s that concerned he should’ve just left me to rot in Azkaban. But no, he had to play this selfless, forgiving hero and testify, so now he has to keep tabs on me just to make sure I don’t muck it up again and ruin his reputation.”
“Because I’d rather have you throwing hexes at me in the halls than walking by like a ghost.” He sighs, his eyes fluttering close, “because no one deserves to suffer more than they already do.”
“It’s mostly ancient magic. Some of this stuff is definitely not legal.” Draco remarks, sounding amazed. “This could be good.”
to be. And maybe Potter really didn’t know, but he still saved him in the end anyway — yet that might have been the worst part of it all, because it had made Draco
picked out for him. And Draco knows he’d happily sit through a dinner with the Weasleys if it meant having this next to him.
Now that the dust has settled, and the person he’s yearned for is alive and well in front of him, close enough for him to touch yet so far,
But Potter doesn’t. Instead, he sits up and leans back against a bedpost, before running a hand absentmindedly through the bird's nest on his head, making it even worse than it was. Draco does his best to stifle a smile.
“What time is it?” He asked instead. Lyra frowned and pulled the sleeve of her jumper back to look at her watch. It was silver but looked much fancier than the gold one Mr and Mrs Weasley had bought for Ron on his seventeenth birthday.
‘Well aren’t you a little charmer. Let’s get you pampered like the princess you are.’ Daphne led Ella over to the corner where she put her in a fancy pink gown and took her over to the basins to wash her hair. Draco and Harry hovered nearby, but she looked so excited she barely even noticed when they weren’t standing right next to her.
‘Brilliant. I’ll inform Mrs Granger-Weasley of your whereabout then? Although, I doubt she needs me to, considering I found her listening at the door when I arrived.’
Draco rolled his eyes. ‘If you don’t like it, cast a translation charm. Don’t they teach you those in Auror 101?’
“My father used to say,” she interrupted, “that if I wanted to make the right impression, attract the right kind of attention, I should look my best at all times. Because I could never know when someone important might be around.” She said it in monotone, as if she was reeling off a speech she’d heard a million times before.
‘Did you really name this one after my dad?’ He asked the same question every time and always got the same response. At least, he did before Wood worked there.
It was obvious when they reached the danger zone because the stillness of the air was obliterated. Even without his own magic, Draco could feel the waves of pure magic radiating through the corridors.
“Oh.” To Harry’s utter dismay, the car lurched to a stop and died. It was eerily silent besides the sound of the rain hammering at the windows. Harry glanced over at Draco who was white as a sheet and clutching onto the steering wheel for dear life.
by you, and you want to talk about my pyjamas?! Do you have any concept of how serious this is?” Draco is absolutely furious and Harry kicks himself for being so insensitive. He sits precariously on the edge of Draco’s sofa as the pacing is making him feel rather sick. He’s just come off an twelve-hour shift and he came here first rather than going home and showering. This was probably the wrong choice as it would have spared Draco an extra hour or so of worry, especially considering there was absolutely nothing he could do.
‘I’m not being ridiculous, Parkinson.’ Draco snapped. ‘Potter has gone and bloody replaced me! With the female fucking version of me!’ How could Pansy not understand how insulting that was.
‘I don’t want to rock the boat. Did he say something to you?’ Harry looked at him pleadingly and Draco wanted to tell him it was all ok, but he couldn’t because he hadn’t followed his initiative.
‘The garden was always so beautiful,’ Harry said, his voice still thick. His thumb grazed Draco’s lower back gently and it felt as though it was burning through the blue shirt he’d chosen that morning. ‘I couldn’t let it go to waste. It’s still one of my favourite parts of the house. It has you written all over it,’ he said with a dry laugh. Draco thought he must be able to feel his ragged breaths with his hand positioned where it was, but Draco refused to look at him and admit defeat. Harry wasn’t wrong though; the garden was done up with banners and fairy lights which only brought out the vibrancy of the flowers. Someone had scattered beanbags across the lawn and the kids were having a whale of the time trying to jump between them.
Harry shot bolt upright. He was sure he’d just heard someone shouting for him. It was pitch black and he couldn’t remember where he was. He tried to sit up, but a hand shot out from the darkness and pushed him back down. He fought, panic rising in his chest until a lamp flickered on and shed some light on the large room.
‘Little Ella has asked for you every single day.’ Draco’s heart swelled. Ella had been the very first resident in the orphanage, Harry had told him. He’d met the little girl the first time Harry had brought him here and they’d built a strong connection. She was a little ray of sunshine and it made it much easier for Draco to deal with missing Teddy when she was around. Not that anyone could ever compare to his little wolf of course.
Draco can feel it, the almost scorching body heat radiating from the nothingness in front of him. Maybe half a step more, his own body could be pressed right up against his. Potter’s breathing noticeably picks up pace, and it makes Draco want to reach out to touch.
“Um, anyhow.” He’s fidgeting with a loose strand of yarn on his jumper, his gaze flickering everywhere but at him. “Goodnight, Malfoy.”
“Anyhow,” He clears his throat, shifting his focus back to the small black box in his lap, and absentmindedly pushes the sleeves of his uniform shirt up to his elbows, “Almost there.”
"Being who we are, we can’t be friends.” Draco leans back in his chair and looks up at the medieval style chandelier, staring intently at the shadows the flickering flames cast on the ceiling as he feels the alcohol kick in slowly, breaching his defenses. “I should’ve known that from the start. But he—he’s like the sun. Not because of the scar, or the legend, just
They do, however, form some sort of mutual understanding. Potter keeps following him, and Draco stops asking why because he has nothing to hide. Thankfully, Potter usually stays in the hallway minding his own business while Draco works inside. He doesn’t ask him what he’s doing or how far he’s gotten, and never makes mention of wanting to come in. He simply walks with Draco back to their dormitory every time, occasionally making polite small talk before bidding him goodnight, like he’s waiting for Draco to start a real conversation, which Draco fails to do every time. They’re civil with each other for the first in seven years, and it feels so foreign and strange, but also long overdue.
Draco simply shrugs. It’s not like he has anything better to do. Pansy and Blaise tend to go out on what they refuse to call dates on weekends, and he’s not about to subject himself to third-wheeling his friends.
‘Strange feeling huh.’ His voice came out gravelly and Draco wondered how long he’d been stood there watching him.
‘Love, you already have a medal.’ Harry looked at him in confusion for far longer than he should’ve.
Harry kissed him on the cheek. ‘I’m humbled by your generosity as always.’ He said solemnly. Draco was about to use some rather fruitful language to tell him where he could shove his sarcasm when Teddy burst through the door.
Spending the day with Harry meant he hadn’t gone back to the orphanage to see Ella after school. He knew it wasn’t a big deal, but it would be to a child. Ella needed stability, not Draco letting her down.
No longer sporting the abstract colours and loose silhouette of Luna’s wardrobe, Malfoy cut a severe figure. She was sitting sideways on an armchair, her tight, black jean-clad legs draped over one arm. Harry could see she wore very tall and thickly heeled black boots which made her thin legs look even longer, although her top half remained concealed. Over the wing of the armchair he could see she was holding a book one-handed, the pages propped open with her little finger and thumb. The text was tiny and dense, and Harry couldn’t make out any of the words from such a distance.
‘Really? That’s what you got out of this?’ He set the wine down on the table and motioned for Draco to budge up.
‘There’s nothing for it, Draco. It’s him who’s causing it. You won’t get better so long as he’s here.’ Draco was confused. As he looked around, he realised he wasn’t at the clinic at all, he was sitting in Harry’s study, across from the wall of photographs he always loved so much.
Thinking his hopefulness had triggered his imagination, Harry trudged dejectedly up the stairs to his and Draco’s bedroom. Harry hated getting into bed without Draco; it was far too cold and far too big, and he could never sleep properly without having Draco to hold onto or having Draco’s elbow in his back if they went to sleep mad at each other. Harry tried to avoid that, he never wanted to say goodnight with anything other than a whispered
‘What’s going on in here?’ Draco turned back to the doorway to find Harry’s head peeking into the room. Draco’s chest gave an odd flutter and he kicked himself internally for being such a Hufflepuff. They’d been married for heaven’s sake, he wasn’t a lovesick puppy.
Draco’s heart rate skyrocketed; he could hear it thumping in his ears. “What? No, it’s not like that. I-”
“You were the one who said you wanted to learn.” Harry pointed out. After his third attempt, Draco managed to get the car in gear, but by the time he’d done so they were approaching a bend.
“The modern section?” Granger was staring at him with one raised eyebrow. “Seventeenth century, modern?”
Draco knows he has to finish his book organisation before he can let Harry show him the muggle stuff, so he quickly moves through the end of the alphabet. He even allows Harry to help him put the books back on the shelves, although he has to go back over and straighten them up afterwards.
‘Yes, yes. You can pretend you hate each other as much as you like but we’ve all seen you bonding over wizards’ chess and don’t you even try to deny it. Now, where are you taking me for lunch? I’m fucking starving.’
‘I think we just appreciate it more every year.’ Harry shot Draco such a heavy look that it almost knocked the air out of him. He was sure there was so much between them that they’d never really be able to talk about it all, even if they were able to put it into words.
‘I’m very well thank you. Harry said you weren’t feeling well yourself?’ Draco nodded. Harry hadn’t told her the nature of Draco’s illness as they referred to it around here and it worked quite nicely since many of the kids assumed that Draco was among the muggle staff who worked here.
“Well you can’t exactly keep calling him ‘it’ can you?” Malfoy appeared behind him, presumably intrigued by the screeching, and Harry was sure he was about to faint. He had never looked at Malfoy twice during school, but now that they were free of the constraints of Hogwarts houses, she seemed like she was more…her. There was less of that chauvinistic air to her and more calmness. The same confidence, but more of the right kind than the misguided kind.
‘I didn’t want to lie to him. He would’ve found out eventually. I’ve had enough people in my life tell me things on a need to know basis, I wasn’t going to do that to him too.’ Draco understood that but chose not to reply. He didn’t want to relive all time times someone had made a decision for him
He offered Pansy his arm and they strode up the driveway after Blaise who’d already disappeared into the distance. Draco could see that tall conifers had once lined the gravelled path and he thought he might replace them. They weren’t strictly needed with the wards already in place, but they’d look mightily impressive.
‘Draco.’ Kingsley greeted him with a sheepish smile. Draco took a deep breath, but it did nothing to calm him. His stomach was churning, and he was almost certain he was going to throw up his morning potion.
It took him a while to get to the library since it was two floors up from the floo and there had been a delay getting the lifts installed after the surveyor had found the shafts structurally unstable. Draco didn’t have much physical strength anymore and by the time he reached the top of the second staircase he was panting for breath. He ignored the swoop of self-pity his stomach gave.
Draco refused Harry’s offer to stay at the house that weekend. Draco understood that it was hard for either of them to accept that they wouldn’t be seeing Teddy until late December, but his confession didn’t undo the past three years. No, Draco and Harry, however much they still cared for each other, needed to understand themselves before they could go about understanding each other.
Ron glanced down at the chessboard for a split second before saying anything. “Good to see you not looking like a ghost, mate. Sorry I dropped in like that, I didn’t know you weren’t well. The bloody fox was driving me mad though,”
‘I want to talk to him. No one seems to understand that. I don’t want to spend my life keeping everything to myself, but how do people talk about these things? How am I supposed to trust anyone enough to say these things to? I don’t want to be ungrateful, I don’t want him to think I don’t love him but how am I supposed to trust him when he pulls stunts like this? You’d know the answer. You always had an answer. Not always the right one though – I can say that now you can’t clip me around the ear.’ He laughed a hollow laugh which make him cough violently into the cold air.
“No matter Tressy, you are not in trouble. Please, leave us.” Tressy’s large eyes watered, and she wiped her nose on her grubby sleeve. Draco had never once regretted his decision to give the elves clothes. He could rest easier knowing the elves still at the Manor were there because they wanted to be, not because they had to be. She didn’t look as if she wanted to leave, but when one of her friends, Simon, nudged her on the shoulder, she conceded. He was touched by her loyalty.
‘It’s not because of you, if that’s what you think. It’s just because I feel like I can breathe here. This place is my own.’ Harry placed a hand over Draco’s on his face and gave him a sad smile.
Draco tried his best to be present when they went to Kew Gardens. He was conflicted, however, both by the feelings the place now stirred up for him, and by the news Hermione had given them. He tried to put it out of his mind as much as possible as Teddy ran ahead of them – excited to see the plants and flowers. He and Harry walked at a more leisurely pace, hand in hand, and for the first time in a long time they looked like a happy family out on a day trip together. Harry had turned his collar up against the cold as he always did, and Draco was using a lot of will power not to think about how he looked every inch the head auror he used to be. This was a family trip after all.
‘What good would it do? Would telling him everything make me a better person? Would it make it all go away? Would it make him happier to know how broken I am? No, no it wouldn’t. So why the heck would I drag him into it?’ He could feel his temper flaring. He just didn’t want to talk. This guy could win a prize for making a mounting out of a mole hill.
‘I knew you just wanted a house out of me! I should never have agreed to build a potions lab for you, you’re way too spoilt.’ Draco grinned and kissed him gently, trying to keep it Teddy-suitable even though really, he was dying to rip Harry’s clothes off and take him upstairs. He could tell from the way Harry kept drawing him in that he was struggling with the effort too.
‘They only come with half charge, so I guess I’ll have to plug it in. I wonder what difference it makes? Surely they could sell them with a full battery-’ He was cut off when the teacup in Draco’s hand shattered, hot tea splattering all over him.
He was briefly aware of a voice, although it sounded like one long mumble, and he hoped he wasn’t supposed to know what they were saying since it hurt his head too much to think. The pain in his chest didn’t seem to be going away either, much to his dismay. It was the kind of pain that didn’t really hurt that much but caused an ache so deep it seeped into his bones and made him question if there was ever a time when he had lived without it.
‘Sorry!’ He wasn’t really sorry. Harry took the mugs from him so that he could remove the blanket from his head. ‘What did you pick?’ He asked him as he sat down on the sofa. He was glad he’d persuaded him not to buy a leather sofa, it would’ve been far too cold for his arse. He sunk into the dark fabric like it moulded to his body. Which it did, since he’d had the finest charm work done on it.
A few more seconds passed, and the decision only became more agonising. Before his mind had really settled on an option, he was turning the handle and stepping into the room. Being in the room a second time alone made the feeling more obvious. Like most old magical houses, there was latent magic all over the walls in Grimmauld Place. It thrummed in the background to the extent that it became part of the house, unnoticeable to most wizards. What made this room so different was that there was no magic at all. It wasn’t just the stillness of a mostly abandoned room, it was an absence of magic. The room was, not to put too fine a point on it, dead.
‘I think so. I read you stories, don’t I?’ She cracked a small smile and he knew he was getting somewhere.
“What don’t I understand?” Malfoy leant forward, folding his arms on the table, his face softening into an expression that was almost pleasant... for Malfoy. Harry didn’t say anything. For all that Malfoy had gone through during the war, and Harry wouldn’t be the one to deny everyone had lost something, he had no comprehension of how Harry felt to have been so close to having a real family only for it to be ripped away again.
‘Do they need to understand that? Or do you?’ She gave him a pointed look and he didn’t reply. Mainly because he couldn’t answer.
‘He slept with someone. After the incident, and he didn’t tell me about it until I found a paper with the photos in it and showed it to him.’ He admitted. Smith nodded with interest and started writing on a notepad he’d always had during their session but had never used. Draco supposed he was finally getting what he wanted.
‘Don’t you dare ask me about Harry. Harry is off limits, is that understood?’ Smith’s expression didn’t change, but he seemed interested by that response.
‘Don’t you think these are important?’ He handed it to Draco, and he squinted at the label, trying to read it without his glasses.
‘I’ll send my supervisor through now you’re awake, I expect he’ll have a few questions.’ He nodded and turned back to ask the healer how long he was out, but she’d already gone, and he hadn’t even noticed.
‘I can respect that, Draco.’ Harry said gently and Draco nearly fell apart. ‘For the record, I don’t think there’s anything you could do that could make me hate you.’ It didn’t seem to matter what happened, Harry always had the capacity for forgiveness.
He tried to ignore the buzzing in his head as the three of them thumped their way downstairs in a hurry. They didn’t hear anything else until they reached the bottom of the stairs.
‘Don’t be ridiculous. Just look at her.’ He gestured over to where Ella was chattering away with Daphne like they’d known each other for years. The horrible music that made Draco’s stomach sink started blasting and he nearly jumped out of his skin.
‘Not a patch on you.’ Draco replied. ‘But, as much as I would love for you to take me upstairs and fuck me into the mattress all night, I need you to explain what I missed when I was away.’ Away. That was how Draco was going to describe what happened to anyone who asked, because he’d never, not even for a second, thought about not coming back.
Draco frowned. “What do you mean?” It unnerved him seeing Pansy even vaguely emotional. She had always made a particular effort to keep her thoughts and feelings close to her chest. He used to dismiss this as a Slytherin trait, until he realised it was more a form of conditioning.
“Right. So where exactly should we- woah- wa- hm, um,” Harry’s sentence descends into incoherent babbling when he turns to see Malfoy rolling the sleeves of his shirt up. His forearms are as pale as the rest of him but seem indecently powerful. His veins are raised with the warm weather and they run down the length of his arms to where they narrow into delicately thin wrists and long hands.
‘I’m fine darling, I swear I’ll-’ His body swayed a little as the alcohol suddenly hit him like a train. It must’ve been stepping out of the heavy-duty warming charms that did it. Now he understood why he shouldn’t have been drinking.
The door shudders like a new life has been poured into it. And when Draco reaches his right hand to pull at the handle, the door creaks open.
“Did you mean to say magic was persecuted? I read about that in some Muggle storybook when I was a kid, though I thought that stuff was just made up after learning about the history from Binns.”
“That’s right. Where he was apparently a servant for years since magic was —” Draco stops abruptly. “Maybe I shouldn’t be telling you this part without his permission.”
“For Christmas.” He shrugs like it’s obvious, but looks away. “Kreacher might be more inclined to make the place livable and cook some decent food if an actual Black is in the house.”
“Welcome back, Master Draco. Master Draco’s trunk is already in Master Regulus’ old bedroom. Would Master Draco like some tea and biscuits?”
He feels the blanket being abruptly tugged away from him. He shivers a little from the cold and reluctantly opens one eye.
Harry doesn’t seem to think that Draco’s lying. If anything, he appears more intrigued now by the mystery.
. He was convinced that seven years of animosity and hatred was a weight that could never be lifted, but the way Potter’s lips curled upwards seems to suggest otherwise.
Thankfully, Potter doesn’t push. “Ron dropped and broke it when I lent it to him.” He pauses, lowering his gaze. “Want to come with? I thought you might like to — hang out.”
How ironic, Draco thinks. He wonders whether Potter knows that out of every toxic insult they’ve flung at each other, these are the words that haunt his dreams. Except not anymore, perhaps, because it appears that he’s no longer on the receiving end of it.
“That’s just because you’re terrible at finding them.” He scoffs absentmindedly, still too absorbed in his drifting thoughts, “You have to bypass some wards.”
Turning around, he finds Potter standing only a few meters away from him, staring at his feet intently looking torn. Draco soon gets a vague idea of what he’s talking about, but decides to pretend he doesn’t and puts on his usual look of disdain, hoping that the other boy can’t see past it in the dim firelight.
‘Oh!’ Pansy seemed astounded. ‘That’s not the impression he gave me. He spent a good ten minutes talking about how well you were fitting into the department and how fantastic your work is.’ Draco took in her appearance. Her black hair was cropped into a harsh bob cut and despite living in Dubai for the past ten years, she was as deathly pale as she had always been. Pansy’s face wasn’t one that hid her emotions well which meant for a Slytherin she was quite terrible at lying.
‘You’re allowed to be angry at me. Heck, I’d rather you be angry at me than you be as calm as this. Are you sure everything’s ok?’ Draco didn’t know how to take that. Was he supposed to be angry? Did Harry think he was an angry person?
‘You know what I mean,’ Harry glanced at him sideways to make sure he knew Harry was joking, ‘you watch him like he’s a china doll.’ Draco shrugged.
‘I want to make it clear that I have no problem with Head Auror Potter. He has only ever been kind and professional whilst I’ve been here.’ Lies. ‘I have some personal issues I’m currently working through, and I feel it would be best for me to move on. As far as I know, my contract only extended to providing potions expertise and since it doesn’t stipulate any specific hours, I believe I may be called in to consult on an as-and-when basis.’ Draco knew he needn’t have fallen back into professional speech but there was no way he was going to talk about this to the Minister for Magic, however close friends they had once been.
The fox faced the dog and bared his teeth. It was the first time Harry had truly seen Aspen behave like a wild animal and it was rather a shock. It had been easy to see him only as a pet in the few weeks he had been in Harry’s care. They shared a bond now that meant they trusted each other, but Harry could see that Aspen would not accept a dog just because Harry did.
‘Oh god this is such a mess.’ Harry said with a frustrated groan. He rubbed his temples as if staving off a bad headache. Draco knew from experience that Harry was prone to migraines. He always said that it might be some residual magic left from the Horcrux. It would made sense it would accumulate where Harry’s scar was, but Harry refused to see a healer.
He almost laughed when he remembered being too embarrassed to ask his mother what a huckleberry friend was, too proud to admit to not know everything, even as a child. The faint amusement died before it could even reach his face as the freezing temperature dropped further; the dementors were making their rounds again.
He also didn’t want to be a voyeur of that particular departure; he knew how difficult Pansy could make things.
‘It was useful for writing. It’s kind of been abandoned since though.’ He admitted. Harry wandered through the flat, poking at shelves.
‘You are? What for?’ She searched his face as though waiting for him to say something else, he didn’t understand why.
‘I promise you, that the Ministry is more than aware of your allegiances Malfoy, and anyone who wants to question them will answer to me personally.’
‘I vote we eat first and talk later,’ Harry suggested. Draco nodded in agreement. He needed a few minutes to calm down and Teddy didn’t need to be barraged with information the moment he’d stepped through the door. He’d just been at Hogwarts for the first time.
“Don’t call me an idiot, this was your idea!” Harry couldn’t tell if Draco was in a rage or hysterical, but either way it wasn’t good.
Johnny’s confusion had worn off and he clambered over the two of them and started smacking strawberry smelling kisses all over Draco’s face. He wanted to be disgusted, he really did, his father would’ve taken it as the greatest insult ever. He couldn’t though, it was far too cute. Instead, he laughed loudly and let Johnny have his fun.
“You too mate?” Harry asked as if he could talk back. He scratched between Aspen’s ears the way he likes, and the fox’s eyes drooped again. He shoved his nose under Harry’s chin and tried to go back to sleep and Harry was about to let him when there was a pounding on the front door. Harry knew full well Aspen wasn’t asleep, but he refused to budge so Harry had no choice but to go to the door with the fox held against his chest like a newborn.
‘Shit. But marginally less shit than last time.’ He said bluntly. His voice still sounded off, but not quite as bad as it had last time.
‘Ok, but surely a decent healer wouldn’t give out pills without checking their contents first, that’s not just about the money.’ Draco pointed out.
They’d agreed to decorate the house in warm shades throughout. Draco had surprised Harry with this because Harry had assumed he’d want an ultra-modern house full of chrome. Years living in the dark and cold manor had meant Draco wanted the exact opposite. Now that he was back for the first time in three years, he marvelled at the way the bright summer sunshine shone through the hallway. It bounced off the mirror Draco had strategically placed opposite the coats and filled the hall with a warm glow which accentuated the pale-yellow walls. He’d always loved the warmth of this house, something about it always evoked an inner peace he could never achieve anywhere else.
‘You’re such a git! You know that?’ He thumped him on the other arm and secretly hoped he’d be sporting matching bruises.
Harry was asleep on a terribly uncomfortable looking hospital chair. His messy head of hair was resting against Draco’s side, which gave Draco a perfect view of the steady rise and fall of his breathing.
When he arrived, he was surprised to find the room stacked full of boxes. The numerous bookshelves which had once been crammed with thick tomes where now sparse, the photographs on the desk packed away.
‘Oliver? Why, have you seen him?’ Didn’t answer the question – strike one. Draco blinked himself back into the room.
‘It’s me, love. It’s just me.’ Draco could hardly see a thing in the dark. His eyes adjusted just enough to see Harry watching over him. The relief that swept through him was like the first drop of rain after a drought. He pulled Harry towards him with such force they nearly toppled off the sofa they’d fallen asleep on. He kissed him like he was starved. It was hungry and desperate, and he needed it more than he’d needed anything in his life.
“Feeling better?” She asked him when she set down the tea beside him, made exactly how he likes it. “You can read the letter if you are.”
“Having a nice snooze?” He asked, lowering himself down next to Harry gracefully, so close that their shoulders bumped. Draco’s sleeves were still rolled down and fastened at his wrists. He must have been boiling, but Harry understood. He sat perfectly upright, tension thrumming in his muscles, and Harry wished he knew how to get Draco to relax.
Two burly Hit Wizards crashed through the thick mahogany doors just like they had when they’d come to raid the Manor after his father’s arrest. One was built like Vince; tall and broad with a head slightly too small for his body. The other one had long, greasy hair pulled into a ponytail at the nape of his neck. Draco shuddered.
“The thing is Draco, I mean- Malfoy, if you’re brought in again there won’t be much I can do for you. I’m not qualified and what I did to post your bail could have seen me struck off before I was even on. If we want to get Harry back and keep you out of Azkaban, we don’t have any other choice.” She looked scared as she said that, and Draco noticed that Pansy shifted just a little closer to her. He tried to think about how it might feel to see Potter again and he found he couldn’t. Things would be so completely different now. Maybe, Potter would even hate him more for not doing anything to stop him, and if he helped Granger he might end up with even more blood on his hands if something were to go wrong.
His eyelids felt like sandpaper and his head pounded when he woke at seven thirty. It had been a stupid idea to run out into the storm like that right, but he had no way of knowing when the next storm would be. A wave of frustration came over him when he remembered he had probably given himself a fever for nothing. Had he said the incantation wrong? Had he mis-brewed the potion? Had he missed a step altogether?
‘You don’t owe me any such thing.’ He said honestly. He didn’t resent Hermione for trying to make him stay, he understood now why she had thought it so important, and he would never have confronted half of the issues he had if she hadn’t stopped him from running away.
‘It’s fine,’ Draco said coldly. He was only here because he’d tried skipping his mind healer session before and Harry had thrown a hissy fit when an owl had arrived to complain about Draco wasting appointments.
‘I’m sorry, that must’ve been nasty when you woke up. I was there though, so maybe it wasn’t so bad?’ Draco almost nodded to put the matter to rest, but he knew he shouldn’t hide from Harry anymore, not if he wanted things to improve.
‘What the…’ Hermione frowned. Draco was shocked but wouldn’t have thought anything of it if it weren’t for the tingle in his palm. He wiggled his fingers absent-mindedly and the shelf shot back up on the shelf like nothing had happened. They looked at each other with wide eyes.
Draco groaned. ‘Just come here you twat.’ There was another chuckled and the warmth returned to his cheek. He realised that Harry had been peppering his face with kisses. He tried to reach out for him, but Harry wasn’t having any of it. He finally gave in and opened his eyes to find Harry staring at him, propped up on one elbow.
Harry gripped the doorframe as the world shifted sideways. How could these two people have the same face? Was he imagining things? Who was that man in his dreams and what did he want with Harry?
The doors rotated two or three times, or at least, that’s as high as he managed to count before he got confused. “Well, what now?”
He was about to give the wand back when he realised something was off. “Hang on… you still look like you!” He was filled with panic that her Polyjuice had worn off without her noticing, thereby quashing their rescue mission before they’d even started.
She allowed him to watch her for a while. It was strange for the two of them to be content in silence, but he also knew he couldn’t leave Aspen with Ron forever, and each minute he spent here was probably agony for the pair he left at home.
‘Oh come off it, Harry. Do something wild for once. You’re not an auror anymore.’ Draco himself didn’t think it was a great idea, but he was restless any maybe the additional adrenaline would be fun.
Draco swallowed hard. She was really quite menacing when she wanted to be. “If you have no concern for my wellbeing, why does it even matter?”
An hour and a half went by and they found nothing. They barely spoke other than to qualify certain words for each other in some of the Latin passages. Quite a few of them were written in Early Modern English but predominantly they were Latin. Pansy had another tray of tea sent up for them, probably hoping it would speed them up. Not long after that the light started to fade, and Draco lit the lamps in the room so they could keep reading. He was about to give up when suddenly Granger made a triumphant
He stood under the shower unmoving. Shampoo dripped into his eyes and he winced but didn’t do anything about it.
Draco sits cross-legged on the living room rug, back against the sofa, reorganising his books for the fourth time that week. First, he had gone with typical alphabetising, but he didn’t like how uneven the shelves looked with large hardback and smaller paperbacks all at different heights. Then, he went for sorting by colour, which looked absolutely beautiful, but there were so many different shades of white and off-white that it stressed him out and he took them down again. Now he’s going back to alphabetising them but separating the hardbacks from the paperbacks so the different heights can be grouped together.
It was fortuitous that Draco hadn’t managed to lift the wards Harry had set because whilst a shower was a great way to disguise the physical appearance of tears, nothing could disguise the sounds of his sobs. Especially not since he’d left his wand in the bedroom where he’d apparated to.
‘Bitch please, one puppy-eyed look Potter’s way and he was leading me straight to you.’ She said with a smirk.
‘Missed you.’ He said more clearly, his eyes glittering. Draco’s chest ached. It was made so much worse when Teddy’s bright hair turned the exact silvery shade of Draco’s own. He felt like something was trying to claw his heart straight out of his chest.
He flung the main doors open as quickly as he could and gasped in the icy cold air outside. He sounded as though he’d just ran a half marathon despite only having stormed down one floor. He spun around in a circle trying to regain his bearings. He more often than not used his limited floo travel to get in and out of the clinic unnoticed, but he couldn’t handle the floo in his current situation. He was about to cry out in frustration when he spun into something warm and solid. He stumbled backwards but was prevented from going too far. He was vaguely aware of the smell of grapefruit.
‘Alright mate? Sorry, Mr Grinch.’ The Weasel nodded in acknowledgement. His jumper was even worse – two gingerbread people in fighting poses called “ginjas”. Where did they get such crimes against fashion?
‘Everything’s fine. I just take time to process.’ Harry nodded but he didn’t look like he believed him.
‘Don’t worry about Pansy, I’ll talk to her. I’ll leave these in here, but you can look at them any time you want, ok? You don’t have to decide right now. There’s already so much going on.’
He trudged his way to Gringotts anyway. His father told him that the only things goblins hate more than wizards, it’s fear. As he reached the doors of the lopsided old building, he paused, straightened his spine, held his head high, and stepped inside.
‘Alright fine, I’ll floo call once a month.’ She looked at him incredulously and went to argue. ‘No, Hermione. Take what you’re given.’ She huffed at him but thought better of starting an argument.
‘DRACO!’ He barely got a few words out before Harry flung himself at Draco. As best he could since Draco was lying in a bed of course.
One look at the prices and Draco suddenly felt overwhelmed. It was a long time since he’d been anywhere as fancy as this. Once upon a time he’d have waltzed in here like he owned the place, demanding a bottle of the most expensive pinot noir and generally being as obnoxious as possible. He wasn’t like that anymore, and for once he got a glimpse of what it was like to be Harry – to feel like a fish out of water.
For the first few minutes, Draco wasn’t picking up anything untoward. He was even beginning to think all their theories and leads had come to nothing when he felt a pull from an old anti-stasis charm he’d learned from the Black family archives. He felt an odd shift in the wards of the clinic which would’ve been imperceptible to pretty much anyone except himself, who knew what to look for. It was obvious to Draco that someone was keeping something here that they shouldn’t.
‘Thnks.’ He mumbled. He heard Harry turn to leave and he reached out with an arm that felt too heavy and a bit fuzzy. ‘Stay,’ he said. Harry paused, and Draco didn’t dare try to open his eyes.
‘Anyway, as much as I would love to lounge around with you, we really should head to the orphanage. Susan floo called a few minutes ago and said Ella finally slept because she tired herself out, but she’s been throwing a fit since six and still won’t cooperate.’ She was one five-year-old against a team of trained adults, surely she couldn’t overpower all of them.
‘Draco,’ Harry chuckled, ‘we can do whatever you want. No justification necessary.’ He reached for Draco’s hand across the table. They finished their coffee sitting quietly, happy in each other’s company.
“You were expecting Potter to step right out of that Veil and ask you if he’d missed anything.” She said without looking at him.
‘Hot date. You’re so full of shit, Draco.’ She laughed. It was funny seeing Hermione without the kids around because it was like she made the most of the opportunity to swear. ‘Don’t let Ronald hear you say that.’ She shot him a playful look and he rolled his eyes.
If there’s one secret talent Draco has, it’s that he’s learnt his way around a camera. It’s the one and only muggle technology he has taken to like a duck to water. He’s only been dating Harry a few months, and he knows there are plenty of things Harry doesn’t know about him, so he quickly slinks off to get his collection of Margaret Atwoods. A few days previously, she had been doing a book signing near where Harry lived and Draco was too nervous to go on his own, so he asked Harry to come too. It caused a big argument between them because Draco had missed the past three quidditch matches Harry had played and, maybe rightly, Harry felt like he was more supportive of Draco than Draco was of him.
Draco sighed. “Actually Granger, I brought second dosages because I am, in fact, not a total moron.”
‘I’m just so angry. She’s so clever but she still so small. I didn’t buy the building so that I could watch them have their hearts broken.’ Draco felt him sag against him as his anger dissipated.
A week into his overhaul, the first couple of inhabitants began to return to the smaller frames, eager to find out who was present in the chateau once again. Draco found the portraits became the closest human contact he had; they told him all about the history of the chateau and the generations of Malfoys who had lived there. Draco was surprised to discover that most of his paternal ancestors were in fact nothing like his father, and highly disapproved of his actions once Draco told them what had become of their lineage.
‘Yeah, well, I hear he’s very busy with his new girlfriend these days so that’s probably why. Interesting that he hasn’t brought her to meet you though.’ Draco knew he was shit stirring but really, would he be Draco Malfoy if he didn’t? Oh, wait…
‘Of course, Ted.’ Draco said a little nervously. Thankfully, Harry took over and pulled both Draco and Teddy towards him. Draco felt Teddy’s skinny little arm cling onto his waist while Harry’s stronger grip pulled across his shoulders. Draco held onto Teddy tightly and rested his chin on Harry’s shoulder. It was a blatant attempt at seeking comfort and he knew as soon as Teddy had left Harry would go off on one at him, but Draco didn’t care in that moment. This wasn’t how he’d hoped this day would go and if he could tell himself even for a second that they were still a happy family, he’d take it.
.’ Draco cringed as Harry quoted his eleven-year-old self back to him. He was such a snotty kid, he couldn’t even deny it.
He nearly coughed up a lung when he arrived in his flat as he accidently inhaled some floo powder on his way. Typical. He looked around the dingy little rooms and realised for the first time that he’d let himself make a mess of the place. He’d only really been sitting at the table writing most of the time he was here – it didn’t seem important to tidy up.
‘I respect that. And I understand completely. Don’t write him off too soon though. I spoke to him the other day and he seems like he’s ready to move on. He was heartbroken when you gave him that ring back – I would know, I helped him buy it. You need to trust him Draco, he wants you to be happy above all.’
‘Hey, leave that, I have a better idea.’ Harry stood behind him and took the batter and the spoon from Draco’s hands.
‘This is going to sound so big-headed…’ He looked at Harry nervously, not really wanting to say what he was thinking. He knew it would sound bad as soon as he said it aloud. ‘I just- I miss that feeling of having someone think you can do no wrong. You know, when Teddy was little and he looked at you like you were the whole world. Kids trust us blindly, don’t they? They don’t know all the things that happened in the past and even if they did, they wouldn’t understand. They just love you because you’re nice to them.’ It sounded even worse than he thought when he said it out loud.
‘It’ll get better. It always does. You can come by here any time you want, you know. You’re family as much as Harry is whether you two are together or not. I have to say though, it is lovely to see you two together again, you really do bring out the best in each other. He hasn’t been the same without you.’ She smiled at him warmly which only accentuated her rosy cheeks and Draco flushed with embarrassment.
‘Of course. Great idea.’ He croaked. Harry didn’t seem to notice the change in Draco’s mood. He’d been doing so much better at that too.
Her face was right there in front of his, her grey eyes boring into his own. His gaze flitted down to her lips, to the sweet cupid’s bow that was softer than any other feature, and back to her eyes again. Like before a curl fell across her face and he reached out to tuck it behind her ear. Except this time, he didn’t pull his hand away. It was in just the right place for him to cup the side of her face, and when he did, he found her cheek was impossibly soft, which seemed at total odds with the sharpness of her features but somehow also made perfect sense.
“Dear god Draco, are you still an absolute misery?” Pansy flounced into the breakfast room, having been showed in by Tressy, and draped a napkin over her lap dramatically before helping herself to bacon and toast like she owned the place. Draco himself hadn’t managed a single mouthful yet; the cavernous guilt that was eating away at him was quite the appetite suppressant.
‘I’m moving back to London. Permanently.’ She said with a smile. It was a nervous smile, as though she wasn’t sure what he’d say. He pulled her into a tight hug to ease her nervousness and wondered when he’d become such a sap. He felt like he hugged anyone and everyone these days.
And indeed, it’s a luxurious dark green cashmere scarf, made by a wizarding fashion boutique in Paris he vaguely recognizes the name of. Draco wraps it around his neck and buries his nose in the plush wool, breathing in the familiar scent of his mother’s daffodil perfume.
‘Fanks you!’ Johnny said happily, his speech was, interesting, but highly amusing. He dug his plastic spoon in and promptly smushed the yoghurt all over his face.
“I thought you were exactly the right sort, unless there’s something you’d like to tell me?” Harry cocks an eyebrow at Malfoy who looks suitably uncomfortable.
‘That’s fantastic!’ He exclaimed, smiling brightly. Both Pansy and Harry seemed pleased with his reaction, which was good considering he normally reacted very badly to surprises.
‘I’m sorry.’ Harry didn’t release his hold on his hand which was probably a good thing since he really just wanted to bolt.
Harry was dumbfounded. He had no idea how to respond. Lyra slipped passed him and was halfway down the corridor before Harry figured out what to say. He couldn’t believe how calmly she was taking it. He had effectively just told her he wasn’t convinced she was actually a real person and she seemed fine with it – was it even more evidence that it was true? Or did she know something else too?
‘Well now that wasn’t very nice! Come here, I think I need a hug.’ Draco chased him around the kitchen, trying to cover him in flour too, but Harry was way too fast. They both descended into laughter until Harry got hiccups and they had to calm down. They ended up sprawled on the floor, the pancake batter long forgotten.
‘Excuse me,’ Draco knew he’d have to tread carefully here, but there was something off about this. ‘Is there something else I should know? I understand that this case is urgent but foregoing paperwork is another kind of urgency.’ Ever since the war the Ministry had become increasingly tight with its paperwork in an attempt to clamp down on the misuse of resources and corruption.
He took hold of the other half of the button with the hand that wasn’t holding Harry’s a minute before the hour. Just before the clock struck, Harry let go of Draco’s hand and wrapped his arm around his shoulders – Draco guessed he knew that this was going to be difficult for him, although he wasn’t sure he’d be able to keep his hold while they travelled.
He had no idea how long he’d been here, suspended in nothingness. A minute? An hour? A day? Weeks? He doesn’t remember what came before. He doesn’t have the energy to reach into his mind and find out. He doesn’t much care about what his name is or where he came from. He just wants to get out.
‘I think there’s something funny about this place,’ Draco said absently as he scanned the second page. ‘They’ve both been seen at a private healing clinic. Wouldn’t have been unusual but their appointments seem to have been one after the other every single time they’ve been. They’re obviously not regular appointments, which means they’ve made either emergency appointments or one of those on-the-day appointments they’re trialling from the muggle NHS.’ Harry leaned across the desk and looked over his shoulder to read the same passage Draco had just read.
‘I suppose. Are you sure that’s wise?’ Harry shrugged his shoulders and Draco couldn’t be bothered to push the subject. He led Harry up the winding staircase, nodding politely to the numerous portraits of ancestors he’d become acquainted with during the restoration. They eyed Harry curiously, some turning their noses up in disdain, but the majority smirking or nodding their approval. Their reactions had Harry blushing to his roots and Draco absolutely did not find it adorable. He’d have thought Harry would be used to people staring at him by now, but it seemed he would never be accustomed to being an icon.
‘Help me pick out some vials and a storage case?’ He asked Teddy, turning his back to the miserable witch. He had no time for negativite nellies at the minute.
Sirius gave him a sad smile. “Yes, at one time. It was very hard for him, all those years I was in Azkaban. I think he found it difficult to understand how the boy he knew could have done such a terrible thing. I don’t blame him really.”
‘It’s not fair Hermione. He doesn’t get to do this to me. First, he’s parading his dates in front of my face, then he’s putting me to bloody bed and calling the neighbourhood watch!’ He was so confused and frustrated.
Not long after he had met Potter, the Ministry had placed Draco under house arrest after his appeal against his war conviction was rejected. To save himself from going mad in the Manor all day, he had decided to explore some of the more complex magic that wasn’t taught in Hogwarts. Not dark magic of course, but his current fixation was on animagi and, more specifically, how to become one.
He reached for her hands and noticed she was wearing some of the rings she’d worn at that open mic night, the snitch in particular standing out on the index finger of her left hand. He thought that was an unusual choice. He turned her right palm over, the palm that had a tiny freckle between her thumb and her index finger. He’d noticed it that first day he’d gone with Aspen to Luna’s and Lyra had been sitting in the armchair reading a book. When he ran his thumb over the freckle, she closed her hand, trapping his thumb between her palm and fingers. He was still looking down when she leaned in and kissed him. He hadn’t expected it at all, and he almost pulled away, but he caught his reflexes just in time.
After dinner, he allowed himself a half hour to read another one of his muggle romance novels, the ones he absolutely refused to admit he read. Harry used to laugh something terrible when Draco transfigured the covers of his book whilst in company. It was a habit he picked up as a teenager when he began to explore his own ideas and he knew his father wouldn’t approve. It was cowardly, but sometimes Draco wasn’t very good at asserting himself. Hard to believe when he’d been such a loud-mouthed kid.
‘I missed him go to school. I left you on your own. I’m sorry.’ He couldn’t help it. He buried his face in Harry’s neck and let himself cry.
As he opened his mouth to speak, she turned the page and her position shifted slightly. The long sleeve of a thick cable-knit jumper appeared as she changed her grip on the book so that she held it with two hands. Harry was distracted by the tiny freckle he noticed on her right palm, just between her thumb and her index finger. He didn’t realise it was possible to have freckles on one’s palm.
Draco wanted to wait until the mood had lifted somewhat before wading into the thick of the plan with Pansy. So, he went back to his library to research what might have gone wrong with his animagus spell. He had always known that it was complex magic – that was why so few witches and wizards ever managed to successfully transform – but he had really thought he was in with a chance. He’d felt how willing his body had been to shift for crying out loud!
‘Draco what is it?’ Harry crouched low by the side of the bed so that he was at Draco’s eye level and tried to prise away the bedsheets Draco had in a death grip over his face so that Harry could see him properly. Draco might be long and thin, but his strength was not to be underestimated. Harry couldn’t budge them at all.
‘What the hell is your problem? Every time I try and find out what’s going on with you, you start attacking me like I’m some sort of social pariah!’ Harry yelled at him. Oh shit. Draco hadn’t meant to set him off, he always ran his mouth and then couldn’t handle the consequences.
‘Not now Teddy. Go back upstairs.’ Draco couldn’t look at him, his eyes were trained on Harry, watching his every move. He didn’t react to Teddy’s presence at all.
‘You can say no to this if you want to. I don’t want you to feel like I’m putting pressure on you, but I’ve been keeping these in here for a week now and I’m sick of thinking about it.’ He pushed the stack of papers across the desk towards Draco who could just make out the title page without his reading glasses. Honestly, Harry could’ve warned him he’d be reading, then wouldn’t have taken his glasses off.
‘You have an appointment with the magical therapist soon to see how your magic is coming along. As far as your magical core is concerned, it’s still stable but remains weak. I do hope you’ve been taking it easy…’ Draco zoned out once again as she gave him the usual spiel. Every appointment had been exactly the same since he’d been released after the poisoning which nearly killed him.
‘Thank you, Molly. It means a lot to me.’ He told her earnestly. She nodded and stood back up again, breaking their little moment.
‘Nonsense, nonsense. You’ve had far too much to be worrying about to come and visit me. I’ve told you a hundred times to call me Molly, or Mum, if it’s easier.’ She stepped back but kept a tight grip on his arms, looking him up and down. ‘No, no, no, this is terrible. Have you not been feeding yourself? Harry dear, have you not been looking after him? Look at you! You’re as skinny as Harry was back in the day. Honestly, you boys are a disaster without me. Not to worry dear, there’s enough food around here to feed the five thousand!’ She bustled off back to the kitchen, having pinched his cheeks so hard they burned.
‘Wow.’ Harry’s eyes were wide like a child in a sweetshop as he took in the dim room. The décor didn’t fit with the rest of the chateau, as Draco had intended. It was full of slouchy sofas and those silly beany bag things Ron and Hermione’s kids loved. Looking back, he wondered how he’d ever managed to convince himself his relationship with Harry was done. Although he did enjoy the occasional film, it was definitely one of Harry’s interests more than his own. In that moment, he had a dawning realisation of how much he’d built Harry into the renovation without even knowing it.
“O-ok.” They were silent as he tended to the scratches on his arm. He tried to think about everything that had happened in the last twenty-four hours, but he found himself too distracted by his proximity to Malfoy. He kept his eyes firmly on the skin-deep wounds for fear of losing himself in the moment.
‘Because I… You already know so much about me. You know me better than anyone else alive. He thinks whatever it is that’s causing this, whatever it is that’s stopping me from…healing, it’s routed somewhere in my childhood. If that’s true, then maybe it’s just part of who I am. Then maybe I won’t ever get better. I know I can live without magic. I’m living now. It’s just…I won’t be that person anymore. I won’t be the genius potioneer or that pompous arsehole who thought he’d be the best quidditch player ever.’ Harry laughed and he almost lost his nerve. ‘I don’t want you to know who I am without those things because I’m not sure that the person behind it is a good person.’
‘I know what’s causing the magic core issues.’ He said with urgency. He searched Harry’s eyes, begging he would understand this was important enough to disrupt his meeting and important enough to not fight Draco on this one.
‘Teddy, listen to me.’ Harry said gently. Teddy finally eased his vice-like grip on Draco. ‘I’m not going anywhere ok. Nothing will take me away from you. You’ll go to school and I’ll go to work, and when you come back to see me at Christmas it’ll be like I never went anywhere, yeah?’ Draco had to appreciate that there was always something calming about Harry’s presence. At first, Draco had wondered if it was a side effect of Harry’s magic, but eventually he came to realise it was just Harry.
Harry’s eyes flickered to a point just past Draco’s head, but when Draco turned to see what he was looking at, Harry gripped his arm to stop him.
‘Are these memories?’ His head with tilted to one side in confusion and Draco thought it was adorable. He nodded shyly as Harry picked one of the phials out of the box and noticed the label.
‘Wait, Leggy-Blonde it a muggle? How did she not notice when Teddy’s hair randomly changes colour?’ Draco couldn’t help but interject. They were totally off topic, but he needed to know.
‘Do you think this may be part of the reason why you struggle to communicate in your marriage?’ Draco’s heart nearly beat out of his chest.
‘Yes. I know it looks bad, but I just never got around to changing it back. You have to understand, with my family history-’
‘I’m sorry I didn’t come to see you. Have you been ok?’ He rasped. She held up a finger to shush him.
He turned to go back into the kitchen when he noticed a piece of paper sticking out of the hinges of Teddy’s trunk. There was writing all over it, in multiple hands, and it looked like a note that had been passed around during class. He didn’t really have time to read it, but he pocketed it for later. He supposed it was snooping, really, but he hadn’t heard much about any of Teddy’s friends and he was curious. He walked back towards the kitchen and paused when he heard his name. The door had moved slightly since he’d walked out of the room and it wasn’t obvious he was there.
‘There you are!’ He jumped when Harry opened the door to the summer house. ‘You shouldn’t be in here love, your circulation…’
Except Ponytail didn’t take him back to his cell. Instead, he led him back through the corridors that all look the same, back into a part of the Ministry with charmed windows. Draco tried asking what was happening, unwilling to believe that he might actually be allowed to go home, but he got no answers. He wasn’t cuffed again, but nor was he greeted with smiles or apologies when he was taken to a large desk similar to the one he had seen when he arrived.
“Uh, Malfoy,” Harry says as he opens the first of the books. It turns out to be a handwritten manuscript.
Draco wasn’t solely interested in his new estate however. Some days he really didn’t feel like straining his eyes of oil canvases or dealing with yet another boggart in the closet. He also spent time in the flat he was renting, trying out new potions. He decided, despite his growing love for restoration, that if he were ever to get an apothecary up and running, it would specialise solely in mental health. Draco didn’t believe that mental health problems should be dealt with only with pills and potions, he firmly believed in the benefits of a strong support network, mind healers and even simple things like trying to smile and have a positive mental attitude. Because of this, some of his potions had no medicinal properties whatsoever. Some were muscle relaxants or sleep aides, some were herbal concoctions to induce calm or aid sleep. His knowledge of herbology grew in leaps and bounds, not that he hadn’t had an acceptable amount of knowledge to begin with, and it had even led to the occasional exchange of owls with Neville Longbottom, who fully supported Draco’s venture into mental healthcare after his own experiences in the war.
Hermione had been researching? He knew the woman was a formidable researcher but surely, she wouldn’t be able to find that which the healers couldn’t. He didn’t like how casually she dropped the word horcrux into that letter, however brief it might have been.
He didn’t even have the energy to make it to his bed as he stumbled out of the fireplace in his dingy flat. He’d cried away his energy for the day and his eyes were so raw it was painful just to blink. He curled up on the beat up old sofa he’d bought cheap at an auction and pulled the thick woollen throw over himself. Curling into the foetal position as closely and the small sofa would allow, his mind wandered back to the kiss he’d all but attacked Harry with earlier.
‘It’s ok. You’ll learn how to control it better when you’re older. Did it scare you?’ She nodded and sniffled.
What on earth could he give him that meant that much? It needn’t be something expensive, just something that mattered. He looked back at the photo-filled baubles currently displaying generic muggle stock photos and an idea struck him.
Orion looks at Harry over Draco’s shoulder once he’s finally got too tired and dropped the slipper on the floor. “We really should tell Robards that paperclips are the worst portkeys possible. How the heck was I supposed to see it anyway?”
me to take care of him if anything happened. Tonks never even fucking met you.’ Harry spat. Draco was incensed.
‘Monsieur Verne.’ Harry greeted him politely and the gears in Draco’s mind started whirring. Pâtisserie Jules…Monsieur Verne…
‘You’ve been looking after him though, haven’t you?’ Draco had been trying to teach her to watch out for the other children, give them all a sense of camaraderie.
“Oh, I forgot to mention earlier – have you heard of this thing called instant coffee? Granger introduced it to me. It’s like regular coffee, except it dissolves
‘I was thinking. It’d be horrible for you to go to the platform, it’ll be packed full of people and Teddy will probably be very emotional. As far as the public knows, we’re divorcees living completely separate lives and you’re currently in France. Would be a bit of a shitstorm if we suddenly showed up in public together. It’s not quite the same as when he left.’ Draco thought about this. Harry wasn’t wrong, part of his worry had been over how he was going to cope in the crowds, how he was going to stay calm when he was flooded with all the stress he’d been keeping in since Teddy left. It was true, it would be better if he wasn’t there.
‘I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry.’ He whispered into Harry’s neck. Harry, ignoring the mediwitch and just about everyone else on the ward, climbed onto Draco’s hospital bed and pulled him into his arms. Draco heard the curtains around his bed scrape against the railing as they closed around them, and the shutting off of the background noise told him the kind witch had warded them some privacy.
When things were going right, Draco was quite competent and confident. It was only when things went badly…
had been so keen to stay here during the war. Draco shivered and he wasn’t sure if it was the magic of the door or the flash of dark black robes and bright red eyes that swam across his vision.
“Well it looks like that’s a dead end anyway. It’s nice that you wanted to help Cousin Sirius but maybe he’s better off without the werewolf,” Lyra shrugged. Harry balled the letter up in his fist.
“No, wait!” Her touch on his arm was feather light, but it still burned through his skin. “It’s fine, I could use your help.” His heart skipped a beat. Never in a million years would he have expected Malfoy to ask him for help.
‘Was great.’ Draco spat petulantly, and Harry chuckled. Trust Draco to be annoyed that something he’d been looking forward to for months had actually been enjoyable.
‘HOOOOOOME!’ Teddy yelled at the top of his voice as he came charging through to the living room where Draco had been waiting. He was surprised by the volume, Teddy had always been relatively quiet. His hair was already white blond before he even entered the room which filled Draco with warmth.
“It’s mostly chickpeas and garlic,” Harry told him, thinking about the time he’d tried to make hummus with beetroot. It didn’t go down well…
Pansy followed them all the way out of the house and down the long driveway until they were off Malfoy property, where Draco was promptly apparated away. Her indignant shouting rang in his ears and the image of the elves staring mournfully out of the first-floor windows was burned into the back of his mind. Before he could recover from the discomfort of side-along apparition, he was being dragged unceremoniously forward. Trying not to trip over his own feet, he realised the indignity of his situation. He was being escorted through the middle of the Atrium, where both Ministry employees and visitors alike could witness what was happening – and witness they did.
Even the sugar snaps weren’t a distraction for long. Aspen loudly chewed his way through one and a half before he sensed Sirius approaching, at which point he snarled and launched himself across the room.
‘Draco, stop it. How many times do I have to tell you? You don’t have bloody wrinkles. You’re beautiful, ok?’ Draco’s fingertips froze where they were, and he gaped at Harry. He felt his cheeks flame like an awkward teenager being complimented for the first time. When was the last time someone had said something like that to him? He couldn’t even remember.
“I’m sure she doesn’t. She just enjoys a good debate.” Harry hadn’t anticipated just how well Draco and Hermione would get along. It had definitely made things much easier for him that they had, although things were still tense with Ron.
Forty minutes later and Draco had fluffed every cushion and pillow in the house, started cooking a chicken and prepped enough veg to feed the five thousand. And yet Harry and Teddy still weren’t home.
‘Thank you. Send him to the Head Auror’s office as quickly as possible. We’ve no time to lose.’ He was back downstairs in Harry’s office as quickly as the Ministry lifts could take him.
‘Harry no!’ It was as if it all happened in slow motion. Smith withdrew his wand as Draco scrambled towards them. Harry’s hands were reaching out for him, his expression looking stricken. ‘HARRY!’ He slipped through Draco’s fingers as he disapparated.
‘What was her name? Hilary? Teddy hates her by the way.’ Draco knew he was being petty, but he couldn’t help himself.
‘Don’t go.’ Draco’s hand stilled on its way to the floo powder and he turned to Harry who was standing with his hands in his pockets, his green eyes glittering. ‘You’ve travelled a lot today, I don’t want you to hurt yourself.’ Draco scoffed.
