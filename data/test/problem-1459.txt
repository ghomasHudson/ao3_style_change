Squaring his shoulders, Draco glared at Potter.
Harry walks to their bed and kneels on the edge of the mattress, gently kissing Draco on the back of the head.

“But she’s—” he gestured at Emily then dropped his voice. “A Muggle.”
Lily’s shouting has apparently summoned everyone else in the house, because Harry hears the thunder of running feet and Jamie, Al, and Scorpius appear in the doorway.
Harry clears his throat. “We’re
“It’s not you!” Potter insisted. “I swear!”
He deliberately looks at Harry’s chest where, yes, as he had feared, the middle button, right between his pecs is threatening to pop open.
Suddenly Draco’s chin is digging into Harry’s shoulder and he’s snorting at Ron’s note. “I think your ancestors would be a lot more accepting of the things Weasley is insuinting than mine.” Then he gently kisses Harry on the side of the neck.
“You just never noticed because Ron and Hermione are bossier than I am.”
Rolling her eyes, Emily saluted Draco with her coffee and went back to her seat behind the counter. “She would have figured it out,” she said. “That or she would have worried about you overexerting yourself.” Emily let out a little laugh. “Really, I did you a favour.”
come. Even the hot dragon tamer. And they had brought their spouses and children. Every third head seemed to be ginger.
“Help me get you out of your trousers and pants,” Harry instructs, and Draco has never been happier to follow Harry’s lead.
“You’re in love with me,” he says and Harry tries to look anywhere but Draco’s eyes.

“I’m going to shower,” Harry replies.
“When did that start?”
“It’s still rude, Potter,” he says with a big smile. He leans down again and licks Harry’s neck. And it’s not a sexy lick, it’s a big slobbering dog lick.
“Well, I thought you might find some horribly stuffy French place that doesn’t list the prices on the menu and is filled with people who look like my parents.”

“Potter—”
Ron tilts his head in question.
“You both look all fancy,” Seamus says with a little leer. “Did we—”
the hopefulness in his tone, but he’s helpless to stop it.
Scanning the empty room, Hermione noticed an open door. She ran to it, only to be greeted by another empty hallway. She hurried down the hall and found a cracked door and ran in. As soon as she crossed the threshold Bellatrix, who was lying in wait, cast a
Harry flopped his head back and forth at Ron and Hermione. “We just may win this,” he said with a smile. “Now help me up. We need to get down to the gate.”
When Rose ran into the TARDIS, Draco let out a shriek.
She poured the boiling water into some cups and unceremoniously plopped the bags in.
“Ron says the meatballs are as big as your fist?” Harry offers.
“It’s organic,” Luna replies.
Sighing, Draco rolled his eyes. “I can go back through my equations and fix it I’m sure.”
“I cannot marry you,” Draco declared. Prince Voldie looked up in surprise. “I love Harry. I always have. If I must marry you in a few days, please know I will be dead by tomorrow morning.”

Emily and Stella, because they were now
Harry turned on the TV and DVD player and hit play. Immediately a loud pop song and the montage of the life of a nineteen year old came on the screen.
is your solicitor?”
“Draco,” she says softly. “I think you should probably stay. If you’re caught running, it will only make things worse.”
Harry just smiled at him. “Nonsense. We’ll be perfectly safe there. Just because the forest has killed everyone who has entered it, doesn't mean we'll meet the same fate.”
. Harry had promptly ripped up his Floo address and asked his Mind Healer about the issue. Flora had said that as long as Harry didn’t run every decision by his friends then they were probably fine. Hermione'd called it a load of tosh and Ron had laughed until he cried. Which was all to say that his friends were his family and wanted him to be happy and if they could help with the matter, well then they would.
“No fighting at Christmas!” came several voices from across the room.
Harry smiled. It was a smile Draco hadn’t seen before. In the repertoire of Harry Potter smiles, Draco had seen: bemused (when Draco’s mother said something odd), happy (because Stella had remembered his ridiculous coffee order), drunk (the night of the paperwork, Harry had
“Worse people to be,” Harry agrees.
Harry turns to see Lily, her face aghast.
“Why are you here?” Draco groaned.
“Thanks, Draco,” he whispers back. Then he smirks. “Are we going to have sex tonight or…”
"You love me," Draco responds, rolling them so he's on top.
“You’re all grounded forever,” Harry says.
believed him. He was too thankful to question it, really.
Draco smirks and has the fondest look on his face. “If that’s all,” he says. Turning, he starts to walk out the door. “Are you going to join me or not, Potter?” drifts over his shoulder.
Draco’s never been with someone like Harry. He’d fucked his way across half the continent before he and Astoria settled down, but he’d always been with sleek, well dressed people. Harry is the antithesis of all of Draco’s former flings and significant others. He’s unpredictable and inventive and messy and so carefree in his physical contact, and Draco loves every second of it.
“Well,” Emily said, “First, you need to apply for several licenses. I have everything you need
“Harry,” Alicia says, ignoring everyone but Harry. “It’s bad.”
“Am I being mean?” Harry asks. Draco’s eyes have shut sometime during the proceedings, and Draco can’t pinpoint when it happened, but he can
Kissing Harry while they were both undressed was a lot different than kissing while fully dressed. For one, they created a lot more heat.
“Smarts when she smacks you, doesn’t it?” he couldn’t quite keep to himself.
Draco shakes his head and grunts in Harry's general direction.
“Bob,” Harry croons, scratching at the top of the kitten’s head.
“You’ve got too many clothes on,” Draco points out.
“Sorry,'' he said. “I just can’t run the store alone.” When Harry got back to the counter, he walked to Draco and bumped into his shoulder. “We need the Malfoy of
“That’s not why I’m here.” Harry walks away from the door, past the desk, into the far corner where Draco is hiding. He ends up close enough to feel Draco’s warmth.
“Exceeds Expectations for asking a bloke out, Harry,” Draco said and it was the first time Harry felt like he was seeing Harry as
Harry took in Neville, still smiling even whilst soaked from head to toe. Nodding, Harry said, “Yeah, that sounds great actually. I haven’t been back there for an age.”
Emily sighed. “You’re actually right about that,” she said. “I thought there would be more creature-on-creature action, too.”
Draco nods and pulls open a drawer, pulling out a sheet of parchment and a quill. “I’ll need to send my findings to Records to see if they have a match.”
“Hugo!” Ron’s voice drifted in from the kitchen. “Food is for your mouth, not your hair!”
Harry leans down and presses a soft kiss to the small of Draco’s back.
Emily grinned at him and took both straws into her mouth.
Letting out a huff of indignation Hermione repeated, “Fine,” and went to explore her surroundings. She took in the sparse greenery and the sand, taking note of places to trap the mysterious man and where she might be trapped herself. After having looked around twice, she walked back to the edge of the cliff. “Honestly, have you made
“‘S fine,” Emily said. “No guests tomorrow. I can sleep in.”
“But we don’t know where he is!” Ron insisted.
“Now’s not a good time,” Draco whispers back wetly. “I’ll let you know as soon as—”
“It’s a doll that’s been possessed by malevolent spirits,” Malfoy responds.
He does take Harry’s actual question into account and decides their bed is a much better place to be naked.
Predictably, this is when things go pear-shaped.
“Told you we should have left him at home,” Jamie says smugly, making Lily frown.
Wormtail let out a malevolent sound of glee. “Not like this,” he said.
“Of course,” Draco mumbled as he grabbed his leather jacket and walked down the stairs to the street.
“Does
Eating cake had been the furthest thing from Draco’s mind after they had finished dinner, but he’s glad Harry’s remembered it. It will be a nice treat when they’re both sated.
“Leave them alone, Ronald,” Hermione’s voice came from the sitting room. “You’ve done your part and embarrassed Harry enough. Let them figure the rest out on their own.”
With an ashen face, Alecto quickly pulled her wand out of its holster. “Ah, I was mistaken.” She held it out to Harry but Hermione grabbed it. “
“He’s a wizard alien then.”
Draco nodded and started walking towards the performers. He got a few meters away and was knocked unconscious by a non-verbal
“What?” Harry asks.
Harry’s eyes shone as he smiled. “I honestly wouldn’t be surprised at anything,” he said. “But if it’s good enough for you, I’m sure it will be good.”
“Tell me this isn’t going to be like that film you showed me with all the talking.”
,” he said, “there is no one to save you.”
Draco smiles at her. “I will,” he promises. “Take good care of Pansy.”
She blushed a little bit. “Thanks, but now is really not the time, Ronald.” Pacing, she started wringing her hands. “How many guards are at the gate?”
“No, love,” Draco says, gently. “We’ll have to try this again another night. You’re in no state right now.”
Draco reached out and smiled when Emily gave him his tea and the whole bag. He opened it and took a deep breath, taking in the flaky, buttery goodness as Emily made herself comfortable at the foot of Draco’s bed.
would have a niffler as a pet— “it.” He gestures to the little ball of fuzz that has settled back into Scorpius’ arms after being inspected by Draco.
“Walk?” Draco retorted. “I could fly without my broom!” he exclaimed. “You’re alive! I can do
Harry nodded and reached out to grab Draco’s head and pulled him back into a kiss. They kissed, almostly lazily, for long moments before Draco started to fidget.

. Lupin had taken over the title from his lover, Sirius Black, the original Dread Pirate Black. Black and Lupin had retired to an island, to live their lives in peace, leaving Tonks in charge. But Tonks had amassed enough wealth to last her the rest of her life. She told me I could take over as the pirate; we would find a new crew and she would act as my first mate, all the while calling me Black. Because, of course, the name was the most important part. No one would be afraid of the

“That was horrible,” Draco says with a groan. “I can’t believe people find you attractive.”

"Touch yourself," Draco grunts out. "I wanna see—"
Bellatrix cackled as Hermione started to slump to the floor, clutching her hip. Her vision was fading and she whispered, “I'm sorry Father. I have failed you.”
One of the members of the Brute Squad shook his head. “There’s a Londoner still giving us trouble.” Amycus grunted and glared.
But then something makes Draco giggle.
Draco raised his tea cup at her. “Cheers,” he said. “I’m glad you finally got the girl.”
because Weasley, Ron, assured him, “Just the four of us and Harry. Don’t worry.”
Harry was hot and wet around Draco’s finger and so soft inside. Draco curled his finger a little bit and Harry bucked up into his mouth. Draco had never been opposed to a little bit of rougher play, so he moved
There was no answer for a few moments that seemed to stretch forever. Finally, Draco looked back up at Harry.
The knocking continued, but then Potter, always
“I like Scorpius,” she said. “He’s funny. If you and Mr Malfoy get married, Uncle Harry, will he be my cousin?”
“Knew it,” Draco says with relish.
Harry laughed. “Are you trying to get me naked or are you genuinely getting uncomfortable?”
“I need to come,” he pants. “Do you want me to—”
“I own my own business, Potter, I can’t afford to look like a slob—”
“We’re different people now,” Harry said.
“She’s fine,” almost-but-not-quite Draco says with a fond smile. “And you’re going to make your headache worse if you keep calling me ‘almost-but-not-quite Draco’.”
Draco's still pointing, seemingly uncaring about the fallout of pointing at a very fit man in the middle of a crowded pub.
“You have to come back to work!” Harry insists. “None of us are smart enough to solve the cases without you!”
“Feel good?” he asks, kissing up Draco’s neck to nip at the spot under Draco’s ear which never fails to turn Draco into a quivering mess.
Harry gently bites again and Draco concedes defeat.
“You should go, mate,” Ron says, waggling his eyebrows so much Harry’s afraid he’s going to sprain the muscle in his face that controls them.
“Still want to see them.”
Draco gives his mum a fond look, then his ears turn pink when Harry notices.
“Yes!” Harry declares. “I’ll go out on our date alone.”
“I know, Ron.” Harry can hear the disappointment in his voice. But he also knows Ron wouldn’t call them if it weren’t truly an emergency. “I’ll go get Draco and settle the bill.”
"It's true!" Ron insists. "They're almost," he shudders a little, "mates."
She smiled and waved at him.
. “It’s still good news, Draco,” he reiterates.
Draco laughed at him then sobered. “I’m just afraid we’re going to plan this big event and no one from our world will come. I’m still not sure about the name…” he trailed off. “We’ve just invested a lot of time and effort into this and I don’t want you to regret being a part of it.”
“It felt right in the moment?”
“If you finish that sentence, George,” Molly said sternly, “you’ll have no pudding.”
"I do."
Draco chuckles and flicks his fingers against Harry's prostate again.
They walked the rest of the way to the restaurant and Draco couldn’t keep himself from laughing.
“Er,” Harry said. “I don’t want to criticise your technique but—”
“The Countess likes everyone to be in perfect health before she starts her
“Sounds good,” she answered. “I’ll put your order in and be out in a few with your drinks.
Draco raises his eyebrows. “That’s helpful,” he says, snidely.
“This is rather lovely, Draco,” she said after a moment.
“That’s a rather dubious honour,” Harry said. “I think you and I have the ability to bring out the best, or the worst in each other.”
Draco scoffed. “You’ve only met two people here.”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, sliding into Draco’s booth, on the same bench. “You know I’m not actually going to tattle on you, right?” His face was oddly serious. “It was just…”
“Not my name,
“Malfoy!” Harry’s voice drifted into the sitting room. “Stop being a prat and come help us!”
“Nah,” Ron said. “We don’t care if you
“DATE, Ron,” he says.
Ron stares at him. “You know, normally, I would discourage using my daughter to pull, but in this case, you may be right.”
“Sorry,” Scorpius said sheepishly. “I was just excited.”
There’s no answer.
“No, Draco,” he says. “You haven’t made anything weird.”
“Do you mind if I finger you for a bit first? We don’t have to do it, but I think you’ll like it.”
“Ah,” Harry said.
“So, Malfoy…” she started.
OK?” he asked.
“Fuck,” Harry whispers. “You look so gorgeous like this.” He keeps lazily fucking Draco until Draco feels like he’s going to
“Spaghetti Westerns,” Harry answers immediately. He looks at Ron and fires off two-finger guns. “Pardner.”
Harry rolls his eyes at his friends betting on his dating life, but he’s glad they all support him even if they are all wankers here and there. He sees Draco walking towards them. He’s all in black now and even more closed off than when he left to go to his office.
Ron doesn’t answer, he doesn’t need to, his silence confirms Harry’s fear.
“I don’t know,” she murmurs. When she’s done healing Draco’s ankle her eyes settle on the Time-Turner. “Is that a Time-Turner? I thought they were all destroyed.” She puts her wand away and asks, “Can I see it?”
“Ron!” Harry cries. “What?”
“You don’t even know anything about what you would be a partner in,” he said with a sneer. “Potty Potter just throwing money—”
Potter had Apparated into the lobby, apparently without a sound.
Scorpius hefted it in the air. “Packed and ready, Dad. I can’t wait to show Rose all of the maths and potions you do for We-Be’s.”
Harry let out a little hum of annoyance. “Yeah, he sent me a letter,” he admitted. “And ‘Mionie says his son is Rose’s age.”
Or what Harry thinks is supposed to be a wink but is really just an awkward fluttering of his eyelashes. Harry is charmed and feels himself flush.
“Don’t stop!”
“Two,” Draco said, grimacing.
“Yes,” Draco said in a small voice. “Should the unthinkable happen, I will still marry you.”
However, everything changed on a random Wednesday in May.
Hermione nodded. “Yes. His True Love is marrying another tonight. Who else could be suffering so much?”
"How did it happen, or how did you not know?" Ron asks carefully. "Also do you want the truth or something that won't break your brain?"
Harry pulls back and looks Draco in the eye. “You may not have planned anything specific tonight, but I certainly have an idea.” At Draco’s nod, Harry continues, “I thought I would get you naked in our bed and spend as much time as I could worshiping your body before I fuck you into the mattress.”
look nice.”
Draco thinks he hears his mother return the sentiment, but when he turns to look at her one last time, she is gone.
“So what did Hermione say to order?” comes Draco’s voice over the plastic-encased menu.
Humming, Hermione lifted a shoulder. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’ve spent so long with this one goal, I honestly don’t know.”
“I really do want to help,” Hermione said. “It’s a brill idea, controlling the weather, even in a limited capacity.” She motioned Draco closer and he nodded and walked over to her. “I think Harry might be a little embarrassed that he's the reason it’s been raining at your events. So if he runs away from you all evening, don’t take it personally.”
Hermione walked away and thought for a moment. She came back to the cliff. “What if I gave you my word on the soul of my father, Dentist Granger, that you shall reach the top alive?”
Diffindo
“I don't fear you,” Draco declared brazenly. “How can I, when I know Harry will come? We are bound by True Love, something you’ll never know. Love like ours cannot be destroyed by spells or potions; it cannot be tracked down and tortured; it cannot be broken by anything you can Conjure. And believe me when I tell you you
A maniacal look crossed Ginny’s face. “Ha ha!” she crowed. “He’s only
“Oh, are we talking about Draco’s dating life?” Emily asked as she walked into her flat.
Draco nods, and enjoys the way Harry’s stubble scratches his face a little.
"Well, you do love me."
the one with a plan tonight.”
Harry pulls off with an obscene sounding pop and looks up at Draco. “What are you in the mood for?” he asks.
Their boat pulled up to a small beach. Ron grabbed Draco’s arm and Apparated them to the base of the cliff. It was a wall of rock that must have been taller than the tallest spire of the castle at Hogwarts. From it hung a thick rope with a large harness.
“What?” Harry asks.
“Has anyone ever told you you’re a twat?”
Draco pouts and Harry wants to bite his bottom lip.
“Ugh,” he groans.
Harry gently pushes Draco off and moves him so Draco’s on his front.
shouting. “But what did you find?”
“I knew you were a slag, Draco, but I had higher hopes for you, Harry.” She frowned at them as they sat at Draco’s little breakfast table. “Putting out on the first date?” She shook her head. “
“No!” Ron shouts. “If I had known dinner would lead to plotting between you two wankers, I would have never suggested it,” he says darkly.
Draco nodded back, suddenly awkward. “Sounds fine, Harry.”
“Yeah?” Malfoy asks softly.
After a very fun and somewhat horrifying afternoon, Harry finally let himself talk to Draco again. They were in the kitchen cleaning up, just the two of them. Knowing it was because of his scheming best friends, Harry decided to take the moment for what it was intended: time to talk to Draco
Also during the busiest week of Draco’s life, he had started calling Harry,
Draco let out a squeak. “I didn’t realise you um, thought about me that way.”
Harry let out a little laugh. “Did you think we were going to grab kebabs and eat on a park bench?”
“No! No buts—”
Malfoy takes possession of the cursed doll and floats it back to his office, singing, “It’s Brittney, bitch, and I just want to dance with you. Everytime they turn the lights down, just want to go that extra mile for you,” and Harry shrieks internally.
“Oh yes, poor Draco and his fall from grace,” Harry said. “You broke the statute!”
“Yes, we’re supposed to be going home,” Draco says. With his arm on Harry’s, he walks over to the Floo.
“Uh,” Harry said. “I’ll —I’ll have a pint of lager, Mary.”
“It’s an eyesore.”
Stella blushed. It made her light brown eyes sparkle. “We hung out last night.”
Voldie wasted no time in obeying, the wand clattering as it fell. Harry pointed to a chair in the corner of the room with his wand. “Sit,” he ordered and Voldie scrambled to obey. Nodding at Draco, he said, “Tie him up, darling?” and Draco wasted no time in casting an
Ron frowned. “That doesn’t seem very fair,” he replied.
“What?” Harry asked.
“Yeah, that was pretty much my reaction.”
They get into the bed and it’s so weird and horrible and perfect and Harry has to remind himself that they’ve actually shared a bed before. And, aside from him accidentally pushing Draco out onto the floor, the whole thing had gone very well.
“I’m sure.” Draco ignored the scenery and shop fronts to look at Harry while they walked. “I’m glad they became friends. Scorpius only has Muggle friends. They’re wonderful but they won’t ever understand a big part of his life.”
, says, “Don’t move. I’m going to get our things.”
wizards
“We ride to find the prince,” he declared as he climbed back on his Abraxan mount.
"We can talk later, if you want," Harry whispers into Draco's neck.
They were on the faded, lumpy sofa in the lobby of the inn, drinking. It was well past check-in time and Draco had gotten his hands on a couple of really good bottles of fruit wine from a local farmer. The peach wine was empty and they were working their way through a blackberry merlot.

Harry’s focus is on Draco as Alicia starts telling them about the scene. Harry hears
and deftly caught Hermione’s wand.
Harry sharply turned his head to glare at her, but she only smiled back.
Draco grunted. They were on the sofa in front of the fire, trying to stay warm and failing miserably. Harry surreptitiously cast another warming charm at him and smiled when Draco relaxed into it.
“We’re the same age,” Draco insists, still nibbling at Harry’s jaw. He moves to the lobe of Harry’s left ear and gently bites, and, thankfully, it shuts Harry up.
"This really
Sharply turning he stalked back to where Hermione was standing. “That boat?” he asked with a shake of his head. “I’m sure they’re just out for a late night jaunt—” something clunked against the boat— “in the ocean known to be populated by the
“Keep turning it until it stops,” Harry says kindly.
“Don’t worry, love,” Harry reassured him. “We'll soon be out of the forest and laughing about our adventure.”
“Someone like you would be good for the community,” she remarked. “Get some new blood, someone with fresh ideas to take over.”
Harry walks back over to Draco and kneels down to look at the kitten. It immediately starts purring at him and Draco watches as Harry’s face
“He’s trying to ask you if you want company in your office, but he’s the most awkward fucking person in the entire world,” Ron explains. Then he stares at Harry for a second. “That or he had a bad curry last night and needs to run to the toilet but doesn’t want you to know.”
“HELLO!” Hermione roared. “MY NAME IS HERMIONE GRANGER! YOU KILLED MY FATHER! PREPARE TO DIE!”
With a sad smile Harry shakes his head. “Sorry, no. It’s, uh, police business.”
“Can you spread yourself any wider, love?” Harry asks, nipping at Draco’s inner thigh.
Voldie looked down at his guards and nodded. They opened the heavy door where Draco was waiting and Draco walked out, his heart sore and what he hoped was a mild expression on his face. He had warned the prince that theirs would never be a love match, but Prince Voldie had assured Draco his parents’ union had started similarly and they had grown to love each other.
He thinks he hears Draco whisper back, but he’s too fuzzy to concentrate, and he’s asleep before he can wonder about what Draco might’ve said.
However, instead of food, Draco found himself inside Magical Menagerie, watching Luna pick out a kitten and all of the bits and bobs that came with pet ownership.
“Oh!” Draco said.
“I’m sorry!” Draco shouted again through the bathroom. “I didn’t realise you were…” he paused and Harry felt his face catch fire. “Otherwise engaged,” Draco finished.
“I don’t think we need to go that big,” Draco interrupted. “I was thinking more of a soft open with friends and family. Just to see how things go.”
Draco knew she’d had an almost decades-long crush on Stella, going back to their school days, but had never done anything about it. Stella had an annoying habit of dating men who, at first glance, looked like crusty jugglers. In fact, one of them had actually been a juggler and he was, ironically, the cleanest of them all.
“So gorgeous like this,” Harry whispers. He leans down and starts to suck more marks into Draco’s skin. “Do you mind keeping one of these after we’re done?” he asks, looking a little embarrassed.
Draco nodded, charming Harry with his smile and a slight flush to his cheeks. Then he let out a little sigh, his expression changed, and his eyes were sad.
took me out for a lovely birthday dinner last night,” Draco explains. “If you take me out, I’ll consider calling you Ronald.”
“Everything!” Bellatrix promised. “I will give you everything!”
“I’ll help,” Emily said. “I had to fill out a bunch of paperwork after I inherited the inn.” She twirled a lock of her hair around her finger. “Do you mind if Stella comes?”
“It’s a
His son, the back-stabber, giggled. “I
me, Potter," Draco says, a little wetly. "I was well-loved."
A little wooden window in the door opened and a woman with fiery red hair and eyes the color of honey answered. “Yes?” she asked, clearly bored.
After half a minute, Draco pulls back. “We should go to bed,” he says.
“In fact, maybe, er,” he started. “If you’re free one evening, if um, Scorpius comes over here and you’re alone— not that you’d be lonely, I’m sure you have friends, I know Luna said you and Blaise were still friendly,” Harry cut himself off. “
“Rubbish,” was all Ginny said.
“Yeah,” Harry agrees, his voice rough.
“Welcome to the Rosebud—” Emily started. Then, “Oh, it's just you.”
a date.
Harry rolls his eyes. “How about I don’t go into any specifics unless you ask?”
Draco looked up, looked into Harry’s eyes.
“I really am sorry—”
“I don’t know why you bother,” Draco’s only friend, Emily, said as she crowded Draco into the bench seat in his booth. “You know it’s crap but you still order it.”
As Hermione and Ronald did as they were bid, the blond man pulled a brightly coloured robe from a bag at his hip. He used a clumsy Severing Charm to rip the garment in half, then tucked half of it under Draco’s broom and Vanished the rest.
Draco had to think on that. “At least a hundred?” he estimated.
“What the FUCKING FUCK?” Harry repeats. Loudly.
), and dozens of other garden variety smiles. But this fond smile that made his eyes so soft, was new.
After his speech, Prince Voldie met with his royal guards. “We must protect Draco,” Prince Voldie commanded. He inclined his head towards his second-in-command, Countess Bellatrix. “I fear for his safety as the date of our wedding approaches. The country of Surrey is restless and there have been threats against my betrothed. Nothing must happen to him, upon pain of death.”
Prince No-Nose-Arsehole
“So, well, thanks for coming over,” he says. “But it’s really not necessary. I need to leave in a few minutes to meet Draco so I’ll just enjoy my tea...by myself.”
“You’re only invited in because you brought food,” Draco said as he let Potter in.
And Harry… well, Harry’s glad to kiss him back. Draco tastes like grapes and cheese and olives and home, and Harry could lose himself in Draco’s kisses. He lets Draco set the pace, only breaking contact when he needs all of his focus to start unbuttoning Draco’s shirt.
Harry and Ron nod as Malfoy looks put out.
“Send him a letter, mate,” Ron said, and Summoned some parchment and a Biro.
“Fuck,” he whispers to himself. “This isn't ideal.” He glares at his prick. “Have a sense of decorum,” he admonishes it.
Instead of answering, Harry took Draco’s hand in his own.
whatever Harry’s going to say next is going to be arsey.
A flash of lightning crossed the sky and thunder boomed, making them jump apart. Before they could react more, it started to rain. Harry leaned back in to kiss Draco again.
“Oh.” Draco’s taken aback by the soft tone and the earnestness in Harry’s voice.
Harry giggles into his skin and it tickles Draco a little. The sensation fades as Harry starts to bite and suck at the same spot, treading the line of pain-pleasure that makes Draco non-verbal.
Draco choked on his own spit and started coughing. “No,” he said between coughs. “I’m just being nosy.”
“I wasn’t finished,” Harry said, still calm. “Next will be your eyes, one by one, then—”
“I can’t believe you don’t remember Harry’s name,” he hissed. “He’s saved the bloody world.
“I didn’t understand any of that, Harry.”
“Oh yeah,” Neville said, forcefully. “He’s so successful that when the announcement goes up that Weather-Be’s is coming, the students cheer. I’m sure you remember how cold and damp Scotland gets, especially in early spring. When Malfoy comes, it’s warm and sunny, everytime.” Neville smiled. “He’s also turned into a sort of decent bloke, you know. He’s got a son now and seems to have changed his ways. He even apologised.”
he was going to have to change another name in his head. “
Draco nodded. “I’ll make sure no one jumps on it.”
“There is no need for that,” Voldie said in a rush. “If you truly don't wish to marry me, I won’t force your hand.” He looked over at Bellatrix to ask, “You returned him, Harry, to his ship, correct?”
“Our signatures will stay in the database forever,” Draco adds.
“Ron, jog his memory.”
He rolls to face Harry in the dark.
pillows,” Harry groused, but he pulled one of the regular pillows out from under the nice grey ones.
“I’m supposed to kill you, you know,” Ronald said. “My boss wanted me to take you out before you even came ‘round the corner. But I think I should be more sportsmanlike.”
Draco sits down on the bed, and flops backwards so they’re both laying in the bed with their feet more-or-less on the floor.
“For now,” his mother replied. “Let’s see how things go after your little haberdashery opens.
which goblet to drink out of.”
“Please don’t call it that,” Draco said with a groan.
“It’s overwhelming,” Draco finally answered.
“Alien tech,” Harry explained.
Sighing, Draco says, “It’s fine. I was on the edge anyway. Has anyone told you you’re a terrible bed hog?”
The noises from outside got louder and louder until they suddenly stopped. Nothing had fazed the bishop.
“Changed my mind,” Draco says and then bites Harry’s earlobe.
“Ah-ha!” he shouted, watching as Harry flinched. Putting his wand away Draco narrowed his eyes. “You’re the reason it’s rained,” he declared.
Patience was never Draco's strong point. But he vowed to be as patient as possible whilst waiting for his love, his
“Definitely,” Draco answered.
“Oh!” Harry sounds pleased. “You’ve gone monosyllabic. Always thought I could get you there.”
Hermione walked in with Rose. She took one look at Harry and rolled her eyes. “He’s bringing his son to play,” she said, aggravated
Ron lets out a truly fake sigh. “Fine, you can be cute with my only daughter to impress a man, Harry.” Ron thinks for a moment.
“That does explain a lot about our time at Hogwarts.”
“I don’t know,” Draco answered. “And I’m almost afraid to ask.”
Draco rolls his eyes and wiggles his hand under Harry, grabbing Harry’s arse. “No need to worry,” he says, fondly. “Yours is my favourite.”
“Still comfortable?” Harry asks.
. Harry narrows his eyes at her and looks back at Draco whose eyes haven’t left the Quidditch player’s arse.
“Make yourself at home,” Harry says, joking.
Harry nods and pulls Ron into a hug. It’s the middle of a crime scene, but he needs the physical connection.
Draco hummed around his cock to try and indicate that Harry could do it again. When Harry didn’t move, Draco curled his finger again.
With a giggle, Harry clarifies, “No, what do you want me to do?”
“Thanks for leaving me with the tab,” he said.
“Guess you’ll have to add a disclaimer about not guaranteeing the weather if Harry’s there,” Hermione said with a laugh.
“You’re very handsome,” Draco murmured, sidling up to Harry and pulling him close.
“Um, not this?” he offers.
And he may well be, Harry thinks. Their dinner date was several hours ago and neither of them ate much of their pasta. Harry eats at a more sedate pace, watching Draco watch the movie.

And he’s probably straight. Did you see his trousers? No self-respecting queer would wear jeans like that
coming back to that,” he says in a voice lower than he’s expecting.
They made their way to the Gryffindor Common Room in no time and soon Harry was warm and dry and enjoying a cup of hot chocolate that had ‘a little something special’ in it, according to the house elf who had scurried away as soon as she pushed the mug into Harry’s hands.
Peanut Butter runs into the room, summoned by all the shouts and laughter— he’s always liked to be in the room with as many people as possible— and jumps into Draco’s lap.
"Whatever you want."
Draco raises his eyebrows. “I’m sorry, were you stalking me the

ship attacked and he was killed at sea. After all, we all know the Dread Pirate Black never takes prisoners.”
“Yes,” Harry agrees, “but now there’s all this pressure to not fuck things up.”
“Still.” Potter paused and Draco ran through a few spells to try to turn the lights off. “You called me Malfoy.”
Harry looked over at Draco for a brief moment, then looked back at the road. “You’ll look good no matter what your hair looks like.” Harry’s voice was soft and, between the wind and the tone of his voice, Draco wasn’t sure he’d heard him correctly.
“If we keep doing this, I’m going to get hard,” he whispered as Harry nipped at his neck.
headlines and promptly levitates it to the bin. Scorpius snorts, but doesn’t retrieve it. Then they venture out to Diagon so Draco can do some shopping and Scorpius socalise.
the café?”
“Of course you call him ‘Harry’,” she said once she'd gotten her breath back. “You fancy him.”
After a few minutes of soft, lazy kisses, Draco started to roll his hips. “Still good?” he asked.
Harry can only see Draco’s eyes, but he watches as they crinkle in a smile.
“Ew,” Draco replied. “Emily is not my girlfriend.”
"About which part?"
Weather-Be’s had indeed taken off after Luna’s wedding to Ginny Weasley and the subsequent name change. Draco didn’t know if it was because of the rebranding, because of the write up in

“You have got to be fucking kidding me,” Harry groaned as the skies opened and rain beat down on him. He cast an
“Ah, it’s finally sunk in that we’re the same person.” Then other Draco
“I think something nicer than a cuppa,” Harry said. “We open Malfoy’s Menagerie tomorrow. Can we get some champagne?”
“And that’s it?” Emily asked.
“You really should think about getting Scorpius a pet,” she says gently.
Hermione stood up, still holding a fussing Hugo, and hugged Harry. “We’ll talk later,” she agreed. “For what it’s worth, I like this for you.”
They were behind the shop counter, cashing people out, one after another. Draco was glad the tablet they were using was the same brand as his mobile because it was easy for him to use. Harry had spelled a facade around the tablet so it looked like an old-fashioned register but in reality, it was very modern.
enemies.
Bellatrix shrieked and sent more curses, but none of them landed. Still calm, Hermione sent a curse towards Bellatrix’s right shoulder, smiling coldly when Bellatrix started bleeding. With a second flick of her wrist, Hermione sent another curse, wounding Bellatrix in her left shoulder.
“I’m not
Harry doesn’t answer, but he does keep petting Draco with his free hand. Draco takes a few deep breaths and wills his body to relax.
Harry rolls his eyes, but he can’t deny that being in a relaxed environment is allowing him to interact with Malfoy more.
“That’s neither here nor there,” Harry says, trying to break up the fight his oldest and youngest have already had once that day. “Let me ask Draco how he wants to get together so we can get Peanut Butter back.”
“Well now that we did, can we move on to the part where we both enjoy being naked with each other.”
Draco pulled out his wand and flicked a spell, instantly making the kettle whistle.
“Get dressed,” Harry finishes, waving a hand at himself.
Slowly, and with incredible intent, Harry pulled himself fully out of the bed, sword raised and wand at the ready. Voldie had gone completely white, his jaw open, his wand hand shaking. Harry spared another glance at Draco before taking a step towards Voldie.
“Creepy little fucker,” Seamus says with a grimace.
"It's a date, Potter," Draco says with a wink.
“You have such a way with words,” Harry teased and Draco leaned in to kiss him.
“Yes, but—”
Harry has to shake his head. “Yeah,” he croaks out. “I’m right behind you.”
Hermione steered towards Draco while Ron leaned out and plucked him out of the waters, safe from harm. “Gotcha you pointy git,” he said as he unceremoniously dumped Draco on the floorboards.
“His spot,” Draco insists. “You got up.”
.” She pushed the stack of paper she’d brought towards Draco. It did, in fact, have Draco’s name neatly printed at the top.
“Who’s a good kitty?” he asks as Bob purrs. "Who's the most handsome boy in this flat?"
Draco shakes his head.
Ron is biting back a smile, but Harry knows he’s not wrong. He’s a
Draco lets out a little laugh, then snags Ron’s chair and pulls it over to Harry’s desk, a feat made easier by the wheels that Harry and Ron have attached to the legs.
“No, just to sleep,” Harry says, rolling his neck. It’s stiff from his awkward angle on the couch. “I don’t want you going home and torturing yourself.”
“Thanks for the cake,” he whispers. “Happy birthday.”
with raisins again,” Draco groaned.
“What’d you do that for?” Ronald asked after he stowed Draco on their small fishing rig.
Ginny shrieks again and Harry kisses Draco, this time on the cheek.
“Mistress Black’s only child needed a towel,” Kreacher said.
Draco is smooshed against him, snoring a little in sleep, and Harry can’t keep back a little snort at how wrong he’d been about prim and posh Draco Malfoy before they’d started dating. The snort must disturb Draco, because he rolls over and mutters, “Whattsit,” and paws at Harry’s chest.
“Do you want my fingers or—”
“Please,” Harry said and he kicked the covers to the floor.
“Pfft,” Harry sputters. “I should have known you were going to blow it all out of proportion,” Harry grouses. “It’s not a big deal.”
“Ew,” he whined. “Why is it you two get this,” he waved his hand at them, “and I’m stuck mooning over Harry fucking Potter like I’m a second year?”
,” Ginny says with a smirk and a wink at Harry. “You played against him at Hogwarts, Malfoy.”
Draco cleared his throat. “I meant it all,” he said.
“He’s upset, Harry,” she says, after her latest visit. “He’s ashamed.”
“No reason,” he replies quickly. He looks at the floor. “So, drinks?” he asks
The guards started shuffling and shouting, scared of the wraith that was somehow floating before them.
“Yeah, it’s a stuck-up little thing,” Draco says with a smile.
Black nodded. “Yes, well the problem is, if you go too soft on people, they want
Harry doesn’t answer but he does nibble up Draco’s thigh until his nose is in the crease of Draco’s pubis. The smell is heady, spicy from Draco’s soap combined with the clean scent of Draco’s sweat, and Harry reaches down to grab his own cock and give it a couple of dry strokes. He moves his head to the right and pulls one of Draco’s balls into his mouth, rolling it round and giving it a gentle suck.
Hermione looked away for a moment. Turning back to the man in black she said, “I’m only working with Zacharias to pay the bills, and honestly I’m starting to get a little discouraged since I haven't yet been able to find the six-fingered woman.”
Ron and Hermione are free next Saturday afternoon, if you’d like to bring Scorp round. And Molly wants you to come to a Sunday dinner one weekend. Let me know when you’re free for that.
Draco sets his glass down, scribbles out,
“Seriously your bedhead is not of this earth!” he shouts from the lounge and Harry’s left smiling.
Raising an eyebrow, Draco looked down at his own clothes. His smart trousers were, in fact, tailored to fit and he knew the dark grey made his legs look longer. The matching waistcoat continued the trend of making him appear taller and leaner than he actually was and the lavender shirt he was wearing brought warmth to his eyes and cheeks.
“Would you like to move forward?” Harry asks.
“Well, I’m going to kill myself tonight, and you’ve always been kind. So I just wanted to say goodbye.”
“You know that’s not all there is to it,” Draco replied, cautiously.
“Routine.” Draco sighed. “My morning cup is the only thing l have left of my previous life.”
“You can recite the Malfoy
Furrowing his brows, he crossed his arms. “Don’t think he’s ‘up to something’,” he said, petulant.
“What are you laughing about, Harry?” Hermione asks as she joins him on the sofa.
Harry’s tirade— about safety and
“Do you not have a bed?” Harry blurts out.
Draco sighs and gives Harry a helpless look. “When did you get so demanding?” he asks, his eyes tired, but kind.
Draco looks down at the Time-Turner, his emotions wavering between wonder and disbelief. But Lovegood is correct and there, in a small, messy script are the words
Smile lines, Draco knows suddenly. Harry Potter, the boy who lived, a child soldier, has smiled enough that he wears the proof of it on his face.
“Just what?”
“I love you,” Draco says, walking away from her, from his father, still hunched over in defeat, from his entire
Draco finally relents, pounced on their feet, meowed at them, crawled all over them both, and most insultingly, he put his arse directly into Draco’s face so that his little arsehole was on display.
. Harry sighs when it’s over and he feels Draco melt into his arms.
“I hear you’re retiring to the coast,” he replied.
from a person,” Ron explains, smiling. “Hermione said they were den...ters.”
Their food comes and Draco lets out a little laugh. “Weasley was right,” he says. “The meatballs are as big as your fist.”
“You’re very weird,” he says leaning down to kiss Harry.
, what horrors he might subject Draco to. He knew he was fair to behold; ever since his engagement, people had been trying to copy his platinum hair with glamours, his clear, pale eyes with potions—
“No, we are
Draco kissed him again. He pulled back and wiggled around so he was straddling Harry. “Is this OK?” he whispered.
Draco works with Ron and Harry on another case and Harry catches Draco singing while he’s working on the curses at the site.
“Pretend you’re weren’t raised by barbarians,” Harry says with a sigh.
Lily is the first to realise Peanut Butter is gone. She comes into Harry’s study after their trip to Diagon Alley in tears. At ten, she’s incredibly sensitive when it comes to their pet niffler.
“I was actually on a case in the area,” Potter replied. “I’m a cursebreaker for the Auror Department and there were a couple of nasty cursed items, so I spent the night. I was checking out of the local inn when I ran into Draco.”
Harry blushed again.”Er, “Mionie and Gin help me with my more professional clothes,” he said.
“You’re letting me in so well,” Harry says, and Draco spares a moment to wonder when Harry got so good at this.
“Thanks,” Harry says as they step away from each other. “I’ll owl you later.”
The man in black’s hand twitched by his wand. “Now who is presuming to know the other.”
“Darling, know this, I will
birthday.”
“Not big on knocking,” Harry muttered to himself.

His grey eyes are tinged with red, his nose is pink and looks sore, and his hair, usually shiny and sleek, is mussed and staticky.
, but at least he felt helpful talking to people coming to terms with their sexualities and gender identifications.
with his spouse, but now that he’s got Harry, he’s going to work the rest of his life to keep him.
Harry’s mobile made a weird noise. “Oh yeah, and I got you a new phone,” he said as he pulled his out of his pocket. “I left it with your mother. It’s warded against almost everything, but it’s delicate so it won’t fuck up the electronics.”
She let out a fond laugh. “Whatever makes you most comfortable.” Walking to her desk, she made herself comfortable and said, “Hobsey?”
,” she said. “You had your love in front of you and you threw him away like he was nothing.”
“They have a soup and sandwich deal that’s actually not bad. You get a cup of soup and a half sandwich.”
Stella came back with two flutes of zhampagne and put them on the table. “I would recommend pairing this with our fried mozzarella sticks.”
of our friends are menaces.”
“You’re still dressed; I’m barely undressed,” Draco whines. “I thought you had plans.”
“You don’t have to have sex with me just because I furnished your flat!” Harry squeaked out.
Wandless and trapped, Hermione straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin. “Kill me quickly?” she asked, softly.
“And I was serious about you sitting in on the interrogation, Malfoy,” Ron adds. “I know this one was more personal for you which is probably why the lack of a big finish—”
"What the fuck, Malfoy?" was how Ginny Weasley greeted him.
“Hi Harry. Hi, Draco,” Stella said when she reached their table. “Do you know what you want to order?”
“It’s not!” Draco interjected.
“Thank you for the dinner invite,” he whispers against Harry’s skin.
Nodding Harry’d added, “And fit.”
In the twenty-nine years Draco Malfoy had been on earth, there were exactly two things he had done of which he was proud. Sure there were things that he didn't hate, things he took great joy in having accomplished. But nothing stood up to the pride he felt when he looked at his son, Scorpius, or went to an event for his business,
“Should I leave?” Potter asked through the door.
“I must admit,” Ron said as he followed the man in black, “I don’t have as much experience fighting only one person. I usually take on whole groups.” He groaned as his next attempt at hitting the man in black failed.
Voldie gave her a disdainful look. “I always plan for a trap,” he drawled. “It’s how I’m still alive.” He climbed back onto his horse and led everyone away from the cliff’s edge, towards the green fields, towards Surrey.
Ron gives Harry a slight leer and Harry has to turn his head to keep from laughing.
“I’m not Harry.”
“Because you startled me!” Draco shouts back. “And why are we shouting?!”
using Scorpius’ nickname meant he was fighting a losing battle. Astoria had always called Scorpius ‘Scorp’ and they both know when Draco uses it, it means he’s feeling soppy and willing to give Scorpius his way.
last night.”
“Eager,” Harry says.
Hermione cocked her head to the side. “I could do that. I should let you know that I’ve been instructed to kill you. But I promise to wait until you’ve reached the top.”
“Fine!” Ginny replied, frustrated. She threw her hands in the air and stormed away.
“Do you have plans tonight?” Harry asks, once again staring at the hem of Draco’s black skinny jeans.
“Yeah,” Draco says, moving so he can nip up Harry’s neck, “give it to me.”
“I’ll tell you if you look at me,” Draco answers, his voice still a little thick.
“Yes, I am daft,” Draco agreed as he was half dragged out of Voldie’s chambers. “Daft to think I could ever marry someone like you. A

“Um,” Draco replies. Then he glares at Harry. “How long have you been lurking, Potter?”

Harry nods, aware that he’s weird and anxious around Malfoy and not
Ron jumps at the crack of Apparition and Draco walks through the door, wand casting as soon as he’s past the threshold. Harry takes a minute to watch him work.
Harry leaned over and kissed Draco’s hair.
“Tell me about what you expected,” Draco says as Harry makes himself comfortable at the other end of the sofa.
Lily starts talking about wanting bolognese while Al makes faces at her. Jamie wants bacon sarnies because that’s
want a potion more than I want your mouth!” he insists.
“You’ll be fine,” Ron says after he stops laughing.
“It might not be a bad idea for Draco to see it where we found it,” Harry says. “Maybe he can get a read from the house that we haven’t.”
“Is there anything I can do?” he asks kindly.
Draco felt Harry’s chest expand then the air rush out. “I said I want you to fuck me.’
is to feel close to each other.”
Under the text was a string of numbers, presumably belonging to Potter.
“You might want to kiss him before you get back, it’s not…” his voice trails off. “It’s not good Harry.”
“Oh yes,” Hermione agreed. “Also I have to ask, do you have any accomplices? Specifically a woman with six fingers on her left hand?”
Harry was breathing too hard to answer, but he did have the presence of mind to grab his wand and send a gentle cleaning charm over his stomach and Draco’s hand.
I wanted to start one.”
“Ugh!” Harry groaned.
“So retiring to Hooker’s Hamlet is suddenly in your twenty-year life plan?” Draco scoffed.
“No, it’s fine,” Harry said. “We are in bed together.” He let out a sigh and rolled onto his back, moving his arm over his face. “I didn’t want to come out to
Lifting her head, Ginny looked at Ron and Hermione, seemingly happy for a willing audience. Then slowly she pressed on Harry’s chest.
Still smiling, the king patted Draco’s arm again. “Lovely to hear,” he said. They were at the entrance to the Honeymoon Suite so the king opened the door for Draco. “Have a wonderful night,” he said. As he turned, Draco heard him say, “He kissed me!” in wonderment.
Thankfully, Harry went back to London and left Draco alone with Stella and Emily. Between the soft smiles and his mother’s meddling, Draco’s head was all over the place.
“Not a word, Potter!” Ginny said, stomping off.
He had been so warm and pink and happy at the restaurant. As Alicia talks, all of the colour has drained from his face, his eyes have turned steel grey, his jaw is clenched. Harry wants a Time Turner so he can go back and see happy, warm Draco again, but he knows they have a job to do, no matter how much they both dread what’s to come.
“I don’t care what my plates look like,” Draco said. “I can’t believe you furnished my kitchen.”
Ron straightens his shoulders and grins at the mention of his mum.
“Ah.”
“Colours of the world! Spice up your life! Every boy and every girl! Spice up your life! People of the world! Spice up your life! Aaaaaah,” he sings.
“Hate you,” Draco grunts.
He looks so pleased with himself Harry can’t help but smile back.
“I don’t regret it, Draco,” Harry said loudly from across the store. “No matter what happens, I won’t regret being involved in our store.”
"Don't be late," Harry manages to say.
He hadn’t realised Pansy was dating anyone.
“Because our flat has been taken over by Ron, Hermione, Rose, and Hugo while their cottage is being renovated,” Harry reminded him.  “And Grimmauld isn’t safe for kids.”
Draco frowned at Voldie’s smile. “All of the owls except your best owl, though.” he said.
“Weasley said you were talking about my tattoo that day.” Draco’s ears go pink, making Harry smile.
“Goodnight, Draco. Sorry this place is terrible.”
“Ginny and I broke up after the war and I’ve been single ever since.” Potter was staring ahead, his brow furrowed. “
“Potter?” he asks gravely. “Are you in love with me?”
“Why did we have kids?” Draco groans as they listen to Scorpius tear back down the hall.
Phoenix
“If we’re done,” Draco says, voice crisp, and good Merlin does Harry love when his voice goes all posh and proper and his consonants are sharp. “I’m taking Harry home.”
Harry could see the blinding smile on Draco’s face. As the Doctor and Rose saved Mikey and the world, he let out another shout.
“Nobody cares,” Harry counters. “They all know I’m ‘bsessed with you.”
in the past decade.”
Emily gave him a weird look. “We’re not mates. I just don’t feel the need to call him by his surname like some of the weirdos in this room.”
“What do you think they’re going to do with the building?” Draco asked in a rush, eager to try and move past his faux pas. Telling someone he thought they were old was frowned upon in both Muggle and Wizarding societies.
“I’ll work on it,” Draco replied. “I’d like very much to keep you around, Harry.”
Potter was alone on the couch, grinning like a moron. “I have money,” he repeated.
“Laugh all you want,” Draco said. “But you know I can hex you.”
After an awkward silence, the man in black jumped up. “I’m rested if you’re ready to duel.” He pulled his wand out of his thigh holster. Hermione nodded, pulled out her wand with her left hand, and cast a non-verbal hex which the man in black easily parried.
Draco feels his cheeks heat. “You just—” he gestures to the table. “I didn’t expect to see flowers on your table.”
“Looks like.” Potter let out a low laugh. “Ron and Hermione think I’m mental,” he admitted.
“Now you’re just being weird.”
Turning to Ginny he says, “We’re all aware of my past-transgressions, girl-Weasley, and if you’re interested in my best friend and want my approval, I would suggest you keep a civil tongue.”
“Shall we ride to your ship?” Bellatrix asked with a leer.
Ron rolled his eyes and let Hugo down. The boy toddled off, making his way straight to a patch of weeds, then grabbed some and tried to stuff them in his mouth.
He had retrieved all of his cauldrons when Harry Potter walked out of the castle.
“They’re working on it,” Draco answered.
Draco had hidden himself behind Harry and avoided the bulk of the spray, but Harry’s hair was dripping, his fringe in his eyes.
“What shall I call you then?” Draco asks, frowning a bit.
was his ship, yes?” He paused while Draco nodded again. “He asked me to
Draco rolled his eyes. “Now who’s being a drama llama?”
He gets in the bed and gently pushes Bob closer to Draco.
Draco’s swept away thinking about the memories of his wedding day: the nerves and resentment of the arranged marriage mixed with hopefulness that he and Astoria might lead a much different life than their parents. Draco had never expected to marry for love, only duty, and his face in the photo shows his resignation. They had never loved each other romantically, but they had found love for each other as friends and confidants. Before Astoria’s death, they had carved out a little bit of happiness that Draco had never expected. Her death had been a blow to both Draco and Scorpius, but she had urged Draco to look for love after she passed.
“No!” Harry had shouted. “I just think he’s pretty!”
Draco’s shoulders droop. Harry knows his frown must match Ron’s.
Then Harry realised what he’d said and he frowned. “That sounded better in my head,” he admitted.
Draco frowned. “You’re wrong. I’ve never called him Harry in my life. Maybe
“Are you going to behave?” Harry asked when he had himself back under control.
Rolling his eyes, Harry looks at Draco again. His hair is flat against his face as he peers up at Harry.
Draco can’t answer for a minute because he’s too busy kissing Harry. When his mouth is finally free, he says, “It’s our anniversary, Harry. We’re going to enjoy some adult activities in the bedroom.”
True to his word, Potter had all of the licenses filed and approved in record time. Draco spent the week visiting nearby farms and wineries. He signed contracts for the fruit wine he and Emily loved and for fresh fruit— apples and berries— to sell when they were in season. He met with a woman who made her own soap and body lotions and became her sole distributor. She knew the woman who made Stella’s bath bombs and soaks and had arranged a meeting for Draco. The products were lovely, so they were selling her products as well.
“I like it,” Harry declared. “I can ask my mate to make a little logo for you if you’re interested.”
“He’s an alien!”
Draco went back to his chambers and wrote a quick letter to Harry and gave it to Bellatrix who took it without a word. Then he started pacing, worried about Harry.
“Fuck off,” Draco says.
“Potter, are you feeling well?” Malfoy asks, actual concern on his face. “Do you need to go to Mungo’s?”
Harry looked around, confused. “Wha?”
“We had to go to the miracle woman, Ginny, to get a pill to bring you back to life,” Hermione said and then she peeked up to look at the gate again.
“Yes,” Draco whispered then kissed Harry and moved into place.
Draco heard Harry laugh from across the room and looked over at him. He was surrounded by the people who were there and they were all talking animatedly. Harry looked over and caught Draco’s eye and winked.
He lets out a little hum.
But Draco had found, again, that he was nothing if not resilient. He'd reinvented himself for a third time, this time as a widowed father to a young child. He had mourned for months, thankful that Scorpius’ public school had kept his son occupied and not able to see Draco break down and have to rebuild himself. But rebuild he did. An owl from Headmistress McGonagall had planted the seed that later turned into Wizard Weather Services. A few years later, and Draco was incredibly happy with his life. He had a thriving business, an amazing son, friends, both old and new, and the recognition that he had done his best to make amends for his past behaviour.
“Can we at least go out for drinks after work?”
Harry pulled Draco closer and looked up at the ceiling, warm and happy and content. It had been a very nice evening.
Ron turned towards Harry, his eyes big and his mouth open a little in shock. “I’m sorry?” he asked. “Did you say you think
high and Draco had slept better than he had anticipated.
He felt himself start to smile and had to turn back to cleaning up because if he encouraged Hermione, she would mother him as much as Ron and Ron was enough of a mother hen for Harry.
-Draco?”
“Thanks,” Harry says a little gruffly. “I think he…”
Draco sighs. “You are that,” he agrees. “And it’s a sound decision on your part.”
“And I’m just saying that this is a pointless conversation and I don’t know why we’re having it.”
“You look nice, Harry.”
Harry, forever grateful for his best friend, tries to smile and Apparates back to the Ministry.
“I don’t have the money for a store, even
“I don’t care,” he admits, feeling wanton as he rubs his naked body all over Harry’s fully clothed one.
Oliver Wood was eating a mini-tart and talking with his hands to Emily and Stella. From the looks they were sending Draco, he knew they were talking about
“Draco wants to open a store that actually sells things people need. And he wants to find local vendors for as much as possible.” Emily’s eyes glinted as she smiled. “And he wants to call it ‘Draco’s Emporium of Fine Goods’.”
Draco had also had Stella spread the word that there would be an area for used books and the townspeople were welcome to consign any books they wanted to get rid of. Several people had brought books and only a few were rejected because of the alarming subject matter. Robert the mechanic’s
Draco’s mind quit working. He stared until Harry cleared his throat.
“No, that was just something I came up with when I was bladdered.” Draco crossed his arms and tried not to pout.
Bob looks at Draco with such love in his eyes that Draco falls even more in love with his beautiful, ginger cat.
“If your dad is off limits in front of your mum, then that’s off limits for me.” Potter frowned and Draco was
Harry muses about that. Charlie Weasley
“Like this,” Draco gasped out and Harry could only nod.
They get inside and the entryway is filled with the detritus that comes with having a small child, various toys, small shoes carelessly discarded here and there, a purple backpack hanging on a hook. Harry hears Draco inhale sharply.
“What brings you to the Hamlet?” his mother asked.
Shrugging, Draco said, “Honestly? I didn’t know what to expect. So that was one option.”
When Harry answered, his voice was thick. “If you think I’ll enjoy it, go for it.”
Pulling Rose out of Harry’s arms, Hermione tuts at him. “Well, he’d be a fool not to be interested.”
in only a few weeks time. Though the loss of Harry was an old, familiar pain, Draco still ached for his lost love when he contemplated marrying another. Pushing the thought aside, he squared his shoulders, and looked up to give the prince a genuine smile.
“Competent wanker,” he whispers.
“Hey!” Harry insists but he decides to change the mood and slides off the bed to kneel on the floor.
Draco nodded at her. “Good.” Then, because it was the morning and he wanted his tea, he asked, “Can I please have my usual?”
“To recruit the man in black.” She smiled, a little bloodthirsty. “We have to find him so I can avenge my father!”
Draco’s stuck in place, feeling wrongfooted.
glow against the pale grey cloth.
“Hermione’s incredibly smart.”
Malfoy stares at him, then lets out a little laugh. “I suppose you would know,” he allows. “I do enjoy talking magical theory with Hermione. And Weasley’s a decent cook.”
“Then leave us in peace!” Harry insists.
“But if you want, I suppose I’ve suffered greater indignities in my life.”
“You don’t look happy, my dear,” Voldie murmured as he tucked a loose strand of hair back into the intricate braids in Draco’s hair.
“They did it!”
Harry looked at him expectantly.
Draco groaned and rolled his eyes. But he didn’t insist Potter leave.
“I am already in my pyjamas,” he said, rolling so his back was to Emily. She curled around him so they were spooning.
Harry let out a grunt of disapproval.
“Don’t,” Draco interrupts. Because if there’s anything that will kill the mood, it’s a bad joke.
Harry looks up at Draco, and he looks like he wants to fucking
“You sound like Hermione with Rose,” Harry said with a little laugh.
find the man in black!” Full of purpose, she started walking away from the forest, towards the castle.
“They used a Levitation Charm to move it. I’m pretty sure the person leaving them is an adult which means that they could just carry the object with no problem.”
“They’re not
“You had—” Draco starts, his whole face now pink. “Frosting,” he says as he looks at his finger and mutters a quiet
“He has nothing to be ashamed of!” Harry shouts.
“You know that’s not an actual answer and—”
"Blergh," Harry says, shuddering.
“No!” Ron insisted. “We bet on if you would admit you liked Draco.”
Ron nods and looks at Harry. "Sounds good," he says while giving Harry a lot of eye contact. "I'll owl you."
However, she had also had no judgement the night they both got properly drunk and Draco had talked about the War for the first time. So Draco learned to deal with an improper way of making tea because it meant that he was accepted.
“I was at all of those,” Harry said with a frown. “It rained! That’s my point.”
Its rumbly purr and little ears are not budging Draco’s heart. At all. Neither is the tail that swishes back and forth with its little striped pattern.
“You know Ron helped.” Draco nodded and Harry continued, “And Hermione is my solicitor.”
“You’ve lived here less than an hour and you already have
“Not in the middle of the Blue Moon,” Emily said.
As if Summoned, Stella came over to their table. “Your usual?” she asked, her eyes darting between Harry and Draco. “Or something nicer?”
"Is it
“Yeah?”
Tears prick at Draco’s eyes again as he looks down at the inert object in his hand. It wasn't real. He hadn't gone into the future and seen the happiness that is to come, something he doesn't deserve. He’s going to Azkaban, he’s going to get the Kiss, he’s—
“I have nothing to say to you,” Draco spat out.
“Did you like it?” Draco whispered back.
“Should we light a bunch of candles and I’ll look deep into your eyes as I fuck you?”
“No, stay,” Harry insists in a rush. “I just wanted you to know that I’m yours and you’re so hot that I melted and that’s why I’m such a moron when you’re here.”
“I really don’t think you’re fine,” Harry says, feeling his heart ache.
Draco kicked off his shoes and pulled himself out from under Harry and moved so he could lay the full length of the bed. He watched as Harry’s shoes went flying and then Harry lay down next to him.
“The owners really leaned into the whole theme, didn’t they?” Harry said as an Elvis song came on. He pointed at the neon burger and shake sign that proclaimed the cafe was open.
"We hid it in the corner then threw my invisibility cloak over it," Harry says, a little sheepishly.
Harry raises his head to look at Ron in disbelief.
Walking slowly, Hermione didn’t seem to feel any pain; her wounds were so extensive. Bellatrix sent a curse, this time at Hermione’s heart but, with a flinch, Hermione was able to send up a Shield Charm in time. She flicked her wand and sent a Jelly Legs Jinx at Bellatrix, making the Countess step back.
first time and I don’t want to bollocks it up.” Then he curled his fingers and smiled when Harry shuddered. “I do want us to both have a good time.”
then, deciding it's warranted, thumps his head against the desktop a few more times.
Malfoy turns around, frowning. “It’s definitely one of Bellatrix’s,” he says. “But she didn’t leave it here. I found a hint of someone else’s magic, hidden quite well, on the girl mouse.”
Harry let out a gurgle of pain and groaned.
Harry turns his head so he can look Draco in the eye.
Hermione was still throwing herself against the door and shouting in frustration. Ron stopped her from slamming her body into it again, then stood in front of the door and

“I was saying, I need to go pick up Scorpius. I don’t know if you were planning on Apparating back to the Weasley’s, but if you were…” Draco trailed off, a little anxious. “I’d enjoy your company on the walk back to the Apparition point.”
Draco nods and holds out his arm so they can Side-Along, and there’s the familiar pull in his gut, and then they’re home.
, and the start of Ginny’s time with the Potter children. She'd also graciously extended an invitation to Scorpius.
“If my hair is a mess and I look mental when we get home, you have to tell me.”
As soon as the green fire subsided, Draco Apparated to Ron and Hermione’s. Scorpius had reached a level of independence that meant he no longer wanted to Side-Along. But Draco was going on a first date and didn’t want to risk his clothing to the Floo. So, inefficient as it was, they made their way to the cottage separately. Draco appeared in the garden and he could hear Scoprius and Rose talking excitedly when he knocked at the back door.
,” he droned. After disappearing, he had made his way back to where Hermione and Harry were and was helping Hermione carry Harry, under the cloak.
with a swish will open it.” Then she ran off.
“Take him to see the sign,” Emily suggested. “It should have been first on the tour.”
“Stay for dinner?” Harry asks.
"Fuck me," Harry says in a weak voice.
“Fuck you,” Draco said to them both, getting up to leave.
“The signatures of all current and former employees of the Ministry are on file, especially those who work for or with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.” Draco has a wry smile on his face. “That was Granger’s compromise for not purging all of the records. She said if we can’t hold the Ministry accountable for their crimes then we should just abolish the whole thing.”
She turned away before Draco could ask how she was going to manage to curb a
discount!” Draco exclaimed. “I don’t want to give random strangers a discount!”
When he’s full seated, they both pause and catch their breath. Draco’s gone a bit soft from the stretch and moving around, but blood starts to fill his cock as Harry leans down to kiss him, his stomach brushing Draco’s erection.
“That’s
“You just keep appearing,” Harry said. Then he lifted his head and his frown made his lighting bolt scar scrunch up.
“Yes!” Ron shouted from the hall. “Pay up!”
“Both,” Draco said decisively, making Harry laugh again. “But that’s enough about me for our first date. What has the Boy-Who -Lived been up to since Hogwarts?”
“Hey,” Draco says. “It’s that
He stopped in the middle of the road and it was so sudden, Draco was forced to stop as well. Potter gestured to the buildings surrounding them and the people who were not-so-discreetly staring at them.
Ron laughs. “No, Harry got a little too invested in, what were those things we watched over the weekend?”
“Are you?” Harry asks with a grin. Then he leans over and kisses the tip of Draco’s nose.
They heard a branch break and Hermione cast a Disillusionment Charm over them both so they wouldn’t be found. A ragged man, with big, rat-like teeth walked into the copse, pushing a wheelbarrow. He looked nervy and on edge. Hermione dropped her charm and he let out a little squeak.
Luna cast an
, Draco. But you’re not. I’m not letting you stay here to run yourself ragged all night. Everyone needs you to be in top shape, and that means you have to eat more than what we had at the restaurant and sleep tonight.”
Ron laughs. Harry glares at him. Ron laughs some more.
"I'll go with how it happened and the truth," Ron decides. "He changed, mate. He's still a prat, but he's not under his dad's thumb and he's able to think for himself. He's also conventionally attractive and
“Am I supposed to be happy?” Draco asked in a measured voice.
Draco was cursing under his breath. He had thought Scorpius couldn’t hear him until he piped up with, “Does Grandmother know you use words like that?” and Draco spun around in horror.
Harry gave her a
“Do you visit them a lot?”
Then, without another word, he Disapparated.
Harry leaned back and laughed. “I don’t think so?” He kissed Draco again, a quick kiss that Draco almost didn’t feel. “I think we probably needed to talk about it all. Or at least acknowledge them both.”
“Happy,” Draco says. “A little sad,” he admits. “Lots of feelings.”
His mouth starting to go dry, Draco can only nod.
. “Let me see if I can remember what other Draco told me when I was the young one.” He huffs out a breath and thinks.
“If we do much more” he gasped, “I’m going to embarrass myself.”
“I have to—” Draco says as he casts another spell.
“We’re going to mine,” Harry says.
“Ron,” Hermione whispered again, her voice loud in the stark silence. “I know that cry. It is the epitome of suffering. My heart made that cry when I saw my father murdered in front of me all those years ago. I had hoped to never hear the sound again, but now the man in black makes it.”
Instead of answering, Bellatrix shouted
“Is the surprise your penis?”
The man in black cocked his head. “You do not love your intended?”
“Scorp?” Draco said, disapproval clear in his tone.
“And they couldn’t have gone to the Burrow because…” Draco started.
“You always make the best noises, love,” Harry says as he starts to gently fuck Draco on his finger.
“I’m going to the café,” he said.
,” she responded with a grin.
“Don’t forget to use the special boxes,” a Weasley voice said from the back room.
Harry squawks. “You’re one to talk with those trousers!”
Instead of answering, Draco reached over and pulled Harry’s shirt over his head and tossed it out of the bed. Then he pulled at the buttons of his pyjama top, until they were all undone, and threw it in the opposite direction of Harry’s.
“I asked if you would mind staying over tonight.” Draco looks up and glares, seemingly upset at his show of vulnerability. “If it’s not too much trouble.”
“Where did
asked Scorpius.
Ginny let out a little
Harry rushes through his morning routine, doing the least possible amount of work before Flooing to the Ministry. He rushes to his office and almost runs into Ron.
"Tight," Draco grits out.
“We both know we would eat every last bite of our curry and be too full to fuck,” Draco says back. “And I have plans.”
don’t get anything delivered by Owl Post because, Emily notwithstanding, we do actually try and obey the law.”
Harry can’t hold back his laugh as he walks out the door.
He makes it to Ron and Hermione’s in one piece and only partially covered in ash.
“I know,” he grumbled, his fuzzy brain not acting as a filter to keep out his overconfident thoughts. “It would be an amazing shop.” He got up and stumbled his way to the sink to put his cup in to soak. “I would have little bits of coloured paper and some biros and some of those radio-controlled cars that the kids love so much.”
“Yeah, she’s still working,” Draco said. “But it’s more fun with just us,” he said.
“Food!” Emily shouted from her tiny kitchenette. “We found dishes and cutlery for everyone!”
“Yes?”
“I’m Stella’s fourth cousin,” the woman said. “What the fuck are
that plastic sealed package of beans.” She smirked at Draco. “And you needed that di—”
“Mate…” Ron trails off and Harry closes his eyes. The silence stretches out for half a minute before Ron says, “I’m sorry.”
Harry gasps. “I’ll
“I don’t have a problem with him,” Harry muttered. Then, “
When Rose and the Doctor landed across the way from the London Eye and the Doctor smiled and said
Harry makes his way to the door and moves all of his children out of the way.
“Malfoy’s Menagerie,” he whispered to himself.
"Scorpius said you like fish and chips!"
Draco lets out a sigh. “He didn’t mention.”
She laughed at him. “You’re not supposed to tell a woman she looks old,” she gently teased.
Draco nodded.
“You did look a bit daft falling like that,” Draco says with a smirk.
Draco gets out of the bed, flinching when he lands on his injured ankle. He takes the Time-Turner gingerly from Potter.
Harry lifts up his head. “Did you find something at the site?”
Draco cracks open his eyes and even the dim lighting is harsh to his eyes after they’ve been closed for who knows how long.
She crawled into the bed and Draco followed. “I still think it’s a good idea,” she murmured, already half asleep.
“If it’s not too much trouble,” Draco responds. “I would be happy with a quick wank at this point.”
“We can do that,” Draco responds in a shaky voice. “Are we talking full penetration or—”
“I’ll let you have this one, Potter. But don’t get cocky.”
"In his mouth?”
“Fuck!” Draco says emphatically.
“I thought you knew all about it,” Draco says looking up to give Harry more room to kiss and bite.
“You’re the classiest person I’ve ever had the privilege to meet,” Draco said dryly.
“Hello, sir,” he said, giving Draco a quick bow. “We are traveling musicians and our carriage has broken down. Can you help us?”
Ron thought for a moment. “Ten? Fifteen if they’re not using magic.”
Hermione was smiling at them both like he and Harry had done something extraordinary and she was proud of them.
Pulling something out of her pocket, she dropped two dark blobs into their drinks.
Draco’s eyebrows are threatening to reach his hairline. “You’re attracted to me,” he says, a little smugly.
“You know he said
“But I got a trace of magic from the clown that wasn’t Bellatrix’s!” Draco says back, also indignantly.
“This man is the captain of the ship
Ginny perked up at that. “Oh, well, then bring him in.” She stepped back to let Hermione in and Ron picked the man in black back up and laid him on the table Ginny motioned to.
"Are you close?" Harry has to ask, knowing the
“Give us your wand so we may open the gate,” Harry ordered.
“Can we go out to the garden, Dad?” Rose asked.
She knocked her shoulder into Draco, something he was starting to associate only with her. He’d never had a friend who was so casually physical and he didn’t know if he liked it.
“There was a great duel here,” he pronounced as he reenacted Hermione’s and the man in black’s footsteps. He studied various hex burns and chunks of rock that had been broken by the fight. “The winner went that way,” he pointed, “to Surrey.” Then he turned and said, “The loser went that way,” he pointed in the opposite direction. “The winner will lead us to Draco. We cannot risk flying again, the horses will take us too high. We must right to find my fiancé.
Harry spends the rest of the work day in a haze, his brain staticky. He’s thankful that Ron is his partner because Ron is fluent in
Interrupting the old man were roars from outside. Voldie nodded to Bellatrix and she left the chapel at a run. Draco heard Alecto shout “Stand your ground!” and he smiled.
“This is
milk!”
“Goodnight, Draco.”
“That’s all of me, darling,” Draco said.
“I’ll give your arsehole—”
Dread Pirate Black.” Draco squeaked. “Yes, I was surprised as well,” Harry said with laughter in his tone. “Black told me her name was actually Tonks.”
