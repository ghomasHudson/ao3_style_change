"First, Granger, thanks. I bet this was your doing; second, Potter, you idiot, no more scheming with your friends involving me. I'm going to thank you in that restroom. I've checked, it's clean."
“Wait, you don’t have to do this,” Draco says, a hand pressed on Potter’s elbow. “I mean, you can do it if you want, but you shouldn’t do it because they say so.”
“I think this little fella has something to do with his mother’s lack of serious injuries.”
"Would you stay with me when I give Dudley the potion?"
Draco wondered how everyone didn’t go bonkers when the mismatched group reunited every week. He liked his quiet nights with a bottle of wine, maybe a book, or some music playing...
“Hey.”
Draco flicks his fingers, and the cigarette flies from the man’s hand. He knows they’re staring at him with wide eyes as he walks by them and steps on the cigarette. He keeps walking with a satisfying sensation, more so when he realises it’s the first time he has accomplished any wandless magic.
It was nearly morning. Harry was drowsing, with Scarhead on top of him and a blanket draped over his legs, when Draco spoke in a murmur. Almost like he didn’t want Harry to hear.
“I… had my suspicions.”
"You're a bottomless pit. I wonder how you're not overweight."
“Is that so? I thought you had disappeared for good.”
“It's ok. Well, it's not, but it's starting to be.”
“You’re a prat, definitely,” he says, but the smile on Potter’s lips says another story. “Ok, let’s do this, and then we’ll talk about that maybe.” He nears his cousin’s bed and tries to be careful and not spill the phial content.
"Please, miss…"
"Is he ok?" Katie asks anxious.
“What?”
, but he lost his chance to ask.
And now Draco lost it, the same hawthorn wand Harry had used back
"I'm ready," he says without looking. He glares at Potter in defiance before heading back to their ambulance. He probably closes the door with too much force.
If Harry didn't know better he would think that Malfoy was flustered… By him. He turned his head, looking for confirmation, and made eye contact with Hermione, who had raised her eyes from her book again and looked from him to Malfoy with narrowed eyes.
“What are you doing here?” the man stutters. Draco isn’t sure which of them he refers to.
“When?”
“I don’t do that,” he protested, but closed his eyes and settled more comfortably on the sofa. He wondered if what Draco really wanted to ask was if they still would be friends. Because Harry though that, without their previous prejudices, they had become ones.
Okay, make it four fingers of firewhiskey.
"No 'but', you're going to get me fired." He raises his voice and winces when Liam stirs on the sofa.
"What did he say?"
“Are you… are you sure about this?” he asks, trying to look nonchalant while he’s perched on the kitchen counter and sips his coffee.
"It was unfair!"
Harry moved brusquely. Draco felt a stab of agonizing pain in his chest, sharp and disorienting. He grunted in protest.
"I do. To help Harry properly. Harry, continue."
Draco opened his eyes and didn't reply immediately, sorting through all the reasons he couldn't answer in the affirmative. "It hurts.”
Draco frowns. “You mean Ginevra, the Weasley girl, stayed with you?”
“No shit,” he muttered in answer. Every cell in his body ached as proof of it.
“But that was only for six months.”
Maybe it was in that precise moment he started calling him Harry, even if it was only in his head.
“You stopped using my first name! You knew! Why did… what were you waiting for?” Malfoy closed his eyes and gulped. His muttered words didn’t reach Harry’s ears. “What did you say?”
“It’s usually Carl driving.”
"All the way up the hill, in an isolated cabin. There isn't supposed to be anyone else around. Maybe they have some wards set, or some confounding charms… Maybe it's not real."
“You knew!” Harry repeated. Malfoy opened and closed his mouth like a fish, unable to speak. “And you didn’t tell a thing!”
"What the hell!" he croaked between coughs. He eyed the coffee, then the sugar bowl. He glared at Malfoy. “Did you transfigured the sugar into salt?”
Potter snorts again. Seriously, at this rate he is going to hurt himself.
“I thought… It’s hard to believe, really.”
“But he's… Doctors says he's still in danger.”
"I suppose this is what they call karma," he said, offering his hand and pulling Harry up. He kept smiling and didn't let go of it when Harry stood on his feet. Harry suspected he was extremely amused at his expense, but he had a nice smile and Harry was distracted by his eyes to really care; he couldn't make the exact colour in the dim light of the street. "I'm Draco, Draco Malfoy."
"Just in case we get hungry."
Ahead on the muddy path, a little cloaked figure appeared briefly before disappearing again between the trees.
They arrive in front of a door, near the end of the corridor, and Potter knocks. His uncle opens the door and narrows his eyes. He opens his mouth to spit out some rash comment, Draco is sure, when he spots him behind his nephew and blanches.
“Sit with us.” Sirius voice rang out loud and clear a moment later. He didn’t even have time to glare at his friend before a body was squeezed in next to him.  He smelt the shock on the new kid at being pulled down, and he was a little surprised when the kid went willingly and accepted Siri’s manhandling.
“Library.”
Lunch went by surprisingly well right up until Lupin told Black he couldn’t come with them to the meeting.
It seemed even through his glamours the magic in the family mark recognized him. He was going to have to get Mafloy to teach him how to add it to his own stuff when they got home.
Draco thought to himself. His laugh died in his throat.
“They never cut their prisoners. You have cuts all down your arms,” Potter said, gesturing toward Draco’s sliced arms. Draco didn’t look Potter in the eyes and focused on his shoes instead of answering the question.
“I wanted to see if you were okay," Potter confessed quietly.
"Hello? Potter? My face is up here,” Draco tried to say again, this time his voice cracking slightly. He tried not to be too embarrassed. No one expects prisoners in Azkaban to look like models.
“What the hell happened to you, Malfoy?” Potter whispered, his eyes widening as he finally met Draco’s eyes.  The concern in his voice reminded of his dead mother. Draco, astonished, blinked furiously.
He never had so much unloaded on him at once and Potter was looking at him so hopelessly lost.
Two months wasn’t long for many but, within the first day of his Azkaban stay, Draco felt insanity dance in his head. The dementors neared every time he tried to have hope. Darkness enveloped him into an endless void. He could barely get himself to eat. Kadence, one of the three keepers that took care of the prisoners, updated him on what went on outside of Azkaban. He did it to taunt him but, Draco didn’t care enough to let that bother him. He flung Prophet stories and pictures of his dead friends and family into his cell. Draco had nearly fell as he scrambled like a rat to get them the other day.
“Because what?” Draco pressed.
“What?” Draco replied flatly. Kadence usually thought of more believable pranks. He turned to face the keeper.
Almost minutes after the Dark Lord’s defeat, the Ministry regrouped and attacked the remaining Death Eaters. The Malfoys, Lestranges and others were sentenced to imprisonment in Azkaban. Including him.
he reminded himself. His petty hostility toward Potter didn’t seem so important after he faced the Dark Lord. After Potter not only tried saving him from the Dark Lord but, also from sentencing as he claimed that Draco was a pawn and could have easily been manipulated into following the Dark Lord, it was quite impossible to hate him. He had been almost too kind of Draco, leaving a bitter taste on his tongue every time he thought about it. It was as though Draco now owed Potter.
“Clearly no one else is so, why not me?” Potter answered, suddenly with harshness.
As his grin grew wider, his plumb tears fell onto his tattered clothes. Draco was sure puddles of tears fell on either side of him as well. Suddenly, a loud clanking sound resounded from the bars of his cell. Draco slowly teared open his teary eyes and glanced over at the bars of his cell to see Kadence standing there, bothering his misery. His towering, lean figure wouldn’t have been terrifying if he wasn’t the only person Draco ever got to see. He had dreamt many times of him being the last person Draco ever saw before he was hanged. His midnight black robes hung on him awkwardly and his wand looked more like a knife. The hood of the robes covered his eyes, revealing only his sharp jawline. It only made him look more like the Grim Reaper Draco thought of him as.
“Famous Harry Potter can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page. So, how did he make it inside Azkaban without a trail of his fan girls to protect from the o’ so scary dementors?” he taunted, his voice scratchy from the lack of its use. Potter, dressed in red robes (
“Well?” he asked. Draco stared at him for a long moment. Then, he dragged his chains across the white floor as he walked toward Potter. He sat down and stared at his feet.
“What do you want?” Draco barely uttered, his tears choking his every word.
, Draco thought) and wearing his hair as ruffled as usual, stared at Draco, not even looking at his face despite the taunt. Potter’s eyes raked Draco’s whole body. Draco shifted from side to side nervously.
“What do I understand exactly?”
Potter walked over to one of the steel table that was placed in the center of the room and dragged out the chair under the table to sit on it. He held his head in his hands. He looked in more distress than ever. Alone.
“Because.”
So, as he dug into his own skin with his sharp nails, he felt more relief than pain seeing blood trail his nails. At least, Mum and Father don’t need to live in this terrible hell anymore. Execution has some benefits. Tears ran down his pale face, creating streaks on his grimy face. It didn’t matter who saw him cry anymore. Goyle has been killed by the Dark Lord shortly after Potter was said to be dead and Crabbe died a pitiful death. He mourned their deaths as the only true friends he ever had. No one was left to care. No one was left to know. The old Draco Malfoy wanted his family back. The old Draco Malfoy wanted his life back. The old Draco Malfoy didn’t want to hurt anyone. But, he knew some people didn’t deserve redemption.
"Potter," Draco said, reaching out to shake Harry's arm.
“Monday," he blurts. "The potion will be ready by Monday.” Potter’s face lights up, and Draco tries not to preen. “Two doses. If… if it works properly, I can do more. It will work, of course,” he adds hurriedly just in case Potter thinks ill of him.
Until the bane of his existence appeared in one of the Slytherin stands, that is. He ignored him for a good half an hour until his fingers were cold and his ass numb. And after that, he went directly to floor level; if Malfoy wanted to apologize, Harry wasn't going to make it easy for him.
“Is it working?”
“I can live with the mystery. Besides,” he says, turning in the direction of the doors, picking his book on the way, “I’m knackered, my shift is over and I have an early shift tomorrow so… see you around I guess.” He says waving the hand with his book.
“Ok, since you are here, I need you to tell me about any allergies, any treatments, medical history…” Draco trails off while checking monitors.
"So Granger put a location charm on that pouch in case we got in trouble?"
“I didn’t cheat. I passed. Until I messed it up at the end and… then, they failed me. Temporarily.” Potter raised his eyebrows and that was almost enough to crumble Draco’s resolution of not telling the whole truth. Almost. Because Potter doesn’t need to know that the sudden appearance of a cyclist made him push the brakes so suddenly that the examiner hit his head with a sickening thud, and he had to obliviate him, not for the quickly growing bump in his head, but for the fact that the cyclist was floating two feet in the air, confused but safe. So, he got his license but he hasn't been able to drive since then. “I panic just thinking of driving.”
“Shut up.”
Then Harry blinked and turned his attention back to the door. Draco felt off-balance, as if something had changed right then and there.
“Happy?” Harry startled. He had been so lost in his thoughts that he hadn’t seen the source of his distress approach. Malfoy continued, unaware of how the dancing had lit his face with a healthy blush. “You should be. I’ve gave them enough material to be on the frontpage tomorrow. My mother will be thrilled, until I clarify to her that there’s not even a tiny possibility for Astoria and me to get together again.” He said with a toothy grin, like sharing a internal joke that Harry was hardly getting, actually, but who could blame him; he was too distracted with Malfoy’s hair - the braid was half undone, the dance must been enthusiastic - and trying to control the fluters on his belly.
“Am I?”
“That was Carl,” Potter says, signaling the way the ambulance drove away.
Potter grimaces. “She's angry with me.”
At this rate, he is going to have to administer some tranquilizer to the mother.
“I told you, I want to help him. He’s family after all, and even when he was mean to me back then, in part it was because of my aunt and my uncle’s influence.” He pauses. “We have even talked about it, he said he realised it was wrong.” He pauses again. Draco suspects telling him about this is not easy. “He’s not good at talking, you know? But he tries. He even said once that I’m not a waste of space. That’s more kind words than his parents have said to me, ever.”
“Good night, Draco.”
"My baby, my poor boy."
"Did you transfigure your clothes into an EMT uniform?" Draco asks.
Harry raised his hands, helpless. “What are we going to do to fix this?”
“How do you feel?” Harry asked.
“I wonder how you haven’t broken the statute of secrecy already,” the git says with a lopsided grin.
“I saved it on your phone, you dumbass.”
"What gave me away?" Draco says, looking down at his uniform.
"I work here."
"Sorry.”
“Is it?” Draco watches him sideways before looking away at the darkening sky. “I guess it is.” He concedes.
Weasley’s eyes widened. "You found one? Here?"
"I'm not — I think we should call for backup."
“Wait, isn't that Weasley girl the one that is... That were… erm, weren't Potter and her dating?”
“If you hinder me…”
Harry flashed him a tight smile and took a mouthful of his coffee. Merlin he needed it if he had to put up with the insufferable git.
Draco let him sulk for a bit, then his resolve faltered. "I admit the strength of your slug-vomiting charm is impressive," Draco mumbled.
Draco blinks slowly. “You want to use them on your cousin.” Is not a question, more an instant realisation that finds its way to Draco’s traitorous mouth.
He suspected that even when she complained about the futility of Divination, she believed that Weasley had an involuntary knack for it.
It was Harry’s turn to frown. “What do you mean? Why wouldn’t I care?”
“Uh?”
“Why would he?” she asks sipping at her tea. Draco blinks, confused.
Harry burst laughing. “None taken, you’re right, but I insist. Better have karma on my side.”
"Let's check," Harry said, starting to walk towards the edge of the forest
“What are you doing?”
“Horrible childhood. I moved on.” Harry stated matter of factly.
"Where is Draco?" Harry interrupted. Everyone went silent. Harry blinked, fear rising in his throat
Harry, satisfied with finding no damage, started to prod his torso. He brushed a rib, and Draco flinched. That made Harry freeze. His touch had been soft, but it hurt, nonetheless.
"He does that?" Hermione asked concerned.
He walked to the nearest shop that opened at that ungodly hours and bought all that he needed… for a month.
Draco turns to Potter with a scowl, and the idiot just raises his thumb and goes to sit on Draco's favoured couch. The prick.
Draco shrugs. “Why not?”
Draco made the effort and, for a moment, feared he would pass out cold. One moment he felt the weight of the clothes over his shoulders and the next, not really knowing how, he found himself hauled up and resting uncomfortably on Harry's back. Uncomfortably, because everything
Draco wouldn't mind going for a pint with the lot of them, though. Well, with Harry, at least. A normal Friday involved pubs, didn’t it? He doubted that Harry’s friends would welcome him, though, so he'd never asked. Harry had never offered, either.
Draco’s face was half-hidden in the shadow but Harry could tell that he had raised an eyebrow. “Mine and half of the neighbourhood’s, apparently. Don’t you know how to make a call?”
"Sure."
"Not the point!" Edith bellowed.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Precisely." He stressed, but his mocking grin softened the edge of his words.
"You didn't show up yesterday."
"I've never denied that, you prick," Potter says, rolling his eyes, but Draco can tell he's fighting a smile. That's a novelty. "Anyway, sorry about this… outburst."
Draco scoffed again. "Haven't you had lunch?"
“What was that for?” he protest, blinking.
“Where’s the man injured?” Liam asks, beating Draco’s thoughts.
"Maybe he's under a spell or a potion," Ron said, and Harry's face fell.
“Ok.”
“Of course, I did.”
“All the bad bits and all?”
“Your point?”
It seemed unlikely, but… Harry smiled slowly. This could be interesting.
“Me too.”
“It seems there was a mistake,” Draco says, the lie leaving his lips before he can stop it, “his training doesn’t start until next week.”
From the corner of his eye, Draco could see Potter and Weasley frozen in their chairs, each at either side of Potter’s desk, food halfway to their mouths. It should be past midday, then. That explained the emptiness in Draco's stomach — that and the remnants of fear.
“We need to take him to the hospital, asap. Where the hell is Liam?”
Harry frown deepened. It was the first time Draco called him by his surname. “Of course I do,” he said in all seriousness. “We are… friends.” Didn’t Draco consider him his friend?
"Sneaky bastard…" Harry couldn't help but smile.
“Just for blackmail. In case you want to divulge my good actions. I have a reputation to maintain.”
"This doesn't make sense."
Draco covers his face with his hands and breaths in slowly before releasing the air in a huff. "Ok," he mutters between his fingers, "stop it right there, you're not going to do whatever you are planning, no way."
"Pleased to meet you, Harry Potter. Now if you excuse me, I need to find my dog."
Harry pointed his wand at the runes.
Potter shrugs. “It’s not your fault they are… like that.”
Draco protested weakly when Harry manhandled him into a sitting position and started to undress him. He felt disconcertingly dizzy and clumsy; everything hurt, his chest most of all.
"When are you going to get your shit together so we can take turns driving?"
“But not here.”
At their confused expressions, he pointedly looked down again.
“Got it,” Potter says and disappears.
He was like a ragdoll. A ragdoll that could puke if treated too roughly. He hoped he wouldn't though. He wouldn't hear the end of it. And he would be endlessly embarrassed.
“Hey, newbie,” Liam says, and Draco tenses. “Help me out here,” he says, signalling the dislocated shoulder. Draco looks at Potter in panic but he passes by Draco close enough for him to hear some muttered words.
Harry had lingered at the table, not wanting to go back with the others. Well, not with Malfoy specifically, but still.
He let Harry glare at him, a comfort of sorts. He wouldn’t mistreat a colleague on the brink of death, right? So maybe he wasn’t dying. When the glare morphed into something different, and Harry clenched his jaw as if trying to control himself, Draco felt compelled to talk. “Okay, everything hurts, my chest and my head more than anything else. I’m dizzy and I —” He coughed “— I would kill for a drink.”
He went to the classroom, mentally preparing himself to endure the company of the pointy git. What he didn't expect when he opened the door was a bunch of screaming teenagers, well… kids - really, was he so small at their ages? - that lost their shit when they saw him.
“Did you?” Harry straightened up and went inside looking for his device. “You did,” he muttered moments later when he found a new name between his sparse contacts. He dialled and went back to the window. Draco appeared a moment later holding a phone. “Hey,” he said before the other man could speak.
"Malfoy."
Potter stares at him with a raised eyebrow and Draco revisits his words. He winces inwardly. That sounded different in his head, he didn't mean…
"Mr Potter?"
“Stop acting like it and maybe one day I’ll believe you." He paused. "And I didn't mean it like that, you sensitive prick."
"Shut up, Malfoy. You're gonna be fine. I'm not going to let you die."
Then a loud noise startled completely awake.
When his alarm clock went off he thought that it had to be a mistake. He was tired and absolutely not ready to be out of bed.
“You studied for it.”
"What I don't understand," Draco said, licking his lips and looking up to the ceiling in his room in Saint Mungo's, "is why I'm so battered and you don't have more than a scratch."
"I'm on it," he lies. Honestly, the last time he entertained the idea of driving, he had a meltdown.
. On the condition that he used it for
Draco understood nevertheless: Be careful.
“I can help you,” he blurts.
Everything happened too quickly and too slowly at the same time: the runes lit and the ingrained charm splintered the door, and, to Draco's horror, Harry's wand. A warning died in his throat when he felt the blast hitting him, and the anguish of losing the grip on his wand was nothing compared with the fear at the sensation of losing balance and falling.
Harry shrugged. "Maybe the man is a chatter and will hold us up way longer than expected. Maybe I get hungry in the middle of the way there."
“What if I like it here?” Malfoy asked.
With the patient secured at the back, Draco is about to close the doors when Mrs Dursley jumps forward and grabs his wrist.
Hermione sighed. "Grow up, Ronald."
They talked over a hot mug, Draco sitting in a comfy armchair and Harry slowly spreading on the huge sofa. Scarhead found an acceptable place for himself lying on Harry's legs.
Draco kneels next to the man. He breathes, good, but the pulse is weak. He assesses the severity of the wounds and starts to work on them quickly after immobilising his neck. When Potter kneels next to him, he takes his hand and puts it over a compress on a bleeding wound and keeps taking care of the rest.
He had gained a reputation as a very competent potioneer, though. That’s why his modest business was flourishing.
"Oh, yeah, I… here," Draco says, handing them out. He berates himself, he doesn't stammer. He needs a retort. "Some things don't change, does it?" he means the ugly wired thing but Potter is on another track.
“Yes.”
“I’m here you drama queen,” he says, positioning the stretcher next to the limp body of the injured man.
That's why he drops his book and rushes to catch Potter and take him aside, to a more discreet place.
Harry stared at him a little longer and convinced himself that he was beyond the phase of suspecting Malfoy's every intention. Then he reached for the jar and the moment he touched it, a stuffed snake pounced at his face, making him nearly jump out of his skin. He feared his heart would bounce out of his mouth.
“And they didn’t know a thing about magic?”
"Ha! Longbottom is a menace.” He quipped. The young Herbology Professor was intense whenever someone mentioned his “field of expertise,” but Draco thought he wouldn't mind listening to that. It would be useful to know. Although, he supposed that wasn't interesting enough for a pub night conversation, or was it?
"I came to tell you we have a group meeting in fifteen minutes. We need to discuss what are we going to tell McGonagall tomorrow. She wants to discuss our progress, apparently."
"I saw it."
“Mine was a happy one. But here’s the thing: there’s nothing for me to come back to.”
Harry squeezed him a bit and then, something dawned on him.
"I'm going to help you." He says, taking his invisibility cloak off, and Draco lets his jaw hang in an unflattering manner. He can hear his mother chastising him inside his head but he's sure he has a good reason.
Harry waved at him, apologetic, and run down the street to the place he parked last night.
“I came to help,” Potter says. His jaw is tense, and Draco can feel subtle waves of magic emanating from him.
"It was chaos, mate. All that fumes and… stuff in that shop."
“What’s — ? You idiot. I thought you had stopped breathing.”
"What? That's…!"
When he approaches, her face has a healthier tinge, probably because Liam has given her some painkillers and the pain in her shoulder has diminished. Potter is crouched beside him, handing him an antiseptic and looking interested in all the proceedings.
"Ah, yes, yes, Dudders may have his number." She adjusts her reading glasses again and gasps when she finds the correct number. She hits it hard and puts the phone in her right ear while she bites the nail of her thumb. Her hand trembles and her voice wavers when someone picks up. The conversation is short and strained. No pleasantries. They agree to meet at the hospital. No goodbyes.
Draco’s mouth turns upwards without his consent. "Monday, then?"
“Since that night I saw you save that man’s life,” Harry repeats approaching him with a mischievous smile.
The rest of the shift passes in a blur between attending the emergency calls and fighting his anguish. By the time it's about to end, he has almost managed to forget about Potter.
He even liked the git. Like…
"Sorry, I didn't intend to scare you," Potter whispers.
Defeated, Harry hunched his shoulders and tried again with a wandless
“Say what you want, but you should take them off.”
Draco sat at his desk, a cold cloth pressed over his black eye, soothing and effectively blocking the glares from Edith and the other Aurors.
Harry put Draco's outer robes in front of the fire, now burning with all the might that the humid branches could provide. He did the same with the heavy Auror robes, leaving Draco in nothing more than his thin, tailored shirt.
The new year ball was a raging success. They had raised enough money for the orphans; and to Harry's delight, he had successfully avoided being photographed (and paired) with yet another single attendant by the Witch Weekly reporters. Or being accosted by Rita Skeeter to gather juicing details of his private life for another scathing article on the Prophet.
The sound of his fist over the door echoed loud in the corridor. A beat later, the door opened.
to another case.”
Draco snorts at that. "No shit."
For the fourth night in a row, Harry sat on the bed wide awake while the stars shone merrily in the sky, the unsettling dreams already forgotten. He should have gone back to sleep, but he felt like he needed to be in another place entirely.
"Explain it to me, 'Mione", Ron demanded when they were both alone.
Harry put his mug aside and opened his window. The chill of the night made him shiver, his thin pyjamas not nearly enough protection against the cold winter air. He was tempted to yell, but the possibility of having to face the rage of the neighbours stopped him. Barely. He looked around for an alternative and came back with a bowl of sugar cubes.
“Uh, I… don’t think this is so difficult Potter: you open the phial and makes him drink it. If the result is as expected, repeat until total recovery.”
"Robards said they used Veritaserum. I don’t think…” Harry turned to look at him. He frowned, but didn’t say anything before walking towards the building.
"Potter."
“Your robes, they're damp.”
“What?”
No, definitely not telling.
"Miss Dursley, I need some space to secure your son on the stretcher so we can get him into the ambulance."
"What happened?" Harry asked.
"Mr Weasley, this is a place for recovering, we need to be quiet," the healer, a diminutive witch, pleaded.
"How kind of you, thinking about my well-being."
"But he played dirty."
Considering the fact that Potter has appeared in what he thought was a safe place, a place where he didn’t have to hide, didn’t have to expect constant disdain; that some ill intended words from him to the wrong people could ruin Draco's carefully built present life… Well, he is ‘ecstatic’.
“Excuse me, sir, you can’t smoke here,” Draco says startling both of them.
Harry was still sitting in the same spot he was when Draco had slumped onto his side and closed his eyes, vaguely thinking that it was only going to be for a tiny second. The light was dimmer, so either the blizzard was raging out there, or much time had passed since they’d found shelter in the shallow cave.
“Prat.”
An ugly feeling rises in his chest; for all the banter, and fight, and hurt they have inflicted each other, he feels, he knows, that Potter deserves the world. Draco is shocked nonetheless when a wave of protectiveness threatens to choke him.
, but Draco knew he was to blame too. Somehow Harry's Gryffindor recklessness was contagious.
-o-o-
Potter opens his eyes and cocks his head, watching him with an honest expression. "Truth is, I would like to do something. Dudley is the only one with enough decency to have apologized, and he’s family after all. But I'm not a healer, and I'm pants at potions."
“I don’t want to go back from… wherever we are.”
at their disposal.
"Potter, can you lend me a hand?"
Potter smiles and closes the gap between them. The kiss is quick, and Draco is so surprised that his brain is trying to catch up when Potter moves away, looking apologetic.
Draco’s heart does an uncomfortable flip on its place and he disguises his blush fixing his hair. “Of course you do, you’ve even kissed me. I suspected that much, Potter.”
"Could you just be silent? Wait, who are you?" Liam asks pointing at Potter with an accusatory finger as if he's the cause of all his troubles. Draco's mind is blank, so Potter beats him answering.
“Hello, Katie. Can I take a look while my partner here helps you with that shoulder? I just want to be sure that your kid is alright.” She nods and let him take the small bundle in his arms. “His name is Connor,” she says, her hands lingering, still reluctant to let him go. Draco smiles and gets up to take him to the back of the ambulance, to take a look without going out of her sight but not close enough for her to see any worrying injury.
“You heard me, Malfoy.” Robards had that no-nonsense tone that always put Draco on guard and made him feel like he was treading in dangerous waters.
He expects Potter to shout at him and jump at every potential danger, instead, he’s silent but alert. Draco suspects he casts a wordless cushioning charm once or twice, or at least he thinks he can feel the tingle of Potter’s magic on his skin. The git is more than capable of it, even when Draco wouldn’t admit that much, not aloud anyway. He‘s definitely sure that he levitates a cat who jumps onto the road from Merlin knows where, bouncing it to safety.
“What?”
Since his divorce, the magazine had made a headline in every occasion he talked with someone in public more than half an hour at a time.
Suddenly Potter's head appears in mid air and he wonders if he's losing his mind when a sense of deja vu fills him.
. Before she gets back to her senses, Draco makes some quick evaluations using magic.
“If there’s another emergency before he comes back, I have to go with Liam, and he stated last time that it was definitely
Draco fights the sensation of failure when they met again, because really, it is what it is, but the eager look on Potter makes him feel guilty for coming empty handed.
“I don’t have your number.”
And let me tell you, there are plenty of things to cause damage. Merlin, they are vulnerable. They aren’t weak, as one would have expected, but in some sense, they are reckless, they act as if they have
“What does it do, exactly?” he asks looking at the phial in his hand.
"I'm going to study for this."
Consciousness came back slowly. Harry reached for the blanket but his hands only grabbed a soft bed sheet, the heavy weight of Scarhead was gone, he wondered if he had moved to a bed at one moment in the night.
"Nah, nah, nah!" Ron chanted loudly, sticking his fingers in his ears.
Harry quickly copied down the instructions. He could hear Snape moving next to him, but he didn’t let his attention wonder. He wanted to pass this class. He wanted for once to prove that he wasn’t as horrible at potions as everyone said.
The Goblin lifted his arm and waved his hand, from up to down.
“I think we are going to have to meet back here again tonight with are schedules to set up a time.”
When his eyes started to hurt from reading, he put the book down and looked at the bed, then at the bathroom. It had been in the back of his mind all day that there was only a single bed in the room and that at some point, they would either fight over who got it or ended up sharing it. It wasn’t really sure which he preferred, but he knew he didn’t want to sleep on the floor.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?”
Harry had been silent since they entered the library. The Gryffindor had spent the first 20 minutes or so searching the rows of books for any on submissives or inheritances. He found only one, Draco had seen the frustration on the other teens face when he grabbed the single book and slunk away to the back of the library where he wouldn’t be bothered as he read it.
He glared at the letter.
“Mister Malfoy,” He said, stepping away from his brother, “Sir, do you know what this is about?”
He thought about if for a second.
He grabbed the cauldron and filled it halfway with water then placed it over the fire. The heat set to low, like the instructions said. And prayed he didn’t mess this up. Snape returned placing the ingredients on their table. This time he looked at Harry.
What made Owen perfect for Remus and Draco’s plan was the man’s clear hatred for The Boy Who Lived as well as Dark Wizards. Harry had shivered when he read the man’s interview from last year. He blamed Harry for not killing the Dark Lord correctly when he was supposed to, and even stated he was only back because Harry had failed again at stopping him. He was the ideal, as someone who would want to kidnap both Harry and Draco.
he really should have told him, Draco was going to be mad about him keeping secrets, not that he meant to, it just slipped his mind.
, Draco would have said something before. After all they had known this was going to happen right?
In the week that they two had been missing the wizarding world have been buzzing with every theory possible. From star crossed lovers, to Draco kidnapping and enslaving Potter for the Dark Lord. And while Severus had gotten a good laugh at most theories, he was starting to worry about his godson.Lucius hadn’t heard from his son and his old friend had assured him neither had his wife.
And so far it hadn’t come back up again. Hence him not wanting to have a repeat the next morning.
Harry’s blood ran cold, he was looking at Tom, really looking at him. Not only had the man not recognized him but he looked better. Younger, less grey hair and wrinkles. But that couldn’t be right. This was wrong, it had to be some kind of trick, because the only thing coming to mind about what could possible be happening, was to weird even for him.
“No one knows how close we are to Harry.” The other said, grinning.
“What did just happen?” Blaise asked once everyone one seated.
“What happened?” Potter asked after he stopped swaying on his feet.
“Please Mister Potter, to the center of the room.” Igorth said with a wave of his hand.
Okay now he was curious. He stepped back from Malfoy so he could see everyone in the circle.
“Do you think they will sort us in front of everyone?” He asked in a panicked voice as they walked.
He opened the letter.
So this chapter hasn't been beta read yet. I'm posting it for now and will add the corrected version when it's done.
“That’s what I thought.” He said and sped up his walking.
He asked without words.
They looked at each other, questioning what could make the goblin look like that. But neither voiced it in fear of upsetting the goblin more.
He nodded his head. “Yeah. They don’t really show emotion. So, he trends to do things in weird ways. He probably figured I would yell at him to get lost, if he came. Which I guess I would have. So, he sent you.”
“Of course.” Malfoy said, then like the day before he was up and moving towards the door, just expected Harry to follow him. He was so very tempted not to move, but the need for money out weighted him messing with the blonde, so he pushed himself off the bed and followed.
He leaned against the stone railing.
The blonde help himself straight in his chair, “I need to gain access to my family’s vaults.”
“I’m not nice, Potter.” Then he watched as the blonde’s shoulders sagged, “But I’m not cruel,” His eyes opened and glared at him, “and I’m not a dark Wizard.”
Harry swayed on his feet as the world spun. He felt someone catch him as his legs gave out.
He watched as Malfoy talked and paid for the books, as he watched he remembered that despite all the pureblood’s childishness and pranks, he was one of the smartest kids in their year. He heard Hermione complained more then once that Malfoy was top in potions and Transfiguration, and barley behind her in Charms. She hated that anyone could possible be as smart as her and insisted that he was cheating.
The two adults look at each other. “It should,” said Remus.
Thump!
Hope and excitement surged through him as he opened it.
“Professor!” He called. He actually head the man sigh as he stopped and turned around.
For the first time in his life he had a
Charlie’s breath caught, George’s eyes had shifted to a deep blue, they seemed to reflect all the light in the room.
“Cut this in half and then add it to the cauldron.” Snape said, then added, “And it matters when you would rather partner with a Slytherin then one of your own housemates.”
If him and Malfoy went to Hogwarts, here in the past, they would be in the same school, possibly the same houses and classes as their parents. His parents. The two people he had dreamed and imagined meeting so many times in his life, the same two people that died because of a fucked up prophecy and a power hungry madman, how could he be here, around them and not warn them of what was to come.
Sorry this is short and that it took forever. I'm been stuck in a writing rut, not just on this story but my others as well. Life's been a mess lately and that just makes it harder to sit down and get the words going. This chapter is unbeta'd so please feel free to point out mistakes, especially if its 'Amerlia' because for some reason when I type Amelia Bones I had a freak R haha.
Remus's wolf, Moony, growled at the man’s back. They both knew the man was following them, him and his friend Snape had both taken turns watching him for months now. It made him uneasy, he was sure they knew what he was but neither of them said a word. Just kept following him.
He took his time going to the bathroom, letting his mind wake up. Then he rinsed his hands and face and left the bathroom. When he sat at the table. He noticed a small roll of parchment in the center and reached out a grabbed it.
“I’ll fire call him.” George said, standing up and walking into their bed room were the fireplace was.
“I brought him, Severus.” Malfoy said, moving past Fred and Remus to stand by his friend.
“What is this about?” He turned to ask the goblin.
The first landed proudly on his feet. While the second hit the ground hard enough to have the air knocked out of him. Remus ears picked up the grunt that followed. He quickly moved to help the young man up.
“Okay, you guys have to tell me what's going on?” He said handing the papers to George.
His godfather opened his mouth, but Remus elbowed him. Harry watched as the two men had a silent argument. Then Sirius pushed his food away and left the table. There was a sigh before Remus got up and chased after his friend.
“Hey Bill.” They said together faking smiles. Though Bill didn’t look like he bought them, concern spreading across his face. He looked over at Charlie, who dropped his head, looking away.
George was starting to wonder two things, how far he and his brother could push flirting with the young Slytherin sitting on their couch before Snape snapped and murdered them and if they should just assume that the elder Malfoy wasn’t coming and start.
"Of course, Professor. I'll head that way now."
“Come on.” Luke muttered, interrupting Remus’s panic. He slumped forward listening as they walked away.
So, he got up and got dressed.
“Anyways, I believe I should be able to read the letter out loud to Sirius. Then he can go make lunch in the kitchen while you give me the rest of the details.” He agreed that it would work, he thought about saying no, just because Black hadn’t been named in letter, not as friend or enemy. But Lupin seemed determined and he could always wipe the man’s memory later, if needed.
“Yes.” Lupin said low, and Lucius could hear the growl buried beneath the word, “Dumbledore knows. We have been trying for years to get him to call an emergency hearing. But he kept giving reason on why the timing wasn’t right.” The man sighed, “Now I’m thinking it’s because if Sirius was cleared, he would get all rights to Harry and it seems Dumbledore doesn’t want that.”
“Potter?” He half whispered, half cursed.
It does however bother me that instead of someone telling me of mistakes or errors, I get what feels like a put down and almost mocking sounding comment. I don't understand why, if you don't like the story, or you lose interest or find the writing horrible, you can stop reading it at anytime. There is no need to meanly inform me that you will no longer be reading my story. This story takes a lot of time and work and peoples comments genuinely make it worth it. But mean or upsetting comments can hurt. This is something I do for fun and entertainment, I don't earn anything past the happy feeling I get from writing and nice comments. So, please remember that when you guys leave comments.
Then didn’t speak again until they reached the 7
“Now,” he mumbled, “What the hell do I say?”
George cursed and eyed the bird. His eyes sparking with mischief and Fred knew that second, his twin was debating what would happen if he gave one to the bird.
“This is were you were hiding.” The blond muttered out as he moved passed to open the door.
Harry nodded, “Just feeling overwhelmed.”
Bill froze, “what?,” he asked in disbelief.
“A madman.”
“What do you mean?” Charlie asked, as he moved closer to his brother so he could feel the smooth scales. He wondered if Bill was bothered as the twins joined him and Percy. But when he looked up he saw only amusement.
new instincts I’ve got?”
“I do--” Mister Malfoy was cut off by the door open again, him and his brother turned to look at the door.
“Mister Potter, this is Igorth. If you will accompany him into the next room, he will place powerful glamour’s on you, as well as show you have to remove and maintain them. And Mister Malfoy, this is Saomur, he will stay here with you and do the same for you. I will go to send this off to the school and wait for a reply from the headmaster. It should not take long, as I have already owled him once telling him I may have two students for him.” With that the Goblin turned and left.
He swore there was a growl from the other teen, but when he looked back, there was no sound.
“Depends on what you are.” The blonde replied.
Although it left Harry feeling guilty, the man would be punished for a crime he didn’t commit, Sirius had told him that the man had gotten away with horrible things, beating and curses against dark wizards. All because he was an auror and said they were Death Eaters resisting arrest. It had been Remus that finally convinced Harry to go through with it. The werewolf had pulled him aside and showed him an article in the Prophet where Owen had insisted Sirius be killed on sight if found. That the ‘murderer’ was better off dead than sent back to Azkaban.
“What if us telling someone, messes up the future?” He asked as a distraction.
He shook his head and wondered if Evan did that every night. Counting and making sure they were all there before he relaxed and went to bed himself. He also wondered what else Evan did to comfort himself, while he was stuck in the bizarre situation. Remus would have to keep an eye out, hopefully he would find something he could to do help. He wasn’t sure he could tell Harry that he knew the truth, but maybe he could still find a way to make things a little easier on him.
Lucius however ignored the small exchange, “I swear.”
“But we miss him.” His two younger brothers finished together. Charlie sighed and stopped trying to sit up.
For several agonizing moments Harry just stood there and waited for someone to say something.
I have recently had my very one book, Malevolence professionally edited, and the cover art done. (which I love!). I still have a few things to do before I can self-publish, but I am close. (You guys should check out the first 6 chapters, posted on here.) I also have a second book, Rescued that is completely finished, (first 6 chapters are also on here.) but it still needs editing, (have to save up the money).
“Hey Remus.” He said smiling.
Darryl Owen was an auror that in recent years had made his hatred for Death Eaters very clear. He advocated for any and all Death Eaters to receive the dementor's kiss without going to Azkaban. He even tried to insist any wizards that were allegedly Death Eaters being kissed, starting that it was better to stop them now before they could do any harm. He even tried pushing laws against Dark Wizards. In the words of his mate, the man was a menace.
“Why don’t you just teach me?”
He sighed and stood from his chair, he couldn’t hide his library forever.
“Nothing,” Harry said shifting his feet a little. Maybe he should have thought about what to tell Draco before he rushed over here. He hadn’t even told the blonde that he had spoken to Snape about well anything, let alone about Voldemort and Lucius.
Chuckling softly, Harry closed his eyes and walked back and forth 3 times, thinking “
He was resting, not hiding, in his guest quarters when someone knocked on the door. He groaned. There were only two maybe three people that would seek him out, Draco was in class and no doubt the werewolf was in his own rooms, that left Severus.
Harry had wanted to agree with her but figured the teachers would have caught on by now if he had been cheating. And now, having Malfoy point out things he missed, important things, he was sure that Malfoy was more intelligent then he had thought.
He wanted to shout at the idiot Slytherin but instead just grabbed the bags and started going through them. He found one full of stuff that he hadn’t noticed Malfoy buy. Two shrunken trunks, a metal rack, he didn’t know for sure what it was called, two wrist holsters, and a pair of black boots.
“Let’s take this inside.” Lupin said, moving forward shoving his friend back into the hut. He followed them inside, wondering how the truth spell would react. He had been given permission to tell Lupin but not Black.
Of, course, Malfoy was walking next to him and looked unfazed but their journey. He wondered if the blonde had some kind of glamor up that hid, how he really looked. Harry was tempted to take out his wand and check, but he was to tired.
‘Well at least that got some kind of reaction,’ Draco thought.
Draco had grumbled as his godfather shoved a pile of clothes at him and told him to get dressed. Harry had chuckled, watching the two of them, then of course Remus came in and did the same to him.
Harry woke up the next morning surprisingly refreshed and comfortable. Not something he was used to giving the nightmare he normally suffers when he sleeps. He was tempted to just relax and fall back asleep, but he noticed that he was also warm and pressed against another warm body.
Horntail?” Snape asked sounded esaperated.
The blonde glared at him but lowered his wand.
He had been freaking out of the idea of being sorted again, he knew they hat had wanted to place him in Slytherin in his first year, what if this time, it did? What would he do? What would his parents think? Not that they would know it was him.
The two of them stood them staring for a few moments, Remus silently cursing the blonde because he was sure he was now late to meet the two students he was supposed to be showing in. And he really hoped the two young kids didn't wander off.
“We swear.” The twins said, getting a sigh from him, Lucius, and a chuckle from Blaise. Who then added, “I swear.” The circle glowed and then a box appeared at its center.
Charlie gestured to the sitting area and his brothers all sat down. Before he joined them he refilled his glass and handed Bill and Percy each one. Percy gave it a strange look and looked up at Charlie questioningly.
When he woke in the morning and tried to think about the details from his dreams, everything seemed fuzzy and hard to remember.
So someone commented saying the POV shifters are a little disorienting, anyone else having issues with them? I'm only doing that that way because there are small bits of information i feel are needed that can fill a chapter? Let me know. I'll try to do less of them.
He’d always imagined Hogwarts as a home, but it was nothing compared to this. Here he felt happy, content, and safe. He woke each morning excited to spend time with the others. A large part of him didn’t want to go back to school, he would rather stay here and spend time with his family. The thought of going back and having to pretend and fake his loyalty and friendships made him nauseous. He didn’t want to go back and be pulled into the headmasters game. He didn’t want to deal with his fake ex friends, or have to worry about Voldermort trying to kill him. He just wanted to stay here and be a normal magical teenager.
“I will not--”
Harry sighed.
He was holding a submissive, one that hadn’t quiet presented fully. Which wasn’t that strange but the fact that the young man seemed confused about it was. His family should have warned him about an inheritance if he had one and told him what to expect. He wanted to growl because sending a submissive out into the world without knowledge was a sure way for the young man to get hurt.
He shook him again, “Harry.” He tried this time, hoping the use of his real name would gare him awake. But again nothing happened. He debated just moving and letting Evan fall, he had done it to James and Sirius enough times he wouldn’t even feel bad about it, but instead he tried shaking him again.
he shook his head,
“It’s kinda cute.”
“Those are bindings.” The other teen reached out, he didn’t touch the spell work floating the air, but he didn’t seem to follow one single strand to see where it lead and then another. Harry watched him, “Can you break them?” He asked Igorth and Saomur.
Percy however must have known it because he groaned, “Makes sense,” then he blushed when all of the others looked at him. Charlie watched as Percy swallowed, “Azeban are one of the 13 Descended families. They are tricksters. If I remember correctly, troublesome and mischievous but never dangerous. Not unless they, their families, or mates are threatened.”
A hand appeared in front of him and he took it. Once on his feet he started running his hands down his robes trying to smooth them and get any dirt off them that might have found its way there from the floor.
Diary still sat there.
“It’s a good plan.” He said, watching as Potter drew into himself. Feet on the chair and arms over his knees.
Instead of saying anything he reached into his coat and pulled out the letter, then slide it across the table to the other man. Lupin looked unsure, but he picked it up and read it. It didn’t take long before the man looked up at him clearly confused, though it seemed the man was as smart as Lucius remembered because instead of demanding answers he stood up and grabbed his coat.
“What
Three days later...
"Thank you, my boy." The headmaster said and then turned and walked away. It was only after the headmaster was far enough away that he let out a sigh and started walking towards the front of the school.
His full attention was brought back to Evan when the other teens scent changed to an interesting mix of longing and worry. He almost turned around to see what the kid was up too, but Sirius was dropping Ivy into their potion and he had to lunge to stop it before it caused their potion to blow up. His friend huffed at him and he has to resist the urge to lecture him on causing trouble in class.
“Has this happened before?” Malfoy asked.
He could feel eyes on him as the first years seem to notice both him and Malfoy. But so far none of them got up the courage to speak to the obviously older boys. And Harry wasn’t really in the mood to talk to anyone. He was thinking over what Malfoy said, would it really be that easy, just ask the hat to place him in Gryffindor again.
“Mister Ellis, your turn.” He nodded to the professor and sat on the stool. He tried not to show his panic as she lowered the hat on to his head.
He was a ball of nerves as he paced his living room.
Malfoy was already kneeling on the floor whispering to his somewhat conscious son. The younger Malfoy looked a little out of it but seemed to understand his father because he held up his wrists and mumbled a few words back to him.
And the fact that he was doing so now, made him a little lightheaded, And the fact that it was because of Malfoy, made him dizzy. How was it, a person who had bullied him and made him miserable seemed to have more care or manners then his own blood.
“The Quibbler released an article about a week ago, talking about Sirius.” Hermione shot Luna a displeased look. “It accused the Ministry of mishandle his case.” She tisked, “While it was a lovely article, all it accomplished was antagonizing the Ministry.” Harry felt bad for the way she was talking about Luna, trying to make the younger girl feel bad about the article.
Half an hour later, he heard his name whispered and made his way towards where he could hear Malfoy moving around.
“Not as much fun.” Malfoy muttered.
He had a brief thought of making up some story, but then he remembered something he had read. The goblins at Gringotts, we not allowed to tell anyone what was said or done by one of their clients. So, here was someone they could actually tell about their problem and the Goblin couldn’t say a word to anyone without their permission.
There was also the small fact that having the two marauders and the twins in the same place for any real amount of time was the perfect grounds for a prank war. Harry and Draco had managed to avoid it for the most part, often by redirecting the trouble makers at each other.
“Why don’t we just tell someone?” Malfoy asked pushing his half empty bowl again.
Snape sighed at their twin speak but nodded. “I believe that would work. How about for Draco?” He asked looking back at Malfoy and Blaise.
There was more talked about after that, Grimmhook told them that he may have an idea for how to start their transfer, and that there was a spell he could perform to change their looks and magical signature, after that him and Malfoy filled out the paper work to gain access to their new vaults and left.
It showed just how thrown the other teen was, that he didn’t hesitate just picked up his stuff and followed Harry.
“Oh, just set a password of something of his.” He said with a shrug, hoping they bought his slight lie.
“Does that mean I call you Professor Malfoy in class?” The slytherin asked with an excited grin. Draco and Snape both groaned but Lucius chuckled.
He wasn’t sure what possessed him, but the words just came out, “Come on, cub gotta get up.”
He thought with a chuckle.
“No.” Malfoy whispered back, “The Dark lord, hasn’t attacked anyone for months.”
“We going?” George asked moving to stand next to him.
“Fine.” He whispered back.
“We used it to save Buckbeak.”
“We have to get up.” He heard Malfoy mutter from next to him.
So, I wasn't going to post this yet. Because I wrote most of it today, while i've had a headache, thank you pollen, but it's been a while since I put a new chapter up and I felt bad. So here it is. Hope it's not a mess. :)
Harry looked away from the book he hadn’t been reading to see Remus standing next to him.
“Luc, stop.” He ordered moving towards his friend, “You have no idea what you are swearing to. This could be a trap.”
“Shit, Potter.” Malfoy gasped and moved towards him.
“A couple months ago,” Bill started, “I caught Mum and Ron talking at an Order meeting. He was complaining about something and asked her if Dumbledore would fix it. She saw me walking in and shushed him. I tried later to ask him what it was about but he just shrugged me off.” Bill frowned, “It gave me a weird feeling.”
Hoping he didn’t regret this, he summoned the letter “Take me to him.”
Harry felt himself shrug, it could have been.
Sure it didn’t relieve all Harry’s guilt but it helped.
“Maybe that should be Harry’s choice?” George said with a shrug.
“My father's cloak,” Harry whispered. “It is or will be the only thing I inherit from him. Or the only thing I knew I inherited.”
“Pacing--”
“So, you’re the proof.” Luc said eyeing the twins, “That Potter and Draco are for some reason working together.”
“What kind of favor?” Charlie asked looking at George suspiciously. Fred snorted.
It was a bother, really, more than anything for the enquiry that followed from his teenager daughter. She demanded (quite reasonably) to be the first to know when his father found himself a partner.
as they called it.
“We’re still looking for the old man living in the other house. There’s a lot of debris and the structure could collapse, so we are working slow. The other affected house is empty, so…”
like him.
Harry, who had met Nicholas Flamel, wasn't impressed by the rumors; but now that he met the woman herself he wasn't sure what to think. She was small and fragile, her skin like parchment, but her dark eyes were lively and sharp.
“Would you?”
Draco hums distractedly. His patient's pulse is weakening. At this rate, he is not going to get to the hospital without help. He pats the man's pockets, picking keys and coins, and almost cheers when he finds a mobile phone in one of them.
“Are you asking as a Law Enforcement member or as a…” Draco was going to say a friend but stops himself in time. They have never been friends, far from it.
“Probably?” he says, his smile as broad as infuriating.
It’s not that he lacks the knowledge to treat a muggle, he has excelled all his exams, and he is as proud of his A grades as he had been of his Outstandings at Hogwarts; he has worked hard for his grades. He is still baffled by the Muggle world and has struggled with all the misunderstanding and nonsense, because seriously, there's so much nonsense. But he has found help and some unexpected friends.
He arrived at the common room just in time, a bit breathless, but in time. He spotted Seamus and Zabini already hunched over a couple of books. The supreme idiot was preparing himself a cup of coffee on the kitchenette - another privilege of the eighth year's students -, with his back to the door.
"Are you… okay?"
-o-o-
Draco huffs. “It’s not my fault that muggle customs are incomprehensible, and the available guides are incomplete and inaccurate.” He gives him a look out the corner of his eye when the idiot laughs.
At least his boots were their normal size. Thank Merlin for small mercies.
"Why would you… ?"
“You knew!” Harry yelled pushing Malfoy inside his flat.
Draco has had enough.
“Oh, no, we're just friends.”
Potter looked between the two of them.
“You called me Potter.”
Draco groans. Potter is not going to talk to him again if he has left thinking he has crossed a line Draco didn’t want to cross. And he’s not sure if he wants to but… he doesn’t want to close that door just yet, does he? He… may be interested… What could he lose? He’s not in the magical world anymore so is not like the scandal would follow him here, right? Draco shakes his head, he’s getting ahead of things. A kiss doesn’t mean that Potter would date him. Would Draco want to date Potter? Draco blushes. Ok, maybe.
Liam snorts. “Seriously, the Management is shit, doesn’t surprise me in the slightest.”
"Car struck, multiple fractures, head concussion, possible spinal injury. I made a puncture to ease the pressure before moving him. The pulse is weak but the heart hasn’t failed," he recites, aware of Potter's gaze on him. It's been ages, but suddenly he's back to his Hogwarts days, back to that feeling of inadequacy, of being judged. Back to those mixed feelings of embarrassment and gratitude on the day of his trial. But he’s got nothing to be embarrassed about now. He doesn't. He doesn't, but the warming feeling creeps to his face anyway. He lets his hair fall over his face.
“Er, yeah.” Harry watched as he moved purposefully to prepare two mugs.
The sight of Potter, alone in the dim lights, would accompany him until sleep would come two hours too late, his mind replaying the conversation over and over again. Damn him and his stupid face and his stupid… whole being. He lied when he said he could live with the mystery.
“If you were the one injured, wouldn’t you want your mother with you?” she says in a rush with pleading eyes. He wants to tell her that her son is unconscious and it doesn’t make a difference to him right now, but that could be counterproductive. He also wants to tell her that he might have to do CPR, or to take some invasive measure, or that her son could die before arriving to the hospital. Something must have shown in his face because she speaks again, her voice wavering. “If-if you were to die wouldn’t you want your mother to have the chance to hold your hand?”
“Shame on you, Potter. One would think the mighty Saviour could do some basic wandless magic,” Draco said, his voice ragged and weak. He tried very hard not to cough, fearing the sharp pain that would come with it.
“Harry himself.”
“Yeah. I soon found out about the good bits.”
"Well?"
“Good.”
“Who told you?”
“I believe he can’t ignore someone’s suffering.” She pauses for a beat. “He’ll always offer his help because he doesn’t trust anybody will step in to do it. He doesn’t like bullies, but he thinks… he thinks everybody needs a chance to change.”
"Merlin, yes. I can relax my facial muscles, finally," he said rubbing his hands over his face. "Having no filters is tiresome."
“Like a pack of erumpents have run all over me?”
They shook hands in front of Draco’s nose.
Hell, most days Draco didn’t even like himself.
Though maybe Harry meant it to have a double meaning. He searched those green eyes for clues but all he could see was mirth and something along the lines of
The coffee shoppe was not exactly the club after all.
“Well, good therapy session,” Draco drawled, slightly irritated, “I will be sure to send you the bill-”
“Potter,” Harry said, out of nowhere, filling the silence with a word that made about as much sense as wearing shorts in a snowstorm.
Draco privately thought that was absolutely something he would do but he knew better than to voice that idea. Turned out it didn’t matter anyway.
-“Blondes” by Waterparks
I liked you,” the man replied, “you can call me Oliver if you like.”
Without warning, Harry flipped them back over so he was on top. He pulled out, and Draco almost whined at the loss, before plunging back in at the exact right angle to hit that bundle of nerves inside Draco that made him want to scream and his toes curl.
Draco blinked, feeling Blaise’s eyes on him. “Meeting like what?” Draco blamed the alcohol for the lame response, even though he was only on his second pint.
“None of your fucking business.”
That was until Draco had noticed the rather substantial sum missing from his trust fund. Apparently Lucius hadn’t even found it in himself to use his own money to fix his problems. His mother was no better through all this though, as she took to bringing home lovers of Draco’s age just to spite her husband.
“Draco! It’s been far too long! Blaise said you two went to the pub last night. I am just so bummed I couldn’t join you, but I had to get this week’s footage shot and off to the editor for posting. So will I see you tonight to make up for it?”
‘Oh sure, Green Eyes would label those dates’ Draco thought, conveniently ignoring the ‘non-date’ part. ‘'What would they talk about?' Draco wondered. Out loud he asked, “So, our coffee shoppe meet-ups are dates?”
Harry laughed. “How about we switch off every other day?”
‘Finally?’ Draco gave Harry an odd look at that.
I don’t know if I can handle it. Maybe I did miss you. Perhaps I wanted to see you but I’m the bloody fucking CMO of mTech and when duty calls I have to tend to it. Maybe I thought of nothing but you all day long. And maybe now, sitting here at our wrong table with your laptop between us, wondering why you won’t even
“Didn’t you miss me?”
Oh. Draco didn’t know what to say to that. It’s not like they had set up a day and time for their date. It’s not like he’d asked Harry if he was going out of town. And it’s not like Harry had told him.
Draco felt his nerves fray and his bones turning to jelly when Harry finally moved back and into position. He stroked his cock a couple times before placing the swollen head against Draco's wet hole and pushing forward. Draco felt the moment his body relaxed enough to let Harry inside, and Harry filled him in one agonizingly slow but steady thrust.
Harry pressed his tongue against Draco’s lips, who gladly opened for him, welcoming the contact. Somehow, kissing Harry never seemed to get old, no matter how many times their lips met, it still always felt new and exciting, like something forbidden or daring, the discovering of a secret treasure.
Instead he picked up on the fourth ring.
He had just arrived at the restaurant for his planned date with Harry, and he was no closer to figuring any of these thoughts out.
It was naivety, Draco decided later, that convinced him everything was all right. Lucius’ response to the impending collapse had been bribes. The public had never gotten wind of their impending divorce because he had paid off the media to stay silent. A divorce that never happened due to the millions he had paid to Narcissa to stay. For a time, the Malfoy household had seemed poised to recover.
Harry laughed, “It’s a part of the same one as before,” he pressed, “one that you didn’t really answer I might add.”
And when he came later, pressed against the wall in the back of the club’s loo under the gaze of the wrong green eyes, he felt even dirtier than he had before.
when I easily could have had other ways to deal with the aspects of myself I wanted to defeat.”
. When they were in the coffee shoppe, or ice skating, or on a bloody
He was deliberately going to ignore the fact that, yes, in fact, Harry certainly was.
But Harry had made him feel warm.
Harry laughed at his sarcasm. “You’re such a wonderful git sometimes, you know that?”
But Harry wasn’t gone come morning.
And he’d been expecting the
Not that the first time had really been for no reason at all. And those green eyes. He thought back to his last hook-up and how wrong it had felt to look down and see blue eyes staring up at him. How long ago had that been?
,  the very power he can now use to destroy them.” Severus tilted his head as if he was thinking over what Luc has said.
“It is separated by known family and creature. If I don’t know what I am, I can’t read up on it.” Potter sighed and closed the book. “I skimmed over a few of them, but they are all different. I’ll check it out, and keep looking maybe I’ll be able to figure it out. Any luck?”
“No?” He answered unsure why it was important.
It took him awhile to figure out what he was going to do. He desperately wanted to help James. To save him from whatever happens. But Malfoy had been right. If he tried to change things, it could mean that Harry would never be born and how could he deny James his son. It broke his heart but he wouldn’t say anything. Though he still hopped to talk to Harry. Maybe if he had all the facts it would be easier. He doubted it but it gave him something to hold on it.
“Now go!” Charlie said, shoving him back towards the fireplace, “and George,” He looked at his brother an eyebrow raised, “You two be careful too.”
“Let me talk to Evan first.”
Fred saved his and George’s for last, ignore the three still in the box addressed to them and Snape with the number 2 and 3. Then he stood next to George, who he let open it. Because he wasn’t sure his nerves would have been able too. He took one last breath, hoping his little brother was okay, and read it.
“Well, hello dearies,” She said waving them over, “What can I do for you?” She asked. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye, Malfoy looked at him and then back at the women, it seemed the blonde was expected her to comment on Harry Potter being in her bar. Instead there was no look of recognition in her eyes. Giving Harry and horrible feeling in his stomach.
It was a couple of days after he had talked to Snape so the note made sense. But he had been expecting Lucius to tell Snape anything important and then Snape to tell him. He hadn’t planned on the man wanting to meet with him himself.
“ The Leaky Cauldron”.” He shouted.
“Evan.” He said shaking the hand.
He opened his eyes to see Snape helping Draco to a small loveseat, that hadn’t been there before. He pushed off the wall, he hadn’t realized he was leaning against, to move towards them. But his legs wobbled and if Sirius hadn’t appeared at his side catching him. He would have fell.
It felt like a small victory.
Abruptly the beat changed, slowed down a little. The lights spun around the club. Draco felt the bench dip as Blaise sat back down beside him and took a sip of his drink. Bottle service was the best way to ensure no one’s glass was ever dry or broken. A potentially expensive price to pay but Draco found it was well worth it.
“I told you last time. I will be happy just to learn your name.”
‘Since when did he squirm? What was
“Yes, Mother,” he answered, suddenly fighting off the urge to cry, his legs feeling heavy beneath him.
He shot Potter a look. He refused to think of him as Harry before he had a steaming hot cup of molten caffeine in his hands.
“Oh,” Harry breathed, pulling away for the briefest of seconds, “you like that?”
“Come in,” he called, watching as his secretary peered around the door frame. Draco remembered that she had a key.
‘Well, that certainly made one of them,’ Draco thought.
At that Harry let go of him and he fell to the floor on his arse. Flint threw up his hands. “Fine, fine, I’m going.” He gritted his teeth openly at Harry one last time before standing up and turning away.
“You-” Draco looked up over his coffee. “You better.” He settled on, his voice cutting out as he looked back down at the table.
not.” Harry’s voice was lower now. Almost sexy. Draco found himself suppressing a shudder. “But I’ve made up loads of stories about you. Damsel is only one of many possible roles.”
But, on the other hand, it was just his name. He told people his name all day long.
“You know, instead of assuming what I write, you could just
“You are infuriating.”
Well, almost. Very close to it. He watched, slightly mesmerized by the club’s lights, as Pansy and Blaise danced in front of their VIP booth. Her hips pressed against his, short skirt swinging to the music, bodies pressing together, heat and sweat building. He had only just removed himself from their private dance floor on the sidelines of the club, which hosted an elite few who could afford to be there.
“You can have all the sex you want,” Harry whispered huskily, “the way you made me cum last night-”
Stepping away from the bar, drink in hand, Draco made his way over to the glass railing that ran around the edge of the outdoor space, passing long, rectangular fire pits and the mid-century modern benches that surrounded them as they ran around the interior perimeter of the bar. Groups of trendy looking people sat on them, chatting over the music. Draco didn’t miss the lady who leaned forward as he passed, pushing her tits up at him as if they were for sale.
‘Damn it, couldn’t this man come up with better questions?’ Draco thought. Maybe that wasn’t fair of him. He did have his hand on the man’s cock. “Yeah,” he answered, lowering himself down, “I can always tell when someone is lying.”
Green eyes were looking at Draco like he was magical, and his hand was still on the back of Draco’s neck.
Harry pulled back and shut his laptop with one hand, his other never moving from Draco’s cheek. Warm green eyes looked into Draco’s as his thumb gently rubbed back and forth. “I missed you too.”
“Hey, shouldn’t I-”
Pulling back, Harry smiled. It was genuine and his eyes were bright as he said, “I’d really like that.”
Green eyes did widen, however, when the elevator doors closed and Draco's large open kitchen and living room came into view. The white curtains were drawn on the panoramic windows - as they were set to automatically do at this time of night unless Draco chose to reset them - but the silver and white kitchen, the light grey floors, the dark green leather couches and the silver coffee table, could be seen reflected back in Harry’s eyes as he took in his new surroundings.
But until that day, public transit it was. Which he was going to miss if he didn’t get his coffee right now. Why hadn't they completed his order? What was difficult about pouring a cup of their blond roast and adding a splash of soy milk?
with the latest tech team - let’s just say you want to steer clear of HR at this time-”
A voice at the back of his mind tried piping up to remind him that he hadn’t tried because
“Well?” Harry asked again, as Draco worked to get his racing mind under control.
Absolutely
“How old were you when you started writing?”
“Yeah, that’s what car-share services are for.”
Harry looked up at Draco. “Do you think you’ll ever try ice skating again now?”
“Is that a question?”
!” his mother’s voice was rising steadily through the phone now, “are you even listening to me?”
That was so deliciously hot there was no way in the world Draco could resist a request like that. Slowly he started to move his hips before driving himself faster, impaling himself over and over, angling himself so Harry brushed against his prostate, ecstasy radiating throughout his body.
“Love you too, Draco,” Pansy said in a mocking tone, cutting in to pull Blaise up and wrap her arm around his waist. “You ready?” she asked them both sweetly.
“Yup.” Harry smiled and held up his coffee cup. “And that’s another question. We only get one each remember?” he raised up his cup as if in salute before taking a long sip.
He worked with a bunch of imbeciles. No wonder he needed coffee. Honestly, he spent most of his day wondering if anyone at mTech could do
Green eyes lit up. “You- you mean that?”
“Anything you want,” Draco sighed, “it won’t matter. You won’t see me again after tonight.” If he even remembered the rest of tonight in the morning.
“In fact, the last person I dated was a woman. So, it’s actually been even longer since I’ve been on a date with a bloke.”
“It was nice to meet you,” he said, and with a tilt of his head he was gone, back to his table.
“Like hell I do,” Draco spat out bitterly.
“Yes.”
“Like hell you
Dinner was certainly morphing into a strange mixture of emotions, which only added to the growing list of complications that came from simply being around the other man. Draco didn't know how to feel about that, or anything else that involved Harry for that matter.
“Did we- have we ever talked about that?” Draco tried not to wince as he could hear his voice tick up nearly an octave in surprise, suddenly painfully aware that they
Of course, Draco recognized when he was being hit on. But really, what was it with men who had green eyes talking to him first for no reason whatsoever, anyhow?
“Ooh feisty - I like it!” the man pressed himself up against Draco as they danced to the music some before the man leaned down and forcefully captured his lips. It didn’t feel great, but Draco let it happen. Let himself be swept up in the sensation of someone kissing his lips.
it had been at the skating rink.
“Then when I got to middle school they made everyone enroll in an athletic club. Blaise wanted to try football. I kind of wanted to try gymnastics, but that wasn’t allowed. In the end I followed Blaise into football.” Draco blinked hard. “God, I hate football.”
“Guilty as charged,” the man confessed, “Boyd Seeker is my pen name.”
“I don’t
“Then- then why?” Draco stuttered. He could hear the whine in his own voice. He nearly winced at the sound.
He looked down at the message and deleted “plan”, replacing it instead with “know about” and hit send. Anger pressing on him like a ton of bricks, he took a minute to study the picture of them closer. Harry pressed up against him, both their eyes closed, appearing for the moment to be in their own little bubble, removed from the world and everyone else in it.
Harry smiled gently. “Alright then, I suppose I can concede defeat.”
The two men stared at each other. Like an overpowering tide, Draco thought he would drown in those eyes.
exactly? That I’m going to run when things get tough?” He leaned forward and planted a single loving kiss on Draco’s lips. “If you think that, you don’t know me at all.”
“Er- hi,” Weasley said in response, the tips of his ears going pink. “Nice to meet you. Finally.”
thought. It was bad enough that he was becoming dependent on this odd spot of serenity in his day.
When he walked back by Harry's table, which oddly wasn't their usual spot but instead a table near the counter where the barista set their drinks - Draco pointedly ignored the slight hurt he felt at something as small as that - he felt Harry grab his wrist.
He took another bite of bagel and swallowed before he allowed himself to ask, “Well what did you want to talk about?”
Draco had to hand it to the girl - she certainly had the whole ‘creating content’ thing down to a science.
“Hey,” Harry called, reaching out to grab Draco’s forearm, “you okay?”
Draco narrowed his eyes. “If you have to ask, then maybe it isn’t.”
Which, of course, would mean admitting he had them in the first place.
“Sensitive?” Harry breathed out, his voice holding something like awe, as he lowered himself to sensuously lick Draco’s hip, causing shivers to travel up the blond’s spine.
- you can ask anyone, I’m usually the one pushing others away first before
Harry let out a laugh which stopped mid-melody when he noticed Draco standing before him, glaring daggers at him.
“I guess when you’re exposed to a certain circle,” Draco tried to cooly explain, “your worth doesn’t come from whether anyone
“Who?” Draco asked for clarification.
Harry held up his hands, soft smile on his face. “No, nothing like that.”
Probably around the time those green eyes walked into his life.
Some of the hot coffee splashed out onto his chest.
“Long day again?”
If it were anybody else who said that, Draco would have laughed. But somehow when Harry said it, it felt like it might be the truth.
Was he all alone? He certainly wasn’t
“Why would I shut you up about
“No.” Harry shook his head. To his surprise Harry’s green eyes looked concerned at that. Not for the first time Draco wondered what the other man saw when he looked at him. Especially if he wasn’t some reporter.
Pushing around the other man, he moved towards the door. It wasn’t until long after his 9am meeting that it occurred to him that he never even thought to give his own name in return.
More than worth it.
It was awkward, and there was a table and a laptop in between them, and the angle was off, but it was warm and soft and smelled of cedar and there was Harry’s hand on his cheek.
“Um, sir,” the barista called from behind the counter, “what was it you were waiting on?”
That last thought left him no better off than where he started.
that’s what.
even if he didn’t fully know what
The two eyed each other for a moment before Harry broke the silence. “I would like to date you,” he ventured, “exclusively. It’s up to you if you want that too…” He let his voice trail off, but not before Draco picked up on his hopeful tone.
They could pretend like they loved him.
“Better?” he asked with a smile, his eyes bright green and the sexy sight of his bare torso and that smile were ravaging Draco on the inside.
Even if he didn’t know what he wanted. And there were a lot of parts of his life where he really, truly, honestly, didn’t know what he wanted.
“Oh,” Harry moaned, “that, yes, that,
“Well that was cool! I didn’t know you were friends with him!” Pansy said dragging him away from the rooftop ledge, “let’s get you another drink and find Blaise.”
They forewent dessert. With dinner complete they wandered back out into the crisp air.
“Your father then?”
Draco held the eye contact for a moment before relenting. “No,” he reassured. “The look on your face,” he chuckled, “was worth it.”
And it definitely didn’t make him feel like he was flying.
," Draco tried the name as he stroked up on the man’s cock, “you clean, or do I need a condom?”
‘Liar,’ his brain whispered, ‘either he’s a liar, or you are.’
Harry shook his head. “This is not a negotiation. Just tell me the truth. I can handle it.” His small smile was somehow blinding.
Draco’s breath drew up short at that. He did not want to admit exactly how much he wanted that date. How hard he’d been fighting himself not to bring it up after their unanticipated ‘break.’
Draco didn’t know what to do with the feeling.
“What’s the rush?” Harry whispered, pulling back and running his hand through Draco’s hair and behind his ear. “We have all night.”
“How about a question each?”
“Even better,” Harry smiled.
‘Christ, he had it
Draco suddenly felt like he was recovering from a long run.
“Alright,” Harry said, removing his hand.
Time slowed down as Draco hit the edge of the rink behind him, the pain sharp down his back. He opened his mouth, ‘fucking hell’ on the tip of his tongue, when suddenly warm arms encircled his waist, Harry’s broad torso pressed against his as the momentum from the crash propelled the other man forward.
Draco did roll his eyes at that.
“Oh?” the man asked, “isn’t that rather dangerous?”
Harry shrugged. “Just thought you should know.”
Harry gently ran his hand down Draco’s back, kissing him as he cupped his arse through his black skinny jeans. Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry, pulling him closer to try and kiss him with more force. But Harry wouldn't let him.
Draco didn’t even have time to wonder at that thought before Harry was kissing him again, his hands moving to rest on Draco’s hips, as Draco got used to the feeling of the other man inside of him.
“We were just headed out to meet Hermione - Ron’s girlfriend - for some food,” Harry said by way of explanation, “Would- would you want to join us?”
‘True, but-’ “I tried being bi to please my family. It didn’t work out for me,” Draco found himself confessing.
“No, I can’t say I stopped to think ‘maybe you just like me,’” Draco said. He couldn't help the thought that followed, 'No one ever just likes me.'
“Yeah,” Draco sighed. It was a shame he’d asked about her over Blaise because now Harry would get two answers for the price of one question. “She and Blaise kind of come as a package deal.”
“A picnic in the park was romantic,” Harry cheerfully defended, “and you liked it, even if you won’t admit it.”
, and was working on the button of the man’s jeans when he pulled away from him.
“How about this,” Draco found himself saying, “actually take me out on that date you committed to and I will give you my phone number.”
The speech was not the most elegant Draco had ever heard, but it was certainly one of the most personal. And it was about him. It made his chest tighten, his stomach warm, and his eyes slightly itchy. He leaned forward and planted a kiss on Harry’s lips.
It was not a question but Draco nodded anyway.
“Has anyone ever told you that you catch more flies with honey?” Harry gave him a soft smile before turning to the bartender. “Five pints of whatever he was drinking please,” he ordered, placing more than enough pounds down on the table to cover it, proving, in Draco’s opinion, he had more than enough money for new shoes.
For the second day in a row, Draco did not start out his day with coffee.
Wait - that thought brought Draco up short. “Pansy, I thought those novels were written by Boyd Seeker?”
Draco could easily hide behind his sarcasm and natural distaste for the environment so clearly outside of his comfort zone. But here in his world, where he felt relatively at ease and knew the rules of the game, he should feel more in control. Instead, just like always, it felt like Harry still held all the cards.
“Woah, who are you and what have you done with my Blond Roast?”
“Thank you for dinner,” Harry said with a smile.
Draco came face-to-face with the
Well now Draco didn’t know what to say. That was certainly more personal than he expected. If they were friends he
“So, if we’re boyfriends, does this mean you’ll buy me all my coffees now?”
Draco didn’t know when he decided sex should be fun. He certainly didn’t learn that from the state of his parent’s relationship.
like I played sports?”
To his own surprise Draco had started to rearrange his morning meetings so there was more time for coffee with those beautiful green eyes which, lately, seemed to be making his days a little brighter. Or maybe it was just the man behind them. Either way, Draco didn’t really want to think too deeply about the reasons behind
But, in spite of the freedom, Draco found himself drawing a blank. He wanted to know everything but at the same time he wanted to know nothing. Knowing everything was dangerous. Knowing everything meant they were building some kind of relationship. Asking questions meant more investment, more time, more
Draco took the coward’s way out and avoided the coffee shoppe the next morning.
“Well, I wouldn’t know that yet, would I?” Harry teased back.
“That. Was me trying to be
That was exactly the problem. “Maybe,” Draco mumbled, “after we’re clean.”
, gosh the filthy casual even had a filthy common name. “And what’s that matter?” ‘And why the hell are your eyes so bright so early in the morning?’ Draco didn’t dare voice the second question.
Harry let out a small chuckle. “It’s your spunk too. And seeing as how I’m going to spend the night, I thought we could wash it off together in the shower.”
leather and metal to unlatch them. Task complete, he started work on Harry’s jean button, frantically working it open, revealing his boxers underneath. Draco could feel the warmth radiating there, from the hard cock mere millimeters from his fingertips, as he teased Harry over the fabric.
“That might be the most complex question you’ve ever asked.” Draco glared back.
he asked. “Does it make any difference if you know?”
do this. I was concerned about you!” And with that Harry was kissing him, almost harshly and with heavy desperation, pressing them together. He held his hands on the small of Draco's back and pushed him against the desk. Draco felt his cock strain against his trousers.
“Fourteen years? And here I thought my best friends being together for almost eleven years was long.” Harry sounded impressed.
“Why do you choose to write under a pen name?” Pansy asked curiously.
like this? Doesn’t that get exhausting?”
The man looked down in confusion. Draco followed his gaze. Sure enough, there was no name on the coffee cup.
It was not phrased as a question and it caused tingles to travel down Draco’s spine. It wasn’t an entirely familiar sensation but he found it was becoming more so the more he was around this man.
“How is it?” Harry asked.
“But, really, I think I’m the victor anyway.”
her.”
The damn smile was back. Draco nodded dumbly.
Draco decided, was a complicated concept for so early in the morning from a man with wet hair and arresting green eyes before he had even had a sip of coffee. It was ridiculous, really, how it made his chest tighten and his heart race just a little. Especially when he couldn’t even put a word or label on what the nature of his ‘relationship’ was with one Harry Potter.
“So I have been told. Order the coffee.” Draco turned towards what he was coming to think of as ‘their table.’
Harry gave him a bright smile.
Draco kept having to dismiss the thought that Harry had been in on it all. If he was, Draco tried to think logically, he would have had to plan it in advance, making sure he was away the next day when the fall out happened-
“No, let me.” Harry insisted, pushing himself in front of Draco. “Blond roast with a splash of soy, right?”
When the shaking subsided some, Harry still lapping at Draco’s dick, Draco reached down and pulled him back up. “We’re not done yet,” he insisted, hopping off the desk and kissing Harry intensely as he lowered his pants to the floor and turned around. “Fuck me,” he commanded abandoning all reason, “I need to feel you, here.”
And, like he’d said the magic words, Harry was suddenly on top of him, pressing Draco’s torso down into the desk almost painfully before whispering in his ear, “Do you have lube?”
“Too much dark green,” his mother had said when he’d set the place up.
Draco spread the peanut butter slowly on his bagel before taking a bite, chewing thoughtfully. “And that didn’t count as a question?”
“Uh-ah,” Draco said, collecting up his things, crumbling up the paper bag his bagel had been served in, and tossing it in the trash. “One question each, remember?”
The words seemed to encourage Harry as he pressed their bodies together. Draco could feel Harry’s hard length pressing up against his stomach. The heat and friction between them spurred Draco’s fantasies for all the wrong reasons, and yet suddenly they felt so right.
“There’s a part of me that’s always wanted a family. You know - with never having one growing up.” Harry paused here and Draco squirmed, suddenly uncomfortable with the turn in the conversation.
Somewhere, deep inside himself, Draco had to concede that Harry was right.
Draco knew he should not be surprised Blaise knew about this too, but somehow he was. But overriding that was the knowledge that Blaise knew who Boyd really was - he’d met him as Harry after all.
Suddenly another drink sounded like a
“Alright.” Harry smiled. “Well, I guess I’ll see you tomorrow morning then?”
“Ah-aw.” Harry smiled. “I believe our time for the day is up. One question each in twenty minutes.”
“Maybe I can find out.” Harry’s voice was hushed and husky in a way Draco had never heard before as he leaned in and kissed him seductively on the lips.
“And you, well you look like shite. But then you always did, didn’t you? Full of shite too. What can you possibly be doing at a children’s fund raiser? Finally given daddy dearest an heir, have you?”
“I believe my father’s exact words were "No pansy son of mine is going to ice-skate." Then he turned to my mother and blamed her for the whole affair.”
“Okay, you’re
The words were so faint Draco almost didn’t hear them, but he had no time to let them sink in before there was a knock on the door.
“I will be.” Harry smiled, completely ignoring Draco’s acidic tone. “I want to be. I’m just - my publisher has me on this deadline. I’ve been working since 5am.”
Draco gave him a skeptical look as he took and paper and unfolded it, reading an address he didn’t recognize followed by a date and time. He folded the note back up and pocketed it.
“Blond Roast just needed his coffee to make him as sweet as a blond latte.”
question. One he wanted to know the answer to. But the one question that kept coming to mind was, “Will you go on a proper date with me?”
“Seriously mother. It’s not what you think. At all.”
Once upon a time Draco thought he was bisexual. It was a good fairytale lie he could tell himself in the quiet moments of the night when he first started coming into his sexuality. Comforting to think he could still provide his family with an heir, that he could possibly find love with a girl and live out his days with her. But the reality was in all the times he’d taken female partners, there had been a small handful, the sex had always left him feeling deeply unsatisfied. It was all
-BAM!
Draco just wanted his bloody coffee.
“Draco!” Harry smiled wide, green eyes bright as ever. “How are you?”
“I used to be on the swim team in high school.” Draco realized Harry was explaining. “It’s the closest feeling I have ever come to flying.” A dreamy look overtook those green eyes for just a moment before it cleared. “Did you ever play sports?”
Well, that was an interesting development. Draco felt like there was something important he was missing but he was still too hung up on Harry’s description of him to care at the moment. He dismissed the
“Woah, someone’s in a sour mood,” Pansy said with a laugh, “I am going to excuse it because Blaise had one job and clearly he didn’t tell you about the charity event tonight at Nimble Grounds. They’re raising money for the UK branch of the World Literacy Foundation or some such - basically they help kids learn to read-”
“Draco, are you okay?” Concerned green eyes were looking at him.
“Huh?”
last all night with him. Or perhaps it was the other way around. But that was not what crossed his mind when Harry said those magic words. Instead Draco wanted to counter that if they moved fast they would each have all night to cum multiple times, following up round one with rounds two and three and maybe even four if he could handle it. But looking into those green eyes, Draco realized that maybe, just maybe, Harry actually meant they had
Harry narrowed his eyes just slightly. “I don’t go around stereotyping people. Why don’t you just answer the question?”
This time all Draco felt was apathy.
“Sorry,” Harry replied, “I was on a small charity publishing tour. I just got back this afternoon.”
As the son of Lucius Malfoy, it was expected of Draco from the day he was born that he would find his place in the inner circles of Marvolo-Tech-Industries.
“So, what do you want?”
Below that Draco caught the top portion of a photo with brick that looked suspiciously familiar…
It was only when Harry smiled wide that Draco realized he had asked the question out loud.
Draco frowned slightly at that. “One,” he started in, “you could be lying. About your name, I mean. And two,” he continued, “why do you need to call me something?”
Sucking in a breath, Draco made his way onto the dance floor. His silver leather pants hugged him like a glove, low on hips, bright, flashy and bold to lure them in like a hook on a line. His dark green mesh shirt he had custom ordered at some point didn’t leave much to the imagination, which suited him just fine for his goal for the night. Rocking his hips in time with the music, it wasn’t long before he attracted a tall, buff, dark-haired man who started grinding up on him.
Draco smirked, “that’s clearly obvious.”
Fuck, he actually
Taking another sip of his coffee, Draco somehow managed to coolly press past Harry towards the door. He only allowed himself to breathe again once he was a block away.
The lie had actually hurt and had felt like it tore a hole through his heart.
That was a good explanation, Draco decided, taking a sip of his coffee - it
He pulled his lips off Harry’s cock and moved back up to kiss him soundly. Their bare torsos pressed together as the warmth of Harry’s mouth claiming Draco’s rivaling the warmth of his cock. Draco reached down to unfasten his jeans, fumbling slightly, his natural grace only reaching so far.
“-and are you sure you want me to know where you
Harry smiled at that. Draco could tell it was a little forced, but just seeing him smile was nice.
“Well, well, well,” a voice chuckled to his right, interrupting his thoughts, “fancy seeing you here.”
“Come back to my place.”
“What’s your favorite color?”
“Well...” Harry smiled, taking his eyes off Draco for the first time since he’d turned around. “Three for my friends and I, plus two for you two. I’m not such an arse as to ignore Draco’s friends.”
“Hi,” he said, almost dismissively, before turning back to his phone.
“I can’t leave you alone for one minute, can I?” the author laughed, and Draco shook his head in bewilderment that Harry was standing
‘What kind of half-assed coffee shoppe was this?’ Draco would never let that fly if he owned this place.
Draco fought the urge to bang his head against the wall.
Draco was too warm to care.
“Yeah, yeah,” he replied, “you too, you arse.”
But sitting in front of him, right now, was a man who did say he missed him. Several times actually. And he had sounded sincere about it. All without a single expectation of Draco. He didn’t even ask him to curb aspects of his personality that typically drove away others.
“How generous of you,” Draco gritted out, taking a seat across from Harry but deliberately turning his body to face the rest of the coffee shoppe.
“Oh c’mon,” Harry continued, “how can I know if you’re a damsel in distress if you won’t tell me?”
“Yeah, I will.”
And he still didn’t know if this was a
green eyes had promised him a date. A proper date. But Draco was just too drunk to really
Draco just stared at Harry. ‘Dammit - that vow didn’t last long.’
“We’re not eating yet,” Lucius reminded her, “and you shouldn’t be so resistant to discussing topics that keep you living the lifestyle you’ve become so accustomed to-”
good idea. Preferably something stronger than ale this time.
“No, you won’t answer it?”
But this was Green Eyes.
“It’s all over the internet,” Pansy continued into Draco’s silence, “at least it’s a good picture, if damning. But I don’t know how your father is going to do damage control on this one. I talked to Blaise and he agrees.”
“Ah, Draco!” Harry cried as he pulled out of Draco’s tight arse and stroked his cock twice before his seed joined Draco’s own, leaving them both covered and sated.
Draco bit his lip to not let out a moan. He could feel Harry deep inside of him, balls resting against his ass. Harry's breath was ragged in his ear - he was getting close. They both were, so Draco all but begged, "Cum- cum inside me."
Not wanting to ruin the moment but knowing he wanted,
Draco thought for a moment, but all he could think of, all he’d been able to think of since the previous morning if he was being honest with himself, was Harry’s wet hair. So he found himself asking, “Why was your hair wet yesterday?”
Blaise shrugged and Draco raised his eyebrows. “Fine, you’re getting whatever I order then.”
Harry laughed. “What makes you think I take other people on dates?”
“That’s my question this morning. Will you come with me?”
Being with Harry - though he still wasn’t sure if he was exactly
He hadn’t been. But he’d known Blaise since before they could talk. The heir to the Zabini Fashion empire, his friend was lucky enough to never have had anything to do with mTech but unlucky enough to run in the same circles.
Draco was taken aback by his own honesty. 'What in holy hell had possessed him to admit that?' He watched Harry’s face fall and green eyes cloud slightly, but it was only for the briefest moment before they cleared.
He was playing a very dangerous game.
Draco fought the roll of his eyes. “Blond with soy.”
It wasn’t until he left the coffee shoppe that he realized he’d never even taken a sip of his drink.

“Family expectations.”
that gesture was.
?” Harry’s expression was livid as he stepped closer to Draco. “I
“Excuse me,” a voice came from behind him. Draco turned heel to see who was addressing him and was met with the most brilliant green eyes he’d ever seen. He saw them first before the wide rimmed glasses, large circles that looked extremely hipster and cheap. But the frames cleared the way for his eyes. Draco felt his breath catch for just a second, but the second of silence only served to encourage the man to keep talking. “I think I may have picked up your drink by mistake. I saw blond coffee with S Milk and I grabbed it thinking it was skim. I apologize.”
He could have slapped his forehead for all but admitting to having
“I know.” Harry looked at him seriously. “That’s why I ordered pizza with vegan cheese.”
He rolled off the bed, careful not to let any of the cum hit the comforter and moved to the bathroom to find some tissues, or something. He didn’t know Harry had followed until he found arms circling him from behind and warm kisses being pressed to his neck.
He dropped his arms at lightning speed.
, Draco reminded himself - asked him when he came down from the high of his orgasm.
Draco had gotten used to seeing Harry happy, but he wasn’t used to being the cause of joy in others. It made his stomach flip and a fire build that threatened to melt his icy walls.
“Aw, not much for after-cuddles, huh?” Harry asked.
Draco
“Draco?
He should have known Harry would be a ‘clean-plate’ person.
“Yes.” Draco said, resigned but not unhappily so, “it’s a yes.”
Life continued on for a while - a blur of coffee, fucking, sleeping, and more coffee - until one morning when Harry looked up at Draco over their table.
With a sigh Draco worked the cock in front of him with vigor. Draco was relieved when the man didn’t reach down to grab his hair or touch him at all. As if that changed the level of intimacy between them somehow. The thought spurred him to suck harder. If he was being too rough the man above him wasn’t letting on. He was moaning occasionally but for the most part he was fairly silent.
The thought ripped through Draco’s entire body, sending his head buzzing and his toes aflame. He moved his hand down to unfasten the belt buckle holding up Harry’s jeans, keeping his other hand firmly pressed to Harry’s back until the challenge became too great and he had to employ both of his hands to yank at the
“I was invited.” Draco took a sip of his drink and didn’t offer any additional explanation.
. Harry leaned down to kiss and lick up his neck, and Draco’s heart ignited, intensity and passion surely burning a hole through the desk.
Why hadn’t he attempted to pick up anyone since?
It wasn’t a question, but it also hadn’t been in the plan.
“That-” Draco swallowed, “that can’t be true.”
Not that the ice beneath his feet was melting. He was fairly certain that was only the ice around his heart.
those.
“Oh my god, I’m so sorry,” the man apologized, “Are you okay?”
Draco nodded, as surprised at himself as Harry sounded.
“Of course not.” Draco felt his cheeks heat slightly, countering his sarcastic tone. Harry smiled as Draco impulsively reached for Harry’s other wrist and started skating
If he was being honest with himself, he might say he was becoming addicted.
“Huh?” Draco snapped his head up.
“Draco!” The urgent voice of his secretary hissed through the door. Draco held up a finger to silence her momentarily.
Harry’s grin was back.
“...are you giving me the silent treatment?” Harry asked, “I might be the first to admit I probably deserve it, but it’s rather childish don’t you think? Plus, you did say ‘excuse me’ earlier so you already broke your vow of silence anyway.” Harry smiled at him.
“You know you could always go back.”
Turned out he needn’t have worried too much about it because he was with Harry, who, Draco quickly realized, had probably never donned a pair of ice skates in his life.
It was two days after what Draco was now calling ‘the coffee incident’ in his head. Somehow in the span of 48-hours he’d managed to bag a new client, have Blaise buy him his new phone, and dream about those green eyes staring at him from beneath those ridiculous glasses. And, as the man who possessed those green eyes was standing in front of him again right now, Draco certainly wasn’t going to say a word about
“Is that why you didn’t want to tell me why you started writing children’s books?”
“I can’t come over tonight.”
“Search me,” the man shrugged, “I saw a sexy man from across the room and thought I would come over and say hello. It’s not my fault that your manners need some work.”
For not having skated in twenty years or more, remembering how to skate backward came fairly naturally to him. He started cautiously, looking behind himself, avoiding the edges of the rink, moving smoothly. But as he increased in speed he became mesmerized by the happiness and excitement that grew in those green eyes. The smile on Harry’s face that got wider, more carefree, younger-
They stayed there a while, until Draco felt like he might suffocate, and so he pulled back and kissed Harry’s neck before reaching his hand down and palming Harry’s cock through his jeans.
Who was he to be at Draco’s pub when he had promised a date and never delivered? In fact Harry just fucking disappeared on him. Draco worked not to grit his teeth.
bloody delicious.
“Young love,” Harry said, taking a sip of coffee. It wasn’t quite a question but Draco could hear it in his tone.
‘God, when have I become such a sap?’
But one day of being caffeine deprived and having to rely on the burnt coffee in the mTech company kitchen, which was absolute shite, was enough to convince him to return to the shoppe the next day.
While the first day was completely circumstantial, the second was sheer determination to avoid seeing those green eyes again.
The expression on Harry’s face at that was not one Draco would soon forget.
Before moving in, Draco took a moment to admire his prize. Harry’s cock stood at attention in front of his face, thick and hot, with beads of precum leaking from the tip. Draco felt something inside him shift as he moved forward to take a broad lick up the shaft, lapping at the salty precum that pooled there, before taking him down to the hilt. Sucking and savoring Harry’s unique flavor, slightly bitter and sweet, not unlike coffee, mixed with a hint of salt. Draco was accustomed to making his club conquests cum quickly, but in this case he found himself wanting to relish the flavor and elongate the moment to continue to feel Harry shudder beneath him.
“Prove it.” Draco had to regain control.
Were Harry anybody else, some nameless, faceless, man in a club, Draco would have said he was hungry for something else. But this was Harry. And from day one this man with his bright green eyes had cast some weird spell over Draco that made him act in ways he never had before.
“Hello to you too, Pans.” Draco tried to keep the sarcasm out of his voice but faltered in his task. “What in the bloody hell is tonight?”
It was kind of amazing really, how easily the man could get to him.
“You mean you’re
“We need to stop meeting like this.”
But he’d already embarrassed himself enough.
Jonathan Stroud and Cornelia Funke are both real Children’s book authors who have written some amazing works. I am not associated with either of them, but I love their books and very much enjoy the way they tell stories.
Pansy giggled, letting go of Draco and looking Harry up and down. “Say,” she asked stepping closer, “aren’t you the author who wrote those adventure books?
“Oh c’mon, Draco, don’t be like that. You know we were never
They were sitting at the same table where they originally started their peculiar question exchange. Harry was enjoying his coffee with an amazing looking cinnamon muffin that made Draco’s mouth water just looking at it. He’d settled instead for a plain bagel - as they were sold out of everythings - but the shoppe had restocked on packets of organic peanut butter so Draco considered it a small price to pay. And, as always, he had his blond roast with a splash of soy milk.
“Well good.” Harry smiled. “At least you’re aware of it then.”
Plus, if he could make Harry’s eyes light up like
Harry laughed dryly. “God, you really are impossible, aren't you?”
“I think you better go,” the voice behind Draco tried again.
“Good, thank you,” Blaise said dryly, “and you are?”
"Green," Draco said. He had loved the color his entire life, but as he looked into those bright green eyes, he couldn't shake the idea that maybe he had more reasons to like it more now.
Draco wanted to protest that he wasn’t a prude, that he had other concerns on his mind about who might be listening, but mostly he’d shut Harry up because of the stirring he’d felt in his groin thinking about the previous night - ‘if he didn’t want to sit here with a hard-on, did that mean he was being a prude?’
He would have to fix that.
In public.
Draco was slightly flabbergasted at the question. “Is that really how you’re burning your second question?”
Draco
“Flint-” Draco’s voice was firm, “do not make a scene here.” Damn how he sounded like his mother. “It will do no good for anyone.” Fuck, now he sounded like his father.
“Shut up and dance,” Draco ordered in response.
believe Harry. This hadn’t been a set up on his part. That knowledge somehow made the fallout slightly easier to deal with.
Harry nodded. “I know.” He stepped back. “Now if you two will excuse me, I’ve probably got to get back to my table. Books don’t really sign themselves. I’ll see you around?” he addressed Draco before walking away.
When he was shown into the common room, he asked where his bed was. Stating that he was exhausted and wanted to sleep.
The weird sensation of having the webs touched as cause Harry to get frustrated and he was tempted to shout a Malfoy to stop but he also wanted to hear more, so he could understand just what had been done to him.
Then Harry watched as Malfoy took a handle full of the powered and threw it, “The Leaky Cauldron.” With green flames, the blonde was gone.
Malfoy had left the library in a good mood earlier, so Harry was taken by surprise when he entered the Room of Requirements and had to duck out of the way of book flying at his face. He heard the book hit the wall behind with a thud and looked towards the blonde.
He almost gasped when Evan not only relaxed in his arms but leaned into him. Moony however whimpered and urged him to hold the other closer. To protect and comfort him. He swallowed and watched as Evan looked back over his shoulder at him. He took in the other kids surprise and wondered if the brunet had been expecting someone else. Probably Luke. But then Evan nodded.
There was a snort, “You’re a horrible liar Potter.”
He cleared his throat to get the blondes attention. Then when Malfoy looked at him, he gave the other a lost look.
It burned, which he thought distantly would explain the coughing. Then a sharp pain radiated through his stomach and Harry gasped and wrapped his arms around his stomach, willing it to stop. When it was over he felt light headed and shaky.
Again, the room fell into silence, Harry was trying to think of what to do next. If Malfoy believed him then they would have to work together to find a way back to their own time. If Malfoy didn’t then he would have to continue trying to make him believe, or at least stop him from running off to tell Dumbledore about them.
He could feel Potter’s eyes on him, so he looked back up and met the other’s gaze. They stared at each other for a moment before something shifted in Potter’s eyes and then he dropped his gaze.
“Is he truly innocent?” He couldn’t help but ask. He had heard the rumors about it, even about Pettigrew’s supposed involvement but the Dark Lord didn’t seem to want to fill anyone in on the details and it wasn’t like he could ask at the Ministry.
