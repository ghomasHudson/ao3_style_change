He makes it past the crowd of people, but Draco barely manages another step before Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger cut in front of him. There are tracks in the grime on Ron’s face, obviously from tears; Draco thinks about the shock of red hair on one of the corpses and wonders who Ron had lost.
Draco’s got one arm causally propped up against the side door, head held in his hand as he turns the wheel with the other. They don’t look at each other. Draco keeps his eyes firmly on the road and Harry stares away, at his own face in the dusty side view mirror. The road stretches on, the bumps in the van in time with the beat of Harry’s heart, the ticking of the meter in the dashboard, the swing of the trinkets in the back.
Draco ducked his head. “Coach yelled at me. Said I breathed on the first stroke at the last 50. Called me an idiot.”
“Yes,” Harry says, out into the darkness, into the soft space between dreams and reality. “Yes, I do.”
The shower is shit - the water fluctuates between burning hot and freezing and Harry gives up hoping from one side of the tub to the other. He grits his teeth and stands under the spray, muscles tensing under the icy water and tries not to think longingly of his bathtub at home.
Harry watches Draco’s face smooth out, blurred into shadows and soft edges, a charcoal sketch of a boy looking at the moon.
Draco shakes his head. Shadows from the clouds cast patterns across his face, tinted with the light of the dying sun. “Nah.”
Draco waves his hand dismissively. “Well this time it isn’t pissing with snow. Plus the car doesn’t smell like a pool.”
The alarm finally cuts off - Draco must have finally reached for his phone. The room suddenly feels achingly silent without it.
Someone grips his arm hard; Draco blinks as Pansy appears, lips set in a vicious snarl. She’s gripping her wand, so tight her fingers were white where they wrapped around the handle. Flanking her is Blaise and Theo and Greg, a crowd of familiar faces in a pool of hate and Draco feels himself relax just a bit.
“It’s not that complicated, Potter. I’m definitely, definitely not homophobic because I’m …” he trailed off and held out one hand in Harry’s direction.
“Sex ed, Professor Malfoy, it’s called sex ed,” Britney interrupted. “We did one session in primary, but it was really rubbish and all about abstinence, which, like,” she rolled her eyes, “is really ineffective, props to like every study ever.”
Malfoy shook his head again. “He’s an Unspeakable. Very cloak-and-dagger shit. Absolutely no intra-office drama allowed. So, of course, everyone’s fucking like rabbits. But no feelings. None.”
Draco had leaned across the counter, and Harry had to drag his eyes away from his backside. Colleagues. Right.
Ah, last year still rankled, Remus thought with a smirk, remembering how he and Andy had carried the day against the three of them. Kreacher muttered in discontent, but said, “Fine,” and marched into the study.
Enclosed: facsimile of the magical sanguine marriage contract between Draco Malfoy and Astoria Elodie Greengrass, dated 5th September 1987; witnessed by Carteret Lascelles of Eliphat Pocket & Unicorn.
“It would be a horrible abuse of power to enter a sexual relationship with Malfoy,” Neville said, snapping back into his confidence. “Unthinkable. I’d lose my position at the university and my ability to work for the community service component of the rehabilitation program.”
“Drat!” she cried, summoning them back to her. Luna had taken one of the papers and was reading it upside down.
“I just thought it was a myth. Like a romantic reason to fight Voldemort. Love prevails and all that.”
Owain shot his eyes at Minerva and then at Lachlan Leith, who had taken over Filch’s role with a penchant for restoration and a distaste for shackles. Placatingly, Lachlan talked Hagrid down by promising to make him a special slug cage that strictly required Hagrid’s magical signature to open.
“I have to keep stirring this damn risotto, but like, say your piece,” Andromeda said. “I assume this isn’t a social call.”
He glanced over at Draco, who had settled back into the couch in a pose quite different than his usual rigid posture. Draco’s hair glinted in the firelight, and he was watching the sleeping dogs with a look of—wait, was that jealousy?
“Well,” Pomona said, “Would anyone like to take a look at the carnivorous serpentine maximiliorian?”
Harry wanted to close his eyes and disapparate to Ron and Hermione’s couch. Luckily, Padma and Addie had just been down in Edinburgh looking for some extracurricular aids—Harry suddenly thought,
“It wasn’t a lap dance!” Harry wailed. God, how were they all so chummy and against him? His oldest friends! Betrayal! Woe! He collapsed onto the table, hiding his blush in the crook of his arm. “It was a practical demonstration, since someone,” he raised his head to shoot a meaningful glance at Malfoy, “was trying to sink my wizarding DJ idea. They can’t have some old lame-o. They need pop music! Rap! Dance! House! At least something from this century!”
All the usual suspects were here: Harry, managing to welcome everyone and make sure that the snacks were refilled; Luna, nodding along as Ginny showed her various wedding dresses in some magazine; Dean sprawled on top of Seamus, who was taking up an entire couch even though he was about five four; Florian trying to look casual and failing while eating a biscuit; Addie, Pelin, and Sequoia were chatting in a corner.
Vane now has an entire line of Curavi potions, from the giggle-boosting Giggular (which tastes and looks like honey made by bright pink bees) to the sensuality-heightening Donna, brewed with an extremely diluted tincture of belladonna to slow down and amplify sensations. Your editor has tried many of Vane’s potions over the years, and let her be the first to recommend these new, ethical “love potions” for anyone looking to introduce a new element into their sexual explorations. Go forth, imbibe and procreate joyfully! ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰ ✰
Harry was the Emperor of Deviations. Empress of Divagations? Emperor should be a non-binary word, but Florian wasn’t sure. Emprex?
Padma Patil, who had taught potions for the past five years after graduating from Oxford with a first in magical chemistry, laughed and shook her head. “Hagrid, he’s worrying about Draco already.”
The Oliver-Winger cottage was brimming with kids and family. The Hogwarts professors slid in and bunched around the snacks table. Audrey bustled in and flapped her hands at them to disperse.
He didn’t know what he was supposed to say, so he just waved (goofily, mind you) at Malfoy, who gave him a half-hearted two-fingered salute, and let himself out. Harry spent the rest of the evening in confused repose. He penned a note to Hermione and Ron asking if he could come around next weekend, sent it off with Ulula, spent some time trying to trim his hair with his wand but that was such a disaster (it looked like he’d been attacked with gardening shears) that he panicked and found himself outside Andre’s door, hoping the older wizard was in.
Since Audrey had her wand aimed at Harry’s forehead, and Talbott had his at Draco’s neck, the wand could only be Draco’s. Fuck.
And it did. He sped towards the Forbidden Forest. He could feel his nostrils freezing and wiggled his nose to delay the process. He should have worn a balaclava. Speeding along the tops of the trees, he filled his lungs with the frigid air. The pain felt fresh and somehow cleansing.
Harry dropped his hands, stepped backwards, and folded his arms. Colleague. Professional. Dry toast. Cricket. Say something, you weirdo.
“Ok, well, you know how Diwali is usually in late October or early December? When wizarding families emigrated from India to Britain, they wove the magic that built up during Diwali into the pagan rituals of Halloween. Weeks of celebration strengthened the diasporic magical communities that were reeling from violent upheaval and the racial tensions they faced in Britain. One of the big nineteenth-century British traditions was scrying for your future spouse in cauldrons of water or with apples, which was madly popular among the desi crowd. So, like, between finding out the identity of your true love and the fact that candlelight is universally flattering, it’s a pretty romantic holiday.”
Draco had pulled out a small silver cigarette case and tapped it with his wand, which emitted a small purple cloud of smoke with floating green lettering.
“I’ve been worried sick, being so close to Hogwarts! Usually the wards here keep everything in, but,” she made an angry little huffing noise.
He sighed. “I may have augmented its charmwork a bit,” he admitted. “Dragons shouldn’t be flightless.”
Malfoy stared down at his arm and Harry’s hand. “It doesn’t excuse this. I should have known it was wrong. Why I did it doesn’t excuse any of it. I don’t expect you to forgive or pity me.”
She shook her head. “I’m sure you met the others at the interview, but they’re all great. Well, they’re professors. But they try.”
By colleagues he means the dragons. Asked for advice to give to our readers, Weasley mused for a few moments, then grinned and said, “It’s great! You can really focus on what you’re into—whether that’s international trade law, making ice cream, embroidery, or, the best thing in the entire world, dragons!”
Neville’s owl flew into Luna’s kitchen and began hopping around on the table until Ginny glanced up and took the envelope.
Malfoy tilted his head. “You don’t even know what my ass is like, Potter.” He sauntered closer and leaned across Harry’s desk.
No, he could see that one of them was smaller, like a doe—Harry was filled with dread. Snape’s patronus was a doe. Did Malfoy still admire him?
This was going to become tiresome. She’d read the books about PTSD and prisons and all those things but being looked at constantly was already wearing her down and she’d be damned if she let her nephew get under her skin, so, girding her mind in the Black armor she’d abandoned years before, she said in a controlled voice, “Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to lurk in doorways?”
“Lions make us honest! It’s horrible but it’ll be good for you!” she shouted as she strode away before disapparating with the telltale crack.
Or Granger, she supplied. Or Weasley. Wheezes had been ordering tons of pastries, though, so maybe she should be a bit more charitable.
“Oh, no, no,” Sirius said, holding his hands up. “One of those super ethical Vane ones, where it only works if there’s already, emotions, or whatever.”
Several plates of shrimp later (Harry really needed to control himself, but he could finally eat the fancy crustaceans he’d spent hours preparing for Petunia’s dinner parties), Harry burped behind one hand and said, “So, Malfoy, if we’ve been invited in, why don’t we just not leave? Would the wards know?”
Harry laughed in an attempt to cover his exhaustion. Eight hours of daily lesson planning all summer hadn’t left him much time for flying. He’d just sprinted up a whole flight of stairs. He waved his hand to the left. Malfoy set off, nodding to the portraits along the way. The oil-painted figures whispered and tittered. Harry loped along the corridor until he was shoulder-to-shoulder, well, shoulder-to-mid-upper-arm, with Malfoy.
Draco shoved both his sleeves up, revealing his pale, bare forearms. “I hated my mother because she wouldn’t let me get marked. She said it was an ugly tattoo. And she was right.”
“Additionally, what I just performed was the most flamboyantly erotic version of this type of dance, which, I might add, I did not teach the students. Perhaps a few isolated moves were demonstrated to the minors in my care, but certainly none of the more sensual ones.” Harry shrugged. Acting casual was difficult. Catching his breath was harder.
She swallowed and said, “You know, they only talk to each other in English. She yells at us in Hindi, but my dad’s family speaks mostly Marathi. They met in English class at uni. My dad brought her snacks every day until she said she’d go on a date with him. She always told us make a man work for you. I mean, turns out neither of us wanted a man, but—"
“Well, Sirius is my cousin so he’s your uncle once removed or something. And he likes me.” Andromeda raised her eyebrows. “And he’s a bazillionaire, so he always gives good presents. Last year he brought me a thirty-year Lagavulin.”
Addie snorted. The older professors looked like someone had just dropped them here from another dimension. Padma was vibrating with barely-suppressed laughter. Bastian had his lips pursed.
Ron’s mouth twitched. Mum and he had spent a few minutes in the kitchen, prodding the burned and yet raw cake with their wands to spruce it up a bit, then realized it was hopeless, binned it, and whipped up another banana bread, compressing the baking time with magic, so that by the time they returned to the table with perfectly sliced, warm banana bread, no one had noticed they’d even been gone.
Kreacher has preserved hair from all members of the family in a scrapbook, so don’t think you’re safe.
The sofa dipped down again, and Harry looked over to find Draco sitting there, just a hair closer than Dean had been.
“Pansy,” he said, and ushered her into the front hall, crammed with coats and wellies. “Sorry about the mess. Neville’s started leaving his spare pair here.”
He’d never have expected to one, befriend Harry Potter and two, develop a huge crush on Harry Potter. Well, the second was way more likely. Who didn’t have a crush on Harry Potter? But befriending Harry Potter. That still seemed mad.
“What?” Harry’s mind went white with rage. If Malfoy thought he could write a history of Harry’s family without telling him, he had another thing fucking coming. “How dare—”
Draco pressed his lips together. “It’s hardly my fault if you turn out to be competent occasionally.”
◻ ron’s birthday → ☑ text h re: tacos?! ↔ ☑ text florian re: tacos if h yes // people to invite: ginny, luna, florian, seamus, dean, nev (+ blaise?), george, percy (???) set up floo for fred (time zones??) party games ???
She’d moved back to her side of Susan’s kitchen table and was doing that thing where she examined the ends of her blonde curls for split hairs. Which she never had. Because she did hair masks and spent thousands of galleons on her hairdresser and tonics and whatever else she did in the bathroom that smelled so good and made her hair so soft.
The next morning, Harry was hanging about the Floo waiting for Hermione and Luna when a dark-haired figure crashed through. Unfolding herself to a height of barely five three, even in a four-inch heel, Pansy Parkinson brushed ash from her pencil skirt and surveyed him through dark glasses.
Standing at the counter, Harry rubbed his eyes. He’d really passed out there. He smiled awkwardly at Starr as they waited for Draco to pick something.
“I don’t want to know what he’s done,” Talbott shook his head. “As long as he doesn’t get expelled.”
“It’s happened,” Neville said and kissed his forehead. “But the point is that it has nothing to do with what you look like. It’s all about how you make me feel, and, I hope, how I make you feel.”
Harry bumped up the volume with a wand swish, tucked his wand behind one ear, and went to fucking town. He twirled around Malfoy’s chair, dropping low and rising up, making sure he stuck his ass mostly at Malfoy and not at Minerva. Only one of them had asked for it. Or kind of asked for it.
When the alarm went off the next morning, Harry groaned. He wished Dean was here to throw pillows at him until he got up. God, he missed sleeping near people. It wasn’t even a sexual thing. He just felt so … lonely. Eight years of dormitory life was heaven to a little boy who’d spent most of his childhood alone, under the stairs.
The weekend had gone off better than expected. He and Malfoy had flooed to London, spent far too many Galleons in Diagon Alley buying Teddy a slightly-larger children’s broomstick (Harry) and an animorph stuffed dragon (Draco; Harry rolled his eyes), then ate grim sandwiches at a Pret (Malfoy complained the whole time about the lack of mayonnaise, only he called it aioli and Harry wanted to barf), spent too much money at a Muggle toy store buying Teddy art supplies (Draco) and a wooden go-kart kit (Harry), and then wrapped up their day at a Waterstones, where Harry could barely see Draco behind a towering stack of contemporary murder mysteries (he refused all help carrying them, but then ducked into an alley and shrunk them, much to Harry’s relief). They’d gotten on a Muggle train, and then Hermione came and picked them up in a little red Clio.
The room is small - one bed (there only ever seemed to be one.) The covers are some horrifying clash of green with a red floral print, the blankets thin and vaguely stiff. The lights flicker above them, electricity buzzing and washing everything out.
Draco shoots him an annoyed glare. His face is flushed from the sun; dimly Harry remembers the paleness of Draco’s skin, the way he burned instead of tanned, neck and shoulders turning sunset red. “Why don’t you say it another fifty times. Maybe it’ll magically jump start the engine.”
“I hate you,” Draco retorts. There’s no heat behind his words, nothing beyond the catch in his throat, the rawness of sleep.
There’s only one bed; they’ve piled the spare pillows in the middle between their bodies, high enough that a stray leg or arm couldn’t pass over through the middle. Harry can still feel him though, the dip in the mattress where Draco’s body lay against the bed. It’s too hot - the air-con is shitty, and he’s got the covers kicked off and tangled around his feet.
Harry flips him off. He finds the sugar in a jar next to the stove and adds a few heaping spoonfuls to his coffee, the rich scent already helping with his headache. “I’m mysterious!” he protests. “And handsome. And attractive. And devastatingly intelligent.”
but it still makes him smile anyway. He doesn’t click on it though, instead finds the same music they’ve been listening to, the ones with high chords and low bass, the kind that sounds like dusty skies and warm air and road trips. It’s the kind of song that whispered of nostalgia, things that hadn’t happened yet, memories half-faded with time. Draco slides him a half-smile, the barest tilt of his lips but Harry knows it’s a peace offering anyways.
They don’t speak for a while. Rain pours around them, solid and unsteady. Harry watches it settle against the pavement.
“Bye,” Draco whispered to Harry, and then he was gone, following his father, leaving Harry standing alone amongst the crowd of people.
Sirius just shrugs, head propped up against his hand, and Draco thinks again that he looks very, very young. “The only monster made are ones that are in love.”
The rain lessens as the dawn burns through to morning, dries up enough to warrant Draco turning down the window. The sound of air fills the car; the radio is off for once, phones lying abandoned in the empty cup holders.
The road stretches out in front of them. There’s another car up ahead - they’re going much too slow for such an open road. Harry steps on the accelerator, watches the meter tick up in steady increments.
Draco stands by the edge of the water, his feet bare. The rain stains the thin cotton of his hoodie, the soft bleed from light blue to dark. He’s still, hands hanging loose at his side, hood off despite the weather.
“Like you for example. You’re a chaser. When you want something you go for it. It’s all or nothing. It’s a sprint. You see what you want and you fight like hell to get it.”
Sirius smiles. “I was actually going to say, before you interrupted me earlier that you remind me a lot of myself. Back when I was younger. You have the same…complete disregard for yourself. Self-destructive tendencies, almost. Because who cares if you burn as long as you’re warming those you love?”
The memory fades in and out, a patchwork of recollections. He thinks of Draco two years later, sunlight in his hair and stars at his back, mountains instead of condos, highways instead of alleys. Draco got his license right after Harry did, despite his birthday being earlier, but he’d always let Harry drive.
“Chopsticks, somewhere.” Draco rummages through his bag, the ramen abandoned on the bed. “You can shower if you want. I left you some shampoo.”
Harry smiles. He pokes through the array of colourful cardboard cylinders. Draco didn’t like the chicken flavored ones - he had mentioned it to Harry off-handedly once, hated the way it seemed to taste so much more artificial than the others.
The rest of the evening was markedly less exciting. There seemed to be some drama among the seventh-years, resolved when two crying girls turned on a Slytherin boy and gave him two fingers each before running onto the dancefloor to rock out to Missy Elliot. Britney was one of the last to leave, insisting that she had to help the elves clean up, but Minnie pushed her out the door with a firm, “Good night, Miss Smith” and a gentle shove into Elspeth’s waiting arms.
“I stomped on your face. I tried to kill Dumbledore. I betrayed Hogwarts. I murdered a Squib, I tortured fellow Hogwarts students. I mean, I was a fucking bad person. A life term in Azkaban would have been generous. I should have been Kissed. My father was sure that cooperating with the Wizengamot would decrease his own punishment. I think he was pleased to reveal my transgressions. Not that I was gay, of course. That wasn’t about to become public knowledge. Preserve the Malfoy honor and all that. He thought if he told the Wizengamot everything I did, he wouldn’t get Kissed.”
“Well, there’s no way you could know,” Pansy said in a light tone. “It’s not like our names are on the shop.”
“We’re free Saturday,” he managed, “but you’d have to tell me your favorite type of cake so I could make it.”
He’d sketched something that looked like a succulent, but instead of fleshy, smooth lobes, these had strange ridges and loops that looked a bit like chain mail.
“Then there’s the issue of the Winter Ball—” Harry snapped back. This was his shit. “Professor Potter has proposed that a wizarding ‘dee-jay’ be hired to play magical and Muggle songs.”
He rose and waved his wand, sending an almost opaque blue cube into the center of the table. Seconds later, a transparent red sphere joined it. As they bumped alongside each other, Draco continued, “For years, we’ve been trained to see magical and muggle history as two separate entities, with muggles—” with a flick of his wand, the blue cube sent spikes into the red sphere—“interfering in our affairs, thus situating wizards as the victims. However, historical research has demonstrated that the two worlds have been interlaced for thousands of years.”
Ron put his scone down and leaned forward. “Blaise is an Unspeakable. I think he’s like, head of some division or something. They sent him up here with me because he’s the Ministry’s expert on magical jewels? Ah, shit, maybe I wasn’t supposed to say that. Don’t tell anyone,” he said, pointing a finger at Harry. “I mean, I trust you, but don’t tell anyone anyway.”
1 brought a new challenge when Marcus started as Hogwarts’ Quidditch coach and flying instructor! We’ve heard all your questions and are going to set the record straight. We did not kill Madame Hooch and Marcus is not wearing her pointed boots. She’s retired to a beautiful little cottage near her beloved Puddlemere (we knew all along she was partisan). Marcus has some very nice new Quidditch leathers that Oliver’s enjoying when he’s not working like a dog for the Magpies. Maybe Hogwarts needs two flying instructions, Minnie?
They didn’t have to wait long for an invitation to the Oliver-Winger household. Audrey announced at the next faculty meeting that her daughter Alina was turning eleven on the eleventh, and that they were all invited down to their cottage for a bit of cake.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose again. “It’s not that complicated, Potter. Look, the next time we’re in London, we’ll go to the British Library. I’ll show you. It’s really not that difficult. You can probably find loads of interesting muggle things for your course, too,” he said, almost as an afterthought.
The next three weeks were terrible. Harry spent that first weekend sewing historically accurate Elizabethan era costumes for his fifth-year class and mulling over how Malfoy’s history had just spilled out of him. It was inexcusable. Malfoy had killed a Squib. Malfoy had broken Harry’s nose on the Hogwarts Express. Malfoy had yelled blood purist shit at Hermione. Malfoy had tried to kill Dumbledore. Not that Dumbledore had always acted to protect Harry—no, Dumbledore had raised him to be a sacrificial lamb—something Harry had spent months working through with his therapist—but the thought stuck in his throat until he shook his head. He didn’t know what to do. He couldn’t forgive Malfoy, but it seemed just as fucked up to hate him for actions he now regretted, and he couldn’t continue with the Flirting Plan. He sent a quick note to Ron and Hermione (
I hereby invoke the right of the paterfamilias of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black, summoning you to your rightful home.
Malfoy looked up at him from underneath sparkling eyelashes, then flicked his gaze back to the table and floated a tankard of spiked butterbeer towards Harry.
Malfoy tutted and said, “Since your sense of fashion seems to be permanently stuck in some kind of teenage grunge phase, I just thought I could offer my services.”
She sloshed some champagne into their glass and then her own, but before she could set the bottle back on the carpet, there was a third glass hovering near her.
Malfoy’s ears were still pink. Harry could see that the flush spread across his collarbones. Grossly protruding. He could button his shirt up a bit more. What was he, a lothario.
“It’s a bit whiffy,” Hermione said as she perched on the arm. She bent over to scratch their head, and Harry moaned—a good moan, thankfully—and mumbled into the couch. “Are you allowing hamsters to nest in here?”
He skimmed the next few paragraphs, where Draco laid out the series of forces that had influenced his decision to become a wizarding fascist, chief among them the desire for his father’s approval in the face of paternal homophobia.
“Glad I could be of assistance,” Draco almost purred, his eyes demurely downcast. “Even if you did have to tie me up rather than just ask politely.”
Harry gulped the dregs of the pumpkin juice to avoid staring at how Addie’s hand lingered on Padma’s arm. They were whispering to each other about. Love, love, love. Ugh.
Draco nodded, his face suddenly serious. “Yes, but we’ve got to take precautions. We shouldn’t search alone at the house, in case they’re actually dangerous undercover dark wizards dressed up as a seemingly ordinary country wizarding family.”
Neville swallowed. This wasn’t even really The Talk. This was a lite plant version of The Talk. If it got bad or weird, he could just sort of float away and start talking about rhizomes or soil quality. Ok. It was ok.
“No one really cares, here, unless they’re trying to seduce you because a lot of scientists think field stations are orgy central. Which, yeah, maybe for some people, and that’s great. Which is maybe why I find it helpful to be so out. Like, yeah, come to Bulgaria, but don’t try to seduce me—it’s a waste of time. That’s why I made this jacket,” he says, showing me the back of his leather jacket, covered in a giant patch with horizontal black, white, grey, and purple stripes. “Ace pride! Plus, since all pride flags have special protective spells woven into the fabric, it’s great for working with my flame-producing colleagues.”
“Everyone else is like,” they waved a hand around the party, “paired up and they’re not budging because it’s getting closer and closer to midnight.”
“Good morning, boys,” Andromeda said, coming around the island to give them each a floury kiss on the cheek. “Sit, sit, I’m just cooking the final crêpes now. Elen was up all night with the jams and sauces—even though I told her she didn’t have to—and it’s just divine.”
“Oh, you don’t have to come,” Neville said as he rose. “I have to go get some plants and I sent Andy a note to tell Draco that if he wanted to get some extra hours, he could.”
“Malfoy,” Lavender said. “I’m a medium. You can believe me or not, but I know how to read the emotional valences of objects.”
Draco murmured a drying spell towards Harry’s sleeve and gave Pansy a look. Harry was still a bit shaken from her threat and was trying to avoid eye contact with the tiny, terrifying woman.
“You and I have … very different hair.” Andre gestured to his tight curls. “I mean, Bastian or Draco probably have hair more like yours.”
Andromeda tried not to let her confusion show. “He’s Sirius’s husband, so they spend Christmas together.”
“You know I’m going to start at Hogwarts next September,” Neville said, with great effort to keep his voice calm.
“I, uh, learned how to bake,” she forced herself to explain. “My, uh, charity work. With the elves. Laundry and cooking and cleaning. No magic. It was hell at first.”
The latter sentence was drowned out, at least to Harry, by Teddy’s frantic yelling. He’d given up on Draco and was patting Harry down for hidden presents.
But Harry was trying to think of something to say that didn’t mention Malfoy’s abs, arse, or arms, none of which were visible at this moment, so citing them would imply that Harry had been considering said body part for a while, which was not, absolutely not, the vibe he wanted to give off to a colleague. Just because he was hot didn’t mean he deserved to be sexually harassed on the stairs outside his bedroom. Even if he did say Harry was handsome. That could be a work-appropriate comment.
“The thing that matters,” she said, “is undoing this spell now. Astoria is severely ill, and Draco can’t leave her side.”
“To make sure you weren’t doing anything evil!” Harry almost shouted. Why did things just leap out of his mouth around Draco?
Susan’s head lolled to one side. Astoria swept the hair away from her face. “Please, please, please,” she whispered, over and over, then bent to kiss Susan’s forehead, but when she pressed her lips to Susan’s skin, it burned.
The owner of the magical world’s premiere gay club dashed back into their office, shut the door, and did a little dance of joy. Things were all coming together.
If Malfoy had been flirting with him, then Malfoy was interested, and if Malfoy was interested, then Malfoy would want to be close to him, and if Malfoy got close to him, then he could figure out Malfoy’s syllabus, and if he knew Malfoy’s syllabus, then he could put Malfoy in this same awkward position of having perfectly planned a lesson and having it blow up in his face with a swift, “Sir, Professor Potter just taught us about the Cold War. Yes, sir, all of it. In great detail and with great nuance about the complicated relationship between the United States and Russia and the proxy wars in the global south.”
“Don’t you have work?” That sounded a bit pointed, fuck. Ron knew he had a crush on Harry, and he’d even tried wingmanning Florian once, but actually, Ron was less useful than a plate of worms, and somehow that evening at the Broomsticks, he’d ended up staying way too late watching Hannah Abbott flirt with Harry. But he didn’t think Harry hadn’t gone home with her. Harry didn’t go home with anyone. Or they hadn’t gone home with anyone since Ginny.
“I had the WAWFAN meeting. And then Malfoy and I got into a bit of a tussle because he agreed that we should like, have a sex ed panel and that we should go on a fieldtrip to Edinburgh to like, a sex store?!”
She bit her lip. She couldn’t ask if Malfoy was gay. She and Ron had debated that back and forth from the moment they’d finished reading Ginny’s owl. It was definitely rude to ask, because even though both of them were bi, they went to the Thursday meetings sporadically, and it felt like a breach of confidence to ask Harry or anyone else to out Malfoy. If he was out at all.
“I hardly know what that woman is thinking at any given time. She’s just about as loony as Lovegood.”
“And even that was a bit much.” Harry washed down a prawn with a swig of non-alcoholic butterbeer. “They weren’t even really grinding. Just sort of pre-groping.”
“Fine,” Harry said, and pulled out a pad of sticky notes from his drawer. He scrawled a name, phone number, and address down and handed the note to Draco. “That’s my wizarding therapist. Her name’s Eileen. She’s from an old West Country wizarding family, so she probably knows all about your … uh, traditions.”
Not that he’d really be dancing. He was going to be there for chaperoning purposes, Ebublio at the tip of his wand.
And then he was leaning forward, pressing his lips against Draco’s, and when Draco’s mouth opened beneath his, it felt like coming home. It was like soft yellow light and the perfect cup of tea and warm blankets wrapped around him. He had his world and his future in his arms. They’d both fought so hard, and they’d found peace and resilience in each other. It was a gentle, breathing magic that wrapped itself around their beating hearts. It was love. It couldn’t be anything else. And Harry knew that, ten years later, all was well.
Remus just looked at them evenly. A few years ago, Sirius would have roared right back, but now he waited. They both waited.
“Why are you here, darling?” She settled behind her desk, pushing the pile of ungraded papers towards the edge—thank God LIMS no longer required submissions on scrolls or parchment—and leaned back in her chair.
“It didn’t work. They gave him the Kiss anyway. They were going to send me to Azkaban, but my mother still had some pull in the Ministry.” He let out a broken laugh. “They exiled my mother and I for five years. I still don’t know what she did, not really, to get that outcome. I doubt it was strictly legal.” Malfoy was staring down at their limbs.
“Harry,” Minerva called, “I was wondering if you could show Draco to the young professors’ accommodations.”
Hours passed between boisterous carols, several boxes of chocolates, and lots of gossip. Teddy had face-planted on the carpet and was gently snoring when they realized it might be time to go home.
The table literally groaned when they all wedged themselves around it. The conversation was quick and filled with loving jibes. Harry tried to let Teddy win the crackers, but they were drawn to his stronger magic and kept shooting glitter at him. Teddy got all the trinkets anyway. He stumbled through the terrible jokes, and then demanded everyone else’s as “practice, like my teacher said!” It helped that the Weasleys would roar at each terrible pun like they’d never heard it before.
Sirius immediately passed the threads back to Kreacher and nodded, stiffening as he always did when he had to fulfill his duties as Head of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black.
Harry raised his eyebrows. “Luna? The one who thinks the earth is a parallelogram that rests on the back of a turtle? That Luna?”
Malfoy’s abs were cursed. That was the only rational explanation. Some elder gay wizard had indoctrinated him into a dark magic that glued men’s eyes to his torso. That was it. Yep. A dreadful ab curse.
Harry bounced in his seat. “God, I can’t wait. Granger-Weasley babies, God, it’s gonna be dope! You’re going to be amazing parents!” He couldn’t contain his excitement and started excitedly slapping Malfoy’s arm, then realized that Malfoy would find this irritating, and stopped. But Malfoy was just smiling at him and shaking his head.
Out of the mouths of fucking babes, Harry thought, and clenched his jaw. “Well, Draco and I probably just like the same type of animals, Ted, so it’s probably not very meaningful, all in all. I’m sure your teachers have talked about coincidences and how not everything has some huge meaning, so …” Harry didn’t know where to go from there with that thought, so he just shut up.
She rolled her eyes and squeezed his hand three times. Their silent I love you. He squeezed hers back.
“Oh, Pansy, how lovely!” Andromeda said as she swept into the kitchen. Pansy half stood, crouching over the table, as Andromeda snatched a glass and left with a trill of goodbye and have fun, darlings.
True to his words, Malfoy cheered equally for both teams, though his polite clapping was somewhat overshadowed by Harry’s wolf-whistle. It lasted a whopping five hours before the Hufflepuff seeker grabbed the snitch just under the professors’ box while falling off her broom. Harry had to close his eyes, but there was a hand on his arm and a voice whispering, “Andre’s got her, don’t worry.”
He’d gone to the local non-magical comprehensive and college and uni and was two years into a finance job in the City when his mum had called.
Since that day, Malfoy bothered him for Muggle murder mysteries. “I don’t know where to get them,” he’d insist, clinging to Harry’s latest Scandinavian blockbuster. He laid in wait for Harry to finish the books, and would pop into Harry’s classroom between lessons, or come knocking at Harry’s door in the evenings. “You’ve had it for ages,” he’d wheedle.
Taking a shot in the dark (well, more of a viciously educated guess) Harry said tightly:  “You were a Death Eater, too.”
It was fine. This was all fine. Harry James Potter, aged twenty-six, war hero, former Horcrux, survived Voldemort just to be killed by Malfoy’s thighs. He flopped back onto the pillow and closed his eyes.
“Ugh,” she said, “Don’t call me that.” They air kissed, and Pansy snuggled herself into Draco’s side.
“Oh, how deeply offensive,” Draco said with a little sigh. “Have you been de-fanged recently? You used to be a much more worthy opponent, though you were never particularly talented at verbal sparring.”
No, Malfoy had just gotten to the page with the bookmark. He paused for a moment. And then he started reading out loud from the exact paragraph Harry had left off on. Leaning back into the pillows, Harry wondered what his sixteen-year-old self would say about this—tucked up in bed with Draco Malfoy reading Agatha Christie at him as fog pressed in on the windows.
“Only you, Kreacher,” Sirius said, “would turn a compliment on your cooking into some kind of threat.”
The last time he’d worn this sherwani was Ron and Hermione’s wedding. He’d thought black was a bit severe and an unlucky color for a wedding, but Ron had told him it would go with his tux (black tie, obviously, even if it was at the Burrow), and the gold would pick up their gold wedding rings when the three of them stood at the altar. He’d been best man and maid of honor, though those were outdated, sexist, and gender-normative terms. And he’d cried the whole ceremony. Ginny had snuck out of her seat in the front row to trade Hermione’s bouquet for a packet of tissues. For Harry. Who tried to be silent. But that just meant he couldn’t blow his nose and snot was running freely down his chin. Harry shook his head at the memory, a smile creeping up on his face. George had whispered some spell at him, and he found his eyes were dry. Dry-heaving it was. Molly was also sobbing, so he wasn’t completely alone. And Hermione didn’t cry (she couldn’t stop smiling), but Harry saw a tear run down Ron’s freckled cheek. They were his people. And they were in love. And they were going to be together forever.
“Yeah, I’ve the most experience with dark artefacts, thanks to you, mate, and Blaise is good at the jewelry stuff, so, yeah. We’re working on it.”
Draco exhaled with the air of a long-suffering child who’d been denied pudding even after eating all of his vegetables.
“Why don’t you do something from that American show you watch with the er, roses, or—” Sirius waved his hand in the air.
“No, it does, I want to know.” He felt like he had to say something else. “I’m your colleague, and like, maybe your friend?”
“But anyway, I talked about the ideas I’ve been having about the book. Draco gasped and was like, that’s why my dad hated Dumbledore. Because like, really, people don’t get that upset about school policies or whatever.”
“What is this little thing?” Draco said, completely unfazed by Harry’s strange word choice. “It sticks? But it’s not like, sticky?”
The first few weeks of term passed smoothly. Harry’s ears perked up when his fifth-years came into his class on Tuesdays—directly after a double period with Malfoy—but he couldn’t glean much. They seemed chipper. They must be sleeping through Malfoy’s tedious lessons.
“Anyway, that’s not the point. The point is that he and Ron were here for a B&E in Hogsmeade, but what was stolen was a piece of cursed jewelry.”
Harry turned away for a moment, and then whirled round and cast a sticking spell that glued Malfoy to the chair.
“Multimillionaires hardly count as kept men,” Remus countered. “Rock stars certainly don’t. If anything, I’m the kept one.”
“Great,” Sirius said. “I think it will be really nice. Toast to the end of the whole marriage contract thing.”
Harry was saved from any further conversation by the sudden explosion of a pumpkin near the Slytherin table. It released crimson canaries that flew around shitting flames and dive-bombing students. McGonagall snapped out of her soliloquy and shot a jet of water across the entire Hall. Students and professors alike gaped.
Malfoy drew himself up, took a deep breath, and crossed his arms. His voice sounded a bit thinner than usual as he said, “I spent the last years in exile from wizarding Britain and seem to have missed the spectacle of your coming out, Potter.”
“Hm,” she said, then pointed at a bread roll, which sprouted a lionlike head, limbs, and a tail, clambered over to Posie and bared its teeth in a roar. She squealed and tried to grab it.
“My father’s are red and my mum’s are blue. We’ve all got purple eyes,” she said, “Me and Claude and Viv and Benny.” She scowled. “Mum says it’s because we’ve got some of each of us in them.”
Meeting with Draco Malfoy a year after his release from Azkaban. Auror Otto Pembroke (DMLE case manager) and Andromeda Tonks also present.
He spun on his heel and stormed out of the classroom. His robes billowed behind him. Should Harry tell him he was becoming a bit Snape-like in his old age? No, no, better to leave that as future ammunition. Well, future ammunition for if this flirting plan failed.
He groaned and dropped into the armchair, lazily waving his wand and transforming a shoe into a chair for Ron.
“Hey,” Harry said, tilting Draco’s chin up. His grey eyes fluttered open. “You’ve become good. You’ve fought so hard to become so good.”
Harry realized everyone was staring at him. The kids surrounding Draco had parted, and Draco was looking expectantly at Harry.
“Oh,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t know how to do that.” He still had occasional nightmares about Madam Pince.
“He alright, mate?” the cabbie had said as Harry had paid, glancing at Draco, who was swinging the bag again while waiting on the curb.
“It’s Malfoy,” Harry said, resurfacing. They swiped a little at their eyes. Fleur made a noise in the back of her throat, and Harry turned towards her. She ran her finger under each eye to wipe away the smudged eyeliner and errant glitter, then studied them and nodded in approval.
They were looking skinnier than usual, Remus noted with narrowed eyes, and pushed a cup of coffee into their hands.
Astoria felt Draco’s entire body stiffen. He began edging away from her. She tilted her head and squeezed his hand.
But that pathway was dangerous, so Harry turned his attention to the rest of his colleagues. Time to argue that what he’d just done was educational. “As you can see, while it can be a rather insinuating style of dancing, it also doesn’t involve any actual sexual activity.”
“Er,” Harry said. He hadn’t seen her since she’d tried to hand him over to Voldemort.  Or hypothetically tried. It hadn’t worked. Harry attempted not to be fussed. “I’m not his keeper.”
“My costume is pertinent to my field of teaching. Unlike whatever this is,” he said, waving his hand at the glowing Malfoy next to him. Malfoy’s white-blonde hair was slicked back and glistened softly in the candlelight. His cheekbones sparkled, and his long white robe was so low cut (really, thought Harry, they were at a school), that Harry could see the delicate blue veins that spread across his chest. Even his collarbones glimmered with a gentle blue effervescence. But it wasn’t just makeup, Harry realized, as he looked down at Malfoy’s hand curled around the goblet. A few centimeters of the air all around him glowed with a soft grey light.
“I’m so glad you’re here,” Parvati said. She sounded like she meant it. Even after that wine-drunk kiss that led to nothing and nowhere. “You can meet Hector.”
And once when Harry had been staring a hole into the side of Draco’s head at dinner, Draco turned, smiled, panicked, frowned, and then rushed out of the Great Hall.
Pansy scoffed. That was the correct response, as though a handjob nine years ago meant something to her heart. And it didn’t, in some ways, it really didn’t, because she didn’t want to see his dick right now, or maybe ever, but there was still a tender spot, that this was more than a toss off in a broom cupboard. It had never been meant to go anywhere, because they all knew about the Astoria thing. The contract thing.
Remus filled in the squares, then spared Sirius a glance. He actually hadn’t moved, which was a bit concerning, because usually SIrius would have wriggled his way into Remus’ lap by this point of a Sunday morning seduction, so Remus reached for his wand, ran a quick diagnostic, and then sighed.
Harry looked down at the metallic embroidery, which seemed to have dented Malfoy’s face. “Oh, yeah, well, Indians don’t mess about, like, so it’s real gold. Thought you’d appreciate that, Malfoy.”
Harry shook his head. “They’re not called that, though. If you ask for that, the shop person won’t know what you’re talking about. You won’t pass.”
Harry clenched his fists, his blood running cold. How dare Malfoy deny his own past? His own family?
Yelling incoherently, Teddy collected his offerings from Malfoy as well and raced off to deposit them on the long dining room table.
That was kind of a non sequitur. She raised an eyebrow. She’d never been quite as good, and she could tell that she still hadn’t quite gotten it right from the way his left eye narrowed.
In the same low voice, he continued, “And it was like, so, so, good? I didn’t know that—well, anyway. And then he ended up getting lunch with me during a break in the conference the next day, and then when I said I had to get back to Northumberland, he was like, ‘I could visit you, unless that’s too much,’ and he seemed kind of shy? Which, Luna—he’s stunning and so—well, it was unexpected.”
“Wait, seriously?” Harry was shocked. “Molly would be over the moon to get another son-in-law. She dotes on her boys! And even more on the boys that she got later in life!” He paused. “I guess Percy hasn’t been around since Ginny came out, though. Molly tried to knit a sweater that says “Proud Mom to Gay Kids” but it came out a bit lumpy and looks like it says “Proud Gay Mom” but like, she still wears it.”
Hermione let that trail off, and there was a snicker near the door, which then opened and slammed shut and the particles in the room settled back down, and Hermione sighed, stretched her neck, and clicked her purple pen.
“Ah, no. They’re having tonight at home which,” Harry raised an eyebrow, “I’m pretty sure has something to do with some of the more exotic presents Remus chose.”
Susan’s arm twitched. Astoria reached down to stroke it, but wherever she touched Susan, welts bloomed.
Hermione was out there with facts and statistics regarding the high efficacy rate of the pill when used correctly, how condoms prevented STIs and pregnancy if used correctly, how anyone with a vagina should always pee after sex to decrease the likelihood of getting a UTI (Harry wasn’t sure how that was related to birth control, but it seemed like useful information), how they could acquire Plan B at local muggle pharmacies, and then Luna opened her mouth and dreamily said, “Never do it on the full moon. That’s when the nargles are at the peak of their power, ready to implant a baby into a willing parent.”
“Honestly, Potter, I cushioned the entire ballroom the minute he grabbed your ridiculous little broom,” Malfoy huffed. He had his wand tucked behind one ear, and it reminded Harry a bit of Luna. If Luna were prickly and had a sharp jawline.
She picked up the server and removed the slice to a plate. They bent around it, concealing the cake from general view.
“It was completely mortifying when the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang discovered we only learned English at Hogwarts! Mortifying! Luckily I spoke French so I was able to make friends with a few of the Beauxbatons boys—”
They shook their head, bit their lip, and then, in a slightly lilting tone, recited: “He visits my town once a year. He fills my mouth with kisses and nectar. I spend all my money on him.”
Seven hours later the Great Hall rebounded with noise as the students caught up with friends after a long summer away. Harry rested his chin in his hand and pretended to not notice the stares directed his way at the head table. He had made an attempt with his hair and was buttoned into his navy-blue robes.
She was in a hospital bed. Hermione was shuffling through papers, Sirius was pacing, Draco was leaning against the wall, and, strangely, Bertram was sitting next to her, holding her hand.
“Fuck, mate, that’s wild. Percy and Oliver engaged. Wow.” Harry laughed. “Wait, how do I get invited to the wedding?”
Harry was stunned into silence. His mind was doing the fuzzy thing again, and he felt the edges of a headache curling up inside his skull.
For a long time, Vane didn’t even manufacture potions relating to lust, desire, or sexuality. “I didn’t want to make a product that could hurt anyone. My first potions were simple healing draughts. You can’t overdose on those, or use them in a harmful way.”
And now he was sitting there, usually so confident in his broad shoulders and thick arms and capable thighs, suddenly thirteen again and bumbling around after a long-dead toad.
I look forward to hearing about your progress. Our office has been unable to unearth further precedents.
“You’ll just have to wait to see if I trail you all over this little celebration, won’t you?” Draco asked, his eyes twinkling. Harry had to blink to make sure he wasn’t hallucinating. A twinkling Malfoy. Would wonders never cease?
The first question was from Elspeth, which surprised Harry, until he realized that “What are some commonalities and differences between wizarding and muggle birth control?” was a question he might have written on a practice O.W.L.
Harry tried to position himself so he’d sit next to Draco, but Bastian swept his housemate off towards the other end of the table and Harry was stuck next to Addie-and-Padma (who were very emphatically together now and were feeding each other the little caviar nibbles) on one side, and Minnie on the other, who just kept gesturing at Addie and Padma with her coupe of champagne and mumbling about young love and how it was all so much more open than it had been in her day. It all made Harry feel hot and cross, and he took a bottle of champagne to his room and passed out at half-eleven.
“I don’t think I could dance to Muggle music,” Malfoy said with his eyebrows raised. “There’s so much jumping.” He shuddered dramatically.
Malfoy swallowed. Harry was put in mind of a snake unhinging its jaw. He could practically see the lump move down his throat. “No, the no-strings-attached stuff.”
[a photograph of teenagers hanging out in a park. They’re wearing jeans, hoodies, trainers. Two of them listen to an ipod. One eats a hamburger. Another teen eats french fries from a McDonald’s bag. A fourth and fifth teen kick a soccer ball between them]
Blaise wouldn’t normally have looked twice at someone in dungarees, but the way Neville filled them out—and he’d bent over to tie his boot or something, and Blaise allowed himself to just appreciate, his hands wrapped around the mug of tea.
Ron nudged Harry in the side and mouthed “preggers,” with a nod at Angelina. Harry fought the grin that threatened to burst out across his face. Like George, he buried himself in his drink. Luckily, that was when Andromeda and Teddy fell through the Floo, and from that moment on, Harry had his hands full with Teddy, who immediately morphed his hair to match Harry’s new style.
“Professor Potter!” a small first year shrieked at him, her straight black pigtails pulled into two tight French braids. “I’m Dorothy! From the Muggle book we read! Mum sent me the dress!” She twirled in her blue-and-white checked dress.
Malfoy made some kind of noise (disapproving, Harry assumed), and looked down at Harry’s chest again. Then he reached out and removed a prawn tail from where it had been caught by the embroidery. His mouth was attempting severity and disgust, but his eyes crinkled.
Harry didn’t see Draco for days. The elves told him that he was holed up in his room, “Writing, sir, lots of papers flying about,” and consuming large amounts of toast with Marmite. Harry could barely believe that Draco would eat Marmite, but he also knew that Kreacher had no incentive to drag Draco’s eating habits.
But that was a pipe dream. Bill yelled up the stairwell something about the car seat, which didn’t really make sense because they were taking an international portkey, but she settled Gabrielle into the sling.
“That’s nice, dear,” Mum said, thrusting another cup of tea in front of Ron. “Drink up, get your strength back.”
Harry found himself nodding along before realizing that Britney was always at the bottom of him doing something completely ridiculous.
He was so handsome and snarky and charming in a kind of shy and yet irritating way, and he dressed well and had a lovely reading voice and was out there educating kids about history and how complicated it was and why being gay was more than ok and he had a great arse in Quidditch leathers, probably great at all times, let’s be fair, and how could no one have noticed all those things in any of the twenty-six years he’d been on this planet?
Harry, suddenly feeling very hot, tried to take his sweater off but ended up with it stuck somehow on his glasses. But he didn’t really want to leave his sweater cave, so he pretended he couldn’t understand what she was implying about him and Malfoy, and said in a muffled voice, “Yeah, it’s fine, he’s a friend, I guess.”
Harry ground his teeth. No students had come for a good forty minutes, and he was just about to strangle Malfoy.
That was enough, he decided, and shuffled past Malfoy, who was still sitting like a right lump on the bench and folding and unfolding his sunglasses.
And she was going to have to write to Sirius to inform Malfoy about the whole contract thing if he hadn’t yet, because it was, according to her research, going to be difficult to break, but not impossible, but that was something that Malfoy would definitely have to be involved with personally. So she’d probably be seeing Malfoy sooner or later. Though it might be nice to re-meet him socially before having to demand that he open a vein or something equally grim.
Four weeks later, she was still at Hogwarts. Filius hadn’t died, but he hadn’t gotten better. He was in a ward at Mungo’s that didn’t allow visitors. She sent him chocolates twice a week. That probably wasn’t healthy. But he hated flowers.
Bill parted the wall of humans in front of their couch. Fleur made a confused face at him, because who knew what the fuck any of this was about, so Bill settled down on Harry’s other side.
“It’s not like she can get very far,” Hermione said with a shrug. “She is wearing stilettos and we’re in a craggy grassland.” Sirius put his hand to his temples.
Except here was Malfoy, pale and with his arms crossed, wearing an inscrutable expression that made Harry want to slap it off his face. Or slap his own hand over his idiot mouth, which seemed prone to babbling in Malfoy’s presence. And he was supposed to be one, watching Malfoy to make sure Malfoy wasn’t doing anything untoward, and two, getting revenge on Malfoy for one-upping him regarding Shakespeare. Who everyone knew was a Muggle. A very gifted Muggle. But a Muggle nonetheless, and therefore, Harry’s domain.
“God.” Sirius drops his head in his hands. “12 years. 12 fucking years I’ll never get back. God, I missed so much.”
He’s still furious, with Harry and with Dumbledore and the entire freaking Order. He can feel it, rage coiling around his bones, the anger making him feel light-headed. He’d always had an explosive temper, the type that ended up with shattered glasses and holes in walls.
He rolls his eyes. “We’re in the middle of nowhere. You think I believe you got a vegan chocolate bar from a shitty motel vending machine?”
hissed in the seconds before a dive. Those final, desperate seconds, the lunge before the wall, lungs burning, muscles aching, heartbeat pounding in his ears.
“Winter camp three years ago,” he says, and Draco’s face lights up with memory. “I raced you. 50 free.”
“Move,” Harry grumbles, unceremoniously shoving Draco off the counter. “Why are you even up so early? It’s not like we have practice or anything.”
They’ve had many conversations like this before - lying in bed in a hotel room at a meet, driving home from swim practice, in the showers and the change rooms. Harry smiles softly to himself - it’s a very
“I’m good.” The gas station is empty around them, all flickering lights and peeling paint. Harry breathes in, ignores the burn of gasoline fumes against his nose. “Are you getting anything?”
The bottle is cold against Harry’s hand when Draco passes it over. Draco’s index skims over the rise of Harry’s knuckles, the barest brush of movement and yet Harry swears he feels his hand burn. “Thanks.”
The creaking of the building. The hum of the fridge. Draco’s even breaths, loud in the silence. He looks like a ghost, half-faded and washed out, a distant memory of a boy immortalized in metal.
It’s all golden sand and waves. The sun is lower by the time they park, turning the water shades of bronze-green and amber. It slowly stretches over the surface of the ocean as they both make it down to the sand.
And when he searches for the stars above them, when he tries to find Draco where it was burned into the sky Harry closes his eyes and mouths
The punch takes him by surprise, a vicious uppercut to the soft bit of his stomach. Draco doubles over in surprise; dimly he hears Ron’s shout, sees Theo throw himself on top of him to keep him back. He winces, spitting a bit of blood out to the side, stomach rolling with pain.
Harry leaves Draco dozing in the car while he sorts out the room keys, in a foyer with linoleum floors and flickering fluorescent lights. The buzz of electricity fills his ears as he accepts the small pieces of plastic, scribbles his signature with a cheap pen, lets the door click shut behind him as he heads back towards the car.
He out-touched Draco by a heartbeat. Most of their races were like this, won by milliseconds, the space of time between two breaths. Harry was drunk on the taste of victory, on the sound of his teammates cheering and -
Draco’s face has gone white. He’s shock-still in the driver's seat, eyes fixed straight ahead. “You don’t get to be the one to say that.”
Dimly Harry realizes this might have been a bad idea. There’s always something to distract them while driving - the endless stretch of road, the setting sun, the stars. There’s always something he can use to keep his attention from snagging on Draco, a buffer he can slide between the magnetic pull of his eyes. He’s always been good at that, holding his breath and looking away.
Draco hums, a thoughtful noise. He throws his leg on top of Harry’s, heel digging into Harry’s calve. “Worlds. Two years ago. We were on the plane ride home and - everyone was exhausted. But I remembered I still thought you looked…” He gestures vaguely. “You know. How could I have resisted?”
“They’ll find our bodies here,” Draco says, in a detached sort of way. “Bones bleached by the sun, flesh torn off by crows.
Andy dropped her knitting. Shit, shit, shit, Draco was dying, someone had broken in and attacked him—she got up, then fell over the basket of yarn at her feet—when Draco burst into the room, brandishing a letter.
“Draco!” she yelled immediately, hoping her son would respond. His face appeared in the cottage window and she lurched towards him, but, her fucking feet were tied, so she fell over.
“Oh, very allowed. It’s always technically been legal, magically, anyway, well, according to magical law, but there was the whole,” Andromeda sighed and waved her hands around, “Closeting and blood purity thing in the 80s, so it wasn’t like, talked about. But it’s always been legal.”
“You bring out something weird in him, that’s for sure,” Ron said. “He’s never even offered to give me a lap dance.”
Harry exited the Great Hall without looking back. Malfoy was still shorter than him. He could run to catch up. Put his wee legs to good use. He wouldn’t speak first, he decided. Let Malfoy beg for his friendship.
She hung the phone up and skewered Sirius with her glare. “You have twenty-three minutes before that pizza gets here, Draco comes back downstairs, and you’ll have to present him with a very good fucking explanation.”
Talbott rested two fingers on his temple and tilted his head to watch them. “Boys,” he said with a sigh, and Harry was briefly offended until he realized that yeah, if he were a dad and the head auror, he’d have called himself a boy too, “You shouldn’t underestimate my wife.”
It started gnawing at him when Malfoy didn’t show up to dinner. He couldn’t stop jiggling his knee. Addie summoned an unused napkin and levitated it towards him. Harry gave her a confused look and she rolled her eyes.
“They haven’t pulled the cracker yet.” Kreacher folded one of his responses and dropped it in the crystal punch bowl. Sirius raised his eyebrows and nodded at Andy and Remus, as though this indicated that his, or Kreacher’s, behavior was somehow reasonable.
Have you asked Neville if he has an e-mail address? You mentioned in class that he has a computer, so he probably also uses e-mail. :D
“It’s kind of, er, well, here,” he said, and flipped to the business section. Neither of them cared about stocks. Andromeda wasn’t even quite sure what they were, but that nice bank manager sent her a letter each year reporting that her dividends were going up or something. That was a Ted thing, investments. Bless him.
Neville looked miserable. “I promised Ginny,” he mumbled. “Last time you, you know, the yellow one, and then when you tried aqua, you got that rash, and then, you know, Ginny.”
Her dad was from Ventura, California. He’d dropped acid in London, knocked up Susan’s mum, and fucked off to Australia before she’d realized she was pregnant. Cue several years of detectives and spells until he’d walked into Susan, literally kicked her in the back of the head by accident because he was looking at the top of the Nelson monument and she was sitting underneath it on a school field trip and her mum, summoned by the magical flare he’d inadvertently triggered, had screamed so many bad words that Mrs. McNulty had to send a letter home of apology with the rest of the year fours. But then there was some kissing, and he’d moved in the next week and made them eat hummus and do yoga and polluted Susan’s brain with strange words.
Lavender would have done the reflexive bisexual peace sign but both her hands were full. “Cool, cool, cool.”
“Of course,” Harry said, moving around the table to hug Sirius. They came and hung their head over Remus’ shoulder, a comforting weight. Remus breathed in the smell of Harry’s hair. The child they’d never had, the child they’d always wanted and, in some sense, always had. He and Sirius were the only ones left, and they’d be there for Harry until the end.
Harry recognizes fleeing when he sees it but he lets Draco go inside without calling it out. The air suddenly seems colder without Draco watching him, his body stretched out on the car. He lets out a long breath, fingers still clenched so tightly he thinks they might cramp.
Harry lifts his head then; Draco’s face is turned away from him, hidden in the soft blur of shadows. “Sorry?”
They surface together. The pool is shallow - the water reaches the bottom of Harry’s ribs, the floor smooth underneath his feet. Draco cards wet hands through wet hair and Harry feels his chest twist. He’s not used to seeing Draco like this - cap and goggles gone, head tilted up at the ceiling, water dripping down his shoulders and back. The pool reflects ghostly light up into his face, shades of aquamarine and cyan, ripples of silver and white. Draco stares back at him - his eyes are wide, lips slightly parted and Harry tears his eyes away.
Harry thumbed through his phone - his text thread with Draco was still open. He scrolled down - his last message that he sent to Draco was simple.
Their car breaks down. It was bound to happen, Harry thinks bitterly, as Draco slams the hood shut and kicks at the side of the road. Of course it had to happen now, on the side of the near-empty highway, the sun blazing down on the two of them. Of course it had to happen amidst all the tension, stilted silences and weighted pauses, Draco determinedly avoiding Harry’s eyes.
The dream fades away though, replaced with the burning sun and the heaviness of Draco’s eyes. Harry scrubs a hand over his face - the heat wasn’t helping to take the edge off his anger.
Outside Harry feels like he can think a bit better, away from the hum of the washing machine, the arch of Draco’s body. He sucks in a lungful of air, warm and dusty. It feels almost stereotypically summer - that strange huskiness to the wind that only ever appeared at night. He looks up at the stars and searches - it takes a few seconds but he finds Draco’s stars just barely hidden under the edge of the roof. It’s become a bit of a routine for him now - the lines of Draco’s constellation have practically been burned into his memory.
He takes a deep breath. The car feels looser now, more open. He slides Draco’s phone into the cup holder and stares out the window. “Good to go?”
“Fuck you,” Harry mutters. The bed is lumpy, the covers itchy against his legs. He rolls over, pulls the blankets up over his shoulders.
“Please?” Draco asks, voice catching slightly. He grins, Cheshire-like, the glint of his teeth and the tilt of his head.
They watch as the wind pulls the waves higher, tips their edges with crests of white foam. The sun slowly disappears underneath the ocean, trailing streaks of colours across the sky. The stars bloom into existence, a thousand blossoms of white and silver.
“Sorry,” he mutters. He yanks his hood over his head - suddenly he feels very, very cold. “Are we leaving?”
Draco gets to his feet quickly, leaning back against the wall. He’s learnt that appearing casual made others lower their guard. The man’s quiet chuckle lets him know that his action had not been missed.
Their voices fade to background noise, whispers compared to the noise in Harry’s head. Dimly he realizes his phone in his hand - 2:30 pm it reads, and Harry realizes with a jolt that they’ve been out here for more than two hours.
Draco smiles then. It’s one of his real smiles; one corner of his lips tilted up, a crooked line across his face. “Scared, Potter?”
Harry laughs, tilts his head back and swallows the last of it. It’s warm and flat, sugar sticking to his teeth. He runs his tongue over his lips and looks back towards Draco. “Don’t blame me when you drive us over the edge of a cliff.”
“I got a drink, not a bloody house.” Harry passes the Sprite to Draco - he chugs down a mouthful almost mechanically, grimacing slightly at the fizz. He blinks up at him - Draco looks exhausted, eyes drooping and fluttering shut. Harry studies his eyelashes - he remembers the feel of them against his skin. “Don’t sleep,” he says, softly. “Draco? Don’t go to sleep.”
“Why?” Draco murmurs. His face is buried behind his hands, sleeves pulled down to form half-paws over his fingers. “‘M so tired.”
Almost reluctantly he pressed the dial. Draco hated mornings - they’ve had too many swim meets where he’d slept through the alarms, head buried under his pillow. Harry usually ended up having to wake him up - shaking his limp body back and forth, fingers curled around bare shoulders and thumbs pressed into scapulas.
Harry bites his lip, hard enough that he tastes blood. “We’ll be fine. I’m sure it’s just rush hour. It’ll clear up in the next hour or so. Don’t worry.”
, breathless from the race, hoarse from the water, how Harry could hear his smile in the catch at the end -
He once read a story, somewhere, about a girl whose soul was ripped in two. How she kept one half of it but gave the other to her lover, and for as long as she lived she was protected not only by herself but by the one she loved as well. He wonders if that’s how life worked - little pieces given to other people, secrets spread out all over the world. He wonders if that’s how he’ll be remembered, in pieces, never to be whole again.
Draco’s always been a deep sleeper - he’d come to morning practices barely conscious, eyes hidden underneath the shadows of his hood. Harry hums to himself, confident that the light would soon wake him and turns his attention to the bags scattered on the ground.
Inside it’s blissfully air conditioned. Harry lets Draco save them a booth while he goes up and orders. He gets them chicken nuggets and chips - and, just to be a bastard - a happy meal for Draco. It arrives in a little cardboard box; Harry sets it on the corner of his tray as he heads towards Draco.
“They kicked me out,” Draco said. He’s determinedly not looking at Harry - Harry caught the barest line of a shoulder, the faintest curve of a neck.
The sound of rain against the windscreen wakes him. Harry groans, pushing himself up with shaking hands. Water collects on the roof, spilling over the glass in translucent threads, a river of shifting colours and lines. His neck aches, from whatever fucked-up position he fell asleep in - he had a bad habit of sleeping curled up, legs tucked up and spine bent over his knees. The seat next to him is empty. Harry frowns - he almost always woke before Draco did.
They’re haunted, that fragile gleam of desperation one push away from breaking but Draco lets out a huff of relief anyways. Harry squeezes his hand, so tightly Draco almost winces before letting go.
Draco can just barely see past him to Harry, kneeling motionless on the ground. His head is bent, his hair hiding his face but Draco can tell from the shaking of his shoulders that he was sobbing, hands fisted by his side.
“Ground floor. There’s a vending machine next to it, apparently. We can get Gatorade too. Pretend we’re at a meet again.”
Except it wasn’t. Except all Harry could see was his time slipping away, sand falling through splayed fingers, a candle burning down to nothing. Harry opened his mouth and drank as much of everything as he could, tried to convince himself that he was finished, he was done and yet he still wanted more. He always wanted more.
!” Draco calls out as Harry shoves his way into the kitchen, slamming an empty mug onto the counter. Ron had gotten it for him as an 18th birthday present - one of those tacky souvenir ones that seemed to have sprouted up everywhere after the war.
Harry leans over - it’s some sort of telescope, with colorful plastic lenses that snapped on and off to filter the world in shades of red and yellow and blue. He slips one on, holds it up to his eye - he can barely see Draco through the cloudy lens. “A telescope,” he says, just to be annoying.
Draco had picked the place out, half-forgotten on a small side street, the windows boarded and the door locked. Harry had thought he was crazy at first, crazy for wanting an old wreck like this was.
“You’re going to freeze,” Harry says. His voice sounds thin over the patter of rain, the crash of the tide.
written down one sleeve in black letters. Harry flips the shirt around, traces the heavy block of names until he finds his own,
. Gold and green glitter sprinkled down on the entrants, and the fairy lights wrapped around the chains somehow gave what should have been a gaudy catastrophe a classy and gentle effect. Harry suddenly remembered that the Ball was hip-hop themed.
Malfoy wouldn’t stop laughing. It wasn’t the screechy, evil cackle of his teen years. But it kept going and going, ringing in Harry’s ears until he yelled, “Shut up, Malfoy! It’s not funny. I’m much better than you at Quidditch. Shut up.”
“The Manor was repossessed,” Remus said, “Narcissa’s in France. He needed some kind of sponsor. Andromeda agreed.”
“Fine,” Draco said, shrugging out of his coat and placing it on a nearby counter. He crossed his arms and said in an even tone, “We are two secondary school teachers who have been tasked with coming up with an LGTBQIA-friendly sexual education panel for fourteen- to seventeen-year-olds and we have come to your store to purchase several items to be used for demonstration or as examples of things students may one day encounter or wish to purchase for themselves at some point in the future. When they are of age.”
“I could demonstrate further sub-styles, rap, hip-hop, whatever. I’m no dancing fiend, but I do know a few moves.”
Blaise fought the urge to rise to his tiptoes to see his former housemate, onetime best friend, the first boy he’d imagined kissing, and Andromeda rolled her eyes and turned away from the house.
Filius was complaining about graffiti in the Ravenclaw boys’ bathroom. Blink. Owain the Groundskeeper brought up the dangers of the escaped Flesh-Eating Slugs, to which Hagrid raised a valiant defense that had Harry questioning whether Hagrid believed in containing any kind of dangerous animal, which seemed like taking Gryffindor courage a bit too far. Patrick broke in and said he’d had several kids with facial disfigurements and a curious unwillingness to discuss the circumstances of their injuries in the Hospital Wing, which, to him, strongly suggested that the fucking bairns were throwing them at each other.
“Nah, mate, can’t help you,” Harry muttered. He had three hours to whip up a Halloween costume—he’d promised five house points to the student who first guessed what he was—but that required some kind of witty and Muggle-related fancy dress.
Thus occupied, he unlocked the door to his room and found none other than Ron Weasley in his armchair.
There was no labored breathing behind him. Just a moment of silence before Malfoy passed him. Malfoy paused at the top of the staircase, his hair perfectly in place. The torchlight was probably disguising the patchiness of his closely-cropped beard.
Lavender adjusted her miniskirt. She stopped by the iron gate and pressed one hand against the pilaster. Out of the mumbling of the thousands who’d passed through these gates, a clarion voice rose up, repeating that this was the Greengrass estate, that visitors were welcome and would enjoy hospitality without limits.
Follow up meeting with client, Andromeda Tonks, and myself on May 8, 2006 at 1:00 pm at Andromeda Tonks’ residence, The Howes, Otterburn, Newcastle upon Tyne (accessible via Floo Network).

Harry laughed and felt magic bubbling out of him and ebbing into the night. He elbowed Draco affectionately and was only slightly surprised when Draco didn’t shove him back. Everything felt softer in the darkness. Softer, and open, and filled with love.
Harry spat and rinsed his mouth. He put his toothbrush next to the sink and looked at himself in the mirror.
“No, I’m fine,” Harry said at last, a bit unsure if Malfoy was still there. His voice was still a bit wobbly. “Just got into one of these loo books.”
“There are some cheddar and chive and then some ginger ones; I tried to wrap them separately, but it seemed dumb to use two whole boxes for a few scones, but then I hope that doesn’t mean that the flavors have melded,” she rambled. Draco arranged them on another plate.
The next day brought the students back. Harry spent the day nursing a hangover and hiding in his classroom “organizing” for the start of term.
Hermione put her hands together in a praying gesture and bowed her head for a moment. Harry watched the wide circle of her afro sway as she took several deep breaths.
Some twenty minutes later, Filius and Pomona had drifted away from the breakfast table. Minerva set down her teacup and stared evenly at her youngest professor.
“Uh, yeah,” Harry said. “Ok, so it’s a riddle kind of, from this guy in the court of the Delhi sultanate. Amir Khusrow?”
Then there was a giggle from somewhere up the stairs and they sprung apart, Harry’s hands locking themselves behind his back.
§145 of the Legal Reform Act of 2004 did not abolish underage marriage contracts bound by blood dating before 1990. This means that until the contract is voided, it remains binding.
Andy snorted. “Knowing them, no. They’ve probably set fire to the cracker or Harry fell off the bench or Draco suddenly lost all powers of speech and can only blink in Morse code or something.” She considered her whiskey and shook her head.
Neville chuckled. “I still get nightmares about his sad little smile at my attempts in charms. Wingardium fuck me.”
He wasn’t sure that he’d get a DJ at the Winter Ball after this, but, c’est la vie. Malfoy started it. And then he was dismissive about Harry’s dancing ability. Which he had, fuck you Malfoy, finely honed in Muggle clubs over the last five years. When Malfoy was off with the Japanese monks or whatever.
“Andre, please. Tell him it’s ok. Tell him his parents miss him. Please. God. I’ll get Ron or Ginny or someone to write him.”
“Look,” she said with a sigh, “Just give him a chance. A little one. You sat next to him today at dinner and nothing exploded.” She smirked. “You did have to drink about a liter of butterbeer, but—”
“Charming, darling, bet the boys love it when you do that,” Sirius said and winked. He could be a little shit, too.
“What?!” Draco said with a gasp. “Potter, you’re suggesting pornographic music to me?! Is that the soundtrack to a naughty Muggle film?!”
He’d promised Draco a trip to Edinburgh for stickies, novels, and—Harry had to mentally take a deep breath at this part—the props for the sex ed panel. Minnie and the rest of the profs had approved of it immediately. And then it was on the calendar. And then it was next Friday afternoon. Like, tomorrow.
. Draco Malfoy was written below in block capitals. It was about five hundred pages and weighed almost a stone. Harry flipped it open, saw the miniscule font and a table with numbers in it, and shut it immediately.
“This is wonderful!” She was afraid to move out of the yarn snarl, so she stood still and held her arms out. He looked at her.
Harry rolled his eyes at the door, finished his ablutions (he didn’t look that splotchy, and he didn’t run into Malfoy on the way back to the living room, so no one was the wiser), tucked himself into the sofa, and had the best sleep he’d had in months.
“No, no, Potter, not like that! It’s just hard to explain that you used to be a wizard fascist because the divisions don’t exactly map onto muggle issues like racism or homophobia, so it all comes out kind of wrong when you’re trying to explain why you hated certain groups, and besides, I’m terrible at lying. And you’re not supposed to lie in therapy!” He held up his hands in supplication. “It’s not some leftover anti-muggle bias. Swear to Salazar.”
The kids wouldn’t be arriving until later, so he left his professorial robe hanging by the door and went down to breakfast in a flannel and jeans.
The poor plumber, who’d been hired off craigslist, had no idea who Harry was. Florian had tried to explain that Harry was like, famous, and not good at flirting. And then he’d ended up fucking the plumber, because
Hermione waited. She didn’t totally have time to just wait around but like, few things were more important than an impromptu visit from her best friend (well, other than Ron, she always had to clarify, but Ron was also her fiancé, which always seemed like it came with the assumption that you had to love that person as a friend and a lover like if you were going to marry them one day and oh fuck, she hadn’t written Molly back about those napkins).
Pansy didn’t understand the details of the latest magicotechnical discoveries, but what Draco was saying was true. Or at least as true as the reports she’d read in the
In the same modulated tone, he continued: “I was a shitty kid, I know that. I honestly thought I was better than everyone else. I teased people mercilessly. Neville, the Creevey boys, Ron, Hermione. I believed it then, that the Malfoys and purebloods were superior. But then my father started weaponizing his approval and I knew it was wrong. I knew those views were not only incoherent but also evil, but I couldn’t stop. If I would just do one more thing for the Dark Lord, if I could just—
Harry snorted. “He’s not as much of a dick as he was.” They glanced down at their water, then started picking at a cuticle. Val fought the urge to slap their hands. “He’s less prickly. More, er, curious.”
Tonight was shaping up to be a good evening, Val thought, surveying the dance floor. It was only eleven and it was already full. There would be the drag interlude at midnight, then the new DJ was going to start playing. It was all coming together.
“I don’t know if I’ve ever passed, not really,” Draco said eventually, his tone serious. “Maybe for a bit at school, but since then, it just seems stupid to cut bits off yourself to fit into a box that you don’t even like. I mean, here,” he gestured around at the classroom, “it’s all professional, of course, but I’m quite sure my students intuit my preferences.”
“It was a private conversation between friends,” Draco said. “I fail to see why I should tell you anything.”
“But your cake.” Jason cut off another bite and studied it. “I’d ask for the recipe, but I can’t bake for shit.”
“He was a right fucking nutter,” Pomona said with vindictive glee. “Minnie and I spent years trying to get him fired, but Albus wouldn’t hear of it.”
Andromeda hadn’t missed any of that and her warm brown eyes were boring into the back of her nephew’s head. She caught Neville’s eye and he realized that neither of them had any fucking idea what to do.
“Astoria,” Hermione said, shoving the papers at Draco and taking Astoria’s other hand. “I’m so, so, so sorry.” Her eyes were bright with tears.
“I’m meant to go see Ron and Hermione this month, anyway, so we could just, like, combine those trips, I mean, if you wouldn’t mind staying on their couch or something—”
“Ugh, he’s doing such good work at the Ministry, like, more power to him. Maybe you should get him to come do a talk here.”
“I mean, if anything, I think he’s my fourth cousin once removed or something, so I supposed by some kind of blood purist point of view, I should feel compelled to help him, but—” Luna paused and closed her eyes.
Andy turned away from the still flaming pot, and Sirius, taking his chance, extinguished it with a quick
Malfoy was scarlet and had his eyes fixed on a point far, far away. Harry ran one finger from his lips down his own torso, never taking his eyes off Malfoy.
Harry looked really confused. “Here.” He thrust a wrapped cord and a charger at Draco. “So you can charge it.”
Tightening his fingers around the snitch, Harry urged his broom downwards. Malfoy was almost jerked off his broom, but he clung to Harry with one hand and his broom with the other.
He was awakened by Draco, shaking his shoulder gently and saying, “Harry, Harry, wake up.” He blinked and groaned. His neck was totally fucked from this tiny couch.
“How do you know he’s changed? He’s good at lying. He probably doesn’t even know that much about the History of Magic anyway, outside of all the pureblood lies his father told him when he was little. I doubt he even paid any attention during Binns’ lessons anyway—”
“Anyway, you might be right,” Draco interrupted. He started ticking numbers off on his right hand as he continued, “One, what are Audrey and Talbott Oliver-Winger, respectively Defense against the Dark Arts professor and Head Auror doing with a cursed sex pendant at their home? Two, who knew about this? Three, who was talented enough to break into what is, I assume, a very warded house? Four, why were Ron and Blaise called up here to deal with what should be a routine B&E, if not for the nature of the object in question?” He paused for a moment and then said, “Something’s not quite adding up here. Perhaps you’re onto something, Potter.”
Marcus looked like he was going to ask more, but then Posie started making a choking noise and he was distracted.
Eight years ago, he’d started his final year as a student—the first year he’d had at Hogwarts where no one was actively trying to kill him. Then he’d muddled about as an Auror for a year before realizing that he’d loved Dumbledore’s Army because of the teaching, not the fighting. Harry started with muggle primary schools, then went to wizarding uni for education. Now he was two masters’ degrees and years of student teaching stronger. And he was ready to take on Hogwarts.
“Yes, well, anyway, Hermione learned a lot from Binns and I doubt Malfoy will be able to teach one-fifth as well as he could.”
Draco shrugged. “My father will be in Azkaban until he dies. I don’t know where my mother is. France, maybe.” He finished his scone. “Andromeda’s alright.”
“I think that’s what gets me most,” he said, staring out the window. “None of it was even kind of true. But we just didn’t—we didn’t go anywhere else. Didn’t meet anyone who wasn’t already—”
Harry nodded. “Or stuff like, I was talking about how Dumbledore was gay and maybe that was why we vibed—”
Draco hummed and tested his bond. “Really, Potter, you ought to ask first. My safeword is peppermint.”
Then, remembering once again she was a witch, Luna raised her wand to her eyebrow and Neville blurted, “Don’t!”
Cho sniggered into her bread. She considered them, and shook her head. “You’re doing good, Ol. Both of you. She’s lucky.”
“Ooh, wow, aren’t you a bright wizard,” Harry said mockingly, and accioed a piece of paper. “Look, now I’ve got paper.”
He was settling in fine, Andromeda thought. As fine as anyone who was clearly traumatized from being incarcerated in a maximum security magical prison from age seventeen to twenty-five, could be, anyway.
Malfoy looked taken aback. “Potter, if you think I could concentrate while sitting in the Great Hall, next to you, no less—” he broke off and looked down at his cup of tea. “I need silence. Absolute silence. And about five hundred books. And a fresh cup of Earl Grey. I couldn’t even consider starting an article in these circumstances.” He waved his hands around a bit.
“Er, you asked me if I’d gotten like, bonded to Blaise accidentally? And every time we kiss, you seem kind of weirded out. And then you stared at those lesbians in Costa for a really long time.”
Client nodded after each of the steps stated in section V, but did not make any expression of emotion or further statement. He nodded goodbye when he and OP prepared to Disapparate to the Tonks residence.
At ten feet away from the cottage, she was thrown back suddenly. The ghostly outlines of ward runes floated in the air for a moment.
“That’s what I told Draco,” Astoria said, “that it was a really thoughtful and special gift that clearly means a lot.”
Please respond at the earliest possible date with several dates and times that you, Mr. Malfoy, and your solicitor would be able to meet.
Harry didn’t know anything about medieval popes or whatever journal Malfoy had just name-dropped. Muggle Studies was a fairly modern discipline and not even his—wait—
Just wanted to check in with you about what Module 3 in the Respecting the Non-Magical World Curriculum is. I just had one of my monthly check ins with Draco and he just kept mumbling about “module 3” and he “didn’t know.” He seems disturbed by something that might have happened in class, or perhaps the content of the module?
A silvery Borzoi clipped into the room, a brown puppy dangling by the scruff of its neck. It plopped the whining puppy into a dog basket and curled up around the little one.
“I know,” his wife groaned, dropping the pieces into a silver casket on the mantle. “I just hope she starts growing out of it soon.” The lid snapped shut with a booming sound out of place for such a small object.
“Excuse me?! Have you forgotten the infamous ‘you don’t have to call me sir, professor’ incident of double potions, ninety-one?”
“They have trouble adjusting sometimes,” Talbott said, “since they’re not really sure of their bodies in either form. Sometimes Audrey sleeps with Viv like that. It helps her settle.”
He caught Neville’s eyes on his abs, and, gratified by the way his gaze had glazed over, smiled broadly.
“Do you want a baby?” Draco blurted. This seemed directly at Neville, not her, so Pomona just basked in the awkwardness as her favorite former student turned crimson and sweat began beading on his brow.
Fleur rolled her eyes. “Yeah, like he’s really going to be scared of a professor of ancient runes in a battered leather jacket.”
“Don’t forget to click your heels after the feast, Helga, and it’ll take you right home,” he said with a smile and a subtle flick of his wand that would transport her back to the Slytherin dorms when she tapped her ruby slippers together. Helga’s parents had tried to get her out of Muggle Studies before the term began, but her effusive letters—and Harry’s weekly packets of her Outstanding class assignments—had apparently done their work to decrease their blood purist bigotry, at least a little.
Harry found himself back at the prawn bowl. It wasn’t even a bit lower. That was a challenge. And there was a new kind of sauce.
Magnifying her voice, she boomed across the hall, “All students to their common rooms now. Anyone found in the corridors after the next ten minutes will lose their house one hundred points.” Noises of shock and horror—and a few shrieks from canary victims—broke out across all four tables at this draconian threat. One hundred points. Harry hadn’t lost points on that scale since Snape’s reign of terror in the potions classroom.
Britney swanned up, her blonde hair rolled into crunchy curls. She kept darting glances at Elspeth, who was clinging to her arm and looked terrified at the punchy beat of T.I.’s ‘Bring Em Out’ booming through the space. Elspeth was wearing some kind of robes-with-mandarin-collar outfit embroidered with phoenixes that Harry could only assume was the Traditional Formal Pureblood Wizarding Attire in Hong Kong. Malfoy would know. Irritation surged through him.
Ginny and Luna found each other. And Harry came out as bi. He’d started WAWFAN then, bolstered by Hermione’s frantic poster- and button-making, and even if the first meeting was just him, Dean, Seamus, Ginny, Luna, Neville, and Hermione, he was grateful. (Ron had thought it was the following Tuesday. He’d been left to his own devices and had fallen asleep down in the Quidditch shed. Ron slept a lot. The scars from the Ministry still drained his energy.) It picked up speed several months later, with a young Slytherin came up to Harry after the meeting in tears because he didn’t think he belonged in the girls’ dorms—he was a boy. A sixth bed appeared in the Slytherin boy’s dorm that night, and each house was expanded by a set of gender-inclusive dorms. As the atmosphere in the castle became more and more welcoming, non-binary students filled those dorms too. Harry kissed his first boy, a kind sixth-year Ravenclaw named Stephen, and had a few good afternoons figuring things out before Stephen told him he wasn’t ready for a serious boyfriend, let alone dating the most famous guy in the British wizarding world; Harry was flattered and mortified.  There was too much firewhiskey, too many games of Exploding Snap in the back of Binns’ class, too many Canary Creams slipped into beakers of hot chocolate.
“So,” Sirius said, rubbing his chin. Remus liked the stubble, but it was a bit long for him now. But his public. Well, fuck the public. He was lazy. That was the real problem. Right, to the theme. “So Lucius—”
Harry barked out a laugh. “Anyway, my identification is a bit of a theoretical issue at this point, since I’m not seeing anyone…” Well, that wasn’t at all relevant to the issue at hand, which was protecting the kids from Malfoy and his pernicious influence. He could be a gay racist. Or a gay wizard fascist. Apparently, he had been a gay wizard fascist as a teen. Still trying to wrap his head around that one, Harry snorted.
“He invited himself to be a part of WAWFAN, but we had this really intense discussion and he’s been avoiding me ever since. I fail to see how that is still,” he held up his fingers in air-quotes, “‘sparring with my teenage nemesis.’”
“Yes, Potter, exactly. I came across one of the fifth-years demonstrating a rather—” he inhaled—“rude dance for a group of her peers and she said you’d demonstrated this dance in class!”
Dean shook his head, which sent his short dreads out in a fan. “Didn’t know, mate. Didn’t know until he got well pissed one night and I’d brought him back to our flat—we were roommates, remember—and then instead of going to bed, he grabbed me and insisted that he needed a cuddle, so I was like, well, alright, whatever, and then when we woke up in the morning—” he broke off and stared at Seamus, who’d just lit a trayful of shots on fire—“it was like we’d always been together. Kissing him just felt … right.” Dean tipped his head back and took a long pull from his beer. “Like all the pieces of the universe had just slotted together.”
Then Draco did something strange. His long, pale fingers flew over the jumble of digestives and jaffa cakes and rich teas, and then they were all sorted by type, overlapping in a circle around the plate, presided over by a small pyramid of the custard creams.
“The bathroom you’ll have to use is the one down the hall, but since my bedroom is on the ground floor, we won’t have to fight over it. And now I need a cup of tea.”
“I must have, uh,” Harry leaned against the bathroom door frame, “gotten distracted in the bath.” Was that insinuating enough? It was rather drafty standing like this. Should he put one arm up the frame? Maybe that was too much like a lothario.
“Come here,” she said, sitting up. The bed moved with her. Draco tried to fluff the pillow, but only succeeded in making it more uncomfortable. “Sit.”
Draco burst into an explanation about the joys of healthy self-discovery and how they had, in Harry’s class, reviewed the various items potentially useful for sexual encounters, but now they were going to hear from a diverse panel of alumni. Five minute intros, and then the floor would be open for questions.
The problem with this realization is that it requires the presence of two other people, i.e., the person your client loves and the person my ward loves. I'm not sure if there’s someone he loves. There is the distinct possibility that we can attempt to undo the enchantment without my ward having another lover (?! true love? The language is shaky here) but I have to do some outreach.
“I think Harry might be a nontaster,” Astoria said lightly. “But I haven’t wanted to bring it up to them, because, free alcohol. Gift horses and so on.”
“Hey,” Harry said, magically lashing Draco’s wand arm to the armchair with silken black ropes. Harry hadn’t meant for the bindings to look that sensual. That’s just how it had come out. It didn’t indicate anything.
“You threw the competition,” Remus argued, “through your unlawful use of extraneous magic that was designed to push events in a certain direction, so I think you’ll find that actually, you owe me the ice cream and the five Galleons.”
My client has informed me that she no longer wishes to be bound by this contract. I am operating under the assumption that your ward, who I believe was recently released from Azkaban and has made no efforts to contact my client, also does not wish to be bound by this contract.
“Fuck right off,” Harry told Malfoy. He was tired now. “I’m an Occlumens, and you don’t know shit about my thoughts.”
“Moony, I’m going to die, you have to apply the kiss of life,” Sirius moaned weakly. “Quickly, or you’ll be a widower.”
She wasn’t sure Bill should just take that tone without knowing anything about what was happening, but it seemed to put Harry at ease as they settled back into the couch.
She’d tried to break him of the habit of using her title, but it just rolled off his gigantic shoulders with a gentle shrug.
Fuck, he was going to have to go buy condoms and dental dams in Edinburgh as demonstration objects. God, probably on the same trip that Malfoy had talked him into. Maybe they could just grab some stuff at Boots quickly and GTFO.
“As I was saying,” he began again, “These children need someone who has extensive experience with LGTBQIA issues specifically within the wizarding world, and while I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to support them as an ally, I have spent the last several years—”
“I’m actually staying here, Potter.” He looked down at the list of students’ names. “The Manor was confiscated as part of our reparations.” A pause. “I haven’t been there in years. I think it’s a sanatorium now, or something.”
“She looked like a milkmaid. And then there was the black lipstick phase. I mean, you’ve seen it. She’s still obsessed with strange colors of lipstick. Green, orange, mauve.” Andre’s voice was fond. “But honestly, I don’t think Talbott would have noticed if she wore a paper bag.”
“Oh, not Winger specifically,” Draco said, “But I’ve been cursed before. I have a few more counterhexes in my arsenal than I did last time. I’m not scared.”
“Harry, my dear, it’s a kind of sex amulet. It seeks out, shall we say, unresolved sexual tension? And then it makes you irresistibly horny until you’ve, you know, done the deed to completion several times. The problem is that the Romans didn’t really understand the concept of consent in the same way we do so,” Audrey shuddered and continued, “I picked this one up from a black market dealer in Romania when we went out to visit Charlie at Christmas, but I haven’t had a spare minute to put the final set of enchantments on it in order to neutralize its power, and then it just disappeared!”
“If Professor Malfoy would care to help out a colleague, I’d appreciate it,” he said with a smile. He could have pointy teeth too.
“Ok,” Neville said. Fucking jump into the breach, though, now, because Blaise had asked him, but also because Draco wasn’t a complete shit and he needed to know if this was going to be the end of their semi-comfortable working relationship. “Because sometimes it seems like you don’t, uh, totally get it?”
Andre laughed. “You could always be my plus one.” Harry raised his eyebrows. “Oh, god, no, no, no, I’m way too old for you. Friends. Plus-one-friend. All I need is a drinking buddy and I already know you’re decent on the dancefloor.”
She narrowed her eyes at him, pushing out against the edges of her consciousness, but all she sensed was nervousness. No flickers of hate or disgust. Just … nerves. And confusion.
Sentimentality before breakfast. Who would have thought. Harry shrugged his shoulders, smiling at the vision outside his window, and ambled across the room and looked at himself in the mirror.
Draco swallows. The heat has burnt his shoulders, the spaces where skin peeked out from under his shirt. Harry wants to run his fingers against the red. “I wouldn’t,” he agrees. “But maybe I’d come back for you.”
,” he drawls, and it’s supposed to be mocking, Harry thinks, except the word is said just a bit too slowly, the syllables drawn out between Draco’s lips like taffy. It’s the low roll at the back of his throat, the tilt of his mouth and Harry tries to hide a flush and stares down at his tray furiously.
Harry almost asks, then stops himself. Everything seemed oddly fragile, sheets of too-thin ice spread out over water. He wonders what it would feel like to step forward, put his foot out and fall.
“What did you wish for?” Harry breathes, barely audible over the echos. He reaches out, finger hovering just above Draco’s coin. The stars wink back at him, a visceral reminder of his own prayers whispered into the dead of the night.
The sound of water cutting off is jolting enough to make Harry jolt. There’s the sound of footsteps, impossibly loud against hard tiles. He looks up just in time to see Draco, hair wet from the shower, kickboard and fins in hand.
The hum of the engine. The tap of fingernails. Music from Draco’s headphones - tinny and faint; he must have taken them out at some point during the drive, let them fall to the seat in a tangle of white cords. Harry reaches for them, fingers aching to move, to do
“I’m doing laundry,” Harry says. He plucks at Draco’s hoodie with one hand; Draco scowls petulantly. “We haven’t done it for at least a week.”
On any other day Draco’s pretty sure he would have collapsed but right now he’s too high on adrenaline and panic to register anything. He keeps pushing, keeps shoving, anything to get to the center of the crowd, to where Harry was kneeling, Draco’s wand in Harry’s hand and blood all over the stones. He can feel it, a strange tug right under his rib cage, his magic calling out to him like a siren song.
Slowly, so damn slowly Draco feels Harry start to relax, the trembling easing ever so slightly. He grips harder, letting the touch of his hands be an anchor, pulling Harry in from the rolling storm outside.
“Draco,” Harry says again. His voice is dry from sleeping and it rasps against his throat. “You said you’d wake me.”
The old lady smiles. She’s missing a tooth, her hands cracked and flaking. She holds her hand out for the trinket, wraps it in paper and ties it off with twine. “A lucky charm, young man. They say you can make wishes on coins with holes.”
Draco let’s Harry shower first - he’s taken his collection down from the car, tumbled spools of thread onto the bed sheets. Harry leaves him there and heads into the bathroom - everything seems oddly yellowed and he scowls at himself in the mirror. He looks different somehow, though he can’t quite figure out what it is.
He touches the wall just after Draco - it would have been more had Harry not absolutely sprinted the finish. It’s not enough though; Draco pulls himself to the edge, ankles submerged in the water, forearms braced on his knees. The light slides off his damp skin, droplets of liquid Mercury and silver on his shoulders. He hadn’t taken off his necklace Harry realizes - it gleams darkly in the hollow of his throat. “Sprints my ass,” Draco says, the laughter audible in the timber of his voice. “You just lost a 25 Free.”
He takes the bottle back from Draco’s limp fingers. He thinks he’ll always associate Sprite with this road trip, the flat taste of sugar and lemon, the fizz on his tongue. It bubbles on the way down, burning his throat.
“You’re in a hoodie,” Harry points out. Draco had rolled the sleeves up to just below his elbows, the blue tracery of his veins visible through the pale skin. “Take it off.”
“It’s been two weeks,” Draco says. Harry turns to look at him; Draco has his head nearly tipped back, the vulnerable curve of his neck exposed to the sky. “Two weeks since we left.”
“How could I?” Harry says, and it’s all sunrises and music and the light in Draco’s eyes. “You’re here with me, aren’t you?”
. Draco grabs his wrist before he can touch them. “It’s not that simple. You think I...that I don’t want…”
One day Harry would be dead, his body blown to dust. The world would turn, the stars dying, the sky falling and the only thing that would be remembered of him was the memories passed down by the people he’d loved.
Harry thinks he would light the ocean on fire for that smile. He’d go to the ends of the earth, burn the world to the ground if Draco asked him to.
Draco gets to his feet, smiling wickedly. He crosses over to the stove, picking up the jar of salt. “Delicious?”
When they finally pull away for air Harry feels dizzy. Draco stares back up at him - his cheeks are flushed, lips red and kiss-swollen. “God,” he says, voice broken. “I didn’t…”
“Oh you’re here now Parkinson?” Hermione’s face is twisted with anger. “Trying to sell out Harry some more? There’s still some Death Eaters nearby - maybe you can hand him off to them.”
Draco’s twisted over in his seat, his back against the car door and legs pulled up sideways. Harry mirrors him so they’re facing each other. He’s so, so careful not to let their legs touch.
The phone clicked off. Harry stared down at his screen before swearing and shoving it into his pocket. He wrenched the door open - the morning air was cool against his face, everything tinged with silver and blue. Draco’s house was huge and ancient, all dark wood and stone. It was built like a traditional manor, angled roofs, thick windows, heavy glass. He’d never liked the house - it always seemed haunted, a mausoleum of memories.
He forces himself to get into bed. It’s warm - Draco must have just rolled over. There’s only two pillows - they usually slept with pillows stacked in the middle, leftover habits from swim meets. Draco’s already using one though; Harry grits his teeth and flips over on his side, rolls right to the very edge and puts as much space between their bodies as possible.
“Fuck,” he says; Harry’s eyes are still distant, lost in that soft world of shock. “Harry. Harry, it’s me.”
“You’re right,” Draco says. He switches lanes; Harry’s body presses against the door, the handle digging into his ribcage. The sun hangs just above them, baking the roof of the car and them inside of it. “I don’t - I don’t know what I want.”
Draco pushes himself off the hood - the back of his jacket is covered in dust from the windscreen, smeared over the dark fabric. “I think I want gum after all,” he hums.
With a sigh, Draco stares down at his arm, the ugly brand that couldn’t cover the scars on his wrist. He couldn’t even remember what the fight was about - something small, he was sure, something inconsequential and pathetic. Stress had blown it up, turned it into something so much bigger then it should have been, made him keep pushing, keep arguing until him and Harry were both screaming at each other from opposite sides of the kitchen table.
The metal of the car under his thighs. The whisper of Draco’s breath against his neck. The sun, yet another day slipping through Harry’s fingers, another day that he’d never get back. Another day that he’d look back on later, with all the bitterness of longing, wish with all his heart that he could turn back time.
, Draco wrote back. Harry stared at the words for a moment, everything that it symbolized, everything he couldn’t have.
Draco had now stretched himself out on the counter, legs dangling idly over the edge. His arm was out and bare next to him, the Dark Mark covered up by beautiful flowers, rendered in soft purples and blues and greens. It was a Muggle tattoo for the most part, with the exception of one single hydrangea - in ever shifting colours of pale pinks and soft teals. Draco had designed it himself - they still had the parchment sketched on the wall in the bedroom.
He doesn’t know how long it’s been - an hour, a day, a year - but slowly Harry’s breath becomes easier, his breaths clearing until finally Draco loosened his grip and Harry opened his eyes.
Sirius shakes his head. Draco stares at his forearms, the silver moon tattoos inked onto the skin. They seemed to shimmer, even in the dark room, the edges rippling and fading into the next shape. “He told me all about you, actually. How brave you were. How you’re only 17 and yet you’re spying for a side that will try and execute you if they win this battle.”
He’s always been scared of drowning. It was ironic, being a swimmer and all, but all of Harry’s nightmares featured him underwater, the slam of his heart against his chest, the way the world narrowed down to the slowly-dying throb in his veins.
The barest twitch of Draco’s lips. The way his breathing hitched when Harry closed his fingers around the coin, pressed it so hard into his palm that he thought it might be branded there forever.
“Oh screw the motel,” Draco says. The sun is just barely starting to touch the horizon, the clouds taking on the barest hint of gold. “We’ll sleep in the car. Like at Nationals, remember?”
“I was thinking,” he says, his voice too-casual, too smooth. “There’s two types of people, right? People who fight like hell to get something and people who fight like hell to keep it.”
Draco shrugs. His hands flutter in the air, a twisting pattern traced in dust. “Not like these ones.”
Harry turns away, fixes his eyes on the road. Breathes in and out, in and out. Shoves the small spark in his chest deep inside of him, mouth
Harry didn’t have to ask what Draco was asking. They knew each other - whispered words, hidden voices, sometimes so in sync that it hurt. “Yes,” he said. “I’ll stay.”
Harry rolls his eyes. A couple months ago they had missed the ferry ride home after Nationals had ended - an unlucky combination of finals ending at 10, a horrible mixture of ice and wind and ferries being canceled due to the weather. They couldn’t find a hotel to book - everything was taken by desperate, stranded travellers. They’d slept in the car instead - in their sleeping bags, the car reeking of chlorine.
Harry closes his eyes. It’s all burned into the backs of his eyelids anyways, spiralling colours, spinning lights. He knows he should probably get up, move back into the car - falling asleep upright was going to be hell on his neck. He can’t bring himself to move though. Everything’s so warm, the comforting press of Draco beside him, the sound of insects and birds lulling him to sleep.
“Draco,” he says and God his voice was hoarse, like bits of metal grating against stone, like he had been screaming for hours without end. “Fuck. Draco.” He breaks off at the end, burying his face against Draco’s neck; Draco feels his lips moving against skin and shivers.
“Figure it out,” Harry says; Draco cuts a harsh gaze back onto the road. “Stop dragging everything on. Make up your damn mind and stick to it.”
A wad of grey fabric hits him in the face. Harry shakes it out gingerly - it’s a hoodie from Nationals last year,
of the car settling around them. The hiss of exhaled breaths. Harry closes his eyes and thinks of silence before the gunshot, before the air exploded into motion and the water rushed up to meet him.
Silence. Dry air and the blazing sun. Heat wraps scalding fingers around Harry’s anger, burns it all to dust. A pit of something oily settles in his stomach.
“Nice pyjamas,” he says sarcastically. Harry scowls - he’s cold, his bare chest itching underneath Draco’s steady eyes.
Harry thinks. The light’s almost gone - he can only make out the faintest suggestions of Draco - the hint of his jaw, the thin lines of his lashes. It’s only the burning press of his body that reminds Harry that he was real.
, Harry thinks. He stops the words before they come out - he knows he’d sound too hoarse, too unhinged. Draco’s eyes darken.
Blaise shakes his head. The usual easy expression he wore was gone, replaced with stone-cold anger. “You’re on thin fucking ice Granger.”
“I hate you,” he gets out through gritted teeth. Draco splashes him - he yelps and jumps backwards. “You dick!”
“Fuck that,” Harry said tightly. He stared at Draco; harsh lines, faded colors, a wilted petal beaten down by the rain. “What - “
Harry takes a deep breath. He yanks his own shirt off too, drops it next to Draco’s. The water is freezing - he makes it up to his knees before he starts swearing. Draco steps on his foot by accident - his toes sink into the swirl of soft sand, his legs going numb.
The road stretches in front of him. The car swerves slightly - Draco curses, though he’s laughing too. “Jesus. You’ll crash.”
“Thank god,” Draco mutters; he’s off the hood in an instant, heading over to the open window. “Yes please! Our car broke down and - “
They drove past the pool - he was almost tempted to pull into the parking lot, just for the nostalgia factor. Draco had his nose pressed almost against the glass, fog spreading across the window. He looked quiet, somehow, curled in on himself. Harry frowned, ignored the twist in his stomach, the bitter taste of guilt. “Did your parents try and stop you?”
He can’t stop himself from smiling though, when he gets back into the car after using the washroom and spots the red filter strung up in the back and hanging on fishing line.
He wasn’t expecting Draco to pick up, so the click of the phone connecting was a surprise. “Hey,” he said, into the dark screen of his phone. His own face stared back at him, eyes distorted and stretched out. “I’m outside.”
Harry shakes his head and then he’s kissing Draco, hard and bloody, the taste of salt and metal in his mouth. They’re both shaking, the knowledge that
“Hand me the detergent?” Draco says, and he snatches the plastic bag from Harry’s hand. It’s funny, Harry thinks - Draco’s always had such a distinct scent to him. It was gone now, ever since they started this road trip, ever since Harry’s clothes and Draco’s smelled exactly the same.
Harry swallows, hard. Shit, he thinks. Draco’s eyes are full of challenge, that streak of competitiveness that made him fall in love in the first place.
“Am not,” Harry scowls. He finds the milk in the fridge, adding copious amounts to his coffee. “Where’s the spoons?”
Panic is a cold, sick spread in his stomach. Harry takes a deep breath and tries to remember how to breathe. He watches the lights smear together in the rain. “Why?”
Harry doesn’t argue. He switches places with Draco. The seat is still warm when he settles down, the ghostly imprint of Draco’s body.
Draco moves then. His hand comes up, closes around Harry’s wrist. “Don’t,” he warns, too softly, his voice steady despite the tremble in his hands. His fingers dig into Harry’s skin, awful and uneven. “Please.”
The minute Draco says “Go,” Harry dives. The pool is shallow enough that he nearly scrapes his nose on the floor, the bottom rushing up at him in a flurry of bubbles and white concrete. The water seems to slip from his hands - two weeks without training made his shoulders and lungs burn. He can feel Draco beside him - the lack of a lane rope meant that they were so much closer than normal, close enough that his hand brushed Draco’s ribs when he took a stroke. Everything’s blurry - neither of them have goggles, nothing beyond vague and foggy shapes but Harry can still make out Draco’s hair, a golden cloud around them.
“We could have just cleaned it by hand,” Harry grumbles, but he gets into the car anyway, pulls up to the tiny kiosk and punches in numbers. There’s no line - they move into the nearest bay. The green light blinks maddening at them; on and off, a warning symbol to wind up the windows and lock the doors.
Harry swallows. The lights glimmer back at him, turning the water of the pool a bottle green. He drags his fingers across the surface.
He can visibly see Draco swallow, the soft flex of his throat, the way he raked fingers through his hair and turned away. “Wear it. You can give it back later.”
Draco stops. Spits into the sink, rinses his mouth with water. “You’re still wearing my hoodie,” he says, and Harry wonders if he’d imagined the slight waver in Draco’s voice.
Harry digs his phone out of his pocket - the screen is slippery with sweat and he has to shield it with one hand just to make out the numbers. He’s on 14 percent he realizes as he slides it back into his pocket. “No.”
Draco nods. He thinks about Harry - his smiles, his eyes, the way his hair felt when Draco let his hands brush through. The harsh set of his mouth when he was concentrating, the way he laughs, all quicksilver and molten metal, the way Draco’s heart stopped every time they touched. He thinks about how he dropped everything - his family, his title, his home, how he was willing to die just to give Harry a chance and he wonders if he’ll ever have anything like this again.
“You idiot,” Harry says. Draco just laughs, wild and giddy. His hair is clumped together, sticking up in spikes all around his face. Harry wants to run his fingers through it.
Sirius studies him for a minute, then lets out a low whistle. “God, you are practically a carbon copy of me.”
“Took you long enough,” Draco replies drily. Harry watches as he knocks back the dregs of his iced tea, replaces it back in the cup holder.
“This. Us. The road trip.” Draco makes a vague motion, somehow encompassing everything and nothing at once. “You know. Shitty motels and shitty food. Waking up at six and diving for hours. The sunrises.”
Neon lights. Cars. The sound of footsteps in the room beside them; the walls are thin enough to hear every heavy step that the person next door to them made. Cutting through it all is the sound of steady breathing, the barest twitch of the covers.
“Fuck your mum,” Harry responds. The sun moves then, out from behind the clouds. It filters everything through shades of dazzling white - everything’s still wet from the rain and the water droplets glow like diamonds.
“Can we please drive?” Draco breathed. It’s only the cracks in his throat that jolted Harry out of his mist of fog and fury. He cut the headlights on, peeled away from Draco’s driveway, didn't miss the way Draco’s shoulders visibly relaxed with every second that passed.
It feels like a thunderstorm. Everything’s too charged - one look and Harry would be struck down. He tears his eyes away from Draco’s steady gaze.
He inwardly groans, turning back to face Draco, who had a shit-eating grin on his face. “No. I meant to do that.”
“Here,” he murmurs. His hand is a graceful curve, pressed against the cold glass of the windscreen. “That cluster of four - the uneven square? And the tail that rises and falls - “
Harry closes his eyes. Takes in shaking breaths, one after another. Everything is spinning too fast, the world falling to pieces around him, the stars glittering rain against his skin.
He gets out of bed slowly, wincing at the bright lights. There’s a mess of clothing dumped on one of the chairs; he grabs something at random (Draco’s - only he would bother to buy a sweater this nice) and pulls it on, padding into the kitchen.
“How do I know this is real?” Harry whispers. He gestures, at the room, the ceiling, the shattered windows and cracked floor. “How do I know any of this is real, that it isn’t
Lucius didn't bother to acknowledge him. He turned away, a quick motion of his hand; with a jolt Harry realized he was gesturing to Draco, taking him away. “We’re leaving.”
The man laughs. “No. I wasn’t going to say that. I get the sense that you aren’t fond of your father though. He was an asshole. A brilliant, conniving asshole but an asshole all the same.”
“I’ll make you a ring,” Draco says, and Harry can hear the grin threaded through his voice. “Oh Harry. Will you be my radiant bride?”
Harry stares at the small label on the wall, though he doesn’t actually see any of the letters. He’s too busy focusing on Draco, a pillar of fire standing behind him, all flames and ichor. “Morbid.”
“My parents.” His voice is tight. Harry stares at the turn of Draco’s neck and imagines the delicate outline of a rope. “They want me to stop swimming.”
“This is such a bad idea,” he mutters under his breath. Draco just laughs, dumps his towel onto the chaise lounge and slips his legs into the water. The pool is narrow, a deformed rectangle with one side warped and wavy. One of the lights seemed to be broken, the other barely flickering with a yellowish glow. He grimaces. “You’re going to get fucking electrocuted.”
Harry follows him. He feels almost shell shocked, like he was balanced on the deck of a boat, waves looming in the distance and under his feet. Draco tosses him the keys.
Draco waves him off, his chopsticks suspended between his fingers. “We’re similar sizes. It’s fine.”
But they’re too close now; in the dark, the pulsing glow of the lights. Draco’s hand sprayed out on the console, fingers inches away from the curve of Harry’s knee. The light slides off the arc of Draco’s neck, lights his skin up in soft shades of green.
Draco’s hand swims into his vision - Harry realizes he’s holding a bottle of water. He accepts it gratefully - the water’s warm but better than nothing. He swallows down half of it then passes the bottle back; Draco takes it but doesn’t drink. He instead stares at the opening, the small plastic ridges where the cap screwed on.
“Oh God,” Harry says, fondly. He remembers the mad dash from the pool deck to the car, the balmy warmth giving way to the icy expanse of the parking lot. “Don’t remind me.”
He forces Draco to switch after he yawns for the third time, a stifled gasp behind the press of his palms. The sky is dark now, the radiance of the sun replaced with the gentler pinpricks of the stars. When Harry opens the van door the air smells like bush and desert.
the first time. They’d talked multiple times before - on the phone, through texts, at practice. Draco never was one to initiate anything though - it was always Harry, cross-legged on his bed at three in the morning, irrational thoughts and hidden feelings.
Draco bites his lip, hard. Harry’s still shaking on the ground, curled up on himself like someone was kicking him; he swears at the sight. “I know. It doesn’t. And I swear - afterwards you can do whatever you want to me. Throw me in Azkaban, torture me - I don’t give a fuck. But please -
“Don’t talk about my parents,” Draco warns. Plastic cracks under his hands, knuckles bone white and tense. “If you saw what they were like when they fought - “
“Fuck you,” Draco says. His palms are pressed into his eyes, fingers splayed out over his face. “Fuck you and fuck your stupid morning habits.”
Harry holds a hand out, at the swirl of colours inside Draco’s cup. “M&M Mcflurries are shit. It looks like a rainbow threw up in your ice cream.”
Draco swallowed. One hand ghosted up to his side, the faintest brush of fingers digging into his own skin.
“They think it’s unnatural,” he whispers. Harry can almost hear the ghosts of Draco’s parents bleeding through the thin words. “They think we’re…”
Harry shudders. “Oh please no,” he says, dropping the stack of mail onto the coffee table with a groan. “That was one time!
He doesn’t turn to look as Harry moves beside him, shakes his head at the opened bag of granola. The waves are rough, the water a blur of dark green and grey, edged in ivory foam.
Despite everything the night begins to cool. The metal of the car is still warm against Harry’s back, echoes of a day now gone. Draco’s body is a searing warmth next to him, bleeding through the thin cotton of their shirts where Harry’s arm brushed against Draco’s. If he reaches out he’d be able to press his hand against Draco’s rib cage, line his fingers up with the rise and fall of his bones.
They sit like that for a bit. The car inches forward - an endless line of vehicles, stretching out into the distance. Horns blared from somewhere vaguely behind them, another buffer slid between the tension. Harry leans his arm outside the window, presses his palm against the burning heat of the metal, takes a deep breath and thinks the air smells like ash.
“I thought you were such a prick when I first saw you,” Draco says, his voice soft with reminiscence. “You were complaining to Ron about something - the set I think? You were all, ‘I wonder if the new boy can keep up. Doesn’t look like it.’ God I wanted to smack you.”
“Fuck!” Harry swears. He sits up - the hotel room is dark, the only light from the tiny clock on the side table. Draco’s on top of him, legs slotted on either side of Harry. His eyes shine in the darkness, silver stars, matched only by the coin around his neck.
The sun’s almost completely gone, the beach cast in shadow. Harry shivers - the wind’s picked up, the waves pulling more insistently at their numb feet, crashing heavily against the shoreline.
Harry remembers that ride - the dry air of the plane, the rain that froze to ice on the windows. The team had seats right at the back of the aisle, still in team hoodies and wet hair. He remembers Draco watching him, silent and hesitant, eyes luminous in the dying light. “I remember.”
“That is the most horrible description of ice cream that I’ve ever heard,” Harry retorts. Draco hands him the spoon back. His face is lit up, all grins and laughter, the light from the sun partially slanted over his face.
“Fuck,” Draco says, low and hoarse. His fingers are vicious, white-knuckled against his hair. “We’re so backed up.”
The sound of Draco’s steady breaths grounds him. Harry chances a look - he’s got the blankets pulled over and around him. The faintest strip of light falls across his face, a strip of the moon against the curve of Draco’s cheekbone. He watches the flutter of Draco’s hair, the steady pulse at his throat and Harry wants to press his lips against it.
They’ve been friends for years now, ever since Draco appeared at swim practice one day and was promptly yelled at for being five minutes late. Harry’s shared highs and lows with him - morning practices and midnight ferry rides, shaving in the bathroom before a meet, the echo of the pool doors opening at 6am on a Saturday morning. He’s seen Draco laugh after practice in the hot tub, hold back tears after missing the standards by a millisecond, smile after breaking the club record a month after.
When they both finally surface they’re gasping. Harry shoves his hair from his face, winces at the burn in his eyes and scowls at Draco. “I won.”
Draco doesn’t come back until just before the gun gives a shuddering jolt in Harry’s hand, the gas cutting off abruptly. The sun had risen a little more, turning the dust on the car into a thick mat. Harry raises an eyebrow at Draco, who shrugs.
It’s too late. Draco jerks back with a curse - “Fuck!” he yelps, mouth open as he exhaled smoke into the air. “Fuck, it’s hot. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck - “
He takes a breath. The ice creams lie forgotten in the cup holders between them. Draco’s hand goes up to his own neck; he twists the coin almost viciously, leaving a red mark in the soft skin. “Is it something you want?”
His body hurts. His skin feels raw, scrubbed down. His chest and shoulders and neck aches, his eyes burning, his mouth dry and yet all Harry could think about was the skin underneath his fingertips, the way Draco closed his eyes so briefly when his thumb swiped just underneath the curve of his eye.
He forces himself to open his eyes - the world rushes in, white light and flames. He has to look down at his legs, blink the spots from his vision before he finally can look over at Draco.
He thinks he lets his head drop. He thinks he feels Draco’s hands on him, soft against his skin. He thinks he hears Draco whisper something to him, lost within his enveloping dreams.
Harry thinks of Draco slipping things into his pockets - a quarter from the vending machine last night, the cap from the bottle of Sprite. He thinks of Draco threading string through the lid and around the coin, and his something in his heart twists.
The night dwindles to silence, the sun moving from brilliant scarlet to darkness. Harry watches the stars blink into existence - there’s no meteor shower but he still thinks they look beautiful. He finds Draco’s stars almost instantly.
Draco kisses like he’s desperate, like the world was burning, and if Draco was ice he kisses Harry like he was fire. He kisses like he talks, deliberate and careful, too fast for Harry to keep up. It’s the way closes his eyes, lashes against Harry’s cheekbones, the way his hair feels underneath Harry’s fingers, the way Harry slots himself up against the wall, lets the water lap around his body, the cold of the water burnt away by the fire at Draco’s fingertips.
“I don’t want this to stop,” Harry whispers, into the night air, into the soft darkness and the space between their bodies. “I don’t want to go back.”
They drive for another hour or so. Harry watches the shrubs and the rocks go by, sneaks glances over his shoulder as he does. Draco looks luminous in the light, melting from silver to rose-gold. Harry wonders why he’d never noticed before.
The seat is warm when he slides in, when he pulls the lever under the seat and slides closer to the brakes. Draco’s half asleep when Harry finally cuts the lights on.
They line up at the end of the pool together, toes curled over the edge, fingers braced on the floor. Harry hasn’t done a dive in what felt like months - his back creaks as he bends down, arms taught and tense. He doesn’t look at Draco next to him, doesn’t study the curve of his spine and the build of his legs, the bones in his wrist as he shifted slightly, fingers braced on the tiled floor.
The click of the turn signal. The colours of the sky. The hum of the radio, near forgotten in the heat, forlorn notes and drifting voices.
Afterwards they lie on the bed, tangled blankets and folded pillows. The arch of Draco’s foot pressed into Harry’s ankle, the water from his hair soaking through his shirt. Harry lies on his back, Draco’s face turned into his neck, a memory of morning on the roof of the car. He traces his finger down the inside of Draco’s wrist, all the way down to the swell of his knuckles and Draco shivers and moves closer.
Silence. It’s so, so quiet - the rasping of grass blades, rocks tumbling across the road. The creak of the car when Draco pulls himself across it, legs too close to Harry’s. He closes his eyes, tries to ignore the searing presence of Draco’s skin.
“Coming,” Draco replied. Harry frowned - he sounded wide awake, voice too tense to be natural. “One minute.”
There’s the weight of something being draped around him - Draco had found one of their blankets. He wraps it around the two of them, traps the heat from the car in between their two bodies. It pulls them impossibly closer; Harry’s shoulder an unbroken line with Draco’s.
“God, I’m so sorry we’re not on the Floo yet. It’s been like eight months, but they always want to send the installation wizard during the week and we just don’t have time,” she groaned once they were all in the car. Malfoy was scrunched up in the back seat, but he didn’t say anything.
Draco pressed his lips together and shot a glance towards the window. “The wizarding world doesn’t seem to have any kind of mystery literature, probably because there are so many mysteries regarding magic and magical living anyway, but I just thought, well—”
“Ok, well, not that one, then,” Neville said. “Then there’s some stuff related to the studies I started in my diss.”
She and Bill had left for Norway the moment the dust from the war settled. He’d been working on his dissertation on the theory that the fjords were created by prehistoric giant rune-writing when Voldemort had seized power, and they had field work to do. Then Fleur had started her work in Paris and now they were in Cairo, Bill was on sabbatical, and she got to spend most days measuring amulets for the morphological project, and she’d just heard there might be this—
“Oh, yeah,” Jason said and grinned. “I love amphibians. Anything that can survive in multiple environments, just, fascinating.”
Narcissa blinked. She’d forgotten this was Andromeda’s house. How was it that Andromeda could see her son and she couldn’t? Lucius had fucked everything up. Everything.
At first, she thought she was losing her mind. St. Mungo’s sent her to Dr. Grimke. Dr. Grimke had stared into her left eye, pulled her right earlobe, tapped her kneecaps, flicking her wand over Cho’s head and casting a bright network of purple runes. Then she grinned, said “It’s all your mind, but in a real way,” and explained how there were veils between worlds and some people lingered and some people could feel those people, and apparently, Cho was just one of those latter people and Cedric was one of the former.
“Fine,” Harry groaned. “You can come too, and we’ll go to Waterstones so you can get more trash to read.”
“Wait, that’s Percy?” The ginger-haired man in the photograph, arm slung loosely around Oliver’s shoulders, was wearing rimless glasses and a tank. When Harry squinted, he could see how reedy, nerdy Percy had grown up to be a fucking hunk, but still? Percy was hot now?!
“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth is an ungrateful mother,” George said, “You loved the banana bread I made for Mother’s Day.”
“Anyway,” said Malfoy, his eyes back on the bulletin board, “I’ve come to make sure you have an appropriate set of dress robes.”
“I wasn’t aware that one, you ever paid attention to procedure and protocol, and two, were even conscious during faculty meetings.”
“But if you see Claude, take at least twenty points! He’s trouble, that one. Just like his dad. Absolutely no regard for the rules.” Giggling to herself, she wandered away, gathering Filius in her wake of trailing yellow robes. Once again, Harry wondered how someone who was more on the Lovegood end of the dreamy-to-sensible spectrum could teach DADA.
“Yeah, doubt that,” Harry said with a wince. “Look, Malfoy, it’s a perfect set up for revenge—he gets this cursed necklace, pretends it’s stolen, somehow it ends up at Hogwarts, smuggled in by Audrey or something, and you get cursed.”
Harry crossed his arms. Malfoy’s eyes tracked every move. The jumper was wool and rather scratchy on his bare chest. “We could fly together sometime. I bet I’m still better than you.”
“It’s W, A, W, F, A, N, B, M, L, G, T, Q, A, Q, B, I, A, A, A, A, A, A, O, F, W, S, E, M, W—it’s short for Witches and Wizards and Non-Binary Mages, Lesbian, Gay, Transgender, Queer and Questioning, Bisexual, Intersex, Aromantic, Asexual, Allies and Any Other Folks Who Support Equality in the Magical World.” Harry breathed out.
Neville finished his piece of toast, considering this. “He has been asking a lot of questions about plant reproduction lately.”
(He hadn’t wanted to discuss any of this with Eileen; the strange camaraderie of having a mutual mission had done wonders for Draco’s prickliness and Harry didn’t want to have to examine why tracking down this purportedly missing cursed necklace was so important to him. Or the paranoia that had started this whole mission in the first place.)
Narcissa sighed. “As much as I’ve loved this chat, the Ministry’s trace should be plottable by about now, so maybe you could take me to my son before they take me to Azkaban.”
“You’re very …” Malfoy trailed off. Was he shaking? His shoulder was trembling slightly under Harry’s hand. “Handsome,” he said almost silently.
Was Parvati looking around for Henry? It would make sense. You were supposed to find your person and kiss at midnight, yay.
“Yeah, whatever,” Harry said. The Louvre was stupid. Art was dumb. Fuck the French people and their fancy foods and all that shit. He didn’t need anything other than bangers and mash, but mash was actually from South America, and he’d read recently there were over one hundred kinds of potatoes in Peru.
“This object is like,” Lavender glanced at Astoria. She shrugged. In for a penny, as Susan said. “Fucking radiating love.”
By the time the four of them sat down to breakfast, Elen had already slipped Harry two jam tarts and a chocolate éclair. Malfoy had received a cappuccino dusted with cinnamon. Harry still didn’t understand how elves seemed to be able to bend time and space in kitchens.
Harry made sure that Teddy was engrossed in dripping butterscotch over a crêpe filled with rainbow sprinkles and peppermint humbugs before flipping Malfoy two fingers. Elen cackled and caused Teddy to look up in confusion.
“I don’t want to go,” Neville said, and suddenly his large hands were on Blaise’s shoulders, kneading away the tension.
“You have to tell him it’s important—” Narcissa’s voice broke, “even if he thinks there’s no chance of it being requited; it doesn’t have to be practical or—but he has to keep that person in his mind.”
“Anyway,” Harry said, lowering his voice, “we’ve got an invitation now. We can just poke around a bit and see what’s up.”
The shop had dark windows and a lurid pink flourescent sign of a lipstick print. It was in a bit grimier neighborhood, and Harry checked the perimeter as he tucked his wallet away. Draco was oblivious and smiled at a rough sleeper, who looked confused and hurried away.
Harry had gone to the blackboard and was staring fixedly at the map. Maybe he could kill Malfoy and then escape to the Hebrides. He could live alone on one of those small islands. Maybe Malaga. That would be sunnier. Visions of bloodied knives and umbrella drinks swam in his mind’s eye.
He’d heard you were supposed to compliment people back. But then suddenly all he could think of were ridiculous things like,
Pomona raised her eyebrows and nodded. “I’ve always thought there should be more collaboration between herbologists and potioneers. Mind you, Severus didn’t see it that way.” She wrinkled her nose. “More of a one-way roundabout of demands.”
“I’ll teach you about the kettle and things tomorrow,” she said, gesturing towards the kitchen table.
They arrived at the Great Hall just as the doors were opening, so they got to shoo the suddenly-hesitant students inside. Cue gasps of delight as they saw huge gold chains spanning the ceiling.
“Perry, are you on drugs?” Harry hadn’t wanted to confront anyone about drugs ever; that wasn’t his job, really, even if they did talk about the American program D.A.R.E. and the sociopolitical implications of the crack cocaine epidemic.
“They should!” Draco sat up straight and began practically shouting about how students needed to learn multiple languages when they were young, and wizarding kids and muggle kids learned languages in primary school or through their at-home tutors, and how it was stupid to throw away multilingualism at the young age of eleven, and, besides, there were magical schools in other countries and they could do proper exchanges if they knew other languages.
Tea leaves weren’t her thing. She was more of a tarot, crystal ball, photos, clothing, anything solid, kind of seer. She wasn’t into plants. Even if they were dead and boiled. They were still leaves.
Malfoy shut his mouth, opened it again, and came back with, “That’s a singular example that disproves my second point in only one instance. You usually don’t give a shit.”
“I eat way too much ice cream already,” Florian said with a shrug. He spun around to take in the space.
One morning, when Harry was puttering around in his boxers trying to find the small jar of magical pomade Andre had gifted him (“From me and Perc and Ollie, don’t worry about it.”) in his dresser—honestly, Kreacher thought he had a better organizational system than anyone and it just didn’t mesh with Harry’s mind at all—a cold wind blasted across his shins.
How very curious, Blaise thought. He penned a quick note back, sealed it, and handed it to the owl, who chirped twice and swooped out the window.
“I wouldn’t, uh, do anything,” Harry said at last. “That would be stupid. It would also undermine the work I’ve been doing on, you know, forgiveness and equality and all that shit.”
Late Sunday afternoon, stuffed with Ron’s French toast and locally-sourced bacon, Harry and Malfoy stumbled out of the Floo in the staff room at Hogwarts. Padma looked up from her marking and said, “Nice romantic weekend away, boys?” to which Harry scoffed.
“What the fuck, Malfoy?” Harry hissed the minute Justin had dragged Perry away from the biscuit plate.
“I hardly think it’s bad, since I used it as the basis for my improved curricular reform plan,” Draco said with the hint of a smile. “Don’t get cocky, Potter.”
Draco looked him up and down and shrugged. “I suppose you’re ready for something,” he said, and began to unbutton his academic robes. His long fingers pushed each of the silver buttons through the fabric with a seductive grace—Harry shook his head and concentrated his attention on his cap. Molly had knitted it for him a few years ago, and he picked some of the pills off it.
Potter pulled a hair tie off their wrist and pulled their hair into a messy bun. “Gotta get to work,” they said with a wink as we finished our meal. We’ll be right behind you in the fight for equality, Harry!
Arthur patted her knee. “I know, love, but maybe it’s time to work on forgiveness a bit. I’ve been reading about this muggle character called Jesus, you know, the one who inspired Christianity, and one of his mottos was ‘turn the other cheek,’ which, to be fair, I’m not entirely sure I understand the story, but the gist of it is that you’ve got to allow people a second chance to hit you. And then if they don’t hit you again, they’ve probably regretted hitting you the first time and you’ve shown you’re the better person anyway. Or something.” He patted at his cardigan pockets and took out a tiny orange New Testament, which he began flipping through while mumbling to himself.
“What do you know?” Draco fires back. “Don’t pretend like you know anything about Pure Blood families. You don’t know what it’s like to be suffocated, to be forced into a mold that doesn’t fit you - “
It’s ironic. Harry saw Draco practically naked every day, in speedos and racing suits, shirtless and dripping wet. Yet he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the stick of fabric to his shoulders, the jut of his clavicle. It seemed different, somehow, more vulnerable.
Harry wakes on the roof of the car, his neck throbbing. The light burns even through his eyelids, a flat glow of red. Opening his eyes is a challenge - everything is too bright and his eyes are too dry. The metal of the car burns underneath his legs; Harry grabs half-heartedly at the blanket around his legs and freezes at the heavy weight of Draco’s head on his shoulder.
Draco froze. Harry could feel it, the tension bleeding into his body, the way the light died from his eyes. “Take your hand off,” he hissed, and Harry wrenched his arm away. Ron and Blaise had long since disappeared into the crowd - it was just the two of them, Draco’s fear leaching out into the air.
“Yeah,” Harry says, trying to hind the grimace and the lingering taste still in his mouth. “I could drink this all day.”
Draco leans his head against the open window and moans, the sound prickling uncomfortably in Harry’s ears. “God. Why does it have to be so
Harry blinks, disorientated. He’s curled up in the front seat, hood pulled over his head, shoes off and legs twisted to the side. There’s soft music playing through one earbud - the other must have fallen out, the cord tangled around his neck. His phone blinks up at him when he shifts.
He inches forward, wraps his finger around Harry’s hand. The punch is hard but Draco’s prepared for it now; he turns, letting Harry’s fist glance off his shoulder instead of his stomach. It hurts, breaking the scabs underneath his robes but Draco doesn’t let go.
They finally pull up to a McDonalds. The air is still impossibly hot and sticky - they both wince at the metal of their car, parked under the blazing sun and Harry knows it’s going to burn like hell when they finally go back.
Inside Draco looks as if he’s fallen asleep, head tilted against the corner of the room. He cracks open his eyes at the sound of the door opening, silver against the golden tumble of his hair.
They start back up again. Harry flips down the visor to shield his eyes from the sun, squints into the distance. His phone’s almost dead and when he plugs it in the screen lights Draco’s face with a sickly glow. Draco’s half-asleep in the passenger seat, eyes half-lidded and listless.
A beat of silence. Draco slowly pushes himself up; Harry’s shoulders ache from the loss of pressure, the blood rushing to his arms. There’s a crease on his cheek from Harry’s shirt, a red line streaked across Draco’s cheekbone; Harry puts his finger to it. Draco lets him, pupils blown wide despite the light, lets Harry trace a gentle line across his skin.
Draco was sitting on the hood of his car, one foot carelessly propped up against the grill. His hair was still wet from practice, water dripping down his neck, soaking into the thin t-shirt he was wearing.
Draco moves then. He wrenches the car door open, his grip almost vicious on the handle as he steps out, swings his bag out of the front seat and over his shoulder. “I told them that all we were was friends,” he says. “That it was all we’d ever be.”
“Just…” Harry trails off. He watches the swing of sea glass in the back, the gentle clink against the windows. “Make up your mind,” he whispers, and he can barely hear himself over the sound of dry wind and cars against the road. “If you tell me to stop I will. If you tell me to do anything I’ll do it. You know I would.”
He doesn’t know where he is - some tower room in Grimmauld Place. The house was huge, larger then the Manor, all stone and dark wood and huge green drapes. There are tapestries all over the walls, symbols embroidered on them in heavy gold thread; he recognizes a few of them. Whom ever owned this house must have been rich - Charmed Marks were expensive and there were hundreds of them all over the walls.
“It's funny, isn’t it?” Draco says. Harry looks over; Draco’s watching him, eyes like those chips of gems in the glass cabinet previously. “How people are remembered. You go your whole life hoping you’ll make your mark in some way but who knows? Maybe you’ll be remembered in the curve of a clay pot, in the pages of someone’s diary. Maybe you won’t be remembered at all. The world keeps going and going and one day you stop going with it.”
The numbers on the display tick up in an endless march, the sound of gas rushing through the rubber in Harry’s hand. The fluorescent lights make everything foggy, a study of mist and brilliance and the barest suggestion of shapes. He stares at Draco and thinks he looks like an angel - the biblical ones, wreathed in fire and ichor and glory.
Draco closes his eyes, breathing in everything; the air, the smoke, Harry, flush against his body, pressed up against his lips.
But this time Harry reaches across the dashboard. This time Draco takes his hand, presses his thumb into the divot of Harry’s wrist. This time Harry doesn’t look away when Draco smiles at him.
He takes the stairs down two at a time, pausing only to pull up directions on his phone. The drive there feels off-kilter - everything’s too silent, too dark. He’s grown used to the subtle weight of Draco beside him; the sound of his breathing, the glow of his phone. That electronic mix that always played on the radio, the odd compromise between both their tastes in music. It feels almost
in his chest rose, the fluttering that he’d long associated with Draco. “What’d you go and bite it like that for?”
“Oh he wants to see me naked,” Draco drawls, but he strips the hoodie off anyways. Harry stares at him - he’s in an oversized shirt, the kind they used to buy to easily slip over wet bodies. It hangs oddly on him - tight on the shoulders, loose everywhere else, riding up Draco’s rib cage where he twists to chuck the fabric into the back. If he closes his eyes Harry can picture him, all lean muscle and long lines, the arc of his spine as it melded into his shoulder blades.
They end up padding down carpeted hallways, towels slung around their necks. The door is half-stuck - Draco has to jam his shoulder into the frame. It flies open and smashes against the far wall, the noise echoing around the pool deck, hard tiles and walls, flickering lights and windows. Harry crans his head back to stare at the skylight - he can just catch a glimpse of the moon.
They push the seats back in silence. Draco rummages around and finds the blankets - they’re thin but the night is warm, and the heat from two bodies makes the car comfortable enough to sleep in. Harry wraps himself up in his blanket, turns so that he doesn’t have to face Draco, doesn’t have to watch the soft brush of his hair over his face, the long lines of his chest -
“Which one’s yours?” he whispers. There’s so many stars, a handful of glowing orbs tipped carelessly over the canvas of the sky.
The hum of the radio. The sound of the wind. The clink of string in the back, sea glass against shells, quarters against plastic. Harry looks up, out through the window, thinks he can just make out the faintest glimpse of Draco’s constellation as it vanished into the sun.
They come out to a mostly blue sky, the pink of the dawn faded to just a strip of yellow near the horizon. Draco silently pulls out a bottle from the plastic bag by his feet - Harry raises an eyebrow.
Harry coughs. His throat is gravelly, his eyes burning. The sun hangs directly in front of him, almost on the verge of setting. “How much further to the motel?”
It’s another ten minutes before Harry finds a place to pull over, a tiny field in the middle of nowhere. It’s all dead grass and dirt, the sky so low that Harry thought he could brush it with his fingers, the clouds pale wisps of light orange. They fling open all the doors and pop open the back - Harry brushes off the hood of the car while Draco goes through the snack bag. He finds a bag of chips and a bottle of Sprite - “Oh shut up,” he mutters when Harry smirks, climbs up to rest against the windshield next to him.
The sound of a bang startles him; Draco’s slammed his palm against the dashboard. Every line in his body is tense, muscles drawn tight. Harry watches him and thinks of a dive, hunched over the blocks, staring into the water.
“What,” Draco grumbles, his face half-mashed into his arms. Then; “Oh. Shit, sorry. Do you not want me to…”
Harry bites his lip. He thinks of midnight drives and ferry rides, hotel rooms and pool decks, airports and buses. He thinks of the way Draco always looked at him, the way his entire face lit up, the sobbing calls and empty change rooms and the way his hands would sometimes linger on Harry’s.
Draco gives him a slow, sweet smile. “Perhaps,” he echoes. His fingers go white where he grips the coin. “Why else would I wish for it?”
Gears. Colours. Draco’s face, distorted by shadow and the flash of lights, warped by the lines of coloured foam and soap.
He could have watched Draco for hours, flipping through the Prophet idly, the smell of warm coffee in the air. Draco notices him before long though; he rolls his eyes, tossing the newspaper over Harry’s head and onto the sofa behind him. “Creep,” he says, though there’s no venom behind the words. “How long have you been watching me?”
He shoves his spoon into his mouth, as if he could choke the thoughts down with sugar and ice. Draco gives him a strange look - he’s wearing the coin, Harry realizes, the coin he had bought from the market the day before. It’s threaded around his neck, hanging in the hollow of his throat, glinting in the reflection of the blazing sun. He wonders what Draco wished for.
So they stop at the museum just out of town - it’s a natural museum, specializing in rocks and minerals and fossils. It’s practically empty - not surprising, given that they were an hour and a half out from closing. Harry lets Draco drag him through it though, into rooms that looked like hidden jewels, black walls and wooden floors, artifacts illuminated with spotlights. He stares at a slab of rock on a pedestal, the faintest curve of a leaf embedded into the stone.
Draco smiles, distantly. His eyes are the exact colour of the sky. “What did you think,” he asks, abruptly, “when you first met me?”
He lines himself up at the edge, toes curled around the rim. Draco’s spinning around underwater; he comes for Harry with a devilish look that Harry can see even from up here. When he wraps cold fingers around Harry’s ankle Harry doesn’t protest; he lets himself be dragged into the pool.
Draco laughs, his breath warm against Harry’s skin. The air con whirls above then, white noise and static. “How long did you…”
“Harry,” he says and slowly pulls away, cupping Harry’s face with one hand. He lets his thumb drift along his cheekbone, his heart breaking at his Harry closed his eyes at the contact. “Are you…?”
Harry ignores him. He doesn’t bother to shut the passenger door, instead circling around to open Draco’s door instead. He watches as Draco slowly unfolds himself, all long legs and bony shoulders, his hood still pulled over his head despite the heat. He drops the keys into Harry’s palm.
