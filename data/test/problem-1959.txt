“Sì, please follow me, sirs,” the host said, smiling at them. Then he turned and lead them off onto the terrace, with menus in hand.
Harry looked straight at the camera—at Draco—and sang along quietly, 'No matter what you say about love—'  His eyes crinkled on
When finished in the bathroom, he climbed right into bed. It was pretty comfortable, not like his bed at the Manor had been, but, comfortable enough. He turned on the lamp and opened up his book—it was a Jon Snow chapter so he was pleased. Jon Snow, Arya, and Daenarys were his favourites.
He realised fairly early on that he didn’t have any remaining brewing to do and short of much else to do that didn’t involve returning to his room and potentially running into a visitor, he decided to shift some of the brewing equipment aside and sit on the long table with his legs crossed, gazing out the open window. That was where Hermione found him some time later, presumably once the others had departed.
“So you won’t—oh.” The man frowned, worrying his lip. “Shouldn’t you at least let her know that you’re out of St Mungo’s?”
“I don’t suppose you could bring me some clothing? I’d like to have a shower and I didn’t bring my things with me. If you’re able to go there, my home is in the woods next to the grounds of the former Malfoy Manor. Otherwise, I’ll just take that towel if you don’t mind.”
There were several chapters dedicated to the physiological effects of spaceflight, each one more horrifying than the last. The thought that he might have suffered from any or all of these kept him from reading the whole thing at once, since he frequently felt horrified enough that he set the book aside and busied himself with other pursuits.
Potter’s eyes immediately widened in alarm and his wand was in his hand an instant later. “That’s a good point. I’ll do it—what were the spells?”
There was no response, so Draco rolled his eyes to himself, tossed teabags into two mugs, and then sat down in his chair, shutting his eyes. Because damn the man, he was going to sit in his own chair in his own home.
The next morning Draco sent off a note to Potter telling him to not return that week, since he needed to do some more research before applying the next batch of enchantments. It wasn’t quite true, since he could begin his work on adjusting the steering and braking to rely more heavily on magic and less on air resistance and gravity, but he needed some time and space to get his brain working properly again.
The next day he found the trunk in the clearing, already attached to the three brooms that they’d completed. Inside the trunk there was an entire two-bedroom flat, furnished, with hot running water in the bathroom and a full pantry complete with Preservation Charms.
There was a warm hand on his shoulder, almost tentative in its touch. “I didn’t tell him about the details of the space project, since that’s yours to share, but he knows that I’ve been meeting up with you since the autumn. And he’s fine with it.”
Potter reached over, his fingers running along the end of the blanket that was still wrapped around Draco. “No making excuses about me being tired?”
“Sorry, Malfoy. Er, I was wondering if Vince is all right? He’s been kicking up a racket the whole time you were in there,” he said, waving an arm toward the steamy bathroom.
Draco spun around and called out, “Catch!” before tossing the broom over to Potter, who quickly scrambled to his feet and snatched it out of the air. Then he poked it curiously a few times.
“Yes, really,” she finally answered. “I thought it best to keep the grand reveal until now. Would you have come if I’d told you this was where I worked?”
Once or twice Draco considered writing to Nimbus but then just as swiftly dismissed the idea, deciding that if they required him to have a minder to use the brooms that he’d paid them for, they probably wouldn’t care that his brooms were essentially being held hostage.
On Saturday Draco couldn’t help but pop over to his house for lunch with the rest of his friends, even knowing that the hours spent with so many people that he didn’t know would be agonising, but he had to do it.
A bit over an hour later he landed, satisfied that the addition didn’t seem to negatively affect manoeuvrability in any way, nor did it get dislodged at any point.
“Oh, that would be lovely, thank you,” she replied amicably, as if this was a perfectly ordinary social call.
Eventually, after Eddie finished eating and grew bored with the grown-up conversations the boy toddled over toward Draco and sat himself on the ground at his feet, and proceeded to babble on about some stories that he thought probably had something to do with his toy, though the thoughts were so disjointed and his vocabulary wasn’t exactly robust that Draco found himself simply nodding and sharing simple responses such as, “I see,” and, “Of course.” That didn’t seem to faze the child at all though as he carried on quite happily until the platters of food were clear, Azzy and Luna were quite rosy-cheeked, and Susan was making noises about returning home.
Finally he followed, though slowly, not wanting to catch up to her since he didn’t know how to face those words and the conviction in her voice when she’d spoken them. When she arrived at the front gates he watched as she shared a few words with Potter, sweeping him up in her arms and holding him for a few seconds before stepping back and Disapparating. When Draco arrived at the gates he saw Potter look toward him with the full weight of his concerned expression and felt his shaky hold on his resolve begin to crumble.
Potter frowned “Oh. I mean, I meant it when I asked you to stay. I didn’t mean just for, you know, this. I meant stay.”
Draco snapped his eyes open, took in the dimly lit surroundings that included a bed, and managed to make his mouth form the word, “Off.” He could feel his chest heaving with the effort it took to breathe, and he was blinking hard, but he needed this.
On Sunday, after a morning of reorganising his pantry, Draco was just staring blankly at the loveseat when he heard the loud crack of Apparition out front. A groan escaped him before he could think about it and he rolled his eyes, scooping his hair back into a knot as he stood, and opened the door.
“I beg your pardon?” Draco asked, setting down his mug and flicking at some of the crumbs that were left on his plate.
Draco began by flying a few laps around the clearing, one fast around the bends, the others slower, then he tried a few turns, testing the reaction times, the amount of pull, then the brakes. He was vaguely aware of Potter watching him with a frown, and imagined he looked like he had no clue what he was doing, with the types of manoeuvres he was doing on a broom that was meant to go fast and offer a smooth ride, but he didn’t care. It would be important to determine how much the broom relied on air resistance and gravity, and he could learn just as much testing that practically as he could by dismantling the spellwork.
About twenty minutes later it was Luna’s turn to depart. After twirling a few times she stopped by Draco long enough to impart her odd wisdom— “Don’t be afraid to think your happy thoughts, Draco; they’ll keep the Wrackspurts away” —before swanning out the door like she was in a ballet.
Draco’s feet slid slightly on the slick ground so he dug his heels in, gritting his teeth until the log was lined up next to the wall. Then he bent his knees, braced himself, and lifted.
“Malfoy?” Potter asked then, sounding uncertain. As if there was even the slightest chance the man didn’t recognise him.
“Yes.” Then he cursed when he accidentally split the branch, so he tossed the splintered pieces of wood aside and worked on a third that he’d grabbed.
The afternoon was proving to be even longer, now that the sun’s potent rays were hitting their glass balcony door and the multitude of windows in their hotel room, turning the place into a greenhouse. Or an oven. Or the surface of the bloody sun.
“Just press it again. Imagine it lights up with the words Potter Stinks,” he added with a faint smirk.
“So, Draco. You went to test the Bubble-Head and Atmospheric Charms. Isn’t that right?” Her words were clipped, her tone sharp.
The liquid was amber-coloured and it burned going down, and Draco supposed that it didn’t quite matter what the faded label read since there was definitely alcohol in it.
“As much as I’d like to continue this,” he said, his voice sounding hoarse, “I think that we should both get some actual rest before Hermione arrives. And maybe we can revisit this once you’re not sleep-deprived and distraught.”
Draco made a non-committal sound, not really having anything to say to that. It wasn’t as though he really knew any of them. So instead he asked Potter about his friends, letting him talk for the both of them.
The elf drew himself up tall and proudly declared, “Kreacher has served the noble house of Black for over six hundred years.”
Potter’s jaw was set. “Look. You asked for the safety manual, but I can tell you right now that’ll be worse than useless. The only things that go into those are the promotional points about cushioning charms, and the fact that they have brakes. It won’t be technical enough for you.”
The other man snorted. “Yeah. Anyway, she made me stay for lunch, then she showed me the garden, then she introduced me to all of her birds—she has at least twenty of them, I swear, and they all have absolutely ridiculous names—and then finally we got to talking about you.”
Hermione was just tucking away her thermos and notebook in her bag when Draco asked what she had planned for Sunday.
Then there was the warm, heavy weight of his hands on Draco’s shoulders, slowly and methodically pressing into those aching spots, and he dipped his head, letting his chin fall to his chest.
And then he made the mistake of looking up, and the man’s eyes awoke every nerve in his body, the heat of his desire burning in his veins. He dropped the coat on the floor, and Potter took another step forward, then another, reaching out to pull Draco close.
Much later that evening he spent his time boiling the first collection of sap into a thick syrup, enjoying the almost spicy smell that filled the cabin.
He forced himself to relax. True, Potter could be lying but he’d always been a terrible liar, so Draco wasn’t so sure. And he truly didn’t think the man would go spreading the photos around, given how decent he’d been these past many months.
“Anyway, make that list and do let me know if you need any additional equipment,” she told him, before swiftly leaving the room and racing down the stairs.
The rest of the morning was spent manipulating the steering and braking sensitivity of the brooms, and as Potter had brought the trunks with him as well they very carefully made some more attempts at interior Atmospheric Charms.
“The brooms need to be attached to the trunk and I need to fashion some living quarters, but yes. It’s ready.”
“Teddy,” he replied with a groan, and Hermione made a small sound in the back of her throat. Potter glanced down at her and rolled his eyes, saying, “I know, I know. But Andromeda and I agreed that he’s grounded for the entire summer once school lets out.”
That weekend Draco took advantage of the dry weather to go on a long hike around the woods with a basket, making sure his route passed by all of the various clusters of wild raspberry and blackberry plants. If he’d planned better he should have collected the raspberries a few weeks earlier since several of the shrubs were already stripped by the birds and squirrels by the time that he reached them, but the blackberry yield that year was excellent and after several hours he had plenty.
Potter arched against him at the touch, adding his now freed hand to join the other in Draco’s hair. “Enjoy you—gorgeous idiot,” he groaned, then proceeded to suck hard on Draco’s bottom lip.
There was a guttural sort of sound from above him followed by a loud cry as Potter came hardly a minute later, hot come splashing over both of their chests where they were pressed together.
back soon,” Draco corrected, pulling out the bright green foam apple bearing some corporate logo that they’d been given as their latest International Portkey. Singapore. Well, that would certainly be hell on their internal clocks. “He doesn’t give a toss about me.”
Mercifully, his owl order arrived on Thursday so he was able to spend the afternoon making the final adjustments to the bathroom. And when he caught sight of himself in the mirror, seeing his own face for the first time in years, he didn’t recognise the stranger looking back at him.
Draco nodded, then turned to make his way back to his cabin. Until he sorted that layer of spellwork there was no point in beginning the next.
There was a clicking sound from Vince’s perch and Draco snorted, then couldn’t contain actual laughter when he saw Potter’s horrified face.
Draco sighed and leaned back in his chair. “I’m not going to hurt myself. Go out with your friends. Invite them here if that’s what you typically do, and I can stay in my room to not put you in an uncomfortable situation. Don’t put your life on hold for me, for Merlin’s sake.”
. Hermione had sent over some potions references and Draco passed the time quietly reading through them, making notes about possible solutions to their heat shielding problem. And often he’d awake at strange hours hearing Potter clatter down the stairs, and find himself on the sofa surrounded by books.
They ran through some specifics on the order that they would be working on the various charms, but once their tea was gone and the topic exhausted there was still a torrential downpour outside so they called it a day. The enormous chair was Vanished as soon as Potter had Disapparated, and Draco set about washing the mugs.
“Is it? I figured you and Hermione still had another hundred things on your list. So you did it? It’s ready?”
“Harry tells me you’ve changed. I see that, in part,” she replied, her gaze flitting quickly around the cabin, briefly pausing on the small bookcase next to his chair, before returning to meet his steadily, “and I also know that what you’re attempting has so many different possible ways to fail that you might not even know about. I’m fairly certain that I
He had managed some progress when he’d tinkered with the charm earlier, using his chair, but he soon realised that the broom was a bit simpler to work with given its smaller size and more uniform composition, at least as far as materials were concerned. He also determined rather quickly that he wouldn’t be able to create a large protective bubble of air around the entirely of the broom; this charmwork didn’t seem to led itself to that result at
“Draco? Is everything all right?” A pause, then in an incredulous tone, “Hey, is that my dining room table?”
“Really?” he asked as he followed, then Hermione led him down a corridor, across a strange, spinning room, along a complex series of more corridors, until they arrived at a small office. Once they were inside she shut the door and took off her winter attire.
Then his words caught up with him, and Draco shook his head in exasperation, making his frozen strands of hair rattle against each other. He turned to drag over the next log.
Friday he was a high-strung emotional mess from the moment he arrived at his cabin in the morning until he finally forced himself to fall asleep that night.
Draco considered, then suggested, “How about infusing the broom with a protective potion? I wouldn’t want to do anything topical in case it wears away, but if it’s absorbed into the wood. . . .”
“An overemotional idiot, yes. Mind you, I was the same, in a completely different way. But these days he almost reminds me of how Longbottom was.” He cast his eyes upward as he thought about that, then added, “Well, without the fear.”
Susan, meanwhile, simply smiled at him and said, “Well, it was lovely to see you under nicer circumstances, Draco. If you have any trouble with any of my coworkers do let me know.”
And then, once again not quite remembering falling asleep, he was blinking his eyes awake and frowning at the weight that was on him, realising that Potter must have returned at some point and placed a blanket over him. His frown deepening slightly, he slowly sat up and heard some movement just outside of the room.
Draco swallowed, feeling the tightness in his chest return as he considered his next words. “I’m still planning on leaving, you know,” he said quietly. “I still need to go. Up there.”
Draco caught the fingers, threading them together with his own. “No running off if you hear a noise?” he countered.
Hermione dropped the broom into what appeared to be a long drawer underneath a console covered in buttons bearing numbers, letters, and strange symbols. A moment later the broom appeared on the floor of the chamber below and she tapped at a series of buttons. Then she flipped a switch and the sign on the wall lit up bright yellow.
Draco was lying down on a soft surface that might have been his chair except that it didn’t recline quite this flat. Had he fallen asleep in the clearing again? But no, it was winter, so the ground would be much firmer. And the smells were wrong.
They started walking again, though it was at a slower pace. “I tried, you know?” Potter said after a few minutes. “Well, no offense but I didn’t care about your dad. But I really tried for you and your mum.”
There was a loud sigh from Hermione, and Weasley laughed too loudly, but soon the rest of the adults in the room returned to their conversation and left him to sit quietly. Which he was fine with.
Draco felt himself smiling reflexively in response, then had the sharp realisation that he was fucked.
Black. That brought him back to the faint memories of gloomy visits when he was only a few years old.
“I thought I’d help out. Got here a bit early, so I figured I’d make myself useful,” Potter said, his hand messing up his hair.
“What type of experiment was that supposed to be, exactly?” Potter asked, and the tone could have been scathing, or confused, but Draco only listened enough to register the words before dismissing them as unimportant.
Some amount of time later, once their bodies had cooled and Draco found himself shivering, they rose from their position. Before Draco could even think about making his way upstairs there was the tingle of a Cleaning Charm, then Potter was wrapping the blanket around him.
Draco sighed, muttering Potter’s name darkly as he stepped back and allowed her to enter. After he shut the door he crossed the room to put the kettle on. “Tea?”
The boy’s eyes lit up and giggled, and Draco caught Potter looking at him with bright eyes and a tender smile. He hastily looked away, glancing around the room for somewhere to sit and sank into an empty armchair near the door.
Potter cried out desperately, his words turning into pleas as he pressed back into the fingers, rocking against Draco as best as he could with his limited space. One of his hands had stopped attempting to find purchase on the door and was reaching down toward his neglected cock and so Draco leaned forward and ordered, “Hands off.”
Then again, the more names he heard in connection with Hermione and her personal life, the more that Potter’s earlier comment about independent women and sexual needs started to make some sense. Even though it was a subject he very much didn’t want to think about.
When Draco awoke the following morning his first thought was that he wished his chair was always this cozy and warm.
He spent the next hour or so fiddling around with the charmwork, then stood to stretch and walk around the clearing a bit, the cold from the ground having seeped through his trousers. Then he stopped and his frown deepened as he thought, looking between the broom, the ground, and then Potter. Well, more specifically, Potter’s rock.
“I should go,” Potter said quietly, giving his knuckles a soft squeeze before releasing his hand again. “Thursday morning, you said?”
Draco considered, for at least thirty seconds, whether it was wise to share his actual plans with Potter, but ultimately decided to err on the side of caution, privacy, self-preservation, and everything else that had kept him alive thus far in his remote home in the woods. So he simply sat there and sipped at his tea, observing as the tension dissipated and turned into something more . . . subdued. Melancholy, perhaps.
from Draco’s cabin and made some adjustments to the parameters of her testing console, then sent the trunk down to the chamber.
“Well, Susan was with us in the D.A., but we didn’t really get to know her until she and Ron were in Auror training together. A bunch of us would do Friday pub night together, a group from the old D.A., and most of the Auror trainees. When they finished their training they ended up being partners since they knew each other so well by then. It just worked, you know?
Blinking in bewilderment he simply nodded, and blankly accepted the hug of farewell from Hermione before they both left.
Potter leaned back, giving him a cocky little smirk. “Well, I used to enjoy it, but these days there’s been this rich prat who has me at his beck and call. Makes me wonder why I bother with the job sometimes.”
they were going to get around the blasted Extension Charm problem, which became so convoluted that Potter finally interrupted to demand that they at least try something rather than talk at each other all day, which resulted in another exploded trunk.
The Healer simply tutted and said, “Well, that is a fine question when your secretive work with the Ministry doesn’t allow me to actually know the specifics. I’m sure your colleagues can bring you up to speed. Now, can you confirm for me that you will have someone present in your residence to monitor your recovery who is capable of returning you here should your condition worsen?”
“I’ll need to think about the matter of heat, then. What about the other items you were unsure about last week? Will you be able to handle reversing the anti-tampering enchantments for the specific items I’d mentioned?”
“Typical Potter, doing whatever you like without any regard for others,” he replied loftily, and the ascent to his room to find clothing was accompanied by the rich sound of the man’s laughter.
Potter exhaled hard, glowering. “Look. You can’t. It’s mad. It’s dangerous, and you’ll die, so you can’t do it. Okay? Find some other hobby.”
He retreated to his room to gather up the books and papers he’d need and returned to the attic, not wanting to be wandering about the house once the rest of Potter’s friends arrived lest they notice him.
A few minutes later he was in the attic of the old Black house with all three cauldrons simmering, making a frankly alarming amount of the solution, while Potter poked around at the wall of junk.
Draco frowned, his eyes trained on the flowers. There wasn’t a crimson rose in sight, nor any other flowers of mourning. There were splashes of pink gladiolus for remembrance, purple columbine blooms for resolve, and some other flower he couldn’t place.
He bit the inside of his cheek, feeling as his breathing started to grow unsteady. “I’m. . . .” The words died in his throat.
“Well, I’m going to get a start on my dinner. You just let me know when you want to head out for a hunt.”
Potter didn’t exactly sleep for the week like he’d said but he did spend the next several days in a bleary state of semi-consciousness, popping up at odd hours for brief conversations before vanishing again.
Draco nodded. “I was thinking of heading out to the Great Mewstone off the south coast of Devon. The island is off-limits to muggles and I don’t imagine many witches or wizards will be out there this time of year, and I also won’t need to worry about the water being unbearably cold with what we’ve set up today.” He glanced over toward the rock and asked, “Does that work for you, Potter?”
“I could probably build a small addition,” he said to Vince. “What do you think? Maybe put in a real bath? Another window for you?”
Then there was the whisper of a spell and a cooling tingle brushed over his wrist, healing the burn that he’d forgotten about. Rather than releasing his hand he felt Potter’s thumb brush tentatively over his knuckles, startling him into inhaling sharply.
He lifted his mug toward her and quirked a brow, then said in a sarcastic tone, “That’s Slytherin for you.”
Draco’s gaze settled on the tree once more, taking in the decorations, a mix of some that were obviously child-made, and others that were so delicate and fine that he was surprised to see them in Potter’s home.
She definitely hesitated, since there was a weighty silence that seemed to stretch on for long seconds, but she responded in a bright voice that all was in order and that she would see him the next day. A moment later the door opened and shut, the attic returning to silence.
Then he put some oil in his hair, tucked himself into his quilt, and spent the next hour carefully combing out his hair for the first time in over a decade.
Potter’s hands were everywhere, scraping up his back, running up his chest, clutching at his shoulders, gripping his arse. Draco’s were fighting against the multiple layers—honestly, why was Potter wearing a jumper and shirt and a singlet
But then he swiftly dismissed the thought, because of course people were going to judge him for his name, whether it was because of his own actions or those of his father. That was just the way things were, and would be.
“Hmm. You’ll see him before then, right? Or I suppose you can write him, whichever’s easiest.” She was replacing the notebooks that she’d pulled out over the course of the afternoon in her bag with an expression indicating that her words were completely reasonable. Which they weren’t, but he found that he couldn’t bring himself to argue with her.
His father’s grave wasn’t too far from the edge of the cemetery, nor was it terribly ostentatious, unlike many of the others nearby. The gravestone rose to his mother’s waist and was made of marble, of course, but it lacked the gargoyles, statues, fountains, and other monuments that were present elsewhere.
The hot shower did wonders for his sore joints, and he spent some time running his fingers over the strange skin discolouration on his chest. Upon closer inspection it seemed to be focused in the same area as the fine white lines that remained of that incident in Myrtle’s bathroom all those years ago. Perhaps the nature of the curse scars had prevented the rash from fading during his hospital stay.
Potter slumped back against the sofa and tilted his head to face Draco, meeting his gaze. “I didn’t make any promises, but she was almost as difficult to stand up to as Hermione. She really misses you, Malfoy. She—well, she did a good job of hiding it, but there were a few moments where she seemed to be a breath away from sobbing. She
They’d been heading away from the pier for ten minutes when they finally emerged from a winding alley only to find themselves . . . back on the pier.
Draco let out a sigh and scratched at his beard. He hadn’t realised the dangers of simply being present in the vacuum of space, beyond the fact that there wouldn’t be air. “I see,” he said, wondering if there were any other gaping holes in his plan that could lead to a spectacular failure.
“Er, yeah. I suppose that’s a fair point. I guess I also didn’t really know what to do with the stuff at the time?” His hand was in his hair, nervously mussing it as he appeared to actually notice the horrors of his collection.
After that Hermione didn’t stay away. She showed up in the early afternoon on Tuesday, hours before any of the others would be arriving for game night, and ambushed Draco in the drawing room to drag him into a discussion about the trunks. Then on Thursday morning she appeared while he was trying not to fall asleep into his mug of tea after having been mauled by Potter against the pantry door, chattering about setting up a brewing station to work on some of the heat protection concoctions that he’d selected from his research.
He could feel heat building within him and his blood was roaring in his ears, so when Potter took a step back and his lips formed words he couldn’t focus on them, but they were both promptly naked and he reached out to push Potter back onto the bed.
Potter sighed and looked away, his expression stiffening. “And I’m accompanying her on the 25th. Because you won’t.”
“Here, enjoy a snack while you wait.” Potter accepted them with a bemused expression, then sat on his rock.
“I suppose you did warn me. He’s dangerous. You knew that, and you warned me about him, and yet here I am, losing my bloody mind.”
It was a bit after eleven when he arrived, and while he was still bracing himself he heard the door to the drawing room open and the sound of laughter and voices carry down from the first floor.
Partway through his brewing he was aware of Potter asking Kreacher to pop over to the cabin to retrieve a few trunks, and so once the solutions were ready he was able to set to work immediately applying the cooling liquid to the first one. Then he set to work on another triple batch, then another, until he had three trunks set aside to slowly absorb the potion.
Then, so slowly it almost hurt, he dragged his thumbs along Draco’s knuckles in an unmistakable caress.
He felt himself paling at the thought that the terrifying woman he’d visited on her deathbed as a child had just been forced to listen to them both have loud and desperate sex.
They’d arrived at the Atrium and were standing outside the lifts, Potter frowning and chewing on his lip. After some great deliberation he appeared to silently sigh, his shoulders slumping, then he said simply, “Later, Malfoy,” before turning and making his way to the bank of fireplaces.
It didn’t take much effort to remove Potter’s jumper. For some reason that entirely escaped him the shirt underneath had about a hundred buttons, and Draco was beginning to think that he did it on purpose. He wrenched at the offending fabric, hearing the faint sound of tiny buttons hitting the floor and an answering rumble of laughter as his own shirt was then pulled over his head and tossed in the direction of the staircase.
“He hasn’t then. That’s a shame. Well, it’s lovely to see that you two have been getting along nonetheless.”
“I’m not meeting with my mother alone. And my being there should limit your responsibilities in this farce of a visit. You won’t need to accompany her to the grave. We can be of use to each other.”
The last two things he saw before the whirl of the Portkey were a flash and Potter’s brilliant smile.
He considered, then decided that if he needed to do his experiments in front of Potter anyway there was no point in being secretive about the adjustments he was planning. “First would be the Bubble-Head Charm.”
“Kreacher has brought a towel,” the house-elf said with a small bow. “Is Master’s guest needing anything else?”
He blinked. “The Manor isn’t mine. I live here.” When the man immediately opened his mouth, no doubt to ask intrusive questions he had no right to, he added, “And that wasn’t an invitation to talk about it.”
“This isn’t single-malt Scotch, Draco,” Potter said. He looked over and saw the man holding the glass up to eye level, looking at it critically.
He shrugged again, wincing slightly. “I’ve never had any issues with the chair before. It was far better than the cot in Azkaban. And honestly, where am I supposed to keep a bed in here?” he asked rhetorically, gesturing around the cabin without turning away from the wash basin.
“Well, I’m still looking into a few things for the cloaking and radiation portions of the list. Maybe you can apply the infusion for heat protection to a trunk and we can test that?”
“And third, if something should happen to me in the course of these tests, press the button next to the door. That will alert a senior member of the department currently within the building and they will follow proper protocols to resolve the issue. Do not attempt to Apparate me to St Mungo’s from here. Do not attempt to try healing spells that you may have used once on a three year old named Teddy Lupin. Do not try to be a hero.”
Draco took his time finishing the rest of the roll, considering. This was their fifteenth stop and they had countless more remaining. And honestly, who was Potter going to tell at this point? The man had hardly any life outside of this ridiculous assignment that Draco
“Well, maybe more than a few. Thursday or Friday pub nights. Saturday lunch. Sunday roast at the Burrow. And Tuesday game night at least once a month.”
That night Draco dreamed of glimmering golden light, and green eyes, and warm smiles, and awoke covered in sweat, his quilt tented.
“I don’t handle close calls well,” the man continued, looking down, his hands still shaking. “Especially not with people I care about.”
And then he felt fingers threading into his hair and he couldn’t help but allow a small smile to form on his lips.
Three more months of listening to Fry rabbit on about contraptions, laws, famous figures, customs, words, hopping from one to the next without any recognisable lesson structure, or common thread beyond the obvious.
“Well . . . yeah?” Potter looked nonplussed. Then there was a sudden look of comprehension. “Oh. They’re not together, you know. Ron married Susan Bones a few years back. Ron and Hermione failed spectacularly at being a couple for about four years before they finally called it quits. To everyone’s relief including their own.”
Draco turned away from him and strode out to the centre of the clearing, more to give himself some space from the man than anything, and firmly wrenched his attention back toward the subject at hand.
And he was overwhelmed by everything that he was afraid to think and feel when the beautiful man rode him, moaning relentlessly, head thrown back, the light of the full moon illuminating their movements on the bed as he sank repeatedly onto Draco until they were both finally nudged over the edge into the abyss, climaxes tearing through them, reducing them both to a shuddering heap of limbs.
“Just wondering if you were out for a swim,” he replied, gesturing at the towel that Draco had hung up by the door, and then his clothing, likely at the fact that it was obviously still damp.
Draco clenched his jaw, feeling his back stiffen even more as he contemplated the horrible thought of being trapped around so many people, all of whom absolutely had every reason to despise him. It would be just as much a reminder of his past failures as seeing his mother would be, though in a very different way.
The sleet continued long into the night and the next morning, only letting up mid-afternoon, and there was quite a mess to clean up that evening before he could continue his work on the addition. On Saturday he worked long hours, managing to finish laying the logs for the walls and Sunday was spent securing the roof extension, and making sure the structure was well-sealed against the elements.
Once he’d been lying on the blanket looking up at the stars for some time, tracing the Black constellations that he’d grown up learning about, he said quietly, “They’ve been up there, you know?” He didn’t know where Vince was, couldn’t see him in the dark, nor could he hear the silent hunter, but he knew that the owl was out there somewhere. He always was. “Muggles have been to space. They managed it decades ago. Before my parents were even at Hogwarts.”
“I’m not telling you anything, actually,” Draco said evenly, that old spot of irritation inside him bristling.
He looked around, the motions exaggerated. They were in a dark, gloomy alley, hardly wide enough for the single lane of cars that were trundling up a very steep hill. Along one side of the already-narrow road there was some sort of excavation taking place, the asphalt torn apart and a smattering of striped orange pillars strewn about.
Potter sighed in response, then led the way up to the upper floors, lingering in the doorway of Draco’s room while he packed his things away in the trunk that Hermione had left him.
If only the hotel didn’t have a bloody dignitary staying in it, meaning any use of any magic whatsoever had to be run through about fifty levels of clearance regardless of whether they might all die of heat stroke.
“I almost want to report in that you’re planning something illicit with the brooms, so that you have your rights to purchase and use them revoked,” Potter said quietly, not looking up.
Unfortunately Potter took that as encouragement, because he was then grabbing Draco’s hand and dragging them along yet another alley, but one that did happen to contain a rather busy souvlaki eatery.
Draco’s right hand was still held captive so he reached forward with his left, searching blindly for Potter’s leg and instead hitting something hard that clattered loudly. Fumbling slightly, trying to just move the mobile out of the way there was a click then a blinding flash, and as they both flinched back there was another one.
Potter let out a heavy breath and spun around. “All right.” Then he looked around the cabin, glanced out the window, then shook himself slightly. “All right,” he repeated. “I need to go. We obviously can’t work in this weather, and I didn’t exactly plan to come here anyway tonight—I don’t even have the brooms. Shit, and I still need to settle my tab. I’ll be back next week.” Then he Disapparated on the spot.
While everyone else was gathering plates Potter stepped back from the group and asked quietly, “All right?”
“Press the small oval,” Draco instructed, then watched as Potter did so, the bottom of his cloak sticking to the bristles that it had been pressed up against. Then he shook the broom, and tossed it away from him, only for it to stop a bit over a foot away before falling, unable to travel farther with its tether.
Then a bark of bitter laughter burst out of him. “Do you remember? They said my sentencing was merciful because there wouldn’t be dementors. But then I guess it was, in a way—if there had been dementors it would have been a life sentence one way or another. Even if I’d come out of there alive, I wouldn’t have been sane.”
He nodded in understanding, then frowned at the seeds that were keeping that hand occupied. He walked over toward Potter, holding them out.
Vince flapped his wings a bit through he didn’t take off from his perch, then he ruffled his feathers.
“Later, Malfoy,” Draco repeated to himself quietly a moment later, amused, shaking his head slightly.
“No. Absolutely do not allow her to have that much power over him. And do what you can to control how much access she has to him, and ensure that he isn’t alone with her without you or his grandmother present. She wouldn’t hurt him, but she would certainly put some persistent ideas in his head.”
He also wrote to Nimbus, ordering a dozen brooms and requesting a safety manual to include a listing of any enchantments already on them.
“Oh, I guess that’s all of them then, thanks. Actually, do you want the tree? You could probably use it for firewood?”
The man stood and approached, nodding. “Yeah. You’ll need to Side-Along me there since I’m not familiar with the area, but we can do that the next time I come by. Maybe we should have a second broom set up with the same enchantments so that I can follow along?”
By the time he had eased his way down the stairs and found the kitchen in the basement it was quarter to nine.
It had only been five days but it very well could have been years, the way that Draco instinctively clung to him, his fingers digging into the cabled jumper and his lips moving against Potter’s, their tongues tasting each other’s greedily.
It only took a few pulls at his cock before Potter was coming too, his muscles pulsing rhythmically around Draco, come splashing hot against his stomach.
The man sighed, his fingers resuming their path across his skin. “I just think it shows how much we’ve both changed. We went from hating each other so much that I could do this to you, to—to this. Now.”
So instead he worked on making the charm activate for any rider once they made contact with the broom, and tested it with himself and with Vince.
Draco looked over to see him looking at the horrifying troll leg and raised an eyebrow. “I don’t think you should sound so fond when looking at
Potter cleared his throat again, then fumbled awkwardly at his pockets and withdrew a wad of folded up papers. After rifling through them for half a minute he said, “So, they’re functionally immune to natural fire. They can also withstand the fire of an
And that he kissed slowly as well, his tongue slipping in between those lips, lips that were swollen from how much Potter had been biting them. He tasted the man’s tongue, familiar now but still always an incredible sensation. He sucked at those lips, smiling into them when he felt Potter’s hands clutching at him, holding on as if he was going to float away.
A bit over an hour after they’d started Hermione tucked her notebook away with a satisfied expression. “That should do it for that particular requirement. And I don’t foresee any issues with your Sticking Charms. You mentioned going to the coast to test the Bubble-Head more thoroughly?”
Draco could feel his tension pulling at his shoulders, causing the dull ache to throb. “I should go,” he said quietly.
Potter scooped her up in a hug and dropped a light kiss on the top of her head, before she laughed again and pushed him away. “Thanks for lunch, Harry, it’s been too long. And you two, behave,” she added with a stern look, before leaving the room.
Draco took a few seconds think over her words before making his way back down to the kitchen, taking a seat across from Potter.
And he was struck speechless. Harry bloody Potter had brought him an entire roast dinner and had set it out on a table in his little cabin, and he didn’t know what to say.
“Before we get started, I need to go over some health and safety,” Hermione said primly, ignoring a scoff and an eye roll from Potter. “First, at no point should you enter the chamber when that sign is illuminated,” she instructed, indicating a large portion of the wall with the faded words ‘IN USE.’ “Even if it looks like nothing is happening in there. Even if you’re tired of waiting for the light and can’t imagine that anything could possibly go wrong.” She was staring hard at Potter, and Draco felt a small smirk playing at his lips.
Once his wrist cooled he gingerly touched at the red spots, hissing in pain as the contact stung. “I’m such a mess,” he muttered, giving Vince an apologetic look for having caused him distress.
Malfoy trailed after him, and, only once they were out the door, said, “This was … nice. But … don’t you see how this was a mistake?”
Hermione exhaled, smiling properly now. ‘We need to be better, too … we can’t just be—’ She cleared her throat. ‘—Snogging all the time.’ A blush coloured her cheeks.
'I don't know what you're saying,' Draco muttered, as he clicked the big button. Another flash came out, and the picture flashed over the screen.
There was a flurry of cheers, of hugs, of tears. Harry was disoriented, tugged and pulled and embraced.
“Do you want carbonated water?” Malfoy leaned forward to ask Harry. And Merlin did those clear grey eyes sparkle in the candlelight.
He raced through the halls, carefully rushing past Hermione and Ron, so as not to brush up against them. He wound through the hallways, eyes searching. Then, he saw it: the flash of white-blond hair.
“I am certainly not smiling." He was definitely smiling. "I only have a crush on you, my sweet, beautiful wife,” Draco said, pulling her towards him so he could kiss her temple.
'That's … fine.' Draco was pretty sure Harry had just cancelled plans for him. 'Were you supposed to see that person today?'
Harry saw stars behind closed eyelids, coming hard in long spurts against his hand, thighs and the comforter. He moaned, and Draco kept licking him until Harry’s body stilled.
They settled into a two-person table together. A waiter came over to take their orders. Draco still couldn’t stop smiling. He kept trying not to... but it wasn't working.
It was so immediately different from the Hogwarts courtyard, that it left Draco feeling disoriented.
Draco was startled that it was Potter, for one thing. And for another, he was startled at the change of tone from their hotel room—it was friendlier now, almost gentle. He licked his lips and kept staring down. “Watching the fish.” Draco winced. His voice sounded sad to his own ears.

Malfoy stared at him, blinking slowly. Then he turned his head abruptly. ‘Okay. I’ll figure out the details.’
be absolutely enamoured? Pansy was mistaken, there was nothing embarrassing about them. They were … wholesome. Bloody endearing, really.
Neville nodded, and stood up tentatively. It seemed like he was considering saying something, but thought better of it. ‘Well I’ll be going, then. See you at dinner, Harry.’
This one came from Lashkar-Gah, Afghanistan. Harry performed his customary diagnostic spells, before unwrapping it. His spells revealed traces of old concealment magic, old warding—enchantments that would’ve once kept it hidden and locked away. Those spells had all been lifted recently. Within a few months.
“Alright, if I win …" Malfoy looked around the stadium as he thought. Then he whipped his head back around with a cheeky smile on his face. “If I win, I get to borrow your broom for the rest of the year.”
Draco’s journal immediately chimed. It was soft and pretty, like wind chimes swaying on a sunny cottage balcony. Draco smiled, and opened up to the latest page.
, isn't it? Haven't a clue as to how they did it—the orcs, the elves, the bloody ...' Draco trailed off, considering Harry. 'Frodo was a bit like a shorter, paler
Harry smiled, walking around the bed to the other side, and sitting down—overtop the covers, for now.
“Today, we will be starting a brew of Bleutitius Potion, and don’t think I haven’t noticed you all partner with the same people each time. Let’s mix things up,” Slughorn chuckled at his own attempt at a Potions pun. “Let’s see. Ms Parkinson, why don’t you switch with our Harry here. And Mr MacMillan, you with—"
Draco stopped to admire a cluster of fan-like mushrooms at the base of an old tree. He crouched down to get a better look. They were chanterelles. Edible. He stood up and kept walking.
He sighed. And set the pot of noodles down on a trivet on the countertop. “Yeah, mate. I’ll take them in to work tomorrow.”
), in the dirt not far from a couple of fat chickens. This elegant man, with his long limbs and paleness and smooth skin, whose family had a mansion. Draco, in the dirt.
cluttered. So many colours. Shelves overflowed with books, loose papers, and with odds and ends like a Big Ben snow globe and a pile of scarves. He had mint green wallpaper, and an assortment of old furniture that seemed not to match—a worn purple couch, red faux-leather armchair, a gold-painted desk, a blue coffee table.
‘I forgive you, too,’ Harry interrupted. ‘And I pushed right back—it wasn’t all one-sided, you know? I insulted you back, I—’
In that instant, Draco’s heart was in his throat. He hoped he didn’t look as alarmed as he felt. ‘Hello.’
Harry and Malfoy stepped up to the drink table at the same time. Harry hadn’t planned on this; in fact, he’d been avoiding looking at Malfoy ever since he was caught staring so openly at him. But now … now they were in each other’s space, and Harry couldn’t avoid looking at him now.
true, wasn’t it? They’d said they were going to try to be friends, yeah. And they’d already pretty well achieved that—he was staying at his flat, after all.
Malfoy slowly sank back down into his desk chair again, bringing the letters closer to himself, staring down at them. “If that’s all—” he began.
“So, you’re wearing Muggle clothes, you’re at a Muggle retreat, and you’re reading a Muggle novel,” said Potter.
Draco looked him in the eye. ‘I’m going to France to find my parents. And if they don’t kill me for what I’ve done,’ he said, laughing a little, ‘I’m not sure we’ll come back to the UK. The Manor will be ruined … I shudder to think of what
Then he remembered the note. He looked down at his hand—gripping the parchment tight—and willed himself to relax, taking a deep breath before opening it up.
“No,” Draco answered automatically. He needed to think more. He had to... process all this. Draco hazarded a glance at Potter, who nodded—as a muscle clenched in his jaw.
of the proud looks he'd seen on all their faces as this gallery auction was being organised. They'd been so excited that he was too.
A quartet was set up to the right of the arch, three women and one man—each holding a string instrument.
‘They refused to leave you, so they had to be taken … forcefully. And now they’re being guarded by French Aurors … in France …'
'But … I come with a peace offering.' A pause. 'Food?' Draco buried his face deeper in the pillow. 'Can I come up?'
How could Harry be so unrelentingly kind? So very good? Draco’s heart was fit to burst. He reached up to run his fingertips over Harry’s forearm.
He settled himself to watch the fish comfortably, with his chin resting on folded arms. Draco's hair fell down towards the water, hiding his face from view.
Harry sighed, deciding to indulge Neville and his Muggle book. ‘Alright, then, what does your book say it means?’
Draco Malfoy in that shower. Silver eyes and pale expanses of skin. Harry’s finger up Malfoy’s arse.
Draco hummed, and sipped at his drink. He seemed to be mulling something over. Harry let him mull, and looked around the room. Strangers laughing, strangers snogging, Luna’s terrible taste in music. It struck him that he was strangely grateful to be there. He couldn’t explain it, but … it was nice.
-I'm in self-isolation alone, so if any of the interactions in here are weird, it's because I've forgotten what human interactions even are
“I can’t see why, when I’m the one who likes cats.” Draco looked stiff as he talked, Harry found it curious. “She, on the other hand, is one of your kind.”
Draco flicked his gaze up to Potter, and the man looked thoughtful, but his eyes were bright. Too bright.
Out in the hallway, he said, “That is a very disorienting way to be reached, Harry. I nearly had a heart attack. Out of the blue a giant animal, that has no natural reason for being in the air, just charging at me,
‘You don’t know Doctor Who?’ Harry asked, aghast. ‘A 900-or-so-year-old alien with a flying blue police box? Goes on adventures in space and time?’
And there was nothing to continue their conversation. Had Draco said something wrong in his last note? Had he said something offensive? Merlin, he wouldn’t put it past himself.
Harry felt fucking awful saying all that out loud. The waiter brought twin plates of something that looked like a pile of children’s crayons. Harry took a bite of a pink one. Oh ... it was really good—it tasted like salmon, and had a good crunch.
“I’ve got to put my pants back on, or we’ll get distracted again and miss the movie. And I’ve picked out the perfect one for you,” he said, as he tossed Draco’s pants at him.
. He’d been a Death Eater, he’d let those monsters into Hogwarts, he’d nearly killed Ron. It all seemed contradictory now, after having testified in support of Draco back then. But at the time, Harry didn’t want to hear any pitiful excuses from Draco, and he certainly hadn’t wanted to be his
“Anyway,” she said seriously, as she stood up straighter. “More importantly, the bonfire party is tonight.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He could argue, but Potter might shout again. Evidently, they can’t seem to carry a normal conversation. Of course they can’t.
Harry hadn’t expected to be alone in Luna’s bedroom with Draco Malfoy. But, that was all right, he supposed. He cleared his throat, and approached the bed, where Draco was now sitting, petting the cat. Candelabra was just a plain, regular cat with short white hair and blue eyes. She was purring now, rubbing her side up against Draco’s arm, then turning around, rubbing her other side against him.
Harry pushed himself up off the sofa, so they were eye-to-eye. His expression turned apologetic, and Draco was quite sure that whatever he was going to say, Draco didn't want to hear it.
Harry didn’t want to hear it, couldn’t believe it, and tried to insist that surely something could be done. Dumbledore calmly told him about the Unbreakable Vow between Professor Snape and Narcissa Malfoy.
And those positive moments were weak at best. They didn’t make up for everything else. For calling Hermione a Mudblood, for trying to get Dumbledore killed in the first place and hurting other people in the process, for breaking Harry's nose, for a whole slew of petty bullying. And, for letting Death Eaters into the school. Fuck, that was a big one.
—but also didn’t want him … It was fine. It was like him and Ginny, probably. He’d wanted Ginny, because he liked the idea of them together. He’d tried to paint her as the perfect wife, the perfect mother in his head. She was passionate and beautiful and intelligent and every good thing. But … he wasn’t in love with her. He wasn’t physically attracted to her. His body did not respond … to her body. No matter how much he’d tried, no matter how much he’d wanted her to be the one for him, it just wasn’t going to work.
Draco settled himself down on the ground, crossing his legs loosely and leaning back on his hands. Their knees touched, just barely.
Astoria stood up from the sofa as soon as she spotted them, and Harry watched on as Draco walked away from him, towards his wife, while feeling a pang—a yearning—that he had no right to feel.  He was losing his party-mate, then. Was he going to have to talk to one of these strangers? Pretend to be interested in them when he knew that, if he wasn't talking to Draco, he'd rather be at home wallowing again?
Late-August London had found itself in the midst of a heatwave. The air was thick, muggy, and Harry Potter would rather be at home in his garden with a cooling charm and a bowl of ice cream than be in Diagon Alley, purchasing school supplies.
Harry looked at Draco, with that little smile, with his nearly white hair—un-gelled these days—just softly framing his face, and thought: he’s lovely.
Finnegan elbowed Potter, startling him, and causing him to look away from Draco for a second. “C’mon, I’d say out of all of us, my arse is the nicest. Eh, what do you say, Dean?”
He gave a little shake to his head. ‘I heard what you said …’ His brow furrowed. ‘I didn’t know you like blokes.’
Draco’s free hand was pressed up against Harry’s chest—over his heart, as their mouths moved in synch with each other.
It’d been another boring week of mindless paperwork, which was typical. Ever since Harry and Ron had been, for all intents and purposes, ‘benched’, after a series of reckless behaviour early on in their careers, they were now … making the best of it. At least they got to be together every day, Harry supposed. And Robards was bound to put them back on the field, once they’d earned their keep.
Harry pulled away even more, so he could see the whole of Draco. As his finger reached the base of one long scar, he shifted it to Draco's penis—soft and falling against the bed. He traced his finger over the length of it, as Draco sucked in a breath.
Realising he was (possibly, and only a little bit) obsessing over Malfoy again, he sighed. And made to put the invitation back onto the fridge (why was he still keeping it on the fridge?—a thought for another day, perhaps). His eye caught on the words in small type: ‘Registered at Marks and Spencer’.
‘How were your summers?’ asked Dean, as they one-by-one hoisted their trunks into the luggage racks.
, and she actually seemed serious. Digging his tongue into the corner of his mouth—a nervous habit—he shrugged. “God, I don’t know. Should we?”
” uttered the ghost, with her hands still poised in the air, wanting so much to cradle that girl’s face.
They sat together in companionable silence for a while watching. It was comfortable. It was... nice.
He padded out of the dorm room, as quietly as he could, and crept down the stairs. A low fire crackled in the common room hearth, but the rest of the room was silent. Empty.
‘Okay, Potter,’ Malfoy answered, looking very tired. He closed his eyes and arranged himself more comfortably in the bed.
Malfoy stayed silent. He had a hand covering his eyes and his shoulders shook gently. Harry took a few tentative steps forward, eyeing the bed, thinking he might sit on it ...
“Yeah, yours too.” He said, gesturing at Draco’s chest. Draco crossed his arms (in defense?). “You know, I’d intended that one for Astoria.”
Sure enough, Blaise had intercepted her and was currently leading her back towards the main building, with a torch guiding their way.
Draco's kitchen was filled with bright, morning light from the east-facing window. He rubbed at his eyes, and filled the kettle up with tap water. He clicked it on to boil.
And it was like a deep breath in, after holding it for too long. Harry’s face—warm, and rough with stubble. But his lips pliant and soft, all the same.
He opened up the card. Merlin, he was awful at these things. He looked up at the salesgirl, who was making a show of pretending not to pay attention to him.
Harry laughed. 'No. It's digital, you can transfer the pictures onto a computer. Share them to Facebook and whatnot.'
Harry laughed breathily, and pulled back to look in Draco's half-lidded eyes. 'Not really. I just like touching you. Is this okay?'
Draco smiled privately, and took a gulp. As the warming liquid went down, he realised he felt pretty light and open. He’d hit just the right amount of buzzed, he figured. He still had most of his wits about him, but was pleasantly relaxed. Just right, really.
'Evan,' Draco began. He was the calm before the storm. 'I have three drinks here, if you'd like to select one to throw in this man's face.'
Potter’s searched Draco’s face. “Okay... For the record though, I’m... I’m sorry.” He winced. “I never meant to... hurt you like that.”
Harry looked so pained and conflicted that Draco had to laugh. 'I'd never do that. Or maybe I would,' he considered. 'But, not with you.' That much was true.
Draco wasn’t supposed to be noticed. And not by Potter. Potter wasn’t supposed to be able to read him so well. They weren’t friends.
He nodded, reluctantly. Why hadn’t he prepared? He could’ve spared some time in the Forest of Dean to think of some gentler way of letting Ginny know how he felt. ‘Ginny, I love you so much.’ He really did. She was family.
They finished their meal, spelled the dishes to self-clean, played a game of Wizard’s Chess (Draco won), before it was time for bed.
Harry wasn’t really paying attention to the words appearing on the journal beside him. He was imagining that shower fantasy.
Harry stopped moving and stared at Draco. No one had ever asked him that before. It really hadn’t been possible to travel before, what with Voldemort and all. But now … ‘Yes. I’d really love that.’
A breathy laugh, and a lopsided smile, which seemed so boyish and nostalgic that it yanked at Draco’s heart uncomfortably—stirring up old memories from hidden places carefully filed away. Old, dusty feelings. ‘Well, yeah.’
They looked at each other for a moment, contemplating each other. Their pasts. Their presents. How far they’d come. What they’d had to overcome.
Her face softened. ‘But you didn’t act any different—we thought it would be funny, something for us all to laugh about. It could’ve brought you out of your slump.’
They popped out in Harry’s living room, which was a bit more Harry-ish now, with framed Order photos, and pictures of Ron, Hermione, and a few other friends. He had a television, a sofa, an area rug, some armchairs. It was homey enough, he figured. Lots of rich, dark wood and warm colours.
'Who is the lady of the snows?' Draco asked softly. There was no one in sight, but it still felt as if they should keep their voices down. He wasn't sure why.
Afterwards, the floorplan was magically rearranged into round dinner tables, with white linen tablecloths and blue-ribbon runners. Centrepieces of candles and bouquets of wildflowers popped up on the tables. Ginny and Harry were sat with what must’ve been the bride and groom’s oldest relatives. Each of them had wispy white hair, and various assisted mobile devices. The lot of them seemed to content to sit back and watch the goings-on, rather than make conversation. And that was all fine with Harry too.
Harry tried not to stare when Draco brought the first mouthful up to his lips, but he did anyway. Draco chewed, and started to look amused. His eyes met Harry's as he finished chewing and swallowed, shaking his head slightly. The look on his face turned into an all-out smile. 'It's amazing, Harry.
Draco blinked at him, not exactly knowing how to answer that. (‘Yes, Potter, the idea of anyone hurting you makes me feel absolutely murderous’? ‘Yes, Potter, in fact I want nothing more than for you to be happy and safe for the rest of your life’? ‘Yes, Potter, did you know that I think you’re perfect and I want to know what it’s like to kiss you’?—As if he’d ever have the nerve to say anything remotely close to the full scope of his own feelings). Instead, he tried to summon his rational side. Best to go the recap route. “You were an abused child. I’m not a complete
‘The Room of Requirement, like many of us,’ Neville replied. Harry exhaled audibly—in relief, immense relief. ‘We’ve been fighting them, doing underground stuff. Draco’s been helping with that—his knowledge of the Dark Arts is a real advantage.’
‘Well, yeah. I’m here … in Ibiza,’ he said lamely, and worried his bottom lip. ‘And I … came to listen to some music …' Potter was not going to believe him. Draco wouldn’t believe himself.
Harry watched him toe on his shoes, grab his keys, and leave again. It was almost as if he were avoiding their inevitable conversation. Harry was a bit hungry for something other than dried berries though, he supposed.
Draco did as Pansy taught him, and selected one of the pictures on the screen. Potter’s face appeared, right up close—that goofy smile again as he adjusted the camera. Draco smiled back at him, tentatively. A different song from the last video started, and Potter backed up, dressed only in little red shorts this time. His legs were quite toned, Draco noted. And again … Potter danced—swinging his arms around the room.
'Are you hungry?' Draco asked, lingering between the bathroom and his bed, not thinking too hard about how they’re similar sizes and definitely not daydreaming about how if they were in a sodding proper relationship they could
They wove through people strolling in the opposite direction, found their way back to the dark alleyway. They stopped in the approximate spot that they’d first appeared from.
(he guessed—he didn’t know much about alpacas, whether they were anything like a herd of sheep—he could look it up in the library later).
Sod it. Why the fuck not, eh? It’s nearly Christmas, and Christmas is for … giving, he supposed. “Okay, I’ll buy it.”
A very-pregnant Hermione was sat at the kitchen table, surrounded by books and parchments, with reading glasses low on her nose and a quill feather in her mouth. Even though she was off work, and due to give birth within the month, Hermione still worked furiously on her case for Vampire rights.
Draco blinked a bit. 'Ah, yes. Forgot about me.' He then pulled his nightshirt up over his head, and flung it aside, then he leant back on the pillow and looked at Harry. The blanket had lowered, revealing an expanse of chest, and half a pink nipple.
He shook his head. “Sweetheart, being with you makes me happy. I don’t need to be attracted to your gender to be happy with you.”
They got up from the table and went their separate ways. Draco found the door that opened up towards the lake. Fresh autumn air hit him like a brick wall, and he breathed it in deep.
.” Then he spun around and marched back to his own table. Granger cast an odd look at Draco, before trailing after her friend.
His imagination strained to conjure up an answer to the mystery. Perhaps this was a special diary for post-war survivors going back to Hogwarts. Maybe he’d dropped an insert somewhere. Somebody could’ve written those entries as examples, he supposed, to show that it was okay to feel different being back. All rather weak explanations—Harry decided not to think on it, and picked up a quill to add his thoughts. To see what might happen.
Desire mounted, near the point of no return—so, Harry broke away, and looked down to try to catch his breath. Because the alternative was looking at Draco’s eyes and his pink lips, and Harry knew he was in danger of never being able to stop snogging.
He trailed in after everyone entering the lobby, and tried to keep a frown off his face. While they all gathered in a circle around Flitwick, Draco hung back and looked around at the simple furnishings—a few plush leather chairs, a crackling fire in a grand stone fireplace, dark hardwood flooring, soft pink walls, and a large front desk where two Muggle employees stood. It was... cosy. Exactly what you’d want a lakeside retreat in the middle of nowhere to be like.
Harry blinked at him, not knowing quite what to say to that. "Oh, er, yeah." He tried to force out a laugh. This was terribly awkward. “Well, congratulations, then,” Harry blurted out, because, that was the correct thing to say, wasn’t it?
Ron came back over to Harry’s side of the kitchen, and threw an arm around Harry’s shoulders. “I just can’t wait for the dust to settle, you know, mate? So that we can have you over at mum and dad’s again soon.”
After his friends left, Harry received a nice reply from Luna via owl, expressing her condolences for the break-up, and inviting him over to a Christmas party at her home. So, there you have it, then. He already had Christmas plans, and in the moment, he felt immensely grateful for all his friends.
Then he admonished himself for starting to feel sorry for himself, again. He didn’t expect to be included, he wasn’t a friend to Potter and clan. Draco had been the only one in their class to get the Mark, after all. He will never expect friendship from them, he doesn’t deserve it.
He walked pretty aimlessly, looking through the odd shop window, to see if something struck him. Maybe something for their flat? Though perhaps that was a bit boring.
‘I think … you don’t have to carry all that anymore. You don’t have to punish yourself over and over. But when you remember, when you feel guilty, you can make a choice again. You can choose every day to be a different person than you were during and before the war.’ Harry hoped he was saying the right thing. He wasn’t at all prepared for this conversation. He meant it, though, everything he was saying.
He led them down a narrow path, single file. Draco hung back, and only started walking once the last person’s (MacMillan’s) back had nearly disappeared through the trees, leaving Draco alone in the clearing for a few blissful seconds. The human voices faded away, leaving forest sounds in their wake.
He lifted his head up, looking Harry in the eye. He looked terribly raw; his eyes bright and near tears. ‘For everything.’ He managed a wobbly smile, and brought a palm up to Harry’s cheek ‘For being here with me, through all of this. I’m so bloody grateful for—you.’ His voice broke on “you”. Draco’s eyes seemed wet.
“Okay.” Harry looked around for a spot that wasn’t in the middle of a crowd. He spotted some bins nearby. “Um, wait … wait over there for a second.”
‘Did you make these blankets yourself?’ Harry wondered out loud, smoothing his fingers over the wool on his lap. The blankets were a little wonky, some areas more tightly knit than others.
'Candid shots are the best ones, don't you think? Otherwise people just smile funny anyway. And it looks forced.'
No sooner had Harry collapsed onto his couch at Grimmauld, did the doorbell ring. He groaned. Who could it possibly be?
And Harry was just standing there, in his tailored suit, looking out at Draco's bedroom with unfocussed eyes.
He watched his former arch-rival gently cradle her jaw, lean down, and kiss the supposed love of his life, to the ringing cheers and claps of the crowd.
‘Doing what I do …' Draco continued, carefully. ‘Can give a startling reality check. Life is …' He shut his eyes. ‘Terribly fragile. And short. There aren’t unlimited opportunities.’ He opened his eyes. ‘I just wanted you to know the truth. It was that simple.’ He sighed. ‘And that complicated.’
Harry swallowed the last bit of what was in his mouth, staring back at Draco. ‘This is weird, isn’t it?’
Draco looked at him, properly now, and smiled. Harry felt a smile grow on his own face. And he just wanted to …
Potter would marry a lovely woman, of course. He’d come home to her every day, planting a kiss on her forehead before tousling the black curly hair of his son. He’d pick up his daughter and twirl her around the room as she giggled. Something altogether normal and wholesome like that anyway.
Malfoy moved a hand in between them, to palm at Harry’s hard, aching cock. Bliss. Pure bliss. He might’ve been shouting.
Ron was sat beside her, leaning forward, rubbing his thumb on Hermione’s shoulder and looking down at Hugo with a soft, fond smile.
'Fine,' Harry said happily. And he dug in. It was a nice vindaloo, if he said so himself. Could be spicier though.
Draco smiled once more, then retreated into the darkness, lifting the Muffliato on the room as he went.
A small smile grew on Draco’s lips as he watched his own fingers work the conditioner out of Harry’s hair.
‘Fuck off, get over yourself.’ And with that, Malfoy stormed off, presumably to get a potion for his face.
Harry took a bite out of his roll. Chewed it, and swallowed. He felt several sets of eyes on him. ‘We’ve … sort of communicated through a magically-linked diary.’ He shrugged. No big deal. ‘It was anonymous at first, that’s how we got to know each other better.’
Harry let him go, and smiled at him. 'Noted.' Cheeky bastard. Harry’s smile faded. ‘Thank you, Draco. For, ah, cheering me up.’
Draco swiped a hand through his hair and looked out the lobby window at the parking lot outside. Potter didn’t want this, Pansy was just... making everything worse.
George, Charlie, and Bill left the room shortly after. ‘Going for a walk,’ Charlie had said to the room.
They drank. It was a nice red wine, but not that Harry was any kind of expert. He leaned back, letting his legs splay out.
“Sorry, it’s just … I hate it there.” He shivered, thinking about the worst date in history: his and Cho Chang’s. The pink. The frills. The tears. “Reminds me of Dolores Umbridge.”
Draco shifted his angle—just so—and opened his mouth a fraction. A soft tongue poked out, just past his lips. Harry met it with his own, just brushing them together lightly.
Harry closed his journal softly, and took a deep breath. That’d all felt significant, somehow. Dense, like he was going to have to unpack it all more slowly. He fell asleep clutching the journal to his chest.
“One man may be the difference between victory and defeat,” said the old bloke with the long beard in the film.
Draco had been right. Of course. Harry suspected Draco was going to be right … a lot of the time. He made his way over, to sink down in the seat beside him, and reached for his hand—which Draco gladly allowed.
There was one of the Weeping Willow, Hagrid's Hut, and then, one of Harry—looking rather exasperated, Draco noted with an aching fondness. Harry had to be fourteen or so, Draco guessed, since Harry'd been a bit more shaggy-haired around the Tri-wizard tournament, and it fit the bill. Draco realised he'd paused a bit too long, and cleared his throat. 'He had quite the eye.' Draco clicked through. The Great Lake. Then a huge, gnarled old tree that must've been deep in the Forbidden Forest, because Draco didn't recognise it. Another photograph of Harry—grim, with darkness under his eyes. Had to be Sixth year, he thought with a pang. That'd been a difficult year.
It was still altogether too hot out, with hardly a cloud in the sky. He felt uncomfortable, and it wasn't just the weather. Nervous, excitable first years were buzzing around him, casting Harry shy, awestruck glances that he was trying to ignore. He tried staring at the train instead.
Draco folded his hands on the table. “I’m in this class as part of my probation, Potter,” he said quietly.
Malfoy held up a palm. “Let me just say it. Please. I’m sorry I hurt you and your friends. I was foolish and proud and cruel and …” He cleared his throat. “And it is inexcusable. The war was a rude awakening. I no longer saw my father’s beliefs as law, nor did I disillusion myself any longer. About Pureblood superiority. About my father’s skewed ideals. About Voldemort’s ...” He sighed heavily. “Well, his everything. I was a fool to ever believe he was anything but sick and depraved and … evil.” He rubbed an invisible speck of dust off the table. He lowered his voice, “I’m sorry it took seeing a professor murdered in front of me to realise it.”
And then in class, he couldn’t concentrate. Sure enough, whenever he looked over at Potter, Potter looked sad. Deflated. Dejected. It made no sense.
Well, Draco took another long sip of wine, then pulled his wand out of his pocket and swished it at his "compact disc" player to stop the Boyz II Men.
A peculiar thing was happening: it was as if the Hufflepuffs were adopting the Slytherins. Their tables in the Great Hall mixed, they walked to classes together. They were even planning a house-warming party for the upper-years on Friday night (the younger years were doing a Saturday afternoon Quidditch match to celebrate).
And the day was lovely—hot and bright. Perfect for swimming, and lounging around in the sand. Perfect for Draco's current energy level—he might even take a beach nap.
And doubly the problem was: he’d seen it before. So he knew what it looked like. He didn’t have to wonder. He knew exactly what Draco kissing Terry Boot looked like.
“It’s not really good for your eyes, you know... watching T.V. in the dark, so close to it like that,” Potter rambled.
But, Blaise and Pansy blew a hole in his door the next morning, and bodily pulled him from his room.
Harry grinned, biting at his lip. Well. That was a surprise. Draco and Astoria might appreciate the jumpers he’d sent, then. It was all in the same vein, though Harry’s gifts were a bit more PG.
Malfoy reached Harry’s desk, and pulled something out of his robe pocket, placing it in front of him. His long, elegant fingers held the note there for a beat, before he kept on walking.
A package dropped down in front of the girl, which she excitedly ripped open to reveal a box of chocolates—probably sent by her mum. Lila waved the box around in front of her friends’ faces, before opening it up, and passing them around to share. Harry smiled a little wistfully.
And then of Malfoy with his nose in a book, as he walked the hallways—somehow able to read and walk simultaneously without running into anything.
Malfoy swiped the pad of his thumb over his bottom lip, observing Harry. “So this co-worker of Ronald Weasley’s ... they didn’t know a restaurant in the UK?”
Harry smiled. ‘I get it. And ... it’s okay.’ He kissed Draco again, a soft peck on the lips. ‘Should we go down to breakfast, then?’
Harry’s mind whirled and his thoughts clashed, as he stared wide-eyed up at the canopy above him. If Snape hadn’t come—and Malfoy had bled out in front of him, with Harry’s body frozen from terror, from guilt … Malfoy would’ve
‘Harry … he couldn’t keep his eyes off you,’ she said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world.
She made him promise to drop it. Astoria had already been through all the tests, all the experimental treatments. It was a curse that'd ran in her family for a long time—so of course they'd already tried everything known to magic and medicine. She said there was truly nothing to be done, and she needed him to accept that. For her sake, for both their sakes.
So Draco washed his hands, then splashed cold water on his face. He looked back at himself—that was a bit better. Merlin, his mouth tasted bad. He cupped his hands on the running water and drank a few handfuls. And finally, he brushed his teeth.
This Hufflepuff party was similar to the last, but probably even more comfortable. They’d all had weeks of inter-house unity, so it didn’t feel at all strange or awkward partying with the Slytherins anymore.
Draco let out a surprised laugh. Fuck it, he was happy. He looked up into Harry’s earnest green ones, and said, “Says the man with absolute emeralds for eyes.”
Harry squinted up at him. With the sun nearly behind his head, it cast a glowing halo around the man’s blond hair. ‘Yeah. Of course.’
Harry squeezed him tighter. “It has. For me, too.” He kissed Draco’s chest. “I’m glad you feel like you can tell me these things. If you... if you feel depressed again, will you talk to me about it?”
“We didn’t know how to talk to each other, we hardly even saw each other anymore. She was always travelling for work, and I was just … left behind.”
Harry put his cup down, and then fiddled with it. “All right. I guess I’ll just come out and say it,” he began.
'Salt is a very good gift. It's Ibiza's most important natural resource, there's a huge salt reserve here.'
‘I know, Snape wasn’t exactly the paragon of child-care. Maybe that’s why it still amuses me. But ... I still wanted to honour him somehow.’ Draco paused to watch someone race past on a wheeled wooden plank. Odd. He cleared his throat. ‘Snape was a mentor to me, as a child, after all. The best one I ever had, I suppose. Anyhow, the Foundation helps impoverished children. Free meals and after-school programs. That sort of thing.’ He chanced a glance at Potter, and found him staring back. Draco blinked rapidly. ‘Er, and there’s one for Squibs. The goal is to reduce stigma. We do presentations, and provide therapy. The depression rates are staggering, sadly.’ Draco took another deep breath, and stuffed his hands into his pockets.
He squeezed his eyes shut, remembering Harry, naked and floating in the water, under a canopy of stars.
Potter looked surprised at that answer, even though he’d been the one barreling through with the accusation. Flustered, the man opened his mouth, closed it, and opened it again. “You fancied me when we were twelve?!”
Draco had on an old-timey night-shirt, the sort you'd see in a Dickens film. It was off-white and went down to nearly his knees.
They tugged at each other’s clothes, sucking in air through their noses and refusing to stop snogging. Draco had Harry topless, and reached for his trousers, loosening the belt and opening up the flies. He pulled down on the lot of them, and Harry lifted up to assist. Draco found himself pushing down his own trousers and pants, kicking them off his feet, and then climbing onto Harry’s bare lap—both of them were completely naked.
Oh. That was a good question. 'I'm not one for horror, I suppose.' He'd lived through enough of that.
He rubbed a hand over his face. “I don’t think we’re happy—I'm not happy. And I’m not sure we really love each other anymore. I mean—I guess we do. In that way you always love family. But it’s … well, I feel a huge distance between us, and I’m not sure I even want to work on it. I think I’m just … fuck I don’t know … tired?”
The girl flashed him a toothy smile. He could see the wad of gum between her teeth. She picked up the box for him, and he followed her, reluctantly, to the cash.
'Colluding with her behind my back, are you,' Draco asked, but not really. He didn't need an answer, he knew they were colluding.
Ron kissed Blaise. Ron’s face turned bright red, while Blaise looked as suave and calm as ever. Hermione cheered.
Ron’s hands dropped. “Ah. We’ve figured out who’s been sending your Malfoy his love letters. I’ve come to see if he wants to press charges.”
“You know women can’t have children too late. The longer you wait, the higher the risk of complications—”
Harry stretched his arms out and back around his head. 'I met him at a club. He came right up to me and started dancing. I didn't really know many people yet. I'd just moved here, and I hadn't yet wandered into Dave's centre to look for a pamphlet.'
Harry had to laugh. “God I don’t know. Going on dates and kissing in public?” He laughed again. Merlin, he was … he didn’t even know. This was all new territory.
Draco’s eyes darted around the courtyard to make sure no one had overheard Pansy’s announcement. Thankfully, his classmates seemed to be engaged in their own conversations, happily chatting with each other.
So, fun fact: Draco says "Ti amo" to Harry while they're in bed together—that means "I love you." Did he mean it? Or was he just repeating Italian phrases he knew? Who can say? ❤️
Harry’s mouth opened a fraction, and he furrowed his brow. Draco felt a mad urge to reach over and smooth away the wrinkles there.
Harry turned his head to look at Draco, and—again—Draco wished he could see Harry's eyes. 'I'd never truly felt taken care of, until him, you know?' Harry sighed. 'Since I'd never had parents, not really, and I'd always felt like I had to be the responsible one in my relationships with women. But Nils made me feel I was safe, like if ever there was a problem he'd know how to solve it. He supported me, in all aspects. He helped me get my first gigs, he encouraged me, he was always there.'
Narcissa pulled back, to give her son a once over, hands gripping tight to his arms. ‘Oh Draco, I’m so thankful.’ She turned to Harry, with tears in her eyes. ‘Mr Potter,
Malfoy didn’t appear to care. He should be mad, he should be shouting at Harry, asking how he could be so
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked. Potter was wide-eyed with a pinched mouth, staring at him. He glanced around—and the lobby was empty. There was a 'be right back' sign on the front desk.
‘Oh, good. I’m glad to hear it.’ He was relieved. He probably should’ve asked about her earlier. ‘It’s pretty bad here, huh? I mean … violent?’
He signed the page, then folded it in three—like Harry would a letter. He glanced at Draco, and found him bent over the page, scribbling away.
Then, they seemed to be traveling upwards and the noise happened again. It opened up. It was the lobby, and Potter stood there looking handsome and grumpy, with a rather stiff posture. So, the usual, then. He stepped on with everyone, eyeing the buttons to make sure Draco had pressed the right one.
Was it so hopeless? Was the rest of Malfoy’s life supposed to be that way—made to suffer and live in fear of retaliation? For something he did as a teenager?
A cup was thrust into his hands. He peered down at it, and brought it closer to his face to take a tentative sniff. Ah—cinnamon. Firewhisky, then.
“Oh,” Harry said, scratching at his jaw. He should shave; in another day he’d go from having stubble to a proper beard. “Well that’s good.”
Draco turned his head to look over his shoulder, smirking at Harry, as his team erupted in cheers and shouts of his name.
“Thank you,” he said to the bird, yanking open the sticky top drawer of the desk, rattling the whole thing and making the owl jump and hoot in annoyance. “Sorry,” Harry added, now rummaging around for his little box of oil treats. His fingers passed over snapped quills and bottles of ink, pencils and paperclips until he found it. He tossed a treat to the owl, who caught it easily in its beak.
'What should we do today?' Draco swiped a ripped-off chunk of naan over the plate, to soak up some juices, and took a big bite.
Malfoy tossed his broom to the grass, and swept all of his hair over one shoulder. His nimble fingers made quick work of plaiting it, and securing it at the end with an elastic he’d had around his wrist. Effortless. Like he’d done it a hundred times before.
He took a few steps closer, and checked that the tea was exactly the shade of brown that he preferred—and it was.
Draco had always liked old things—from Hogwarts itself to ancient old books in his father's library, to mysterious artifacts in shops like Borgin and Burkes. Something about … old knowledge, old ways of life. It was fascinating, just learning and imagining how others might’ve lived.
Then, over a few sets of shoulders, Harry spotted Draco. He stood a distance away, eyes wide and holding a book open in one hand, as if he had been reading before unconsciously standing, forgetting all about the book he held up.
'All right.' Draco leant over and picked up a small rectangular package, wrapped in a candy cane pattern. 'This?'
Harry laughed. ‘What? Him?’ That couldn’t be embarrassment. Embarrassment was blushing and fumbling over words and lack of eye contact. Malfoy had been seething and cruel. As usual, Harry supposed.
And then there they were—back at the first true home Harry had ever known. It even smelled the same (but did he expect any different?). They all settled into the Great Hall, taking up their usual seats at their usual tables. The Sorting Ceremony proceeded as it always had—with so many new, bright-eyed faces. They were young and hopeful and excited to learn about magic. It was … nostalgic. And nice.
Malfoy’s eyebrows had raised as he observed the garments. Tentatively, he grabbed for the hot pink and white one. “What’s this all about?”
It was far too early to read something from Draco Malfoy, so he tossed the letter aside and climbed back into bed, shutting his eyes.
‘Yeah. You know when you want something for so long? So long you’re convinced it’s impossible?’ Draco said with a slight smile, looking down at Harry’s lips.
He kept an unhurried pace, with hands shoved deep in his jean pockets, just letting his eyes wander. His mind felt very still.
Harry looked around, his eye caught on a miniature Quidditch player, flying loops around the wardrobe. He shrugged, and met Draco’s eyes. ‘I just do.’
The owl looked back at him disapprovingly. He could laugh—it was an expression he could imagine on Malfoy’s face. Malfoy. Urgh. Well, Harry was going to have to face the music, and see what Malfoy had to say about his ridiculous and not-well-thought-out-at-all gift.
Draco pushed himself up, and crawled up a fraction to lean over Harry, with hair in absolute disarray. Harry lifted his fingers up to run through the soft, slighty-frizzy strands.
occurred to him, yes. He’d even spoken to his Mind Healer about it. But, ultimately, it was probably wiser to focus on his mental health first, and put everything else on the backburner.
‘Is that a problem? If it makes you uncomfortable … I mean it’s not like I’d do anything untowards or anything, but it’s fine if you want to get changed in the bathroom—’
By the time he got to the Astronomy Tower, Harry was rather cold. He was only dressed in an old, faded grey t-shirt, and blue, plaid pyjama bottoms. He’d neglected to bring his wand, so crossing his arms over his chest had to suffice.
He ate in silence, thankfully the elderly couple didn’t try to strike up any more conversation. He tried to keep his thoughts away from self-pity, away from loneliness. Thinking about going outside again cheered him up a bit.
Harry watched Malfoy’s face, watched how it twisted, how he bit at his lip, forcing himself to look at Harry, instead of throwing his head back in ecstasy.
Harry's breaths sped up, but not enough oxygen was getting into his lungs. He reached out for the wall with shaky fingers, to steady himself.
Putting his fork down after just a few bites, Draco said, “It was easy to believe what my father had raised me to believe.”
‘In these last weeks, we’ve made preparations for an experiment. One I hope that will help unify us, and stop this violence.’
Harry gave his head a shake. He needed to forget it. Forget Draco Malfoy, and forget a kiss that was only for a spell and nothing else.
They rode each other’s orgasms out, sucking softer and softer, as their cocks got softer and softer.
Harry woke on Christmas morning with his chest flush against Draco's back, and an arm wrapped around him, with palm flat against Draco's heart. He tightened his grip some, as he inhaled Draco's scent, nuzzling his nose into Draco's messy hair. This was one his favourite things now—waking up in Draco's bed.
Draco snatched it up, and read, muttering under his breath, ‘Light a favourite scented candle, meditate, take a long bath.’ He frowned, then shot Harry a pained look. 'Write a love letter to yourself?'
Astoria straightened up. “Well, I’m going to go back and talk to the Muggles—I've been learning a lot about what they call ‘pop culture’. Nice meeting you properly, Harry.”
‘But … as you can see, I didn’t die in the end. And when I became conscious, all I could think was …' he sucked in a breath, steeling himself for what he was about to say. ‘All I could think … was that I’d never told you.’
A raised eyebrow. ‘Yeah? Are you referring to your sordid past of being the worst Death Eater to ever ...’ He waved a hand in the air. ‘... “death eat”?’
weird. Who knew a normal conversation with Malfoy was possible—without making you want to punch his smug mouth even once.”
“Happy Christmas.” He shot her a forced smile again, grabbed his bag, and walked right out of there.
They clinked their little glasses, and said a round of "salud". Draco downed his, and found it tasted pleasantly of coconut, and didn't seem too boozy at all. It was nice.
Neville visibly startled. He placed his book down and regarded Harry with wide-eyes. ‘Draco Malfoy,’ he echoed. ‘Merlin … I haven’t thought about him in years.’
Draco shook his head to clear it, and, stubbornly ignoring any further thought on the matter, he read the next part.
“Sorry if I startled you, I didn’t want to wake Rose.” He exhaled in a puff. “Again … I should’ve Floo-called first.”
Draco let his fingertips trail against an old white wall—how many others had done the same, over the centuries?
Pansy rose to her feet. ‘Wait here.’ An enormous grin took up half her face. ‘You’re gonna fucking love this.’
She paused, and turned to him. She smiled when she saw what he was looking at. “You can meet me at the desk over there, when you’re ready.”
He stormed out, and tears were falling even before he opened his door. He shut the door behind him and locked it with every spell he knew. Then he slunk to the ground and buried his face in his hands. He hadn’t cried in a long, long while. It actually felt … a little therapeutic. If only he didn’t have to avoid human interaction for the rest of his life …
A tiny, mixed-ethnicity, First Year Hufflepuff with a mountain of black hair and giant brown eyes, was carefully peeling stickers off a wax sheet, and sticking them on to Draco Malfoy’s skin. On his left forearm. Over his Dark Mark.
Ron huffed and mumbled under his breath, “We already bloody well did.” Then, louder, “Whatever. Come on Harry, I’ve had enough of looking at this waste of space.”
He wolfed the rest of his egg/sausage butty—or whatever it was Harry called it—down. 'Must we have a serious conversation right now?'
Potter looked almost amused. ‘You saved me, in the Manor then. You’re good, and you’re brave. You’re smart, and rather sassy. And ... you've got a fine arse.’
He dragged his suitcase over to the lift she’d indicated. It had two buttons on the silver panel, one a triangle with the point at the top, the other with the point at the bottom.
He nodded. ‘So it’s decided then. Should I show you Doctor Who? You can see what you’ve been missing? Or is there a certain genre you’d rather, besides science fiction?’
She put a hand, gently on his arm. He stared at it like it was something alien, unrecognizable. No, no, no.
“And even if you were to like him, you know that I know that you’re … that word we aren’t saying yet. We may not have the most conventional of marriages, you and I, but I want to support you.”
.’ She pointed a finger at him. ‘You need a change of location, Draco. Fresh air. Sunlight. New perspective. You’re cooped up alone too much, and when you aren’t, you’ve only me or Morgan for company.’
It wasn’t really the light-hearted story Malfoy had made it out to be, then. He’d censored it earlier … in order to make Harry feel better.
‘That’s fantastic,’ Harry said breathily, feeling warmth spread in his chest (and it wasn’t the liquor). He was proud.
Harry could only look at Malfoy’s face—watching its subtle movements, the quirk of his mouth as he spoke, the darting around of his eyes—darting from Harry’s face to around the library and back. A freckle underneath his left eye. The arching of an eyebrow.
Draco blinked rapidly, and a laugh burst out of him. Short and breathy. Potter’s words … made his chest warm. ‘Regret not taking my hand that first day, now, eh Potter?’
So Harry pulled out a book from his bag, and tried to read. It was called “Trust After Trauma: A Guide to Relationships for Survivors and Those Who Love Them” by Aphrodite Matsakis. His Mind Healer had gotten it for him, and it was pretty good so far. It helped to be reminded that he wasn’t the only one in the world feeling like he did.
And on the way home, he stopped in at the shop for a few packs of Ambrosia chocolate custard. He was going to lie on his sofa in his pants and eat pots of custard as the wireless read a story to him.
Purely on reflex, he caught the collar of a Fifth Year Gryffindor right while the boy tried to run off.
Harry looked around, at the nearly empty front room—save for an upright piano, a couple armchairs, and, one Draco Malfoy just standing there in the middle of the room with a drink in his hand—wearing a deer-in-headlights look on his face. And Draco was dressed in Harry’s Christmas jumper … the
“Oh! Hey mate,” said Ron, flashing him a grin over his shoulder. “I’d hug you but the sauce might bubble over.”
He looked down at his own nearly empty cup and sighed. It’d be an excuse. A perfectly normal excuse to just... to just... Well, it was only a drink.
But Potter’s expression was blank. He held a small bouquet of leaves in one hand and was twirling it between his fingers.
Potter’s perplexed expression became something different. Softer, maybe. But still unsure. ‘Well …' he started. Potter glanced around himself for the first time since he’d spotted Draco. He watched a small group of partygoers laughing several metres away. He swallowed. ‘I am all right.’
Harry took his mug out to the living room, where his sofa, telly, and blanket were waiting for him. He plopped down onto it, spilling a little coffee onto his blanket, and turned on the telly.
They lay in bed in one another's arms for a long while, and kissed some more. Then, when how hot and sticky they were became rather uncomfortable, it was time for a shower. A relatively chaste shower, that is; with only a few kisses.
He stopped in his tracks to stare at her. “What?” he asked, shifting his weight from toes to heels and back. That didn’t work—he went back to pacing.
He squeezed his eyes shut. And tried not to think about the fact that Draco was currently putting his mouth on Terry Boot’s mouth out there. But that’s the problem with trying
Harry found himself looking at the diary, as his mind replayed what he’d just read. ‘I’m in 4th year,’ he murmured. Merlin … just imagining Draco Malfoy cutting in on him and Parvati, and wanting to dance with
The water washed over him, through him, all of him. And admittedly, being naked felt free. Felt natural—like he was a part of nature, same as a bird (or rather a fish, he supposed).
On the third day of classes, Harry was by himself, on the way to Potions, and happened upon a nasty scorch mark on the wall.
A beat played, and Harry bobbed his head in time as he shimmied backwards to get his entire body in the frame. Grey t-shirt and those rather-small red shorts.
The owl tried to nip at his bagel. “I don’t think bread is good for birds,” Harry mumbled. “I think I read somewhere it puffs up in your stomach, gives you terrible stomach cramps.”
They stepped out of the shower, and Draco handed him a big, fluffy purple towel, and grabbed an orange one for himself from the cupboard.
Pansy put a hand on Draco's shoulder, and looked at him fondly. 'Seems you had a really lovely time.'
He sniffled, nodding, with a huge lump in his throat. Draco threw an arm over his shoulders and pulled him in to a hug.
Then the Hamsters came out, in their hot pink kits. Malfoy cheered along for them, throwing Harry a smile at the end.
She stood up as he approached, and took a few steps forward to hug him. Harry squeezed back, burying his face in her clean-smelling bushy hair. It felt fantastic to hug her—he'd really needed one.
‘Hello,’ Draco said, stepping up next to him, eyeing the fish. A yellow and blue striped one swam past Harry’s face.
, surely? But … Harry wasn’t sure he should allow himself to hope. Maybe continuing the fantasy was just the easiest thing to think of in the moment.
The song winded down to that weird talking part that made no sense to Draco. Something about an ocean and a gift.
Draco smiled to himself. Potter deserved a happy life. An infinitely happier one than he’d started out with.
She handed him his receipt and his bag with a smile. “Thank you for shopping with us. Happy Christmas.”
The corner of Draco’s mouth turned up a bit. ‘All right.’ He turned his gaze to the two journals in front of himself and produced his wand from a pocket.
'It's alright, I’ve got it’, Malfoy said, and reached over the side of the sofa to fish around for his wand in his trouser pocket. He waved it over them, and they were clean. He sank back into Harry, leaning his forehead against Harry’s neck.
. Felt like I was doing something for the greater good.’ Draco smiled softly. ‘The others came to, well, trust me. At least, I hope.’ He exhaled. ‘That was …'
Harry pursed his lips, and resisted looking at Draco—to see if he’d react negatively to seeing Terry Boot kiss someone else.
He ate his cereal over the sink, crunching messily with milk spurting out into his growing beard. He stared out the window, at the deserted snowy streets out there. Everybody else in London was with people they loved. Families. Friends. And Harry was terribly alone. It felt a bit like a return to his childhood Christmases, where everything was awful, and he just wanted to get the day over with.
She nodded very slightly. 'I thought you might need another, for when you've used up all the pages in your first.'
‘Did you bring it with you?’ she asked, sitting up straighter in her chair, looking around to see if there were just a diary laying around, perhaps near his shoes.
Harry bit his lip. Truthfully, he normally wore just pants and a t-shirt. He liked his legs free. But in this situation, that’d probably be awkward. ‘T-shirt and bottoms would be great.’
‘I … do. What brings you …' he trailed off, looking over her shoulder to see if anyone had come in with her—but the entranceway was empty.
With one eye, he watched Harry rise to his feet and pull of his t-shirt, tossing it aside. Harry squinted out at the water, and pushed down his shorts and pants in one easy swoop.
Malfoy’s chest heaved, as his movements slowed. He looked at Harry, his face relaxed, his expression a bit awed. He released Harry’s hair, and Harry popped off Malfoy’s softening cock.
‘I’m me?’ Harry loved the silvery, shining grey of Draco’s eyes ... his soft-looking eyelashes ... the length of his nose.
Malfoy bit his lip, and nodded. With a second hand in Harry’s hair, he started thrusting up—slowly at first. Harry relaxed his throat, timed his breathing, as Malfoy simultaneously thrusted up with his hips and pulled Harry’s head down by the hair.
Ginny sighed heavily, preventing a rare chance at conversation, and leaned to whisper in his ear, “We’ve eaten. Can we go?”
Harry rubbed a thumb over the condensation of his glass, making a streak. “Er, I’m just curious but … what would’ve happened if I’d dropped my hand from your shoulder during that spell?”
And Harry’s implication that there was anything akin to similar between his son’s rambling about Albus, and Draco’s about Harry, made his chest ache. Perhaps if he hadn’t been such a little … Draco took a breath. It didn’t matter. It didn’t do to dwell on what could’ve been—things like: if only there hadn’t been a Voldemort, if only his parents hadn’t raised him to be so … if only he hadn’t been so afraid of his own feelings ...
The stadium was about a quarter full, and significantly quieter, when Malfoy turned to face Harry head on. “Fuck it. Fuck it—
Exhaling hard out of his nose, Draco finally relented, 'All right.' He grabbed his own piece of parchment, a quill, and stared down at the paper with a frown.
'Ah. I see. Well … not many flowers are green, are they? Their flower petals, I mean. But I guess you get it in all the stems and leaves.'
Well, the skin around them changed. Older, more weathered, with crow's feet—which merely meant that Harry had laughed a lot. Harry had lines around his mouth too, and two between his eyebrows. Smiles. Deep thinking, concern. Parts of his life were written right there on his face, and … and time had only made him more ruggedly handsome.
It had been a heavier question than Harry had thought. Harry absorbed that information … he could imagine, yeah. And he hated it. Draco had been cleared of all charges. But people had long memories, and to some, a Death Eater was always going to be a Death Eater. Even if they’d only been a kid.
'He does seem all right,' Draco said tentatively, turning to look at Harry's back, slumped forward against the bar.
He shifted his weight onto the other leg. This was a bit awkward. Yeah, Hermione was normally quite clever, even perceptive, yes. But Harry couldn't possibly see how a few letters and one single evening of conversation lead to these conclusions. She didn't know about how he sort-of longed for ...
“Ah, good.” Draco untied the parchment from Robespierre’s leg, and tossed him a treat. “That’ll be it for the night, you can do what you like.”
She liked to remind him with little hints from time to time that he couldn’t trust Malfoy (‘Remember when Malfoy dressed as a Dementor to frighten you?’), and Harry could admit to himself that there was a chance, a small chance that she was right, that Malfoy was still dangerous. But all he had to do was remember that nod, that little smile, or Malfoy crying on the bed, or his foot against Harry’s leg, and those doubts got blurry.
Fred and George had certainly sung it enough to cement the words in Harry’s mind. He sighed, and recited: “His eyes are as green as fresh pickled toad.”
. And I pushed you too hard, asking things I shouldn’t have asked. Things that are none of my business.”
It was a lot of people. Harry recognised a lot of Fred’s friends and family, and people from school. Lots of people he didn’t know, too. Some stood around in their robes, looking awkward like they didn’t quite know what to do—wasn't this a funeral? Aren’t they supposed to be reserved, be sad? Some really were sad, of course—still deep in their own mourning. And that was okay, too.
Draco groaned, and rubbed his face. He’d meant to think of Quidditch. Even when he was trying to think good things, the bad things kept popping up.
“They’re fine," he said, with a tone that suggested otherwise. "Except they always smell awful and they’re not all that soft.”
A chair was hurriedly pushed back. And flash of movement caught Harry’s eye. It was Malfoy, rushing off around the table and bounding towards the doors.
And Draco’s self-worth was hanging by a thread as it was. He was not going to be able to survive a weak of ridicule, of fighting with Potter. He’d deserve it, of course, but he certainly wasn’t in a good place for it right now.
Malfoy blinked in surprise. Then, the edge of Malfoy’s mouth quirked up, but it wasn’t quite a smile. ‘I wouldn’t ask you ...’ he quietly started to say, before furrowing his brow, as if confused by his own words.
He stared at the ripples in the lake water in the hopes of quieting his mind, he ran his hands over the rough wood of the dock. He focused on the lapping of the water, focused on the whispering breeze, the fresh smells. He felt a bit cold, he noticed with a start. Cold was good, cold was distracting.
“Sorry,” Potter continued, rubbing his palms against his jeans again. “I don’t know how serious you were about that—It’s just... talk like that worries me.”
Ah. Probably because he was very angry, or... thought Draco might attack him or something. It’d make sense to assume the worst of Draco, since … well, his
He can’t have lunch with Harry Potter. His face might still be red and blotchy from crying. “I’m not hungry.”
Ron just blinked at him, and started to shake his head slowly. Harry thought he might start to protest or chastise him, but Ron clapped him on the shoulder and said, 'Well, that’s great. We just want to see you happy, yeah?'
Harry stood there for a moment, not quite knowing what to do with himself. He was hungry and thirsty though, and, could use a piss. He walked the length of the room, to a short hallway on the far side that led to a door with a deadbolt—must be the entrance, then. There was also a door to his left he could push open—revealing the loo as he did. So, Harry used it, and was grateful that Draco hadn’t been around to have to ask him where it was or for permission or some other awkwardness.
Hook-in-the-gut. They landed, kissing, and as usual, Harry toppled over. This time, Malfoy just let it happen, toppling with him, down to the floor on top of him. Pausing their snogging only so that their teeth didn’t bang together when they hit the floor. Once settled, Malfoy resumed their make-out session.
‘Muggle healthcare fascinated me … and I found that I was skilled at it. So, it took many years, but I became a doctor, specialising in emergency medicine. I earned my position on my own merit, with my own hard work. My family, and my blood status had nothing to do with it. And that was immensely satisfying.’
It wasn’t really a big deal, but something about Draco looking up onions in the library, because their weekend together
When he got to the 8th year common room, it seemed more crowded than usual. Pansy spotted him immediately and shoved him into the corner by the window, where they couldn’t be overheard.
Draco just wanted to get 8th year over with. He’ll get his NEWTs, and then never have to look back. Maybe he’ll even move
So, Draco changed into a pair of navy joggers and a white t-shirt, grabbed the paperback on his night stand, and relocated to the living room sofa.
When he came out as gay to his parents, he’d been kicked out. Just like that ... Draco had heard Muggles had prejudices, but he didn’t think it’d be for something as ridiculous as being attracted to someone with the same contents under their pants.
After towelling off, he frowned at his closet. Board meeting. Suits. Discussions of projections, performance, sodding
He uncovered his face, and checked to see if the ghost was still there. She was. Smiling at him, pointing at the page.
‘Fine! Is this what you want to hear?! Yes, I love you. I really fucking love you, alright? And I have for
“Telling him how I really feel, as foolish as my feelings are, would only make him laugh. Or hit me.
Neville took out a novel and began reading silently, peeking up at Harry through his eyelashes from time to time.
Harry shuffled in his seat, to face Draco on an angle, and reached for Draco’s tie. Draco did the same, taking a strange pleasure in un-Gryffindor-ising Harry.
"Bit of a party last night,” said his wife (presumably), leaning closer to him. “We heard music into the wee hours.”
‘Thanks,’ he said, wiping his eyes with the back of a hand. ‘It seems like all we do is cry around each other.’
Madam Pomfrey was soon ready with the potions, and Harry watched as Malfoy knocked each of them back with a wrinkled nose. Harry looked away quickly. It was rude to stare.
'He has your mobile number? Good. He'll ring if he wants to,' Draco continued, not pausing for a response.
And then Malfoy came soon after, inside of him—his face scrunched up and his mouth in an ‘o’, without making a sound.
After taking a breath, Malfoy leaned forward and propped up his chin, with elbow on the table. “Well what do you feel like? Pizza? Pasta? A meat of some sort?” He paused, just staring at Harry. The corner of his mouth lifted as he over-emphasized, “Perhaps
the time. Did he have a new group of friends? Did he have a girlfriend … or maybe a wife? He’ll have to take a closer look at Potter’s left hand next time.
Malfoy dropped the menu altogether. “You’re telling me … that during all these years, you’ve had the means, but no reason to, until right now?”
A squeak brought Harry out of the kiss. He pulled back and looked for the source of the sound: Neville stood a couple metres away, staring at them with wide-eyes.
Maybe he should try to think about … But thinking about someone or something other than his wife seemed a violation.
She stood between his knees and lent down to kiss him. Her fingers went back to undressing him, pushing all the layers off of him—not minding where they ended up.
Chapter warning: sex! (this is where the 'underage' warning comes in, since they are almost 18 but not quite)
Harry was at work, yawning at his desk, when Draco’s owl arrived, landing in front of him and upending a few papers.
Draco hyper-focused on the fire in front of them, but the steady rise and fall of Potter’s body against him was very difficult to ignore.
‘I can’t piece it all together,’ Harry continued. ‘I can’t. It’s too much for me. Fuck, it’s too much for me …’
Draco stirred, and shifted slowly onto his back within Harry's arms. 'Mm,' he uttered without opening his eyes. A hand came up to clumsily guide Harry's head toward him for a kiss.
She smiled warmly at him, and tapped at his cheek, before swirling away back to the bloke with the beard near the drinks table without another word.
As they neared, no one turned to stare at him. No one seemed bothered at all by his presence. Well, not yet, anyway. It was still early to truly assess.
The bed dipped as he sat, and he heard Malfoy suck in a shaky breath. Harry faced the blank wall behind Malfoy’s headboard, unsure of what to do, but knowing that he couldn’t just leave.
A pause. Then, Draco picked up a purple rock, and turned it around in his hand. “Always wanted to be your friend, didn’t I?”
Pausing again, this time Malfoy searched his eyes. “Do you want to wait? We can wait if you want to wait.”
'I'm so sorry, I asked you to talk and, well, I've been texting Ron and Hermione while you were out. And I really think I need to have a chat in person with them. They're leaving for Romania in a couple days, and are swamped with preparations tomorrow. Ron's got to secure the Portkey still, and ...'
The crisp air hit Harry, and it was like he’d just woken up. The world seemed brighter now. He breathed in the air, let it fill his lungs. He hadn’t realised how hot and stuffy he’d felt.
'So, Draco, what was Evan like in school?' Dave asked with a grin, before taking a sip from his red drink. Cranberry juice, perhaps.
, and Harry’s cock in his was so... erotic. Exciting. Delicious. Draco tried to find a rhythm, but everything was so much—just so much. All at once.
Harry’s arm was grabbed, and tugged roughly. He and Malfoy both turned to look, finding Ginny there, looking impatient.
The door to the loo opened, and Draco stepped out—fully dressed in black tailored slacks, a sky blue-coloured button-down, and … striped socks. He looked dressed up (minus the socked feet). He looked … nice.
“Hmm,” Ginny said, sounding thoughtful, and turning the invitation over in her hand. “It’s a winter wedding. Should we go?”
Harry felt his pulse quicken, as he looked at Draco—noticing the man’s stiffened posture. ‘If what?’
Draco laughed. 'Red for you, green for me. How absolutely boring. It's like we can't see past our house placement.'
‘I’m not giving up. This is something I have to do—’ Harry said, trying to back away. His eyes pleading with Draco to stop, to not make it any harder than it has to be ...
In the dining room, none of his classmates had come down yet, so he settled into a table near an elderly couple.
to spend time with him, even if ‘spend time’ just meant sleeping in the same room. He was just feeling sorry for himself, he realised. When,
Harry paused his spice grinding. 'Oh,' he breathed out, and looked around the flat automatically, as if picturing it. 'That'd be really nice.'
Draco broke away, and laughed, dropping his head down against Harry's neck. His nose brushed against Harry's collarbone.
Angelpreet clapped her hands together. 'Yes, well. We'll find there are many benefits to the computer age. Instant communication for one, photographs of grandkids for another,' she said, eyeing Bert pointedly with a warm smile. 'And not to mention the environmental aspect.'
Harry pulled off his old shirt, and changed into the new one. ‘No, I’m not.’ Then he took his wand out of his jean pocket and did a teeth-cleaning charm. Lastly, off went his trousers and socks in a quick motion.
‘Oh …' Well, he wouldn’t’ve. It hadn’t even occurred to him; Potter was clearly happier here. Right in his element, in Draco’s opinion.
-perfect. No one is, I suppose. But you’re...” Oh Merlin, what was he saying? Draco sighed. “Do you know why we’re rooming together?”
“You wouldn’t’ve,” Draco added, adjusting his napkin so that it lined up parallel with the edge of the table. “You would’ve been able to do something.”
‘Oh, no. He’s quite determined to forget you exist.’ She leaned forward and whispered conspiratorially, ‘He’s hiding in bed under a pile of blankets.’
Instead, he decided he’d better reassure Potter. “I... I won’t disappear.” He winced at his response. It didn’t seem enough. “Thank you,” he added quietly.
'I did it for him,' Draco admitted through gritted teeth, as he very much did not look at Harry. He didn't want him to think he preferred … Merlin ... not that there was anything inherently
Harry moved it out of reach again. He was dazed. None of this made any sense at all. He turned to Malfoy, wide-eyed. Malfoy froze at seeing Harry’s face. Understanding was beginning to dawn on the both of them.
Work was just so slow, with the switch over to computers—he had nothing to distract himself with. He was going a bit loopy, just staying in his flat all the time.
The pub was loud, dark, dingey, and Ginny’s teammates especially drunk and raucous. Harry kept finding himself watching Ginny, thinking. Searching for something, for some answers there. He was trying to reach down deep, to figure out if that same love he used to feel was lying dormant someplace inside of him. If perhaps he could coax it out again, and mend what's been lost.
Draco Malfoy was in front of him at last. He seemed older, but, in a good way … like: mature. Like … a proper man, now.
Draco felt a smile growing on his lips, Harry was just so... endearingly enthusiastic. And he remembered that? That one insignificant sentence from that first meal together? “I do.”
He’d graduate Hogwarts. He’d likely be recruited into Auror training straight away. And he’d become the world’s best Auror, no doubt. He’d keep on saving lives, righting wrongs, and capturing bad people. People like Draco and his family had been.
Potter’s hands turned into fists on his lap. “I’ve noticed... you know? I’ve noticed you’re different.” He took in a slow breath. “You keep to yourself. You just go to classes and meals. And I see your friends... like Pansy, she looks at you in the Great Hall, when you're not noticing. She looks at you like she might be worried. It’s sort of hard to tell with her... but, yeah. She seems worried about you.” Potter unclenched his fists, rubbing his hands against his jeans again. “You’re quieter. You look like you’re alone, even if you’re with people. And that... that worries me too.”
Before long, quiet, soft kisses evolved into all-out making out. Tongues and wet smacking noises and all. Harry tried to keep his eyes averted, and wished he had a discman right then, even though it would be rendered useless once within Hogwarts’ walls.
‘I’m not sure this is good for mental health,’ Draco said through gritted teeth. He had sweat on his brow.
Harry rolled his eyes, and cast a Muffliato on the table. He eyed the book in front of Malfoy. ‘What are you studying?’
Harry’s heartrate had sped up, and he felt a confusing mixture of emotion—resignation, dread, fear, uncertainty ... but also a niggling feeling that his suspicions could be correct.
It was worse than he thought. Potter didn’t even react, he just looked at Draco. It was like Draco was nothing, less than nothing, the dirt he walked on sort-of-nothing. No smile, no laugh, no eyebrow-raise, no surprise, no scorn, no nothing. Draco was so inconsequential to Potter that he wasn’t even worth a reaction? No, that would be a waste of energy.
Harry looked down at them, as if he was only just noticing the mess they’d made. “Ah. Tissues then.” He propped up an elbow on the bed to leverage himself up into a standing position. His softening cock just hung there, over top his pushed-down boxer-briefs.
Draco began to stroke Harry, in wild, feverish motions, as they kissed—open-mouthed, wet, messily—and Harry’s free hand found Draco’s nipple. He pinched it between thumb and finger, making Draco gasp into his mouth.
had kissed Terry Boot and Hermione and who knows who else (not Harry, anyway), before he’d gone back to his dorm and chatted into the small hours with
Draco huffed a short laugh. 'No, I do not think he's interested in me. Harry very clearly told me that he's not looking for a relationship right now. He'd just gone through a terrible break-up and I imagine it'll be a while before he's ready to date anyone again.'
Draco continued, ‘For the record, I never wanted to tell you any of this. I never thought I’d see you again. I had only wanted to give you the diary so you’d know the truth, and then … I’d move on.’
. To explore this new world only recently opened up to him … He’s alive—they're here together—and Voldemort is dead. Harry should be able to fuck a bloke, if he wants (and if Draco wants, of course).
Harry pushed Malfoy over, into a lying position on the sofa. And Harry went down with him—kissing him all the while.
‘Let me,’ Malfoy said. He grabbed the bottle, and poured a generous amount onto one hand. He dropped the lube onto the floor, and rubbed his palms together. Then he reached his right hand out for Harry’s cock, and his left hand for his own arse, lifting his knees up to ease his access.
Okay. That was something, at least. Draco was right … this was all very fast and kind of alarming. But the idea of stepping back into his quiet life, as if nothing had happened, would be so much harder to bear.
Ron shrugged, smiling. “All right Harry, I’m just yanking your chain.” Harry’s eyebrows lifted. “I’m sure you know what you’re doing.”
Harry thought he understood anyway, and bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. ‘I kind of wish I’d been there.’
Harry didn’t know what for, but obeyed anyway. Then, Draco flitted his hand between Harry’s legs and pressed a lube-slicked finger against his arsehole.
Draco was watching him with his head resting on a hand. He shrugged—a quick upward motion of his shoulders without lifting his head from his hand. ‘It’s nice having you do all the work.’ A lazy smile grew on his mouth.
Harry didn’t see anything at first, until a bit of white moved. Ah. White cat on white fluffy blanket.
But he’d gone over most of that—he’d spoken about his fears at length with his Mind Healer Moira. He’d done exercises. He’d learnt coping mechanisms. And it was all somewhat more bearable these days.
Draco took his first bite. Pan con tomate, it was called. Bright red crushed tomato pulp, fresh baked bread toasted crisp on the outside, warm and soft on the inside. Wholly delicious, and not too heavy.
Draco sighed, and, chose to admit, “Yes.” Because he loved her, and she might’ve helped him get Harry for a boyfriend.
‘And I …’ Draco didn’t even bother to look at what Harry was seeing. ‘And I would do anything to see you happy.’
He swallowed, and sighed. “It’s not just Malfoy. I’m comparing myself to you and Ron, to Neville and Hannah, to Mr and Mrs Weasley … Ginny and I aren’t at all like that.”
“I didn’t know what the spell did. I can’t believe I hurt you like that, I could’ve—” Malfoy held up his palm, and Harry clamped his mouth shut.
They entered the next room, which turned out to be a larger living room, with a variety of mismatched sofas and armchairs, arranged in the rough estimate of a circle. On one end was a table with a variety of differently shaped, coloured bottles, along with a tray of what Harry could only guess was supposed to be hors d’oeuvres.
Thinking about Harry Potter was an escape. A distraction from his barely tolerable, mundane existence. Post-war Hogwarts hadn’t been easy for a former Death Eater. Draco knew, full-well, that he’d been a fool to follow his father’s teachings so blindly, never questioning them, and now he had to live with all the mistakes he’d made—the mess he’d made of his life.
He straightened in his seat. The envelope was cursed to explode when opened. He tossed it down, and picked up a big green envelope instead. This one wasn’t cursed, as far his spells could tell (and he was quite good at them). So, Harry swiped at it with his sword-shaped letter opener, and pulled out the parchment to read.
From the Professor’s table, Harry gaze flitted over the birds to the four long student tables outstretched in front of him, and his sight caught on one of his favourite students, Lila. The 2nd year was blond, sharp as a whip, and, Slytherin.
Laughing, Draco shook his head. ‘I can’t do that.’ He licked his lips, and his expression turned serious. ‘I’ll …’
These “anytimes”, these “nexts” ... It was all just saying what you have to say, in order to make a goodbye easier, wasn’t it?
Draco’s heart lurched a bit when Harry’s package arrived. It was big. He’s sent a Christmas present, Draco thought. Even though he didn’t have to—as Draco had told him not to. The fact that he had anyway, well, it … it warmed him.
Harry opened the door hesitantly, and closed it softly behind himself. He took one quick step forward, then stopped. 'I'm so sorry.'
Harry snorted. 'A couple hours—dough has to rise a bit.' And, at the look on Draco's face, Harry added with a roll of his eyes, 'Have a biscuit in the meantime.'
‘My man …’ Harry echoed. Then he turned to her, paying attention now. ‘He’s not my …' He felt himself start to blush and clamped his mouth shut. He was ridiculous, he couldn't even say it.
Ginny followed, arranging the skirt of her robes around her, smoothing it out with her hands. Harry inhaled deeply.
A muscle in Harry’s jaw tensed. He rubbed at it, absentmindedly. Was he just jealous? Because Malfoy had something Harry didn’t—something Harry was finding he wanted more than anything. A real partner … someone to really love.
It probably didn’t bear thinking about Potter being kept in a cupboard instead of a bedroom, either. But Draco couldn’t get that visual out of his mind.
He slipped out of bed as silently as he could, with a fist over his crotch, and beelined for his dresser to pull out random trousers, pants, and a shirt. Then he hurried to the bathroom, shutting the door quietly behind him.
“Yeah … we drank some of Luna’s mystery alcohol, we met her cat, we stood in the backyard a bit and chatted. It was nice.”
And then Harry was coming, in hot bitter bursts into Draco’s mouth. And Draco swallowed it as it came, lapping at it with abandon, just as he came into Harry’s mouth.
Molly pulled back and looked at Draco, sniffling. ‘Oh of course, you’re very welcome to stay with us dear.’
She smiled warmly. ‘Well, we’re done a touch early. But you can send your friend in, if he’s ready.’
He gasped for breath, and the crying eased up. Deeper breaths—he was fine. He actually felt a bit better. A bit lighter.
Once inside, Draco was transported back to Ibiza in an instance. It was terribly dark, and crowded, with neon lights flashing in many directions. So similar to the club Harry'd played at.
October came to an end, and November was nearly half over when talk of another Hufflepuff party was on everyone’s minds.
Harry tossed a look back at him over his shoulder as he climbed the steps. “Yeah? I’m sure we don’t need to know much.”
So, she was there, then. And they were on a first name basis? He rubbed his hand over the rough wood again. “I didn’t know there was one.”
Draco was quiet for a moment. Then, softly, he said, “I don’t know how to do things part way with Harry. When I’m around him, I just want to … leap.”
, he had to remember to be kinder towards himself. He wasn’t damaged or broken, and he had so many people who loved him. And he was going to get better, he was going to be fully himself again—and he was already loads better.
Draco took a long drink of wine. He hadn't watched Harry's dancing videos since before the trip. Should he? (No.)
Potter looked surprised at that, and his eyes raked over him. What—looking for others? Draco was thankful his back was to the wall, and his Dark Mark was pressed firmly against his chest.
'No, right, completely different.' But internally he was wondering: was Samwise the Granger of the Weasley? Sauron was Voldemort, of course. Though a disembodied all-seeing eye was slightly more frightening. Slightly.
He winced. Okay, this was harder than he thought. He glanced over at Draco, and saw him write a word, pause, then write another. 'How are you doing?'
Harry clenched his jaw, searching Luna’s rather-calm face. He could try to argue with her, tell her that tea and biscuits couldn’t possibly make up for everything, but maybe it was better to drop it. This was a party, after all. ‘Okay … and what was so special about the tea?’
Malfoy turned to him, not quite meeting his eyes. Merlin—the war had sure changed the man. Sure, it had changed everyone in some way but … Malfoy was so … well, ‘tame’ wouldn’t be the right word, would it? But something like that. “You haven’t banished a ghost before.” It should’ve been a question, but Malfoy’s voice was so flat.
They reached the front of the queue and Harry handed over his tickets silently to the slightly-frazzled-looking ticket-collector, and then they were quickly ushered inside.
He ugly-cried into his morning tea. He kept thinking about how they’d never again travel to the seaside together—sitting on towels, squinting out at the waves, soaking in the summer sun as the portable wireless played pop songs. How he’d always have to keep reapplying the sunscreen charm on Ginny, and still she’d come home a little pink.
“Ginny’s away for a couple weeks. I’ll mull it over. When she comes back, it’ll be nearly Christmas, so, I guess I’ll have a serious talk with her after the Holidays.”
God, they were incredibly awkward, weren’t they? Harry hadn’t even planned out what he’d say, and now he found himself at a loss. This polite conversation was new for them, and seemed artificial, somehow. But Harry didn’t know any other way of going about it.
A soft rumbling sound filled the room—air conditioning, perhaps? It was a pleasant temperature and the room smelt a bit floral—it was … nice. Small, but nice.
Good thing he already had on the white, baggy, sleeveless cotton shirt, and pink cotton shorts Pansy made him buy. It showed off far-too much skin—far-too-
That goofy face filled the screen: a lopsided happy smile, and sparkling too-green eyes behind round plastic frames. Potter bit at the side of his lip, and adjusted something on the camera.
Harry laughed, hugging her to him, and shut the front door with his foot. “Yes we are.” He toed off his shoes and carried her off into the kitchen, where Ron was, with his back to them, humming to himself with a frilly floral apron and stirring something on the range.
‘You’re sitting in the dirt,’ blurted Harry, staring at Draco’s immaculately tailored trousers, and, his bare feet. Pale, narrow feet with barely-there light blond hairs on the big toes. Harry looked down at his own ripped jeans and old scuffed trainers.
Harry sat in the wooden chair on the other side of the desk, and watched as Draco rubbed his forehead, staring back at Harry like he was an Erumpent in an opera house.
“Draco, if you used a donor egg, your child would be 50% a Malfoy. No matter who the biological mother is, the child will only be 50% Malfoy.”
Other times, Harry tried to seek him out, but every time the opportunity seemed to strike, Hermione found something to distract him with. Things like: an essay due in a week, a personal favour (‘Please, Harry, will you bring this box of cookies over to Hagrid? I would, but I’m just so swamped with schoolwork.’), or an appeal to spend more time with Ron (‘He’s feeling a bit neglected, Harry.’)
An officiant from the Ministry walked through—a heavy-set woman with starched grey robes and big red plastic glasses. She stepped up to the ice archway and turned to face the crowd. The crowd was still looking back, so Harry pried his eyes away from the woman too.
At last, people began to disperse for the night. "Back to yours?" Ginny asked, grabbing her coat from the back of her chair. She asked it like they were discussing who'd pick up milk at the shop.
Then Seamus pulled Harry into a huge hug from behind, forcing an, ‘Oof,’ out of him, while dragging Harry back in to the crowd. Everyone wanted to talk all at once.
She left the bed, spoke some soft words into the telephone on their nightstand. Then, she walked off someplace. Draco still couldn’t bring himself to face her. She came back and draped something soft across his shoulders.
He cleared his throat, and scribbled a red ‘x’ on the paper in front of him. No, the Curse of the Bogies was not an Auror-grade defensive spell.
He thought about last night, bringing the image of Harry beside him on the floor into vivid colour in his mind. Draco thought about Harry’s bare legs, muscled and splayed out. His thighs, his knees, his shins, his feet. The fine black hairs on his brown skin. He thought about placing his own hand on Harry’s thigh. Just putting it there, resting it—feeling Harry’s warm skin underneath it, and the muscle and bone underneath
'Ev!' An exceptionally tall and muscled dark-skinned man rose to his feet and enveloped Harry in a hug. Harry looked small in his arms—and that was saying something.
Harry swallowed, staring at the spot he’d last seen Malfoy’s back before it’d disappeared around a bend. Then he sighed and resumed his cleaning spell on a patch of stubbornly scorched stone.
Not after having just come out to his parents, and nearly gotten disowned on the spot. Not after living in post-war Hogwarts with the crushing guilt, and backlash, of having been a Death Eater. Not after coming to terms with the reality that everything you were raised to believe had been wrong. The shame that comes with that.
Harry exhaled. ‘Well, I’m sorry anyway. I didn’t know what the spell did. And that isn’t a good excuse, but if I knew … I wouldn’t have used it.’
‘Hmm?’ Harry kept staring at Draco, silently daring him to look again, so he could communicate something with his body language. He didn’t know what exactly, just something that’d make Draco know to talk to him.
She broke away and smiled back at him. “Sure, darling.” Her expression became more serious. “But maybe we really should have a talk about, well, your preferences.”
Draco took a steady breath before continuing, 'Still—despite the threat of harm—he fought as a hero, alongside the likes of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley, Neville Longbottom, and so many others.' Draco caught Colin's mother's wet eyes, she nodded at him. 'We are here today to honour Colin Creevey's memory. And, what better way to honour him, than to showcase our veterans' brilliant photography? After all, photography, as you may know, was among Colin's greatest passions.'
‘Luna!’ Harry admonished, looking around to see if anyone overheard. His face felt hot. ‘I wasn’t … That doesn’t matter …'
They’d depicted what looked like two boys, hand in hand. One was shaded in brown and had a black lightning bolt scar. The other wasn’t shaded, so he was the same white of the page. And he had a smattering of yellow pencil crayon drawn hair. Both had wide smiles.
“Let me see, let me see. Ah yes, that’s right.” The Fat Lady made a show out of looking around her portrait, as if the answers could possibly be there.
Since he seemed to like this one so much, Draco wondered if he could live in a forest. It would be a quiet life, he could have a little one-room wooden cottage, and a fireplace disconnected from the Floo network. He’d be a bit of a hermit, then. He’s heard about those types in books—asocial wild men. There was usually some sort of bear attack in those stories.
‘Have you been to a supermarket before?’ Harry wondered aloud, as they entered the produce section. There was something odd about Draco Malfoy doing something as normal and unremarkable as shopping for groceries. But it was dawning on Harry that Draco really was a proper regular person, rather than some redeemed cartoon villain or misguided victim or posh viscount who sat up in his mansion and had everything served to him. Harry felt a nagging of guilt that he’d ever suspected Draco capable of nothing more than any of that.
“I shouldn’t drink,” Potter said miserably, as if he hadn’t heard Draco. "Oh my God—I'd demanded that you don't hate me." He groaned, covering his whole face with his hands then.
“Boyfriend?” Draco said breathily, his eyes had gone wide, and a grin threatened to form on his mouth—which he tried to bite back. It was so bloody endearing, it left Harry nearly breathless.
'Yeah. Lots of history, here. Where we're going is a UNESCO heritage site. It's all, like, fancy Renaissance architecture and cobbled streets and such. There's even a castle, but it's nothing like Hogwarts.'
Draco stepped forward slowly, feeling the cool water lapping at his ankles. He looked up and watched Potter’s silhouette dive into deeper waters. Draco shook his head again, and smiled.
A wrinkle appeared between Draco’s eyebrows. Harry spotted it in time, before Draco looked off towards the trees. Harry watched his profile, until he realised he was staring. He took a swig of the maroon. He’d made this terribly awkward. Perhaps blurting out every honest thought that popped into his head wasn’t wise.
. He had a noticeable limp in his right leg. Harry eyed it curiously as they stepped through a side hallway and into a small office.
Harry turned it over, and read the track listing. It all meant absolutely nothing to him, and he was no closer in unravelling the mystery.
Also, Draco's theme song is "The walker" (vers. eng.) / "La marcheuse" (vers. fran.) by Christine and the Queens, for lines such as:
“But there were always nice cats around at school.” Draco looked up at Harry, warily, like perhaps he shouldn’t have mentioned Hogwarts. He bit his lip, and looked back down at the cat, purring up a storm, still showing her stomach. “Millie had some nice ones. My favourite of hers was Michael, a black cat, he’d often sit on my lap in the common room while I studied.”
Harry scooted closer, and put his arm over Malfoy’s shoulders. Malfoy seemed rather stiff about the whole thing. He just sat straight, and did not lean into Harry in the least.
She swirled in her blood-red robes, and marched out of his office, slamming the door behind herself.
“No,” Harry rushed to say, stepping closer to lay them on Malfoy’s desk. Now that his hands were free, he didn’t know what to do with them. So he stuffed them into his pockets. “They’re none of my business.”
Harry spluttered with a mouth of mashed potatoes, Hermione was stunned silent, and Ron looked as if he’d seen a ghost.
Puffing out his cheeks, he went to click away from the page. Then he thought—why not? He could leave a comment, too.
close—speaking quietly. And the melodies from the quartet below travelled up along with the refreshing night breeze. It was getting so cold in Scotland as winter approached, so it was nice to be somewhere milder, even if only for one evening.
'For making this all so bloody awkward tonight,' Harry continued, wincing. 'You've been so …' He took a breath. 'So good with me. Thank you.'
nervous. It was just Malfoy. Same sodding git he’d known for years. He probably wouldn’t even show up.
Draco looked at Potter, watching him break off another piece of Scotch pancake with his fork, and decided not to say anything.
Then he smiled, slowly, so that it lit up his face. And that just made Harry smile too. Then they were just goofily smiling at each other, albeit shyly, tentatively.
Nineties Muggle pop music played, something upbeat with a female singer. They pushed past other couples through to the centre of the dance floor, and Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders. Draco rolled his eyes and took hold of Harry’s waist. ‘This feels a bit ridiculous, Harry.’
‘Why would …' Harry began to ask, trailing off as he spotted a hint of white tucked under the leaves.
Slytherins had to be so tiresomely subtle, cunning, secretive in their friendships, their affections. See: Pansy’s scheme. Now, if she’d been a Gryffindor, Draco probably could’ve had a nice, mature heart-to-heart chat with her about his feelings, instead of having him thrust into Potter’s bedroom against his will.
…" Harry copied that down (with their actual names of course). “Congratulations on your wedding. Wait, no.
‘Yeah.’ Harry shrugged, searching their faces. He didn’t understand any of this. They never seemed to care what he was up to.
Malfoy shifted down, supporting himself with hands on either side of Harry’s head, as he kept thrusting into him, and, practically purring, said, “La donna mangia la mela.” Malfoy stared at him like he was a bit awed by him.
They scrubbed at their hands with the tissues, dabbed at t-shirts, and then Harry cleaned the tip of his soft cock off, holding it in his hands, looking down with a concentrated expression on his face. It was such an intimate thing to witness—private and somehow erotic.
