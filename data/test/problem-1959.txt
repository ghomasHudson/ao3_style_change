A Mediwitch bursts in to the room then, the same one who first spoke to Harry when Draco woke up. “Sorry, Mr. Potter, I’m going to have to ask you to leave!” She shouts, and Harry barely stumbles out of her way in time as she makes her way to Draco. She casts a calming charm on him, starts to say soothing things, and tells him to breathe. She shoots Harry a bit of a glare at that point, almost a warning,
“I need to know if he has ever come to visit Annie.” Harry continues, and Mary nods her head. She places her hand over her wand.
"What is it?" He asks me.
"How?" I’m almost demanding. "What about my family? Can they be protected?"
"No, please don't apologize, I uh...thank you, Potter. I can't believe you did that for me. After everything...I wasn't sure...well I mean..." I trail off idiotically.
The real test is hoisting the unconscious man up so that Draco can half-drag, half-carry him to his car. He instantly is struck with a sense of familiarity upon closer inspection of the guy's face. He looks a lot like Harry Potter. But there's no way that would be possible, right? Draco regrets not working out as often as he should have, because this man is fucking heavy! He is panting heavily and sweating despite the cold by the time they make it to the car. He tosses Potter wannabe (he might actually be Potter's muggle doppelganger, he looks so much like him) into the passenger seat unceremoniously and then fumbles with his keys to get the motor running so he could at least turn on the damn heater. This guy feels like a block of ice, and Draco thinks that is not a good thing at all.
"It will be okay." He says into my hair.
"Will you let him know we were here?" Granger asks. I nod, and they shuffle out of the room, whispering to each other in hushed tones. I'm a bit annoyed that his friends aren't more insistent about staying with him, but I remember Potter mentioning at some point that it felt as though they had drifted apart. I guess this must be what he meant.
They are laughing together about a very particular story, involving Draco forcing the house elves to play dress up with him and have a tea party (Hermione would not be amused), when she suddenly turns to him with seriousness in her familiar eyes. Soft, warm sunlight shines through the small open window and bounces off of her sleek, pale hair. She looks stunning and terrifying all at once. Harry swallows down his bit of bread and waits for her to speak to him. She reaches a regal, glove covered hand out to his arm and rests it on his bicep before giving a firm and gentle squeeze.
At first, Draco doesn't quite realize what he is witnessing. He startles and almost screams when he sees a man staring at him from the ground about 10 feet away. He thought he had been alone. But as he squints through the fog and the scene unfolds further, he feels sick to his stomach. Terrified blue eyes stare up at him and Draco knows without a doubt that he needs to intervene.
“You could have been hurt,” she starts, “I knew you were working on locating Dresden but I had no idea you were actually planning to
“And you,” Harry starts, stepping closer, “all you have to do is lay back.” Draco places his mug on the coffee table, sets his jaw.
They spend the next month in their own sexy bubble of sorts. Harry goes to work during the day while Draco works on healing at home. They have tons of sex together when Harry gets home, and spend any other free time enjoying meals together, going for walks, or reading in the drawing room. For the first few nights, at the end of the evening, Draco retreats to his room and Harry sleeps on the couch. By the fifth night, Harry has had enough.
“We spent a lot of time together while you were…erm…healing,” Harry starts, “did a lot of talking. She approves of me, did you know?”
"I hear you." He answers with a sob. This is not the first time she has said this and it won't be the last. Pain hits the back of his throat like acid and he struggles to keep the tears from falling. His wife would never understand his plight. If she did, she would surely leave him.
“Well, Potter, first…have you turned in any written notes on this case yet?” Draco responds, eyebrows raised in question.
“Do you recognize this man?” Harry asks, showing her the picture.
“May I?” She asks, and at his consent pulls the wand out. She casts a quick spell and they both watch as magic sparks out, forming pictures of thousands of faces that flash quickly before both their eyes. Harry waits patiently as the spell searches through the visitor database before coming up with no match to Dresden’s picture. “He hasn’t.” Mary states needlessly. Harry cards his hand through his hair and encounters a knot, which he tries to comb through subtly, but Mary’s eyes bore holes into his head as she watches him.
"Honey, can't it wait? We are with family..." she begins.
We have decided once a month simply isn't enough, so we have been seeing each other twice a month instead. We know it is more dangerous this way, but neither one of us wants to say so out loud. Voldemort has finally allowed me into his inner circle, and the information I provide has become more crucial as of late. This is the excuse we use for the increase in visits, but we both know the truth: we can't get enough of each other.
“I’m so happy to hear that,” she says into his shoulder. The smell of her strawberry shampoo is at once familiar and smothering as it assaults his nostrils. “We can talk more about the details later. I’m going to make an announcement here in the next few days, but until then Harry, please keep this information privy to only those in this apartment. Oh and Harry, I know what you did for Annie….thank you.” She finishes, backing away from him, and Harry finds himself able to breathe again. It will probably be a while before the suffocating feeling of being in her arms wears away fully. It was all he felt when they were together. Old habits and whatnot.
He lines his aching cock up to Draco’s entrance and begins to push in gently. The delicious heat and pressure are too much, and almost cause him to cum prematurely. He has to stop for a second before continuing, and it doesn’t help that Draco moans and thrusts back against him with ardor. “Yes, Harry, just like that.” He encourages, and Harry helplessly obliges, thrusting into him with full gusto, finding a rhythm that is at once familiar and absolutely unprecedented. He covers his fingers in more lubricant and wraps his hand around Draco’s erect cock, pumping him in harmony with his thrusts, eliciting a string of beautiful gibberish past Draco’s lips. His other hand grabs onto Draco’s hip for purchase, and they thrust against each other feverishly, becoming faster and less coordinated as they each hurtle toward climax.
My heart twists with the emotion that those three words elicit. I think I love him too. In fact, I'm sure of it. But there is so much he doesn't know about me, about the things I have done, the things I have allowed to happen.
“I can’t wait!” She says, “Dennis will be by later this evening, he’s running a bit later at work than he thought he would.” Harry has only met Dennis a few times, but he seems like a nice bloke, and Ron really likes him, which is no easy feat. Plus, Ginny seems genuinely happy with him, so it can’t get any better than that.
. Harry was hoping that they didn’t mean anything. That he could conclude this investigation with a nice, tidy bow and call it a day. No complications, no loose ends. Why waste any more time on that fucking bastard when he is already dead? He thinks desperately about how he wants to answer this question. Just how much did Draco see? It really did look like Harry was just defending himself, right? He wracks his brain at the memory of it, but truthfully it seems so foggy and far away, despite it having just been the day before.
"Malfoy," he says darkly.
“You kept me going,” Draco plunges forward, eyes glossing over with unshed tears, “I held out hope that you were looking, that even after all that time had passed, you were still looking for me.” His voice gets lower as he speaks and Harry has to crane his neck and quicken his step so he can hear him. Draco’s hands are twisting in his blanket tightly. He looks much younger in those few, vulnerable moments.
"Potter," I whisper into his hair. He hums in response, his fingers brushing softly on my chest, swirling in some unknown pattern. He is everything to me in this moment. I squeeze him a little tighter and brace myself for what lies ahead. "It's about the war..." I say lamely. He stiffens and dislodges himself from my arms.
Surprisingly, Draco is awake, sitting up in his bed, when Harry steps into his room. His long hair is slightly damp, as if he has just finished showering. He looks a little more refreshed now, as if a few hours of good sleep could somehow negate all that he was put through. His lips quirk again into that tiny half smile before resuming the frown he was wearing before he laid eyes on Harry. Merlin, he is so fucking beautiful, Harry can barely stand it. Harry glances away, eyes landing on the empty vial of dreamless sleep draught on the bedside table. So yeah, it was probably pretty good sleep, actually.
“Hi, Mary.” He says politely, offering a slight smile.
When I awake in the morning I am alone once again.
“That’s not what I meant,” Harry attempts to clarify, but Draco shakes his head.
“You alright, Potter?” He asks, taking a step toward him.
“Tilda and I have been working through it together,” Draco continues, and Harry holds back a smile at his mention of his mind healer, wanting to remain perfectly neutral so as not to scare him away. “It’s a coping mechanism, or so she says, which seems right, even if it’s the not the healthiest way to cope with my trauma….anyways, when I first came back, I couldn’t stand to use pillows or blankets, but I’ve built up to this point, and I think, I’m ready to try the cushioning charm.” It all seems to come out in one breath, and Draco’s hand is gripping Harry’s so tight Harry thinks it might be broken. But he dares not pull it away, and his heart only swells with happiness and adoration at the thought that Draco trusts him enough to share with him about these things.
"I think maybe you should talk to someone Harry, it's been a year and you haven't made any progress-"
"Why do you care, Potter? Why do you even believe me?"
The tall angel doesn't seem to notice Harry as he carries on smoking, the light from his cigarette butt allowing Harry to catch certain glimpses of him. Silver eyes draped in black eye liner and purple eye shadow, lips painted blood red, and a tight, short black dress clinging to slim muscles poking out from a long, glossy black coat. The angel then starts as he notices him suddenly.  Molten eyes widen as Harry pleads silently with him, trying desperately to hold onto his fading consciousness. He flicks the cigarette down on the ground and crushes it under silver stiletto heal.
“Please, don’t stop eating on my account, I’ll only be a moment.” She replies, and Harry stares at them like a fish out of water. He can’t determine exactly how he feels about his ex-wife and current lover under the same roof, let alone exchanging pleasantries. It doesn’t even really seem forced, to their credit. He watches as Draco nods and returns to his toast, taking a small bite and chewing thoughtfully. He is looking off in the distance but Harry knows he is probably going to listen to their conversation intently. Ginny, even if she felt he might listen, doesn’t seem to mind either way as she turns back to him.
“Yes.” He states clinically, although his insides are screaming at him to
Harry thrusts and thrusts until he feels Draco shudder beneath him, the other man moaning as he comes inside of Harry. Harry feels the scorching liquid spurting inside him and yells out as his own orgasm hits him full force. Draco milks him until he is spent, before pulling Harry down to meet his lips once again. They kiss with full force at first, slowly becoming more and more gentle as they come down from their high. Draco’s hands are everywhere, running along Harry’s sweat soaked back and then up into his hair as he presses feather light kisses against Harry’s mouth, face, and neck. Harry shivers against the tenderness as he works to slow his breathing. He collapses next to Draco on the bed, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him snug.
Since I wasn't able to warn Potter of the reassignment, my only hope is to be able to survive this encounter unseen. There are two other Death Eaters with me, both of them determined and grim as we move about in search of Potter and his friends. We've been ordered to try and find them, and to attack if we do but only lightly. The idea is to scare them off and push them back to the safety of Hogwarts.  Even if we were to find their camp it would be stupid to attack so many people at once.
“No robes…just t-shirts, jeans, that sort of thing…I think, I think they were Muggles, Potter.”
“It smells amazing in here!” Ginny says, moving in for a hug. Harry returns the hug, breathing in her strawberry scented hair. Albus sometimes smells like her shampoo, he muses.
“I had to be sure it was viable before telling you,” she explains, “no point if we were just going to lose it.” Harry can’t take his eyes off of the little fetus as it carries on with its loops and twirls.  “Harry, we’re going to have a son.” Ginny’s voice carry’s on. A son. Harry can barely keep it together there in front of his ex-wife and his current lover, all under the same roof, sharing this moment as one.
"Nnmmmpphhh." Harry says, trying his hardest to form the word "no." His head lolls to the side now, leaning into the strong warmth of his captor. He smells nice, which somehow makes all of this feel worse, because Harry thinks he might have let the idiot fuck him if he had just asked politely.
“Potter?” Draco has opened his door, squinting into the darkness before a spark appears at the tip of his wand. “What are you doing out here at this-“ He cuts himself off, taking notice of the suitcases floating along behind Harry. Harry looks up at him pitifully, shrugging slightly before letting his shoulders droop into the epitome of a pathetic blob. Draco nods sharply and steps aside to allow him entry. He is still wearing his quirky pajamas from earlier in the day, and Harry wonders if Draco has left his apartment at all today.
I hope you all have enjoyed reading as much as I have enjoyed writing! Just a warning, this chapter is purely smut and sentimental fluff. Please bear with me, I am not used to writing so much happiness in one sitting. Sad/angsty/dark is more my style, but our boys deserve a happy ending!
“Can we talk about this later?” He asks, face ashen and shoulders sagging.
Harry already knows that any research into Dresden himself is a dud. Since he was disowned by his family long ago, his name was actually changed and his existence erased from his family tree. So Harry resolves that maybe he should switch tactics and start just taking his picture around and asking if anyone recognizes him. It would be a long shot, but Harry feels he should exhaust all options. Once Dresden’s name is made public, he would be able to ask about him freely.
“This hangover is really killing me.” Harry says, voice thick with cement. Malfoy nods ever so slightly and looks away to focus on the road. Harry isn’t sure if he believes him or not, and he steels himself in this moment to get his shit together before he ends up being forced to do some kind of recovery bullshit on Malfoy’s insistence. He doesn’t need this right now. The short drive stretches on into eternity as both men stare forward at the road. Harry’s mind begins to wander into those dark places he tries so desperately to avoid at all costs, and he is grateful when they finally arrive and he is able to focus on taking some advil, sipping water despite his urges to retch everything he is trying to swallow.
"Don't apologize," I tell him, pushing him back down on the bed and grabbing his hand again, "you just caught me by surprise..." He smiles crookedly at me. "How are you feeling?" I ask.
“Chicken with mushroom sauce sounds great,” Harry tries again, “and for lunch, how about turkey club sandwiches?” He busies himself with gathering more ingredients for their meals, avoiding eye contact with the slightly taller blonde beside him. He can feel the man shuffling on his feet before he answers.
"No, I..." Malfoy hesitates, takes a breath, seems to try again, "no Potter, what happened to you last night was not your fault. But when I said you were being reckless, I meant the drug and alcohol abuse... Do you know what muggle drugs will do to a wizard's magical core?"
“I…have to be sure…” Harry starts. He feels around for the vials and pulls them out to place them on the table between them. Ginny’s eyes narrow viciously at them before turning her dark stare on him.
“The newly appointed Head Auror might have had something to do with it.” He jokes, and laughter fills the air once again.
“You’ve got a dirty mind, Potter.” He breathes, but Harry can tell that Draco is not completely against the idea. “I-I don’t know if I can.” He says in the next second, shoulders tensing.
"Please, see someone." She begs quietly.
“Let’s try it, then, and if you don’t like it, we can always just go back to not using the cushioning charm tomorrow.” He encourages, smiling sweetly. He is secretly thrilled at the prospect of the cushioning charm, and he hopes desperately that it will work out for the better.
to be gay, don’t you think you would be the best choice of partner for the Malfoy name?” The smirk full blooms into a smile and Harry can’t help but return it.
"Don't be late again, Malfoy." He says simply.
Arthur takes in a sharp breath. “Oh my,” he says, “I’ll help you in any way I can, Harry.”
he would find me here, vulnerable and a complete wreck. I decide to go ahead and let him kill me. There is no hope for me now anyways; it died with Dumbledore.
"Woah, let me help you." Says the man who Harry is almost 100% sure has spiked his drink. Harry feels a strong arm reach up and grab him from underneath his sagging shoulders. His dance partner begins to walk him out and Harry has no choice but to lean heavily onto him for support. He wants to scream, to punch him and run away, but he can barely keep his eyes open.
“State your name.” Harry spits caustically.
“Let’s even the score then, shall we?” And Draco makes fast work of Harry’s t-shirt and jeans, stripping him efficiently, making a show of doing it without the aid of a wand. Harry would laugh if he wasn’t so bloody turned on, plus his brain is just basically mush at this point. “You are so fucking gorgeous.” Draco breathes, and their mouths connect again, hands roaming each other’s bodies freely, wrapping around each other and pulling each other close.
"I know all the signs, Potter... I've basically made a life here, in the muggle world, and I'm what muggles call a 'substance abuse counselor.' I've done it for years."  Malfoy is nervously tracing a tattoo on his left wrist, it's a muggle tattoo of a dragon, leaving the serpent's scar that Harry knows is there, completely unrecognizable. Harry recognizes the dragon from childhood, it's not a dragon from the Wizarding world, but a Chinese muggle dragon from fairy tales, long and deep red, wrapping almost all the way up Malfoy's arm.
He is relieved when he finally reaches his destination, a strip of road bustling with bars and nightlife. Groups of young women cling tightly to each other as they stumble drunkenly around, laughing and singing, talking loudly at each other over the muted music drifting in from the many bars flashing “open” nearby. What Harry likes the most about this area is how open and free everyone is. It’s not just groups of women, there are men, too, and people of all different ages and sizes. People can dress the way they want, kiss whoever they want, and say whatever they want without fear of judgment. There are bars and clubs that meet anyone’s needs as well. For Harry, there is one particular night club that he likes to call his home away from home, “Evol,” a play on the word “love.” It’s a gay bar, something he didn’t know he had been missing until he stumbled upon it several months ago. He sighs contentedly as he steps inside, allowing his senses to take in the sensations all around him; the smell of sweat, cologne, and liquor, the loud booming of the rhythmic music in the background, and the heat of packed bodies twisting together on the dance floor.
“You know mate…Ginny’s so fucking pissed at you.” Ron tells him, clamping a hand on his shoulder. Harry can’t tell if he is coming from a best friend standpoint or that of a big brother.
The first thing Harry notices upon waking is that he is in a complete stranger's bedroom. His heart begins to race as he blinks blurrily at his surroundings. His head is pounding, mouth dry, and limbs heavy. His eyes are burning at not having taken out his contacts the night before. He is in his boxers but he is covered with a thick, warm blanket. The room smells oddly familiar, although Harry can't quite place where he might recognize it...it reminds him a bit of Hogwarts, actually, a thought that makes his throat sting. But the most alarming of all is the lack of control of his wrists. They are positioned above his head in a manner that is quite uncomfortable, shackled to the head board. Harry's throat fills with bile as he struggles against his bindings, nausea coming in waves. What has he gotten himself into?
them with all his might and power.
“So I helped him. He was going to do the actual horrible parts and I just needed to provide research and a pureblood wizard.  Choosing Malfoy was more a matter of convenience than anything else. He was there, he met the criteria for the blood ritual, and I knew that no one would really miss a former Death Eater anyways.” Harry knows that Dresden is trying to get a rise out of him, but it doesn’t change the fact that before he can even take another breath, there is a wand at Shacklebolt’s throat.
"Yes but-" he tries to argue, but I plunge forward before I lose my cool.
“I’ve missed you,” Harry whispers into his neck, before placing a small kiss there. Draco shivers, his arms tightening around him almost reflexively.
He takes a quick breath and continues, “He always used a Muffliato whenever he cast the incantation, and he was very careful about that. Not once did I hear the words he used. But…there was always this sort of pounding sound. It was awful, like the beating of huge, amplified drums or something. And there was something else…besides what I told you about the blood needing someone else’s blood, I remember that he once told me he needed the blood to be ‘afraid.’ Which makes sense because he always…” Draco takes a longer, shuddering breath at that point.
forgive you!" The tears are finally spilling.
“Thanks, I sure hope so,” Draco starts, “the more I think about it, the more I’m wondering what the hell we were on when we decided to host Christmas this year.”
"-and you know this is your last chance, Potter, remember your promise." I deadpan. I'll remind him as many times as I have to if it will get him to see reason. "We can't do anything about this."
"I guess we will know by tomorrow if he still trusted me." I say grimly. The hand on my knee squeezes tighter before he pulls me into a bone crushing hug.
We both know it's too late for that.
"Don't worry," he says aloud to no one in particular, and yet a very specific someone at the same time, "I'm going to get him this time. I haven't forgotten you." He is attacked by a litany of emotions in this moment, each tethered to a specific memory.
“I told her the truth.” He whispers, his face inches away from Draco’s. He can almost taste the mint of his breath. His heart is pounding as he stares into deep pools of liquid mercury.
“It’s okay-“ Harry starts to say, overwhelmed with emotion, but Draco continues speaking at the same time.
“I’ll look into it. Listen, this is good enough right now, we can continue later this afternoon, yeah? Get some rest for now.” He reaches out for Draco’s hands again. Draco pulls away as if burned. Harry stares at his own hands, resting dejectedly on the empty stretch of bed next to Draco.  He can’t help but think about the first time they ever held hands…
His eyes glance to the clock on the wall. It’s only half past noon. Harry sighs in frustration, vision blurring for a moment. He removes his glasses and rubs his eyes tiredly. Ron isn’t having much luck either on his end as far as researching the blood ritual. Blood magic is rarer than all other types, and there isn’t much literature available. The type of clearance they would need to access the books that
“It certainly explains a lot, Harry, I just wish you had felt like you could come to us with it, you know, sooner.” She tells him sincerely. She takes a slightly swollen hand and places it over his on the table. It’s warm and a bit sweaty, but comforting nonetheless. The rest of their lunch remains the same, with a slight uncomfortable tension to it, and not another word from Ron. To his credit, Ron walks over to Draco’s side and sits with him, eyeing him cautiously as Harry and Hermione finish eating.
“And is he in love with you too?”
“What have I missed? Anything exciting?” Draco asks again.
, the entire time I was kidnapped. That didn’t change - my feelings, I mean.” His throat bobs as he swallows thickly, running his fingers through his hair, his eyes churning with turmoil. Harry doesn’t like where this is going, although hearing him say those words out loud feels akin to a thousand pounds being taken off of his shoulders. Draco raises a hand as Harry tries to interrupt him, then continues, “But I had a lot of time to think, as well, about my life and the way I was living it. A-and, I decided, that things can’t be like they were before. I gained a lot of perspective, about right and wrong, and I know that, before, we talked about doing things a certain way. I know we discussed me getting married and fulfilling my familial duty of providing an heir, and continuing what we had in secret…”
Of course it would be Harry
Harry is surprised to find Ginny up and waiting for him when he arrives home. The first thing he notices is that she does not look pleased. Harry knows this because her displeased look has become the new normal for them. He sighs and readies himself for yet another argument. Ginny sits at the table with an empty mug in front of her. She is holding a crumpled piece of paper in her hands, most likely the letter he sent her. Her face is tear streaked, hair pulled back into a messy pony tail, with red locks falling out in random places and tucked behind her ears. She looks pale in the dim light from the hallway that bleeds into the darkened dining room.
Harry is hunched over his desk as he goes through his case notes for the hundredth time. It’s been a week since he’s spoken with Arthur, and since that point he has been stuck, unable to really find the courage to confront his wife. Arthur had insisted that there was no way Ginny or Annie could have known about Dresden’s relation to Annie. And Harry really wants to believe this is true, but he knows that as a good Auror, he needs to follow up on it to be sure. Ginny is going to be livid when he finally does confront her. He feels for the tiny vials that he has in his robes pocket and relaxes slightly as his fingers make contact with the cool glass.
I nod dumbly. There is no fighting this. Everything is already out in the open. She brings the vial to my lips and I spread them open easily, allowing her to tip the bitter liquid into my mouth. I swallow, coughing slightly as it burns its way down my throat.
"Wait...what?"
“Draco I-” Harry gasps out, holding back a sob.
“Of course. It will just be lunch. I won’t mention the case at all.” Harry nods emphatically.
liar. Harry can’t bear the thought of losing his entire family. But somehow, even with how horrible the conversation went with his wife, and running into yet another dead end with the case, Harry feels lighter, somehow. He no longer has to be the keeper of his dark, shameful secret. The truth has set them free. They were living in a miserable marriage, and Harry owed this to Ginny, even if he could have done it a better way.
“Okay,” Draco repeats, “what are your questions, Potter?” Harry really wishes Draco would stop using his last name. He grabs his notepad and self-inking quill out of his robe pocket and takes a seat across from Draco. He doesn’t make any attempt at grabbing his hand or anything, as he understands there are boundaries for this sort of thing; for asking Draco to bear his soul and recount the horrors he has experienced.
“Harry,” Draco says gently, “that was a dangerous thing to do.” Harry can feel the other man’s pulse quickening underneath his mild touch.
“Fucks sake! English, please.” He says, eyes wide at the indignity of it all.
"They got away before you were hit." He looks defeated. His face is tracked with tears and dirt and pain. His eyes are emerald pools of sorrow. He stands tall and thin, darkness spreading from behind him before the door slams shut. I have to look away. I hear him whisper before the pain subsides and I feel suddenly clean and warm and dry.
At this, Ron muffles a snort. He takes the documents and lays them flat on the table so that Shacklebolt can see them. The man withers further into his seat, his eyes filling with tears, and lets out a defeated sigh.
“This woman has spent the last year thinking her son died a horrible death,” he says darkly, “and yet you keep her from seeing him because he was talking to me? At what point did I tell you I was conducting any type of official Auror business?”
He seems to take my silence the wrong way because he then says, "I know, it was risky and stupid... and I know I put the mission at risk, but I just-"
“I’m thinking…how much I’ve wasted time and energy on us these last two years. I’m not even mad that you’re gay. I’m mad about how long you’ve been lying to me, going behind my back, too much of a spineless coward to do me the common courtesy of telling the fucking truth! You could have put us out of this misery so long ago.”
It feels like hours before the Mediwitch comes out to get him again. She tries to smile but Harry can tell she is not the least bit happy. She runs her hands through her hair and gives him a pointed look after standing in silence for a few moments. He stammers out an apology, and he means it, because he feels absolutely terrible. He tells her he has been giving this whole thing some thought and he feels it may be good to get Draco out for a bit, somewhere nice, to talk about anything other than his recent experience. He knows of a great restaurant, a fancy, posh French place that used to be one of Draco’s favorites. It may help him get his appetite back up, since he hasn’t been eating well since he’s been up.
“Okay, okay, Ginny, I’ve come into some new information about Dresden. He’s…Annie’s great grandfather. He was paying for her treatments anonymously before I…you know.” Ginny looks surprised for a moment, then shakes her head slightly.
“Is there anything you can share with me about Annie’s case that seems strange or suspicious? Whether it be about her medical condition or otherwise.” Harry asks her, grasping at straws.
In an instant, both men Apparate to St. Mungo's. There is no time to deal with the mess they have left at the cottage.
“Harry, no, this isn’t what it looks like!” Draco screams, scrambling for purchase, tipping the blood onto the carpet in the process. Harry watches the dark liquid as it spills downward onto the cream carpet, spreading in odd patterns as it soaks into the plush fibers. He can’t help but think of that day just a little over a year ago, when he watched his partner and lover bleed all over the ground as he died in his arms. He shakes that thought away, looking back up into frantic silvery eyes.
I can't take my eyes off of Potter, even as I feel the sinking feeling of disapparition twisting in my gut.
"Absolutely, sweetheart." And then, after barely a minute, "I've just made a breakthrough in the case, can I be excused?" Cheers erupt at the table, but Harry doesn't miss the sour look on Ginny's face.
, somehow. He brews himself a strong cup of coffee, and then grabs the quickest shower of his entire life. Right before he heads off to work, he glances at the bedroom he and Ginny are supposed to be sharing. The lights are on inside. For a single moment, he considers trying to go inside and talk to her. But he knows it will only escalate into another fight at this point, and he is honestly too tired for this right now. He turns away and steps out into the light of day.
“Thank you.” He says, sipping gratefully. He's met with a smile, a gentle touch to his shoulder. But it doesn't feel right again somehow, the idea that HE might be out there.....highly unlikely but the thought has been planted like a seed now. His head begins to hurt and he feels suddenly exhausted. Must be a bad high. Harry makes a mental note to talk to Jim about this. He gulps the rest of his drink down in one fluid motion.
More silence on the drive back to Malfoy’s flat, but Harry is thankful for it. His hands feel clammy and his stomach is queasy, the blurriness of his vision creeping from the edges to take over in its entirety. Malfoy be damned, he takes his glasses off and slumps forward with his head in his hands, elbows on his knees. He takes deep breaths, feeling overwhelmed as he holds back from retching and screaming and crying all at once. This isn’t working. He isn’t going to make it through today without dying unless he has some kind of relief.
“Okay. I’m going to take this back to the ministry and do some research, now that we know what it is I bet I can find it.” Hermione says. She is an unspeakable and has access to research that Harry and Ron would not even be able to fathom. She grabs the papers from Ron’s loose grip. He nods at her and turns his attention to Harry.
"Out with it, Potter!" I snap, the dread pooling into my heart with alarming quickness.
“Exactly. It stands to reason that if they’re related, it’s the same disorder, and Dresden might have had a lot more at stake than just curing himself.”
"Malfoy," he spits my name with vitriol. I am unable to say anything as he grabs me by my collar, lifting me up off the ground. His breath is putrid and there is a terrifying look on his face as he crushes me into the wall. "You fucking bastard!" He yells, pulling me forward before slamming me against the wall once again. Part of me realizes that this probably isn't 100% personal. Weasley must have lost someone important. He is blaming me because I happen to be the death eater that has been caught. The rational part of my brain understands this, but the other part, the part that is reckless, much darker and filled with deep rooted pride, wants to egg him on, to push his buttons and see how far we can take this.
"Sorry," he says with some concern. He tries to move but flinches with pain.
“Of course,” Harry says, internally beating himself up for bombarding Draco in the first place. Right now, he just needs to get him home so he can begin healing. They will have plenty of time to reflect and talk things out later. He helps Draco make it to the door, and swishes his wand to gather all of their items and float them into their bags. “I’ll let Narcissa know you’re awake.” He tells the blond man, who eyes him skeptically.
“Have you finished your questioning?” She asks him as they part.
Harry finds himself standing in the darkness outside of Draco’s flat, a few magically shrunken suitcases floating behind him. He doesn’t really have anywhere else to go. He is sure that Ginny is telling Ron and Hermione and all the other Weasleys about how Harry is a disgusting, cowardly,
Harry wants to say,
I wait for what seems like another eternity for Potter to come back for me. When I do sleep, it's riddled with nightmares- my parents dying, Potter dying, being thrown in Azkaban for the rest of my life, etc. I haven't bothered to sleep on the cot, as the ground seems to retain just a bit more heat. Every once in a while someone comes in with some food and drink, but I don't feel hungry or thirsty. When I ask for any updates, I am told someone will come fill me in when the time is right.
Thanks so much for reading! Please let me know what you think.
“We need to get him to the 4
“Hey,” he says softly, “you didn’t have to wait up for me.” He hopes his words will placate her in some way.
I'm being kept in the dark, literally and figuratively. It's infuriating but I don't have the energy to complain. I just sit and continue to wait. I'm tired. I'm terrified. There is nothing for me to do. Things are flashing through my mind at lightning speed. Things I should have said to him, things that I shouldn't have said. It's all too much and the waiting is almost unbearable. I am a tight knot of anticipation, ready to snap at any moment.
"Why don't you go rest for a bit? Ron and I can sit with him." Granger offers, but it seems halfhearted. She just looks much too tired. Her hair is pulled back in a loose pony tail, bits of frizzy fringe escaping here and there in long wisps around her face. There are dark circles under her tear-stained eyes, and her face is gaunt and pale.
"Right," Draco says, "I'm gonna need your Gryffindor's honor that you will stay here for the next 24 hours, and if for some reason you show any signs of-"
"We have been through this a thousand times Harry, what happened was absolutely not your fault. Do you hear me?" She is reaching out to him now, fumbling slightly in the dark until her hands are caressing his face. Harry understands that he should feel comforted by his wife's words, her tender touches. But all he feels is desolation.
By the eighth night, Harry learns that they both suffer from residual nightmares. Harry’s still revolve around Draco’s ‘death,’ and Draco’s revolve around his experiences while being held hostage by Dresden. He has one repeating nightmare where the ghosts of all the murdered children are haunting him, asking him why he allowed them to die, circling in until they have taken up all of his air and he begins to suffocate. Those nights are the hardest, and Harry does his best to hold onto Draco as he gasps for air, screaming into the night and asking why things had to happen the way they did. When Harry has his nightmares, Draco gently taps him on the shoulder until he wakes, then he wraps his arms around him and tells him everything is okay, and it’s enough to sooth Harry back to sleep.
“Follow me,” Draco deadpans, and turns on his heel toward his bedroom. Inside, they find a completely unconscious Kingsley Shacklebolt, under several stunning charms, sitting stiffly and unconsciously in the third missing chair from the dining room. The room itself appears neat and tidy, obviously escaping their earlier duel unfazed. Although Harry had expected this, something about actually seeing him there makes it all too real. He feels dazed, swaying slightly for just a moment before righting himself. He’s been through worse, he reminds himself, so much worse.
“So much better!” Ginny replies, “The potions you have been brewing for her have done wonders!” She exclaims. “I don’t know what would have happened if you hadn’t have invented these treatments when you did!”
I don't have to describe to him the gravity of our situation, but I do it anyway. "We both know that you have to win this war, Potter, and my life isn't worth the loss of countless others'. I'm just saying, don't let your emotions get in the way of our mission. If it comes down to it, you kill me, or you let me die."
Heater on, Draco takes a moment to assess the situation. What does he do now? Wait for this dude to wake up? And then what happens? The radio clock glares 2:00am and Draco is really tired. He taps the gently snoring man on the shoulder, gaining no reaction.
“Romantically?” She follows up, to which Harry has no choice but to say-
“Gin – I didn’t want you to worry-“ he starts, but she stands up abruptly, slams the paper down on the table loudly.
“First off, what can you tell me about these kids? Any identifying features, was there a pattern of some sort?” Harry asks. The kids are the most perplexing part of the story.
"You'd know all about that..." He responds. A few minutes tick by, and both men are content to sit in silence before Ron speaks again.
“Blood magic.” Harry repeats. He begins to piece some things together, but he is still very confused, “Draco,” He gives his hands a gentle squeeze, hopeful that it comes off as reassuring. Draco stares down at their hands blankly, blinking slowly before turning his attention back to Harry.
“The case that is more important to you than your own marriage?” She asks him, and Harry feels compelled to answer, before he even has the chance to contemplate what has just been asked-
"I swear, Potter, if this doesn't work....if my parents die because of me... if we lose our one opportunity..." It's too painful to finish that sentence.
"What is it?"
“How’s Annie?” Draco’s voice floats around in Harry’s head as he poses the question to Ginny.
On Wednesday afternoon, Harry refuses yet another potential Auror partner. He works so well on his own that Kingsley has sort of been letting him slide by, but now he warns him that it has been long enough that he should be moving on. He needs a partner, according to Kingsley, and he will have to settle on one soon enough before his patience wears thin. It’s not that Harry doesn’t want another partner, it’s just that he doesn’t want another partner. No one could ever replace Draco, and Harry knows this to be truer than anything else he has ever known. And none of this is fair, really, but he nods along and makes a promise to Shacklebolt that he knows he’ll never be able to keep.
"24 hours right? And then I'm free to go." Potter has shut his eyes, laid his head down on the pillow again. Draco thinks he should probably release him from his shackles now.
"Please tell us the nature of your relationship with Harry Potter." She starts. I open my mouth, fully intending to tell them I am a double agent who has been reporting to him for well over a year. But instead, what comes out is-
"Draco," he starts, and the look on his face is one I have come to recognize all too well. He feels guilty about something. My heart sinks into my stomach as I find the courage to continue looking into his eyes. "Please don't be angry with me..."
Potter smells like sunshine and fresh cut grass. I want to drown in his scent and stay like this forever, wrapped up in his arms and his love, listening to his heartbeat until we fall asleep together. I don't deserve it but I want it so desperately that my heart shatters into a million pieces. This isn't fair but nothing in this war has been so far.
“Uh no, but I am Harry Potter, the Auror that rescued him.” Harry answers, scratching the back of his neck in anticipation.
Figuring the toaster oven knows what it's doing, he makes his way into his living room and searches his rather messy book case for his Counseling degree. It's been years since he needed to show it to anyone, so he isn't quite sure where he's left it. He really should keep it in a safe spot. He isn't even sure that Potter will believe a piece of paper in the first place. But Potter spent a lot of his childhood in the muggle world, has spent some time in it lately, so there's a chance. He locates it in pristine condition and then makes his way back to the kitchen, where the toaster oven is smoking and it smells of burnt toast.
"That's very kind of you," I start, "but I want to be here when he wakes up." More uncomfortable silence. And then-
“Everything is going to be okay.” He whispers, even though he doesn’t know that for sure, and allows Draco to just cry in his arms. Later, when the blonde is calmer, he asks, “Does Tilda know about the cutting?”
“Oh yes,” Arthur replies, “Augustus is Annie’s great grandfather.” And Harry just stares at him, slack jawed.
Chapter Two: One Thing More
"Thank you, Malfoy." Potter says, as he sits up and stretches. The blanket has fallen below his pectorals, revealing tan, muscular skin that causes Draco's mouth to dry. He hadn't noticed last night because he was in such a panic. But of course Potter would look this good even with a drug problem and hungover from the night before. Messy dark locks of hair are jutting out from his head in a true Potter fashion. Draco wonders how he didn't just know it was him from the very first moment he saw him. He'd recognized him, true, but had assumed he was a Potter look alike.
Harry has become distracted by quite a few other cases, and as time goes by and he continues to come up empty handed on Dresden, his priorities begin to slowly shift away from him altogether. Draco begins to shift his focus as well, more toward his healing and trying to work toward getting reinstated as an Auror. He slowly starts to leave his flat more, begins to wake up at earlier times, and wears more than just his snitch pajamas. When Draco’s mind healer comes to visit, Harry makes himself scarce, always making sure to give them their privacy. Harry does his best to stay out of it, only comments on Draco’s progress here and there, and waits for him to open up on his own.
Once he has finished, he fears, very briefly, that these memories will one day fade into nothingness. The thought is so devastating he chokes back a sob. Ginny quietly climbs off of him before laying in the bed, legs propped up with the hopes in aiding his little swimmers to her waiting egg. Harry wonders if she feels anything anymore, if she enjoys their sex or if it's the idea of a baby that keeps her going. He doesn’t even know if she has been having orgasms lately.
"P-potter..." The voice is so faint that Harry almost believes he imagined it. He whips his head around, only to be met with the most beautiful and horrifying sight he has ever laid eyes on. Well, second most horrifying, anyway.
So when,
“Well…” The gears are turning in Mary’s head as she thinks. “I’m not sure if this would even be relevant but, Annie’s treatments were being paid for by an anonymous donor.”
He recognizes me almost instantly. I curse the wind for dislodging my hair from where it was neatly tucked in place underneath my hood. His wand begins to lower and he shakes his head.
"What-" He starts, but Malfoy interrupts.
It is much easier than I thought it would be at first, becoming a double agent, mainly because I am not in the inner circle and I don't hear a lot about big plans anyways. And it's easy to feel like I'm doing the right thing when all I witness are the evil acts taking place at the manor I used to call home.
When they arrive at the restaurant, Draco raises an eyebrow and stares at Harry incredulously. “This place Potter, really?” He immediately takes his robes off, revealing grey trousers, and a long sleeved sweater matching the blue color the robes were. Harry’s mouth waters at the sight.
“Just think things over,” Draco says finally, “and for now, we should keep things strictly business.” The bite to those words hurt Harry more than Draco could ever know.
“Oh uh, fine, for the most part.” Harry answers him.
I had visited my mother first. She chastised me for doing all of it alone, but I could see a proud glint in her eyes. She confessed to me that everything she did was to protect me, and once I was gone she didn't care whether she lived or died. She wanted to find Potter herself and kill him for what he did to me. But she knew it was a losing battle when they arrived at Hogwarts to have the Aurors and light-bringers waiting for them, so she took her anger out on Voldemort and the Death Eaters instead. My father was very brave, according to my mother, and he died valiantly.  That was another last straw for her, just one more reason to join the side of light. When she found out I was alive, it was all she could ever hope for. She asked me if the prophet article was true. I answered honestly because I was tired of lying and tired of hiding things from her. I admitted I wasn't sure what would happen now. She kissed me on the cheek and told me to go to him.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, “I’ll be right outside, I promise.”
“I didn’t really know it, myself, back then. Although there was always a part of me that
“I…I can’t stop cutting the scar,” he gasps through his tears, “no matter how hard I try, I can’t stop collecting the blood. There is something inside of me that just won’t allow me to stop. I don’t do anything with it, I swear, and I hate myself for even doing it in the first place.” Harry moves to him of his own accord. He casts a quick healing spell over the bleeding cut and a cleaning spell over the spilt blood on the dresser and carpet, and then wraps his arms around Draco. He has a million questions, and the Auror in him finds it hard to believe that there isn’t something more nefarious going on. But this is Draco, he reminds himself, the man he loves, and the man who is riddled with nightmares and feels he doesn’t even deserve to sleep on a bed anymore. But what if that guilt is more deserving than the other man lets on? Harry forces that thought away and chooses instead to be there for Draco. Draco has said before that his coping mechanisms are unhealthy. Perhaps this is just another one of those.
“Alright then.” She sighs, “You have one hour!” She says to his retreating back as he rushes to get to Draco once again.
“Right. But I’m glad…because…well, have you told anyone about the documents?”
When Draco first opens his eyes, Harry misses it. He is in the shower, after having put it off for much too long for fear of missing it when Draco awakes. He steps out of the steamy room to see Draco sitting up, eyes glistening as he nods at a Mediwitch standing in front of him. She is explaining things about the curse that Harry already knows. It’s the main Mediwitch that has been caring for him since day one.
Ron continues with questions but at this point Harry has zoned everything out and retreated deep within the recess of his mind. He is riddled with crippling guilt at the thought that he believed Draco could ever have been so evil as to willingly take part in anything like what this crazed lunatic was sitting here confessing to. He is so tired of feeling guilty, but he has felt it so long that he allows the feeling to give in to a more bone deep sort of tiredness and depression. He can’t help but think about the fact that Draco was carrying these horrible thoughts, these desires, these urges to cut himself and to kill and to sleep on the ground and continue this horrible thing he had been a part of,
The first few weeks are the hardest. Draco has a difficult time accepting just how much damage has been done to his body and magical core. He struggles with what he considers to be basic daily living skills, and has trouble allowing Harry to help him. But as the time passes, they settle into another sort of routine together. Draco’s days are filled with different types of rehabilitative therapy, focusing on fine and gross motor skills, as well as basic magical ability. He continues his sessions with his mind healer as well. Harry has been awarded 6 months paid leave for his efforts with the case, and he is grateful to have the time to help Draco to heal.
He finds himself standing at his door step a few minutes later, but hesitates just before his fist makes contact with the door. Should he really be bothering Draco right now? With no news? What will the blonde think of him just showing up like this, without word beforehand? Just as Harry decides he should tuck tail and leave, the front door opens, and there stands a slightly unkempt Draco Malfoy. And Harry can’t help himself, his breath hitches, and his heart hurts with the pain of not having been able to see him this past week. He takes in the sight of him, hair hanging in wet tangles, and a bathrobe wrapped tightly around him, smooth skin on his chest peeking through. The fresh smell of sandalwood that brings back so many memories. Harry reels from the emotion of it all. There will never be a time where he wouldn’t find him to be absolutely beautiful. There will never be a time where he could stop loving him.
Chapter 5: When we Burst
"Potter," I greet him warily.
“Probably visiting Annie, I reckon.” Arthur says distantly, already back to his poking and prodding.
“Fine then.” Draco says, “If you’re done…I’m starving and I’d like to eat now.” But he makes no move to get up from his seat. And he really doesn’t look like he’s been eating much these days anyways.
“Hullo, Harry.” Ginny says as she steps inside the flat, eyes roaming around the tiny living room and then coming back to meet Harry’s. There is a sparkle in her light brown eyes, one that Harry hasn’t seen before. Divorce has suited her, it seems. Draco drops his toast from where he sits at the dining room table, causing Ginny’s eyes to flicker back to him momentarily.
"You're late." He looks almost worried about me. I shake that thought away. He probably just doesn't want his time to be wasted. We've been at this for 8 months now, and this is the first time I haven't made it on time. He should really cut me some slack.
!" He stops dead at the sight before him. Harry is stood shaking like a leaf, holding a very tiny and very unconscious Draco Malfoy in his arms. They stare intently at each other before the red head finally asks-
"A nightmare? Again?" The bite to her words sting him for just a moment. Behind his eyes there are momentary flashes of platinum hair, a smile, and then smooth pale limbs being torn apart. He shudders. It’s more of a memory, but he doesn’t feel like correcting her. There isn’t a point in doing so, not anymore.
"What have you done?" I ask, hands going numb.
"You're being reckless Potter, bound to get yourself killed! And if they find out I was anywhere near the vicinity of your death, you bet your ass they'll somehow find a way to pin it on me. So yes, Potter, I'm involved now whether you like it or not."
“I think that’s a great idea.” Harry says, reaching out to give his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“Does she now?” Draco laughs, “how convenient for you.”
“How does chicken Marsala sound?” Harry asks, grabbing a shopping cart and waving at a cashier that has noticed him. He tries to remain casual although his insides feel as though they are being ripped apart and glued back together, over and over again. The pain medications that Malfoy gave him don’t seem to be working, and for a second Harry worries with sickening dread that Malfoy has been giving him placebos to trick him into having to stay longer than 24 hours. He really isn’t sure what will happen if he fails to keep his cool, he hasn’t asked and he probably won’t need to, as he’ll be fine. Malfoy seems to ponder that for a moment, before a dark look crosses his features. He clears his throat, and Harry already has thrown mushrooms and chicken breasts into their cart by the time he answers.
“Have you been to the hospital?” Draco asks him, standing up swiftly and coming to sit next to him, a glint of determination in his eyes. Harry is momentarily distracted by the fresh scent of sandalwood assaulting his nostrils and the warmth emanating off of Draco in waves. He wants to press closer so that they’re touching, but holds back. As much as Draco seems to know Harry, Harry knows Draco just as well, and he knows that Draco has tunnel vision right now revolving around the case.
“No, payments were being sent to our billing department directly but…” Mary says quietly, “a few days ago the payments just suddenly stopped, and we have no way of contacting the donor. And Annie’s parents are both deceased. She has no way of continuing the payments for her treatments, considering how expensive they are. And with how advanced her condition has become…” The words hang in the air between them.
“No, he didn’t touch me, he couldn’t or he would break the ritual – it was all those children, he-“
"You can't make that promise when you've already broken one!" I yell at him. I’m only getting started. "You KNOW they will find out about EVERYTHING. You know Voldemort will KILL my mother and father! Why would you do this? You KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEIR SAFETY IS TO ME!" I scream with such force that I am certain someone outside of the walls of my puny room has heard me.
“We don’t have to-“ Harry starts, but Draco cuts him off.
“You can thank Draco for that, he cooked everything for dinner today, from scratch.” He tells her, and Ginny nods in approval.
, just knowing you were going back to your wife every night.” Draco looks away again, takes a sip of his drink. The waiter comes back over to take their orders, and everything just feels forced now, the way both men smile politely and nod obligingly at the waiter for what feels like hours until he finally leaves them alone again.
"Why don't you go home and get some rest? This turned out better than we could ever have hoped... plus, now that you’ve got your revenge and the added bonus of rescuing a very much alive Malfoy… maybe the nightmares will finally stop." Of course Ron knows about the nightmares. Ginny probably told Hermione about them. Harry wonders what else his friend knows about his personal life. It’s not that he directly is trying to keep secrets from Ron, it’s more so the fact that it’s embarrassing for him to admit these things at times.
“Ummm well, no pattern, really. They were all pretty young, I’d say under 13. There was no specific skin color or identifiers that he went for…but, come to think of it, they were all dressed pretty strangely.”
At work, Harry is surprised to learn from Ron and Hermione that Ginny hasn’t told any of the Weasleys why they’ve decided to get a divorce. She has only disclosed to them that it is amicable, which until that point Harry hadn’t been sure was the case. Ron checks on him periodically, telling him he is there for him if he wants to talk about it. Sometimes he encourages Harry to win Ginny back, which is only awkward and pulls at Harry’s heartstrings in an awful manner. Harry just tells him that isn’t going to happen, and promises he will talk to him when he is ready. Ron seems to take this in stride, and he is patient enough for the moment. Hermione, on the other hand, keeps giving him these calculating, knowing looks that make Harry feel really uncomfortable, so he mostly spends his time avoiding her. He has a sinking feeling that she has him completely figured out, and he is not ready to face that fact.
Harry decides to head back to his office to check in and do some research to kill the time. When they had arrived back at the hospital, after another miserable 30 minutes of eating in tense silence, Draco had been discharged on the grounds of allowing a mind healer to see him at his flat for sessions twice weekly. They decided that if Draco thinks of anything he can call on Harry, but for now he is just going to focus on getting settled at home.
“Yes.” He nods enthusiastically for good measure.
“Yeah…you asked me i-if-“ Harry starts, but he has trouble finishing his sentence.
“Go on, then.” Draco tells him resolutely, “let me know what you discover.” It’s such a complete distinction from the happy Draco that he saw moments ago, that Harry wonders if perhaps Draco has some sort of mood disorder. He considers asking how the mind healer appointments have been going, but thinks better of it. Instead, he nods before stretching languidly and forcing himself to rise from the comfortable couch.
On Draco’s third week of being home, their wards sense an unauthorized visitor. The knock at the door is so unexpected, Harry jumps from it. He has memorized Draco’s therapy routine, and today is supposed to be his one day off. The other man’s eyes are wide as he looks at him.
Their strides are wide and feet land heavy as they trudge out of the ministry and into the open air. It's sunny out, with the sky clearer than it has been in a really long time. Neither man stops to appreciate this fact. For Harry, it’s much too painful to think about the last time the sky was so sunny. Instead, they Apparate to an empty alleyway.
“Merlin, Ginny, I’m so sorry,” he starts, and he means it, for once. But she is shaking her head.
"You must be very scared," she starts, and I am, in more ways than she could ever imagine. "But we want to help you. Your friend, Harry, has told us some things about you that make a great case for pardoning you. But we need you to cooperate with us, okay Draco?"
We talk a bit longer than usual. Potter cracks a few jokes and I smile indulgently. It's weird, how easily we get along, but at the same time it's perfectly normal. Potter's eyes flash briefly to my mouth and then back into my eyes again. He reaches out, lifts the sleeve on my left arm, exposing my dark mark. I try to pull away but he holds my arm, strokes the mark with his fingers, never breaking eye contact. It feels so good I want to swoon, but I keep my composure.
He looks at me expectantly. I don't want this moment to be ruined but the alarm bells are going off in my head. "Potter, I need you to promise me something." My gaze is open and vulnerable as we stare at each other underneath the moonlight.
"We can go to the grocery store today, pick up some things for lunch and dinner, maybe grab you some clothes, since you'll be staying the night." Draco surprises even himself at the words that come out of his mouth. He has just suggested a public outing with his childhood nemesis. He rationalizes it, tells himself he wants to observe Potter at a setting where he has access to alcohol, even in his home where he may have access to drugs. The truth is, time may have softened him. As much as he is loath to admit that to himself. Is he being kind for kindness sake?
Draco is
"I've contacted the Aurors...they'll be here in a few minutes." The sting of betrayal is so strong that I am forced to take in a shocked breath of air.
“He was studying this complicated spell Potter, it was all part of some kind of ancient ritual. He wouldn’t talk to me for days on end, but when he did it was out of boredom, and he would tell me little tidbits. Like the fact that my pure blood was helping to “heal” his, and that he had to start the spell with a complicated curse that tore me apart but kept me alive. He said it took months to get that right, which he had to practice on a lot of innocent people. And another time he told me he “owed” the spell, and that’s why the children had to die. Blood for blood, he would say. He was ill, I think, and the worst part is…over time, he seemed to be improving, like the spell was actually fucking working.”
“Hi,” Draco rasps, coughs, clears his throat, and tries again, “Hey.” He says more clearly. The Mediwitch smiles in Harry’s direction.
With a crack, he disapparates, leaving me alone to ponder that sentiment.
“Harry, please, talk to me.” She begs. Her hand reaches across the table toward his own, but she hesitates and then pulls it back, folding her hands tightly atop the table instead. Harry owes her the truth. He owes Draco the truth. He owes himself the truth. This will be a hard conversation to have but it will be good for all of them in the end, won’t it?
“Take me home.” He says tiredly, and Harry nods against him. He would do anything for him. This is an easy request. He helps Draco get to his feet, and then hands him his cane. Draco scoffs at first, but quickly realizes he needs it, then leans heavily against it as he takes his first wobbly steps.
"Here’s what is going to happen. He will put up a fight, and you'll have no choice. It's what we will say either way. I'm with you mate, 100%. I want to see that fucker pay for what he did." Ron finally removes his hand from Harry's shoulder and Harry releases the breath he hadn't realized he was holding. He is secretly thrilled by Ron's words. Harry has never wanted anything more than this. Well, maybe one or two things, but both were too painful to think about.
Harry doesn't know how to answer that. True, it could seem odd from Malfoy's point of view. Malfoy's been missing from the Wizarding world for years now, and no one bothered to look for him. He didn't exactly recover very well after the war. Harry remembers reading about it in the papers. His father locked in Azkaban, mother off in France somewhere, and Malfoy himself, disappeared. At the time, Harry thought maybe he went to France with his mother. He didn't put much thought into it after that. The world just kept spinning.
She mimics him angrily, jarring his memory. He remembers saying the words, remembers that he wasn’t listening when he agreed to whatever it was.
Draco is standing in the middle of the bedroom, sleeve drawn up on his left arm, right hand holding his wand, which is pointed at his left arm. He has cast a cutting curse on his arm, and the same scar that Dresden left on him is now open as blood flows from it into a cup on a dresser that Draco leans over. Harry simply stands there like a fish out of water, trying desperately to process what he is seeing into anything even resembling normal.
. I don’t want to be a part of hurting anyone, either, not ever again. I’ve already spoken to my mother about this, not about us but about my sexuality and my desires to be out and open, and although she isn’t thrilled, she is willing to accept me for who I really am.” Draco’s eyes are almost pleading with Harry, but Harry isn’t sure what he is pleading for, exactly.
Potter backs away just enough to disrobe me, and my hands mirror his actions on his own clothes. He pushes me roughly so that I land on my back on the wet earth beneath me. Wildflowers surround us, the scent sickly sweet in the damp air as I gasp for breath. He pulls a small bottle out from his robe pocket and opens it. I watch, mesmerized, as he tips clear liquid onto his fingers. Potter then proceeds to stretch himself wide open above me. He gasps with pleasure and I almost come undone. My hands are on whatever bit of skin I can reach. I am rock hard beneath him as he tips the lubricant over my cock, slathering from tip to base.
"No you don't, Potter, trust me."
"Are you real?" Draco asks, reaching a chained arm out toward Harry as if he were a lighthouse out at sea. Harry doesn't have a chance to answer before the blonde man promptly loses consciousness. Harry barely makes it in time to catch him. He is simultaneously ecstatic to be touching the other man and appalled at how little he weighs. He casts enervate several times, but it doesn’t seem to do much for him. Damn his shitty medic skills!
Draco turns around underneath him and gets onto his hands and knees. Harry is awestruck by the sight, and he clumsily tips the bottle onto his fingers. He works gently to stretch the other man’s opening, relishing at the way he thrusts against his fingers and encourages Harry to go harder and faster. His cock twitches against his stomach with arousal, and it’s all he can do to stay focused, to make sure he doesn’t jump the gun and end up hurting Draco with his enthusiasm. His free hand alternately rubs circles into Draco’s back and squeezes his hip eagerly. When Draco cranes his neck to stare daggers at Harry, telling him to
“Okay, that’s good, strangely how?”
“You need to talk to her. I think she’s just waiting to hear you apologize, at this point.” Ron looks a bit sympathetic, but he is stern with his words, fingers digging slightly into Harry’s collarbone.
Harry knows wholeheartedly that it doesn’t matter. He can never stop loving Draco Malfoy. And now that the man is alive, well it complicates things all over again. Harry remembers how hard it was to live the lie he was a part of, and honestly they hadn’t been doing it for very long before the attack. Yet, every fiber of his being is alive with electricity. He wants to jump up for joy, he wants to sing out loud, he wants to laugh as loud as his lungs can handle. Instead, he looks at Ron with the kindest eyes he can muster.
When he arrives at home, however, Ginny isn’t anywhere to be found. Harry makes a kettle of tea and waits a bit for her, deciding to tidy up while he’s at it. After an hour or so, he gets anxious and elects to go ahead and look for her. His first stop is the Burrow. It’s relatively empty, which almost looks strange to Harry. Arthur sits at the dining room table with a mug of coffee, trying to pick apart a Muggle toaster. He smiles at Harry as he steps through the floo.
“I’m alright, I think.” Draco says, and Harry knows it’s a lie, judging from the way Draco is chewing his bottom lip worriedly.
“But you still went after him. You didn’t give up on me.” Draco says slowly, “Potter he, he was using some seriously fucked up blood magic, from the ancient days.” His eyes have taken on a steely resonance that shocks Harry to his core. He is once again hopeful that all is not lost.
“I know, I know, I just…god I fucked things up so bad.” Harry sighs, rubbing at his temples with his fingers. And he means it in more ways than one.
“Oh, that won’t be necessary, thank you.” Draco tells her, taking the paperwork from her hands and looking it over. She smiles serenely and holds the door open as Harry and Draco make their way out. Once they hit the apparition point, Harry reaches an arm out for Draco to take. He eyes the arm as if it is attached to an alien for a few minutes before sighing and grabbing hold. Harry has a feeling the healing process is going to feel much longer than a year.
"Progress all made without the consent of the ministry, if I have to remind you."
“How the fuck do you know that?” He asks incredulously. Harry indicates at his pocket, where the shrunken pile of documents is hidden. Draco nods minutely, allowing Harry to reach in and remove the now tiny stack of papers.
I so appreciate all of your thoughts and comments. It's been a blast!
"Potter." His heart stops at the familiar voice uttering his given name. He hadn't even realized he wasn't alone. He whips his head to the side and sees the angel from last night, standing tall in the doorway, eyes blazing. Fragments of the events from last night swirl in his head, a confusing, muddled mess. He squeezes his eyes shut, tries not to panic.
doesn’t have the clearance to start divulging Dresden’s name to the general public, he thinks he can go ahead and bend the rules just this once. It’s just Arthur, and honestly Harry thought that Ron or Ginny would have told him Dresden’s name by now anyway. What would be the harm? They are about to announce Dresden’s name to the public any second now, probably, and in that case it won’t even matter.
“Mr. Potter,” she says, “I was just about to fill Mr. Malfoy in on what to expect now that he’s awake. Physical therapy twice per week, and occupational therapy once per week, to start. Magical core therapy will be more intensive in the beginning, and we recommend at least three times per week for the first three months.” Harry has heard this before. He looks nervously at Draco, who is nodding so much he reminds Harry of a muggle bobble head toy. Harry doesn’t miss the tight line of Draco’s lips, nor the tension in his eyebrows that gives away his distress.
“Well yes…” She starts, “you were on official Auror business. I just didn’t think you should be disturbed.” She perks up, as if her answer would satisfy Harry. It served to simply do the opposite.
“He did this once every few weeks. He took a little of my blood and drained a child of theirs. He stored it and drank it until he ran out and would need more. He would always do it in front of me and then just leave their bodies there, rotting, until the smell got to him or he killed the next one. And sometimes he would – place them right next to me, just for the shits and giggles. The first one, he sat him up next to me and told me if I even tried to push him away he would kill me.” Draco’s eyes are dark and hollow, fixated on nothing in particular as he recalls the brutal details.
"They let you in here?" I ask stupidly. He gives me a sheepish look. "
"The fuck it doesn't, Potter. Do you even remember what happened last night?!" It all comes flooding back, the panic and the hatred and the cold, hard ground against his face. The flick of a cigarette, shocked grey eyes. Harry shuts his eyes against the torrent of emotions, gasps for breath.
"Well then, do me a favor, Potter," I tell him. He pulls away enough to look me intensely in the eyes. He looks a little put off. I guess my requests so far have been very unpleasant.
Each other letters contain research and information revolving around the ritual.
The next week trickles by without much excitement. It feels slower than usual for Harry, who works almost obsessively on the lead he has, desperately trying to make a tricky incantation work properly. It is proving frustrating, but he is so close he can almost taste his revenge.
"My degree is on the table," he says distractedly, "along with my ID, if you want to take a look." He hears shuffling, presumably it's Potter inspecting the documents. He hears a rather loud and unbecoming snort from the table.
"I'm surprised you have the ability," I tell him, but it sounds too friendly even to me. He gives a slight chuckle at that.
“Potter….I can’t let you buy alcohol, even if it’s for cooking purposes. How about chicken with mushroom sauce? I do love mushrooms.” He says it awkwardly, but his voice doesn’t lack any conviction. Harry is mortified, hoping desperately that no one has overheard. So plan B has been foiled. Plan C is to hope desperately that he’s got a pill or two leftover from last night’s festivities in his pants pocket at Malfoy’s place. The odds so far have not been in his favor. He catches himself rubbing his temples, teeth clenched as Malfoy stares at him with concern.
“She is due next week!” She says breathlessly. Then turns back toward Ron. “Come along, Ronald!” She tells him. Ron stands abruptly and shuffles awkwardly past Harry, without a look or a goodbye. Harry can only hope that Hermione is as much of a know-it-all as she claims to be. It would hurt greatly if he were to lose his best friend now. Especially after something he has agonized over for the past three years at least.
Silence fills the room as everyone’s interests are peaked. Draco thinks for a moment before a wide smile plays across his lips. “It’s blue, like my pajamas!” He exclaims. With a soft click, the snitch opens. Draco peers inside of it and gasps for the second time, pulling out a white gold wedding band. The words “D & H forever” are engraved on the inside of it.  He stares at it in shocked silence, and Harry feels like he can cut the tension in the room with a knife.
“I really like it, actually.” He replies, and he means it. Draco stiffens back up ever so slightly, eyes taking on a forlorn sort of look, lips frowning again.
And Harry was just sitting there judging him the entire time, secretly suspicious of his every move. Harry can only hope that Draco never realized what he was thinking.
"I will
"They won't believe me. I’m a Death Eater, and no amount of Veritaserum will ever change that."
Harry freezes in his tracks. Well fuck, maybe Arthur can help him, after all. And although Harry knows that he
“The news is that there is no news.” Harry supplies, scrubbing at his hair nervously. And if looks could kill… “I mean, I’ve exhausted almost all possible avenues. I can’t find squat on Dresden. It’s like the man never existed. Ron is coming up short on the blood ritual…and I was wondering, maybe we could take a look at the Manor’s library-“
I look back up at him. Huge mistake. Tears are streaming down his face and he shakes his head vigorously. I am aching. Aching for him and for my selfish need to live and to get to love him for just a little longer.
“Draco I…”
At some point Weasley and Granger visit. It's horribly uncomfortable for all of us. They stare at my hand over Potter's for way too long. Granger clears her throat and gives Weasley a pointed look. He responds by giving her a pained expression and then looking at me gravely. His apology is stilted, rehearsed, but in the end I nod my acceptance to him, citing that he couldn't possibly have known. His shoulders seem to sag in relief at that. Granger thanks me with tears in her eyes, sputters out her own apology, even attempts an awkward hug, all of which I allow her to do. I tell her it's okay, and then I thank them both for looking out for Potter. And while I don't agree with all the methods the light-bringers used during battle, they were the only group that really seemed to get anything done.
He would get notes in return, Potter, I saw a few times when he thought I was asleep, but I could never quite make out the words. So those documents weren’t banished, they were sent to his partner, I bet.” Harry starts to wonder about some of the things Draco is telling him. Perhaps he is confused, as the Mediwitch mentioned when he first woke up. To think that someone from the Ministry, specifically, was helping Augustus…that seemed to Harry to be a touch of paranoia. And then the whole thing about the kids.
"Idiot boy!" Severus is on us in a flash. He pushes me out of the way. It happens so fast but it feels like slow motion to me for some reason. He points his wand at Dumbledore, says the words I could never in a million years bring myself to utter. My ears ring with the sound of Dumbledore's lifeless body as it hits the floor. Severus is saying something to me but I can't hear anything other than this ringing. I stand there, numb, all of my hopes at possible redemption are shattered with the death of the one person who could see me for who I really am.
“Don’t tell Kingsley,” he pleads quietly, “I’ve been doing so well and…he is coming over tomorrow to discuss the possibility of me going back to work, of being your partner again.” Draco’s eyes alight with so much hope, that Harry fights back his own tears. The prospect of having his partner back fills him with so many mixed emotions that he can barely keep up with his own feelings.
he would have an invisibility cloak and
“But I did Potter, and regardless of whether it would have killed me or not, I was never going to harm another child.”
“Harry…” Draco starts, “open your gift.” He says softly. Harry watches as Draco closes his hand around the ring, and looks over at the gift sitting in front of his crossed legs. He ignores the pain in his heart and the sting in his eyes as does what he is told. The irony is not lost to him as he watches the golden snitches zoom across the wrapping paper. With shaky hands, he unwraps it to reveal a small, black velvety box. Finally understanding, he opens the box and finds a white gold wedding band inside. Harry’s heart soars as the room fills with applause. He grabs Draco and kisses him harder than is probably acceptable for a family function, but he doesn’t care.
“Did you know he was related to Annie?” Harry follows up.
. He is dressed in semi-formal robes that don't seem to really fit snug enough. He is gorgeous, yet so fragile it tears Harry's heart apart.
Report out of the way, he makes a few official preliminary notes regarding follow up, leaving the part about someone working with Dresden out of it. He then looks into the situation with the missing children. What he finds is terrifying. In the Muggle world, Dresden is being called “the Lamia,” based off of an ancient Greek myth about a woman who transformed into a child-killing monster after her own children were killed by the Greek God called Zeus. 35 children were taken, all of them going missing anywhere from 3 days to a few weeks, and all of them randomly showing up again, tucked into their beds, or doing something mundane such as sitting on the toilet at their home, lifeless and drained of blood. Harry feels sick to his stomach. So Dresden was returning the bodies, which is interesting.
Once he has done a quick visual sweep of the place, he pulls out his wand and begins to cast basic diagnostic locator spells, knowing full well that they would probably bring up no results, but acting from muscle memory all the same. It is comforting to do something familiar like this, and it honestly makes him feel a sense of accomplishment, however small. That is why Harry’s eyebrows rise into his hairline in surprise when the spell locates two rather large stacks of documents that had clearly not been there before. He immediately begins to rifle through the documents, and finds neatly scrawled notes describing the blood ritual in great detail. Bits of papers have been taken out of books from all over the world in all types of languages, having been compiled through extensive research. Letters in a different handwriting have been collected in chronological order, held together in a thick stack, all of them signed “
Harry lands a little shaky on his feet. Ron clamps a hand on his shoulder to help steady him. He speaks, probably to fill the awkward silence between them as they wait their few minutes for the incantation spell to pinpoint and send them to their desired location.
for someone. I can’t be a part of this adulterous relationship with you. I want to be free, and open, and I don’t want to
"Potter, stop, I'm not going to hurt you." The angel says, and Harry can hear some shuffling steps as he presumably steps closer to him.
“Thank you Ginevra, it’s nice to see you.” He grabs for his cane and moves to stand.
“No after that,” Draco tells him, “I told you that it looks like we’re just going to have to buy a much bigger home. And then you carried on looking like a kicked Crup. It was alarming, really, when you should be smiling and hugging and kissing me and all that lot.”
On the twenty-ninth night, their comfortable, sexy little bubble finally pops. Harry finishes his work on a case early, and Apparates into the apartment without a second thought. Draco is not in the kitchen, which is where Harry usually finds him. It’s become a bit of an unspoken routine, in which Draco has taken a liking to cooking dinners for them on weeknights. There are various food prep items out on the counter, so Harry knows Draco still plans to cook, it is probably just too early for him to actually get started. He removes his shoes and coat before making his way into their bedroom so he can grab a shower in the master bath. He never anticipates the scene that he actually walks in on.
"I'm going to talk to them Draco, I'll make sure none of the information gets out to Voldemort. Please, Draco, they'll have to believe us because everything else you have ever told me has been helpful. You won't be able to lie under Veritaserum." He is pleading, on his knees before me. I want to slap him and hurt him and scoop him up in my arms at the same time. But this, this is too painful, too much of a betrayal for me to back down.
Draco clears his throat. “The truth?” He asks, his voice husky. He doesn’t look away from Harry as he speaks, doesn’t move at all.
“Honey, listen, please calm down-“ He takes a few steps closer to her, arms outstretched.
“What I’m saying Harry, is that I don’t want to do this alone. I don’t want to deal with shitty custody arguments and the likes. I believe we can co-parent like mature adults.” Harry’s eyes flash momentarily to Draco, and through his blurry, tear filled vision he sees the other man staring intently into his mug, eyes slightly wide.  “Draco can be involved to whatever extent you deem fit. It only makes sense given that whomever I choose as a partner will be involved as well.” Ginny carries on, noticing Harry’s glance at the blonde man who has undoubtedly heard all of this. “All that matters now is this life growing inside of me Harry. For his sake, we need to make this work.”
"I refuse to let you become another victim of this war." He says, chin jutting outward as he stares me down determinedly. If my arms were free I would punch him with all my might. As it were, the only thing I can do is head-butt him, which he easily deflects before backing up smartly away from me.
"Draco," she starts, "I wanted to let you know that you have officially been pardoned. Your information was correct and very useful to our cause." Her small, well-manicured hand reaches out to me. I clasp it with my own and allow her to pull me up haphazardly. This is good news. I should be relieved. So why do I feel so gutted?
The third time that we meet up to exchange information, Potter is friendlier than usual. Since my information has checked out each time thus far, he seems to be in higher spirits. He touches my elbow briefly and leans toward me as I speak to him. We have an arrangement to meet once monthly in a secret outdoor location of his specifications. I am ashamed but his simple touch lights my nerve endings on fire. Potter is stunning. He is committed and so determined. He radiates strength and righteousness and he believes in me. It's all I could ever hope for. I'm sure that's all it is. He represents hope and freedom and a world without Voldemort in it. It's nothing more than that.
“Bed,” he tells him, and Harry picks him up easily, Draco wrapping his legs around him as their mouths press once again. Draco’s tongue slips hotly into Harry’s mouth, and Harry staggers momentarily at the delicious distraction. He sits Draco down on the freshly made bed, breaking the kiss to trail his tongue down the other man’s neck. Draco groans, hands tightening in Harry’s hair before sliding down to his clothing. He begins to pull and tug at Harry’s clothes, and Harry helps him to strip himself. Both men now naked, Harry places his hands on Draco’s chest and nudges him gently down onto the bed.
On Sunday, Harry and Ginny have dinner with the Weasleys, as is also their weekly routine. Ron and Hermione sit next to them at the table. Molly fusses over Harry, joking with Ginny that she doesn't feed him enough. Harry supposes that maybe his appetite hasn't been the same as it was, but it's nothing to really be all that concerned about. Hermione gives Harry a sympathetic look, and he wonders what that is all about. Ron shovels food in his mouth at top speed. They are joined by Ginny's other siblings and their children. Hermione touches her own swollen belly as she watches the kids play. He sees the look of sullen jealousy on his wife's face. Just another typical Sunday.
“Harry, why the fuck is Kingsley Shacklebolt tied to a chair in Draco’s bedroom?” Hermione smiles wryly at Harry, who does his best to return it in kind. She places her hand on Ron’s shoulder and hands him the documents, picture first. His eyes widen in recognition.
"Why don't you let me make something? I'm a pretty good cook." He finally says, minutes after staring down at the now cold charcoal briquettes on the plate.
"Draco, what is it?" He asks, looking down at me. The sun is setting, casting soft shadows among the trees surrounding us. Streaks of sunlight dance across his ashen face as he studies me.
"Okay then. I'll ransack the place and see what I can find. You take him down. I know you want your vengeance, Harry." Ron's eyes are searching Harry's, and in the bright clear light of the day it's too much. Harry looks away.
There is a moment of tense silence as each of us marvels at the idea that I could ever thank anyone for anything. Let alone Potter's little sidekicks.
"Well after I visited you in your cell I realized that if I did die, you would most likely spend your life in Azkaban. So I sought out the Prophet, promising exclusive details in exchange for them keeping it a complete secret and delaying the publishing until after the battle. I knew that with that article you would have to be pardoned no matter what."  He says it so nonchalantly, as if we were only discussing the weather.
My wand is pointed right at Dumbledore. My heart pounds uncontrollably in my chest and my breathing betrays my fear. My hand shakes ever so slightly as I will myself to speak the words I know I'll never be able to say. I am just a boy. A boy who has seen too much and who has realized he is not cut out for the darkness his parents expect of him.
Draco seems to think for a moment, eyes glazing over in that same perturbing way they had earlier in the day. He starts ticking things off on his fingers as he speaks, words going almost a mile a minute.  “I know for a fact that Dresden needed a pureblood Wizard of ancient lineage for the ritual. “Pure blood for pure blood” he would always say. And he needed me to think I had died in order to start the process, which is why he used the cutting curse. The cutting curse caused me to bleed a lot, which I think he took a deep sort of pleasure in, but I’m not entirely convinced the cutting curse itself had to be used for it, just the part where I had to believe I was dead. “
"Good," he says into my neck, "now pass me the Prophet, I wanna see the article."
“Hi Arthur, I’m fine thanks. How about you?” He replies politely. Arthur wipes some sweat from his brow.
"Why should I trust you?" Harry says, but he regrets that, because he knows deep down inside that if it hadn't been for Malfoy last night, something terrible would have happened to him, something he may not have been able to come back from.
Harry has the decency to try and look affronted. "You have no idea what you're talking about." He says it calmly, with every ounce of intimidation left within him, and it seems to work. Malfoy takes a breath, his eyebrows crease. Maybe, Harry thinks, it's working. But then Malfoy relaxes, raises an eyebrow.
“Uh, no, not yet…”
Thankfully, Draco decides that he does, indeed, like the cushioning charm, much to Harry’s relief. He also seems to like talking to Harry about more intimate subjects, and it’s a beautiful and wondrous thing. This only seems to aid in Draco’s healing process, and Harry notices a fundamental shift in Draco’s overall demeanor. He just seems happier all around, and by the twentieth night, he changes the wards to accommodate Harry, allowing him to Apparate in and out as he pleases.
"Holy fucking shit! This can't be happening!" He yells loudly to himself, trying to calm his breathing. Okay, now he is absolutely certain it's Harry
“Augustus he – pulled out his wand, aimed it at the boy – and he-he slit his throat right in front of me. He collected his blood in a bucket, added the cup with my blood in it, mixed it together with some kind of incantation, and started drinking it. He laughed at me the entire time because I screamed… I couldn’t help it. I was terrified and disgusted.”
"I should be asking you the same question," when Malfoy speaks, his voice is melted velvet. Masculine, smooth, and somehow so soft. Gone is the arrogance that Harry remembers. "Why is it that the Wizarding World's Golden Boy suddenly shows up at the same establishment that I have frequented for years?"
"Ready?" He asks me, as we stand holding hands in the apparition point of the hospital.
“He was conferring with someone, through the floo. And sending documents
Draco stands nervously beside him. He shifts his weight from side to side, a pained expression on his face. Harry takes a deep breath and forces himself to calm down. He needs to be strong for both of them in this moment. Draco looks as if he will fall apart at any minute, his movements becoming more and more unsteady as the time passes by.  He staggers heavily toward the dresser, taking deep breaths and righting himself on it.
My grin is wide as I disapparate without a word in return.
"I hope they made me look good." He says.
"I see the way you look at me, Malfoy," he says, voice laced with something unrecognizable.  I shut my eyes involuntarily.
"I'm in love with him." The Aurors sputter a bit, with the female glancing over at the double mirror briefly before looking back at me. I realize that Potter is most likely behind that glass, watching. It isn't anything Potter didn't already know, but I have never said as much out loud to him before. I take a deep breath and begin to elaborate. "I mean, that's not all. I have been sharing information with him in order to help the side of the light."
When they arrive, Draco is unable to hold himself up. He bites down on his lip and grunts against his pain, limbs shaking with strain. He looks to Harry with fear and desperation. Harry feels as though the world is unravelling before his eyes. A Healer and mediwitch meet them at the entrance with a chair and begin to wheel Draco inside. Harry struggles with the conflict of staying with Draco or going back to the flat to deal with Shacklebolt. He doesn’t want Shacklebolt to have any opportunity to get away, but at the same time, he knows he needs to be here for Draco.
“So what’s next, mate?” Ron asks him around a mouthful of pudding.
“It’s awful Harry! The blood ritual is an ancient ritual that uses the blood of purebloods and the blood of the ‘tainted innocent,’ which is why Muggle children are used, because they are considered tainted yet innocent. The ritual detoxifies the blood over time but it takes two years to complete. The information on the ritual is so scarce that they had to find bits of information that were scattered all over the world. Draco would have carried the ritual on eventually at risk of dying if he fought against it, but by the time it was complete, he would most likely have died anyway, as it’s a lot for the body to take.”  She chatters on, taking bites of curry in between and swallowing gulps of pumpkin juice. Harry finds it hard to focus on her words. He glances back at Ron, who at least has his mouth fully closed now, jaw set, eyes staring angrily at the wall. Harry blanches and faces Hermione again, who continues to speak in the animated way she always does when she finds a subject fascinating. When it gets to be too much, Harry feels compelled to interrupt her.
"Draco," he says it so quietly I have to strain to hear him. My name hangs from his lips for a few moments. I consider saying something to fill the tense silence but he speaks again before I have the chance. "I have to get you out of here....they won't listen to reason…they want blood." He says the last word with a sob.
"It will be okay," he starts, "I promise, Draco, please listen to me..."
His nightly routine remains almost the same, save for the fact that this week Ginny is ovulating. This means that after dinner, they retreat to the bedroom. Harry lays in silence as his wife bobs along on top of him. She is beautiful in the pale moonlight. Harry knows he should be captivated by her beauty, that he should feel at least some kind of attraction to her. She is lovely, pale smooth skin glistening, perky breasts bouncing delicately, and long, fiery curls cascading down her shoulder. Her eyes are closed, mouth formed in a slight "o".
“Hermione….are you even going to say anything about what I just told you?” He asks, and she blinks at him, looking sheepish.
“I’ve got two vials, Ginny, one for me and one for you.” Harry’s voice is calm and level as he speaks to her, “I’m sure there are things you’d like to ask me too.” He pushes one of the vials across the table toward her. Ginny, who had stood abruptly just moments before, sits back down and stares hard at the vial. She reaches forward, bypasses the one Harry has pushed toward her, and grabs the one that is closer to Harry.
“Right,” Draco says, “I’m sorry Potter…I’m just…” He trails off. Harry only continues to look at him patiently, nodding reassuringly, rubbing his hands softly. Draco finally lets out a small chuckle. “I didn’t think it would be this hard.”
"And what about...?" I trail off. My hands begin to sweat as her face takes on that sadness it had when she first came in.
"Are you...blaming me for what happened to me?!" Harry asks against his pounding headache and sour stomach. He wants to just lay his head back on the comfortable pillow and go back to sleep, everything suddenly feels much too heavy and suffocating.
“I don’t know what I was thinking,” Draco says tiredly next to him, “sleeping on the floor when I had such a fantastic bed.” There is a slight chuckle, but something more in his voice, a sort of fleeting uncertainty that Harry recognizes instantly.
“You look…” Harry lets the statement hang in the air.
Ron simply nods and sighs. Harry knows that Ron understands how thankful he really is. He was there for all of the late nights, the (to his embarrassment) shed tears, and the tireless work to hunt down Augustus. Harry watches his retreating back until he can no longer see the taller man. He gets up and sends Ginny an owl:
Harry hesitates, swallows, and then begins hurling spells toward him, all easily deflected. He curses under his breath. He has no idea where Ron is. He remembers how powerless he was to help Draco when he had been hit by Dresden’s cutting curse, wonders if it will be the same this time around, wonders why he didn’t train better for this part. At this time it seems that Augustus is only concerned with vanishing his documents, and not so much at attacking Harry.  Harry is fuming at how easily the wizard blocks his spells. He notices now that all of the documents are gone. Harry is livid, that could have been amazing evidence for his case!
