He might as well be talking to a bunch of blast-ended slrewts with the way the trio just stared uselessly at him.
"Remember class, being at least of sup-par abilities in potions does not indicate that you can let your potion go below the quality you could've made it to be."
"Perhaps it was too much of me to expect even the barest of decorum from a 14-year-old. Just because you are dealing with typical fallouts in friendships does not give you the right to take that anger out on me. Let me inform you that whatever you're experiencing is but a small drop in the world of adults where we have–"
Once in there, Draco casted a muffliato, and tried to cough out the bloody petals. For some reason, he hadn't gotten much hectic fits since the moment with Pansy and Blaise. It was far and few in between. He hoped it stayed that way.
Draco gritted out, "Yes, Potter? Anything else you can do besides getting us into trouble with the Professor and further ruining the potion?"
Draco continued to crunch on his toast. He couldn't even taste the bloody thing since everyone was staring at him and the blonde Ravenclaw who was rattling on about some new creature (Kabyans? Maybe Gabyams?).
Ok. This really was too weird. Draco would have dropped the bloody stirring rod if Snape's remark didn't further aggravate him. "Potter, would you–would you just stop whatever you're doing!?"
And the stares. The fucking stares. Draco could've perfected that transfiguration spell soon if not for the fact that the golden trio were practically boring their eyes through his skull.
The idea of never feeling protected and at peace everytime he would have tea with Mother and everytime she would wrap her arms around him...
Was the thought still their in the back of their minds? Of course. But did they have other things to talk about and address? Definitely.
Draco gave a wolfish grin. "How much do you bet he's already snogging Vilmont in the Hufflepuff entrance."
"We will be brewing a Divyer Potion. Instructions are on the board. Pair up and begin," a voice drawled with a billowibg of his cloak.
"Enough! 30 points from Gryffindor for causing a disturbance in the halls and harrasing my students."
"And how many 'exceptions' do we need to make?" Blaise spoke with one eyebrow raised. Leave it to him to stab through the weak arguments.
Draco shrugged. "You heard Potter's point." He felt a tickle at the back of his throat. "We aren't all exactly the cream of the crop at everything."
Draco looked up to see the blonde girl still standing from where she sat. She was smiling at the lake despite the lack of tentacles in the air.
He casted a tempus and found that it was exactly  midnight. Draco somehow knew that these would be but one of the many cases that couldn't be explained when it came to Lovegood.
"Oh?," a voice drawled from the side, "is the Slytherin Prince having difficulty dealing with a hug?"
"Alright you oafs," he interrupted Blaise's ramblings, "let's just make it clear. We're not in the wrong. At least not entirely...we're just going to have to...adjust some of what we've thought of..." Bloody hell even he couldn't really think of the right words to say despite the upbringing of eloquence practically drilled into him.
"Yes, flowers," Draco hoped to Merlin his mouth and brain won't fuck this up. "I've been working on merging charms concerning flowers since it wouldn't be that dangerous if something went wrong. Right now I tested how long the casted charm would stay up. That's why I've been leaving every class."
Draco didn't know why, but it felt both unsettling and comforting hearing her dreamy-like voice. He stayed silent.
Surprisingly though, this time there wasn't even any blood and there was only one petal. Draco looked at it in confusion.
Yes, he, Draco Lucius Malfoy, was currently sitting at the Ravenclaw table eating toast while listening to Lovegood talk about her creatures.
For the first few weeks, the Slytherins stayed thick as thieves by each other's side. If people didn't know any better, they would have thought that they were bound to each other by invisible chains. Every class, they would stay right next to each other. In the Great Hall they would sit together as usual, but this time they were clumped up by each other's sides as if they would die if they didn't have any physical contact.
"Yes!" Pans had a glint in her eyes that made Draco feel sorry for the poor soul that Pansy had her gossip on. "Did you know Vilmont from Ravenclaw likes Diggory?"
"Don't bloody change the subject! And that still doesn't explain the breaks to the bathroom!" Pansy was fuming.
It was mixed. There wasn't a clearcut line. As Pansy was average, there was definitely a number of mudbloods abover her. Same for Blaise in quidditch.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Ah because Potter woke up one day and decided to compliment me on my potion skills, even state that I'm better than you,
"Nope," Draco took hold of his two best friends by their arms. "If I'm going to rest, then you're going to rest too. And honestly Pans if your grades drop too low, you'll be assigned more homework and that will just make it so we have less time to spend on the research."
"Alright so what the bloody hell is Potter on?" Draco crossed his arms and faced the trio the minute they were alone.
Draco peeked at his friends. He had to admit...Potter did have a point. Blaise was somewhere in the top 15 but Pans was just around average...and of course there wasn't even a need to mention Crabbe and Goyle. And he himself had been beaten by a mudblood...
He tried to rewind the conversations in his head, but it all just seemed like a blur of words and anger. The last thing he remembered was saying something about how pointless it was.
Pansy's gossips can be very useful in situations like these. Of course, he couldn't go to her praising her intel, fluffing up her ego like usual.
Potter himself didn't look any better. In fact he somehow managed to look even more rumpled as he moved his hands around and mouth opening and closing like a guppy fish. "I–er–I didn't–"
Everyone turned to see a flustered Slytherin from 6th year. She immediately cooled her face down back into the Slytherin mask, but everyone already heard her outburst.
What was he even thinking? Lovegood's creatures didn't exist. Was he really expecting to just suddenly spot them now of all bloody times?
"Yes Pans I'm getting there," Draco attempted to placate her. "You see..." Fuck where does he go from here. Honestly, he just thought the first thing that came up in his head.
"I believe that I have the right to keep my personal matters to myself." Draco was now looking at the wall behind his godfather.
The idea to never feel that burst of warmth everytime he, Pans, and Blaise stayed up all night gossiping and playing games in the dorm.
"Maybe, just maybe, you Gryffindor lot should leave us the fuck alone. We're finally not doing shit to anyone and there's a saying, 'don't thank a fairy for its gift'. In other words Potter, if your little tiny peanut of a brain didn't understand, don't shove your noses into other people's business once everything starts to look up."
Draco shook his head. "Don't take me for a bloody idiot. I know something's off with Potter. So hurry up and spill."
"Makes sense?" Blaise drawled as he stared at Pansy again. "Do you really think it makes sense because it does? or because it was drilled into our heads?"
They continued on their way through the corridor, not noticing the questioning gaze piercing at their backs.
Apparently, it had not found its owner as it flew up again and peered over the table. It was then that Draco had a better look on the owl, two tuffs at the end of its head and bright amber eyes.
"Harry," the words felt like gold spun upon the tip of his tongue, something divine yet forbidden. Harry looked back in shock.
"And I'm not talking about what happened a while ago at the table, though that did cement it. I'm talking about how you haven't been
"I don't want you guys to do this. If we leave it off, we can still spend time together and make good enough memories before I'm gone. At least something good can come out of this."
To not lose to Granger. To not lose to Potter. To stop bringing the Malfoy name down every time he fucks up. A detention. An E instead of an O. Losing a Quidditch Game. Not making the perfect potion. Being less than others. Being inferior.
"Well in comparison with us adults, you brats don't even know what life will be throwing at you, much less someone of your status."
Draco gulped but kept his face impassive. "I've just been researching a new topic on charms. Did you know that charms can actually be layered if they have the right compatibility?"
He noticed the idiot at a loss for words. "You...you've been acting strange. You've been keeping to yourselves, no longer insulting any of us. And you've been spending your days in the library, even more than you usually do."
Granger and Weasel sputtered at this. But strangely Potter didn't react to the taunts. Instead, his attention was on...
But just for one moment, for one brief moment, Draco wished that it was. He smiled at Harry and returned the same force of tightness on the hand he held.
He looked down at the cup of tea in his hand and sighed. "Don't tell me you two actually believed otherwise, that it was something else, something less...severe. I think it was already getting quite obvious from the information we got, depleting the Hogwarts library."
Honestly, this stupid idiotic–"flames Potter. He's staring at us. Show that you're at least as useful as a damn matchstick alright?"
"You have not answered my question Mr. Malfoy. What has been occuring between you and your friends?"
It takes three whispering groups in the common room for Harry to realise something’s happening. He goes to dinner suspicious and returns
Malfoy raises a brow and looks to Davies, who jumps right back into his explanation. It’s the first conversation Harry’s really invited Malfoy into, and he knows realistically he hasn’t only done so because he thinks Malfoy’s a good player.
for your sensitive self,” Harry snaps. Malfoy ignores him all but for a quirk of a brow, pulling a tome from his satchel.
Ron shuffles ahead of them, crunching into his stack of toast. He kicks absently at the grass and its crackling film of frost. Harry explains the previous night in detail—how only Dumbledore, Crouch and Ludo Bagman had wanted him to compete, how the contract will probably kill him if he doesn’t. How Moody had suggested that someone was out to kill him.
“So, we put Harry on a broom, the dragon’s stuck on the ground, Harry outmaneuvers it easily on his Firebolt, and job done. Full points.”
“Yes, now can we please get out of here before someone finds us!” Harry tries to lift his arm to pull Malfoy away, but Malfoy’s hand is already holding his wrist like a vice. “Come
The castle is filled with a buzzing of excitement and anticipation all day. Everywhere one goes there’s gossip and conversation, and the whole staff is simultaneously more snappish and lenient than usual.
“As if!” he replies, frowning at Ginny and trying to copy whatever she’s doing. He succeeds in little else other than make her laugh harder, but that’s okay with him. “Where’s Nev?”
The canon goes a second time, and all Harry has to listen to is Krum’s shuffling, air-shattering roars and the swelling noise of the crowd. He doesn’t think much of Ludo’s commentary, and especially not his remarks on exactly what he finds wrong with Fleur’s approach.
“Well, they believe Skeeter’s implications that you actually sleep when you’re at school,” Malfoy scoffs. “Anyone who knows you should know you spend your nights stalking me or getting into trouble.”
Harry is beginning to feel the chill seeping through his cloak, despite his shoulders being pressed up against his friends’. He keeps the kitten crate in front of him, smiling as they tumble around and sniff warily at the clamour outside of their sanctuary. He notices that Ginny and Hermione are shivering too.
Beside Harry, Hermione gasps quietly. He grins and nudges her. She scowls up at him, caught somewhere between irritation and pride.
The book jumps and knocks him in the chest. Harry fumbles to catch it before it falls on the floor again.
Harry knows Hermione had helped Hagrid with his hair again this morning, but he hadn’t known why. He’s managed to keep it neatly groomed all day, it seems, and has the restlessness of someone greatly excited. A large drying flower is tucked into his lapel.
“I would first like to introduce Mr Bartemius Crouch, head of the Department of International Magical Co-operation,” he pauses for a polite but sparse applause, “and Mr Ludo Bagman, head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports!” Ludo Bagman gains a much more enthusiastic reception, which he receives in good humour. Harry frowns at the pinched and stoic Mr Crouch and is wholly understanding of why.
Ron grimaces when they all fall weirdly silent again. Harry bites harshly into a piece of toast and tries to blame it on that.
Fearful of what he might find, Harry turns his mind to find similarities. Their bizarre argument in the courtyard the other day: Draco, smug, lounging around in a tree as if it were a perfectly standard thing for him to be doing. Draco, leaping down and giving Harry another one of those inexplicable once-overs, still with the flash of challenge in an eyebrow. The way he squares up to Harry with that grin, revelling in how he gets under Harry’s skin, only to be completely wrong-footed when he’s complimented instead.
"The giant squid of course! They prefer the solitude, but they still enjoy some company from time to time. Of course the gillies, snicklesnaps, and mermen are good company too. But they also like to see land dwellers like us."
It was one of the things Snape had brought up which Draco couldn't refute. Of course, he'd been meaning to reply to her, tell her about the school year and the typical things going on.
Draco then realized that some of the Slytherins were staring at him. He glared at them until they got the message and went back to whatever they were doing.
Alright, Draco realized. Potter was definitely hit by  a confundus charm of sorts. Large chance, it was a prank by the Weasley twins. That or Potter was slipped in a potion that made him more amiable towards people, and unluckily, Draco became the target.
He took deep breaths trying to piece together Francis' words. Was it true? If Draco had to be honest, he hadn't been paying as much attention to the other slytherins lately. It most likely had to do with the whole Hanaki business and the incident with his friends.
It was manageable. He had his friends and he still loved his parents. But with a stupid life-threatening disease and the sudden loss of his friends and his position in Slytherin...Can he still say that he cares anymore about all of this?
A test perhaps? Maybe the object of his affections was pureblood and together they would bring forth a powerful child meant to pave the way for the future of purebloods to rise up higher in society–no. Bloody hell, that's stupid.
Draco gave an offhand wave to a random area at the side, making it look like he was just swatting something in the air.
Potter, miraculously, went silent. Draco took that as an opportunity to take hold of his two best friends and push his way through the trio towards the slytherin dorms.
He honestly couldn't even blame any of them. He too was wondering why the bloody hell he was allowing this to happen.
Draco stiffened and heard some snickers coming from the Slytherins. They knew about Draco's drop in quality in his essays since the head of the house decided to discuss it with him right in the bloody middle of the common room in passing.
"Pans, the only cure is either having my love requited from a person I don't even fucking know or having surgery which leaves only a small chance of survival and even then, I would lose the ability to love. Love in general. That only leaves the inevitable!"
It was definitely not a pleasure at all. Francis was a 7th year who was a constant thorn on his side. Let's just say that if Draco had not arrived at Hogwarts, Francis would have most likely taken the spot of Slytherin Prince.
Pansy then stood up from her seat, causing Blaise and Draco to nearly tumble out of theirs. "Wha–""Pans, what the hell!?"
It's true. He wouldn't understand half of Draco's problems. The actual weight he carried with the Malfoy name, the position in Slytherin, the necessity to hide stupid life-threatining magic disea–
"Well Malfoy, maybe you should've thought about that sooner, before you tormented everyone with your bigoted blood purist beliefs," he seethed. "You and your slytherins always throw your words and hexes at us, pointing out non-existent flaws and insulting the people we love."
Draco could already imagine what Pansy was seeing before her, him standing by a sink holding a blue petal.
"Of course that's to be expected," Francis continued. "You've lost your touch you know? The other Slytherins have already begun to notice. You keep to yourself and no longer spread word of our our blood purity beliefs."
Draco rolled his eyes, "Anyway, that's all the reason I had to stay and bloody chat with you lot. Take Potter to the hospital wing and whatnot. Ah, and think of that as owing me a favor." With that, he turned to leave.
She did what Draco could see was an attempt at fixing her hair back to normal. Sadly, it wouldn't work.
would be there. The nightly talks were calming in a way he supposed. It helped in passing through these days.
Usually, Draco would be making a mocking smile in reply. He would tilt his head up and peer down at them as if it was obvious that they were the ones who deserved whatever they got.
Confused, Draco motioned for her to continue and then she bloody beamed at him, teeth and all.  "The reason they're attracted to bad omens is because they are delicacies for them. So–"
Draco scoffed and put up the usual glare. "Well Smith," he sneered, "I don't exactly remember there being a rule against sitting at another house's table. Might I add that it is also very interesting to see that you are quite passionate about keeping to the
Draco shook his head at this. Of course they are. It's just a little fight. And anyway, it's only been a few days.This is nothing. They've fought before.
"Draco," he smiled at the name like a kid who was allowed to have a sleepover with his friends. He spoke it as if he had opened the first present under the Christmas tree. As if he had just casted his first spell.
Pansy looked him the eyes like she wa searching for something. After a while, she narrowed her gaze. "Swear it on Slytherin's honor."
Draco looked around. That meant other students were also having classes. Luckily, no one with a free period were outside at the moment. Draco sighed in relief.
Potter looked like a gaping fish but eventually kept his mouth shut. For once, even he probably realized that Snape was not to be trifled with for today.
Harry in turn talked about the DA and about homework in general as Draco stroked his hair. Draco's hands played with the curls, which were even more soft than he ever imagined.
"Look, we can't rule out that perhaps it's something else. I mean look! You don't even know the person you apparently have unrequited love towards, to the point that magic wants you to die!"
The breakfast was short  and soon came to an end since Draco came in late. But for once, he felt better. It was like there was less weight on his shoulders, no need to care about keeping his position in Slytherin, no need to watch his moves and his words, no need to worry about stupid friends and bloody godfathers and–
Draco thought this would be a great opportunity to inform Granger and weasel to immediately take Potter to Madame Pomphreys, or even St. Mungo's. So he nodded.
Draco continued on in a whisper, "Lovegood I don't know what led you to believe so. But we are definitely not as you call 'friends'. Far from it, we–"
"Well of course I'm not exactly interested to be privy to your fallouts in friendships," Professor rolled his eyes.
Draco huffed. "We've already been spending too much of our free time bloody scouring through the piles of books in the library. It even caused my grades to drop and there is only so many excuses I can make to Severus as to why my potions essay isn't up to par as usual."
Blaise stopped and looked back at him. He was about to shove the letter into his pocket, when Pansy swiped it off.
Draco flinched having let his guard down from the new gossip Pansy shared. He forced his shoulder to relax. "Obviously it's for homework," he rolled his eyes.
Of course, a user can break it if they choose to do so, but they will be left with an irremovable magical mark on their face for a week. Nothing could be done to hide or remove it. This was due to the mark acting as a sign, a reminder of the Slytherin's failure to uphold their honor.
"Enough Pans!" Draco was tired. He was tired of his friends doing this. "Just drop it. You don't need to do anything. It won't even help."
Draco gave out an accidental chuckle. He immediately clamped his mouth shut. "Apologies Merlin, what do you have for me?"
"Clean all of this up. Just as you said, might as well make yourself useful," he put on the usual sneer.
The bird propped its leg up which held an envelope with the Malfoy crest. Draco took it as the bird nibbled on his toast.
First it was in the Great Hall, with them staring and whispering. Draco and his friends tried to ignore them but the food just tasted bland in their mouths. And it just continued on from there.
The other two still didn't say anything. He turned around wondering why, when he saw their mouths set in a hard line.
Lovegood just continued to stare there for an uncomfortable amount of time until Draco had enough and coughed into his hand. "Lovegood, I thought we were going back inside?"
Draco then took a step forward towards Potter. "What? Want to remind us of your superiority as the Golden Boy who got to take part in the Triwizard Tournament? Come to brag about your pitiful excuse of a participation when we already have our own champion who got his right to participate fair and square?"
A hand started to make a shoo-away motion near his head. "Too many wrackspurts...I didn't think it was possible for more to appear."
"Look, I don't know why you decided to play make-believe aurors and stalk us at every corner. But me and my friends aren't doing anything. No, we're not planning to take over the school or Wizarding Britain. No, we don't have some diabolical scheme that would harm or put people's live at risk. And no, I'm not going to give you information on why we're doing this. Because you know what? It's none of your fucking business." Draco realized that he was seething and rising up to meet Potter in the eyes.
Before he knew it, he was already making conversation with her. He didn't know when it had started. Perhaps when he asked some questions about what she had said, in disbelief, or when she decided to inquire about simple things like his favorite food.
Draco relaxed a bit at this, feeling the coiling magma cool down. "So? What's your hidden motive? Your agenda? Scheme? Or how do you Gryffindors call it–sudden zip of the brain cell?"
Draco didn't know how he should have felt. Shocked? Angry? Sad? All he felt was nothing. As if somewhere deep inside, he already knew the answer.
Anyway, this year was definitely the worst, even compared to the last. Draco hoped that it would stay that way. He really didn't want an even worse year than this. Then again, there is the eventual year he would...No he'll fall out of love for sure. Surely, this disease will disappear any moment now.
"Mr. Malfoy! You have been zoning out too much which has increased the necessity for us to discuss this–"
Draco didn't know how long he was there for, but the sky was now taking an orange hue. He had to go back soon.
"Alright I just," Draco pinched the bridge of his nose, "look I just found out today so bear with me if I also need time to gather my thoughts."
Draco had no idea what to do with this. Perhaps in their first and second years he would take undoubted joy to have this, a moment when he could order Potter around.
That was when Pansy stepped in. "Shut up Potter. Just leave us the fuck alone." But her voice shook at the end of her words. Draco felt that she too didn't know what to with Potter's points.
They both then talked about quidditch and how Umbridge sucked. They talked about their friends. They talked about their favorite memories. The everything and nothing, stored into the little temporary bubble they made for themselves.
Draco could even see the mudb....He could see Granger huff in annoyance, no doubt from being beaten yet again in potions. And of course not so far from her was the stupid Weasley and Potter.
Harry keeps his head up and slides deftly onto the bench beside their favourite ferret. “Hello everyone!” he says. “Merry Christmas!”
Malfoy sits in an armchair, nose in the book on European dragons Harry had found and bookmarked. Hermione has the one on East Asia.
“Mr Potter,” Madam Pomfrey says, interrupting. “They want to give you your scores now. If you’d please re-enter the stadium.”
“A wizard never starts a fight when another’s back is turned!” Moody growls. He flicks his wand again and Malfoy goes shooting into the air, floundering wildly. Moody swings him around, forcing him to do somersaults and cartwheels and shoving him down the back of Goyle’s jumper. Goyle yelps and scrabbles at his back, writhing in the most amazing manner. Malfoy manages to free himself, only to be recaptured by Moody’s charm. He’s bounced into the air—up, down, up, down—thudding against the floor each time.
The stadium is large, easily half a Quidditch pitch. The noise from the crowd surges again, and he neither knows nor cares what they’re saying.
“Ah, the fourth champion!” Bagman cheers, rising and bounding over as soon as he sees Harry. “Come in, Harry, come in. It’s just the Wand Weighing ceremony, nothing to be worried about. The rest of the judges will be along soon.”
“Really!” Hermione huffs loudly, smacking Ron upside the head when he, too, asks Harry if he has a quill.
he reads quietly to Ron and Hermione, once he’s sure Fred and George are no longer paying attention.
“You too. You’ll all do brilliantly. I hope you won’t take it personally that I’m cheering for Cedric.”
“Ah, thanks,” Ron mutters. “I don’t like keeping them in the cage, but they’re a right troublesome pair you know?”
“They’re being weird,” Ron mutters. Harry thinks he agrees. There’s a small burst of noise at the Lee Jordan end of the table. They lean forward to see what the fuss is, and everyone goes suspiciously quiet.
Abruptly the canvas flies inwards and he finds himself with another armful of distressed friend and another faceful of hair.
A younger Remus Lupin sits with both Lily and James Potter in what he supposes is their house in Godrick’s Hollow. They’re laughing, happy, and looking from each other to the camera with heartwarming tenderness.
“I polished it just last night,” Cedric says with a grin, flashing a split-second look over his shoulder to wink at Harry. Harry chokes, and he and Fleur try not to giggle too loudly. Harry holds up his own wand, with all its many fingerprints, and shrugs dramatically to Fleur who snorts. Even Viktor looks amused.
“Champions, over here please!” calls Professor McGonagall. Parvati beams excitedly at Harry and they both say a quick ‘See you later,’ to Ron and Blaise before they run off. The crowd parts for them, unnervingly enough, and they soon find themselves in front of McGonagall in her red tartan.
“Hedwig stands out,” Hermione mutters, though her mind is clearly still stuck on other things. “If she keeps flying to Sirius, someone might notice. She’s hardly native, and a lot of people know that Harry has a snowy owl.”
They find Ron exactly where Harry had left him, only now he’s hiding in his hands and they’re not entirely sure he’s not crying. Parvati stands back and surveys him, twirling her wand between her fingers and sending out a shower of pink bubbles. They make the room smell like what he’d imagine the ocean on a desert island might smell like.
“This is a Hungarian horntail,” Charlie says, patting the fence. “Over there’s a common Welsh green, that red one’s a Chinese fireball, and that’s a Swedish short-snout.”
Ron raises his eyebrow scathingly. “Uh huh, sure. Anyway Harry, are you going to send that letter? We can go now before dinner. I’ll lend you Pig.”
Harry, Ron, Seamus, Dean and Neville change into their dress robes up in the dormitory. Harry can barely get the buttons right, much less tie his neck thing—bowtie. Ron is surveying himself in the mirror and looks moments away from combusting due to mortification.
The song around them shifts, and something a little more upbeat slips its way between the dancers. Fleur has already dropped Davies when they come across her. Instead she has Draco Malfoy waltzing about a quarter foot beneath her nose, with her heels, and she winks at Harry. As they twirl past Pansy and her date, Fleur holds one finger up from Draco’s shoulder and they switch partners seamlessly on the next spin. Harry is dizzy just watching, and when he looks to Parvati she’s blinking blankly after them, too. Theodore Nott and Draco’s dreamy-eyed date are coming up on them, and Harry meets his eyes and then sees him make the same signal with the hand at the girl’s waist. Harry’s eyes fly wide and he tries to shake his head but it’s too late, they’re crossing over, and while he panics and holds his hand out towards them, Parvati seems fully capable of taking care of landing herself in Nott’s arms. For a split second, he’s almost jealous of him.
“Oh, can it, Potter!” Lavender cackles. “You’re not totally undesirable. It’s true some may take more convincing than beating a dragon, but...”
“He wants to talk to you?” Hermione asks worriedly. “I hope he isn’t going to try to get in, that’s a terrible idea!”
As soon as it comes to a stop the door opens. A boy wearing robes his school colours leaps down from the platform, fumbling inside the carriage for a moment before a set of huge stairs extends to the ground. He stands aside, and several people gasp. It instantly becomes clear why the set-up is of such great size.
for almost a year,” Ron is mumbling distractedly to himself. Harry sighs and shares a long-suffering look with Hermione.
“Merry Christmas to you too, Dobby. Just maybe don’t lean over me next time, okay? Give me a prod or something.”
God, he thinks, how far away he is from the dull and painful life he had at Privet Drive, where the people are as nosy as they are incredibly judgemental.
Dumbledore steps towards the casket and taps the very top with his wand. It melts away, falling like a curtain. Inside is a tall stone goblet, carved intricately with patterns too small for Harry to see. It would look right at home in Hogwarts, with all the gargoyles and statues, except for the bright blue flames licking around its rim. They stand tall, almost as tall as the goblet itself, moving in a peculiar manner. Almost… Sentient.
“Partners?” Harry interrupts. Professor McGonagall looks at him with a sort of exasperated pity he doesn’t much like.
“Fred and George are arguing again,” Ron sighs. Harry looks where Seamus is to see an intense debate going on across the table. Lee, Angelina, and several others seem to be throwing in their two pence periodically. Angelina looks more irritated than anything else.
Mrs Norris strolls into view a few moments later, pausing in the middle of the corridor and sitting down. She stares right at them with unblinking red eyes. Her tail swishes and twitches.
Flustered, Malfoy doesn’t answer. “We’re going back,” he mutters instead, taking her arm and pulling her gently away.
“Dumbledore!” Skeeter cries again. The parchment and quill have vanished, and she is clipping shut her clutch bag. “I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards’ Conference?”
The judges’ table is draped imperiously with gold, and all three headmasters, Barty Crouch and Ludo Bagman are seated there.
Malfoy glares at him viciously but looks away without saying a word. He glances up at Harry, but his frown only deepens.
“Over the past few months, Mr Bagman and Mr Crouch have worked tirelessly to bring us this most esteemed event. They will be joining myself, Madame Maxime and Professor Karkaroff on the panel of judges.”
Before Harry can work up a proper irritation, the door swings open with a loud knock. Colin Creevey sidles in, grinning at him.
“Oh good, you’re all here!” announces Ludo Bagman, entering the tent. He looks around and frowns, glancing between the extra, obviously unexpected visitors.
—licks his hand. Harry lets a shiver run through himself, pretending the chill from the wall has seeped through his cloak. He doesn’t let go.
“They’re great,” Harry grins. “Malfoy gave me one, I asked him this afternoon. Anyway, you’re good at nonverbal magic, aren’t you? I heard some girls talking about it.”
Hermione is stunned into a very, very rare silence. Harry grins, and George winks at him, though he too seems surprised by Fred’s generosity.
“I asked Cedric to help me charm the badge to stay hidden until the camera was about to go off. Fantastic, isn’t it?”
my life’s just gone over that tipping point of madness. I don’t even care anymore.” Ron nudges him with his elbow, brows rising. “I have you and Hermione, and at least three others who seem to want to help me in this shitshow. What can Malfoy do? He’s even been nice recently. Second chances, and all that.”
“It’s all right,” Fred says, “we all know you need a laugh, what with Ronnie acting like a git who’s crawled up his own arse and gotten stuck half the time.”
“I think it’ll look great with your dress robes,” Fred agrees, leaning over the back cushions. “Now, could we borrow Pigwidgeon?”
“Hey, Draco,” Harry says, and doesn’t choke on his own spit. He’s suddenly quite agonisingly aware of the state of his entire body; his palms are sweating, his feet feel less than coordinated, his face is no doubt flushed, and his hair probably looks like it usually does. At least he knows his robes aren’t anything offensive—he’d been poked and prodded by the best, after all.
She’s very pretty, he thinks, as they curve around the fountain of ice sculptures that’s sprung up between feet. Her hair is long and wavy and is somehow not at all bustled by the twirling or the rising humidity. Her dress matches her eyes and floats around her mysteriously.
Just then, barely twenty feet behind the treeline, they hear shouts from people up ahead. A deafening roar follows, making them both wince and cringe away.
The two of them stumble down the rocky path, heading towards the glowing lights of Hagrid’s hut and the Beauxbatons carriage. Harry can hear Madame Maxime talking inside it. She must be near the door.
“That will be changed shortly,” she says. “I expect you to find yourself a partner, Potter, and soon. Take Mr Weasley, if you have to. Off you go now.”
All four are hemmed in with laughably-short wooden fences, and seven or eight people run around each of them, heaving heavy chains attached to leather straps and collars.
“What are you two whispering about, then?” calls Ron, toast finished, hands shoved moodily into his robe pockets.
Harry flips them back to see he, Neville, Seamus and Dean peering through their own at him. “Sorry, Dobby came to visit. Go back to sleep.”
“It’s unethical!” she insists. Some people were beginning to take a little notice of her near-shrieking, but were obviously and understandably reluctant to join a more active side of the campaign.
“No, he’s off delivering something,” Ron says, frowning at the damage. “What d’you want him for, anyway?”
Harry smiles. “Well… That’s great. I would love to go to the ball with you Parvati. I just, er, hope you can put up with my terrible dancing. You do have a reputation to uphold.”
Ron groans and lets his head loll back on his shoulders, as if pleading the ceiling to either send help or come crashing down to kill him. Together, Harry and Hermione manage to shove him through the portrait hole, ignoring the Fat Lady’s rather hypocritical comments about the volume of their laughter.
“Well, be surprised. It’s true.” Harry catches up to him and pokes his elbow placatingly. “I wouldn’t say it if it wasn’t. You’re my best friend.”
“No, it’s okay,” she tells him. Her voice is as gentle as always and her hair is glossy and soft-looking. She smiles, and it kind of just makes him feel worse. “They’re all being mean, we don’t blame you.”
In the common room, Hermione looks at them pointedly from a sofa in front of the fire. She waits for Harry and Ron to shrug on their robes and hurry back down, shoves the crate into Harry’s arms and trots straight out of the portrait hole.
“Draco darling,” Pansy cackles. “Aren’t you going to join in?” Harry notices then that Draco is leaning back slightly, staring at him with no minor trepidation, and ignoring her.
It’s about a minute until Neville reappears, shedding his feathers in an instant and turning up looking just the same as usual. He joins in the laughter and gives George a high five, taking a sworn-untampered bourbon biscuit from his tray.
“Congratulations, Mr Malfoy,” Madam Hooch says. Harry grins at Ron, scrunches his nose in apology to Katie, Grant and the Weasleys, and makes a rude hand gesture at Malfoy behind Hooch’s back. He cackles and returns it, kicking his broom up onto his shoulder as they wander towards the broom shed.
“May I introduce to you Mr Ollivander,” he says, waving over a tall, frail, greying man. Harry has met Mr Ollivander only once before, but he is the unforgettable type. He’s surprised to see him, nonetheless.
“Harry…” She looks at him with a truly sorrowful expression. He knows she’s worried, but fussing isn’t going to help.
Though, until that Thursday, he wouldn’t have believed a lot of things. But then Professor Moody had danced an enlarged spider around the room, tortured it, and then killed it, all directly beneath their noses.
The door swings inwards and Madame Maxime steps out. She is wrapped in a thick fluffy shawl and is just as glittery as usual.
“I think it’s a good idea,” Hermione says. “I’ll deal with that this evening. Go on then, there’s no reason to hang around.”
“It’s nothing personal Longbottom, but we all know it’s true. It’s Ginny after all!” laughs one of the friends.
Harry!” Hermione says quite sharply over breakfast, after he’s told them what he sent. “You didn’t imagine your scar hurting at all, and you know it.”
The first recognisable couple that spins past are Cedric and Cho. Harry wants to smile at them, maybe say hi, but they really do only have eyes for each other. Next are Dean and Seamus, who had been making fun of him from the sidelines only seconds ago. He considers sticking out a leg to trip them, but he’d probably trip himself and Parvati too in the process.
The horntail crouches in the centre of the pit. Her wings are half furled around her and her nest in which the golden egg gleams. Her eyes narrow at the sight of him, menacing.
“Parvati, you look wonderful,” he says, letting her giggle before he grimaces. “It’s Ron, upstairs. Would you… Do you know anyone willing to help?”
Harry steps slightly behind Malfoy and slips his hand over his mouth. Malfoy harrumphs but gets the message. They slip into a convenient alcove, heaven-sent.
“Hate to break it to you, but you’re about to miss breakfast,” Neville says, coming out of the bathroom.
“Hey, Potter!” calls the devil himself, unmistakably smug. He’s lounging in the crook of the large tree in the corner with Parkinson, Goyle and Nott sitting in the grass nearby. Zabini, Millicent Bullstrode and Daphne Greengrass are perched on the rim of one of the walkway arches behind.
her like her, or…?” She gapes, and he realises what he’s just said. “Oh, shit, sorry, I’m so sorry, that was really insensitive, wasn’t it? I really… I should keep my mouth shut…”
“Dragons,” he says as loudly as he dare to the only two people left in the common room. Ron’s mouth drops open and Hermione leaps up from her armchair.
“Nonsense!” Ron scoffs. “That was bloody mental! Whoever put your name in the Goblet is trying to do you in for sure!”
Malfoy jerks abruptly away and tries to smooth his hair and robes. He takes his bag and the cat crate from Nott and stalks off without a word.
He knew the bird was told to wait for a reply and was glad that it would disobey its orders for him.
"If none Professor, then I'll be taking leave. I'll make sure to reply to Mother and improve my grades." Draco picked up his things and was on his way to the door.
It definitely was quite a contrast. One moment the Slytherin trio were always by each other's sides and the next, one of them was suddenly cut off, much more the Malfoy Heir himself.
In the classrooms, the library, the great hall, the corridors—everywhere, just everywhere he could spot the golden trio not far off.
"It's none of your business!" Draco yelled glaring at Potter. "It's none of your fucking business. Just because you're the bloody golden boy and Dumbledore's pet doesn't give you the right to dip your nose into other people's affairs, especially mine."
Draco buried his head into his hands. He did everything right. He upheld the traditions. He cherished it gifts and taunted those who didn't.
"We–we need to keep a sample." He took out his wand and summoned a jar from his trunk. "Hopefully...it's something else. Something better and different and.."
"That's the thing Malfoy," Potter's voice held contempt but had an underlaying hesitation..? "Do you really think no one would be suspicious of you and your friends? What? You think we can just easily accept how one day you torment us, insult our families and being who we are, and the next day, you just decide to stop?"
They were now roaring words at each other. He didn't know when it had escalated and which words were used, but it did.
"Oh er...sorry," the Gryffindor then took the vial from Draco's hand and brought it towards the professor's desk. Draco felt a lingering tingle at his fingertips, where Potter's fingers brushed. Honestly, Potter really had no control of his magic.
"Potter," even spitting the name out lit a fire within Draco, "it appears that you still don't even have the words to give a legitimate excuse as to why you and your sidekicks are in the dungeons."
Strangely, the owl seemed to be staring at the same area Luna was motioning at. Its eyes slightly moved, in different timing from Luna's hand motions as if there was actually something else there.
The three Slytherins were in their dorms after finishing classes. After the incident with Snape, the Gryffindors finally left them alone. But that just left them with another problem.
It was one thing to have that niggling thought in the back of your mind. But it's another thing when spoken out loud. It just made it more real.
"They do, they've been laughing at you and suddenly your friends don't want to hang out with you and—"
The owl turned to him and gave a squawk.  It then flew towards his outstretched arm. Its amber eyes stared at him with most likely confusion as if to say 'why for bloody's sake are you sitting at an entirely different table? Do you know how long I was searching for you?'.
"I know. I know that someone like me isn't exactly a person anyone would fall in love with. Because you know what? I'm the son of a death eater who believes in blood purity. I'm the heir of the Malfoy family, one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. People on the opposite side abhor me, and the people on our side fear me."
"They started the fight Professor," Draco heard Blaise pipe up when no one did. He was pointing at the Gryffindor trio.
They were actually three people: one with thick bushy hair, the other with short red hair, and the last one with a bird's nest.
Everyone was looking at him like he'd gone insane, and he was starting to agree with them. He was also pretty sure that whatever stance he'd held in Slytherin had dropped, hard. If the glares from their table weren't a good enough sign, then then the immediate whispering and pointing would have sealed it.
"What?" Draco stood up from his bed. "This is what we were going to talk about! It's bloody ridiculous and so fucking insane. But..."
Lun–Lovegood giggled into her hands. "Perhaps so, but it could also mean that you won't go through it in the end. They..." She stopped and stared at him, as if waiting for a sign that this was ok.
The two boys who laughed and smiled would soon have to face a world that was different and much more complicated.
Draco continued to crunch on his flavorless toast as he peeked again at the Slytherin table. Maybe, he was just expecting even a little thumbs up or a small quirk of a smile from–well from the Slytherins of course. He wasn't searching for–
Draco and Pansy kept their mouth shuts. They then peered at Blaise like ducklings looking towards their mother duck.
They've most likely concocted an abysmal potion that would burn the bottom of their bloody cauldron (It wouldn't be the first time).
"And how much time will we use up before we realize that there really isn't any other alternative and that I've used up my remaining lifespan searching for an answer that doesn't even exist!"
"So am I going to be the only one left in the dark?" Draco questioned after an annoyingly long time of silence.
The stares had gotten 10 times worse. People were whispering and pointing at him in a very bloody obvious manner.
"Of course because I definitely want to speak more than 5 minutes with a halfblood, bloodtraitor, and mudbl—know-it-all"
"How would you feel if everyone kept insulting your friends? How would you feel if someone kept bringing up your family and sneer at all the fucking problems you have no control over!? You think I want to be an orphan? You think I wanted to be reminded every fucking day that my parents are dead and I have to face that reminder every day because of my scar!? "
Draco shook his head. "Not long, or at least I don't think so. I only noticed recently when the coughing got a tad worse and you know," he gestured, "the...blood..."
Draco mentally shook his head at the thought. He was sure that the other two knew that even without his Hanahaki, that scenario wouldn't happen...But sometimes, it was nice to dream that it was.
Then there was even quidditch. Draco was also doing quite well there. Pansy was good if she had the motivation. And Blaise...well Blaise was abysmal.
And suddenly Harry's face tinted in red. Was he nervous? Draco didn't know. But fuck it he too was nervous. So who was he to fucking judge.
"If it isn't the Golden Trio," Pansy spat. "Now what brings you here to grace us with your presence?"
Blaise tried tor pry the two from each other. But they were having none of it, hurling words over his head.
Draco listened as Lovegood continued her talk on different species that came out in the night. He had casted a soft lumos and a discrete notice-me-not charm.
"You don't need to talk about it if you don't want to," her voice dropped to a soft whisper. "A lot of people feel sad, you're not alone."
His godfather pinched the bridge of his nose, "I will not be repeating myself. Your performance has been falling and you have not replied to any of your mother's letters."
He didn't even know why he was bringing it up. He could have just as easily left her right there and made his way to the Slytherin dorms.
"What Malfoy? Going to shout the same things you were taught by your dad? Daddy's little boy can't think for himself?"
Draco was thinking of pointing out how this time there wasn't even any blood! But...he didn't want to bring her hopes up, not when he didn't even know why it became like this. Is it random? Does it have intervals where it goes on one extreme then to the other? Or was there an actual reason it became this way?
Pansy and Blaise relaxed a bit at this. Draco knew he was definitely going to be screamed and shoved to Madame Pomfrey's once he told his two best friends the news though.
Draco noticed Potter move next to him, looking over his shoulder at the potion. His throat felt an itch.
There were trees and patches of different plants. He watched as they swayed to the wind. Up above, the sky was still a steady blue dotted with soft clouds.
"Well what if that is what I want? If my time here is limited then I don't want to waste any single fucking second–"
"I hid it," Blaise narrowed his eyes at Draco, "because I knew you were going to be a git about it and whine about how your life really is going to end."
He didn't know why he was talking to her. He wanted to be left alone. But well, it wouldn't hurt to have someone to actually talk to. Plus, no matter what he tells her, no one would actually believe Looney Lovegood if she decides to expose him someday.
Of course Francis decided to still have the last word, "It's François! And take this as a warning Malfoy. Don't get too comfortable with where you are right now. I wasn't lying about anything I said."
15 minutes later, Potions Class had come to an end. Draco was about to leave ahead of the others, already having everything cleaned and packed up, when his godfather called out.
Draco glared at Snape. Snape didn't know a bloody thing. "Well I'm sorry if being a Malfoy means that my life is daisies and sunshine."
Draco rolled his eyes, leave it to his godfather to hate even the idea of dealing with anything children or teen-related.
Draco was lying belly down with a pillow in his hands, facing Pansy and Blaise who were at the foot of his bed.
"Well," Draco added while lowering his wand as if it wasn't there in the first place, "even if I ever do no longer hold the Slytherin throne, I hope you don't expect that someone with less athletic ability and inferior lineage to mine can overtake that position?"
Pansy paled at this. But soon her eyes alit with determination. "We're going to get through this Draco okay?" She placed a hand on his shoulder.
Draco rolled over in his bed and took another peek at the door. He tossed a diagnosis spell to check if the wards they put up were still there.
They stared at each other for a stretched moment, until his godfather finally gave in and raised a brow.
Draco wiped at his mouth and held out a wand to cast a scourgify and vanishing charm when Blaise stopped him by gripping his arms again with shaking hands.
Then silver eyes met green and Draco immediately turned away. He didn't know why, but he felt like for once, he wouldn't be able to handle his stare.
Pansy continued to drag them until they reached an unused classroom. She proceeded to shove them in there and cast a locking and muffliato charm.
Draco would have been pleased by the attention if it wasn't so bloody annoying. They couldn't research about the disease anymore in the library so they had to transfer their activities to the slytherin dorm.
"Don't think I don't know you think the same," Draco seethed. "You were hiding that letter for a reason after all."
The minute he stepped out of the classroom, he was met face to face with the Gryffindor trio, who then proceeded to drag him off to a corner away from the onlookers.
“It’s what I do best, Sir.” He smiled and let go of the breath he hadn’t been aware he was holding. They made arrangements about Harry coming in and said their goodbyes.
It wasn’t exactly what he wanted but he thought better than to push Kingsley any further. The older man rubbed the back of his neck, dark eyes twinkling mischievously. “Robards is going to be a pain in the arse over this, Harry. I hope you realise that.” He quirked a smile at him.
Ron raised his hand to get him to stop, it hurt more than he would have expected. Patil was staring at them both curiously. “Give me a minute,” he said and then left the room.
“A muggle collapsed, poisoning – potion obviously. Considering that the suspect trusts the Malfoy boy, Smith thought it appropriate to send him in for some intel. I’m not really sure what all this is,” he gestured to the equipment Smith was muttering into, and Harry marvelled, not for the first time, how this man got a job in detecting, “But I believe it to be some type of communication device. Malfoy has something in his ear that means he can hear Smith and Smith can hear him. Apparently close to a muggle invention he was saying. Malfoy looked quite terrified to be honest.”
“You are very mysterious, they were not wrong on that front. It’s your eyes I think. Green is so unusual.”
“And also I think I’m…well…it’s that I…I’m in love with him, see, and don’t really know what to do about it.”
Draco put a sign on the pub door that said they were closed for business. Twice they had people shouting up at Draco’s flat’s windows asking why. Mainly they were concerned for Draco’s health, but when they realised he was well they were confused as to why the pub was shut. At one point, Draco had been practically hanging out the living room window trying to convince people to go home. One very persistent regular then asked for Draco’s recipes for some of the cocktails if the pub was really shut for the evening. Draco had told him to bugger off in that crisp accent of his that made Harry’s stomach feel funny. Him being bent over the window with his arse in the air did that too but Harry tried not to think about that.
Eventually Draco beckoned him over to the bar to drink his pint. Harry sat on a stool just past Draco’s head so he had to tilt his chin up to look at him. It made his face look all the more delicate and Harry studied his pint instead.
“Why? It’s alright, we’ll catch the guy.” But Harry was hurriedly picking up his stuff and cramming it into his bag. “Harry,” Ron tried again, “Why do you need to go?”
Harry took a breath and whispered into the receiver, praying that Draco didn’t jump and blow his cover, precarious as it was. “Draco? If you could possibly establish the intent behind his purpose for using muggles it would really help. Only if you can and once that’s done you’re out of there. I’ll personally come and get you out, alright?” Harry resisted the temptation to tell him what a great job he was doing with the two quills still in his eyeline and noting everything down.
His skin was buzzing as if he were tanning the drinks he was supposed to be handing out. Deciding to throw caution to the fucking wind, he leant into the madness that was this situation. “How about you make one and I’ll copy?” he suggested to Draco.
Potter was lying very still. The light emanating from the gaps in the curtains told him that he had his hands clasped on his stomach. It was strange to have someone in his bed, strange to share any space.
“Ha! You’ve had one too, eh?” He looks Harry up and down. “Recently by the looks of it.” He then resumed his conversation, the other man laughing loudly causing a woman to tut as she walked past.
So as Dolly blared from the jukebox, Draco mixed drinks and threw bottles into the air and smiled, graciously the way his mother had taught him to and flirtatiously the way Pansy had chastised him for.
Draco preened. “Well, thank you. But I used to be prone to acne as a teenager and I can be terribly self-conscious about it.”
Kingsley sat behind his desk and avoided Harry’s eyes. He fidgeted with papers and quills, took a sip of coffee then when Harry found himself beginning to fidget, he looked up and finally cleared his throat.
Malfoy nodded and muttered, “S’alright,” before fetching cutlery and levitating the plates to the small, circular table in the living room.
He wondered how Draco had done this on his own for so long; he was exhausted. Sweat trickled down his back and above his brow. The heat, the noise and overall chaos made him slightly frantic as he poured drinks and asked people to repeat their orders for the third time.
Patil spoke to the stag, her hands continuing to work over Draco’s chest, his neck. The stag looked to Harry and he nodded.
Was he flirting? Fuck, Draco really hoped he was. There was something about this guy that was…odd and Draco couldn’t put his finger on it. It felt like he wasn’t letting Draco away with anything, as if he knew not to be fooled by his smile or his practiced sincerity.
Of all the strange things he had encountered since finding out about the magical world, engaging with objects that shouldn’t talk was the most annoying.
“All I have done since I left Hogwarts is play things a certain way. It is never been the way I have done things  but I allowed it because I thought it helped and maybe it did in a way but I don’t owe the ministry anything and I am not playing the game like that anymore. Being here and doing something important has given me the shake I needed. I’ll come to the ministry to submit the memories, I will talk to the detectives and then I am leaving to return here. The Aurors you send can continue to tail him or collective evidence, whatever, but I will be coming back to finish this.”
The evening sun seemed to be emptying itself into their small kitchen. Boxes were still piled high on the counters and Harry just knew he was going to have learn Hermione’s expert extension charms to fit all the stuff Draco had brought from his flat.
The comment threw Draco until he remembered what Harry was referring to exactly. In the midst of his humiliating spectacle of hysterically sobbing in the middle of the night, Harry had kissed him. Actually kissed him. It was a shame that he was too upset to appreciate it properly at the time, due to snot on his face and continuing to cry, but it was rather nice.
“I don’t know how to…carry on with you here. I can live with the banishment and exile and try to pay the price for what I have done but I don’t know how to act around you. After what I’ve done to everyone…to you. Maybe I don’t get to be around you.”
Robards was moving and saying ‘right, let’s go’ again and then everyone was busying themselves about the room. The suspects were told to stand and the younger of the two Aurors, pimply faced and who looked no more than nineteen, took them by the elbows and directed them downstairs with Harry close behind.
Harry did as he was bid, anger bubbling just below the surface demanding to be released. He manoeuvred the two men with him and they complied, stunned by this show they were also being forced to perform in.
What the fuck was going on with him? Teasing, smiling, and calling him Draco? Not for the first time in his life, Harry wondered whether he had been poisoned or was just going round the bend.
“Well, a muggle-born witch was visiting her sister a couple of months back and overheard some muggles talking about wands, witches, cauldrons – “
Blinking rapidly in an attempt to take in his surroundings his eyes finally settled on the large board behind the bar that had a list of the names of the drinks and their ingredients. Somehow, Harry’s mouth opened wider. There, plain as day, was an abundance of references to the wizarding world in drink form and a list of their ingredients. Vodka and tomato juice was a Bloody Baron instead of the well-known Bloody Mary. Egg whites, gin and orange liqueur was ‘A Grey Lady’ despite the resulting colour being whiter than it ever could be grey. Everything from Circe’s Tits to Expecto Crapula was listed on the blackboard, written in an elegant script in various colours of chalk.
The tight feeling in his chest, one he had harboured for so long it felt like a part of him, began to loosen. He smiled suddenly into the empty room and basked in the excitement of being just a bit reckless, a hint of who he used to be. And it felt good. It felt good.
It was strange. To have the question hang in the air unanswered. The door opened and they whipped round to look.
“I’d like to celebrate with a mate though.” He sounded awkward and Harry scolded himself for being a total arse.
Harry was surprised at how soothed he felt by being in this room, by being next to Draco. The smell of his shampoo washing over him, the slight buzz from his fridge in the kitchen and the small lamp on the beside that flickered now and again. Harry’s fingers rubbed over the worn cover that topped the bed, faded from age and use.
The town had returned to normal after Fotheringham had been caught. A team of Aurors had come in and rid the place of potions and every other sinister thing lurking in its corners. Harry, of course, had taken nothing to do with it, not since the trial. He and Draco had shown up together, walked hand in hand into the courtroom of the Wizengamot and then sailed happily out again as soon as they could. He thought that at some point he would return to that life more fully, but not just yet.
He examined the assortment of curious items on her desk. Random orbs, dried animal feet and a small portable cauldron that was glowing vibrantly were some of the items taking space.
The woman was heavyset, with round eyes that gave her a very owllike expression, but Harry reasoned she had a kind smile.
Harry had abandoned his ice-cream by this point and was focusing intently on the players, who looked deliriously happy despite their exhaustion from running so hard. “Draco are you watching this?”
Potter it seemed was in two minds. Half his body tuned towards the door to run away screaming and the other half eyeing the bed which must have looked like heaven on earth after being in a bloody tent. He raked his hands through his dark hair and then he climbed under the covers, face burning.
They had found nothing so far. Absolutely nothing. His body was coiled tight as if with the lightest pressure he would spring apart.
It was dimly lit, most of the light coming from the back, obscured by what appeared to be rusted containers and shelves stacked with various bottles and random equipment.
Draco led the way into the small kitchen and put the kettle on the muggle way. This induced a raised eyebrow from Potter but he remained silent, simply watching Draco fetch the cups and tea.
“There he is: boy wonder.” His tone was derisive in an attempt to  make Harry look like an idiot in front of the minister.
When Draco finished the last of tea he put in down on the counter with some finality. “Bed. I’m shattered.”
Writing to Pansy, however, was another story. It made him painfully miss home. He had learned lots about muggle culture in his time here. Enough to see and admire the beauty in their art and histories, but it was akin to learning about life on other planets: interesting but not home.
The mirror could be heard hurling skincare tips to Draco as he walked past. He rolled his eyes and shared a commiserating look with Harry who, determined not to be awkward, walked to the kitchen to make tea.
“I’m going to be here for the next few days. For the investigation. I’ll be dropping in regularly to see how things are.”
Draco seemed relieved that Harry had finally cottoned on and passed him the small vial. He pulled the stopper and looked inside. It certainly looked like a regular cream but when Harry leaned forward to sniff it the scent of Dittany came soaring out of the small jar. He froze and lifted his eyes to Draco.
Harry’s jaw clenched but his voice remained calm, and if he was lucky, slightly threatening. “I won’t have you call him that again, Robards. Understand that.”
“Well, firstly I’m not that drunk. Secondly, it’s important that I send it now because if I wait till tomorrow then I won’t send it.”
Sitting up, he stretched and his feet were grateful for the cool floorboards underneath. The noise of breakfast being made and amusement at the peculiar smell coming from the kitchen forced Harry to detour to the bathroom. Thankfully, he could avoid the conversation of its whereabouts as Malfoy had nodded at the door last night and said ‘Bathroom: don’t listen to anything the mirror tells you,’ and then continued with the rest of the tour.
Draco pointedly ignored him and began to explain to Bernard that Draco’s version of a Slippery Nipple was the same as the widely known version of a Slippery Nipple but, yes, he could add a strawberry if he so desired.
It took less than a second for Draco to realise he had made a grave error. For under the beard and wild hair was a pair of eyes he would recognise even if blind and an expression that was brought out for him and him alone.
The following morning was filled with shy smiles and a determination to figure out how the poisoning had happened.
“…Justice? I don’t know. Anyway, the details of my parole were…are…constrictive.” He felt Potter tense next to him and he hastened to add, “Not unjust, Potter, don’t misunderstand me. I did terrible things and I must pay a price for that. It’s just…the restrictions…let’s just say if I were not in the frame of mind to try and change it would not encourage me to do so.”
When the tea was made he levitated the cups and walked to the bedroom, only hesitating slightly when wondering if doing this was in fact too weird. He decided it most definitely was but would continue nonetheless.
Harry had taken to living in a home full of life and love incredibly easy. Easy as breathing. It was soothing to listen to the crackle of the radio every morning, to hear the doorbell go as Draco’s regulars dropped in some home baking or just to say hello. It often didn’t seem real to him, that he could have this.
Draco laughed and looked back to Harry, who was nowhere to be seen, neither was the van which was more troubling. “What? Dorothy, how did you –“
“It is a fucking magic trick, you arsehole; you’re using magic in front of muggles!” Potter screamed and some birds took flight.
“Shit.” Harry kicked at a stone and surveyed where he stood. Sheep were milling around the hill he was on, and fields went on for miles until they hit the mountain that cut into the cloudless sky. “Shit, shit, shit.”
“Well, I’ll need both of your memories firstly to be submitted into evidence. You’ll need to bring them along, Harry if you don’t mind.” Harry shook his head to indicate that he didn’t. “In your absence, I’ll send along another Auror in place of you, to keep an eye on the suspect.”
Besides the chip shop there was a fish monger, butchers, convenience shop and four pubs which seemed rather excessive. Harry felt that the ‘tourist’ shop didn’t really count as the man who owned seemed to be actively trying to discourage people from visiting judging by his surly demeanour. Harry had gone into speak to him on his first morning of his investigation and was practically chased out of the shop by the old bugger. Some locals had heard the commotion and as he had tripped out the door and stood watching him, suspicion written all over their faces.
He began to mop the juice and pulp off the bar. The ends of his hair were green from the kiwi and cucumber that had dived into the air and then onto his face.
Harry’s grin stretched and he called over to Draco who was now pushing two large cocktails, bright purple and one changing colours to two elderly men in suits. “Hey Draco? This gentlemen would like your Harry Potter special.” For some reason, Harry winked conspiratorially at him. Just he was about to implode with pure embarrassment Draco laughed delightedly and almost skipped over.
Harry seems to forget all his previous Auror training and stumbles forward into the conversation that the two men were having.
Vanishing the broken glass and empty bottles he made a list to send to Fotheringham, his eccentric booze supplier. It was always an experience to meet him in person. He either would not show up to their agreed meeting place or, when he did, greet Draco like a long-lost friend and ply him with strange sandwiches. Draco remarked to himself again on what a peculiar life he now led.
Years ago, when Harry had first came out, Ron would have been profusely apologetic and claimed that, while Harry was definitely handsome – he was most definitely straight. Harry had eventually lost count how many times he had explained to Ron that, despite having a dick, Harry was not attracted to him. At all. In any capacity. Ron had eventually taken the hint and regularly offered to wingman for Harry. It never worked, obviously. Ron was incredibly straight and seemed to send everyone who liked dick, male or female, running for the hills.
Kingsley was not alone in his office. Robards was also there and threw a dirty look at Harry as soon as he stepped into the room, lip curled nastily on his face.
Harry paused in order to ensure his reply gave little away. “Yeah, we’ve been working closely. He knows the town well, obviously, and the people.” And because he was an idiot proceeded to add, “He’s really clever actually. I never knew that about him. And funny. But shit at making cocktails if I’m being really honest.”
Not much longer, Harry’s mind intoned. He opened his mouth to say something, anything, but a gruff call from Robards stopped him.
He looked so young then, just a boy. A boy with a beautiful face and sharp edges. Tears fell and hung on his chin, unsure of where to go.
There was a crack in the air and then silence. Harry was floored. He looked around the room to see other faces matching his though perhaps without the pinch of desperation that he no doubt had.
“Why don’t you use a barber then? I think there’s one near the edge of the village,” Harry said. Draco looked coldly at him and then resumed lying on the floor. “Really, I don’t know why you’re fussing. I think your hair is…nice.” Draco stopped fussing with it and turned his head to see Harry clearer. “I mean, well, it’s soft and it’s blond so that’s a bonus, right?”
Draco threw a helpless look at Harry and began a quiet, as was possible in the noisy pub, conversation that seemed to be mostly Draco looking mortified and hissing things at her and she continuing to cackle in return.
A man, shorter but broader than himself, stood there with a thunderous look on his face. It did something to Draco’s insides and he felt himself squirming under the man’s gaze.
They crept forwards, scanning all around them for threats. He could tell Ron was doing this a bit more thoroughly than he was. The closer they got, the voices became more distinct: between four and seven, male and viciously unpleasant.
Fotheringham, as if only remembering that Harry was present, flashed a row of pearly white teeth at him. The guy felt about as friendly as a Great White.
Kingsley could clearly smell some sort of victory as he smiled mischievously and leant back in his chair, arms stretching over his head.
In his field, there was no such thing as coincidences. Simply connections; sometimes harmless, sometimes not.
She hesitated and then rolled her eyes and headed for the open window to call the owl. He called thank you and then brought his head out the fireplace. The motion caused a wave of nausea and he fell backwards onto the rug. He lay there, starfished on the rough material and stared at the ceiling as it danced and twirled around the room.
As soon as Draco opened his mouth to speak Potter stood up abruptly and announced his departure. Draco was left staring after him and trying not to look at the bastard’s arse as he walked away.
They made their way to the bottom of the village and decided to make their way up, one shop at a time. Draco used this time to keep in touch with some of his regulars and do some errands along the way. They had picked up tonight’s dinner, bulbs and Harry had to stop Draco from buying some new electric grill that was all the rage.
“Nope. I mean they’re not that new an invention are they? Every time he calls, I have to talk him through how to use it. I think I am the only number he has to be honest, seems like he doesn’t get much practise. I usually write to him in order to prevent the ridiculous conversations like that.”
“Draco…you made mistakes in your past, we all have, but I think anyone that knows you now can see that you’re different. You’ve paid – are paying – for those mistakes.” Harry found that he believed wholeheartedly in what he was saying. He wasn’t sure how he had come to this feeling so quickly but it felt true to him nonetheless.
Capricious as ever, the weather changed suddenly, and a large raindrop fell on his forehead and ran down his face.
Draco peeked inside the basket and saw an assortment of breads and pastries, his stomach grumbled. Harry had fobbed off breakfast this morning in what Draco saw was an attempt to not put anything near his mouth lest it get him in trouble.
Harry was looking the woman behind the bar, and he just didn’t get a feeling that she was a witch. Everything she did by hand was too methodical and practised.
Harry started immediately, mentally thanking Hermione for her knowledge of healing spells and persistence on forcing her knowledge upon others. “Send a Patronus to the ministry while I do this –“
Harry is making his way over to the shop assistant with a small gas cooker in one hand and something he isn’t quite sure of in the other when a conversation stops him dead.
For the past two days, he had spent his time in the local cafes and in and out of the touristy shops or along the meandering country paths and so far, did not have one single lead. Not one.
“I keep questioning things. Things about myself that  I  know are there but I haven’t really thought about before.” He sucked in a shuddering breath. “I think perhaps it’s always been there but I’ve avoided thinking about it. Like right now, I’m talking and thinking about it without actually talking or thinking about it.”
When they left the shop, Draco was speaking quickly. “…just knew it. Her skin was flawless, no scars or anything and I could just tell there was something about it. And as soon as I smelled it I was literally thrown back to using everyday as a teenager.”
Craning his neck, he read the name: The Cock’s Comeuppance. Pictured next to the sign was a rather grim picture of the severed head of a rooster. Lovely.
Harry stepped forward, a need for Draco to understand his point pressing on him. He cupped Draco’s face between his two hands. “No, you did beautifully. You were confident and brave and clever…” Draco gulped. His tongue darted over his bottom lip. “And, we got lots of information from him. You can submit your memory for evidence and we’ve got a good case. I couldn’t do this without you, thank you.”
Gingerly, he turned his head to get a look at him. The sight that met him did something to him, for the man in front of him could not be Malfoy.
“…exactly, exactly. So, I staggered to the bar, practically paralytic at this point, and I asked him what he would recommend, and you know what he comes back with?”
“Ah,” Said Draco, smirking properly now, “Am I about to get a glimpse of the magic that is Harry Potter detecting?”
Harry had to supress a smirk at his flushed cheeks. “Sorry,” Malfoy said with a wary smile. “Not used to having people in my bed.” Upon this confession, his face reddened even further. “Are you hungry? For breakfast? Do you want breakfast? I’ll make breakfast.” And then he was practically jumping out of bed and marching towards the kitchen.
The heels of his palms pressed into his eyes as he worked on the complicated act of sucking oxygen into his lungs. “This can’t be happening. Can’t be happening. Potter tell me what you need me to say – what’s going on?”
Somehow leaving this weird little town and leaving Draco was causing some kind of dilemma within him.
The place was a mess. Juice and booze lined the counters and the glasses piled high in the sink, threatening to topple. Draco was confronted by the stark difference between his current and former life. If he had known at fourteen this was how he would be spending his time he would have felt humiliated. At seventeen…at seventeen he would be surprised he was still alive and in one piece.
When Harry looked closer, he could see Malfoy leaning into every friendly touch and gesture the women offered. Perhaps it was loneliness. Harry could understand. The pull of wanting to just reach out and touch someone, to have them touch you.
“I can’t believe you are sleeping with Draco Malfoy, Harry. You are so predictable.” She began giggling and Harry gave up all pretence, knowing all cries of indignation would fall upon deaf ears.
“My hair is incredibly delicate and the ends are ruined from the subpar hairdressing skills of this place.”
“I told you last weekend, the Willow gets you going and then he gives you a Bloody Baron and all bets are off!”
Potter turned his attention back on Draco. “So, you’re saying all of this is harmless? No muggles are being hurt in your culinary adventures? And, just out of curiosity, don’t they think your taste in drink names are alarming if not downright bonkers?”
Draco Malfoy was standing in a muggle bar currently drenched in fruit juice for the third time that day. He was attempting to use the blender but was having trouble working the buttons and remembering to put the lid on.
“Different things. I can’t Apparate without requesting permission – fair. I am forbidden from using anything beyond the most basic spells – understandable.”
Harry turned and was immediately alarmed by the look on Draco’s face. He was smiling, that was certain, but the smile seemed a bit…well, manic to be honest. Grey eyes were wide and his smile tight.
Harry smiled, eyes crinkling and teeth showing at Draco’s clever and evasive way of wheedling information out of him. “And we’re speaking here of hypotheticals of course?”
Draco approached the bar and noticed that it was mostly the regulars that were left, and some didn’t look half as drunk as they should for the time of night, so Draco resolved to get back to work.
Harry sighed. “I don’t think that’s up to you, you know. I think that, if people don’t want to forgive you, then that’s their right. But if they want to, then they should.”
“No, no, no…” The tallest of the two was saying, shaking his head vehemently. “That’s not the one that knocks you on your arse, it’s the Whomping Willow that does it.”
Draco’s eyes were roaming his face as if trying to commit it to memory and Harry almost couldn’t comprehend it. For it was almost painful looking at Draco, at his face and his hair. His lips. It caused and ache that went from his heart to his stomach. And to touch him? It awoke every nerve in his body.
Potter continued grumbling until they reached the flat and grumbled some more when Draco insisted Potter take his boots off before coming inside.
Robards swivelled round to look at him. “Are you mental or have you gone soft? You hate the bleeding lot of them, more cause to hate them than anyone and here you are…are you fucking him or something? I think we’ll need a reason for this change of heart.”
When they both went back to Draco’s flat that night, he declared that his life’s ambition was to continue working at the Cock’s Comeuppance, and no he would not change the damned name, and buy the cutest cottage he had ever seen. So that was how they found themselves house hunting in the muggle town that had brought them together. And if Draco had Confunded the estate agent into accepting the asking price then who was to know.
“Are you serious about him?” She asked the question as one might ask to pass the salt. He felt more indebted to this woman than he could put into words.
He all but staggered to the kitchen, wondering if the alcohol he had had the last few nights had addled his brain.
When he had first gotten his job in the pub, Draco had wondered why Tempy was impressed with his work ethic. It took him a couple of months to realise that it was because he was using magic, and therefore got the work done in no time at all, and she was in fact impressed at his superhuman speed. When Draco was ill for a couple of weeks last year, Tempy had strong-armed her nephew in taking over his roles. When she discovered that he had taken four times as long as Draco had, as he was obviously sans magic, she had continually berated him and the poor sod had taken packet of pickled onion crisps to the face as a reward.
“And so were you. So were you! God, I don’t even know why you’re here, how you can stand being around me. Doesn’t it kill you?”
With a deep breath he dumped his back at the door and walked to him. Hands wavered uncertainly at his sides before he brought them to either side of Draco’s face. He looked incredible fragile to him then, pink lips wobbling slightly.
A Patronus, some bird Harry couldn’t quite place flew passed him and through the door. It came out a few seconds later and Marion sneered at it, her lip curling. It was an unusual look for her usually kind face.
Nodding, he stepped around his chair and went to put on his Auror’s robes. The fabric was thick in his hands. Shame curled in his stomach to wear it and not contribute. He swallowed the thought down and shoved his arms in the billowing sleeve.
“Weird like what? If I’m being honest, you’re the weirdest thing I’ve spoken to in a while, now away you go!”
Harry shook his head. He was numb. The chill of his fingertips had seeped inside him and was refusing to leave. “They won’t tell me anything. Keep ignoring me. I don’t think it’s a good sign.”
He was keenly aware of Potter watching his every move, no doubt expecting Draco to poison the daft bugger rather than just give him dairy induced diarrhoea.
Draco’s sneered at him, “Well thankfully I have this brute to help me,” he said, nodding at Harry who frowned back at him feigning annoyance. Draco winked at him.
Draco’s breaths, shallow and panicked, was the only thing to be heard on the receiver besides some footsteps.
“Not the Manor; home. The wizarding world I grew up with. The only thing I know. I must alert the ministry if I intend to stay more than twenty four hours in a wizarding town. I…I haven’t known anything else besides the world I grew up in and I know that my education on anything outside of my world was severely lacking but…I can’t go home. Have you ever felt homesick?”
Draco had been pleased at the usefulness of the cloak for all of five minutes before he clicked that it was the reason Harry had probably gotten away with so  much shit while at Hogwarts.
The first thing he was aware of, other than the need to piss, was the dip in the bed next which he knew by this point was Harry. He was reading a quidditch magazine that Draco kept by the bed but couldn’t quite push himself to read. He tended to avoid all things that caused him discomfort and reminders wakened an ache in his chest, so he left them be.
Harry nodded dumbly, took out his wand. His mind tried to summon a memory, one that was happy enough for a Patronus. Nothing came to him. Happiness had never felt to acutely out of reach as it was at this second with Draco’s eyes closed and his shirt sodden with his own blood.
“Apparently.” Draco was distracted by his ice-cream dripping down his hand. He licked a drip from his finger and Harry had to look away.
That lead to them buying the cottage, Draco continuing to work in the pub and Harry considering an apprenticeship to teach at Hogwarts.
There was a disembodied cackle from the other side of the bar. “You really are shite at this whole bartending thing, Draco.”
Smith was frozen between picking up the charmed quills and parchment and staring at Harry with growing horror.
“Anyway,” Ron sighed heavily, picking at fraying arms of the chair. “Everyone’s heading to the pub, if you fancy it.”
The man paid and left Harry and Draco standing awkwardly in his wake. A glass smashed on the other side of the bar and Draco almost ran to fix it.
To stop himself from staring at the way the veins in those pale arms were showing, Harry set about firing all the cleaning charms he knew at various areas of the room. Floor, ceiling, tables – anything away from the bar and the man lying atop it, stretched out like a cat.
As he caught her up on the case, she eventually twigged that he was being vague on some important aspects. “So you’ve been working closely with him then? With Malfoy?” Her face appeared nonchalant but judging by the way her eyes continued to dart sideways at him he knew she was dying for more details.
Suddenly, Draco was at his side, ashen white even under the lights of the pub. “Harry…Harry, he’s been poisoned. That’s a reaction to a potion. The smell its – I recognise it…Harry he’s –“
As Harry came to stand next to Draco, the man’s expression faltered slightly. “What’s this? A friend, introduce us at once!” He held his smile in place but his eyes roved about Harry’s face which immediately made him want to touch his fringe.
“Hi. Would you by any chance have an envelope? And an owl. To send the envelope. I’m not just sending envelopes I have a letter to send. But I need an envelope and an owl in order to send it.”
The room was dimly lit. Blue and yellow light were projected onto the walls, showing Draco’s heartbeat and vitals. Seeing the waves soothed Harry instantly.
Harry’s stomach lurched. “Sorry. Habit.” He said by way of explanation because apparently he didn’t want to see any sad smiles lining Malfoy’s face.
For the second time that day, a knock came to Harry’s door. It was loud and obnoxious and not waiting for an answer so Harry knew right away it was Ron.
“So,” he began, “you’ll take Malfoy’s statement – perhaps away from here – and then when you’re done send it over to me.” Harry nodded and Draco continued to look at the floor, at anywhere but Ron it seemed. “You alright with that, Malfoy?”
He looked at Draco and thought of the nights they had spent in the same bed, telling each other things, how Draco said his name, how he had felt when Harry held him, came inside him and the stag left his wand. It wasn’t happy, per se, but it was strong.
“Bit of a big thing to forget to specify.” When Draco raised his eyebrow at this, Harry added, “I mean not that I think you would do anything with it. I know that, just…weird is all.”
The bell of the shop door tinkled and the door was thrown open and voice, like nails down a blackboard, boomed its greeting.
Harry handed out the drinks, attempting to keep the grimace from his face. On his walk to the bar he caught Draco’s eye. He had been watching him and now smiled softly from across the room. Harry felt a buzzing in his ears, heart thumping from behind his ribs.
It was a struggle not to roll his eyes at this man he had to call his boss. Harry had learned pretty quickly that Robards was more concerned with how things looked rather than doing the right thing. And Harry really wanted to give him a bloody thesaurus as all of his sentences began with ‘right’ or ‘let’s go’ and, worst of all, ‘Potter! Here!’
“Okay, well we’ll have to just get you to sign something to say it was an accident and then we can – “
Harry stopped in his tracks. “Wait, what if…what if it’s not a weird accident and potions aren’t being someone mixed up and in the hands of muggles what if someone is living here under the guise of being a muggle.”
“Should we, I don’t know, look at some of the shops more closely? Since it seems to be potions based?” Draco asked when Harry finally took a breath from asking him questions.
“And others have for more. We don’t get to choose how people feel about us, Draco. We just get to try.”
By the time midnight had come and gone Draco was stomping upstairs to his cramped flat and cursing all men with green eyes and great arses to hell and back.
It was rather a lot of booze, even for Draco. Besides the boxes that were littering the counters, large bottles of unknown quantities of alcohol dotted about between the transfigured glasses.
He thought about the way that Draco had never turned his back at the man, had walked in front of Harry the entire time and seemed genuinely wary in his presence overall. “You don’t trust him.” It was supposed to be a question but came out more like a fact. For he knew it was true. Had spent enough time watching Malfoy as a child to know what it looked like when he didn’t trust you. When he was trying to keep himself safe.
With a giggle, the blond turned around and snaked his arms round Harry’s neck. His eyes were light grey from the sun, cheeks pinked from running about all day or from proximity to Harry. Harry liked to think it was the latter.
He flew the tent’s flap open without even removing his wand from his sleeve and summoned his Auror’s notebook. Scribbles were in there already, mostly complete rubbish and nothing compared to what he had now. Something was happening in this place, and someone was most definitely feeding these muggles information about the Wizarding world.
Some women who looked to be in their late sixties, gushed when they saw Malfoy. They commented on how well he looked and if he was eating enough (they would make him something if not) and patted his cheek affectionately.
“Aye, just a few drops before they go out and play. Put it in their water and they’re right as rain when they go out.”
He was really panicking now. Mouth dry, palms sweating and a small tremor in his body tell-tale signs that he had about five more minutes of normalcy before all hell broke loose within him.
Harry was perplexed. It had been so long since he had properly questioned someone while on the job that he was worried he had forgotten how to do it.
The night air was cool and cleared his head. Owls hooted in the distance and the path was dark, clusters of trees either side of him.
Draco’s head began to shake of its own volition, and he began to backup into the shelves behind him, but Potter was quicker. A hand had grabbed the front of his shirt and was dragging him out from behind the bar and to the nearest exit. Thankfully Tempy was on shift tonight and could take over, even if she were shit at making the cocktails.
“No…but I feel that I deserve an explanation for your need to call stuff after wizarding things in front of muggles. It’s weird, you’ve got to admit.”
“Onto business then. Robards is going to take the memories you’ve brought and submit them into evidence. We’ll have one of the detectives look into it in the ministry pensieve.”
It had been the only time in his life that he had felt timeless, tied to the earth through salt and breath. Draco had cried and they had laughed about it. Harry’s lips had kissed them away, cherishing each one as they melted Draco and changed him into something that was Harry’s.
Harry briefly wondered if it was act. If it were, then Malfoy had had to have been to drama school since the last time Harry had met him. Something inside him, an instinct that he had neglected for so long, told him that this was genuine.
He realised that, if what Malfoy said was true, he had been on his own for the past couple of years with only the people around here to keep him company.
Fotheringham grinned lasciviously; it made Harry’s skin crawl. “Well, dear Draco, if your little Pureblood bow didn’t give it away then smelling cured Firewhiskey certainly ought to.”
“Harry? You’re okay, but I need you to come back to me. I need you to help me, you can do it. Breathe, Harry.”
“What? Why the fuck would you do that?” Draco had sat up on his elbows to study Harry, his eyes wide and face pinched in confusion.
Again, this felt like flirting, but it had been so long he couldn’t be sure. “Positive.” Draco smiled properly now, with all his teeth like his mother taught him.
“I literally can’t explain it another way to you. If you reverse it up that pathway, you won’t get it back down.”
“Harry that’s not normal. They’re anticipating every move, never missing a step. I mean are muggles just better at sports than wizards? Without magic, does it somehow make up your other senses. It’s weird.”
Draco studied him for a moment, eyes clouded in thought as they took in every detail of his face. Nodding, he squeezed Harry’s hand that was still gripped on his and began walking again.
Harry took his hands from Draco’s hips and instead cupped his face. “Draco – look at you…nothing in the world would make me want to be anywhere else.”
“Really? Hmm.” He returned to the business of making a mess and Harry, in an attempt to do anything but stand and stare at him, began to make tea.
“But he is also is a supplier to me, Harry. I can remember every time that I have spoken with him or met with him.”
“Kingsley are you listening to this drivel? I told you from the start it was a daft idea to send this one off to the middle of nowhere to investigate this case. And low and behold, here he is spouting rubbish about a Death Eater assisting with an investigation.”
The man was carefully following Draco’s hand, apparently mesmerised, and continued to stand very still and stern looking.
Harry expected Draco to smile and gush as he did with the women earlier but instead he wore a polite smile that didn’t reach his eyes.
“Harry, will you be a total darling and fetch me some more of that new vodka that was delivered this morning? It’s the disgustingly pink coloured stuff we got today. I’ve completely ran out since the golf group at the back keep bloody ordering the Pink Dolores.”
It was a blur to Harry, a haze in which the only thing in focus was Draco; how his breaths came, how he fitted around Harry, opened for him. The sounds he made in Harry’s ear when his tongue grazed just below Draco’s jaw.
She marched away from him and took off down the small curving path, two Border Collies close behind.
Draco was panting, his hands still tied to the chair. Harry moved his hands over the chair and the bindings fell limply to the sides. “No, no, no, no – Draco? Can you hear me, Draco? Can you – fuck. Its – I don’t – Draco, where is it? Where did it hit you? I can’t see it. Fuck. Draco? Ron! RON! Help him, Ron, please! Draco?”
Tempy smirked again, a bright red corkscrew curl falling into her eyes. “It’s not exactly rocket science, is it?”
Voices of different kinds could be heard distantly as their hosts scuttled around to get a better view of what was happening. From the corner of his eye he could see the little row of cottages perched along the cobblestone, appearing disgruntled at the ongoing ruckus disturbing their usual peace.
“Well, you’re not going alone, that’s for sure, I’m coming. I wouldn’t trust the slimy git as far as I could throw him.”
“He’s had a time of it, that’s for sure. But, yes, he’ll live. He lost a lot of blood, and it was close, closer than I would have liked. The healers are still attending to him, then you can see him.” She pressed her lips together tightly and raised the corners. It took a second for Harry to realise it was a smile.
“I think he might do that, especially since he is the reason for my friend’s sudden...interest in exploring this…” He gestured to nothing in particular as a way to explain himself.
“Problem here, Weasley. Can you speak privately? Your office floo in two minutes.” The eel thing didn’t wait for a reply and slithered out the room again.
Draco giggled, his cheeks were pink and his lips stretched into a lopsided smile. He rolled his eyes at him. “Don’t be absurd, it was a moderate performance at best.”
“Wait, Harry – it’s fine, not your responsibility anymore mate.” Ron’s brown were knitted together and was looking at Harry strangely.
The supplier in question was an eccentric. Terrifically quaffed hair, peppered black and grey and pale eyes that missed nothing.
As Draco and Fotheringham began to talk business, Harry walked around examining the proposed merchandise. Most of the names he had never heard of, despite feeling fairly comfortable in the muggle world.
The garden was looking slightly wild as they hadn’t gotten around to trimming much yet but it did have a free-spirited feeling about it. Harry had been instructed to hang up some lights and lanterns while Draco had transfigured almost every piece of furniture they had in order to provide enough seats.
"I have no idea what you're talking about professor. If this is about my performance in class, I assure you that there will definitely be improvements now that there are less...distractions."
They were in the Great Hall and neither him nor his friends gave anything away with their facial expressions. No one would've noticed the little details, how blaise gripped the letter in his hand more tightly, how Pansy didn't take another sip from her cup of coffee, and how Draco didn't make a usual snarky comment.
"I have to go to class right now. I'm afraid I won't be able to do my usual greetings to the creatures. Would you please greet the Therusians for me on the way to your classroom?"
Draco looked at her in confusion. He was looking forward to a nice silent walk back to the castle. Instead, Lovegood was starting on some strange nonsense again.
All Draco could do was nod. The trio then wrapped each other in one big hug while Pansy and Blaise muttered assurances. They were going to get through this. They'll live until they're fucking 150 years old and die peacefully in their sleep surrounded by loved ones.
He won't get to hear Pansy's usual complaints about the ongoing drama. He won't get to hear Blaise's sarcastic remarks everytime they do something stupid. He won't be there for their 50th  birthdays, their weddings, their milestones, their highs, their lows.
Before, he would have easily been smug about the achievement and gloated at the golden trio, practically rubbing it in their faces. Made some remarks, made them rise to the bait, especially Potter.
Pansy scowled at him. "Well what do you expect? It hasn't exactly been nice and happy since..." She stopped herself and bit her bottom lip.
Lovegood cooed and started making conversation with the damn bird while Draco opened the envelope to read the letter inside.
He'd been trying to talk to his friends. Or were they still friends? Draco hoped they were. But as time passed, that hope seemed to fade.
"So I was right," Draco looked back at the paper in his hands. His chest felt hollow, which was ironic since it was filled with a bunch of flowers. "I'm hated so much that I only have 2 to 3 years to live. I was right."
"We," he took in a sharp breath, "we've been taught all our lives how...we're at the top. We're the ones who are superior. We're the ones of supreme bloodline who deserve magic's gift."
"Look..." his voice had an edge to it. He's been thinking about this ever since he discovered that it was Hanahaki. Unrequited love to the point that he would cough out blood? Why? What exactly determined something to be unrequited for this affliction? He eventually came to a conclusion.
Everywhere he, Pans, and Blaise turned, they would be there watching from a corner, whispering to one another.
Draco doubted anyone would care if he was out after curfew. He also had an inkling that the same applied to Lovegood.
He put on the indifferent mask, kept his chest out and head up. Draco knew he couldn't show weakness. He was a Malfoy. Malfoys don't slouch. Malfoys don't get hurt. And Malfoys don't get affected by the concept of friendship.
Draco felt rage pool at the pit of his stomach like lava returning deep into the magma. "I," he gritted out, "am not a charity case for you to–"
The professors were also much more lenient in their classes as students discussed about the upcoming ball and weren't paying as much attention. Merlin, even the heads of the houses had to teach the students how to waltz, including Snape!
"You don't even know half of it!" Was this it? Had his own godfather not been able to see, to understand him from the very fucking start?
Pansy nodded. "Yep, it turns out it was all a ruse to get their crushes to notice and stop being in denial. From what it looks like, at least Diggory will be reaping some success from this."
"Oh my, the derulites will be coming any moment now. We really must head back inside." And with that she stood up in some sort of floaty motion. Draco didn't know how that was even possible.
Draco nodded as he returned the hug. He can't keep doing this. He can't keep making his friends worry like this about him.
Draco looked at his two friends. He could imagine it already, how desperate they'll be everyday. How they'll hole themsleves up researching for even a sliver of an answer to help their friend.
Draco and Blaise nodded at their friend. Draco could notice Blaise was on the brink of exploding with suggestions for what she should do.
"They hate me. They have to hate me to a point where my feelings for them won't even reach them. It's to the point that magic believes that I deserve this."
Draco watched as Severus settled behind his desk and look Draco in the eye. "Do I need to ask you or will you save us both the time and inform me of what is actually going on?"
"Ah, if it isn't the Golden boy who has decided to grace us with his presence," Draco could already hear an extra layer of wrath on top of what Draco had caused a few days ago.
"Just this once," Draco said with a smile but it sounded like a plea. "Just this once, let's believe that wish was real."
Draco found himself standing by a lake, overlooking the rippling water, no doubt by the giant squid.
Draco really wished he didn't have to deal with a worrying Pansy. Angry Pansy was scary and terrifying. She could make your life a living nightmare. But worrying Pansy was just as bad, constantly fretting over you like his Mother. She would hover over you and if you snapped at her well...Anyway, at least it wasn't a mix of angry and worrying Pansy. That one was the worst.
Draco frowned. It really was too weird to see Potter with anything but hostility in his eyes when looking at him. It just...didn't sit right with Draco.
"Yes...I do know your name is Luna Lovegood..." he spoke slowly, wondering why she was beginning another conversation with that.
"Do you really think I'm joking?" Draco gripped tightly on the book in his hands. It was open at the page describing the disease.
"Bloody hell—Potter!? Let go of me before you actually pass on whatever contagious ailment you have going on."
"Yes, waltz, geez Malfoy." He rolled his eyes, attempting to return the sense of rivalry that had since been long gone. "If you didn't want to, you could've just said-"
Where was the cruel plan and the tragedy about to happen to him? He didn't see any evil within this container of treacle tart…
are up to these days? Potter, Teddy is my cousin," Draco began. "I'm a Healer. If he were sick, Aunt Andromeda would've contacted me immediately. I also know for a fact that he hates dancing with passion, at least this type." He paused for a second, which was enough time for Harry to start panicking.”Now, we could sit down and acknowledge your raging internalized homophobia over tea, or you can get out of my Manor
Draco briefly wondered what Harry thought of him as a person. Perhaps he'd even gone and assumed the blond had no friends and was a loner, but the truth was, everyone in Slytherin knew how to socialize and they did it well.
"I just needed some fresh air, I guess," Draco said with a shrug. "I fucked up a little, no one to talk about it with."
“Well, what’s new?” Draco gave a cheeky grin. It was like nothing had changed, but they’d grown so much. It was like coming home after a long, painful journey.
Nearing the end of the holiday, Harry perhaps found another moment he could engrave into memory; another memory so happy he could cast Expecto Patronum—until he ruined it. Again.
Draco snorted. Because Harry had gotten it right. He stretched his arms because it felt so nice to have gotten it out of his system.
"I get that. I also think it's such a small problem, I think that's what partly makes it so bad. I'm panicking over something so small that it barely even matters when just about everyone else out there has problems much larger than me," Draco admitted.
? It was absolutely worse than the first year incident where he rejected Draco's handshake. It was horrible, it was the worst, and Harry regretted it to this day how he hadn't attempted to amend the situation or their relationship.
If he'd fallen asleep in class every day, he'd have to say goodbye to his prince title. And probably his parents' sanity. His friends would think his sanity had flown out the window then, and he would agree.
"Yes," Harry said with all conviction he could muster, as if the word itself didn't have him questioning all his morals and life choices. "More specifically, waltz. Because Teddy wants to. Waltz, I mean."
“Oh, but it brings color into our relationship, dearest Aunt,” Draco spoke, giving Harry a look. “It really gets him going when I call him names, especially in bed, such as-”
Harry Potter looked at the (somehow) heart-shaped bottle filled with pink-ish perfume which had just been shoved into his hand. He looked and stared and glared. And finally read, "Treacle… tart?"
kind, working." Before Harry could offer a rebuttal, Malfoy had pushed him out the door, his farewell being, "See you Friday, Potter."
Draco didn’t answer, holding Harry close yet his emotions were locked far away. It was driving Harry mad.
After the third day of Draco's perfume change, Harry came up to him straight after shower, just while the blond was done using his clothes, and he asked, "What fucking perfume are you using?"
It seemed a month of bonding was enough to make one fall head over heels for another. Harry had found out firsthand during that winter. Perhaps it was indeed the sexual tension hanging in the air between them since day one, but—
"Right. Okay. Waltz," Malfoy said calmly, an eyebrow arched as he took in Harry's appearance. He was scrutinizing him, trying to see what was behind his obvious unnatural facade. Harry hoped his facial expression hadn't exposed him, but oh who was he kidding? With the way he was jumping from toe to toe, with the way Malfoy was looking at him with such intensity—
Harry had never wanted to sob as much as he did at that moment, in Draco's arms, in the middle of the Manor's ballroom in a random Friday evening. He swore he'd start begging if there was any chance still, of this being an everyday occurrence, of
It was almost eight (night, to him, was past nine P.M) and his parents were not home yet. They were busy.
Draco was neither surprised at the sudden confrontation nor the use of curse words so early in the morning. Another hint that he was preparing something. Apparently, he found his boyfriend's clueless desperation ridiculous as he started dissolving into a fit of giggles. It only took as long as saying 'fucking perfume' before it turned into a full-blown out laugh.
In their temporary goodbye, Draco braved himself to give him a peck on the cheek. From the way Harry's cheeks reddened even more (it already was, from the cold autumn wind) it was obvious he wasn't the only one a bit shy from it, a bit delighted.
"It's a matter of…  tardiness. We're not supposed to show it where I'm from, I mean my family. I'm afraid they'll tell them and then it'll just go downhill from there."
It was only then that Harry dared to look into Draco’s eyes. “Really? You’re really giving me another chance? Even though I’ve been an utter asshole?”
“I think Teddy and I have heard enough,” she declared, lifting the sleepy boy from the chair. He’d dozed off, thankfully not awake enough to hear the dirty turn the conversation was taking. Harry felt his face burning and he wanted to scold Draco, but what could he say? He did enjoy some name-calling. “You have the guest room all to yourself, boys. Please do cast a Silencing Charm if you decide to practice the arts of name-calling today. I’ll see you tomorrow.
The problem was, his parents knew of his wrecked sleeping schedule. 'Course they didn' t care enough to actually do something about it, assuming it was simply out of his tenacity that he didn't sleep. He supposed it didn't cross their minds that he had problems sleeping, and asking for a therapist or any kind of psychological help would be futile as they'd just get angry at him and think he was out to ruin their family's status.
The way Harry switched into Potter set alarm bells ringing in his ears, but he couldn't think. He couldn't process what was going on; a second ago his heart was beating so fast it might've burst out of ecstacy and now the (supposedly) love of his life was looking at him like was a monster, because of his own words nonetheless. "It- I
"I meant tomorrow and the tomorrows after, you doofus." Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. "So, can we? I have a cafe I like, since that's what people apparently like nowadays. Or we can just sit on whichever bench you want, if you prefer that."
When Draco pointed this out in the library as they sat together, he got angry at first. Dumbledore was dying, how could he 'step foot in war'? Draco himself had been the one who almost killed him. But then he finally took some time to blow of some steam and rethink. It made sense, didn't it?
"I'm not homophobic!" Harry had exclaimed firmly, but Merlin knew what a lie it was. It took a lot of meetings with his Mind Healer to understand the concept of internalized homophobia. The cursed thing had bloomed out of the expectations from other people, being the Chosen One and Savior of the Wizarding World would do that to someone.
“I thought you were above name-calling,” Andromeda spoke with a disapproving shake of her head, although by the twist of her lips, she looked rather amused.
Draco hugged him. For real, instead of the close (yet never close enough) proximity that the dance had them in. “Shh, Harry, it’s okay. Breathe, love,” he whispered gently, as if talking to a child. And if hearing the word ‘love’ from Draco’s lips didn’t become his undoing, Harry didn’t know what would.
"And now you insist that I teach you what, to dance?" Malfoy shot back, distaste clearly plastered on his whole being.
"I don't think I can talk to any of them about this matter specifically. They've always been there for me, don't get me wrong, since we were in diapers even, but…" he trailed off. "We're still quite different, I think, them and me. We've different worries and priorities, so they won't understand why I'm worrying so much about this problem and won't sympathize. Worst scenario is they laugh at me."
Draco glanced at his evening tea. He wasn't in the mood to eat, yet the familiar treat he wished would calm him down brought nothing but a feeling of sourness on his tongue. It was too late to put it back in the teacup, that'd be horrible table manners. He forced himself to down it. He wondered what went wrong, maybe he sprinkled too much sugar?
The rich scent of his cologne, the coldness of his palms that somehow never went damp even though Harry could always feel his own sweating because of nerves, and how he still dyed his hair the same highlights from years ago… It really did feel like coming back home.
Shame flooded him as he was reminded of the nice, extravagant life he owned. Wanting to throw that away just for a simple mistake seemed so… lame, especially for how far he'd come. How much he'd endured. It was just falling asleep in class, for god's sake. Why couldn't he-
At home, Draco's worries surged up the surface in full force, but he was exhausted and the moment he touched his bed, he fell into a merciful, deep sleep.
He was so tired, but he willed his legs to move. It was late, but he couldn't bear to be inside this house any longer, just mulling over nothing that mattered. He grabbed his coat and walked outside, almost wanting to cry for the relief the evening wind brought him. It was ecstacy; temporary, fleeting.
Draco gaped at him. Back then, Harry had thought it was because he was shocked at the rejection, but now he thought it was just because the outspoken lie was too outrageous. Unthinkable. "Is the concept of bisexuality lost on you, Potter?"
They shared numbers and talked for a bit more. A bit meant two hours in their dictionary, finally willing to leave when Harry's parents called him to return home.
Harry Potter could only follow his blond prat of a boyfriend to their room, planning to perhaps buy a treacle tart-flavored lube later.
"Teddy," was the first thing that came to mind. It was the only common ground the two rivals had, and Harry knew for a fact that that kid was Malfoy's undoing. The blond would do anything for him. "He asked me to ask his cousin, which is you, by the way.” Malfoy sent him a look that said,
He had thought to talk to Pansy or Blaise about it, but they were different from him. They were perfect. They had no flaws, did no mistakes, and even if they did, they covered everything up perfectly well. And besides, the spotlight wasn't on them. He was the prince of Slytherin, no matter how much he currently loathed that title that was given to him.
But they were right. It was his fault. If he'd forced himself to sleep, or forced himself to stay awake during class, it would've been fine.
Harry had to admit he was a bit extra. Hearing those words, he quite literally just jumped into the blond’s arms. “I love you, I love you, I love you,” he chanted like a mantra.
“Fair enough, okay,” Harry said. “About the internalized homophobia, I’ve talked about it. With my Mind Healer. A lot of help actually, she was, but regardless… That’s why I’m here, hoping it’s not too late and you’d still accept me.” Draco was about to say something, but the raven beat him to it because, “Wait. I need to do this properly. I am so sorry, I am
," Draco continued, entering a weird state of monologue and completely ignoring his boyfriend's existence, as per usual every time he wished to mock Harry. Even so, he still addressed Harry, "Dearest Potter, I came upon this perfume in an online shop and decided to buy it—because muggles make the most curious things," he said while he rummaged through his large dressing table, "And viola!"
The raven could only shake his head and start stomping down the guest room, face still burning and undeniably as red as the Weasley hair. He jumped onto the bed with crossed arms. “You shameless asshole!”
It didn't take Harry long to realize the very intoxicating and maddening smell didn't come from whatever liquid his blonde boyfriend sprayed on his clothes every day, but it was Draco himself. Draco was so very special, so very lovely, so very fragrant. And besides, Harry would be fucked—and probably very fucking angry—if he actually found something that smelt as exotic, dangerous, warm, lovely, and home-y as his Draco.
“Then whyever is Teddy not here now?” the blond asked, showing is obvious distaste at Harry's existence.
"You're a pureblood, you know this stuff. I know you know this stuff," Harry claimed with nothing to back him up. What a good thing to be a Gryffindor—sometimes brave and stupid aligned.
“Um,” Harry was taken aback. He thought they were doing the let’s-forget-everything-that-happened-between-us-and-start-anew, but he should’ve known Draco was more complicated than that. “Do you really mean that? Wanting me out of your life forever, I mean.”
"We're not learning waltz," Draco stated, apropos of nothing as if he was talking about the weather.
Behind the snow, when the castle was sleeping and it was only them two. It wasn't something that Harry'd envisioned of himself seven years before, having to run into the library to hide from his underclassmen because they were fans of the idea of him, the concept of the Chosen One. As if.
Harry snickered. His hand loomed over Draco's before retreating. "The problem is more your environment isn't it? If you had made that mistake, at least you wouldn't be brooding over it so much like now."
The stranger was quite handsome, somewhere around Draco's age. His raven hair fell in wild curls, rampaging and creating a nest of its own on his head. His old-fashioned glasses laid atop his nose, it didn't quite match him but he also looked like he'd rock anything just fine. He wore a black coat to hide himself from the autumn wind.
"Harry, you poor, clueless little thing," the blond chided with a smirk. "Unknowing of the tragedy about to be bestowed upon you."
, but Harry ignored that. “We watched Beauty and the Beast and he got so interested in dancing, he asked ‘Dromeda and got obsessed with the idea of waltz even though he’s never properly seen it.”
“I’m sorry. I don’t want to start over. You’ve always said that you couldn’t erase your past, so me erasing what made us become us, erasing the very reason I fell in love with you is ridiculous. I’d never forget how beautiful you looked, I’ll never forget how beautiful you are. Draco, I.” His speech was yet to be finished, but he felt like his heart was exposed out in the open. It wasn’t a good feeling, like defenselessly letting someone hold a wand to his head, wondering at which point he’d be AK’d. His Mind Healer had warned him about this, but nothing could help with the painful sensation of his heart racing in his chest. His feet were getting wobbly and it made him regret that he didn’t take up the offer for tea. “I don’t want to start over. I want us to move forward, I want to be with you. You know what I’m asking here, Draco, please. I’m talking like a fool.”
The second thing that Draco did was add some muggle tattoo to his Death Eater mark. He did not cover it, he decorated the symbol of racism with something from which its hatred came, creating an art with so much contrast and so much meaning. His history couldn't be erased just like that, he'd said, and he wouldn't erase it even if he had the chance. Everything would evolve.
wanted to be unseen) and the strange expressions (Harry really couldn't describe this. He was as clueless as they came) were quite the hints. He just had no idea what.
Every time Harry thought back to that moment, he could still hear the echo of Draco's voice offering him happiness and love and. And—
He closed his eyes. This all felt too surreal. Too late did he realize there were tears escaping his eyes.
Five years. Five years and still, being in Draco's arms felt like coming home. Or so Harry thought silently as they danced.
Draco learnt that his name was Harry in their little greeting, although he was surprised he'd wanted to talk to him at all.
Slytherins aren't as simple-minded as you lot, after all. I was wishing, hoping, that with this," he trailed off slowly, motioning to the perfume, "You would be interested in eating me,
The funny thing was, it was almost comical how he was overthinking such a small problem, but that's exactly what overthinking means, is it not? Other people out there struggled with drought, hunger, traumas, severe depression, and here Draco was mulling over some sleeping in class even though teenagers his age were doing drugs and parties out there. It made him feel small, like somebody was looming over his shoulder and whispering to him words such as, "Look at you, what an elitist, rich young boy. All you know is how to think of your own problems, so egoistic, so arrogant. They don't even matter and you look like you're about to cry over them. You don't matter, kid."
"I've heard it's your favorite food," Draco announced as if they hadn't been living together for the last two years, as if they hadn't spent a quarter of their dates in that treacle tart shop a few blocks down. "So, I thought, being a most thoughtful partner, I shall put it upon myself: a task, a
"Hm, I guess for your simple Gryffindor brain, it would seem that way, but no," Draco paused, letting out another grin. "It's as much for you as it is for me.
"Why'd anyone be scared of something as trivial as school? I don't even care about it, I just care about my grades."
Harry was a tool in war. He supposed he should've realized earlier, with the stalking and whatnot, that Draco was on the same kind of boat, but heading the opposite direction. They weren't anything special, just playing big roles in a war that adults couldn't care less to step their foot into.
Malfoy finally looked at the raven-haired man, crossing his arms in annoyance. "Lovegood is a pureblood, Longbottom can dance. Why exactly are you here, Potter? Think I'm up to something within these caging walls? For the love of Merlin, just state the truth."
He was desperate. It was simply a mystery he had to solve or else he'd die unsatisfied. And luckily, Draco was willing to explain, albeit with a flirty grin that Harry should've realized hid something behind.
Harry laughed. He was friendly, Draco thought, with his eyes crinkling like that. "I suppose. But if it's nothing big, why are you worried about it?"
"As much as most rich kids do, with their parents busy twenty-four seven, with barely any time to actually bond and care for each other more than what is required of them, I suppose."
"Honestly just needed to get away from my family. I've the opposite of yours; warm, overbearing," said Harry. "I just need to be alone sometimes."
Harry was in fact Draco's exact age, studying at Gryffindor which was only a few blocks away from his own school. They were rival schools and Harry said he played football for a team, but Draco wasn't interested in sports, never had been, so they moved on to merrier subjects.
, for hurting you because of my own problems. I liked you back then, and now I still- but anyways, I want to say- what I want to say is-”
When the war was over, the first thing that Draco did was dye his hair. He didn't get rid of the platinum blond, he loved his hair as he was undeniable and proudly vain. He simply added some soft highlights of pastel colors that made him look ethereal, more than he already was. He was a Malfoy, and if he decided to abandon the name that'd brought him thus far, regardless of at which point (very bad) he was in at the moment, he'd be even worse than a coward. He resolved to change, both himself and the very thing that'd been ingrained in his blood since birth, very literally.
The entrance they had come from banged open and he heard Patil and Henry shout for everyone not to move.
Harry drew his eyes away from the street and looked to where the Auror  was gesturing. A small, blue door stood proudly at the back of one of the cottages. Houses were overrun in the sea of crimson and supposed criminals inside.
She threw the rag that was stowed in her back pocket at his face. He caught it without thinking. “Hm. Nice catch. Sports heavy not science heavy at that school, eh?”
There was something inside Harry that still wanted to hold back when it came to interacting with Draco. He was unsure what is was but felt it all the same.
With a nod, Harry made his way down to the pub’s cellar. He was grateful that Draco had insisted earlier to light the place and label the new bottles on the shelves.
Harry paused, wondering if he should be honest. It couldn’t really hurt, even if he told him. Soon enough, Harry would leave and Draco would be forbidden to visit. There was nothing particularly secretive about his job, anyone with a brain could see that the Auror department only used him for clout, to ease the worries of its citizens.
Kingsley sighed and his remaining formalities dissolved almost instantly. “Harry – I know you are frustrated, I would be too, but you must understand that sometimes we just have to play things a certain way.”
The house had a more foreboding feeling to it as they approached. The path snaked up to the front door and all noises of the town were distant and indiscernible.
“Well, it’s really none of their business. But if they speak to anyone in this town about either of us, then they’re going to get an answer. I mean half of the folk here assumed I was your mysterious gay lover the first time they say us in the same room together.”
Malfoy, or Draco, tripped over something invisible and Harry put a hand on his arm to steady him. “Steady, now…Draco.” He leant heavy on the name this time, deliberately teasing.
The investigation was currently at a bit of an impasse. People thought he was some kind of English weirdo who had rocked up to their peaceful village and started asking questions about ‘weird things happening.’
“You’re still brilliant—the Goblet says so, at least. I’ll see you later, enjoy your breakfast!” A few Hufflepuffs give him a considering look as he passes.
“I’ll have you know that Granger is much too good for a scrawny git like him.” Harry looks to where Hermione came from and sees Fred leaning against a support pole, Ron at his elbow. Fred’s tone may light, but his glare is anything but. They both place a hand on one of Hermione’s shoulders, flanking her and menacing at Skeeter. “You’d better not be spreading more of your half-baked vitriol.”
Apparently, Malfoy’s ongoing odd behaviour does not prevent him showing himself up in Hagrid’s last lesson before the half term. Harry, Ron and Hermione snigger among themselves all the way back up to the castle, more for the mortified look on his face than anything else. In the Entrance Hall they found themselves milling at the edges of the large crowd of students gathered there, attention drawn to a large sign providing reception at the foot of the marble staircase. Ron grins at his friends and ruffles their hair in an unappreciated, condescending manner as he cranes his neck to read it.
The carriage, pale blue and gilded with gold trimming, bears a coat of arms boasting two crossed wands sending out a trio of stars each.
The Great Hall, much to their surprise, is empty when they file in. Hermione points out the four extra seats that Filch is maneuvering into the place settings at the head table, two of which are soon filled by Madame Maxime and Headmaster Karkaroff. Their students, however, are nowhere in sight. Harry picks up Avennia and plops her on his shoulder.
Fred and George thump him on the back, grinning and clutching their bookies’ trays, but it doesn’t help. Not even when Ginny tells them off for jeering and hugs him too.
Harry tries his best to take the weird casualness of the conversation in his stride. “Parvati took pity on me. You going with anyone?”
“You look rather dashing tonight. And here I was listening to Draco whine about your fashion choices?”
“You’re not allowed to die today,” he mutters with something that sounds like firm determination. Harry grips the back of Ron’s shirt even though his fingers feel icy and numb. Neville opens the window and props Harry’s Firebolt on the sill, ready to be summoned. A gust of air buffets them out of the door, so they head down to breakfast. It feels more like a funeral procession.
Harry stretches on his toes to see where Ron is looking. Sure enough, looking as surly and unimpressed as one could expect, is Viktor Krum.
The room extends at least ten more feet sideways in both directions, leaving the flimsy-looking window into the lake wisely undisturbed. Hermione and Ron in front of him are gazing around at the decorations, the green and silver and blue draped around the ceiling, chandeliers, tapestries and tables. Hundreds of people are already milling about chattering and laughing and throwing themselves and each other around to the very loud music. Harry can see Cho on his left laughing with Susan Bones, a group of Hufflepuff girls chatting to (up) a number of Durmstrang students on his right, and Blaise Zabini (in more head-to-toe black) heading straight for them.
Soon, once the castle is mostly out of sight, they turn into the forest. Harry sighs, knowing that they’ll have to hang back even farther with the brittle forest litter.
Madame Maxime holds up her wand and a silvery ribbon flies from the end. It curls and twists in the air, forming a shimmering seven.
“Shall we get closer?” Hagrid asks Madame Maxime. Harry and Malfoy follow once they find their legs and Harry drops his hand.
they yell, and send off synchronised stunners. The four giants hit the ground and the trees themselves groan. Each one is a small hill. Their handlers rush forward to secure the chains to the pegs they drive into the ground with their wands.
Malfoy twists his mouth so he looks like he’s chewing on something sour. “My disillusionment charms are shaky at best.”
He hears her start to spit her fire before he feels it, which may be the only reason he doesn’t cook. The air burns, and Harry remains empty-handed and his heart racing.
“It is a bit funny,” Harry agrees, and without noticing, the knots in his stomach subside just a little. Hermione sobers up instantly.
“Oh, you’ve never been interested in people’s affairs before,” she says lightly, smiling knowingly. “You took me by surprise.”
“Blimey, Harry,” he mutters as they reach an empty corridor on the way to the Gryffindor Tower, “I think she’s trying to say she thinks I’m
“The three tasks that our three champions will complete have been decided. Mr Crouch and Mr Bagman have already examined the instructions for each challenge and made the necessary arrangements. Throughout the year, our champions will be tested; by magical skill, problem solving, or ability to cope with danger, these tasks are designed to bring one to one’s very limits, and possibly beyond. It is not a challenge to take on lightly.
he become Draco?—because then he feels himself surrendering to that hot flush again, and now is really
“Why would I be in on this plot?” he asks, voice a few pitches too high. “Sounds like something I wouldn’t do. What’s the plot?”
“It’s all right, I haven’t done anything to them,” he says. “It’s the custard creams you have to watch—” Neville, having just shoved one of the biscuits into his mouth whole, chokes and tries to spit it out. “Don’t worry! I’m joking!”
“Harry would really appreciate it, he needs all the help he can get,” Hermione says. Harry raises his eyebrows at her. She wrinkles her nose. “No offence.”
Dinner is… Well, dinner is almost torturous. He’s lucky Percy peters off when Parvati pointedly starts conversation with Harry over him, because he’s sure he’d be listening to all of the most boring goings on in the Ministry by now. Of course, she’s almost certainly aware that half of what she’s saying is going right over Harry’s head—he really is trying to listen, promise—because he keeps catching snippets of conversation from down the table.
he says, and thinks pointedly of the weight of it in his hand a moment earlier. The book falls off the desk.
“Oh no,” Harry mutters, spotting red curls approaching from the sidelines. “Percy’s coming. What was that about dancing?”
The only topic of conversation for the next week is about the upcoming Tournament and their subsequent visitors. Everywhere Harry goes, rumours fly about supposed champions, the Tournament, and what the other students might be like.
Harry holds his hands up in surrender. “I was just going to offer to take you to Madam Pomfrey if you were.”
Once every last straggler has settled themselves in the hall, McGonagall wrangles the champions into a line and has them follow her into the hall. The floor looks like an ice rink without the danger—glazed snow white with hints of a cold, sharp blue, though it still feels like solid stone underfoot. Parvati hangs off Harry’s arm and appears to enjoy herself immensely, and Harry feels a sudden companionship with the horses that Uncle Vernon always watches be paraded around at Epsom Derby. The eight of them are met with thundering applause from everyone at the new, round, lantern-lit tables. Padma waves exuberantly to her sister as they go by, headed up to a large round table at the top of the hall. The judges are already seated there, though Harry realises on closer approach that instead of Barty Crouch, Percy Weasley is sitting in the fifth seat along.
“It’s about the Tournament!” he says. “The… Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are arriving on Sunday, and we’re going to meet them before the feast!”
Everywhere he goes there will be whispers. He’s resigned to it, but it takes a few moments to remember why his chest feels so heavy when he wakes the next morning. It’ll be whispers or applause from his housemates. Both as bad as each other.
Several other faces slip in and out of mind (Bill, the twins, Abbott, Goldstein, Greengrass) until, unbidden, a memory from last year resurfaces in vibrant defiance.
Angelina nods and assesses Ron’s predicament, studiously ignorant of his rising blush as she does so. She runs her wand over his dress shirt and seems to persuade it to absorb all of the frills. It’s quite impressive.
It seems that Draco doesn’t quite have a response for that. Instead he swipes a fresh glass from the nearest table and gulps from it, seemingly unaware of the droplet making its way down the column of his throat that Harry just can’t tear his eyes away from.
“It’s a litter of kneazle kittens!” she grins, holding the box up for him to see. “They’re our Creatures project from Hagrid. Would you like to say hello? My books say two months is the most important time for them to be socialised.”
“Harry!” Cedric greets. He’s sitting on the same bed as before. Pomfrey is still applying something to his back, but the curtain is open. “Sounded like you made quite a fuss!”
Harry drags him away. They stumble over roots and stones, out of the forest and up to the castle. Malfoy is a half dead weight the entire way, hanging from Harry’s arm.
His throat is sticky and suffocated and his stomach refuses to stop churning. He can barely face more than one bite of breakfast, let alone the plate Hermione is gently encouraging him to finish.
An owl that morning from Kingsley’s assistant had asked him for updates and he attempted to big up what he had discovered already. Yes, he had heard weird things going on, no he didn’t have the source yet and would keep him updated with new information.
Draco paused only slightly, before removing his wand and locking the door with a thud. People were anxious now. Pressing in around them, he could feel the heat of the crowd at his back. The brief training he had received as an Auror allowed him to keep focused on the man in front of him.
The conversation continued and Harry tried his best not to scream at Smith for putting Draco in this position, with this sleazy bastard talking to him and no doubt touching him. Skin crawling he attempted to formulate the easiest way to get Draco out of that bloody house and away from this creep.
As soon as he woke in the mornings he would jump up and leave the tent as soon as he could, relief flooding him when he got outside and knew he was not in the Forest of Dean or some other godforsaken place on the run from Voldemort. It was as if the tent had soaked up his fears from that year and was only now gradually releasing them, the memories lapping at his feet as he paced around the small space.
Grimmauld place greeted him like toothache: familiar and dreaded at the same time. It seemed to be the physical embodiment of Harry’s feelings: sad, lonely but orderly.
“I told you, my boarding school was in Scotland. I understand what you’re saying, but it’s easy for one to get confused when you begin babbling nonsense about rockets and whatnot.” He threw his arms in the air at this and small spray of juice went flying onto the bar.
“No. Quite alright. Anyway, I should probably head over there now. I’ve got my wand just in case. He asked for me to come alone.”
“That too. Mostly that I haven’t heard you use any slurs and you’re doing everything the muggle way; I thought that would be beneath you.”
“Hey, hey, hey ,it’s alright. It’s me.” He held his hands out. The man in front of him looked like an animal caught in a trap. One that, if pushed to it, would gnaw its way out if necessary. “Just a dream.”
Harry smirked and turned his attention towards the players. Being unfamiliar with all of the rules for rugby he couldn’t quite follow the game particularly well but their agility was incredible.
The other man seemed to choose his words carefully now. “Well I have certain interests, you see. Places I want my business to go and it’s rather irritating to be hindered by…laws and regulations in our world. So, needs must.”
“Shit, shit, shit.” Harry fumbled in his attempt to open the letter and right about this moment would take an Avada to the head if it meant he could skip this next part of his life.
Long and winding hallways and a rickety set of steps leading to some type of basement, found them in a store room filled with rows upon rows of bottles.
Draco rolled his eyes and fixed the set of his shoulders before marching on declaring that he had to see one of this suppliers and that Harry’s tour could wait.
Draco spent the majority of the morning testing various alcohols in his cellar for traces of potion ingredients and Harry quizzed him on anything suspicious Draco had experience while living there.
The following day began uneventful. He tried his best to simply blend in and go unnoticed. Mostly he listened to inane conversations that would bore him senseless if he were not on the job. Occasionally he was privy to village gossip which was mildly amusing, and Harry had to hide smirk as he listened to a younger couple moan about their neighbours, the owners of the shop he was in, having loud sex in the flat above them only to smile and wave as they came to the till.
“I think that sounds like the first step of talking and thinking about it. But, I’ve been there. You figure it out eventually.”
“Don’t be thick. Of course I don’t want you to go, we both know that I’m selfish. I want you around but I shouldn’t get to. I shouldn’t be allowed to.”
With a final shove at his chest, Potter finally let him go. “You’ve got a minute to explain yourself, Malfoy or I’m bringing you in.”
Harry could tell that Fotheringham was going on one of his, now notorious, rants that would provide them with little to no information other than the guy was a total bastard. And that intel had already been gathered.
“Yes, or could you not tell I was talking to an idiot?” Draco spat. Harry’s instinct was to flinch but quickly reminded himself that Draco didn’t talk to him that way anymore.
“Pretend that everyone in that room believes I am entirely innocent. And I don’t blame them, it’s not like I haven’t fucking poisoned someone before. Christ!”
Bewildered, Harry looked around, trying to see the next threat and then he looked to Draco. Everything in him seemed to stutter and halt altogether. He heard nothing but the buzzing of his blood in his ears and his breaths, rough and staggered.
“Yes, not sure why honestly.” When he saw the look on Harry’s face he added, “Oh, don’t look like that. Perhaps he just doesn’t like you, Potter.” He winked mischievously.
“Hi – can I get two shots of Firewhiskey, three small Pissing Poltergeists, a Grey Lady and a…” She scrutinised the board with the drinks list, “…a Flirty Flitwick.”
He began marching back to the tent to take notes on what he had heard and formulate his next move. A feeling began to burn in his stomach, one he hadn’t felt in a long time. It was the feeling he got when he was close. Close to figuring something out and getting somewhere finally. Like when his hand was outstretched for the snitch, or when he they knew what the next horcrux would be. It filled him with a power that had been lying formant dormant for so long he had forgotten it had existed, that he could indeed feel like this. Like himself.
Even in the dark the scars were clear to see. He didn’t want to upset Draco, to spoil everything, but he didn’t know how he could just move on after seeing this, as if the lines weren’t there and instead was a smooth chest, unmarred by a moment of hatred and fear.
Draco seemed to be talking very loudly at this point, something animated about one of the products. He called Harry’s name.
“I’ve been in the hospital wing so often I could recognise it even in such a small dose,” Harry laughed.
He hadn’t tried dating any men. He didn’t even know anyone else who was like him so even attempting that was a daunting enough prospect to put him off.
Draco could now be heard shouting at the mirror and Harry chuckled to himself as he fetched the mugs.
“What did you mean earlier?” The question seemed to bounce around the room and Draco was thrown by it.
Draco stood now and shook Fotheringham’s hand, a polite smile adorning his face. “If I were, say, in need of brewing something…you wouldn’t know of an ideal place to do this would you?”
“No.” He could sense a trap and wouldn’t fall of it again. “No, I told you I want out. I’m not doing photo opportunities or – “
With a huff he collapsed on his bed and stared at the ceiling. There was some odd damp spots in the corners and some of the paint was peeling. Long fingers drummed on his stomach as he thought of Potter in that bloody forest in a tent. He was probably too pig-headed to even put up wards, relying instead on good old Gryffindor bravery.
“True, but I think that it’s possible you represent hope for him. I mean, you’ve both hurt each other and saved each other. I don’t mean to upset you, Harry but he has seen a side of you that others haven’t. And maybe that’s enough.”
Two elderly gentlemen toddled in, donning thick coats and tartan scarves. One had a cigarette behind his ear.
“I never apologised to you, Potter. You know for…everything.” Words were directed to the ceiling as he held his pint between hands on his chest. “I didn’t realise how much it would spiral out of control. How I would spiral out of control. And how much everyone would pay for it.” He sat up, legs dangling over the bar. “I haven’t apologised to anyone else because –“ He gestured to the room around him. “- banishment. Not really something one can just put in a letter.”
“Bernard, what’s your favourite drink here?” Draco asked with a smile he reserved only for the stupid.
Heaving it from under the bed, which was harder than it looked, he took out the cloak and began to roll it up. His clothes were everywhere in the room. Draco, while being fairly particular about mess in every other room of the house was fairly lax in here. A towel hung over the door, laundry was unfolded and sitting on a wooden chair at the desk. Mixed in with Draco’s belongings however was Harry’s stuff. A book he had been reading on the bedside table, boots in the corner of the room, a stray shirt lying on the bed next to Draco’s pyjamas. It looked as if he had been here for a long time. As if he belonged here.
Ron walked into the room like some kind of guardian angel. “Ron! Thank fuck you’re here. That total wanker has sent Draco in with –“
He was lucky. In more ways than one. If the restrictions placed upon him had been any kinder it would have been cruel. He would have been forced to grovel and beg instead of being banished and forced to start anew. For this is what his punishment was: banishment. A large sign that said, ‘you failed here, try again somewhere else.’ But this was what pushed him. That, even when muggles stared at him strangely when he got confused about toasters or terrified of their little gas lighters they held too close to their faces to smoke…he was granted the opportunity to try again. When he was feeling selfish it didn’t feel like enough. On good days, it felt like a gift and one he most definitely didn’t deserve.
It took a moment for Harry to unfreeze himself, eventually giving the receiver and device to Henry. “Smith – what trackers do you have on him? Hopefully where he’s been Apparated to isn’t too heavily warded.” Harry looked at him expectantly.
Harry raised his hand to wave, mouth hanging open. The spotty teenager behind the till cleared her throat impatiently and drummed her long fingernails on the counter.
He was confused. His brain was trying to reconcile the fact that this was Malfoy. And Malfoy was beautiful.
“Draco is not a Death Eater any longer and his sentence has been served, Robards,” Harry said coldly.
She held him, head to her chest and rubbed his back in the middle of the waiting room. He cried for a long time, long enough that a healer came and offered Hermione a calming draught to give to him. She held out the hand that was rubbing smoothing circles in his back and clutched it.
He backed away from the mirror and over to the toilet. How did Malfoy live with this thing? From the sink, the mirror was listing all the ways his face was wrong and how if he just listened to her (it?) then all his worldly problems would be solved.
That was he found himself, half an hour, later traipsing through the dark trails of the forest looking for the daft git. His imagination had supplied him with images of Potter being attacked by werewolves, vampires, and at one point a massive tic that had sent him scrambling for his shoes and out the door to look for him.
Being here, spontaneously, had sparked something within Harry. Something that had been dormant for far too long. It felt good to have it back.
Harry smiled. “It was Draco really. He was the one who questioned him and got the information we needed.”
“I’m taking the cloak. I’ll be with you but he won’t see me.” Harry said this with finality and went to fetch it from his bag.
Fotheringham was the only muggle who was relatively painless to write to. Many would misinterpret his message as they struggled with his handwriting, which was excellent and one thing he could be proud of, or others would think he was pretentious by how he wrote. Not Fotheringham, however, who once commented that he enjoyed Draco’s letters as he had used ‘exceptional grammar and vocabulary so lacking by the youth in this place!’ Draco had tried not to take the compliment too seriously. Many in the village saw the man as a bit of a nutter, an eccentric. But Draco found him rather amusing and writing his list of obscure mixers was not chore at all.
How Potter had managed to stay here for however long was beyond Draco, then again Potter was definitely made of stronger stuff.
Harry looked around and pulled out his wand. The alley was dark, the sides of a warehouse towering over them oppressively. The smell of hot garbage permeated the air and almost caused him to gag. The ground was damp and the puddles reflected the dull sky blanketed in the city smog.
Throwing on a fresh t-shirt and his usual jeans he quickly stepped in front of the mirror to double check he didn’t look too hungover. He did, but there was really nothing he could do about it and, with a sigh and mounting dread, stuffed his feet in his boots and left the house for the Ministry.
“- or their alibi said they were at the pool but you knew for a fact that they had only gotten a perm the day before and therefore could not possibly even conceive the idea that they would be in the pool-“
A shaky breath left him and he cursed himself for getting caught up here and leaving Draco for so long. He had told him he would be quick.
“Yes, but he might recognise you, Draco.” Harry wasn’t sure how to properly word what he was going to say next but pressed on nevertheless. “I know you don’t get the Prophet here but you still feature in it from time to time. And your parents. Well, your father mostly but it wouldn’t be entirely out of the question for someone to know who you are.” Harry looked up at him sheepishly, concerned that he had just imploded the tentative friendship they had built over the past few days.
“I get it, Harry. I really do. But I don’t think just leaving is the best idea either. You are valued as an Auror but more so as public figure, always doing the right thing.”
Harry made sure to stay under the cloak as they made their way back to the apartment. He could tell Draco was trying to keep himself restrained but the excitement was evident in his face.
“So, what are we doing today?” Harry said it as a way to clear the air and Draco was grateful for it.
The rest of his day was spent walking down the country paths and remarking on the weather to some of the locals. They were cautious at first, they didn’t know him, and he clearly wasn’t from around here. But eventually they eased into the conversation and began recommending various cafes to visit and tourist points to see.
Currently, Draco was lying on the floor, legs splayed and arm thrown over his face. Harry was sat cross legged on the fluffy rug, back against one of the soft arm chairs. His eyes were trained on the small stretch of pale skin of Draco’s stomach as he stretched languidly.
Fotheringham answered almost right away. He was dressed in the most ridiculous set of pyjamas Harry had seen. Silky and royal blue with garden gnomes dotted around the soft material. On top was a dressing gown complete with fur lined cuffs and collar. A drink was held loosely between his fingers and his eyes were glinting.
Draco looked at him, confusion written clear as day on his face. “Um…I’m not sure actually. I don’t believe they specified.”
Harry had never been called beautiful before. Perhaps his parents had, maybe even Sirius, but somehow it was enough that Draco had said it. Harry closed his eyes briefly at the thought and then continued removing Draco’s shirt.
“Ha, you’re saying that now and then you start on the Finnegan Fireballs, and you don’t know your own name anymore.”
Harry had barely listened and instead had darted around the room packing the tent with a frantic energy that made Hermione frown.
It was dead silent in the room. Harry felt the familiar wave of humiliation at again being asked to stay away from the fray. It particularly stung coming from Kingsley, however. He thought of Draco, who had basically outted himself to this nutter and spouted a bunch of shite about muggles under the pretence of getting the guy to trust him. Draco, who had barely spent any time with anyone magical in two years and who had immediately refused to defend himself when faced with Smith. The thought of him being vulnerable and alone while random Aurors come near him made something vile bubble in Harry’s stomach.
Some total wanker was giving drinks to muggles and naming them after wizarding things. Who the fuck would do that? Who would be so stupid, so reckless and to what motivation? Ridiculous was the least sinister thing it could be for he didn’t know what was in these drinks and who was giving them out.
“No, no, no…don’t…please don’t be embarrassed, it’s honestly okay. I mean, if anything, I’m the one that should be…” Harry trailed off.
The Auror beckoned him in and he followed, reminding himself to breathe. The room was stifling and packed to the brim with bodies. Robards was in the middle of a speech.
“Robards, that’s enough. Take the vials and have them analysed. We are professionals.” Kingsley’s voice was firm and unmoving. Robards paused as if he were going to disobey but then nodded stiffly and stood, leaving the room with a thudding of the door.
Harry got the feeling it hadn’t been dreams Draco had seen, but memories. Things that had haunted him enough to wake him in the middle of the night with the overwhelming need to flee from his own skin. His mind pushed an image of Draco waking in the night with no-one to talk him down. Just the silence of the empty room to tell him it was all over. Harry pushed the thought away.
“Firstly,” he began in a lecturing tone, “we get some Absinthe.” He smirks at Harry, “Because it’s fucking deadly. Next, we add a little tequila – you can never go wrong with tequila –“ Harry belly laughs at that. “And…” He long pours the tequila into the glass after the absinthe. “…some syrup, because to the right person it has the potential to be a little sweet.” Draco cleared his throat but his smile remained. “Some vodka for the madness. And some green syrup…” He winked a little and poured in what looked to be some kind of handmade looking syrup. As he poured it the man awaiting the drink clapped. The liquid had went from see-through, swirling quickly until it stopped suddenly, still and was a vibrant -  “Green. Green eyes.” Draco looked away from him and bowed slightly to the man who was still clapping. “And that, gentlemen, is the Harry Potter special.”
An angry Scottish voice barked something at him. With eyes away from the scene to his right he was able to concentrate clearly.
Fotheringham led the way with Draco and Harry following along behind him. A wave of his hand sent the door opening and they both said their goodbyes.
Sensing victory, Draco began to slowly walk back towards town. Potter was grumbling behind him and could be heard stuffing his feet into shoes and readjusting the wards.
“I mean, between you and I, he was a madman that one, but he was on to something. I mean, this notion of half-bloods and muggleborns breeding with pure-bloods…obscene. Think about it: your ancestry, you lineage, a pure-blood man like yourself – can you imagine marrying a muggleborn witch?”
“Just a little bit mad, I suppose. It’s weird that he didn’t think it best for you to come in too, don’t you think? I mean you’re the one that lives here and knows that place much better than I do. What’s the point in me telling them that when you can more accurately?” Draco’s amusement fell and he looked away. “I knew you wouldn’t want to come in so I didn’t push it, so…”
“Harry – the girls were talking about this new cream.” He held it carefully between long, pale fingers.
“Sir.” Harry nodded to Kingsley and with the briefest of glances at the other man, “Robards.” Robards clenched his fist, keenly aware of Harry’s subtle disrespect in front of his boss.
Harry’s stomach took a dive but he refused to flinch or look away from Robards. He held his mouth tight, eyes narrowed.
Long hair scraped back on his head and face framed by a dark beard the man held Draco’s gaze, eyes green and intense and fucking majestical.
“I know,” he smiled, “I’m rather looking forward to it.” He moved closer and kissed Draco’s neck and then along his jaw.
This train of thought always left him quite uncomfortable so of course his brain reminded him of it regularly. It had been a long time since he had sex with someone. The last time being a random muggle woman in a pub that was over very quickly leaving both parties rather unsatisfied but in entirely different ways.
“A muggle has died. In the town. Poisoning again.” He pinched the bridge of his nose and looked older than Harry had ever seen or ever imagined he could be. “Smith is, well, he’s an utter twat. He’s –“ Harry held his breath. He knew what was coming, could feel it inside him, confirming his fears. “He sent Malfoy in to talk to him, for some unknown fucking reason. I don’t know why he thought it was an idea to send in a fucking civilian, stupid prick.”
There were three of them left still here. The rest of the group currently with Draco and the rest of the town. Harry was pleased to see Ron there for his own sake but that meant that Draco was left with Smith. Ron looked up and smiled at him, his usual mop of red hair in a disarray that could almost rival Harry’s. Almost. He waved and let himself into the room.
Grabbing everything he might need, purpose renewed, he took off at a brisk walk back into town he considered his options.
When she had finished dabbing her eyes and had caught her breath again he looked at her seriously. “You’re not angry at me? I mean, he was an insufferable little wanker at school and then was an actual wanker the longer time went on…I know he hurt you. And Ron. I just…” He trailed off, not sure exactly where this though process was going.
“I’ll need the light brighter than that if you expect me to cook,” he warned the house. It was capricious and treated him more like a poor house mate that paid less rent and left the milk out.
“You are much too thin, Draco. Now, tell me about your visitor that you’ve got there – the one with the nice arse.”
She studied him a moment, clearly pondering his question. “Hmm, guess not. Can’t take any chances though. I don’t know anything about Skele-gro as I’m not of age yet.”
“You really shouldn’t be so glum, you know.” Her smile was overly bright, with too many teeth and not enough sincerity. “Many would kill for an easy position – danger free!” Her small hands wiggled in the air as she said this to add the cup of already overflowing humiliation.
Thirty minutes later, he was sat at a small round table in the back of an almost empty pub. It was dead inside. A few couples and some older men occupied the bar and chatted mildly. All drinking…normal drinks. Lager, whisky and if they were really pushing it wine. And the worst of it? Every person ordering called the normal drinks by their normal name.
She curled her lip in disapproval and got to work shovelling the chips and shouting at the other kid who was cleaning the counters. Harry paid and left a small tip, ministry money be damned, and then headed out the shop to see if the woman was still kicking about.
Harry had used Draco’s floo to speak to Kingsley. He was surprised when Draco had suggested it as he seemed to keep almost everything from his previous life tucked away and out of sight bar the few things he kept in his bedroom.
He took on acclimatising to his new world the same way he did with everything else he was unsure of at first: he studied.
Draco sat up slowly and looked at him with sincerely. “Potter…did you…did you just give me…a…compliment.”
Thanks again for reading everyone! If you feel like it, leave some kudos or a comment - it keeps me going!
Bernard seemed bored of the conversation by this point and swallowed the rest of his Nipple shot. The smaller glasses were harder to configure so it was more of a tumbler full of Nipple. Draco toyed with the idea of calling the drink a Drippy Tit but didn’t want to appear entirely uncouth; just enough to be interesting and not disgrace his mother.
