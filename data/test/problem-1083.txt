“If I can’t even start it yet, then why are we doing this?” Harry asked, as he watched his father and dogfather in front of him.
“Extraordinary,” Theo said. “Second year we were being attacked by a monster. It took Draco. And third year, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban, and the Ministry
While his mother kept her promise about letting Harry have a free day every week. It was decided that Mondays would be it, though it didn’t really matter. The day after the hearing, they had started going through Animagus training. The first step was the mandrake leaf, which they couldn’t actually start for another week.
His father nodded slowly. “Yes… It’s understandable. You’ll have to be careful with them, Harrison. I think you can trust Zabini, at least for now, but we can’t know for certain what side the others will be on.” Turning to the rest of the table, his father looked at the others. “Is there any other news that needs to be shared?”
XxXXxX
Daphne Greengrass raised her own hand. “Daphne Greengrass. Miss, I think what Blaise was trying to ask was if we’re going to be attacked, it won’t be in a risk free-”

When the drawer finally opened, Harry barely caught himself before he tumbled in. The drawer, much to Harry’s destain, was empty, save for one pitch black quill in a clear case. He scowled at the quill, wondering just what it was. It couldn’t be a spare, as he had just knocked the decorative cup that held Umbridge’s quills. Besides, why would a spare quill need a case of its own?
“I know that isn’t true,” Harry snapped, turning his eyes to Hermione. “Well? What is it?”
“I’m sure,” Harry said, trying to keep his voice steady.
“She will be back.” He was keeping his voice carefully calm, or as calm as he could manage. “There is no need to worry.”
And that night, at the Yule Ball, Harry couldn’t think about it without smiling. It had been a good night, filled with dancing and laughter. They had all been able to let go, mingle together to be friends. There had been no house barriers that night… And he hoped that, maybe, that could continue.
Umbridge’s face went bright red, unable to keep up her charde. “Well, those are isolated instances, and the fault of your previous teachers. The chances of you being attacked here are-”
“Mum said you were gonna tell me the truth. So, like, you can use magic, and make stuff happen? You got a magic wand?”
And just like that, Umbridge began to turn to leave. But Harry… Harry had seen this woman verbally berate two of his beloved teachers, and now a teacher who stood no chance against her bullying. He hated bullies, he hated how they treated those they saw as beneath them. And Harry wasn’t going to just sit back and watch this bully walk away.
“It often skips a few generations.”
She hummed, as if she had to think on that. “Honestly, it will depend entirely on your class and what you remember from your previous lessons. Should you be lacking in an area, we may not be able to move on before I have to leave. But I will endeavour to ensure you are all properly prepared for your OWL’s this spring.”
“Don’t think she did,” Greg said, sounding as confused as always.
All of them took their seats, finding small boxes on their tables, each holding a pair of snails. Most of the Slytherin’s didn’t bother touching them just yet, which was expected, as even they had to much respect for McGonagall to try starting without her. They didn’t have to wait long, as McGonagall marched in, exactly one minute before class was to start. Harry found a deep, deep pleasure in the fact that she ignored Umbridge's presence entirely.
Before Sirius could drag him off for whatever his first lesson of the summer was to be, Harry went to his mother. She looked just as tired as she had when Harry had left at the beginning of the school year. When she saw him approach her, she forced a bit of a smile. Harry tried to return it.
Kingsley gave a confused face. “I’m also your friend, Harry.”
“Harry, you’ve been holed up there since St Mungo’s. Come out with us for lunch, mate. We do miss you.” Ron’s voice fell flat on Harry’s ears.
That made Harry drop one of his cards. He looked up at Teddy, who was looking at him with an intensity a child shouldn’t have.
She passed the law for same sex wizard marriages, and created gateways for squibs to be introduced into the magical world, and for wizards to learn about the muggle. Harry was amazed at how much she’d completed in the 5 years. But at the same time, it was Hermione, filled with determination and courage.
came to mind, and it brought a coy smile to his lips as he was met with Draco’s fly’s.
“Oh, Draco dear, I do hope you’ve been watching after our Harry this summer.” She reached out to him, throwing Draco completely off balance as she pulled him into her warmth for a snug hug.  Then pulled back, still holding him at arm’s length; giving him the same assessment she’d given Harry only moments ago. Although, this time he felt that despite her warm demeanor she was assessing him for proof that he had in fact looked after Harry that summer.
“Draco can spare you a few moments Harry, come on mate.”
“Look,” Harry said so softly it instantly pulled Draco’s eyes to his, a thorough tactic.
Hello everyone,
**Smut warning** If it's not your thing that's totally fine, but it comes right at the beginning of this chapter! Feel free to skip to Draco's POV to avoid! :)
Before he really knew what was happening Harry was inviting Malfoy to sit with him, and Hermione and Ron at meals. And before he could even stop himself to think about how stupid it was to invite him, Malfoy accepted. Harry was beginning to realize that maybe he wasn’t the only one addicted to their conversations and their time together. Maybe Malfoy was just as amiable as Harry was to this newfound friendship.
Harry doesn’t know why he should feel nervous at the prospect of knocking on Malfoy’s door, it’s only just that, well, they’d never really ventured into one another’s rooms before. It felt like uncharted territory, that once charted would ultimately change everything between them. For this reason, Harry hesitated as he stood in front of the other boy’s door for a moment. Harry sucked in a breath;
If Harry was being perfectly honest with himself the whole thing scared him shitless. He didn’t want to admit what this might mean about him, to himself. He didn’t want to face it, he just wanted to live it. He was being selfish, and he knew he was being selfish; he wanted to live in the moment with Draco because it felt right, it felt amazing, but he didn’t want to be honest with himself about any of it.
Harry rolled to his side and reached for Draco and he felt himself submit to the touch immediately.
Draco resolved to continue on with the vow of suffering in silence as it seemed to be working for him thus far. Although, he found he had to continuously remind himself that there wouldn’t really be any true suffering on his part, at least not until either the summer or the bond came to an end, whichever came first. Draco let out another shaky sigh and tried to ground himself back in reality and out of his mind again. It dawned on him how loud his thoughts were, they seemed to have completely drowned out the silence that filled the hospital wing. The silence felt strange as it seemed as though from the moment, he woke up the room had been filled with hushed whispers, and even at some point Potter’s loud frustration. Draco knew he wasn’t alone, couldn’t be alone because he wasn’t in any sort of pain, meaning Potter couldn’t be far. However, the silence indicated that maybe Granger and Weasley had finally left Potter’s side and perhaps the two boys were alone.
Harry realised with a swell in his heart that Malfoy told them all not to overwhelm him.
“Harry,” Kingsley started after a few moments of peaceful silence. “I’m assigning you to the case investigative group.”
Harry blinked at Kingsley, taking in his words for processing.
“Harry, why don’t yer show us how to approach a hippogriff?”
Harry shifted to the side a little more as the girl started putting her notes down on the grass to look at. She pointed to an incredibly detailed insect drawing.
“No no, I’m okay. A drink would be good.”
“-Your call, I can’t make that decision, sir.” Ron’s voice carried through the closed door.
Draco froze for a second before looking at Harry again with a mix of amazement and confusion. “How did you know what I was going to ask?”
“You’re Harry, and that’s all you need to be. No matter what, memories or not.”
“Harry. You didn’t pretend while you were at the Burrow, what happened between then and now?” Blaise asked.
“And so he got more food,” Ginny plowed through. “And then the dessert table was open!”
They stayed in the cafeteria for a bit longer. Peak lunch hour was over, and the cafeteria was barren. He’d missed the chance to see Ron again, but didn’t mind too much. His best friend was always within reach.
Out of all the things, he didn’t think he’d get another owl. Not after Hedwig.
He’s wanted to ask her this before. It’s Hermione. She’s always had an answer for everything, and if she didn’t, she’d spend all her efforts looking for one. Ever since he met her, she seemed to hold all knowledge.
Harry put down the rest of his cards, pausing the game. “That is what happened. I was at work, and I got hit by a lot of bad spells. So now I just have to remember.”
Teddy masked in his victory by quickly changing his colours as if it were a fountain filled with colours. Pinks to purples, blues to yellows, it was glorious. Added with a lovely fist to the sky.
“For not asking about your mother sooner. I’ve asked everyone about their life in the past 5 years except you. So I am sorry for doing that, and I’m ready to listen if you’d like to tell me?”
Harry’s heart ached even more, and this time he knew it was on his face.
at your disposal.”
Harry blinked and tilted his head, then a half smile pulled at his lips. “Okay… I’ve wanted to move out for a while.” Then a thought popped into his head. “But… That’s not all, is it?”
Harry stood outside for a moment, heart racing. The plan had worked. It
“Chicken liver schnitzel.”
It was a shot in the dark, sure, but at least he saw the room before the lights turned off. That wedding had to have a lot of dancing, and Harry knew the two were there because Blaise said that comment during the Burrow. Another point was that he guessed that they learnt to dance, just as Malfoy had.
Draco sat up slowly, reaching for the brunette and pulling him close, he nuzzled in and began mouthing slowly at Harry’s neck making his eyes flutter closed.
Draco could feel Potter’s eyes on him, but he was too embarrassed with himself to meet the other boy’s eyes for more than a moment. He heard Potter clear his throat before speaking, “You know Malfoy, it was a shit year. And I guess I don’t really care what’s made you less of a prick so long as you are less of a prick.” It felt as if Potter knew he shouldn’t question what he had meant by ‘seen and done so many awful things,’ and Draco felt grateful as he watched the corner of Potter’s lips lift, and Draco couldn’t help but mirror him. “I’m tired of being angry,” Potter said after a moment of silence and half-smiles.
Draco didn’t know how to feel now that everyone knew about, he and Harry. For starters, what did they even know? Neither boy had ventured further in the realms of discussing what life at Hogwarts would look like for them. Were they telling anyone beyond the Weasley’s, and if so, what were the qualifications for letting someone in on the secret? Draco felt keen to lose himself in all the ‘what-ifs’ swirling around in a mumbled mess in his mind. It seemed silly after their summer to be caught up on the technicalities of their relationship. They were in love and they’d confessed as much to one another, and Draco felt like it was enough. However, the feeling of what they shared being enough wasn’t quite
Love all your comments so much! <3
He could feel emerald eyes on him, but kept his eyes closed firmly not wanting the other boy to know he was awake, not ready to face him yet. Draco waited until he heard the soft click of the door closing before allowing himself to fully open his eyes and blink out the very little sleep, he’d gotten that night.
“Yeah, I have to be honest I’ve never been much of a reader,” Draco gains a little bit of his arrogance back “Oh what a revelation Potter, tell me something none of us knew already,” but he says it without malice and a half smirk on his lips.
They laid there in complete silence, Draco was unsure how long they stayed curled around each other, but it was long enough for Draco to zone out, lost in thought.
Harry answered with a kiss to Draco’s cheek, then his eye lids, and nose, and chin, and finally a long and sweet kiss to his lips.
Draco immediately let go, and let himself get lost in Harry, and making the other boy feel good. In one swift motion he pulled off the other boy’s pajama bottoms and pants leaving him bare, and was met with Harry’s rigidly hard cock, already dripping pre-come.
Harry immediately thought to himself. He had to full on remind himself to continue walking, but not wanting to do anything to pull Malfoy from the escape he was clearly absorbed in.
In three strides Draco was at his door, pulling it open, “what Potter, couldn’t stand to be away from me for a whole day?” he said with a soft half smile, knowing it was as true for him as it was for the other boy.
Harry couldn’t help but match Draco’s grin at that, “Which one?”
Dumbledore looked at him with his signature knowing gaze, “I think it’s best that Severus give us a recount of events, as he was there when it happened, Severus…” the headmaster turned his traditional gaze on the potions master who seemed at a loss for words, a look that seemed foreign on the stern and self-assured professor Harry had grown accustomed to. At the growing silence Harry cleared his throat and looked to his two best friends for some much-needed answers. Hermione began to chew her bottom lip with growing anxiety, and it seemed Ron were interested in looking anywhere but at Harry seeming more keen to pretend he hadn’t been invited into the conversation. Harry sighed in exasperation, “Can someone just tell me what’s going on!” Hermione gave a slight flinch, no doubt more used to Harry’s outbursts over the last year, “Harry,” she sighed as if unsure how to carry on. After a moment more of hesitation she continued, “something’s happened” she paused again. “Well obviously, I’m not that dense Hermione, just tell me what it is! It can’t be worse than anything else that’s happened this year” Harry said with a final huff.
“It’s okay.”
They both nodded, and the conversation began.
There was silence over the table. The sounds of the restaurant’s livelihood still bouncing off the walls, the bells still rang, and orders were still given, but Harry felt like everything was buffering in this silence.
Harry just gave a half hearted smile, and decided to put those words, his own words, in the ‘for later’ pile. He’d analyse his own words later, for now, it was about someone else.
The next time he woke up, the pain was just a low thrum under his skin. He willed his eyes to open, and they did, but slowly. The bright walls of St Mungo’s greeted him with a smile. The ceiling was as dull and as disinterested as ever.
All of Harry’s life, he’s been asked this question. For some reason, this particular time irritated him just that little bit more.
Harry heard voices from the living room, and then the swooshes of the floo. Suddenly remembering the food, he cast a wandless stasis charm on it.
Harry looked up at Malfoy. Malfoy’s tone of voice was so questioning it was almost authoritative. It threw Harry off.
For a second, they looked unsure, but then relented.
“Yeah. I know.” Harry smiled.
For the first time her smile didn’t quite seem real.
Harry could just pretend to be the Harry from before. He didn’t need to feel jealous or insecure anymore, he could just keep it up like he never lost them. What’s that saying, ‘fake it ‘til you make it,’ right? So that’s what he’ll do. He won’t waste over the books and the newspapers anymore, those words won’t change.
She sounded absolutely scandalised, leaning back with a hand over her heart. Harry looked at her wide eyed and shocked at the outburst and reaction. It was so wild. Nothing was making sense, but it felt easy.
That made Malfoy sigh, and put down his food. “Fine.”
The two weeks passed by much of the same. Malfoy either cooked or bought takeout. Harry offered to cook once, but Malfoy stared at him blankly until he stepped out of the kitchen. Harry wasn’t sure why, Harry was a fantastic cook and honestly he missed cooking a lot, and the kitchen slowly started calling to him.
He put the takeaway containers on the countertop, and pushed one to Malfoy. Over time, Harry noticed that Malfoy enjoyed the mac and cheese a lot more than other selections from the cafeteria, so he got him that today too.
Harry leaned forward into Malfoy’s line of sight. He gave a sheepish smile. “Hi.”
*****
“You were a mess, even before.” Malfoy told him.
With a small smile, he looked at Teddy who had watched it all. Before Harry could even open his mouth, Teddy stood up and grabbed a pack of exploding snap cards.
It might have been harsher than he intended, but he made no move to apologise. He well and truly did not enjoy it here at all. ‘New perspective,’ Kingsley said. How on earth was he gonna find that if everything had already been fucking perspectived. He hated it here.
He didn’t realise it was late until Isolt landed on top of the other case folders on his desk. Isolt had to peck and prod at Harry until he finally tore his eyes away from the papers.
Harry couldn’t believe what he was hearing. The office made sense, but did he really have uncontrollable magic back then? The him from before that was so perfect?
He thought of ways to spend the day, something that would rid the feeling of disgust and shame churning in his gut. The words that Malfoy told him yesterday, the things he never knew about that Harry from before.
“Because it’s been in my head since the party!” She replied, annoyed with the ear worm.
They ate peacefully, spending the 20 minutes in relaxing silence. Life always had its moment though, as a swarm of customers rushed into the shop again and Harry had to get back to work.
Ron and Hermione turned to him in surprise. Hermione started off first.
“Sorry, I don’t know what happened…” Harry tried.
Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes underneath his glasses. Lavender was right, he needed a break from all of this. He didn’t get any of it, why he was here, what he was meant to figure out. It was eating away at his soul.
“I heard about that, Tina told me. I hope you didn’t mind,” Kingsley quickly added.
“So, Harry, how are you and the pretentious blonde prat?” Lara joked as she leaned forward in excitement.
The last time he saw Blaise was at the Burrow. That felt like years ago, but it couldn’t have been more than 3 months ago. This Blaise was different though… As if Parkinson’s personality molded his to something slightly different.
Pansy kept her gaze on Harry. Food forgotten.
A few hours later, both of them were pleasantly surprised when Harry discovered he didn’t actually mind it anymore.
“Thank you, Harry. They didn’t show it, but they were nervous as all hell to meet you again.” Neville whispered.
“You’re way too smart for an 8 year old,” Harry finally said as soon as the lump went away.
He looked back to look at Malfoy, who looked surprised and touched at the same time. Harry smiled and waved with the last book in his hand. Beauty and the Beast glinted softly under the lamp light.
His thoughts started a war between himself. One side supportive of Harry’s judgement and actions of last night, the other, not so much. Pros and cons shot arrows at each other. It was giving him a migraine.
Harry staggered back a little and put his hands up. “Woah. No. Why would I do that?”
Hesitation and doubt crept into his mind as he took the next elevator down to the apparition point. He almost stopped and walked right back up to his desk multiple times before he was already at the point, security looking at him like he was on drugs.
His hands started to shake as he picked it up. It felt like he was holding the world in his hands. The picture restarted, but the feeling of pure happiness never left each of their faces.
“What?” Harry swallowed. “No, what are you talking about?”
A few hours later they returned with bags full of new things and packages waiting patiently for him at his open window. Harry gathers it all and brings it upstairs to his office.
He stopped visiting Malfoy during lunch breaks.
That twinge of jealousy came back again. Made itself known.
“Why are you so determined to think so less of yourself?”
“Her name is Isolt.”
He quickly went to work, Isolt perched on the window, watching Harry. First, he moved the desk to his liking. He grabbed all of the journals and diaries, all of that writing that was purely personal, and promptly
It was everything that happened right there, in those walls.
Harry’s jaw clenched, and his eyes glowed red for a single millisecond. But it was all masked quickly with a sad smile.
Harry didn’t even notice the fact that Malfoy had stopped shuffling, finally approving of the combination of papers surrounding each other, until Malfoy got up. Curiosity got the better of him, and he looked at the array of knowledge.
Harry let that sink in. A lot of the time in his Hogwarts days, he’d admired Ravenclaws and their easy intelligence. But after getting to know more about them through Cho and Luna, he knew that stereotype had no evidence. The house of Ravenclaw was not just easy intelligence or naturally gifted individuals, they were more than that.
“Harry, are you okay?” Lavender asked, transfiguring one of his dry inkwells into a seat.
“Yeah, you’ve both drunk so much firewhiskey, I’m surprised you’re able to think properly.” Goyle retorted.
Anger started flowing through his veins. The frustration weaved through every nerve ending like a pinball machine. Every single thought was painted red. His fists clenched so tightly he didn’t realise the nails digging into his palm. The unfairness of it all hit him square in the chest.
“Hi, Harry. I’m the one making sure you’re fit for auror work again.” She pulled up a clipboard. “Now, let’s get started, shall we?”
Malfoy was humming in the kitchen in the melody of… Was that the Hogwarts school song? Harry poked his head through and watched Malfoy move around the kitchen, oblivious to Harry’s shocked staring.
good. It was perfect, and brilliant, and everything was looking up. He was great. And now…” Harry trailed off, wiping his cheeks.
“Isn’t that the perfect reason why? You don’t know what other things there are, Harry.”
Well, at least, until he spoke.
They also visited Malfoy’s apothecary once during the two weeks. It wasn’t for very long as once it was opened, customers kept coming in and gawking at Harry Potter. Harry apologised profusely to Malfoy before leaving. Malfoy just shook his head and whispered, “Great for business.”
Malfoy moved over to Harry’s side. Harry stayed still as Malfoy leaned over, gently petting Isolt into moving onto his arm instead of Harry’s head. Malfoy’s leg bumped into Harry’s, and his breath stopped for a moment. With a sharp nose, he realised that Malfoy still smelt like potions brewing. It reminded him of potions class, but with a lighter, softer tone to it all.
“How old are you?” She started.
He’s been successful these past few days, they didn’t know yet. They couldn’t have.
Then he heard a soft hoot from on top of him. Then he started to notice the feel of talons on his head. Isolt was on his head. Huh.
But when Ron and Hermione held each other’s hands, and saw Ron squeeze just the tiniest bit, Harry wanted to run.
Harry squashed the disappointment in himself as he hugged Hagrid goodbye. He watched as Hagrid’s silhouette slowly disappeared up the hill. As soon as it was gone, the sadness filled his chest.
When he walked into the store again, Pansy and Blaise were there behind the counter while Malfoy was talking to another customer about the prices of calming draught compared to sleeping draught.
“Childhood muggle stories, even some wizarding ones. Then one day, you gave them away to anyone who would take it. Aunt Andromeda took in some of them, Teddy probably doesn’t realise many of his books used to be yours. No matter how many times I asked you why you did it, you never told me.”
“Have you tried reading th-”
But the pure adoration in Malfoy’s eyes, the affection pouring so bravely onto his face, that’s what sealed it. It surprised Harry so much that his reply ran out of his mouth before he even had a chance to form the thought.
She finally smiled properly this time, and looked up at the lake. “I think I’m doing quite well in the other subjects, like herbology. Professor Longbottom is kind enough to give extra credit lessons whenever he’s free, and Defense is such a fun subject…”
The table just laughed it off, and Harry tried not to feel jealous of what they had. He knew he had it once too, in the 5 year void in his mind. Malfoy came into his mind, in glimpses of smiles from breakfast, or quick looks of concern during dinner.
“What a strange room.” Harry commented as he looked back at the desk.
“Yeah, he did, actually. How’d you know?” Goyle asked.
“Yeah, not too bad. You?”
“What?”
With haste, Harry walked over to Neville. Neville was one of the many who had changed a lot throughout the past 5 years. He wanted to know his development too.
He smiled and waved at them as he walked out the door. He passed by Malfoy and waved at him too. Malfoy’s smile was bright as he waved him off.
“Hey, Harry?” Teddy asked as they were playing exploding snap.
Harry laughed and patted his shoulder. “No, that’s good. Means I’ll try even harder to beat you in the next duel.”
Harry flopped on his chair and put his head on the table. He sighed deeply and closed his eyes, trying to understand this whole new thing. He groaned in anguish.
“You should. He’s been worried sick over you,” Minerva sighed. “He still looks at you and sees the tiny baby he carried out of Godric’s Hollow.”
Even Harry saw Blaise stand a little straighter in his peripheral at that question. “That person you befriended isn’t me anymore.” Harry stated.
Harry felt heat rushing to his neck. Oh Merlin, how’d he forget Isolt was up there. Truthfully, she hadn’t moved at all, and then he was distracted by the food, and then Malfoy was being actually pretty okay. It’s been a busy hour, okay?
Malfoy hummed happily which made Harry very suspicious. “My favourite, and
By the time Harry heard the spare bedroom’s door open and the sun knock gently on his curtains, he was already changed and ready for Hogwarts at least 2 hours too early. He yawned, already exhausted, and started heading down to meet Malfoy for breakfast.
Thinking took too much energy. The hammering in his skull only grew louder whenever he had enough time to think about everything that could’ve changed, everything that he had missed. Were the glasses beside him the same ones? Is his favourite mug still there at home, waiting to be used? Hell, is it even his favourite mug anymore? These thoughts, once entered, never left until he slept, too exhausted by it all.
Perhaps that terrible prophet article wasn’t so terrible after all. Despite the horrible context, the shop seemed to become a lot more lively.
Harry, not taken aback one bit by that, just smiled.
He had time to visit Kingsley, and he knew he should, but he needed more time to perfect his idea. Besides, there was one person he knew he needed to visit after the entire day. He knew they’d want to see him too.
he thought.
“They’re okay. Well, as okay as they can be.” Ron sat at the foot of Harry’s bed. “You have to understand that we’ve told them about your memory loss. And it’s been really hard.”
“Okay. I promise I’ll find you if it becomes overwhelming.”
As he did, he looked over the eagle owl. There was a small hint of worry growing in his chest. A lot of higher ups owned eagle owls, so maybe it was Kingsley, or maybe someone from the Daily Prophet saw him with his friends.
Truthfully, it truly a miracle that he didn’t splinch himself. He tripped over himself as the street lined with stores came into view.
The next day was torture. The moment he sat down, a stack of folders appeared on his desk. There were only three cases, but the details made it seem like a thousand. Harry almost wanted to cry.
He could, for the first time again, read the things that made him happy.
Quick footsteps, border on running, resounded out the door until Malfoy appeared. Harry looked at him and then rubbed his face in exasperation. Malfoy looked normal, casual with a touch of not trying too hard. It was slightly infuriating.
Amazed at how low Malfoy’s walls were around Harry, he grabbed the plates, cutlery, and glasses, and brought them to the table. He laid them all neatly, well as neat as they could be, and sat down to wait.
.” But his aim was off and hit the wall instead.
least favourite.”
“You’re a bit different, did something happen?”
“I’m doing fine,” Harry replied, controlling the emotions. “It’s been hard since getting out of St Mungo’s, my memory and all.”
“I shouldn’t’ve said that,” Hagrid said. But Harry looked at him with pleading eyes. Finally, Hagrid softened. “Yeah, ye chose Tatus. Ye usually go wif Hace o’er there.”
In fact, he stopped doing anything but work. He received letters from the connections of Lia Adwin, and had secure plans for a chat. That was one of the few things that seemed to be moving.
The scene replayed over and over again. Harry picked out new things here and there through the graininess of the photos. Like the snitch that flew behind them all just before the flash, or how Luna’s drink sloshed out of her cup, the way Nott and Neville were holding hands, and how Goyle had his arm around Neville. Harry didn’t know how long he stared at it, watching this memory over and over again.
“So he’s all clear?” Kingsley asked, sticking to the goal.
Harry went through the floo first. The flames of international floo smelt slightly more like woodfire than usual, and it had a darker tinge to their colour. But Harry didn’t care to notice, because Malfoy was still waving at him, a bright smile on his face.
“Hello, Harry.”
Malfoy brought his hand close to his chest and took a step back. His face fell and his bottom lip quivered. He looked like he was going to cry, and Harry almost reached out to him. Almost. But his anger was still too strong.
He fell asleep on the floor, head resting on the chair he was leaning on.
“No, I didn’t! I was very picky that night,” George chimed in, then went back to his conversation with Arthur.
“I don’t think my brain has finished processing the library yet.”
“Who will be there?”
When he got home, Malfoy had emerged from his office, and was surrounded by books and papers in the lounge room. Harry took a deep breath and sat down next to him on the floor.
“Oh, I don’t remember putting a stasis charm on it?”
Harry looked up as Malfoy moved and grabbed a simple red shirt with a golden snitch on it, and black jeans. Malfoy held it out and Harry hesitantly grabbed it.
Harry closed his eyes to think. It was just blurry colours and noise, layers of shouts and then blackness. Before that was lunch with Ron and Hermione to celebrate Hermione being Minister for Magic so quickly. He told healer Tina about it.
To Draco.
“Of course,
Harry wanted to hold his breath and stop time so he could think. So that he could have a proper reply to the way Malfoy was looking at him. Despite the sunken eyes, messy hair, and exhausted body, he looked at Harry like he was everything. There was too much love in it. Too much affection. It was too much.
When the eagle owl left, Malfoy seemed to release a lot of tension. Like he’d been scared or something with the owl having been there.
Malfoy nodded a response, still smiling. It wasn’t just tikka masala though, it seemed to be different cuisine takeouts, from the tikka masala to honey chicken to pork in a lovely sweet sauce.
“No.” Harry answered.
“Nah, I’m alright here. Bu’, if yer don’ mind, can ye help wit’ a class I’m teachin’ in a few minutes?”
Finally, Malfoy moved away, Isolt perched happily on his arm. The way Malfoy looked at Isolt was heartwarming. He was so careful and gentle with her. Harry didn’t realise he hadn’t seen them interact before, but the way they were right now showed there wasn’t a single doubt that Malfoy deeply cared for and loved Isolt.
“It’s okay, Ma-Draco and I left a little early anyways,” Harry smiled, hoping no one caught the slip up.
Minerva smiled and nodded.
“Uh, hi.” Harry slowly approached them.
“Okay.” Malfoy smiled halfheartedly at him. “Thank you.”
He wanted to vomit when she added on, “I just found something new 4 days ago. It’s slow, but if I’m right…” She trailed off into a sip of her coffee before she disappeared.
In Harry’s blurry vision, he watched as the man’s head shot up. The slightly fuzzy light blond hair and slim figure seemed very familiar to him. Harry tried not to scream when he realised it was Draco Malfoy. Out of everyone to be by his bedside, he didn’t quite expect him.
“Students, step away. Mr Potter is here for other reasons. Unfortunately, he won’t be teaching today.” Minerva’s voice, filled with the authority of a Headmaster, boomed over the crowd.
Just as he returned back in the kitchen, Malfoy whispered with a smile on his face, “I still know you.”
, Harry thought to himself.
Ron cast a patronus, and told it to find healer Tina and to come to Autumn Avenue quickly. The russell-terrier bounded through the air and through the window, startling a very quiet and watchful Isolt.
Harry smiled, and took the letter off. Before he could start reading it, Isolt flew over to his desk and pecked at the corner of it. Harry realised he hadn’t checked the drawers yet. In one swift movement, he went to his desk and opened up the top drawer that Isolt seemed to be pecking at.
The three of them just stood there, a counter between them. The mix of emotions were simmering low in his chest, and he thought of what he could do besides run.
All too suddenly, a tear rolled down his cheek. It stopped and kissed at the scars he didn’t remember getting. He gently wiped it away.
He decided to think about that later.
His throat hurt slightly. Telling stories truly wasn’t his strong point, evident by his constant backtracking and stops in the middle of his sentences. But Kingsley, probably used to it, didn’t care.
“It’s really good to see you again, Harry.” Andromeda said.
“Oh, uh, sure.”
Hermione moved to hug him as Harry’s tears started falling.
Teddy was running around, snitch plushie in hand, like nothing meant more than that toy and his speed. Harry wanted to hug him tightly, let him know he missed him and that things would be okay as soon as he remembered. But Harry didn’t want to bring that smile away from his face, so with a will stronger than he thought he had, he continued to look around.
Hermione grabs a glass of water and gives it to him as he tries to hold back his tears. He holds it, but doesn’t drink. He just looks into it. His shaking hands distort his reflection, making him look slightly different, warped, but still recognisable in a weird way. He blinks away his tears and looks up at Hermione.
“In here!”
The view outside, and a window almost as big as the wall. The office really was his place. It was open and freeing, he didn’t feel cramped even with piles of paper everywhere. Harry applauded the unknown Harry, thanking him for such care and thought into the place he wanted to call home.
Harry looked down, unable to stare at Teddy in the eyes. “I just want to be him.”
“Uh, sure. Wait, Harry, does that mean no memories have come?”
“Oh, yeah, I get that.”
He spilled it all out in between sniffles and voice cracks. His throat was raw and his voice was barely a whisper.
Hermione sat on the seat beside his bed as Ron threw up a Muffliato. Harry’s eyebrow raised, but he didn’t ask any questions. The couple gave each other an encouraging nod before turning back to Harry.
“Almost lunch time.” He said to Malfoy.
“Is there a particular reason you’re trying so hard in potions when your other classes are doing so well?” Harry asked carefully.
“Uh, Harry, what the
Running down the stairs, skipping the last few steps, helped with the adrenaline buzzing through his veins. He was going to do it, just quickly, no thoughts or presence needed, and then he’d be on his way in the floo.
“Since Draco’s shop blew up, my plants haven’t been growing enough to meet demand,” Neville added.
“Are you okay?”
“Hey, what’s wrong?”
It was carelessly thrown glasses on the desk as he looked up at the ceiling, wondering why he had to go through this too,
Ron let out a long sigh. “As okay as they can be, it’s been pretty crazy lately.”
He could hear the moment her potions grades crept back into her mind.
As he began to walk away from his desk, Isolt flew out the door. Harry realised that he didn’t worry about Isolt anymore. That he either didn’t feel the need to, or the want to, and that when he got home, she’ll be there.
Minerva simply smiled at him. “Hagrid told you one day that certain magical animals were becoming endangered, in particular, the hippogriffs. So you worked hard, you educated yourself.”
Now cut to Harry, near to tears, huddling and hiding in the shadows of his boyfriend’s store. Pathetic.
Neville, the absolute madman, left Harry and ran to them and hugged them tightly. Harry watched their greeting, soft kisses and gentle touches of hands. And for some reason, Malfoy came into his mind.
Malfoy smirked and mumbled, “Oh, I think Hogwarts heard you.”
He walked slowly towards Malfoy’s store. It wasn’t time yet for him to be there, and he knew he’d be a bit early. But he thought of this place for a reason, so surely it would be okay, right?
He looked at the mess and was met with all types of notes about potions. For a brief moment, he thought of Kiana and hoped she was okay. Then he changed his focus solely on Malfoy beside him, ignoring Harry’s presence and staring at the notes.
The insult was laced with layers of affection. Harry wanted to run. It was all too fast, too weird, too uncomfortable, too… much.
“Would you really?” Parkinson pressed.
“Yeah, I have. Everyone’s being so nice.” Harry wasn’t lying, they really were. The problem was him. “I’ve been seeing Hermione and Ron, and yesterday I went to Hogwarts.”
“Precisely. Almost time to eat.” With that Malfoy left, disappearing to the kitchen.
“Yeah, and Harry went straight for the treacle tart, didn’t he?” Neville added from the dinner table.
It wasn’t much at all, but at least it wasn’t a lie. Harry didn’t know how to act like he was in love with Malfoy. But he guessed lying low was the best call. Lara did say we were ‘a secretive lot.’
then inwardly groaned. It was 8’oclock. Hours had passed since he was meant to leave. He looked around at his co-workers, expecting to see each desk empty.
He stood up, grabbed his stuff and walked out that door. Looking back once, and only once, he saw Lavender cast the last needed cleaning charms on his desk. He made note to thank her for that tomorrow.
*****
Before his two sides could continue in argument, Andromeda asked how Draco was doing.
This Malfoy in front of him was a near perfect image of what he remembered in Hogwarts years. It wasn’t an unknown Malfoy anymore, it was the same Draco Malfoy who stalked the halls like a king, who bullied his friends relentlessly, a coward. Harry almost cried at the familiarity.
Harry kept walking, unsure of what to say as each option felt like a lie.
There were thousands of them. Tiny small frames the size of his palm to grand frames that were the size of his torso. The clench of his heart never went away as he quickly skimmed over each one, unpacking them with the utmost care, and laying them on the floor.
Harry decided not to push with the questions though. He’d learnt a decent amount today, there was no need to push Malfoy and end up with another duel.
“Yeah. Yeah, I will.” Ron nodded and started walking off. “You too.”
“Is everything okay?” Hermione asked, worry all over her face.
But Harry's had enough. There’s been too much today. In fact, it’s been pretty loaded this past month since he woke up. No memories have resurfaced, nothing is making any sort of sense, the two people who he does know a little are not here, and Draco bloody Malfoy’s hand is blocking his access to physical reminders of anything that’s happened the past 5 years.
Malfoy smiled at the remark. “Yeah, I guess so. Younger us would never have imagined we’d be as civil as we are now.”
Malfoy, distracted by Harry’s flinch in pain, was hit with the spell. He shot up in the air, barely missing the ceiling, and fell. He landed on his knees, then fell forward, holding himself up with his hands. He gasped, then pointed his wand right at Harry.
forget something like this?
Now it was the 6th day. Her case file still in his hands, and stress emanating off of him so strongly that no one even dared to look his way.
Teddy crossed his arms, and continued to analyse Harry like a professional auror would. “You said that, so why were you pretending to be the other Harry when you talked to Andromeda before?”
But it wasn’t. There were people reading, some snoozing, some packing up for the day. Despite their shift hours being done, they still worked a bit overtime. It looked… Voluntary.
With a strong jab in his heart, Harry realised that his Kingsley had changed.
He must’ve stared at it for too long, willing any memory to come back to his brain so that he could go back to the aurors instead of his crappy desk job. By the time he thought about going downstairs, he was running late.
Despite not caring, he walked through the kitchen and the living room just to be sure. He almost decided to check the rooms upstairs until a note on the kitchen counter caught his attention. Harry picked it up and read it.
It was hard though. The candle was too far to the left, or the stack of folders wasn’t in a good reaching place from his desk. He never changed it though. Harry kept it as a reminder for how different he is from the Harry before. When he gets his memories back, he’ll be okay with the layout of the office. It’ll be fine.
But at least he wasn’t looking at Malfoy anymore.
What came back next was the pain. Excruciating pain. He felt like there were ants trapped in the middles of his bones, his skin felt like each crevice contained a pool of molten lava, and the hair on his skin felt like wasp stings.
“The sand was the worst part, somehow it never left.” Andromeda sighed at the memory. “No matter how many cleaning charms I used, or muggle washings, the sand just never disappeared.”
Hagrid pointed to the hippogriff with white and golden feathers. It had caught Harry’s eyes, but he didn’t feel any type of connection from before. Harry tried so hard to make himself remember something about Hace, trying to remember the feel of their feathers under the palm of his hand. But nothing came.
“I thought you hated the school song?” Harry asked, finally making his presence known.
“No.”
Harry just kept smiling. Going to Hogwarts was like a breath of fresh air, a well needed hug, and a gentle kiss on his forehead. Hogwarts would forever be his home, and he couldn’t see himself ever not visiting. He guessed that was why he helped with Defense Against the Dark Arts class and duelling clubs.
Draco thought about Potter’s proposition for a moment before responding right away. The thought of having a quiet, and maybe even calm summer seemed too good to be true, but so very appealing. He knew he wanted to put down the anger he felt towards himself, his parents, Voldemort, Severus, the impending war, all of it, he wanted to put it all down even if it could only be for a little while. Draco smiled to himself before looking back up at Potter with a grin of his own. “okay Potter, let’s start over.” Potter gave him a quizzical look, “start over, what do you mean?”
Both boys held the other’s gaze almost assessing each other before daring to speak, both being so very careful with their next chosen words, neither having the audacity to break the silence first, and neither risking the thought that the other may very well have the same fears and trepidations that they had themselves.
He could feel the bond thrumming under his skin, he couldn’t see Potter, he could only hear Dudley’s laughter growing distinctly louder, then suddenly he heard Potter let out scream of agony, and his panic began to intensify. His brain shut off, and Draco wasn’t sure if he was moving solely based on the bond’s instinct, or his heart’s instinct, but he reasoned that in that moment it didn’t matter; Potter needed him, and that was the only thing that mattered.
And just when Harry thought he truly could handle no more, Draco rolled them both so that gray eyes were looking down at him from under silver fringe and his body was wedged between Harry’s thighs in a way that allowed Harry to feel just how hot Draco Malfoy was for him. It was his turn to groan and pull Draco’s mouth to his hungrily one hand sliding behind Draco’s head and winding through his hair, and the other hair sliding down his back, and up underneath his shirt skimming over all Draco’s soft and ultra-sensitive skin before clasping onto his shoulder to anchor him.
With his heart clenched, he turned to face Harry who was sprawled out in the sun in their most recent favorite of all of the brunette’s hiding places. It was a small clearing surrounded by trees, tucked back just a little way from privet drive. Often opting for seclusion to avoid any other run-ins with Dudley and his band of misfits. He reached out a hand, running it through the brunette’s unruly locks earning a contented sigh from Harry as he nuzzled up into Draco’s touch.
Harry risked one last longing glance at Draco before he stealthily exited their room and headed down the stairs doing his very best to ignore the tug of the bond almost propelling him back up the stairs and under the sheets tangling with pale smooth lines. Harry squeezed his eyes shut and jaggedly ran a hand through his untidy hair, he knew he couldn’t go too far, or he wouldn’t be able to focus through the pain.
Malfoy paused a second before continuing, and Harry didn’t dare speak, he knew Malfoy was on the brink of something, a realization, a confession, Harry didn’t know but he wasn’t going to stand in his way.
Draco blinked a few times really truly taking in what the other boy was saying and feeling the familiar surge of exactly the inner turmoil Harry had been struggling with, as he had struggled through it all year whilst walking the hallways of Hogwarts.
A lot of Draco’s books had elements of war, and he wasn’t sure that was something Potter would really see as an escape as much as Draco had. Although these books gave Draco a look at two perspectives and helped to break down a lot of the indoctrinated beliefs, he had never had a choice in, he knew that’s not what Potter needed. Potter needed an actual escape, to look inside the mind of someone else and see what it felt like to live there for a while. And with that thought, he knew which book he had in mind and even though he was semi-confidant that it would be a good fit he still found himself nervously chewing his lip in the common room tucked into his usual arm chair nervously awaiting the moment Potter would flop himself down across from him with that wide grin asking which escape Draco had chosen for him.
Harry continued on, speaking at the ceiling, “I’ve spent most of our summer forcing everything I’ve felt about the future, Voldemort, all the unknown, and you back into the furthest darkest hole in my mind to save for another day.”
“But then I saw you with him, with Harry I mean.” She looked up at him eyes knowing and earnest.
Harry watched as Malfoy ran his hands over his face, and through his sleep-rumpled hair before he spoke again, softer this time, “that’s what I dream about, sometimes I’m forced to relive the things I’ve done, sometimes I’m forced to relive being tortured by my father, and sometimes my mind creates new and even more terrible things,” Harry watched as Malfoy trailed off, and looked at him eyes filled with anguish, unsure of how to continue.
Harry let out a laugh, “Honestly, I’d rather have you wear nothing around the house more often,” and it was Draco’s turn to laugh.
Draco let out a laugh, he’d fully intended to do just that earlier. He stood up, graced Harry with a wink, and waltzed inside the burrow to work his charm on Mrs. Weasley.
Draco broke away first, out of breath, he rested his forehead against Harry’s, eyes closed, hands cradling his face. He mused that the pain had fully dissipated, but the prickle of pleasure the bond also elicited had lit his skin on fire.
But he knew, he knew his mother would never leave his father behind. He’d always been frustrated with her, he could never understand why she was always so willing to forgive and follow a man who was filled with such blind hatred…that is, he’d never understood until he’d fallen in love with Harry. Love sometimes made you do stupid things, and often made you blind. Though, Draco mused that with Harry this was only partly true, sure his feelings made him feel impulsive and at times desperate, but Harry also made him feel like anything was possible; good things were possible. He idly wondered if this was how it had been for his parents too at first, despite their arranged marriage, but quickly pushed the thought away.
“And you,” Draco turned on Petunia. “You should know your son is either gay, or at the very least going to get his arse kicked if he ever takes his foul mouth out of this sad little…town? Community? I’m not sure what even to call it. Either way, best to teach him some manners yeah?”
“I’m not sure that’s what Dumbledore meant when he suggested touching,” Potter spoke a tint of breathy sarcasm in his voice that had Draco’s head shooting back up to look at him again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had gone to sleep that night reluctantly. He found himself waiting up, down in the common room long after most students had gone to sleep. Hermione, who was usually last up studying, stood up around midnight and gave Draco a soft smile and a knowing look, “Night Draco, try not to stay up too much longer.” He tried to give her a small smile, but it wasn’t earnest, and he knew she wasn’t stupid. He waited up a little while longer, then resolved that Harry probably wasn’t going to come looking for him that night and told himself that the sooner he went to bed the sooner he could confront Harry the following day.
“So, what does this mean, you’re gay now?”
“Both Mr. and Mrs. Weasley implied that they expected to see me at the Burrow for Christmas, Draco replied taking in Weasley’s eye roll before directing his attention back towards Granger.
Harry’s grin widened, and Draco could tell that he was immensely pleased.
“Really?” Harry replied with a nudge back. “So really this is just about you being worried I need looking after then?”
“I need a shower, care to join me Potter?”
Whether or not Remus had witnessed the display he didn’t let on, he simply held out his arm and let both boys take hold before aparating them to just outside the burrow with a flash.
The headmaster gave Harry a deliberate look before continuing on once more, “You must know what Mr. Malfoy has at stake. This scenario places him in grave danger, and only time will reveal to us all how it will play out.” At this last statement Dumbledore graces Professor Snape with another severe look, before focusing his attention back onto Harry, “I, of course, will be speaking with your Aunt and Uncle Harry. So, rest assured that they will be aware, to a certain extent, of your situation with Mr. Malfoy. I’m sure that they will be welcoming, and that they will be sure not to give either of you any trouble over the unexpected inconvenience. Other than that, I have arranged for the two of you to stay here in the hospital wing until you depart home on the Hogwarts express as to avoid any unnecessary discomfort for the two of you.”
“Ughh,” he ran his hands through his hair in pure exasperation.
And suddenly, Draco didn’t feel privy to the conversation anymore. He felt as if he were intruding on a severely private moment and felt an immediate sense of guilt that there was absolutely nothing, he could do but remain still until it was over.
They were his family, and it was easy to understand after a moment with the Dursley’s that family was something Harry had never experienced until Hogwarts, until Hermione and Ron, the Weasley’s, Sirius, Remus, and now Draco. These were all things he’d whispered against his pillow while Draco absentmindedly ran the sole of his foot up and down the top of his, which had made him feel safe.
They eyed each other for a few precious moments before Harry had him pressed to the closed door; hands pushed up the front of his jumper. He groaned as Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck hands clenched onto the back of his shirt; as if Harry was going anywhere.
“Yes,” Draco grinned out, and followed Harry as they stealthily stole across the hallway and into the bathroom.
“But if you hurt Harry, I swear Draco, you’ll not have me to deal with but all nine Weasley’s and they can be incredibly unforgiving when given the chance despite how incredibly kind they are.”
2nd of course...of course, my Draco chapters are always a little more interesting, so hoping not to disappoint with this next one!
Where had Severus been all summer? Draco hadn’t dared to owl for fear of being intercepted by one of the dark lord’s spies. Perhaps, that had also been his god father’s reason for being so absent. However, not even that rational train of thought could quell his building nerves. He knew he was one wrong thought away from snapping.
Instead of being yanked from his thoughts by the usual soft touch from Draco, he was pulled by the swift sound of their bedroom door being pushed forward, and a tall, and scruffy Remus Lupin entering the already small space.
“I can tell he feels the same, I’ve honestly never seen him like this. It’s actually quite comical… You’d better speak to Ronald quickly before Harry makes an arse of himself. I can tell he hasn’t really got the best self-control when it comes to you.”
While Harry was bold in action, he was spending most of his time pretending to be completely engaged in reading his book agonizing over whether or not to try and steal a glance at Malfoy’s reaction to their physical contact. However, before Harry could push himself to peek over, he heard Malfoy clear his throat, giving Harry an actual excuse to look up from the novel he was supposed to be tied up in.
Harry awoke to the distant sound of murmured voices. His head suffered from a dull throb and he struggled to pry his eyes open, feeling as though he’d been asleep for ten years. With some effort his eye lids complied with his request, and blinked into focus, as he looked around his eyes were met with too many things for his mind to fully comprehend. At the foot of his bed Professor Dumbledore and Professor Snape were in a hushed and intense disagreement it seemed. While beside him on either side Hermione and Ron were in a hushed disagreement of their own. Harry looked from Hermione to Ron, and then back to Hermione, “Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, “Oh, we thought you were still sleeping,” her eyes darted back to Ron and she hushed out through gritted teeth, “See, I told you Ronald, I told you that you were being too loud.” The ginger haired boy rolled his eyes, “honestly, Hermione, with the way those two are carrying on and you blame me for waking Harry,” he stated with a side glance and gesture towards the two professors arguing at the foot of Harry’s bed. “What are they going at it about?” Harry asked with a glance between his two best mates.
Draco allowed himself to let out his own shaky laugh and be pulled into Harry’s side as the other boy wrapped his arms around him. Draco let himself get lost in all the warmth and sighed deeply taking in Harry’s scent and softness; he never wanted the brunette to let him go.
“I knew it!” Fred laughed out high-fiving George without even looking at him.
“Go on, have a read,” Harry replied, gracing the other boy with a chaste kiss and extended the letter out to him.
Draco gave a curt nod in response, and then she was gone.
He leaned down again gripping Harry’s cock at the base and placed a kiss to the head before taking him into his mouth as much as he could. He felt Harry tense up and heard him let out an agonized groan as Draco slowly dragged his tongue along the base before circling the head and taking him as deep as his throat would allow.
For the rest of us, a moment we've all been waiting for! LOL <3
Potter’s praise, wonder, and touch combined with the prickle of the bond had Draco feeling dizzy, but in all the best ways. All he could do was smile widely at the other boy, “It was nothing Potter, the lot of pricks deserved it.”
Draco felt his insides lurch a little bit at being lumped together with several negative things, Voldemort being one of them.
“yeah?” Draco said doused in a haze of lust, as he thrust forward a little more intently, earning himself a full moan from Harry.
“No matter, it looks good on you Draco.”
“You’re the beautiful one Potter,” Draco spoke sheepishly, biting his bottom lip gently as he dared to look back up at Harry.
He felt the blonde relax into his arms and press his cheek firmly to meet his own, wrapping his arms securely around Harry’s waist. They stood like that for a long moment, content to just be with one another after what felt like ages of separation. Harry let the realization of just how difficult this school year was going to be wash over him, and not for the first time either. His mind had been frantic that last few days, knowing that bond or no bond his desire to be this near Draco would be insatiable as always.
“This is the bit I’ve explained to ‘Mione…Draco gets me in ways that might be hard for the two of you to understand. Voldemort’s taken up residence in his home, he’s seen things like I have, he’s seen Voldemort…he gets nightmares like I do, and I can talk to him.”
He was hauled away from finishing that delicious thought by Ron nudging his shoulder, “alright mate? You’ve been awfully quiet since you got here.”
Without a second thought he knew he was set; his mind would not change. Now all he had to do was consider the how, and the rest would come easily enough. Armed, and ready to take on the consequences knowing there were only a few weeks before each boy would be on the Hogwarts express headed away from the castle for the summer, Severus contrived a plan.
By the time he had finished the letter to Hermione he knew, he knew he was completely and utterly gone when it came to Draco. He wasn’t in full comprehension as to what that meant about himself, it was clear now more than ever he liked blokes, obviously, but he wasn’t so sure how strict it was.  Harry wasn’t clear, but the one thing he was sure of was how deeply he felt for the blonde wanker, his former enemy, and that was enough for him right now.
“I just want you to know that, I know it won’t be easy for you, for either of you…but you have my full support.” Draco felt his eyes widen without his permission, and silently scolding himself once again for letting himself get this out of practice in concealing his emotions away.
As much as Harry wanted to apologize, he was starting to worry that his temper could make him hurt someone, even if by accident. Or worse, on purpose. He could lash out without realizing, and accidentally hurt Hermione, Ron, Draco, even his own family… He’d begun to think he needed to ask Snape if there was some sort of potion that helped with these sorts of mood swings.
“This is officer Lawrence,” he said. “If you don’t mind opening up, I’d like to have a word.”
The witch glanced at him, but couldn’t seem to meet his eyes. She wet her lips, likely a nervous habit, and looked down at the parchment in her hands. “I… We’re doing everything we can to help her. So, please, be patient.”
It was then that Harry realized something else. Something that he and Petunia had in common. They had both been lied to about Lily Potter’s death. Him by Petunia, and Petunia by Dumbledore.
“It’s a great idea, Hermione,” Harry tells her, pausing as she seems to puff up with pride. “But Ron’s right. Right now, even just talking about it, is a bad idea. Umbridge hasn’t found any reason to stay yet. There’s still a chance of her having to leave in a week. So until we know if she’s staying or not, we should do what we can to keep our heads down. We don’t want to risk everything with a half cocked idea.”
“Now,” Harry could hear Umbridge say. “How long have you had this post, exactly?”
“Yes?” McGonagall said, turning to look at Umbridge with a scowl. Her brow was knit tightly together, lips pressed into a severely displeased line.
She squirmed uncomfortably under his hard gaze, as if rethinking her idea, but it didn’t take long for her to regain her nerve. “The way Defense is going right now, a lot of people won’t know how to defend themselves. I thought, since you spent all summer training, you could teach others Defense. It would have to be in secret, of course, and we’d have to be careful with who we invite, but it would be better then what we have right now.”
Harry didn’t say anything, but he did nod. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, and Harry followed the Slytherin’s up to Transfiguration. He said goodbye to Ron at the entrance hall, as the redhead went up the stairs to his History of Magic class. Harry made sure that his sour mood at the news of Maria’s class didn’t show, though it was quickly forgotten as they reached McGonagall’s class.
With each word, Petunia seemed to grow more and more frightened. A hand came up to cover her mouth, shaking in shock. She stared, horrified, as Harry finished.
Harry picked up his page of notes, holding it out to her. He’d made something up, having to do with moonstones so he wouldn’t get in trouble for doing his essay. He’d looked up the meaning of moonstones, then peace, and poison since he was in the P section and hadn’t wanted to go looking for the meaning behind love potions.
Harry watched him go, not really sure what he’d done this time. A glance around showed the Slytherin’s who had heard him staring with mixed looks of pity and concern. He wasn’t sure what he’d said to earn such looks, but he decided that wasn’t exactly important right now. There were more important things to worry about right now. He had an essay to finish, and he wanted to read the first chapter for his History of Magic class, so he doesn’t have to worry about falling asleep from Binns' dull lectures. Not to mention the horde of first years that needed help.
He knew almost immediately that Ron was lying. Hermione? A bad idea? That was his and Ron’s expertise. Hermione was the one that thought things through and made a coherent and functioning plan once she’d done all the research.
Reaching up, Harry grabbed at the corner that hung over his right shoulder, feeling the soft white material. As he ran his fingers over it, his thumb felt something on the underside, and he turned it over to look. It was his first name, stitched in the same soft red as the border of the blanket.
So Harry went home. He had training to do.
He scowled at her. “Aunt Petunia.” He paused, then decided that this polite ‘let’s pretend we’re still family’ thing wasn’t working. Harry stood, placing his hands on the table, face set and serious. “Mrs. Dursley, your sister didn’t die in a random scuffle. She was murdered, in cold blood, while trying to protect Muggles like yourself in a war meant to eradicate you. Now, the man that was leading the opposition has been dead for the last thirteen years, but due to certain circumstances, he has
There was his mother, so pale and feeble. She had been laid back, a white wrapping around her temple and forehead, eyes barely open. Harry could see a small red spot on the bandaging, and a reddish-brown line going down the shoulder of her robes, the ones she had left in the morning before. The sight made Harry sick to his stomach.
. And even if I was, you know Hermione’s like a sister to me. It would be so weird.”
His mother also started the Gala planning about that time, as there was only a month left before the event. They would still have the party, half to keep up appearances and half in an attempt to gather information. Harry would still have the mandrake leaf, but the plan was to just have him make a small appearance at the beginning, maybe do a quick dance with Marrissa, before heading back up to his room with Ron and Hermione. It would give his family a chance to convince any Death Eaters present the idea that they didn’t believe Harry, play up the worried parents bit, in an attempt to ease them into a false sense of security and confidence.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They’ve distanced themselves from me,” Harry eventually said. “Aside from Blaise Zabini and a handful of first and second years, none of them will talk to me outside of class. They’re all in dangerous places right now, with the exception of Blaise. He’s the only one in my year that doesn’t have a relative that is a convicted or ‘accused’ Death Eater.”
Harry’s lungs burned as he hurried up the steps to St. Mungo’s hospital alongside Derrick and their father. They had barely had a moment to grab their coats that morning before they had gone sprinting for the Floo fireplace. His father had been so flustered, as they all were, that Derrick had to grab a fist full of powder for him.
“No,” the Mediwitch said. “She hasn’t said anything. And… Well, we’re still running tests, but we aren’t sure what exactly is wrong with her. Save for the head injuries, she has strange full body stiffness to the likeness of the Body Bind jinx, but it’s been too long. There’s also strange pupil dilation. We think it might have something to do with her head injury, but they’re oddly large, and we can’t be sure until it’s healed.”
Following Petunia to the small dining table, Harry took a seat across from her. She frowned, clearly confused and trying not to show it, when Jonathan stayed standing, just a bit away from the table.
Rather confused, he sat down on the floor.
He didn’t sound nearly as convinced as he wanted Harry to believe. Something was definitely wrong. They had dinner without her, the table so tense, with no one really feeling like eating. Still, they hoped for the best. That she had simply gotten caught up in whatever she had been doing, and would be back by morning.
The gathering group went quiet, and Harry looked up to find several odd stares being shot his way.
Harry couldn’t help it. He snapped. “Yes.”
“Right,” Draco snapped, dusting his robes off as if holding a cat for a moment would cover him in hair. “Well, I’m sure you both will be wanting to get up to dinner early again. We might as well go now. I can do my work at the table while we wait.”
With another sigh, he reached to grab one of the pastries. “I know. But she can start planning for that Defense group. I started thinking about it, and we might not have a choice anymore. Umbridge can use what I said in Divination to convince Fudge that she needs to stay, meaning Maria won’t be able to teach what she wants without pushback. And then no one will be able to defend themselves when the war gets into full swing.”
“It could be useful,” his father said, humming. “If you happen to be something that would realistically be in the castle, such as a cat, you can use that form to go to and from places without worry.”
With a sharp breath, Harry cast once more. “
“I was wondering,” Umbridge said, smiling as if she had won some sort of contest, “if you had received my note informing you of your inspection?”
With that somber note, they did their best to move on. Freya’s husband Kale spoke up, mentioning how there had been a few strange people around the dragon grounds in Romania. Neva and Emit confess that the near slander to Harry’s name that the Prophet kept putting out was actually the cut down versions. There were hundreds of articles that had been cut for one reason or another.
When Harry finally made it to Defense, his second class that Wednesday morning, he found that Umbridge was already inside, as Maria excitedly told her about her lesson plan. She looked rather enthused, while Umbridge looked begrudgingly pleased. Harry took the chance to sit in the front, simply bringing out the journals that Maria had been sending him over the years.
“Ron?” Harry called as he stepped inside.
He joined Blaise at dinner, with Noah and the other first years gathered around them. They all seemed to need help with something or other, asking Harry questions for every class they had that day. It was a bit concerning, as he couldn't remember his first year being that difficult. Not on the first day at least.
Harry blinked, thinking for a moment. He supposed they would be a fair bit of help, if they needed to do anything that would get them in trouble. They could also watch out for Harry in the dorms. After all, they still had no idea what Slytherins would be on his side and which would be under Voldemort’s power. And if they needed to meet in secret, he could probably send one to Sila to open a tunnel that led to the Chamber. Though, Draco knew about the Chamber, and could reveal Harry’s secret monstrous allie to Voldemort…
With a sigh, Harry walked over to his two friends, already feeling a headache coming on. “What are you two arguing about now?”
He scoffed, pushing the flaky thing away. “I haven’t fallen in love with Hermione, Ron. I’m not in love with
“Lily… Lily was fighting in a
“Welcome,” she said, voice light and cheery, as she tapped the chalk sharply against the board to dot the i’s in her name. “I am Professor Maria Wright, but please, feel free to call me Madame Maria. I am pleased to be here, at this honorable school, to teach you Defense Against the Dark Arts. As you could probably tell, I am from France, where I taught at Beauxbatons. However, please note that I will be gone for maternity leave starting some time in January.”
Harry blinked. “Dudley, if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you missed me.”
Anger roiled in his gut again, bubbling and wild. Harry thought Ron was his friend. But if the red head was willing to lie to him, maybe that wasn’t the case…
“I need to tell her about what happened during my Divination class.”
She stepped out, holding a hand high in the air. Ba’ul, familiar with the gesture, crawled across the roof of Hagrid’s hut, the wood creaking dangerously beneath his weight. Everyone instinctively took several steps back, even Greg backed away, more afraid of the head than he had been of the tail. Harry rolled his eyes, moving to stand next to Ron.
Welcome back everybody! It's been a while, but I have returned. New chapters will be posted every other Sunday, so keep an eye out for chapter seven
Frowning, Harry sat on the couch across from Draco’s chair, pulling out his potions essay. “Four for four? No, it’s only been three. Quirrell in first, Lockhart in second, and Barty Crouch Jr. last year.”
Head snapping up, Harry stared at his mother. Surely, this couldn’t be…
Harry couldn’t help it. He laughed, shaking his head. “Yeah. Yeah, I got a wand. How’d you even know wizards use wands? Your dad hates it so much, I thought you wouldn’t know a thing.”
The blond was perhaps the one he was closest with in Slytherin. After the events of second year, they had this sort of bond, with Draco confiding in Harry every now and then. It usually wasn’t anything big, save for Draco’s confession about still being afraid of Sila. He was also the only one who that always had faith that Harry wasn’t just a half blood tiny boy that got through things with dumb luck alone, and they always danced together at the Summer Gala.
They said goodbye soon after, so Harry and Derrick could head back to the house in time to welcome their mother home. Well, Derrick was more interested in getting back to his work. But their mother had gone out to take care of something for the Gala, but Harry wasn’t sure what exactly.
The normally mild mannered professor was instantly tense, her hands clutching at her sides. By now, Harry wasn’t the only one watching the interaction. “The Inner Eye does not see on command!”
“You really sure about this?” Jonathan asked as they walked up the walkway to the address he had found. “I mean, this is a big deal.”
But would she? Would she be alright? Or would she be in this bed until she passed? Would this image join Lily’s screams and that sickening flash of green the next time he ran into a Dementor?
Hopping up from the drawer, Harry slipped off the desk and down to the floor. He gave the cat that he came in with a little mewl of acknowledgement before he left. He hadn’t really found any of Umbridge’s plans, but it was to be expected. There just weren’t enough hours in the day to roam the castle in cat form while snooping on a Ministry official, but Harry supposed he hadn't come back with nothing. That quill, at the very least, was suspicious enough to warrant further investigation.
?!” When Vernon’s eyes jumped from Harry to Jonathan, his anger only grew, face turning a dark purple. “And
Once Harry was through the Floo, he was greeted by his mother. She smiled at him, pulling him out, and dusting him off. Dizzy was quick to come and take his trunk from him, welcoming him home, though she didn’t look at all pleased. He hoped it was because of the soot from the Floo, and not because she’d heard about Hermione’s SPEW effort.
“Go home,” his father said again, strained as he tried to keep his voice level. “You have to continue your training.”
Still, in practice…
“You’re right,” his mother hummed. “But I’m not talking about just Honavi and Nikoa. I’m talking about all of them. As you’re the only one who knows parseltongue at the school, they can be an outstanding help, gathering information for you. Or, if you can show them how to get around the castle, you can send a specific one to Ronald and Hermione to convey a message.”
,” Vernon hissed, his thick fingers balling into fists as his fat face was already turning purple. “What are
Not sure if anyone noticed, but until further notice, these chapters will be out once every other week, usually on Friday or Saturday. This may change, for anyone who's curious, due to my baby sister due at the end of the month! So things are getting kind of busy at home, and I might not have time to do nearly as much writing. Wish me luck!
“I will. I’m fairly confident in most of my classes. Transfiguration is probably going to be the hardest for me, and maybe Potions. But McGonagal is a great teacher and Derrick has helped me learn a lot of Potions skills that will help me in the exam.”
Another option would be the Shrieking Shack. It was secluded, not even on school grounds where Umbridge would be able to find them. And with the Shack’s reputation, thanks to Remus, no one would ask questions if strange sounds were coming from it. With all the rooms, they could even split into groups, have Ron help younger students, and Hermione and Harry could focus on the students their age. Still, there was the massive problem of how to get everyone there. They hadn’t started their Hogsmeade weekends yet, and wouldn’t until October. Not to mention, the only way they knew to get there in secret was the Whomping Willow. It was dangerous, and too many students going there at once would be far too suspicious.
“He won’t be in any trouble if you keep your voice down.” With a heavy sigh, Hermione rang her hands in the strap of her book bag. “Umbridge will do everything she can to stay, and the Minister will allow it. The way things are, we’ll be woefully unprepared. We need more than what Maria-”
Skyla and Mason had both noticed an unnatural rise of injured muggle borns in the last week alone, though for different reasons. Skyla, as a Mediwitch in training, was treating an odd amount of confused muggleborns who didn’t remember how or when they had gotten hurt. Mason, on the other hand, was finding Auror’s bringing children of suddenly deceased muggleborns to the orphanage. With no muggle relatives that knew of magic, or magical relatives to speak of, they were being sent to Pixie Orphanage. With so many confirmed muggle borns present there, Harry’s father promised to arrange for Mason to have more help, in case Voldemort decided to strike there.
Setting down the book, Harry instead pulled out a roll of parchment for ‘notes’ as Trelawney came out to begin the lesson. He was planning on starting on his essay for potions now that he had the free time. He could just ask Greengrass or Davis for the assignment, if he missed what it was, but for now he could focus on making a list of notes for key points in his essay. Others, however, began to whisper softly to others at their tables.
The redhead rose a sceptical brow.
By noon, all but Harry and his father had left. Derrick had gone home out of frustration, intending to use their large at home library to look for answers. Arrianna had gone to do the same, though at her own home in Diagon Alley. The others had wanted to help, but… There was likely nothing anyone could really do until she woke up.
He waited, eyes raking over his two friends to gauge their reactions. Blaise looked like he was going to laugh, like Harry had just made a joke that hadn’t quite landed. Draco, on the other hand, had his face scrunched in worry. His brow knit together so tightly it looked painful, lips pressed into a thin line, as his arms crossed his chest.
As a fair bit of the class sucked in sharp breaths, Umbridge simply rose a brow and wrote something down. “Right… Well if that’s the best you can do…”
Quinn nodded, using his wand to levitate their trunks for them as they continued on their way. “Yes. Mother has everyone coming to the house. This is a big deal, after all. Everyone’s having to take time off from work. I’ve even closed up shop for the day.”
Taking a deep breath, Harry walked up the little path that led to the door. He paused, taking a glance at the curb. There was no car parked there. Would they even be home?
“The chances of being attacked
Holding his hands up in mock surrender, Ron eyed Harry. “That’s not what I meant, mate. Just… Think about it, Harry. You’re always getting into trouble, one way or another. Maybe having someone else there to help in case you got into it with someone isn’t a bad thing?”
“I like parties,” Dudley said, looking almost hopeful. Clearly, his cousin was looking for Harry to extend an invitation, but Harry knew that he couldn’t ask him to come. It would be too dangerous, as they knew that there would definitely be Death Eaters there, who wouldn’t take kindly to a Muggles presence.
“Listen,” Harry said, keeping his voice calm. “If you wanna hang out sometime, I’m sure we can. But first, there’s something you need to know. About me, and my family.” He paused. “About your aunt, my mother.”
Harry, already familiar with the Horntail, easily ducked under Ba'uls tail to enter the hut. Freya was inside, finishing her breakfast and yawning. She spared Harry a glance as he put his dishes in the sink, before going to the still warm kettle to make another cup of tea. He had the feeling that he could get used to this.
With everyone who had something to say done, Harry looked at the table, losing himself in thought. He thought about what everyone had said, and tried to think of what the next step was. He supposed the only thing he could do was keep training and make sure that everyone who needed to be informed knew what was coming. As Harry thought about who wouldn’t have heard about Voldemort’s return, a few very specific people jumped to mind, who might not even know about magic. And he couldn’t help but wince at the very thought of explaining to them.
“You shouldn’t use ‘army’ to describe my family,” Harry said instead, keeping his voice low. “The Ministry wouldn’t like that.”
For a moment, Dudley stared. Harry almost thought he was going to laugh in his face. But his cousin just nodded. He didn’t laugh, or call Harry a liar. He just nodded.
starting political debates in the middle of a first lesson. Because I’m certain that you will not have a response for all the things that have happened in the last two years alone.”
With the danger gone, the brilliant, glowing stag turned to Harry. It bowed its head, the prongs of its antlers just barely reaching the ground before it vanished. For a minute, Harry could only stare at where it had been. He had cast a full patronus. He had
Goosebumps ran up Harry’s flesh as the air grew colder, his eyes widening. He knew this feeling… This feeling of dread, of cold unfeeling helplessness, as if all the joy of life had been drained away. But it couldn’t be right… He
“If you don’t figure it out by then, I’ll tell you and Hermione tomorrow during lunch. We’ll meet in the usual spot. You think you can tell Hermione?”
“Oh, don’t be such babies,” Freya groased, rolling her eyes as Ba’ul dropped to the ground beside her with a loud thump. “This is Ba’ul. And he’s as tame as a dragon can get.” She gently scratched at the softer patch of scales under Ba’ul’s chin. “He’s a bit special, since he’s the only dragon to have any sense of domesticity. This is due to a mix of imprinting and continued dependency after hatching.”
The toad’s office was… horrifying. It was all pink, with ceramic plates with cats hanging on every free inch of wall space. He grimaced at the sight, tail twitching nervously. Several of the plates meowed at him as he hopped up onto the desk, feeling a bit of satisfaction when his sharp claws poked holes into the pink cloth covering as he pulled himself up. It was even more satisfying when he heard her quill vase crash to the ground.
With a sigh, Harry went to his own bed, drawing his own curtains shut as he laid down.
Dudley perked up at that, and Harry was sure he was thinking about cake. He chuckled, shaking his head. He would likely just have Ron and Hermione over this year. They still didn’t know if they could trust the other Slytherin’s yet, and even if they could, it probably wouldn’t go over well to have them and Dudley in the same room.
Harry turned to watch Maria, as she heaved a sigh. She turned back to the board, flipping it over to write down the first revision subject. They’d be starting with what they learned in first year, all the way back with the first group of spells. It would be a sort of practical pre-test. Just to see if they still remembered. If they did well enough, they could start with a written quiz on Imps, to see if they needed a refresher course on them or could move on to Ghosts.
“Yes, you’re currently four for four on someone trying to kill you.”
Instantly, Harry tensed. “Bad? What’s bad?”
“Hem, hem.”
Clearing his throat, Harry lowered his hand. “If we’re doing only review, then does that mean we won’t be learning any new spells to defend ourselves?”
But this meeting today was too important to be put off until he had finished with the Mandrake leaf. And Harry would need to be in top form or this. He had Jonathan with him, afterall, and Harry didn’t want to end up wasting his time.
It was hard for Harry to not feel bad for Dudley, looking at him now. Sure, he had been a bully, but that was years ago. They had been children, not even ten. And now, Dudley was just a frustrated boy who didn’t know what to do with his anger. Really, Harry felt bad.
Ron coughed, looking at Harry with wide eyes. “Harry, you didn’t do anything stupid, right? I mean, you said we should be keeping our heads down. Messing with the toad during class is the
“The pain reliever,” she explained, holding tightly to her parchment. “She… Uh… When she came in, she was in a lot of pain. So she was given a few potions to lessen it, along with some dreamless sleep, but it seemed like she was refusing to let her eyes close.”
“No,” Harry said, sitting back against the planter. “No, Mum, it’s okay. I actually want to tell you about her. She… not all that dangerous. Actually, the only thing that made her attack people in second year was because she was being controlled by Tom Riddle's diary. And her eyes were clawed out by Dumbledore’s phoenix. She doesn’t have any interest in eating people, and Hagrid does a great job of keeping her fed. She even sort of sees me and my friends as her own…”
Harry got up from his moping couch to follow his mother to his room. She didn’t say anything at first, simply leading the way. Once they were there, she set down the cake box, and her basket, and moved to sit on the floor next to the planter box with the bush his snakes lived in. With a smile, she patted the floor in front of her.
There was a soft murmur as, one by one, the others began to stand. They were going clockwise around the table, with Moria standing to speak about the centaurs first. Apparently, they had seen the signs of a coming war, and had started asking Moria about it. She’d explained how Voldemort had returned, but that the Ministry of Magic were refusing to at the very least investigate. The centaurs agreed with Moria, though, and promised that when the time came, they would lend their aid.
“And the Slytherins?”
Before he could do anything rash, Jonathan finally took a step forward. Placing a reassuring hand of Harry’s shoulder, he gave a bit of a smile, before giving a bit of a nod off to the side. Frowning, Harry turned to follow the look, and his eyes met with Dudley’s. His cousin was staring at him, wide eyed, as if he had seen a ghost.
The toad faced woman reeled, looking almost like McGonagall had just slapped her. She didn’t speak again, as the professor demonstrated the vanishing spell, giving a few quick instructions to help those that struggled. Harry turned to look down at his snails, which inched around in their box. He felt bad about vanishing something that had done him no wrong, but he was a bit more interested in the conversation between Umbridge and McGonagall.
“We can talk about it later,” Harry said, smiling just a little. “When we get back to the house.”
“Merlin’s balls!” Harry shrieks, jerking up to fast he hits his head on one of the bed posts before tumbling over the side. “Greg, what the hell?!”
“Not at all.”
Harry took Draco’s face softly in his palms and looked deeply into his shoreline eyes before kissing him severely. Draco moaned unabashedly, a sound that went straight to Harry’s cock. He mouthed down along the blonde’s chin, stopping to nibble his ear before kissing softly along the column of Draco’s flushed throat. Harry noticed that his sweater seemed to hang off Draco’s shoulder, oversized on the blonde’s smaller form. Harry couldn’t help but nose along the exposed skin at his shoulder, breathing him in.
Draco stared up into the other boys’ eyes, unable to speak. He knew Harry was right, but it wasn’t as easy a choice as Harry was making it seem.
“Well, it’s technically the end of summer. I figured our agreement has expired, and so naturally you’d return to your normal broody self, yeah?”
“I…what’s going to happen, when we’re back at school?” Draco breathed it out in a huff, a whisper soft enough to make Draco question if he even spoke it aloud.
Both boys let out a soft laugh and pulled back to look at each other. Draco felt overcome in the moment, neither of them had dared to speak in great length about what being back at Hogwarts would like for them. He felt a certain reassurance that Harry’s best mates did in fact know about the two of them, and not just that they’d been fooling around all summer, but that…that Harry loved him. That sentiment alone must have had some weight to it. Surely, they couldn’t deign to pretend for an entire year, not when they weren’t even sure what their lives would look like a year from now.
Harry lazily yawned and arched his back as he awoke the following morning, surprisingly unstartled by the intricate knot their extremities had formed. Harry had grown used to waking up like this, practically curled up like a cat against Malfoy’s body. What he wasn’t used to was falling asleep in the other boy’s arms, because that would mean that they both consciously made the decision to willingly touch each other for a prolonged period of time, and Harry still wasn’t sure he was ready to face what that could mean.
Harry let out a laugh as well, before pulling Draco into his arms and burying his face in the crook of the blonde’s neck; his favorite place.
To be fair, the growing pain boiling in his gut was the least of what had Harry’s mind a flutter. Harry knew he was still reeling from the kiss, ughh no, the full-on snogging session they’d shared after breaking free from his idiotic cousin and his band of pricks. Harry ran his hands through his hair in frustration.
Draco thought for a moment, trailing his eyes over slowly to meet the headmaster’s, trying to think of where he was last before waking up in the infirmary. Suddenly, Draco was jolted with the memory of pain, severe pain in his abdomen and then his vision drowning in stark white before collapsing. “I remember passing out in Potion’s class, and then waking up here,” Draco finished looking back up at the white-haired professor with an inquisitive look. Dumbledore stared at Draco for a long moment before engaging professor Snape in a conversation of hushed deliberation. Not long after, Potter awoke and began demanding answers from everyone. It was then that Draco was brought up to speed on how he would be spending his summer.
“Harry, it’s time to wake up,” he whispered again, trailing kisses from his ear, across his jaw, and down his neck.
I know the ending is a little open-ended, but I have definitely thought of some sequel ideas, let me know if you'd be interested in seeing where this plot takes our boys next! :)
After a few moments he gets up the courage to peek his eyes open just to get a glimpse of boy wonder and gauge his reaction. Draco is of course met with green eyes peering back at him, dopey soft smile in place on the other boy’s lips making Draco’s face flush and his body warm. He decides to give in to his heart just a tiny bit, shut out the anxieties of his mind, and so he graces Potter with a soft dopey smile of his own. Potter’s eyes go bright and his soft smile turns to a grin, he squeezes Draco’s ankle and both boys close their eyes just savoring the moment of being there with one another, no thoughts in the way.
“I just,” Harry turned to face him at last, their faces just centimeters apart.
Harry’s mind was reeling, never had he imagined that Voldemort would take up residence at the Malfoy’s, of course, it did make sense, it was probably full of old and dark magic, enough to keep him concealed while he continued to develop his plans to ruin humanity as they all knew it. Harry’s heart ached and he felt the ache reverberate throughout his entire body, he wasn’t sure if the bond was allowing him to feel the pain that Malfoy felt, or if he just genuinely empathize with the other boy, he also endured nightmares of Voldemort as well, after all. Maybe it was both, he knew his feelings about the blonde had begun to alter as of late, and he knew that Malfoy was different, as insane as it was to wrap his head around.
“I won’t pretend to know how you must be feeling about going back to school tomorrow,” she said softly but, in a way, so abrupt that it had enraptured his entire attention. He flicked his eyes up and was met with a sincere brown eyed gaze.
“It would be so easy to say that I want things to stay like this all the time, and that I don’t give a fuck who knows about us…but…” This time Draco’s sigh was a bit more exasperated.
Harry held the long chain up and stared at the tiny green and silver dragon, a charm no larger than a Knut hanging from the end.
Draco was savoring every moment of pure bliss in the arms of the brunette. He held Harry in his limbs as if his life depended on it, raking a hand up through his dark messy sleep ridden hair and cradling his head, keeping him in place buried in the crook of his neck.
“Please what?” Harry teased sucking on the head of Draco’s cock through his pants.
As the quiet settled around the two of them as they lay nestled against Potter’s sheets, Draco could feel the bond like never before. Every limb entwined, every sliver of skin exposed, and every part of him somehow linked to the brunette seemed to entice a current within him that funneled warmth and euphoria to the rest of his body. He seemed almost unable to keep his mewling sighs at bay as prickles of pleasure seemed to plague him, making him draw the golden skinned boy closer to him. Draco closed his eyes and inhaled deeply as Potter’s scent surrounded him filling his mind up with flashes of their mornings together. Images of limbs entwined, body heat and warm gusts of breath, flashes and touches of soft skin, deep sighs, hard edges, and bright green eyes imparted with questions.
Potter didn’t answer, he turned, leaning his back against the tunnel wall, wrapping his arms around his stomach and Draco instantly understood.
Harry quirked up his lips in his own half-smile the one that seemed to be reserved entirely for Draco, and feigned interest in a plot that he had already missed too much of. He could feel the prickle of the bond where their hands were joined and took a deep breath to steady himself. He relaxed his hand against Draco’s, so their fingertips were pressed together and began lazily tracing the lines, creases, edges of the other boy’s hand with the tips of his fingers.
“Hey,” Harry almost didn’t hear him say it, it was so timid and faint, but Harry had heard it and turned to face the blonde, unsure if he was ready for what he’d find hidden in the other boy’s face.
“Me either,” Harry breathed resting his forehead against Draco’s again.
Their lips met in a frenzy, it had only been a few hours and they were already mad for each other.
After a few moments, that felt like eons, of fevered snogging they pulled away in desperate need of catching their breath.
Harry let out a laugh, “well I suppose if you’re up for the job…but I must warn you now, it will require a lot of strenuous snogging.”
Harry wonders what’s come over him as he exits the charms room and hurries to catch up with Ron and Hermione after class. He knows he’ll find them in the dining hall for lunch as Ron is nothing if not dedicated to meal times. Harry spends his walk wondering if breaching their reticent relationship with words was a mistake. It’s only that he finds a soothing comfort in knowing he can look up in the common room over to Malfoy’s nook and see him at ease absorbed into an alternate reality, or even look up into that corner only to find silver eyes gazing back at him and be reminded that some things never change.
“Hey…” he whispered into their small space, daring himself to open his eyes and face green.
In two short strides he crossed the room, and pulled the blonde into his arms, and down to his lips to meet in a burning kiss. Draco’s lack of hesitation was all Harry needed to know that it wasn’t the bond, couldn’t be the bond. Sure, they were in pain from the short separation, but they weren’t doubled over, they could still speak. If it had only been the bond surely there would have been a slight hesitation on Draco’s part, surely, they didn’t need to breath each other in like this to ease the pain of the bond. Yet, here they were molding together as if their lives depended on it, lips biting, breath heavy, hands searching.
“Morning Malfoy,” Potter greeted as he pulled two pieces of toast onto his plate and began lathering them with butter.
Not taking his eyes off of Harry’s, Malfoy continued, “he took up residence at the manor, and made himself at home. Each meal was concluded not with dessert, but with the torturing of some helpless muggle, or muggle-born. Sometimes the torturing took place because he needed something from them, some sort of information or token, but sometimes…sometimes, it was just because he could, because he took some sick pleasure in it.”
But Draco didn’t want to be cruel to Potter anymore, especially not when he had to spend the next two months in a tiny shoebox with him. His mind was whispering to him that he knew, the shoebox wasn’t the only reason he wanted to be himself with the other boy. Draco was pulled out of his inner struggle when he heard Potter let out a tiny snigger of laughter, a snigger of laughter at what Draco had said. His eyes shot back up to the meet the green of Potter’s and was graced with a half-smile of his own. There was another moment of silence, before Draco found the courage to speak again.
She smiled between the two boys, patted Draco’s cheek again softly for good measure, and then began making her rounds ensuring that everyone had everything they needed and then ushering everyone towards the train.
Draco didn’t know how to respond to Potter, so he stayed silent. He knew the other boy was right, they couldn’t be far from one another, and just the short distance from Madam Pomfrey’s office and Harry’s bed had been painful, he couldn’t imagine what sleeping down stairs for an entire night would accomplish. However, sleeping next to Potter in that miniscule bed was going to be a shit show. They would definitely touch, they would have to there was no way to not touch someone sharing that bed, and Draco was definitely afraid of how that could affect him long term.
Definitely, a lot going on in this chapter! Dying to know what you all think! I feel like it's been ages since I've updated though its only been a few days! <3
“You’ll have to share with the rest of us at dinner mate, those muggles really are fucking barmy, aren’t they?”
Harry’s lips twitched up, dimple on display, “I know, I know it’s going to be a lot and definitely a change from our time here. We’ll have to ease everyone into it, but trust me Draco, these are the kindest people I’ve ever met in my entire life. They will grow to see you the way I do and love you too…and if all else fails, remember what I said about Mrs. Weasley. If you win her over you’ve got nothing to worry about, everyone else will follow soon enough. Plus, that woman can cook like no other, we won’t have to starve up here or sneak down into the kitchen after everyone’s gone to bed. That woman will start feeding us as soon as we walk through the door.”
“Think we might be able to find a way back up to the bathroom?”
“Remember that morning, the morning in the hospital wing just after we’d found out that we’d been bonded, when Dumbledore and Severus pulled me into Pomfrey’s office?” Draco spoke in a rush, just wanting to get it all out and face Harry’s reaction. He waited for the brunette to nod his remembrance before continuing.
While it was incredibly amusing to watch Granger get lost in her own tangent, he felt his heart soften just a bit at the sight. He was hit with the notion that it must be incredibly hard for Hermione to be caught between Harry and Ron all the time. Draco could tell she loved Harry immensely, the two of them seemed to understand each other and care for one another deeply. It was a level of friendship that Draco hadn’t ever experienced. On the other hand, it was also incredibly clear that whether she was willing to admit it to herself, out loud, or to just anyone she was in love with Ron for reasons Draco was sure he’d never comprehend. Either way, it put her in a tough spot in times like these where the two boys were at odds. Draco felt overwhelmed with the desire to help, to ease this burden for her somehow, it was the least he could do after all.
Even with Malfoy right next to him the ache hadn’t fully waned, and while it wasn’t painful anymore it was still frustrating. Harry looked up at the headmaster with an inquiring look, why were both he and Snape there, surely professor Dumbledore was more than capable of delivering travel instructions and relaying the Dursley’s disapproving agreement on his own. It was a moment before professor Dumbledore spoke, choosing to give both boys an authentic look before starting, “It is clear that both of you are suffering the effects of the bond,” he paused again giving them each a look almost urging them to deny the accusation before continuing on again. “I understand how uncomfortable it can be to be apart from the person you are bonded with, so forgive me, both of you, for separating you. However, it had to be done. I will say this; it has been my experience that after a period of separation a bit of physical contact usually abides the pain you may be experiencing now.”
Draco let out a laugh, “Harry, let’s just get through this week before we make any decisions about school…I still have to win over your friends and from the looks of it, Weasley is not going to be easy.”
It wasn’t long before the brunette was groaning into Draco’s mouth and trying to press every inch of their bodies together, pulling Draco flush against him, only pulling back to look him in the eye as he raked his shirt up silently requesting it off.
Draco ran his fingers slowly down Harry’s cheek, and Harry could see the fondness in his gaze. Harry softened into the caress and closed his eyes.
Draco felt slightly more comforted by Harry’s sentiment. He trusted Harry and knew that he would have his back when they got to the Weasley’s. However, it didn’t stop the churning and twisting he felt in his gut at the reality that he was going into the home of several people who really did not like him at all. Of course, he couldn’t blame them. He knew he had been a bloody wanker to the entire Weasley clan, and that his father spent more time than was truly necessary making trouble for Mr. Weasley at work. He knew his week spent there would include a lot of effort to make amends, and selfishly he wished he could have spent just a little more time holed up on Privet Drive with Harry all to himself.
Draco eased his grip on Harry’s hair, and leaned back a little before fully flopping himself down onto the counter legs hanging off the sides keeping Harry bracketed in.
Which is why the fact that Malfoy appeared to have been dodging him all morning was turning that pleasant prickle into knots that multiplied in his gut. Harry didn’t see him in Charms class that afternoon, and he had dodged him at breakfast that morning making Harry begin to believe that Malfoy
“To get through the day,” he said as he pulled back Harry’s face cupped in his hands.
*****
Smut ahead, tread lightly if it's not your thing!
For a moment she looked up at him her face pleasantly shaken, though she quickly recovered. “That would be lovely dear, I’ll lead the way,” and so she marched him into the kitchen.
It wasn’t long before they were both practically begging for it, therefore, when Harry’s hand inched down to the seam of his pajama bottoms (the shirt had gone long ago), Draco couldn’t even bother to draw in a breath, instead letting out a brash unbidden moan at even the mere thought of Harry touching his cock. Lucky for him the brunette seemed to share his enthusiasm and began hungrily mouthing down Draco’s long pale throat as he inched his hand down the front of his bottoms.
Harry kicked Weasley in the shin and gave him a look, “they’re right Ron, it is a little strange. Already making holiday plans and the term has yet to start.”
I feel like I’m really rambling now, I’ve given you so much in this letter already. Just know that I haven’t been keeping all this from you because I don’t trust you, I just haven’t trusted myself. And now I really want to, and that’s probably why I’m writing this now. I want to be with him ‘Mione, I really do. And thank you for being the person to help me admit that to myself, even in letter form, and even if I haven’t gotten your response yet. Thank you for being you.
I hope you enjoy, I love all your comments, and kudos and I'll miss them when this story comes to a close!
“Draco,” Dumbledore spoke softly, drawing Draco’s gaze over to the headmaster. “Can you tell me what you remember?”
Draco could hear the tell-tale signs of footsteps, and the bedroom door opening, only to be promptly slammed closed again.
Harry returned the comment with a sheepish grin, stepping away from Draco, and into the warm embrace of the man who had been like a father to him, or least the uncle he should have had-slight towards Vernon intended fully.
3rd of course....of course, I LOVE all of your comments and kudos! I also just love you all in general, so thanks so much for all the love!! <3
, glancing,
Harry woke with a start to a tapping noise coming from the window. He groaned in pure frustration as he looked down at the blonde tangled in the sheets who was completely oblivious to their new obnoxious and unwelcome alarm clock.
However, before Draco could fill himself with enough courage to pry his eyes open Potter had slid his own hand up into Draco’s hair and was urging him back, and this time the meeting of their lips was anything but a mere brush. Their lips met with a fierce intensity, as if every fleeting touch, every long gaze, every unsaid word, and every feeling they’d had from the bond, and in Draco’s case from years of angry and unrequited love came gushing out in waves and was poured into their kiss.
Why would Snape go to all this trouble for him just for one measly summer; although the summer had been anything but measly, it had been incredible, but that was a thought better stored away at the given moment. Wasn’t the point of this summer to get him to see the light? Of course, breathless nights, hands down Potter’s jeans, eyes squeezed shut trying not to come in his own pants as the brunette panted breathy moans into his neck probably wasn’t how Severus had intended to sway him over to the resistance, Draco thought with almost an audible laugh.
Draco watched Harry get pulled into a conversation with Ginny, the youngest Weasley, and his eyes lured away. Draco looked around the table and felt incredibly taken with how easy everyone seemed. They all seemed so content and at ease in the company of one another, and that was something he hadn’t experienced anywhere other than Hogwarts. Dinners at the manor were nothing like this and were much quieter indeed.
Draco gazed up into green eyes and pulled the brunette a little closer to him on their shared cot. The prickle of the bond a soft undercurrent on the edge of his skin where they touched. “You know, I know I didn’t get you a birthday present. But I did pick something out for you in my mind, I just can’t get it until we’re in Diagon,” Draco whispered softly, and a little sheepishly.
“Talk to Hermione first, you’ve been the absolute worst to her anyways, so you owe it to her, and once you’ve made amends, she’s sure to have some advice for Ron.”
Before he could blink, Draco had paid for their meal with an, “honestly Potter, it’s your birthday.”
Let me know what you think!
Harry was hesitant to rupture the balance the two had seemed to contrive within the first couple of months at school, but he was even more eager for more. Harry knew he had to do something when he found himself spending much more time than he’d like to admit thinking about what Malfoy might be reading, or what he might think about in his spare time, or why he vanished off to his room every time their game became too much. His craving and his curiosity in the new relaxed Malfoy was stronger than his fear of tipping the balance on what they currently had, which Harry didn’t even truly know how to define.
“Neither of us know what we’re going back to. I know you haven’t even spoken with your parents all summer, or Snape for that matter. The last thing I want is to make anything harder on you than it has to be.”
After a few moments Draco pulled away, smile still in place because Harry just had that effect on him. He was absolutely certain no one at Hogwarts would even recognize him with the dopey smile on his face all the time, his ‘street cred’ would be completely null and void.
Despite the cozy atmosphere Draco felt immensely overwhelmed at the commotion of so many people in one space. Of course, Malfoy’s tended to have many large gatherings but none that were quite this lively.
Draco fisted his hand into Harry’s hair yanking his lips up to his and bit down on his bottom lip, and Harry came. Hard. He cried out and clung on to the boy above him losing himself and burying his face into his neck as Draco collapsed onto him in a sweaty and heaving heap, both boys gasping steadily for air out of breath.
There was a moment of silence, and Draco began to panic a little afraid that his trepidations would come to fruition.
Harry watched as Draco nodded in agreement, in understanding, and Harry almost felt some of the burden he’d been feeling all year lift from his shoulders a little bit.
At this Ron rolled his eyes, and decided it was now safe to enter the conversation, “Oi Harry, it means you and Malfoy can’t be apart from each other. You’re stuck with the prat all summer mate,” he finished with a sheepish look around as he received another pointed look from Hermione. “What? Someone had to be straight up with him, didn’t they? It would have taken you lot ten years to get on with it,” he finished with a roll of his eyes avoiding eye contact with Hermione this time.
Draco somehow found the will to drag himself off the sofa, and into the kitchen to wash his hands and politely ensure Mrs. Weasley didn’t need any last-minute help; knowing full well the lot outside playing Quidditch would take their time meandering back inside.
Harry let out a groan, as he met Draco’s gaze, “I’ve been thinking the same thing since you rolled on top of me,” Harry half laughed half groaned out through gritted teeth, and a soft half smile.
Harry rolled his eyes at the sentiment, and cringed a little as the bond kicked in. He knew Draco knew the limits of the bond, but to Harry it didn’t matter. He didn’t relish even the slightest bit of discomfort especially since the more uncomfortable it became the further Draco was away from him.
Just a couple of sweet chapters where both boys over analyze every thing, which is honestly something they're both very adept at!  <3
“Yeah, Malfoy, I could think of a few worse people to spend a birthday with.”
Draco didn’t think, he didn’t think, he lunged at Potter’s fat uncle, and without a second thought decked him square in the face. Potter’s aunt stood staring, mouth agape a silent shriek unable to escape, hands trembling, not even daring to speak or go to her husband.
The reality was that he knew his face had turned red as well and could only imagine the picture he and Draco made as they both faced Remus, who was sporting a look of fond amusement as he looked them over once more before continuing their descent down the stairs.
“I, well, I’ve known I’ve loved you for a little while now and you blurting it out yesterday sort of forced all those thoughts and feelings, I’d been having all summer to come pouring out. I wasn’t sure I could face them you know, like I wasn’t sure I was ready. I needed to sit down and sort them out properly, no shoving them off, just facing them head on. When I did Draco, I knew almost instantly how I felt.”
He watched as Potter’s cheeks flushed and knew the other boy had got the sentiment. “It’s getting dark, we better head back, if we’re lucky we can sneak upstairs without anyone taking notice, unless Dudley’s opened his fat mouth to my aunt and uncle.”
Hermione let out a sigh, “I told Harry that’s what he’d be hung up on, but who else knows besides me?”
“Great Malfoy, I’ll find you in the common room later, you choose the escape.” And just like that Potter, and his grin have slipped out of the door leaving Draco to contemplate exactly how he had gotten into this predicament in the first place.
“Friends then,” he said hand extended to shake Harry’s hand.
“Of course, you’re my best mate, that’s not changed has it?”
.” Draco’s head was thrown back, his eyes squeezed shut, his mouth hung open, and Harry thought he was fucking gorgeous.
Now he felt exasperated as he watched Draco’s blonde hair disappear into the crowd next to Hermione’s head of bushy curls. Harry had known they’d been up to something as he watched them clustered together, murmuring softly in the corner of the Weasley’s living room all night. Draco and Hermione becoming friends was probably going to be the death of them. The two wankers were much smarter than he and Ron combined; they wouldn’t stand a chance.
Harry contemplated for a moment, idly running his fingers through the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck making it completely impossible to focus on the conversation at hand.
Draco let himself flop back down onto the bed, eyes squeezed shut, fingers gripping the sheets. In the deep recesses of his soul he knew there wasn’t really an option. His mind was allowing him to believe that he truly had a choice between the dark and light, but he knew intuitively that the choice had already been made by his heart.
Harry shifted his head into his hands, rubbing his eyes and groaning to himself internally. “You don’t seem surprised,” Malfoy spoke inquisitively, tilting his head to the side, “happen often then?”
Draco’s fingers tightened against his scalp and he let out the faintest of whimpers before coming promptly down Harry’s throat.
With a small amount of renewed optimism, at least the optimism of completing this daunting task. Harry hastened out the door of 4 Privet Drive and circled around coming around to face his bedroom window. The ache of the bond was there but it had lessened the closer he got to his room where he knew Draco was still sleeping, unraveled out on his bed… Harry blinked himself back to the present.
“I just wanted to thank you Mr. Weasley, I know it couldn’t have been easy initially accepting me into your home, but I’m grateful that you did. I’m grateful to you both, very much, and – well, I just wanted you to know.” Draco extended his hand out to Mr. Weasley and looked up to be met with a smile. Mr. Weasley shook his hand firmly, “It was no trouble at all my boy, do take care of our Harry this year. I expect we’ll see you at Christmas.”
He didn’t think Pansy would dare approach him out in the open on the platform, especially without knowing the damage his absence had caused over the summer. For all he knew he was already an outcast within the pureblood community, and for the millionth time that summer he felt a surge of anger run through his veins at Severus keeping him in the dark.
Also, like I said before my Harry chapters are usually on the shorter side, writing Draco just flows but for some reason Harry doesn't come as naturally! I think this is why this fic has taken me so long! I promise the next chapter is a longer Draco! :)
Without a second thought, Harry yanked him by the front of his jumper into his arms. He immediately felt a large sense of relief as he pulled back only slightly to look into Draco’s gray eyes.
Draco nodded at her, “I’m grateful, thank you Hermione. I’ll wake him, we’ll be down in a few minutes I promise.”
Draco had been agonizing about it for days, he’d woken up the morning after Harry’s birthday immediately struck with the notion that he needed to be honest with the other boy, in terms of what he knew about the bond. They’d shared so much already, things they’d never allowed anyone else to see about themselves, so then why was it so hard for Draco to be honest with him about this, and the fact that it had a clear expiration date?
Well, we made it! Thank you so much to everyone who stuck with me during the lulls in writing and updating frequently. I appreciate everyone's love and feedback!
*****
He felt himself begin to flush, and his heart sped up. He’d let himself hope that maybe things would be alright. Maybe he’d really be able to start over, choose for himself. Before he could really let himself loose into the frenzy of his mind and how he’d ruined this for himself, Granger interrupted his thoughts.
“I’d like to say something,” and Harry turned to watch him, as he stopped in front of the table where they were all seated, chancing only one glance back at Harry before presuming on.
Harry was lost completely in the other boy, thinking that his wildest thoughts and fantasies couldn’t have dreamt up what it felt like to have Draco sucking and nipping on his lips. Harry was almost shaking from the pure intoxication of it all, and having Draco rolled up into his arms, sighing and moaning, and gasping at Harry’s every touch of his skin, every bite and suck of his lips, and every sound that he made. Everything he did seemed to spur Draco on which only encouraged him further, never once in his life had he ever thought he would come in his pants from snogging, and snogging Draco Malfoy at that,
A few members of the Order would be joining them on their outing, and so it had both boys just a bit on edge. With that being said, Draco was completely and utterly unwilling to let that prevent him from purchasing Harry a birthday gift. Therefore, he and Hermione had spent a good portion of the evening with their heads pressed together formulating a plan to separate Draco from
Now, however, he thought to himself, now he would be safe for a while longer even if it was tethered to Potter. He knew that for himself at least the experience would be uncomfortable, given his recent revelations but not as painful as he knew it would be for Potter. He knew that this was partially his own fault, he had given Potter plenty of ammunition to hate him, but he also knew it was partially due to Potter’s own hatred of what Draco symbolized and who he was the son of; Lucious Malfoy, deatheater and right hand supporter of the Dark Lord.
It was all fine until Draco walked out to breakfast sleepy eyed, hair rumpled, wearing one of his Weasley sweaters. Maroon with a golden “H,” Gryffindor colors. Harry stopped mid sip of coffee, opting to place the mug back on the counter instead.
This is it, this is the finale. I hope you enjoy! <3
After almost a week of trying to fit two people in a bed meant for half a person, dodging each other’s eyes in the morning, and avoiding Dudley’s homophobic sneers, Harry mused that he was starting to get used to having Draco around to his own shocked surprise. All three of the Dursley’s treated the other boy exactly as they treated Harry; as if he didn’t exist, and Harry noticed that this didn’t really seem to bother the blonde in the least. Harry often wondered if it was just because, well, who really wanted to be noticed by the Dursley’s anyways, or if it was more like a role Draco was used to filling in, and so he did, very neatly folding himself up and playing the part.
After a couple of weeks, Harry resolved it his mission to befriend Malfoy; a task that had Hermione rolling her eyes and Ron suggesting the hospital wing. Either way, it didn’t matter to Harry, it never had. There was something about the blonde haired, gray eyed boy that always kept him intrigued.
Harry watched as Draco’s gray eyes scanned the letter, his facial expressions giving nothing away other than the fact that he was deeply interested in what it had to say. After a few moments it was Harry’s turn to don the look of trepidation as he awaited Draco’s thoughts.
There are definitely a couple of 'plot twists' on the way in the next two chapters, this little heart to heart has definitely helped pave the way! :)
He moved his hand from Draco’s balls to the base of his cock, jerking up to meet his mouth as he continued to suck fervidly.
“I’m afraid of what might happen once we return to school, and you’re forced to choose between doing what’s right or standing beside your family.”
Harry pulled back a little, and eyed Draco for a moment before answering. And each moment felt like fucking torture, it was a feat trying to keep his own face impassive.
“You know Malfoy, you’re actually kind of hilarious. It’s going to be hard to get used to, but I could get used to it,” Harry spoke after he’d composed himself.
he thought to himself. Harry exhales, before raising his hand up and knocking on Draco’s door before he could dwell too much on what the consequences might be, thinking that the consequences wouldn’t really matter in the long run anyways so long as he could be in the same room as Malfoy.
Harry let out a long sigh, he needed to face it. The time for hiding away was dwindling fast, with one last long look at the loops of her neat script he began to slowly unfold her letter and read.
“I swear, you and this bloody Quidditch pitch Potter,” Draco said with a huff but harry could hear the fondness nestled into his tone.
Draco watched has Harry brightened instantly at his admonishment.
“Let’s just test out the bond at dinner, if it’s too painful we’ll figure out who to go to then yeah?”
He’d known that facing his Slytherin housemates would be difficult, especially as he was out of practice in his stoicism. However, he really hadn’t put as much thought or anxiety into what sort of rumors might have spread about him in his absence. He tried to calm his quelling nerves, knowing that Pansy was sure to at the very least fill him in once they’d made it back to the dorms, void of prying or inquisitive eyes.
relaxed his thigh and left it flush against Malfoy’s. Harry couldn’t deny how drawn to Malfoy he actually was, and he was honestly way past disagreeing with the idea. And if he was being truly honest, he had been craving some sort of physical contact for a while now and he just couldn’t stop himself. Harry knew his face was beginning to flush in pleasure at the thought that Malfoy hadn’t flinched away from him.
He grumbled as Fred continued to pull him into the shop.
Draco heard the knock on his door and knew instantly that it was Potter. No one else had dared to come looking for him all of term, it wasn’t difficult to deduce who it might be. It wasn’t that he had been avoiding the other boy all day so much as it was that he was trying to gain some perspective which was hard to do in the presence of Harry Potter; golden, wonder boy and savior of the wizarding world. So yes, I guess one could say that he was dodging the other boy, but only a bit. Draco bit his lip, before he stood up contemplating whether or not to pretend, he wasn’t there, but the pull to be near Potter was stronger than the inner scrutiny of what that meant.
He pried his eyes open, and looked up into those stark green eyes, and gray met green. Draco was so fucking gone, he couldn’t look away, Harry had pulled him in and locked him away in those emerald eyes. It was this that had Draco so intoxicated with lust, sure Harry was fit he was so incredibly handsome, the hottest bloke he’d ever laid his eyes on truly. But it was this energy that surged between them, this passion that truly drove Draco to the edge, and he knew it wasn’t just the bond it was everything they were. All their shared history, their rivalry, their inner-selves, their shared lives, this summer, all of these things were what made this chemistry so intense, it was what drew them to one another so forcefully.
Harry watched Draco’s eyes widen in surprise, “no you didn’t, let me see,” and Draco was once again reaching for Harry’s flies with resolve.
Harry moved his hands down along the blonde’s spine covered by Harry’s sweater. He stopped at Draco’s hips and boldly scooped the boy up and gently placed him on their kitchen island, stepping into the space between the blonde’s pale thighs.
(See the end of the chapter for
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Harry was dazed by the revelation that he was now privy to the reason Malfoy was so different, he had seen things that most people would go an entire lifetime without witnessing, let alone be a part of. Harry knew that this linked them together, even Ron and Hermione had not witnessed Voldemort in the flesh, they’d not experienced the pure and utter terror of watching someone die, or be tortured at the hands of someone while knowing that there was absolutely nothing you could do, but Malfoy did. Malfoy knew and he was just as disgusted by it as Harry was, which is why Harry felt safe enough to comfort Malfoy in the only way he knew how.
True to his word, Draco had yanked Harry out of bed the following morning and dragged him into town in celebration of his birthday. Although, to be fair, he hadn’t yanked him out of bed until he had been well and properly snogged ‘good morning.’
“Yeah, yeah we’re all happy for them. But we’re all not happy to have to climb over them spooning in the middle of their bedroom floor, are we? No, we’re not.” Ron huffed out folding his arms across his chest like a petulant child who hadn’t gotten his way.
Alright here we go, were definitely on the precipice of a big change....and sadly we're definitely getting nearer to the end!
Draco felt his smile falter, and his stomach cringe as Mrs. Weasley set her sights on him, her smile only wavering a moment before it perked right back up.
The last thing Harry wanted to do was put his two best mates in a difficult position, but he also couldn’t deny how he felt about the blonde. He was in over his head, overtly fond of the other boy. The bottom line was that Harry was completely unwilling to let him go, and that was what made him terrified to open Hermione’s letter. What if she asked him to?
“Of course not, if this, if I can be some of the reason you don’t have to become a death eater then I’m glad this happened. It doesn’t matter how shitty you’ve been in the past, and it sounds like you’ve been more than punished for how awful you’ve been. We’re children if you think about it, these are supposed to be our prime years spent figuring out who we are, who we want to be. We aren’t meant to spend them fighting a war against a dictator, yet, here we are.”
Love, comments, feedback, kudos, likes & dislikes are all absolutely adored by me! Love you guys!! <3
“Let me…”
Draco’s mind was a cloudy haze, filled with nothing except dark hair and green eyes, and Harry, just Harry. He knew that he was giving everything he had to the other boy, pouring all the confusion and desire he felt towards him into their kiss. Draco knew he was allowing himself to be in the moment with Harry fully, and to the extent where he couldn’t seem to control the murmuring, whimpering sounds he was allowing to escape his lips as wonder boy kissed him with abandon. Draco felt that it was terrifying and enamoring all at once, and he still didn’t know what it all meant just that he didn’t want it to end.
He let himself fall back against their cot, reaching to pull Harry with him not caring in the slightest about their mess. He wanted to lay there and bask in it all, in everything Harry had said with his body, in his movements. By letting his guard down he’d released so many wordless admissions and Draco felt privileged to be on the receiving end, especially when he still felt so unworthy when it came to the brunette; he’d made so many poor decisions thus far.
They’d existed in a bubble all summer, just the two of them, not even the Dursley’s acknowledged them anymore. What would life outside Privet Drive be like with Draco, what could having a life outside of their summer and their tunnel mean about Harry?
Draco was drawn away from his thoughts by Harry, he could feel his gaze. He lifted his eyes, searching for green and was pulled to him almost instantly. Their eyes met, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat, the deep longing he felt enveloped around him like a snug blanket making him feel warm but also trapped. But fuck if he didn’t want to be trapped there for the rest of eternity.
But no, instead, the brunette let out a barely audible groan into Draco’s neck, eliciting goose bumps to break out and scatter all over his pale skin, and Potter leaned into the ministrations of his hands, astonishing the blonde even more.
. No matter how sweet, Draco couldn’t shake it.
All of your comments have kept me going, I have been reading and editing and adding all weekend which makes me excited to finish this story for you guys! <3
Harry, Draco, and the Dursley’s were all vastly silent, not even daring to make eye contact with one another.
I know my last few updates have been spaced far apart! I've been writing a lot the last two days I've been off, and I am off this weekend and fully intend to write and post at least one or two more chapters this weekend!!
He knew he was partially triggered when seeing Potter harmed because of his unrequited feelings towards the honey-skinned, green-eyed, raven-haired boy, but he also knew it was because he was reminded of himself in that moment and all the times he wished he’d had someone there to take up for him; all the times he’d wished his mother would take up for him.
“I know already I won’t be good at not touching you, ‘Mione has been snapping at me the last two days, I’m terrible, truly. I’m sorry in advance for being the one to blow our cover.”
He watched Draco look down at his sweater and couldn’t look away as a pink flush spread across the blonde’s pale cheeks.
He longed for that laugh now, he longed for Draco’s long slender fingers to wrap around his to feel their softness. He longed for gray eyes especially when the gray was laced with emotion; surprise, arrogance, sincerity, desire…
Although, Draco couldn’t find it in himself to complain for long because after the lights turned out and Weasley’s snores filled the small room he heard the soft rustle of sheets, and was graced with the warmth of Harry’s skin over his as the brunette slid down from his bed, to curl up with Draco on the floor.
So, Draco turned to books. The manor of course had an extensive library, which gave him the initial inspiration for his quest for escape. Of course, the manor library had more informational texts on ancient magic, and artifacts than actual novels, which led him to the muggle library where his journey really took off. He found himself reading through several books in a week, it became his one solace, it helped to calm him, and it taught him a lot about himself and the kind of person he wanted to be. Naturally, the coping mechanism of escape followed him to Hogwarts as his collection of worlds steadily grew, and now he needed to choose a world to share with Potter.
Harry was yanking on Draco’s hair almost painfully as he brought Draco out from the safety of Harry’s neck and rested his forehead against his own, looking into his eyes. Neither of them said anything, they just looked at each other breathing heavily, their eyes saying everything they couldn’t in that moment as they touched and rubbed against each other. “
As much as he would have loved to draw it out, drive Draco mad, he knew they didn’t have the time and if he wanted this it would have to be quick.
Harry began to realize that during his moment of inner contemplation he hadn’t even been pretending to read properly. He hadn’t even turned a page since he sat down, he had simply opened the novel and stared off into the page in a complete daze. He was afraid to look up at Malfoy, afraid that he might be looking over at him in confusion and even more afraid that he hadn’t looked over at all. Although, when he thought about that he reflected on the fact that Malfoy hadn’t pulled his knees back up to his chest in an outraged huff or told him off in any way. In fact, Malfoy had left his feet right where Harry had placed them and had hardly moved an inch.
“We’ll figure it out okay. You have us here, and we’ll figure it out together.”
As he watched Harry throw his head back in laughter, he couldn’t help but grin. He began to feel a little less anxious as before. Sure, he still had a ways to go. He needed to speak with Hermione, and Ron, and possibly several other Weasley’s, but he knew he had won over Mrs. Weasley, at least a little bit and he felt keen to let himself have that small victory.
Very gently he turned on his side to face the brunette, “Harry” he tried, lips pressed to his ear.
And Draco knew he was referring to love. He had admitted to Harry that he was in love with him, and he was just now realizing that the brunette had not acknowledged it until now.
“No, thank you. Seriously Hermione.”
“Whether we like it or not a war is coming, we’ve talked about it before towards the start of the summer. You know it’s true Draco, that’s why you’re here after all, isn’t it?”
When their eyes met again, Draco was taken aback with the desire he saw embedded in the other boy’s eyes, it made his breath hitch. “Harry,” he whispered, not a question, but a statement, one that conveyed a similar sentiment.
Draco peered at Potter with his usual arched brow inviting Potter to explain his unexpected presence.
I'm so sorry it has taken me so long to update! Life takes over, and my job is so...it just makes it impossible to get much writing in some times!! Either way, I hope you liked it!
Harry barely acknowledged the movement, moving only slightly to better entwine their legs and burrow even further into the crook of Draco’s neck. In turn, Draco rested his cheek on top of the brunette’s unruly head; breathing him in while running his hand through the strands of hair at the nape of Harry’s neck.
He wasn’t used to sleeping so far away from Harry, not that he was entirely far, it weren’t as if this room was much bigger than the one, they’d shared in Surrey, but they weren’t pressed together. Their limbs were untwined, their skin untouched, their breaths unmingled.
Slowly, and with purpose, because if Draco was going to take a leap of faith and give into his heart’s desires he wasn’t going to rush, slowly, so slowly, he pushed his fingers up through Potter’s damp hair. Again, Draco was startled a bit when Potter didn’t immediately flinch away screaming at him for having the audacity to think that Potter could ever want to be touched by someone like him.
Malfoy tried, he really did try to remain focused on his own escape from reality, but the temptation to look at Potter’s reactions were too strong. He tried to causally lift his gaze from the page of his book to glance at Potter and was met with a sight that left him feeling bewildered in a way he really couldn’t understand. Potter’s eyes were wide, his grip on the book in his lap was tight, and he was gnawing on his bottom lip as if his life depended on it. Draco looked down at Potter’s book and noticed that he had read quite a bit already and then hastily wondered what time it was, and how long he had spent trying to talk himself out of looking up at Potter.
Draco let out a genuine laugh, before unfolding his arms and reaching into his pocket for the small box he’d had hidden there all evening; burning a hole in his pocket so to speak.
“I promise! Cross my heart, I will talk to him. Look, if I don’t talk to him soon, I may never be left alone with Draco, and trust me that is not something I can go without. I’m utterly fucked when it comes to him Mione’.”
I think there will probably just be 2 more chapters left, maybe 3! So at the very least we're nearing the end!
Draco wasn’t sure he could bear the idea of Harry hating him once more, not now, not after their summer. He also knew he couldn’t lie to him, not after the night they’d spent lips close, eyes searching as they’d whispered about what would happen if the bond never faded. Draco knew his fear was rooted in the notion that once the bond faded, Harry’s feelings for him would change, or even worse; he never had any feelings at all. His heart always ached at the thought and tried to reason that no bond could elicit what the two boys had grown over the past month, even now, the constant prickles when they touched seemed to be background noise to what touching Harry really felt like, he didn’t know for sure if Harry felt the same but he had grown to hope that he did.
“What is it,” he asked gently coming around to sit next to him on the edge of Draco’s trunk.
And even if he wasn’t forced to face them during the day, he was forced to face them in the night when his mind took over. His subconscious found it fit to either force him to relive his worst nightmares at the manor or coerce him to live out his deepest fantasies, and there did not seem to be a middle ground. While sleeping next to Harry should have made this even more mortifying than it already was, it seemed the other boy had his own demons to contend with. Often Harry would cry out in the night plagued with nightmares that covered him in a sheen of sweat and jolted Draco from sleep. However, more often than not the two would wake each other, pulling them from their nightmares and huddling them together. On the first night they were keen to convince themselves as much as each other that it was the bond that pulled them together after the nightmares but had vowed to keep it just between them. The rapture of touch the bond elicited lulling them both back to sleep as their sides pressed together and fingers grazed each other. This made Draco both dread and long for night to come, he mused that while it seemed as if he and Potter were touchy feely already; again something they had concluded a side effect of the bond, the night paved way for accidental touches that each boy could brush off as being due to the lack of space their sleeping quarters provided, but made it hard to face one another in the morning without turning red in the face.
Draco watched eyes wide as Harry’s eyes closed, and a dopey smile graced his face. After a moment the brunette’s eyes fluttered back open, and he graced Draco with a look so fond that it made his heart speed up and his cheeks flush all over again.
“Hermione we’re a group of red heads how hard did you think it would be?”
“I love you,” Harry blurted out into the open air in front of them as they laid there, legs entwined both facing towards the ceiling that Draco had let himself get lost in only moments before Harry had returned.

“How’d you know,” he asked, a small half-grin poised on his soft lips.
. Yes, he was gorgeous any day; coming home from a long day at work clothes rumpled and eyes tired, lounging on their sofa with a book eyes focused and lip nestled between his teeth in thought, and sleep rumpled as he was now. Only now, his cheeks were flushed, his lips a deep red, and his eyes wide fixated on him.
Harry led them to the stop for the bus, and they fell back into quiet step with one another.
Draco had yet to find time that evening to speak with Ron, who was still actively avoiding him which definitely made it more difficult. He had however, found time after dinner to corner Hermione and enlist her help.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I understand, Potter,” Draco confessed, “I haven’t talked to anyone about it either. Who would I even tell, my overzealous father, my dutiful mother, one of the several death-eaters inhabiting my home? No one would understand it, everyone I know, everyone I’ve grown up with, or in my family supports Voldemort in all his tyranny and they expect me to do the same. The truth is, that I knew this summer I was going to be forced to take the dark mark by my father, and I was horrified.”
Draco honestly didn’t know how much longer he was going to last. It felt like every single shoulder brush, and lingering touch from the last few weeks had built up to this moment and now he was a tingling mess, and he felt like an overworked school boy who was about to come in his fucking pants, and from snogging, no less.
“Where are we going,” Draco whispered anxiously once they were outside.
However, before the headmaster could speak, Harry found his voice, “Hold on, has anyone even tested this? Have you even tried to separate us, to see what happens?” Harry asked in a grumble, looking between the four people circled around his bed.
“Really well actually, much better than I ever thought.”
“You stupid git, you honestly think a little bonding spell would be enough to bring two former enemies together like this?” Harry emphasized his point by running his fingers through Draco’s hair.
Harry smiled warmly at her, “Of course, I’ve missed your cooking.”
“Yeah?” Draco spoke, he wasn’t confident he could really say anything else quite as steadily. “Yeah.” Harry spoke, and gazed at him eyes filled with the same emotions that filled Draco’s. “I don’t want to have the same ending as that story, I don’t want you to leave Draco.”
Draco was lulled awake by the faint whisper of voices. Before he could be tempted to open his eyes in search of the source he remembered where he was and dared to feign sleep a little longer as the voices became a bit more clear.
“And I saw how you were with Mrs. Weasley, and everyone else here, I know that couldn’t have been easy for you. I can’t imagine this is what it’s like for you when you go home to your family during the summer holidays…Harry has made it clear to me several times that this change wasn’t just because of him, or how you felt. And observing you now, I know he’s right. It’s always been there, and you don’t have to read me your list I can’t even imagine what it must have been like for you growing up the way you have. I won’t try that’s not my place, but I wanted you to know that I see you. I understand to a certain point, and I accept your apology.”
Draco licked his lips in anticipation, sure he had never done this before, but he had fantasized about going down on Harry enough times that he was sure his imagination wouldn’t fail him in this moment.
Draco perked up and met her eyes and she leaned over and placed her hand over his.
“Hey,” Harry said, pulling Draco’s gaze back up to drown in green, “we’ll manage,” he finished with a soft smile and fingers trailing down his pale cheek.
Draco let out a fond laugh, “Pleased with yourself Potter?”
We're maybe half-way through at this point! Let me know what you think!
Potter, without hesitation grasped Draco’s hand firmly in his own. They could both instantly feel the prickle of the bond thrumming beneath their palms, their fingertips, “It’s not enough,” Potter timidly spoke, and gray met green.
He felt Malfoy stir beside him, his arm draped across Harry’s side in a loose embrace. Harry stilled suddenly as the blonde slid his knee up ever so slightly and grazed the very prominent erection tenting Harry’s pajama bottoms. He took in a sharp breath, his face heating as he eyed Malfoy’s sleeping form willing him to stay asleep long enough to ease his way out of the other boy’s hold. This was their battle every single morning, they could never meet one another’s eyes, and though Harry tried to reason that it was only nature, and therefore, they really had nothing to be ashamed of he knew his rationale was mute, simply because nature wasn’t the only thing that made him hard in the morning time; it was Malfoy and all his smooth pale skin, hard lines, and warmth.
Harry, he needed Harry. He needed the distraction of warm skin, to bury his face in the crook of the other boy’s neck and breathe in; it’d been working thus far, why not now?
Harry extended his fingers around Draco’s wrist and trailed them down to link with his own.
The fact that Draco had just watched someone be physically abused over something they couldn’t control infuriated him, and it was in that moment he thought of Hermione Granger and all the pain he had probably personally caused her over something she had no control over, he thought of all the Hermione Grangers’ he had personally caused pain to and was hit with a wave of immense guilt.
“Are you serious, her before me?”
“Yeah?” Harry watched as Malfoy’s lips inched up into an earnest half-smile and quirked his head in interest, as if Harry’s birthday was particularly interesting.
It was in these moments Draco battled with himself about the fact that everything and nothing seemed to be different between the two of them. They touched more, both innocently and deviously, but never spoke about it. The most confusing part about it all was that while they never spoke about what was happening between them, they seemed to divulge more and more of their inner selves, things Draco was willing to bet that Harry had never spoken aloud, not even to himself. Whether it was the bond, their overwhelming hormones, their complete lack of self-control, their undeniable fondness for one another, or an alarming combination of all of the above Draco couldn’t be sure.
Harry gave Draco one long look before glancing back to make sure they still held the Dursley’s attention, when he was confident they did, he pulled the blonde into his arms and kissed him deeply.
Draco let out a little laugh, “Of course, Harry Potter would be overtly gracious in all things, even what I’ve clearly messed up here.” He leaned his head on the brunette’s shoulder feeling much more relieved.
Harry still battled with the idea that this version of Malfoy, the one who seemed like a decent human being, the one who sometimes made him laugh, and the one who sometimes made him question everything he ever thought about the world was eventually going to curse him and admit that he’d been fooling him all along laughing as he flounced his posh arse all the way back to Voldemort so they could laugh together over how ridiculous Harry was.
He was yanked from his thoughts by soft pale skin grazing his arm, the prickle of the bond coming to life at the other boy’s touch. Both boys had been lazily lounging in the grass hidden away in one of Harry’s secret spots, spending their time staring up at the clouds, chatting about nothing here and there.
Draco sat up and ran his hands through his hair and dragged them down over his eyes before he turned to look down at the boy next to him. His eyes were met with bronze skin covered in a sheen of sweat, messy dark hair strewn about against the pillow, and flailing arms and limbs. Draco’s eyes widened at the sight of Potter’s hair matted against his forehead, whispering laments as he tossed and turned, he felt his heart constrict as he watched not knowing how to comfort the tormented boy in front of him.
Draco cleared his throat and glanced up at Harry only to quickly glance away again blush blooming a deeper shade of rose.
He squeezed his eyes closed in an effort to clear his mind, but promptly snapped them open as he heard a loud, “HEY!” yelled out from a short distance away, he audibly groaned and heard Potter do the same from beside him, they both knew who that cutting voice belonged to.
They’d only been able to latch on to one another for a few brief moments before it seemed the rest of the Weasley clan decided to stomp up the stairs to bed as well, much to both of their disappointment.
Though, within seconds Potter had twisted himself somewhat free, and Draco jumped into action Dudley forgotten as he watched Potter try and twist his arm free, yanking Dudley’s cohort by the front of his shirt, he put his right-hook to good use for the second time that summer and decked him square in the face. Before he had time to process the course of events, Potter had him by the wrist and was dragging him away from the three boys as it began to rain is torrents.
I love you all, hope you enjoy!! <3
Draco had spent many moments, as many moments as Harry would spare him thinking about what to get the other boy for his birthday. He wanted to make Harry feel special, he knew their time was growing more succinct and neither boy knew what was going to happen when the summer ended. No matter what happened when they returned to school in a few short weeks, Draco wanted them to have this, he needed this.
Potter had moved both hands to Draco’s face and was holding him, cradling his face between his palms as if his life depended on it, kissing him as if he were air and he need Draco’s lips purely for survival. Draco dragged his hands down Potter’s body, pulling him into his own body, craving his touch, but soon discovering it was more useful to push the brunette back, towards the wall of their tunnel, pressing him into it, tugging his bottom lip with his teeth as his back hit the wall.
At that, they were all summoned to the dining room for dinner by the shrill, but pleasant voice of Molly Weasley. Harry jumped up, anxious to check on Draco and all Hermione could do was laugh as she followed him.
Never afraid of a challenge, but more importantly, never willing to pass up one of the opportunities to be near the other boy in these small ways, Draco extended his hand out to Potter, as he had done on their first night holed up in Potter’s room, as he had done in the hospital wing at Hogwarts just one month ago, and as he had done that day in Madam Malkins shop all those years ago.
This, however, was like dinner in the great hall of Hogwarts times ten, times a thousand really. All of the chaos, the chatter, and the excitement of finishing up a school day seated around your best mates as everyone passed food around and talked over one another had nothing on the utter pandemonium that was the Weasley clan.
In that moment neither of them needed words. They knew, Draco knew deep down that even if Harry hadn’t said it explicitly, he loved Draco. The thought alone had his heart beating madly inside his chest, and his breathing coming out in pants. It all felt like so much, the bond was prickling underneath his skin, deep inside his veins and the fact that he was already so irrevocably in love with the boy tucked away in his arms had him feeling as if on the edge of a cliff, but damn he wanted to fucking jump.
Truly, Draco didn’t know how to feel. After an incredibly long and exhausting year spent primarily inside his own mind while trying to act as if everything were normal on the outside, and anxiously awaiting his return home to where Voldemort had taken up residence, he was unsure if he was safe to feel even slightly relieved. He was magically bonded to Potter for shits sake, surely at the reality of this alone he wasn’t entitled to feeling even slightly calmed at the thought of extending his vacation from the Dark Lord for another two months. Yet, with everything else plaguing Draco’s mind and inner anxieties, this seemed the least taxing. ‘Oh, let’s be honest Draco, shall we?’ he thought to himself, ‘It’s not as if I can con myself pretending to hate Potter, might as well save it for everyone else.’ Draco huffed out a strangled sigh and put his face in his hands for a moment then dragged them over his eyes and up through his hair before slinging them back down onto the bed.
“Oh,” Harry sighed. “I may have slipped last night about… my godfather? Now Greg’s supposed to follow me around all day because I ‘can’t be trusted alone’.”
“Umbridge was there for Trelawney’s inspection.”
XxXXxX
“Probably should,” Harry mused, tilting his head in thought as he looked over the bush to spot out the different snakes. “Honavi and Nikoa were a really big help in the maze, and I could probably use their help again.”
Harry took a moment to look the small building over. Their house itself wasn’t that much different after their move. Two stories, brown brick outer walls, but much slimmer. The garden was less pristine here as well. Perhaps from the owner not having enough time to care for it. That didn’t surprise Harry, though the choice of Enfield was a bit of a shock. After all, the town was a bit famous for its supposed poltergeist, not even twenty years ago. For a family who hated anything strange or abnormal, they sure chose quite the town to move to.
the very idea. Harry did enjoy his privacy, and having someone always looking over his shoulder was the most unnerving thing Harry had to deal with. He made a mental note to redouble his efforts to shake Greg off his tail later.
Harry couldn’t help but feel ashamed. He hadn’t meant to make Draco feel that way, he just hadn’t been feeling up to talking to… anyone. There was so much going on, from his mother’s condition to Voldemort being back to Umbridge and the Ministry, that he almost didn’t know what he was doing anymore. He was being pulled in so many directions, it felt like his head was going to explode from the stress, and he had started to notice that he was becoming quick to anger.
Perhaps another day…
“You go by Harrison now,” Dudley said instead, almost making Harry jump.
“I’m sure you’ll do just as great as Lily did.” She took a quick drink of her tea, and cleared her throat. “Anything interesting happen recently? I know you’re preparing for this…” For a moment, Petunia trailed off. After a moment, she huffed. “Well, I certainly hope you are taking the time to take care of yourself.”
“Vernon,” Petunia said quickly. She stood, reached out in an attempt at a calming gesture. “Vernon, please. He just came to talk.”
As they got closer to Harry’s little corner of the classroom, he flipped through the divination book, finding the sections for moonstones and potions. He jotted them down, just in case, before turning back to his list of things for his essay.
It was still hard to talk about the other Slytherin’s. It was killing him, not knowing if he could still trust them or not. He was sure that Blaise would side with him, they were fairly close after all. And Theo got along well with Hermione and had hinted at his dislike of his father. Crabbe and Goyle, while Harry wasn’t close with them personally, knew they would follow whoever was in charge in their year. Which brought him full circle, back to Draco…
(See the end of the chapter for
Next to him, Sirius grinned. “
As Harry followed Petunia, he glanced around the room. Rather then an entryway, the front door led straight into the living room, which was also connected quite clearly with the dining room. To Harry’s photos of the Dursley’s hung carefully on the walls. They were all from before Vernon had been sent to jail, and Harry wasn’t in a single one. He guessed some things never changed.
Slowly, Harry’s mother nodded. “We’ll be here for you as much as we can, dear. You’re family, after all.”
Everyone froze. Slowly, four sets of eyes slid to Petunia. She was scowling, practically glaring, at her husband. Her lips were pressed into a thin line, brow pulled tight together. She looked so stern, and Harry almost worried she’d pop a blood vessel. He’d never heard her shout at anyone like that, other than, well,
of keeping your head down.”
“You’ve got a point. But you also had a point earlier. It’s not like we’d be allowed to do this all in the open, and it would be hard to hide that many students.” Ron huffed a sigh of his own. “If we can’t figure out where or how, then we won’t get anywhere.”
When Harry entered, everyone looked up. Calmly, Arianna sent Joseph and Jameson away with Tikki to go play out in the garden as everyone took their seats. His mother carefully to her seat to his father’s right, leaving Harry to take the seat across from her, at his father’s left. Sirius took the empty seat next to him, with Marrissa a bit down the table next to her father, and Quinn sitting at the far end with Milla and Hester on either side. Only one seat remained open, now, a single chair across from Sirius, between Harry’s mother and his brother Derrick.
“Dudley,” Harry said, his eyes locked on a figure in the distance. “Run.”
“I fell asleep while working on my moonstone potions essay,” he lied easily. “I dreamt that I had made a Drought of Peace, only for it to turn into poison and a moonstone.”
He shrugged, taking another sip from his cup. Petunia hummed, lips still pursed.
“Maria’s a great teacher,” he said, as if to ease Harry into the bad news. “But she said that we’re only going to be doing review. For now. Hermione was complaining about it this morning, says it might have to do with… You know, the Ministry.”
The room fell absolutely silent. Slowly, Umbridge turned, eyes narrowed. “Excuse me?”
,” he said.
There was the Forbidden Forest. It was large, and it certainly had the space. They wouldn’t have to worry about anyone needing a key or password to get in, or one of the members misplacing theirs where Umbridge could find. Plus, the length between campus and the forest was large enough that they didn’t need to worry about a large group having to enter all at once. But the forest was dangerous. While Harry had only met Firenze, the other centaurs certainly wouldn’t like a bunch of students stomping around their territory. Not to mention that they didn’t know just what else was in there.
“Oh Harry, let me look at you.” Draco watched, an amused smile in place as Mrs. Weasley held Harry out at arm’s length, assessing his wellbeing.
Harry watched as Draco’s face lit up with a grin, making it clear that he felt the same way. “Should I be worried that Weasley is going to try and murder me in my sleep?”
Draco watched as the brunette walked over and took Granger’s place in the chair opposite him.
“Why didn’t you just tell me mate? Seriously, I’m supposed to be your best friend…Does ‘Mione know?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Let me know what you think!! <3
After what seemed like hours of silence Weasley filled the void with another loud huff, “I feel like I don’t even know you anymore mate.”
Before Harry or anyone else could process what was happening, a very frantic Hermione Granger appeared from around the corner.
On impulse, purely on the impulse of knowing that soon they would be back at school, the bond dissipated, and returned to normalcy, a normalcy that pitted the two boys as enemies and most definitely not lovers, Draco acted.
When they reached their dry solace, Draco braced himself on the wall of the tunnel in attempt to catch his breath, Potter beside him. They were both breathing heavily, out of breath from the exertion of the run and the adrenaline of what they’d endured. Draco extended his arms out in front of him, bracing himself more firmly on the wall his head resting on his shoulder as he peered over at Potter for the first time. He watched as Potter’s eyes traveled the length of his body, and met Draco’s eyes, cheeks flushing red with the realization he’d been caught. Draco tried not to read into it, remembering the lecture he’d given himself earlier lounging in the grass, before fat and stupid Dudley had ruined it all.
It suddenly felt too much to bear. He loved Harry; he did but he was asking for so much. How could he turn his back on his mother and father? He knew that he was a disappointment to his father thus far, and that this would disappoint him even further, especially the part where he was gay and in love with Harry Potter, sworn enemy of the Dark Lord. But what about his mother? Surely, he couldn’t just abandon her.
However, today was different, as they bumped elbows all the way down the street towards the park, Draco chose to break the silence, which was unusual as their unspoken pledge didn’t permit them to speak until they were away from Privet Drive. “Harry,” Draco stopped and turned to face him, a hand on his elbow nudging him to do the same, “I hate to stray from our typical riveting plans for the day, but do you think, I mean, is there a library around here? Or even just a book store?” His gray eyes took on the earnest look that Harry wasn’t sure he’d ever get used to but making it hard to deny the other boy’s request. Before he could respond however, the other boy surged on, “I mean, as delightfully tormenting as it’s been to be alone with my own mind the last week, I think I could really use a break, yeah?”
