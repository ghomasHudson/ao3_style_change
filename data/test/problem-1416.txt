Not realizing that Ron and Hermione were staring at her, Harriet rose from her seat to reach over and grab a napkin.
Harriet stilled when her head started to throb again. As she relaxed back onto Draco’s bed, she asked wearily, “Why…...Why am I here?......You’ve abducted me.”
He would find out just who had left that troublesome box with whatever issues it contained and he would make sure that Lucius-
The sharp, slight motion of his teeth against her tender skin sent currents of pleasure shooting through Harriet as she replied absently, “..........Yeah?”
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Slowly, she turned her head and dismay gripped her as she saw Ron and Hermione gaping at her with wide eyes.
Draco shut her eyes tightly and as she let out a breath, Harry’s hand wandered down to splay across her overfull belly.
His mouth was half open as Harriet sighed once she was finally comfortable, her swollen breasts and belly heaving right in front of his face, before she lifted her hands and began to comb gently through his short, pale, blond hair.
Apparently, Draco really did fancy the changes in Mrs. Malfoy, because he already wanted to take her again~.
In those awful moments afterwards, Draco remembered the secretary helping him to a nearby bench and sitting down beside him.
If Draco’s wife had gone into heat and the two of them were spending her cycle together, that most likely meant that she would become a grandmother soon.
Harriet was ashamed of herself but under Draco’s captivating gaze and his tender touch, the pregnant omega didn’t have the ability to maintain her efforts of pushing him away. Another sharp flutter landed against her rib cage suddenly and Harriet winced as her hand flew to the side.
Harriet was known for being the Chosen One and for her obvious accomplishment of defeating Voldemort, but truthfully, in the classroom, Draco’s marks had been better. Underneath the pompous, aristocratic exterior he always worked so hard to project, Draco actually valued and enjoyed education.
Narcissa was smiling as widely as Harriet, although she was sitting on her hands to resist the urge to snatch her adorable grandson from his mother’s arms and cuddle him close.
Draco’s affection was deep, sweet, and loving and once he finally pulled away, he and Harriet were both breathless.
He thought that surely after spending the rest of the evening making love, Harriet would fall into a deep and restful sleep.
The cashier rang up the couples’ selection of baby clothes, a few maternity dresses and bras that Harriet had discreetly asked to purchase, and several plush toys that the pair had chosen as well. As the store attendant worked, Draco stood behind Harriet and slipped an arm around her waist to splay his hand protectively over her rounded belly.
The last line that Draco spoke was more emotional than either of them had anticipated and Harriet felt tears water in her eyes as Draco gave her a tense scowl of deep admiration and devoted determination.
Ron was nowhere near as abrasive as Draco and he nodded back to his guest politely as he glanced at Scorpius and replied, “Congratulations to you too, Malfoy. He’s a fine lad.”
His irritation was made even worse as his instincts screamed at him to go in the room and help his frightened, suffering omega.
Harriet could hear the tension in his voice and the only thing that matched that anxiety was her own.
Harriet couldn’t stop grinning from the way Draco was looking at her, as if his life and everything in it depended on whether or not she was having a good time.
“I can help, if you’d like. I believe the same midwife that delivered Draco is still working. She did an excellent job.” Narcissa offered Harriet, then she looked over at Draco and sighed as she smiled bittersweetly while she reminisced, “I remember the day you were born, my darling. It was such a lovely June afternoon.”
Draco remembered going through that cycle what he thought had been ten times between when he had sat holding his son last night and then, as he sat blinking at the ray of light from the new day.
Draco’s sneer turned into a guilty frown as he reached out and took the basket with a nod, “Thanks….I’ll give it to her when she wakes.”
“It will pass, Mr. Malfoy. This is a difficult transitional time. Of course, there will be changes in your omega.” The healer said dismissively.
As their lovely afternoon melted into a long, luxurious dinner by the fire, Draco and Harriet got a taste of what riding out a heat really entailed.
In the middle of enjoying her massage, instinct began to take over for Harriet. Draco’s velvety fingertips coupled with his scent, the smell of a loving, protective alpha, it was too much for the omega to bear. As a craving was born in her heart, her body began to release the pheromones that signaled to Draco exactly what she wanted.
After several hours of eating, dancing, talking, and drinking, the Malfoy couple were glad to leave their party, hand in hand, with Scorpius clutched in Harriet’s arms, dressed in miniature-sized formal wear, amidst their guests who cheered for them.
As the couple landed in the middle of a dark, warm area, and stood atop a wooden pier, Draco saw the mirth on Harriet’s face as she smiled in delight, and he knew that was a lie.
But a family meal just sounded so…...bizarre to Draco, not to mention, a great opportunity for drama and disaster based on his earlier confrontation with his parents.
The woman behind the counter acted like Draco had nothing better to do but stand there and chat with her about Harriet’s identifying information.
He watched as the creature led Scorpius down the hallway towards where Lucius and Narcissa sat waiting at the dining table.
“I don’t understand why you keep going on about this. How many times do I have to tell you ‘no’?” Harriet sighed as she picked up her brush and began to run it through her long hair.
Draco was frightened that “cold” may mean “unbearably cold”. He was worried that Harriet would be uncomfortable or in pain, but his death grip of reassurance on her hand started to ease when he saw she was completely relaxed as the doctor finished.
“That’s what happens to pregnant omegas.” He said, with an unusual warmth in his voice, as he kissed Harriet’s cheek, “How are you feeling now?”
“I was too busy daydreaming of bending you over the desk to pay that close of attention.” Draco said with a wry smile.
“There’s no reason to be sorry, Potter.” Draco laughed as he sat beside her and gently rubbed her shoulder.
When Harriet was finally alone in the living room with the baby, she was briefly seized by a disturbing wave of terror.
A soft smile played across Draco’s lips as he nodded, “Of course! You know I do, I’ve been waiting for this.”
He took Harriet back to the manor, undressed them both, and minutes after they lay down in her nest, she was asleep.
Harriet wore a firm pout on her face as she lifted one of the pillows behind her head and used it to playfully smack Draco against his shoulder.
While Harriet and Draco enjoyed their mating cycle, Lucius and Narcissa kept a respectful distance on their side of the house.
A house elf, whom Scorpius was very fond of, appeared at the end of the long hallway and as soon as Draco saw the familiar family servant, he ran towards the elf while Draco called out, “Go and sit with your grandparents at the table! Mummy and I will be right there!”
He returned to Harriet’s side in time to take the many different educational parchments and advice booklets that the midwife gave the couple.
He knew that it would be considered unmannerly if he were to pounce on his new bride in front of others.
That was something he had always admired about his omega, her complete and utter determination to protect Draco. It had been an unignorable instinct for Narcissa from the moment the Malfoy heir had been conceived.
She could return whenever she wanted, after all, she was Harriet Potter, the Chosen One, the defeater of the Dark Lord…..but the Chosen One wisely realized that her little boy’s baby days would only last for a short while and she wanted to be present for them.
While Draco zipped around the stadium, flashing his confidence along with his green and white uniform, Harriet searched and searched.
Harriet’s smile faded when she saw the blank look on his face and she asked him, “Is something wrong?”
It wasn’t enough that Draco had already penetrated her body and her heart. He knew that if he was going to be hers, truly hers, then that meant he had to smash through the brick wall she insisted on placing between them.
There would surely be rumors afloat after Harriet Potter and Draco Malfoy were seen together out on……...out on…….a date?
Harriet was speaking to two of her female coworkers about the very subject she had written Draco on an hour earlier.
“Here, support her head like this, keep your arms firm like this….” Harriet guided her husband as she taught him how to hold an infant.
Draco remained silent and let Harriet speak for herself. She had been so headstrong about the entire situation he didn’t dare try to interject. However, he didn’t hold back the proud sneer that slipped across his thin lips as Ron looked over at him as if he were silently asking their longtime enemy if what it looked like was really true.
“What don’t you understand, Draco?! I don’t want them to have anything to do with the wizarding world!” Harriet cried, “I don’t want them to have to live through the ugliness that we have!”
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy!” The jewelry salesman whispered back with narrowed eyes as if he were very offended that Draco would even dare to think any differently.
She frowned while she watched her alpha come and sit down gently on the bed as a defeated sigh escaped his thin lips.
“Love you, Potter~.” Draco whispered to Harriet while Scorpius let go of her nipple and yawned as he started to doze off with his tiny tummy full.
Instead of letting the new mother help her baby get comfortable and prepare on her own, the midwife turned the baby into the position she thought was best while the healer yanked Harriet’s nightdress down to expose her breasts without warning.
Ron gazed back at Hermione as he spoke with complete conviction, “I think that she and Malfoy really…….really care about each other.”
Draco picked his wand up from the nightstand and with a single wave, he cleaned himself and Harriet from their busy afternoon.
“None of your business, that’s what it is!” Harriet cried as she roughly pushed Draco’s hands away from her round belly.
The healer drawing out the ultimate conclusion was doing nothing to soothe the expectant father’s nerves.
“-You know what I meant!” Draco snapped as he looked over at whom he had always considered an enemy, “I’ve done everything I can! Potter agreed to work with me, but her body has different ideas, apparently.”
On the day of the wizarding world’s most highly anticipated wedding, Malfoy manor was in complete chaos.
Draco carried his little ones out of their nursery and across the hall. He mumbled under his breath and handlessly opened the door to his and Harriet’s bedroom.
He looked down over his lover for a moment and his grey eyes softened at how beautiful and vulnerable Harriet looked, laying there in his arms, with her elegant neck leading down to her chest and the ample swells of cleavage that his firstborn was busy glutting himself on.
One morning though, as Draco sorted through the mail that had been brought into his damask office at the headquarters of Lucius Malfoy’s company, he frowned curiously at a strange letter amongst the pile of bills and notices.
“I’ve got a terrible problem that I don’t know how to sort out.” Draco said with a deep sigh as he walked over to the table and sat down.
When the key entered the lock, the enchanted door slowly opened itself to welcome its guests inside.
“It’s still too early to make any accurate guesses.” The healer replied with a shrug, “For now, what I’m prescribing is some rest for my patient. She should have loads of nest time over the next few weeks. Let’s see if that won’t bring her around, shall we?”
Draco knew that things were progressing as He watched Harriet fight her way out of the nest and walk around the room. He trailed obediently behind her with a soft, clean towel, trying to blot away the perspiration from her skin during the break between pains.
“Draco Smith?What an unusual name.” Mr. Roberts remarked, “I beg your pardon, sir, do I know you from somewhere?”
“I could still conceive.” Harriet replied in a hushed whisper as Draco sat back on his knees and watched her spread her legs to welcome him, even while she feigned apprehension.
Draco walked over silently and crawled into Harriet’s nest. He pulled her close to him, careful not to wake her, and stared down at her with a scowl.
Once his suit jacket was in place, he reached out his hand to Harriet and asked, “Well, Potter? Are you ready to marry me?”
She closed her eyes for a second and wrapped her arms around her little boy as she ran her fingers through his pale hair lovingly before he asked, “You and Dad will write to me when the babies come, won’t you?”
Harriet’s face fell as her happiness faded and the reality of her situation pressed painfully upon her.
“They do realize we have no idea how to care for a child, right?!” Draco called down the short hallway after Harriet.
Harriet said nothing about wanting another baby, but she welcomed Draco full heartedly as they kissed and touched until he had sheathed himself within her.
Draco held his favorite picture of Harriet in his hands with his mouth gaping and his eyes blurring as his slender fingers found his arousal and began their attempt to ease his suffering….
At that moment, all Harriet wanted to think about was the incredible, gentle affection her alpha lavished upon her and the way he was driving her so cruelly towards blissful release~.
They lived as a family, they loved as a family, and they grew as a family, but they weren’t a proper family, and that bothered Draco.
Draco inhaled through his mouth as he tried to steady himself. His voice came out like a strangled growl when he asked, “Potter……..are you…are you…....in heat?”
Draco swallowed thickly as Harriet laid a hand on her abdomen and moved onto the bed to straddle him.
She yawned again, fatigued to her core, despite the lengthy five hours of sleep she had managed the previous night. Draco didn’t listen to his wife’s denial as he knelt down and smiled at her tiny belly as if the baby would see him and smile back.
Harriet barely remembered handing the snitch to Oliver Wood, she had forgotten all about her bet with Draco, or who was supposed to have been the better flyer, the better player……
As one who served a prestigious wizarding family, Healer Marigold made it a point not to get entangled in the Malfoy family’s member’s personal affairs.
When Draco finally opened his grey eyes, he saw Harriet standing next to him and asked worriedly, “Love……..are you alright? What’s the matter?”
Five years after the conclusion of the second wizarding world war, it was a well known fact to all witches and wizards that Draco and Harriet Malfoy were very much in love.

Harriet was certain that Draco would have noticed the way her breasts had swelled and her lips pinkened as her heat approached.
Quick, scuffling footsteps came pounding through the hall until a quiet knock fell on Draco’s bedroom door.
Draco was seized by the mind-numbing fear that Harriet would slap him away or continue her protest, but his shoulders shuddered in relief when Harriet arched her back and pressed her belly into his hands as she lovingly returned his kiss.
“I don’t want to leave Scorpius.” Harriet blinked at her sleeping baby as Draco started to walk out of the nursery.
Sleep deprived but immensely happy, Draco and Harriet checked out of the inn with baby Scorpius and shortly after dawn, they returned to Draco’s bedroom in Malfoy manor.
She felt an unfamiliar sensation, a soothing, gentle motion over the firm curve of her swollen belly.
Later that night, a single candle burned in one of the top rooms of the large, thatched-roof building that served as the hotel on the beautiful isle where Harriet Potter had become Harriet Malfoy.
“My love!” Draco called as he ran. He gently took Harriet's hand in his and brushed a stray strand of her messy, dark hair out of her face.
As soon as Harriet crawled under the covers next to Draco though, she noticed that resting really wasn’t on her husband’s mind.
Draco smiled bitterly to himself as he marveled over the fact that he wasn’t surprised his mate was already up and gone for the day.
Draco wondered why his mother was so mindful of her grandson with her tone after she had pounded on their door like an interrogation officer from the Ministry.
Harriet wouldn’t have known how to perform the task either if Hermione hadn’t shown her right after Rose had been born.
It was the evening on which Harriet informed her husband that their efforts had once again proven unsuccessful.
“Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy, can we not interest you two in a room for the night? One can still be added to your package, it would be quite romantic…...” The officiant offered solicitously.
Draco had been a wonderful aid to her recovery but his scrupulous attention couldn’t completely erase the aches of pregnancy.
The only thing that she dreaded telling Draco of more than a pregnancy was the confirmation that there was no pregnancy of which to speak.
As Draco laid her back on the green velvet sofa and began to tease her towards her first peak with his fingers and his tongue, while Harriet moaned out his name, she hoped the baby took even longer to arrive.
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
Headstrong and brazen, Harriet was a very different omega. She insisted that Draco didn’t pout when she had to work late. Aurors rarely kept decent hours and Harriet was particularly hard-working at her career. Draco filled his time studying alchemy and partnering with his father to run the family’s business empire.
The healer hadn’t given instructions on the matter mentioned specifically, but in Harriet’s current, weakened condition, Draco knew that making love was most likely not a good idea.
There was a flurry of motion around the laboring omega as the midwife, the healer, Narcissa, and Hermione came barging in to help.
With his pride and his heart wounded, the alpha held his omega close while they apparated back to Malfoy manor.
The damask curtains were highlighted by the gothic chandeliers that hung over each ornate, ebony crib.
Harriet’s laugh rang out in the room. It was a jovial, deep sound of genuine mirth as she replied arrogantly, “Draco Malfoy, I am ten times the flyer that you will ever be! Everyone knows that.”
Draco wouldn’t debase himself by openly letting Ron think that he cared about his approval of his new baby, but regardless, Draco preened at the other alpha’s compliment.
Harriet eyed her mate cautiously while she moved over to where he had been standing and huffed as she corrected the ruffled edges of the blankets that her clueless alpha had mistakenly disarranged.
“That’s what I’m counting on, love~.” Draco replied with a wolfish grin as he dove forward and pulled Harriet into his arms.
Wave after wave of pain rolled through her body, leaving her kneeling on the bed, rocking back and forth while she tried to catch her breath.
Draco loyally accompanied his wife to her appointment with her midwife during the first week of her seventh month.
Harriet decided to meet it head on, to crash into that pressure and let it rip her apart as it so badly wanted.
It came to a head one afternoon when Draco found Harriet lying on the nursery floor beside Scorpius’s intricately carved crib, staring off into the distance as she lost herself to her own thoughts.
Although Harriet’s dark wedding dress was far from traditional in the muggle world, a group of late night hikers happened by and when they saw the couple kissing and the officiant standing a short distance in front of them, they happily applauded.
Since he had discovered Harriet’s pregnancy, Draco had clung to the idea that wizarding medicine far surpassed that of muggles on every front. He had enarmomed himself with the notion that the arrival of a new life wasn’t dangerous at all for witches.
Draco had carried out his errand with Ron and Hermione before Harriet and Scorpius woke from their afternoon nap.
When Harriet took her pills, the gory mess was barely noticeable. The cramping and bloating during her heat was miserable.
Draco’s head snapped over towards the bed and he blinked at Harriet, who was sitting up against the pillows, already holding their little baby against her breasts once again.
Draco pounced so quickly that Harriet barely had time to process the sensations he sent racing through her.
While they tended the pregnancy, spending so much time together left Harriet and Draco plenty of opportunity to talk and chat.
It was night time when Harriet and Draco arrived and both of them stepped gingerly along the wooden pier underneath their feet as they both gawked at the scenery in which they were immersed.
Harriet lifted the lid and stared down at the dark dress inside before she asked her alpha with a confused scowl, “......Where are we going?”
Harriet noticed that as he did, he quickly shifted her off of his lap. Most omegas would have been offended by the motion, but Harriet felt she had a pretty good idea of the reason behind her husband’s action~.......
“I don’t think that’s safe right now, love.” Draco whispered in a bittersweet tone as he let his fingers trail across the inside of Harriet’s legs.
“Draco, you need to stop placing so much importance on it.” Harriet said to her alpha as they sat side by side on the same green velvet sofa in their bedroom one evening after her second heat had ended.
Harriet couldn’t get comfortable in bed that evening and it didn’t help that Draco kept staring at her scrutinizingly.
It took every ounce of restraint that Draco had to refuse her advances. Some alphas thought their mates looked so different that they were no longer attractive but Draco didn't understand that mentality at all.
As Draco kissed his way down Harriet, she sighed happily, looking forward to their early morning frolic.
Draco frowned at his father and blinked, unsure of what would be the acceptable answer, “...........the imperious curse?”
“You don’t know if they’re false contractions or not.” Draco retorted, “The healers said on Monday that the baby could come anytime.”
Harriet’s look of reverent admiration and arousal turned into a deep frown of disappointment as she stared up at Draco and cried, “That’s not fair!”
A dry gasp left Harriet’s throat as she peered down at her tiny, baby boy, who blinked his curious grey eyes up at his mother with a frown.
Harriet’s green eyes widened at Draco’s gentle gesture. She didn’t want to admit to the electric shocks that Draco’s kiss sent shooting through her body, but that didn’t make them any less real.
Draco’s blonde head slammed into the side of the stadium so violently that the sound echoed across the stadium.
When Harriet finished reading the letter, her eyes flickered back to Draco and she asked, “How’s this going to shut you up?”
The middle-aged woman in front of him sprinted down the hall and Draco followed on her heels as his mind reeled and his stomach turned.
“Certainly.” The woman nodded with a smile as she led Harriet through the shop and up the short staircase into the room that functioned as her studio, “Many of my customers come with similar requests.”
As Draco slipped from her, he took his wand from his pocket and apprated them both back to Malfoy manor.
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Draco’s owl was indeed able to deliver his letters to Harriet. With little difficulty, the bird had located the flat in Hogsmeade that Harriet had rented.
Opening his eyes once his analysis was complete, his breath hitched in his chest at what he had seen.
Draco wasn’t put off by his mate’s reluctance. He was well aware of the ability he had to melt Harriet’s heart. For that reason alone, he was more than confident that he would ultimately win the war.
After Scorpius and the elf had gone from his sight, Draco turned and headed in the opposite direction.
The first night with his newborn has been as tumultuous as he expected, but it wasn’t a pace he couldn’t handle.
In the picture, Harriet was sitting on the chair with Scorpius and Draco was standing behind her….....but as she watched, Draco opened up his suit jacket, and held it out so the embossed, white stitching on the jacket’s inside was clearly legible:
Thank you for reading! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Please let me know if you enjoy! Updates every Saturday!
Narcissa was always eager to look after her beloved little Scorpius, and that conveniently freed up Draco to examine and debate over napkin options or potential tablecloths.
Draco’s hands were extra gentle around Harriet’s back, belly, and breasts, the places he knew that she was the most tender.
Careful not to hold her breath in, she inhaled and exhaled slowly while she tried her best to relax.
“-She’s a pregnant omega.” The healer cut in as he interrupted Draco, “Her coworkers who brought her here today spoke to me about how dedicated she is to her job. Perhaps that’s the source of her fatigue, or perhaps her symptoms are a precursor to something more.”
It all happened so smoothly that Harriet barely had time to notice. Draco’s addictive kiss and his skillful hands as they slipped off of her breasts to travel along her curves were driving her mad.
Harriet was going to mention something else but Draco leaned in and captured her lips before she could force words from her throat.
The meetings only lasted an hour or two but they remained a great inconvenience for him since he had to rise and leave his pregnant lover snuggled in her nest alone.
The Malfoys had been served by the same healer for decades. Now an elderly woman, she was stern but kind. Draco was positive that the family healer would be able to help Harriet just as well as the staff at St. Mungo’s and much more than a group of ordinary muggle physicians.
Sometimes she was nauseous, other times she was stricken with sudden, intense cravings for one food and one food alone.
“Probably more than I should~.” Harriet replied as she leaned in to kiss her alpha sweetly on his lips.
After they arrived back at Malfoy manor, she undressed to go to the shower. When Harriet had to drop their connection though, he stayed beside her and helped her out of her clothes. As she walked into the bathroom, he followed her,  and washed her gently as the warm water ran over them both.
He watched as Harriet sat up to stretch, careful not to miss the subtle bounce of her breasts or the outline of her small bump that made his chest swell with pride.
“Get your hands off of me, Malfoy!” Harriet hissed, “I beg your pardon, but I don’t need your protection!”
She gazed at her little one for a long moment, with Hermione and Narcissa admiring the newborn from a respectful distance.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harriet incredulously, “Potter, the war is over. You do know that, don’t you?”
The soft grass was the first thing that Harriet noticed as she and Draco arrived in a thicket of trees with a loud pop.
Harriet was ready to spend a quiet afternoon with her husband, but she learned that he had other plans.
Harriet held onto his arm while she watched her new husband place his signature on the document before he handed it over to her.
“You look gorgeous exactly as you are now. Besides, silly primping will make little difference later tonight…..” Draco replied as he finished with her dress, “There…...all done, let’s be off.”
The warmth in his grey eyes made Harriet feel like she had a great, comforting blanket wrapped around her.
The alpha sneered as he hissed, “Thank goodness, Potter. This manor would have been flooded with letters if you hadn’t told them I wasn’t holding you prisoner.”
Despite the discomforts that her cycle brought, Harriet genuinely enjoyed being so close and so tightly bonded to her alpha.
Draco’s sneer slipped into a dangerous grimace as he glared at the expecting omega, “Potter, why do you insist on making this a battle between us?! I thought that we-“
Harriet was certain that her husband would lick his wounds and after a few days, she wouldn’t hear anything else about him wanting a family.
That was during the next Malfoy board meeting and Harriet marveled at how close she had come to failing at completing her private project.
“Pleased to meet you, sir. I’m healer Jansen…..Your wife has endured quite a bit today.” The healer nodded as he glanced down at Harriet’s chart in his hands, “Her system is on the verge of collapse from exhaustion, but her nutrients all seem to be in order. From that anguished look on your face, Mr. Malfoy, I’m sure you’ve looked after her, but some omegas can be rather stubborn, can’t they?”
During those final weeks, Harriet continued to exchange letters back and forth with her friends every couple of days when she found the energy to write.
Shuffling into the living area to answer the muggle phone that Harriet had spelled to work without an outlet, she answered it hesitantly, “.......Hello?”
“Take me, Draco.” Harriet whimpered, gasping for breath as her nipples rubbed obscenely against the insides of his fingers with the rise and fall of her heaving chest, “I need you~.”
Clothing hurt her skin, the friction was too constant, too close, but there in her bed, she felt safe and warm. Lying amongst Draco’s things, Harriet snuggled down and breathed deeply, trying to pick up enough of her alpha’s smell to satisfy herself until her blonde mate came home.
Draco hadn’t kept his hopes too high of earning Lucius’s approval about the baby and he didn’t really care if he received it or not, but the way Lucius had looked at the newborn and what he had said did make Draco smile.
He threw Harriet a look of pure astonishment. She had spoken with such conviction that it seemed almost too easy, as if her and Draco being together were the most natural thing in the world.
Draco had sent for all of her things so she would have what she needed and feel more comfortable in her new surroundings.
The promise of more sleep was discarded as Draco sat up against the headboard and carefully but quickly scooped Harriet into his lap.
Lucius and Narcissa were elated to meet little Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy, a name suggested by the infant’s father.
“I see you received your present, love.” Harriet cooed to Draco as she looked at the open box of photos on his desk, next to the picture he held in his hand, “I was genuinely hoping that you’d enjoy your surprise, though perhaps not quite this much.” She finished with a chuckle.
The more desperate Draco became, the more he would make love to her and that was Harriet’s favorite pastime, making love to Draco~.
“We don’t have anyone here in the emergency department by that name either, sir.” The receptionist said with a smile so sweet Draco wondered if it caused her cavities.
“It’s right there.” Narcissa replied irritably as she traced along the outline of the picture with the tip of her fingernail, “Look at that…..there’s the head…..that must be an arm…..”
Draco watched the baby start to whine, push his little face against his chest, and he realized it was time to return his son to his mate.
Harriet didn’t smile back at her husband. Instead, she stared at him from behind her glasses and replied in a fierce warning, “You….wish…..”
Draco didn’t trust a spell or a charm to look after his little family, for that task, he only trusted his own eyes.
Harriet grabbed hold of her alpha by his black, silk tie and pulled him up to her face so she could kiss him.
Lucius was silent for a moment and Narcissa opened her mouth to speak again but Draco abruptly turned and stormed out of the dining room.
Afterwards, once they had finished coupling and Harriet lay dozing against his chest, Draco held the ring that he meant to have already placed on Harriet’s finger and frowned.
Harriet wondered vaguely what was going to happen for a moment but before she could really ponder the idea, Draco murmured under his breath and they were off……...
She raised her wand in the air and left the room with a loud pop, eager to find her alpha and see if anything in particular had delayed him from returning to her side…...
Harriet didn’t have the slightest clue what her alpha was up to or that he had even left her side whenever he returned, since Draco chose to carry out his secondary conferences with Ron and Hermione mostly either late at night or at dawn, during which Harriet was asleep and Scorpius lay snoozing as well, tucked into his little crib.
Hermione’s unsettling fury ebbed quickly as she saw the look on Harriet’s face and took pity on her friend, “Why didn’t you just…..Why didn’t you just tell us, Harriet?”
While Draco spoke, the healer’s eyes remained fixed curiously on Harriet. When Draco saw that, he cleared his throat and introduced the healer to her new patient, “Harriet, this is Margerie Marigold, the Malfoy family healer. Healer Marigold, this is Harriet, my mate.”
“You look lovely~.” Draco’s soft whisper cooed in her ear while his nimble hands fastened the buttons from the nape of her neck all the way down to the small of her back.
“W-What are you doing?” Harriet asked Draco as he held the ring box in one hand and went to open it with the other.
Draco had spent long hours mastering his new skill, but the day that he received the court order to officially request a paternity test from Harriet, he was finally successful at performing the useful spell.
Baby Scorpius didn’t hear his mother’s whimpers of pleasure as her new husband pounded her into the bed.
Harriet blinked as Draco reached under her arms and, careful not to put any pressure on her belly, lifted her up.
It was only a chandelier, but in that moment to Harriet, the boxes and the chandelier were a complete disaster!
When Harriet and Draco walked into the dining room, they found themselves greeted by the happy smiles of their little ones and the gentle welcome of Lucius and Narcissa.
At the end of the article, there was even an entire subsection dedicated to baby Scorpius. That portion of print told all about the youngest Malfoy, and speculated as to what his abilities may be one day given the esteemed heritages from his famous parents.
Without a word, Harriet squirmed in the sheets until her legs were wrapped around her husband’s trim waist, pulling his hips to center over hers so that his arousal nudged against the thin fabric of her panties, the only barrier that kept them apart.
“Congratulations, Weasley.” Draco nodded at Ron while Hermione and Harriet sat, talking about their little ones as they sipped their tea on the other side of the room.
Draco had his arms up in celebration as cheers erupted after he worked with one of Slytherin’s beaters to nearly send a bludger whirling out of the stadium when he saw Harriet dive low.
For the rest of the afternoon, Draco spent his time fussing and cooing over Harriet as they cuddled together in the nest that she had hastily thrown together.
Draco watched Harriet seal the letter and send it off with an owl. He didn’t know exactly what Harriet had said but he knew that she was replying to calm Ron and Hermione.
Narcissa certainly didn’t approve of her son’s chosen mate, but she would rather he be united with his love than as miserable as he had looked a few moments earlier.
Harriet’s attention was called away when Draco announced, in a voice that was to his humiliation, choked with tears, “We have a son, Potter.”
The nurse left them alone and Harriet laid down on the table in the room while Draco sat loyally at her side.
“When I saw her right after she was born, she looked more like Hermione.” Harriet retorted as she quickly brushed her long, brown hair.
His hand usually slipped off of her sometime in the wee hours of the morning, only to resume its position as soon as he woke.
Narcissa directed where the flowers should be placed while Lucius ordered the house elves to serve the food and set the table.
It didn’t matter if it was usually served at breakfast, lunch, or dinner, or dessert…if Harriet requested it, then Draco had it prepared for her.
“Good morning, Scorp.” Draco grinned as he reached out and carefully grabbed one of Scorpius’s tiny, socked feet in his pale, elegant fingers.
She didn’t remember a time in recent weeks when she had allowed herself the luxury of cuddling into Draco and truly resting.
“Draco…..I don’t know what you want me to say. Do you want to tell them we’re calling it off? I don’t think your mother and father are going to allow this to happen without show and pomp.” Harriet said with a bitter chuckle, “That’s who they are and that’s who they want to be….That’s really who they want you to be as well.”
As Harriet’s second heat came to a slow and gentle close, she lamented the fact that it may be months or years before she had the opportunity to spend such primally intimate moments with Draco again.
Harriet had always been very independent, she didn’t need Draco watching her every second of every day.
In Harriet’s lap, baby Scorpius was adorably clothed in what resembled a little suit similar to his father’s.
“......And you can.” Draco replied with an enthusiastic nod as he placed a hand over her small belly and looked down at the swell lovingly, “As soon as the baby comes.”
Harriet’s thoughts were called away by the teacher’s voice, “Alright, class! Today we’re going to see something a little different! If you have a weak stomach, I implore you to turn away when you need to do so. This is my fourth week with you all and we’ve managed to go over quite a bit of information.”
Draco was behind her, massaging her back, and the midwife was breathing with her, gliding her hands over her belly when an evil pressure unlike anything Harriet had ever felt presented itself, causing her to blurt out with wide eyes, “I HAVE TO PUSH!”
She nearly jumped out of the bed when she saw Draco sleeping beside her with his hand protectively splayed over her tummy.
She charged towards the bedroom she shared with Draco and burst through the door, expecting to find him either asleep or violently ill.
A quarter of an hour later, Harriet sat with Draco at a table in a private corner of the finest eating establishment in Britain’s wizarding world.
They’d have to exchange the dresses and make a few alterations with the nursery, that was true, but those were minor annoyances, that was all.
Once mother and baby were cleaned and stable, Harry apparated them to St. Mungo’s for a postpartum exam.
As Draco walked out of his father’s study with his son’s fussy whimpers quickly turning into hungry cries, he smiled as he made his way back to Harriet.
“Harriet!” Ron said happily, then he nodded politely as his blue eyes drifted over to Draco, “Malfoy.”
They climbed into Harriet’s nest before Draco covered them both with a blanket, took one of her fattened nipples into his mouth, and began to nurse gently while he kneaded the swollen gland.
If Harriet saw what awaited them in the dining room, if their story was smeared all over the front page of the Prophet, it would be over between them.
Draco glanced at Harriet wearily and nodded, “It’ll be another hour or two before Mother and Father are awake, let’s lay back down.”
“That’s because I wasn’t there to play for Gryffindor!” Harriet squealed as Draco pulled her close and playfully nibbled along the sensitive  nape of her neck.
The brown-haired Gryfinndor squeezed her lover’s hand as she declared without a doubt, “Ron, look! That’s Harriet in there!”
By the time her alpha slipped inside her, Harriet was so ready for the contact that her body practically pulled him in and together, they moved against each other until Harriet found her pleasure and Draco experienced his own, intense release after Harriet clamped around him.
When it was finished and Harriet was satisfied with how it looked, Draco gathered the courage to wrap his arms around his mate from behind and nip at her earlobe as they stood together.
“-No.” Draco replied with a frown, “I woke with an ache in my back, it feels just like it did with Scorpius….It’ll be hours yet.” Draco complained with a defeated huff, “I’m not in a rush to get in that hard bed at St. Mungo’s before I absolutely must.”
Harriet realized she was lying on her side and as she became more awake, she started suddenly when she recognized that something was drifting over her abdomen…...
Lucius stepped in front of Draco so that they stood eye to eye and he hissed out his response, “I would rather my son had learned when to keep his trousers buckled in the first place! You could have acted with some decency and courted the Potter girl, married her, and then started your family. Although as unscrupulous as your generation is, I’m not sure why I was so surprised that you failed to follow common social courtesy!”

“You don’t have to get up with me every time, Draco.” Harriet chided quietly as she smiled up at her alpha.
“Alright.” Draco nodded, “Is there anything I can do to help you? Is there anything I can get for you? Or bring you?”
Draco attributed it to basic biology, but there were times when he looked at his omega and wondered about what it would be like to create a life with her.
A bright smile cracked across Harriet’s dry lips and her eyes filled with tears as she watched the baby in her arms coo and tighten his tiny grip on his father’s finger.
Draco didn’t know how to answer the doctor’s question and he looked over at Harriet to place the decision in her hands.
The careful attention that Draco showed Harriet, the rest and relaxation she finally allowed herself to receive, and the many hours she spent languishing idly in her alpha’s arms and cooing under the gentle assault of his loving hands, all helped Mrs. Malfoy sail smoothly into her third trimester.
Harriet protested Draco’s every advance, Draco’s every flirtation, but even while she put up a fuss, she never took the obvious steps available to her as a means of repelling him either.
He felt secure with the preparations he had made for his wife and child and that left him content to explore the nightly visions that danced through his mind of the family life that was to come.
It didn’t bother Harriet that Draco’s family looked at her, they had always looked at her, but the expression in their cold eyes was different now.
With a melancholy frown marring his handsome face, Draco rolled over in bed and sighed, feeling the skin on his bare chest tingle in irritation at the early morning chill.
“What’s the matter?” Draco murmured to Harriet as her green eyes widened in horror at his sudden, ill-timed appearance.
Harriet could already feel a primal urge to start making a few preparations for the baby, but during the next few weeks, she was too weak to do anything but come home from work and close her eyes.
At first it wounded Harriet’s pride that her husband hadn’t sought her out but when she realized that he had only been thinking of her safety, an arrogant smirk spread over her face at the power she temporarily held over her alpha.
He stood from his chair and very quietly, he walked over and sat down on top of the covers beside her.
Draco instantly began rubbing deep circles in her lower back as he coached her, “Breathe, love, it’ll pass in a moment.”
The way Harriet had run and hid, yet still allowed him to come back into her life, and their baby’s….
Both of them would have so many questions and her answers weren’t going to be enough to excuse all of her secrecy.
Draco kept stealing glances at Harriet over the candlelit table but he was reluctant to gaze too long at his omega. He could feel Lucius’s stare boring into him.
That scent, so sweet, so intoxicating……..it made his pulse pound and his manhood throb in his trousers.
By the time Harriet finished speaking, silent tears were pouring down her cheeks as she thought about the last year.
Harriet held Draco’s hand in hers and he clutched onto their luggage as they both apparated to their destination.
“You’re not in heat.” Draco said with a smirk as he reached between them and pulled Harriet’s  panties down, “I don’t see why we need it~.”
Draco was as furious as he was frightened and without a word, he silently crept back down the hall. As he entered his bedroom, his pulse quickened when he found Harriet sitting up in bed and blinking at him.
When Draco understood that his omega was expressing her need for him, he smirked from ear to ear as he happily obliged and splayed his hands over their unborn child.
Draco’s face tensed like he had been stabbed in the gut and Harriet watched him draw in a tense breath.
As soon as Harriet took her hands away from her face, Draco dove in for a kiss. It was a deep, romantic kiss and he cupped Harriet’s face with one hand while he snaked the other down to cradle her belly protectively.
“She collapsed, mostly from, as I said, exhaustion. We had trouble waking her.” The healer nodded at Draco.
They had been together for years but he had never, never, ever seen his darling bride so wet and ready~.
Draco wasn’t going to look at the pamphlets form their muggle classes that evening, or the booklets.
Inside the cottage, Harriet sat chatting with Hermione while they both drank their last remaining sips of tea.
“Mr. Malfoy, a numbing agent is given to the patient before the procedure begins.” The teacher calmly informed her distraught, prized student, “I apologize, everyone. I was told this video showed the administration of spinal anesthesia before the surgery.”
Draco had quickly become well-known in his and Harriet’s childbirth class. He did nothing to hide the softness in his grey eyes as he and Harriet practiced together or the way that he smiled softly when he looked at her.
A wide smirk broke out across Draco’s face while he cuddled Harriet close. No matter how reluctant his omega insisted on acting, Draco knew that if he kept pushing, he’d eventually break her down and succeed in having her validate the love she secretly held for him.
Harriet changed into her new dress and looked at her reflection in the mirror while she tamed her rustled hair with a few strokes from her brush.
He was a newborn and as such, he brought all of the challenges that came with his kind, from frequent feedings to messy diapers, but he was a happy, cuddly, little baby that loved to be held and only cried when he was in need of something.
Harriet frowned in aggravation while she opened her eyes and saw her loving alpha already wrapped around her.
“Potter…” Draco breathed as he looked into her eyes, “I want you to take this, go into the lavatory, and spend some time preparing for this evening.”
Thanks for reading! Please let me know if you enjoy! I don’t own any of Harry Potter! Updates every Saturday!
It was one of the happiest days of Draco’s life because finally, it would become publicly known that Harriet Potter was irrefutably his~.
As Draco’s thin, elegant fingers fastened the buttons of his shirt, Harriet tried not to notice the way his eyes were fixated on her while she wriggled into one of her few dresses that still fit.
Harriet watched the expression of genuine joy on her husband’s face as he smiled widely at the baby who cooed up at him in response.
The long-anticipated Malfoy wedding was little more than a large, formal party to Harriet and Draco.
The younger Malfoy wore a frown while he waited to hear the criticism he knew his father would inevitably issue.
“Do you want a child to be half-Potter, half-Malfoy? Raised in the shadows of our tormented pasts?” Harriet asked.
Draco stared down at Harriet and relished the feeling of her fingertips sliding over his silky shirt for a moment.
Draco insisted his omega come home with him and even if she had refused, she wouldn’t have gotten anything done with him questioning her and chattering excitedly to her all day about their happy news.
On one particular morning, Draco traveled to Hogsmeade on a quest to pick up his mother’s order from Honeydukes.
“What are you talking about? After you’ve made me a father?” Draco asked in a whisper while his grip on her sides tightened ever so slightly, “How could I not?”
The door burst open and Harry charged across the room. He didn’t look worried but when he saw the state his bride was in, he seemed surprised and…...focused.
When Harriet finally calmed down and her tears turned into happy laughter, Draco smirked victoriously.
Draco looked at his mother for a second and then they both left the room, followed by the healer and the midwife who also politely took their exits.
An hour later, the birth was completely over and all of the mess that went along with it had been vanished away.
Harriet looked at Draco standing in front of her, handsome, strong, commanding…... It made her heart flutter in her chest.
When Draco’s spell ended, Harriet came back to him with a great cry and she fell against him once more as she wept to purge the last bit of crisis from her soul.
Draco traipsed into the Malfoy family library once more, climbed the mahogany ladder, and began to peruse through all of the many, ancient volumes that sat at the top of the tallest bookcases.
Harriet stared up at him and in return, Draco flashed a wolfish grin that was filled with early triumph.
Draco had held the baby, Narcissa had held the baby, Harriet was tired of her best friend being ignored.
Since that had finally happened, the fact that he was able to carelessly take the day off of work was a dangerous thing.
Narcissa blinked as her husband chased after their son with his black cloak swirling behind him as he stalked out of the room.
Once Draco’s letter was destroyed, Harriet walked into the kitchen and let the ashes fall from her hand into the rubbish bin.
The sheets came next and then the blankets were thrown on top, only the softest that the Malfoys owned, of course.
Back in the living area, as Draco gazed out at the calm, dark sea, Harriet’s plan already started to work.
She could feel Draco’s elegant hands gently kneading along the base of her spine while she lay on her side.
The photographer quietly walked up behind Harriet’s alpha and slipped an extra, very special, picture that he had captured into the hand that Draco held behind his back.
Draco immediately began his search for the efforts to win his prize.  The crowd from Slytherin’s section roared as he whizzed past, but Harriet found herself being humbled.
He had even given up his room to Harriet, allowing her to sleep in his bed while he slept in a guest room after he saw how naturally she cuddled into the sheets that smelled so nicely of him.
The Malfoy heir hadn’t been so overwhelmed since Lord Voldemort had ordered him to murder his headmaster.
Glares and sneers somehow boiled into passion that night and led to Draco pressing the Potter girl firmly against a stone wall.
Harriet slowly pulled herself out of the bed and placed one hand on her aching belly and another against her throbbing temple.
“Excellent work, Mr. Malfoy!” The instructor said with a bright smile, “Everytime I make my rounds through class, you’re always doing such a good job supporting your omega!”
Although Draco had helped Harriet repair her mental state, she wasn’t blind. She had seen the changes in her body. They weren’t disfiguring or extreme, but she was…...different, after the baby.
A large part of Harriet was pleased that she hadn’t conceived during her first cycle spent in Draco’s arms.
Slowed down by his own need, a silent thrill ran through Draco as his pregnant wife grabbed hold of the arms on his chair and stared into his grey eyes as she spoke, “We could have one go at it, you know. That won’t hurt~.”
While the weeks passed that Harriet had to wait for the photographer to develop and review the pictures, every day the growth of the life inside her brought her closer to bursting with her alpha’s baby.
Regardless, through money or magic, that evening, Draco Malfoy was determined to win his fight against the muggle family who were seeking to adopt his son or daughter.
Harriet had never imagined that she would end up in the arms of Draco Malfoy and she honestly didn’t understand why she had.
“My son informed me that he has not yet asked you to marry him.” Lucius snapped as he glared over at Draco before he turned his cold gaze onto Harriet.
“I’m going to guide you through labor.” Draco said to Harriet as he placed another kiss on her belly, “You won’t have to do anything, love, except hold onto me.”
Harriet contacted her lawyer and officially submitted her request to retract the adoption. Though processing the paperwork would take some time, there was no doubt in anyone’s mind that Harriet’s request would be granted. The Roberts family harbored no hard feelings towards the young couple and wished them all the best, assuming they were intent on raising their child together.
It didn’t matter how much his omega exhausted him, Draco Malfoy was determined……..he was going to fill Harriet Potter’s womb.
Harriet didn’t say anything in response but she did flash her mate a small smile of acceptance as she turned and added yet another article of Draco’s clothing into her nest.
“Go on, then.” Harriet nodded at him from across the table, “You wanted to chat, Malfoy, so…..chat.”
Draco didn’t want Harriet to feel forced or pressured. He was trying to be considerate by giving her space.
He should have been pulling her close and begging his omega for one last cuddle before they started their day.
The midwife had told the Malfoys that she could infer the gender of their baby when Harriet was fourteen weeks along.
Draco blinked as the doctor closed the door but when he felt Harriet squeeze his hand, he turned towards her.
Draco heard the door to their bedroom close as Harry left and a moment later, from down the hallway, she smiled softly as she listened to Scorpius’s sweet little voice chatting to his father.
Draco saw the pain on her face and concern clouded his handsome features. He pounced forward and hovered over his mate. Carefully, Draco helped her pull herself up by letting her clutch onto him while he fluffed the pillows behind her and kissed her lips sweetly as she settled back.
“That’s lovely.” Narcissa said with another smile, “I can’t wait to see the nursery once it’s been outfitted.”
Draco glanced up at Harriet and held her gaze as he gently took one of her plump nipples directly into his mouth. Harriet gasped sharply as he stroked his tongue over every crevice on the tender little bud before he began to rhythmically suck. He felt the omega rustle against him as a needy whimper escaped her lips. When Draco realized that Harriet had spread her legs to invite him closer, he felt his arousal pulse in his trousers as he curled around her belly, greedily pushing her other heavy, soft breast towards himself.
Draco scowled at his mate incredulously as she giggled and raised an eyebrow at him while she mused, “I think a wedding sounds lovely, actually~.”
Draco was thrown into such a gut-wrenching pit of hopelessness that he didn’t know what to do with himself.
Draco had charms on both himself and Harriet that documented the quality of their sleep each night and a special one just for her that dictated every available detail about her next cycle.
“You’re going to give me another baby to carry, Malfoy.” Harriet laughed as she gasped for breath, letting her hands roam through Draco’s short, blonde hair.
Scorpius hugged his mother one last time, briefly embraced his father, and then turned to board the train.
Whether his son grew to be the greatest wizard in the world or one of those…..what were they called?
Draco blinked for a moment and then he leaned down in the darkness to give Harriet a long, honest kiss.
It was a very lovely week for the newlyweds, together there on the sunny island, with each other, and their little one.
The wedding officiant cleared his throat and spoke over the whispers of the crowd as he declared, “I pronounce you, man and wife. Now, Mr. Malfoy, you may kiss your bride.”
Harriet insisted that all of the house elves who served the Malfoys were freed and allowed to stay on as hired employees, if they wanted. Although it disgusted Lucius, Harriet demanded that the Malfoys’ small workers were treated with at least a civil amount of respect and fair wages.
“Most mothers have an easier time in the birthing bed if they’re comfortable while they do their work. We’ll wait outside, Mr. Malfoy, when you need us, just call us and we’ll come in.” The midwife nodded.
However, when the omega turned around and saw the large, black box that sat on top of her nest, which still remained on Draco’s bed, her green eyes immediately snapped over to her alpha.
Despite the many adventures she had lived through during her life, Harriet hadn’t actually gotten to travel to many different places around the world.
“Thank you for coming so suddenly.” Draco explained, “There’s no one my family trusts more than you, healer Marigold.”
Draco had no idea how to get to a muggle hospital without apparating. Besides that, he didn’t even know what one looked like.
Once Harriet was finished, she picked up her wand and laid it against the parchment. Murmuring under her breath, a small light burst from her wand tip and turned the corner of the letter a very distinct shade of blue, which Harriet knew that Hermione would recognize.
“I…..I didn’t mean to lie! It was never supposed to be like this!” Harriet said defensively to Hermione.
Draco hurried around the room to find what he wanted. He had no desire to leave Harriet alone for any significant length of time.
She searched through her memory to find out why she had woken up in bed with the handsome, blonde alpha.
She didn’t allow herself to consider how good the alpha looked, standing there, tall and fit, in his black suit.
“You do, indeed, sir, although if your wife doesn’t make some drastic alterations to her lifestyle, I’m not sure how much longer that statement will be truthful.” The healer nodded seriously.
Careful not to put any weight on her, Draco bent over Harriet and let her lay her forehead against his as she whispered, “I want to have your pup right here, in our nest.”
Busy with their professional lives and each other, Draco and Harriet agreed on one issue, no children.
At intervals, he gently voiced his concerns to his suffering omega but whenever he mentioned anything about her appetite changes, whenever he asked her how she was feeling, or what else he could do to help her, Harriet responded by snapping hatefully at him or bursting into tears.
“I can’t leave my flat, the lease isn’t up yet.” Harriet said with a sigh, “Besides, what am I supposed to tell my friends?”
The baby had a peaceful sleep, but as the moon rose high in the sky, it was doubtful that either of his parents would see a single wink that night.
As Draco crashed into her over and over again, his fingers deftly slipped around the curve of her belly and found that bundle of nerves at the crest of her womanhood, as swollen and sensitive as the rest of her body. Kisses as frantic and rough as the motions of Draco’s fingers against Harriet’s pleasure spot flew back and forth between them and somewhere in their gasping, groaning display of passion, they both reached their peaks, crying out against each other. The sheets beneath them were soaked with the sweat of their exertion but neither of them cared.
Ron and Hermione both stood waiting to hear what she had to say, but as Harriet’s gaze flickered back and forth between the shocked, hurt looks on her friends faces, she was overwhelmed by guilt.
“You know, Potter,” Draco huffed, looking at Harriet directly, “You’ll be weak after the birth. You don’t have to run as soon as the child’s out.”
Despite the social pressure of the situation and the imposing intrusiveness of the many photographers' constantly flashing cameras, Harriet and Draco managed to push all of it out and focus on each other while they let the officiant lead them through their second set of vows.
Narcissa had lied during the war to protect Harriet, ultimately to protect Draco, but regardless of her true reasoning, if Narcissa hadn’t told her lie, Harriet would have never lived through the battle.
Harriet would never admit it, but as the birth grew closer, she doubted her decision more and more with each passing day.
If she and Draco hadn’t promised each other that they would reveal their secret to no one, she would have told her in an instant.
It was an unspoken, mutual agreement between the two of them that they were comfortable going public with their relationship at last.
Hermione just frowned at her friend. Although she did seem to process the shock better than Ron as her brown eyes returned to their normal size and she spoke, “That doesn’t matter now, Harriet. Look at you, we’re not stupid, you know. Why have you hidden from us?”
As the next couple of weeks passed, Draco’s progress towards securing Harriet’s affection and trust remained slow, but somewhat steady.
“Draco reassured me it’s perfectly safe. I wish we would have had something like this when he was born.” Narcissa retorted as she laid against her pillows and placed the ultrasound picture on the heavy, ebony nightstand beside the damask, canopy bed she shared with Lucius.
Whispers began to fly about why the most eligible, pure-blooded bachelor was shopping in a woman’s boutique, but Draco ignored the murmurings of the bystanders close to him.
Harriet hurriedly began to take off her clothes and slip into the new frock that her thoughtful alpha had selected for her.
As Harriet blew out a breath, the new grandmother gently lifted the little bundle out of Harriet’s arms to leave the omega free to grab Hermione and Draco’s hands.
In the fortnight that followed their trip, Draco realized how unreasonable he had become and he sought to restore pleasant normalcy to his and Harriet’s life.
Instead, Draco found himself forced to sit down at the writing desk in his large bedroom and write yet another letter to Potter inquiring why it hadn’t.
Regardless, for the past year, Draco and Harriet had been very strict about using the contraception charm when they made love.
The two couples met for meals and on occasion in the library or at house parties, but the dwelling was so grand that Draco had no trouble keeping a respectful distance from his parents, although the flat that he and Harriet had purchased still offered more privacy.
As Draco sucked and thrusted and teased at her sensitive, exposed bud with the tip of one skillful, velvety finger, Harriet’s mind went blank as she felt her arousal coil in the base of her swollen belly.
There coupling had been an expression of romantic bliss, their kisses had been genuine and their loving gazed had been honest.
Harriet groaned in displeasure and rustled around in the covers for a moment before she cracked her eyes open and blinked at her husband sitting at her side with their two tiny daughters.
He cupped one side of Harriet’s face and closed his eyes as she deepened their kiss. Over and over, their lips met while they snuggled together under the warm blankets on the bed.
Harriet’s dress had long sleeves of embellished, beaded lace that ran down to her wrists, a sweetheart neckline, and a mermaid-like cut that slipped over Harriet’s svelte figure with its voluminous skirts fanning out onto the floor like a fish’s tail.
The candlelight was soft and the food was excellent. While the enamored couple gazed at each other as they ate, they barely noticed the commotion in the background that came from hungry customers dining and chatting, and the service staff bustling about, filling orders and tending tables.
The two women giggled together and the baby let out a happy, little cry at the sound, delighted by the mirthful noise.
A thousand tempting fantasies ran through Draco’s mind of all the ways he could dishevel his lover, but they would have to wait.
“Yes, Draco. Hermione and Ron can’t take a baby with them where they’re going. It’s fine…..Rose is an infant, not a lion.” Harriet replied with a glare.
“It’s not the war, Draco!” Harriet retorted, “It’s everything! My family, your family! The implications….I….I think it would be better if the child was raised to be blissfully unaware.”
“Mr. Malfoy, all forms of birth are valid.” The teacher said firmly, “As I said, Caesarean section is rarely the first choice, but there are occasions where it is the best choice, and sometimes, it becomes the only choice. Surely you remember that the ultimate goal of a successful birth is to end with a healthy mother and a healthy baby.”
Draco was still asleep and Harriet wondered if that morning wasn’t the time at last to approach her husband and address the distance that had developed between them.
Harriet lay back against the pillows as Draco lavished her with the loving attention of an alpha, gently biting his way across her creamy, inner thighs. When Draco looked up, he memorized every change that had occurred to his mate’s body.
She hadn’t because she really wanted Draco to step in and save her, to be there for her, to be a father to their child, for them to raise the baby together…...
Between their secret ceremony by the waterfall, the feel of each other’s touch, and the cozy warmth of their room at the romantic inn, that night felt like a dream to Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy.
Her thin nightgown did little to hide her body and as her nipples bristled through the thin fabric, responding to the chill that came from her lifting her chest from the covers, Draco found his attention called away for a moment.
Once the order was totaled and the payment was processed, the cashier smiled at the couple as she remarked, “Congratulations! You both seem so in love, I’m sure you’ll give your little one a wonderful home!”
As she admired the quality of the garment, she realized that Draco meant for it to be a very special evening, indeed.
Perhaps it was due to his earlier struggles to find a way into Harriet’s heart and keep his pup, but Draco enjoyed seeing Harriet so heavy with his child that she could barely move.
Harriet’s green eyes widened and she turned around to see Draco looking at her with that confident smirk.
The amorous alpha waited until his little son was sleeping to claim Harriet and relieve the ache that fiercely burned inside them both.
Over the secretary’s shoulder, Draco peered into the room and as he did, the scene in front of him broke his heart.
Harritet knew she must be ridding her system of everything she had ever eaten in her life as that sickly, cold sweat caused her to tremble.
“For mating with Malfoy?” Hermione asked, “Harriet haven’t we always been there for each other? We would have stood beside you, we would have helped you. Promise me you won’t ever do this again?”
Draco sighed again and looked over at Harriet as he huffed, “No, Potter, of course I still want to marry you! But surely you can see, our wedding is going to be little more than a circus! Where’s the meaning? The entire thing is only for my parents to strut around telling everyone that their son’s mated with ‘The Chosen One’ and how redeemed House Malfoy and House Black have become! I want to marry you to show my love for you, to make that commitment to you, not to glorify my family names! It’s a mockery! I meant it as something beautiful, but they’ve ruined it now and it makes my stomach turn!”
“That’s inhumane!” Draco cried at the teacher, “That…...that omega…...! Look what they’re doing to her!”
Draco stood in the middle of the room, using his wand to meticulously position each glittering strand of an opulent crystal chandelier that hung from the ceiling.
Draco looked at his reflection in the mirror as he dressed for the day, pulling on his white shirt and black trousers.
Harriet turned to look at her husband and he smiled up at her softly with his grey eyes meltingly loving.
“The baby isn’t a Gryffindor, either.” Draco sniffed, standing by his rejection of Harriet’s suggestion that the blanket should be red and gold.
Harriet wouldn’t mind in the least if her child was unable to do magic but her guts clenched at the ostracization that she knew her son or daughter would receive from their only living grandparents if that ended up being their plight.
“Of course, Mr. Malfoy, but babies arrive on their schedule, not ours. At thirty-seven weeks, your baby should be able to safely arrive if he or she chooses. Labor can start anytime after that point.” The midwife nodded.
Draco moved forward, wanting with every fiber of his being to hold Harriet’s hand, but the secretary pushed him back when one of the healers turned towards the two in the doorway and shook their head in a firm, silent warning of “no”.
At last, after an agonizing sentence to a private, mental prison of doom and despair, the door that led to Harriet opened and a flurry of healthcare workers spilled out into the hallway.
When Scorpius started to fuss, Harriet moved to stand from the bed, but Draco quickly sat up and stopped her.
Their stay in the distant castle where they had been hosted by one of Lucius’s business contacts had been pleasant, but they were both anxious to get back to Malfoy Manor.
Draco positioned Harriet on the side of the bed and he moved behind her to lift his hands. Cautiously, Draco placed his palms on Harriet’s sore back and began to knead gently.
After nearly a year of seclusion, dodging letters, and avoiding conversations, to Harriet, a wedding sounded lovely.
Draco started to moan helplessly, rocking her hips rhythmically as Harry looked up and saw Dobby peering nervously into the room behind Scorpius.
“Do you think you’re having early contractions?” Draco asked as he immediately walked over and sat down on the side of the bed.
Little Scorpius had no idea about the magnitude at which he was being spoiled, but Harriet surmised that she would have to curtail Lucius and Narcissa’s doting at a point…….the last thing she wanted was for her son to grow to be as vile as Draco had been in his adolescence.
Hospitality was just as much an industry in the wizarding world as it was in the muggle one and the high prices of Siren’s Slip weren’t unwarranted.
The snitch unpredictably made a sharp right turn directly towards the wall of the stadium. The angle at which it moved made it impossible to capture safely. Harriet warily pulled back, but to her horror, Draco didn’t.
“I wasn’t a coward and I’m not a scoundrel either, Father!” Draco retorted, not flinching and not backing down as he stared into Lucius’s frigid, grey eyes, “I’m in love with her! Her rejection of me isn’t my choice! I want to marry Potter!”
Her heart was light and full and she was nearly on the brink of tears again as she pondered over Narcissa Malfoy’s words.
“Very well!” The man said as he opened up the envelope that he held and ordered the couple, “Kindly take each other’s hands and face one another, if you will.”
“Don’t worry about all of that now. Madam Pomfrey said you sustained a serious concussion…….She said you’re lucky that your skull didn’t crack open like an egg!” Harriet told Draco in a loud whisper.
“......Need you to move…” Harriet gasped as the feeling of being so pleasantly full returned at last.
Once Scorpius and Dobby were gone, Harry turned to his laboring wife and suddenly, the husband transformed into the healer, into the hero.
She peered to the left and found the lavatory, which was as sleek and as well-appointed as she expected.
Hermione sighed and took her friend's hand in hers as she looked at the omega across from her and asked, “Harriet, if he’s like that all the time, how can you possibly be relaxed? I’d have lost it if Ron acted like that.”
When Draco flipped the black, velvet ring box open, the glint of the chandeliers above the gothic dining table hit the brilliant ring inside with a blinding flash of light.
Once Harriet and Draco were left alone again in their bedroom, Harriet smiled at how focused her husband was as he read over the parchments.
While the midwife began to help Harriet with the afterbirth, Draco watched as his newborn began to squirm fussily in his mother’s arms.
His heart was pounding in his chest but he made sure that to his mate, he appeared perfectly confident and relaxed.
Harriet sat up and dried her face with her hands as she looked at Draco sheepishly and asked, “Sorry….I’ve…..I’ve been so out of sorts…....”
“Yes, I need you to calm down and relax. You’re not doing anyone a favor by staring at me.” Harriet replied.
Harriet felt like she wanted to scream and cry as the midwife and the healer let go of her and her baby and stepped away.
“I dunno……” Harriet replied as she shook her head, “I……..That was the first, I think…..it just woke me up out of nowhere.”
The trousers wrinkled and worse than that, their placement ruined the clean, rumple-free edges of the blankets that Harriet had taken the time to smooth out.
As she tried to recover from the last contraction and deal with the tremendous weight that threatened to snap her pelvis in two, Harriet had little memory of being moved.
“I can brew some fertility potion for us~.” Draco mused as he slipped his hand away from Harriet’s and pulled her into his loving grasp.
Draco didn’t allow Harriet to kiss him because he knew that if his lips touched hers, they’d never make it to dinner~.

Harriet moaned again less than a minute later and Draco took the silent nod from the midwife as he coaxed Harriet, “Come on, love, push again for us.”
Across the manor, Draco stood in his room while two house elves tended to him, straightening his suit, brushing minuscule fibers from his tie, and making sure every hair on his blonde head was in place.
Harriet thought Draco was exaggerating but a very short while later, she sat in front of him on the bed, happily eating off of the many silver platters the house elves had brought into the room, all of which were piled with arrays of different dishes.
Once Draco had left for the meeting and Harriet was alone in their room, she dressed herself and apparated straight to muggle London.
Draco looked down at Harriet once her tears had ceased. Harriet felt his gaze upon her and she turned her head to look up at him as well.
Draco had read that most omegas had little interest in sex during late pregnancy, but Hareiet seemed experience the opposite. Harriet’s desire for making love wasn’t lacking to begin with, although Draco noticed that the closer the birth drew, the more Harriet attempted to lure him into her nest for more than a cuddle.
He eventually reached his destination and walked up the steps to a brick townhouse which was positioned at the end of a long row of shops.
Although Harriet was some distance away, she was surprised that upon her arrival, she could already hear the noise from the quidditch stadium’s crowd as she walked up the hill towards Hogwarts.
Draco crossed his arms and shrugged, “So your plan to protect our little one involves keeping them frightened and confused until they’re eleven, only for them to inevitably learn they’re adopted, which will probably spur them to resent us both and come looking for us?”
She wasn’t sure which part she found more confusing…...The fact that Draco was so eager to care for a baby parented by two people he held such a great contempt for, or the wide smile of joy that was spread across his face while he did?
Once the midwife finished helping Harriet with the birth, she cleaned mother and baby, and settled Harriet so that she was resting comfortably with her newborn.

Harriet read the instructions in the envelope and shook the parcel until a small silver key slipped into her palm.
As they stood there, in the middle of their marriage ceremony, with the waterfall gushing behind them, it was a very powerful moment for both Draco and Harriet.
“Actually, Mr. Malfoy,” the midwife said with a new urgency in her voice, “Help me get her settled, will you?”
Now that she had revealed the surprise to her husband, she didn’t need to fight against her instincts anymore.
House elves had many tasks, some more pleasant than others, but transporting giggling babies was always an elf favorite.
“He’s our son, Lucius!” Narcissa snapped, looking at her husband with her own eyes narrowed, “That’s my baby boy! I don’t care about the betterment of the family business if it means hurting Draco! I only want to see him happy and this makes him happy! Are you that blind that you can’t see it?!”
Dr. Krause glanced between Draco and Harriet as she asked, “Would you two like me to tell you the gender?”
Minutes before the ceremony was slated to begin, Draco stood at the front of the ballroom, next to the wedding officiant, trying not to fidget as distant relatives, friends, dignitaries, government officials, and numerous journalists stared at him anxiously from their seats.
Lucius caught up with Draco in his bedroom. The door was open so the older Malfoy didn’t bother to knock as he entered.
The couple had bought a flat in Hogsmeade so they could escape whenever Harriet needed a break from Lucius, Narcissa, and Malfoy manor.
The only motherly affection that Harriet had ever received had been from Molly Weasley. That in itself had been wonderful, but that was before her current circumstances began. Harriet had wished so badly that she had a mother to talk to during the previous six months, a mother she could ask questions to, a mother she could seek advice from.
Enraged by his parents and still reeling from the nauseating realization of how close he had come to losing Harriet forever, Draco chose to act boldly as he stomped into the damask dining room.
To an outsider, Narcissa’s statement would have sounded ominous, but it wasn’t, it was just a pure and simple truth.
He respectfully stepped back while Harriet and Draco looked over the images and decided which photographs they most preferred.

“The girl is exhausted.” The healer explained, “Worry and fear have disrupted her body. She’s lacking hydration and rather poorly at the moment. I’ve given her a tonic and prescribed rest and fluids, though after my brief introduction to her, I doubt she’ll follow my advice.”
Lily and Narcissa looked at their beloved father curiously while he reached his arm around Lily to put a finger to his lips as he glanced between his daughters.
“Yes.” Mr. Roberts said with a bright smile, “I have one girl and one boy. They’re the light of my life.”
Since they became engaged, Harriet and Draco felt that their lives had turned into whirlwinds of anxious activity.
Harriet stood with her back to Draco, so he didn’t notice her posture as he came bursting through the shop’s door and sneered, not wasting the opportunity to finally speak his mind, “Hello? I’ve written you every day for six months begging for a talk and that’s all I get? Hello? Most alphas don’t beg, Potter! But that’s just how delicious I thought you were…...You should consider yourself rather lucky, you know. I certainly could have moved on by now.”
They made their way inside the hospital’s double doors and as they stood in the sterile hallway, looking at the reception desk while people scurried about, Draco reached out and grabbed Harriet’s hand so quickly that the action startled her.

After their harrowing journey, Harriet and Draco found the imaging department, checked in, and followed a nurse down the hallway.
He bent and captured her lips with his in a rough, deep kiss, his hands roamed her body, pinching and squeezing her curves as if owned them and finally, finally……..
What he had mentioned to Harriet during their languid moments in bed that one morning had been true.
Draco was attempting to hasten their last transaction as they stood at the register. Ever the attentive alpha, although Harriet didn’t complain, Draco could see in her green eyes that she was tiring.
With Harriet and Draco’s permission, their family portrait, one of the photographs without Draco’s suit jacket open, was published in The Daily Prophet, along with a formal, public statement from the wizarding world’s most unlikely couple.
“All I want to do is protect you both, surely you can’t fault me for that, Potter?” Draco purred as he bent his head and pressed another loving kiss to Harriet’s soft skin.
The books and pamphlets she and Draco had received had all warned that it may take much longer before their baby established any kind of consistent sleep pattern.
“I have my last ultrasound next week.” Harriet told Draco plainly, “They don’t usually do them this late, but since I missed a few doctors appointments, they want to have another look. I cast a spell earlier today to retrieve the messages left on the muggle phone line I had in my apartment.”
Harriet smiled as Draco turned his attention back to her belly. He began to kiss and nuzzle against her womb like he was trying to visit with their unborn son or daughter.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this story! I hope that you’ve enjoyed it! I do have a couple new Drarry fics that will be starting soon and if you enjoyed this one, I hope that you may consider checking them out if they interest you!
Harriet gently placed a hand across her breasts as she walked and as she grit her teeth from the uncomfortable sensation of her milk sloshing within, she realized that she was just as anxious to see Scorpius as he was to see her.
The ceremony itself was set to take place in the Malfoy ballroom, with an exquisite reception to follow in the manor’s parlors afterwards.
She and Draco had changed out of their wedding clothes before they could be seen, but both the bride and the groom were so very tired they nearly felt ill.
“You’ll have to forgive the mess.” The muggle man said with a smile to Draco as they sat down on the firm furniture, “We haven’t had a chance to clean today. The children have made this place a wreck! They’ve just been so excited…. It’s not often that we come to our city house.”
On her back, on her side, up against a wall, Draco didn’t care what position he had Harriet in, as long as he was able to invade her sensitive center and she enjoyed it, that was all that mattered to him.
It really alarmed Harriet one evening as she sat with her future in-laws, her alpha, and her infant son, at the dining table, eating dinner, when Draco suddenly paled and turned a ghastly shade of green.
Harriet wiped her eyes and nodded as she dared to let her hand fall away so she could look at Draco.
As she felt her next heat approaching one evening, she sat down with her alpha on the green velvet sofa in their bedroom and took his hand in hers.
Draco hadn’t expected that either of his parents would heed his words and actually attempt to welcome Harriet properly. Before Narcissa uttered a word, though, Draco knew by the smile on her red lips that he had been wrong.
Every nappy, every onesie was folded, stored, and in place, patiently awaiting the one who would use them.
Both women were a little uneasy as Narcissa slowly walked back to Harriet, but the softness in the older woman’s eyes as she gazed down at Harriet’s mounded tummy made the expecting omega much more comfortable.
As stubborn and determined as Harriet was, the life inside her didn’t have the same level of patience.
Harriet was terribly frightened for Draco as she dashed down the hallway with her eyes wide and her hands trembling.
“Daddy thinks that it’s time for Mummy to stay home.” Draco said with a dark frown as he lifted his eyes up to meet Harriet’s.
Draco swallowed hard as he felt unwelcome tears spring to his eyes. He had to battle hard against the urge to let the proof of his emotion drop down his cheeks as Harriet looked up and asked, “Draco, love? What’s the matter?”
