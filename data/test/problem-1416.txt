“Come along, then. Back to the library.”
It took them both a while longer to recover this time, but eventually they got back to the process of cleaning up and putting their clothes on again.
Harry looked at him then, which was somewhat a mistake, as they were very close.
“Harry…?” His voice was hushed and low in the large room.
People tended to pay more attention to a drunk person when that person was Harry Potter.
“Or,” he offered, with a flippancy far too dangerously smooth. “I could always more thoroughly demonstrate my gratitude later tonight.”
“If you’re about to thank me again, you can stop now.”
Harry hoped he was right. The Dementors lately seemed to be growing in number once more, and though he had no real way of knowing why things got worse or better, it was wearing on Harry to be clearing them out of the same places over and over, with no improvement in sight.
Harry wrote back to suggest an afternoon in mid-April for their meeting, and Malfoy agreed. In the week proceeding, he’d gone back to the attic, retrieving Malfoy’s Portkey from his trunk and preparing a few other things as well, including an ordinary Muggle tent, perhaps a bit old fashioned with its canvas and rope, but it would do for a practice run.
“That’s true,” Harry conceded, a smile quirking at his lips.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He waited about a minute, but when Draco didn’t answer he went back to reading. It was another ten before he received a reply.
“It’s not much of one. It needs a lot of work, but I’ve got a few things.”
“Morning, Potter,” he murmured.
“Wait
The Portkey was, to Harry’s surprise, an actual key. Tarnished and worn at the edges, the skeleton key felt heavy in his hand when he unwound it from the parchment scroll. He could already hear Ginny in his head telling him he ought to check it for curses—and he’d had too horrible an experience with Portkeys in the past not to be absolutely
Harry kissed him with everything he was feeling as he shuddered and rocked through his orgasm in Harry’s lap.
He quickly pulled his fingers free, leaving Draco gasping more as Harry whispered a spell to slick himself thoroughly. Then he was easing in past the head with several shaky breaths of his own. His cock was intensely tender, a touch angry at the overstimulation, but ached with the lust burning powerfully in him when he pushed through dangerously indecent tightness.
Should he admit he’d gone into the forest? Should he even mention Malfoy?
He never let up, until Draco tightened deliberately on Harry’s cock and his rhythm stuttered.
It was hard to know where things had gone so wildly off track with him and Ginny—nevertheless, Harry knew beyond a doubt that fucking Draco Malfoy on the side was probably not the best way to repair his floundering relationship.
“You knew my brother.”
“Took them about nine hours to heal it and it’s still not completely gone away. Healer said it shouldn’t scar though.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He nearly tripped over his own feet trying to turn around, but of course Draco didn’t stumble.
And Draco somehow managed to turn Harry on just lithely standing to offer him a hand up. Probably it had something to do with the crotch of Draco’s trousers being right in front of his face just then, and his throat being still slightly raw from Draco’s cock fucking it.
“You’re obviously rubbing off on me.”

Her warning look only confirmed his suspicions. “Oh… Harry that’s so
“I didn’t realise I was meant to be entertaining you.”
He was meeting Ron and Hermione at their flat that night, and with Ginny still out of town it would be only the three of them. Inevitably as the evening approached his mind raced with thoughts about what all they might be wanting to discuss, and in particular if it had anything to do with the fact he had been collaborating with Draco Malfoy.
Draco repeated himself, louder, but it didn't do more than get a few taunts thrown in his direction instead. He considered pulling out his wand to jinx them, but the younger years were already moving on, talking animatedly amongst themselves, and really, how many would Draco have to jinx to keep it from spreading throughout the school in a matter of hours? He doubted he could get them all before Rosier Stunned him or worse.
And McGonagall apparently intended to push forward without a backward glance.

"Of course not, dear boy!" said Flitwick, looking revitalized and equally in his element. "It's all in good fun!"
"Oh, shit," said Sirius.
"Of course, it is!" Harry snapped back, pushing Malfoy away from him with a hard, one-handed thrust. He was panting, his vision still blurry, but now it was a blur of red. "The last time I flew— the Fiendfyre was

The badger was a little disproportionate, its left side a little chubbier than its right, its ears a bit too big and tail oddly curly and off-colored, but it wasn't bad considering Wormtail hadn't scraped together a good enough O.W.L. score in transfiguration to continue to N.E.W.T. level.
"And I name Severus Snape!" said Flitwick.
Harry crossed his arms defensively and muttered, "Sirius can stand up for himself."
"You don't trust me," he said, his voice sounding far away and very, very angry. "That's fine. I don't
Something cold and leaden dropped in James's stomach.
They made their way to their usual table in the restricted section. Madam Pince didn't even ask to see their permission slip from Dumbledore every single time anymore.
"Harry…"
He himself had no idea why Harry had said
It was better than pretending they were friends and using first names.
"So, you believe it then?" Peter asked Sirius, awed. "That he really did survive a Killing Curse?"
Thoughts aswirl, Harry arduously made his way back to his feet. His ribs were broken. He was cut, burnt, and bruised. Why hadn't his injuries faded in death?
"There was this power coming from him I'd never felt before," Draco finished. "And, somehow, with those words, I think it reacted to what he said."
He mostly seemed to be in shock.
"It must have," he said automatically, bristling against the idea that the answer could be anything else. "I mean, a whole school, we'd have heard about it if…"
"No problem," said Harry, releasing the

It had taken some time for them to figure out what was different, but once Peter had pointed it out with all the acumen of a prey animal, it was undeniable.

this time?"
When Malfoy had asked after them and the catastrophic arrest, Harry hadn't been able to reply at all.
"Independent study of practical applications of theoretical magic," said Malfoy with a smirk.
Yes, he had been naked last time he had died, too, he recalled.
"I think we can both agree Sirius was in the wrong," said Remus, leaning forward and speaking more quietly, "but we don't want anything
"I heard you had— oh!" she said and set upon McKinnon like a wolf on a fresh carcass.
He led the way down the long, elegant driveway, Hermione on his right and Ron on his left.
"Said they let their house elf go three weeks ago, and then Midge put in overtime in her volunteer work at the Muggle-born outreach program."
Severus and Draco stared at one another.
Knockturn Alley. It's just… wrong."
It stung. Draco couldn't pretend even to himself that it didn't, but he couldn't show it. Severus wasn't his godfather— not yet. He was just a clueless teenager trying to survive school in the Slytherin house. He didn't owe Draco anything.
"Oh, good!" said Lily, brightening. "I'm glad. You've been far too gloomy since you got here."
Slytherin sixth years were grouped together in much the same way. And though they attempted subtlety, they were overwhelmingly more obvious as they pointed— got their hand slapped down— and exclaimed a word or two of surprise only to be immediately shushed by the rest of the group, who then cast twitchy glances around to see if anybody was watching them.
Two of the three meandered to a stop on the sidewalk, apparently engaged in a quiet conversation, while the third went ahead to the shop door. He knocked.

going to be doing this.”
“Leave my hair out of this. I’m hungry, and you’ve promised breakfast.”
“What?” Harry queried, but he followed Draco, who didn’t dignify Harry’s curiosity with an answer just yet.
“Drop your pants then, Malfoy.”
“You’re verging on flattery now.”
He’d received Draco’s reply that afternoon, only a few hours later:
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Hush.” He started undoing Harry's jeans by hand, and didn’t even complain about having to tug the metal zipper down. He wasted no time quickly dragging them, pants included, down past Harry's hips and lower, all the way to his ankles. Then he pressed Harry’s knees out, spreading his legs more.
Glancing quickly away, Harry reached out to take the offered bottle. He was apparently reckless enough to drink a completely unknown potion, sight unseen—so long as it didn’t cause Malfoy to drop dead on the spot.
They tossed a stone in and it rattled about in the bottom as though it were in a much larger box. It wasn’t as big as it was meant to be, and had clearly retained the same dimensions inside as well, all but the depth of it. On the other hand, it hadn’t become confetti, so they could always try again.
Pale fingers brushed lightly over sensitive skin, and Harry hissed a breath, but then he was smirking a bit proudly.
Life went on for Harry, for the most part.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
It was as he stood there watching Draco frowning again over the mess of Harry’s notes, that some thread of control just barely hanging on in Harry snapped free—and he thoughtlessly blurted his next question, completely unprompted by anything they had just been talking about.
“They’re invisible. Make your head all fuzzy if you don’t run them off now and then.”
“I heard you might be willing to help us sort some of the appalling conditions in this city.”
. He'd had to extinguish the pepper shaker that afternoon.
Well. He wasn’t thinking about it
“It’s safe here,” was the best explanation Harry could come up with.
Draco hesitated. Harry watched him think—and wished he could know what it was about.
“If you’re providing tea, I suppose I could linger a while longer. I can’t stay all day, the—”
Hi! It took me a bit longer to get this chapter out but I got sidetracked writing some things for down the line and getting the timeline in order.
He moaned low around Draco’s cock, and Draco moaned back, more distraughtly. Harry only noticed then that he was still gently working his vibrating wand, as Draco’s spent cock twitched overwhelmed on Harry’s tongue.
“Prat.” Harry was buttoning his shirt, already heading toward the bedroom door—but he hesitated. “Talk to you later?”
Harry repeated the slap on his other cheek, both sides now flushing faint pink. Then he did it again, and again.
Harry cleared his throat, and tried for a reassuring smile.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“If something goes wrong, we’ll sort it out. We have so far, haven’t we?”
“Sorry I have eyes, Malfoy. I didn’t realise looking at you was so offensive.”
“Oh.” Harry drew in a very deep breath at the thought.
“I’m engaged, and I can’t stop cheating. When I do feel guilty it’s not enough to stop. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“That’s a funny story, actually—”
actually possible.”
Draco laughed at him, low and unusually buoyant as he spun around to take the stairs properly and Harry helpfully palmed Draco’s arse again, pushing him in the right direction.
Only a week later, Harry had drinks with Neville and Hannah both, and not just with them either—but rather a lot of people.
A furrow of familiar irritation overtook Ron’s ginger brow. “She’s just fine. Busy. Are we flying or not?”
Harry barely managed to get them through the front door, leaving his umbrella lying open on the front step as he slammed it shut behind them.
“Go on, Potter. Suck me off—you could use the practice.”
He tried to send a message on the blackboard first, but he hadn’t answered, and Harry was too impatient then to wait around. It was also possible he was eager to share a bit more than his improved casting.
“I suppose I’ll take that as a compliment,” Draco drawled— and sunk down to straddle Harry’s lap where he kneeled on the floor.
He felt some small amount of satisfaction that he had not warned Malfoy beforehand.
He waved for Savage when a dark hulk drifted out from a nearby alley—followed shortly by another, and another after. They both slipped their wands from their pockets as they crept nearer, as quietly as they could—unfortunately, the small crowd of wraiths all seemed to sense their presence the moment they got within range.
Harry could not have denied him—and there was something deliriously indecent about the perfect heat tightening around his cock as he pressed in.
Merlin this was awkward.
Even with several days off he was struggling to sleep, and spent probably too much of the time in his chair by the fireplace, or up in the attic practicing spells—among other things.
“I’ll save the date,” Draco drawled.
He was lucky they were managing to do it all while Ginny was out of town, as there would’ve been no way for him to explain away his sitting room floor being covered in tent bags last night. It had taken him several hours to shrink them all down small enough to fit into the one bag.
“Does that get you all hot and bothered, Potter?”
They considered a few solutions between them, but in the end went with Draco’s proposal of tying each one to an individual passive glow charm on an enchanted pull-cord.
The realisation hit Harry like a bolt of lightning. “I need to touch you.”
Licking down the curve of Draco’s throat, Harry moaned, chasing faded traces of raindrops.
It had been somewhat of an adjustment coming to work in a place where he’d not only nearly been murdered, but also lost his godfather.  He continued to be struck surreally with an unnerving twist whenever he caught glimpses of the rooms and corridors missed in the Ministry’s hurry to renovate away some of its more reprehensible changes.
When they finally pulled their lips apart, Harry’s head tipped back to breathe, and a bit of paint dropped down onto his cheek.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“What about security?” Harry prompted. They were running short on time.
It took Harry far too long to remember what he was meant to be telling him, let alone what his idea had been in the first place.
Harry opened his mouth to argue— he had a
"What are you saying?" Harry asked, breathing raggedly as he tried to push his demons away.
Harry shuffled under his new Hogwarts robes and rubbed at his hair. It felt weird. He hadn't had hair this shaggy since fourth year, and he certainly wasn't used to seeing straw-blond wisps out of the corner of his eye.
Harry knew it would do no good. Perhaps Gertrude had died more than twenty years ago, and perhaps this was her version of Hell. He doubted a healer could help. Nevertheless, he looked around and said,
He wouldn't be in any danger, and he'd likely take all the credit afterwards if they caught that sadistic maniac Dolohov.
He wanted to see Remus have fun with the friends he had spoken of so fondly, friends he had missed so terribly.
He screwed his eyes shut and pressed the heels of his hands into them, trying to force the pictures out from behind his eyelids, but it was no use. He could still see Ron and Hermione. He could still
Lily's had been made of willow and good for charms, Ollivander had said. James's had been mahogany and a powerful tool for transfiguration.
James and Lily both pulled Remus, Sirius, and Peter to help them clean up the mess from their fireworks display, leaving Harry to find his own way to the seventh-year Gryffindor dorm.
Harry took it and wrapped it around himself with a vague sense of amusement and befuddlement. It was warm from Malfoy's body heat, heavy with the weight of expensive fabric, and lined with something surprising soft. He pulled it a little tighter, appreciative. "Thanks, Fake-Malfoy. Come on."
Harry's chair and desk had been blasted out of his way, knocking into his neighbors'.
Harry wished more than anything he could change who Wormtail would become, more than Sirius, more than Remus, more even than his own father.

, James. So, why were they acting like… like it was a matter of life or death?"
Every time Draco or Severus had insulted his father in previous years, Harry had rallied to the man's defense like James Potter was some kind of hero. No matter how many detentions Snape had given or how many points he took, Potter had always stood up for his father's honor.
Draco, nauseated, missed what Dolohov said, but he heard Harry clearly. Harry spoke in a way Draco had never heard before, in a tone stern and unyielding as the universe itself. Power seemed to radiate from him like he was the eye of a storm, wild, barely-leashed violence,
Draco took a deep breath and, as specifically as he was able without revealing too much of the future, explained to Dumbledore exactly what had led up to their return to the past.
"That's the corner of Gimmick Street and MacDungeon," Draco interrupted, pointing to the signs.
Dolohov sneered, wrath and madness warring for dominance on his face.
It felt empty to Harry and far away, like a half-forgotten dream. The last few Sortings he had actually attended, the hat had been outright political and dire in its speeches.
He smelled smoke, felt warm blood on his hands. He heard screaming.
Harry thought of Ron and Hermione, unmoving. They'd stayed by his side to the very end. It was
"What I mean is," said Draco, determinedly keeping his composure despite his embarrassment over the words coming out of his mouth, "Potter keeps muttering about 'moving on' and seeing his friends and family again. Maybe his magic reacted to stop Dolohov from killing McKinnon, but maybe… maybe it wanted to let him see… certain people… again."
He didn't know Draco owed him everything.
It started as a tiny giggle that he managed to force back down. Then his shoulders were shaking with the effort of holding it back, and his eyes were tearing up, and he was doubling over….
He just— Regulus had
Harry's heart twinged again. He glanced between Lily and James, one bright and hopeful, the other working furiously on his letter, and then at Sirius, who was adding a layer of cheese to his absurdly tall bagel.

She reminded Harry not of Bellatrix, but of Andromeda. They were similar, but so very, very different. He suddenly wished Sirius had told him about her, this girl who had been such a nuisance to Voldemort that he'd had her entire family annihilated.
It wasn't that dark, wild look of a prankster with a chip on his shoulder. Something in it had shifted, edging deeper into the darkness and away from the wildness. It was more calculating, watchful…

Harry wondered if Malfoy felt as mortified by their awkward goodbye as he did.
Harry rolled his eyes. In doing so, he caught a glimpse of gold near the ceiling, close to the head table, and had to stop himself from turning toward it like a hunting dog.
Sirius stepped up, his face lit with excitement. They bowed to each other.
"After you, then, good sir," said Bowie.
"Fuckers," said Sirius, looking to Remus and Harry in betrayal. "Absolute, manipulative traitors. I can't believe you landed in Gryffindor, either of you."

"Huh?"
"Ah, Parker," said a voice at once very familiar and oddly foreign. "Not trying out for Gryffindor?"
"—Second, you are now Gryffindor's new Seeker—"
'd the first Death Eater standing watch before he could even look up at the sudden commotion. Then he and the second Death Eater were dueling with a vengeance.
"Fine," said Harry tightly. "Why not. The Headmaster's office has a Floo."
Harry Parker was staring at Sirius in horrid fascination. His expression darkened at the mention of Snivellus, though, and took a disapproving hue.
Ever since they had met in Harry's third year, and especially later, after Sirius had fallen at the Department of Mysteries, Remus had always been enough. He wasn't Harry's father or even godfather, but he had always been a friend.
, and hurried to lunch, mustering as much dignity and impassivity as he could.
Remus was all the seventh year Gryffindor boys could handle. Anymore bookishness now, and they might as well cancel the graduating class altogether.
It was hard to pinpoint the exact moment he'd realized the duel was getting out of hand. Part of the problem was Sirius's innate dueling style: He was aggressive and had a huge arsenal of offensive spells at his beck and call. His reaction time and willingness to fight back under pressure were two of the things that made him an excellent duelist

Much like Harry, Snape had been one of Dumbledore's tools in the war. They might have even been his two best tools.
Ah, well.
"Still can be," muttered Harry darkly. "If you ever call my mother a Mudblood again, I'll blast you through those goal posts faster than a Quaffle after a spin-slap."
"Splendid, splendid!" said Flitwick. "I do love a bit of theater."
"Ew, gross, no, no more of that," said Harry, pressing his eyes behind his glasses as if that could rid the image of Snape waxing poetic about his teenage mother from them. "Besides that, I'll still pissed at you. What were you thinking, casting that spell at Sirius? I've only ever seen Voldemort use that one. You could have

“International Statute of Secrecy. First Edition?” She flipped open the tattered front cover only to freeze. “Property of the
“Have you got anything to make it a bit more interesting?” Draco queried critically.
Shoving him down into the cushions, Draco kissed him back so furiously deep Harry was left gasping under him, then he shifted his hips, rocking into just the right place, and they both groaned.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Seems harmless enough. ‘Certainly cares about her work… hard to argue she’d have any motivation not to help.” Draco sighed. “But it’s hardly a sure thing, is it?”
“If you want to fuck me now, you’ll need to do it before I come without you.”
Harry kissed him harder, until Draco growled quietly against his lips, and shoved him back against one of the wooden ladders leading up to the library’s second level. Its steps’ sharp edges dug into Harry’s back, and he winced, but Draco was biting at his ear now and he moaned out an embarrassingly desperate sound.
They fell into silence for a time, as most of his focus went into completely relearning how to eat soup. Eventually and inevitably though, his mind wandered.
It was good enough—though the prospect of meeting with Malfoy again was triggering that anxious flipping in his stomach, a feeling which persisted all through the few short hours it took to receive a response.
“Er—I think it says ‘dignity and privacy’, maybe.”
Harry stared at him with shock and growing horror. “Oh.”
Just as they were stood watching, a number of men and a small family joined the end of the line. They all appeared to be perfectly ordinary Muggles, queuing politely, and none seemingly inclined to so much as cut the line. Only as they drew closer did it become apparent to Harry why the Dementors had found this particular queue so appetising.
The last had been Draco’s, and after a final inspection they stood together in its small kitchen, sharing a moment of weary relief. Though they were marking the end of only one portion of all the work they had yet to do, Draco was right that it was well worth celebrating, and he was quick to summon what they would need for a proper good time.
Draco’s voice held a low edge of promise that drove Harry to pushing off the shed, walking him backward right through the back door and against the kitchen table.
They got so distracted kissing once or twice, they forgot to move their hips entirely, but eventually the pressure of pleasure and tension was too much to take, and he found himself thrusting up steadily harder.
As they ventured past them, Harry observed a lot of superfluous founts of woven and embroidered blood splashing about. Of course, some of them were quite pretty too, twinkling placidly with stars, or streaked by the white blur of a galloping blessing of unicorns.
“It’s going alright, all things considered. D’you mind if I close the door? For the magic, you know.”
“Shut up, Potter.”
Malfoy froze in the midst of tucking away his wand to stare at Harry, a flash of real uncertainty on normally guarded features.
He spotted them underneath the desk.
Minerva stopped to give him a hug, asking after Ginny, Ron and Hermione as well. He’d also walked by Neville—but as he was clearly busy chatting up Hannah, Harry had decided not to interrupt.
“Not at all,” Harry confessed. “But I’m sure you do, so that’s fine. You’re saying we don’t need the curtains for stability?”
“Potter, I can’t actually—”
Ron and Hermione exchanged a look—Ron’s a bit pained. Harry recalled hearing his stomach grumbling throughout a few of the quieter moments. He’d nearly laughed aloud at it once, which would have been quite awkward given the circumstances.
Harry fucked him with mounting abandon, reaching an apex of heat and spilling inside Draco—riding a badly needed spike of bliss with two final artless pumps of his hips.
“Sorry. Just—sorry. You’re right, we ought to head back.”
Harry was absolutely not allowing himself to be miffed that the letter had been so curt. Although in retrospect, he wasn’t sure what he might’ve expected Malfoy to have written instead.
Some of Harry’s tension eased then too—that whatever wild nonsense they had got up to, it wasn’t going to impact the project. That was important to him.
As morning dawned on that bright and cool October day, it was actually quite a big day for him, as it marked the one-year anniversary of the start of his Auror training, and as such, the first day he would be allowed to do more than purely theoretical Auror work. He only hoped the lack of a good night’s rest would not catch up to him.
Draco was silent a moment before he answered, reluctantly. “I don’t suppose you want to talk about whatever it is you’re trying to forget?”
“Fucking perfect,” Draco murmured, so low that Harry barely heard him.
. He let out a long, frustrated moan.
Peering anxiously at her office door, Cassie lowered her voice to a hush.
Given it was a birthday present and all, Harry thought the least he could do was make it last a bit.
“Smells like honey,” Harry pointed out casually. It felt thick like honey too, but it stuck where Draco smeared it, and didn’t drip down his face at all.
“Of course. I’ll owl you then, when I’ve got some of these enchantments in a workable order. And we both ought to practice the base—just be certain to use an Undetectable clause when you ward off wherever you’re practicing.”
Harry watched him take a short sip of his drink, stubbornly staring out at the ever-chattering mass of Ministry members in their formal attire, some of the most powerful witches and wizards in Britain together in one room. In many respects, the antithesis of the world occupying their current conversation.
“Lovegood’s mad as a hatter, you could always ask her.”
“I’ve been thinking we ought to convert one of the tents into a sort of office. We’ll need to be in and out fairly regularly, and we’ll need an Apparation point that’s secure and out of sight. Having one on premises would be ideal.”
“The bed is comfortable enough, though the sheets could stand to be softer.”
Harry was still licking his lips and trying to refocus his vision when Draco Disapparated in front of him. It was a little dizzying, and he’d let out a powerfully exasperated huff just before he followed, joining him once again at the gates to Malfoy Manor.
He caught her hand, kissing the simple gold band on her left ring finger, and Ginny smiled a genuine, soft sort of smile at him.
“I will,” Draco drawled, and Harry believed him.
Draco sucked at his tongue, until Harry thrust up searchingly and sent the blond man shuddering forward, panting into Harry’s shoulder. Every roll of Draco’s hips was punctuated by Harry’s groans.
“Everything I can recall without looking at my infinitesimally small notes.”
All of Draco’s shushing went out the window then, whining a loud, desperate sound into Harry’s mouth, his words coming in far more breathless gasps.
Harry didn’t really need to hear what the ‘or’ was.
Harry had gone to look over Hermione’s notes again—but then Draco offered to cast the Protean Charm on the push-lights for Harry, so that Harry could concentrate on getting more familiar with the modified Extension spell, as well as the new layers Draco had added since the last time they’d worked on things.
Pressed closely to so much bare skin, he nearly gave in to the temptation to start touching him, but they were wearing a lot of residual mess after last night. Harry didn’t mind the mess most of the time, but this was a bit excessive even for him.
They met in the middle as everything set up all around them, a flurry of clinking and clicking and rustling fabric.
“That’s the bliss. Surely you must feel it by now.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
he hissed in breathless Parseltongue.
“What the hell did you just say?”
Harry knew his tantrum was ridiculous.
“Here’s what I’ve been able to find in our library. It’s not everything that I’ve got but it will get you started. Essentially—”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
For a few weeks in June Harry spent too much of his time sat at his cubicle filling out reports, working out long scrolls of parchment on theory, or simply studying. He would sometimes do Draco’s reading at work too, though for the time being, with Ginny home, his spell practice was relegated to what little time he could get to himself in the attic.
, Potter?”
Once he’d swallowed most everything properly, Draco slithered up to kiss him for a long while and it was absolutely wonderful—until Harry abruptly yawned into the kiss.
After several long beats of silence, Draco finally answered him, an obvious discontent in his tone.
Neither of them seemed to have a clue how to get over the awkwardness of their last encounter.
Draco shrugged.
Rising up on his knees, Harry licked his lips, and touched the very tip of his wand to the exposed pink pucker of Draco’s arse.
“Practice makes perfect, didn’t you say?” Harry murmured contentedly.
“Happy birthday,” Draco teased with dark amusement.
“Someone’s decorator went overboard,” Harry announced, joining her at the edge of the room and nodding towards the chandelier hovering above them all, its crystals tinselled with glowing pixies.
“You’re breaking your own rules now.”
Experimentally, Harry wiggled his wand, tickling its vibrating tip over the small center of nerves, admiring the tensing tremble of pale thighs, and the hold of Draco’s arse on the slim wood of his wand as it penetrated him.
Draco’s wand-point stilled on his shirtsleeve, and he pulled a slight scowl. “Yes, you really should’ve.”
“That’s more information than I needed.”
Harry didn’t press, but nodded understanding, fighting off an absurd urge to start stroking at his hair. Draco looked annoyed, Harry really didn’t want to get snapped at again.
“You did.”
Shifting up behind him to thrust back inside, he watched an unadulterated pleasure beautifully contort Draco’s conceit as he slid in properly deep.
Draco scoffed at the idea.
“You’re certain? This is going to be a lot of work.”
Draco considered him seriously a moment, then began tracing his fingers through Harry’s hair in soft careful movements, sending an overwhelming sort of pleasant contentment washing over him, far too soothing to resist.
Harry drew in a steadying breath.
It was too vivid and purposeful for a normal dream, but Harry felt none of the telling burn in his old scar that might indicate this had anything to do with Voldemort. In fact, he felt perfectly fine, despite having slept so fitfully.
“Yes,” Draco expelled, cursing breathless when he rubbed hard again. “
For all the time he’d had to come up with a good excuse, it didn’t come out very convincing.
“So you speak French?”
As always, Harry felt an irrational pang of guilt that he had not been able to save him, and how many lives he might have saved and changed if he’d just been able to kill the bastard a little sooner or more efficiently. Mostly he knew in his heart no one blamed him for all the deaths—still sometimes Harry couldn’t help blaming himself.
Malfoy sighed at the nervous look on Harry’s face.
“It is a bit busy, isn’t it?”
Harry’s coherency was reduced to a moan. Draco really was trying to test his stamina. He coiled an arm around Harry’s shoulders for balance, lifting himself up to sit on the edge of the desk, and Harry moved too quickly working Draco’s thighs apart. Only belatedly did it occur to him he didn’t know what he was doing after that.
The War had left its impact on all of them, one way or the other. That first year there had been too many funerals, and what had felt to Harry then like an overload of loss.
According to Draco, but that was hardly a good enough excuse for all his inappropriate behavior. There was no real excuse for the cheating, hence why he so often buried it unexamined. When he couldn’t even manage justifying it to himself, how was he meant to explain it to anyone else?
“See you in a month.”
“We could try it out on the first one, see how it goes?”
Draco had to rinse before he answered. “Shut up. Let’s go to bed.”
Harry hurried more than strictly necessary to step out of his trousers. He sat down naked on the end of the bed, and when Draco pushed him back flat he groaned for another reason entirely, wriggling up higher toward the center of the mattress.
Of course, the bill was a bit of a shock. He had a fair amount of cash leftover after his tent purchasing spree, and could more than cover it, but he couldn’t help feeling slightly offended on principle anyway.
“We were never exclusive, Potter. You’ve never even bothered to ask.”
“Potter, wait. You’re not quite…no, here—”
“Not at all. Er—I could bring it in then, if you’d like?”
Harry nearly lost focus mid-spell when he swung open the tall doors, allowing the orange glow of late afternoon to bounce off the room’s many mirrors, painting their multitude of tents in warm light.
“We are for being here,” Harry muttered, and gave the door a solid push.
“Ah—that’s a useful one.”
He shifted over him as they worked their trousers down again, only as much as necessary to press their cocks tight together. They exchanged quiet moans, mixed pain and pleasure as Draco slowly put most of his weight into the press of their hips, and together they rocked a hard-steady pressure, until Draco gasped and came all over Harry, all over again.
“I made soup earlier,” he drawled casually, waving to a small cauldron over the fire which was now slowly heating up. “If that’s alright.”
Draco let his knees fall open a bit wider, and quirked one eyebrow, idly expectant. “Go on then.”
Beyond knowing it was probably fish, he had no way of knowing what he’d ordered. When he asked, Draco only told him in French which, while admittedly amusing, was not at all helpful.
When Harry finally bothered to look around at the rest of the room, all the furniture was where it was meant to be in the mostly-dark, windowless library.
“We’ll have to practice even more as we add in the extra layers—so no faffing about, Potter.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I know,” he muttered, almost more to himself, as he prepared to Apparate home. “I am trying.”
“I have another proposition for you. An exchange, of sorts.”
Before Harry could formulate a single word in reply, Draco lifted his hips, and took Harry’s cock into himself all over again.
As the half-hardness of their cocks pressed together in the constant unhurried rock of their hips, they both moaned, during and between all the kissing.
“I’ve been thinking.”
It was somewhat frustrating that despite waving the majority of the entrance testing and school requirements Harry would’ve needed to qualify as an Auror in the first place, the Ministry still made him wait through the customary first year of classes and theory before they would allow him to participate in any field work. Ironically one of the only things all of the theory he was studying agreed upon was there being no real substitute for experience in the field. Many of the skills an Auror would need could only properly be learned by doing, and obviously Harry had done plenty of doing already.
"It is not
Harry did not answer at first, underlining the bit about permanency before he glanced up from his notebook. The thought did cross his mind that Cassie and Hermione would likely get on quite well.
Harry continued slowly catching his breath as he thought it over. “Unless you’d like tea?”
“Wouldn’t surprise me. They’ve been branching out farther into London recently.”
Draco waited for him to catch back up to reality before he spoke, his chin settling pointily on Harry’s shoulder as he peered out at the bit of kitchen behind them.
Even better, if his experience over these last several weekends with Draco was any indication, he was potentially on the verge of several nights in a row of restful and dreamless sleep—a powerfully alluring notion.
“I do. It’s also one of the biggest rooms in the manor, which is why we’re here. Now let’s get on with the unshrinking, it’s going to be an arduous fucking marathon as it is.”
“Not now. Hold still. I’m attempting to take your measurements.”
“That’s not what I meant, Malfoy.”
“You ought to see my desk at the Ministry,” Harry sympathised.
“Morning,” Harry greeted in a hushed voice.
Standing just behind him, Harry was yawning.
Perhaps ‘lucky’ had been the wrong word, but Harry was too far drunk to bother choosing his words more carefully. It still sounded to him like Malfoy was just feeling sorry for himself.
The Dementors always managed to surface his mother’s dying screams. Harry had taught himself to hold them off some, if he could concentrate enough to put up a few Occlumency walls then he could work around it just fine, though he could always hear her, and it was always just a little bit heart-breaking.
He knew they couldn’t stay there, of course they couldn’t, but Harry also didn’t know how he was meant to pretend everything was normal, when everything suddenly felt so very far from it.
It had never occurred to Harry once in all these years that Draco might’ve cared for Dobby at all. “I’m sorry, Draco.”
In the tent’s dim bedroom, the world narrowed for a time, both men rather lost in their fleeting closeness.
If Ginny minded how long it was taking to make the place tolerable to live in, she hadn’t ever said so, at least not to him, but Harry still felt a bit bad about it. He did his best to make time to keep up with the repairs, when he wasn’t occupied working his way through Auror training, classes, and workshops.
,” Hermione concluded, likely none of which was what Ron had intended to say.
“No, obviously. We’ll need a bit more room. You have them all with you?”
“Do you think it would be alright if I—”
“…marginally.”
“We’ve fallen a bit behind where I’d hoped we’d be by now, but if we can make it to midnight we’ll be on track again.”
“Of course I do,” Draco huffed. “Put your fucking bits away, your cock is distracting.”
Harry was a bit offended. “I’ve heard plenty of gossip over the years. A lot of it was about me…Although I do recall hearing something in fifth year about you snogging some Ravenclaw bloke in the Astronomy Tower—what was his name again?”
Apparently not having words, Draco settled for snogging him, bitingly, for several blissful minutes before he finally released his hold on Harry’s shoulders to let him sit up.
Harry caught him by the hips and worked Draco’s pants further down his thighs, giving himself better access to sweep his tongue along the soft curve of Draco’s balls.
“Right… listen, Harry, there’s been a bit of an emergency in Holyhead. Duke’s had an injury, and they’ll need me to be there if they’re meant to run these new plays…”
be okay."
James leaned back against the tank of the toilet, which he had claimed like a throne as the undisputed leader of the Marauders.
Draco could scarcely sit still for the giddiness swirling inside him.
would do well to remember this, too." He stared straight at the Gryffindor table, and for a moment, Draco automatically assumed he was talking to the Weasley twins again before he remembered where he was.
Harry squinted.
She was eyeing James like he might be rabid.
"A couple of Tickling Charms got past you boys, huh?" came Bowie's raspy voice from above them. "Funny, I thought your Shield Charms were better than that. No problem.
Malfoy blinked rapidly, his mouth working but no sound coming out. His pale eyes darted around the hall in incomprehension. "I— I don't— I didn't think— My
"Um, Mr. Mallory?" she said quietly, clearly trying not to draw their attention.
" Malfoy practically shrieked right next to Harry's ear. They were leaning on each other for support. "Se-
And they couldn't know.
That and— and
Harry huffed and sputtered, red-faced. He couldn't articulate all the raging, conflicting thoughts and feelings hurtling through him at the speed of a meteor shower and just as fiery and violent.
He wanted to say he was going to the dorm to take a nap, but he knew sleep would be his enemy now, memories and nightmares waltzing hand-in-hand behind his eyelids.
She was limp against his chest.
Harry could see it the moment Lily understood the sensitive ground she'd stumbled onto. She had opened her mouth, bright and curious, then stopped as it clicked. If Harry didn't live with his parents, there was probably a good reason. And there was a war on— a war where Muggles and Muggle-borns were prime targets, and Harry had just admitted his mother was Muggle-born. Even if his father was pureblood, he had married a Muggle-born, and that made him a blood traitor, just as bad in some people's eyes.
Harry dropped to the ground and grabbed Hermione by the shoulders. He held her against him and felt frantically for a pulse.
If losses were choices, he would far rather have given up his Firebolt than his parents, than Sirius or Remus or even Dumbledore. Moody. Fred. Snape.
"You know," said Sirius thoughtfully, even as he took hold of James's shoulder to brace him, "I bet that's where Harry got that scar."
The Slytherin boys in the '70s were much the same as the ones Draco had left in the '90s.
But it hadn't.
. Why would anyone…?"
. And what are you doing, clinging to my robes like a child? Let go. What is wrong with you?"
Rosier caught Draco staring, that Saturday morning in line to Hogsmeade, and held his gaze. He smiled, a chilly, portentous thing that emphasized the maniac glint in his dark eyes.
"You were fighting for your life," said Remus softly, tentatively, bringing up what they had all found so shocking at breakfast.
"Miss McKinnon," said Dumbledore, addressing his only known student first. He rose from behind his desk with a furrow of concern upon his brow. "What has happened?"

"Nothing," said Lily, smiling. "You know, there's a Quidditch shop in Hogsmeade. Not as big as the one in Diagon Alley, but we might be able to find you a broom if you'd like."
With that, he swanned off.
"That's absurd," said Remus sharply, standing up straighter. "Harry's not that kind of person, Sirius. He would never support Voldemort. His
"Fine, keep your secrets," said Malfoy peevishly. "But just know it's not only you who's stuck here. I want to go home, too, you know."
Sirius's face went utterly blank. Even James's eyes widened in surprise.
I've faced far more powerful wizards than you, and guess what? I'm still standing and
"No," Harry snapped. "Dolohov did."
Draco knew.
"Thanks," repeated Harry, giving Malfoy a discrete shove. "Could you give us a minute? We haven't gotten any practice in yet…."
?" Malfoy sneered in response.
He was starting to wish he had.
"Dueling etiquette, in and of itself, is simple. The opponents bow to one another," he paused, and he and Flitwick bowed to each other, each bending precisely at the waist. He continued, "They assume a stance, typically with the knees bent, ready for moving in either direction, and wand held shoulder-level facing their opponent. And then they are allowed to cast whatever spells they deem prudent to incapacitate their opponent.
Unease curled in James's stomach, even as he kept his voice low and soothing. He hadn't seen Sirius wrecked like this since… well, since that summer after their fifth year, when Sirius had appeared on James's doorstep in the dead of night in the middle of a thunderstorm. Sirius had been ashen, his clothes soaked through, bloody and ripped, and shaking from the aftereffects of the Cruciatus Curse as well as the cold.
"Just once more, from the top."
— gaze snapped onto Draco. And, holy Hungarian Horntail, he had heard people say Potter had his mother's eyes, but it was just
"That was cruel," Harry continued, just as lowly, "and he didn't deserve that. Severus Snape is a good man."
"W-what?"
Remus had learned to listen for the unsteady breathing, to watch for the tapping or grasping fingers that warned of an impending panic attack.
on Slytherin," said Sirius. "And if we just happened to catch a glimpse of you and your best mate Mallory trying to break your necks doing Wronski Feints right after, well, the pitch is a public place."
Harry's mind went blank.
were worried, Harry didn't like where this was heading.
"Then why didn't you ask that instead?" Malfoy snapped back.
Not only that, he had survived a Killing Curse. Which— that was utterly impossible.
The figures were too far away to judge for sure. It was too dark to see anything other than their general builds, which placed them as adult men, by their tall, burly silhouettes.
How the girls could still be so enamored when Sirius was chewing open-mouthed with cheeks like he'd tried to swallow two whole planetary globes, James would never understand.
Bowie bowed off the stage, and Flitwick returned his wand and the bow with a breathless but pleased little titter.
. I haven't seen a Seeker that good since the Puddlemire United team back in '71!"
Sirius nodded, but he looked away and swallowed hard.
"Right," said Draco, hoping his voice didn't sound as brittle as it felt.
"No," said Harry. He didn't offer anything else.
Forget waiting until they got to the dorm. James was going to drown him in a vat of pumpkin juice right here.
Malfoy didn't know Voldemort had succeeded in killing him, even if only briefly, or he wouldn't have said that. Would he?
He sounded so vulnerable, even though he and Sirius were hardly the best of friends.
The second one turned out better than the first, looking exceptionally like Snuffles' ear.
Draco had recognized that look. He had recognized the equal parts fear and anticipation on their faces. He had recognized that tone of voice, furtive, gleeful,
or any other summoning charm that he knew of. He hadn't even thought of—
Sirius glanced at him for a split second, that confused, helpless expression back before he closed himself off again. He stared at the entrance of the tunnel and said, almost dull, "What if that's how he knows my mother? My
names. He's done a lot more good with the name of Black than anyone else in generations."
James winced and said immediately, "Sorry, again, Moony, you know I didn't—"
So he was odd, too, huh?
ridiculous, he supposed.
"Keep your hair on!" James called back at a much more reasonable volume. "Lost track of time. C'mon, you lot! Time to celebrate! That Cup is ours for sure this year!"
Breakfast was hit or miss. They were usually too busy for lunch. They only had dinner when they weren't so exhausted they fell straight asleep after a hard day of work.
And then Harry saw the beginnings of purple fire starting from the tip of Dolohov's wand, and he reacted. His mind went clear and blank and smooth.
Tears sprang to her eyes, and Harry grimaced. He patted her shoulder awkwardly and muttered, "It was nothing. Anyone would have done it."
he couldn't do it himself.
Tears pricked his eyes, and he looked down at his lap. He managed a short, jerking nod of acknowledgement. He wanted to say
That stare, like x-ray vision, pierced even deeper than before. Draco knew Dumbledore wanted to ask what exactly Madam Pomfrey had survived, but he was restraining himself, just as Draco was making an effort to be vague even though he was desperate for Dumbledore's advice.

"I'll leave it up to your discretion," James said seriously. "We've got five applicants for the other Beater position. We need to weed out the unworthy. I want that Cup."
It was their traditional welcoming feast fireworks display. The chatter was dying down across the hall, bellies were uncomfortably full, and students were happily looking forward to returning to their old beds for a blissful night's sleep.
Harry stood, holding his position and panting, until silence and relative darkness permeated the Great Hall.
He whispered a charm to open the door silently, just a crack, and slipped through.
So, James had cast the hissing spell mostly to cover up Sirius's muttered monologue in the silence as he twisted and swirled his wand under the table.
"No one would dare," said Remus dryly.
, but his throat was too tight.
"We're not— wait. What was that?"
Sirius had started getting frustrated, James realized, thinking back on it. He hadn't been able to get through Mallory's defense, and Mallory wasn't giving him a good fight in return. Sirius hadn't even been able to make him move from that position Mallory had claimed at the start of the duel like a man planting a flag in the ground or drawing a line in the sand.
He almost sniggered.
"Yes," said Gertrude. "Gryffindor. My sister and I both. We'll be in seventh year."
They were
He was confused how Severus's bed could have gotten wet, and
He'd been pushed right next to Sirius. If he had given all his focus to the shield instead of maintaining his hair-color charm, Sirius would definitely have seen.
Potter Senior turned a pleasantly surprised look on Black. "No! Did you really—?"
And Draco yearned.
The hour went by in a blur. At some point, the rejects began to join Harry in the stands and watch the rest of the candidates, and then the slapdash practice of the new team playing together for the first time.
"An arrest of this magnitude will require a full team," said Kingsley, sounding far away and tinny. He didn't seem to notice that Harry was quietly hyperventilating across the desk. "You, Weasley, and Granger are impressive, but you will require at least two more experienced Aurors. I'll give you Herrod and Schrodinger."
"It takes a while to get used to," said a female voice directly across from him, and Harry looked up into green eyes as vivid as his own. Lily Evans smiled kindly and—
," said Harry curtly. "I can't take a break. There's too much work to do."

He had come back to end the war, but he was done. He'd finally get to see his family again.
Why would…?
Lily nodded. "Will you be going? They should have sent your parents a permission slip over the summer."
He Apparated to Diagon Alley.
Draco gaped, but he too could smell it. It was the smell of urine, wafting from Severus's wet bed.
Dolohov had gone back on his word, and everything— that screaming, endless hollow in his chest— had exploded.
Potter Senior, Severus, and the few students around them had gone silent, staring in shock at the serious turn of events.
Harry's eyes sprung open.
He pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and stared at it. He trailed his fingers across the familiar, woven-water fabric.
Potter had
"I don't think that's quite it," said Remus, once James had trailed off. He looked thoughtful. "He said he and Mallory weren't friends. I rather got the impression they were like you and Snape, actually." He nodded at James, who scowled in a Pavlovian response at Snape's name.
— being friends, Lily Evans, the
He missed them. The truth hadn't quite sunk in yet— time travel or their deaths.
He turned to leave, Ron and Hermione rushing to the door with him.
"Death Eaters," said Potter, as if he and Dumbledore had only spoken an hour ago instead of a year. "They attacked her at Diagon Alley. She asked for Madam Pomfrey instead of St. Mungo's."
"Why would I be
Severus Snape thought he would have made a good Death Eater.
Harry was dueling Dolohov when Ron got hit with a
His awareness came back slowly, in stages.
When it was through, and Harry was wiping a tear from his eye, Malfoy asked slowly,
Harry shrugged once, still trying to recall. "First year I nearly swallowed the Snitch, but I only ended up in the hospital wing at the end of the year over the philosopher's stone incident. Second year—"
Odd. Last time, in King's Cross, he hadn't
living."
Draco stuttered something, possibly a polite thank you, possibly just a bizarre unintelligible croaking noise, and pulled his hand away. He stuffed it in his pocket.
Either way, he supposed his next step was to figure out how to move on so he could see his friends and family in the afterlife. He had done his job in life. He no longer had obligations tying him to the living, so there was no conflict in his mind about going back.
He had no home. No family or friends. No connections. Salazar, he didn't even have his official N.E.W.T. transcripts to get a decent job. He might as well have been a Muggle-born dropout.
"He was wondering why we weren't
"I see," said Dumbledore. "And what has caused this anomaly, Mr. Malfoy?"
He didn't want to see Sirius fall just as low as Snape to fight him. And Sirius was falling.
the Three Broomsticks, and he hasn't tried to ask me out once."
His mother didn't like to fight. She had even given Draco her wand during that final battle at Hogwarts just to keep him safe.
James and Sirius stood, gaping, as they walked away.
And then he was gone, joining the small crowd gathered around Regulus to hear how tryouts would be held.
Sirius made a grabby motion, and James passed him the paper looking dazed.
"I was w-with my friends," she said tremulously. "We were shopping for our school things for next week. I thought I saw… well, someone I knew. I followed him, but then they… they ambushed me. Dragged me here. They…."
― J.K. Rowling, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows
He crashed through the plates and half-eaten dishes, and his momentum saw him tackling Lily to the ground from behind.
"You had a choice," said the hat. "Mr. Potter, you chose to sacrifice yourself to save everyone you loved. You walked into a forest where you knew you would die. You faced He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and didn't defend yourself. You walked to your death willingly."
…" continued Malfoy quickly, visibly frazzled. "Well— I missed a lot of that season, actually. But I do recall laughing when I heard you'd gotten a cracked skull by your own Keeper who had stolen a Beater's bat in the middle of the game.
without her?
They both knew what it had cost.
"You two do that a lot," Remus observed. "But you seem to be doing well in classes. Is the curriculum really that different than Ilvermorny's?"
you ending up in the hospital wing?"
"Oi," said James, whacking the Prophet onto the table to better give Remus a look of hurt and betrayal. "You're not going to come watch the Gryffindor tryouts?
"I'm Lily Evans, Gryffindor seventh year, Head Girl," said Lily. "That overdramatic baboon there is James Potter, Head Boy. I'm afraid you'll be sharing a dorm with him and the boys." She grinned, sharp and fast, a fierce, witty light like a fire in her eyes. "Welcome to Hogwarts, Harry."
"Right," said Draco, and he stood aside, motioning them into the room. "I found something I thought might interest the Aurors. I didn't expect them to send you three."
"You don't think you'll try out for Gryffindor?" asked Malfoy as they headed down the twisting corridors.
They struggled back to their feet together.
Draco didn't know whether to be triumphant or terrified when his prediction proved correct.
That huge, hollow burning in his chest grew.
Harry struggled to sit up despite his injuries, keeping his lips tightly pressed against more whimpers of pain. That accomplished, he wrapped his arms around himself, uncomfortably vulnerable next to a fully clothed Draco Malfoy. He looked around.
though Harry didn't remember casting it. The clatter echoed in the silence that had dropped over the class.
"Cute, Potter," she said. "It might even be your best fireworks display yet."
as soon as he cast it. I didn't think anyone aside from Dumbledore and a few Aurors could do something like that."
Something fluid, silky, and familiar materialized in his lap, and Harry jolted in surprise.
"I didn't… mean to," said Malfoy eventually.
"Why, you—!" the Lestrange brothers began red with fury, but Dolohov abruptly jerked back to himself and grabbed the backs of their cloaks.
"Ron!" he shouted, unable to see through the flares of light against his shield. He held strong, though each hit started feeling more and more like a punch to the gut instead of a flash off a shield. He squinted hard, knuckles white around his wand. "RON!"
"Still trying to remember if I ended up in the hospital wing in fifth year…. I'm sure I must have, but what
Malfoy looked determined, all tight coils of muscles and laser focused intensity.
All scowling at Remus and Harry, the named duelists filed to the stage and stood behind their respective coach: Harry, Severus, and Malfoy behind Flitwick; Sirius, James, and Remus behind Bowie.
"Severus is hilarious."
Lily crouched down, her brilliant green eyes only inches from Harry's own. "Harry?" she asked. "Is it a Tickling Charm? Those can get pretty ugly. Here.
Marlene had scarcely gone to untie it before James was throwing himself full-body onto the table.
There had been a look in his startling green eyes when he'd approached them like he didn't know whether to break into laughter or tears. The look had been so intense, James's heart had skipped a beat when those haunted eyes looked directly into his.
Draco Malfoy stood blinking at them.
Harry took another deep breath and let it out.
He clenched his fists. Short nails dug viciously into his palms.
"A place called Everest Wands," said Hermione. "I haven't heard of—"
Lily got a wistful little smile about her face, while Remus looked skeptical.
, but he was

"It doesn't say," said James, continuing to scan through the article. Harry caught a glimpse of a photo over his shoulder, presumably of Henry and Midge Jarlsberger. They were an older couple, probably well into their seventies or eighties, and were holding a trophy of some sort, laughing and bright-eyed. "There were no signs of a struggle. Their wards didn't register anyone outside of the family…."
His death.
"The latest from Avery's interrogation suggests the remaining Death Eaters have banded around Dolohov instead of Yaxley, as we originally thought," Kingsley continued, beginning the slow, ponderous pacing around the desk anew. "He may bring protection. Bodyguards. He may not even go himself. He could delegate."
Sirius was proving less than ideal as his second pair of eyes, though, still pacing and demanding answers about Harry Parker's very odd character. Well, pacing as much as the confines of the Cloak would allow, anyway. He kept bumping into James, interrupting his concentration.
other houses in such a manner!"
"You think he got that scar from…?"
Remus gave him a bracing smile and nodded, while Lily did the same.
"Hell-fucking-no, I don't!
Sirius looked down at the spot where his plate had been and went slack with shock. "MY BAGEL!
"Bloody Gryffindors," he muttered. "Fine. I'll come with you, make sure you don't attack any passing first years on the way. Unstable sodding skiver…."
It was easy to forget he was nothing but a coward when push came to shove. It was easy to forget he was useless, nothing more than a scared little kid in the face of the real world and its problems.
"Right," said Sirius, nodding once. His shoulder was relaxing under James's hand.
"I'll come with," said Harry's mouth, before his brain caught up. He didn't know what look he had on his face— hopefully it wasn't as embarrassing as he suspected— but Malfoy stared at him, giving a single blink of surprise. Then he looked Harry up and down calculatingly.
Draco Malfoy had approached from the side and was kneeling down, a sneer on his face even though his gray eyes sparked with something like worry.
Harry said to Draco, "I'm gonna… I'm gonna go. We'll… talk later."
was a Muggle-born, and he loves Lily and the girls."
"I've already told you," said Harry, just as quietly. He strained his eyes to keep sight on the faint shadows within Everest Wands. "I can't go back. Kingsley already said we're guaranteed a position in Magical Law Enforcement, and… and Hogwarts just won't be the same. You know? Not after… not after this. I
"You're our friend, Harry," said Marlene boldly. "Don't forget it. We won't."
"Here in this club, we will use the sporting rules, though note that some private duels may be different. For wizards, you may duel until one surrenders or one is no longer able to wield his wand. For witches, you may duel until one surrenders or first blood is drawn. Because, as we all know, witches will more readily duel to the death, unlike wizards, who will beat each other up and then go out for a drink afterwards.
"Look," he said bracingly, flailing his hands for effect. "It's just been one day. Let's not judge our new roomie just yet, alright? We'll keep an eye on him, make sure he's well. We'll go light on the pranks, focus on our N.E.W.T.s, and see if he comes around. And in the meantime, we have a map to finish. Yeah?"
Draco shivered. He glanced out his window at the clear summer night and drew his robes tighter around himself. He didn't know why he suddenly felt cold all over if it wasn't the weather.
James turned to Lily, feeling that dopey smile return as he looked at her in the starlight.
Something was very wrong.
Draco glared up at the staff table, where Dumbledore was in conversation with McGonagall. Why wasn't he giving the welcoming speech yet?
"He's still just a kid," said Harry quietly, bracingly. "He hasn't… he hasn't gone through what we have. Not yet. Maybe the Blacks teach their kids some fancy wandwork, but he doesn't
"Oh, I'm sure it can't be that bad," said Lily. "It's a lovely day, and Hogsmeade is really just this cutest little village…."
Anyone who grew up training to duel with Bellatrix Lestrange, in the ancient Black household, could not possibly be an easy foe.
in those fancy sitting rooms and dining halls.
James wasn't a Legilimens, but he got the impression he and Sirius were on the same page.
Then another Death Eater was on him, and he couldn't duel and rummage in his robes at the same time.
"Tonight is going to be a special treat," continued Bowie, who lit his cigarette with his wand tip, "because we have
"Why would you?" Sirius scoffed, still not meeting his gaze. "What
Narcissa had taught Draco how to win.
Harry caught Malfoy's raised eyebrow and unimpressed look, glancing over to see if Harry found it as amusing.
He was Undesirable Number One.
Fucking hell.
"Oh, come off it," scoffed James. "Mallory, I could see, but Harry?"
Remus found Harry in the library after lunch. He was sitting at a table by himself with a large, dense-looking old book on… the lettering was too small for Remus to see from a distance, even with his slightly enhanced werewolf vision.
Third, if that was a bust, it might give them some good blackmail material in case they really didn't get along and ended up needing it later.
Peter broke into a face-splitting grin and only tried to take it back a notch when Remus muttered something else in his ear, wearing a look of mild chastisement.
Draco considered casting an invisibility spell on Potter Senior's and Black's robes as they passed so they'd find themselves in their undergarments in the middle of the great hall at the height of breakfast hour, but even Draco knew how that would go: Potter Senior would no doubt be surprised at first, but then he would grin that idiotic grin so unlike Harry's, strike a shameless pose like a witch in a nudie magazine, and ask Evans (
. Just a bit difficult when 'Black' is also my roommate."
"Don't be daft, Po— Parker!" said Malfoy, getting to his feet first, an angry red stain on his pale cheeks. "Madam Pomfrey said no practical magic for at least a week! I'll do it."
James had released the Snitch, probably the moment he dove onto the table after Marlene and Gertrude's owl.
Black had stopped laughing. He looked at the wizard's hat in astonishment. Then, when he looked back at Draco, there was a calculating gleam in his eye.
"Professor Bowie would like me to announce the revival of our school's dueling club, with mandatory attendance at least once a week for fifth years and higher."
Lily sighed and rolled her eyes. She looked at Harry and said, "First Hogsmeade weekend next week. Have you heard of it?"
"What happened?" asked Remus, setting down his toast.
, "I expected better…. You're seventeen, not a kid anymore…."
Harry glanced at Black again, and Draco didn't imagine the look of disappointment and hurt in his face.
Parker? Someone was calling the name Parker, and everyone was looking at him. Why were these people calling him Parker?
Harry reeled back. That would make her Ginny's classmate, but he would
Sirius threw his free hand in the air, a dismissive twitch. "He hides it with his fringe for the most part, but I've seen it a few times. Shaped like a… zigzag. Kind of a sideways 'M.' It's a scar from a Dark curse. I'd recognize it anywhere."
"Er," said James, looking down at his fish-tail hands and then at his wand on the desktop. "How do you reckon I hold my wand to reverse this?"
Harry had gotten a good whiff from it just a few hours ago and could confirm it was whiskey, not Polyjuice Potion. His eyes had watered from the strength of the alcohol, which bordered on moonshine.
"I was there, sir," said Harry stiffly. "I remember what we fought for."
Mr. Bowie cast his illusion, and all the warmth vanished from the classroom.
Padfoot, gerroff! I've gotta kill—"
"Why not both?" suggested Wormtail.
"Must've been some joke," said Lily with raised eyebrows. "Care to share?"
By the time Harry could breathe and open his eyes without the world going dark around the edges, the flyers were in the air.
Harry was leaning hard against the desk beside him, trying to stay on his feet, trying to breathe. Why… why couldn't he get Dolohov's twisted face out of his head? Why were his ears still ringing with the Death Eaters' laughter?
Because Harry and Draco might leave, return to their time, before Malfoy even got to play his first match as a Keeper. And then James would be dead again. Just like all the others.
"I already told you I don't want to play!"
The wind whipped his hair and face, made his robes stream as if in a tornado around him. The air grew colder, fresher, and rushed in his ears like a living thing all around him.
"Prongs, I'm sure they're going just as friends," Remus attempted, holding his wand uncertainly. "She probably just wants to show him around for his first visit—"
Harry spun and found himself face-to-face with Sirius in Slytherin robes. Then he blinked, and it wasn't Sirius. His eyes were too pale, though they had that same sharp, intense look Sirius often got, and his face was a little rounder, softer and younger. He might have been about an inch or two shorter, too, but the Quidditch boots made it hard to judge.
Kingsley gave him a look with those penetrating, sad eyes.
Streams of brown, gray, and green sparks shot up, covering the table in a snapping, popping image of grassy, deep dirt.
"Well?" he asked, breathless from exertion but still grinning. "Am I as good a Keeper as Seeker, do you think?"
He was very good at Expelliarmus.
"What do you mean?" asked Potter. His voice was weak and hoarse, as it had been since they had woken up in the past. It sounded, Draco thought with a churning stomach, as if he had recently screamed his throat bloody.
have found a way…. If you ever—"
He looked less like Harry than Harry remembered, the longer he looked, but the similarities were still enough to be distracting.
James's housemates eyed it warily. They had seen what had happened to all the other houses.
"Wait! Here, at least put this on." Draco pulled his cloak off without as much flourish as he once would have and held it out to Harry, looking determinedly in the opposite direction. His hands shook.
As Lily slapped the shit out of him for the thirty-first time ever, and the first time in seventh year, Sirius barked with laughter until he started choking, hacking up more pumpkin juice from his lungs.
Harry shrugged, secretly just as concerned.
a gentlemanly escort," said Marlene sweetly, leaning forward to leer at Sirius even as she wrapped her own arm around Harry. "Harry's already saved my sister's life once. We'll take
amount of recklessness?"
By the end, they were sitting, their legs having given out from under them. They stared at each other in silence, too stunned to react. And then, almost as one, they looked out over the pitch to see where Harry Parker was flying as wild and free as a bird.
Surely.
It looked like he would have to wait until after the welcoming speech, unfortunately.
He had killed Molly's brothers, Gideon and Fabian Prewett, in the first war.
Already, his thought processes from his panic were fading from memory like a bad dream.
" Lily repeated, and Malfoy drew a deep, gasping breath next to him.
"Ah, no, sir," said James, edging up to Sirius. "I think I should get him to the hospital wing. He's, ah… bleeding. A lot."
He hadn't liked Dumbledore while he had been a student. He had grown up with his parents complaining of the man far too often to hold anything but disdain for him. But, looking back, Draco regretted.
, Harry thought, taking a step away from Regulus and pressing his hands experimentally against his ears to see if he could still hear over the ringing. His heart was hammering at the sudden adrenaline rush.
"We were vicious little things, weren't we?"
"Mr. Potter's words before the Killing Curse," said Dumbledore. "'You will never kill
He had missed the question.
It was dark, and they didn't dare light their wands for fear of giving away their surveillance.
"Are you having another fit?" came Snape's voice. It wasn't as deep as it would get in later years, but it had that same surprisingly soft, silky quality Harry would always associate with dimly lit potions classes in the dungeons.
After a few minutes, when his breath evened out and he could see through the blinding headache, Malfoy said, "I know what will make you feel more like yourself. Let's practice Wronski Feints. Whoever gets closest to the ground—
Her face was turning pale. Her lips were a bloodless blue.
Malfoy kept his feet planted. His wand movements were fast, precise, controlled. His expression was one of concentration, but Harry recognized that steely glint in his eyes as something he saw often in the mirror: Malfoy knew he might get hurt, but he was determined to see it through anyway.
. His throat
kind of wet dream, but I s'pose you're not there yet."
"Yeah, you already know the whole conversation as well as we do at this point," Sirius added, sprawled out on his back on the dirt floor of the tunnel.
"Alright," he said heavily. "I get it. Just… just don't do it again, alright? I haven't gone around attacking Snape. I'd appreciate the same courtesy, if you don't mind. Even though they're
"Sorry, fine, alright," muttered Harry, running a hand through his hair. The steam had condensed into droplets of water on him, and he was now soggy and cold. He took off his glasses and did his best to mop off the water with his damp robes.
Kingsley and Harry paced around the single desk like it was a dance, moving in one direction together before one of them changed directions and got close, only for the other to change direction, too, and keep the endless circle going the opposite way.
"Shit-fuck," said Malfoy, practically spitting. He scowled at Harry, disgusted.
Of James and Lily and Sirius and Remus as ghosts.
He'd just have to keep an eye on them. He was sure a group of sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds couldn't get into too much trouble in Hogsmeade, even if they were Death Eater initiates. He replayed that sentence in his mind, remembered his own sixth year at Hogwarts, and then winced. Well…
It could be a strong team, James concluded, rubbing his chin as the impromptu practice came to a close. With over half the team being new, it would come down to how well they worked together. Separately, they each had considerable talent, but James wouldn't worry a bit if it turned out they meshed like a sack full of feral cats.
"No," said Harry and Remus.
Harry's chest ached.
Upon seeing Harry, the Lestranges' faces twisted into taunting sneers, but Dolohov's went slack and pale.
"What are you doing?" asked Snape, giving him an incredulous look.
Again, James moved his eyes without turning his head. He studied Harry.
Sirius grew it slowly as it slithered to the edge of Hufflepuff table and slid down… and down, and down, until its tail hit the flagstone floor twenty feet behind its sleek head, its body as wide around as a grown man's torso.
Marlene nodded in acceptance, her bottom lip trembling, but she took a breath and regained control of herself. She said more crisply, "I saw you didn't like the boys' welcoming feast prank earlier. Don't worry about them, okay? Once they see you're friends with me and Lily, they won't dare bother you."
"There you go!" said James, sitting up with delight. "Well done! Try the other one."
“Well… this is somewhat related to that, actually.”
Harry had visited this café before. It was conveniently nearby and rarely crowded, with small round corner tables that would work perfectly well for a short meeting.
“Has there ever been anyone else?”
Hermione, true to form, sent him a parchment scroll of information nearly six feet long, with a letter warning him again to be careful.
“Well, which is it then?”
Draco emerged from his lab then with a swanky purple bottle. Harry had never seen him wear the top of his pyjamas before, a perfect match to the silky grey of the bottoms, and he looked oddly younger with it on. However, even with Draco’s shirt on it was becoming increasingly difficult for him not to jump to conclusions.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Obviously, things would never be the same for George after losing Fred, but in the time since Harry had seen the joke shop, and Ron, pull him from a very real darkness.
With a choked, high-pitched sort of noise, Draco was spilling over Harry’s fingers in seconds, his own clawing for purchase on the wooden edge of Harry’s kitchen counter as he arched against it—
“Actually—wait.”
But Malfoy was already heading for the great black door.
Harry was a bit anxious to move on as well, not to mention he was ready for lunch, but he also hadn’t wanted to be rude.
“No, but the peacocks need feeding, and they get a bit lonely if no one’s around to talk to them.”
Harry made every attempt to keep his knees and elbows to himself as he squished into the phonebox with Savage. It was a bit awkward as the lift made its slow progress toward ground-level, but this particular exit always was.
Fumbling open Draco’s trousers, Harry pulled his cock out to pump him forcefully, whispering Parseltongue secrets beneath his ear all the while.
,” was all he could think to say.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Ginny frowned at him. “Harry you’ve been gone for hours.”
” he expelled. Draco was intoxicating, and Harry was coming before he’d got more than half of himself where it was meant to be.
Spinning around, Harry caught him by the cheek to kiss him hard, and Draco moaned very frustratedly into it.
“It’s classified as a jinx. I wouldn’t consider it naturally Dark. Perhaps a bit… grey.”
Ginny wasn’t actually there that evening, and would be on the road with the Harpies for the majority of October, which only gave Harry more room to thrash—until whatever nightmare he was having about the War gave way to something new.
Harry and Draco spend a rainy afternoon in Muggle London looking at empty lots, then Harry takes him home for tea, among other things.
Hermione squinted at him, seeming to detect the unspoken ‘and’ that Harry was absolutely
Tucking their wands away, they retraced their steps back to the off-street where Harry had first spotted the Dementors congregating. He supposed what he expected to find down that tiny road was some sort of den of iniquity, the worst of the worst sort of people.
“Potter, are you getting emotional over a tent?”
you’d spouted off that we’ve been fucking in front of Blaise, called me a whore, and presumed to tell me who I’m allowed to fuck when you’ve got no room to talk, and no fucking right.”
Only later that afternoon did it dawn on him there wasn’t really anything in Malfoy’s letter he would’ve needed to hide from her in the first place. Yet the instinct to do so had been overwhelming, and Harry couldn’t find it in himself to bring any of it up in conversation later either. For now, he felt far more comfortable keeping the whole thing to himself.
Harry leant forward and kissed it, slowly, with a bit of tongue. And when Draco moaned his surprise and didn’t stop him, he nudged into the tight ring of Draco’s arse.
He was pretty sure they were responsible for his nightmares being so frequent lately as well—the Dementors were very good at stirring up all his worst memories, and Harry was far from the only one suffering because of them.
If Aberforth found it at all strange Harry was sitting down to have a drink with a Malfoy, he didn’t let on.
“That’s quite the assumption,” Draco drawled, but he was watching Harry from the corner of his eye, and Harry absolutely caught that hitch in his breathing.
“You’re so naughty,” he whispered, feeling Draco smirk against his lips.
“Oh, I nearly forgot,” he drawled, digging in his pocket a moment while Harry watched curiously before he produced a small blue velvet drawstring bag, and laid it on the table between them.
Draco was smirking at him. “I’ll make it up to you after.”
Harry was thinking, with some difficulty, as Draco went on with his insistent rocking. He tried to pretend it wasn’t driving him mad with want, and took a short steadying sip of warming amber.
He moved around behind Harry’s chair for the space to Disapparate, but just before he did, Draco brushed his fingers softly at the nape of Harry’s neck, sending chills trailing down his spine, and leaving him quietly gasping, alone in his kitchen.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“That’s putting it charitably.”
Harry only laughed. “It’s—work, mostly.”
Harry laughed. “I don’t know, perhaps I thought he could stand to do some community service.”
Beyond the familiar sneer there was a disconcerting glint of excitement in the silver of Draco’s eyes, and Harry was momentarily distracted by them.
Spiralling his way lazily down toward the ground, he tried not to think too intently about the exact details of why he was so sore, for his own sanity’s sake.
“Because you’re you. Now, trousers off. Get on the fucking bed.”
He watched Malfoy’s eyes fall closed, and the clear focus it took for him to continue taking him in smoothly. Almost too smoothly. Experimentally, he tugged firmly at his hair, and the resulting glare was worth throwing him off enough to feel an edge of teeth against over-sensitised skin, and now Harry was proper moaning too.
“No fights. Mostly. He seemed quite down, actually.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
When he cast his first attempt, the bag apparently did not stand a chance. Rather than do what it was meant to, the charm he cast burst it open, and tiny bits of brown paper rained down on them like drab confetti.
Malfoy unquestioningly swallowed all of him, with a low hum that had him twitching on his tongue as he spent himself fully. His knees had gone full wobbly now, and Malfoy's mouth pulled off his cock almost reluctantly.
Apparently he wasn’t done.
He felt suddenly even more flushed.
“I did. And I put in some honey.”
“Your father nearly killed me in the Hall of Prophecy—and destroyed a lot of the ‘prophecy’ bit in the process.”
“Fine, alright. Fucking first, then we’ll have a light breakfast and get on with casting for a few hours. Fair?”
“It will be. But if you’ve been practising properly, we should be capable of pulling it off.”
“We’ll probably need to tell her what we’re really up to eventually as well,” Harry reasoned. “I can’t be on top of what’s happening in London all the time and you certainly aren’t going to be volunteering for that.”
Draco huffed his annoyance. “Well, that was pointless. The last one will have to do then.”
Draco was lithe and firm, and his hips rocked with tantalising smoothness as he fucked himself back on Harry’s cock. The table creaked under Harry with every hard impact of their hips, but he was much more focused on the sounds Draco was making, the feel of him—and not bursting under the intensely wicked hold all around his cock.
“Potter?” Draco panted to the steamy glass.
“I’ll Floo this weekend, after everyone’s had a chance to recover from today,” Hermione decided.
“You’re such a prat.”
“Fuck, I’m so hard,” he exhaled, a compulsion to breathe finally overruling his need to feel Draco’s tongue all over his.
Harry made a bit of a face. “You don’t mean to go right back into casting now, do you?”
“No, tonight—if I can help it.”
With soapy fingers, Harry stroked over the abused skin of Draco’s arsecheeks with aroused fascination and Draco sucked in a pained breath.
Unhesitantly Harry shoved in the rest of the way, even as his overstimulated cock shot sticky heat into the man writhing under him, and he could feel Draco go taut with ecstasy, inside and out.
“Oh,” Draco drawled in distracted annoyance, crossing the other half of the bridge to hand off the curvy bottle.
“Can he be trusted?” he said in more hushed tones.
Some nights, it took all of his energy even to drag himself from his comfortable chair by the fire and up the stairs to bed. Sitting there on those colder nights, his mind would overflow with thoughts, anxieties, and concerns that only grew harder to calm.
The innocent request brought to the forefront of Harry’s mind the first time they'd visited, when he’d been fully prepared for Draco to make a terrible fuss over the indignity of the whole affair. But in reality he hadn’t expressed the slightest hint of discomfort. Harry thought it was possible the discomfort might be in there somewhere, but Draco was too good at hiding things when he wanted.
Unthinkingly, Harry bit down on his lower lip—and apparently Draco had caught him staring.
Harry exhaled heavily, attempting to get control of himself—an entirely pointless endeavour, as Malfoy only moaned in response with a reflexive sort of rock up against Harry, hips first. Now they both moaned.
“We can’t all have your impeccable luck, Potter.”
Harry!” Ginny replied in hushed amusement. “That would be Renna’s parents.”
“They’re what’s drawing the Dementors?” Harry queried.
Harry huffed. “I don’t know, Malfoy. It looks alright to me. It’s big enough. What do
Harry tried to reign in his control, panting softly. “I can try.”
“You don’t catch on very quickly, do you? That is the point of the whole endeavour here.”
“That was…a lot.”
“Yes, yes, I know. Touching strange prophecies is a direct ticket to certain madness. Honestly though… are we not already mad?”
,” Harry stuttered. He moaned tightly when all Draco did was chuckle at him and bite his ear. “
He found the right spot, and did not let up, rocking down harder, then abruptly pumped his hips in quick short slams until Draco’s cock shot between them in pulsing spurts.
As his thoughts drifted it crossed his mind to wonder at how they had ended up here, and where they stood—but he was too tired to examine anything now. Draco’s firm weight and the steady warmth of his breathing lulled Harry inevitably toward the pull of a true dreamless sleep.
Harry felt something twist uncomfortably in his stomach at the thought of returning to the rest of the world, and Ginny, after everything that he’d just—
The ‘how’ of the spellwork still escaped him, but it was quite cool, and he would’ve readily complimented Draco’s work, only—
“That is not making me feel any better.”
As her footsteps retreated down the hall, Harry fought not to combust with anxiety.
Ultimately Draco had been trying to protect his family, right up to that moment. The only other time he’d taken a risk like that had been to save all their lives.
Draco moaned darkly encouraging around him and Harry thrust reactively in a throb of heat. Then he did it again, and again, through each erratic bolt of pleasure.
“Scared, Potter?”
“Harry—
“Blaise prefers to be fucked.”
“Chapter twenty-seven of the book on spell modifications is what you should familiarise yourself with. You haven’t got to build the spell, I’m responsible for that part, but you’ll need to know what you’re doing when you cast them. You’ll need to understand the theory behind the added layers.”
“We’ll be looking for a lot of some sort—one centrally located between here and the settlement you mentioned near the riverbank. You know the area far better than either of us, we had hoped you might have some suggestions.”
“Her notes say it’s owned by the borough, but there’s no record of them ever wanting to do anything with it. It’s not for sale—but it’s not used for anything important either. It’s just…an empty lot.”
As out of place as he felt standing there amidst the opulent splendour of the dining room, conversely Draco seemed completely at ease and entirely in his element, even despite its being a Muggle establishment. He got them a small table by one of the big windows, where Harry could look out on the cars, umbrellas, people and pavement all growing steadily saturated, while the rain splattered the window’s glass panes with a multitude of droplets, each refracting the traffic lights from the street.
“You realise I’m the one trying to make your absurd plan to
“Fucking hell,” he muttered. “I might come if you keep up like that.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Yes, ‘about that’.” Ron was apparently not in the mood for hedging. “Why in Merlin’s great bloody balls would you be working with that arsehole?”
“Exception?” Draco repeated blankly.
Harry failed to stop his breath hitching under a sudden flutter of nerves, a tingle of heat.
. They certainly shouldn’t’ve been forced to stay here under some awful ancient magical contract they had no say in creating.”
“As will you be.”
Harry pulled out and tried to stand, clearly a mistake, as his head spun.
Draco’s answer was low and desperately lustful. “You’d like that wouldn’t you? Lying here night after night, remembering how many times you’ve made me come.”
Malfoy snickered at him, and Harry ignored the curious twinge of something it stirred in him, forcing it down to focus on the warnings his better judgement was screaming at him to make. He might’ve been a git but Harry didn’t want to see him get hurt.
“Calm down. I won’t touch your arsehole, unless you ask me for it.”
Staring blearily unfocused, it took Harry a moment to absorb that many words into any sort of meaning.
Harry stared at him somewhat uncomprehending as a twist of desire on a level he had never experienced before washed over him, amazing—and also terrifying. It was taking Harry a ridiculous amount of effort not to act on it—not to back Malfoy right up against that tree and—
When he waved to her, she waved warmly back.
At precisely twelve, Draco Malfoy appeared beside him in a
But he didn’t have to wonder long, and hadn’t even got his question out before Malfoy was shifting to his knees, there in the cool blue light of the prophecies. One wrong move might send them both spiralling into madness, and the only thing Harry could focus on was the anticipation of having his cock sucked by Draco Malfoy.
Only in a magic Manor would anyone risk a fireplace so close to so many ancient, likely irreplaceable books, but Draco didn’t seem to find the crackle of the flames concerning in the least.
“Malfoy—”
“Perhaps a bit.” Green eyes danced with quiet amusement behind his glasses.
For several beats, the only noise in the tiny office was the sound of Harry’s pen moving on the notepad he’d bought for the occasion. He nodded for Cassie to go on.
“Attic—go.” Harry was already pushing him up the stairs.
When they weren’t fucking or talking they were sleeping, and it felt so devilishly good to sleep without worry, not to mention how badly he needed it, that Harry cherished every moment.
” Harry never could hear the difference very well, but—
“Merciful fuck that is hot—what did you say?”
“You as well. Thanks, Cassie.”
He was assuming Draco hadn’t meant his aunt Bellatrix, she didn’t strike him as the sort to’ve gone out for brunch, especially not muggle brunch. He’d also spent enough time studying the tapestry at Grimmauld to know Draco’s mum didn’t have any other siblings.
"You should know better than anyone some rules are meant to be broken."
Harry snorted distractedly, now more focused on the menu—or rather, the fact he couldn’t read a word of it. “Do you actually understand what you’re looking at here?”
Forcing a smile that he hoped looked genuine, he scrambled to remember the man’s first name before the silence between them grew too uneasy. He shook the former Slytherin’s offered hand in the meantime.
…not scared at all, are you? More excited, it feels like.”
It was far too easy for Harry to get completely wrapped up in him, forgetting all of the many reasons why he shouldn’t be doing this, surrounded as he was by all of the many reasons why he should—
“Sorry, did I—?”
The duck came out quite good. Harry helped himself to more than he probably should’ve, and ate for several minutes before he bothered to stop long enough to say anything about it.
“Draco—”
“Except that you did.”
“Well, nevermind that idea then. We’ll have to explore elsewhere.”
“I’ve got more of the wards to sort out. It might take another week—two at most, but I’m hoping not.”
As he swallowed down the syrupy potion, he heard Malfoy scoff quietly—as if he hadn’t really believed Harry would try it. But now Harry could only await the effects of whatever it was he’d just agreed to take.
When they were finished with ward practice, they paused to have a quick late dinner at quarter-past eight. It was only leftover duck, but Draco made them each a strong cup of coffee as well, something to help them through the work they had left to do.
A massive stone hearth was inset into the wall at one end and when Draco flicked his wand, it flared to life. There were a few old-ish looking chairs around several long wooden prep tables and Harry sat down in one, but Draco decided to sit on the table instead.
“I think—I suppose he’s a bit different now,” Harry mused. “Since the War.”
Harry watched his every movement, listening to every word. Not for the reasons he might normally, but knowing he would need to replicate them as closely as possible when he tried the spell for himself.
“You really wouldn’t have to—"
Harry rolled up Draco’s note, and cleared his throat. “I’m here.”
He cancelled Draco’s vibration spell, his wand stilled in his hand, and Harry didn’t think much about wiping it clean on the nearest pile of trousers.
“I’m not sorry,” he admitted. “For any of it.”
Exhaling hard, he thrust his shaft stickily over Harry’s lips, and Harry licked all over it, an overload of sugar contrasting the salty drops from his tip.
Harry shrugged. “Must be my wrackspurts have got out of hand again.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry immediately cast several locking charms and one rather strong silencing charm on the door.
“Right.”
“Hm…I snogged a lot of people that year.”
An hour later it was only seven thirty and the wait felt endless.
“Except the salad,” Harry muttered, finally going in for a taste. “S’pose the soup’s alright.”
it would be to—but Draco was at his lips again. Their noses bumped, and Harry’s glasses jostled when he closed the distance to kiss Draco even harder.
In the residual heat, Harry noticed Draco trembling slightly and realised he was trying to keep them falling forward and unbalancing the chair.
“Come along. We’ll blame it all on the Dementors,” Draco reasoned, vexingly smug.
“We’ve got all night,” he drawled in that voice that went straight to Harry’s cock. “Use it.”
“It is quite a loud shop,” Harry agreed with a grin, that both Ron and George returned.
“You’ll need to move off first,” Harry pointed out, pinching at the smooth stretch of Draco’s side, where his hand just happened to be resting.
“Felt like you came pretty hard, you’re really going to complain?”
“Only the one?” Draco drawled low, taking the tumbler from him to drain its last swallow.
“Just rest for now. Your limbs won’t work for a bit. Don’t panic.”
“D’you think we’re ready for the next step then?” Harry asked as he charmed his tea to stir itself.
“Shut up.” Draco was just sulking now.
And it had all blurred by so quickly—his episodes of intimacy with Draco had happened so fast and frequently for the last several weeks that Harry hadn’t had time to consider what would happen when it stopped. He’d been running all on impulse, if only to avoid thinking about absolutely any of the potential consequences.
“Don’t flatter me.”
” Draco broke to a low moan, arching back, their rhythm growing more erratic as he was caught between Harry’s hand and his cock.
. It was muscle memory.”
“Alright,” Harry agreed, and Draco summoned some from the kitchen.
It was reminiscent of the statues in the Chamber of Secrets and Harry eyed it a bit warily—but the overall ambiance of the place was rather impressive, he had to admit.
As they made their way back out into the atrium, Harry nodded to the door across the iron walkway curiously.
“I can let them out, or hem them, as the case may be. I’m fully capable of an adequate tailoring spell.”
“Not at all. I’m perpetually pleasant and kind, and never cruel.”
“Maybe two weeks? Or three… I can’t remember. We were only meant to be questioning someone, but he took one look at me and—”
Harry snorted. “Really? I haven’t heard you complaining. …You moan an awful lot though.”
Harry stifled a smile. “Here.”
and you’re stood here in my office and—”
With his glasses on, Harry could see most of the light in the room was coming from the wall facing the atrium, which was not solid as the others were, but inset with varying-sized circles of opaque glass—red, blue and green. It cast an unusual plethora of colours over the bed and the walls and the floors, it was quite beautiful, and only drove home the fact he hadn’t ever been in there in the proper light of day before.
“Thanks, Harry.”
Harry had also bought him a firewhisky at the Leaky Cauldron later that day, and the two of them had talked over serious things and old memories. Neville was apparently seeing Hannah fairly often now—and he came across quite besotted when he talked of her, which made Harry smile for him.
Harry shivered through a hot chill, and felt a twinge of interest in his trousers, shutting his eyes against the feeling with a deep steadying breath.

“Not if I make one.”
“Possibly, probably, and if I’m recalling the modifications I’m thinking of correctly, then I could potentially work a few additional stabilising charms into the curtains.”
Draco wasn’t being outright rude, not any more than normal, but there was an obvious wall of cool detachment when he spoke that had not been there before.
Harry shut the window against the frosty January chill invading the house and grabbed himself a jumper from the hall cupboard. With some effort, he managed to regain his calm as he took the short roll of parchment with him to the kitchen. He would need tea for this.
“I’m dreadfully bored, my friends are all too busy partying away their fortunes to bother writing.” Draco’s arms crossed his chest. “Indulge me.”
“Shower?” he murmured.
If Harry started thinking about the potion now, he would lose the thread completely—so he refocused. Draco was talking, and that helped, so long as Harry didn’t look at him for very long.
Harry would’ve taken that as an affirmative if he weren’t so busy shuddering under the assault to his senses.
“I’m not sure we’ll need to; with a bit of Transfiguration and a few minor adjustments it should be easy enough to convert without rebuilding the internal structure. We ought to choose one with an extra room, then we’ll have somewhere for storage as well, which we’ll clearly need.”
“Draco…”
Malfoy gestured to the empty end of the chaise he lounged upon, pulling his legs up just enough to clear a small space, though even through the dim light Harry could see him scowling.
Harry snorted a sort of agreement, fussing idly with the twigs of his broomtail.
“If you tell absolutely anyone about the cuddling there will be very severe consequences,” Draco murmured without bothering to open his eyes.
“Don’t sulk. It’s not attractive.”
Harry shut that thought down immediately. He needed to keep his cool here.
Harry smiled soft uncertainty, not just at the prospect of having to dress up either. There were many reasons ‘why not’. The Muggle world was one of the only places they could safely be out together in public, but even then, it would be chancy. Even Cassie was somewhat of a risk, especially considering her sister. They would need to be extra careful around her, careful in particular of how familiar they were with each other.
“The one we were in last night had an extra room.”
“If you’re not going to piss off back to your day of mourning, you might as well join me.”
“Maybe not,” Harry acknowledged with a small smirk. They were sharing the umbrella, so they were rather close, and he blamed that too for his distraction.
When the forest had nothing interesting to say in return, Harry carefully slipped on his glasses and went to collect his robes.
They fell into a relatively comfortable silence, only broken when Harry fidgeted unnecessarily and Draco told him to stop, or murmured a quiet spell to widen a pantleg or shorten a sleeve. When he had made all the necessary adjustments, and seemed mostly satisfied with the fit, he turned Harry about in front of the mirrors to get a better look.
Time slowed salaciously to a stop as he drew in a tight breath, and Draco answered in a compliant moan, the flats of his palms pressing hot to Harry’s chest, balanced to take in the swelling throb of him.
Harry chewed his lip uncertainly. “I think...maybe he’s just bored? He said he was, er— ‘intellectually invested’ or something.”
“Do you even know what you’re looking for down here? Half these rooms are deadly and the others are just severely dangerous.”
“They’re a bit rounder about the middle, but they didn’t explode or anything.”
He supposed he might’ve been angrier at Malfoy’s disrespect to the dead, to the War, and to everyone’s grief but—as Harry’s eyes dilated faintly—he didn’t entirely disagree. He’d never really wanted to be there in the first place.
He was grateful that Draco didn’t press in with his tongue the way Harry always did, but when he kissed again, with the lightest brush of a hot wet tongue, it felt so viciously brilliant that Harry nearly asked him to keep going—but then Draco was standing upright to flick the firm slick tip of his cock between Harry’s cheeks, his moans ever more resonant in the reflective room.
…at the Solstice will come a new…
“What do
“Hngh?”
“Eventually. I’m comfortable.”
Having left his other bag in the library, the one with all his clothes in, Harry summoned it, and Draco summoned his own toothbrush and pyjamas to the ballroom as well.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Might as well,” Harry answered before he had finished, peering over Draco’s shoulder to examine the next location. His chest pressed to Draco’s shoulder—and Harry did his best to ignore the warmth of it. “Walking shouldn’t take more than ten minutes maybe, you want to?”
“We should go, before someone notes your… extended absence. I’d hate to be accused of kidnapping an Auror.”
right there—Harry—
of Astronomy class? How did you even manage to graduate?”
Perching on the very edge of a low table at the room’s centre, there was no hesitation in the way Harry pulled him back against his chest.
Harry got his answer in several deliberate bites into the flushing skin down his throat. Draco’s mouth was hot on his skin, and his teeth sent shots of pleasure straight to Harry’s cock.
“It’s got to be open, Malfoy. Access was a big part of what Cassie said was the problem in the first place.”
He would then inevitably feel guilty for not feeling as guilty as he should, all of which then led to a lot of frustration, and a headache.
Harry had also done some of his own research on what Draco had outlined in his notes, so that he might have a slightly better idea of the work involved in what was being proposed.
Savage and a number of other Aurors were staring at Harry as he awkwardly scrambled up from his chair. He had to think of very boring things like water fountains and flowers to stop the very real danger of blushing or getting hard in front of all his coworkers.
Now Harry was picturing Draco’s balls, which wasn’t helpful in the slightest.
He was sure Malfoy had gone this way, and he was not disappointed.
“Harry Potter.”
Eventually he had drifted off to sleep there, and dreamt a restless dream—in which Draco was very naked and very moany under him, in a large bed that Harry had never seen before. When he woke later, he wouldn’t really remember the dream, though his cock very obviously did—
“Spread your legs a bit more,” Harry suggested, helping guide Draco’s arse to rock more fully down onto his cock.
Before they went anywhere though, he very much needed to take a piss.
Harry hadn’t actually expected him to have one up his sleeve, not everyone did, in fact most people didn’t, nevertheless now that he was considering the notion—
“Harry, you need to be careful. Dad always refused to talk about all the Dark Magic artifacts the Malfoy’s’ve got hoarded in that place, but it’s no secret there’s a lot of them. You have checked these over for curses first, before you brought them into the house. …Haven’t you?”
“What’s happening in Whitehall and Westminster?” Harry asked, making conversation and catching himself up as they headed for the tiny lift.
He was about to volunteer to go home when Draco asked if he wanted to help feed the peacocks.
Closing the minimal space between them, Harry leaned in to nose beneath his ear, taking in the faint hint of coconut. The unavoidable naked press of their chests was warm and wonderfully distracting.
“Not really. Could I bother you for a bit of parchment?”
“There aren’t any good permanent solutions for a lot of people, they’ll come out the other end of the system and many still need our help, which we are trying to provide—but if the cracks are there, people will keep falling through them.” She took a very deep breath. “Does that make any sense?”
Harry came with his own quaking moan and several unsteady thrusts. He’d come twice already that morning and it was painful but intensely good when Draco squeezed perfectly tight around him.
“I hope it’s helpful, it has been an awful lot of work.” And for all the work it was for him, Draco had put in even more.
Ginny appeared momentarily at a loss for words, but he braced himself for whatever question he could see brewing behind her eyes.
“What for?”
Harry shrugged. “Ready as ever.”
“You’re not helping,” he warned ineffectually.
After sorting his most pressing concerns, Harry summoned some slightly wrinkled pyjama bottoms from the large pile of clean laundry that always accumulated in front of his wardrobe.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry knew that didn’t come out very convincing, given he thought any gathering of the sort would be all dour moods and sarcasm.
Toward the center of the room was a great desk that looked to Harry to be a dark mahogany, if he was recalling his woods properly. It was surrounded on all sides by a few chairs and a settee, all of which were scattered with books and unrolled scrolls of neat notes on parchment.
Excepting of course for that bit of time last week… which had been nice enough Harry was actually considering the irrational impulse to ask for a repeat.
Harry stared a little blankly, certain he’d never had a crepe before.
His breathing went ever more uneven pushing a tangle of pants and trousers down Draco’s thighs, watching the long length of him point heavily at the mirror.
“I know you don’t want me to Obliviate you.”
However, mostly the week flew by so quickly that Harry hadn’t the time to angst about his poor choices.
The lack of space was a bit awkward, but then Draco’s cheek pressed to his collarbone, his nose nuzzled into Harry’s neck, and Harry could not have given a fuck if they were a little confined then—he wasn’t moving.
Malfoy’s forearm may have once carried the mark of Voldemort, but Harry did not believe it was ever really what he wanted, if his testimony was to be believed.
Some of the tents had finished setting up and he looked to Draco uncertainly, met with a steely resolution in the grey of his eyes.
By the time he did let up Draco’s arsecheeks were a much brighter red, and his other cheeks were nearly as flushed, panting softly when Harry pushed pale strands of hair back from his face. Urging him gently to his knees on the bed, Harry got a proper angle to bite at each cheek delicately, nosing between them to swirl at Draco’s arse with his tongue.
“Put it back in, Harry.”
“Why do you think it’s taken me so many months to get this right, Potter? I’ve accounted for all that. The wards should be able to tell the difference—that’s what all the trouble was for.”
Two hours and four extensions later, it was taking them even longer. They needed to go in after every extension to check everything had come out alright before they could move on to the next. Draco was doing most of the final inspections, and also had to temporarily magically link each tent to the manor’s water supply to test that everything was functioning as it should in the kitchens and bathrooms.
Inevitably after the prolonged emission of magic, as soon as he lowered his wand, he wavered backward unsteadily.
“Your bloody peacocks are molting. I know.”
In the midst of everything else going on in his life, he somehow found time to squeeze in a small amount of research. Unfortunately, Harry quickly discovered that his personal library—what few books he’d accumulated between school, gifts from Hermione and raiding the study at Grimmauld—was lacking in most of the subjects Malfoy had mentioned in his letter. Given he wasn’t yet prepared to bring any of it to Hermione, what little information he had uncovered in the meantime would have to do.
than strictly necessary. Draco’s scowl was halfhearted at best.
He had time to wonder at the surreality of the moment, sitting in the kitchen at Malfoy Manor discussing soup with Draco like it was the most normal thing in the world. Though at the moment, it did sort of feel like the most normal thing in the world—there was no hint of awkwardness, and as their peaceful moments in the chair had been, it was very nice—which really only added to the surreality of it all.
Impossibly smooth lips ghosted over the straining length of his cock, and Draco gripped tight around the throb of it to rub the edge of Harry’s tip against his lips, parting them just enough to flick his tongue out wetly.
Draco’s eyes narrowed at the hissing, pressing a hand to Harry’s chest in an attempt to put an inch or two of space between them.
“Sorry.”
“I would’ve done it anyway, but alright.”
“—and I’m sure the other Aurors will be wondering where you’ve got to by now.”
