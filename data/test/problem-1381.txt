So that’s why I finally decided to send this.
“Yes Mistress” Severus and Rolonda both said
Let me know if you like....
“Pay him no mind he’s just in a snit.” she said
The wildlife here makes me to nervous…
I was out walking and saw this shirt in a store window.
Giggling “Oh Gabriel.” Minnie said fluttering her eyes at him
She followed his gaze to the odd bird in the window.
I’m Sorry for everything …
“Yes Miss” Severus says without looking up
“What flamingo??” ron said while feeding the heron a donut
(Oh no just jealous-hermione)
Had a very stranger danger vibe to it .
You know he can barely feed and clothe himself.
Cas , Ron and Ginny approached her slowly.
Savior of the wizarding world my happy ass.
I’m too fair skinned...i have a horrid sunburn.
“We go get Cas back!” Dean said moving to pack his bags
I am leaving Florida and traveling to Louisanna.
(Did he find somewhere?-hermione)
(See the end of the chapter for
“No he’s hexed it….i’ll wait till i can open it safely.” Severus said watching the bird who had moved closer
Who knows...
On another note I found us a puppy...granted it’s part hellhound but it's very sweet and oh so cuddly.
Well you can’t answer the questions because i have no clue where i’m going next.
“Um Hermione one of these days you will explain to me what's going on around here right??” Harry asked
After Harry took it the bird wandered down the table and started eating some donuts.
And make sure everyone knows if they touch Harry i’ll shred them and no one will ever find the pieces.
Which of course i am...precious that is.
It's just insane
With the letters Hermione writes to Draco.
Give me the shivers...but in a bad way
But by the next morning he was jumpy again.
I of course turned him down and explained to him I was affianced.
Crowley tossed him the box.
“Yes Missy today we try fire on painting….we watch her burn.” winky said with an odd gleam in her eye.
“Kind of….sort of.” Sam and Draco said at the same time
“No” he said
“It’s for you.” she said handing it to him
Not long after a Toucan dropped a letter in front of Harry then landed on Ron's head.
I was given permission to go ahead a sit for my N.E.W.T.S and I didn't do too bad.
I saw you at Malkins that day in the alley before I knew who you were.
And maybe a mural of the forbidden forest on one wall….
“Aww bless how sweet.. Such a good boy you are.” hermione said watching Castiel preen a bit
Hermione is working out her stress as a domme
“Oh darling Draco will explain it later.” she said
Hermione and Ron stuck close.
He raised his eyebrow
“Oh my Severus….I believe he found out.” Pomona said
They had been rough weeks for Harry.
“Yes Miss” Neville said
(See the end of the chapter for
(Yeah a place there in Colorado...but why...hey-harry)
I was hurt and jealous.
But sadly it was never the attention I wanted.
“Oh Harry.” Hermione said petting his head like he was a crup.
Where on earth would a house elf find a jackhammer?
/Sam coughed/
Yours Eternally
“No schools about to be back in….he’ll write Harry just be patient.” she said
“Severus behave or no spanking later.” she called up to him
“Now I am curious our Hermione, where are you off to in such a rush.?” Fred asked trailing behind her as she walked
(See the end of the chapter for
“Alright but i’m humoring you….and it’s only because you’re such a good boy.” she said
“Pizza man??” harry asked
“Winky is that a blow torch?” she asked
YOU GAVE HIM MY LAWYERS NAME KNOWING HE HAS NO SELF RESTRAINT WHAT SO EVER
Unlike you who give me the shivers in a good way….and very inappropriate ways as well.
Draco Malfoy
In addition to that apparently the post birds are still on strike and the blond hanging around with moose and squirrel needed a letter delivered.” crowley informed them
Hermione glanced at Ron….
“Well all right dear….because you’ve all been so good.” Hermione said patting his cheek
“Immobulus” hermione said stilling the bird
It doesn’t matter just if anyone asks you have no clue who I am.
“Here birdy….come here” ron called
I ended up smacking it with a book.
“Oh yeah all the time.” neville said chuckling
I am doing my best to keep both of them fed and taken care of.
Draco drifts in the aftermath of his orgasm as Harry grabs Draco’s arse, palming his cheeks and guiding his movements. He pulls Draco closer, burying his face in the crook of Draco’s neck as his hips move up, up, up, in short, quick thrusts. When Harry comes, Draco can feel his dick twitch inside him.
“Hermione,” Harry said, and Draco frowned.
Draco engages the protective wards on the door, locks his dose of muscle relaxant in an unbreakable cabinet and casts
Potter stilled and then, slowly, pulled his fingers out. Draco rocked his hips forward, rutting against air.
“Oh, thank you alpha!” He smiled, kissing Harry’s mouth and fetching him a parchment and a quill, blinking as he expected Harry to write it down.
“How did I survive after being devoured alive, you mean?” There’s obvious pain in Malfoy’s voice and Harry is overwhelmed by a wave of guilt. That was so callous of him, and
“You may now kiss,” the Registrar said, and Harry turned to Draco, who looked at him expectantly. Harry held his face by the sides and tilted Draco’s head a little back. Harry bent a little over him, capturing his soft, pink lips on a delicate kiss. He felt the moment when Draco melted against him, and he deepened the kiss a little, moving his lips against Draco’s. He didn’t use his tongue, but he knew if he had, Draco wouldn’t have supported his legs anymore.
“Wait, you’re going now?”
“Magical bonds have an inscription inside that represent the bonded couple,” Draco said as everyone clapped at the end of their bonding ceremony. He removed his band, and Harry did the same, looking inside.
“Good!” Luna tugs at his sleeve. “I wondered if the Wrackspurts had erased your memories. It can happen if you let them.
“What do you mean?”
“Of you? I’m never tired.”
“We had fun, Potter, but it’s time to put an end to it. I’d like to be alone.”
With an air of someone on the verge of learning all the secrets of the universe, Draco lifted the band of Potter’s boxers and uncovered his cock, taking the liberty of using his hand to fully free him from their confines. He was only half-hard, as if, large as it was, it needed more time to completely fill with blood, and still it managed to feel thick and heavy in Draco’s hand. He estimated a good eight inches just like this, and he made a mental note to measure it at some point, fully hard, for his own peace of mind.
was the one playing games with the guests for once, and not the other way around, and his puffy cheeks were pink with his smile. His face was decidedly rounder than the regular pointy features he had, his body already showing the weight he put on with the pregnancy.
Stubbornly, Draco stays in the same position. “I miss my friends.”
He moved his hands reverently along Draco’s thighs, up over his arse and across his lower back before coming to rest on his thighs again.
Harry couldn’t believe his Goddaughter was already in her 4th year of Hogwarts, looking every day more like a little lady than like the child she was merely years ago. Hugo was starting Hogwarts this year, and Harry couldn’t feel more proud of them.
“What’s it to you?”
“Don’t worry,” Luna grabs his chilly hand in a gesture of support that Harry appreciates. “The Blibbering Humdingers told me, a very long time ago. They said not to seek him out, but I asked the Nargles if they wouldn’t mind setting up a colony at the Manor to cleanse the grounds and protect him.”
“Yes, papa, it’s true!” Daisy said from the end of the line, her dark hair in two pigtails, her front teeth missing.
“Would you like to?”
and that kind of thing.
On the side walls, three on one side and three on the other side were their six children. They made other portraits every year, and Draco kept the old ones in a box that he’d sometimes dig through so he could see their kids as babies once again – not considering all the photo albums the omega hoarded of the children.
“Maybe more if you’re in heat.”
“Hm… I would like to casually caress your nipples, touch them with my fingers, play with them while doing other activities, like reading or watching the telly,” Harry explained. “I would like to suck your milky nipples while sleeping, so I would sleep better. I would love to touch your pussy and caress your little cock while we have a mundane conversation. It makes me calm and sated. I don’t always want to have sex, but I
“I had to make… Awfully hard decisions to be alive in the past. Should I take the mark? Should I betray my family? Should I kill Dumbledore? Should I ask for help? Should I tell that I knew Harry Potter was in the middle of my living room with his face disfigured, or should I betray my family
happy he looked like he was going to burst in laughter any time soon. Harry felt like he did it right once again.
Harry sighed, pushing his glasses up and pressing his eyes with two fingers, trying to calm himself down. He fixed his glasses, moving to where Draco was seated and pulling him up on his lap.
“Do it, alpha… Please… Suck on me,” the omega whimpered again, and Harry complied, holding his waist and sucking a hard nipple in his mouth. There was no milk yet, but Harry sucked as if there was, his lips against his skin, his tongue resting under the nipple as the sucking motion both calmed and made Draco horny.
“I’ll be getting married next week. On Saturday,” Harry said at the Weasley’s dining table later that night, and the silence that followed was tense and heavy.
“Nothing,” said Draco. He grabbed a paper napkin and used his wand to write out his address on it. “Here’s my address, Potter. Get whatever tools you need and I’ll meet you there.”
Draco nodded, understanding where Harry was going with his talk.
“You made them sad,” Malfoy says with a nod towards Harry’s feet.
He leaves the dungeons in a hurry. Luckily, the moss on the floor spares his feet from freezing on the stone tiles, but he doesn’t linger. He’s still energised from Arctic’s antics, but it’s like drinking two shots of espresso and facing a caffeine crash. To add insult to injury, blacking out for the entire night isn’t like sleeping at all. It’s more like taking badly brewed Dreamless Sleep that doesn’t actually allow the body to rest. Draco is not looking forward to being woken by an elf if he falls asleep in the bath.
Draco licked his lips, moving himself and pushing Harry down, so his head was at the same height of Draco’s small breasts.
baby. “…you are having twins. And as it looks like, an omega boy and an alpha boy.”
. It’s seven o’clock. His stomach gurgles, protesting its missed lunch and announcing its refusal to miss dinner. If the elves serve the kind of food they served at breakfast, Draco won’t refrain from tasting it this time. He didn’t fancy an early nausea at breakfast, but Circe did these dishes look good. Food will forever be Draco’s only way of travelling and he’ll taste anything to get that sense of freedom. His arm falls back onto the mattress and he lets go of his wand, eyeing Potter’s sleeping face. The other man’s neck sports two dark lovebites that send a thrill down Draco’s spine and make Arctic stir. It’s a good thing a werewolf can’t turn someone in human form. Draco will have to make it clear that Potter is not Arctic’s mate, or things will turn ugly.
He hears footsteps and turns around, meeting Malfoy’s wide-eyed stare of bewilderment.
Harry positioned himself near the Registrar and the table they were going to write their names on the scroll. The Weasleys and his friends were waiting, and Draco arrived five minutes later with Narcissa holding his hand. They were about the same height, and Narcissa looked so happy to have him married. Draco was wearing a white tunic and skinny grey trousers, his whole appearance ethereal with his pale hair and the platinum leaf crown he was wearing. Harry smiled at him, and Draco smiled back, coming to stand at his side as his mother sat on her chair.
Draco admits defeat, to Arctic’s joy. “I’ll have lunch in my room.” From the dining room, he always has a view on the wall of thick branches sealing off the East Wing—his family’s and the Dark Lord’s former quarters—and he’s in no mood to face unwanted memories. His breathing has slowed down, but he still needs to be in a safe space. There are moments, like now, where the world kicks him in the chest and tells him he doesn’t belong, showing him his mistakes and making his past flash before his eyes. A childish part of him escapes by pushing him to hole himself up in his room.
“No, I don’t think so,” she said, and then she pulled a long roll from her purse, making Draco’s eyes go wide as she kept pulling the thing off. “You wanted me to order me a cake that would tell you if you were going to have a boy or a girl. I couldn’t do that.”
But the door squeaks slowly open, and Draco holds his breath. “Fuck.” He shuffles up onto his elbows and covers his cock as best he can with one hand while he yanks at his trousers, hoping to hide his straining erection. His cock throbs under his touch, undeterred.
reach for Harry again. He takes a steadying breath.
“That’s the dare. Take it or leave it,” Blaise says as he leans back and inspects his nails like he’s already bored by this conversation.
Harry stares, hands clenched in tight fists.
It’s still relatively early and Harry seemed suitably distracted at the Ministry Ball, but Draco knows he’ll have to be fast if he’s going to pull this off before his fellow trainees return.
It takes a quick
“Come here. Let me show you how willing I am.” Harry grabs for Draco’s hand again, but Draco pulls his wand instead.
Draco’s breathless, panting as Harry thrusts up into him. “Don’t stop, Potter.”
He cups himself through his robes and finds he is already half hard. Apparently his body never got the memo that this is crazy.
He strokes a gentle finger over Draco’s hole, teasing his rim as he pushes barely inside. When Harry presses in deeper, rubbing against his prostate, Draco whimpers.
With his cock quickly filling and arousal flooding his veins, Draco knows he’s going to see this through to the end.
Harry looks crazed, but he takes a deep breath and hums his approval. He raises his knees, bracing his heels against the bed as he pulls back slowly, then pushes all the way back in. He moves and settles into a steady rhythm.
It occurs to him that he could stop this madness. He doesn’t actually have to go through with it. It’s not like anyone is holding a wand to his head.
“What?” The confused look on Harry’s face is too fucking endearing.
“Oh — oh fucking hell,” Draco groans.
He takes another deep breath, closes his eyes, and tries to relax into the comfort of the bed. He can imagine Harry lying here and it strikes him again that this is not just any bed… but HarryfuckingPotter’s bed — the bed that Harry sleeps in, the bed that Harry wanks in.
Snuggled up in bed together, their legs tangled, Draco twines their fingers together as well and smiles. He grips Harry’s hand tighter as his eyes fall closed and he sinks into the warmth of Harry’s embrace.
He gestures to his cock, still hard and attractively flushed, standing proud against the dark hair of his groin, and Draco whimpers he wants it so much.
Draco pulls back from the kiss, committing to memory Harry's flush cheeks, his rumpled clothes, and his lips red from the force of their kisses.
Draco takes in the bright eyes and focused energy that is all Harry Potter. There’s anger there, for sure, but Draco's seen something else underneath the fury. Harry's gaze keeps straying to Draco's cock, pink and flushed and pushing out the top of Draco’s fist.
Draco gasps, arching against Harry’s mattress as he strokes his cock from tip to base and back again. He feels the pleasure build. His head drops back and his eyes fall closed as he bucks up into his hand.
“Not yet,” Harry mumbles and presses his tongue into Draco’s arse again.
Chapter 2 features the art only from our collab! ♥
“You really think you’re taking advantage of me?” Harry laughs. “Believe me when I tell you that there’s no way you could do that.”
Harry cuts a fine figure. He’s grown taller and his shoulders have broadened from Auror training. His green eyes shine bright behind his glasses.
“Yes. Fuck,” Draco whimpers. His cock bobs against his belly, leaving a sticky wet line of precome on his skin.
Harry runs his hands over the soft material again and hums, as he gathers the precome leaking at the slit of Draco’s cock with his tongue. He grips and tugs at the lace, sliding it down Draco’s legs until the knickers are left dangling off one of Draco's feet.
“I suppose that could be arranged,” Draco says.
Draco rubs at the sore spot on his wrist. “Why don’t you make me?” He raises one knee, pressing it softly between Harry’s legs.
Harry sits up and hastily finishes undressing himself. He pulls Draco up and onto his lap. Draco’s on his knees again, thighs spread wide around Harry’s hips. His fingers tremble against Harry’s shoulder where he’s gripping him tight. He can’t help but shift forward so their cocks bump against each other, aiming for whatever amount of friction he can get.
“Fuuuck,” Draco moans, his back arching when Harry reaches down and takes them both in hand. He strokes down both of their lengths with a firm grip until Draco’s foreskin pulls back to expose the leaking head of his cock. His thumb drifts over Draco’s slit spreading wetness around the head of his cock before his fingers drift lower to graze against Draco’s balls.
He slides his hand inside the soft material and is met by heat and hardness. He bites back a moan as he feathers his fingers lightly up the length of his cock.
When only Draco’s knickers are left, Harry is on him again. The sheets rustle as he settles between Draco’s spread thighs.
“Goodnight,
“Harder,” Draco demands, heels digging into Harry’s back to spur him on. ”Come on, Potter, put your back into it.” He buries his face in Harry’s neck, breathing in the rich, earthy scent of his skin and hair.
“But you're the one getting off on watching me,” Draco says, smugly. He strokes himself again and Harry’s cock gives a hearty twitch against the seam of his trousers in response.
“You’re doing so good. Just a little more,” Harry says, punctuating his words with a gentle bite to the curve of Draco’s arsecheek.
Draco slides off Harry’s lap and wonders if he should leave — it’s not like he was invited into Harry’s bed — but Harry grabs hold of him, with a strong arm wrapped around his waist and pulls him close.
Draco straightens the papers in front of him into a tidy stack and does the same for his emotions. He rises from his desk, smoothing non-existent wrinkles from his vest then takes his reports to the filing area. The filing area in the Auror Office is a pigeon hole shelf with labeled holes for different types of crimes. Draco rolls his reports and sticks them into the correct slots. The papers are sucked away to be reviewed by Robards and the higher ups then go to whatever poor souls have to do all the filing for the Ministry. Reports only ever come back if there’s something wrong with them and Draco’s reports never, ever come back.
They have an instant effect on Harry. Harry puts his wand away and cups the side of Draco’s face. “Let me take care of you. I’m your partner and I do owe you since this could have easily been me. As long as you’re okay with me staying.”
Harry closes the space between them and places a short kiss on Draco’s cheek. Draco is really going to have to talk to Harry about kissing him at work, but not today.
“I’m just going to clean the blood off your side.”
Draco pulls out his wand and looks over his shoulder. Everyone is going about their business and no one is looking his way. He takes cautious steps up to his desk and casts silent charms to detect poison or magic. They all come up negative.
“Oh yes, please. Your gingersnaps are the best.” Harry’s smile brightens as Gatty blushes with the praise.
Draco nods and walks back to his office, hands in his pockets and mentally making notes of what he needs to do. He stops in the doorway of his office.
Draco marshalls his courage and closes the heated space between them. He slides his hand into Potter’s robe and along his hip. “I’d like to kiss you.”
Harry presses a soft kiss against Draco’s lips. “Stop worrying about something being out of place.”
Draco frowns at the note. He didn’t order food. Draco sends an affirmative reply and waits for the runner with a blooming curiosity. The runner comes along three minutes later, pink cheeked and young.
Draco cups Harry’s face in his hands, drops his leg, leans forward, and pulls Harry into a long, lazy kiss. “You are the most amazing person I’ve ever met. I love you,” he murmurs against Harry’s lips.
“I was so fucking tired of calling you Malfoy when all I could think of was yelling your name while I came down your throat.” Harry pulls Draco’s hair.
“Didn’t want to travel,” Draco grits out through clenched teeth. He opens one eye and looks at Harry. “I knew you’d take care of me.”
Harry blushes, that beautiful darkening of Harry’s skin that Draco is becoming addicted to. Harry is still naked so he can see how the blush travels down Harry’s cheeks and neck and across the top of his chest. “I pay attention to you.”
Another clerk calls his name, he gets up to grab his lunch, and returns to his table. He eats his sandwich, it’s as delicious as always, and thinks about who would be so kind to him.
“Thank you, Gatty. You’re very kind.”
Draco kisses Harry again. “I’m glad you did them. I was hoping it was you the entire time.”
“I’ll do a little first aid once we get this taken care of. It’s fine.” Draco is lying. The pain is getting worse and he can feel the dampness of blood on his shirt underneath his vest and cloak.
A harsh laugh escapes Draco, and Harry jerks at the sound. “Fuck Harry, I’m the one who should be apologizing to you, but we’ve moved past all that. Or I thought we had. The real question is, why are you doing this? Why are you here? Why do you care?” Draco whispers the last question and his hand tightens where it still grips Harry’s shoulder.
Blue hair shakes their head. “Sorry, mate. Morning manager left already and she said the person asked to not be described to you. Said you’d know who it was and that was all we were allowed to say.”
Draco allows himself to smile at Potter. “The idiots across the way who think they’re involved in actual criminal activities haven’t bothered to put up a significant ward or charm to protect them except a muggle camera in the front of the building and a ward that will alert them when someone comes through the front door.”
Harry runs his hand down Draco’s arm. “I’m going to heal this and then you and I are going to have a nice long chat about keeping things like this from your partner.” Draco nods, pain filled eyes tracking Harry’s movements. Harry reaches behind Draco and turns off the shower.
He eats the pie and continues working late into the night.
“Sorry, your order’s been paid.”
Draco sits, smooths his hair, and mumbles, “I’m surrounded by Gryffindors.”
Unfortunately for both himself and Malfoy, they’d chosen a profession that, while it helped with some of the guilt, put them in the line of fire more often than naught. Harry’s gut twisted and he stood, sending off the paperwork he’d just finished with a wave of his wand. Malfoy still wasn’t back and the worry in his gut was growing. Malfoy had been stiff and a little more pale than usual when they’d returned. Harry trails his fingers over the top of Malfoy’s desk and walks through the warren of offices and cubicles.
Draco puts his hands on his hips and feels eyes on his neck. He turns and Potter is there, watching him. Draco can feel a flush stain his cheeks and he wonders how much of the  conversation Potter overheard.
“I’m so sorry.” Harry presses gentle kisses down the length of the scar, moving onto the one that is still red and bruised from the events of the day.
Draco kisses Harry as the water runs over them and it feels like a new beginning.
Draco doesn’t encourage that kind of gentle devotion in others. He receives his fair share of hate mail, though it’s more infrequent these days, but he’s never had anyone get to know his likes and quirks. Even his own mother doesn’t know what kind of tea and pies he likes best or where he purchases them.
Potter’s eyes are wide when they meet his. He licks his lips, his eyes darting down to Draco’s lips before darting back up. “I’ll always come when you ask me to.”
Gatty turns to Potter and Potter nods at him. “Gatty trusts Auror Potter. Auror Potter helped Gatty and some under Gatty's care many, many times and said Gatty should tell you what Gatty knows.” The house-elf clears his throat. “Two weeks ago, a werewolf came here looking for shelter. Gatty has a special room for them, if they need it on the full moon, and it was open so Gatty let her stay. Gatty's never had any trouble, you see, and doors aren't locked or nothing like that. People are wandering in at all hours of the night and day, but this is a safe place.”
Potter’s eyes dart to him and he sits carefully beside Draco. “Are you all right, mate? That curse looked nasty.”
Potter takes a step forward as the witch turns and steps back, raising her wand. She smiles, wide and with menace. “It’s either a very slow day at the Ministry or they must really think I’m something to send the Saviour and the Traitor after me. I must admit, I’m a bit flattered.”
Draco escapes, grateful that Potter is taking over the tedium of paperwork. Draco doesn’t hate the minutiae of filling out reports, but he doesn’t think he could concentrate on it at the moment. He limps down to the showers, his side a bloom of fire.
Potter opens the memo and raises his eyebrows a bit before handing it over to Draco. Draco scans the paper, pulling the details he needs and rolls them around his head. There’s a suspected dark wizard holed up in a bookstore in Bath, causing some problems for the Muggles in the area near the shop. It’s not a high risk mission and something they should be able to take care of before the end of the day.
“Auror Malfoy, I’m sorry for your loss. Do you know who we can contact?”
Potter is beside him, a blush darkening his already brown skin. “Sorry, Malfoy. I was thinking about the new case you got assigned yesterday. Hermione wants to talk to you about it. She thinks it might be related to the legislation she’s working on. Told me to tell you to swing by later today to talk to her.”
Draco runs a hand over his hair, smoothing it back from his face. He knows he’s vain about his hair. He keeps it long, like his father did, but his hair has a slight wave like his mother’s and he sees Potter follow his movements with his eyes. He absolutely does not do an internal preen at his hair being noticed.
“Salazer, Potter watch where you’re going.” Draco kneels down and starts picking up the papers littering the floor.
Ginny rolls her eyes at Draco. “It’s a good thing you’re pretty because when it comes to people, you’re a bit thick.”
Potter turns to him, his smile open and without artifice. “That was nice of someone then.”
Draco nods. “That’s understandable.”
When the lift opens onto the Auror floor, Weasley spots him and comes running, which is never a good sign.
Draco deflates a little. He’s not sure what he expected - for Potter to confess, maybe - but Draco is seized with irritation. If Potter admired him, if he felt flames every time Draco was near the same way that Draco did when Potter was anywhere close to him why wouldn’t he admit it? Draco tears his eyes from Potter, who is no longer looking at him, and Draco straightens his spine.
Harry pulls his wand from the holster on his leg and shifts so he can get a better look at the injury. He does his level best to not look at Draco’s naked body, but his eyes do flick down of their own accord before settling to the task at hand. Harry shuffles that brief glance into a small hiding place for later when he’s alone.
Draco sighs and Harry gulps past years of longing and rinses the soap out of Draco’s hair. There is a washcloth sitting next to Draco and Harry picks it up next.
Harry yanks his shirt the rest of the way off and they fall back onto the bed. Draco twists so that Harry goes down first and Draco covers him with his body. They’re the same height and everything lines up in the most exquisite and aggravating way because they still have too many layers of clothes between them. Harry’s hips arch up into Draco, and Draco’s body responds as if there is nothing it’s ever wanted more than this.
Padma takes Draco’s seat. “Get me one.”
“I’m going to take off my shirt so I’m not completely sopping before the end.” Harry is using a soft tone, afraid taking off parts of his clothing will cause Draco to bolt out of the shower. The idea is amusing to Harry, given that Draco is sitting in the shower naked as if they do this every day.
“Salazar, Harry, your mouth.” Draco licks his lips and smiles at Harry as he slides his mouth slowly over Harry’s straining cock.
“I completed the preliminary interviews today and I went to see Granger to keep her updated. Thanks for that help. She had some information that was enlightening. Now, I’m trying to find where all the pieces fit.” Draco leans his hip against his desk and meets Potter’s gaze.
Draco’s mouth thins. “Your endorsement is illuminating indeed.”
Harry opens the door slowly—giving Malfoy the chance to do what, Harry doesn’t know—and what he sees shifts the floor under his feet.
Draco puts his saucer and cup on the table next to the bed. “How much attention do you pay to me?”
Draco slams his fist on the desk and snatches his wand from its holster to cast a healing charm over his chest. The skin loses its angry red coloring and lightens to a bright pink. Draco leans over and swipes up the jar of salve and screws open the lid. The smell of lavender fills his nose and calms his racing heart. Draco gathers up his composure and puts it back on like armor. By the time he is rebuttoning his vest, his hands are steady and his heart slow.
Granger elbows Weasley in the ribs. “Ow, ‘Moine.”
Granger laughs. “You two are just as adorable as I knew you would be.”
“Could be an alias.” Draco scribbles down notes. “Anything else?”
Draco doesn’t answer Harry right away. He shifts so he can unbutton and unzip Harry’s trousers. Draco pulls Harry’s trousers and pants down at the same time, revealing Harry’s twitching cock, it’s end glistening with precome. Draco runs a hand over himself and his mouth waters at the sight.
Draco’s spell is a fraction after hers, a fraction that makes all the difference. “Stupefy.”
It’s rather foolish, he admits to himself, that there is one person he wishes would be interested in him enough to make these kinds of gestures and overtures. One person whom he would welcome as a romantic partner, one person who fills Draco with need and want that is tangible. It’s been years since Draco has admitted that there is one weakness to which he has never found the cure. Draco’s desire that his admirer be a man with bright green eyes and a scar on his forehead will not make it so.
When they were first paired together, Harry had been hesitant, resentful on the worst days, but over the last two years, Harry had come to respect Malfoy. He is a talented wizard whose quick thinking has saved Harry on more than one occasion. Like today. Malfoy took the curse that was meant for Harry without hesitation. The worry for Malfoy pushes at him again, and Harry hurries to finish so he can go check on his partner.
Draco chuckles. He hasn’t had Milky Buttons since he was a child. He always had to sneak the Muggle candy with help from the house-elf that ended up being set free by Potter. Dobby was his name, if Draco remembers correctly. His father hadn’t shut up about that insult for months. Draco pops one of the candies in his mouth and sucks on it as it melts. He pens out a note to Gatty and sends it via a messenger to the house-elf before he forgets.
“Merlin’s beard, Malfoy. You all right?”
Draco leans forward, slowly like he’s giving Harry time to change his mind, which really is laughable, and Harry closes the gap, moving faster than Draco. The press of their lips is chaste, and Harry pulls back enough to see Draco’s face, eyes wide and searching, before Harry palms the back of Draco’s head and drags him back down for another kiss.
“See you tomorrow, Malfoy.”
When Draco is putting the last of their notes together to send to Robards so a team can be assembled, Granger shows up in the doorway of his office.
The showers on the Auror level are large and sparkling with grey and white tile. Off the main room there’s a sauna, showers, and soaking tubs. Draco heads to the showers and goes into the one on the far end. The door is mostly opaque glass and leads into a small room where Draco pulls off his cloak, hissing as the movements stretch the place where the curse hit him. He unbuttons his vest and it peels away, revealing a patch of sticky blood on his nice shirt. Draco removes the ruined shirt, then reaches over to start the shower before inspecting the damage on his side.
Harry chuckles and Draco is close enough to Harry that he can feel it rumble over his chest. The sound is so much better up close.
Draco licks his lips, his pupils wide as he nods. “Yes, please, Harry.”
Potter relaxes. “Great. I can leave anytime you’re ready.”
Padma and Ginny show up a short time later, hand in hand and laughing at a shared joke. Over these nights of drinking, Draco has become closer to Ginny and then Padma after the two started dating. Draco smiles as they approach the table.
“Merlin, I’m sorry. Malfoy are you all right?” Harry waves his wand and dries the tea and cleans Draco’s robes.
“I got your message, Harry.” She looks between the two of them and her smile widens. “I’m glad to see that you two have talked through some things.”
“Disgusting you mean,” Weasley says over her shoulder.
Harry’s smile is gentle as he cups Draco’s face. “I’ll go make us some tea.” Draco starts to get up off the bed, but Harry pushes him back down with a hand on his shoulder. “No, you stay. I’ll go.”
Draco unbuttons his trousers and divests himself of the rest of his clothes with deliberation because Harry’s eyes are glittering with greed and want as they follow his every move. Draco stalks back to the bed and crawls over Harry until he can cover him again, bracing himself on his arms. Draco kisses Harry, and Harry’s hands are everywhere, running over Draco, leaving a path of fire in their wake. Every time their cocks slide together, Draco stops breathing. By the time Draco breaks the kiss, they’re both shaking with need.
Draco can smell the meat pie in the bag before he opens it. It’s from the bakery near his flat - he recognizes the paper bag because he gets this meal on the days he works late and doesn’t have time to cook when he gets home. Draco doesn’t know who would know his habits enough to send this to him, but it must be a coincidence. There isn’t anyone who would take the time to know Draco well enough or care about him enough to make sure he ate. The truth of that stings more than it should, but it’s a reality Draco has lived with for a long time now.
“Yes, of course. I need to follow up on this.” Draco stops Potter from leaving with a hand on his arm. Draco can feel Potter’s muscles tense under his touch and a curl of
Draco makes a non-committal noise.
“Stop repeating my words back to me.” Potter blows out a breath.
It’s close enough to the end of the war that there are still pockets of dark wizards, hunched and waiting for a Dark Lord that will never reappear, causing occasional havoc. Draco admits that he and Potter make an excellent team in the field. Each apprehension they perform is another tick on the score he is keeping. It’s never enough to make up for the pain Draco had caused—it will never be enough—but it is the only thing he knows to do. The least he can do was right some of the damage his family has done and keep Potter safe. Draco has always known some people held more worth than others, but he had no idea he would be so far down the queue.
“Point taken. It’s lovely to see you Luna. Good evening, everyone else,” he says to the table at large. Draco tries and fails to ignore the tingling on his side next to Potter.
The clerk, a young witch with short black hair, makes some notes on the papers in front of her and touches her wand to a bowl on her desk. A paper bird flaps up from the bowl and flies through the hallway behind her.
It does though. A small pile of things heap upon the already miserable day.
He reaches for his cock, but Harry bats his hands away.
“Fuck, Draco, what are you wearing?” Harry rocks his hips, cock grinding against Draco’s in a slow glide with nothing but soft lace between them.
“Be careful, you absolute beast. This shirt’s designer.” Draco shoves half-heartedly at Harry's chest before pulling him close again. ”It’s well documented that you have no fashion sense, but please have some respect for those of us who do.” The last words are nearly lost against Harry’s lips.
The biting-bruising kiss builds with the enormity of their shared history and holds the same intensity of their previous years of fighting. Then Harry plunges his tongue inside Draco’s mouth and the kiss turns softer with a hunger so profound it leaves Draco feeling dizzy.
“Are you really always a prat?” Harry asks, eyes darkened with lust, lips parted. He looks at Draco like he’s covered in treacle tart, so Draco doesn’t mind the insult overly much.
In a wild bid to appear unaffected — perhaps that last drink hit him harder than he thought — he lounges back on Harry’s pillow, his shirt riding up again as he palms his cock. His erection has flagged a bit, but it’s still a healthy handful. He pushes the lace down around his balls, letting his cock grow under Harry’s intense gaze.
“A Malfoy does no such thing,” he promises. Draco would rather die than admit defeat.
He runs one finger along the rim of his empty glass and takes a moment to look around the room, taking in the holiday decorations. There are a myriad of Christmas trees all lit with fairy lights and decorated with delicate baubles. Wreaths of greenery and holly hang around the room.
“I think you know I am.” He smirks back at Harry, digging his heels into his arse.
Harry makes a satisfied sound and lifts Draco’s leg higher. He grips Draco’s arse cheeks, spreading them wide as he licks another broad stripe from Draco’s hole up to his balls.
Draco tries to free his arms and this time Harry lets him. Harry moves his hands to Draco’s robes instead.
He grabs Draco’s wrists and pins them behind his back. Draco grinds against Harry and lets his head fall back on another moan as he bucks against Harry’s hold and considers what it says about him that he enjoys it so much when Harry takes charge.
They’re closer than before and Harry’s grip on Draco’s robes goes so tight that his knuckles turn white.
“Oh, you think my mouth’s pretty do you?” Draco feels like the bedroom around him is spinning.
He lifts his head to watch his dick strain upward until the tip pushes past the top waistband. He shoves the knickers lower, hissing between his teeth as the fabric brushes over the head of his erection.
They're right, of course. Harry's smiling, surrounded by his friends as he accepts a fresh drink from Longbottom’s hand.
admit it.
They’ve done some insane things in the name of the game, but this one takes the bloody biscuit. It’s Harry Potter, for fuck’s sake. Of course this is no random dare. His friends know how Draco feels. And you’d think that after everything, the hero of the wizarding world should be off limits.
”Damn it, Malfoy.” The grip on Draco’s wrist is even tighter than before.
Draco’s friends are the absolute
“You can move. Fuck me.”
Harry grips Draco’s waist, hands sliding under the loosened waistband of his trousers. His fingers move over lace and silk as he cups Draco’s arse with both hands.
“Fucking-fuck, Potter. Fuck me already,” Draco says with a lusty groan.
Draco
doing here?”
Their hands meet on Draco’s cock, wrapping around his length in tandem, and it’s enough. It only takes two pulls before Draco's balls are drawing up.
“Almost there. You’re being so good for me,” Harry mumbles against the sensitive skin of Draco’s inner thigh. His free hand glides over Draco’s hip and Draco let’s the sound of Harry's voice wash over him, stretching and preening beneath his touch.
“Come on, Potter. Admit it.” Draco runs a finger over the vein of his cock, thumbing the silky-soft top as it throbs to life again. “You like watching me stroke myself.” He tightens his grip and gives one long, luxurious stroke from bottom to top, squeezing the tip just as he likes.
“Please don’t open. Please don’t open,” he begs the door in a low whisper, his cock still hard and straining in his grip.
“I’ll tell you when you can come,” Harry promises.
Harry palms Draco’s arse. He slaps it, sharply, once as they move together, their cocks sliding against one another in a smooth glide.
Harry tugs at the edge of Draco’s knickers until his cock slips free of the silky material once again. Draco takes a deep breath as their cocks slide against one another, a shudder coursing through him at the contact.
Harry rolls towards him and Draco allows himself to be pulled into Harry’s arms as their lips meet again. He tugs Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth, tongue darting out to soothe the sting.
“You won’t find a better opportunity.” Pansy nods towards the table where Harry and his friends are sitting.
After a long moment with their foreheads pressed together, breathing each other’s air, Harry slowly pulls out, reaches for his wand, and casts a series of cleaning spells over them both.
sanity; now he’s questioning his own since he’s actually agreeing to go along with this dare.
still want to do this?”
He gasps and trembles as Harry's breath ghosts over the tip of Draco’s cock.
person he will never have a chance with.
“Fuck, fuck, fuck. Potter —” The amount of self control it takes him to climb off of Harry’s lap is physically painful.
Draco grabs both of his legs under his knees and spreads himself as wide as possible as Harry’s slippery fingers fuck slow and gentle into his hole.
Harry turns, and for a moment he just stares dumbly at Draco. He's still rubbing his sore elbow.
Draco raises his chin and lifts his shoulders in a half shrug.
“There’s quite a bit of you that’s pretty.” Harry's eyes travel down Draco’s body. “It’s just a shame you’re such a wanker.”
“I wish you’d stay.”
“You’re unfuckingbelievable.” Harry shakes his head. “After all this time, is this really still fun for you? Don’t you have anything better to do with your time than try to get a rise out of me?”
“Please,” Draco breathes. “I can’t do this,” he says, but his hands still have a tight grip on Harry’s robes.
“That would be lovely, Potter,” said Draco. “I was serious about it being an antique, though, please be careful.” The orgasm was making him feel much more relaxed than usual and he couldn’t find the energy to berate poor Potter, who had turned out to be something of a sex god. He held out a hand and helped him off the bed, trying (and failing) to avoid blushing when Potter kissed him again, this time more of a peck, before going for his abandoned toolbox completely starkers.
“Right,” said Draco after a moment. Near the bar, over Potter’s shoulder, he could see Granger watching them suspiciously and decided now was not the time to try and goad Potter into making a move. “Erm — thanks for getting my wallet. See you round, Potter.”
…!” Draco moaned louder, spreading his legs as far as they could go, bucking his hips like crazy. “Fuck me, alpha! Please, please, fuck me! Breed me! Fill me up with come, fuck a baby into me!”
Draco doesn’t give him the satisfaction of an answer and leads him to the dungeons. They look nothing like they did when Potter was locked up there with his friends; it’s more like a tunnel dug into the dirt, with tree roots hanging everywhere. Draco is more than grateful that the Manor keeps insects away—the fireflies Potter mentioned the other day are sentient faerie orbs, they don’t have legs, and they don’t buzz. Arctic loves nature and doesn’t care if he rolls into the dirt and is covered in spiders and millipedes but Draco hides from fruit flies, so no, nothing in his house would crawl up his nose at night. In the greenhouse, however, it’s a different story.
“It’s arranged, isn’t it? You hired a company to arrange you a marriage.”
him in there made Draco’s body buzz with anticipation, and as Potter was crouching down to have a better look at the frame Draco took off his robes and his tie and undid the top button of his shirt. Potter looked back at him, and his eyes went immediately to the patch of newly bared skin, cheeks flushing. Draco’s blood roared.
When he’s done, he grabs the throw blanket he wrapped himself in last night before going to bed, when he was too hung up on the kiss and his worries about the transformation. He cleans it fully with a wave of his fingers. Now it smells like fresh linen. He folds it and heads downstairs. The Manor shows him the way to the dining room by making tiny vines and roots open up a path. Harry is walking barefoot; for some reason, it seems wrong to walk with his trainers on.
of Harry’s cock.
Hermione’s stunned silence is broken by Ron’s loud guffaws before she gathers her wits and presses her finger into Harry’s chest. “Are you telling me,” she whispers with a dangerous gleam in her brown eyes, “that we involved the Department of Mysteries, not only in the UK but in
“Like this?”
. He still has some time. He undresses slowly so Arctic doesn’t tear his clothes later. With shaking hands, he undoes the last button down his front. He should meditate, but how is he supposed to do that in this state? His cock is full and heavy between his legs and his lips are still tingling from the pressure and warmth of Potter’s mouth and Merlin, how is Draco going to face him next time? Will Potter even come back? For a second, he’s certain he accidentally locked him in the lab which would be hilarious, but no, he left the door open in his frazzled flight.
Hermione laughed, standing up with a huge grin on her face.
“You fuck me,” he mumbled against his damp skin. “Do you need step-by-step instructions, Potter?”
. Unbelievable, really. No sooner had he said it than one of Potter’s fingers was circling his rim, like he wanted to explore the way it felt first, before finally sliding it inside. It felt exquisite, the way he sank all the way in, pulled out, and did it again.
It’s not always easy—it’s
“Yes, well, the tension was annoying me. So there. Sorry, it won’t happen again, I don’t know what I was thinking, I must investigate the lab’s ventilation spells, perhaps the fumes—”
“Listen, Ryan-“
Draco freezes and breaks the kiss, almost tripping over the chair as he steps back. “Not here.”
get pregnant, even out of heat, was such a turn on. The animal side in him took over as he filled Draco with his seed, and he moved his head, biting the omega’s neck, breaking skin, marking him and bonding them forever, in a much deeper, more profound way. Draco howled in pleasure, squeezing around Harry’s knot and biting him back, their bond shifting and completing as they licked the wounds so they would heal.
Draco huffs, tightening the robe around his hips to preserve his modesty. “I’ll bathe first.”
“What do you mean?” he said when he turned back.
Harry Apparates to Ron and Hermione’s house in Cornwall, narrowly missing a bush of ripe blackberries and automatically embracing the ambient chaos before anyone even sees them. The garden is a mess, very much like the Burrow. There’s a long table next to the cabbage patch and lanterns floating in the sky like the candles in the Great Hall. If Harry didn’t know about Ron’s housekeeping and decorating talents, he would believe Molly prepared everything. But no, it’s all Ron. Like mother like son.
, fucked Draco over the table.
“Fuck,” he heard Potter whisper, something about the expletive criminally hot coming from him. “You’re really good at that, Malfoy.”
“Do you think I can convince Grimmauld Place to become a forest?”
“You told me to come with an open mind,” Harry said, looking into Malfoy’s grey eyes. “I did. I’m willing to see where we go. But are you?”
Malfoy touches his scars. “I see.” He stands up and walks past the piano, fingers lingering on the keys, before facing the glass sheltering the room from the cold. “What are you planning?”
“You little bitch!” Harry exclaimed, but he was laughing, and Draco was too.
Harry didn’t actually participate in the tea party. He was still a bit weird around Draco’s friends and, to be honest, tea parties weren’t his thing. He much better preferred eating junk food and talking shit about Quidditch teams. The fact was that he’d do anything to make Draco smile, but he was thankful his husband didn’t ask him to be there.
Well, sex was something Harry knew how to do. The talking was the difficult part. He grabbed Draco by his waist and lifted him, pulling him against his chest. Draco hugged his hips with his legs, his arms resting over Harry’s shoulders.
Blaise leans forward with an interested gleam in his dark eyes while Greg mentions he’s married to Potter’s cousin, which is still so fucking odd to hear even if Draco knew it already. He makes the mistake of calling Potter “Harry” when he explains about the Black family tapestry, and that’s all it takes.
Harry sighs. The sofa is a bit like sitting on a cloud, but this is still so very awkward. “I saw your name on the Black family tapestry. Without a date of death.”
’re the one that keeps taking my sheets over my cute body because you want to cuddle.”
LIST OF PREFERENCES WITHOUT A MATCH – SIDE BY SIDE
anything.
In the letter, his future omega asked him to be open-minded. That could mean a lot of things, but Harry was trying not to think about that part. He gave his name in the lobby, and waited about five minutes before being led to another room, where they would be introduced.
“What do you think you’re doing?” Malfoy blurts out. He’s—okay, he’s bloody cute right now. It’s weird. He has the soft look of someone who just got out of bed, rubbing his eyes with the sleeve of an oversized sweater. It’s Muggle; Harry can see the tag because Malfoy put it on backwards. His hair has been recently dried with magic, which gives it a fluffy appearance and makes it stick out a bit.
“Hey, Malfoy,” he said buoyantly, sliding into Pansy’s seat.
Draco had never hugged Hermione before, but now it was definitely the time. He hugged her tight, not knowing what to say, so he blurted the first thing in his mind.
Harry could barely sleep that night.
Harry laughed because it was so absurd. Draco
Harry frowned, his hand stopping hot and warm over Draco’s sex.
“Then spread this pussy for me,” Harry said, loving how the word
Draco expected Harry’s reaction to be big. He expected him to throw him over the table and fuck him to oblivion. He expected him to dance around the house and get overexcited by the news. What he didn’t expect, though, was the sob that left Harry’s mouth, and the tears falling down his cheeks.
, alpha… But, here’s the thing… I wanted to use
Instead of fingers, he felt the head of Potter’s cock pressing against his hole and Draco let out an involuntary moan.
Draco isn’t dead. What in the world is happening? Does anyone know? Do any of his friends? No, there’s no way; they would’ve told him. Harry lets out the breath he’s been holding, and figures he needs to find out
“We’re not having it!” Harry screamed after him, but the only reply he had was silence.
…” Draco’s breath faltered for a second when Harry bit him on his shoulder, licking down to his breast.
“Are you wearing something on your lips?” Potter interrupted. Draco blinked at him, taken off guard.
“I can do that!” said Potter, looking again like an excited dog. His eyes were so bright as to be almost unnatural. “I’m really good with Muggle tools and stuff, I had to use them all the time at the Dursleys’.”
“I’ll draw some decoys at home, and once the baby is born, we can add either a little dragon or a little deer to the walls,” she told him softly, and Harry couldn’t thank her enough. Draco baked her a whole cake, which she decided to share with him. Bad idea, really, because Draco ate half of it in a single sitting.
love you.”
He can’t help it: he sweeps his dearest friend into a hug, and her laugh sounds like chimes in the wind.
“Is Master Draco wanting Tipsy to drown the intruders into the pond?”
“I’m not planning anything. I just don’t understand,” Harry ends up saying after a loud exhale.
It was almost too easy, and Draco tried not to let too much of his triumph show on his face. Instead, he frowned a little.
Malfoy was compared to him. He could easily wreck that omega.
“He’s such a
Harry went up to his and Draco’s bedroom, finding his husband half-dressed, looking at himself in the mirror. He was wearing black, pregnancy leggings and a white top, half-opened and revealing his baby bump.
“What did I say about dead people?”
“Almost a month along. I wanted to be completely sure before telling you, but… Yeah. We’re having a Potter baby soon.”
“That’s really great,” Potter said earnestly. His vividly green eyes shined with sincerity. “I’m glad to hear it. I’ve been playing Quidditch,” he said and pointed redundantly at his shirt, this one sporting
An hour later, Draco was sleeping soundly on his hospital bed, and Harry was admiring his two baby boys in their bassinets. After they were fed – with a little bit of manoeuvring because Draco was adamant on feeding both of them at the same time – they slept on Draco’s chest for a moment before Draco was out cold.
“But… Draco, it would mean a lot to me if I could honour my father or my mother. Their memories are…
,” Draco replies, a hint of his old sneer colouring his voice. He’s protecting himself with superior airs, but Tipsy isn’t phased. Arctic’s contentment at the sound of Potter’s name is distracting. “If you ban him, he’ll find another way in. He’s stubborn like that.” Arctic perks up; he likes stubbornness, it makes play a lot more fun.
Pansy did have a point, though, he thought with a little spark of anticipation. It couldn’t hurt, at least, to make a grab for his attention and see what happened, could it?
The conversation turns sour instantly, and Harry hates himself for it. Malfoy’s smile vanishes and his shoulders tense a little, enough to be noticed. “What’s it to you?” he spits.
He Conjured lube and started stroking, twisting his wrist and squeezing around the head, watching Potter’s face as he did it and delighting in the wonder he saw there. And
“This and that,” Draco said with a brave attempt at nonchalance. “I do accounting at the ministry right now. Easy enough and it makes for good financial security.”
When he felt Potter starting to tense up he pulled off with a small pop, pulling another curse out of him. Without preamble, Draco stood up, undid his trousers, and pulled them and his pants off, drawing Potter’s eyes instantly.
sweet … it hardly mattered. He just wanted a shag.
Scorpius was tiny and red. He had only a bit of blond fuzz over his head, and his lungs were powerful when he cried. The mediwitch put his small son on Draco’s bare chest so they could bond while they waited for his second son.
“You promised me a honeymoon to Fiji and New Zealand and that’s where we’re going, full stop.” He pauses, and kisses Harry again, pushing until they’re flush against each other. “Also, you’re taking me to Ahvaz. I can’t get that smell out of my nose and I need to know the place it comes from, and meet your friends. I’m sure they have stories about your legendary stupidity. I’m still not over the fact that you had a barbecue in the desert and got stuck in a sandstorm.”
“Yes, alpha!”
this happy.”
Malfoy licks his lips and pushes his chair back. The throw blanket falls under the table. Harry’s first gesture is slow, one hand moving to touch Malfoy’s waist, but when Malfoy wraps his arms around him and pulls him close, Harry’s fingers tighten on the soft fabric of his sweater. Their noses touch. It’s not like yesterday; there’s something more to it now. Harry isn’t sure what it is, but he leans in first, and it’s not a devouring passion that leaves him breathless this time, it’s the feather-light caress of warm, slightly chapped lips against his own, the release of a soft breath, and the taste of honey and Earl Grey. It’s Malfoy bringing them as close as he can, the press of a firm chest against Harry’s, fingernails tickling the back of his neck.
“I’ve been places. Kinda looking for a home now, and your home looks much nicer than Grimmauld.”
, Potter, for Christ’s sake.” He shoved Potter’s chest, unbalancing him so that he fell to his arse on the bed. He watched Draco get to his knees in front of him with a renewed look of awe. “And take off your shirt, will you?”
He tasted sweet, his slick like honey on his mouth. Harry pressed his tongue inside his folds, tongue fucking him, hugging Draco’s thighs as he tasted him completely. The omega moaned, his body arching away from the bed, his nipples begging to be played with. Harry sucked his tiny cock whole, bobbing his head and twirling his tongue around the tiny hardness of it, dragging his foreskin down and licking around the head.
doesn’t actually
“Really?” Harry whispered, and Draco smiled, nodding as he grabbed Harry’s hand, putting it over his stomach.
Draco’s pregnancy went by smoothly. Hermione commented on how surprised she was with how nice his pregnant body seemed to be on him. Draco replied that it was because
“It’s… It’s okay, Harry,” he mumbled, not knowing what to do. He just waited there, hands awkwardly touching Harry’s broad back as his alpha cried on his shoulder.
“I… I’m not sure it’s
“Nonsense,” said Draco, cutting Potter off before he could start backtracking. “Pansy and I were done anyway, weren’t we? I
“So was I!”
“Hnn… It’s… Oh, fuck, they are sensitive,” Draco moaned, and Harry chuckled against his hair. “It’s…”
He was happy they were having this now, even when he wasn’t on board with it before. Having his omega smile like that was too precious.
It didn’t take long.
“I think we should. Our house is big enough that we can have about 50 people. Maybe more, if we use some magic to make our living room bigger and transform it into a ball room…” He babbled, and Harry lost it.
“Does make sense,” Charlie grumbled, shoving food down his throat as if they weren’t discussing Harry’s upcoming marriage to Draco Malfoy.
“It can’t. We only have about two months before they arrive,” Draco smiled cockily, and Harry wanted to punch him with a kiss. His husband was as beautiful as he was infuriating.
one of our friends who can keep a secret,” Harry reasoned, and Draco chuckled in agreement.
, and Pansy, Gin and—bugger, Terry Boot are dancing on the table while everyone else tries to sing along—those who still can and know the song, because others, like Dean and Millicent, are slurring their words and can’t stand up anymore, and Horatio passed out a while ago. Neville and Hannah are checking on him once in a while.
He takes one step into the dark and he smells the scent of grass, wood and dirt. He frowns until his eyesight adjusts and when it does, his jaw falls to the floor.
“Okay,” Potter said, shifting a little again and gripping Draco’s arse with his free hand while he redoubled the efforts of the other. He could feel the stretch of his rim around those thick fingers, the way it reluctantly began to loosen with each deep press inside. He started pushing back against it, and when Potter tightened his grip to keep him in place Draco moaned into the crook of his elbow. “Stay still,” he said, stuffing in a third one now, like he was finally finding his footing and becoming comfortable enough to take some control. It wasn’t quite a command, though, as much as an insistent request, because he seemed to feel he had a handle on things.
The alpha smiled against his lips, holding him close to his heart.
“Oh, you’re not a virgin, are you? Of course I mean sex,” Draco stood up, hands on his hips.
Merlin, that’s exactly it. Arctic finds it widely entertaining, and Draco sniffs haughtily and brushes lint off his robes. They fit him like gloves, framing his torso, hugging his waist and flaring at the hips. He’ll ignore the fact that they look almost exactly like Snape’s favourite outfit. They’re sturdy and imbued with protection spells, perfect for potion-making. Draco wonders how he would survive without the elves going shopping on his behalf; without these work robes, he might one day brew in his silk pyjamas and that’s a recipe for disaster.
Andromeda is linked to crazy-eyed Bellatrix and a peaceful-looking Narcissa, whose death is marked as September 27, 2000. Harry’s heart clenches painfully in his chest. He can’t forget it—he tried. It’s the last Auror mission he’s been on, the one that was too much too soon. He’d been a Junior Auror, barely out of training, and he’d screamed himself hoarse at night when the images wouldn’t get out of his head. An open-and-shut case. A day later, the
Still trying to figure out who the first person is, Draco reads the magic of the Manor and counts five visitors. It could be worse. When Arctic conveys how much he believes Draco is being stupid, he decides to stop hiding. His friends — former friends? — will find him no matter what. He draws strength from Arctic, and from the memory of Harry’s arms around him, and steps out of the orangery. He spots the Slytherins, huddled together as curious tendrils poke at their feet. In the dim light, his overpowered eyesight makes itself useful.
Draco shrugged, trying hard not to blush with little success. His only consolation was that Potter was probably too thick to realise what had caused it.
“Think I’m up to something, Auror Potter?”
Once Harry wrote the permission, stating
only close friends and family, and I don’t want it to be a very big party. The baby shower is going to be a big enough event.”
“On my mood,” Draco said. He took the plastic pick out of his drink and stuck the olive between his teeth, sliding it off slowly and watching where Potter’s eyes went: directly to his mouth, as he’d hoped. Interestingly, he didn’t think Potter was aware of doing it, nor the way his pupils dilated. “For instance,” he added, “it
“Yes, and your cause of death will be diabetes. Can you stop eating for a second?” Hermione poked Ron in his waist, making him wince.
He could feel Potter’s cock swelling under his ministrations, reaching full hardness as Draco worked him over with mouth and hands, spit and come dripping down his chin and coating his cheeks. The filthy wet sounds made his belly clench, and the sounds Potter made were even better.
“No, why?” said Potter. “Did you lose it?”
, for Merlin’s sake! – and all of his friends were settling down and going on with their lives… And Harry. Fuck, Harry had been stuck in the same place for more years than he ought to have been.
“Hmm… It’s just… We’re running out of ingredients for the snacks and I really think we should have a Victrola up on the tea room… Can you give me some money so I can get those?”
Vindication tastes sweet on Draco’s tongue. This is actually kind of fun. His post-war, post-probation forays into self-discovery happened so long ago that Draco sometimes wonders if they were real. He almost forgot the elation of having all eyes on him, of letting go completely, of teasing and enticing. He’d felt wanted and beautiful and worth more than the tattoo on his forearm. The full moon always exacerbates his needs, however it’s the first time he doesn’t bury them under three layers of Occlumency shields. He knows Potter isn’t straight; it’s been sixteen years since he graced the front page of the
Pansy’s hair is cut so short it makes Draco stare in disbelief. She’s wearing dark lipstick and leather trousers, her white shirt untucked from her belt and her black bra visible. Her arms are covered in intricate tattoos; she’s so far from the Pureblood girl who wore a pink frilly dress for the Hogwarts Yule Ball that Draco has trouble believing what he’s seeing.
“I know exactly how you feel,” Draco said, touching his forehead to Harry’s. “I think that’s why… We get along so well… We’ve always been two sides of the same coin.”
“No problem! You wanna go now?”
Harry’s hand jerks violently, and he scrambles backwards so fast the little vines are forced to let go. His stomach twists and there’s a loud thump in his chest until he takes a deep breath and gathers his thoughts. Because Malfoy is not scary. Harry stares up at him with narrowed eyes.
Draco honed his skills in Herbology by her side for almost two years. The greenhouse was her domain and going in there soothes Draco’s frayed nerves. Father spent his time sulking in his smoking room and studying old books back then, when he wasn’t sleeping his days away to deal with the pain of Cruciatus exposure. Draco, on the other hand, liked to keep himself busy. Mother taught him advanced Herbology, and he dived deep into potion-making because no potion would alert the Ministry if it was borderline legal. He’s good enough to be a Potion Master, but since he’s officially dead and unofficially unable to leave his land, he’s not about to claim that title.
“For fuck’s sake, I’m not asking how it felt! I want to know what happened.” Harry raises his hands in surrender. “I’m sorry. You don’t need to answer.” The ferret makes the worst parts of Harry surge to the surface. He’s not used to this anymore.
! Draco, I’m… I’m so happy!” Harry said, touching Draco’s face with both hands and kissing him softly on the lips. Harry’s kiss tasted a bit like salt from his tears. “It’s just… I thought… I thought it would never happen to me. I thought I’d die alone, that I’d be the last of my family. And then… You came, and now we’re going to have a baby… It’s just… It’s just… I never thought I
Harry chuckled, rolling his eyes as Draco sat on his lap, both of them in bed. “You’re insatiable.”
to do so.”
Harry fell on top of Draco, scenting his hair with happiness blooming in his chest. Harry moved, laying on his back as Draco rested on his chest, so he wouldn’t be crushed.
Harry moved his hand, touching Draco’s hair and caressing his head slowly, in a soothing motion that made Draco’s eyes instantly hood with sleepiness.
Harry is gentle; he’s too scared to hurt him after what must have been a painful transformation. He asks if Draco is sure he wants this, and Draco sucks on his fingers and twirls his tongue around them in response. Then Draco’s mouth is on Harry’s throat, his hands down Harry’s trousers, and he gets down on his knees and makes Harry see stars. And Harry is inside Draco and Draco is making keening sounds between his exhales, and the expanse of his back is tantalising, the curve of his spine a work of art, the dimples above his arse entrancing. Harry watches himself dive into him and goes slow, but Draco is relaxed and enjoying every second of it, which means he’s played with himself enough to be used to the sensation, and Harry almost comes from the thought.
felt lewd in his head.
Harry opens his eyes after what seems like a very short nap. The bed he’s lying on has turquoise, translucent hangings and the sheets scream money. He’s comfortable, though when he looks to the right, there’s one of those frankly creepy trees swaying with each gust of wind. The windows rattle and all in all, it’s the beginning of a rotten day, but what else does he expect at this time of the year?
“So what have you been up to, Malfoy?” he asked when they had their drinks, Draco transferring the straw from his old one to the new one. Next to Potter, he felt both very small and very overdressed in his proper wizarding robes. He estimated that Potter’s forearm was roughly the same size as his own bicep, which he quickly tried to stop noticing when it made his cheeks burn.
“Are you offering?”
“So you’re luring him to your flat. Like a predator.”
His home. It’s still odd to think of Malfoy Manor as Harry’s house. He’s used to the indoor forest, the way the trees and roots obey the house-elves and can drag Harry out of bed by his ankle if he’s supposed to do something but chooses to nap instead. He befriended the invisible entity that always follows him when he’s outside; its eyes boring into his back are no longer a threat, but the careful watch of a protector.
“Yeah, but … but
He doesn’t sit yet. When an elf with wispy black hair appears and threatens to stick him to a chair, Harry laughs. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be rude; I’m waiting for Ma—for Draco.”
,” Pansy complained, wearing a look of distaste as she watched Potter, his teammates, his admirers, and, of course, Weasel and Granger. “Can’t you stalk him another night?”
He felt proud that Draco was marrying him. This had always been a marriage of convenience, but right now, it seemed to be much more.
“You are having other babies, right?” Ron asked as soon as he arrived with Hermione, way before the party started. Since she was responsible for the cake, they had to be there before everyone else.
“Depression is unkind, Harry, but you’re doing admirably.”
Sirius was already sixteen. He was tall and long, red hair wild as it fell over his forehead and ears, his intense grey eyes wide as he looked at Draco. He had his arms crossed, trying to look bigger as every young alpha would do when scared.
want to do that. It’s my baby we’re talking about here. Nott can do something else.”
Ron rears back and his smile vanishes. “Er, what?”
Malfoy sighs and rolls his eyes. “Can you pretend it never happened?” He seems torn when he examines the food and ends up picking a bowl of yoghurt. Harry imagines he might not feel well enough to dig into something new or fatty, even if his hand got dangerously close to the stuffed cheela (thank Merlin for preservation charms; Harry is dying to know what they’re stuffed with and he won’t mind if the elves serve him the same dishes again. Assuming he will be welcome to return).
“Thank you,” he heard Draco say at his side, looking up at him. “I was worried about her.”
“Who else—no, what’s the sanctuary for?” Why is Draco’s throat so scratchy?
it’s my first pregnancy and I want it all!” Draco crossed his legs, effectively pushing Harry’s hand away and looking mad at him.
to stop it? When Harry left, Draco didn’t have a meltdown on the scale of the previous one, but he was shaking and chose to hide in his bed, curled up under his soft blanket. He hugged himself and stared straight ahead, until he fell asleep. Socialising after such a lengthy isolation is exhausting.
They share another cup of tea in the orangery. Malfoy refuses to show his musical talent, threatens to put salt in Harry’s tea next time, and is overall much more energetic than yesterday, even with the full moon tomorrow. Harry is convinced he’s hiding his feelings behind his oddly cheery disposition. It’s
The dog perked up his head, looking at the door and standing up, his tail wagging happily as he ran down to meet Draco’s voice. With it, Harry heard other pairs of feet running down the stairs.
you could get out?”
Draco’s body arched away from the bed, and Harry couldn’t hold it anymore. He was too tight, too wet, too hot. His knot inflated within him, stretching Draco to his maximum, making him come once again as Harry filled him with hot come to the brim, his knot keeping every drop inside.
“Sacrificial magic
“None taken,” Harry actually chuckled at it, because it was the same thing he and Malfoy had discussed.
Harry presses his lips against Draco’s and whispers that he knows.
. He had the choice to keep his name if he wanted, but judging by the change of his middle name as well, Harry thought that Draco didn’t want the association that came with the name Malfoy.
“Whoa. Right,” he heard Potter say, shifting forward on his knees. Draco’s stomach swooped. “So I … er …”
“It’s a
Lily and James. No other name of any other existing friend of ours, okay? Dead or alive,” Draco conceded, and Harry smiled widely, kissing him on the lips.
“I would like you all to write the baby a message. A message for the future, one they can read and know they have been loved since before they were born into this world.”
“You didn’t say please, Potter.”
“Why do you ask?”
“Yes, you moron!” he shouted, beginning to sweat now at his temples. “I can’t fit your massive prick inside me yet!”
“He’s a tween, Draco. He’s going to get better with time. You know Ory is a good boy.”
Suppressing his triumph, Draco turned to face him with politely raised eyebrows, as if he couldn’t imagine who might be calling his name, or why. Peripherally he saw Pansy turn to see what had happened and then pinch her nose. Potter was hurrying over and picking the wallet up from the floor, wearing a big dumb grin as he handed it over.
the shock register on his face. When he met Draco’s eyes again there was something new there. A nascent understanding that was still forming, like a light being turned on a degree at a time.
He was much needier now, practically attached to Harry’s lap. Also, he napped
Their guide left, leaving them alone in the room. It looked a bit like a tea room, with comfortable settees and a small table in the middle with tea and biscuits waiting for them. It was all very traditional. Like they were meeting for the first time in one of their parents’ houses.
Harry isn’t sure how to answer, but he figures if he’s not bold enough, he might ruin it all. He’s not a Gryffindor for nothing, after all. He stands up and takes two steps to reach Malfoy’s chair. “Kiss me again and find out.”
“You like a lot of things that people would say you’re crazy to enjoy… Being ordered around, for example,” Harry said, carrying Draco to their bed and laying him down on the centre, kissing a line down his neck slowly.
Harry smiled, grabbing Draco on his arms and flipping them around, Draco straddling his body and Harry under him. The alpha moved him up, so Draco’s tits were right above his mouth. He held Draco’s arse with his large hands, and captured a nipple in his mouth, sucking slowly, as if drinking from him. He pressed the nipple with his tongue, circling and biting softly with his front teeth, then suckling again.
The first time Draco asked him for it, Harry thought it was harmless. Just a tea party with his friends to announce the pregnancy, nothing more. Harry had announced to Ron and Hermione over a pint of Guinness and fish and chips, but Draco? Oh, he wanted it to be perfect. He worked hard on cooking and preparing all the delicious snacks he would be offering. Harry suggested getting them a chef, but Draco refused. He wanted to do it, so Harry let him.
“I knew it! I fucking knew it!” Ron slapped the table, and Hermione looked like she was about to have a fit. Thankfully most kids were at Hogwarts, and those who weren’t were either too young to understand or at First School in the afternoon – learning tips and tricks to control their blooming magical power better.
, his cock dry but jerking with pleasure.
“I’m sure your numerous lovers appreciate it.” Draco doesn’t miss the gleam in Potter’s eyes, or the way his smirk grows. “I must say, I expected you to be married by now.” Is Draco fishing for information? Abso-fucking-lutely. Potter discussed his decade-and-a-half in Iran yesterday, but just like at school, he’s an expert at keeping things private while giving the impression that he’s an open book. All Draco learned is that Potter is indeed no longer an Auror and that he installed a hammock on the rooftop terrace of his house.
“Brian,” the omega corrected.
“You dropped this,” he said unnecessarily.
An arm snakes around Draco’s waist, putting a stop to his thoughts.
He didn’t know where to look, if to the wonder in his arms, or the wonder coming into the world.
“You’re so tiny… So tight… I think I won’t have any problem fucking you two times a day,” Harry said, and Draco rested his arms on his chest, looking down to his green eyes.
The first thing Draco does is try to place a tracing spell on the parchment. The wards covering the paper pop in his hand, but reveal nothing. Whoever sent this is powerful, which of course considering they’re an Auror, Draco shouldn’t be surprised. It does make him more determined to find an answer.
One room has an old mattress with a pile of dirty clothes in the corner. The other room is filled with paper, a cauldron, and potions ingredients. Finding nothing, Draco goes downstairs. The Muggle is gone and Potter is kneeling by the witch, binding her for transport.
He reaches the end of the wound. “All right. This one’s going to hurt a bit more. Try not to move.”
Draco crosses his arms across his chest. This is starting to be more than a coincidence. “Someone paid for my order?”
The only soap in the shower is the shampoo, so Harry spreads more of that on the washcloth, then kneels again between Draco’s feet. Harry rubs small, light circles over Draco’s skin, careful of the bruising around the injury. Draco shifts and opens his eyes, watching Harry with something in his gaze that burns through Harry like a storm. Harry feels like every inch of skin he cleans on Draco’s torso is unraveling his self control, pulling on threads Harry thought long tangled and out of sight.
Potter smiles that charming smile he has that Draco knows is mostly show. “Of course. Paperwork is of the utmost importance.”
Draco laughs, warm and gentle. “You look like I’m going to say no. Of course I’ll go on a date with you. I’m glad you finally asked.”
“Please sit down and be comfortable. Gatty will bring in some tea.” Gatty disappears into the house.
“You’re here late. Everything all right with the new case?” Potter asks.
“Where is this witch now?” Draco asks.
Draco huffs out a breath. “Of all the ways I imagined this, I never thought to have you kneeling in front of me in the shower and me with my mouth running.” Draco looks down at Harry’s undone trousers. “Looks like we both could use a bit of a wash now. Stand up and take off your trousers.”
“What kind of nice things?” Weasley asks.
“What do I owe you?” Draco reaches into his pocket.
Draco glares at all of them. “As I was saying. We solved the case. A group of wix opposed to your legislation have been kidnapping werewolves, some to sell out of the country and some they drug then let loose in populated areas to cause damage.”
Gatty’s face falls and his ears droop. “Margot left yesterday. Gatty tried to keep her, but she was scared. She did leave Gatty a way to contact her though.” Gatty slips a piece of paper across the low table to Draco.
“Leave off, Ron.” She reaches across the table and places a hand on his arm. “Is it so hard to believe that someone would do something nice for you?”
Harry winks at Draco, something warm and hopeful unfurling in his chest. “That doesn’t sound all that bad.” Harry reaches behind Draco and turns the water back on. “I meant what I said earlier. You deserve to be happy, Draco.”
Draco presses his thumb and finger into Harry’s chin and makes Harry lift his face. “None of that now.”
In the end, that’s what rips through Harry like fire, the way Draco says his name, part plea, part prayer, and Harry is only too happy to provide relief and answers. Harry braces both of his hands on Draco’s thighs and sucks down Draco’s cock until it bumps against the back of Harry’s throat. Draco hisses and threads a hand through Harry’s hair, yanking it as Harry pulls his head back, sucking in, before plunging back down.
Both ideas are ridiculous.
Draco pulls out the small bag of Milky Buttons and offers one to Potter. “Would you care for one?”
Potter’s green eyes blink slowly at him. “Well, don’t stay too late, Malfoy. You need your beauty sleep.”
Draco runs his fingers over the scars and presses into the one that is now open, letting the intensity of the pain ground him. Draco can still see Potter's face when he gave him these scars, still see the heat of the anger and hate on Potter’s face. Draco knows he deserves every one of these scars. They are a reminder of mistakes he’s made—mistakes that he should never be allowed to forget lest he make them again or start to think he deserves anything more than what his life holds. He’s thankful for the tentative friendship with Potter, for the occasional visits he spends with his mother, and for his empty, lonely flat.
Harry sags against him, a shy smile turning up the corners of his mouth. Harry closes the distance between them and places a light kiss on Draco’s mouth. “Draco.”
“Auror…” the healer looks at him expectantly.
“Hey,” Weasley protests.
Draco grabs Harry’s hand and Apparates them straight into his flat. He has a brief flare of fear he left something out or that his space would be untidy even though Draco knows everything is in the place it belongs. He tries to drop Harry’s hand to take a step and look around to make sure, but Harry squeezes his hand and pulls him closer.
Draco steps into the water and lets the heat of it wash away everything. He tries to empty his mind of all the dark thoughts and places both palms on the cool tiles of the shower. The pain in his side is still there, but the contact with the tile keeps him from shaking. Draco stands there, breathing evenly and wishing for things he’ll never have.
Against the wall, there’s someone tied on the floor, a Muggle by the look of her clothes. Standing with her back to them is a tall, lanky witch, clad in robes that have seen better days.
“Thank you, Aurors Potter and Malfoy. Please submit your paperwork in a timely manner,” the clerk reminds them.
Harry nods, unwilling to look away from Draco’s eyes. Harry knows what he wants, but he’s pushed those desires so far down, the hope that they might be something he could actually have, actually hold in the palm of his hand, makes Harry lightheaded.
“You know it’s illegal to practice magic on Muggles.” Potter is using his calm voice, the one he tempers to sound as unthreatening as possible, the kind of voice you use on crying children.
A wizard comes down the hall in the grey robes of prison transport. “This the prisoner?”
Potter's face falls and Draco wants to snatch his harsh words, but his day has been too terrible for him to spare anyone’s feelings but his own. The pettiness burns his throat and he swallows it down. He stalks back to his office, yanks at the buttons of his vest, and mutters as he unbuttons his shirt. The skin over the right side if his chest is an angry red.
Before they leave the house, Draco decides to ask a question that has been niggling at him. He turns to the house-elf. “Gatty, who pays for the upkeep of this house if you have no master?”
“No,” the word comes out harsher than Draco means it to. “I mean, I’m fine.”
There’s a queue, but it moves quickly and soon Draco is at the front. The person working the counter has short blue hair and an easy smile. Draco places his order and pulls out his muggle money, but the clerk waves their hand.
Potter steps out of the closet and Draco takes a breath before following him. The pain in his side is acute at this point and there is a pinching every time he draws in a breath. Draco refuses to crumble. He learned long ago that showing weakness brought nothing but more pain and sorrow, and he wants so much to not show failure to Potter. He’s worked too hard to get to where he is with Potter. He thinks they might be something like friends, and there are few people whose opinion Draco really cares about—he admits that Potter is one of them.
Ginny leads the way to the bar and smiles at Draco after they place their orders.
“The house-elf?” Draco can’t keep the slight sneer out of his voice.
Draco’s hand goes to his shoulder, his grip is firm, and the heat of his hand pushes Harry to the breaking point.
“See you then,” Draco nods.
Gatty rises to his full height. “Gatty receives some money from the Ministry and there are some donors. We get by.”
Draco snorts. His new assignment is about some disappearances - normally disappearances were right up Draco’s alley - but the missing persons were werewolves. Werewolves were still persona non grata in most circles, which is why Hermione is having some issues getting support for her bill that would grant werewolves protection and access to potions that help their condition. These kinds of cases still fall in his lap with exhausting frequency. The cases no one else wants or the ones that seem impossible to solve. Draco accepts them all, does his bloody job, and does it well.
Keeping the arm in place that’s holding them together, Draco uses his free hand to remove Potter’s glasses and cup the other man’s face. “Harry.”
Harry’s grin is full of promise. “What should we do until then?”
“We just came here to talk,” Draco adds even though he knows they’ll be taking her in for kidnapping. Better to keep things calm.
Harry snorts. “Mutual feelings? Draco, how can you make everything seem so boring?”
It’s more than he deserves. The inside of the house is bright, natural light from the windows bounce off light colored walls. Gatty leads them into the sitting room on the left and waves a hand at the chairs.
His secret admirer is an Auror.
Draco gets a washcloth from the small bathroom and wipes the worst of the mess he left on Harry, before waving his wand and getting the rest. He could have just spelled it all away, but he wanted to clean Harry himself.
Potter chuckles and the sound dances over Draco. “What and miss the opportunity to ruffle your feathers?” Potter laughs some more and Draco rolls his eyes at the other man, but of course he’s not really bothered. He adores Potter’s laugh.
Potter nods and pushes himself from the door. “I just need to grab my robe. I’ll meet you by the door.”
Draco watches Harry’s arse as he walks away from him. Harry doesn’t bother to put his pants back on and he throws a wink over his shoulder at Draco as he walks out of the room.
Potter rolls his eyes at Draco. “I have some other work to do. All right if I leave you here?”
Harry becomes impatient and thrusts up into Draco’s mouth, making Draco’s eyes water. The movement makes Draco harden even more until he is on the brink of… something. Draco wraps one hand around Harry’s hip bone and one hand around Harry’s cock and goes to work in earnest. He moves up and down, hollowing out his cheeks as he pulls up and applying pressure all the way up and down with his hand, slick with spit and precome. Draco pulls back until the head of Harry’s cock was almost out of his mouth before pressing back down Harry’s length.
Draco pinches the bridge of his nose, trying and failing to ignore how close to him Potter is standing. “As if this day could get any worse.”
Potter moves and stands beside Draco at the window. His Auror cloak brushes against Draco’s legs and, though it’s impossible, Draco feels warmth from the touch. He swallows.
Draco takes a step closer to Potter, unable to resist doing so, loving the way Potter’s blush deepens further. “What did you mean?”
Draco explains about the tea, the meat pie, and about his lunch being paid for. Ron looks intrigued, Potter is looking everywhere but at Draco, and Granger’s face is soft.
“I’m about out too, Gin.” Weasley shakes his glass at his sister. She sticks her tongue out at her brother, but Draco knows she’ll bring him back a pint of the brown ale he prefers.
Harry kisses him this time, and soon enough Harry is straddling Draco and their tea is cold by the time they leave the bed again.
Harry whispers the spell, waving his wand down the length of the wound. Draco’s fingers tighten on Harry’s hand, but the other man holds still. Sweat, both from the heat of the enclosed room and from being this close to something Harry has only imagined, breaks out over Harry’s forehead.
Draco is sitting on the bench to the right of the water’s spray, naked and gleaming, so much better than anything Harry could have imagined, but Malfoy’s posture is wrong.  There are long jagged scars that run in white lines over Malfoy’s torso, scars that Harry knows he caused all those years ago. The sight of them makes Harry sick. Malfoy is pale and gasping on the bench, a red line runs down the length of one of the larger ropey scars on his side. Malfoy makes a small sound of distress.
“Where did you get these?” The other man asks, green eyes flicking to him, then back to the building across the street.
Harry slides Draco's vest off and then walks away, folding the garment, before laying it on the lounge chair in the corner of Draco’s room. Harry starts in on the buttons of Draco’s shirt and Draco comes to life, putting his fingers under Harry’s suspenders and pushing them off Harry’s shoulders. Draco allows himself to run his palms over Harry’s shoulders, pressing his thumbs along Harry’s clavicles as he does so. Harry leans into the touch and Draco can’t help but close the space between them so he can rub his aching cock into Harry’s.
Harry tried hard not to push Draco down. He was happy and he was smiling all the time. He was having a lot of fun with his friends and doing something innocent enough, but not only were Harry’s funds were being depleted much too fast, but his mental state was also declining. He was becoming more and more irritated, and he was really trying not to just order Draco to stop.
The only thing Harry wanted was a family, people that would be around him for all of his years, family that would complete his life in the most fundamental way. Harry wanted an omega, children, a dog, the picket fence. He wanted everything, and yet… Yet his relationships ended because they didn’t really match, or when he tried to meet someone new, they were so in love with the novelty of meeting Harry Potter that he completely lost interest.
“Yes,
“Guess… That’s a good way of getting to know each other better,” Draco said, out of breath, and Harry laughed, his cock still jerking inside Draco while his knot forced him to be hard. “Your knot is so good… You have no idea… I’m stuffed.”
Draco supplies potions to the sanctuary; his muscle relaxant is very much appreciated. He also wrote and published his method to accept the wolf and make the experience less traumatising. He doesn’t say it, but Harry knows he’s proud to have helped so much. He changed the lives of everyone under Theo Nott’s protection.
“Never mind Harry going to marry
“I mean, he has to be somewhere, right? I know you couldn’t tell me anything about work after I left, but I thought he was dead.”
“Just go,” he snaps.
“I was, too,” Harry admitted, his hand holding Draco’s. “Can you believe it? We’re married. And I’ve seen you only for a week after…”
At that moment, Harry
“Go ahead. I’m listening,” Harry said, nuzzling Draco’s hair, his hand moving and cupping his whole small breast in his hand, kneading the soft flesh between his fingers.
“Not here what?”
“What is it?” Draco asks.
He showed up with a whole toolbox. Draco briefly entertained the idea of deliberately doing something to his bed frame so as not to look like he’d been lying but decided in the end he didn’t care enough.
It took Pansy a second, and when it finally clicked she scoffed loudly.
“Hmm… So… Yeah, I wanted to show off to Pansy… So the ball idea was really because I wanted to shut her mouth,” Draco admitted, and Harry nodded.
Malfoy has yet to look him in the eye as they each take a sip, but he’s still the first to open his mouth. “You know, when I heard a voice, I thought it was a fever dream. Because after so long, I’d given up on anyone ever realising the difference between a manor signalling the end of a line, and sacrificial magic.” Malfoy smirks. “So, who figured it out? Granger?”
Harry snorted so hard his nose hurt, and they both fell on a fit of giggles that suddenly turned into howling laughter, and none of them could stop.
But Harry needed him. This omega was the perfect chance of having the family that he wanted.
of money in your funds. It’s more than enough to buy everything we need for the baby, and of course I’m going to buy some things as well.”
Instead of going home, he finds himself knocking at Luna’s door in Devon.
“We’ll talk about the gender reveal party in the future,” Draco said, and left his office almost running.
By the end of it, Harry was out of breath. This omega was perfect. He looked up the information about the omega, and it said he was a male. He wouldn’t have as large breasts as a female, and of course, there was the addition of a cock, but Harry was as much into males like he was with females. Maybe he was a male with larger breasts, who knew? Some omegas had them, and Harry was definitely a boobs guy. He’ll love a perky tiny omega too, though, as long as he could play with him to his heart’s content.
The memory brings a smile to his face. He gathers enough Dittany to replenish his stock of muscle relaxant, which he always needs after a transformation, and he spends some time checking on his Mandrakes. One of them has become friends with a specially crafted subspecies of Aconite and their leaves are entangled. He doesn’t touch them. The Aconite wouldn’t poison him—the Manor protects him from almost everything that is a hazard to Lycanthropes, even silver (in small doses)—but this particular plant has a mind of its own and it bites. Arctic finds it highly intriguing. Mother created it through the unholy union of a Fanged Geranium and Wolfsbane during her house-arrest.
“Don’t start!”
“Not as handsome as you,” Harry retorted, and Teddy smiled, a smile that was all Tonks, and shook his head.
“Well, then, since you gave me permission… I want our omega boy to be Scorpius Hyperion, as you already know, and our alpha boy could be… Sirius James. It does have a nice ring to it.”
Sighing, Draco reached for his wand on the floor and did it himself, coating Potter’s hand.
Malfoy now looks more alert; there’s an unsettling gleam in his grey eyes and Harry shifts on his seat. “You didn’t mind,” Malfoy repeats, enunciating each syllable in a Snape-like manner. He’s blushing. It’s amazing.
Surprisingly, they hadn’t argued, not even once. Granted, they didn’t talk about hard topics like the war or blood purity, but Harry was happy to see that their personalities didn’t crash as much as he had imagined they would. Draco was funny, witty, and it was true what he said in the letter: he
Hermione lowers the volume of her phone, and they’re soon surrounded by their friends, who are all staring at Draco as if they’ve never seen him before, but they have, they’re invited to the Manor several times a year.
Harry closes the Map with a sigh and drinks a sip of tea. His breath is still visible in the air, the ominous clanking of the ancient heating system struggling to raise the temperature after years of disuse. Harry cradles his cup with both hands, elbows resting on the dusty table, and contemplates his current situation. He’s itching to leave it all behind again, wondering why he came back, what was wrong with his house on the outskirts of the Iranian city of Ahvaz—but he knows he had to, when his magic sung so late into the night, an endless cry begging him to come home. He spent so long looking for traces of his family, only to learn there wasn’t anyone left, not even a distant cousin who could teach him about his history. After years of fruitless search, he couldn’t bear to stay. He left the calls to prayer, the saffron-flavoured pistachios, the clandestine distilleries in his friends’ basement, his rooftop terrace and the burning heat of the sun behind, and took a Portkey to London.
.” She pressed a hand to her chest, as if to emphasise where she was feeling the pain.
. The only thing that could possibly ruin it would be his omega being a Harry Potter fan, and if that was then it was going to break Harry’s heart. Although perfect for his preferences, this omega might not fit in his other criteria, and Harry really didn’t want someone who’d only want him because of his fame.
The Marauder’s Map, wide open on the kitchen table, displays many names Harry has never heard of, and three more he follows with a soft smile on his face. Neville, pacing in Greenhouse 4, surrounded by his students; Teddy, sitting still in his NEWT Potions class, lucky enough to learn from a teacher who doesn’t attempt to poison his pet to prove a point; Bill, alone in his office, likely busy correcting Defence essays he’ll complain about to Fleur later tonight. The creased parchment sends a pang of nostalgia straight to Harry’s heart, like it always does, bringing back memories of a past long gone. Finding the best secret passages; avoiding Filch and Snape and Umbridge—wondering, every night, what Malfoy’s lonely name meant, what he was up to, lurking so late in the darkened hallways, or hiding in Myrtle’s bathroom.
“But Haaaaaarry, it would be so nice to discover if our baby is a boy or a girl at the party…!” Draco’s pout got even bigger, and Harry sighed.
“Nope. You, on the other hand—”
It’s been four years. The Manor grounds no longer seem half-dead. The blackened trees are burgeoning again, thanks to Neville’s uncanny talent with plants, and the water of the pond is pure and clear, kept this way by a complex spell Pansy uses to avoid cleaning her pool. Draco and Harry have taken to swimming in the summer, and Harry often finds him taking a midnight dip when Draco can’t sleep. It’s an enchanting sight; Draco is getting more beautiful every day and still carries his halo of Faerie orbs; he keeps catching Harry staring at him, and he’ll give him a wicked grin and drag him close.
, and Harry knows full well that
He looked even more shocked by this revelation than Draco had expected, which turned him on far more than it probably should have.
. He finally asks about the Wolfsbane Potion, wondering if his host realises it’s a slow poison, and a muscle twitches visibly along Malfoy’s clenched jaw. Soon Harry is submerged in magical theory and Green Folk magic and all the reasons why Malfoy can’t leave, and when Malfoy snaps and calls him a brainless gnome, Harry is overcome by hysterical laughter. He puts his cup back on the table or he’ll drop it. Through tears of mirth, he catches a glimpse of Malfoy’s hesitant smile, and his stomach twists.
It was very obvious now, and there was no way they’d confuse it with a cake belly. Harry came closer, touching his belly and kissing his neck, inhaling the sweet scent of his skin. He always smelled so good.
Harry didn’t know what to say, so he just waited, in silence, as Draco touched his face, tracing his features as he continued.
“But Harry…”
Potter brightened, but — as Draco had expected — he seemed to take the sentiment at face value, gleaning no other intentions than the ones explicitly expressed. He waved down the barkeep and ordered a firewhisky for himself as well as another cosmo for Draco. He was, Draco noted, very confident in his movements, sure of himself in a way that seemed to come not only from being dumber than a bag of bezoars, but an innate aplomb that suited him extremely well.
“Thank you, alpha! I promise you won’t regret your decision. You’re going to love the parties!” Draco clapped, dimples forming in his cheeks with his huge smile. “We need to pick someone to receive the answer of the gender, so they can do the revelation…”
Harry’s left eye twitches. “Do I even want to ask what you’re cooking?”
“I was practicing the piano, father,” Scorpius said, his music sheets still in his hands. All of their Hogwarts aged kids were home since it was July, and they usually took the opportunity to enjoy their hobbies as they couldn’t do much of that at school.
Draco wakes feeling refreshed, an odd contrast with his post-full moon exhaustion. It’s pitch black outside, but the Manor lit the candles in his room; that certainly explains it. He reaches for his wand and casts

announced Draco’s extraordinary survival before Draco was ready, but Harry had nothing to do with it, the tapestry betrayed him again. Or, to be exact, Andromeda visited Grimmauld Place to check if she’d like to move in (she didn’t), and the next time she saw Harry in Diagon Alley, she asked, frostily, why he hadn’t bothered telling her about her nephew. Draco made headlines the next day.
Harry cackled, his head actually throwing back as he tried to avoid his laughter to no success. He dried his eyes of the laughter tears, looking at Malfoy dead in his grey eyes.
“Merlin’s fucking … just
“Yeah,” Draco croaked. “That’s really good. Keep doing that.”
He’s leaning against one of the columns/trees, arms crossed, hips tilted, dressed in a flowing grey robe clinched at the waist. He’s drumming his fingers against his bicep, then shakes his head to dislodge a strand of blond hair that falls into his eyes. He’s no longer wearing it to his shoulders. It’s shorter on the side, longer on top, gracefully framing the upper right side of his face, and Harry’s immediately annoyed because fuck, Malfoy looks
She gave Draco a look of such open exasperation only someone as clueless as Potter wouldn’t have picked up on its meaning.
And thus, the

“You’re really beautiful,” he said. It should have sounded cheesy and ridiculous but Potter was too painfully sincere, sounded truly awed by the sentiment, and Draco could not stop the sudden rush of emotion he felt. He said nothing, only stared down at his sheets until it passed, and then cleared his throat.
“Yes, uncle Harry. I think gran-gran wanted to invite her anyways, she is just gathering her courage. But-“ he stopped, squaring his shoulders, moving his hair in a flair, turning it into platinum blond. “I think I’m about to do it now!”
The yoghurt is sad on its own; Harry hands Malfoy a jar of liquid honey, and his fingers brush against Malfoy’s hand. He keeps them there a second too long. “I won’t talk about it if you don’t want to,” he says again, and withdraws his fingers.
“We’re
long time. Harry’s fine with anything Draco throws at him at this point. A second passes, and Draco Apparates them upstairs. Harry sees that a weeping willow swallowed Draco’s bed, but he doesn’t notice anything else because Draco’s lips are on Harry’s again, and hands are pulling at Harry’s clothes.
It’s hot and messy and brilliant, and Draco rips the fabric of his bedsheets after Harry makes him come.
Harry hangs his head in resignation. “Please don’t tell anyone.”
“I think it was partially because I wanted to prove that I was still the same person she’d known before. And it’s stupid because… I’m not. I’m not the same Draco as I was before. I haven’t been for a long time now,” he sighed, holding Harry by his shoulders. “But I really want to have the gender reveal party and the baby shower. I was being honest when I said I want it all. But the ball… Well, it was mostly because I wanted to prove I was happy and loved. You’re never at the tea parties so they ask about you…”
It had been an alarm about a chain reaction of dark spells. Harry flushes and doesn’t answer; he
Draco takes it all in and scoffs. “If anyone asks what we did for your thirty-ninth birthday, will you tell them we partied like teenagers?”
“I just feel bad it took us twenty-five years to notice,” Harry chuckled, and Draco shook his head.
The pub was called the Red Lion, which was obviously irksome. Probably the owner had been a Gryffindor. Probably that was why Potter liked it, too. Draco wouldn’t know — he spent his time ogling the great oaf, not speaking to him. He often came after evening Quidditch practises, something Draco inferred based on the fact that he could frequently be seen in tight-fitting T-shirts with the legend
I see Draco?”
“Let’s just go somewhere
“I am. Next week, on Saturday. The company has already arranged the paperwork, and we’ve decided to have a private ceremony with just our families in it. It’s not going to be a very big deal,” Harry shrugged, and Ginny nodded her approval.
He moves his arms in a complex pattern, twisting his hands so both palms face the sky. He’s announcing intent, and he knows it works, because the magic of the land responds in the same way his familial burial ground in Ahvaz did. It licks at him, tasting, searching for deceit, and finds none. Harry isn’t surprised when the gate opens, because it’s the Manor itself that sealed its doors shut. But if Malfoy is alive, the Aurors got that part wrong.
“Have I dropped my wallet again or something?”
Harry snorts and shakes his head. “You can both come and save me from the Manor when it tries to eat me, then.”
“But they’re so prickly, anything I say is taken the wrong way.” Harry’s aware that he’s whining, and he doesn’t care.
Draco whimpered, his body lit with the mere imagination of it. He looked at Harry in the dark, and touched the alpha’s hair.
He scratches the back of his head and stares at his feet. “It’s stupid.” And he explains it all.
“You too, Potter,” Draco instructed, grinning at the way Potter’s eyes widened. “You’re gonna fuck me.”
broken. But what if it isn’t?
Draco asks the wolf, and he gets a sense of amusement in return. When he looks again, the tremors in his hands are gone.
Huh, maybe that’s why the Manor isn’t opening its doors.
“I thought you wanted to pretend it didn’t happen.”
Harry took too long to answer, and Ron groaned.
There’s people milling about, carrying colourful cocktails and appetisers to the table. Hermione’s fancy magic-compatible smartphone is hooked to powerful speakers and is currently blasting
Draco rolled his eyes. “I was only trying to get you here, wasn’t I?”
What a fascinating development. He resolves to test his theory, but first, he needs to check on his muscle relaxant. It’s been left in stasis, but time is of the essence.
There’s very little light, so Harry Conjures a floating orb. “Hello?” he calls, wishing for a wand to hold on to. He needs something to keep his hands busy. “Anyone home? I’m not here to cause any trouble.”
…” Draco moaned, and Harry held his cock, although not entirely soft, out of him. His come flooded out, dripping out of Draco’s cunt and painting them both white. Draco trembled over him, and with a harder pull on his nipple, Draco came yet
“Why can’t it be Pansy?”
I remember?” he scoffs, as if the notion is ridiculous.
a bit of an exaggeration but Harry felt shocked with how expensive the things Draco was asking for were.
It’s more intense today; if it could talk, Harry thinks it’d give them a curfew and tell them not to accept candy from strangers. Tipsy already did that and even attempted to stick a Tracking Charm on their clothes, the little devil. The obsidian gate is open and Draco is gripping Harry’s hand. Harry feels the smooth surface of his wedding ring and grins, before giving Draco a quick kiss. Draco glares at his hair.
Shifting in his armchair, Theo snickers. “You and the Saviour. Delightful.”
Draco rolled his eyes, showing his hand where their marriage band rested.
“Hi Luna, I’m sorry I didn’t visit yesterday.” he says through a mouthful of blond hair, squeezing back. There’s a tightness in his chest and when he tries to breathe through it, it brings it up to his throat and makes his eyes sting. When Luna lets go, she eyes him in concern.
“Yes. But first, tell me something… Were you just planning the parties because Pansy said you had sold yourself? Or did you actually like them?”
Harry was fast to schedule a meeting. He wanted this omega, and he wanted him
With a frown, Harry comes to a sudden realisation. Born June 5, 1980. No other date appears. That’s impossible. He saw him—every Auror who was there did. His mangled body is burnt into Harry’s mind, and their detection spells didn’t pick up any life sign.
there – and he could do nothing but comply. Draco’s small body was perfect to what he was asking, his head resting over Harry’s shoulder as the alpha watched his thick cock going in and out Draco’s tight cunt, stretching it out.
“I love being free of control, Harry. Being free not to worry, being free not to make decisions. I’m the freest because I know
“Can you believe we were basically strangers eight months ago?” Draco wondered, smiling as Harry kept kissing his neck, the alpha’s large hand warm over his belly.
“Can you… Tell me examples?” Draco’s eyes were drooping, but he tried to listen. He was really curious.
The Boy-Who-Lived. The bane of his early teenage years. A skinny Gryffindor idiot with hauntingly beautiful eyes, a crooked smirk and such a noble heart that it should be disgusting, but it’s thanks to Potter’s fundamental
It takes five minutes to walk from the obsidian gate to the door. Draco bites his nails and taps his foot, an eye on the grandfather clock, ears attuned to the birds chirping outside. He has no idea who chose to visit, or if they have good intentions. The Manor will protect him, but he wishes Harry was here, though he won’t admit it.
They weren’t having any vows or marriage ceremony. They’d sign a document, the wizard responsible would perform the wedding bond, and they’d have a small party with their two families. They weren’t in love, after all, and they weren’t even talking much other than wedding prep.
His omega practically howled in pleasure, riding Harry’s fingers and pressing his breast once again inside Harry’s mouth. Harry couldn’t have enough of that, his own eyes hooded as he sucked, licked and bit, his fingers soaking wet as they fucked his omega’s cunt.
“It was a comment Pansy said.”
“You’re hard, you know,” he said. He looked up at Potter and lifted an eyebrow.
to unlock Harry’s door. With one last glance down the hallway, he reaches out for the doorknob. A spike of nerves runs up his spine, but he forces it down. He wonders if Harry’s set a ward on his room, but when nothing happens, Draco turns the knob and slips inside.
He shimmies his hips, pulls his trousers down, and lets his knees fall further apart. His cock plumps up even more, straining against the thin material of the silken knickers.
The look of discomfort on Harry’s face is almost like he was hexed. Harry sways and closes his eyes as he falls back on the pillows.
“Besides, I’m still hoping you’ll show me your collection of fancy knickers.” Harry places a kiss between Draco’s shoulder blades.
“Not yet,” Harry says. “I want to feel you come with me inside you. Want to feel you shaking apart,” he says.
“I’m not the one wanking in someone else’s bed.” Harry's voice is thick.
“A little more. That’s all I need. Fuck, you cruel bastard.” He tugs at Harry’s hair in desperation, but Harry just laughs deep and throaty against Draco’s arse and keeps licking.
He turns back to the bed, and Draco feels even more exposed with his crumpled shirt pushed out of the way, and lacy knickers starkly white against the red of Harry’s sheets.
It all happens so fast that Draco’s alcohol-addled brain can’t keep up, but somehow he ends up with his arms pinned over his head with The Savior of the Wizarding World braced above him. Apparently Harry’s decided that if Draco won’t listen to reason, then he’ll physically make him.
When Draco’s eyes land on Harry again, he realizes that somewhere along the line Potter has become
Draco frowns. Because no matter how far he’s come since he found himself on the wrong side in the war, he knows that this is the
Draco shifts his hips. The change in angle ensures that Harry’s cock presses against his prostate with every thrust of his hips.
“There’s hardly any risk,” Blaise says.
“S’that what you want?” Harry asks, biting at Draco’s bottom lip.
Harry gestures at his four-poster bed again. “What are
“If you don’t mind, I’ll ask you to please leave me to it. I dare say I’ve got matters in hand here.” He wraps his fist around his cock and lets his knees fall wide apart again as he strokes himself.
Draco hooks one leg over Harry’s hip, guiding him down until their hips align. With their bodies pressed flush and Harry’s fierce gaze focused on Draco, the world seems to stop spinning.
Finally, Draco manages to escape Robards’ firm handshake. He wishes his boss a Happy Christmas, and with one last glance to make sure Harry is still where he’s supposed to be, Draco slips out of the room and makes his way to the training dorms.
in Draco’s mind — even if he’s never allowed himself to utter the name aloud.
Having Draco’s naked, willing body against him was heaven, and Harry held him by his waist, pulling him up to his arms and then supporting him holding his arse.
“No, not at all,” Potter assured him, practically bouncing with enthusiasm. “I love that kinda thing, I’m pretty good with my hands. I even have a tool kit, I could run home and grab it!”
family. Adopted or not, blood or not. It’s been good twenty years since blood had stopped mattering for a few of us here,” Draco continued, with some sort of pain in his eyes. “I love that our child is going to be born in a world where they won’t have to go through what
“Is it? How fascinating.”
Harry nods quickly, eager to escape her wrath. He inches closer to the group who is still losing their collective minds about Draco’s presence. “Yes?” he dares, and it’s only luck if Luna hears him and intervenes.

having a ball,” Harry growled, and Draco looked at him with wide eyes, surprised by Harry’s outburst.
“Mind your business,” Draco snapped. “He
“Fortunately, wizards live long lives.”
“I really don’t think it’s a cake bump,” Draco said, looking at himself in the mirror. His breasts were larger, nipples darker with the pregnancy. Harry lived in a constant state of being hard nowadays. “I do think it’s the baby.”
