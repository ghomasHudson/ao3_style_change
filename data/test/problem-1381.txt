The women took out a rag and began wiping the counter down, "As far as I know, not much. There is a performance of some sort down at La Crows tonight. But besides that I believe it will be a quiet weekend on the island."
Draco laid back looking up towards the cloudy sky. "Did you know your parents? Sometimes, not often but on occasion, I would wish I had different ones. Especially during- well,
Draco sat back down, closer to the panther this time. He watched the cat as he stared into the water sulkily. "Do you miss home?" Draco asked. "I know I miss mine. My old home, mind. It was a large Manor, we called it the Malfoy Manor." Léon twitched. "It was beautiful. You would have loved the forest we had surrounding it. Oaks so tall and large you felt like you could touch the sky in them. I used to climb them any chance I could. My farther didn't like it, though. Said that a proper heir didn't spend time in trees, he spent his time learning. Learning magick, learning the trades of the family business, learning how to cheat your way into and out of any situation."
Draco pushed his parchment away, standing up from the bed, "You don't know what you are saying, Harry. You don't understand what you are signing up for. I'm a freak. I'm dangerous. I'm a dangerous fucking freak, Potter."
Harry smiled at Draco as he stumbled over his words, "No we aren't. I mean.. when we first met I thought maybe but then last night happened and now I'm almost positive he never wants to see me again."
He glanced up at the vines in his clutch. Time seemed to slow as the last of vines split away from each other, Draco felt all his breath leave him, and his mind instantly sending him to the worst of his nightmares.
Draco slowly placed the water by the food dish and lowered his wand. "Good morning." He said brightly.
He repeated the incantation three times before the door slowly fell off it's hinges. Thomas and George grabbed the door quickly and without a second thought, Draco slipped in-between the door and the wall.
Draco finally moved his eyes away and looked towards the crowd. He began speaking his thank yous and how amazing it is to perform for them. With every other word he couldn't help glancing at the Boy Who Lived Twice.
When Potter just stood, making no other movements besides his swaying, Draco started to feel a little worried, "Hey, Potter, are you alright?"
Liceat mihi, aliud quo nemo intrare possit, liceat mihi ad centrum : Allow me where no one else can enter, allow me to the center
"Why not? I have heard of it happening, people denying their mate!" Instantly, he knew the voice was Malfoy and the female voice was Fleur.
He turned around and trudge back up to the castle, anxious to get the next set of classes over with.
Harry pulled the bagel close to him, "Yes, civil, not friendly.. unless you aren't being friendly.. did you poison this bagel?"
Draco rolled his eyes as he stopped at his dressing room. He accidentally misses one show a year and a half ago and his manager
, or the Pro-Igni for short. The word i believe means ‘firestorm’. Not really sure why it’s named after fire seeing as it’s green but I guess only the maker knows. It is said that this island was once created by way of fire and deep ocean colliding together. Legend has it that one day a great fire will once again rise and take Hunulaya. Only one of great power will be able to save the island."
Little did they know, a few streets over, sat almost every member of the founding families, mapping out what exactly tomorrow night will bring.
"Complete holding?" Draco asked as he followed the man towards the door at the end of the cages. "He is powerful?"
Luckily - or unluckily, Draco couldn't tell, there was no meetings nor scheduled events to go on today, so Draco spent the morning in the Enchanted Rainforest, attempting and failing to talk to the most stubborn cat Draco has ever met.
Harry began walking to the cafe when he suddenly felt a wave of small shocks down his arms and back. He looked behind him, recognizing the sensations immediately, his eyes searched for Malfoy, but couldn't see him anywhere. Curious, he turned away from the cafe and began walking deeper into the library.
His assistant's lips quirked up even higher, "Down the way.. he has a bit of a temper. They had to put him in complete holding."
was doing things to Harry that he has never felt with any other girl or boy. The feeling was become addicting.
the damn git so much it physically hurt. Today, Saturday, Draco was out the room before any of the other boys were even up, as usual. Harry isn't sure how considering he has been up since nearly five in the morning, from another nightmare. It was his fifth one this week alone. After hours of sitting in the library and going over multiple different theories and coming up with nothing solid about the Malfoy situation, he finally broke and asked Hermione for help.
Draco leaned in a little closer, close enough that he could smell the mint from Potter's tooth paste, "Alright, you're on."
The panther's right ear twitched at the words while the rest of him laid still watching Draco intensely with his dark green eyes.
He sighed softly, looking down at the sleeping boy laying on his chest. Draco turned the boy softly away, not without pausing when Harry made the most pitiful sound that had Draco's mind go fuzzy. In that moment he wanted to call and cancel his performance. It wasn't pre-scheduled so he knew his manager wouldn't know if he canceled it, but he felt a rush of guilt at the thought.
Malfoy turned towards Harry, gazing at him with a look Harry has never seen him wear before. If he had is glasses on and could see the look more clearly, he believe the gaze would be almost
Rolling his eyes, Draco replied, "Oh don't get you're knickers in twist, Granger. He gives as good as he gets. Plus, I think he enjoys our little spats. Keeps him entertained."
The other issues of this case - the investigation of where he came from and what he really is mainly; where at a complete standstill. The past month and few weeks, he has looked over every possible book he could get his hands on about rare creatures and magical beings but all for nothing. Every book he came across in both the local library and the few left over books that he was able to save from the Manor held nothing of importance. It was as if this creature was a brand new creature to this world. If the creature even
" sign on it. On the right of the entrance was where the little cafe was. Witches and Wizards alike sat with various to-go cups and books laying about their tables.
Draco turned towards his door, confused. As the broken words continued, Draco treaded closer to the door, allowing the words to filter in and out of his mind more smoothly.
George clenched his jaw, "Yes, actually. The two boys in question of performing the ritual stopped by. One of them had said something very interesting."
Harry's eyes widened as he realized he was still half on the man. He scrambled away mumbling a quick sorry.
Harry stared up at the boy, who was determinedly looking Harry in the eyes. Before Harry could stop his tongue, a soft "
Hermione began to speak as they made their way out the hall, "I think I know who that little girl is that Malfoy talks to."
Luckily, Ginny and Luna chose that moment to come over to them, so no one but Draco saw how red Harry's cheeks had gotten.
Draco paused for a moment. Clearly, this animal is powerful, extremely so, but besides the occasional growl he has shown no signs of aggression or any want to injure or kill. He could probably talk the cat into letting them go, or if not talk try and get into the feline's mind again to put him asleep, if he was able to get in that is. He could also try and take them by way of force but there were many, many reasons why that was a bad idea. Main reason being that Draco believed these show of powers were only a small portion of what the cat could do and Draco really didn't want to see more shows without a little bit of backup.
"Look, there are some seats right in the front, come on." Hampton lightly grabbed his hand and pulled Harry through the crowd before Harry could even say a quick no.
Draco glanced around the cage, finding only a dark, empty room surrounding it. He looked back at the boy, forcing his face into a soft, kind look to hide the fear and disgust he felt. "No, I'm not here to hurt you." He slowly knelt down, noting the subtle flinch the boy gave. "My name is Draco, would you mind telling me yours?"
That's why, as he stood in the misty opened floor found in the forefront of the densely packed rain forest-charmed room, he felt true peace washing over himself where most people would only feel fear. Laying in front of him was the large black cat he had rescued only a few hours prior, voided of all restraints except the magical binder. Many people, including the other trainers, call him crazy for never fully binding or chaining up his charges when he has his first interacts with them, but Draco feels it allows the animal to realize that Draco isn't a threat and allows them to not feel trapped, even if they are stuck in a charmed room.
Harry tried very hard to not look at the soft, pale skin that showed as his shirt went up. He was failing miserably.
Léon let out a soft mournful yowl, placing his nose on Draco's forehead. Draco had to close his eyes and take a deep breath as not only the intense emotions he had just had to go through crashed into him, but also the soothing magic that was washing over him soothed his aches.
Instead of standing like all the others, Draco leaned further into Harry. "Let's stay for just a minute longer." He whispered.
, he thought. No other animal he has ever treated has had a wall built up like this one has. Even the Animagus have trouble with
The chatter around the hall intensified as more and more students arrived. The table Harry and Hermione sat at, Gryffindor's table, was the most packed table of them all, seeing as most students who couldn't attend or finish their last year had decided to finish up their schooling.
Kyle looked at the floor and then back up at Draco, "I just wanted to tell you that you sounded amazing tonight."
Harry shook his head, "No, I am not trying to trick you. You seem to want to be friendly so I just thought maybe we can do
you learn to live without. I can only do some healing charms, and a few household charms. I once was able to conjure a tiny fire, but I was in a state of rage that no person should ever be in."
A year and three months after the war, things were beginning to fall into place. The Golden Trio - one Hermione Granger, one Ronald Weasley, and one Harry Potter - were walking peacefully through Diagon Alley when they bumped into none other than their old professor and head of their house, Professor McGonagall.
Slughorn turned, both eyebrows raised, "If you want all of your marks you best drink the potion. I know you are not allergic to any of the ingredients, we have used them all before."
Harry spun so quickly his neck began to throb. He and the boy have had a small truce since rooming together and have had a few small not-exactly-conversations over the first week of school, but they have never, not once, actually hung out, nor held an
Over the course of the two hour class, Malfoy had slowly regained what little color he had in his skin, but as soon as Harry placed the cup in front of him, he turned white as a ghost once again and backed away from the cup like it might explode on him.
Harry tried to hide his embarrassment to Ron's statement with a cough. "Yeah," He pulled his legs into criss-cross position, "But Pansy's right, his swing could really use some work."
Malfoy left out a heartless laugh, "Snape.. He took an oath. Took an Unbreakable Oath to protect me. To finish out my mission if I failed. That's why he did it. To protect me. Not only that but to protect his stance with the Dark Lord. He knew if the Oath was broken, your side would have no way of knowing what was happening on theirs."
Malfoy laughed back, "One of my favorite house-elves growing up, Dippy, had told me that when I was going through the trails last year. She was always a strange but wise little thing."
As someone attempted to push through the door, Draco was pushed towards Harry, nearly falling over but balancing them both at the last moment. Standing up their eyes met sharply, Harry opened his mouth but abruptly closed as the person coming out the bar exited.
As Draco levitated a bowl of water towards the cat, the large green eyes of the panther flew open and stared straight at Draco without even lifting his head.
Those eyes, those brilliant green eyes that were slowly getting brighter as he looked up at Draco constantly taking Draco's breath away. The contrast from the darkness of his skin and fur to the brightness of the green was simply breath taking. This panther was truly astonishingly beautiful. Draco ran his hand down the cat's head twice before slowly removing it from his knee and standing up.
Draco sat up, "Whether it was him or not, we now know officially that there is a reason we are here. I have this sick feelingly that we aren't going to like the reason."
He stepped closer to the two unconscious bodies, while keeping an eye on the panther. The cat jumped up onto a large boulder off to the side, sitting down roughly, tail whipping in irritation.
With soft goodnights, both boys floated to their rooms, high off of the days adventures and excited for what tomorrow will bring.
Draco sat quietly observing the magnificent creature before him. He has had history with many types of creatures, has helped and rehabilitated all sorts of magical and non-magical creatures alike, but besides only one instant of an Animagus, who was stuck mid-transformation of his lynx form when Draco first arrived at
Draco nodded slowly, leaning forward, "Yes, as you have told me, but who was the source? Why did they give the people the tree?"
Draco went to step in front of Harry, but Harry quickly pulled him back, curious on what Ham wanted, "It's okay. I'll meet you back stage, okay?"
Harry leaned against the table, "Is your uncle around? He gave me something that I really need to talk to him about."
He continued breathing for a moment, not trusting himself to speak. "Harry.." the voice said softly.
Fleur looked off, recalling the conversation. "Yeah, Draco was scared. He felt something when he touched your hand.."
Before he could, the door to the office flew open, a mess of bushy hair flying through it and slamming it as soon as she could.
Harry jerked awake the night between Wednesday and Thursday. He wasn't sure what awoke him but his racing heart and clammy hands indicated a nightmare; so did the deep depression that weighed down over his chest. He tried to think back on the dream, trying to remember what it was about, but couldn't grasp anything but loud screams.
anymore). Dean Thomas, Seamus Finnigan, Neville Longbottom, Lavender Brown, and Parvati Patil, just to name a few, had all returned. Another reminder of how things have changed was the notable absence of his ginger-haired best friend, Ron. Ron had decided to skip on the Eighth Year opportunity to instead help his older brother, George, run his joke shop,
Harry reached out and grabbed one of Draco's hands that were tucked against his side. The hand felt cold, but still gave tiny shocks to Harry's arm.
Draco backed away when Harry jumped towards him. He tensed as he realized he was trapped between the door and a very intoxicated Harry Potter.
When they resurfaced, Harry jumped on top of Draco pushing him back down, while Harry stayed above the water. Little did Harry know, under water Draco grabbed at his feet and pulled him below surface.
The man had a familiar sparkle in his eye that tugged at Harry's heart, "Ah, yes. Yes in deed. This place is more special than even you can imagine. Have you had a chance to look around the whole island yet?" Harry shook his head no.
After class, he and Draco walked down to the lake, where Hermione and Pansy were already discussing their plans for the upcoming Hogsmead weekend.
Harry felt Draco lay down beside him. He turned towards the boy as more tears slipped. He hated this. He finally started to feel normal again. Well, what he assumes is normal.. he has never really been it before but what he has felt the past days has felt extremely nice and refreshing. Even the bad parts, felt good; they felt good because it was choices he was making not choices someone else was making for him. He was starting to feel alive like he had a whole bright life in front of him.
"He didn't know I had it. I found it with the other textbooks in the classroom. I had lost my book so Slughorn let me borrow one."
Draco turned his head the other and found himself face to face with the beforementioned insane magical panther. The panther laid with his head laid slightly above Draco's on the ground, soft snores coming from his open mouth. He had his body laying besides Draco's, one paw placed on Draco's arm in a clearly protective manner.
By Monday morning he felt if he looked at anymore books he would have no choice but to off himself by placing his head in the middle of two books and slamming them together. Which was a real shame because one: he now has to spent an entire evening with Granger while looking through even more books and two: he knows Granger would never allow him to hurt her books by slamming his head in between them.
Kenneth Trade removed his glasses, rubbing at his eyes he said, "Well we need to find someone with the strength.. whether either of these boys can help I'm not sure. But we all can tell the strength that they both have. Hopefully it will be enough."
Draco grabbed his wand, slowly levitating a large metal dish, full to the brim with meats, towards the sleeping cat. If calculations were correct, the panther should be up any minute now.
She pushed a curly piece of hair that fell out of her eccentric-looking bun, quickly changing the subject to be back on task. "I have a lot of books in my office and at home on various creatures, I have looked through most of my office books, but not the home books as of yet. There is a lot of material, I believe it would be easiest if we did research together. Not only would we get through the information faster but we could also bounce ideas off of each other."
Harry Potter is not a drinker. Not in the slightest. Yet, the night before as he watched Draco many emotions he thought he had successfully suppressed began rising to the surface once again. So, in a panic, he drank. He drank
Thank you so much for reading and being patient with my updates, it means the world! & if you want to read a finished book of mine, I have a one shot called The Color Blue. 💙
"I have this gift where I can send emotions, send thoughts from just a touch. We had to find someone to complete a ritual to keep the tree alive. The ritual.. they didn't tell me the full truth of it. The truth of what it entails. I found out this morning and-"
Harry faced the roof again, letting out a deep breath, "What if-" He closed his eyes, tears falling rapidly down the sides of his face, "What if this is them? What if the Death Eaters.. what if Voldemort's followers set this whole thing up. What if-"
Harry let out a breath, "I'm not sure what talking to Bill or Fleur would do. I doubt they would tell us anything. I just wish the damn bastard would talk to me. I don't care if he is some half-bird or hald-fish or half-.. anything. I just want to talk to him, and not just because of these weird sensations but because he is actually nice to talk to."
As soon as he got off the stage, Draco ran to his phone to type Pansy a quick SOS text. It took her three minutes and forty seconds to call him. Draco panicked the whole time he waited.
Draco opened his mouth to answer, but when nothing comes out he just closed his mouth and nodded. He looked towards Harry. Harry was staring at him thoughtfully.
When the cat began breathing harder, Draco slowly sat up and turned to face the cat, petting him soothingly. "Léon, it's okay, hey.. everything-"
constantly rolling through Harry's head, he made what he thinks is a pretty good guess. Draco Malfoy is a Veela. Or part-veela, at the very least. He opted to not tell Hermione what he heard Saturday after they left the library. He felt bad enough about eavesdropping to begin with and couldn't bring himself to speak about the private conversation he heard. Even now, the sound of Draco's voice being broken up and seemingly
Léon sat many feet away from Draco, feigning interest in watching a band of butterflies fluttering over the lake's edge.
The rest of the evening and night went by dreadfully slow. After his conversation with Fleur, McGonagal and Pomfrey, they forced him to head to bed. He attempted to sneak in that night but Pomfrey had set alarms up and had caught him, even with his invisibility cloak. He was told he could come to see Draco
When he first began working with animals, he started off large dealing with dragons out in Romania, after being sent there by the Ministry for a year as a form of community service to pay his debts for his hand in the war. The Ministry said it was to help out with the large number of dragons that had formed in the areas and to help him learn responsibility for ones own actions. Draco thinks he was sent there in hopes that he would accidentally catch on fire or get trampled by the winged beast. Sadly, neither of them happened. If anything, the opposite happened. Draco fell in love with the beasts. Many times he wondered if his year in Romania was what sparked his saving-creatures love, but thinking back he would realize how this obsession started much sooner than that. Maybe during the war, or perhaps even before that? He never could be sure. As the year of his services closed, Draco knew he couldn't go back home, not yet, so when given the opportunity to stay in Romania and continue his work, he jumped at the chance, only coming back to his home land a little after a year later due to his father falling ill. After his Father passed, he gravely wished he could return to his dragons, but knew in his heart he couldn't leave his mother to mourn alone.
He was just passing by what he thought was an empty class room, when he felt the pull of warmth, pulling him towards the closed door. He stopped, taking a moment to feel the familiar warmth that he has missed over the past week, and then he pressed his ear to the door.
"Oh, adamant? Big word there, Potter." Malfoy leaned over, pulling the essay closer to him. "Let's take a look, shall we?"
Harry narrowed his eyes. "Intentions? My only intentions right now are to make sure he is okay. Not sure if you heard but the last I saw of him he was laying in a pool of his own blood."
"She loves sunsets, or used to I'm not sure how she feels of them now, but one day before sixth year, before everything had happened, she showed me this secrete enchanted door that lead to a beautiful hill site with a never ending sunset." He smiled softly before his face began to fall, "I told her how scared I was. How I felt I couldn't do it. She took me in her arms, placed a flower in my hair and told me that I had to remember that while a sunset marks the end of a new day, it is also the beginning of a very, very bright and powerful sunrise."
After getting over the surprise of the question, Draco smiled softly at Harry, "Well, I have always had a love for music growing up." He sighed, wondering if he should go into detail. Figuring it wouldn't matter either way, he dove into his explanation, "At the balls my parents used to throw I remember always being so fascinated at the musicians they had, specifically the pianist. I remember one pianist my father hired was exceptionally talented. That man could play piano in his sleep. One day he arrived early and began to teach me a few things. He played for us a few times after that and often would teach me a little bit before the guest arrived.. but one day he just stopped arriving early, and then he stopped arriving at all." He paused for a moment with a far away look, "I asked my father about why he stopped coming and all he said was, '
Pansy rubbed his arm, "I know. I wish I had answers instead of questions, my love. Like, how where you there? You said he saw you and talked to you but how? Do you think.. do you think your gift grew? Maybe you have some form of Astral Projection now?"
Glancing over at the digit clock on the table side, Draco sighed and got to his feet to prepare for his next location.
Just as quickly as the visions began, they stopped. He wasn't falling any longer, he was now floating. Floating on something soft and warm. Something inviting. Draco's lungs, which must have fallen at a slower rate than the rest of him, finally caught up to his body and he could breath again. He breathed deeply for a few moments before wiggling his toes, then his fingers, then his feet and hands. When all limbs and appendages seemed to be intact and not retching in pain, he looked around himself.
A big wave rose up behind Harry, pushing him forwards, nearly underwater again. Draco laughed as he help Harry back up, "You might want to look into getting a new pair of glasses. Whatever has been helping you see clearly is starting to wear off."
Their uncle laid his hands on the edges of the arm rest, "There is much more to be lose than just beauty."
He luckily could remember the night, but that also means he not so luckily remembers the embarrassing moments he had with Draco outside the bar.
Harry was forced to stay outside the infirmary while Pomfrey continued treatments. He reluctantly complied. He wasn't sure how long he sat there staring at the large wooden doors, but when Madame Pomfrey, along with Fleur and McGonagal came through, his whole body was aching.
He raised an eyebrow towards Draco, "If they are, what do you think they think of us?" He whispered back.
Harry looked towards Malfoy, noticing he had tensed slightly, finger freezing in its movements down the page. His skin seemed to turn even whiter than it normally is, competing with the white snow that falls every winter. In the blink of an eye, the boy relaxed again and continued skimming the book, the only indication of his discomfort was the still slightly tensed shoulders and the worry-inducing paleness. Harry wanted to reach over and soothe the rest of the tension out of his neck, but quickly diminished the idea knowing Malfoy wouldn't be very accepting of it.
Draco thanked the man and grabbed his bags. Checking his watch he realized he still had six hours until his showing at 8.
Harry walked forward, placing his hands on Malfoy's shoulders without hesitation. "I was there, you know, that night. I saw you.. saw the look on your face. Saw you lowering your wand before.. before Snape came in."
Draco looked towards the door, feeling the exact same way, "Pretty much the same as today. Nothing but exploring, that is if the weather permits it. I am doing a few songs at this founder's shin-dig tomorrow night. Your welcome to come if you want."
Harry chuckled, softly. "I think being in the Hufflepuff's old room is doing some crazy things to my head."
She laid a single ticket down in-between them. Before Harry got the chance, Draco grabbed the ticket.
Hampton walked his uncle to his vacant seat, moving to stand in-between them, leaning against the fireplace; he wanted to be close in case he needed to intervene.
The boys sat in the little cafe Harry had went to when he first arrived. It was a lot more busy today, most likely from people trying to escape the bad weather.
now and no longer had to abide by school rivalry practices. Draco insisted that she send that idea on a portkey to Timbuktu for all he cared.
While he knows his friends would allows love him not matter what, he couldn’t help but fear that they would make him choose between them or Draco. Through the years, even after the war, their hatred for anything remotely Malfoy seemed to become more intense. He understood why completely. Draco was an ass all of school. He was down right
Harry focused on a particular bright star as he spoke, "Yeah I did. If you can call what I went through as 'living'. They forced me to do everything for them, forced me to do everything for.. for their son. If he had a request I had to fill it. No matter the request. Or else I would be severely punished. I used to live under the stair in their home did you know that? It was tiny cupboard that I barely fit into. For years, my only friend was a spider. His name was Jerrold. He would often leave for a long while and then come back. I'm not really sure if it was the same spider or not but it was someone I could talk to so I didn't care. They would often lock me away for days, sometimes weeks and forget to feed me. When Hagrid showed up and told me I was a wizard, it seemed like my world was flipped right side up. A lot of weird things had happened as I got older. My aunt and uncle would get furious at me when those things happened and I never understood why until Hagrid explained it to me. He was so kind and friendly that I found myself liking him instantly."
Harry had to cover his mouth to stop himself from laughing too loudly, "I, um, I think I can give you an explanation for that one."
Hampton gave him a look that clearly stated that he didn't believe him but let Harry pass by anyways.
Therapy has taught him otherwise. Therapy has shown him that this fascination of wanting to be on the top wasn't just because he liked the praise or the feeling of accomplishing something. This fascination with being on top was a way for Draco to feel unreachable.
The room dropped to a deafening silence as Harry realized what he said. "I meant- Draco, can I- I mean, can I see him? Please?"
Draco looked towards to where the noise came from, "I wish that storm would just get here and get out. It's starting to really freak me out how it is just creeping very, very slowly around the island."
The man smirked, showing off teeth so straight and white a dentist would be jealous, "I just wanted to introduce myself, my name is Kyle Scott. I'm the drummer for tonight. I heard you play last night and I'm super excited to get to perform with you."
He hadn't told anyone, only vaguely mentioning the show of powers in the reports, choosing to leave out the near death experience.
The beach was fairly empty this afternoon, except for the few people who were building up a tall bonfire stack a little ways away.
She took an even deeper breath in, leaning her back against her desk, knocking over one of the picture frames. She didn't notice.
Daphne quickly placed her own drink and meal order before turning towards Draco, "Why did you have to be gay? We could have basically been related and I wouldn't have to hear my sister talk about
Harry stared deep into Draco's eyes, the gold that surrounded his iris flickered. Flames, Harry realized. "I am your mate. I am yours. You are mine. I know you won't do anything to hurt me. If you can't trust yourself,
Draco smiled softly at the panther, who sat down once they had made it to the door. "Be good, kitty."
The moment he looked up, Harry stopped breathing for the twelfth time in the past 24 hours. Sitting on a bar stool, with his legs dangling loosely, sat Malfoy looking as if he was on top of the world. The song began slowly but all Harry could focus on was how the light made Malfoy's hair and smile shine even brighter.
"Yes, really." The Professor ushered her three former students towards a café across the sun-heated road, "Why don't we get something to drink and we can speak more on the matter?"
Whether his heart was racing from nearly falling out the chair or from Draco's hands, Harry wasn't sure. But he did know that it sped up twice the normal amount when Draco whispered the word love.
Kyle bit his lip, hiding a smile, "Thank you. If you don't mind me asking, what are your plans now that your shows are over?"
Malfoy's smile was sad, and Harry knew he had to wipe the sadness away. He reached over, lightly touching Malfoy's arm, causing the boy to suck in his breath and the electricity to return to Harry's hand. Harry glanced down at his hand for a moment, before ignoring the feeling to focus on the boy instead, "Well, if you want to talk about it, you know where I stay. In case you can't remember, I could draw you a map to be able to get to my quarters easier."
Turning around a tall bush, he slammed himself straight into something tall and hard. Whatever it was toppling over him, landing directly onto his chest. Draco closed his eyes as his lightheaded-ness morphed into a full-blown migraine.
Draco dropped an actual kiss on Harry's crinkled up nose before pulling away, bringing the other boy with him.
George Foster rolled his eyes as he looked at his distant cousin, "I told you there was something wrong with that boy. How could you not feel the power? He was sitting right next to you?"
Hand strumming the last cord, Draco felt himself become frozen. Draco is often on stages, always performing for new people, new personalities, new faces. But he has never had someone, let alone someone from his past, look at him with such awe. As odd as it was to have
A sly look slowly grew on Harry's face, "You were always so easy to rile up. Glad to see that hasn't changed."
Draco grabbed it lightly in his hand, covering the blistered side gently. He looked around to make sure no one was watching before whispering a quick healing charm.
Their uncle smiled sweetly at both of them, "Well, well, isn't this a sight to see both of you here. Tell me, George, how was the shop? Any guest?"
Draco was cut off as an ear pitching scream sounded around the entire room. The scream so high pitched, Draco had to hold onto his mic stand to keep from falling over. The room seemed to disappear, leaving only Draco and the insanely high pitched scream that continuously got louder. Draco felt as if his body was completely empty, nothing left but the drilling sounds and his own agony. The sound rang through Draco's mind, body, and soul, eating away at every piece of him. The noise of a thousand nails on chalkboards and a million saws going through steel echoed in his mind, even after he knew the sound had subsided.
Harry closed his eyes and roughly dropped his head back on to table. Draco grabbed a plane bagel with a napkin and pushed towards the boy, "Eat. It will help. Some coffee or tea would help too."
Draco glanced down, cheeks pinking as he realized he grabbed Pansy magazine instead of his own latest edition of
in common - obsessing over school work, constantly reading and learning even when they don't have to, constantly badgering Harry to do his work, fighting for the rights of house elves, their want to get into the ministry to try and fix the corrupt systems. It was almost scary the amount they had in common.
Hermione looked towards the boy, eyes stuck between being angry and disappointed. Her eyes ran in between her best friend and the human she despised the most, besides Voldemort and Bellatrix.
When the song ended, Harry realized he was a little sad that there wouldn’t be more. Now that he has heard Malfoy play, he wanted more.
As the second song came to a close and the third slowly began, he couldn't help but look around at all the adoring faces of the crowd and smiled broadly.
After a pregnant pause, Harry spoke words that he never in his wildest dream thought he would ever tell Draco Malfoy, "It wasn't your fault."
He put his hands on the back of his neck, massaging the muscles gently. Killing one person for the sake of beauty was one things, killing two just to keep an island beautiful was another. There has to be more to it. Why would they kill two innocent people just to have pretty land?
Draco shrugged, picking up the magazine he was reading before Granger showed up, blindly. "Yes, that works for me. See you than, Granger."
Harry gave him a small smile, "Nothing, really, I just was thinking about how I used walk around the halls at night like this. Before the war. Before.. everything that has happened." Being surrounded by mostly darkness, and with the knowledge - the hope - that nothing is out to get him anymore, Harry felt safe. Having Malfoy next to him, having their arms brushing with an electric shock every step, brought Harry that safe feeling as well, which didn't scare or confuse him as much as he thought it should.
Harry let out a slow breath, "Draco doesn't.. he doesn't want me.. he just feels pulled because of.. because.."
More often than not, Harry would find his gaze drift off towards Malfoy. If Harry thought his extreme change of appearance was peculiar, his attitude and personality switch was even more so. The blue-haired boy sat off by a bookshelf next to a fire place with his former-Slytherin friends, Pansy and Blaise. From the corner of his eye, Harry would watch as Malfoy smiling broadly at his friends, sometimes even laughing with the most open expression Harry had ever seen on the boy. It was the most bizarre thing he has seen in a while. And to make things even more bizarre, the sight was sending tingles down his arms. Harry decided to ignore that fact.
come from? Yes, him and Draco have been very.. friendly / non-friendly lately but a few snuggles and kisses that weren't even on the lips doesn't mean you are dating, right?
close he would push me away. I have been trying to get him to talk for the past week, but he continued to ignore me and now he.. oh god." A rush of despair hit his chest, causing him to topple over.
Draco brought their foreheads together, then without hesitation slammed their lips together in a toe-curling, fire-filled kiss.
Draco placed the sheet of parchment on the small coffee table in front of him as he leaned back into the still leather couch. He looked around the room, surprised to see the mess that littered the small office. In the handful of times Draco has been to Granger's office, it has always been extremely clean. Almost unnaturally clean. Without the few picture frames placed around the room, the rows of clearly personal books and the cloak that seemed to have a permanent residency hanging off of the back of the office chair, no one would believe this office belong to anyone.
Sitting on a large branch, was none other than the one roommate he was trying to avoid, Draco Malfoy. He looked strange, tucked up in a tree with a large book in his lap.
After a bit of a debate, they finally decided that their first stop would be the beach. Breaking only for a few minutes to go change, they soon were walking down the street to the beach entrance.
Hermione stepped in front of the bag Harry was packing, "And why this spontaneous trip, huh? Why alone?" She stepped closer to the boy, "You know they haven't caught them all."
The foot steps continued walking until Harry heard a stall door shut. He glanced at himself in the mirror, realizing all of his surroundings were fuzzy. He turned towards the bathroom door, wishing he could just
"Look, Draco," She said as her eyes danced around the room, avoiding Draco's eyes. "It's nothing truly. Personal stuff, nothing to do with the case."
As Draco stepped out from the trees and into the open floor, he instantly felt eyes on his chest. He continued with his cautious steps until he was in the middle of the floor. He whistled again. "Come on kitty. I'm not going to hurt you, I would just like my friends back."
Draco slipped his wand out, "Let's get him sedated and out of here and then we can see what we are working with and what we can do for him."
Draco stopped, "Please, for the love of all things good, don't call me that either. Call me Draco." The blonde quickly nodded and Draco walked on.
Granger took another breath in. "I swear if this magical cat doesn't kill me the annoying ass dragon will." She muttered as she stood up. "As much as I love getting to catch up with you, Draco, I must be off. I have many obligations this week as well as this weekend, but I'll owl you if anything changes. If not, would you be free to begin Monday evening? We can meet in my office and work there."
Harry leaned down and began pressing kisses against Draco’s fair skin. He started on his forehead, moving to his brows then his cheeks then his eyes and across his nose and finally stopping at his bruising lips.
"Oh, I thought about Maledictus when I was looking through my animgi books but there was way too many holes in the theory. None of it really added up, especially seeing as Léon is male. There was also no indication that he was one from the tests we took.” Draco let out a deep sigh. “That's what is so weird about all of this is that there seems to be no indication that the panther is anything but a panther."
George, Draco learned, was smiling widely, "Yes it is. Bravo, Mr. Malfoy. I heard you will be performing tonight at the meeting. Everyone is very excited to see you again."
Over the years, Draco has performed in some interesting places. Some so amazing he felt like he could fly, others that made him wish the building would catch fire just to get him out of the situation. This was one of those moments.
When they were half way through their peaceful breakfast, Draco pulled out the brochure that Forest had given him when he arrived.
Harry shoved the last of his clothes in his bag, "Its happening whether you're sure of this or not."
dream life. Yet, being in this world he was raised to look down on he still has his moments of wishing so much hadn’t had to change. Wishing he could be back to his original home. The home he has seen in nearly two full years.
When Harry arrived he stood in awe of how big the boardwalk seemed to be. From the brochures and website the boardwalk seemed to be a small little walking space with three or four shops and a small carnival at the end. The boardwalk Harry stood in front of was more of a giant outdoor flea market with the biggest carnival he has ever seen at the end of the long stretch of shops.
He walked through the back door, spotting Draco instantly. He was sitting on the bench placed against the wall in the middle of the dimly-lit hallway.
Draco leaned back in his chair, sliding his feet elegantly on top of his desk and crossing his ankles. "Now, Granger, you know I am extremely professional. I bet you fifteen Galleons that if you looked up professional in one of your many, many books you will see my dashing face, smiling brightly."
Draco looked up, no longer were there thick, jungle branches or bright green leaves. The enchanted blue, sunny sky was dimming to black. The panther who sat upon the branch, whose expression was slowly morphing into worry and regret, unbenounced to Draco, slipped out of Draco's vision. Instead, Draco saw flames. Streaks of oranges, yellows, reds and deep blues formed all around him, swallowing him slowly. He tried to scream out, but his voice was just as trapped as he was. He tried to scream towards the person floating on a broom above him, but they only looked down at Draco with joy, glad to see Draco pay for all he has done.
There was silence for a moment. Harry wanted to spill everything to her. Wanted to tell her everything that has happened and what he some how got himself into. But he just can't. He doesn't want to worry her. He can't worry her. Not after everything they have been through. As far as she knows, he is having the time of his life and it will stay that way.
"Draco," he responded, handing the man his bags. They both got into the car and the man started up his engine.
Draco glanced around the boardwalk, finding that majority of the people on the pier were stopped looking at them with confusion and disbelief laced across their faces. Many were whispering to each other while glancing at the pair every few seconds, some even pointing. A few workers in the bakery next to them were unashamedly staring at them, customers forgotten.
Years of constantly hearing whispers and feeling eyes on them,  had both Draco and Harry attuned to when eyes were watching them.
Draco had almost made it all the way to the top of the vines before he noticed the slight tingle of magic surrounding his hands. He looked up, startled at the cat who had moved positions and was now sitting upright on the branch, tailing hanging down loosely.
Potions the next Friday was one of the worst ones yet. Harry couldn't focus, he constantly was looking back towards Draco. He was worried for the stupid prat. His eyes looked sunk-in, his lips chapped, his cheek hollow. It looked as if with one hard swoop of wind, the boy would collapse or fly away with the wind. Harry felt icky about listening in on the private conversation he heard last Saturday. He tried to wash the ickiness away but it never worked. Every time he saw the boy or saw something of the boy's or saw something that reminded him of the boy the ickiness intensified.
Harry switched the water off and leaned against the sink, willing the cold, emptiness he felt in his chest to go away.
Harry stood leaning against the side of the hotel building, waiting for his ride. Like planned the night before, Hampton and Harry were going to Malfoy's show together. Harry was excited not only to be able to chat with Hampton again, but also to see Malfoy perform again. When thinking about how the next few hours will go, Harry's hands become clammy and he gets a little light headed. From the nerves of the "date" he is going on or the prospect of seeing Malfoy perform again, he wasn't sure.
Harry shrugged, "Kinda obvious. I have been getting these strange feelings lately when I am around him. Over the past few weeks they have continuously gotten stronger and very intense. I did some research, with Hermione's help, and I started studying up on Veela because that was the only thing that could really make sense." He looked to Fleur, "I saw you the first night back at school, leaving Draco's bed, I heard the end of your conversation."
He swallowed thickly. Thinking about everything that lead up to that moment was traumatizing, it took multiple sessions to even begin talking about it with his therapist. But sitting here with Potter made Draco want to spill all his guts out. The only explanation to why is that maybe he would understand what Draco had been going through. After the war, when interviews with the Chosen One began coming out, his mother would often sigh dramatically and tell Draco about how him and the boy seemed to be two sides of the same coin. Draco wasn't really sure what she meant, but he never dared to asked.
Harry was so wrapped up in the captivating voice, he couldn’t even be shocked that the angelic voice he was listening to was Draco Malfoy. Malfoy's voice was extremely calming. Listening more intently, Harry realized just how beautiful Malfoy's voice actually was. The sound, Harry soon found, was addicting. It's like he couldn't stop listening nor could he look away from the almost angelic looking man.
Draco to talk to him? He should of pushed harder, especially after knowing what could happen to Veela's without their mates. He should have tried harder. Why didn't he try harder?
without talking to the rest of the council. I don't give a damn if he is the oldest of the founder families. Someone has to talk to him before he does something as reckless as giving the boys a key to a private jet so they can escape."
This Malfoy standing in front of Harry looked nothing like the Malfoy he saw last. This Malfoy was bright. No dark circles could be found, no hollow cheeks. While he still did have that very characteristic pointy-ness, his features had softened with the weight he has gained. His eyes were brighter than Harry thought possible. The smokey grey eyes that used to be so dark it seemed to reflect his old personality, were now a bright cloudy grey. Looking up at the man that stood in front of him Harry couldn't help but wonder if this bright eyed, soft featured man could possibly be the same sour little boy he knew back in school.
"I know we will probably never be friends." Malfoy continued, "But it's been a long journey. I'm tired of fighting. So, we don't have to be friends. But could we at least pretend to not hate each other? At least to get through this year?"
Harry smiled widely, rubbing his nose against Draco's cheek, "That's a nice way to wake up." Harry pulled Draco's body closer, cuddling into it.
Upon arrival, Harry quickly noted how neat Draco’s room was, and then his mind jumped to the fact that he was currently standing in Draco’s room.
A new development in the learning of Draco Malfoy, was that he was extremely affectionate to the ones he is close to. Harry found within the last two weeks that Draco loved saying endearments, especially to Harry.
Harry continued to focus on his breathing as he leaned back against the hard chest behind him, "He told me.. he pushes me away.. the last time we got close, he almost knocked himself out trying to get away from me and he kept saying that he can't control it.. he looked terrified and he just kept apologizing.
Rage-filled eyes turned to him, "Calm down? You want me to calm down? Our uncle may have just destroyed our lives. He gave that stupid boy the
. Even though this boy was completely different from the one in school, he still bare the same face, the same name, the same haunting memories of the past.
Malfoy made a disapproving noise, "Don't trust me to lead you to the right place, Potter?" The awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere they were just in melted away.
his mate, I know we will be seeing a lot of each other. Draco is my best friend and has been for a long time. I would take a bullet for him, only that statement actually means something for someone like me. I don't trust you, not at all, but Draco seems to. If he wants you in his life, then I can live with you sometimes being in mine too."
Draco eyed the panther for a moment before stepping to the side, getting closer to the blue light. "You know, I used to work with dragons, years ago. They were very large and mighty beast. Extremely powerful in both physicality and magical ways, but you, kitty, seem to be one of the most powerful creatures I have ever had the pleasure of meeting if you were able to do all you have done tonight."
So, now he sat in the back of the library with a determined Hermione flipping rapidly through multiple different books at once. What she was looking for, he wasn't sure. When Harry was looking earlier he didn't know what he was looking for either but he remembered Hermione saying how every answer can be found in a book of some sort, so he just began looking through any book he deemed would show him an answer.
Draco took a deep breath and began tapping his wand tip against each corner of the door, softly whispering, "
“Keep your eyes open, we will figure this out.” Draco whispered back before walking towards the door.
A small women holding a brown-haired toddler and the hand of a blonde headed little girl, walked in glancing around. She smiled brightly when she noticed them.
"Are they down there?" He asked. In answer, the cat tilted his head towards the steps before descending.
Harry was confused by this. Dumbledore would have protected them, the Order as well, if they would have just asked, right?
He startled as Draco picked up his hand, threading their fingers together, "I think they were making fun of you, love."
Draco shrugged his shoulder, clutching his cup harder. "Around five... maybe six? I'm not sure really. He was young.. and so bloody scared."
"Draco?" He asked tentatively, "Are you awake?" Harry leaned closer, noticing how the boy seem to be barely breathing. He dropped his bag instantly and went to where Draco's face was.
In respect for Draco, Harry sat across the table, "Look, I'm sorry about that night. I felt horrible when I woke up the next day and realized what I said. Me and him have a long history, and not a romantic kind and seeing him it just-"
Draco turned Harry's body, till they were flushed together, "A bit? I think they don't even have heads to be touched. They seem to be headless hands that just throw things together and hope for the best." He sighed, pushing his forehead against Harry's suddenly very serious, "I'm so sorry. For everything you have had to go through. That you continue to go through. I'm so sorry for my involvement in that war. I didn't help back then, but I will help you now. I will do whatever it takes to keep you safe. Especially from the likes of Death Eaters."
Harry looked at his best friend with a sheepish grin, "Well, I thought it would be okay if Malfoy came with us to Hogsmead. We are meeting Ron so I figured you would want some time alone with him for a while and I didn't really fancy being alone."
Draco slowly turned his head back towards the panther's. The panther snores turned to deep breathes and whimpers as his eyes began moving  frantically behind his eyelids. The paw on Draco's arm flinched away, only to grab onto his thin shirt again, as if grasping for help.
Malfoy shook his head, "No, not at all actually. The ingredients might be the same but when mixed together they can have different affects to the person or thing, plus different reactions to each other, therefore the antidotes more than likely wouldn't help because the property of the different ingredients had been changed or altered. Same case with the antidotes. If you mix the antidotes together, the ingredients may cancel each other out causing them to be ineffective or in the worst case scenario could even hurt the person more.
Luna's eyes brightened as she spotted Malfoy, "Hello, cousin. I love your hair!" She sauntered over to him and ran a hand through the sky blue strands, "It is gorgeous. It really makes your eyes pop."
Malfoy flipped the sink next to Harry on. The water ran down Malfoy's pale, slender fingers and palm, and Harry was enraptured as the blurry hands began gently rubbing soap over them.
Giving no further explanations, the man walked out of a side door that Harry swore wasn't there before. He stuffed the paper and necklace into his bag and began his way back to the boardwalk.
Having no words, Harry shook his head. Harry's other roommates slowly slipped in one by one. Almost all of them were from houses other than Gryffindor, except for Seamus Finnigan. He recognized the other students instantly from the D.A. -Justin Finch-Fletchley (Hufflepuff) and Terry Boot (Ravenclaw). Not too bad of a room, Harry thought, blue haired boy excluded.
In one of the moments where he was able to pull his eyes away from the blond who was distractingly rubbing the end of his quill against his lips, he felt a slight pressure of a hand against his thigh.
Gooseflesh covered his arms as he stepped onto the stones that surround the tree. He glanced around cautiously, but only saw a mother with her two children playing on the swings. He took a deep breath and walked towards the tree, the wind picking up the closer he got it.
She paused them and drew Draco closer to the wall. She looked him in the eyes, more serious than he has seen her in a while, "Now, this may seem weird to say," she paused to look around them. When she looked back up at him there was a slight look of fear laced in her eyes, "No one is going to be with you. I know about your past and who you are. So please promise me you will be safe. Promise me that if any sign of anything weird or dangerous happens you call me right away."
George's smiled widened, showing both sets of teeth, "Yes it is. Bravo, Mr. Malfoy. I heard you will be performing tonight at the meeting. Everyone is very excited to see you again."
"Has anything weird happened to while you have been here? Have you felt any pull or something like.. like.." He leaned closer, "Like magic?"
Once up in his room, Harry nearly tore the place apart looking for the green necklace he had been given. He wasn't sure why it seemed extremely important that he brought it with them, he just knew that he needed to.
Harry’s eyes hardened. “You’re a liar. Tell me what’s wrong with him, make him better. Please,” He said brokenly, “I can’t loose him, Ham. Please...”
They ended the call as Harry was entering the elevator. Not seeing Draco around in the lobby, Harry headed outside.
After stopping for an early lunch, the boys decided to head back to the hotel to not only get away from the stares that seemed to follow them, but also to go through everything that has happened.
he had for Harry ran so deep inside his body that he felt like every single organ, vein, nerve and muscle worked to be able to keep Harry happy. He realized in this moment, what he said upstairs was so true that it almost hurt. He knew he would do anything to keep this precious life safe, no matter the cost.
Thomas stepped closer to Draco's side, wand clutched tightly in his hand, "He is gifted. He can move things around with a thought, he can hurt people without touching them. Flippio, one of Marcus' guys, got hit by what he described as an intense Stinging Hex when they captured the cat. They ran a few scans on him and told that they found no trance of wizardry or witch in the cat but you know the intelligence they hold so I wouldn't take their word."
Draco smiled widely, turning towards the band, "Sounds like they want another song? What do you say guys?"
While Harry was having an epic breakdown on the floor of a bathroom stall, it seemed like the whole island had filled the bar.
They all began unpacking their bags in silence, most of them lost in the reality that they are back at Hogwarts, a place none of them thought they would ever see again. When all of Harry's things were put away, he sat down on the edge of his bed with his feet propped up on his trunk and looked at the other occupants that were now cracking jokes with each other. His stomach rumbled aloud, frightening him and the other students in the room.
Malfoy pulled his bottom lip with his teeth, "That's so odd. He always was so secretive about that book.. It was like his prize possession. I only ever got to glance through it once when he accidentally left it on his desk. Why would it be in Slughorn's collection of textbooks?"
"I am aware of what this is, Mrs. Malfoy. I wouldn't drop Draco. I couldn't. Not because of the whole mate thing but because I can never seem to drop Draco. No matter what has happened between us in the past, or what will happen to us in the future, Draco will always have me. Especially after yesterday.. I- I can't imagine a life without him."
Luna was in the middle of a speech about some creature her father found, a Narwhal, when Harry interrupted.
As the girls said their hellos, Draco leaned further into Harry's leg, nearly draped across it, he spoke softly, "Do you think," He paused for a moment, glancing at Ginny and Luna, "that they might be an item?"
It started small: going to get groceries, eating lunch with friends at a restaurant. At first everything was going smoothly, he would go out to eat with friends, shop for a couple of hours and not be bothered too much by other witches or wizards. He of course would get a few stares but he had grown used to them over the years. After a few days however, the questions started to come. Reporters, publishers, random people on the streets wouldn't leave him alone. He tried talking to them nicely, then meanly, then so mean he thought they were going to give him a one-way ticket to Azkaban, but to no avail. They didn't care. They wouldn't let him just be. They didn't care how he felt or how uncomfortable he was, they wanted answers and would stop at nothing to get them. So, when he finally had enough, he sheltered himself again. He only left for quick trips to the grocers or to see friends at their homes. Anything else he needed, he ordered by owl or persuaded Hermione or Ron to get it for him.
I can’t make promises for when the next update will be but I have already started on it and have a layout for how I want the story to unfold. So if you can stay with me and be patient it will all work itself out!
Hampton swallowed thickly, "This ritual.. is it just to keep the island beautiful or is there something larger at stake?"
"Do you think.." Granger hesitated. "From the reports it says that he has no ounce of wizardry or witch in him but what about muggle? His DNA was clearly not wizard nor witch, so do you think it’s possible he could be a muggle caught up in magic?"
The panther sat in-between them with his eyes closed. Draco's breath caught as a soft white halo of light surrounded his co-workers heads. The light flowed around their heads gently before brightening and then fading away. As the last of the light faded, Maybelle and David's eyes began to open.
Hampton's eyes scanned the room glancing at the familiar members of the Founders. Each member was the "man of the house" for each founding family. Many of them are the father figures, except for Mrs. Mellow and Widow Annie, whose husbands have both passed. Seeing as Hampton was the oldest of his three siblings and their parents have long passed, he had no choice in being the chosen one for his name.
, intending on dropping off a few books before heading home for a late supper, but as he placed the books down on his desk and turned back towards the floo, an echo of words began lacing themselves into Draco's forefront, itching in the way
Harry chuckles lightly, "Yeah, everything is fine. I just waned to call and chat for a minute. I didn't wake you did I?"
The second Draco lifted his wand, the panther lunged towards the bars, growling and attempting to claw at the air. The chains' shimmering effect halted and then sparked, the cat falling back towards the ground in a whimper as the shock the chains threw subsided.
Draco lifted his head and looked towards the floor-to-ceiling windows. "I don't know.. I don't know if they did. Besides work I haven't been practicing too much on them. But.. I don't think it was just me that was doing the memories. I wasn't myself in the beginning; I was someone completely different. This might sound insane but I felt like who ever I was, they felt familiar. As did the voice that was speaking to me."
Draco laughed, softly, "A bit? I don't think they even have a head. They seem to be just putting random shit out and hoping for the best."
with the Potter talk. Only this time, it will be good things and you damn well know how he gets when he talks about things he is, err, passionate about."
A broken whimper came out of Hampton as Harry's hands tightened on his wrist. Harry loosened his grip slightly.
Holding Draco tightly, looking as if he is a few breaths away from expiring, sent a darkness that Harry hadn’t felt in a long while rise up in himself. The noise of the rest of the people went silent as a wall made of straight magic built itself around Harry and Draco.
Draco chuckled lightly, placing his guitar on the floor and grabbing Harry's hips, "Yikes. I would be careful doing that, don't want to strain that cute head of yours too hard."
The man wobbled over to Harry with a cane that looked as if he found it in his backyard. "Well isn't this a nice surprise! I haven't had a customer in about five years! What are you in for today, young man?" He looked down at the box Harry was holding, "Ah, bit of a sports guy I see. Well, well why don't you come over here and we can ring you up, hm?" The man turned back towards the checkout counter.
Suddenly, he slid one of his hands up to Draco's jawline, "You aren't pointy anymore. Your nose is and your cheeks still are a little..."
Harry was sitting in the library with his head in his hands throwing daggers at his potions essay that laid in front of him, when he felt someone sit beside him. The side of Harry’s body warmed instantly at the feel of a new presence, causing Harry to look up. Malfoy, who Harry was sure he saw sitting at the back of the library, was looking at him with a knowing smirk.
The room was quiet when the two students walked in. Madame Pomfrey, McGonagal, Fleur and Narcissa Malfoy stood around an empty bed. The tension in the room could've been sliced with a knife.
The books Draco had brought the night before still sat upon the table, waiting and wishing to be opened. Draco knew that he would only drive himself crazy if he tried to sit still and read. So, he chucked off his outer robes and headed towards his charge.
Draco made his way outside and began walking down the beach, finally finding a stump to sit on. Pansy stayed silent the whole time Draco was explaining who was there. It took her a whole minute and a half (that Draco also panicked for) to come up with something to say.
A moment passed. When Draco realized Harry wasn't going to continue, Draco asked, "So, he isn't like.. I mean you and him aren't.."
He had decided the second day of school that Harry would play nice with Malfoy, if only to get his questions answered. While he doesn't trust the stinking git, he does agree with Malfoy about the fighting. Harry has been fighting his entire life, now that the worst of the war is done, he needs a grace period of just being a regular semi-nice human being.
Draco smiles out the window, taking in the beautifully flat plains and the growing flowers all along the gravel highway. "I'm performing at La Crows tonight and tomorrow night."
She shook her head, "No, I don't- I can't- its been a year. I can't-" She attempted to swallow her memories, "This is our last school year." She faced Harry, grabbing tightly to the hand that held hers, "This is our last chance to be students, Harry. This is our last chance to be normal. We-
Forest faced lit up in an instant, "It is isn't it? The island is exceptionally beautiful. The landscape is marvelous isn't it? You know many people travel here just to see the beauty.. or to study it."
Harry walked over to where Draco was standing holding a jar with what looked like hawk talons, "Yeah I'm starting to think this isn't just any old muggle shop."
Not being able to stop himself, Draco leaned in and rubbed his nose against the boys, giving Harry a light eskimo kiss.
Harry gently splashed some water in Draco's directions, "They are called contacts and they work perfectly fine. They help me see whats in-front of me, not behind me."
Once he was able to get his breathing and his erratic heart under control, Harry leaned against the sink.
"Why don't we set you up in one of the private rooms to chat, Headmistress?" Madame Pomfrey offered.
After a minute Hampton cleared his throat, glancing around the room nervously, "Listen, I don't have too much time to explain, I could get in some deep shit just for talking to you about any of this but I have to let you know.. there is a reason you two were brought here."
As the new headmaster, Headmistress McGonagal, stood to begin the welcoming speech, the Great Hall's door swung open, entering two late-comers.
He was about to ask again when Hampton suddenly closed his eyes and whispered, "There is a reason we chose the Boy Who Lived and the son of Narcissa Malfoy."
"This is the third song, y'all just made it to the half way mark." A lanky, dirty blond haired boy leaned over to whisper.
, if I thought he was just an animal that happen to be understanding, one look into his eyes and you would know instantly that he is more than just an animal. Last week, I swear he even-" Draco cut himself off, unsure if he should tell her what happened with the vines.
, that sat in the middle of the room. The audience stood giving him a standing applause. The spell finally broke as Harry stood up to clap.
Their bodies were pressed together tightly, almost causing Harry to pass out from the feeling of lightening bolts and flames that struck at every nerve in the raven-haired boy's body. Harry moved his forehead against Draco's, too light headed to keep it up straight.
Draco laughed, "Please, Pansy, Blaise couldn't even behave himself in Potions when we had Snape to answer to. There is no hope for him." They both laughed.
Those weren't the ones that interested Draco though. Three different pamphlets that covered multiple interesting facts about the island were. One of them focused on theories on Ol' Howler, the gift of the old tree, while the other two dig into many different legends and prophecies that surrounded Hunulaya.
Harry peeked over the covers and around his canopy just in time to see a familiar head of blonde hair walk out the room.
Draco shrugged. "It's alright. You said you were busy last week so I assumed you wouldn't have gotten much done on the panther case. I have finished looking through my collection of books and I came up with a small list of probabilities but none of them have any form of base."
McGonagall explained that Quidditch teams would be picked by the teachers this year, instead of the oldest students. The teams would be a collection of students from each dormitory instead of houses.
- need to stay focused on that. On being normal school kids. We can be normal." Hermione talked like she was trying to persuade not only Harry but herself.
, but thinking deeper, thinking about what it would do to Draco, how he would die slowly, oh-so-slowly, if something happened to him, he knew he would protect himself too.
Harry stared down at Draco's chest, "Forest. Forest was the one who told.. could he be the one who told me, too?" He racked his brain trying to think back on that night, "Why did I have to be get so drunk that night.."
The rest of the set went just the same. Singing his heart out, looking over at the crowd constantly catching Harry's eyes, accidentally or on purpose he wasn't sure.
Draco shrugged, "Maybe because often times to have something great you have to give something in return. Every piece of magic comes with a price. Even simple spells. Dark magic especially. Often times you need blood or a lot of strength. Seeing as how this has been going on for centuries, even tho it doesn't seem like they did a good job at whatever they were trying to accomplish, they must have sacrificed someone or something extremely powerful."
Draco laid back on his towel, watching the sunset beside him. Looking at the beautiful mix of blue, pinks and oranges, he couldn't help but think back on something his mother once told him, a few weeks before his sixth year began.
She turned her eyes to the side. Harry could see the water welling up in them. He could instantly see how much she seemed to care immensely for Draco.
Draco stood on stage, strumming his guitar, singing the last line of his set. The crowd cheered as he said his goodbyes, chanting,
Harry let out an exasperated groan, "Than what is it, Draco? Why haven't you even looked at me in four -nearly five days?"
Draco hesitated, until Harry kissed his nose and then his blushing cheek, whispering a quick "I'll be fine" in his ear.
Draco sighed in frustration as he looked out the window. His plane had been delayed almost an hour and a half and the trip there had to be slowed majorly due to a storm. He was lucky if he would even make it to Hunulaya in time for his first show. Or hell, even his second show. Half an hour later, the pilot thanked everyone for their patience and for joining the flight.
"Oh really? You had a panic attack in the bathroom of a random bar too?" The thumb of the hand that still softly held Draco's shoulders began absentmindedly stroking Draco's collar bone.
"They wouldn't exactly say. I tried everything to get it out of them but all they would say about it is that they found him 'around'. Seeing as he is a very large panther of some sort I'm not very certain what they mean by that, boss."
She let out a dry laugh, rubbing her face again. "Wow, thanks Draco. You really know how to make a girl feel better."
person, somehow you have become my everything. I want you so much it hurts, and I am ready to take what ever you are willing to give me."
Hermione hummed in confirmation, not elaborating anymore until they where were he and Hermione had to split up for their next class.
Harry's look of confusion morphed into one of annoyance, "Yes, this bloody essay will be the death of me. Slughorn seems adamant on murdering me this semester just to make a point about sixth year."
Harry smirked as he followed his roommate out into the hallway, "Hell no, knowing you you would probably lead me to a hidden room with fake food that was laced with poison."
"And when Draco finds out? Nothing could stop him from coming for your head, and you know it." He leaned in closer so only Pansy and Harry could hear, "Even without his inheritance you know how possessive and defensive Draco is."
They walked for many minutes until they came across a small rock archway, which Draco assumed lead a cave of some sort. The panther looked back at Draco before turning towards the cave and entering, the blue light following leaving the darkness of the forest to once again surround Draco.
anything other than the boy standing in front of him. He felt as if his whole being was meant to be wrapped around the soft warmth that this beautiful creature staring back at him has constantly provided him with for days on end. He wasn't sure how long they stood staring but when Malfo- no,
"Léon.." Draco softly spoke. "Léon, it's okay, it's just a dream." He put his hand on the panther's paw and began softly petting him. "It's alright, you are just dreaming."
The replacement drummer for tonight stood in the door way, the usual one had gotten catch in a ditch and broke his foot. Draco couldn't help but look the drummer up and down. He looked... delicious. He had his long brown hair, so dark it was almost black, in a bun. His cool olive skin made the green in his deep blue eyes pop drastically, the grey long sleeve shirt that was rolled up to his elbows showed off his muscled arms.
Harry gazed down at the parchment that sat between the two boys, trying to decide if he should mention the Half-Blood Prince’s book that he used. Seeing Malfoy looking at him in wonder, he knew he had to tell him. "I had this book. It was written by someone who called themselves the ‘Half-Blood Prince’, who actually-"
She shrugged, "Gotta stick with what you love, darling." A smirk slowly fell onto her face as she adjusted her computer, "Speaking about what you love.."
Harry sat on the floor in a bathroom stall contemplating his life decisions. The second he recognized who was walking onto the stage he bolted into the bathroom. The past two and a half years he went without having to see his face and now in a random tiny island he runs into the one person he hoped to never see again.
Harry couldn't help but smile at the brightness that shown through the boy's face when talking about his old elf. He suddenly felt an overwhelming curiosity about the boy next to him, feeling an intense want -
Draco nodded in acknowledgment, quickly throwing out unlocking and counter-spells and charms. Cursing softly, Draco faced the other four, "I'm going to do an incantation that should allow me access, I need two of you to grab the door as soon as it begins falling, the other two keep your wands trained on the room in case he is ready to attack. After the door is off I'm sliding in and I need you block off the hole so nothing can escape. Clear?"
Draco smiled one of his sweet smiles up at Harry. Turning back towards the conversation the others were having.
Even as he sat up slowly, the room began spinning. He moaned softly as he forced himself out the bed. He took an abnormally long shower, letting the water slowly wash everything that happened the night before away. Including the dreadful conversation he and Hampton had once they drove off from the bar.
He looked towards Harry to tell him his concern, when he realized the shelves that lined the walls, each had many jars and vials of
The Great Hall fell to a hush as they looked towards the two students that had just arrived. A familiar pointy-faced boy with pastel blue hair and a girl no older than eleven with strawberry blonde waltzed in. The two walked towards the farthest left side table, Slytherin table, as if they didn't just cause the entire hall to lose its speech. The girl was talking animatedly to the boy, who was smiling and nodding along. The older boy, though his hair wasn't the same, was still very recognizable. With a pointy chin and nose and a lanky body, it was none other than an older looking Draco Malfoy.
Harry still wasn't sure exactly what Draco and Fleur were talking about, but with the research him and Hermione had conducted over that weekend and the single word
The class moved smoothly from then on. Malfoy continued to hold a little bit of tension in his shoulders and neck, Harry continued to push away the thought of helping him rid the tight muscles, every tiny touch the two shared sent what felt like literal sparks onto Harry's skin, and their potion turned out the perfect shade of gold.
"Where is he?" A frantic voice broke through the room. Harry was pulled away from Draco as Madame Pomfrey began running test and mumbling to herself.
Draco's mouth opened but before he could know what was being said, the scene shifted again, this time putting him back to where the little boy was sitting against the wall. This time, however, there was a long stroke of blood across his shirt.
Unlike in his youth, Draco Malfoy now hates being seen. Which looking at his career choice, seems very strange. Ever since graduation all Draco has wanted to do was disappear, but he knew that wasn't realistic. So, instead of disappearing entirely, he chose to travel the muggle world, writing music and learning of cultures he never knew existed. Over the past few years he has come to respect muggles and their crafty way. They were able to do some incredible things with only two hand and no magic. Draco still doesn't understand a lot of muggles and their strange ways, but he respects it all the same.
"Hello." He whispered when the cat came to a stand-still, growling softly. "Cool party trick you have here."
His two co-workers, he noted, seemed to be in a sleep-like trance, if the small smiles and too-relaxed features that graced their faces where anything to go by. As far as Draco could see, there was no physical harm done to either of them. Draco glanced back at the panther. The large cat had his ears perked up and nose risen in the air, looking at Draco with interest and slight curiosity. The moment the cat noticed Draco looking, he quickly turned his head away and began slashing his tail around in annoyance again.
"It's okay." Draco reassured him. "You don't have to tell me, love. Would you be able to tell me where we are, perhaps?"
The rest of the weekend went by too fast, in Harry's opinion. Waking up on Monday morning with knowledge that the first thing he is going to do is brew a potion and be force to listen to Slughorn's dull and boring lectures, makes Harry want to pretend he is dying just to stay in the warmth of his bed.
They stood in a building, only one street away from the boardwalk, that was decorated to the max with tropical styled items. Beautiful large, white lanterns were tied to the ceiling, looking as if they were floating, on the far right side were two bars both decorated with a variety of tropical plants and Hawaiian grass skirting, the bartenders that were setting up their bars were both shirtless, wearing only colorful leis and over sprouted green flower crowns. He couldn't see the bottom half of the bartenders but assumed they also were wearing grass skirts, like the wait staff was. Directly in front of them was an array of circular tables draped with white clothes, the chairs each had leis placed on the back of them for the guest to wear. There seemed to be a gap in the middle of the floor, right before the stage which Harry guessed was the dance floor.
They walked down to what looked like a bus stop in silence. Draco's mind couldn't shake away the weirdness he felt reading the pamphlets. He thought back to the tree and to what his cab driver, Forest, he remembered, told him. If what Forest had said was true, if the tree acted like that towards Draco, he had a creepy suspicion that it wasn't a coincidence he and Harry were here.
"But we still were old enough to make our own choices. I was old enough. I knew exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it, and what it would become. And I. still. did. it." Draco sighed, wishing the fun atmosphere from a few minutes ago was still here, "I did it because I was afraid. People,
He dragged his bags into the lobby and checked himself in. As he was heading towards the elevator he saw a mop of hair that he hoped he'd never see again. He threw himself behind a wall and took another peek at the person waiting for the elevator. With that crazy black hair and the soft features, which were missing of the usual glasses, there was no way to deny it. It was Harry Potter.
Harry stepped around Malfoy and into the kitchen before turning back to him, trying to push how much he means his next words with his voice and facial expressions. "Even with all the deaths, all the pain. I, honestly, think a few things seemed to have worked out alright in the end."
Draco walked behind the cat, nearly slipping on the last step from a puddle. He had to think quick and grab a jutted out piece of rock to keep from falling. The panther looked at Draco, amusement dancing in his eyes.
"This better be worth it. You know I don't do well without my eight hours." He spoke softly to the dark haired man that was waiting for him at the entrance, leaning against the doorway.
Draco scooted closer to Harry, leaning against his bent knee, "Is that you offering to help me, Potter?"
Draco slipped out of his sunflower yellow sweater, the cold mist of the forest nipping at his exposed arms. He grabbed a few of the dead rabbits by the ears, tying them to himself with a rope, and then grabbed a hold to the magically sturdy set of vines and began climbing.
Surrounding Harry were Hermione, Dean, Seamus and Neville, as well as Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, both of who Harry had gotten close to over their schooling hiatus. After the war, he and Ginny tried to take new steps in their relationship, but both found themselves enjoying each others company more as friends and less as lovers, so they decided to stick as such. Harry is happy things never turned awkward or ugly between them, he has always respected the youngest Weasley and knows she is a very good influence to have around. She also doesn't take any of Harry's shit and isn't afraid to tell Harry when he fucks up, which he appreciates.
Harry instantly stood up, hand on the door knob. intending to march in there and coddle the boy, before he even realized what he was doing. He jerked his hand away and fled as he heard footsteps walking around the room.
Draco walked closer, he recognized most of the ingredients as ingredients that he often would see Snape working with at the Manor. They weren’t just any potions ingredients, they were ingredients that were used for many dark potions.
"Well," The man, Ham, he assumed spoke, "I better be getting this one back to the hotel. I think he had a little too much to drink." He lightly grabbed Harry's hand and walked towards the small parking lot that was on the side of the bar.
Pansy rolled her eyes, "Please, the only thing Lily would ever steal is a flower from a park. And then she would probably cry afterwards because she realized she is basically a plant murderer."
Malfoy smirked, never looking up from his book, "Why are you on this hill beneath a tree talking to me?"
The two boys sat in silence until the sun went down, they eventually moved to head back to the dorms, staying silent the whole way there. The only words spoken were a soft
He waved to the others as they walked away, leaving him and Draco looking out of over the lake alone.
Harry folded up his shirt, "Death Eaters are basically useless without their leader. Mister No-Nose is dead, the cape boys are powerless."
The panther stared him down for a moment more before huffing and walking into the bushes, the blue light following him. Draco hummed as he trailed along behind the strange cat.
Harry walked over, standing right behind Draco, "Yeah I'm starting to think this isn't just any old muggle shop."
Harry slowly made his way towards his dorms, not in any hurry to be ignored by his roommate for the sixth day in a row.
Even though the words weren't exactly a compliment, more of a statement, Harry still felt himself blushing up at Malfoy. As he glanced at Malfoy's own eyes, Harry was enraptured. Now that he was so much closer, Harry could see that they weren't just grey they were almost silver with dark specks throughout. The boy's pupils covered more than half his iris they were so large. Harry found himself leaning in closer. Neither of them were touching the other but Harry still felt the electric sparks run around his body, the warmth now an uncomfortable heat lapping at his insides. Harry's eyes ran across Malfoy's face, landing on the boy's thin lips. Harry gazed at them, wondering what it would be like to touch them, to kiss them, to run a tongue-
Not only was his hair different, Harry noticed, but his whole wardrobe was too. The pastel boy had ill fitting robes on, and light pink earrings in his ears. When he rolled up his sleeves, the Dark Mark -a mark that Voldemort had given his followers, was gone completely, in its place laid an arrangement of flowers and what looked like writing.
I just wanted to start out by saying I'M SORRY! I struggled writing the super fluffy scenes without writing in a kiss. But I know that this kiss has to be perfect for them. And I love to keep people (including myself, apparently) on their toes. Thank you so much for reading! If you don't mind I would love to hear your thoughts on the book and where you think the story will be going! xx Maddie Leigh
As soon as Slughorn dismissed them, Harry began collecting his things. He turned towards the door, glancing at the table Draco was at, noticing that he was still there at the table. He had his head down, face towards the wall. Harry walked closer, placing his hand on the table next the boys head.
. These days, from what I have gathered, it's unheard of. With the reactions you are having towards him, the need to take care of him, he would have to be at least half-breed or more to pull this strong of a connection. Anything less than that wouldn't cause the.. electric feeling you get around him, at least not to the intensity you are describing."
Plopping down on the couch placed in the center of the room, he closed his eyes. Ever since the war ended two and a half years ago, a lot in Draco's life had changed. His father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, his mother moved to France alone, and Draco began putting every thought and emotion onto paper. He picked up playing the piano and guitar by Blaise's older brother, while rooming with him over the summer after graduation. He was able to get out of the Magic world on his own, which he was extremely proud of. He worked his ass off to get signed with a management company, and after annoying multiple different companies consistently, someone finally decided to give him a chance and he couldn’t be more grateful.
The curious look in Malfoy’s eyes, turned into one of realization as one of his hands fell to his chest, rubbing it lightly. Harry knew exactly what he was thinking in that moment. "That's where you got that spell isn't it? The one from the bathroom."
Harry grabbed Draco's shoulders, suddenly very determined to make him realized it wasn't all his fault, "You wouldn't be telling daddy no. You would be telling one of the darkest, scary looking wizards of all time no. Like I have mentioned over and over again, you were a kid. You were a seventeen year old child who was scared out of their mind. You did what any Slytherin would have done. You saved your own hide. I used to think that is extremely cowardice, and I still do to an extent, but when you are put in the situations we were put in, the choices you make can't be held against you. At least not forever."
, but simply because it was a stupid ass name. And also maybe, just a tiny bit because it was Weasley.
"Hello," He whispered softly. "I know you are scared, but don't worry, we will get you out of here and running free in no time." Draco slid one foot closer, leaning his body towards the cage. At this angle he was able to see that along with the charmed chains around the cat's body, a thicker bronze chain wrapped tightly around the cat's muscular neck. He recognized it instantly as the binding chains they use to limit a creatures' magical powers. "Thomas, you said he is powerful in more ways than one.. what exactly did you mean by that?"
A bell went off as Harry walked inside. The inside of the shop was just as confusing as the exterior. There were single lightbulbs dangling from the ceiling and weird looking things in jars set on randomly placed shelves throughout the room. In the center of the room there was a table that had books messily stacked on top of each other and artifacts hazardously placed on the stacked books. Harry walked around the table and noticed a small display case by the cash register.
Harry and Hampton rushed into the bar, hoping a good seat was still available. The room was packed to the rim, with people squeezed together like sardines.
His former therapist, as well as his mother, seem to believe his selflessness towards creatures thrives from Draco thinking his life isn't worth anything, therefore he is willing to put it on the line for other creatures. But Draco knows the true reasons on why of what he does what he does. When standing before a dangerous animal, when all of his adrenaline is pumping through his system, his mind stops. It blanks on every aspect of life besides the will to survive as well as the will to help and understand the challenging beast in front of him. Being in the presence of dangerous, often times finicky, creatures, is the only time Draco truly feels alive. No war, no past, no broken engagements, no estranged friends, no thoughts, no other worries pass through his mind when face to face with a creature. All he sees and feels and thinks about is the creature in front of him and how he can form his mind and body to allow the creatures to relax and to let Draco in to provide help. It's the thrill of an often deadly challenge.
Harry turned and began walking back the way he came from, not daring to turn around and look back at his used-to-be nemesis. He felt if he turned around and saw the brightness that seemed to live on this new Malfoy's face, he wouldn't be able to stop looking.
"I have a Dreamless Sleep and a Sleeping Draught, would you like one to help for the night?" Pansy asked.
He often thought about what it would be like to see Malfoy again. He thought he would instantly want to punch the daylights out of him, to scold him for all that has happened and all that he had done. But that's when he thought of the snotty, hollowed out Malfoy. This Malfoy that he was put on an island with by fates design was so far from the Malfoy that Harry remembered. He didn't want to punch him, to hit him, to hurt him in anyway. The man was like a walking ray of sarcastic sunshine. Harry has only held one tiny conversation- if you can even call that a conversation, with him but just from the small interaction Harry could see, no
Hampton shrugged, cutting Harry off, "You don't have to explain. I understand. Besides, it seemed to work out pretty good for you. You two look.. happy together."
"You always seem to have to focus. I remember in school you were always so focus on a very particular black haired-"
He grabbed a leaf and conjured it into a thick looking rag. The necklace still felt hot through the rag when he picked it up but it was a little more bearable. He wrapped the rag tightly around it and stuff the necklace in the pocket that was farthest from Draco, sliding his wand in the other.
An hour later, he wiped his hands on his khaki pants, and made sure his buttons on his light blue button up were all clipped before walking into La Crow.
The next hour was torture as Draco tried to drink and dance away his problems. No matter where he looked, Potter seemed to be there, snuggled up to the same man. Draco began wondering if maybe they had come here together. That first night he saw Harry at his show Harry had been with him. Thinking further though, he remembered that Harry was alone at the hotel the first time he caught sight of the black haired man. He also was alone when they ran into each other at the park. But the tall man could've just been otherwise preoccupied.
The room was dark and quite, the only light coming from the vibrate moon outside the windows. He walked over to his dresser and pulled out a night shirt and pants. Half way through getting dressed he heard movement on the bed beside his. Quickly, he threw himself under his bed-sheets, dropping his shirt onto the floor.
Today, it looked the complete opposite. It looked exactly how Draco's office often looked, tea cups and coffee mugs placed haphazardly on flat surfaces, piles of books thrown on tables, a few even thrown on the floor, open magazines spread out on Granger's desk, one of which had a deep ink stain due to the inkwell tipping over.
McGonagal nodded, and followed Pomfrey down the hall. Harry sent a longing look towards the door, but reluctantly allowed Fleur to push him away.
"You see boys, Young Harry needs that necklace. I believe who ever told you the prophesy either didn't tell you the full thing or had their own facts mixed together. Yes, the boy will cease to exist, but he will not die. Let me ask you, what do you think the gathering tonight is for?"
Harry stopped speaking and began swaying slightly, his face suddenly going lax and a little grey. He closed his eyes and took a slow, deep breath.
She laughed, "Touchy, touchy. I'm just trying to remind you that you are on an island with someone you have wanted for years. Take the risk. It's not like you are going to be stuck there with him forever."
Draco read the plaque over and over. His breathing had become easier but he was slowly getting light headed from the pure magic still flowing around him. He backed away from the tree and quickly walked away from the park. The second he stepped away from the intoxicating magic the second he felt an unadulterated amount of longing.
Draco's mouth made a 'oh' shape, before turning into the biggest grin Harry has ever seen, "Are you asking me on a date, darling?"
Harry heard a sniffle. "But, Fleur, how can I control myself? When I'm near him, when he touches me, it's like the Veela wants to take over. I have to fight it to stay calm but it keeps getting stronger. I'm afraid I might hurt him if it comes out.. I can't hurt him. Not after.. everything. I can't-" He broke off with what sounded like a sob.
Draco's eyes went wide as he stepped closer to the boy. Before he could get to the boy, Draco's vision faltered, then he was catapulted back into the dim corridor of the
Hermione's eyes seem to have glazed over slightly. "You know I love you, Harry. I love you no matter who you fancy or love or care for.. but how can- how did you get pass all the things he has done to us? To you?"
off of the use of children from the beginning and as we all got old enough to make our 'destinies' reality, the adults threw us into the shark infested waters while being drenched in blood. And the only advice they could give was to simply swim fast."
Draco shrugged. "Some people say it's childhood trauma, I say it's because even after all these year, watching Gryffindors squirm and lose their tempers is still one of my favorite pass-times."
She nodded. "Okay, I should be free Thursday, does that day work for you?” Draco nodded. “Good. Why don't we start looking into the list and see what else we can find."
Harry watched the various groups of students bounce around the courtyard with excitement for the first Hogsmead trip of the year. He had told Hermione and Malfoy to meet him right at the entrance. He was beginning to get extremely nervous as he waited for his friend and his.. new friend? He had yet to tell Hermione about Malfoy joining them. Every time he mentioned him or even spoke to him, Hermione would freeze up and clamp her jaw shut. This weekend, Harry was hoping, that maybe if he got them to hang out together they would figure out how much they had in common, because they did have
George's eyes drew closer, "Because you old diff-dimbo, after they left the store I nearly tore the place apart looking for the
With a questioning hum, Draco began taking small, tentative steps towards the caged cat. The panther's eyes tracked every movement of Draco's body, ears laying back further upon his head and sharp, glistening teeth baring with a low growl. Draco stopped when he was only a few feet away from the cage and slowly lowered himself to a squat.
"I have to go, Léon. It'll be meal time soon and I promise I would handle today's shift." Draco released the rabbits that still hung around his waist, dropping them unceremoniously into the extra metal bowl besides Léon's water dish. "I'll see you tomorrow kitty."
As he grew closer to the park, he noticed the largest tree he has ever seen in his life. It was the height of a basic oak tree, but it's trunk was so large someone could build a tiny home in it. The green leaves at the top were so bright and so densely packed, not an empty hole was in sight, that it seemed like it was hand drawn. White and yellow flowers decorated the top of the tree, snuggling against the leaves tightly.
Five weeks after the Maybelle and David debacle, Draco stood staring up at the solemn panther that sat high above him. Léon - a name chosen drunkenly and in great humor for the panther by Draco and Friends on their latest First Friday night dinner, laid in the tallest tree in the forest readily ignoring Draco and his attempts to interact with the panther.
The Ministry still barely recognizes their work - often giving the credit to the solved cases to their own official Departments, but Draco's team couldn't care less about credit as long as the animals were safe and well taken care of.
The man nodded, his hair shifting out of place, "Yes. He has shown great strength. In more ways than one." he looked around nervously, "I can't explain all until we get him out."
The same translucent-grey cloud that May and David had laid on all those weeks ago now surrounded Draco. Draco reached out a hand and gentle pushed it through the cloud. The velvety smooth smoke swirled around Draco's hand, tickling his palm. He smiled in wonder as the color of the smoke changed from translucent grey to a hazy lilac.
Harry turned his head against Draco's, pressing their foreheads together gently, "The past few years, all I have been able to think about is that I'm not safe. No matter where I was, there was always this looming voice that constantly reminded me that their are people out here that want me dead. The voice sounded a lot like Hermione if I'm being honest." He gently laughed, the breath tickling Draco's nose, "I stayed locked up in my house. I never wanted to leave because I just knew it wasn't over, and not just the Death Eaters but all of it. All the questions, all the worried looks. But I realized that it might never be fully over, and that I had to get out. So I decided on a small muggle island, hoping I would finally get a chance to be normal, to be free of everything that has happened. God, I think the creators of the universe are a bit touched in the head with the crazy shit they are constantly throwing around my life."
Thunder rolled in the distance, it had not begun to rain yet but the storm seemed to be getting closer.
Through the two and a half years he worked with the dragons, he slowly felt himself becoming addicted to the sensations of the adrenaline pumping through his body and mind every time he came close to the creatures. Addicted to the feel of their own magic flowing around Draco and his own. For the first time since the war began, he felt alive again. And he loved the feeling. Nearly five years since his first encounter with a dragon, Draco finds himself working for an un-official-official corporation, now some-what funded by the Ministry, known as
Harry looked out to the lake. He would die for Draco, he knew he would without question. He also knew that if he died, Draco would too soon after. So.. would he live for Draco? Against all odds, stay alive, stay out of harms way in order to keep Draco alive? Even with his Gryffindor sense of bravery, would he choose to stay on the side lines if things got too dangerous? At first thought, it was an instant
An hour later, both boys would be found out in the middle of the water, splashing and joking like they've been best friends for their entire lives.
Draco sighed deeply, feeling anxiety and fear creeping through his every nerve. "Yes, I'll be there all day. Please, let me know what you find."
Harry smiles and nodded. Feeling that if he didn't watch the performance Ham would continue to stare and question, he finally looked up as the song came to an end.
The song was a very upbeat anthem about letting loose and living in the moment. Harry found himself bobbing to the beat and staring at the happy-go-lucky man on the stage.
With that he began walking away from the table. Harry jumped after him crashing over him, bringing them both to the floor. They wrestled for a moment, before Harry finally was able to lock Hampton down. He held his arms above his head, straddling his hips to keep him for jerking out of this grasp, "You do not get to come at me with that and then get up and leave without an explanation!"
After being in therapy for a few months, his therapist finally persuaded him to return Malfoy's wand. Wanting it to be in a public place and to be over quickly he chose the Three Bread Sticks. The exchange was quick and very silent, only a quick thank you from Malfoy's end and an of course from Harry's. But in that small exchange it didn't seem like any words really needed to be exchanged. That day when Harry saw Malfoy for the first since the trails, he looked hollow. Like any life that once was in the body in front of him had disappeared. The boy was so skinny you could see his ribs through his too big for him muggle T-Shirt. His hair was loose and growing longer than Harry has ever seen on Malfoy. Dark circles were found under his eyes and his already sharp-edged bones seemed to have gotten ever sharper. It was as if Malfoy's body was the personalized version of what the war had done.
The two students walked to the far end of the table casually, slipping in next to what looked like Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. The conversations slowly came back up, softer than it was before, but Harry couldn't focus on anything but the boy.
Draco's eyes got big as he realized what the cat was doing. He quickly drew his wand, but a shock went right through his wand hand and he had no choice but to sit watching his only chance for a painless fall fall down to the bushes below.
Draco groaned. "Pansy, this is more than worry, there is a child who is more than likely being abused as we speak, did Blaise find anything?"
The walls in the dorm, much like the common room, were light tan bricked. Dark wood poster-beds lined in a circle against the wall, each one was completed with a tan duvet, three pillows, and a chest at the foot of the bed. Next to all the beds were a darker wooden wardrobe on one side and a nightstand on the other.
He picked up his phone, pressing Hermione's name, hoping she will pick up in spite of how late it was over there.
By the time Harry got down to breakfast, his mind had made up more questions than even Rita Skeeter could possibly ask, and he was so hungry he could have eaten a whole Basilisk. Just to prove his case, he had third helpings of toast and eggs.
Draco looked up at him for a split second and then turned away, trying to back away, but Harry had his body angled in a way that had Draco stuck between him and the wall. Harry couldn't quite place why he cared
Léon's head fell down, looking ashamed of himself. He looked up at Draco and took a step toward him, and then another, and then another until they were face to face with each other. He leaned his head close to Draco's and then his tongue darted out and licked a hot, wet streak up Draco's face.
Harry rolled his eyes as he dropped the fly back onto the plate, "Oh har-har. Keep it up and I'm going to shove my foot into your mouth."
That's why he decided to come here. To get away from his past, his friends' worried looks, the constant questions. He just wanted to get away from it all, to relax, to just be anything he wants without any repercussions. But clearly the universe had something completely different in mind for him. He really hated the universe.
"Potter, darling," Parkinson drawled, "You have no idea. Nearly eight years of it. It was horrible. Now, we know why at least. Maybe now he will talk less about you because he will be so busy snogging you."
"They were pretty fun sometimes, but most of the time they almost ended with all three of us dying. I think that's why he would give us points like that. Every year it seemed like something was trying to kill me or hurt me and we all were usually able to stop whatever it was, even though we were just children. It's crazy to look back now and think about everything we have been through together. How
"It's alright. I completely understand. Over the years, I know I have torn you down, Granger, I know that and I could never show nor tell you just how sorry I am about it. And I know there is nothing I could ever say or do to earn your forgiveness, and I'm not asking for it. But I really am sorry for all I have done and said to both you and about your family and your boyfriend and your cat."
Two Months ago, he would have assumed the sour face Malfoy had on his face was a yearly thing. No matter where or who he was with, Harry thought his face would stay the same. He quickly, as their friendship began to grow closer, realized his mistakes.
He suddenly realized that Harry wasn't the only one looking at him. He looked in between Harry and Draco before keeping his eyes on Draco, placing his body slightly in front of Harry, "Hi, you are Draco Malfoy right?" Draco nodded, "Well you sounded amazing, really. I heard you were staying here till for a few more days?" -another nod- "Well, if you are interested this Sunday is a founding families reunion and we would love to have you perform."
Looking out of the small café's window, Hampton let out a deep sigh, wishing that Founder meetings didn't have to always take place in the dead of night.
As he handed Harry the stone Harry asked, "So what does the stone have to do with the story? How would the stone help me 'find my way'?"
Draco Malfoy slowly shuffled into the hotel's breakfast lounge, making a cup of tea and a big serving of eggs and bagels. Once his plate was made, he looked around the unusually packed room. Every other morning he has gotten to the room right at opening so he could have the place all to himself. Due to the decent amount of alcohol he consumed the night prior, he was a little behind on his normal morning routine.
Harry leaned over Draco to see the two girls sitting right across from them. Ginny was sat just as Harry was, with Luna sitting nearly in her lap, playing with her fingers.
He heard a shuffle. "Yes, and have you looked at what happens to them when there mate is denied? It doesn't end well. For either parties."
After Harry took few shallow breaths to slow his heart, he pushed his blanket away and slipped off his bed, shivering slightly at the coldness of the wooden floors as he crossed the quiet, dark dorm room and headed to the restrooms.
The next few days were spent in quiet observation and complete confusion for Harry, even more than they usually were. Draco - yes, his mind seemed to be adamant about referring to the blue-haired boy as such -  seemed to be ignoring him. He has caught glimpses of the boy on multiple occasions dodging around corridors and into classroom just to not have to be in the presence of Harry. Even in classes they shared, Draco stays far away from him, refusing to even glance his way. In their rooms, he left before anyone got up and went to bed after everyone was asleep. It was beginning to agitate Harry to no end.
They walked down the pier as Draco explained everything, only stopping when people came within ear shot. Which wasn't very often seeing as most people were smart enough to stay home while a big storm was approaching.
Harry turned towards the boy that still has yet to look up from his text book, "Hey, are you alright?"
They rode in silence for a mile or two before the man spoke up again, "Coming from up North of the island it looks to be some sort of storm. Hopefully it isn't anything too drastic. About a week ago we had a storm come through that nearly killed our Ol' Howler. Have you heard about Her?"
Draco Malfoy smiled as the crowd cheered. He placed one hand on his mic while the other one softly held his guitar, "Thank you! Thank you very much." He waved as he walked off of the stage.
Luckily, no other magical incident has happened since that first night. The cat occasionally uses his gifts to move objects or trip Draco as he walks around the jungle, but besides that no one would ever know that the panther had any form of magical energy at all.
"We can't know for certain.. he arrived around the same time as the other man. Both seem to harbor great talent." Kenneth Trade answered.
He loved that his friends cared and appreciated them wanting to keep him safe. He understood why they were so adamant on keeping him closer. When someone you care about has had their life threatened every year since you have known them, one comes to want to protect that person. He feels the same things about them.  But it's been almost 3 years since the war has ended, it was time to let loose at least some of the fear. They all still have the nightmares and never venture far from their wands, but life has been good. They all have new exciting lives. Ron is with George running the shop, Hermione is climbing her way towards being the Minister of Magic, and they have a gorgeous one year old daughter.
After Hermione had dropped the bomb about the little girl being Fleur's little sister, Harry began searching more to see if it was true. With a closer glance, he began seeing the resemblance, with further digging he found that it truly was Fleur's sister. Since that day after potions, Harry hasn't gotten the chance to properly talk to Hermione about that situation nor the Malfoy one. He was a little glad he hasn't be able to yet because he is still on the fence about whether he should mention his Malfoy situation and about Fleur being in their room the first day of the semester or not. Seeing as Draco and the girl seemed intertwined, he figured he would have to tell her.
Harry sat throwing daggers at the man. His tone was way too flirty, his eyes were way too dreamy and Harry wanted them off of his boyfriend's form immediately.
Pansy pushed her bottom lip out into a pout, "Do we have to? Isn't it good enough that we aren't killing him?"
He has had many revelations over the years, but this one hits him like a rocket every time. Multiple nights has he sat on stage, guitar in hand, in awe at this incredible life.
wouldn't even look at me today and I was wearing my most expensive cloak. I bet he couldn't even tell the difference between Twilfitt and Malkins'"
Draco looked out at the crowd, catching a set of dazzling green eyes that stood right off the right side of the stage. He tried to keep his eyes on everyone to make sure nothing strange was happening but every time his eyes floated back to Harry’s.
The introductions were like every other year, list of rules that never ended, have a great year, eat up. The only difference was that this year, there was no sorting hat, nor the looming presence of Lord Voldemort. Instead, every person got a room number that they will be sharing with five other students from their year.
Look, look, I know it’s been like … forever. And I know this isn’t as long as I normally have been posting. But LISTEN life has been a train wreck lol. Pandemic, two major hurricanes destroyed my home in the matter of weeks, insane ice storm (insane for where I live), and having to move houses constantly while also working two jobs and trying to apply for jobs in my field of work…  so you can say I have a LOT going on lol.
Granger huffed. "It has nothing to do with Ron - and don't call him that." She turned her Marguise cut wedding ring back and forth on her finger. "Of course I can distance myself from.. personal issues while working, Draco. I know you are unfamiliar with the concept but some of us know how to be professional."
Draco shrugged, his shoulder lightly rubbing Harry's, "I do but since the war it's not the same. Mother shut herself off and stopped talking to majority of her friends and family, me included most of the time. Father is in Azkaban were I hope he will stay till the day he dies. I talked to Pansy almost everyday and Blaise is there if I need him but it's not the same. None of us have heard from Gregory since he left. Apparently him and Crabbe were much closer than we thought."
He jerked back, nearly falling out of this chair. A smooth, slim hand grabbed his thigh tighter, as another one pushed at his back, righting him back into the chair.
Draco rolled his eyes and grabbed the bagel in Harry's hand, switching it for the one he had on his plate, "Happy now?"
But here, in potions, a class Harry needed but was currently failing, the obsession was bringing itself to the surface more than it ever did before. Instead of listening to his professor, all Harry could pay attention to was the brush of Draco's leg against his own. Instead of reading the board and writing what he would need for today's potion, all he could do was pretend he wasn't staring at Draco Malfoy next to him.
Harry sat at a desk all the way in the back of the library staring out the window, watching as rain poured from the sky, creating tiny ponds throughout the grassy fields. No matter what he did, he couldn't get Draco out of his mind. He honestly
that claws at me and every-time we get close it fights harder and I don't know if I can control it.." Harry stomped over to Draco, the Slytherin threw himself against the wall, "Harry, what ever you are doing stop."
Léon began pacing by the ponds side, shaking his head every other step. Draco's heart began breaking for the distraught creature in front of him.
