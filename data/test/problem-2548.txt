whispered a stubborn voice. Dawlish might be able to call him away from Harry, but he’d never have the nerve to invade the Saviour’s bedroom.
Zabini's eyes opened slowly and reluctantly. He sank a hand into Malfoy's hair and held him in place. Malfoy moaned around the wet cock in his mouth and Harry filed that reaction away—Malfoy got off on that. Good to know.
“You’ve remembered then, have you, Harry?”
"So who won? Or lost?" Harry wasn't sure how he should put it. "I mean, who is it?"
“Hundreds of them, all set to receive only, or I would have been back years ago. Lots of the old pureblood families toss their waste through Vanishing Cabinets. No messing about with Muggle-style bins for them. That’s how I scrounged enough food to stay alive. Any cabinet without a properly connected twin defaults to Crap Land.”
Dawlish smiled. “He’s alive. For now.”
The name tears through him like a shot. Hogwarts, a place Padfoot knows. A place where there was Pack, a forest, there was Moony and Prongs and—
Of course, he didn't know the new Slytherin password either.
By the time he'd pulled himself out of a fantasy of blond hair, pouty mouth gone thick with drool, and enticing gag noises coming from the back of that over-entitled prick's mouth, the wand was already slowing down.
Filch shuffled next to her. "It's not a bad idea, ma'am. I got nowhere else to put them, excepting you want to bed 'em down in the Great Hall but where we'd all be eating then I couldn't say. Can't be moving beds in and out of there every night, not to mention keeping it warm with winter coming on would be the very devil. There's nowhere else, not and keep them all together."
Dawlish ignored him. He pulled out a small vial, misty with a captured memory, and poured it into the pensieve. He looked at Draco, dropped the smile, and waved at the silvery water. “After you.”
Widley popped back in, two covered bowls in her hands with spoons somehow balanced on top. "Mr. Harry Potter, sir!  Here is you having your dinner, it being beginning with the soup course, which tonight is a squashed pumpkin creamed and well-seasoned."
Draco drew another shuddering breath and uncurled himself. Slughorn’s large, heavy hands were gripping his arms now, tugging him upward. Draco managed to get his feet underneath him and rise shakily to something resembling half-standing.
“It seems the Veil doesn’t kill you when you fall through it,” he said. “It dumps you in a…”  He paused, shaking his head in a way that reminded Harry of Padfoot. “In a dump,” he finished, sounding uncertain. “It’s like a… it’s all misty. A vast, endless, misty dump. Total crap place to live, but at least there weren’t any Dementors.”
A cultured voice came from the doorway. "Ah, I see you two are communicating as well as ever."
“But Draco told me the two of you were off to Malfoy Manor to get a few things he wanted.”
Draco let out the breath he didn't know he'd been holding. Blaise had been good to him. It was an offer Draco could beat.
“You want to teach me how to suck you off?” Harry asked again.
Harry slipped into an alcove as Hermione walked by, nose still pressed to her Arithmancy book. He eased out then poked his head into the classroom.
"Lucius made Malfoy bent so he couldn't get a girl up the duff? So Lucius could control who inherited the Malfoy estate?" Weird, bad feelings whirled inside Harry.
Thanks to everyone who's reading along with us! If you're enjoying this fic, please let us know!
Hermione sniffed. "Of course. I should have guessed." She held up a hand. "No more details. What I don't know, I don't have to tell Professor McGonagall."
Sirius put his hand on Remus’s leg. “We won’t leave the house,” he said, a slow grin lighting his eyes.
“Yes! He-- all right, fine. I may have slightly overreacted to some of his actions.”
, Draco was ready to go. If only his heart didn’t ache.
"Charms for girls, you mean. There aren't any that are particularly effective for males, or that don't have horrendous side-effects at any rate. An inch-thick pelt of brown fur, for instance." Zabini gave a little unamused smile, still not looking at Harry. "Except for one. It's more than a charm, of course. Many people consider it Dark Arts."
Remus had continued on and Harry tuned back in as Remus was saying, “Voldemort used us to intimidate and terrify. Unfortunately his methods didn’t die with him as thoroughly as we hoped. Yes, I’ve had reports of werewolves being used against their will to threaten other prisoners in Azkaban. Unfortunately, we haven’t been able to catch anyone in the act of doing it. Though it wouldn’t surprise me, at this point it’s still just rumors.”
Except—
Except there seemed to be something up ahead. Draco squinted and kept moving. There was a darkness, a solidity off to the right and he steered toward it. As he came closer, it resolved into an archway set into broken stone, like it had been ripped from the side of an ancient abbey and plonked down here. Fluttering curtains hung from the arch, obscuring what was on the other side.
Father explained it was Draco's fault. If you interfere with the natural hierarchy, it only makes things worse, he'd said. The little puppy should have been learning his place, not getting food it hadn't earned.
Nev grunted at that first touch and spread his legs a little wider. Harry gave it a tentative stroke, up then down, and Nev jerked beneath him. A feeling of power rushed through Harry, heady and strong and arousing. He stroked again, harder this time, and Nev gave a little moan and pushed up into Harry's fist. A bead of moisture smeared across his hand: pre-come, already leaking from the tip.
“I do love you, Draco. I love you, I love you, and I—”
"I wanted a fair chance to win. Not a guaranteed loss! You wanted to use me! You wanted everyone to use me!" He felt stupid, childish, whingey as he said it, which wasn't fair, because he had every right to complain about this. More than a right—an obligation. Someone had to stand up to the twins when they had gone too far.
He stunned an official looking merman, pushed off a rooftop, and swam with every particle of strength he had. The closer he got to the cabinet, the easier it was--he was being sucked in, he realized, as surely as if he was being poured down a drain. One last kick of his nearly exhausted legs and he was slamming forward into the cabinet, eyes nearly blinded by its strong blue glow. He raised a hand, unable to convince his body that he wasn't just going to brain himself on the rear of the cabinet.
“Again,” Harry panted. Water lapped around his chest, silky smooth. “Expelliarmus,” they said in one voice, and the pinprick hole in the Veil opened further, widening now to mousehole size. The charmed water poured through it, fraying further at its edges, then with a whoosh the entire Veil gave way. They tumbled out, swept forward on a wave, and landed tangled together on the stone floor.
Ron pulled his legs up and sat cross-legged on the bed, leaning forward. "I don't know exactly what they did but Harry, remember our boggarts? Your greatest fear came from something a Dementor did to you. My greatest fear came from something the
"Yeah? So?" Another pump-pump of Neville's cock, half-heartedly.
Anger layered on top of incomprehension. Harry balled up fistfuls of leather, sinking his fingernails through the traces of motorcycle grease. “How could you think that about Sirius?” burst out, loud and fierce. “He loved you!”
“Magic contract, I said, right? We snitched one of the originals they really used and there’s a nasty little clause in there about non-compliance—“
“Yeah.”
Draco's cock was suddenly so hard it hurt. His trousers rubbed painfully with every jerking motion Draco made. Fuck, no, he couldn't come from this. If there was anything worse than having to suck off Marcus while everyone watched him, graded him, judged him, it would be having them see how much it turned him on.
To Draco’s astonishment, a broad grin broke out across Potter’s face. Had the git gone completely mad? Well, that would explain the recent turn their relationship seemed to have taken.

Draco grit his teeth and tried to still his trembling hands. If Dawlish saw he was afraid, it would make everything worse. Maybe the key would still work, despite the fact that its emerald had come off in the fire. Or maybe he could tell Dawlish that the Grimoire wouldn’t open until after Dawlish had kept his promise and released Father from the werewolf. Or maybe he could offer Dawlish some other kind of favor, maybe--
over and over again. He couldn’t calm himself and it was all the apple’s fault. It was a shit meditation focus because he hated those trees and their stupid poison apples that lured you in by looking like they’d taste so sweet and be so healthy. They weren’t: one bite and you’d fall down dead, to fertilize the soil with your rotting corpse.
"Don't stop, please." The bedsheets shifted and pulled underneath them. Nev must be fisting his hands in them. "Fuck. Luna. Fuck, I'm going to—"
He kept his face schooled into that perfect blend of haughty and bored that kept you safe in the Slytherin common room. Sooner or later they all learned to give nothing away--no enthusiasm that could be mocked, no desire that could be thwarted, no need that could be leveraged. Stay smooth and hard and be the rock that the tide washes over and for godsakes, don't let anyone see that you're absolutely, suddenly heartsick.
"No, Potter. Air cannot apparate in. Just like we can't apparate out." Malfoy let the fake bright look go out. "Which is why we're going to die."
“I didn’t mean--”
"I can!" Potter lit up, laughing too. "Her portrait is in the entryway and even in paint she's unbelievably awful. We put curtains over her to shut her up but she keeps finding ways to open them. It's awfully embarrassing having people over when you know your artwork is going to shriek at them."
“Stay here,” Harry said, climbing free of the bench. “Both of you. Stay together, and just—don’t disappear, or go anywhere, Sirius, stay right here with Remus. I’m— I have to— I’ll be back soon.”
"We're safe, shhh," Harry said, feeling stupid and guilty and more wet than he'd ever been. He flopped all the way back, unable to even sit, and Malfoy slid down next to him, practically blue in the face. Harry hauled him on top and started rubbing his back, worried, feeling Malfoy's too-thinness and the cold that had seeped so deeply into him that the dungeon stone seemed almost warm in comparison.
“You have no fucking idea what I have to do.” Malfoy took a step toward Harry, his wand raised threateningly. “Now for the last time Potter: will you sod the fuck off, or do I have to hex your sorry arse?”
“And?” Ron raised one eyebrow, waiting for Harry to go on.
Water rumbled again behind the entrance to the dorm. Her eyes twitched in that direction. "I hesitate to surmise where it might have gone. I hesitate to ask what may have transpired. And yet, such are the demands of my position that I must do just that."
I’ll do anything to free my father, he meant to say. But the words stuck in his throat. Would he really do anything?
Potter pulled out his wand, tapped it on his own pillow, and did an Aguamenti. Water poured out, maybe a cupful or so before Potter turned it off. Draco gaped, confused, but removed his shoes and climbed on the bed too.
Harry looked self-consciously down at Neville, who did seem a bit uncomfortable and confined. Still, Harry couldn't give Malfoy the satisfaction of knowing he was right. "You're fine, aren't you Neville?"
Kudos to Maesterchill for the ongoing beta!
“Wait,” Harry said. “Vanishing cabinets?” His skin prickled all over.
Actually, Professor Sprout had smiled kindly and said she didn’t want Draco to get hurt, so best they did this part together, right love? Draco remembered it distinctly. It had been the first kind smile he’d gotten since returning to Hogwarts and it had, horrifically, made his eyes well up with tears. Sprout had pretended not to notice, which had earned her whatever portion of Draco’s undying love the smile hadn’t already earned. “There’s nothing for the kitchen in there, sir. It’s really not part of my—”
Remus spread his hands, conciliating. “I think I spent those twelve years fighting with Sirius in my head.  I’d have been better off talking with him face to face, just once.”
She turned to go. "I'll have your trunk sent up. Ron will be along later. He's who you'll want to share with, I figured."
Then he heard it. The sound of something different from the endless murmur of longing. A rhythmic thumping sound. Someone running?
A thin line of light shot out of his wand. It hit the edge and shimmered wetly, like glue. The Cabinet shifted forward, sticking to the Veil. Draco raised his wand—up, then across, then down again, sealing the Cabinet entirely to the Veil.
He swayed, took a few unsteady steps forward onto the garden's gravel path, and collapsed on his hands and knees, his head roaring and empty except for a single word.
“You’re my cousin,” Draco said stupidly.
“Expelliarmus!”
And then Potter was rolling away from Draco and raising himself up on one elbow. The fond look on his face had turned into a frown.
“We did Harry a favor.” The other twin’s head appeared beside his brother’s. This twin must be Fred, Harry realized, because the left side of his jaw was swollen where Harry had punched him the day before.  Fred reached out and hit Ron on the side of the head. “Don’t mind this wanker,” he said to Harry. “He’ll come round. Just because
Potter steadied, caught himself on a bedpost, and flung himself back toward Draco with a happy bellow. He grabbed a fistful of shirt and Draco braced himself to be shoved back. Instead he felt himself hauled in and then they were tumbling together on the rug. Coarse wool swiped the side of his face as they wrestled, hands grappling, legs intertwined, each trying to pin the other.
wants the cabinet brought here. You don't want to upset the great Harry Potter, do you?"
Draco thought desperately. But his eyes were burning, his throat was closing. If he opened his mouth he might sick up all over the common room floor.
But Potter--no,
Malfoy? Harry licked his lips and grabbed an underwater plant to hold himself in place, wrapping it around his waist to free his hands to touch the glass. He pulled himself closer with a little sticky charm on his fingers and—yes—he could see perfectly into a Slytherin dorm room. Five beds, all draped in emerald green, lit by silver lanterns hanging from a stone ceiling.
“Fair daughter of the moon won’t put out?” Fred sniggered.
Malfoy screamed. A line of fire arced across his trousers, a fiery silhouette of the snake’s burning body.
At one point, he must have been a fine, imposing dog, with silky black fur and soulful grey eyes. Now all that fur was bedraggled, dirt-smeared and knotted, beyond saving by even the most clever of groomers. Worse, underneath the tangled mass, Draco could feel the poor thing's ribs. "What have you been eating, you great brute?" Draco asked softly. "Have you been here long?"
Pansy would most likely still be at dinner, but there was a chance Blaise might have come back early—he liked to shower after dinner, Draco knew. With any luck he'd be in the Slytherin common room, drying his hair by the fire. But even if he were, Draco realized, he wouldn't be able to so much as raise his head and look at Blaise, not if anyone else was about. To show a face that desperately needed comfort in the Slytherin common room was as good as signing his own death warrant. The safest thing to do would be to keep his head down and go straight to his room and get in bed and spell the curtains shut. He prayed no one else was already in there.
Beside them Potter was pushing himself up too and there might have been a flicker of disappointment when Draco pulled away. Hope flared suddenly—had Potter liked being wrapped around him?—but before it could take root, Draco stomped it flat, ruthlessly. He'd already spent far, far too much of his life mooning over The Boy Who Lived. Pansy would kill him if she had to suffer through another round of let's-pash-on-Potter.  The kiss hadn't meant anything. It was just the kind of thing that happened when you thought you were about to die.
, a voice whispered inside him.  A tendril of excitement twisted at the thought, much as he wanted to squash it. If Malfoy got picked, then there was no denying he liked blokes as much as Harry did. It was as good as Veritaserum as far as this particular question went and oh, Harry desperately wanted to know the answer.
“Christ, Malfoy.” Harry dropped lower on his elbows, his mouth coming to rest by Draco’s ear. “Say that again and I’ll come right now. Jesus.” He laughed, a soft, sex-drunk huff, and then took a few deep breaths, obviously trying to last longer.
“Anything. Any way you want it.”
He barreled through the door, trying not to think about the worst part of it. They must have been laughing at him from the beginning--must have snickered themselves sick with every cock he sucked. How could they do that to him?
“Are slippery. Yes, that’s the meaning of the word ‘lube,’ in case you didn’t know. Don’t tell me the whole of Gryffindor tower wanks dry.”
Had he actually just told Harry Potter to put a finger up his arse? Draco braced himself, waiting for the disgusted reply.
Remus raised his head. Even in the candlelight, Harry could see that he looked terrible.
See you next Saturday!
"You got exactly what you wanted and we know it," George stepped closer too, moving to the side so Harry was nearly between the two of them, "because that's how the contract worked, Harry."
Remus turned back as he reached the door. “Would you like to come downstairs and have some tea?”
"Your things have already been moved back there," said the boy, moving to stand next to his friend.
"I mean, Draco here, as you can see, quite loves cock. As do you."
Malfoy's face darkened as the silence stretched. "Come to supervise? Make sure I don't slip poison into the pasta?"
“Look at how he shakes.” Dawlish watched dispassionately as Father quivered, ghostly pale against the dark stone wall. “How many long full moon nights do you think he can manage to stay standing?” He turned and looked at Draco. “Dead or turned? You didn’t say which you thought your father would prefer but how about yourself? Which would you rather for him?”
Draco suddenly thought. He tried to chase the thought away with other thoughts, happy memories of times he'd spent here. Mother, in the rose garden. Swimming with Greg and Pansy in the lake. Sleeping in a hammock underneath the stars in the summertime. All outside memories, he realized, and tried again to find happiness that he'd felt within the Manor's walls. It was there, of course, but all of it seemed touched with despite rather than because. He didn't have to love this place, he suddenly realized. He didn't have to live in this place. That gut-level realization made it almost easy to breathe again, despite the thick air. All the years of trying to convince himself that he had to love the Manor fell away, replaced by the simple truth that it fucking terrified and disgusted him. That was who he was. Someone who wanted to live in a fucking clean, high-ceilinged, London flat with furniture that was younger than he was. With Harry.
It was Nott, the last person he wanted to see right now. Draco held his breath, a fleeting wish for Harry's invisibility cloak bubbling up inside him, then plummeting into the ache for Harry himself.
Potter gave a shy smile and finished unbuttoning. He shrugged his shirt off his shoulders and held the chocolate up. "Here. You missed dinner. It's all I've got to offer."
“We had to get out of there.” Harry shook his head, trying to clear the disorienting after-effects of Apparition from his foggy brain.
Draco tensed. He’d learned to be wary of men who wanted to take him to places where no one else could see what they did to him. Dawlish had never seemed that type and a Flesh-Eaters’ Garden hardly seemed a good ambiance for that kind of thing but—
Frankly Draco didn't either. Not yet. But he would. He was smart and determined and he'd use this to find a way to keep Father safe. Make Father proud of him. He'd kept himself and cousin Luna safe last year this way and he might have done it on his knees but still, wasn't that an accomplishment? Not on the level of killing a Dark Lord, of course. But wasn't it something?
Draco shook his head. “Listen. I mean. I want….”
Draco opened his mouth, swallowed Marcus down, and heard him cry out again and again, as come pulsed across his tongue. That sound went right to his cock, made him want to shove his hand in his own pants and come hard while his lips were wet and slicked.
“No.” Harry set down the cup and raised his wand again. “I mean, yes, but not just you. We should do it together, at the same time.”
As always, comments, kudos and recs keep us going and are *deeply* appreciated!
He needed a little more experience and the problem with experience was that you had to, well, experience it. With other people. Which was clearly never going to happen again because his dorm-mates were freakish celibates who unwilling to take advantage of him. The berks.
"That's them fixed, then, isn't it?" said the one who surely was George. He had a slightly softer lilt to his voice and if he had turned, the look in his eye, before he fucked Harry six ways to Sunday, would have been a little more apologetic than Fred's.
Finally Dawlish paused before the gate to the one part of the garden they hadn’t seen. He looked inside. “No elves in there?”
Draco's head buzzed. There was a pleading tone to Potter's voice, like he'd found a puppy and was begging to take it home—
Potter's eyes narrowed and he finally stepped into the room. His magic crackled a little stronger, though if anything it seemed to be directed at Greg, not Draco.
"Anyway, there's no need to look as glum as all that." Fred turned suddenly and waved a hand at the twin cabinets. "We haven't got time to take advantage of you, not that you're not a darling little crumpet all waiting to be bathed in our best butter. It's just we've got—"
"Potter?"
"I have an idea," he said, forcing himself to pull away, panting. "See? Letting me take a break from thinking worked perfectly. We can--"
and offering a hand up to the doll in the bed, who was swinging her hard wax legs over the edge of the bed—
Deeper still and his arms were tiring and his ears popping when he finally saw a light up ahead. The token tugged excitedly—that had to be his destination. He kicked a little harder, forcing some more cooperation out of numbed legs, and his heart sped up as he realized where he was.
"Please, please tell me you have never done that before," Dean said. Still, he wrapped his other arm around Harry's chest and held him tight and ready.
Draco tried not to imagine what Dawlish might have done to Father to get even that much information. Father would never give up family secrets lightly. “Yes?”
Nev let out an unhappy sound. "Er—"
But even if he wasn’t dead yet, that didn’t mean he couldn’t die in here. The mist felt chillier as Draco thought about it. Was he stuck here? Maybe death did wait in here, a slow one, dying alone from hunger and thirst. Maybe the arch was a piece of ancient wizarding justice, the place where the guilty were literally cast out into the ‘undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveler returns.’ Ha. He bet Harry thought Draco didn’t know any Shakespeare, Squib that the man had been, but Mother had loved old William the Bard and quoted him often. Mother. Should he have written to her before leaping into the cabinet? No—he didn’t think he regretted that. It would have been terrible to make her choose between her husband and her son, and Mother had had enough terrible choices recently. Better to have made that decision himself.
“It’s not exactly Mr. Love,” Harry pushed his wand across the desk, impatient to be let through. Of course, he thought as he watched Minch tag and register it, it wasn’t ever going to be Ms. Love, now was it? So that part of it was right, even if it had taken a massive sex-prank on the part of the twins for him to realize it. “I mean, there’s not a particular person called Mr. Love who I have an appointment with.”
Draco took the hand Harry held out to him, then moved past, tugging him up towards the exit. He cast a worried look at the Cabinet. “I don’t think that cup of yours means to stop until this place is underwater.”
Harry’s eyes were shining, his mouth swollen and wet, his cheeks flushed.
Theo slid back in his chair and did a good job of looking arrogantly relaxed. "No offense, Greg, but I think I'm worth a little more than you. Two sucks per person per week. One, if you want it enthusiastic. No more than ten minutes per suck—no drawing it out, you wankers. I know what a bunch of bastards you are."
Harry stepped into the grove of trees, following the lilt of the surprisingly tuneful whistle, not that he recognized the song. Something old and sad, it sounded, and maybe it was just as well there weren't any words to go with it. Long pale strands trailed from the trees above, swaying in the breeze, and looking for all the world like dangling spaghetti. Knowing Hogwarts, Harry decided, they probably were.
Draco stepped through the front door, into the echoing marble foyer now riddled with cracks. Go straight to the laundry, the Auror had said, which he would, if he had any idea where it was. When he was growing up, laundry was done by house elves; dirty things disappeared and came back clean, that was all he'd known. It wasn't as if he had ever wanted to visit his dirty sheets while they were off getting scrubbed—why would he know where it was done?
, he told himself, and kept moving until his lips were pressing against Ron's.
to do was crawl into a hole, pull his knees up to his chest, wrap his arms around them, and fall over sideways. If he was lucky, he'd freeze solid sometime around December. Maybe they'd even let Father out for the funeral.
Harry kicked the sheets further down. "Get in the bed, Neville. Now."
"When your room-mates come back," Harry said, after a moment more of thought, "they won't be able to open the door either. They'll call for help and someone will get us out."
"I'll show you bollocks," Potter said, his lips curling up in a smile against Draco's neck.
“Draco Malfoy?” Sirius asked. “That boy was Draco Malfoy?” Why would— Harry, what’s going on?”
"But there has to be a way to reverse it. For when they find an acceptable girl. When they want to marry off their heir."
Someone was watching him. The two Aurors from earlier, their long moonlit shadows falling across the gravel path. Come to witness his humiliating defeat, of course.
Potter blinked at him, waiting. His eyes without his glasses looked large and unfocused, oddly vulnerable.
Then Remus’s hand was on his back too, Remus guiding them together towards the table where the chairs obligingly transformed themselves into a wide bench they could all sit on together, still holding on to one another. Sirius was murmuring soothing things, something in between English and a dog’s protective growl, something that came deep from the chest and rumbled with love. Finally, finally, Harry was able to dry his face and catch his breath and ask, in a hoarse voice, “How?”
"One moment," he whispered, holding up a finger because his throat was so constricted he could barely hear himself speak.
For several minutes all Harry could do was cry, his head buried on Sirius’s shoulder while Sirius held him, the fingers of one hand digging into Harry’s back, the other hand tenderly stroking his hair.
Relief washed over him, followed close on its heels by another anxiety. Ron wouldn't make Harry suck him, would he? Why not, an annoyingly honest voice in the back of his brain said, you would have done it to him. Then it started pulling out snapshot memories: Ron in the shower, Ron getting dressed after Quidditch, Ron wanking under the covers and not even trying to be quiet because he didn't know how shite his
Draco thought wildly.
Comments and feedback always deeply appreciated--and they keep the words flowing!
Zabini stared at him. “Of course he didn’t. The other half’s under the lake. Draco--oh, Merlin.” Zabini’s face went slack as he stared at Harry. Harry could almost see the equations whirring in Zabini’s mind, calculating the variables, weighing the probabilities. “What happened between you two at Malfoy Manor?” he asked.
“You don’t have to suck him off at all, that’s what I’m trying to tell you!”
Blaise raised an eyebrow. Maybe he just meant to make Draco laugh--it helped at any rate, dispelling the remaining panic even better than the calming potion had. “I can’t imagine anything I’d be less able to cope with at this moment than an infant,” Draco finally answered.
say he needs to be made right. Don't you dare tell him that he's wrong the way he is."
Harry didn't know what he was feeling for but he certainly knew when he found it. McLaggen stiffened and swore.
Remus nodded as he sorted the sugar and the milk, waiting for the real question, which obviously wasn’t where he worked. “Is there something you wanted to know?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Before he could get there, footsteps rang on the stairs. The word 'cocksucker' had barely been hushed before Hermione was poking her head in the room.
But McLaggen was helpfully sliding forward until his arse was just off the bed, his cock bumping up against Harry's face. McLaggen's hips were tilted up and Harry was sure his finger was meant to go in the arsehole.
His face reddened as he thought about it, there in the dark with the curtains closed and the sound of snoring filling the air. Maybe he'd been the only one who'd taken it seriously because he was the only one who really wanted to do it. Maybe—and here was a horrible thought—everyone had noticed that he'd been a little keen on the idea. Maybe they were out there laughing about how Harry was hoping to suck some cocks. Whispering about how they knew he'd wanted that all along.
. Draco mouthed it to himself, still unable to believe it. Harry had said it with words, he’d said it with actions, he’d said it with the tip of his finger, the one that had been inside Draco, drawing the shape of a heart on Draco’s back before they fell asleep.
And then—nothing. Draco had drawn his wand and said the incantation, then climbed into the Vanishing Cabinet, closing the door behind him. He’d felt for the back wall and found only empty space, so he’d taken a step forward. Still no wall. So he’d taken another step, and another, and suddenly he was falling forward into the nothingness. He’d braced himself for water, for the cold, and taken what he thought was his last breath, all the while wondering if it wasn’t the stupidest thing on earth, to breathe in deeply right before you drowned. It would only prolong the agony, but then again, hadn’t that been Draco’s modus operandi his entire life? A little more life, at any cost of pain or honor, and where had it brought him but here in the end?
"You don't know how the BJ-giver was really picked." Ron patted Harry's leg. "You know it wasn't really random, mate. You've figured that much out, right?"
"Make me?" Draco said, which was much smarter because it was only two words and it saved his breath for wrestling. He was losing—Potter had gotten broad and muscled sometime in the last year—but Draco had too much pride to go down easily. "You don't have the bollocks for it."
He stared down at his tea, feeling, for the first time, a flicker of understanding of Draco’s behavior. What had Draco said?
"Password?" she asked.
Zabini looked like he might sick up. “He thought about it once. Right after the war. Pansy and I made him promise--bloody fucking hell, Potter, what did you do to him? What the fuck did you do to him?”
But there wasn't. "See," Seamus was telling Dean. "You just push right here." He dug his thumb into a spot just below Harry's ear.
Draco considered for a moment but he already knew what he really wanted to ask. "How did you inherit the old Black place? The one in London. I've never been able to figure that out."
"Semper sursum," he said, trying last week's password, and for a moment he thought it had worked. The portrait swung open--but it was just a couple of second-year Gryffindors. They goggled up at him as they climbed out, then edged around him as if he were made of evil and any touch would turn them evil too.
"Do I have your vote?" Draco touched the tip of his tongue to Marcus's cock, just enough to tease. Not enough to put him over the edge.
Sirius grinned right back and took a long swallow of tea, biscuit and all. “Not to mention that you stink like a distillery. What have you been getting up to, Moony?”
It had taken a long time for the key to melt. The shaft had weakened first and the ends had bent, draping across the log as if lounging on a chaise, lazy and seductive. The curlicued handle had gone next, its shape loosening and twisting. The end had softened last and then the magic had run out, rendered like pig fat into a slick film that stained the log. That too disappeared as the fire crackled on, little silver sparks that winked and blinked and disappeared. Finally there was nothing left but ashes and soot and a burnt metallic smell.
Fuck. Somewhere deep inside Harry there might have been a tendril of jealousy. Mostly, though, it was all white-hot desire. He wanted to see Malfoy's mouth get fucked hard and fast. He wanted to see Malfoy drool and squirm and try to take it.
“Wait,” Dawlish said, radiating satisfaction. “I haven’t brought you here just to show you the accommodations.”
Harry would have protested—no caressing!—but Seamus's cock was already half-way down his throat. He coughed and gagged, a kind of one-two noise that sounded loud and lewd and almost distracted him from the sensation itself. Which was awful.
Theo made a show of considering, though Draco would bet anything he'd already decided exactly what to ask for. It wasn't like they hadn't all been thinking about this ever since Potter had been revealed as the Gryffindor sucker.
The dog looked up at him, a low-pitched whine seemingly caught in its throat, as if pity and love were more than it felt it deserved. Draco gave him another encouraging pat, hoping that if nothing else in his entire useless life he was at least making this one dog a little happier with his company. "So show me everything? Which one do you like best?"
Professor McGonagall took off her spectacles and rubbed at the bridge of her nose. “Am I to understand,” she said, “that you and Mr. Zabini have decided, based on no evidence whatsoever, that Mr. Malfoy, who could be anywhere at all in the castle--or
Harry pushed himself up onto his elbows over Draco, his eyes shining and his face flushed, the firelight casting a rosy glow over his skin, a bronze statue of a young god come to life. “I like wrecking you,” Harry said. “I like what it does to your face. Makes it all soft and sort of… you know.
"Cocksucker," Marcus said, leaning forward. "We're here to pick a cocksucker so stop jawing and let's get to it."
"Right, well, trial and error, it's a fine thing." Harry jittered. The wand was taking its sweet time this go around, spinning like a figure skater on finale. Sadistic little length of wood—did it really have to draw this out?
“We bloody well didn’t! And not like that! What the fuck is wrong with you?”
“Well, at least you’re out of the contract. But Harry, a word of advice. I wouldn’t trust my dick in George’s mouth no matter how desperate I get, and you shouldn’t either. You’re liable to come out with it just two inches long and bright green.”
Harry didn’t back away. He didn’t scream. He’d faced a basilisk, he’d faced Voldemort for God’s sake. He was not going to run at the sight of a now animated doll no matter how bloody extremely creepy it was—
Harry gave an involuntary shudder. When he’d died in the Forbidden Forest during the Battle of Hogwarts, if he’d chosen to pass on, as Dumbledore had put it, would someone have made a doll that looked like him and stuffed a painting of him inside it? Would Ron and Hermione want to visit with his wax double pretending it was really him? He looked down the hall at Draco and Cassie chatting away as they walked. There was something deeply wrong about it, and the fact that Draco didn’t seem to feel that way at all made it even worse. Was it even right to make a portrait of someone who had died young and yearning, capturing that grief and fear forever in paint?
"I think he wants to know if you have his vote," Blaise's amused voice drawled behind them.
Dawlish grinned, his teeth flashing white in the shadows. “An undetectable obliviation spell’s a useful thing after a war,” he said, “especially when certain members of the Shacklebolt administration see fit to deny promotions to those of us who remained employed during the Voldemort administration. Rather capricious that, given that the entire Ministry was under the command of the Dark Lord.”
Draco stroked himself more firmly, twisting his hand, his nose buried in Harry’s hair. “Wank yourself, then.”
Potter snickered. "Sorry." He pressed his lips closed but another snicker escaped, then another. "Oh, god, sorry, I shouldn't laugh but oh, bugger, if I'd met her when I was little, she'd probably be mine too."
Draco quickened his pace. A moment or two later he was there. He reached out and stroked the stone. It was cold and damp and rough-hewn but it was real and something eased inside himself as he touched the chisel marks left by some long-forgotten stonemason. This was human-made. The curtain fluttered in his face and he grabbed it, pushing it aside to see what lay on the other side of the arch.
"Just need the loo first," Draco managed.
The wand landed on Marcus while scene after scene flashed through Draco's head, each one worse than the last. He barely noticed when Marcus sneered and waved away his turn. It wasn't a surprise. Marcus was doing fine—he'd already been recruited as a Beater for one of those Sicilian teams, the type that won because they were the only ones left on their brooms at the end of the match.
Draco could just imagine how very much Filch didn't want Slytherins spread randomly throughout the castle, suddenly able to claim that they had every right to be in any particular corridor after hours. Worse than a Siberian doxy infestation to Filch's mind, he bet.
The mass of students followed her back along the dungeon hallway, filling the air with the buzz of questions—suddenly everyone had finished every assignment, it was just that their parchments were ruined but they wouldn't have to redo them, right—and new school robes, what were they supposed to wear tomorrow—
Malfoy waved a hand in that aristocratic way of his, that was supposed to mean
“Not moving. Do you--do you wanna wank some more?”
Harry was starting to realize that any answer which contained an ‘of course’ was something that he would never have heard of before, even if he had listened to every single word which had fallen from the lips of Professor Binns, which he hadn’t. “I’m starting to think they should have taught Pureblood Studies right along with Muggle Studies. Make everyone take both, no excuses.”
Harry’s stomach gave a jolt. “She couldn’t have been more than six,” he said, more to himself than to Draco who had run ahead after Cassie, laughing like he must have when he was no older than she would always be. What must it have been like to grow up here, where the past was your actual companion? And wasn’t it just like Lucius to make sure Draco played with a girl who had every reason to hate and fear the outside world?
to like them, I don’t want to do this with you.” Potter sat all the way up, running a hand through his hair in agitation. “I spent the first half of my life with people who didn’t really want me, people who were made to be with me because something terrible would happen to them if they didn’t. And I can’t--” he shook his head.

Harry opened his mouth to question, to argue, and then closed it again. If the barrier was going to come down, he needed to trust Draco.
interested, not just “I want to use your talented mouth” interested. Half the male Death Eaters in Britain had been interested in Draco for that, for fuck’s sake, no matter how they were keyed. No, this was
Not enough though. Draco tugged Potter's pants off and got his own down in the process, sadly having to push Potter off to accomplish this. Really, weren't Gryffindors supposed to be the ones to spearhead the charge? Potter wasn't being any help at all—he was too busy staring at Draco's cock.
Widley brought treacle tart and took the trays away, while Potter explained, rueful and laughing, in between sticky bites of shared tart, that no, he really hadn't done it. He told Draco everything, all the things that had happened that year, from the tasks to the fake Moody, until Draco's eyes were about ready to pop out of his head. There might have been kisses, too, mouthed back and forth, the crook of a neck, the wrist, the fingers needing to have each crumb sucked away.
(See the end of the chapter for
The problem was that Voldemort was dead. Well, that wasn’t a problem, that was bloody marvelous, and he was thrilled the Second Wizarding War was won, but it was just. You see. A bit boring now.  They were all back here for their final year, set to the task of attaining the approved academic certificates, the twins included. The Ministry, it seemed, frowned on people concocting new charms and potions when they hadn’t so much as a single NEWT to rub between them. All of them, back to being treated as feckless students rather than the adults they legally were. It rankled.
Harry snorted. "I've gotten reasonably acquainted with how it works over the past few weeks. Thanks for asking."
Nev's hips jerked. That was a yes to the head bob, then, so Harry did it again. He wasn't taking Nev in very deep and it was a lot easier than what he'd done with Seamus. Thinking of Seamus made his own cock throb—it had been harder and a little mean, but he'd kind of liked it too.
“Of course not. It hurt so badly I longed for the full moon.” Remus sighed, sagging a little. “The pain of transformation is something I’d never wish on anyone but at least I knew for a few hours every month, I’d be free from ruminating on what Sirius had done.” He squeezed the edge of the bed, wrinkling the red and gold coverlet. “Well, what I thought he had done.”
Blaise set the wand to spinning again. Draco pushed it all back—the heartsickness, the fear for Father, the wretched bone-sucking exhaustion that was creeping over him.
The Dark Lord hadn't been flashy about it. No
“...Padfoot?”
“Have you talked to him?” Remus asked.
Which could only mean one thing: once again, Harry Potter had gotten Draco Malfoy into a shitload of trouble that Draco would never have found on his own.
Malfoy looked horrified. "You were magically compelled to do that?"
, but the larger, smarter part of him wanted to live and so he kept the wand tight and focused.
"Someday very soon we're going to talk about consent issues," Dean said. His hand smoothed across Harry's chest, stroking across a nipple, not quite pinching it.
The dream had ended with him doing the Dark Lord's paperwork. He'd groaned out loud when he woke up--even his nightmares had gotten tame. Then he'd felt all itchy and even though the itch was probably in his soul rather than his skin, he'd swung his legs out of bed and gone to take a shower.
A shadow fell over them. Harry looked up and then looked up a little more at the tall figure now standing there, a pleasantly amused expression spreading across his face. Blaise Zabini, close enough to take in every detail of their drenched embrace, but just far enough back to keep his expensive-looking shoes away from their dirty puddle. Behind him crowded the rest of Slytherin House, a mass of curious eyes and dropped jaws and whispering heads.
“Wait,” he blurted. “You need to cast a
It wasn’t a room so much as a garden, Harry decided as he looked around. Sunlight shone in from a glass ceiling high above that gave the place the feel of a conservatory. Harry took a deep breath: it smelled like the kitchen gardens at Hogwarts. The clean scent of apples, like the one Draco had tossed him when they sat and talked on the wall. A breeze rustled around him, bringing with it the scent of Quidditch leathers and the feel of rushing after the Snitch, neck and neck with Draco. A warm, human scent followed next: the smell of the crook of Draco’s neck in the morning after Harry had slept the whole night curled around him.
Draco wanted very badly to keep his nose buried in the crook of Potter's neck. It was surprisingly comfortable, marvelously warm, and humiliatingly safe. That last part didn't bear thinking about, but then again, ever since the war began so very few things had. It was certainly better than lifting his head to look at the figure looming over them who surely had to be Blaise—Draco's ears were too full of water to hear the voice but he could smell the Italian shoe leather from here.
"Come on, then," Nott said, his voice soft and cruel. Draco stepped into the common room. As Nott had promised, Flint was there, sitting alone by the fire, a plate of food on the side table and a smuggled bottle of Ogden's in his hand.
"From Sirius, of course. He was my godfather."
"He was just there in the dorm, and then the water came, and we got out of there together," Potter rabbited on, words coming more and feebly in the face of McGonagall's unwavering stare.
"Revenge is a dish best served wet—"
Dawlish just stared, apparently waiting for Draco to catch up to what he really wanted.
Draco had no idea what Potter was on about. What people who didn’t want him? Potter had been the darling of the Wizarding World his entire life. Still was.
Harry tugged Draco’s briefs down to his ankles. Draco’s cock sprang forward and Harry fell on him at once, licking long sloppy stripes up the side of Draco’s shaft. “Tell me how you like it, how to do it to you,” he murmured. “Remember that day with Neville and Blaise, when we had the contest to see which of us could make them come first and I lost? You promised you’d teach me.”
Harry heard himself give the command to the snake, but the word was in English, not Parseltongue. He tried again.
anyway as he crawled into Neville's bed.
“How’d I do?”
Harry sucked him in, his lips pushing back Draco’s foreskin, the sensitive head of his cock hitting the roof of Harry’s mouth. Harry hummed a question, looking up at Draco through glasses that were now completely askew on his face, his mouth taut around Draco’s prick.
"Of course," Seamus said. "This kind of thing happens all the time back home in Limerick. I know how to work it."
"Fuck." Marcus's sides heaved. "Don't fucking stop now, you cunt."
“For saving Sirius.”
Malfoy rolled over toward them, face insolent. "And you can do it with them down? Competently? Gracefully, even? This I have to see."
"Is this what you've been living off?" Draco scrunched a hand in the thick fur at the dog's scruff. How wretched, how cruel, for this poor dog to have had to live like this, scrounging off the leavings of the wizarding world.
Harry snickered and continued up to the dorm. It was none of his business. Maybe if he was Head Boy he'd have been obligated to warn someone. But no. McGonagall had decided—
“And you didn’t even fucking try to explain? You just used me?”
below the waist."
Harry frowned. “What about—” He broke off, a sudden spasm making his throat seize up. Coughing, he bent down and picked up the cup again and drank. The cool water eased his throat, but this time, standing here with Draco, he felt the water reach all the way down inside him, quenching just a bit of that deeper thirst he’d been carrying nearly all his life. It cleared his brain, chasing away all the fancy spells he’d learned over the past year. He looked up from the cup, which was already refilling, to see Draco watching him intently. Harry grinned. The water of the fountain of love knew what spell was needed.
“Somebody tell me what’s going on,” Sirius said again. “Harry, where are you tearing off to?”
Potter eased back against the pillow as Widley disappeared, an awkward smile on his face. "You don't mind? I thought maybe we could talk? If we went down to dinner we'd be at different tables."
Marcus cried out and his hands flew to Draco's head, grasping him by the hair. It felt nothing like when Pansy stroked him, but still it calmed Draco a little just the same. He was doing what he needed to do to save someone he loved. He had a skill and why should he be ashamed of that, or of the fact that he loved cock? Up and down he stroked, steady now, settling into a rhythm that had Marcus whimpering and twisting. Pre-come was leaking over his tongue already, hot and bitter, and Draco opened his throat as Marcus bucked up, hips desperately seeking more friction, more sensation.
“Smart lad.” Dawlish’s gaze darted to something behind Draco and Draco turned, thinking that perhaps they’d been spotted. But no, Dawlish was looking at the moon. It was newly risen, low and huge on the horizon. It appeared full already, the slight roughness of its final curve nearly invisible in the gathering darkness. It would be truly full tomorrow. Draco had twenty-four hours before Father had to face down the werewolf again. Hopefully, he wouldn’t need them.
“I said, I want out of the contract. Now.” Harry lowered his wand, but not all the way. He pointed it straight at Fred’s bits; then, when Fred flinched, he flicked his wand George’s way as well. “Listen, both of you. You tricked me and you lied to me and you nearly killed two people. Now break the contract or I’ll hex your balls off myself, I swear.”
Zabini's eyes flashed hard and bright, full of a sudden, sharp anger. "Don't. Don't you
"Oh, open the
"It's great. Marvelous." Nev shifted nervously. "Just, er, not so much with the teeth, please?"
"The skill—"
“But you have to do what I say,” Draco managed.
Finally Harry stopped and pulled off. Embarrassment flowed through as fast as his orgasm had. He had just come probably harder than he ever had in his entire life. With Cormac McLaggen's cock jammed down his throat.
"You're lying," Harry said, feeling a wild hope ignite inside him. "Ron was the last one out before it was you and me, George. You can't tell me Ron wants to suck cock. I know he doesn't."
Her heels clacked eagerly on the stone, leading him further down the tower than he'd ever been before: past the level of the common room, through a wall that turned out to be a door, finally stopping on a tiny landing. "It used to be a private study nook and more recently it's been used to store cleaning supplies but I got it cleared out for you and had a bed put in."
George had made it to Fred's side and was helping him up. "Harry, don't worry. The contract doesn't extend to the Slytherins. You had to agree to the terms of the contract and be there for the wand spin."
“I know. I’m sorry, Cassie.” Draco moved toward her, regret in his voice. “It hasn’t--well, it hasn’t been good recently. I’m sorry, I became busy with school and then, well, you saw what had moved into the Manor.” His look turned inward, growing pained. “I would have loved to have someone to talk to but I didn’t want to draw attention to you.”
Harry stepped back, then to the side, meaning to adjust his stance so that he was directly opposite Draco. His foot knocked against the cup, which tipped over on its side and rolled right through the Veil, its contents spilling out over the misty ground.
Okay…apparently the aristocracy didn’t go in for the great British pastime of remodeling. Harry banished the too-amusing image of Draco Malfoy on Property Ladder, picking out tile for a kitchen redo. “How did you ever manage at Hogwarts then?” he asked, bemused. “There must be centuries of history in every dorm room. Every bed, come to think of it.”
Shivering, Draco shoved his hands deep into the pockets of his robes. He’d only been out here behind the Hogwarts kitchens for a few minutes, but the twilight’s autumn chill had already seeped into his bones.
Harry took a quick suck then settled himself between Ron's legs and started to bob his head up and down in earnest. Ron's hand tangled in his hair, encouraging him on, little groans starting to escape from his throat. A salty taste met his tongue on each swipe around the top of the head, along with a buck of the hips.
Well. Actually that's exactly what happened. Not that Draco was going to start spouting off what had happened, what little he knew of it. The whole incident was clearly aimed at him, given his history with the cabinets. Oh—at that thought Draco's heart gave a little flop then sank to the region of his toes. Potter wasn't trying to protect
Or was it Harry’s magic, somehow trying to save him? Draco couldn’t help that hopeful little whisper in his brain, so he let it swim to the surface of his consciousness and gave it a brutal kick of common sense. Harry was done with him. He’d given Draco one more chance to choose a new path, and once again, Draco had chosen to try to save Father.
Draco took a deep breath, letting his head tip back toward the night sky. He had done it. He had freed his father, just as the Arithmancy equations had promised. Yet he didn’t feel relief. In the chill of the Flesh Eater’s Garden, bathed in cold moonlight and surrounded by menacing shadows, it was hard to believe there was anywhere truly safe. No sooner had the thought entered his mind than a memory arose in all his senses--he was in Harry’s bed somewhere high in Gryffindor tower, held down by the delicious weight of Harry’s chest against his own; the smell of sex and school soap was in the air, and the taste of Harry’s mouth on his, and the bump of his wire-frame glasses against Draco’s temple, and the softness of the sheets, and he was safe, he was saved--and then the memory was gone again, blown away by a cold breeze that set the lobes of the Jupiter fly-trap swaying, their shadows shifting on the ground like scuttling animals. Draco took another breath, his chest aching and curiously empty. That memory belonged to another world that had nothing at all to do with this one.
"Er, what I want to know is, how do you feel about Voldemort now? Did you stop supporting him by the end?"
Beneath Padfoot Remus is sputtering, his hands instinctively shoving at the mist-damp mass of teeth and tangled fur pinning him to the floor, but then, one hand shielding his face as if from blows, he grips the dog by the scruff of the neck and holds him, his eyes focusing, and his whole face begins to tremble.
"Professor McGonagall," Granger was already protesting, "I got your message but surely you can't expect us to house the, the —well there's not room in any case—"
Marcus spread his legs. He was enjoying this, that was clear.
"A favor? Harry had no idea what Malfoy was on about. "Great. Sure. Thanks, but you don't owe me anything. I, er, enjoyed it. And, you see, I had rather thought maybe you enjoyed it too? That's what I came out to talk to you about."
“It worked with the door in the Slytherin dorm,” Harry said, pressing the tip of his finger against Draco’s. “It has to work again here.”
“Good job,” Dawlish said dryly. “Nice to know the curriculum at Hogwarts isn’t entirely useless.”
The twins looked at each other, their expressions unreadable.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand instead of answering. The warmth was returning, but with it came the thudding feel of Draco’s pulse, which seemed to be hammering along at far too fast a pace. “Adders are a protected species now, did you know that? There are so few of them left that it’s illegal to hurt them.”
"You'd fucking own us, that's what's terrible about it." Marcus loomed over Blaise. "Say this, do that, come here, go away. Each little favor might be tiny but with that many of them we'll be dancing to your tune all day every day!"
The thought of gifts and favors turned his mind back to Malfoy and the contract. Where was Malfoy anyway? If he’d gone for a shower he might be back any minute, and Harry didn’t fancy Ron finding out from Malfoy that he’d spent the night in Harry’s bed. It would be better to break it to Ron before Malfoy came back, which meant he didn’t have much time. Definitely not time enough to explain to Ron that he’d had feelings for Malfoy for years. Maybe for now he could just say that since he’d become the contracted sucker, he’d been getting a lot more experience, and somehow yesterday that experience had involved sucking Malfoy off in front of Neville and Blaise, and then from there things had… well, they had escalated, that was all. Escalated rather a lot.
Salazar Fucking Slytherin on a stick, he’d just wanked for Harry Potter.
The footsteps—they were footsteps!—paused, then started again as Harry kept calling. The curtain blew back—no, it was being lifted. A figure was there in the mist on the other side of the Veil.
“Accio Cabinet,” he called out, his wand pointed toward it. It shuffled towards him and he repeated the spell until it was all the way against the barrier, hard and flush with it, pinning the Veil to one side.
did to me. Honestly, if they ever take it into their minds to be Dark Lords, we're all sunk."
So what the hell had Malfoy's problem been earlier, when he rolled away and got all moody? What was it Zabini had said when he came in? It was important, too important to let pass.
One of the twins flipped their wands in the air. The other one caught them, two identical sticks clacking as they fell into his hand. "Best not to know, really."
His hand, trembling halfway to his wand, fell back against his side.
the voice in Draco’s chest cried again. Had been crying, he realized, since the moment Harry had abandoned him in the Muggle hotel room in London. And would keep crying unless he found some way to convince it that there was no point in going on like that because Harry wasn’t coming back.
With big thanks to Maesterchill for the beta!
Malfoy continued to scream, if you could call it that. The noise he was making was lower than a scream, though with the same intensity, and it came in short, sobbing gasps, as if Malfoy couldn’t get enough air into his lungs.
Pribbling, the ginger, gave a half-hearted shrug. "I say throw 'em both back in Azkaban where they belong. Tonks is too bloody soft-hearted on this lot." He spat on the ground, near enough to Draco's boot that Draco flinched before he could help himself.
Cassie nodded. “There’s a nest of keys like that in the Librarian’s tomb. I’d try there.” She tipped her head, considering. “There’s a few down in the dungeon, too—”
He finished his treacle tart and banished his plates back to the kitchen. He should push himself out of bed and go upstairs right now. Tell Malfoy how the contract worked.
He had a moment of icy dread, but even as panicked thoughts flashed through his head—would he grow thirstier and thirstier the more he drank, until he died from it?—he realized what was wrong. He was drinking from the fountain of love all alone. He needed to share it with someone. With Draco. He bent down the fountain to fill the cup again, but as soon as he stretched his hand toward the water, the cup refilled itself. Harry straightened up in surprise and as he did, a door appeared on the other side of the fountain, swinging open to reveal another room beyond it. The next Chamber in the Department of Mysteries.
He followed Draco and Cassie up to a pair of doors that opened to a dark, high-ceilinged library. Bookshelves stretched almost as far as he could see, almost meeting in the distance in some kind of optical illusion, or maybe some kind of library magic that would make Hermione’s toes curl with pleasure.
Of course not. Draco watched as Dawlish removed the key from the lock and brought it close to his face, frowning. The setting where the emerald had been looked ghastly, an empty eye-socket. Of course the key wasn’t going to work without its emerald, and Draco had known that all along, hadn’t he? Why then had he not come up with some better plan, found something else Dawlish would jump at the chance to possess?  He had fucked this up too, of course.
McLaggen paused. "Everything? But all you really need is my—"
“Terrible, terrible,” the old elf muttered in response to Harry’s greeting. “Entirely improper, the halfbreed’s behavior. If only a true son of the house were--”
“What?” Harry whispered, even as he answered his own question. Yeah, he’d feel bad, and he’d apologize too, but he’d fuck Ron’s face if he got the chance, no question.
“Salazar on a broomstick, Blaise, that wizard just gave me a full blown panic attack. We’re not exactly planning on starting a family together. He practically killed me just now--”
A sudden worry hit Harry--what if Nev came before he even had a chance to suck him off? Harry lowered his head fast at the thought of that. His nose bumped stomach then he edged over and his mouth was on Neville's cock. Another shiver went through him as he licked around the tip, going far more slowly and delicately than he ever would have allowed himself with the lights on.
But all Harry said was, “Yeah?” He let go of Draco’s balls and then the tips of his fingers were brushing lightly over Draco’s taint, pressing back between his arse cheeks.
in the middle. We'll smash it to pieces."
"What's done is done," said Zabini, his unflustered voice cutting through the fuss with the assurance of the impeccably well-bred. "We're flooded out. We're living here. There's no sense fighting about the facts now." He crossed his arms and smiled at the twins. "So. Back to the matter at hand. Under the circumstances, then, we need to choose our own cocksucker. Put up an equal stake, so to speak."
Harry’s mouth twisted as he realized that now of course he had to give the whole argument some thought. The Dursleys hadn’t exactly raised him to expect love, had they? Dumbledore surely had cared more about him than Petunia had, but hadn’t Harry learned from Dumbledore to look for the lies underneath the caring? His parents had loved him, obviously, but hadn’t he learned from them to expect that love would leave him?
He wiggled with impatience, waiting for the rest to arrive in the dorm room.  Finally the twins came in with the contract they'd drawn up and threw themselves down on Ron’s bed, making him shove over to Harry’s. Neville sat on his own, Dean and Seamus shared, and McLaggen lounged in the doorway like the prick he was.
