hurriedly Draco cover his mouth with his hand as he sees the figure pause after hearing the sudden sound from him, slowly looking around but end continue the ritual again as Draco feel relived for second.
'whats wrong draco?' pansy who stand, is now sitting next to him in worry.
‘well… that is surprising is it, severus?’ said the women name professor Minerva, looking nearly blank as her eyes stare in question toward the unemotional man, name professor Snape.
The other boys still unmove from waking up nor heard the book speak.
The crowd were look and worry for the boy as the boy had swallow the ball.
There's a light seem to bright for him to see as if it's calling.
'ENOUGH! you fool! Better word again this time! I need the stone you fool. And made sure potter is there to take it...crusio! The faceless man dissapear within the second.
'What is the meaning of this?!' shout the black hood figure, while staring the person in front of him.
'i wonder~' mr oliver look in the right store ahead and take the wand to harry. Again. It freak harry and him. Yes him. The draco fear for the shop going down and swallow him. So illusion. Very unlike malfoy.
The room were occupied with books all over and there a long shape hat seem out of place.
As if it was a date for him and harry. Gosh what dreamer. Draco smile in thought.
Theo rolling his eyes up as he walk closely and stand infront of pansy, 'well you tell me why you two don't accept the invitation?!'
‘hermione stop it!’ a male voice name Draco Malfoy feel his heart ready to be bust out, while Hermione snickered in tease to see her best friend, draco in blushing face and smiling in ease.
‘…boy!...’ the familiar sound irritated than him who had hard time to adjust his eyes to just open. ‘hmmmm…duck muggle boo! Ergh!
But. Who is that man watching him just now. Draco look worried and wonder as he did saw a figure stand a few moment on the wall, which is in the top of the tall buiding located somewhere in there.
....'let me finish the reading of this book, *****! And maybe this page will made you curious even more for this next sentence-'....
Gulping for his nervous and slowly ask for more toward the sorting hat, 'why must slytherin?'
‘ANSWER YOU B- ‘yelled the hulk man with his stick keep swing to the boy’s body in no mercy at all.
'well then go on that if you that smart' ron insisted while looking straight to the girl.
Wonder whats going there. They both thought while looking at each other in question.
‘ah well... come in draco’ said hermione in unsure of what to do with the guest inside with her.
'..your great great grandfather is malfoy..and yes..i know you malfoy...as i sense your magic from..far..come close..its time for you to go back..' the book response smoothly to give information to him.
‘hmmm…don’t be such hurry brother! we need a plan to do so…hmmm’
Feeling to be away from the water above him, as he also feel his breathing rapidly faster than before, 'whats going on with me' the question seem to answer when he remember the night in his dream.
The time now show 5am.
Lets the chapter take you...
'i know mione. It just that..i ermm' harry sound unsure to says as hermione smile for the reaction she see toward harry.
'i'm sorry' harry whisper again toward draco's ear.
So griffidor. The young malfoy seem upside down for the history to change like this. Is he that he too kind? For them to had weird reaction like harry do?
What a day. He thought as he hurry want to sleep and forget pansy'S word about the green eyes.
’27... yes… 28... yes…29... no... 30 no..31- ‘
He wonder what draco felt for him.
Soon you will be begged for my mercy, Laila! The man with a masked feel his heart ache in revenge of the women who had rejected his lust of love for her.
‘hmm... it looks delicious!’ mumble Draco as he scan hungrily of the food in front of him..i mean her.
The three student which consist two Gryffindor student and the one student from the Slytherin house. Feeling worry, they went silently toward the laying red hair person in the Hogwart hospital wing name Ron Weasley.
'i heard that the sorting is nasty devil flame come out from it' exclaimed a fearful tone voice from red hair person name ron weasley.
Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock.
Immediately, harry take eye contact toward draco looking curious for draco saying please to him, 'ermm what is it that you need my help, dra?'
‘don’t pretend you don’t know! You’re silly girl! I’m werewolf and I can smell of his scent on you!’
Here is the continue story of Draco as women that he barely knew or is it? Why he feels something was not right? Why he never knows this person was his great-great grandmother? (this the continue of the 1947 scene)
‘amen..’ seeing her only son praying beside her with his eyes closed and hoping it could work even if it is miracle, that would be bless.
‘noted dearly son~ will see you soon there~ and goodbye as well dearly’
‘I... I HATE YOU TERRY! WHY! TELL ME WHY! JUST WHY ME! TERRY- ‘the man name terry boot decided to stop and left her sprawled in relieved as she needed as much rest.
'ummmm..' he groan to feel his body stiff pose is slowly to ease, as he stretch in yoga way.
No. It can't be.
The time is start for you new student to be sort
The sound of draco's cry seem woke harry from his anger, 'Dra? oh gosh draco i'm sorry I-I really sorry' slowly harry carry draco toward the blue long and big sofa that are not far from ron's bed.
‘I disagree for this professor that- ‘
Lets begin today triple chapter...
'No! I can't!! she is my love that I wait for so long! can we just use some other girl than my maiden instead?, which is the same age as my maiden, please I beg you!!' the hood man begging on his knee to beg for mercy.
As the last sentence of word, the spell hit the man who hold the body in unmercyness as he fall down in pain 'augggh!'
‘Narcissa…please stay here for awhile i-I need you and I’m sorry but-‘
'yes..dear boy..' the voice soft whisper for him to heard.
The mystery book were there to guide him in dangerous task to complete sooner..
'dear harry-' harry pause smilling as he continue again to read the small card, '-im going to give you a coat for up coming christmas, your best wish draco'
‘why! I did told many time is NO and my permission will be no and you are staying here whether you willing or not! I-'
In the present time, dark night seem shine toward the man who lay froze in unknown prison cell, named ‘Lucas Malfoy’ that seem lost in his memory.
‘forgive us mistress!!’ echoed all people as they bow in respect.
What. Forbidden book?. Ahhh.  He thought in remembering that he do had a mystery book here.
‘SILENCE!!’
‘pleaseeee stop it hurt..it hurt-’
'gosh pansy' draco looks flare red as he pull the letter from pansy's hand.
“pansy!!”
Flashback came as he remember her last word.
‘hmmm..begin to repel that protection spell girl! And listen! Don’t fail me!’ the man command as the girl bowed again.
‘ah..y-your welco-welcome as well cousin’ cedric feel his face is red as he also gave his cousin, draco a big smile.
With that, both went out the room.
Breathing hard. Breath in. Out. In. Out. In-
Is that sorting hat? He question himself in thought.
'nothing! And its not your own business' he reply back as he stare hard toward theo's dark iris black-brown eyes.
'Mr harry, please sit down first if you want to listen the-'
'come on harry, hurry!! the time is ticking!' the girl run while shouting her friend follow behind her.
'well..well.. Take a sit you two and again don't be late next time' the human form speak stern and that human form is professor minerva.
'the fush!' feeling pain as soon the water touch his body.
“you promise me! That you will help me for this afternoon. Please~” said pansy with her pleading eyes for draco feel nearly gave up.
'please harry' begged draco as he stare harry eyes for the right answer.
Let the get the journey clue begin~
In the same present time but in a different location in more private. There a man with the same dark tone clothes, he is known ‘the strict one, the evil one that adores his house but sometimes he was not and many more rumors about him.
'hah' he signed, while walking toward the small lake,  where not people usually visit. Feeling like want to sit down.
Knock
'i-i am err sorry my lord i-i is just-' the other man struggle talking.
'ron? Tell them!' draco demand as ron still refuse to see them.
Is he stay as slytherin or unfortunute expected happen that seem takeout lucious brain. Well emotion of un-malfoy way.
She did it. She slap herself and knowing it hurt as the her face is already looking pinkish red, 'for ron. yes for ron' she mumbling repeating like a mantra, as she finish her the last page of book that she holding.
Harry rise his left eyebrow in blank thought 'why'
The man with the hood disappear to prepare the spell of the girl to be prepare for the ritual.
‘naughty girl should be punishing for slapping this face… I wonder~’ the sound of the zipper made the girl, name Padma froze as she feels fears all over her body of the man’s eyes.
...let the mystery begin...
Sudden sound make Draco stop and listen carefully, “mmmmm”
After the dinner night.
Draco glances at harry for moment, ‘I hope it will harry but let’s hope it work for us to able to read’
The figure push ron side as she run in tears, 'i think she heard you, ron' harry's voice in dissapointed toward ron's statement.
I do hope the sorting hat i made here is stay simple and classic.
In fact, I'm going to give you dear readers for the newest chapter then another day maybe, is also new chapter. don't forget for the kudos~
Draco eyes look wary as he see a man that seemly become one as shadow form then again the figure dissappear as soon the students near the large window. Which is where the shadow man hide.
I love simple short date for draco and harry. They just seriously cute.
'Harry!'
He hide his giggle with his right hand and still wonder for-
And his name is Severus Snape, who is quietly doing correcting the student's assignment, ‘I need a clear head now…hah’ he signed tiredly, feeling warm from the firewood that eases away from the cold.
Hmmm interesting to see that Cedric is my cousin, thought Draco as he feels he had really had change the timeline even different.
The twins then look at him for the reply and he just gave nodded in respect than replying back.
'run my boy, run as far from here..i..love yo-u' as if her breath was too much and there, she lay as stone beside her father, lucious, who been dead by the dead curse than torture like, his mother.
The clock ticking and shown : 9Am
The boy, harry shake his head. Beside him, hermione raise her hand to answer, but the professor ignore her and continue to ask question 'hmmm..what about the potion for sleepless? Or the wake someone up'
'do you know what happen, mr malfoy?' madam poppy ask without looking at him, as she continue to dap the potion on ron's left arm.
'come along students, right this way' she scured as hurry, and us the students walk behind her in silence and excited eyes to look forward to be sorted.
‘shhhh...harry is still asleep!’
‘well... it was not the right time when he was very young. Too young even for me to be near him. Now he is little adult. Now, finally.. I can speak the trut- ‘Cedric reply back in sad tone, looking toward the floor than the girl infront of him. Feel shame was all he can think of.
'i-i i'm cominggg!! Gosh MIOne!!' harry ran as fast as he could to catch up toward his friend ahead of him.
Knock!
‘I think you know about it, harry!’ hermione said as harry face had became more confused.
'..sleep well..young boy..the information is more and..will tell you..sooner..' the young malfoy nodded toward the book.
‘oh, shush you!’ draco scowled, feel his heart ease once again.
It is to prevent the student, especially the reporter student, from spreading the rumor of the fallen weasley boy.
........
The man gave no answer as he nodded instead in respond, ‘I never know your godson is the last fleux and is it his father, Lucius know about this, severus?’ asked Minerva in curious, as her eyes still stay on the man’s face.
…Unexpected something had happened toward the young Malfoy? What could it be….?
'to the next book, hah' she sighed loud as she hurry to the next book to read, 'please god help me! merlin this mercy!'
**shift to the memory of lucas malfoy, the day alex is long gone**
'..of course mother' he slowly said and knowing his hand may had to let go of her warm hand.
He look familiar tho. Draco mind seem curious as he step more closely toward the male figure.
‘it just it! Draco, I don’t know! I just-‘
'ouh dray..your darling harry~' pansy voice more in teasing tone.
Harry reply hermione instead, 'errm sorry mione. he need rest for now and ermm-'
‘Calm down,’ a soft voice whisper in Hermione’s head, which startled her as she looked around her but no one was there. Who was it? Thought Hermione as she feels calm immediately after hearing that sound like from male voice and that voice reminds her of-
Slowly. He walk and stand little away from the book.
‘thank you, mistress... my decision for this boy is that we must need his permission in asking before train him as the warrior we have been looking for. And not only that, we also need to avoid the Malfoy man, which is his father. Who had erase the boy’s memory of his lost brother’
'stop ciessa! Your son is fine. His a big boy now and-'
The plan he desire was long gone as harry was his plan to safe but fear that the long boy who lived is dead.
Still no sight of him.
The sound of someone soft snore was exhausted for the boy name Draco, as he and Hermione had searched many times for some clue to cure their friends, Ron And even toward Harry but disappointed in end.
The shock exploded within Hermione, as it can see the reflection in Hermione’s eyes.
'Geez! her hair look disgusting tho. is she even bath at all?!'
A conservation happen for certain occur.
His hand tied. His body full of scar and fresh one was not only he thinking about, other than that he had sense he had another little brother. A proud one as his belated-brother. feeling his mind drift to one of his memory.
They were going to the last row but it looks occupied by the twin red hair standing there and the other full of two red hair behind them.
Then suddenly the door bang, the man run while shouting the word 'troll tro-troll in the dungeon' then the man faint like a sleeping beauty moment. That man is professor quirell.
‘erh… muggle word... blegh’
Dreaming about a book. Really odd and off for me but i really imagine the book of its own may had the secret behind it.
He wonder where father is. Father always busy. He said to mind. When mr oliver show the wand first for harry.
‘hmm hmmm... the night is still young~ I believ-’ a sound of the male voice humming toward the harry’s room as the beautiful male, draco Malfoy bringing the food for him and hermione’s dinner there.
Draco tried to calm himself down, ‘harry~ my love please~’
Merlin help me away from this pain...
'ouh weasley.. I know that you hate malfoy generation and no, im nor mad. Im very worry that why you fight with theo and not bring a wand along?
“I know I know that’s why I need your help because mia is not in her room this morning”
hello there again readers... hope you all like the update I had put on the chapter 26. Well…so hold the hope and you going to like this one.
With that the girl nod in understanding and ready to do her mission from the master.
Looking the most green forest to the boy-who-lived name harry potter stare right back at him.
'..come.. Malfoy..', he was froze to heard the voice know who he is as he still wonder who or what calling him.
Suddenly, a shine bright blink light up from the book with sudden voice that seem to whisper toward their ears, which startled them to be awaken, ‘behold of the dark out…behold of the dark out…’ the words keeps repeat as if someone or something try to warn them the danger of the book.
Knock…
‘so…’
With no more think about the danger of who the sound was, Draco went with speed light toward the strange pain cry. Worry if it was hermione that had hard time.
‘are you trying to- ‘
“oh, it was you! that spy on us! I knew it that someone was watching! Wait the minute, did you just call hermione as mia?” draco look sterner in the eyes as he feels he need more answer from his childhood friend, pansy.
'whats wrong dear-' the tearing boy, draco hugging tight the mother infront of him.
Damn..i seem to mix and unmatch the scence here..forgive me dear reader..but hope its delight to read..
.....
Brighter it goes the more nature skin tone back toward the boy and with that..
.....
So…. let us begin~ my curious readers...
‘but...I-I am not virgin anymore! You monster! I- ‘padma trying her best to push his hand away from spreading her legs.
Hoping he did not change his sort house as slytherin.
'this is not over!!' said the slytherin boy, theo left with his minion follows behind him.
'no madam. All i know he was laying there alone and no one was around at the hallway. Im worry madam that the trio don't know about ron's situation?' draco explain in honest as he feel worry toward the weasley boy.
He already well clothes like its was magic as he is for malfoy blood.
Hermione stare hard toward the eager harry who wanted the answer, 'let me finish the reading of this book, harry! And maybe this page will made you curious even more for this next sentence. It says here that whoever that had the lust, the desire, the wish to be the pureblood, famous, dark magic and treasure'
Tanaka briefly answer, ‘yes mistress, even if he is from the Malfoy’s family. All his blood is half Malfoy, half blood of black family and full-blood of fleux. He is known as worlf-wolf tribe. Not a wolf not half blood and none of it. Fleux blood is known as the full-blood of worlf-wolf tribe. I see the vision, mistress. Not only that, he is different than his brother. His soul-mate is the boy who-lived, called by name HARRY POTTER!!’
The glow stop and a tatoo appear on left arm,  instead of the black ink just now, it appear as blue attach and word written on the skin, but soon disappear as if it never been there before.
Made Severus startled in annoying toward the disturbance, ‘what? Lupin’. Instead of answering, Remus smile in curious while Severus feel more annoying of the wolf’s behavior.
‘hah? Who?’ hermione looking puzzled of cedric’s question.
Why the wand choose him? Why the mystery of forbidden book want to guide him? Who is he? Is he the draco as only malfoy or more?
With that, all he saw was the man’s worry face and not much again he feels glad, to meets the blackness that seem to cloud his mind once again.
The merely early gaze of morning bright as the class was off day for the student in Slytherin house and Gryffindor house, which a wonder for the two student running out in the hallway with no one around.
..........
.....
'..come..and i will tell..' the book reply sound promise to him.
'not fair!' said theo in unsatified tone.
'ah..forgive me young harry, and young malfoy. Let me see..if it fit you, young malfoy. I wonder~' mr oliver seem unsure to give the wand to him.
As we walk inside the hallway, there in the stair await of a female teacher. 'hello everyone welcome to the hogwart and please silence as we-'
‘you mean we must tell him all the truth and the history we’ve been truth?’ the mistress had the urge of mistrust but in the same time had the slight confuses, ‘please explain what you mean, lord gurrof’
As both suddenly stop the heated argument. There. An owl with appearance of beautiful brown that had fierce yellow eyes, as it flying straight toward Severus, with no thought to alert he open the envelope that had full amount of letters. What is going on. Thought Severus in his mind in worry, while Remus’s eyes in wonder what the letter contain of.
With simple nod of head, slowly Draco reply in simple words ‘ah yes I will eat contently, sire’.
'fine' she walk away and still grinning ear to ear.
Well lets begin..
Lets start the drama...
'..d-drwco?' the person voice up in unclear words. The figure eyes were closely shut.
Harry sound satisfied with his answer. He wonder why harry look glad. Very curious indeed.
‘hermione?’
lets begin this short story~
The malfoy indeed. He thought as he still yawning for early wake.
‘ahahahahha well well... would you look at that blush!’
‘y-yes m-my lord’
In the next chapter, which is in the chapter of 26 will be the continue story of the dark desire in part 4. I called as ‘unbind curse…’ in this chapter (26) is the complete set of the story.
the red door..i keep dreaming this in my sleep which remind me of werewolf, dark figure and torture. Which today the combine was good for me to do…so the dark desire is nearly but not there yet to yet…
“gahhh…pansy! the hell with that water!” groan the boy name draco, while his eyes stare hard toward the person Infront of him.
Draco's smart answer is shocking for all people in the class. Professor keeps questionning harry as if the version harry is the same as the father.
'hmmm..very charming. So many curse and pain..very sorry..dear young boy..hmmm were to put you..' the sorting hat looks very hard thinking.
.....
She knows and she knows it well, but right now the mission is to find what bind her friend ron, 'oh ron please be alright' feeling exhausted making her lose focus.
So…it seems this woman, I mean me as her is someone royalty or some pureblood he neither knew. He thought as he seeing his surrounding of the beautiful scene of the hallway that seem no ending through it.
'wouh what is that neville?' a busy girl name hermione ask neville that seem holding the ball that turn red.
'here you go, dra' harry gave the cup full with water with his left hand, while holding the bottle at the same time with his right arm.
Warning is that its too bizzare reaction among this story. Double warning, the grammar or any name may not in correct word but, this is dramantic moment..
In mere of hour, the malfoy were ready early in the morning. The mother hate showing her emotion in public and the father is hate with crowded people.
But all he see is a book laying there on the cupboard and very dark sense which shiver to his skin, as he look longer to the book.
‘drake? Pssst….’ The voice once again trying to call, but draco wouldn’t move a inch either.
'come..' the voice seem close for him to heard.
With the thought of worry, Draco hurry went to the forbidden forest. Unknown to him, the shadow figure lurking following behind him.
Harry had 1 from hagrid and package from draco.
Time for dinnner were full of hungry students to be bless with food. As one person of griffidors did not show up and harry notice the missing of her.
‘…up!..’ the voice seem getting louder, as he feel annoyed for a moment. Once again, he tried to open but failed ahead.
He wonder what the boy want?. He look back at the green eyes name harry who stop his walk.
Silence. The only thing that can answer her as she burst into tears, knowing her fate is going to crash down for her own doing.
'ah..you may go now dobby and thank you' he smile and making dobby in surprise reaction again.
‘ah my dear boy~ what is it dearly?’ ask the curious mother.
‘well?’ a sharp tone brought Draco in alert as he trying to eat like lady like was so far familiar in his family traditionally calling it ’proper manner’.
'brother? Cousin? What? I-' draco stutter in shock for the truth he find out.
The clock sound echo the wand shop as the wand man still wonder for the young malfoy's first wand.
'so what is it about?' harry look satisfied and also needed to ask as he look Hermione done with her explanation.
As the student were celebrate, professor minerva were arrive that made all the student stop and quiet down, 'mr potter, please follow me'
Ohnoooo.. only ron in my heart calm down hermione..goshhh
‘well…okay fine! Let’s just open it and read whats happen for ron and the truth behind it. So, what should we start first among this three of the dark desire’ hermione feel her heart hurt while mention her friend’s name on her lips.
‘im worry for that boy. If that people find out he is the last fleux! People will use him as excellent weapon or worse as a drive slave that can control by its master!’ answer the beautiful blue wavy-haired girl.
'alright then, im in as well' hermione gave quick answer as she hurry went to her room to pack some magic spell.
He smile back toward harry and, once again, red face appear to harry's face and ear.
Thrust
Who and how it happen?
“Draco? Is it that you?” said the familiar voice that he heard from behind.
Feel like learning history..eehe
The twins shocked mode 'do you read mind?' they asked and stare straight his beautiful eyes.
'...the sorting hat knows..' it repeat in more specific for the young malfoy to understand.
'peww..we're save harry, its the only mr keeper's cat there' as soon as ron speak, the cat change form as to human form.
'..boy..its time for...you to know..why you are not sort in..different house..' seemly the book looks like reading his mind again and that Is still not use for him, the malfoy.
The last sentence seem question for the boy as draco nodded in agreement without voicing up his voice, 'very well..lay down and...close your eyes boy...avor decae sfif fagu deru avou.. Avor-'
Draco feel his leg is down on knee as he breakdown in tears.
‘no! pansy!! I’m super tired and I need a sleep! So, goodnight!’ Draco avoid fast as his head back to the safety place, which is his lovely fluffy pillow.
Well lets not being bored here..
‘hmm..you may go! And tania~ I heard your mother is very~ beautiful~’ the man had his looks of desire, as the female servant name tania feel her hand want to kill this man. But she knows she can’t.
let the curious begin..
A sound of step stop beside him, 'may i sit here?' ask the similar voice.
'stop boy...' a voice whisper beside seem made him jump and nearly made him fall down on the ground.
Draco's muggle word is cute. Likely for me and other fans... Hope agree..
'forgive m-me my lord' said professor quirell in stutter manner once again.
so, let’s travel to this short journey in the past of 1947.
'SIT DOWN!? YOU TELL ME TO SIT DOWN! TELL ME NOW OR I KILL YOU! AHHHHH' Harry eyes seem not normal with the way he looks toward madam poppy.
The time were not change to daylight as it still form as night time. The students and teacher including the headmaster were soundly sleep, but only him, draco were wide awake.
'alright student, slowly put you legs between the broom and before you fly. Slowly lift you upper infront and-' madam rolanda was cut off her explaining as neville seem lost control of the broom.
Very muggle way. Hope dad not faint for his unmalfoy way. He thought as he sees the other still unwake from their sleep.
'you know pansy. You really scared me there.' draco slowly reply as his mind still not use pansy slapping mode.
'you sure, draco?. If you not well just-' pansy were cut off by another voice in the same house, theo.
‘hah…he...lp...ha...hah’ feel her breath seem to loss function to breathe. Is this the-
Whispering the spell to dry his body is simple for him but still not used if not good in potion. Where his godfather, severus snape, teaching the students.
Aka..this book is the one had the mystery on it.
Well..lets the story tell you..
......
‘…up…boy!’ said the familiar voice. ‘hmmm’ the blond boy reply, as he slowly open but seem to bright from him to see.
Innocent smart draco feel nostalgia in being eleven again..
'hello?' he called out, looking for where mr-know-wand is.
'Stop! Everyone proceed walk normal and head student lead the students carefully toward the dorm now!' shout the headmaster as the students quiet down and went calm state toward each dorms.
Hope the warrior win this vote...I just hope it would...
here is short notes (the reason for longest update for just one chapter)
'oh gosh we're late' groan a male voice.
'do you know about fleux?' he curious ask toward the book infront of him.
“drake!”
'thank you harry..you're very nice person' draco smile and once again harry face look red, even his ear is bright red.
‘no!’ draco reply back, without hearing for her to explaining the situation.
‘Awooooooooooooooo!-‘ echo another sound again from the mere werewolf, that seem to be near. Closing her eyes and shutting her mouth very close as she tried not be scared. But do i? she thought.
(… end of the memory)
'for sleepless, the first ingredient is the palm leave, a vcous spell and wait for 3 second then stir to right and left in 17 time. To wake person up, is by mixing the cat hair, leave of lost herbs and a spell of water. Which take 3 stir to right and 10 time repeat the volume of stir to the. left' draco exclaimed his explaning, as the students were jaw drop with the unexpected answer from the malfoy boy. Even the professor look surprise and proud on his face. But only a second before someone seen his real emotion.
'other slytherin? Who harry?' hermione eyes seem lost and feel uneasy to read the book she bought in muggle world.
'who are you' both twin said in same time. Curiously they want to know the blond name.
‘-about 900 votes only. This decision of the vote is closed. With that, the warrior of the young Malfoy is WIN!’
‘dra..co i..miss yo..u’ whisper a voice in the quiet cave, as his both hand is tight and attach on the the big-metal spell between the big stone.
‘ah well... he ermm he ermm’ hermione feel her words is little bit jumpier, draco know she is not good in lying something as well.
Harry smilling like a over the moon. He just finish his 'date' with the blond boy, draco.
'wake..up boy!' the voice repeat that seemly close to his side.
'why?' he ask without any doubt.
'hmm' harry still look on the floor.
‘well… professor… its better his father never knows. I can’t trust that lucius. That’s all I can says, professor’ replied Severus Snape in slow tempo of word, feeling worry for his godson, draco to have this danger.
‘well… who send it to you?-
He wonder if harry is here. He wonder as he look for the sight of boy.
Recalling his worst memory of seeing his family nearly fall apart and knowing the precious memory, he always remember is his little brother, Draco.
That night was worst for him to adjusted the truth..
‘I wonder if I find information about me? I mean me as this woman, I think?’ Slowly Draco reach the doorknob to see that the room is attached to long hallway through.
Well hello dear readers...sorry for the long wait..
'just one last book to read' she muttered in sadness tone as she opens another book, which seem look heavier than the other book. Hermione tried to open but failed ahead,”grrrr!”
Not only that, there is also a scene talk about draco.
‘hmm…crucio!’
Harry puke out the ball and the crowd once again viral, 'the finish point by harry of the griffidor' shout speaker.
‘hmmm...that’s explain it. Well what should we do now?’ draco stare at harry for some clue what to do with the book they been waiting, while hermione coming toward them.
'look, harry. Draco will be there as promise like the letter said and its still half an hour before we or him are there. Seriously harry! I know you like him but this? Is so unlogic to me' hermione face look mused for harry's face turn red for being embarrassed.
‘yep that’s mione, harry~ She still in here, let’s just wait for her to came back from her book time over there’ both boys shake their head toward Hermione messy situation.
‘Draco?’ harry said. He smiles in acknowledgment, ‘do think it will be appear the original page of the book?’
‘I know severus, I know…’
'ohgosh did I just said pretty please!!! kill me now' draco screaming in his head, while looking toward harry in innocent face.
Draco look again before he follow pansy to class, 'coming!!'
‘hah…he..lp..ha..hah’ feel her breath seem to loss function to breathe. Is anyone here? I feel like I had just going through some kind of ritual or cult? Did I really? she thought. But why-
‘wow~’ a female voice sound with a teasing high note tone.
....'wait!! you tell me that, our R.O.N is been use for his blood and why is it must hi-'....
Head spinning as he feel his body complete with another. Like being hit by trunk or truck. He still had issues with muggle word.
'theo.. You're not mad at me draco?' ron looks shock to see draco kind smile give to him.
Hermione feel her breath is getting shallow as the rule of the book really making more mystery. Looking at her friends that also had the same in mind like her, to why ron and who was it? is it ron? or someone else or maybe both. Hermione thinking in mind to figure it out the clues.
Little bit from a man with masked on..which is in the ‘dark desire’ scene.
'draco?' the boy look unease standing too long and see draco still not answer the question.
‘miss granger?’ Cedric wondering why so many expressions changes on the girl in just 5 second.
While the slytherin had the sour look except for pansy and draco.
The crazy was never heard as the room full of soundproof.
'come here..young malfoy..' the voice repeat again, as the bright seem calmly show his way to one of the empty house.
'where did you heard that from, honestly, in the books said that we all will be sorted by the hat. You really had a wild imagine, ron!' said the smart muggle girl name hermione granger, shaking her head for the nonsense the boy talking about.
'look harry got the ball' shout from one of the griffidors.
“fine. What is it that you need so badly for my help, pansy?” ask draco in question with his left eyebrow up, while looking ahead on pansy’s eyes.
‘yeah he is and why you do look hatred about it?’ ask Severus while waiting for answer from the wolf man that suddenly had this mad aura, as this had making Severus melt and fear.
'i i can't' draco feel fear to sleep as his brain ready to be insomnia moment.
The person tried again to called as being near is not affected at all, “ehemm…mia? Is me?”
The game continue forward and back as the leader of slytherin had another plan.
‘laila.. laila.. laila... I wish you just accepted me. NOT THAT man!!! I kill him and your only soul-son, ALLAN!’
'you oke now my boy?' she ask calmly to her boy now hugging her from her side, as if scare for her to be gone.
‘hah.. let me tell you just this once just once. It is from my only friend, Lucius and he need my help. That’s all you know LUPIN!’ said Severus in serious tone as he look the wall behind the amused face named, Remus Lupin.
'ah!' he voice up and smirk for startled harry. Which get him the glare in return.
Hmmmm...
'hmmm sound risky, but oh well im in, how about you, mione?' draco ask in question looking hermione in deep thought.
‘mother? Father? Are you in here?’ said the blond with look similar like his grandfather and that boy name is Lucas Malfoy, feeling standing here was seem so wrong but seem so right. As he stare both his parents as both had tears cover in their faces.
The smart as closebook or
this fleux’s history is still mystery uncover as it became more in detail.
I welcome you my weirdest, confusing of the story i imagine to be.. And don't forget to give kudos hehe and thank you❤
I- a voice stop him to speak in his mind.
‘maybe your mother dra? Cause I know she worried about you, you know’ harry said as he eyes still on draco face.
The mystery book, which remind him that the book is from the time he was chase by some scary people and-
There. The book lay beautiful and as if look at him in anger manner. Strange book.
‘did you get the information?’ he asked, noticing the girl bowed in fear.
Hurrying he push toward 9 3/4 platform, the magic wall where the train for any wizard or witches went.
.........
Draco repeat the question once again toward madam poppy, 'madam poppy? is ron going to be okay?'
As harry get touch with ron hand, 'nooooooooo! It hurt! Get AWAY from me!' ron screaming which made them look fear of the sudden outburst from ron..
Harry gave shoulder up and shake his head as if had no idea where their red hair friend are.
...And the view was perfect for draco and harry had silence comfortable hangout together alone. Without ron or pansy beside them, following...
‘ahhh… yeah I remember that. But what it had to do with what you guys thought about it?’ harry look at them to look for clue of what they trying to says.
'master draco?' a voice of an elf from behind calling stopping his humming tune.
'wait? Ron!!?'
‘thank you harry’ draco slowly feel his throat fresh as he decides to continue again, ‘ehemm where was i?’
'i see' pansy grin for his reaction about harry looks at him.
‘I know, it is tough decision but, we must hurry decide now, people! that man is not patient person’ the mistress eyes stare all the crowded with eyes of expectation, which is the decision is what right for the young Malfoy, name Draco.
*hoot*
Huh. He flutter his eyes slowly and feel the light shone from the non close window beside him.
‘I think it is err red hair heritage if I am not mistaken?’ mione said as she feels her mind is already full of information while harry had the determined looks.
Like how his brother is not part of his childhood time and why draco can’t even remember his brother? For what reason it happens before? Is draco really from Malfoy family? The thought of it always hunt his mind.
Theo run in pain on his face as the minions scramble in hurry follows from behind.
Well..well..im happy to see the amount of reaction for this dramantic story in previous chapter and forward one..
The sound of the crowded student heard from the outside, made her burst to tears, as her body can’t even move and already in his control. His eyes were not someone she knows before as the kind one. He is person that had the kindness, suddenly to be the monster she never aspect he became, which is taking her by force.
Strange indeed. He wonder as he already reach not far from where the sorting hat form.
Wait draco? Harry mind stop as he never receive a present or any package from someone.
'don't fool me quirell! I knew its you that nearly kill potter and made act of troll! ANSWER ME WHY!' the man stand stern which is he, professor severus snape, who always doubt toward quirell fake act.
A secret may reveal or not..
'who doesn't' then the other one said.
'pleaseee!! stop !! I beg you! no! get away from me!! you MONSTer!! nooooo!' the sound of the girl screaming echo the dark room with the familiar guy.
The sound of pain from him had made the man in front of him stop speaking and looking him in worry’s eyes. Just what is going on.
'..boy!' the voice put him away from his mind and look at the book for the disturb.
Feel honour puff in my chest now..
‘what year is this?’ Draco manage to said as he stops the person’s next sentence.
Well well..lets the story begin..
‘yess it seems so!!’
'pureblood?' draco slowly spoke the word that catch his ear.
Slowly he swish his wand, a beautiful glow similar to harry but, in same time different. The glow seem had different tone of colour. Sometime it glow repeat blue then red then it stop white like purely to his blond hair.
HERE IS THE SHORT STORY... warning****
Lucky i use silenco charm. He thought as he see the slythern student still unwake from his disturbing dream.
As harry's eyes focus on the ground than the person laying on the hospital bed.
I love the weird humour about the weasley family and may lose for ron as brat to be.. Rude at first i will gave..need spice than too boring story.
'shut up pansy and first of all that harry is not my boyfr-' draco trying to explain to pansy, but been cut of by seeing harry land safely.
The smell of blood soon appear..
In the very moment..the light glow from the wand and the young boy, draco, glow without for the boy knowing it..
'i...thought you were evil draco. I had a fight with him..i sorry draco for accusing you..' ron bow his head as draco face looks more confuse.
'very good. Now said wingardium leviosa' the professor said again, as the students follow the instruction.
The sorting hat were silence for awhile for the young malfoy to adjust.
And he still feel the strong stare from the boy from his side eye as if he never notice before a few minute ago.
‘ALEX! LUCAS!? WHERE ARE YOU’ shout a familiar female voice make him burst in tears, while hugging his dead brother.
Why me… she asks and ask but only her mind was speaking, she fear to open her lips but she want the truth. Feel her eyes getting heavier and heavier.
‘hmm~ find a way for this boy~ to scream in pain than silent~ its ver~ry not delighted to see~ Clarus~’ said Ursula with her eyes fixed toward the boy named Lucas Malfoy.
Headmaster told ron's family that he in rough fever and need more rest. But. No one knows of his condition as he lay there looking half dead.
Well lets begin the story then 💖🍀
He look to the person who disturb him. There again. The most green forest seem look straight to his eyes without blinking. Feel weird to be watch that long from the boy, harry.
Huh. He flutter his eyes slowly and feel the light shone from the non close window beside him.
With that end, Master of the hogwart name Dumbledore, 'let the sorting house Begin!!'
now lets begin our journey
‘DRACO!!! HARRY IS DYING!’
‘well… who send it to you? Why? And what is it inside? And-‘
'all right..dear malfoy..you in..Slytherin' the sorting hat shout the last pace word of 'slytherin'.
‘there you are!’ Draco froze unmoving as the voice he heard is behind him. With deep breath, his heart beating so fast as the person step getting near and near and even-
Ahh. So theo want us there. Funny. Wonder what he want. Draco look toward pansy and theo in stand closely as he thought funny for awhile.
'ron?! Whats wrong?' harry ask calmly as he moved forward to hold ron once again.
Slowly he went toward Harry’s bed as the figure beside Harry didn’t even notice Draco that standing beside him.
He frowned with the way dobby reaction. Is this what he had done. He thought sadly.
Slap!
welcome again, dear readers and thank you for choosing this book to reads. May God bless you, amen..
The mere morning with the little light of the sun and the sound of wind blow in the ease, which is the meeting is process once again in the forbidden forest. The argument between the lords were nevertheless begin to disagree, rather than agree of its opinion.
‘ahh sorry err so emm what is it that you ask?’ asked hermione who was shutter as now in curious mode of the boy in front of her.
‘boobaboo..nana dada..’ bumbling the baby boy, named Draco Malfoy looking adorable had make the elder brother, Lucas melt in peace.
Severus smile toward her, feeling his anger is calm down, ‘how about this severus, you make the potion and I’ll be company you, agree?’
'dark magic?' he blur in question.
“I think...I should visit mione and you missy! I will talk to you later…gosh pansy” Draco feel frustrated of the lost trust from pansy toward him.
And yes i made ron being brat and realise a mistake he had learn..
'stop right here students, and slowly walk to the hall' as we all stop hearing her command.
Now, the decision…but what is it?
He only got 1 month only for the damn seer book. Feeling desperate as he look throughly over and over again from page 1 to 3.
Other side of room came a person laughing happily for knowing the weasley is injure.
And also, terry boot, which I don’t who is he but he is in the harry potter’s movie, maybe I need to look the movie and books again later... (goodbye terry)
The figure seem read each by each section like a mad person to know the answer of the dream and pain the figure been through.
‘awww~ little drake- ‘
The mistress question again her curious toward tanaka who gave the warm smile back, ‘even if he is Malfoy? You know Malfoy had the bad history before his brother was fool by a women name clara, the daughter of cladorv!’
Sending letter and package is beginning their crush is more than that.
‘don’t worry mistress, we the bodyguard of fleux will protect him till the last of our breath of dead’ said one of the man with the bright green eyes like snake edge shape look.
'theres the pansy i know' draco softly tease pansy for ensure he was oke.
With that, all the student begin repeat the spell.
As soon she reaches to the door, the door was lock, ‘OPEN THIS DOOR TERRY!! PLEASE! SOMEBODY PLEASE LET ME OUT!! PLEASSEEE I BEG YOU!’ she banged the door over and over again but nothing seems to work. Tried to voice up a spell but seem it doesn’t work at all.
Knock
With that, all is dark for the boy to sleep soundly..
'ron? Are you oke? What happen to you? Now you look better than pale' draco look worry as ron bowed his head in shame than answer his question.
'whose him?' ask draco sternly toward mr weasley who still in bows position head.
Other than that, the headmaster also had the meeting with the only professor Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall. Wonder what is it that meeting is about?
‘all I ask is stay for time there and I need space too. I don’t know if I handle to do labor here without being alert 24hr. please honey..i begging you I’m need it..’
‘well..remember when we had to catch the key of the door and you had to fly to get it! Remember!!’
‘that’s it!!’ draco exclaimed loudly as he stares at hermione who stare back at him, as both of them had the same thought it.
'hey? Whats wrong' as the girl in the slytherin, pansy.
No words or answer seem spoken as the man in front him gave a warm heart with his hand holding bread carefully.
......
As she reach there, she called 'draco-' but, she never expect to see, as her eyes feel hurt just by seeing her only boy crying in tears. Which is for first time her boy act as a boy in age eleven years old, like another kid suppose to be..
The silence was comfortable for him. Draco smile in thought as he remember the memory an hour ago with harry. After they both yawn and wave a goodbye in each other.
'draco honey, are you awake?' a lovely sweet voice knocking the red design door cross ahead not far from where he stand.
'in the future before..you were not know about..the book..nor the wand..nor the fleux history that been hidden in..century..you are curse like harry..but different curse..you the young malfoy the last fleux..the bond with werewolf..which is sirius black..your cousin...and lucas..your real brother that...been forgotten...' the sorting book explain the unexpected truth for him to know.
'errmm hey too, harry. Ready for the game?' slowly he speak in gentle tone as his eyes lock with harry's forest eyes.
This book is very darn tight seal, she thought as she feels her body started to feel exhausted as she stays night lighter in the library.
Let’s the curious begin…
He wish his mother never said anything about the forbidden wand to the father. Father happy is not good for him.
'-he is the malfoy and malfoy is must acceptence to be strong for his-'
Once again, Draco tried to called out her name “Hermione!! Mione!! Where are you!?”
Ah~ heaven… said Draco in his mind as his eyes close tightly. Slowly, he feels war-
‘ahhh yeah he will be here soon... he says he go to bring foods and also take some books in his dorm. Why you’re ask, Cedric?’ replied hermione in now serious face.
‘Marly! Where were you! You know that you need medicine potion for your eyes to see-‘ the person keeps rumbling, as he slowly open his eyes.
'draco honey..wake up you need to be ready'  the mother voice in calm tone for her son to heard.
Harry reply in simple, 'don't know' while his eyes stare for draco and ron.
.......
Just why did you come here, Remus Lupin. Severus thought as he and minerva walk to their room to sleep.
"The pain made him to urge to rest and let it heal for moment."
Then, harry seem to ride back to the broom and chase fast toward the ball.
‘GO back to bed. This is between your mother and me’.
'im sorry..im sorry..'he repeat.
Today is the nearly to date of chrismas as the month still stuck in october.
‘-gah! Please stop...i-I don’t know th-that terry is le-leon gah sto- ‘
A heavy breath. ‘erghs…grrrr-’ the sound seems so near but seem so far.
Fear came but had to let go. He thought looking again to her loving face.
The sound of bell seem nostalgia for him, when he got his first wand in his first year.
‘no! you would be in danger staying there! What if it happen you1 like our son Alex happen like!’ stated the fact as the man feature strike beauty among both gender, as his name is Lucius Malfoy while he stare hard toward his wife.
Professor rolanda walk in the middle and holding the ball, which already open the seeker's ball, 'ready! On your mark go!!'
A wand. How long will it be for him to feel the core of magic swelling through his blood line, as it work its magic. But, never thought the time travel can made him a forbidden wand ?. Which just laying there for him as chosen one. Is he? Bit why it called fleux? Or unicorn kind?
'byee too draco' a voice shouted him from behind.
‘-who I’m doing is non of you business’
The sun shine reflected toward the unclose dark green curtain, as each boys still soundly sleep. There the very own same bed of slytherin boy.
Wonder where ron is. Harry thought as he feel more nervous than before.
‘HER!?’ instead of answering, he let go of her legs and walks slowly ahead to the door and lock it tight for his dear vixen, padma.
'...wakeup..boy' it whisper.
“urmmm well... don’t be mad at me okay?”
Draco gave silence answer instead, which made theo face lost his grin victory for not having the malfoy anger.
‘ohmygod! My sons- ‘
hello hello~ dear readers... ehhe as you can see this updated will be full of warning and some weird language I end up make things up.
Feeling been stare too hard, made harry in nervous and anxious moment in same time, 'ermm yeah i think?!'
'ahah, someone dating i resume' that voice really making him blush all over that can beat weasley's red hair.
Is he. He thought as he urge to stay in bed to heal.
Hello dear readers~ sorry for the late update and the long wait as I had writer blocked in my head, ouch!
Both look ron who sound silence and hide behind draco back.
Better tell mother and dad that I found draco.
.....
Some of his skin was smooth but with his scar that making the skin rough that Severus couldn’t take his hands off it. He briefly wondered what he would do if I kissed that spot, right near his wrist. Thoughts of Lily gave him a pause. Lily, who had no answer for his right of forgiveness as his friend was already long gone.
...you may as griffidor...
‘I can’t deny that either, mione. ah..Where is dra anyway?’ harry notice his crush is not here, if he is here. He thinks his red face even more red like chili color.
'don't worry draco, your boyfriend is going to be fine' a voice beside him really know how to tease him alot.
In that very moment, the two boy stay lost in thought closely without any talk at all. Just viewing the view of hogwart's nature.
‘ahh sorry..my cousin name is draco? Is he going to be here soon?’ Cedric’s face had the look of happiness, making hermione in heart throb face.
'hah' harry once again unhappy which seem unnotice around him, that his friends follows behind him giggling seeing his behavior.
With no doubt, he knew with silence report will be cruel pain for him to withstand, especially with the ‘familiar spell’
Draco stare his eyes toward harry as hermione demand in answer as well with their eyes lock toward to him.
“let me explain! I did it becau-“
'forgive me dobby, and yes i need help. How do you know?is it from father or mother?' he curious ask, fear if it is his father who know it all or, his mother who love to support him no matter what.
'he sound ravenclaw' neville stated in proud for the young malfoy who kind than the rest of the family he pass upon.
‘silly little brother! the wind will not run away’ said Lucas in smile, looking his little brother, Alex jumping in excited to play his first muggle game.
'listen up, first years student, today lets begin for the sort of house of ravenclaw, hufflepuff, griffidor and lastly, the slyterin. Each house is unique and lets begin with Hannah'  professor minerva begin her simple speech and ready to called out the student name.
‘YOU THERE! Tell me your opinion for this boy and EVERYONE!! BE SILENCE AND LISTEN!’ command of the women stand tall in seriousness as she stare toward the man that she pointed out.
'YOU GUYSSS YOU CAN BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND AND ERR-' Hermione pause her excited news as seeing draco look exhausted than he was before in the evening.
Ahhh. What night. Draco thought as he still can't help to notice for harry's eyes look at him while he was eating.
The brave appear as smart it came be or
Draco feel confused with hermione’s words. Just what exactly going on here?
Slowly he bravely walk toward the large door.
As she turned left, focusing her silence night working while harrying the seal book. On the sidewalk, she has seen the paintings is having serious conservation on themselves. Worrying occur on her face as she fears that, the ‘fat lady’ is there at the entrances of the Gryffindor for her to enter the dorm safely.
‘leon?’ the girl name padma had the look of confuses again of the name she never knows.
Is this his destiny or...curse? That seem to bind him in strange way.
'well well..what do we have here!' a grin that seem annoyed draco to see.
‘you okay dra?’ eyes worried as the boy-who-lived, harry potter stare toward his crush, draco Malfoy.
'theres the draco i know. By the way, why harry look at you like so long?' pansy smirk become wide as the young malfoy face getting red all the sudden.
'i think he is..i think he is..' hermione repeat the word in proud as well for the boy who stern the statement of honest than hide.
'are you oke?' said draco calmly as he walk near to the person.
How wish if he can be the seeker. But, he know things would be weird for him to join. He sadly thinking as he still heard one of the girls talking about harry as seeker.
‘well..lets just do all of them. It is make sure we’re not miss anything, hermione. So what do think harry? Hermione?’ draco replied while feel sad seeing his friend, hermione had that kind of look of pain.
'errmm' a voice groan from the person who stir from his sleep and went to his back, and rubbing his eyes for why he waking up in this middle of night.
The feet move him to the mirror waiting for him to see. As his feet is stop and he know he is stand infront the mirror. He shut immediately his eyes as if its burn to see mirror infront of him.
'ahhhhhh a spider' some screaming voice from outside stopping from questionning harry's strange behaviour.
(…slowly flashback memory, after Alex Malfoy was death for 3 years in the half. Ms. Malfoy in six month old pregnant)
He wonder if harry heard it. He thought while looking beside harry face look excited and fear for damage he had done.
‘will that man handle for the full moon that will came in this August, headmaster!’ replied severus in furious, knowing the transform of the werewolf may harm the students.
Slowly the figure walk toward the half right section he want search-
'im fine ron. Just too full for this many food' looking at ron's worry face slowly gone and begin to feast the food infront of him.
Please god please…
Feeling dizzy is not a good day for him. Better borrow this book to investigate. He surely need to rest, as he slowly went to the counter librarian to borrow the book, which is far ahead.
'wake.. Up boy.. ' it whisper
He signed in thinking about it. As he walk back to the tall door that served him way to where the slytherin room is.
enjoy and maybe will be long story on the next chapter.
'I think so too, draco. I think this someone or himself is desire something, and we never know it' hermione worry face seem making harry realised that this is serious matter.
The shine morning in Hogwart with sound of the second bell ring, which make the students crowded hurry for their lunch time, before going to the next lesson.
October is letter time as the letter been carry by their owl or other creature. Some had lots some big and some curious package.
'draco?' the voice made him look up as he see his mother smile down to him.
The book were no were found for him. He forget that he had the forbidden mystery book with him that seem lay on the his bed.
As he wonder in thought, when his mother being worry again for his safety and alone 'draco honey? Be safe oke. Don't get hurt and don-'
'forgive me pot- i mean harry.. Well im draco malfoy. It just very nice to meet you' he reply carefully and see the face of the harry made him realise that his answer is right.
“well… I tell her by find the ingredient for the cure in the forbidden forest”
The other scene is about the search of the dark desire. Their finding will be in the chapter of 26.
“well I want to tell you that the letter is already in the Slytherin room and I hoping you would read the letter soon. If that okay with you Draco?” said Cedric who had the big smile, as him and the family was waiting to spend time with Draco.
‘ma-master?’ a female voice stumble as the man aura keeps giving the airy of envy wave around him.
'draco?'
She searches and search as she never feels a time to stop. Wondering how to cast out this thing maybe a curse, which made her react so weirdly and anger she never expect to feel.
Slowly with pale face, he turn. Yes he turn.
'..the sorting hat is there...waiting for you...that seek...answer..go..now boy..' the book whisper, which made draco curiously why the book and sorting hat is know each other?
Hermione still in her struggle mode 'come on Up!' she demand to the broom, which as well going up.
Told you that im going to bring dramatic and maybe classic.
Not knowing harry stick his eyes toward the young draco who busy eating the bunch delicious food infront of him.
Thrust
‘What just happen?!’ asked lucas in thought looking for clue for whats happening so fast toward their happy day.
'well?' clueless harry want an answer, as seeing his friends still in argue state than answering his answer.
'come down here you young man!' madam rolanda shout in worry as neville's broom seem rush toward high and boom.
Draco can’t seem to move or to stop the ritual to happen, 'I..'
'Gosh this is such a nerd!'
The professor, snape, tried to ask again for another question for harry, as if its not over yet, ' well..harry..hope you know what the dangerous terms for making the potion'
.....
.....
Thud! ‘grrr-‘ a very growl sound could be heard, as it seem to be near behind her.
Slowly he sit with lost thought as he see the beautiful view infront of him.
‘but drake I- ‘
Pansy still grinning ear to ear, 'well its your lover boy!'
'draco!!!' the mother sternly shout to his son's door, as the door still locked.
This story is very the longer story I done, maybe? and hope you all readers enjoy this part!
‘harry!’
“but I just-“
'I get that books is important but this is extreme. is she aiming to be a teacher pet?!. so mudblood nerd!'
Why him. Just why.
'...the hat knows..' it whisper again as draco still puzzle for the what the book said.
I wonder if harry is wakeup. He thought as he had another hour to go to wakeup the lazy ass of slytherins.
Hurrying we both run to the potion class.
'miss granger' professor called at last for the girl to answer.
Both hermione and harry nod in agreement, as all the three of them went hurry to the room that they had reserved.
'gosh harry..hurry!!!' shout hermione
Harry..harry.. If only you know. He sadly thought toward the boy who still in weird reaction.
'Harry?' draco calmly called harry in soft voice.
The noon was the beautiful set of the sun surround with the reflect color of red and orange was the nature giving. The meeting to decide for the young Malfoy, draco, was already done.
'it begin when i heard-'
‘-that boy will be protective over our dear warrior, draco the fleux’
The creative thing to mystic or
' She not even a witch blood! why she is here!?'
That night were calmly for all the sleepers in the slytherin room.
Why it help draco?
'well..even if im sort as slytherin, hope you not hate me' he sound stern for the flash he clearly remember harry hate him for being brat.
The strange thing is that the curse stops in every night, however, the curse seems to effect in daily light and even worse in daily afternoon. The young girl named Hermione stared and stared the book that seem to be became useless.
Then a mystery book that seek of him while he was running from wild goose chase from both side.
Brim of light shimmer toward the busy brown-haired girl, named ‘Hermione Granger’ as her will to keep trying with different kinds of spell to open a very seal book in her hand.
The sound of the knocking alarming him, as he feel anxious while holding his forbidden wand, 'who is it?'
‘he looks cute though!’
'whats this' said draco curiously, while holding the odd colour that seem different to another books sitten within the same section.
‘hermione? Are you alright? Is it because- ‘
On the other side of the room, merely screaming voice in a close room full with soundproof that can barely heard a thing at outside door.
Instead of answering to the person near her, Hermione was too focus to the work in front of her as she had worries to think about.
‘where am I… wait?’
Severus ask again in more firm toward the tall man in front of him, ‘What is it that you, Lupin?!’
'huh?' draco looks clueless 'whoes lover are you talking about?'
Thud! Another sound of crash seems slowly. Slowly. And slowly to fade.
‘do you think what I think it is Draco!!?’
‘what do you mean that it is not the copy that you get from this book?’ draco question as harry silence read after draco had done reading the book.
Slowly draco gave warm smile that always making harry feel warm inside, 'well..can you please bring me some food and drink? I really starving, pretty please?'
He had brother. Older one. Draco sadly thinking about it.
“hmm what” said Hermione, without even looking the person near her.
'draco! Letter for you!' shout a female voice.
Yes alive. He repeat the word.
Great grandfather? He repeat again in wonder. Still stay to where he stand and look wary again for the book.
The paragraph seem odd enough for him to understand as he curiously read again the passage, '-that hold a curse upon history of family called fleux. Then may it proclaim to stop evil or good. Either is the side of people they choose but the curse. The curse was only for fleux to cure-'
'are you oke there mr malfoy?!, you look over the weather' mr oliver looking straight him very worry look as if never seeing his face very sick looking.
So, they decide to scare him with their's brother spider. They counted to 3 2 1, and throw to the spider on the blond lap. The twins shut their eyes in fear for the blond reaction.
‘..i do?’
