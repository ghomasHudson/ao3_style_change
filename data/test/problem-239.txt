'You can.  I want you to.'  He touched Harry's thigh.  'It belongs to you now.'  It had still been in the trunk, among his ruined things.  Opening that lid again had tested all of Draco's courage.  But he had to have it, he had to rescue it.  For Harry.
'What...what if I am never ready?'  He stuttered, his feet retreating to the door, steadfast in his determination to not look at the wand that could never belong to him.
The low level silencing charm that McGonagall had cast around his bed prickled his skin.  The room was still empty, his new roommates had yet to come to their own beds.  It wasn't surprising.  Draco knew without a doubt that he would be the sole focus of their angry conversations.  He couldn't begin to imagine the words being said about him.  He didn't care, not really.  He only cared about what Harry must be going through.
'Don't get me wrong, Malfoy.  I completely understand that our Dark Lord was nothing more than a madman, Hell bent on taking what he believed was his alone.  But, he stood for us all, he was one of us, Malfoy.  And you did what you did to save your own skin.  Well, it's not got you very far, has it.'  Nott raked his glittering eyes up and down Malfoy's body.  'A traitor, a whore.  How are things going with Slughorn by the way?  Has he bent you over his desk and fucked you till you screamed?'
'I've always been successful at being an annoying little shit.  Even my own friends had trouble putting up with me.'  His laugh carried no humor.  'A foresight into my future perhaps.  It's little wonder that people didn't stick around.  I've not been a kind person.'
'You should return to the castle.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke.  She feared for Harry.  The boy may have saved the wizarding world, but he was still only that, a boy.  One who had already experienced too much pain and heartache for someone so young.  'Hagrid will take you.'  She beckoned the giant over from where he stood at the stove, pretending to brew tea.
Friday nights always saw the same group of people gathered around the Gryffindor fireplace.  Chatting, reading, ploughing through homework, or, in in the case of Harry and Ron, playing a considered, oftentimes noisy, game of Chess.
Draco would already be inside.  He would be sitting right at the back of the room, where he could keep his head bowed, fingers wrapped around a quill he would struggle to use.  Taking scratchy notes that once read back would make no sense.  Fetching ingredients he couldn't use, trying to read from books that he could no longer comprehend.
'I know.  I wanted to check to see if you were all right.'  Neville stepped into the room, fishing in his pocket for the clean tissue he always carried with him.  'I overheard Ron and Hermione talking about it over breakfast.'
Hermione was in the Library, no doubt tucked away in some quiet corner, studying, always studying.  Neville had his head down, sitting beside the fire, picking his way through an enormous tome about some plant or another.  Seamus was laughing about something, demanding attention, surely an explosion was imminent?  Even the pale-faced interloper was away.
'I'm not running away, Milly, I promise you.'  Theo told her, binding Greg's scarf around his bruised and aching throat.  'I will come back, I swear it.  But there is something I need to take care of first.  Something I should have done a long, long time ago.'
He had done nothing as Draco had pulled away, his hands, his slight warmth, his soft kiss.  Leaving him.  He had closed his eyes as Draco had whispered his final parting, his name just a breath in the silence of their shelter.
'Ah.'  She smiled wistfully, beckoning him closer.  'It is something your father very much disapproves of.'  She offered him the book.  'He believes that this frivolity of mine should be extinguished.  It does not do well to dream, he tells me.  But, Draco, my darling.  Sometimes dreams are the one thing that make a life worth living.  Do you not think?'
'What the...?'  Ron was the first to speak, his unfinished question hanging in the air between the two couples.  One standing in the open doorway, the draft from the hallway lightly banging the forgotten portrait against the stone wall, the other locked together, hands unable, unwilling to let go.
He had loved the boy's mother.  Narcissa was everything that Nott would never have.  She belonged to Malfoy, she was untouchable.  But the boy, he was a story all of his own.
'You shouldn't do that.'  Draco whispered, his voice soft, so close to his ear.  'It's not nice.'  It pained him to say it, wanting more of Harry's gentle caress, needing it to last forever.  But he had to be the one to put a stop to this, had to stop Harry running his fingers over those terrible marks that must surely feel so nasty, so alien to him. It wasn't fair, it wasn't done.
Harry sniffed, taking the offered tissue from Neville's outstretched hand, and edging over to make a space for him on the bed.  'He kissed me, Neville.'  Harry told him quietly, hesitant in sharing the fragile moment with his friend.  'Last night.  He kissed me.  And, well, it was the first time.  But...  It...it was perfect.  I was so scared of hurting him.  But it was perfect.  And now it's over, ruined because we weren't careful.' He tucked the letter under his pillow, it was only for his eyes.  'I'm guessing Draco and I will be the talk of Hogwarts before the first lesson even begins.'
The realisation still didn't stop his legs from failing, it didn't stop him dropping to the floor as he blindly raised his wand into the crushing silence.  Pointing it at the boy he loved.
Malfoy would be on his bed.  They wouldn't have the heart to move him, not yet.  The gasping breaths he had tried so hard to take would have stopped, his sunken chest motionless and silent.  His pale skin grey with death, eyes open and empty.  Would Harry be with him still?  Would he have stayed?
'Are you okay?'  Harry asked him carefully, his hands folding themselves over Draco's stomach.  'You looked like you had been crying earlier, when you got back.  Did something happen with McGonagall?  Did she upset you?'
The strength in his grip was astounding, and Theo could now see for himself how this orphaned boy from the Muggle world had killed the Dark Lord.
Draco paused, stopped.  His hand rubbing at his face.  And Harry knew instantly that he had been crying, probably still was.
Stupid of him to be sitting on the floor of the bathroom while Draco waited.  Clearly in pain, terrified and completely alone.  He was meant to be looking after him, he had promised him with empty words that he he wouldn't be long, that as soon as the bath was filling he would be back to help him peel off his dirty, damp clothes, get him into the water and wash away the heartbreak the Boggart had left him with.
It meant that Draco, however tired he might be, had to endure the journey with only Potter as his aid.
The slow fire began in his shoulders, spreading into his skin and causing his back to cramp with agony.
'But it is.  Look at what Voldemort did to you.  What He is still able to do.  It's never going to go away, Draco.  He has a hold over everyone still.  I...I should have done it sooner, I should have known what was going to happen.'
'Harry?'  She crouched by his side, old enough to know that introspection and guilt would do her, or anyone, no favours.  She could, and undoubtedly would, visit that open wound later.  Right now there were more pressing matters.  'Harry, you cannot stay here.'
“Me too!” Scorpius cried, grining. “But Papa says it’s too sticky - he keeps some in the cupboard for me, though. He’s nice like that. Mummy liked jam too, her favourite was strawberry.”
“Okay then.” Rosie got a look on her face that was very reminiscent of a look her mother wore when faced with a problem. Getting up, she took parchment and a self-inking quill from the desk in the corner of their living room and brought them over to the kitchen table where Scorpius was sitting "Tell me what to say.”
“Not in love!” Harry said quickly. “Confused by. His voice was so comforting and...honestly the way he spoke about love was a revelation. I don’t know if I feel that way, when I’m with Anthony.” He grimaced at his own words. “Merlin, I’m terrible.”
“How fortunate that he turned out to be you, then.” Harry replied, and he was close enough now to reach his other hand out to Draco. “If you’re interested, that is?”
“Well, I work for the Magical Youth Services division of the ministry. It was part of Kingsley's plan for his first year as minister. It’s shocking there really wasn’t anything like this already, given the amount of children orphaned by the first war, but I think that was due to the fact that most of them came from ancient families - like Neville - and they stepped in to take care of the child. No one ever really considered the muggleborn children who were orphaned and grew up with no knowledge of their abilities.”
“Fancy a cup of tea?” Hermione asked suddenly, a slight pink tinge of embarrassment rising in her cheeks when he looked at her in shock. “Only I know how difficult it is, on the first day.”
Harry watched as Malfoy took his soon back to bed and tucked him in - he tried not to be too much of a voyeur, but the soft expression on the other man’s face, the deft way he settled the blankets around Scorpius’ shoulders, the low murmurs between the two of them, all clenched at Harry. How could Anthony not want to be a father?
What he meant to do was review the patent briefs for a shielding cloak he and George had been working on - Harry ran the more serious wing of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes, focusing on protective items and teaching self-defense classes, which had become quite popular even in the absence of the dark lord. While George’s eager brilliance had dimmed slightly in the wake of Fred’s death, his inventions were still stunningly good and Harry tried very hard to be a useful co-conspirator.
“No, I’m over that.” Pansy took off her heels and sat down cross-legged beside Scorpius. “What do you have there, Scorpo?”
He had re-ignited his acquaintance with Astoria at one of Pansy’s Slytherin Gatherings, then spent an entire year courting her and convincing her family to accept his proposal before they were finally engaged. It took another year for them to marry, but from the day she moved in to the manor Astoria had been waving her wand and setting things to rights. The pallor of despair that had settled over its many rooms following Voldemort’s occupation began to fade in the face of the diminutive witch; the dark, foreboding atmosphere had been transmuted by her love of plants and music, her laughter.  When they found out (a mere month into their marriage) that they were going to have a child, they had fun picking out his room, collecting furniture and decorating, climbing high into their respective family trees to see who could suggest the worst ancestral name for their son:
“I guess it was mutual, really. I - it’s sort of stupid.” He takes a sip of tea that he doesn’t really want to fill the silence and stop himself from speaking.
“Oh.” She rolled her eyes. “Freddie is in Slytherin too. Everyone was all upset about it but then they realized they were just being babies.”
There was a cacophony of noise as everyone tried to introduce themselves at once. Ron pressed a beer into Harry’s hand as he and Anthony sat at the table.
He actually seems quite popular as well - one of the witches in the group reaches over to deliver a gentle slap to the back of his head and another throws her arm about his shoulders. All of them are laughing, and it’s a different sort than Malfoy’s laughter was in school, lighthearted and friendly in a way that completely transforms his face. Harry finds himself stepping into the shadow of a cabinet to watch as Malfoy makes a sweeping gesture with his hand and unfurls the parchment, though Harry is unwittingly far more focused on the way his lips curve into a smile and the pleased flush on his cheeks.
“I do, but Ron doesn’t - he was an auror for about three years but hated it. Now he works with George at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and looks after Hugo.”
“Hullo.” Harry said to the room at large. “Everyone, this is Anthony. Anthony, everyone.” A glance at his fiance revealed that Anthony was slightly taken aback by the sheer number of people before him. He supposed that walking into a room with fifteen family members you hoped to impress might be a little daunting. Especially when you were an only child.
It was altogether too much. First, to know that Harry had heard Draco’s innermost feelings on that blasted show, of all places. Second, that he had rejected Draco in the bar. And third, that Scorpius had chosen his letter from all the others that had been sent to them, and now Draco would have to suffer the humiliation of a second rejection.
“You can’t use him as an excuse forever.” Pansy sighed, draining her glasses and searching around for her wand so she could summon the bottle.
“You know her name’s Ginny.” Hermione admonished gently. “Anyway, I think Luna would have something to say about that as they’ve been married for three years.”
“Some of them to Harry, yes. We got into a lot of fights as boys.” Draco scrutinized his son’s plate. “Eat up Scorpius, you’ve barely touched your roast.”
“I-” Harry started, then remembered. His upcoming date, the mysterious man from the wireless. The pull he felt toward that vague possibility. Though he felt a similar yearning now, he couldn’t see a future here, not from this inauspicious start - they might get drunk and fuck, Malfoy was certainly attractive enough that Harry’s body had taken immediate notice of the desire the other man inspired. He also felt a need to know the other man better, find out the minute details of his life. But Malfoy didn't seem to be interested in that, and Harry wanted a real, concrete future. A partner and family. It was plain Malfoy was only looking for a one night deal. So Harry averted his gaze.
Harry was straightening the neck of his robes as he exited, heading toward the stairs when a smaller blonde head than the one he had been tracking poked out one of the doors.
“Well, he was in the DA but I was a little too busy to really get to know him. It’s funny, actually, his office is near Hermione’s - he works for the DMLE as a prosecutor. Hermione and I went to the cafeteria to order lunch one day when I was visiting her, and Anthony was behind us in line. We both got the same order, and I made a joke about how we were perfectly matched.”
“Hermione.” He intoned politely, taking her lead in using first names. Her hair was styled shorter than it had been at Hogwarts, a cloud of neat curls rising up from her head. She wore a black robe open at the front over a purple dress and deep raspberry lipstick that looked lovely against her brown skin. Draco could not recall Hermione ever seeming so put together or confident in school, and he felt rather more intimidated by her now than he had as a boy.
“How do you feel about ice cream?” Harry asks, breaking their gaze and pointing at a corner shop with a brightly painted sign.
Again, the Professor interrupted. “What about you? Do you think maybe you need someone as much as your son does?”
“The two of you will be my death.” Draco muttered fondly as he set the tea to steep and added the final ingredients to their breakfast.
Pansy laughed and muttered something that sounded a lot like what one would call a person who made their living working with clay. Draco glared at her as he pulled away from his son. “Maybe, a long time ago.” He said, tweaking Scorpius on the nose. “When I was at Hogwarts. But that’s in the past and right now I think our dinner is starting to burn.”
“Don’t believe a word he says, Sayeda.” Harry cries, all mock-outrage, with a sly wink at the end that sends the girl into a fit of giggles.
“What exactly is it that you do?” Draco knows that Harry works for the ministry in a newer department, and that it has something to do with children.
“No, I’m here with Pansy…” Draco began, gesturing to the now empty table where she had been sitting. “Or at least I was. I suppose she saw me talking to you and as she can’t see your face, assumed it was the dark haired man she sent me over here to seduce.”
“He’s very good at being my papa.” Scorpius speared another piece of pancake. “I think he would like these. Even though he says sugar isn’t a sensible breakfast food he still lets me have pancakes sometimes. That’s a smart thing to do, even if I don’t always like it.”
“Can wizards marry each other? Do you want to marry a wizard?” Scorpius asked, wide eyed as though his entire world view was about to change.
“A partner who wants to help raise S- my son while respecting his mother’s memory. A person who will forgive my ridiculously expensive tastes and find my eccentricities endearing. I want to look into their eyes and see home.”
“You know, when I met Molly - of course it was at Hogwarts, in my sixth year and her fifth. One day I just saw her, really saw her, for the first time. I was walking down the corridor to potions and suddenly this book landed at my feet. I bent down to collect it and so did she, so I ended up holding her hands. You know, I couldn’t tell where mine ended and hers began.” Arthur laughed self-consciously. “It felt more like magic than anything I had learned so far in school.”
Hermione put her mug down on the coffee table and came to sit beside him, encircling his shoulders with her arms. “I think you need to talk with Tony about this. It’s not something you can go into a marriage without discussing properly. Even Ron and I had to have it out before we got married because there is no way in hell I’m giving birth seven times.”
Astoria’s illness had been a long decline, the degradation and eventual disappearance of her magic over a period of months in a manner that left healers baffled and Draco making reckless pleas to any deity who might still take pity on him. If the gods existed they were not listening - Astoria had spoken her last words before falling into a sleep from which her breathing slowed, almost imperceptibly, to an end.
“You know, James was like a brother to me, but I loved your mum just as much.” Sirius says, as though he can tell what Harry is thinking. “Never a judgement about who a person was or where they came from, and she would not let anyone get away with prejudice. I think part of it came from being a muggleborn, since purebloods weren’t shy about their bias in those days, but she was involved in muggle politics as well. She came back September of our 7th year with a - what do you call it? When you break a bone and muggle healers put that thing on it?”
Sure enough, the New Year spell had been activated and a giant, luminous clock was floating over the mantlepiece counting down the last minute of the year.
Harry looked down at their hands, at the rings on their fingers that were supposed to signify a promise of everlasting union, and felt a heavy sadness descend on him. He nodded. Anthony put a hand out and cupped the side of Harry’s head, one thumb stroking his cheek.
Harry had often quietly wondered about Malfoy over the past twelve years - he seemed to have disappeared after the hearings, at which Harry had spoken in his defense. Harry knew that the Malfoy parents had fled the country upon Lucius’ release from Azkaban (far too early, in Harry’s opinion). The only suggestion of Malfoy’s continued survival were the letters Harry, Ron, and Hermione had received on the third anniversary of the battle. In them Malfoy had apologised for years of bullying and clarified Harry’s suspicions that his actions had been born of a desperate need to survive, not an actual desire for a blood purity war. That the four of them were now standing in the same room, dressed in their finest and about to celebrate together, was such an astounding shift in tone that Harry almost couldn’t believe his own eyes.
“Potter.” He said after a moment, then seemed to shake himself. “What are you doing out of bed, Scorpius?”
“How do you know that?” The child’s question was inquisitive, not defensive as Harry would have suspected.
“Who are you here with, a date?” Harry asked, looking past Draco and down the bar as though an attractive companion might materialize.
Harry groans and re-adjusts his grip. “That doesn’t mean I know how to do this! Neglectful childhood, remember? Besides, you’re clearly cheating.” He twists his hand, sending the line of little green figures twirling, but it’s not enough to stop the ball Draco has shot toward his goal.
So, letting curiosity get the better of him and wanting Malfoy’s attention for reasons he couldn’t quite figure out, Harry jumped into the conversation. “She mentions Scorpius all the time.”
Jólasveinarnir =  Icelandic Christmas folklore depicts mountain-dwelling characters and monsters who come to town during Christmas.
“Now it feels different. I can still sense him there, but I like how it evokes his memory. Him and Remus were the last close ties I had to my parents, so living in the house where Sirius grew up hurt at first, but now it’s a comforting channel to my family.”
Draco groaned inwardly - five pm on the first day of the new year was not his ideal setting for this conversation. Scorpius knew a very edited version of the story, one designed to educate without any of the more disturbing details. The full tale would come when he was old enough to understand it and the role his father had played.
“Tonight we’re talking about Yule wishes. Do you have your heart set on something? Have you been hoping for your dreams to come true? Call in now, we’re listening.”
“This is a wizard from Islington who breeds crups.” Pansy suggested, holding up a lavishly green piece of parchment.
“I do think that inviting Andromeda and Teddy to move in with you is a great idea, though. I know she’s worried about keeping up with him and that old house of hers is getting to be too much work. I think you should ask her sooner rather than later.”
Scorpius shook his head. “Papa, why can’t you just meet the wizard from the letters like you’re supposed to? Why do you have to see this lady instead?”
Scorpius and Pansy got on surprisingly well; though Pansy was an avowed child hater, she always listened to Scorpius’ stories with an air of serious interest. She was also quite involved in the dramas of his primary classroom: in the month since beginning there Scorpius had amassed a surprising amount of stories about his classmates. Pansy listened to them all, from Rose Weasley-Granger’s latest antics to whether or not Maxine Strauss had been right in telling Scorpius she had a crush on him. (“Absolutely not, subtlety is key” was her most Slytherin of answers.) Pansy had also known the Greengrass sisters since their youth and could answer Scorpius’ questions about his mother. Draco listened with a mixture of pain and nostalgia as she talked; though it hurt to hear these memories, he couldn’t begrudge Scorpius the opportunity.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Hermione asked as she began to tidy with her wand, sending dishes to the kitchen and takeout containers to the bin. A dirty sock tugged itself out from under Harry’s left leg and whizzed out into the hall, presumably toward the laundry.
“You’re engaged and you haven’t brought him to dinner before?” Molly demanded, chastising him in a loving but firm voice, happy tears in her eyes.
Neither says a word as the story unfolds, one of a young man’s poor choices and regrets that feels slightly too poignant, the voices rising dramatically till it seems as though there is an operatic chorus in the kitchen.
A couple makes their way over, the woman’s dark curls slightly looser than Sayeda’s framing thick-lashed eyes and light brown cheeks. She is arm in arm with a man Draco assumes is her husband, his skin a similar shade as his daughter’s, hair and beard going grey. They’re older than most parents with a child this age, but they exude an energy that is almost palpable. “Harry” the woman says “so lovely to see you again.”
Draco cowered from the questioning fingertips that brushed against his icy skin.  So cold...  So thirsty...  The man in the dark always wanted to touch him, hurt him and claim him for his very own, no matter how hard he begged, or how much he promised.  It was so dark...  Someone was crying to him in sobbing bursts.  His name, over and over and over again.  Different.  Strange and somehow familiar.
'Never sorry.'  Harry told him, 'We promised.'  He pressed his lips to Draco's sweat damp forehead.  'I missed you too much for sorry's.'
Roaring around the castle grounds, Harry clung to his broom, his hands little more than blocks of ice.  Rain lashing down, wind threatening to tip him from the thin strip of wood clamped firmly between his thighs.
'Go on, off with you.'  He dismissed Harry with a wave, waiting to watch him depart down the corridor.
Even he was struck with horror, with the thought of what he had allowed, as the pale boy wept, shoving his useless body up against the unyielding walls of his Cell, knowing full well what was about to happen to him.  There was to be no escape from the muscled man with a cage around his grinning mouth.
But he had to be sensible, had to be the one to realise that they could never have that.  'You have to stay.  You cannot walk out on your life.  It doesn't work that way.  I should know.'  His fingers tightened in Harry's dark locks.  'It will never be that simple.'  He smiled wistfully, unable to keep his own tears in check.
From behind her dipped glasses, she saw him take out his things from that tatty bag he carried around.  Parchment, a single quill and a pot of ink. Setting it all out before him, ready for a long evening of concentrated study.
He blinked in his surroundings, a hut of some sort, a dizzy recollection tugged, just at the edge of his memory.
The House Elves welcomed the great and good Harry Potter into their kitchen with open arms.  Neville too.  The polite, unassuming boy from Gryffindor who accompanied a sad looking Harry.  He held his arm loosely, almost as if Harry was ill, weak with some ailment that they were not privy to.  Harry clearly needed sustenance, something the House Elves could more than provide for the wonderful Harry Potter.
'It's you.'  Harry turned his eyes from the figure standing in the doorframe and back to his lap, to where he held the letter Draco had written.
There was no warmth to be found here, but it was an ending.  The pain would stop, the evil would cease and he would slip away into eternal darkness.  He could taste it's sweetness, feel it's welcome.
Sleep was not going to visit Harry tonight.  He gave up on closing his eyes to only find them open and staring at the canopy above him, his mind active and refusing to rest.  The gentle snoring coming from the beds around the room irritated him, making him wish someone else was awake so he wouldn't feel quite so alone.  He briefly contemplated waking Ron, before thinking better of it.  Rest had not come easily to the red headed boy of late.  It would be cruel to deny him the sweet sleep of oblivion.
Harry's promise still rang in his ears.  He said he would be back, swore that it wouldn't take long to turn on the taps and fill the bath with steaming water to help wash away the memories.  And then left him alone with a brushing kiss to his hair.
Blood welled up at the tip of the glass.  A single bead that grew under the press of the pretty blue fragment.
He had gotten himself to the edge of the bed, bare feet dangling to the floor.  It was chilly, but not something he would allow to stop him.  His mind made up, his courage summoned and his will determined.  Harry wouldn't always be there to help.  He had to do things alone.
'Oh, he will.  I will not allow the pretty little thing to die quite yet, you can be sure of that.'  His mouth twisting cruelly.  'Do it again.'
'Fred, George.'  Harry told him, sadness in his words.  It wasn't often he spoke Fred's name out loud.  'They gave it to me.'  He swallowed heavily, not wanting to burden Draco with his own upset.  'I thought it might be useful tonight.'
'Yes, and I can't get the image of you in there from my mind whenever I step inside.  I don't want that for you.  Hagrid understands, he knows why you haven't been.'  Harry picked up Draco's hand unconsciously.  It had become as automatic as breathing.
'I'll never be good enough for him.'  A sob escaped as he buried his face into Draco's hair, his voice muffled now.  'I should have known, I should have listened all those years ago.  Stayed where I was, I was safe there, I couldn't hurt anyone there.  None of this would ever have happened.  Not one thing.'
She herself could do all she would to help.  She could help him with his tests, could read to him every day and encourage his efforts, praise his small victories.  But she knew, deep in her heart, that he would never pass an exam.  He would never complete an essay, or finish reading a book.
Merlin, that last kiss.  Right there in the corridor, where anyone who had cared to look too keenly could have seen them both.
The weeks drifted by on clouds of wonder, heated speculation.  Voldemort growing impatient, his time coming, the fight drawing ever closer.
He had battled trolls and men, dueled wizards and fought spiders with knowing only one spell, struck down a monster in the walls with a thrust of a borrowed sword.  He had held Dobby's tiny fragile body as the freed House Elf had breathed his last, knowing only too clearly that the brave soul had sacrificed his life for his own.
'Tell me,' beseeched the Fat Lady, immediately cutting off the chance for the headmistress to voice aloud the password.  'Oh, do tell me, Minerva.  Are the rumors true?'  She wrung her hands together, the dry scrape of paint against paper loud and scratchy in the silence of the hall.
'We have a duty of care to Mr Malfoy.'  Professor McGonagall watched as Madam Pomfrey had to shift a stack of papers across her overflowing desk before she was able set down the two steaming cups of tea she carried.  'But we also owe it to him to carry out his wishes.'  She took the chair opposite, immediately picking up the much needed beverage.
'Draco tells me you have been reading to him at night.'  She spoke quietly, ignoring Harry's latest outburst.  It was not surprising.
'It's late, they are all asleep.'  Harry took up his usual place on the hard wooden chair beside Draco's bed, pulled it in fractionally closer.  Madam Pomfrey had, on numerous occasions, offered to replace the chair with something more comfortable.  An offer Harry consistently refused.  Comfort might bring about sleep.  A luxury Harry could ill afford.
He would take Mrs Norris, they would build a place, nice and warm and small.  Needs met, and see out their days there.
'I don't like it for you.'  Draco admitted, looking into those sad green eyes.  'It's...it's so horrible.'
'You don't get to say that.  No one does.  He wouldn't be proud of me, not now, not ever.  Look at what I have become.  A pathetic excuse of a person, not even a wizard.  Spending my nights crying on Harry fucking Potter!  I'm a disgrace to the Malfoy name!'  Staring down at that plain cardboard box on the table, directing all his fury to it.  'I can't even touch a wand, what does that tell you?'  He swept his hand over the table with force, sending the box, and it's contents across the room, where it bounced harmlessly off the wall, sending a picture askew.  The wand tumbling to the floor.
There was nothing more than this cold, hard, disgusting touch.  All of them, so many of the glittering masks, the black cloaks, the torment beginning anew.
A useless piece of throwaway ephemera.  Pointless, designed to be forgotten, made to simply be tossed inside a draw already filled with clutter by countless young wizards across the country.
'I've been watching you for weeks.  You never sleep in your own bed anymore.  You leave when you think everyone is asleep.  'Well, not everyone has been asleep, Harry.  It all makes sense now.  You've been going to him.  You've been seeing Malfoy.'  Neville leaned against the wall, his arms folded across his chest, clearly not intending to be fobbed off by Harry's lies.  His eyes shadowed in the gloom.
He could already feel the chill of the covers against his legs as he climbed his way into bed.  He wouldn't sleep, he wouldn't.  But still the lure of comfort, the soft pillows at his back, the heavy fullness of the duvet, all called out to him.  And pulling a tome of Ancient Runes onto his thighs, he began to read.
The Fat Lady made no comment when Harry whispered the password so very early.  He hadn't been back all night, out roaming the halls no doubt, unable to sleep again.  She allowed him entrance, the despondent, red eyed boy was on the verge of tears, she realised sadly.
Draco's eyes were heavy, it took all of his remaining strength to open them, to keep fighting towards that voice that pulled him away from the darkness.
It would be almost effortless to do it again, tighten his grip just that little bit more, crush the Slytherin's windpipe.  Twist his hand to the right, break his fragile neck.  He would die easily then.  So very quickly.
'He can't.'  Harry told her.  He couldn't help but feel self-conscious by the way Draco held onto him, by the way he held Draco.  His cheeks flushed as he looked up at the woman who had cared for him multiple times during his childhood.  He cleared his throat, forcing down the embarrassment.  If Draco needed this, needed him, then he could have it, no matter who saw. 'He still doesn't dare close his eyes.'
She could easily take out her wand and as quick as a flash she could have both the weary boys safely ensconced within Gryffindor's walls once more.  But for Draco magic only meant fear.  Silent screaming and sickness. Darkness and voices from beyond.
'You don't have to do anything you don't want to, Draco.'  Harry told him.  'This is entirely up to you.'
'Harry, what the fuck?  This isn't you, this isn't right.  You hate him!  You can't be doing this, you can't be...be kissing him!'  Ron forced the vile word from his lips, the very taste of it twisting his stomach into a sickening knot.  'Have you forgotten everything?  You hate him more than you have ever hated anyone.'
'Silence!'  McGonagall's boom rang throughout the broken corridor, harmless sparks flying from her clutched wand, scattering across the ceiling and making a couple of the students scream in surprise.  'All of you!'  Fury clouded her voice, her eyes blazing as she raked her gaze across the now shocked silent crowd.
Only it kept happening.  Night after night Harry followed that same routine.  He would get into bed as the others did, the usual chorus of 'goodnight' echoing around the room.  Shouts of laughter and sometimes catcalls as curtains were dropped.  Then there was silence.
'Lie back for me, sweetheart.'  She was standing by the bed, leaning over him, her hands reaching towards him.  His mind beginning to stray as she bent forwards.
The knowledge that once again Harry kept his distance brought unwanted tears to Draco's eyes.  Harry stayed away because of him.  Again.
'I want it back.'  Ron broke, his head falling to her shoulder where he was quickly gathered close, his words muffled in her robes.  'I want my friend back.'
Draco could not look at Slytherin.  The small group clustered at the end of the table, muttering under their breath about his limp, his scruffy hair, his dark shadows.  There was uncertainty behind those calculating eyes that lit on him throughout the meal.  They knew that something was very wrong with their erstwhile Housemate.
Betrayal.  That one word would end his life with Draco.  Would put an end to everything he never knew he needed.  To surrender this strange new friendship would break his heart.  To walk out of this room once and for all, to say goodbye...
Neville set the water within reach of Harry.  Getting to his knees, he began packing away Draco's only belongings.
'Where do they think you are?  Your friends?'  Draco took the offered bowl, balancing it in his lap.  He asked the question that had been bothering him for days.  He made no move to pick up the spoon resting in the cloudy liquid.
Books and parchment, broken ink bottles, spilling their black contents into the cracks.  As deep and as dark as the blood of Draco's nightmares.
Hagrid stood in front of the closed door to the hut.  It was his home, he shouldn't be afraid.  But still his hand paused, fist ready, but unwilling, to knock against the wood.
Reading the letter over and over and over again did nothing to help, it was scant consolation that Draco was still in the castle, he wasn't here, with him, and that was all that mattered.  He was out there, alone.  He wouldn't sleep, Harry knew.  He wouldn't eat.  Sandwiches made in the kitchens would only sustain him for so long, and dining in the Great Hall just wasn't an option.  Draco had cut himself off so completely that Harry was afraid he would never return.
Guided gently by this Neville, Harry was made to sit as they set about their task with unbridled glee.
'Thirsty.'  Draco gasped, precious drops of water escaping down his chin.  'Can't...  Can't remember...'  Water.  How long had it been since he last had water?  Aunt Bella?  No, that wasn't right.  This morning?  Water for breakfast.  Toast forgotten.  Butter and jam making his stomach turn.  But that wasn't right either.  The corridor...  McGonagall's sharp rap on his shoulder...  Harry's rejection...
'I...I've h...had worse.'  He stuttered, sucking in a breath when her hand returned to his stomach, the weakened muscle quivering under her fingers.  He wanted to scream at her, wanted to bat her terrible hands away, dash the stinking, useless potion across the walls.  It wouldn't work, why should this one be any different to the rest?  How could she not see that?
He would never, ever admit it in words.  But it was there.  The pain of seeing his broken brother at the breakfast table each and every morning had become a pain that he was struggling to bear.
It was the haunted look in those grey eyes, the sunken pallor of his thin skin, and the way the borrowed robe hung around his once lithe body.  Now wasted and fragile.
She saw him raise a barbed whip already crusted with blood.  Flecks of wet red splashed across his familiar cheeks.  Cheeks she had once kissed goodnight.  His thin lips curling into an unsparing mockery of a smile as the lash came crashing down.  Over and over.  And over again.
'Yes, I am also aware of this.  He has agreed to some one on one lessons with me regarding this matter.'
A creak of a door, heavy iron scraping against the stone floor.  It was a sound he was only too familiar with.  It signaled more pain, more hurt, more everything.  He couldn't see, could only feel as something different happened this time, a fresh torment as he was roughly picked up by cold hands, carried into the freezing night.  His back screamed in silent agony, deep cuts rubbing against the figure that held him in a devils clutch.  He was dying, why wasn't he allowed to let go?  Why this constant stream of Hell?
Madam Pomfrey would take them away in the morning as she brought him breakfast.  Eggs, a slice of bacon.  Orange juice and toast.  A pot of tea.  Always enough for two cups.  She would pour it, sugar for her, milk for him.  And she would sit, watching, chatting as he managed a bite or three of toast, a swallow of egg.
'Sorry.'  Harry whispered again, allowing the gown to fall into his hands.  'That's better.'  Smiling, he gathered the fabric up, tucked it under his arm.
'Don't.'  He grit his teeth together hard, his jaw protesting under the pressure.  He didn't trust himself not to draw his wand against his friend.
'No.  It's okay, just a little sore.  Don't...don't stop.'  He could hear himself begging.  Ashamed by the note of desperation in his voice.
The nightmares that took him when Harry was away were unthinkable.  Real, sickening.  Every touch, every spell, every single event burning into his skin.  But Harry didn't need to know that.
'Self preservation.'  Draco sighed, his body heavy.  'I'd even settle for the rain right now, anything to be out there.'
'He won't see you.'  It pained him, but Harry had no choice.  He wrenched his hand from Draco's clinging grip.  'You have to trust me, Draco.  I won't let anything happen to you, I swear it. Trust me.  You'll be safe here.'   Harry was already turning away, leaving him to sit alone.  Ready to meet Filch head on.
'I'm sure it was an accident, Ron.'  She placated him, 'Harry didn't mean the things he said, and Malfoy, well, he's not been the same since he came back.'  She added thoughfully, giving the silent blond some much needed consideration.
'You continue to defy me.'  A heavy slap, a split lip and the metallic tang of blood filled his mouth.  'You will do whatever I wish, you will grant me all I desire.  You forget, you belong to me now, your parents cannot help you.'  He stood, monstrous over the boy cowering on the floor.  With a flick of his wand, the decomposing bodies stopped their harrowing charade, crumbling to the floor in a clatter of putrid flesh and bones.  'I will have you whipped for your insolence.  Let's see how well you defy me after your pretty little back is softened once more.'
A hush that grew, whispered words held behind hands soon became excited chatter thrown across the crowded space.  Tears still flowed, shock still etched on faces that had seen their own family in Draco's fears, but still the voices exploded all around them.
'It's all right.'  Draco forced a smile, 'I promise, it's all right.'  He stroked Harry's tentative smile, blushing when Harry kissed his fingers.  'You don't need to worry over me.'
The name spilled from him, shame colouring his cheeks.  He had broken in the worst way.  He had admitted out loud that he needed someone.  Harry.  He needed Harry.  His body shook, unable to control the shivers, the desperate sobs that burst from his aching chest.  He was reduced to nothing, a broken body filled with pain and humiliation.  He wanted the Harry Potter from last night, wanted that soft, comforting voice, those warm, gentle hands.  He wanted the Harry who had stroked his hair and made him feel safe.  He wanted to be taken into arms that would hold him, make the pain go away.  Arms that would never let him go.
'I know you are good at Chess, Ron, but even you can't play alone.'  And leaning his weight against a chair, he forced a smile from lips that still burned.
'Are you back with Ginny?'  Neville crossed his legs.  'Because I know she was with Dean tonight.  And you are out there,' he waved his hand around.  'Flying like a man possessed.  Something has gotten you angry, hurt.  Are you jealous of him, because I've never seen you like this before.'
And then Harry could be free, able to forget this brief, unexpected interlude on his path to a better life.  A life filled with happiness and light and most of all, love.
'You were dying.  If Snape hadn't come...'  He shook his head, consumed by the terrible memory.  'You were upset, and I nearly killed you.'
'I do understand, Professor.'  Draco reached over the desk and touched the back of Slughorn's hand.  'Voldemort broke so many people, there are none who came away unscathed.'  Draco couldn't help notice how Slughorn's eyes caught sight of his scars as the ill fitted sleeves of his robes rose up.  Circles of red torn into his skin from the shackles he wore for so long.
Draco knew that if he didn't force his feet to move now, they never would.  He would be trapped here, in the middle of a crowd of rowdy, confused Gryffindor students.  People who hated him, people who would soon grasp that he was the sole person to blame for the divide in the eternal friendship between Harry and Ron.
'They said I was useless, said I was a freak.  They always said I would never be important to anyone.'  Harry's upset little more than a breath in the silence.  'Look at what I have done to him.  I can't care for him, not in the way he needs.  They had it right all along, I was just too blind to see it.'
Curled up on a filthy floor.  Nothing more than a ruined mess of pale skin, streaked with blood and defilement.  Words and blurred symbols crudely carved deeply into a body that knew no comfort.
'I'm shutting up for the night.'  She told him, almost kindly.  Pausing as she considered her next words.  'I can walk you back to wherever it is you want to go.'  Her quick, curious glance told her that the fresh piece of parchment he had unrolled hours ago remained exactly that.  Blank.
Of course he had slept thought the night, thank you for asking.  And yes, he had indeed finished all of his breakfast, and of course he had not been crying into the dark night, wishing for someone who was lost to him.  The muscles in his face straining at the pretence of a smile.
They would share sweets again, wouldn't they?  Harry would take pity over his tight ball of mangled corned beef sandwiches and spend his pocket full of gold on treats from them to eat in their solitary carriage.  Harry would show him his scar once again, and watch, rapt as Ron tried to turn his pet yellow with a clearing of his throat and a borrowed spell.
'I have gossip!'  Seamus declared, both of his hands slamming noisily onto the table, making cutlery dance.  'And even you will be interested in this, Hermione.'
Sirius is leaning back in a chair with a bottle half-full of mead in front of him on the table. A muggle record player spins at its center, the volume turned down so that at first, Harry isn’t sure he can hear anything at all.
In the twelve years since their first hesitant conversations Andromeda had become the aunt Harry wished Petunia could have been, and his occasional care of Teddy had made Harry realize that whatever else he did in life, he wanted to take care of children. Moving the pair of them in Grimmauld seemed like a good start.
Harry sighs internally - alright, he’s not happy, and clearly neither is she. But he still doesn’t know why they have to break up instead of working through it. Ginny had said that she didn’t want them to hold each other back. What had she meant by that?
“Papa?” Scorpius’ voice was muffled against Draco’s shirt. “How did you know you liked wizards too? Did you ever like a wizard before you met mummy?”
Harry smiled his thanks to her and took another pull on the beer, indulging for a second in the comfort of his family. Arthur had fallen immediately into conversation with Anthony about his half-muggle upbringing, with Rosie listening intently from where she sat in her grandpa’s lap. Molly bustled around putting down plates of food with help from Percy and George. Angelina and Ginny were leaning across the table now to introduce themselves, the latter taking Anthony’s hand in her vice grip to shake it. Ever since they had broken up eleven years ago (coming out to each other in a flurry of laughter and tears) Ginny had been the most ferocious of the Weasleys, interrogating Harry’s dates whenever she got the chance. Harry had never been able to return the favour - it was clear that Ginny and Luna were well suited to each other. They had been together almost since Harry and Ginny had split up and Harry had officiated their wedding (in bright yellow robes he hoped never to see again) three years previous.
Weasley chuckled at this. “Rosie was still wide awake when we left her with mum. Poor thing has never gone up against Grandma Wealsey about bedtime before, won’t know what hit her.”
Harry’s mouth went dry. He had not imagined that his quick stop in for a drink would culminate in Draco Malfoy practically whispering in his ear about how he wasn’t actually straight at all. Let alone in a voice that felt like a jolt of lightening to Harry's insides. He also hadn’t realized how attractive Draco truly was till that moment, the other man leaning so close Harry could smell him - a hint of cloves and expensive soap. Malfoy’s voice had a certain quality at this timbre, it reminded Harry of something or someone he couldn’t quite put his finger on. Malfoy seemed to be enjoying the surprise on Harry’s face as he smirked and leaned back only fractionally, finishing the cocktail he had been drinking before starting in on the wine.
“Only because you cheat!” Harry exclaims. “If you make me go to another terrible film like that one last week-”
Pansy sighed but stopped herself before the temptation to roll her eyes overtook - she had long ago promised Astoria to support Draco, and directly countering him in front of his son seemed like a bad way to keep that promise. So she did as the young boy said, reciting the words of the spell and waiting for the letter to glow gold. When it did, she neatly detached the wax seal and began to read it aloud:
“It’s so he knows we’re interested in him as a person.” Scorpius said - he was parroting something he had overheard his Aunt Pansy say to his papa, though it had been slightly lost in translation.
“Oh did he?” Again, the searching look. “Well, send us a message and we’ll arrange something.” She puts her arm around Sayeda, who has begun to lean against her. “This one has crammed herself full of candy floss, and I’m afraid that if we don’t get some real food into her soon she’ll crash from all the sugar. Lovely meeting you, Draco.”
'No.  No, it's all right.'  He began to gather up his few belongings, shoving them untidily into his bag.  'I...I..  It's fine.  T...thank you.'
'Make me understand it, Harry.  Give me a reason why you are creeping out at night to be with the bastard who made your life, all of our lives Hell for so bloody long.'
'You are killing him!'  Harry couldn't stand it a moment longer.  The sight of the painfully writhing boy was too terrible to witness.
'Merlin, Draco.  I'm so sorry.'  Harrry turned at the sound of Draco's utter despair. He went to him, dropped heavily to his knees before him.  'I...I don't know how to do this, I don't know how to make things right.'  His head falling onto the bed, voice muffled against the covers.
'Harry, it's all right.'  Draco consoled, his thumb rubbing gentle circles over his hand, down his wrist.  He too had heard the Fat Lady and her muted voice.  Yes, she had not been friendly, she had not been kind.  But he understood.  'It doesn't matter anymore.'
The tatty bag, carried by the tatty boy.  The boy with stripes across his back and blood hidden under his sleeve.  Glass in his hand and tears in his eyes as he sat alone in the potions cupboard, as Ron had walked away from the sight, refusing to help, to even acknowledge that there was anything wrong with him.
He had promised him, sworn that he would do nothing, say nothing.  Pretend that they hadn't spent the last months chasing away nightmares, wrapped together in blankets, hands stroking, calming.
Several people turned in his direction as Harry's feet carried him through the smiling portrait hole and onto the threadbare rug.
At first the idea of taking gratification from male flesh turned his stomach.  He had never given it much thought before, his inclinations didn't fall that way.  But...  This child, this boy, so much like his mother.  Once a pale beauty.  Soft, tempting skin and waves of white blond hair.  Gentle limbs and a stillness that made his body ache in a way he hadn't believed possible.
'It has been agreed, you shall be ignored by everyone.  Not one single person is going to speak to you, look at you, adknowledge your existence.'
'He's sleeping now.'  McGonagall spoke to the nurse standing over Draco's resting body.  'He was so cold, Poppy.'
'Yeah, probably because he thinks I did it on purpose.'  Harry continued to seethe.  'He said it himself, we don't even like each other.  He must think I did it out of some twisted form of revenge.  I should go back, leave him be.  It clearly would be better for him.'
Laughing, joking with Neville.  Not a care in the world.  Stuffing his greedy face with the efforts of the overworked House Elves.  Hardly a thought about the boy in the bed.  A boy who's broken sobs would haunt his nights, follow him to his grave.
'Yes, most of the time.  I had to make their bed, my cousin's too, when I didn't have one of my own.  I hate them for that.  So many time I wished I could get into one of the beds I had just finished.  It always looked so soft and inviting.  But I knew I would only get punished.'
'Why would Dad make that up?'  Ron asked, turning to Seamus.  'It wouldn't surprise me if they blew it up themselves, just to get rid of any evidence that would land them in Azkaban.  Maybe they aren't in France at all and they are already locked up and it's all being kept quiet.  That would explain why Malfoy stayed here for Christmas, and perhaps why he doesn't want to be in Slytherin anymore.'
In Draco's dream the sound of a door opening brought in the night.  And voices.  The same rough one from before, but there was another one, a softer one.  A voice that he knew well.  The name of the owner escaped him. He tried to grasp hold of it, but it slipped through his memory like liquid, impossible to hold on to.
“He’s coming here.” Neville said, and he didn’t need to form it into a question to know the answer. He looked away from Harry, and at the students around the room. Some were as young as first year, they were chatting away among themselves, their energy revitalised by the healing potions and by seeing Harry and Ron returning.
“Where were we up to?” She asked as she draped her bag and outer robe over one of the two spindly chairs that were set up next to the single small study table that had been provided in that area of the library. She rolled up the sleeves of her school shirt and bundled her wild hair up in a large bun at the back of her head.
Warning for a dialogue heavy chapter. I lost the first version of this one and I really struggled to re-write it, so it became a bare bones type of chapter. Hopefully it still gets the plot across.
that he didn't even know if he could take a date. Would Potter expect them to go home together? There was never anything formal uttered between them. They never made promises of coffee, or lunch, or a drink. They just fucked from time to time. Which surely meant that Draco was single?
” Harry looked up and smiled, and though he couldn’t have known where Draco would be standing, it almost felt like Harry was looking directly into his eyes.
“You saved us a lot of hassle.” Harry said, “We weren’t getting anywhere with the RAB clue.”  Without a list of everyone who had ever been allied with Voldemort, of which there were a lot, Harry didn’t think they would ever have been able to work it out.
“This way Mr. Dray, come sit next to me.” Albus beckoned him down the hall, leading the way with Draco in the middle and Harry and Lily bringing up the rear.
“It looked like the one you’ve been dragging around everywhere. Thought I’d best grab it just in case it was Slytherin’s.” Ron flushed and grinned at Hermione’s admiring gaze and Harry’s praise.
Harry absentmindedly nodded. He felt cool latex covered hands manipulating his forearm very slightly, and then the chair he was sitting on was being adjusted, a little further up, a little to the left. The skin of his arm was being wiped down with a damp paper towel, and then a low humming buzz began to fill his ears. Harry lost himself in the feeling of the slow drag of needles across his exposed skin. It was neither pleasant nor unpleasant and he resisted the urge to reach over and scratch at the annoying push and pull of the man’s fingers. He leaned his head back against the rest instead, and closed his eyes. The music overhead (Rock? Metal?) drowned out the buzz until he almost couldn’t hear it anymore. He could hear people standing out on the streets below, Muggles chatting and shopping, having no idea what was in store for them in the future.
Harry looked at the shimmering surface of the golden locket. He could almost feel it calling to him and his scar prickled uncomfortably in return. He thought about how his magic had reacted to Draco the first time they had allowed themselves to feel more than hate for each other, the way it had prickled under his skin desperate for the touch of his Soulmate. It made Harry queasy to compare the two, their Soulbond was nothing like the dark magic that Voldemort had used.
“Mate.” Harry turned from the window to look at Ron, “There’s no other way?” He already knew the answer, but he had to ask.
“I just couldn’t see anything or hear anything and I got a little overwhelmed.” Harry scrubbed a hand through his hair, embarrassed to admit his failings but preferring it over the other option.
“I should go anyway.” Draco opened the door and stepped out into the night. The cool early spring air brushed across his heated and flushed skin and gave him a little relief from the almost innocent encounter that they had just shared. Well...Innocent compared to their other encounters.
“It was after your Defence OWL, I saw what you did to Snape.” Sirius was silent, he was blinking slowly, waiting for the question that he was sure was about to come, “Was my Dad a bully?”
"Merlin!" Draco gasped out against Potter's mouth, but he didn't fight it as Harry carried him down the dark corridor and pressed him against Draco's own office door.
“Wait!” Harry caught Ron’s wrist as he went to lift the glass, “Protection spells.” He explained when Ron raised an eyebrow.
Thank you all for the lovely comments! I read every single one of them and I'm replying where I can, each one brings a smile to my face and makes my day just a little better.
“This is it then?” She asked into his shoulder, so quietly that Harry almost had to strain to hear it. He was sure that everyone in the room was thinking the same thing, but of course it would be Pansy to ask the question.
Harry reluctantly left her leaning against a pillar and he turned to the rest of the group. They were swarmed around Ron, who was handing out healing potions left right and centre. He had shown Harry the contents of his bag when he had returned to his and Draco’s room, apart from a whole host of Weasley Wizard Wheezes defence products, it was filled almost to the brim with potions of all kinds. It seemed as though he had raided Draco’s stash. A stash which Harry had seen first hand, a hundred healing potions wouldn’t even be missed.
"Expecto Patronum!"  His wand didn't even produce a non-corporeal wisp. He could feel his magic pushing against the barrier, trying desperately to come to his aid, but the constraints held. He watched in horror as another Dementor leaned in to Draco. He could hear the deep rattling breaths from where he stood., but they were ignoring him, feasting on the Slytherin instead.
"Are you gonna get us out of here then?" Draco asked. The Dementors had fled from the street, leaving behind them an eerie, almost too calm, silence.
“I want you.” Harry said, Draco expected him to leave it there, but he forgot that there was a reason Harry was a Gryffindor, “I want you now, I want you next week, I want you next month. However long you want me, is how long I want you.” There was no misunderstanding that. And the words hung heavily in the air. Saying something like that in the heat of a passionate moment was one thing, but here, in the silence of the broom shed where the passion between them had dulled to a strange frisson in the air, it seemed almost too raw. Too real. Maybe even too much, for one person to handle.
Apart from that. I have to say that I love each and every one of you. You've stuck with me through two and a half massive fics and supported my fanon from the beginning. You're all wonderful, the kudos and the comments have pulled me through to the end and motivated each and every word from A Forgotten Promise onwards.
Harry’s nose was full of the unmistakable smell of sterile equipment, he almost felt like he was in the Hospital Wing, and Madam Pomfrey would come by any moment to give him another dose of whatever Potion he needed. But there was no hospital and no magic in sight, the room was full of electronic equipment. A radio playing the music which was drifting overhead, a TV showing the news with the sound muted and the subtitles turned on. It was as Muggle as possible. That’s why he had chosen this place. He could have gone somewhere magical of course, but everyone knew who he was, and half of those people probably wanted to kill him.
“Would you like to go out for dinner? Sometime?” Draco blurted out. It had definitely not been in his plan. But he found that he didn’t have time to regret it, because Harry’s confused expression transformed into a shy grin.
“You have to mean it!” Harry shouted above the buzz of Hogwarts students casting Stupefy on each other, “Remember the movements, keep it fluid. Duelling is all about being fluid, the end of one spell has to form the beginning of your next spell.”
aren't anything, Potter. We fuck. And then we regret it the next morning. I apologise for wanting to spend my evening with someone who actually wants to say more than
One of the hardest chapters to write and I think I re-wrote it a few times. What was in my head was refusing to be translated into words haha. But I hope it all came across okay. After a few re-writes it starts to get tedious haha.
“Good point. Yeah, let’s practice those before the next lesson. I think we should finish stunners next and I think move onto Patronus after that. I think that one will take a few weeks to learn and it’ll give everyone the motivation they need over the Christmas holidays.”
“You wanted to talk to me about something?” Harry asked, when Draco’s hand was already reaching for the door handle.
“I can’t find Ron.” She was wringing her hands together and Draco had to reach out and pry her fingers apart to stop her from fidgeting.
"James! Away from the door, don't you dare-" Oh no, the children were home, Draco turned to flee before any of the Potter children could see him but the door was already swinging open and a short mini version of Harry Potter stood on the other side. The Mini-Potter grinned up at him with a smile that had a tooth missing to one side.
“I think that is supposed to tell us.” He nodded at the single memory vial that was out of place in the middle of the neatly made bed.
“We weren’t perfect, Harry.” Remus said. And Harry knew that. He really did. Sirius took the mirror back.
He slowly reached out. He felt the magic tingle against his fingertips as he pressed his palms to the glass. But nothing else happened. Just the tingle of familiarity, the acceptance of his own magic coming into contact. Dumbledore had built a back door into his protections, one just for Harry.
"The She-Weasley. Your Wife." Draco continued to dig his own cockblocking grave, but he couldn’t stop his mouth from spewing words. He had never been one to mince his words, but Potter always brought the worst out in him.
I would like to apologise and explain my use of the word "Fag" in the context of a homosexual relationship. It's not a word I approve of and it's something I regularly call people out on, it's a horrible term and as I had Draco say, extremely derogatory. However, I do think that it is indicative of the times and it is a term that would have been used commonly in the 90's when HP is set. I hope I haven't offended anyone and if I have I apologise and I hope you can understand my reasoning behind the use of this word.
Short one today. I felt like the last chapter was running a little long, so I decided to split it into two :)
“I don’t think being good in bed has any relevance on the purity of a soul.” He said, but he accepted the leg that Draco was throwing over him and he guided Draco’s lithe body down into his lap.
“Is this Dumbledore’s memory?” She asked, it was the first time Hermione had seen it and she looked down at it with careful consideration. Her earlier franticness was forgotten in light of the mystery that awaited them. Draco just nodded as he leaned over the side of the bed to pick it up, “I thought Harry hadn’t watched it yet?”
Thank you to all of my wonderful, amazing, supportive readers. You've made this such a pleasant experience. I've never written anything as monstrous as this trilogy and I massively look forward to sharing the next one with you. Unfortunately it's yet to be finished, and I prefer to finish my fic before posting so that I can keep a daily schedule. It won't be another 140,000 word behemoth though, it'll be shorter and will hopefully be a nice little closer to Harry and Draco's story.
I'm so excited for you all to read the next few chapters, I honestly impressed myself. I re-read them and I can't even believe that I wrote them, it just feels like I'm reading someone else's Fic hahaha
“No, it’s okay. He might be able to help.” Help calm you down, Harry wanted to say, “Well you know how I’ve been doing Occlumency with Snape-”
.” Draco watched as Harry pulled out a piece of parchment and spread it out flat on the bed, he leaned over Harry’s shoulder to read the cursive words that were scrolled across the parchment, copied out by a magical quill somewhere in the depths of the Ministry of Magic. He hadn’t known that Harry had a copy.
One chapter to go! Plus a cheeky little announcement ;) so please stay tuned after the next chapter.
Hardest chapter to write ever, big battle scenes are really difficult to keep everything clear and keep the plot moving at the same time. I hope you can all forgive me from taking this from Draco's point of view and skipping all the most difficult parts to write haha.
Draco glanced down at Harry once again. The Gryffindor had his eyes completely fixed on Draco. He appreciated it, even though he knew that there was an entire game that Harry was ignoring in the background. And then, Harry’s eyes darted past him. Looking intently at a spot at least twenty feet behind his left ear. Harry had seen the Snitch. Draco whirled around. Still not entirely sure which direction he was going in, but he trusted Harry’s impeccable instincts. He was already streaming in the direction of the Snitch when he finally saw it. A delicate blur of gold, it’s little wings beating so fast that it would have been out of sight within seconds if Draco hadn’t already set his eyes on it. Thank Merlin for Harry Potter.
Educational Decree Number 27 was created after breakfast was over. Harry just laughed at the sign stating that anyone in possession of the Quibbler would be expelled. The students of Hogwarts weren't so easily swayed when it came to Harry Potter gossip. Throughout the afternoon a slew of charms started making their way through the student population, all of which only made it easier to help the students pass around the Quibbler.
.” It was infiltrating his mind, reading his thoughts, trying to turn his own thoughts against him. Draco was his Soulmate. His soul was whole with Draco by his side. He didn’t need Voldemort's dark magic to be whole.
.” Harry folded it back up and closed the drawer snugly. Draco’s knees were starting to shake now, and his eyes were starting to prickle and water. But he wasn't about to cry, he wasn’t a crier.
“I don’t understand Harry.” Draco said, even though he did. He understood everything. The only way for Voldemort to be defeated was for Harry to sacrifice himself. Voldemort’s Horcruxes must be destroyed...All of them.
“I’ll have to end the shield.” Draco warned, but he took the fang from Harry’s quivering hand and readied himself against the intrusive magic that was about to surround them.
“I need to think... I think.” Draco’s brow wrinkled in thought. Everything inside him was torn between accepting Harry and rejecting him. Harry sensed that the conversation was over and he stood up straight, stretched his arms above his head and motioned towards the door.
Meanwhile Draco clutched at his broom, the leather of his fingerless gloves creaked slightly as his fingers tightened on the black wood. He stood behind the rest of the team silently, waiting for their cue to fly out into the centre of the pitch and take their starting positions. He glared slightly at Montague and Pucey who were standing closest to the pitch entrance (and the furthest away from him) but he kept his tongue in check. No matter what he thought of his team mates, he really did want to win this game, and they were already one Chaser down. He found himself smiling slightly at the cheers and hollers from the crowd on the other side of the curtain, he was pretty sure that seventy five percent of the school would be cheering for Hufflepuff, but he still let himself get lost in the excitement. And not to mention, Harry would be out there, cheering him on. That in itself was enough to keep his spirits up. .
The next time Harry lowered himself over Draco’s naked body, flushed pink from his mouth and twitching in pleasure from the rough pads of his fingers. Harry allowed himself to groan and stutter out -
Harry stared down at the item that sat in the centre of the large desk. They were in the former Lord Malfoy’s office, it had been the most secure place to talk about the Horcruxes now that the manor was slowly filling with civilians. Harry looked up at Ron who simply shrugged in a ‘what can you do ey’ kind of way, before returning his eyes to the golden locket that gleamed under the bright lamplight. Of everything to come from their infiltration into the Ministry of Magic he hadn’t expected this to be one of them. Slytherin's locket, the real one, in all its glory. The fire in the grate behind Draco seemed to reflect off the green gems that made up the large S in the centre of the closed locket. And Harry couldn’t be sure if it was his imagination but he could have sworn that he had seen the locket shudder under the scrutiny.
“I’m sorry that you’ve had to come to us about this. Maybe next time we see you we can borrow Dumbledore’s Pensieve and show you some better memories of your Mum and Dad?”
No. Draco began to shake his head silently as Dumbledore talked. No. Absolutely not. No. This wasn’t right, this couldn’t be right. Dumbledore had to be wrong. Harry? His wonderful, loving, caring, Harry, living all his life with a part of Voldemort’s soul inside of him. His Harry, a Horcrux? Hermione’s fingers slid between his own as she silently shuffled even closer to grip his hand between both of hers.
“And the cup.” Harry reminded him. It had been smuggled out of Grimmauld Place before they had been forced to evacuate the house after Dumbledore’s death and Sirius had given it to Draco with a nod of understanding and a solid squeeze to the shoulder. He hadn’t known what it was, but he knew that it was damn important.
He had said as he gathered up his clothing and disappeared into the bathroom to get dressed. He so wanted to continue this strange affair they were indulging in. But he couldn't stand being tucked away out of sight. He couldn't stand Potter being ashamed to be seen with him. He couldn't fix Potter and his issues, Harry needed to stand on his own two feet now that the divorced was finalised and She-Weasley was out of the house.
“What is going on between you and Malfoy? Whatever you’re doing, is it dangerous? Because we can’t afford for Malfoy to be telling Umbridge anything, she’s already onto us about the DA.”
My chapters on Docs look so long, but on here they look so short hahaha. This is 6 pages long, if you can believe that lol.
"She finished ages ago, she's still looking for you though. I think she's researching something for us to practice." Ron put down his spoon after finishing his dessert and watched Harry eating, waiting for him to finish.
“Good night, Draco.” Harry said with a small smile that Draco could hardly see through his rough beard.
“I did something.” Harry said, but he didn’t expand. He hadn’t wanted to tell Draco of this at all, he didn’t want his Soulmate to look at him like he was turning into something dark and evil. The way Hermione had looked at him when he had done it.
The response to the last chapter was phenomenal. Thank you all so much! Please keep commenting I honestly live off them and I try and respond where I can.
"Don't say those things about yourself Draco. Harry would be lucky to shag you for the rest of his life. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that he couldn't find someone more perfect for him in every way. You know, he self-deprecates too, you're a perfect match.
The owl that appeared was a shock to him, but it wasn't to Potter. He'd seen it before. Which meant he'd done it before. Potter didn’t just
“Fine! Fine. Fine.” Draco batted his hands away and packed up his things. Passing his bag over to Harry who took it without complaint.
“Destroy it.” Harry said, “I-I can’t.” He held the fang out to Draco, careful of the tip soaked in venom.
“I should leave. Thank you for dinner, it really was lovely.” With the absence of a child leaning against him Draco stood up quickly. Climbing to his feet and instantly lamenting the loss of the cosy sofa that had seemed to envelop him in warmth and comfort.
“Apparently.” Draco replied. One of Harry’s hands found its way to Draco’s hip, and Draco leaned into the warmth that he could feel radiating from that single point of contact.
"I can't do it! I've tried but I can't." Draco was panicking now. The Patronus was protecting them from the front but there was nothing to protect their backs, and the Dementors were closing in.
.” It whispered to him. Harry tried to open his mouth, tried to refute the whisper of the magic, he was nothing like this.
Unfortunately, all the other owls were also waiting for its departure. As soon as its wingspan left Harry's vicinity he was being pelted by letters. All he could do was flinch as the envelopes rained down on him. Hermione on the other hand jumped straight into action, as though she was expecting this to happen, and knowing Hermione she probably did. She started grabbing the bright red Howlers as soon as they fell onto the table, and quickly dumped them into a large bowl (one that had previously been full of apples). Once the bowl was full she cast a quick Incendio. She had to do this at least twice in the time it took for the letters to stop raining down, but once they did Harry was finally able to look at the devastation around him. Letters littered the floor in a circle around him, the students sitting closest had pulled their robes or their bags over their heads, and those who had dived under the table were slowly starting to emerge. Harry picked up a letter that had been embedded halfway into a peach and looked at Hermione in bewilderment.
Harry heard one loud crack, the sound of the fang hitting the inside of the Locket. The whisper in his ears turned into a screech of pain and he had to clamp his hands over his ears to block out the high pitched shriek. Even with his hands over his ears Harry heard a second crack. He saw a quick flash of bright light and in an instant the dark dissipated into nothing and drifted away like it was no more than a wisp of smoke from a blown out candle.
is now live! I would love all of you with all my heart if you could mosey on over and give it a read. It's a completed fic and I'll be posting a new chapter daily as per usual.
"Malfoy." Harry found him at the coat check as he waited for the Witch behind the counter to find his belongings.
Draco came to a stop by the curb, he had drunk far too much to feel comfortable apparating home and there didn't seem to be any black cabs in this part of London.
The next night Draco arrived a little later than expected. But the American was stood waiting at the door and he politely waved off Draco’s apologies. He smiled charmingly and tucked Draco's arm into the crook of his elbow as they walked in together.
Harry stared up at the white tiled ceiling and counted the squares one at a time from left to right as he waited. He was as relaxed as he could be, sitting on a black leather chair with both feet planted firmly on the ground and his left arm propped up onto the padded arm. It was built for both comfort and purpose and Harry rather thought it succeeded at both, he certainly felt more at ease since sitting down. His left sleeve was rolled up around his elbow, and his skin prickled from the cheap disposable razor that had been used to shave down his arm. He tapped his fingers against the black leather, he didn’t want to be critical of someone who had far more training than he did but time was starting to tick on and he needed to be back at Privet Drive before his guard was swapped out. He had managed to sneak out while Tonks was on guard but once Moody took over there would be no disguising that he wasn’t in the house.
Draco took the champagne flute with a steady hand. Holding it by the stem in the proper manner and tilting it towards his lips for a slow slip. If he was ever to resist Harry he needed to take it slow on the alcohol. Harry seemed to have no such intentions, he held the glass firmly around the middle and took a long deep gulp. Draco watched his throat move as he swallowed, he followed the bob of Harry's Adam's apple and tried not to swallow in response. He could feel his cheeks already starting to flush, a visceral reaction to Potter’s presence that would not be stamped down no matter how much he tried.
“Kingsley? Remus? Dumbledore?” Draco questioned, pausing between each name to let Harry know that there was a point to this line of questioning.
“You can’t claim someone as your friend James. If we shuffle you both apart there will be more than enough room for Draco to sit between you both.” Draco walked into the kitchen-dining room behind Albus and Harry sidled passed him so he could put Lily in the highchair. He buckled her in quickly and skirted around the table to lift Albus into a booster seat so he could reach the table comfortably. With a little rearranging of the chairs and an extra placemat and cutlery added, Draco was sat between the two youngest Potter boys. They were staring at him from both sides, looking up at him with their mouths agape.
"Hermione said you brought a date." It was said through clenched teeth and Draco knew he would be a little put out but he hadn't expected this level of displeasure.
“The fact that it was a Horcrux talking to you should be enough for you to know that it was wrong. But yes, it was wrong. You could never be dark Harry, you’re just too good and too noble for that to ever happen. And as for your soul...well, since it is equally mine as it is yours I think I would be able to tell if it was fractured.” Harry turned his body halfway onto the bed so that he could finally look at Draco. The contact between them was broken, but under the scrutiny of those pale grey eyes Harry didn’t find himself missing the feeling of having Draco plastered against him.
"Drink?" Harry asked, gesturing to the pop up bar across the other side of the decked out Ministry Atrium. Draco shouldn't, he really really shouldn't. Alcohol, plus Potter in dress robes, plus the knowledge that there was an empty office just a few floors above…
.” Harry began to speak, and Draco had to look wildly around to see if the memory of himself was hanging around too. But he wasn’t, because Harry was talking to the him of the here and now. Or rather, Harry was talking to himself with the intention of giving this memory to Draco. He didn’t think Harry had expected Hermione to be here too, but Draco was glad she was. If anything else she was keeping him standing upright.
The secret passage had brought them to the Room of Requirement. Right into the heart of the castle. Harry looked across the faces of everyone who stood in the room beneath them. There were a few surprises, a few Slytherins were sat amongst the collected group. Harry was glad that Draco’s defection had made enough ripples for that to happen. Neville, looking worse for wear than he had at Christmas, was grinning up at them with Seamus by his side. A couple of other Gryffindors looked to be in the same state as Neville, with their arms in slings, and half healed bruises on their faces. Harry was suddenly glad that he and Ron had arrived looking tired and dirty. He wasn’t sure he could face everyone in this room looking like they had just come from a five star hotel. The Manor wasn’t in the best place right now, but they had access to a whole lot of shit that these students didn’t.
I wasn't sure whether to tag this as a Soulmate fic or not. I didn't want to give away the plot in the tags. Let me know if I should tag it or leave it as a surprise, I'd really like to know your opinions :)
“It’s not impossible, but it’s difficult. It definitely depends on how powerful the original memory charm was in the first place, I think the mental connection you have will help a lot.”
“Sure thing.” Ron left the dormitory and headed down to the common room, leaving Harry alone amongst the red and gold decor. He grabbed everything he would need for a shower and set himself up in the furthest stall from the door.
“You look sexy like this.” Harry commented. He had been checking Draco out at the same time as Draco had been checking him out. He admired the way Draco’s pale skin was flushed with the glow of desire. His grey irises were almost completely taken over by the black of his pupils and his lips were plump and red, a few shades darker from the pale pink they had been before Harry had captured them under his own.
“Of course not, not since we found each other.” Draco wanted to touch him, but he had to let Harry make the first move.
Gryffindor’s sword was shielded by a long glass case, sitting on a golden plinth. They rounded the desk silently, careful not to touch anything or knock anything out of place. For months Harry had been working with Moody to detect the nuances of curses and protection spells. He was glad all that knowledge wasn’t about to be wasted, Harry could see light shimmering across the glass in one direction, but when he tilted his head to the side he could see a slight shimmer in the opposite direction as well. That indicated that there was more than one protection spell around the case.
“So what’s the plan Harry?” Neville and Seamus sidled up on either side of him, with their arms crossed tightly and their eyes narrowed in determination. They had come to the same conclusion as Pansy. This was the beginning of the end.
more often in siblings or best friends, it wouldn't have pushed you into any relationship you both didn't already want."
“You got married?” Came the gasp of disbelief from Hermione. It had been so insane to them that they hadn’t told anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. He would have to explain everything to her once they were out of the memory, it hadn’t even crossed his mind in so long.
Cheers ran out across the stands as Cadwallader took possession of the Quaffle and sped towards the Slytherin keeper Bletchley, who was flying between the three Slytherin goals looking as defeated as Draco was starting to feel. He had played well, blocking a good portion of the goals, but their Chasers just couldn’t keep possession and he was starting to flag.
“Possibly.” Harry said. Truth be told, he didn’t really care, the fact was they had it and they wouldn’t need to go hunting for it. He knew it was the real one, he could feel an uncomfortable warmth in his scar whenever he tried to touch it. It wasn’t painful, not really, just a little odd. Maybe the locket was sensing the residue of Voldemort’s magic?
"Draco," Harry turned and said softly, letting Ron and Hermione walk ahead, "Are you coming?" He held his hand out. But Draco didn't take it. He put his hands in his pockets and followed Potter's sidekicks up the path, leaving Potter to follow behind him without another word. But Draco didn’t miss the small secret smile that Potter was keeping to himself.
"Didn't peg you as a cheater Potter." Draco had said when Harry's mouth moved away from his own and dropped down to kiss and bite at the pale skin of his neck. Draco could have kicked himself, what kind of idiot cockblocked himself by reminding his imminent shag about his wife and kids?
"And you think the Aurors won't be just as ready to hire you just because you're Harry Potter?" Harry shrugged and leaned back in his chair, "Don't be daft Harry, do whatever you want to do and worry about what people think afterwards. You'll have plenty of time to prove that you've earned your spot no matter which direction you take."
People have been asking and I tried to find a way to shoehorn it in but it just didn't fit anywhere, Pansy's Mother was the one to save Harry. I wanted so much to get it in this chapter but it was all from Draco's point of view and it just didn't fit.
“Have you asked the twins?” Ron sometimes did errands for the Potterwatch broadcast when the Twins were too swamped with Weasley Wheezes postal orders to fulfil both roles.
“Harry, for Christ's sake, Harry!” Hermione was tugging his arm even harder and was hissing his name in his ear to pull his attention away from the retreating Slytherin, “What the bloody hell was that about?”
“If you go down a floor to the Barking Mad Gargoyle on the balcony, under him is a set of stairs that lead straight to the Entrance Hall. They move so it’ll cut a good ten minutes off. He talks though and he’s a bit of a dick but he’ll move if you ask nicely.” Harry directed, and Draco’s lips quirked again in concealed gratitude.
A great ear-splitting grin had been plastered across his face. His previously stupid blonde hair was windswept and feathered across his forehead, having broken free from the spelled confines of its usual perfectly manicured appearance. There had been a streak of dirt smudged across his cheek and collected under his fingernails and around his nail beds, he had been chasing the snitch so close to the ground that when the snitch darted out of his reach at the last second he caught nothing more than a handful of mud. Luckily he was more successful the second time round, his fingers had closed over the snitch in a vice like grip and in that moment Harry had seen the human side to Draco Malfoy. And he was the most beautiful person Harry had ever looked at. So he had called over to Draco to release the snitch, and bet him that he couldn't catch it again.
"I-I can't." He was barely in touch with his magic right now, never mind cast a corporeal Patronus. He knew the incantation of course, he had tried it once in third year when he had seen Potter's Patronus first hand on the Quidditch field, he had been determined that there was no amount of magic that Potter could do that he couldn't. He had failed, of course, and had gone about for three days seething about perfect fucking Potter, because
“How could he?” Hermione whispered tearfully from his side. It was the first thing either of them had said since entering the memory and the clarity of her voice in comparison to the two Professors made him jump.
His world spun around him, making him dizzy and disorientated, all he could rely on was the hand that held tightly to his wrist, reminding him that he wasn’t alone in this. When he finally landed on his feet he had to take a couple of seconds to regain his balance and to check that Hermione was standing solidly next to him. Then he allowed himself to turn and look at the scene they had found themselves deposited into.
“Wouldn’t even think of it my Darling.” Harry grinned back, and hooked his foot around Draco’s under the table. Draco just rolled his eyes and pulled his Transfiguration notes back towards him but he didn’t move his foot away.
“It sounds to me,” Draco’s voice was soft from behind Harry and he spoke slowly just in case anything he was about to say triggered Harry’s fleeing reflex, “Like it was a piece of magic that sensed it’s end and was desperate to cling onto the only person available.”
“Tell me and I can help you. Whatever it is Harry, we can deal with it together.” Draco shifted, and ever so slowly he crawled down the length of the bed, giving Harry more than enough time to stand up and move away if he wished to. Harry shook his head in desperation, he knew that if Draco continued to ask then he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from answering.
I think that's everything I have to say. I love you all, I appreciate you all, and I hope with all my heart that you continue to follow me on this journey.
.” Only then could Harry feel the tug at his core. Draco was trying to use their magic, but Harry had unknowingly closed himself off, cutting off Draco’s access to his magic and preventing his emotions from leaking down their connection. Harry opened himself up to the tug of Draco’s spell and the magic rushed through him. The blue shimmer of Draco’s shield enveloped him. Cutting him off from the dark swirling magic that filled the rest of the room. Draco stepped even closer to him, having extended his charm to cover Harry as well as himself.
“Hagrid’s hiding a giant in the Forest.” Was the first thing that Harry said to Draco after he had thrown himself into the seat next to him in the library. Draco’s quill hovered over the parchment in front of him with a bead of ink hovering from the tip, and Harry watched it for the full second it took to drop down onto the parchment below.
"You're welcome Draco." Harry rolled his eyes. But he knew as well as Draco that his insults were lacking any real heat behind them, he was merely going through the motions until they were on more even footing, "We need to get back to the group. Where are your friends?"
Draco felt sick, and he felt dizzy. He wanted to sit down somewhere, just so he didn’t have to concentrate on keeping his balance anymore. Luckily Hermione was acting like a wonderful crutch right now, if she weren’t here he wasn’t sure he would be able to keep himself together. All he wanted to do was grab onto the stony faced Harry who was standing as a ghostly figure next to him, but he couldn’t, this Harry was no more real than the two figures pacing the Headmasters office in front of them.
she get it?” Draco asked. He hadn’t even seen Ron pull it from Umbridge’s neck when he had stunned her in the Ministry. Though he had been otherwise preoccupied with the dementor descending from above.
The rest of the pamphlets flashed up at him, one from Gringotts, a few from various Ministry offices, a couple to do with working with magical plants or animals … but none of the others sparked his interest. He didn't even notice that Draco had put his book down until he placed a long finger on the top of one of the pamphlets and dragged it towards himself. Harry vaguely saw the logo for St Mungos before Draco was flipping it around.
“Yeah, open it. But he might have put enchantments or curses on it, so let’s throw up some shield charms just in case. They followed his word to the letter and Harry watched as the three of them disappeared behind shimmering shields. He carefully unsealed the Basilisk fang and dipped the tip on it into the small vial of venom that Draco had left on the desk.
“We could go fuck?” Harry quirked a grin at him, showing Draco that he was mostly joking. Although if he had agreed he knew Harry would drag him to a bed as quickly as it took for them to get there.
"Pleeese Mr." Albus added, when Draco turned back around the two boys were leaning so far out of the doorway that they were having to hold onto their Father's belt loops to stop themselves from falling out onto the top step. Draco found it utterly charming.
He hated to admit it but he had been wandering around a bit like a zombie the past couple of days. He just couldn’t help but be reminded all day every day about what his Dad had done to Snape. He found his mind wandering on an almost hourly basis towards what type of man his Dad actually was. He had heard nothing but praise for James Potter since he stepped foot into the wizarding world, so this new revelation that his Dad really had been a cocky arsehole like Snape had claimed for the past five years, was scrambling his mind just a little bit. He supposed Draco had a point when he said that people changed, no one stayed their fifteen year old selves forever. He had wanted to put it off even more. But Draco was right, as per usual, this zombie impersonation was interfering in his OWL revisions and he really couldn’t afford to fail anything.
“Seventy five percent?” He didn’t sound too sure of himself, but Harry trusted his judgement implicitly.
The voices were coming from behind him, from the Restricted Section. He tried to peek through the bars but whoever was there, was completely hidden from view by the tall bookshelves and the darkened depths. The voices were moving away from him now. He wanted to ignore them. Every part of him was telling him to keep his head down and not get involved. But he found himself standing up, and skirting down the metal barrier, following the muffled sound of voices as they moved down the aisle. There were only a handful of people who actually said the Dark Lord's name and Draco had a sneaking suspicion that he knew exactly who was on the other side of the gate, but that didn’t mean that he was about to let the subject lie, he needed to know if they suspected anything else. If his cover was blown then he would need to leave the school immediately. Draco’s hand was on the gate before he could even stop himself. But a loud clearing of a throat behind him stopped him in his tracks.
“I know mate.” Harry hesitated before asking his best mate for one final favour, “Could you do something for me?” He pulled out his wand and looked down at it fondly, it had served him well, “Could you give this to Draco?”
He hurried up to Gryffindor tower, using every shortcut he knew so that he could shower quickly and still make it down to the Great Hall without everyone suspecting he was up to something. He hurried through the common room and climbed up to the dormitory, almost running head first into Ron in the open doorway to their shared dorm.
“Oh, and…” Harry turned to face him. He cupped Draco’s jaw in one hand and leaned forward to press a solid and lingering kiss to his mouth, “Well done Darling, wonderful flying today.” Draco grinned and held Harry’s hand all the way out of the library and up to the entrance of Gryffindor tower.
“For the time being. Not just for Malfoy’s sake either, Voldemort wanted him for something.” Hermione moved onto the next row down and she passed a couple of books over to Harry to put to one side, “Whatever he wants Malfoy for is important enough to take him from Hogwarts and alter the last year of his life.”
"Harry!" Harry was cut off from answering when a Jack Russell Terrier and an Otter came streaming through the darkness, sending Dementors scattering in all directions. Draco jumped away and Harry missed the contact the moment it was removed, but he didn't dare speak of it in front of Ron.
He was wearing the dress robes that Draco liked, pitch black with a deep burgundy lining, simple and elegant. He looked wonderful, but nothing could compare to the Muggle-Born Integration Initiative Gala. The dress code had been Muggle Formal, Draco had turned up in a perfectly tailored, extremely expensive, charcoal grey three piece suit, with a crisp white shirt and a navy blue tie. He could admit to himself that he looked hot and had spent a good few minutes checking himself out in front of the mirror before apparating to the Ministry. Harry on the other hand, had turned up in a black tuxedo, complete with a neat bow tie and shiny black shoes, and he had looked so undeniably phenomenal. Draco had only lasted two hours before the urge to drag Potter up to his office had become too strong to ignore. That had been a brilliant night, and the thousand muggle pounds spent on the suit had been well worth it, even if he hadn't worn it for very long.
“I’ve not gone and found my Soulmate only to lose him a couple of years later. I plan on hanging onto you Potter, so don’t start getting fanciful dreams of escaping from me any time soon.”
sign, but after checking their note the first four times she had stopped accusing them of forging Dumbledore’s signature. Harry had the suspicion that she had even visited the Headmaster in his office just to double check. For once he actually didn’t blame her, he was sure that no one in the entire History of Hogwarts had ever been allowed carte balance over the Restricted Section.
“No,” Harry said distractedly, his eyes had been drawn down to the gold locket which still sat innocently on top of the large wooden desk. He didn’t think that was what the memory was concerning, Horcrux related he was sure, but not how to destroy them. “Dumbledore wasn’t as simple as that.”
True to his word Draco apparated right to the boundary of the wards that surrounded Harry's house after he had finished his work day. He hadn't been very productive. He spent more time thinking about his confrontation with Harry than he did his work and he was sure he had filed at least three things incorrectly and signed off on one or two things that would definitely come back to bite him one arse at a later date. He stepped through the wards before he could second guess himself and walked right up to the red front door. Of course it was red, with a shiny gold door knob and a knocker in the shape of a lion's head roaring in suspended animation, bloody Gryffindors.
The moment the doors closed behind them Harry's hands were clenching into his robes and tugging him close insistently. Their mouths came together for the first time in a much anticipated kiss. It didn't take long before Draco was being hauled against Harry’s strong, solid body. Harry’s hands slid down Draco's waist, traced the curve of his slender hips, down the firm muscles of his thighs and around to his arse. The lift dinged at the right floor and Potter took the opportunity to squeeze and
“Daaad, that’s not fair!” James cried from the dining table where he had tried to secure his palace before his Dad could give away his dinner, “I saw him first! He’s my friend not Albus’s.”
"I need you, Draco." Potter said through clenched teeth as his Stag darted about in front of them, following the subtle flicks of Harry’s wand to chase away Dementor after Dementor, sending them careening in a swirl of black cloak.
Just a short one today, I felt like this should be a stand alone chapter before *things* started happening haha.
“No.” Draco met her eyes head on and brought himself up to his full height, he wasn’t about to be chased away like some first year.
He was acting like some kind of idiotic Gryffindor lately. He didn’t need to give a shit about what people thought of him. He knew he didn’t have anything to worry about, they didn’t know what he was doing, if they did he wouldn’t be sat in the Library studying, he would be getting escorted up to Dumbledore's office and arrested on the spot. He didn’t give a shit if they were talking about him, he was better than them. He was better than all of them, and he had something far more important to worry about than winning Quidditch and passing NEWTs. He had to stop thinking about Potter and he had to concentrate on the tasks he had been given. Failure was absolutely not an option.
He spent the rest of the evening talking to Sirius and Remus about what had been going on since Christmas. They tried to suggest some places where Harry could take the DA meetings but they all weren’t really suitable so Harry just put it to the back of his mind once again, he was pretty sure they wouldn’t be able to do anything with the DA for the rest of the year, as much as Hermione had tried to convince him otherwise.
“Darling,” Draco said, still in that same low gentle tone, “There’s not a single part of you that’s dark.” Harry’s heart clenched in his chest. He hadn’t told Draco about the Ministry worker, the one who had been so close to killing the man that lay bleeding at his feet. He hadn’t told him about the killing curse, cast from his own wand and hitting it’s mark without a single moment of hesitation.
“I want you to tell me everything.” She grabbed his arm and pulled him along to Gryffindor tower so that they wouldn’t miss the curfew. Harry started telling her all about how Malfoy had joined him for his Quidditch practice. How they’d laughed as Malfoy had tried to copy Harry’s Wronski Feint but landed on his face instead. His moaning, wailing more like, about how his face was probably ruined now, his nose probably broken and misshapen, how Harry had cast a quick cleaning charm at Draco’s face and told him not to worry because he was still pretty. And how it had developed from there, moving from the pitch and into the broom shed when Harry had put away the Snitch he had been practising with.
Potter slamming him into a wall and screwing him into an inch of his life. But now it really had to stop. Which was difficult with the way Potter was staring at him. With the way he was snaking in and out of the guests to make his way over to Draco.
“Since we have a Basilisk fang to hand I suggest we try that first. We’ll worry about how Dumbledore did it if that doesn’t work.” Hermione said and she was right. They did have a fang to hand, and venom. Maybe that was why Dumbledore had allowed them to keep the harvested parts from the Basilisk. Maybe he had connected to dots with the destroyed Diary and had realised that Harry already had everything he would need to destroy the rest.
"Probably holed away in the Castle. Wouldn't be surprised if they knew all about this." Ron said with no small amount of venom in his tone as he looked out to the circling Dementors.
“Mr Draco, Albus. You need to ask before giving someone a nickname, remember?” Harry said from behind him.
“He’s Hagrid's brother…Half brother.” Harry looked slightly confused, and a little bit disgusted at the idea of a Wizard having sex with a giantess.
They deserved their ending. And I got the chance to tell you all what they went on to do with their lives. This was just thrown together over the past few hours and posted straight away, so forgive any rough editing. It meant more to me to get this out there than it did for it to be well edited haha.
I'm sorry to those of you who thought Dumbledore would be around. But there's 9 chapters left and Dumbledore saving the day was a far too simple ending :)
Or it would have been too much, if Draco hadn't cleared his throat and asked. “What if…” He trailed off, and summoned any and every ounce of Gryffindor courage that might have been buried deep inside, “What if that turns out to be a very long time?” He raised his eyes to meet Harry's.
Just a quick note to say thank you for all the Kudos and Comments so far. I honestly live off it and it makes me so happy to get those notifications.
Love you all, thank you for the wonderful wonderful comments. I read and appreciate every single one and I reply where I can. Next chapter is a little bit of fan service after seeing our boys in so much pain ;)
“I won’t need it anymore, and I like knowing that it’s going somewhere safe.” He wouldn’t need to put up a fight when he came face to face with Voldemort.
“Have you watched Dumbledore’s memory yet?” Hermione was looking at him with a single raised eyebrow and pursed lips. Harry had been hesitating on that, he hadn’t wanted to see Dumbledore again so soon, not while he was still mourning him. He knew he needed to, it must have been important for Dumbledore to have left it for him, especially since he seemed quite sure (if the items he had laid out on his desk were any indication) that he wouldn’t be returning to his office alive. What kind of memory would a man like Dumbledore have left? Surely it could only be about the last remaining Horcrux?
“Third row, last aisle.” Harry said as he scanned through the last couple of books in his pile before placing them to one side, “These are useless too.”
“No? How about we test that theory anyway.” Draco’s smirk was sinful. His hands pressed firmly onto Harry’s shoulders, forcing him down onto his back so that he could crawl his way up Harry’s body to once again press their mouths firmly together in a breath taking and utterly satisfying kiss.
“Grab Ron, he’ll be able to help. Whatever your plans, it needs to happen before nightfall.” Seamus steeled himself and walked away, calling out to Ron as he went. Harry and Neville watched him go from their place on the outskirts of the busy room.
"You jerk off or something mate? That was the longest shower you've ever had." Harry laughed and punched him in the arm before grabbing himself a helping of everything nearby.
“What’s on the other side you reckon?” Ron asked. They had stopped on the other side of a large painting that covered their only exit. Harry had no idea, he had thought he knew all entrances and exits out of the Castle. Luna had said many times that the Castle was sentient, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it had sensed the students' distress and created a new exit for them. Harry raised his hand and very slowly he pushed the wooden frame that supported the back of the canvas painting. It gave way easily under his hand and the frame swung open immediately. There was a second of silence before a wave of sound hit them both in the face.
Harry walked down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Dean, Seamus and Neville, it was the day of the Slytherin v Hufflepuff match and Harry was excited to cheer on his boyfriend, even if it meant he was having to support the rest of the Slytherin team in the process. Hermione had opted to stay in the castle, making use of the empty library to monopolise the revision materials for their OWLs. Although she had promised to come meet them after the game so they could all go down to visit Hagrid together, just as they had promised. The half-giant hadn’t been looking his best since his return to the Castle and all three of them were concerned for his well being so they didn’t want to miss this chance to question him properly.
He was torn. He'd probably make a pretty good Auror, his grades weren't quite there but he wasn't so far off that it would be unfeasible. He liked the idea of catching bad guys and putting them away but the idea of putting himself on the front line for the rest of his life might just be more than he could handle. Not to mention the paperwork he'd have to deal with. Quidditch on the other hand, he was good at. He was brilliant at it, actually. And he truly loved being up in the air and chasing after a Snitch. But…was he good enough to play professionally? He was good at Hogwarts but out of Hogwarts he was a little fish in a big pond. Not to mention there was only ever one Seeker per team, it wasn't like being a Chaser where you had three times the opportunity. He was sure there would be a lot of competition, and he didn't quite know how he would feel about stepping even further into the public eye.
"It's a nightmare Hermione." Draco cried to her three days later as he sat on the sofa in her office and ate his lunch while she worked, "I'm in love with the sod and it's all for nought."
“You probably have a point there.” Ron said with a thoughtful nod, “I think if Dumbledore had wanted Harry to know then he would have told him straight away. He’s never been one for straightforward information has he?”
“I agree. What about …” Hermione trailed off, stopping in her tracks and staring at the person who had stepped out of the Transfiguration classroom in front of them.
“That’s 5-0 in my favour!” Draco looks around at the other patrons for support, but as it’s mid-afternoon on a Monday most of them are regulars who have no interest in table football. “That means I get to pick what we do tonight.”
feelings, they’re just sexual frustration wearing a romantic disguise. He needs to pull, not hit on his new friend. Unfortunately he has given up every free night this week to see Harry, so opportunities for any other socialization have been non-existent. Draco makes a promise that he will, at the very least, have a decent wank this evening and then attempt to make a plan with some of the friends he only seems to see when they are all single and need company for the gay bar.
Sorcipus nodded, so Pansy continued, reading through the letter before handing it to Scorpius. “He sounds better than most of the ones you’ve received.”
“Yes, wizards can marry other wizards. People can fall in love with whomever they want, and I happen to be a wizard who does not care about the gender of his partner.” It sounded a bit simplistic to his ears, but Draco wasn’t sure now was the time for a detailed journey into his romantic life.  “And no, I’m not sure I want to get married again.”
Embarrassingly, Draco felt his eyes begin to well up as Scorpius looked back at him long enough to offer a brief smile and wave before turning around again.
Draco heaves a sigh of deep frustration and turns. It is indeed Harry Potter, looking rumpled but somehow still attractive in jeans and a Ballycastle Bats t-shirt. He's wearing the beard again, though better filled out ten years on and neatly trimmed; he also appears to have abandoned his attempts at using gel so that his hair falls in soft curls just below his ears.
“There are, but they aren’t so bad.” Harry told him. “If you get nervous you can stick with me, alright? Rosie’s grandma makes the best pumpkin pancakes you’ve ever had.” This was true, Molly’s grandchildren were obsessed with her pancakes from the youngest (Molly’s namesake) to the eldest (Teddy). Though the family gathering would be significantly smaller as most of the older children were at school and Andromeda was visiting a friend, it was still guaranteed to be chaotic. Harry figured it would probably be a bit overwhelming for an only child from a family of two.
“Is this some sort of test?” Draco demands, and when Potter shrugs, Draco heaves an audible sigh. “If I met and fell in love with a muggle then yes, I imagine that I would consider marrying them. However it would be selfishness on my part, cruelty even. Imagine finding out the man you love belonged to a family who considered you inferior? That he believed the same at one point in his life? I can’t think that I would stay with such a person. Not to mention that I would also have to explain what I am to them.”
Gävle Goat = The Gävle Goat (Swedish: Gävlebocken) is a traditional Christmas display erected annually at Slottstorget (Castle Square) in central Gävle, Sweden.
Sighing, Draco made his way to the bar and leaned against it beside the attractive wizard, though he didn’t dare make eye contact. He signaled the bartender and ordered refills. Then, taking a deep breath, he turned to the man beside him - who was no longer there. In the split second it took Draco to realize this, Harry Potter slid onto the now vacant stool. They locked eyes for a moment, Draco’s stomach doing a little flip that he did his best to ignore.
Arthur accioed a box from the rafters and drew forth a set of deep blue robes with slightly lighter blue trim. Unlike many of the other items that had made their way through the Weasley family, these were in pristine condition. Harry shrugged out of his sweater as Arthur draped the garment around him.
Draco laughed, though he quickly realized it was the wrong reaction. “Esme, I’m not, I promise you. I’m attracted to all genders. I wouldn’t be using you in any capacity - I’m not ashamed of who I am and I don’t care enough about what the rest of the world thinks to want to hide it.”
“In the end, Draco, you were a scared boy trying to keep his family alive, poisoned by hateful rhetoric which also happened to be the only thing you knew.” Hermione put a gentle hand on his arm. “I don’t hate you.”
Draco nodded. “Asleep upstairs with plenty of soundproofing and monitoring charms. Rose seems to have gotten the idea into his head that he should stay up till midnight, but thankfully he was asleep by 8pm.”
“No thanks.” Harry muttered, flicking off the wireless. His whole body felt charged and jumpy, as though he was waiting for something to happen, an excitement he hadn’t felt for someone in a long time building in his chest.
He’s rewarded with an embarrassed smile and again, there’s that odd feeling in his stomach when their eyes meet that causes Draco to deliver a stern internal admonition to himself.
“No, not since Astoria died.” Malfoy hesitated. “Too many bad memories there. And painful good ones.”
“I think celibacy might be a constant in my life till Scorpius goes off to Hogwarts.” Draco did not relish the prospect, but he couldn’t see any way around it.
Pansy scrutinised them through dark lashes as she took a sip of her drink. “What are the two of you doing?”
“No bother - it was nice to see you again, Hermione.” Draco said, and was surprised to realize he meant it.
“What are you reading Harry?” Hermione asked, sliding a pint across the table as she sat down beside him in their usual booth at the Leaky. She and Harry were  early as they had both come from the ministry where Harry was shopping WWW’s defense cloak prototype to the Head Auror. His visit to Hermione’s office had been undertaken with great trepidation, but Anthony was nowhere in sight (Harry had heard that he was dating again, some bloke from Magical Sports and Games, which seemed altogether too soon if he was being honest).
Now that he has a chance to really look him over, Draco notices the beard Potter was previously sporting is gone and he appears to be trying out styling gel on his curly hair, fringe slightly over-long to hide the scar. His glasses have gotten an update as well: though the frames are still round they are a lighter colour, slightly thinner with silver detailing at the hinges. He wears a black sports coat over a fern coloured button-down which highlights his eyes and compliments the warm brown of his skin. The shirt is tucked into a pair of slightly wrinkled black slacks that are perhaps a bit too baggy to truly be called stylish; even so, the effect is casual and attractive.
“Yes but you actually want to be having sex, Draco, and that’s the difference.” Pansy surveyed the crowd. “You don’t have to marry or even date them - casual sex has never been easier. I bet you could find someone here - that one by the fishtank, for example?”
“Maybe. Or maybe I’m looking for reasons to run, Hermione says I should talk to him but there’s something miss-” Harry stopped, embarrassed. “I’m talking too much about this.”
Pansy had begun to make a habit of stopping by Draco’s home on Friday evenings for dinner. Draco cooked, of course, as he wasn't sure Pansy had ever actually touched a stove. In a bid to please both picky eaters - Scorpius was going through a phase where he wouldn't eat greens and Pansy had been finicky since birth - Draco usually made some sort of pasta.
“Papa!” Scorpius cried, nearly falling off the stool in his effort to follow. “Wait I have questions!” But Draco was already out of sight.
“I’m just fortunate that anyone thinks I am redeemable.” Draco said honestly, taking another sip of his latte.
Pansy let out a loud sniffle that she attempted to muffle in her glass of wine, and Draco felt tears spring to his own eyes.
“Bye Harry, Bye Draco!” A huge yawn escapes Sayeda’s mouth. “When you come over I’ll introduce you to Azriel.”
“No Hugo, we don’t hit.” Hermione said from where she was giving Rose’s hair one last go-over with her wand, ensuring the two puffs on either side of her daughter’s head were neatly arrayed.
He explained what had happened the night before then handed Rosie the letter, which she scrutinized solemnly for a few minutes. Scorpius waited with a patience he had for few others, hoping that Rosie would have the answer if he gave her enough time.
Krampus = In Central European folklore, Krampus is a horned, anthropomorphic figure described as "half-goat, half-demon", who, during the Christmas season, punishes children who have misbehaved.
Harry did look (how could he not) and felt his stomach drop. It was one thing to have an understanding and adult break up, but it was another entirely to see the man you loved with his hand on another man’s thigh. Harry ducked his head and looked morosely into his pint.
Harry didn’t consciously watch Malfoy leave, but when he turned back to his friends Hermione had a curious look on her face.
“Another trait he inherited from his mother, as you might have guessed. I-” Draco was cut off by the sound of his name being called. “-must see what Blaise wants. If you’ll excuse me?”
“Lovely chat, Potter. I’ll see you around I’m sure.” He wobbled slightly as he turned but no limbs were left behind in his wake, so Harry had to assume he’s apparated safely home.
“And you didn’t even get a shag out of it.” Pansy said crudely one Saturday evening as the two of them sipped wine at a trendy bar, part of Draco’s concession to her pleas for a night out. Scorpius was having a sleepover at the Granger-Weasley house.
Hugo babbled up at him, his chubby brown cheeks dotted lightly with freckles, hazel eyes searching Harry’s face for a moment before he broke into a smile that nearly struck Harry dead on the spot.
(This laissez-faire attitude combined with Rosie's general aptitude for trouble would elicit many muttered expletives from Professors during her years at Hogwarts)
Once he had repeated the story in its entirety, Harry collapsed onto the couch, taking the lager Ron offered him with grim determination.
“How about a late lunch to celebrate finishing our N.E.W.Ts?” Potter says. “Somewhere in Muggle London?”
Sirius waves a hand and a second snifter floats toward him from down the table; he fills it a quarter of the way and slides it over to Harry. “Your mum got me listening to them, she was mad for their music. Lily was always the first to know about new music and was clever enough that she figured out how to play muggle records at school early on, made all of us listen to their albums over and over. This one came out in our fifth year. Remus and I - this song meant a lot to us.”
The small blonde head nodded, and Scorpius managed “I came to meet the man from the letter. Papa wouldn’t come and I thought if I went alone and papa saw he was nice he might want to- to meet him. But he didn’t come and then it got dark and I was too scared to leave.”
As the afternoon wears on, they stroll around the neighbourhood, chatting aimlessly till they find themselves beside a primary school that appears to be hosting a carnival in its car park. A flock of brightly coloured tents flap in the breeze and families wander around, competing for prizes, eating candyfloss, and having their faces painted. The noise level is loud but joyous, and they are just about to walk on when a small voice calls out:
Hermione’s frown softened. “That’s called incompatibility, Harry. Do you think this is actually about how Tony doesn’t want children?”
Hermione looked puzzled for a moment before understanding dawned on her face. “No.” She said. “Harry doesn’t hate you. Both he and Ron know we’re friends. Sometimes he asks after you.”
“See? Pot- Harry never stayed up till midnight when he was your age. Now, let’s get you back to bed.” Malfoy said, his voice far kinder than Harry could have imagined
“You and I are a great family all on our own” Scorpius’s words were slightly muffled as he buried his head in Draco’s shoulder.
Once she leaves, Potter appears to decide that their former topic of conversation is too fraught, because he veers wildly toward another. “What are you hoping to do, once you’ve got your N.E.W.T results?”
Hermione and Ron joined them shortly, the latter holding a squirming Hugo who, now quite fast and mobile on his hands and knees, objected strongly to being held.
“Fran, Amani, it’s been too long.” He raises to shake their hands. “Are you enjoying Hampstead and the new home?”
They ate posh sandwiches and drank tea from a matching set of jade cups while Mandy droned on about her current case and Harry tried to feign interest. He wished Anthony had more interesting friends - if only they were in the warm chaos of Ron and Hermione’s home instead, drinking tea from the assortment of oddly shaped mugs that Luna hand made and gifted them all each Christmas till everyone had a haphazard collection. (This year Harry’s was bright yellow and the handle was a lion’s tale. It went well with the one shaped like a lion’s head from four years previous.)
“So if you want me to date you have to let me date, Scorpius. Alright?” Draco reached out to put his hand on Scoripus’ shoulder. There was a brief pause where it seemed like their disagreement might be over.
“James was furious that she had gotten herself injured and she tore a strip off him, told him that muggle or magical, she wasn’t about to live in a world where hatred was tolerated.”
“No, I learned a long time ago that the things my father taught me were untrue and hurtful. But I did some unkind things before I figured it out.”
Harry’s grin widened as Pansy approached, a drink in one hand and the other trailing her fur wrap. “Oh look, it’s Harry Potter.” She sneered playfully, accidentally throwing her wrap in Harry’s face as she made a sweeping curtsy in his direction. “The boy who lived to grace us with his presence.”
“She was. Scorpius takes after the best parts of her, I try to remind him of them as often as I can. I know he’s mine in looks, but he’s hers in personality through and through.”
“Where did all of these letters come from?” Draco demanded after the owls had been fed and shooed away and he was satisfied with the thoroughness of his cleaning charms.
When he arrived back he found her wearing her cloak and a very unhappy expression. “I thought that, given our mutual friend, I should at least stay to say goodbye.” She told him quietly.
“I know.” Hermione smiled. “That’s one of the reasons I forgave you. I don’t think you spent much time after fourth year being anything but terrified for most of your waking moments.”
“It’s going to be a long engagement.” Harry said, raising his voice. “We didn’t - it sort of came out of nowhere, really. It just felt right, didn’t it Anthony?”
Draco looked: a man sat at the bar beside a long tank of tropical fish with his back to them. He had dark, messy hair and broad shoulders, nursing a pint of beer as he made idle conversation with the witch next to him.
“No, it's okay, they're very open about adoption. ‘Yeda was orphaned at a young age.” Harry explains as they begin to walk again. “Her parents were muggles and she was in muggle care for her early years - she was my first kid right out of school. It was difficult finding her a family because we didn’t have a lot of magical people who wanted to adopt, and we try to put children in homes with at least one parent who has a similar racial or cultural identity. But then Fran and Amani came along - she’s a professor at the Hemlock Collegiate and he works on magical human rights issues. They met in America and moved back here to be close to Amani’s family - his parents actually came from a town close to where Sayeda’s mum grew up. They’re older and they were usually more of a temporary home for children, but when they met Sayeda we all knew they were meant to be a family.”
Draco watched as Max pushed the chocolate chunks around his ice cream bowl, his head rested forlornly in a hand. Every now and then the ginger would release a heavy sigh that caused his frame to slump further in his chair.
“Technically, it was Macy who brought it up.” Jasmine says between laughing. Draco’s head met the table, he could feel his life span shorten as he continued to argue with these people.
“I was named after a constellation, and it is my favorite story of them all,” he said, ignoring Thomas’ snort of “it would be.”
“You have to be gentle, Teddy. If you want to be friends with them, you have to be careful.” Isabelle explained to him as she demonstrated the correct petting technique.
“Oh right, sorry,” Draco said, retracting the hand but Max’s shot out to grasp the retreating appendage.
“Oh I know, last year a Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop opened up in Diagon Alley. I heard that she now serves these little pink cakes that will bloom as different types of chocolate flowers depending on the customer's mood.” Macy was quick to answer, looking at each person expectantly. No doubt waiting for their agreement.
Delighted at gaining the blondes attention, Isabelle ran full sprint at him. Before Draco could stop her, the small body slammed into his legs and dirty fingers tangled in his shirt.
The worst of it was on his right forearm, it had both scars and cuts crossing each other. During his bath, stray fingers would occasionally brush along the wounds before they were jerked away causing waves in the water.
“We can hang them on your wall. As for the rest, we'll sort them in an album for protection.” Draco said.
As he watched Draco Malfoy guide them all gracefully through the poses, ever confident in his abilities without the usual arrogance, he could admit that Malfoy was bloody attractive.
“I won't stop you if you want to leave. But I implore you to stay the night, in the morning I can help find alternative living. Isabelle told me that life at the orphanage was terrible. If you need an explanation for my actions, it’s simply because I can relate. I know what it’s like to be afraid of turning the corner in the place you live.”
Draco remembered the disgust in Frank’s blue eyes when they were introduced. The barely veiled insults spat about Draco’s styled hair, thin frame, and fashionable clothing. As if Draco's less then rugged appearance threatened Frank's own masculinity. Lucila Hawkes wasn’t much better; always a step behind her husband, a cutting remark on her tongue.
Then they all split up to get their outfits. Draco had changed into a muggle work out clothing, when Mittsy came to inform him he had a visitor.
Removing it from around his neck, Draco continued, “He said it was to remind me that though I’m a Malfoy, I also come from the noble House of Black.”
Macy laughed, “Merlin no, I know exactly how I sound and with Thomas as a brother I never hear the end of it. But I love composing with a piano or guitar. Plus, I’m not that bad of songwriter, if I do say so myself. Which reminds me, I noticed a Grand piano in one of the rooms.” She said fluttering her lashes up at him.
“I apologize for the delay in following up with your complaints. It would have been sooner, but detaining dark wizards is quiet a demanding task. I do hope you understand.” Draco bluffed.
“Yep, Draco and I were in the same Care of Magical Creatures class and the professor, Hagrid, brought one in for us to see. I even got to ride it.” Potter proudly said.
Hey, guys thank you for all the kind words. I was hesitant to post this story because I wasn't sure if anyone else would enjoy it but I'm so glad I did. Your comments are what push me to keep at it with this fic! So, I hope you enjoy the rest of my work, let me know what you think.
It almost worked, she was about to agree with Draco until Teddy let out a shout of “Monkeys.” Causing her bottom lip to jut out in a pout.
Unfortunately, Draco’s brain, like brains tend to do, could only focus on the abysmal events. His mother fell sick while awaiting her trial, dying soon after. Draco was informed of his parents’ fates only after his own trial had concluded. Then, the Ministry tossed him out leaving only a bitter taste in his mouth knowing that he was now alone.
He wondered if the teenager should be reading those books, knowing they could get a little raunchy. But the thought was quickly dismissed. After all, he read the same books at a younger age and he'd turned out fantastic.
Even the kids have noticed his mood. They kept trying to distract him, Isabelle and Max keep inviting him to tea parties. And Macy would ask for his advice on songs she was writing, “They don’t sound right when I try to sing them. I need your help.”
“I told her to tell the Headmistress or you, but she said she could handle it.” Thomas continued, “And well it looks like she did.”
“Thank you, Jasmine. I’ll try to survive the next few months without you, it will be difficult,” Draco sarcastically replied. But everyone heard the truth in the words.
“Fine, then tell me how you were able to stay the leader of the Slytherin house. I hear you were the head snake since your first year,” Macy pressed excitedly. “You are a legend in our house for having the longest reign for centuries. Come on, I need tips.”
Macy, Max, and Isabelle remained silent during the whole trip. During Draco's last walk with Isabelle he couldn't get the girl to stop talking. So, it seemed strange that she hadn't uttered a single word.
Draco placed the glass container of salve on the sink counter. Then knelt on the ground beside the bathtub to block the drain and start the water flowing. Adjusting the temperature as needed.
It was a little area marked with a rickety, wooden fence. Enclosed inside were small animals such as goats, rabbits, sheep, and kneazles. Parents followed their children as they roamed the area. Making sure they didn’t harm the animals and remained injury free.
What followed was an hour of sabotage. Both men took every chance to mess with the other, all the while defending their own piece.
Before taking the first bite, Draco cleared his throat. “I think it’s time to discuss your situations. As I said before, you all are welcome to here. But if there is another place you’d rather stay, like a friend’s place, I’d help make the arrangements.”
“You’re telling me I trusted you and this school to keep my kids safe while I wasn’t around, and you failed and you now want to punish Macy because she wanted to defend herself. Is that right?”
He began when he was fourteen with his mother. When Narcissa returned after a visit from France, she’d introduced Draco to the exercise. She said that it was good for the mind, body, and spirit; Draco loved it.
Damn, He’d honestly forgot all about that term in his release. Until next year, the Ministry could barge into his home and anything was found that they didn’t like he’d be dragged away in chains. The kettle whistled, causing Draco to jump.
After that annoying morning, he really didn’t need this right now. He thought as he took in the appearances of the two Aurors at his doorstep. One who he’d rather never to see again.
“Isn’t that Auror Potter?” Macy questioned, after they’d been standing to the side for a few minutes. She pointing to someone that was walking past them. At her exclamation, a messy, dark head of hair turned in their direction and sure enough there was Potter.
“They’ll come, or they won’t there is no sense in worrying about something that might never happen.”
“These Aurors are here to talk to you all. This is Auror Potter and Auror McClain. They are Thomas, Jasmine, Macy, Maximus, and Isabelle.” He said indicating each person.
He opened his eyes to slivers, feeling crusty and heavy at this late time. Staring back at him was Isabelle, peeking over the side of the bed. She had wet streaks on her cheeks, eyes puffy and red from her fists rubbing at them. Her hair was messy and knotted.
They were a close-up of Isabelle, her eyes shut, and a large grin plastered on her face. Macy and Max together, faces mushed together to fit in frame. Thomas posing, feet spread apart arms curled in a flex. Finally, Jasmine and himself in the library, both sitting in the same manner mid-debate on the teachings of Flamel.
“I wanted to know how he got the horses to the king.” But as he said this his eyelid slid the rest of the way shut and he was asleep. Draco shut off the astrolabe and returned it to its rightful place against his chest. Closing his eyes, he soon followed the others into sleep.
By the end of the session their paintings were beyond repair and their skin marked up in with all the colors available.
“I think the owl treats are in the sweets cupboard, papa.” Scoripus said helpfully. Draco stored his son’s detailed knowledge of said cupboard for a later conversation and after a moment of rifling, pulled the bag from behind a jar of ice mice whose number had been notably reduced.
“My mummy did too, but I wasn’t a baby.” Scorpius twisted his napkin in his lap. “Papa is doing a very good job with me, though.”
(Hermione had spent years working her way through the bureaucratic ranks of the ministry in order to reform magical creature and blood purity laws. As a result, she was the newly appointed Secretary of Foreign and Muggle Affairs. Kingsley had tried to appoint her Secretary of Magical Creatures and Muggle Affairs but Hermione had declined, citing the need for actual representation from the group. Firenze, formerly designated magical creature now designated magical being thanks in large part to Hermione’s efforts, became the first of his kind to hold a position of rank within the ministry.)
“I know.” Pansy sighed. “I know. Eventually, though, you’ll start dating again. You’ll meet someone.”
In this chapter we begin to diverge slightly from the original movie, if only because I got a bit carried away with writing. It comes back to the plot soon.
“Ernie MacMillan!” Says a voice that is far too close and recognisable. “Sorry to interrupt, I thought that was you and wanted to say hello. It’s been yonks hasn’t it?”
Their eyes met briefly as Malfoy responded and well, that was something else. A feeling he hadn’t known existed stood suddenly upright and demanded attention; Harry was embarrassed to admit he felt slightly weak in the knees from only the brief eye contact. He was so busy trying to convince himself otherwise that it took Harry a moment to realize what Malfoy had said.
Later, after Scorpius had gone to bed and the two of them were drinking an expensive port in front of the fireplace, Pansy circled back around to the topic. “You know, Scorp’s right. You are sad.”
“Of course I’m sad, Pansy.” Draco was realizing somewhat belatedly that he had overindulged on the wine. “I’ve lost my fucking wife.”
“The whole being afraid of a good thing, thing. Hermione thought she was giving clear advice, and you thought that advice was ‘compromise everything you want because you’ve found a decent boyfriend’. Hermione and I compromise, but not in a way that makes us fundamentally unhappy. You were unhappy, mate.”
“But you’re friends now?” Scorpius asked, sitting down cross-legged on the floor to lean against the open door, though Harry noticed he was careful not to set even a toe outside the frame - Malfoy’s wards were probably only activated if someone entered or left the room. Harry slid down the wall till he was sitting against it, and turned to face the child.
“It depends on how she’s feeling. It’s okay to need support sometimes, though, it doesn’t mean you’ll always need it.” This was something he told the kids in his classes when they were frustrated that they couldn’t cast a spell without his help.
Of course they have been, Harry isn’t foolish enough to think they’re perfectly happy. To begin with, they haven’t had sex in approximately a year and a half, though Harry has been attributing this to the fact that both of them work demanding jobs which frequently take them out of the country.
This was Hermione’s sticking point as well. “Oh Harry.” She’d said, pursing her lips and trying to sound diplomatic. “You didn’t notice any of her things were gone?”
Draco found he really did need something hot to drink and it turned out Hermione was surprisingly good company They ended up at a trendy wizard coffee shop with which Hermione seemed quite familiar - she ordered a latte that came in a large glass mug with a handle. Draco ordered chamomile tea with honey and a bit of milk, following her over to one of the tables by the window.
Harry watched Malfoy’s interactions with Hermione and Ron carefully for any hint of malice or ulterior motive, but found none. Instead, there were only hints of the snotty boy Harry had known, interspersed with some very real glimpses of the man he had become.
“In the end we both wanted different things. I - might have done that thing where I decide something without taking into account how it will affect someone else.”
“Not as surprised as we were.” Draco kept his tone neutral, friendly. He had never liked Weasley and hadn’t been particularly interested in befriending him while at Hogwarts. That being said, the man must have hidden depths if he was married to Hermione, so Draco was willing to amend his previous judgement. His younger self would never have permitted this re-evaluation, but since Astoria’s death he had begun to allow himself all kinds of liberties and the perspective offered by fatherhood had shifted his opinions considerably.
Once they reached the entrance, Scorpius set out on his own - he knew Pax Gardens well, as Draco loved the winding paths and seemed to be especially fond of the fountain at its center. The letter had not been clear about what time the man would be meeting them, but twilight was beginning to fall and Scorpius felt sure it would be soon. He had said before the fireworks, and fireworks happened when it got dark. He picked a bench facing the fountain and settled in to wait.
A year has done wonders for Potter: his hair is trimmed close to his head and he has grown himself a beard. It has the slightly patchy look common in teenage facial hair, but suits his face tremendously well. His skin has the healthy look of someone who has spent a considerable amount of time outside, and Draco wonders if the rumours of his sabbatical in Spain might hold some weight afterall.
Harry takes this as his cue to exit, glancing over to see that Malfoy is utterly undisturbed and deep in conversation with a recently arrived healer.
“‘Yeda, you’re going to overwhelm him.” Fran chides gently. “My apologies, Draco, she gets so excited when she meets people who are like us, since we spend most of our time outside the community. It doesn’t help that Amani’s parents sent him to Uagadou and I went to Castelobruxo, so Sayeda has no one to ask about Hogwarts.”
“Dear Sleepless & Son.” Pansy did roll her eyes this time. “I am not normally the kind of wizard who listens to WWN’s floo-in mind healing show, but I happened to catch your episode on Christmas Eve. After hearing your story the other night, I couldn’t help but feel compelled to write.”
Harry laughed at the idea, though privately he thought it likely wasn’t as much of a deterrent to Ron as Hermione hoped - he had been angling for a third child “to round things out” since Hugo’s fifth month.
Hermione laughed. “If you think I don’t get the same interrogations from Harry about you then you’re delusional.”
“Oy, if you don’t stop yelling I’ll be disrespecting you in a minute.” Says a wizard who looks like he should not be making this sort of promise.
“Uh huh. Mummy loved Yule. Every year she would decorate our house and make papa sing muggle carols even though he hates them. I think he’s especially sad because of that.”
“Arthur, I’m so sorry.” He stuttered - here he was, destroying the family heirloom that had been so kindly given to him. “It’s bad luck!”
Harry took the maze at a jog, which was quite difficult given that night had fallen and it was lit only by a slightly eerie glow of fairy lights and his wand. He took a wrong turn twice, coming up short at dead ends and nearly walking head first into the horn of a marble unicorn. Eventually he found the proper route and made his way to the garden at the center of the maze, through the winding path of blooms toward the gazebo and fountain. Harry scanned the scenery for another person, feeling as though his luck truly had run out this time. He was too late.
“Do you want some?” He asked, eyeing the mountain of eggs and bangers, toast (with strawberry jam) potatoes, and bacon.
Esme smiled - she had a very pretty smile - and shook her head. “Please don’t apologise for being a caring father, it’s a rather appealing quality.”
He pinches her arm in retaliation - truthfully, Tiberius has not worked out the way he’d imagined. Endlessly grumpy and with a preference for shitting in Draco’s loafers, and his loafers alone, the kneazle’s affections lie solely with Ernest. Draco is really only considering partial custody because it feels like the right thing to do, seeing how he had been the one who wanted a pet in the first place.
“Maybe, but drinks are better for the first date. With dinner, you might decide you don’t like them halfway through the appetizers and then you’re stuck finishing. You can always follow up drinks with dinner if you want to.” Draco paused. “Unless it doesn’t work like that anymore.”
Harry stopped and ran a hand through his hair. Was he losing his mind? What kind of person wrote a - a love letter to a man they heard on the wireless?
“We - it was very difficult, losing my wife. But I think we’re doing okay, my son and I. Aren’t we doing okay?” this question was clearly directed at his son, but before the boy could answer the Professor spoke.
Draco snorted in an undignified way and topped her up. “I have at least eleven more years before he graduates from Hogwarts, don’t I? We’ll figure out the rest later.”
The man took several deep breaths. “I’m not, come here.” Harry imagined that he had taken the little boy into his arms. “What can I do for you, Professor...Mentis, was it?”
Draco took a deep breath, trying to stave off a panic attack. Scorpius was somewhere out in the wizarding world alone, and there were terrible people out there, Draco knew exactly how terrible from personal experience, and there was nothing between them and Scorpius.
“It’s too many!” He said, squirming out of the way of her long, manicured nails. “And mummy said they’re mean to muggles so Isla and Peter couldn’t come over.”
“It certainly would have been more romantic.” Hermione said archly. She wasn’t wrong - while the festival was a lively celebration of community it was not exactly the favoured spot for a first date.
What he had intended was to pop by the recently added midwifery wing for a quick visit with Fleur and Bill, meet the newest Weasley, then grab a bite before he has to floo back to Portsmouth with Dean for their afternoon lecture.
Scorpius glanced over at Rosie, who was trying to tell Ron a story that seemed to have no discernible plot. “I always hold papa's hand. Does Rosie hold someone's hand?” He asked quietly.
He hesitated - now that he’d had a moment to think about it, this whole plan seemed just short of absurd. Still, he knew from experience that after having seen the wild look on his face as he tumbled into the living room, neither of his friends would settle for an excuse.
“I promised Rosie that I’d stay up late! But Harry’s her uncle and he says her grandma won’t let her stay up till midnight either.”
“He’s practically married, Pans.” Draco said quickly, noting that Harry looked particularly amused by her comment. “To Anthony Goldstein.”
Draco was not at home when the letter arrived - he had an investors meeting to attend with Blaise and then dinner later on and only had time to stop at home briefly. Pansy had collected Scorpius from school and was expecting to stay with him into the night; she was in the kitchen trying to work out how to use Draco’s muggle toaster when the owl arrived. She let it in and took the envelope, then scanned the kitchen for the bag of owl treats. Finding none, she proffered one of the apple slices meant for Scorpius’ after school snack. As the owl dropped peel all over the counter, Pansy turned the letter over in her hands.
“We wanted to make sure we spent as much time together as possible before Sayeda starts her first year at school.” Fran’s accent is American, a curiosity for Draco who has never met one in person before. “It’s going to be so odd with my
Scorpius nodded solemnly at her, then turned to look at Draco. “Your new partner might be in one of these letters papa. I think we should read them.”
Draco returned his son to a frantic Pansy and had some quick words with the child about absconding from one’s caregiver and the politeness of not mentioning other potential love interests in front of one’s father’s current date. He would have liked a longer lecture, but didn't want to leave Esme alone for too long.
Harry could picture Professor Mentis leaning forward as he sensed a human interest story that could be milked for publicity. He was almost ready to change the station back to Celestina Warbeck when the small voice said “My Yule wish is for my papa to find a new love.”
Potter blinks, as though he is confused by the hostility. “Right, makes sense. There’s something about it that feels like the first day of school all over again.”
“I’m glad you had so much fun” Draco said, giving Scorpius an extra squeeze - it had been strange and lonely in the house without him for so long.
“Rose, this is a very serious situation.” Hermione said, kind but firm. She turned back to Draco. “We could use his hair to track him, maybe, or his magical signature-”
“He’s not here, Draco. What’s wrong?” Hermione asked, getting up from the table in the adjoining dining room.
“Racists.” Harry supplies, being doubly familiar with them having grown up in the Durlsey household.
The boy frowned at his plate, but didn’t say anything. Draco let him pout for a moment, then mentioned his upcoming playdate with Rosie, which launched Scorpius into a lengthy monologue about the imaginary world they had created, bringing the count of Malfoys who couldn’t stop thinking about Harry Potter down to one.
Amani nods “The new place is fantastic, much closer to Yeda’s school and the ministry. I’m doing a project with them and Fran decided to take a sabbatical from the university to be a stay at home parent.”
Draco is browsing Flourish & Blotts with Daphne on a warm Saturday morning in late May. They’ve just enjoyed a lovely breakfast at one of the new cafes that has sprung up in the wake of the war. He’s infinitely grateful that he
“You’re so sad, though.” Scorpius said mournfully, reaching out a small hand to pat Draco’s chest. “Your heart broke.”
“Well, I do love Ginny, but we discovered it was more platonic than romantic. Now she’s married to Luna and I’m-”
Feeling as though he had been caught cheating, Harry flicked his wand to turn off the wireless and wiped the last vestiges of tears from his eyes. “In here!”
Harry has never really listened to music that made him feel anything; it is almost never played at the Dursleys, aside from the carols Aunt Petunia puts on at Christmas, and no one at Hogwarts seems particularly devoted to it either. This might be the first song he has ever heard and enjoyed. The fact that it is with Sirius, that his mum loved this band, makes it all the more significant.
“Only one way to find out!” Ron said, summoning his cloak so that it flew directly into the side of Harry’s head.
The other man sighs, takes a sip of his now cold tea, and makes a face. “No, I knew, but I was pretending it didn’t matter, that we were just in a bad period. She’s Ginny, for Merlin’s sake, she waited for me through the war, she couldn’t wait this out either?”
Harry grinned “There was the added complication that I’d heard this bloke on the wireless and I was embarrassingly smitten with him.”
“In November.” Scorpius said. Rose looked over at him as though it was the first time she had noticed he was there.
He forces himself to focus on the exam, not sparing a glance for the other side of the room where Potter is working diligently through his own. Draco almost forgets about him till somewhere around the third hour when one of the adjudicators asks Potter to cast a Patronus charm. Draco suspects that it is curiosity more than an actual test of skill, Potter's patronus having become synonymous with the wizard himself.
“That’s not on.” Dean says, taking a healthy swig of firewhiskey and raising his hands in a cheer as Quigley, the Bats’ beater, manages to knock the Appleby Arrows’ chaser nearly off her broom with a well-timed bludger.
Scorpius tucked in obediently, but had only taken a couple of mouthfuls when he snuck a glance over at Draco again. “I think Harry would make a good partner.”
The last thing Draco saw as they swirled away was Harry’s face, and the expression of regret that lingered there only fueled his sense of rejection and shame.
Pansy mutters something about wine snobs under her breath as Daphne launches back into her story about a recent date gone awry.
The madman in question is Kingsley Shacklebolt, a wizard mostly undeserving of Harry’s ire. He’s also the one whose box seats they are occupying and whose firewhiskey they are slowly diminishing, but Harry is too preoccupied with self-pity to mind what he says.
Instead, Harry stole pancakes straight from the griddle when Molly wasn’t looking, helped Arthur re-program the new cellular telephone he had received for Christmas and set about building a long train track that ran directly through the chaos with Rose, Scorpius, Fred, and Roxanne. Scorpius stuck very close to Harry, never more than a couple of feet away from him; when they sat down to eat, he pulled his chair close and let Harry fill his plate, answering questions in a quiet voice about what he wanted. Rose sat on Scorpius’ other side and talked animatedly at George, forgetting about her friend at times in her enthusiastic re-telling of what Harry thought must be a dream.
“Well you...meet a person. You decide that maybe you would like to get to know them. Sometimes you ask them out for coffee or a drink-”
“This isn’t the first time, mate.” Ron said, sitting heavily beside Harry on the couch. “This lager was paid for by one of our Harry-bets.”
Harry looked over at Scorpius who seemed to have withdrawn slightly and looked somehow a paler than usual. He nodded, handing Hugo over to Hermione so he could sit beside the other boy.
Amused, Ron re-read the letter and then pulled out his wand to vanish it, but something stopped him. He skimmed the page again, remembering the desperation in Harry’s voice and how sad his best friend had seemed talking about a childless future. Ron liked Anthony just fine, but he had always felt a bit of standoffishness from the man whenever he was around Rosie and Hugo; Anthony was kind and polite, but it was clear he didn’t relish their interactions the way Harry did. Ron looked over at Hugo, who was chewing on the corner of his own jumper, at his wide brown eyes and dark, reddish curls. Ron remembered finding out he was going to be a father. He remembered holding both his children for the first time. Then he remembered the look on Harry’s face when
Scorpius wasn’t sure what to do, so he waited till the next day to consult Rosie; there was something about her that made Rosie seem like she always knew what to do. She was in possession of both keen intelligence and distinct oddness, two factors which made sense to most of the adults who knew the source of her genetic makeup. To other children, Rosie was a force of nature and none dared stand in her path.
“Well that’s sorted.” Rosie said. “Have you thought about how you’re going to convince your papa to go to the festival?”
“Do you think papa will get married again?” Draco heard Scorpius whisper to Pansy when he had turned his back on them to stir the marinara sauce.
Three days after Harry’s visit, at the exact moment (though neither could have known) when Harry and Anthony were breaking up, Hugo Granger-Weasley found the ball of parchment while crawling around on the living room rug. One year old Hugo had a taste for paper of all kinds, so he picked it up and waved it around at his father, excitedly yelling “Da! Da! Da!” until Ron came to see what his son had discovered.
“He’s not, those two witches are together. He’s clearly a third wheel. I bet he’d love it if you talked to him when you went to refill my drink.”
“He was at Daphne and Blaise’s but he’s disappeared.” Draco said, barely able to get the words out. “No one knows when, or how - we think the floo? But we don’t know where he went.”
“She mentions Scorpius all the time.” Potter interjected, and at last Draco allowed himself to meet Potter’s eyes. He was surprised to see that the other man’s face was friendly, relaxed. Gone was the boy who ranged from bristled to outright hostile in Draco’s presence, though that did nothing to quiet Draco’s longing to rib him a little, if only so that Potter would pay attention to him. Draco pushed that desire down, reminding himself that tactic was best left in his school days.
Ron and Hermione shared a look. “Whether or not you’d say yes to Ernie Macmillan when he asked you out on Valentine’s day.” Ron said eventually.
“Neither of us is in a place for that at the moment - besides, we’ve only been seeing each other for a few months.”
“Call me Molly dear. Come on inside, the rest of the family is waiting.” She said, pushing both men through the door toward the dining room. Though Harry had been sure there would just be a few Weasleys to contend with, nearly the entire clan was assembled around a long table: Arthur at the head, Hermione and Ron with Rosie and Hugo, Ginny and Luna, Bill and Fleur, George and Angelina with Roxanne, Percy and Audrey with tiny little Molly the second. Charlie was still on assignment in Siberia, and the rest of the children were at school, but Anthony would meet them over Christmas after he had introduced Harry to his family at their Hanukkah celebration.
“You’re one to talk.” Though she had never come out and said it, they both knew that Pansy had little interest in sex. She enjoyed a solid flirtation, but she hadn’t found a man who wouldn’t eventually try to sleep with her or understood her needs.
Harry and Dean sit in the stands at the Ilkley Moor Quidditch Stadium, ostensibly watching the Appleby Arrows play the Ballycastle Bats, though in reality they have gotten quite drunk off firewhiskey and are both complaining about their relationships with one Ginny Weasley. Dean has just finished an extended rant about sixth year that skirts around the fact that Harry started dating Ginny quite quickly after she and Dean broke up, and now Harry’s grievances have taken center stage.
“Potter” He said, a cold edge to his voice that made Scorpius frown. Draco saw this and softened his tone. “Scorpius! You look like you’re having a nice time?”
“I thought maybe you’d like company for the walk back.” Harry lied, then was surprised to discover that it was not in fact a lie at all.
Once he had extracted himself, giggling, from Rose’s grip, the small boy made his way over to Harry and leaned in to whisper something. Draco watched as Harry bent down to listen, nodded, and enveloped his son in a hug.
Harry flushed. “Seeing as I am still engaged to that man, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“Well, past Draco would have hexed anyone who suggested such a thing. I was terrified of you.” He admitted.
“Teddy isn’t really a child.” Harry said. “He’s almost thirteen. He’ll spend half his time at the Burrow with Victoire anyway. And you know Andy has been sick, she can’t look after him full time anymore. In fact, I’ve been thinking - and I wanted to
“Wait!” Scorpius cried, dropping the snitch he had been holding. “Papa says you have to do the spells first.”
In the end, Draco’s studies had worked to neutralise the mark, enough that he was able to cover it with an utterly meaningless tattoo of a fish. It was done at a muggle shop, and the sight of Voldemort’s handiwork disappearing under the skilled machine of the woman who ran it had given Draco a special thrill.
Potter shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot, suddenly reminiscent of a much younger boy. “Or not, forget I said anything.”
The man didn’t speak for a moment, and when he did his voice was tight. “I - I thought we were doing okay. Do you think you need another parent?”
On the one year anniversary of her death, he decided it was no longer bearable. He packed up their essentials, shut the manor, and moved with Scorpius to a townhome in a wizarding area called The Phoenix District, an “up-and-coming area for the modern witch and wizard nestled covertly within the trendy muggle area of Shoreditch” according to their letting agent. It was also home to an “integrative” primary school bringing together wizarding and muggle-born families under a banner of tolerance. Astoria had always been firm in her belief that Scorpius should never know the prejudices of his paternal ancestors and Draco felt that in her absence he would have to soldier on alone with what they had planned.
Daphne and Blaise’s nanny, Lorna, shook her head, tears falling down her cheeks. “A couple of hours ago. He’s such a good boy, I swear he was fine just sitting in the library.”
“Papa says you’re not doing it properly if you don’t have time for the people you love. Couldn’t you find someone to love?”
“Scorpius is one of the sweetest children I’ve met.” Hermione said, elbowing Ron. “Honestly not a mean bone in his body.”
“It’s fine.” More than fine, really. Draco has been enjoying himself, listening to Potter speak. It reminds him of when Ernest first started practising law and was determined to represent every person in magical Britain should they need a barrister. While Ernest’s enthusiasm has waned considerably over the years, it’s clear that Potter has both a personal and professional attachment to his job.
“That’s-” Draco isn’t sure how to express what he’s feeling.  “I’m impressed by what you’ve chosen to do, Harry.”
Draco desperately wanted to ask after Potter, but couldn’t bring himself to utter the words. He tried to silently will Hermione to reveal even a tidbit of information about her friend, but she seemed almost deliberately elusive, instead volleying the question of careers back at him.
“I heard you and Anthony split?” Draco asked nonchalantly, though his hand had come to rest, knuckles barely grazing Harry's, on the bar.
“Just fetching his bag.” Draco said, and couldn’t help glancing over to where Harry stood. Hermione’s gaze followed and she narrowed her eyes in an attempt to discern what had happened in her absence. Scorpius took that moment to re-appear, setting his bag beside Draco before turning to Ron and Hermione.
Hermione smiled fondly. “Married with not one but two sprogs. Rosie’s the oldest, and then there’s Hugo who is one. As you can tell, Rosie already has a mind of her own, but you don’t have to worry about Scorpius once she’s decided he’s her friend.”
The silence that followed was deeply uncomfortable - Harry wiped invisible soot off his sleeves and Draco looked around the room as though seeing it for the first time.
“I think you were correct about one thing, though.” His temper getting the best of him, Draco flicked his wand, causing the front door to slam open on its hinges. “You do need to leave.”
“Scorpius!” He said, diverting his attention to the monster of a child who had wrung his heart so terribly over the past hour.
Once everyone was seated and had begun eating, Harry clinked his glass. “I have some news.” He began, taking Anthony’s hand. “I wanted you all to meet Anthony because, well, we’re engaged.”
he thinks, but he doesn’t have time to ruminate on what it might be - Malfoy and the healer lead the witch away, and a glance at the clock on the wall reveals that Harry is about to be very late for class.
Draco has always planned things out well in advance of their occurrence, it is how he had convinced himself at eleven that Harry Potter would be his best friend (playing on the same Quidditch Team, going to Hogsmeade together, being the two most popular boys in their year). Given the deeply disappointing result of that particular fantasy he has attempted to curb this tendency in adulthood, but occasionally allows himself to indulge - a man has to have some idea of what he wants, after all.
Ligligan Parul Sampernandu = an annual festival held in mid-December in the City of San Fernando in the Philippines. The festival features a competition of giant lanterns.
This revelation made it difficult for Draco to meet her eyes. He felt all of eleven again, his hand desperately extended toward Potter. Or seventeen, clinging to his back as the flames leapt towards them. He wanted to be asked after. He wanted Potter to be as curious about Draco's life as he was over Potter's.
There’s a beat of uncomfortable silence. Harry rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. “Actually, Ginny and I split up.”
“When Hermione said you two were having coffee I was a bit surprised.” Weasley interjected, and Draco’s gaze swung to him - he had finally grown into his body, broad shouldered and stocky, his freckled face bearing a stronger jaw than he’d had in his youth. Draco could even admit - secretly, in a place he would never, ever reveal to another living soul - that Weasley might have gotten handsome.
