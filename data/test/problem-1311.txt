“We’re Aurors. Well, I’m not really an Auror, but I belong to a different division inside the DMLE. I’m a Cursebreaker. This is a joint mission between our two subdivisions, all orchestrated by the Department of Mysteries. They sent us here to clear the house. We’re sure there are powerful artifacts hidden, as well as this house is believed to be the hideout of the necromancer we’ve been trying to catch for several months.”
“No.” It’s all Harry’s mind can supply as he sinks to the ground, more devastated than he thought he could ever feel. “No.” Of all the things that could happen, all the horrible things he’s seen during the war, he never once thought this would be the one to break him. He has a hard time comprehending what he’s seeing, hasn’t even, in his wildest, darkest dream, thought this could actually happen.
His tongue plunders Draco’s mouth, leaving no room for anything else in his lovers mind. He doesn’t tangle his tongue with the other but strokes and rubs, sucking the fresh taste of toothpaste away and replacing it with their mingled essence, something uniquely Harry and uniquely Draco. He withdraws, getting a few puffs of breath in before he attacks again, sucking the full lower lip between his teeth, sometimes biting it just short of drawing blood, then licking at it soothingly.
Draco feels the stress of the day and his fierce headache slip away as the moon comes up.
“Dragon, you remember our audience from the bar? That bloke that couldn’t get enough of you? You liked how he watched our every move, didn’t you?”
Harry follows every move, every stroke of those golden wings, excited and, if he is honest, extremely turned on. With a chuckle he realises that it’s the desired effect. He can’t wait to get his hands on Draco, to touch those feathers, feel their softness.
This year is more calm and laid-back than the years before. The children are all grown up now, and with Rose and Roxanne still at the beginning of their pregnancies it will be some time before the flurry of crying babies and soiled nappies will start again.
It hadn’t always been like this. This casual acceptance of their living arrangements, of his relationship, of Draco’s creature.
Malfoy watches him the whole time with a self-satisfied smirk on his face, like he knows exactly what Harry thinks. But it’s okay. He really earned it, being patient and keeping Harry company today.
They once swore to care for each other in health and sickness, but Draco recognises it now. Harry cared, so much, but Draco didn’t. He wallowed in his pain, in his desperation, hurting himself and his husband in the process.
Draco whines when Harry’s hands let go of his throat and wrists and he’s pulled down from the horse. He pants heavily, the rush of adrenaline slowly receding.
It's long gone now.
He can’t remember all the words, not even a handful of occasions, but he remembers probably the most important one.
Last time it had been Draco, nearly breaking down under the pressure of eighteen hour work shifts, after the Prophet had released a series of articles describing how teenage wizards and witches liked to spend their time in foreign countries. All of them included some sort of getting high on certain potions ingredients and either flying brooms, playing tag by Apparating through the country or mock dueling. The following three weeks were filled with broken bones, splinched limbs and the tragic deaths of three witches that believed their Levitation Charms were enough to jump from the London Eye and get down like a feather. Not only was St. Mungo's full of injured teenagers (never mind the mass of irresponsible adults), but the Obliviators had to work overtime.
“You should think about becoming a tailor. Or an image consultant or something.” It bursts out when he sees Malfoy critically raising an eyebrow, rubbing his chin as he contemplates if orange is one of Harry’s colours. He’s - obviously - a summer type, whatever that means.
“How could I forget?”
Harry teasingly touches along the sturdy leather rings, relishing in the way they are tight on hot flesh. The slit is weeping the first small drops of precome, and he leans forward to lick them up. From this close, he can smell the arousal, a natural musk that has his mouth salivating and his own erection at attention.
His dragon doesn’t look happy when he turns and moves over to the bar, but Harry couldn’t care less. He likes to watch the enticing swing of his hips, the round arse that’s barely concealed by the tight fit of the dress. Likes to watch Draco squirm as the bartender pins him with a knowing look like he knows all their secrets, especially the one Draco’s barely able to hide.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts like a bitch, his muscles scream at him like he’s just run a marathon, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had anything to drink in days. Despite all that, he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light typical for a winter day in Scotland.
The next week happens in a blur. Harry does everything like he normally would, getting up before the others to enjoy a long, hot shower with some additional pleasure, rolling his eyes at the antics of Ron and Hermione, Neville and Luna, Ernie MacMillan and Dennis Creevey, or every other lovey-dovey couple. He goes to his classes, does his homework, eats in the Great Hall, and learns some more after supper, so he can get a good result in his NEWTs.
Harry kneels before him, lifts the knife and runs it almost lovingly over Malfoy’s hollow cheeks, his split lip, his scarred chest. On his way down he accidentally nicks a nipple, causing fresh trickles of blood to run down the otherwise deadly pale chest.
Harry fears the first Saturday every couple of months. He defeated Voldemort when he was seventeen, he chases dark wizards for a living and he lives with Draco, who can be a scary bastard if he intends to. Still he fears those dates more.
“Remember last time when we were stressed this much?”
The matter is settled when Harry puts a hand on his shoulder. It’s just a suggestion, he can back out any time he likes, but Draco loves it when his husband takes charge.
“Hop on, Harry, the train will take you where you want to go.”
Harry reacts fast, snapping his fingers, and the leash wraps itself around Draco’s cock, squeezing the base and preventing the orgasm with another burst of pain. Draco’s eyes glaze over as he is cheated out of his climax and he cries out in disappointment. His body goes rigid, causing the humbler to inflict more pain, and he collapses into himself, frustrated tears leaking into the dark wood of the steps.
They talk Quidditch for some minutes. The Harpies are from another world this season, slaughtering the other teams effortlessly. Ginny on the trainer bench seems to be the best thing that could happen to them and only Merlin knows what will happen next season, when they are all well-practiced.
“Ha ha,” he replies to the silent challenge, but the longer he thinks about it, the more he can see it is actually funny. Back in fourth year it hadn’t been, not even remotely, when he’d had to fight for his life and the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs had made it their mission to make it even more miserable. But now, after the war, after everything, he can see it as a simple prank, maybe a bit out of line, but not vicious. Not the work of a Death Eater in training, but the doings of a school boy.
He carefully mashes the potatoes with milk, butter, grated nutmeg and adds his secret ingredient: cinnamon. Harry always wants to know what it is that makes Draco’s mashed potatoes so special, but he withholds it every time. Not even the meanest torture - Harry tickling him until he can’t breathe - can pry it from his lips.
Malfoy looks at the mushed roll longingly but ultimately shakes his head.
He brings his patients pink and black tulips that help cheer them up, even if most of his young patients don’t know the meaning of it. Sometimes their parents bring him twigs of agrimony. He loves the subtlety of flowers. To most they’re just pretty, but to some they hold whole conversations.
His suit is cleaned and ready, expensive Italian wool, hand-woven with magic-infused threads. There are more special properties, but he’s forgotten them conveniently, although Draco would point out how savage he is to not appreciate the suit in the right way. Harry just likes the colour, a deep black, and the way it feels on his skin like he’s wearing nothing at all.
That’s the moment Harry clears his throat, eyebrow raising in question. The girl looks up guiltily, like he caught them in the act, and Harry’s heart pounds painfully in his chest. He thought they were over this, over those devastating secrets of the past, of sneaking off to do who-knows-what. Malfoy, in turn, doesn’t look guilty at all, but he has his poker face on. Suddenly it seems Ron is right: Malfoy is, indeed, up to something.
Sydney: I googled who is the most sexually open and it's either Australia or Iceland. Since I thought Iceland is too cold in July (now that I think of, it's winter in Sydney, so that's not really the point) I decided on Australia and Sydney. Which brought up the problem that everything happens inside an opera house and of course the Sydney Opera House doesn't even have privat boxes. So we have to chalk it up to artistic license.
It’s a sentiment to the situation that Draco doesn’t try to refuse, not that he could talk back even if he wanted to.
The internet says the Kilimanjaro is one of the easiest mountains to climb. It seems reasonable that Harry would try his hand on it, even if the whole thing of actually climbing a mountain just to have sex is unreasonable af.
It's half an hour later when Draco finally stirs from his post-coital snuggle-high and slowly slides down Harry's chest to settle on his side. His long, elegant fingers card through Harry's pelt, soft touches that mean nothing but comfort. He wonders if it's early enough for a second round or if he should catch up on sleep.
“I saw you with Malfoy,” Ron says between two bites of kidney pie. Half-chewed pieces of meat spill out between his words and Hermione chokes. Harry raises one eyebrow in an imitation of the mentioned Malfoy, but he chooses not to comment. If he doesn’t make a big deal out of it, maybe the others won’t either. He should know better.
Draco is still blushing like a virgin, his gaze flitters from shelf to shelf without looking at them too long. It’s endearing how prim he is, despite their passionate relationship and his work as a Healer. He barely is able to talk about it without an embarrassed grimace, and sighs dramatically whenever Harry gets around to dirty talk. He still explodes every time into tiny pieces and Harry loves to put him back together afterwards.
“No,” Harry whispers, afraid if he says it out loud, then it will become true.
They’re both riding the fence of excitement and frustration, and it’s probably the best feeling in the world. It’s a pity when the bell finally announces that the second act is soon to begin. With a sigh Harry pushes Draco back to his feet, hands ready to steady him. He’s wobbly on his feet, the situation not helped by the unfamiliar heels.
He slowly sinks down on the settee, the pressure falling from him as the music washes away the nastiness that is St. Mungo’s.
There were so many first times, and not the obvious ones. Sure, their first kiss was magnificent, and the first time they had sex - there aren’t words to describe that.
For a split second Draco sees all of his past mistakes floating before his eyes, paralysing him as his breathe swooshes out of him, leaving him empty, speechless, unable to see past them. Just as he thinks he will pass out, embarrass himself in front of all these people, a slight chuckle dissolves all the dark thoughts and just like that, everything is easy.
Harry swallows heavily, tears flowing anew, and he can’t help but feel small and hopeless at this moment. He’s about to die, and his only company are the shades of his family and friends. He feels small, powerless, can’t stop the question that comes out of his quaking lips.
They both moan obscenely when his mouth closes over a sensitive nipple. It’s hard and gets even harder as he sucks fervently, eliciting groans and whimpers that are music to his ears. His tongue plays with the ring, pulling at it teasingly, and he feels the burst of precome through his dress shirt.
Harry was tempted many times in his life, mainly to use blunt objects on stubborn people. He remembers some of those times fondly, like when Ron drove him mad in the dorms with his snoring, or that one memorable time when even Hermione had been bothered by her own voice and willingly shut up, even before Harry could give her one of his not-so-subtle looks.
When he comes back with two glasses of champagne, his face is aflame with embarrassment, but his breathing is heavier. He’s an exhibitionistic slut, just like Harry likes to show him around for people to see. They don’t indulge in this kind of scene often, so it’s even more exciting.
“I’m sure that will go over well. ‘Hire Draco Malfoy, former Death Eater, to advise you on style and public presentation. For references see Harry Potter and the deceased Dark Lord, who didn’t listen to Mr Malfoy’s admirable sense of fashion - and look how that turned out!’ I’ll stick to my cauldrons and books, if you don’t mind.”
“Urgh, Malfoy, there’s a mistletoe above us.” It’s all he can say before Malfoy’s lips are on his and they’re kissing. Harry’s brain freezes for a second or two, unsure if it’s the cold or the fact that Malfoy. Is. Kissing. Him.
He knows how much Harry longs for a connection to his parents. Except for an album full of pictures that Hagrid collected more than a couple of decades ago, there is nothing he owns of them, nothing to remember them by. Until Hermione and Draco went out to collect the hopefully best birthday present ever.
There are other things: the almost manic sarcasm, that badly hides Draco's self-deprecation. He likes to tell people he's their superior, better, stronger, more intelligent. More beautiful. He is, Harry knows, their family knows, their friends. The only one who doesn't know is Draco and he only tells people how much better he is to offend them, not because he means it. To himself, he always seems to be the stupid sixteen year old who did the wrong choices for the right reasons. He never progressed past the self-hatred.
He tries to scream, but his throat is locked up, his body paralysed and his nerve endings fried by the unimaginable torture.
He sees Draco blush as they step into the building, probably embarrassed by the mistake, but Harry doesn’t blame the bloke. Draco looks ethereal in the dress, his body and features just feminine enough that he could be confused for a woman. His long hair just plays into the illusion.
“So, what do you want to do this evening? I don’t have to be in before ten o’clock tomorrow morning.”
Something whispers to him, not the voice from before, but something else, something more helpful. It tells him that he and Malfoy are alone in this house, that Malfoy is helpless, that nobody will hear him scream. He only has to find the fucking traitor.
His Veela sighs in contentment, the grand gestures of affection pleasing the creature deep inside of him. It’s a secret they haven’t shared with anyone, haven’t felt the need ever since Draco made the first step and confessed his deep-felt love for Harry and revealed they were mates. It’s something so private not even Hermione and Weasel, pardon, Ron, know it. To Draco it’s just another string connecting them, tightening a bond that already withstood war and Death himself.
Then came the Dark Lord and with him terror Draco had never known before. In the endless hours, trapped inside the Manor, not even his mind was a safe place. But the only way for Draco to experience any kind of freedom, between endless bouts of torture and abuse, was to let his mind wander, to relive his childhood dreams.
He looks Malfoy in the eyes, and suddenly a dam seems to break and his laughter sputters out of him. It breaks the slight tension in Malfoy’s shoulders, something he only discovers now that it’s gone, and they both raise their glasses and chink them together.
(See the end of the chapter for
I am sorry for the delay, but the previous weeks have been hectic and will be for quite some time.
“Why are you smiling?” Draco mumbles, sleep still heavily evident.
As he finally gets home from another draining shift, plagued by an equally draining headache, the wireless is already humming, slow and muted, in the den. It’s barely audible from where he stands, and he watches the heartwarming scene in front of him.
“Ah, yes, your birthday present,” Calliope says from further into the shop. She isn’t visible in the dim light, but it does nothing to reduce her dominant presence. Draco feels her even more, reigning over them like a queen. He swallows nervously at the slight tension in the room.
He needs to start and take charge of himself again. Healing starts with wanting to get better, he tells his own patients so often, most of the long-term residents of the ward fling them back at him with a smirk.
As their lips meet and golden wings close around them like a cocoon of warmth and everlasting love, the sun finally vanishes behind the horizon.
“Can I sit here?”
“Harry, my boy.”
“Just tap the middle two times and think of the person you want to reach.”
“What do you think, Dragon?” Harry whispers, voice rough, his timbre low with desire. Draco shivers at the pet name.
It looks delicious, just like every other year, and Harry’s heart aches with bittersweet familiarity.
And that's another Bad Habit of his, not trusting others can do the job as well as he can.
Their next kiss is the complete opposite. It’s brutal and forceful, aggressive and so hot, Harry has to suppress his own moan. It would be unwise to show his obvious desire so early into the game. He has made Draco wait, he can do his own sweet time of waiting.
A whimper draws him to an expensive-looking couch (a faint voice insists that it's a chaise longue). The green velvet is faded with age, but the gold embroidery gleams in the light almost preternaturally. The pattern is intricate, reminding Harry of the snakes in Myrtle's bathroom, strangely alive for something inanimate. The whimper comes from behind the couch. The fact that it's Harry's own name doesn't register once he sees who cowers there.
The hoarse voice gives Harry plenty of ideas and he isn’t the only one taking interest. Despite the sated tiredness he felt minutes ago, he is ready for another round of earth shattering sex.
“Alright. Talk,” Harry says, barely suppressing the hostility in his voice. He lifts an eyebrow, a gesture that is strange and familiar at the same time. He didn’t use to do it before, but it feels natural to do it now. He’s sitting a foot away, close enough to see even more.
The initial cut is easy, although the bloodcurdling scream it provokes grates on his nerves. The crescendo of voices paralyses him for precious moments, but as Malfoy’s voice dies out in a coughing fit, there is still a second voice frantically shouting.
After minutes of silence, he finally asks: “What do we do now?”
They sit quietly, listening to the end of the final act, content in each other’s company.
The regular steps are far too high for Draco to make it, and while Harry loves to inflict pain, he isn’t that twisted. It’s just about adding a little spice to their lives.
At supper, a huge eagle owl delivers a tiny slip of paper. “Tomorrow, 3 o’clock” it says, nothing more. It isn’t signed but Harry knows exactly who sent it to him. He's kind of excited at the prospect and feels himself smile for a long time that evening. Hermione looks at him, both annoyingly and kind of knowingly, but he doesn’t mind.
“You know, I’ve had a lovely time so far. We both deserved an evening away from England. But I’m sure you’re asking yourself why we’ve been this tame so far. It isn’t our style, I know, but I wanted to try something different. And since you always tell me that I don’t take you out enough, and ‘we never do anything cultural’,“ Harry raises his hands to make exaggerated quotation marks, teasing good-naturedly, “I thought we could go to the opera.”
He knows he should let go, should forgive himself at least a little bit. But it’s hard, knowing that his actions decades ago cause a little girl’s death today.
It’s the strangest double date they ever had. Pansy is almost tame, shooting her poisonous barbs at those who really deserve it, namely impatient patients and crude criminals. Blaise recounts his day at the office, and serves them perfectly made spag bol, followed by chocolate lava cake. It’s perfect and Harry enjoys every minute, something he hasn’t thought possible after the hat incident.
He can still feel the touch of his family, has only to look around to see traces of everyone he holds dear in his life.
With a pleased sigh, Harry turns on the spot and Apparates directly into the entrance hall of Grimmauld Place. He slowly sets the parcel down, gets out of his Auror robes and puts them on the hook next to an exquisitly tailored cloak. It costs a small fortune, but every time Harry sees it hanging next to his plain old Ministry robes, his heart swells and butterflies are let loose in his belly like the first time he saw it.
It looks like King’s Cross, but it isn’t. Harry thinks he can hear trains in the distance, but all he sees is white. He’s calm, collected, and he thinks it’s pretty neat for a seventeen year-old who recently died. The thought floats away, like the vapour of a steam engine.
Harry finally remembers some of his education, transforming the bloody handkerchief into a disfigured cup. It looks hideous, but the crest survives, and it doesn't leak, so he counts it as a win. It takes forever to coax Malfoy to drink from it, but the water seems to help revive him a bit. When his grey eyes fixate on Harry, there’s recognition there.
Malfoy is deep in thought, staring at nothing, and Harry feels compelled to at least give it a try and engage him in a conversation.
Harry swallows when he takes in the picture. Draco’s lips are on the same level as his crotch, and Harry’s dick perks with interest at the picture. His blond hair, usually straight, is wavy and pulled into a messy ponytail, a few bangs framing his face. It invites Harry to run his hands through it, grabbing it, and force Draco to just take it when he fucks his mouth. He barely suppresses a moan at the idea, but he can’t start the festivities before they have officially begun. Regretfully. It’s tempting to just call it all off and just stay at home in their dungeon.
The picture that captures Draco’s attention is dark, almost black. He can barely make out the body part that is pictured, which is, probably, a female breast. What’s more captivating is the small golden hoop that glints in the light. It looks ethereal, like some kind of star with its own corona. The light breaks around the delicate lines, simply executed, but it’s what makes the ring so beautiful.
While his creature is capable of bearing children, it’s highly unlikely he and Harry will ever have one of their own. Male pregnancies are an extremely rare thing amongst wizards. Everything has to be perfect. The partners have to have the same amount of magic, even the same frequency. They need to be of nearly the same age, same physical conditions, same medical history.
For a moment their eyes meet, grey and green, but then somebody bumps into Harry from behind and the moment is broken. When he turns back to Malfoy, he’s staring overly hard at a display of Cockroach Clusters, like they hold the answers to every question, so Harry leaves him to it, roaming the shop.
He remembers many silent nights, when his only company were Hermione's tears.
Of course the war is seared to his brain. He will never forget that moment of stunned silence, right after the Patronus crashed Bill and Fleur's wedding and only a few breaths before panic made them run from the scene.
Each of them can cook and they’re both doing fine on their own. But every time they are cooking together, it ends in a bloody mess. Draco pinches his nose, slowly massaging his painfully pulsing eyes with his thumb and forefinger. It’s one of those days, when the light thrashes spikes of agony through his skull and every sound sends violent vibrations in his brain.
His voice now is guttural, broken, and so hoarse Harry’s throat hurts in sympathy. Malfoy tries to muffle his cries with his hands, and Harry sees blood, tears, and snot dripping from his fingers. It’s ugly and messy, and definitely not just a show. Not even Malfoy is that good an actor.
When Harry pulls out, Draco’s voice is wrecked with need.
The room is completely unfamiliar; it's not a dorm but looks like a real bedroom. A simple door leads to a bathroom, a fact he's making use of immediately. The water that comes out of the ancient-looking brass faucet tastes like copper, but it's refreshingly cool and soothes his parched throat. With the water, his headache finally recedes until it's only a soft thrum in his skull, light enough to ignore it altogether.
“No stopping now, slut. Give this man what he wants to see!”
But Harry surprised him when he wanted to know everything about the many adventures Draco had experienced. He asked the right questions and even encouraged Draco to do it more often.
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. It happens from time to time that he stumbles into a different bed - once memorably he fell asleep next to Terry Boot, which ended with an epic cuddle fest. He blushes fiercely at the thought, glad he's obviously alone. He doesn't want to imagine what Ron would have to say, finding him in a strange bed, beet red. His mate has developed quite the mouth on him ever since he and Hermione broke up. Too many differences, she had said, and Harry could believe that. After the War, many things are different.
He picks up a crimson robe on his way out of the bedroom and conveniently finds his wand in one of the pockets. The hallway outside the room is dark and dusty, littered with scraps of faded wallpaper, broken furniture, and glass shards. The windows are boarded up, letting only the faintest rays of light inside, just enough so Harry doesn’t hurt himself on the debris.
When they part for the night with promises to meet again to avoid the happy courting, Harry feels lighter and happier than the months before. Who would’ve thought that the person he gets along with best nowadays is Draco Malfoy, his former nemesis and all-around pain in the arse.
Draco pulls out the small box and places it on the kitchen table. His husband is on a lookout and will likely be away for the next two days. The Healer in Draco worries about his heavy workload, but Harry wouldn’t have it any other way. It’s always 120% with him.
As he sinks onto the sofa now, emotionally exhausted by the day and the knowledge that he could have helped if people would have let him, Draco closes his eyes. His head pounds from a headache, but it isn’t the debilitating pain he experienced months before, but a mere inconvenience and a sure sign for stress.
The tumbler of firewhisky is almost empty and Harry lets the last sip of it roll around his tongue, savours the heady flavour of honey and sherry only Glenmorangie has, glad he was introduced to the finer whiskey brands. Just as he sets the tumbler down, his present moans again, this time weaving actual words in it.
Pain spikes through Draco’s skull, an agony he has never known before. It feels like his brain is simultaneously pierced by an ice pick and ripped apart by harsh claws, while somebody uses a blunt knife to dissect it.
While Draco and the Veela are one, they are separate beings too. It’s hard to explain. They belong together, but they don’t. They share the same body, the same thoughts, the same mannerism, but they don’t. Sometimes when Harry looks into his husband’s eyes, he can see the creature stare back beneath the mesmerising grey. In the beginning it freaked him out, just a little bit, but now he’s as familiar with Draco as he’s with himself.
Sometimes he thinks about mundane things like his first kiss - and he can look at it now from the distance of decades and smile at his teenage insecurities and shortcomings.
They exchange small gifts quite regularly, sometimes just a single flower or the chocolate Harry likes so much (the cheap one from Tesco) or Draco’s favourite food.
And, despite being together for Merlin-knows-how-long, the Veela still drives him mad with want and desire. Although Harry thinks he must be immune to its allure by now, he still catches himself doing questionable things trying to get its attention.
Harry smirks. Seems like he won this round.
It wasn’t the only fight. Harry remembers vividly every single intervention.
“You see, this house belonged to the French nobleman Gille de Rais. He was a war hero, fought at Jeanne d’Arc’s side against the British. Later he was found to be a serial killer, kidnapping, raping, and killing children from villages all over the region. The necromancer was actually one of his accomplices, Francesco Prelati. I don’t know why he surfaced now, but he obviously set out to revive Gille de Rais. Only, he didn’t resurrect de Rais, but somehow melded his spirit with the house, creating something sentient. The house is keeping us from leaving, and it’s trying to keep us separated… although it worries me that it allows for us to meet occasionally.”
“Harry.”
It’s why they don’t do this often, only on special occasions, but since next year he enters a new and exciting stage of his life (Hermione’s words), they won’t have time to indulge in drawn-out fantasies.
What’s more important is that it’s never quiet around their cottage. Harry needs the wireless like he needs air. It’s always emitting music, and it doesn’t even matter what programme they’re listening to. It can be Celestina Warbeck, who has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure for Draco (not that he would ever admit that without torture), or some of that confusing Muggle Hip Hop.
The Manor lays dark and lifeless behind him as he reaches the crest of the hill. The sun already touches the snow-covered trees of the forest below, a play of red, orange, yellow and purple firing up the sky. It’s peaceful, despite the dark history weighing on the land.
It was almost by chance that Draco found out that changing to his more primal side soothes the pain for a few days. It also makes him more needy and clingy afterwards, which is why he doesn’t let it out as much as he needs. He only gives into the urge when the pain becomes unbearable, like today, when he woke up with a fierce pounding in his skull. He knows he should see a Healer, headaches this severe and often aren’t common or healthy. But Healers are the worst patients and it’s not like his colleagues would know what is wrong with him.
The last week had been exhausting and filled with endless hours of gruesome Auror work. It's a difficult case of human trafficking and the tension that was mounting up all week finally collapsed tonight in a explosion of robes and pants, aggressive kisses and finger-shaped bruises. They both had surely needed it.
It’s a bleak evening, a thunderstorm wrecking the countryside and Harry is still out there, somewhere, arresting a bunch of baby Death Eaters who think it’s cool to slaughter a bunch of Muggle school kids. Draco feels incredibly lonely and his head kills him. The pain potions don’t work as well as they used to, and the thunder rivals the drumming in his skull. Worst of all is the boredom. He’s too tired to cook or do any other chores, and the bright lights of the telly make the headache worse.
It was the first time he said it, but Harry will never forget it, and until this day it’s his Patronus memory.
“That’ll just complicate things, but it’s no surprise,” Malfoy says. He tries to get up again but doesn’t have much luck this time either. He seems weaker, like Harry’s memory loss sucked a good portion of energy out of him.
Despite the Prophet and the people at the hospital, those who matter have long since forgiven him for what he did or didn’t do. He talked to Harry, naturally, and they both apologised for being stupid, pigheaded gits. They both forgave themselves for what they did to each other. For Sectumsempra and stomping on noses. For snitching on Hagrid’s dragon and enjoying forced transfigurations into animals, and many more.
“What are you doing here? Your Patronus said you’d be gone the whole evening.”
“Neville is a master at Herbology too,” Harry says deviantly, just to say something.
Meanwhile, Harry has both hands free to create an even better show for their lone audience. He wrenches Draco’s head up, hand buried deep into blond locks, and forces Draco to really look at the man. He pauses visibly, but it’s to be expected.
He has specific songs for specific situations at work. For stressful days he prefers the Weird Sisters; Myron Wagtails raspy voice has the unique ability to just “blow” the pressure away.
Malfoy’s jumper is torn, separated by what looks like claw marks. There are shallow wounds visible underneath, crisscrossed by old scars. They’re the marks left by Sectumsempra, Harry realises, and that feeling of satisfaction wells up in him again. It’s something he can’t understand; the curse was probably the worst thing he’s ever done. And yet.
It’s a good thing Harry is too distracted by the fact that he and Draco are dating now to notice Draco subtly swishing his wand. The mistletoe nestled in the fairy lights slowly unfastens, flying silently through the air. Another mistletoe pinned to the window of Spintwitches follows, as well as one hanging from a streetlamp a few metres between the next shop window, which is equally adorned.
Buried under his favourite woollen blanket, his thought drift off to a sunnier place with palms and a soft breeze ruffling his hair. Fergus greets him, explaining that Princess Lillian misses her golden circlet and they need Draco’s help to retrieve it.
“Let them think what they want to. I’m sure they will come up with a believable explanation.” With that he picks up his bag and leaves.
And Harry lets himself go, just for a moment, when nothing can reach him inside the safe cocoon that are his husband’s arms.
Draco is about to follow when a short but sharp twinge flashes through his skull. It's over in seconds, gives him the feeling of an impending headache that will last for hours. It never actually happens, but Draco is sick of the strange pressure in his skull, never really hurting but also never going away anymore.
So Harry walked the halls, trying to find something to soothe his wounded mind - or at least distract him for a few hours. That day it happened in the form of suppressed sobs, coming from an empty classroom to his left.
There is the tree house George and Ron built for Rose and Hugo and that will soon be used by the next generation of Weasley kids.
It was then, right in the middle of a heated argument, when they all heard Draco cry out. It was a piercing scream, echoing through the empty halls, reaching them in the sitting room. They all bolted upstairs, Harry always two steps ahead, to find Draco in utter distress, shaken by nightmares, crying.
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s outrageous, the thought that not only he and Ginny don't date anymore, but that he could be gay. There are no blokes he’s ever had the wish to get to know on a deeper level. Or see naked. Sure, there was that typical teenager curiosity in the Quidditch locker room, but that was perfectly normal for fifteen or sixteen. Malfoy is just pulling his chain.
Harry catches Hermione’s eyes and gives her a short nod. She waves her wand, a slow movement, much like a baton and music plays softly from somewhere. Draco holds his breath and begins to count in his head. At thirteen they have to do the first step, at thirty eight the first twist and at two hundred ten everything will be over.
Time flies by as he creates a masterpiece, but before long his eyes catch the silver ring again. He forces Malfoy’s hand in the air, the protest weak now that the blood is flowing freely from numerous wounds. Harry looks at the knife and realises it isn’t strong enough to make a clean cut, not through skin and flesh, sinews and bone. He contemplates for a minute, but then decides on keeping it - hacking and slashing will drive the lesson home even better.
His wand is in his hand without him noticing as if his anger has summoned it, and maybe it has.
“Alright.” Harry picks up the lumpy bundle of bread rolls, holding one out to Malfoy. “Here, are you hungry? I don’t know where I got them from, but they seem to be okay.”
“Please, Sir, please,” Draco’s voice is wrecked by arousal and fear, but he doesn’t dare say ‘no’ to Harry. If all else fails, he can use his safeword, but in their thirteen years together, he only used it three times. They know each other and their limits well enough.
And then there were Pansy and Blaise, storming Grimmauld Place in the middle of the night, nearly waking Draco after a horrible day at the hospital. He had just lost his first patient and was devastated. It took Harry several hours to calm him down enough to sleep.
But this is the real world and Draco reigns the Veela in, aware that life can’t be all fluffy wings and ecstatic sex.
The hallway with the stairs and the kitchen opens into another room that seems to be some kind of parlour. The walls are lined with bookcases, overstuffed with books, some of them so old they radiate their ancientness like an aura. Most of them are in a language Harry can’t read nor properly recognise. The letters are Latin, but they don’t make any sense like he forgot how to read while being unconscious. The fact that it’s entirely possible freaks him out, but is eerily soothing at the same time. He’s suddenly an adult, in a strange place; not being able to read seems like a minor worry.
He remembers the many tears spilled on both sides, his own impotent fury that nobody was giving him a chance, not one benefit of doubt. Molly Weasley in desperation that her Harry was seeing a Death Eater, throwing his life away.
“Can you sit down with me? Maybe we can jog your memories.” His expression is pleading and needy and plain wrong in Harry’s opinion.
"That bad?" Harry asks. The worried tone in his voice makes Draco feel loved and cared for.
“Is it like you imagined?” Draco asks, shyly looking down. The heels make him taller than Harry, but his posture is already submissive and he appears smaller, more elegant.
He takes Harry’s hand, restless now that his nature is revealed, and takes them down the path to the paddock near the woods. When he was young, his mother bred Abraxans and Draco watched them running around, strong and free and beautiful.
It’s the perfect place for them to take a stroll, enough space to not disturb the wings, but with the beauty of Wiltshire and the first stars as company. Harry hums in contentment, his thumb slowly caressing Draco’s. They don’t need much words in moments like this.
There’s a conflict brewing in his mind. Malfoy seems to know some answers, and he’s weak. Even if Harry doesn’t attack him immediately, he has no doubt he could react fast and strong enough to get the upper hand. But sitting down and listening would mean giving Malfoy what he wants, and Harry’s never been less inclined to comply. In the end his curiosity wins, and it helps that he clearly has all the advantages of the situation.
But he hates the galas the Ministry holds. They just want to show off their golden boy, their Saviour, and it doesn’t matter if Harry actually likes to be there. His presence is required, since he is not only the Boy-Who-Lived-Twice but also an invaluable asset to the DMLE. It’s bad enough that he has to hold endless speeches about things better left unsaid, ripping the barely healed wounds of the war open again and again. No, the worst thing is that: as Harry’s husband, Draco needs to attend every single one of them.
It will probably take months to clean up the mess the necromancers left behind. They will spend hundreds of hours bagging evidence, cataloguing it and filling files until Harry’s hand will beg him to just cut it off. On those days, he isn’t sure why he desperately wanted to be an Auror.
But of course, Harry is. He steps behind Draco, pulling his arms behind his back. The position forces Draco to bear down onto the cushion, grinding his weight more firmly into the horse.
“Very well.” Dumbledore gets up from the bench and claps into his hands. “You’re sure?”
"Maybe one of us should sit down. We're no good togethers. A bit bold to assume this time it would work." There's no accusation in Harry's words. They're way past such petty things like your fault and my fault. Sometimes it's better to admit you can't do everything together.
His eyes zero in on the simple silver ring on Malfoys right thumb. There is an echo in his head, another voice.
On the desk of his overgrown office is a picture and it might be his most treasured one. To the unsuspecting eye it’s just a picture of their wedding; both grooms smiling brightly into the camera, proudly presenting their rings. The notable part of the picture aren’t the men, though. It’s the huge bouquet that Draco holds. It’s made up of primroses, bellflowers and anemones, quite unusual choices for a wedding, but the message they tell screams brightly in yellow, red and blue: eternal love.
There are voices coming from the kitchen and it makes Harry instantly suspicious. There should only be one voice - and Draco isn’t prone to monologuing. He stops dead in his tracks when he reaches kitchen.
“Because you wouldn’t spend time with him if you didn’t think he was.” It comes out as something else entirely, more grunts and moans, but they’ve known each other long enough that Ron understands his sleep-drunken ramblings and Harry is fluent in meal-speech. He thinks about the answer to that, if it’s worth the fight that will inevitably follow, and decides to just shrug. He doesn’t really have anything else. It’s nice to spend time with Malfoy, because, once you know him, he’s a decent bloke. He’s fun to be around, he knows a lot of things other than pureblood crap, and when they went to Spintwitches Sporting Supplies, he didn’t complain once when Harry took almost an hour to compare one pair of Seeker gloves with another. He even gave some helpful advice - it paid off to talk to another Seeker. Ron never had the patience to discuss matters of wearing comfort and the difference between Thestral leather and normal pig leather.
He doesn’t get it. Instead, Malfoy sighs, like the burden on his shoulders just doubled. He doesn’t seem surprised in the least.
Harry lets his left hand wander down to Draco’s cock, tenting the dress obscenely. It’s hot and damp under his palm, the dress likely ruined, but Draco presses into his touch immediately and despite their audience.
He’s stopped mumbling and instead watches every move, flinching whenever Harry moves too fast or outside his line of vision. It’s painful to watch, this kind of helplessness.
“It’s time, Harry,” she says, putting her arms around him, a final hug until they see each other again. It probably won’t be long. “You have been so brave all your life, we are so proud of you. Your father and I loved you from the moment you came into our world, and we will always love you, until the end of times. We couldn’t have wished for a better son.”
Harry tries to be a temptation on his own. He knows Veelas not only like a good show of their mate’s qualities, but they like to watch and to be wooed in every possible way. It’s almost the same with a human partner, but still a bit different.
Aaaand if you like to see the
He is appreciated by his colleagues, has published a number of scientific articles that granted him the respect of other Healers around the world and is frequently consulted about dark curses. He helped countless patients, but still some refuse. It hurts more than Draco likes to admit, but there’s nothing he can do about it.
When they enter the Ministry, they are swarmed by reporters. The children cling even more to him, terrified by all the ruckus. Of course the disappearance of five children in five days caught everyone's attention, but now that they're all safe, reporters are the last thing anybody needs.
The Annual Weasley Picnic is probably the most stressful day of the year - and definitely the best. Harry loves the manic anticipation of his adopted family.
Harry lets his hands slide over the black metal of the humbler. It was a hard decision which one to pick, since there were so many different ones to choose from, but with a bit of help from Calliope he settled on a plain model. Black, smooth metal, curved like a double s-letter, nothing else. He could have picked something archaic or something vicious-looking, a humbler combined with manacles or fitted with a cage, but he doesn’t need all that. Instead he has requested a series of runes he can change for different purposes. They are carved delicately into the metal, glowing faintly silver in their default setting. They’re for later though, for their first time he wants to take it slow.
He hasn’t seen Draco since his departure seven days ago, only a glimpse of blond hair when he Flooed in. Not enough to satisfy his deeply seated desire to just look at his husband and hug the hell out of him. Their relationship is fairly sexual, but it’s those tender, chaste moments that make his life perfect.
They all turn their head as Harry appears with Draco by his side. Draco’s hair is a bit messier than before, but his flushed cheeks and rapidly heaving chest deflect from this small imperfection. It helps that standing up and walking clearly shows his raging hard-on. Some men and women smirk knowingly at them, but there are people reacting quite oppositely, turning in disgust and murmuring behind their backs.
And Draco is fulfilling his wish tonight.
“What did she give you just now?” he hears himself ask, even though he knows that Malfoy will lie to him.
Draco shakes his head, then nods, then shakes it again. There’s a strangled “Please!”, then incoherent mumbling, just like Harry expected.
“Mh, I have some ideas. What do you say we try your magic wand?”
It’s close to winter, almost too cold to visit Battersea Park again, but Draco’s Warming Charms are strong and they acquired more blankets over the years. He packs a basket with some morsels - the wine and chocolate from Tesco actually make an appearance - and off they go.
There are bad habits and there are Bad Habits. Bad habits aren’t so bad and more likely adorable. Like when Draco rakes his hands through his mane whenever he’s nervous, destroying his perfectly coiffed hair. Harry finds it hilarious and endearing, and that wrecked look sometimes gets him hot and bothered.
Harry’s enjoying the warm, wet feeling around his soft cock. He would love to spend the bigger part of his life with Draco’s mouth wrapped around him, but he doesn’t get to indulge in this very often. Below them, there seems to be some kind of finale going on. There are many people on the stage and most of them sing something or other, so it’s an educated guess that there’s going to be a break soon.
This time, it seems more important than ever since Harry is going to witness something special. They have never done this before and it took several years for Draco to allow it. Harry is nervous and he wants to pick just the right thing to wear, something that will speak of support and love and compassion. It’s stupid to want to express those things with clothes, but he is sure Draco would understand.
Her blue eyes twinkle with mischief as she tells him that someone is waiting for his consultation at examination room 4.
It’s the coldest day so far, but it stops snowing when they meet at the gates. Malfoy is wrapped tightly into his thick, black cloak, a Slytherin scarf draped around him, nearly covering his whole face. His grey eyes gleam brightly, the emerald green only highlighting them. Harry swallows, his throat suddenly dry, but then he remembers what happened in the dungeons and whatever he wants to say stays stuck in his throat.
“You can decide either way, my boy.” Dumbledore looks at him with the familiar knowing twinkle in his eyes. “Sometimes the painful way is the most rewarding, sometimes life rewards us with a simple ending. I can neither advise one or the other. I can only promise you, that no matter which way you choose, the end will always be the same.”
Malfoy sighs, deep and a bit desperate, and it tells Harry that these past months must’ve been quite stressful to him. He doesn’t know much about the Ministry of Magic or the works of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, since he can’t remember if he's even finished school, but that little bit of information sounds important and intricate. Mr. Weasley cursed the Unspeakables often enough that he knows the Department of Mysteries seldom gets involved - and when it does, things tend to be serious.
It’s their anniversary - the day of their first date, not the wedding - and he’s driving himself crazy for some time now. This year it’s his turn to plan something and he is at a loss what to do.
When they arrive in their box, they’re still breathless. Harry doesn’t give them time to take a breather, loses his suit jacket and pulls Draco down on his lap again, this time pushing the dress aside so he can touch without fabric in the way.
The snow is drenched in colours, but Harry just has eyes for the fading light. He knows it’s almost time, and he’s torn between waiting and just enjoying the quiet winter afternoon. It doesn’t take long for him to get giddy, his left leg bouncing with excitement and nervousness.
Draco nods in agreement. "I'm going to take a potion for my headache and lie down a bit. Alright?"
The hallway allows only one direction and Harry follows it, but he has the strange feeling that it’s too long and that he doesn’t get closer to anything. It feels like ten minutes already that he follows the blank walls, but he can’t really tell. There are no windows, but the light never changes, no matter how far he goes.
His sight was immediately caught by Draco Malfoy, huddled under a desk, crying. It was the most pathetic display he had ever seen and piqued his interest all the same.
It might not be Harry's own bed, but he isn't worried. It happens from time to time that he stumbles into a different one. He blushes fiercely, glad he's obviously alone. He doesn't want to imagine what Ron would have to say, finding him in a strange bed, beet red. His mate has developed quite the mouth on him ever since he and Hermione broke up. Too many differences, she had said, and Harry could believe that. After the War, many things are different.
Harry pants with exhaustion when Draco collapses on his chest. Draco purrs like a kitten, little puffs that not only warm Harry’s skin but also his heart. His husband is the equivalent of a pet cat, all contradiction, sharp angles, soft curves and soft fur. He can be ferocious, deadly, but it’s all hidden beneath his tame appearance.
They slowly walk the halls, and Harry notices with satisfaction that most people openly stare at them, some stopping what they’re doing to get a better look. He knows they’re a stunning couple, but it’s the mystery his husband’s shrouded in that makes them forget their manners. After a quick stop for some champagne, they arrive at their private box.
:: Qye smirked.
“I was only offering,” he quickly backpedaled, holding up a hand and giving the most apologetic look he could.  “I completely understand - ”
“Go to hell,” Sirius growled and Remus felt him tug at his elbow, dragging him towards Dumbledore.  “Come on, Moony.  Sooner we can see - ”
“He’s my Carus,” said that voice that once comforted him, that joked with him, that lied to him…
:: Qye’s voice came in, like a broken record, his voice urgent and frightened and worried. Harry clung to the familiar sound, felt it draw him back to the better part of the world where he was screaming.
:: he asked Qye hesitantly.  ::
Ron turned around and saw the group of a dozen vampires at the other end of Zabini’s spell.  A few held leashes to fresh beasts and he didn’t need to see the sadistic smiles on their faces to know more were coming.
:: Qye drawled.
Harry’s brow furrowed.  “Are…are you sure? I don’t think - ”
As Harry calmly buttered his piece of toast – courtesy of the ever-watchful Hermione – he shouted and pleaded with the highly amused boy to stop torturing him.
::  The voice paused and then said acidly, ::
Silence met the Mind-Healer’s assessment.
-----
Harry lay in bed, powerless in the storm of emotions Qye gave off.
:: Qye said quietly.  ::
He found he couldn’t have cared less.
Whipping his head back to Dumbledore, unmindful of how badly his body was shaking, words spilled from his lips in a breathless rush.
“Don’t doubt that,” Harry muttered as he hitched his schoolbag higher on his shoulder. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think she'd want to keep me locked in the Infirmary for the rest of my life.”
Harry blinked, drawn back from the memory.  ::
Harry said, shifting uncomfortably.
"I wonder how good that concentration is?" Lest mused aloud and Harry had just enough time to see a small frown on Ron's face before all the trinkets flew from Professor Opacre's desk.
“It wasn’t
- flinging a hand towards her and jerking as he saw her eyes widen shortly before she cried out and flew back, her body crashing into the other people, pushed out the doorway and onto their backs.
“Please,” Harry whispered, trembling beneath Ron’s hands.  “Please, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please don’t.”  Ron inhaled sharply as Harry abruptly fell to the floor, putting his face in his hands.  He went to one knee as Dean dashed out of the room, already calling out for Hermione.
:: Qye responded.  ::
he thought fuzzily and coughed. He blinked and slowly started lifting himself up. He winced as his left shoulder protested the movement and used his right hand to rub it as he knelt on the floor, his left hand supporting him.
“Everyone, stand away now.”
:: Harry thought back to the person, also irritated and pained, his eyes tightly shut and palms pressed up against them.  ::
He continued to stare into the green eyes but the flash didn’t come again.  ‘
“Now really,” Hermione suddenly interrupted.  The three boys turned to her and saw that she looking at them in annoyance.  She had given up her argument with Ron, who was now chomping on his dinner happily, glad she was going to go off on someone other than him.  There was an irritated and stern look in her eyes as she looked at them.
“OH, SWEET MERLIN!”
“You never asked!” Harry said exasperatedly, eyes flashing.  “All you did was tell me to say yes and then to meet you here and damn it, Malfoy, what exactly is - ”
He looked across the table at the two boys, wondering what they were thinking.  He knew the one calling himself Qye by the lack of glasses, observed as he sat rigidly, a glare fixed at the wall right above their heads.  His eyes shifted next to him, looking at the one he knew as Harry, quiet while he looked down at his knees, his hands gripping the couch cushions tightly.
Swallowing, he concentrated on the room before he lost his control.  Marylin was chattering on about something – he couldn’t focus enough to know what she was saying – and he swallowed again, desperately hoping she didn’t notice him being so uncontrolled.  As she paused for breath, he hastily murmured something about seeing how much progress there was.  At least, that’s what he hoped he managed to say.
“No reason for that, I’m fine,” Qye shrugged, shoving his hands in his pockets. “She just likes keeping me prisoner, that m - ” He stopped, took a deep breath to stop from saying miserable, old hag, and continued. “That mad woman.”
“You want to see them?” he hissed, his green eyes flashing with pain and fury.  “Go see someone die first.  Really, go Hermione, because that’s the only damn way to see them!  Yes, I’m really lucky to see them, so bloody lucky.  I’m lucky Cedric died right in front of my eyes so I could see them!  I should thank him for that, shouldn’t I?  Or maybe I should thank Voldemort for murdering him right in front of my eyes?”
“I think you’re well enough for some broth. Best make sure you don’t dehydrate.” The white shape walked away. “I’ll be back in a moment with it. Remember what I said about leaving, I won’t have another escape attempt on my watch, Potter.”
He followed his best friends, hands in his pockets, watching as Hermione took the lead and began lecturing the poor first years while Ron glowered at his twin brothers who were making jokes about him.  Just before he exited the Great Hall however, he turned around to take one last look at Professor Opacre.  She was standing up and talking quietly to the Headmaster, looking very serious about something.  He looked at her for a moment.
It was hard when he would momentarily forget what he knew, grinning at a story one of his friends told or laughing at an inside joke.  But then the feelings would come back hard and he struggled not to scream and let everyone know.
He stared at him, horrified and blushing even more.  Groaning, he covered his face with one of his hands.  ‘
“The recommendation,” Lest said softly.  “Fine.”  He turned away from them, putting his hands on a bookshelf.  “Just…just make sure they’re safe.”
“Calm down, help is coming,” someone whispered and Qye whimpered, prying his eyes open slightly, whimpering as the blows came faster against his mind, shaking his body with each hit. Another cry was wrenched from his throat as another blow hit him and the cool hand pressed harder against his back slightly, offering comfort, offering protection, offering…
They were silent again.
"I suggest you try something else," Lest said smoothly, voice silencing the whispers.
“That’s a first,” a dry voice said beneath the dark hood.  She grinned, moving closer and hugging her taller brother lightly.
Qye thought sarcastically, barely stopping himself from rolling his eyes. ‘
He was barely aware of the coverings of the other beds opening up as he tightened his grip behind Harry, trying desperately to stop him.  For all the fact that he was smaller and slighter than the redhead, Harry was fighting desperately, arms reaching without a seeming target.  Ron briefly saw glimpses of tear tracks on his pale cheeks.
::  Harry blinked as he suddenly felt a wave of suspicion from the person.  ::
Slowly, his hand slipped off.
------
Qye’s jaw tightened.
His fingers tightened in his hair and he gritted his teeth as he felt another wave of rage course over him.
“Stop!” he snapped.  He tried not to look directly at Lest, mindful of his burning stare and the fact that Qye still had not said anything.
There was so much fear in Qye’s voice at that.
Lest nodded, glancing around the Great Hall again and frowning when he still didn’t see the green-eyed teenager.  “I know.”
He felt her hands still momentarily in his hair, before resuming their gentle glide through the messy strands.
Qye continued quietly, more restrained.
is anymore! Damn it, Harry!” Ron cursed, dropping to the seat next to the bed and glaring at him. “We’re your friends, treat us as such and not like everyone else who doesn’t know who you really are.”
“I’ll be okay,” he replied, forcing another smile.  “Really.  Don’t worry about it.”  Hermione opened her mouth, obviously worrying and obviously intending on arguing with him.  Luckily for him, Ron intervened again with a cough that sounded too much like ‘
While waiting for Hagrid for Care of Magical Creatures, Draco had walked up to him and started talking to him about their Potions work.  It had taken him a few minutes into their conversation – which had shifted somehow into discussing upcoming Quidditch finals – to realize that there were several Slytherins around and, more significantly, Ron.
’ From the looks of it, Hermione thought the same.
“You know there’s nothing we can do when she comes anyway,” Remus reminded him gently, looking at his friend huddled next to his knees, trembling in fear and restraint.  “Smethwyck and Poppy both agreed that the evaluation has to occur with as minimal interference as possible.  Merlin, even Opacre’s healer agreed with them and you heard him yelling at her because of it.”
:: Harry said, his eyes closing.  He waited nervously, his chest tight with fear and anticipation.
Ron turned to tell the people at the door way off but their dorm mates were already there, loudly complaining about wanting to get changed and started for the day, would everyone please leave, they weren’t stripping, didn’t they all have studying to do.  Dean gave Ron a thumbs up behind his back.
It was the end of the first week of August and it was an ordinary day with ordinary weather.  Ordinary people went to work on the 7th of August, going on with their ordinary lives.  The ordinary people had bid good-bye to their relatives and gone to work.  They had gone, unsuspecting of what lay in store for them.  Those ordinary people were completely and totally unprepared for the Death Eaters waiting around every corner in Diagon Alley.  They were like lambs sent to slaughter and by the time the Aurors managed to bring everything under control, eighty-five were killed and a hundred were wounded.
Struggling to keep up his façade while inside, Qye lashed out waves of fury in his mind, fear and confusion rolling over him.
“So what happens now?”
Harry sighed.
“If you the two of you would like to continue your pissing contest about who cares more because they’re feeling guilty, you can take it outside!” she cried at them, curling her hands into fists.  “The rest of us are actually going to listen to the people who have been taking care of Qye and Harry all week and speak tomorrow, rationally and calmly.  If you two can take your heads out of your asses long enough, you can join us, otherwise spare us all the headache and be silent!”
Hermione had stopped walking the minute he had turned around and now she was looking at him, wide-eyed and pale.  Ron had also stopped, staring worriedly at him.
,’ he growled silently to himself. ‘
Professor Opacre gave him a long, considering look and then suddenly grinned, beaming with her bright eyes as she rapidly stood up.
‘Still, I better apologize for snapping at her like that,’ he thought as they entered the Entrance Hall with the other students, lowering the hoods.  ‘It wouldn’t be a good idea to get Hermione angry with me before the term has even begun.  Merlin knows I’m going to need all her help this year, with O.W.L.s and all.’  Since they were fifth-years now, at the end of the year they would have to take the Ordinary Wizarding Level exams and this year would no doubt be extremely difficult for him.
- only to stop as she was met with Ron and Hermione’s pale and frightened faces.
“I will if he does,” Malfoy said grudgingly, glancing over at the vampire woman.  Harry grinned slightly, squeezing the other’s hand gratefully before letting go and pulling back.
Marylin came as close as she ever did to a sneer.  “For how long?” she said, eyes flashing.  “In case you’ve forgotten, they outnumber us, ten wizards for every vampire.  And let us not forget their various ways of concealment, both in mind and body.  Oh, and the potions they brew and - ”
“Good for you,” came the muffled response from under the covers.  “Let me sleep.”
Hermione carefully sat down next to him as he looked at the passing crowd, everyone too caught up in the excitement of the event to notice the two students.
Ginny waved a careless hand as a few other Gryffindors let out small laughs.
“So is this it?” Hermione asked as they slowly made their way back to the Three Broomsticks.  “The reason you’ve kept to yourself all year?”
Marylin gestured to them, trying for a smile.  “But now that you are back - ”
“Harry?” Dean mumbled sleepily, blinking from where he lay in bed.  “Ron, what the hell is going on?”
“Is there a reason you’re sitting in my seat, brother dearest?” the female vampire asked serenely as she crossed the room over to her desk, dropping the bundle of papers gently onto the cherry wood. She more carefully placed the bag with the vials - potions? - in the middle of the desk, on top of a book. She then tilted her head calmly at the unruffled figure of her brother.
In the course of two months, Opacre had turned everyone’s feeling toward her in the opposite direction.  The cautious, distrustful feeling that had filled the air whenever she was around at first was now an accepting, amused – in a bemused sort of way – feeling.  All the students were now quite used to their joking, odd vampire professor.
There was a moment of silence, broken only by Harry’s quiet coughs. Then a soft sigh came from Qye and Harry’s eyes fluttered as he thought he felt a feather-like touch brush across his mind, gone before he could wonder whether it had really happened or not.
he thought distantly as he swung the cloak around his shoulders and slowly made his way to the door.
:: he murmured, slightly drowsy.  ::
“Stupid boy,” the vampire snarled, dropping his hand and leaving Harry gasping, wheezing as he moved back.  “They wanted you alive but you hardly need your mind for that.”
:: Harry muttered as he stirred and prepared to add the last ingredient.  Qye snickered.
:: he said quietly.  ::
Qye said in a far too innocent tone.
Their reluctance turned to surprise, then curiosity as they saw tethered horses near the edge of the forest.  There were about fifteen of them, different colors and breeds.  But it was clear what they were with their wings.
“If it helps, he also thought of kidnapping you,” Sirius offered.  Remus threw him an exasperated look.
“I agree with Harry,” Ron offered, shifting from his perch on the bedside drawer.
Draco tilted his head at him as he leaned carefully against one of the old fence posts.  “You willing to hear me this time?  You didn’t seem too open to it last time when I warned you about Opacre.”
“You were only meant to go to the library and back,” Snape said sharply and Remus blinked as Draco grimaced and looked away.  “I hope you haven’t made any unplanned detours.”  The Slytherin said nothing and Snape made a noise of disgust.
He heard Hermione yell and briefly saw her brandish her wand at another beast, stumbling back as it swiped at her, before the beast atop him snapped at his face, blocked by his forearm.
“Harry…” Dumbledore said gently but he continued to look at the ground, rubbing his stinging eyes and feeling numb.
Harry looked at Draco again.  Despite the wary look he was giving the twins, his hand never moved from resting lightly against the small of Harry’s back, warm and solid and pleasant.
He kneeled there, swaying and empty with his terrible feelings echoing back at him.
“Don’t worry,” he reassured, squeezing her hand as they stood to get back in.  “Let’s just enjoy tonight for now, okay?”
:: the voice said slowly.
“Are you alright, Potter?” Malfoy asked slowly, his gray eyes studying him.  “You haven’t been yourself lately…”
“To the left,” Dumbledore said quietly, walking after Sirius with Remus slowly trailing after.  The vampires said nothing as they left the entrance room, Dumbledore overtaking Sirius and leading them.
Jordan glanced nervously at Verna who was still knitting, wondering why she was allowed to be at ease and if she knew it was her turn to present herself.
Marylin patted the teenager on the shoulder.  “Unfortunately, Lest is quite taken.  Has been for some while.  And for most vampires, it is a very serious thing.”
She tried to follow his gaze but all she could see was a wave of all her students, some dancing more enthusiastically than others.  And then she saw a few of her older students slowly making their way over to her.  She tilted her head as she saw them focused on -
(*calmly sips tea and relaxes as everything begins to hit the fan*)
His words died in his mouth as he caught the scent of blood around her.
Qye looked up from the tray to the serene face of the Headmaster. ‘
“I remember,” Draco said.  Harry looked back at him but he saw no trace of anger or irritation in the gray eyes studying him.  “The point I’m trying to make is that I’m not the same person you hexed last year.”
“Lest,” Professor Opacre scolded and her brother tossed her an annoyed look. “Be nice.”
came to visit him when he was the Infirmary. Not that he was hurt – well, not much – just confused at their absence.
:: the person sighed in relief.  ::
She froze.  Her mouth closed.
"Something the matter, Harry?"
He waited but she didn’t say anything more.  Cautiously, he said, “I really can’t see your brother letting you do this.”
Qye said flatly before Harry could even begun to sputter a denial that he wasn’t…that he didn’t…
Before she could hurry her brother away, Lavendar Brown, Parvati and Padma Patil and Alicia Spinnet popped in front of them.
“Okay, really,” Harry said, turning back to Draco, “what did you do to him to make him agree to this?”
He gave her a rueful smile.  “Just realized people outside of Gryffindor are bound to ask questions today after last night and I doubt they’ll be as considerate to back off.  Think I’m just going to hide out until the worst of the gossip dies down.”
Harry asked.
Harry lifted his eyes and met Ron’s.  The redhead paused in his wand movements, seeing the exhausted and disconsolate look in his friend’s eyes.
Harry took a step back from the sink, staring down at his shaking hands.
Draco tilted his head slightly.  “I’ll tell you after you say yes.”
Harry said, mystified.
Qye saw the glint of humor in the werewolf’s eyes, tilted his head as he considered him.
She was looking at them from the corner of her eye as her other hand kept flicking armor at the students and the Muggle Studies teacher desperately tried to keep up.  Professor Sinistra lay unconscious as Hermione crouched over her, whispering something fervently as she helped deflect what the remaining teacher couldn’t.  He heard Professor Sprout shouting spells, saw the other adults darting to cover the other corridors, heard hisses of what could only be more beasts.
“Now, that’s not nice,” he whined even though his blue eyes danced with laughter.  “I was just inquiring over a friend’s well-being.  Is that a crime nowadays?”
and Lest didn’t need to feel the sudden tension of fear and anger as a new group of people appeared next to the Dazains to know exactly who they were.
Voldemort laughed, high pitched and cold.  “Death is hardly enough for the boy, don’t you think?  Clearly it does not agree with him after so many attempts.”  He turned to Harry and Marylin caught a glimpse of fear and anger in Harry’s eyes as the vampire pushed him closer.
“So will I,” Remus added.  He hesitated.  “Do…do they know we will be there?”
“We’re not children,” Reya, the young girl – except she had to be older, he saw that in her face now despite being no taller than a first year – said as the vampires slowly spread themselves out.  Ron could see others behind them, one bouncing something in her hand, another so large he could almost reach Hagrid.
:: Harry replied, startled.  ::
“Lest?” she called out again, gingerly making her way to the nearest lamp.  As she turned it on, she nearly jumped as she saw her brother sprawled in one of the armchairs near a window, his legs crossed carelessly at the ankle while his hands were folded across his stomach.
Thankful for the distraction, Harry grinned at them as they rounded the corner to the hall of the classroom.
Lest whirled around and met Alexis Dazain’s distant, inquisitive eyes.
“Harry, move, can’t you see Ron’s been enchanted?!” she shouted.  Ron leaned back as she turned to him, grasping his arm.  “Don’t worry, Ron, I’ve read all sorts of countercurses and Madam Pomfrey will surely - ”
It was past midnight, all the other boys were sleeping and snoring in their beds and Harry was awake in bed as his mind still reeled in shock over the events earlier in the day.
:: the voice replied irritably.  ::
Before Harry could question that noncommittal response, Lest's voice brought him back to the duel and his green eyes flashed back to the vampire, hand tight on his wand. The duel was over the minute he lost his wand so he couldn't afford to slip on it.
“You keep forgetting you’re only human, Harry,” Hermione’s muffled voice came from his shoulder, sounding slightly sad. “You forget that you can get as sick as anybody else, that you’re young like all of us and you’re not invincible, not from anything.” Her voice trembled, the sadness deepening. “Everyone forgets.” She pulled back and gave another shimmering-eyed glare. “That’s why you have us, Harry, Ron and me! You’re suppose to come to us when you can’t handle it, that’s what friends do. Why won’t you let us help you?”
“Draco Malfoy,” she called out without thinking, her mind musing on this new development.  A moment later, she inwardly groaned.
Jerking, both of them moved away from each other, Malfoy releasing his hold on Harry.  The green-eyed boy blushed furiously, placing his hand in his lap, his eyes fixed firmly on the tabletop while his heart hammered in his chest.
Madam Pomfrey turned off the spell and looked wide eyed at the uncertain vampire while Marylin’s heartbeat slowed from its panic.  Then she sighed and turned to look at the sharp gazes of the wizards.
Pre AN: Bloody hell, Lest...that's all I got to say. But then again, I’ve been saying that for years.  --; Harry and Qye, finally, find out the truth (at least, some of it).
, Mr. Nott,” she said, a bit sharply, narrowing her eyes slightly.  “Unlike the other type of vampire, the
Sirius frowned, thinking back.  “Just if you seemed happy at the Dursleys - ”  He shifted awkwardly.  “It’s the same thing I said to you, Harry, when we first met, remember?  When I asked if you wanted to live with me - ”
“After I fainted?”
Harry whirled around, his hand immediately reaching for his wand as Qye stopped, surprised.
From his parched dry throat a series of painful coughs emerged and the sounds ceased. A soft whimper echoed wherever he was and he realized with muzzled confusion that it came from him. He tried to stop but couldn’t, coughing and whimpering and the boiling water poured from his skin.
“Well, everyone got that idea the second time you collapsed,” Ron said, grabbing the bag and poking around in its contents.
"We haven't reached this part of vampire culture yet," she said absently, pushing back a sleeve of her robe. "It's discussed later in your texts despite the fact that this is a keystone aspect of our society." As her sleeve was firmly tucked up, a small silver bracelet on her wrist was revealed from which a small stone hung suspended on a delicate chain. "At the beginning I was unsure as whether or not I should present this but giving that it
“I thought wizards and vampires agreed not to fight each other?” Harry said, brows furrowing.
His head jerked up in time to see something horribly familiar bounding towards him, his eyes widening as he recognized it from a vision not so long ago, the twisted face and bloody mouth.
:: it said grudgingly.  ::
The redhead raced through the corridors to Gryffindor Tower, pulling an indignant Hermione along, barely pausing to gasp out the password, rushing through the common room and up to the Fifth Year boy’s dormitory.
Footsteps came closer and he felt a presence behind him as he dropped his hand to the floor.
“They talked about sticking you in the Janus Thickley ward,” Remus shared nonchalantly and Qye watched as everyone, even Smethwyck and Dumbledore, gave the man a surprised look.  “We decided that was a bad idea.”
Harry said, staring at the potion.   He glanced at the feather in his hand and slowly unclenched his hand.
Qye muttered as Harry slipped back to Gryffindor Tower.
“I made the choice to leave him,” his voice stated coldly.  “I sealed his memories to protect him and I will not apologize to you or anyone else for it.”
He flinched when Weasley clapped him on the shoulder, still a sympathetic look in his blue eyes. “Seems like your freedom is going fast, huh?”
:: he sighed.  ::
:: the voice murmured to itself.  In a slightly louder voice, the person answered.
He felt the control slip back into his hand and slowly flexed his fingers around the doorknob.
A groan reverberated in Draco’s chest, thrumming against him and his fingers tightened again, his breath gasping as his skin burned.
:: Qye said irritably.  ::
keep your little…feud…to yourselves and not spread it around.  I’m trying to find an alliance between vampires and wizards and that isn’t going to happen if you two fight every time you meet each other’s eyes.  So,” she took a deep breath, “I’m
And then the blow came and Qye took one last, long look at Lest as his world faded.
Professor Opacre must have noticed it and sighed, nodding. "Yes, well, I suppose you'll just have to take that on faith. Either way, you should expect something along those lines if you fight a vampire. They'll take any advantage they can get, especially forewarning of attacks. That's why it's best to not think or plan far ahead when dueling." She spread her hands apologetically. "I know it'll be hard so you should probably start training to not think as you send out your spells. Another reason my brother reacted so quickly to Hermione throwing that inkpot is that she must have thought about it before she did it, so he knew what she was going to do. Added to his Videte so that he knew where the inkpot was coming from, he didn't have to move much to avoid the attack.
It was right when he was passing Seamus that his vision blurred and before he knew it, he suddenly hooked his leg around the leg of the Irish boy's chair and yanked, dropping Seamus on the floor. The fuzziness faded and Harry came back to himself to find everyone staring at him.
Hermione's shock was evident to Harry even from the back of the room and he heard a few disturbed murmurs pass through the rest of the crowd, a few of them shifting uncomfortably, some even mumbling to themselves to not use that spell. Harry didn't move his eyes from the duel where Lest was just staring amusedly at an unsettled Hermione, neither of them moving. That prickle of concern welled up in him again and he wondered for a moment if this duel was really as even as he had thought.
Through him, Qye stared at the underlying icy bitterness.
He began to fervently hope Harry and Dumbledore weren’t
Heads whipped around and Harry and Hermione stared wide-eyed, slack-jawed as Ron sighed and raised his hand. Professor Opacre lit up and clapped her hands.
“The hell he is,” Sirius said heatedly and Qye faltered, biting the inside of his cheek as he side-eyed the man as he glared at Lest.  “If you think for one goddamn minute I’m letting you have any say in - ”
“Remember what happened the last time you said you were fine?” Qye had muttered and Harry had cracked his eyes open just enough to glower at him.
The blonde woman sighed and stood up from her chair, smoothing out her aquamarine skirts. “We best go before my brother gets any more ideas.” She smiled and leaned over, smoothing out Harry’s hair gently. “I hope you get better, Harry. I’d like for you to be in class on Monday.”
“Go,” Snape repeated and started down the path Draco had taken earlier.  “Better for you both to get this over with.”
“They’re on a date,” Ron said bluntly.  “For whatever reason Harry’s gone mental and giving the git a chance.  And I’m asking Hermione to dance because I’ve done my task as best friend but even I have limits.  Bugger off now.”  He turned to Hermione, whose cheeks were turning pink.  “Want to dance and get away from these idiots?”
His words echoed in the quiet classroom and he saw Lest narrow his eyes, pale face slightly pink from where his fist had made contact.
“So!”
“Well…” she said, blinking. “I suppose, if that’s what you want to do…but I thought you were positive about him being here?”
Harry rolled his eyes, pushing back from the wall and reaching into the pocket of the pants.  They were tight and he had barely been able to fit the scrap of parchment, let alone his wand.
She sighed and resumed straightening up her desk.  ‘
"Ah, don't listen to her, Harry," Ron grinned as they approached the classroom.  "Enjoy yourself, relax and take a load off.  It's the holidays for heaven's sake!  And the O.W.L.s are so far off, we'll have plenty of time to study later."
He was even more surprised when Malfoy placed a cool pale hand against his forehead.
His voice cut off and Qye opened his eyes to see Harry lifting the pillow from his face, looking confused.
Qye said softly.
:: Qye murmured as Harry rubbed his eyes gently. ::
Both he and Harry jumped when she suddenly whipped her wand out at Malfoy, voice going higher as she said shrilly, “Malfoy, what did you
“Madame Pomfrey tells me you’re doing the same as me,” Dumbledore continued as Qye looked grouchily at the nurse’s back.
And now he had to deal with this git. Well, at least he could vent some of his irritation...
The figure in black laughed quietly and lazily walked closer to them.  Petunia’s hysterical sobs began to grow higher in pitch and the man turned to look in annoyance in her.  In an instant, her screams were cut off and her eyes bulged.  Choking sounds began to issue from her.
“Where’s Malfoy?” he murmured, unthinkingly, aloud.  The other Slytherins were there but the blond was obviously missing from their group.
“What - ” he heard Sirius start to say and Qye clenched his jaw as Harry looked at him from the corner his eye, his gaze seeing through Qye’s discomfort.
Harry said disbelieving.
“I’ll be having words with him too,” Marylin sighed, falling back into the armchair and closing her eyes.  “Can you at least try to ignore him?”  Lest made a noncommittal sound and she sighed again.  “I suppose that’s the best I can get.  But, ignoring him, what do you think?”
He let out a moan of relief when a blessed coolness washed over him.
He felt Qye behind his eyes and in the pit of his stomach that uneasy feeling he’d been ignoring started to grow heavier as he suddenly remembered the potion that started it all.
“Ms. Nilsson, please,” the Healer protested and Lest saw him standing in front of a black-haired teenager sitting in a chair between the beds.  Smethwyck had his hands raised and Lest vaguely noted a flash of frustration cross the man’s face as Lest walked further into the room, right behind Nilsson who was reaching out a hand to start scanning, the confused frown on her face deepening.  “Wait, please, just give us a moment - ”
His eyes widened as his body froze.
Lest bared his teeth.
They were seated at breakfast and Ron and Hermione had just finished handing out the time-tables to all the Gryffindors.  Now they were looking at their own and Harry was silently agreeing with the fuming Ron.
“Very well, then,” she said briskly. “I shall inform the Headmaster and your Head of House of this just in case it happens again.” Harry mentally sighed. “On Monday, you’ll return to classes but until then, stay in this bed and don’t become too excited.” At this, she threw a sheepish Ron and Hermione a warning look. Nodding once again, she turned and left the room.
“Hermione, I really think we should get back, I don’t think it’s such a good idea – where are we going?” he asked as he suddenly found himself standing outside of the Three Broomsticks.
-------
“Present,” the young Malfoy heir said contemptuously, his gray eyes flashing darkly.  Marylin took in a deep breath and exhaled slowly.  She shot the pale boy a look that clearly told him to not push his limits but he just sneered.   Marylin sighed again and shook her head, thinking, ‘
“You’re not joking?” Harry whispered into the silent room.
Harry blushed slightly but didn’t move. “I’ll go after dinner,” he replied quietly, dropping his eyes. “I promised 'Mione I would anyway.” He raised his eyes again and tried for a small, reassuring smile. “It’s not as bad as it looks, really.”
Harry stared back.  And slowly cursed as he felt a flush slowly creep up his cheeks as a knowing smile came upon her face.
Harry gave him the coldest look he could, aware of Ron and Hermione trailing behind him.
Harry grinned as they got back to Draco and Ron, who had thankfully managed to keep their glares to themselves.  Ron pointedly turned away from the blond and started talking with Hermione, who was subtly flicking her wand at him under the table as she sat next to him, smiling at the redhead when he absently shifted to give her more space.  Draco turned to Harry and he felt a slow coil of warmth at the answering smirk.
She thought back to Harry.  She had been relieved to see that he was all right now.  And that surprised her.  She had thought she had only taken a great liking to Harry because he kind of reminded her of Qye, because he might be Qye.  It had made her feel terrible because she didn’t want to like him just because of that.
Ron rolled his eyes and tugged fruitlessly at the red blankets once again.  “If I have to get up this early, then so do you, mate,” he growled, struggling to pull the covers from his friend’s bed.  For such a small boy, Harry sure had a lot of strength.
There was suddenly a great stillness and he paused, turning to look as a low green light streamed through the high windows of the Great Hall.
“He warned us about it on Friday,” Hermione sniffed, pouring herself some more pumpkin juice.  “It’s your own fault that you chose to play chess and waste your time on Saturday instead of studying.”  Ron shifted his glare to her and the brunette glared back.  For a whole minute, the two silently met each other’s eyes, sparks flying.
He opened his eyes, vision blurry, and staggered up, bracing himself against the nearest wall.
Qye said roughly.
“Almost done, Harry,” Hermione said absently as she raised her hand towards one of the several attendants dashing behind the bar, filling orders as quickly as possible.  One of them seemed to have seen her because Harry suddenly found himself once again being dragged by Hermione, this time to the other side of the room and still not any closer back to the table.
“I can multi-task,” Qye shrugged, dropping into one of the free chairs facing the group, staring flatly back at the adults while Harry sat next to him, shaking his head.
Qye’s eyebrow twitched. “Oh.”
Then he was being dragged, the shock of seeing Voldemort standing with Death Eaters on the grounds of Hogwarts, seeing vampires standing there as well, seeing Dumbledore and Professor Opacre and Lest and –
“You,” he heard Professor Sprout cough from where she stood next to Neville, who had returned to assist her despite his shaken look.  “You’re the ones Professor Opacre - ”
Harry woke up aching the next morning, partly from having fallen asleep next to a snoring Ron and dozing Hermione and partly from Qye’s longing and loneliness.
Unfortunately, Hermione thought that his light moods weren’t light enough.  Ron obviously thought so too, judging from his eyebrow raise when he saw him again, but he was good enough to not say anything.  Hermione wasn’t as nice and had been pursuing him from the moment they stepped onto the Hogwarts Express, probing over how he was feeling and whether or not he wanted to talk.  Ron had tried to make her stop but had quickly given up when she gave him one of her looks.  Harry had put up with it for the entire train ride and most of the carriage ride but now it was beginning to get irritating.
On the beds continued to sleep the two black-haired young men, breathing deep and steady.
Harry knew his eyes weren't the only ones to shoot over to Professor Opacre's calm face at the last part of her instructions. She merely looked back at them impassively and Harry tore his eyes away, a bit of concern welling up at him as he looked at Hermione gazing at Lest with a determined look in her eyes, wand held lightly but ready.
From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the vampires again before looking back down at the table.  “The people I’ve talked to have kept up their part, stood down and looked the other way.  Took a couple of mentions about Fred and George’s merchandise but most of them seem to agree with ignoring you snakes so long as you ignore us.”  He shrugged.  “I think most of them are more worried about avoiding Hermione’s rampage as O.W.L.s get closer.”
“I hate you so much,” Ron said conversationally to Draco, his arm draped over the back of Hermione’s seat.  “I should be granted an Order of Merlin for how much I completely and utterly hate you and am not doing anything.”
The vampire woman folded her arms and looked evenly at him.  “Hair and one bracelet,” she said after a minute of staring.
“Lest?” she said uncertainly, confused.  “I don’t understand…”
Qye said dully.
Harry had stilled and he could feel the concern flowing from the other boy.  But all he could see was that one word under the subsection ‘Memories’.
“Don’t think I won’t feed you a Canary Cream if I think you’re dodging us,” Ron warned, frowning as he shifted his school bag.
“I’m letting you go since there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with you,” Madam Pomfrey said, not noticing his silence.  “But if you feel any different, I want you to come straight to me.  And I want you to have lots of chocolate.  I think you have enough,” she said, motioning to the small pile at the end of his bed that he hadn’t noticed before.
:: Harry said hesitantly.  ::
-----
“I think that’s enough, Severus,” Remus sharply said, blocking Sirius from taking another step towards Snape as his fists tightened.  Sirius scoffed but didn’t make any further attempts.  “We’re naturally exhausted from our trip and we want to know what is going on.  The Headmaster specifically had us remain far from Hogwarts and undercover and now he summons us here without any explanation - ”
Qye shrugged.
“A wise move, Libby,” Dumbledore said serenely before anyone could begin to protest, rising from his own seat.  “I assume the original copy is secured?”
“ – bloody hell?” Ron heard Seamus finish weakly as the redhead blinked in confusion.
“Better than the entire month,” Qye muttered, not noticing the sudden frowns on their faces as he looked away from them, Sirius stiffening at the implications of those words.  Before he could ask, Qye shook his head and turned his glare on Remus again.  “You still could have kept in touch.”
She smiled suddenly, face blooming with a smile of light. Against the somber atmosphere she had created before, it was strange and startling and seemed only more fully emphasized with warmth and kindness.
Qye cried out and Harry’s vision blurred as the hand tightened, his hands clenching and clawing while the feeling in his legs grew distant and he became aware of them trying to kick the vampire off.
was right there.  The Libidates surged up and he fought it off, his dark eyes staring down at the boy – no, he wasn’t the small boy he had left behind – the
“I wonder if the smell of Quirrell’s garlic is still around,” Seamus muttered as they took their seats in their last class of their day.  The Irish was sniffing the air hopefully and Dean rolled his eyes as he sat down next to his best friend.  Harry, however, noticed that Dean also sniffed the air when he thought no one was looking.
Pale, shocked Gryffindor faces met his, disbelief clear in their wide eyes.  Seamus eyes were filled with hurt and looked away from his own when Harry turned to look at him.  Dean glared at the black-haired boy as he placed a comforting hand on the sandy-haired boy’s shoulder.  Harry turned to Ron and Hermione and found them staring at him as if they had never seen him before.  Realization of what he had just done hit him and he felt himself pale.
Harry said softly as they approached the room.
’ before she caught up with them.  He shot her an apologetic look but all she did was sniff and walk farther ahead of them.  He sighed and made a mental note to apologize more profusely later on before she really got huffy.
One night, after the rest of his dorm mates passed out before him, Harry took the opportunity to flip haphazardly through the pages of Qye’s journal.
Qye’s breath caught as he heard the change in pronoun before he pulled back into his anger.  “You’ve never had any say in this, Lest,” he said bitterly, looking away and sitting back down.  “Why don’t you fuck off like you did before?”
The sitting one made no move to turn to look at him.
“One week until the exams are over,” Lord Voldemort continued, apparently unconcerned with the tension between the groups.  “One week until the older students are drained, the professors distracted by the exams for the other years.  None of them are wondering and no one will be on guard, as you suggested.”
Seamus stared wide-eyed up at him.
Then he barely bit back a yelp as the memories came back to him.
“He’ll be back,” Hermione sighed as Ron slowly chewed his food, blue eyes wandering through the room, towards the entrance where the students straggled through and the staff table where the teachers kept their heads up.  “Not much time to get into any serious trouble.”
“I had a cousin who died as a result of him,” Draco said lowly, his gaze far-off and dark.  “He had participated more in the Muggle world, thought there were some things the wizarding community could use from them.  My mother made sure never to speak of him while my father was around.  I think I’ve only met him a few times in my life and never at the manor, never where my father could see him.”  He was quiet for a moment.  “I remember him always trying to make me laugh with these terrible jokes and he would grin when I called them stupid.  He never took offense.  Those few times I saw him with family, he always wanted to make sure everyone was comfortable.  He could get into a conversation with anyone.  Despite thinking he was a fool for wanting to spend time with Muggles, I liked him.
::  There was a moment of silence, this time from the voice’s end, and Harry felt a slight flash of confusion from the other before it quickly vanished.  ::
“Oh, I’m hurt, Potter,” Malfoy drawled out and he looked up, startled.  He blinked in confusion and the blond smirked.  “Does that mean you don’t love me anymore?”
He hesitated too long.
“If this is how you’re planning to support, Black, I really don’t see any so-called progress to be made,” came Lest’s chilly voice and Qye closed his eyes, familiar anger seeping back into him.
He froze as Lest stepped forward and kissed him.
“Now,” she said, her voice lower but no less firm, “I’m going to send the letter and - ”
“Yeah…” he said slowly, remembering Harvey.  “Is that what you call them?” Jordan asked in surprise.  Leon nodded and Jordan furrowed his eyebrow.  Leaning closer, he whispered, “Why is cousin Marylin upset?”
Jordan’s eyebrows went up at the straying of protocol and he nervously looked at his cousin.  He blinked in surprise at the lack of emotion on his cousin’s pale face and mentally sighed.  ‘
(See the end of the chapter for
:: Harry replied, wondering the same thing though he too felt a bit uneasy about the new vampire.
“A midget in glasses,” Weasley grinned, mirth replacing the strange look in his eyes. Qye couldn’t help but scowl at the other boy but fortunately, the idiot seemed to think it was mock-scowl and not real. “Sorry about that, it’s just…” Weasley stopped and shook his head, grinning again. “Never mind, it’s probably nothing.”
"What?" he asked, blinking, laying down his fork.  Hermione rolled her eyes and let out a long, suffering sigh.
“Yes, more potions,” Smethwyck said dryly.  “That
Sirius tensed once more.  “Qye,” he began, half-dreading to ask.
There was silence as he continued to stand there, his face burning and his eyes downcast as he continued to hold onto the other boy’s hand.  He wanted to move very much but the fear of what might happen if he let Draco go – and what might happen to him – kept him in place.  ::
,’ she thought, feeling uneasiness well up in her, ‘
Harry shrugged as he put on his pads.  “I don’t know,” he said softly as he tied his boots.
“Ron, Harry, be serious,” Hermione scolded as the two snickered for completely different reasons. Her brown eyes scowled at them and she placed her hands on her hips as she walked, apparently trying to tower over the two taller boys. “This isn’t a laughing matter at all, Harry could be suffering from sort of wizarding disease or maybe he’s trying to stretch himself out beyond his means.”
Dark green eyes opened.
Harry waited another moment, hesitantly testing his mind.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  '
“Haven’t you noticed it?  I assumed since you’ve been here six months, you would see it.”  Lest shrugged at her confusion.  “Everyone pays attention to him, Marylin.  When I walked over to him, I noticed that everyone was watching me carefully, the Gryffindors in particular.  They weren’t  paying attention to me and Malfoy when we had the fight.  It was Harry they were looking at, all of them.  If the class is anything to go by…” The vampire frowned.  “He’s someone important here.”
“The Ministry would just like to know if you wish to go home and retrieve whatever you might have left there,” Dumbledore said quietly, his brightless blue eyes looking down at him.  Harry faintly pondered why he looked so sad and pained.
?” she said, a slight tone of disrespect in the title.  “What are you going to say to the old man?  Hand us over to be slaves?  Have you our collars ready?  Are you eager to be like the Dazains, following a wizard like a
“I’m fine,” he assured her, trying to keep the grin on his face. “Just need to have a spot of tea and eat something, that’s all.” His stomach rebelled at the thought. “Besides,” he continued hastily to cover up his queasiness, “you don’t want me to fall behind in class, do you? With O.W.L.s coming up and all…”
“I just want to live my life,” Qye said, nails digging into the palms of his hands.  “Like anyone else.  Go through the motions of a day, choose what I want to do, talk to the people I want to and experience what everyone else gets to.  Why is that so much to ask?”
Whatever she said, Lest sat in his chair once more, hunched over with his head in hand while his other shook and flexed.
“Leave, Tom,” Dumbledore said calmly, steel beneath his careful words.  “There is no win here.”  Behind him, Lest could hear the rumbling of the castle’s protections.  He sent a probe to his sister and she swiftly answered, hiding as much as she could in case Dazain caught on.
Hermione cleared her throat and drew herself up when the attention shifted to her. “As amusing as that was,” she icily replied, ignoring the smirks of the other House, “we all have a class to attend.” Looking at all of them equally, she frowned slightly. “And just to say something…this is getting really childish.” Sniffing, she turned and calmly walked up the stairs to the corridor of the DADA classroom.
Qye frowned.
“R-really?” he asked in what he hoped was a calm and curious voice. “Well…um…guess I’m a fast healer, huh?” He gave her a weak grin.
“I want to be myself,” he answered simply.
was all Harry sighed.
“They come here with good intentions, they say, but I see them talking with Dumbledore, studying us, learning about us.  Centuries of separation and it is no coincidence that they’ve come to us as soon as the Dazains ally with the Dark Lord,” Draco growled.  “The students see Professor Opacre teaching and I see her training us for a war.”
“But still…” Hermione continued, still frowning disapprovingly.
Draco snorted.  “Clearly you weren’t listening to the same overprotective message I was.”  He shook his head.  “I almost feel a little sorry for the littlest redhead if that was any indication of how they treat people who - ” He stopped and cleared his throat.
And just like that, understanding struck him and he couldn't stop the slow smile that spread on his face.
There was a popping sound.
Harry blushed slightly.  “Ah, I’m fine,” he said quietly, ducking down his head in embarrassment.  “Thanks.”  She smiled, looking relieved, and patted his head.
Qye, the writer of the journal he had been reading for the past month.
In an instant, everything switched around.  His mind rushed out, stretching and stretching and stretching and something was fragmenting, tiny little cracks were somewhere, growing bigger and bigger.  He tried to focus, to cling to something stable but his mind was stretching, being pulled in a million directions.
:: Harry asked sarcastically, finding his glasses and putting them on. He swallowed thickly as the room spun and wobbled shakily.
,’ he thought, lowering his eyes to his plate, ‘
“Poppy, what - ” Smethwyck began as the adults stared at them and Qye glared at them, trying not to give in to the rage still boiling under his skin as he kept his eyes away from the vampires.
’ he wondered as he stirred his potion, absently keeping count while he curiously looked towards the door.  Qye raised his attention from reading.
There was a blur and suddenly the vampire collided roughly with a wall, knocked unconscious.
“Too much…best go…no visitors, yes?”
“Don’t put yourself out on my account,” Draco responded coldly.
The screams continued on.
:: Qye said innocently and Harry felt his face flush slightly as he dropped his quill.  Making sure that Malfoy was still reading his essay, he turned inward to the other boy.
A flush graced Harry’s cheeks and he shook his head rapidly.  “No, no,” he said quickly, blushing further under the vampire’s amused gaze.  “I…I d-didn’t mean to call you that old – I mean any old!  I just called you sir because…well…you’re young but you’re not that young.”  A horrified look came into his eyes.  “I mean…um…sir….ah! Wait, sorry sir – gah!  I mean - ”
Lest turned to her, the detached expression on his face.  “How important he is.”
Draco had shifted his gaze and stared with hard eyes but the redhead never looked back at them, instead digging through his bag for his textbook.
Harry removed the paddle from his cauldron and added the thyme leaves quickly.  He glanced at the doorway to see Professor Opacre walk in with a hooded figure behind her.  The figure was obviously Professor Opacre’s brother, which meant he was…
Harry wasn't going to say anything but his lips moved. "Just thinking about how far you're going to fall from your perch when I beat you."
Taking another breath, he lifted his eyes calmly to meet the wide-eyed, confused looks of the other three. Lest had his head turned away, his eyes focused on the lake. Qye couldn’t help but glance at him before turning his attention back to the others.
“Does being born count?” Dean asked sarcastically, pouring himself more pumpkin juice.  Seamus pouted and sniffled.
“Me agreeing to bond with you never meant becoming your damn property to do with as you wish, Lest!” Qye shouted, heaving, hating the way his eyes burned as he fought to maintain his glare, poured his rage right at Lest.  “To do what you say and what you want and how you want me to live!  And if you fucking think it did then you might as well kill me now because I’d rather be dead than live a life like that with you!”
The vampire glanced down and snorted.  “Water?  Let me guess, you think by making this holy water - ”
Lest narrowed his eyes. “Brat,” he muttered as he turned around and resumed their way to the Great Hall.
Libby leaned back in her chair, examining the array of results, observations and recommendations in front of her.  She had made it a point in her career to write all possible recommendations for her evaluations, looking at the risks and benefits in each one as she discarded one after another.
Harry said distractedly as he took control again, stumbled forward and crouched, shifting through his pockets to look for his wand.
Before words could be exchanged, a light rap was heard at the doorway.
,’ Harry thought a bit bitterly, looking down at the newspaper.  ‘
:: he thought to the other boy as he watched Snape snarl out their homework and dismiss the class.  The younger boy still wasn’t saying anything, the only indication of him being there his feelings, which were steadily growing darker.  He bit the inside of his cheek as he plugged up the now filled vial.  ::
“Pater,” a careful voice spoke and Qye narrowed his eyes as he watched Lest twitch, his own nails digging into the wooden bedpost.  “I will step outside.  I trust Healer Smethwyck will reach out when he needs to.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut and clutched his head again.
He swallowed.
he thought, slightly mystified.  ‘
When he didn’t say anything else, he felt another shift and heard Remus say, still in that level voice, “I still don’t understand how this is possible.  Headmaster, weren’t there precautions taken when Harry was placed with his family?”
Professor Opacre stopped Hermione and Ron on their way to Herbology, looking oddly strained and troubled.  Hermione barely managed to say that Harry was just catching up on some sorely needed sleep before Ron tugged her away, lips thin and body tense.
…Lest.
There was a sickening feeling as he saw the unconscious form of Asger, mind automatically scanning for telepathic assaults and finding nothing but an almost stirring consciousness that told him Asger would wake by himself soon.
“What’s happened?” Remus asked worriedly, standing up and rolling up their maps without another word.  It had taken them a while but this past year spent as reconnaissance for Dumbledore had gradually brought them back to their former confidence and he did not question why, merely started flicking his wand to eliminate traces of their presence.
:: the person replied sarcastically.  ::
“And Marylin is going to take the job,” Krista said, half-stating, half-questioning.  The Pater Nosferatu nodded and Krista looked confused.  “How’s this going to help?”
A fire quickly burned away the numbness and she bared her teeth at him and stood back up.   “Don’t you fucking dare Lest, don’t you dare put this on me!”
Voldemort stepped closer to Dazain, bringing out his own wand.  “I would say the odds are better now.”
Ron dimly heard Seamus yell, followed by Dean.
They didn’t look too convinced.
,’ she thought, staring blankly at her empty chambers.  ‘
“Normal,” Qye said bitterly.  “Do you know what normal is?”
“Harry, Pomfrey’s right,” the brunette said worriedly. “What happens if your fever comes back and it’s worse? You should at least spend one more day there, just to make you’re really okay.”
He swallowed and instead of crossing his arms over himself like he wanted, he hooked his thumb in one of the loops of the jeans and raised an eyebrow at Draco.
Qye’s plan sounded reasonable.  He could learn more about the other boy and if they didn’t find a solution, at least he would have some proof to back up having Qye in his head.  Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair.
Harry coughed.
There was an odd silence following his statement, Qye staring at the floor, bouncing between irritation and something he hadn’t felt for a long time.
Darkness surrounded him.
Ron raised an eyebrow. “I think we’ve established that it happened the second time you fainted.”
He closed his eyes again.  ‘
Qye scoffed and looked away from her, turning his glare onto Smethwyck quietly standing behind the couch.  The Healer raised a questioning eyebrow at him.  “Are you involved in this evaluation too?  I thought you said you were trying to limit interference and you’ve been with us all week.  Isn’t that going to influence your
As Lest stumbled off, Professor Opacre cheerfully plopped down and turned twinkling eyes onto the fury encompassed ones of her brother.
On the other side of the classroom, he heard sounds of relief from his classmates and he opened his eyes, beginning to straighten up.
“I will send the letter to the Minister now,” Dumbledore said as Harry carefully turned around with Qye’s help, their backs to the adults.  “I would suggest everyone else retire to their rooms until Healer Smethwyck provides us any further updates.”  His tone clearly said it wasn’t so much a suggestion as an order and Qye could hear faint shuffles as a door opened behind them.
Harry began, chest tight and heavy.
“Right.” He stopped himself from sneering.
He had drifted in and out of consciousness a lot yesterday. Not so much as to worry, he could’ve attended classes if he wished – he had tried to argue this with Pomfrey but all she did was give him a flat look and dose him with more vile-tasting concoctions – but it was probably best all around that he had stayed in bed. Not that anyone would hear him say that. Today had been much better, only falling asleep twice and only after downing his medicine.
“Lest,” Myn whispered softly, placing a hand on her brother’s arm, her eyes slightly puzzled. Lest ignored it and continued to glower down at the innocent-looking boy.
Shouting, Harry Potter fell out of his warm bed and landed with a thud on the floor.
Harry frowned.
“Mind you manners, Draco,” she said, grinning while her light blue eyes danced.  “I can have you for PDA – public displays of adorableness.”
,’ Albus thought, as he took in a deep breath.
Harry’s stomach dropped.
The sickness rolled Harry’s stomach again and he swallowed heavily, leaning forward and breathing fast and deep.
His irritation fled as Lest opened his eyes and looked at him.
Harry sighed, relieved at not having to think so much.  “Thanks,” he said gratefully, reaching for the parchments.  He blinked as Malfoy laid a pale hand on top of his own, raising his eyes in confusion to the other’s while heat crept up on his face.
She bit her lip and continued their walk to Hogsmeade, where the dance awaited them.
to the left, Qye shouting
He lifted his head and glanced to the left to find Malfoy looking at him with a sharp gaze.  Scowling slightly, he jerked his hand free, his mouth tightening as he remembered the Slytherin’s words in the corridor.
“I don’t know what’s going on,” Ron said quietly, his troubled blue eyes meeting Hermione’s own. “But why don’t we go find out?”
“I wanted to show my brother around the castle,” the vampire woman replied irritably.  “For some unfathomable reason, the Headmaster suggested I take him to visit your classroom and so here we are.  Will you let us in now?”
“Gods, I miss you,” he whispered softly, unknowingly.
it.  But he always tried so hard to be so serious, as if he was above such nonsense.”  She giggled again as she brushed his hair.  “If I didn’t do it, I was sure I’d strangle him, he had such a poor manner to him.  The poor boy never knew how to relax.”
:: Harry thought back, smiling inwardly.  He heard Qye chuckle quietly as Madam Pomfrey wrapped up her check-up.
The redhead spread his hands in front of him, smiling.  “I’m just thinking in your best interests,” Ron said innocently.  A mutter came from beneath the blankets.  “What was that?”
-------
Sighing quietly, he said, ::
Marylin swallowed, her heart suddenly racing at the interested look on the normally disinterested vampire.
,’ he thought, still staring at the spot where the taller boy had stood.  ‘
“Oh, by the way,” she said before she called on the next person who raised their hand.  The class looked at her curiously and she smiled sweetly.  “Anyone who thought I was over five hundred had better get a damn good present for my birthday, which is on March 16.”  There was silence.  Then those who hadn’t thought she was over five hundred began to laugh at those who did.  Those who had thought so just smiled sheepishly and Marylin saw the black-haired boy snicker at a pale looking Ron Weasley.
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use.
It’s the third day of waking up without Draco and his heart flutters pleasantly when he spots the new message from Draco.
He is used to the eyes that immediately zero in on him, but apart from the weeks just after the school year started, the other students and people in Hogsmeade are fairly used to him now. Some smile at him, but they are all occupied with each other, sharing drinks and stories and just being social. Hermione waves him over, which is a bit embarrassing, because she nearly topples out of her chair, and he waves back, telling her he will come over soon. He gets a Butterbeer and a shot of Firewhisky, because he is an adult and he rarely indulges in alcohol, and scans the room. All the tables are packed with people, couples, and friends of couples. The teachers sit on their own in the corner by the Christmas tree. Hermione waves again and Harry sighs. But just as he starts his way over, his eyes catch an empty table - or almost empty.
I really have trouble with some of the chapters. The nearer we get to the end, the more I anxious I get to finish. This chapter gave me a huge headache since I was struggleing with writing  only a few words. But maybe sometimes things don't need much words, right?
Granted, Harry really is the philistine Draco always accused him of, so he has no idea what opera they’re hearing, nor does he care, since it’s almost time for the part that he gets to enjoy his present. He barely pays attention as a bloke, dressed in feathers, begins to sing. The words are foreign, hard but melodic, and Harry thinks he’s heard that language before, but it’s just an afterthought.
Draco never felt like he missed out on something, that was, until he met Harry.
The last week before the Holidays passes in a rush. There’s more homework, more papers, more everything, but it doesn’t bother Harry. He’s taken to stopping by the library for an hour or two, escaping the couples in the common room that are enacting goodbye scenes at every opportunity, even though they still have a few days before the train takes them back home. Everywhere he looks, someone is making out or softly crying in desperation over the forced separation, but since it’s for a good and pure reason, he doesn’t mind it much. He's still annoyed, because everyone seems to have someone.
Do the staff names ring a bell? *roars like a T-Rex*
The headaches get worse with every passing month, so bad he sometimes can barely keep his eyes open. On those days, light, no matter how subdued, sends piercing spikes through his brain and makes him sick. He refuses to give into the pain, however; he endured much worse during the war.
Next come specific touches and small gestures, that don’t mean much to Draco, but Harry knows the Veela registers them, waits for them with building anticipation.
Harry wakes with a start. His head hurts, his muscles scream at him, and his throat is parched like he hasn't had something to drink in ages. Despite all that he's relatively comfortable. He isn't in his own bed in the eighth year dorm, but the mattress is soft and the blankets warm. Through the curtains falls soft, dim light, typical for a winter day in Scotland.
Draco relaxes slightly now that he can rest his weight on more than just his knees, his firm ass resting on his heels, his shoulders not as tense as before, and it is the moment when he really lets go and settles into the position that Harry snaps his fingers and the plug picks up its speed and intensity. Draco yelps in an undignified manner and begins to squirm, losing his pose but he knows he’s not allowed to move much and it’s what Harry has waited for. He never plays fair and his lover doesn’t expect him to.
A soft melody whispers through the air and stills Harry immediately. The song is beautiful and memories come to his mind: their first kiss, the first time Draco said ‘I love you’, their first day at the cottage, their wedding. The songs is about love, about forever, deep feelings that sometimes can’t be contained, and the pictures change. Harry sees their first time making love on his bed at Grimmauld Place, their first row and the following make-up sex, their passionate wedding night.
“Hello Mother”, he greets her, his hands buried in his cloak. He feels guilty for neglecting her for so long, but he can’t stand to be here. The Manor weighs heavily on his shoulders, guilt and shame mixed with the pain of his memories. Wherever his mother is, Draco hopes she can forgive him.
“They’re ours. Yours and mine. Like,“ he pauses, unsure if he should continue. Harry urges him on with an impatient wave of his hand. “Like marriage rings, alright?”
It's not Lucius Malfoy, but the marginally lesser of two evils, his son. Who is also an adult, he notices.
Diagon Alley is bustling with people, the good weather pulling them out into the open. Draco is glad their Glamours are very strong as Ron and Hermione rush past them, chasing after Rose. He doesn't want anybody to know where they’re going.
Still, the work is exhausting and Draco is so tired most of the time, that he goes straight to bed without much energy to do more than gulp down something to eat.
Harry settles beside him, talking softly as he wipes away more dirt. It’s mostly nonsense, a way to distract himself from the many injuries that mar Malfoy’s body. His jumper is in tatters and only held together by wishful thinking. The knees of his black jeans are ripped, the skin beneath bloody and burned. Malfoy tries to avoid moving his right leg and whimpers when Harry tries to get a better look. One finger is missing a fingernail, and three fingers of his right hand are certainly broken, standing out at an odd angle.
Their farewell is sweet and steamy, softly murmured words and naughty sex on the kitchen table between the Prophet and strawberry jam.
Mrs Weasley demanding of Draco to leave the Burrow and never come back ended in harsh sobs and ugly tears when Harry left with him.
Draco sighs and renews his Cooling Charm, then gets back to chopping the onions. It isn’t a surprise he’s taken to cooking, not when potions are his passion since he was old enough to reach the rim of a cauldron. He wishes he could do it more often, just to see the sparkle in Harry’s eyes, the pure and earnest joy at something so mundane like a home-cooked meal.
It’s time to change what’s been going on for months now. Time to stop hurting his family, his friends.
nothing comes to mind. Maybe he can at least wipe away some of the blood that flecks Malfoy’s pale cheeks.
There’s a small smile breaking through the haze of pain in Malfoy’s face. It oddly transforms him, makes him prettier, less edgy. It’s freaking Harry out that he notices things like this.
His dreams are full of love, and maybe he is finally ready to go another important step.
“I’d recommend this one, upper right corner. The grip is firm and has an additional Sticking Charm, to prevent it from slipping, the leather is Abraxan. This one doesn’t have any extras, it’s suited for beginners. If you’re both comfortable, you can upgrade to a more advanced model. Those are similar to the Quick-Tickling Quill, finding the best - or worst - places to give the maximum stimulation and react to individual safe words,” Calliope says, her expression knowing. She’s seen Draco's ritual often enough, stalking the premise until he circles in on the thing he wants.
Actually I'm very grateful he is such a good partner, taking an interest in my writing, even if he doesn't care for all that gay stuff :)
It hadn’t even been his fault Pansy’s hat caught fire the first time they met, that one was on Draco, but ever since he has to suffer the consequences. Which means Pansy will be a cold-hearted bitch and Blaise will make fun of him the whole time.
The night is quite warm in Sydney, considering the season. They have a quiet dinner on a private yacht while cruising the harbour. The lights are more vivid, brighter than London, and while Harry does enjoy this overture to their evening, he can’t help feeling excited. There is a spark around them that has nothing to do with real magic or the slight buzz from the excellent wine.
The sex shop is on the eastern side of Diagon Alley, where there are fewer customers and more shadows, and he heaves a sigh of relief as soon as they enter. He doesn't come here often, and is strangely shy and intimidated by what he sees.
“What are you gonna propose this time?”
Draco looks back at Harry, who nods in encouragement and reaches behind Draco to open the collar. There’s a visible shift in both of them. Their scene is halted for the moment because this isn’t something to be decided by Dom and sub.
Veela-Draco needs to be handled more subtle; Harry needs to build the anticipation carefully so Draco decides willingly to let his creature out to play.
It’s the one with whips and crops, which is quite interesting to Harry. It’s a kink they explored very early into their relationship, but decided that it wasn’t right for them. Well, Harry has to admit, he liked the way Draco’s pale skin would turn a soft pink, the noises he made when his hand met his arse. It was Draco who didn’t want to pursue it further. Seems like he wants to try again.
A rustle disturbs the quiet evening and his wings unfold. Harry stares at him in awe, like he sees them for the first time. It’s cute and a bit embarrassing, the way his eyes sparkle. The Veela basks in the awestruck attention and spreads his wings even wider, showing off perfect white feathers flecked with the last remnants of light.
This is like the nastiest chapter ever. I've started it a few times, because I wasn't going anywhere and then I even resorted to asking Wikipedia what TF 'Temptation' actually is. It helped a bit and this came out of it. I'm not satisfied, but maybe you are.
It had been a complete surprise and broken his heart when, for his birthday, he received a letter from her. There seemed to be nothing inside, but when Draco upended the envelope, a single wilted flower fell on the table. Harry had been outraged at first, but Draco saw the dried, orange lily and began to cry.
He leisurely walks the room, around the palm tree, inspecting the boring portrait of some Black ancestor who is asleep most of the time. Everytime he stops Draco has to kneel by his side like the good boy he is, hands clasped behind his back. His knees must be sore and he needs a few seconds to get his balance whenever Harry stops, but the blush doesn’t recede and his breathing is still labored, so it can’t be that bad. And Harry loves the way he moves, the sway of his hips, lewd but so gracious at the same time.
On Friday, he’s elated like he hasn’t been in a long time. He hopes whatever wrackspurt is causing his joyous mood stays around for a while, because he can almost get used to this feeling of simple happiness.
He grabs for the soft mounds, still a little foreign in his hands, and wiggles them around, pushing them together and letting go. They jiggle softly, not much to jiggle anyway, but it’s enough that Draco tries to shy away, embarrassment clearly written on his face. Harry gives him a warning slap on his arse just to remind him who’s birthday this is. It’s like a chain reaction to both of them.
Everyone seemed to have been against them, right from the start. Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys. Harry was tired of explaining to everyone why he loved Draco, why he was the one and would forever be.
As the smoke clears from his eyes, he sees the empty platform stretching endlessly before him. The red locomotive glistens in the sun, ready to move anywhere he wants. He’s never been in the front before, but this is a new adventure and he’s ready for a new experience. As he nears the first carriage, he sees a lone figure standing there, waiting for him.
“Can I see?” Malfoy breaks the silence at last, looking intently at the coin. Harry slides it over for him to inspect, trusting he won’t mess with it. He has to start putting his trust somewhere.
“Huh. Then we are,” Dumbledore says, and the white morphs into brick walls and benches, their wood soft from millions of people who rested here before.
The day couldn’t have been more horrible, more devastating, and it still isn’t over. Harry is grimy and sweaty, the evidence of today’s carnage splattered on his robes, but the crimson fabric hides most of the blood. Just as well, because the children are traumatised enough and don’t need to see more of that horrorshow that is just another Tuesday at the office.
Or the first time he fumbled his way through sex with some nameless guy in the broom closet at the Auror office. Glenn later dropped out of the training, deeply hurt that Harry hadn’t wanted a relationship but fast and uncomplicated sex, once he got a taste.
He soon developed another way out, letting his fantasy run away to exotic places in far away countries. Of course he was always the hero in his stories, fighting evil Muggles and dangerous dragons, rescuing the prince or princess in distress, finding the lost treasure. It was so easy for his mind to slip away, to explore and just experience a freedom he could never have in the cage that was his sophisticated upbringing.
He thinks about what he just witnessed. Elitist pureblood Draco Malfoy enjoying chocolate like it’s the best thing in the world. Better than superiority or bullying other students or even Quidditch. He remembers the huge parcels his mother would sent him at the beginning of every school year and realises that those deliveries stopped sometime in third year. He’s sure there is a story behind it, but he won’t ask, not today. They’re having a good time, the third week in a row, and their easy friendship (when did that happen?) is still fragile enough that Harry doesn’t want to strain it with imposing questions.
The fantasies changed then. He wasn’t the brave adventurer anymore but the damsel in distress, rescued by a golden hero who had suspicious resemblance to a certain Boy-Who-Lived. He spent many hours dreaming of is rescue, barely holding it together in front of the Dark Lord or his mad aunt whenever they decided to have a stroll through his mind.
Since Harry’s childhood hasn’t been a well of endless joy, he likes simple, sometimes childish things best, like watching the telly, riding a bike or visiting the zoo.
Malfoys hands fly over the letters, the glow softly reflecting in his white face. His fingers are fast and Harry can’t follow them all, helpless when he sees him tapping the middle three times to send it to every other coin. A few seconds pass, then Harry hears the choked exhale of someone reading the message, followed by a few snickers. Over the crowd he hears Ron’s enraged “How dare he?” and Hermione’s frantic tries to shush him, to not make a scene. Malfoy slides the Galleon back over the table.
While his sub floats into the bedroom, Harry rightens the staircase and mentally prepares for the next part of their session. He smiles, thinking about all the things he has planned for today and realises, again, how much he loves his birthday.
His eyes, watching Harry with unconcealed kindness and more love than he’s ever seen before, are otherworldly.
The crash of the frying pan hitting the tiled floor is deafening to Draco’s delicate ears and makes him flinch violently, his hand hitting the basket with the cherry tomatoes, sending it over the counter.
The silver chain of the leash tinkles softly as Harry attaches it to Draco’s leather collar. A thrill rushes through him at being dragged around like a naughty Crup. Harry knows what public displays do to him, and they often engage in such scenes. He fondly remembers their evening at Hyde Park a few years back.
As soon as he can, Draco begins to babble, “Please” and “Yes” and “No” and “Harry”. He’s too far gone to remember the rules, a fact that Harry lets slide for now. He’s riding the edge hard and feels the unstoppable force of his orgasm crash through his body, setting his veins on fire. He’s meeting Draco now at every thrust, making everything harder and more intense.
It’s timed perfectly as the yacht softly bumps against the pier.
He settles for touching them through the dress, amazed by everything he feels. He’s circling in on a nipple, erect but oddly shaped when he remembers Draco’s birthday present. His piercings are healed now and it’s also the first time they’re able to play with them. It gives him a few ideas for when the opera picks up again. For now, he settles on some heavy petting above the clothes that has Draco squirming under his hands.
Something rustles behind him, but when he looks back, Malfoy is still muffled up, following Harry’s lead. He doesn’t have a destination, so he just walks, pretending to do some window shopping, while he wonders what he should do. The rustle follows him, but he never sees anything suspicious and Malfoy doesn’t talk. They wander the length of the village, finding themselves opposite the Shrieking Shack. It’s almost dark when Harry stops and swirls around, tired of the continued silence.
The woman steps to the front counter. She’s as always, a force of nature, over six foot tall, with flowing black hair. She has recently changed her hairstyle, so her hair reached her hips, going from black to fiery red at the tips and it suits her well. Adding to her impressive size she wears murderously high over knee boots made of black nundu-leather and tightly laced in an intricate pattern. If Harry wasn’t bend in every direction and in a very happy relationship he might go for such a fine woman.
The Glamour falls from him at the snap of Harry’s fingers, exposing their true identities. At the same time, he hears the lock on the shop door click. They’re alone here, there’s no need to hide anymore.
“You can’t imagine half of it. I’ve never been so glad to leave the hospital behind.”
Malfoy pleads with him the whole time, begs him to stop, to reconsider, tells him fantastic stories of sentient houses and medieval serial killers, but it’s all just background music for Harry’s creativity. He’s not a predator anymore, he’s an artist with an exquisite canvas. He’s just started but he already can’t take his eyes off the ethereal beauty that he creates with skilled cuts.
Anyway, in light of their fun time on Saturday, he nods his thanks before assessing the damage he’s done.
It’s the first time today that Calliope addresses him directly. He dares to catch her gaze, sees the playful glint in her eyes. Her demeanor is still professional.
Harry acquires some samples - being the Chosen One is useful sometimes, but only for something as simple as free reject chocolate. He presents Malfoy his spoils and just nods at the unspoken question. The hand that snatches some small pieces of a destroyed Chocolate Frog is shaking lightly, but Harry doesn’t know if it’s some kind of misplaced awe or just the first signs of low blood sugar. He decides on excitement when he sees Malfoy closing his eyes in utter bliss as the chocolate melts on his tongue. He’s sure he can hear a soft groan, even though nobody else can.
He pulls the dress up, bunching it against his hips, exposing himself. The panties bulge around his cock. It’s the cock cage, but Harry is sure it’s quite uncomfortable by now, suppressing an impressive hard-on. He pulls the panties down, slowly, inch by inch, stopping when the cage is visible. The way Draco’s member presses against the confines looks painful, but he’s getting off on it too, he can tell.
“No escaping into subspace just yet. We’re not done here,” Harry says with a smirk that makes Draco hot and cold and giddy.
The dress is low-cut and accents all the right places, framed by straps that seem to be held up by magic. All he wants to pull them down to get his hands and lips on the secret underneath.
“Yeah, sure,” he says, but his heart isn’t in it and Malfoy hears it.
Draco would never tell anybody, but he listens to his husband’s voice so often, he can recite the stories in his dreams.
It was hard to acquire everything, especially since Draco had to deal with certain Muggles. It's ridiculous, the amount of force he had to use to get something the Muggles didn't even want anymore, but he made the mistake to tell them it was for Harry. Draco isn't proud of himself, but his old prejudices surfaced once again while he had to deal with Harry's pig-headed relatives. More than once he caught himself muttering generic crap against the non-magical population. Crap his father forced into his mind, when he was still trying to impress a man that couldn’t possibly be impressed.
“It’s a bondage horse, in case you were wondering. This is the compact form, just the body without any extras. The wood is Amboyna Burl, giving you that extra kick. Powerful and energetic, but needs a hard hand. In contrast, the leather is simple cowhide, soft, and easy to maintain. The wood is powerful enough to infuse the cowhide with its properties, so it would be overkill to use magical leather.”
He nods, satisfied with Kreacher’s work, and waits for Draco to catch up. His dragon pants heavily, sweat coating his alabaster skin, but his hard-on is still there, still dripping, so Harry knows he enjoys himself. He bumps into Harry’s leg, startled by the sudden stop, but not gone enough to forget his place. He keeps his eyes on the ground, relieved for the short break. Not for long.
It’s hours - or maybe mere seconds - before Draco finally lands in front of him, and Harry goes to him without hesitation. They melt into each other, Harry’s nose buried in Draco’s hair, inhaling the enticing scent that is totally new but still Draco at the same time.
“Me neither. We could eat and see what happens next? I was thinking about a nice Filet Mignon, some wine and a foot massage?”
Pansy must have seen something in his eyes, because she leans over, and tells him in a sickly-sweet voice: “Don’t get used to it, I haven’t forgotten what you did to my favourite hat.”
The voice calls for him again, so he walks forward, leaving the grand hallway and trudging down a flight of stairs that has seen better days. They lead to a parlour that is dusty and unclean. The curtains here are mouldy, the colour of old cheese and powdery moss. It smells like mothballs and decay, like rotten plants and brackish water.
A voice bellows through the Atrium and Harry's shoulders sag in relief. Junior Aurors swarm the place, forcing the reporters to give way for the men clad in green robes: Healers from St. Mungo’s, lead by nobody else than Harry's husband.
It’s already weighing heavy on his conscience, and he knows it’s his fault, and only his, that that little girl will likely die before the week is over. If he hadn’t been so stupid as a teenager, hadn’t followed his father like a good, mindless crup, he wouldn’t be tainted by the crimes he was forced to commit during the war. Maybe he’d have even fought on the right side and people would now look up to him, like they look up at Harry.
He has never felt pain this strong, this all-encompassing like at this moment. The otter burns through his skin, his flesh, into his core, eradicating the shadows that have taken a hold of his mind. He hasn’t known they were there, but the agony of them leaving lets no room for doubt.
There are boots on his feet, heavy and sturdy, shimmering in the pale light. Dragonhide, his mind supplies, but he doesn't know how he knows. He's wearing black jeans that fit surprisingly well. There is a hole in the knee, but it doesn't come from prolonged use.
The lights in the drawing room are dimmed, just some forgotten fairy lights around the fireplace. The curtains are drawn tight, to fend off the summer heat and set the right mood. It’s cosy and comfortable and Harry feels the stress of the Ministry disperse, feels the peace sooth the hurt of everyday life, of criminals running free. Years ago he felt guilty slipping out of his Auror skin so easily, but all he feels now is contentment. He’s here and he enjoys being here. He can worry later, and he will. Just not now.
Draco lights up immediately. Although he isn’t fixated on material things, not like he was when they were in school, he likes getting things, especially when Harry chooses them for him. He steps up to the mantle, only to sink into a perfect curtsy, immaculate, and still and waiting.
Sometimes he struggles with his own barrenness, the Veela demanding to be useful. It doesn’t understand that procreation doesn’t work with good intentions and a strong will, and it’s unhappy, feeling neglected and robbed of its true purpose. Draco often has to fight the, somewhat, ridiculous demands the creature has.
Draco had been up all night, wondering if it really was going anywhere, pressured by his guilt and the headline of tomorrow’s Prophet, which was surely going to be devastating for the both of them.
They don’t talk on Friday.
And, he realises, he doesn’t need to make this last walk on his own. He’s the Master of Death, which means that death has no meaning for him anymore. He can command it just like he can command his broom. It’s a gift, probably the last one he will ever get, but this once Harry doesn’t hesitate, doesn’t mind being selfish, like the brothers.
Someone is calling him, so Harry peels the sheets from his body and scoots over to the edge of the curtains. His muscles scream in agony, but the pain feels pure like after an intense Quidditch practice. Or several of them. His brain thrums away in his skull, but that pain is also manageable. Only when he puts his feet to the ground, everything is wrong.
Over the last few months their feud died down. They both have seen enough violence during the war and lost their taste for mindless rivalry. Malfoy keeps to himself, somewhat isolated from the Slytherins, but they don’t actively avoid him. He just seems more content being alone. Harry can relate to that.
Ron waffles on and on about something or other, but Harry barely listens. They are mirroring each other: Hermione lies asleep in Ron’s lap, while Draco snuggles shamelessly into Harry’s belly. They fell asleep at about the same time, five minutes into the evening, and didn’t even finish their tumblers of Ogden’s finest, leaving Ron and Harry to their own devices.
Everything is perfect, and Harry might choke a little on the heavy emotions he feels at this moment. He’s never loved someone as much as Draco. The words sound hollow when he gets them out, never enough to really express what he feels.
He gracefully sinks to his knees. The water has washed away the suds, but the skin still tastes slightly lemony, almost overpowering Harry’s natural musk. He sets to work, quick and clever strokes with his tongue, sweet kisses and firm suction and Harry writhes under the onslaught. It doesn’t take long for him to reach his climax and he shudders and moans as he gives Draco everything.
