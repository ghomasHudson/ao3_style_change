He got slowly to his feet, back straight despite the throbbing of his head. “What’s that supposed to mean? Look, I’m sorry if your daytime dalliances disgust me, Potter and that hurts your feelings, but—”
Draco’s gaze landed on the shower area, and his fists tightened against his robes, the lyrics of that fated song twisting back to the fore of his mind in a feline, inescapably elegant sort of way. God, he loved that song. It had kept him alive, alive in a sort of visceral, speaks- to- my- soul sort of sense.
He flushed, drawing upwards as best he could with his torso twisted around in his chair, and retorted, “I’m still tall enough to jinx that wand out of your hand so quickly it decides it’d rather be mine.”
Large hands spread across his back, warm and a little clumsy. Shocked, maybe. They pressed Harry to him, one sliding up to tangle in his hair. Malfoy breathed out gently, and his head came down to nuzzle Harry’s head, lips opening to press warmly against his hair. It was completely bizarre, and completely beautiful, and Malfoy smelled like nighttime and smoke and skin. Without meaning to, Harry opened his mouth slightly just as Malfoy shifted unconsciously, pressing him closer, and then Harry was kissing the curve of Malfoy’s shoulder, open- mouthed and languid.
Blaise was contemplative for a second, skin glowing like the love-child of coffee and cream, dimple pressing obscenely deep in the warm light. The woman blushed as he regarded her lazily, eyes half- lidded. “Shot of Ogden’s Firewhisky on the rocks? And keep them coming. Or, you know what, just bring the bottle, and once that’s finished cut me off.” He gave her a smile filled with easy charm. “I’m holding you accountable for my sobriety, now. Don’t let me down.”
“Probably India. They’re playing Wales tomorrow, and Bulgaria’re against Bogota the day after that, but they’ll be fighting it out for fourth and fifth; Bulgaria just aren’t as good without Krum. Damn shame he retired.” Ginny shook her head sagely.
“—But for most girls, sitting alone is a big deal. If you do it, people call you a loner, but secretly everyone’s afraid of it, of having the guts to do it. Anyway, I was sure they were talking about me, so I sort of gave them a look, and—”
“Fuck’s sake,” he moaned, wringing the handle up and down so vigorously his wrist started to ache. He turned back to Blaise and Pansy for help, but Blaise’s nose was still buried in the bloody Quibbler, and Pansy was now waxing lyrical about the slope of the girl’s nose, which she wasn’t likely to stop doing even if she did help him.
It took him a minute for his vision to focus, and as it did, freckles, red hair and a long, pale nose swam into view alarmingly close to his own face. Harry slid back with a yell, away from Ron’s startled countenance.
,” Zabini snapped, and something in his voice, frayed with anxiety and a badly veiled depth of concern, made Draco say, “alright. Okay. We’ll look into it after Charms, yeah?”
Draco hated anyone being a possessive little shit with Potter. Hated it absolutely. But maybe… maybe that was because he’d branded Potter’s name on himself every damn time he came to the image of him looking up through those dark lashes, ingrained Harry Potter so deeply on his subconscious that, in a twisted way, he’d always seen Potter as, well.
Draco backed out of the broom cupboard, smiling thinly at Potter’s feral expression as he hurled himself towards Draco again and again, held back only by Finnigan, who was remarkably broader than he had been before the summer.
Looking up, Draco got a fleeting visual of Pansy giving him daggers and Blaise preening himself in the mirror, before he got hurriedly to his feet and smiled.
“Ginny!” Hermione cried, coming a little ungracefully down the stairs, hand protectively curved over her belly. “Oh…” she looked dismayed. “You look dreadful.”
“Look, Zabini, it wasn’t me who ratted them out, okay? Now for god’s sake leave me the—” Draco broke off, clapping a hand to his forehead as a searing pain went through it. The knife behind his eyes was now slicing steadily into his optic nerves. Draco gasped for breath, head pounding, and dark red spots appeared in his vision. He shook his head frantically, trying to clear them, but he could only wheeze and cough into his hand. To his horror, a spray of garish red erupted onto his palm, peppering his mouth with the metallic tang of blood. Theo Nott, who had been watching Draco and Zabini argue worriedly, sprang to his feet and cupped Draco’s head in his hands, eyes roving his face worriedly.
this girl, and she’s special. I never thought we’d work, but we do, and didn’t I tell you that you couldn’t make fun of me?”
Draco reeled backwards, clutching his stomach and wheezing, head down. His eyes streamed from the force of the impact. When his vision finally cleared enough for him to look up, he recoiled at the sight of the person in front of him, arms wrapped protectively around himself, bent over and hacking.
“I hate when you change the subject onto my love life. Ok, fine. Fucking relentless. But remember, you have no right to laugh at this story because it reaped a really big benefit for you two as well.”
“Please, Malfoy. Give me a sodding break. You never take your eyes off the boy- not in the Hall, not in lessons, not anywhere. You haven’t noticed he’s been gone all week?”
“I’d rather overuse Expelliarmus than be the first one to fire off an Unforgivable!” Potter spat. His shirt gaped open at the front as he swung his body round entirely, and Draco watched with a slack jaw as he
Malfoy stared up at him from the floor, mouth red and eyes completely dark. His pupils were dilated, black swallowing up grey, and the sight of him made Harry’s cock throb desperately. He was still so fucking hard, and Malfoy cupped his erection through his boxers, gaze reverent.
But now… now here was this pureblood, highbrowed and fair- skinned and shamelessly aristocratic, magical fingertips sliding over Winston Churchill’s miniature plastic face. It occurred dimly to Harry that he should offer to pay instead, but then Malfoy was turning to him, leather wallet in hand, and he was obscenely attracted to him, so much so that he didn’t think he could move in any direction, much less speak. He was galvanised, lips dry as Malfoy came towards him. His grey eyes were half- shielded by blond hair, and he looked almost… shy. He was worrying his lip, not sensually (though it was definitely one of the more adorable things Harry had ever witnessed) but anxiously, teeth sliding over his bottom lip and reddening it.
Harry offered him a smile, a small quirk of the lips. “Yeah, the house- elf turned the place around when we were on the run, staying here.”
“Yes, Mr Malfoy. It is, I daresay at this early stage, a good idea. I’m glad the two of you are… attempting to sort out your differences.” The corner of her mouth quirked up, and Draco blushed the bright, embarrassed red he’d been threatening to turn for the past twenty minutes. He sensed Potter, beside him, do the same.
Draco knew that voice, and he swore inwardly, turning back around to face his work. Sure enough, out of his peripheral vision he could see a pale face, dark hair framing it, tilted towards Weasley in languid interest. The ginger replied uncharacteristically quietly, voice fond and head bent to Potter’s, and Draco found he didn’t want to listen in on their conversation. The sight of the reddish-orange and dark hair tipped earnestly together in a quick, thoughtless exchange made something in Draco’s stomach curdle. He stared down determinedly, trying in vain not to think of Potter, incredulous and argumentative outside the Owlery; Potter, cold and sharp in Charms class; Potter, flushed, dishevelled, hurling himself towards Draco in a tiny broom cupboard with Finnigan’s arms around him.
“If I had even a shred of respect for you, I think I might actually have been turned on. You remember that, Malfoy?”
Speaking of… Draco’s ears pricked up. He heard the faint swish of robes around the corner, light feet. It
“He’s not allowed visitors,” Zabini mumbled, and Draco felt a hot spike of worry pierce his throat, choking him off for a second.
“Where did you actually go, may I ask?” Blaise inquired, dimpling roguishly at her. “To see a special someone? Or should I say…” he leaned in, licking his lips obnoxiously. “
A girl walked in front of Harry, the flare of her dress momentarily blocking his view, and he gave a deep sigh of frustration. Being him—being like this—was exhausting.
“Why not? Why NOT?!” Ron interrupted, and now his lashes were wet as well, both pairs of brown Weasley eyes thick with unshed tears.
“You.” Malfoy walked further into the kitchen, leaning back against a counter with his arms crossed. “You could’ve lived here. In a different place to your friends.”
“Our waitress wants to sleep with you. Luckily, she’s not yet under the impression you want to sleep with
He clutched his bare, golden sides, rolling around on his chair with tears streaming down to well in his dimples. It was disgustingly beautiful, and incredibly infectious. Draco found himself howling with laughter too, hands buried in his messy hair and stomach aching from laughter.
rippled over him, and he wondered briefly what his own name would sound like on those lips, in that sinful tone. But then he was jerked out of his reverie by the screaming knowledge of just what exactly Potter had been talking about.
“I thought you didn’t care about anything, Malfoy,” Weasley fought, hair bristling with indignation. “What, not too good for Hogwarts anymore?”
Ginny rolled her eyes heartlessly. “Oh, give over. Harry and I both play for the opposite team, we established that a long time ago. Honestly, you’d think you’d have developed a stronger stomach for this stuff.”
to them- and Draco felt faint. His mouth was so, so red, slick and pouty as though he’d been biting his lip a lot, and next to the milkiness of his skin and the sharpness of his jaw… he was the most arousing thing Draco had ever seen in his life.
The fire crackled behind them as though laughing, and McGonagall waited patiently, grey-black eyebrows raised with an austere sort of archness.
She giggled into his shirt, and the sound was muffled but so fucking familiar to him. He’d grown up with that giggle, and his chest heaved once as he squeezed her even tighter, his mind for once not spinning as he absorbed her into himself as much as he could. And then, having overcome the urge to sob into her hair, he gripped her shoulders hard and set her at arm’s length. Pansy peered up at him, eyes red- rimmed and peaceful.
!” With an exclamation of despair, Draco shook the gel out from his hair, dampening it with a quick splash of water from the sink, and threw the door open. As he ran down the corridor, through his bedroom and past the kitchen, he raked a hand through the thick mass of it so it fell carelessly over his eyes and framed his cheekbones. He rounded the corner at breakneck speed, pulled his dress shoes from below the ottoman, and yanked them on, doing the laces up with a complicated little bit of wandless magic.
Potter’s expression became cold. His breath was coming slightly more evenly now, but he was no less flushed, and his jaw was a hard, smooth line.
The journey was torturous. It could not have been more than twenty five metres from his table to the small gate on the side of the bar leading to the toilets, but it seemed to him like he’d been walking for hours. Every time someone sniggered or sighed his entire body seemed to curl in on itself, paranoid they were sneering at him, waiting for him to go faster, mocking him.
His eyes glided over Harry, and they felt like stroking fingertips, landing obviously on the bulge in Harry’s boxers. He stared for so long it was entirely inappropriate, and Harry wanted him so badly it felt painful.
The bell rang, cutting through the dialogue all around the room, and Draco tucked his hands into his pockets, hanging back, waiting for everyone else to leave. But Weasley couldn’t close his bag, fumbling with the buckle and shoving at his awkwardly positioned belongings to make room. Out of the corner of Draco’s eye, half- obscured by a piece of blond hair that was hanging over his bent face,  he saw Potter and Granger approaching, Granger still fiddling with the strap on her own satchel.
“Yeah,” Blaise never missed a beat, cheekbones only further enhanced by the attractively mocking smile he was sporting. “You said we couldn’t take the piss because your dating this girl-
The hummingbird, having delivered its message, zoomed off over the tables to its mistress. Draco looked briefly over his shoulder to catch Pansy’s eye, sparkling wickedly, and gave her a wink. Next to her, Blaise was smug- faced, mouth still smeared liberally with chocolate. Draco couldn’t bring himself to turn away from Harry for too long, giving them both a lascivious grin. Vaguely, he registered both their expressions turn to mild shock, and realised he’d dealt them a bit too much sex energy in that grin.
His hands were sure on the waistband of Malfoy’s boxers, dragging them down until they pooled around Malfoy’s ankles, his cock springing free to hang heavily between his legs, stiff and flushed.
“Then you should be thanking me!” Draco whisper- yelled, fingers tight on the pages of his textbook. “I’m the one stopping you from wrecking it so neither of us get a T in this stupid subject!”
would fall on his face, clearly far drunker than anyone has any right to be before second bloody period, into what’s clearly a hookup, and
Draco read the letter through, setting his quill down gently. Suddenly, the entire incident seemed ludicrous to him. Of course it had been him. Who was going to know a Muggle song? He swore quietly. Suddenly, he didn’t want to say any more. He picked up his quill once more and slashed a hasty goodbye, telling Pansy he would write to her again and that he hoped to see her soon; whenever she was on holiday. Quickly, he dashed down the dormitory stairs, through the common room, and out into the bowels of the school. Mentally, he cursed the fact that the Slytherin common room was so many levels down. His legs ached as he ran up the main staircase, tie loosened and shirtsleeves pushed up. When he finally reached the landing that preceded the Owlery, he rounded the corner at breakneck speed, letter clutched in his hand, and promptly crashed into someone.
But there was someone else in there too, a voice Draco just knew didn’t belong to him or any of his alter egos, or even the version of his deceased father that was immortalised in his subconscious. It was low, gravelly, and utterly unrelated to the issue at hand. Simply, it was repeating one thing, over and over.
The class moved into action, books being picked up and chairs dragged across the classroom and bags dumped down in different places.
Malfoy leaned closer, so they were completely pressed up against each other along their entire bodies. His breath was warm when he whispered against Harry’s ear, hips rolling infinitesimally, enough to drive Harry completely crazy.
There, lying in fractured little shards, were the remains of a small glass bottle, and smeared thickly on the sticky stone flags was a viscous liquid that could only be describes as pink- tinged. The red lid had rolled a bit and was lying some feet away, near where Granger and Potter were working.
“Look, Malfoy, I’ve got to go. I need to catch up to Flitwick about the Charms I missed in the hospital wing. But I—”
******************************************************************************************************************************************************
Still smiling, Draco headed hastily for the Slytherin table, no longer paying attention to any looks thrown his way. The Hall settled down as he took a seat, grabbed a chicken leg, and started to eat ravenously, feeling the Quidditch- induced hunger start to abate.
” Potter bobbed his head in time to the sound of his name, mouth pinched as though he was tasting something sour. But for all his seeming distaste in being so underhand, Draco could see through it. There was victory, sweet vindictiveness in Potter’s eyes, and Draco couldn’t look away.
It seemed both a very short and terribly long time until Draco heard the sound of feet on the stone of the dormitory steps, and the first gaggle of Slytherin girls padded sleepily through the common room, still tightening their green- striped ties and pulling emerald ribbons through their hair. Soon after, a trio of small boys burst down the stairs, jittering excitedly across the room, hair mussed as they slipped hastily through the dungeon door and fled, unable to contain themselves at the delicious aromas from the kitchen that had somehow begun to permeate even the common room way below the lake. From there, droves of students emerged from the dormitories, in various states of dress and fatigue. But it was not until the last sleep- deprived, weary fifth- year had slumped from the room, trailing Charms notes, that Draco unfurled himself on the cushy window seat and went up the stairs to dress. After all, he had plenty of time; Hufflepuff finished practice twenty minutes before first period, and that was ages away. Draco wasn’t hungry, either- his stomach felt oddly queasy from sleeping so little, and he wanted water more than anything.
“It was in the Prophet four days ago. The guy who spilled on… on my mum, and the others. He came out with a whole article about how it was him. He wanted money from the Ministry, or something stupid. I... thought you knew.” He had the grace to look at his dark shoes, brown eyes just shy of sheepish.
They were interrupted by a sharp clacking sound- all three of them looked up to see an obese tawny owl knocking determinedly against the kitchen window with its sharp yellowish beak.
This one hadn’t even been going that badly, until the guy proved himself to be a sexist, racist twat firmly set against Muggle- borns.
Harry swallowed, drinking in the sight of Malfoy above him like that, so fucking… cocky and arrogant and bloody beautiful.
“Thanks,” he said, grabbing his own wand from the side table and stuffing it in his back pocket. He turned back to Ginny.
Pansy quirked an eyebrow. “What d’you mean? D’you guys seriously not know what Ginny Weasley does for a job?”
“I think we’ll kick off with some light group practical work, seeing as this is only our second class, and we spent the first one doing admin, really, didn’t we?” Flitwick chuckled lightly, and a ripple of agreement went through the class of six.
After all, this was the first step of the plan- whatever happened, he’d be closer to finding out who he’d been communing with all this time.
It was a lot, especially with Pansy’s nipples pressing up conspicuously against the fabric of her boy’s school shirt.
The cab cut through black, glistening roads, pools of rainwater gleaming silver in the lamplight, and it was really a beautiful night, Harry thought. A sense of delicious peace pervaded him. As Malfoy’s hand slowly reached over to curve around Harry’s knee, Harry’s stomach tightened, curling up and knotting beautifully, and his cock throbbed. With a complete abandonment of his fear that the ferocious desire pulsing through him was not reciprocated, he shifted over to Malfoy, jeans sliding over the leather, and placed his own hand on the leg of Malfoy’s trousers, palm sliding over the fabric.
“No!” Ron protested. “No, I don’t- it’s not that, I don’t care, Harry, you know I don’t,” and he looked up anxiously at Harry as though he was checking Harry knew he was not, in fact, homophobic.
Draco nodded dazedly and looked up at Potter in something that felt like apology. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…”
“So, I was sort of… low. I didn’t tell you guys about it but around Christmastime, my parents were under a lot of strain- like, their relationship. And I know that’s old hat for us dysfunctional purebloods, but my parents- well, you two remember how they used to be? I always figured they were…” Pansy chewed her lip, voice wobbling slightly. Blaise’s eyes widened; this was completely unlike her.
He gathered himself, launched back into speech, no longer allowing himself to look at Potter. Maybe it was a good thing Weaslette had turned too. Gave him someone to direct the words to.
Harry heard the seam of Malfoy’s lips part, a strangely intimate sound in the empty space, and he looked up.
Draco choked on his chicken, letting the hunk of meat fall from his hand and land with a clatter on his plate. The surprise of seeing those green eyes fixed on him made him swallow, hard, for multiple reasons, most of which he would have preferred not to think about. Draco recalled with a wince the nights spent staring at the swathes of material covering the top of his four- poster, visualising those very same green eyes, trying to pinpoint the exact emotion they stirred up in his belly. He had never succeeded. He glanced up again through his hair, which had fallen forwards over his forehead. No; Potter was now engaged in conversation with Weasley, who had become if possible more gangly and red- headed since the War. Draco had heard rumours that he was with Granger, and it had made his stomach leap, not in joy for the happy couple, but because secretly he’d always thought maybe Potter would… well, he’d always hated Granger for being close to Potter, And after Granger’s little Cinderella act- he had become familiar with Muggle fairy tales while haunting the London bookshop every day- at the Yule Ball, Draco hadn’t slept for weeks, thinking feverishly of ways to uglify her permanently. He told himself once again that it was only that he hadn’t wanted to see Granger happy. Or Potter. It was because he hated Potter. Hated him.
“But then, we mustn’t forget the only exception to your admirable independence, must we? Of course, that was when your life fucking depended on it, so I s’pose you didn’t mind asking for my charity then. You remember, Malfoy? Your hand, slipping over mine, and then you yelled- do I have it right? Correct me if I’m mistaken; I would never dream of saying anything except the honest truth to you. You said,
“It has been… one of the few failures of my career,” she continued. “Getting Slytherin and Gryffindor to regard one another as anything but enemies.”
“A botched jinx- maybe a Headache Hex or a Fever Spell, I can’t be sure,” Professor Flitwick said grimly. “You should be alright now, Mr Malfoy. How are you feeling?”
Blaise pressed his lips together, and to his credit, Draco would never have guessed at his amusement if it weren’t for his dimple pressing so deeply into his cheek it looked like a miniature abyss.
“Oh… great.” Potter looked nonplussed, and maybe a little suspicious, hair falling endearingly into his eyes and sticking up crazily. He looked confusedly between Blaise and Draco, and Draco wanted to laugh madly, because last Potter saw, he and Blaise were at each other’s throats. Blaise was also clearly struggling not to smirk, as Draco kept seeing the ghost of a dimple flashing in and out of his cheek while his muscles worked to keep his face blank.
Draco kept his eyes glued to the ground, slowly doing a half- turn and making his way over to where Potter was sitting- or rather, in his eyeline, the thick chair legs. He shoved his hands in his pockets, throat dry, and stood awkwardly behind Potter’s chair, just out of sight. Madly, he wondered if it were too late to do a good leg workout for some extra muscle enhancement. He settled for a frantic, rather unsubtle arse flex under the clinging fabric of his trousers, and was rewarded by an explosive snort from behind him, undoubtedly from either Pansy or Blaise. Draco dragged his eyes up the chair legs, painstakingly dragging over the polished base and back of the chair, the armrests, and then there was the broad line of Potter’s shoulders, a silkily clinging shirt, pale neck exposed a fraction of a centimetre above the collar. Dark, thick hair curling round his temples, ending in an unfairly endearing peak at the nape of the neck. His back muscles were tense, still under the shimmering shirt, and then they fucking
Draco thought viciously, and then felt guilty. He’d probably feel the same way if he thought someone had said something to get his mother in trouble with the Ministry. God knows a tarnished slate didn’t just wash out—
“Sorry, Ron, it’s just I…” her slim hand went to her belly, heavily rounded now. “I get these mood swings sometimes.” She looked a little uncertain, which was understandably uncommon, considering she’d spent her entire school career juggling saving Harry and Ron and being constantly right.
Pansy looked amused, and Draco didn’t know why. It rubbed him the wrong way, and because he was a spiteful bastard by nature he said, “So, Pans, we never did finish that conversation.”
The Hufflepuff looked incredulous at such a question. Though the kid was a cocky little bastard, Draco wanted to tell him to wipe that look off his face. Professor McGonagall did not appreciate being treated like an idiot. Predictably, her mouth thinned even further than its normal prim line, becoming barely visible to any eyes without a Sharpening Charm on them.
There was a pause while Theo closed his eyes, and lifted his wand in line with his head. Then, he murmured an incantation, to low for Draco to hear, and ran the wand from his head in a sweeping motion down to his waist.
Aroused past all recognition as he was, he scowled up at Malfoy. He could feel himself straining against his jeans, and silently dragged in a breath, heart pounding. He was so bloody weak, muscles flooded with a languid ecstasy that made him want to just dissolve into Malfoy, be swallowed up by him. The other man smirked, a slow quirk of his lips that spread upwards into something entirely too sexy. Harry stared.
helping—oh, alright.” The lock on the door clicked, and the silvery knob turned. Hermione emerged, looking slightly greenish.
“Suppose you found your balls. I could have helped with that, but looks like Finnigan here was doing a good enough job on his own.” He tossed Finnigan a cruel smirk, savoured the clench of the Irish boy’s jaw.
It made him want to wreck him, to be perfectly honest, and Zabini’s greedy hands on him weren’t helping the situation.
Pansy had abandoned him minutes previously, brushing her fingers over his and leaving for Arithmancy, the broad set of her shoulders slightly stiff under the weight of her bag. It was so odd hearing her feminine purr come out of Theo Nott’s chapped lips—
Draco stared at her from across the table. He looked towards Blaise for help, but Blaise was seemingly engrossed in the Quibbler, dark chocolate eyes fixed on a chunky block of text, doubtless some propaganda about an invented magical creature. However, his gaze did not seem to be moving, and now that Draco was looking, that crooked dimple in his right cheek was deepening steadily as the seconds went by.
Harry dipped his tongue out so it flickered over the head of Malfoy’s cock, slipping into the slit and licking lightly over the pre-come that had collected there.
, he thought desperately, willing the Shield Charm to hold until he could get inside. But it was weakening steadily, and he was so close to the changing rooms, but then he felt a dribble of rainwater over his nose, and he spluttered, swearing.
The cab screeched as it paused at a traffic light, and Malfoy turned to look at him. Harry caught his breath at the sight. They stared at each other wildly, hands still on each other’s legs, and Malfoy’s brow furrowed lightly, as though he were in pain, as his gaze travelled over Harry’s lips, his jaw, his hair, and then over his shirt and legs that were pressed together in the seat.
As Harry felt cool air hit his shoulders, his nipples, the lower planes of his stomach, he felt Malfoy’s hands come up to cover him, big and warm and wonderfully soothing, sending ripples of goosebumps and want alike over Harry skin as they kissed. Malfoy pulled back suddenly, lips an obscene shade of red, and Harry couldn’t suppress a grin at the sight of him. He looked… fucking unreal, and Harry told him so.
“But,” and Hermione’s brow furrowed, “you said you were in fifth year? But you started dating Harry when you were in fifth year too, and you thought you loved him.”
Panic and hurt started to churn in Harry’s stomach, a cold tossing weight of unpleasantness. He didn’t know what to say.
This was the first date he’d been on without Ginny double- dating with him. And even those had been sparse, to be honest. Auror training had taken up most of his time. But now the two years of theory were over, he had a huge summer break. And dating, much as he tried to avoid it, was something that he had to do.
Malfoy had a full glass with white wine next to his two upturned cards. Many colourful chips were stacked before him on the table. Harry mostly ignored all the other suit-wearers on his way. They barely noticed him at all. It was somewhat refreshing, after the constant attention in the wizarding world, to be simply ignored because he wasn't important enough.
"Well," Harry said. "I certainly understand what you mean. I feel a bit like a hooker. He wasn't even here a full hour." He shook his head and pulled Draco closer at the waist.
“Oh yes,” Draco said. “He’s a slut, bending lower, his hands on the tiles, making obscene noises. His breathing is ragged, as he pushes his feet farther apart. He-”
“I could have told you, you would fall, from a mile away, Draco,” a familiar voice said and Draco turned his head to meet the amused eyes of Tom Riddle, which nearly made him drop the box all over again.
Harry felt like he had three puzzle pieces of Malfoy, but they were all from different pictures. Nothing fit together in his head.
Draco swallowed put then followed behind. The dildo was translucent and had large veins on its surface. When he touched it, it bent from side to side. Silicon. Draco saw Harry watching intently as he climbed onto the stool, took the lube Tom gave him, slicked up the giant dildo once more, and slowly lowered himself onto it. His dick was still flagging but it wasn't as painful anymore.
The elevator was still functioning, however, and soon they stepped out at the top. The city lights were amazing, even now at 2 or 3 or whatever time it was – it seemed so alive. Harry blinked when Malfoy managed to conjure them halfway passable chairs and a little desk with two glasses. Then he returned his formerly shrunken suitcase to its full size and pulled another bottle of wine from its depths.
Finally, the elevator arrived. After a silent descent Roberts led the way towards the Atrium fireplaces, and one after the other, they called "Gringotts Bank" into the green fire.
"That one dies the moment it enters my soil. I'm not kind or naïve – there is no environment for it to grow."
Diagon Alley itself was nicely decorated with both Pagan symbols for Samhain and the scary pumpkins for Halloween. Harry walked much faster than he usually would.
"No drinks from outside! And how drunk are the two of you?" Before Harry could react, Malfoy had pulled out his wand and confunded the man.
Malfoy tsked and clunked their cups together belatedly, turning Harry's head to look into his eyes. "This is a first, Potter. You need to take it seriously. Also, our kind has restoration brews. We can drink as much as we like. Just go see a healer regularly!"
Harry swirled his wine, staring up at the sky. There were no stars, the tower and the rest of the city shining too brightly. But the many colours of the projectors made for a different kind of beauty.
Harry already knew it was going to make him throw up if it was leaving within the next twelve hours. He should really stop drinking soon. He was used to Butterbeer and maybe a few shots of Firewhiskey. Nothing more.
"Whatever," Malfoy said and turned. He paused, looked back at Harry as if he were going to say something more, but then just stalked away. He still wore those elegant form-fitting clothes Harry remembered from school. They must have cost more than Harry's entire wardrobe put together. It triggered pettiness Harry didn't know he was capable of.
"And what if Ron reacts negatively? This will end in a big dramatic fallout, which will be splashed all over the Daily Prophet tomorrow."
Ron stared at him open-mouthed and looked from Harry to Draco and back again, unable to get a sentence straight.
he wanted a friends-with-benefits arrangement because he was aromantic - that’s what he meant. I thought I could
"How's he doing?" Harry asked, with a glance at George. Ron met his eyes, and that was all Harry needed to know. Some wounds just healed very slowly.
Draco was now hard, the erection staining firmly against the soft cotton of his underwear. But he felt there was no time to strip. He quickly put his phone into a waterproof bag which hung on the shower wall (when Harry was away they liked to do facetime in the shower). Then he turned on the water.
"Hop on, Potter, we still have plans tonight." Harry decided to just blame anything that happened tonight on his low alcohol tolerance and cast a lightweight charm on himself before mounting Malfoy's back.
"No can do, Muggle Hagrid," he said and pulled Harry through the masses, into a secluded room where a few people were singing into a microphone. Malfoy vibrated as he waited his turn, then he giddily walked over to the DJ, who drew up his eyebrows but shrugged. Harry wanted to defend against it, but Malfoy pulled him all the way to the stage.
affairs," Gringok said. "We do business with whoever earns us money. The Malfoy vault belongs to the Malfoys. Unless the Ministry itself takes steps to prevent Draco Malfoy from accessing his vault – Gringotts surely will continue doing business with him."
"I could bloody carry you up there," Malfoy snorted with an air of complete certainty. Harry squinted at him, then shrugged.
Draco eased himself off the dildo and sat down on the couch next to Harry as Tom began redressing himself.
He intensely disliked being stuck in the elevator with all those other people wanting to talk to him. Thank Merlin for stairs.
Tom just eased him off Harry's cock nonchalantly and kissed along his neck. Then he slipped a hand inside his channel, lazily stroking Draco's walls and letting the come drips out and onto Harry's legs.
He listened anxiously for any Floo flaring when back at Tonks Cottage. Then the doorbell rang. Before Harry could get to his feet, Andromeda had already opened the door. Harry had sort of informed her that someone would come before they left for the party, but not who.
," Roberts said and slowly the wind coming from his wand created a cleared tunnel. Savage and Williamson crouched low, waiting for the attack, while Harry conjured up a shield over their group. Theoretically, they were only expecting Malfoy, but the goblins had lied to him before.
“I’ve wanted to play this for you anyway,” Draco said. He quickly sent Tom a message to take the backdoor to come inside, and then put the Speaker down next to Harry on the floor.
That evening he sat at his desk and stared down at the blank paper. He'd written a few drafts of this already, and it just wasn't getting any better.
"I told you already, Mr Malfoy. There is nothing we can do about your vault." Harry looked up. He had only just walked by the Accounting Department. It wasn't on his floor, but Harry visited all levels while making his way up to the Atrium.
“Don’t laugh at me,” Draco said, and threw one of his slippers at Harry only to regret it when his feet got cold. “I know I was full of myself, okay? But he was damn cool and my closeted gay heart was far too impressed.”
"Exactly!" Harry could not fathom what dumb principle that was. He could feel every sway of Malfoy's muscles moving under his legs. He again smelled the minty scent of his skin. His hair tickling his face. Harry noticed that Malfoy had changed his hairstyle quite a bit. It was now a bit longer and not full of hair gel. It suited him; looked very fluffy.
There were two things in the envelope. A small scrap of paper with a message, and a ticket for a one-way flight to Paris.
"My idiotic teenage crush on you." Draco sucked in air and chuckled. "But I just can't seem to do it properly. My weird fascination for you was always dirty, and sometimes hopeless and pathetic." He swallowed, and Harry didn't dare breathe. "So I thought that maybe just telling you, would help let it go. I tried it in Paris. And I tried while falling from the sky. And I tried in a cop car, but I just can't get it right. Can't let it go. So I just thought of telling the pitch instead, because it housed so many of my fantasies."
"Membership card, please," a fancy butler who wore a red tux and a black stovepipe hat, asked. Harry confunded him, feeling only slightly guilty. Of course this was a private casino. This was Malfoy.
"Gringok," Ragnok called loudly and another goblin, who seemed to be the head of the bank, made his way over. He walked at a comfortable pace like he had all the time in the world.
"A bit of fun," Tom replied. "I've never tried an arrangement with a couple. Now, I think I really missed out on something. So if you are interested in more kinky sex, I'm willing to introduce you to many new positions. My knowledge far extends dear Draco's. I have time on Sunday. I'd love to have you over."
Harry pushed past Roberts, who only gave him a warning glance, and snuck closer. Quietly – but hurried. Soon he reached Malfoy, who lay sprawled out among a couple of burned cups. Harry cast a basic health scan.
"Mate," Ron called from the kitchen when Harry entered the apartment above Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. "Wanna come to try the cake?" Harry smiled and walked into the kitchen to find Ron working on a carrot-orange cake. It had the size and form of a pumpkin, and a gruesome face was carved into its surface, fake blood dripping from sharp vampire teeth.
Harry shook his head and pulled Draco into a deep, sensual kiss. "As long as you still want to have romantic vanilla sex with me, I'm up for everything."
. Apparently, it was 7:23 am. He scrambled to his feet, checked that his shoes were indeed on his feet and his glasses on his nose, before running after Savage, clutching his wand tightly.
It was surreal seeing the lights of Paris for the first time, and Harry gazed out of the window. It was a bit awkward now that the limousine had come up.
"It's Muggle Aurors, Smith," Harry said, dryly. Draco had finally lifted his head, but his face was without emotions. Harry was sure he was about to sneer, and this would escalate unpleasantly.
Draco looked straight at Tom while he felt Harry's hands press into his asscheeks. It was almost painful, and Draco loved the feeling of Harry so close to losing control.
“I can say the same,” Harry said. “Heard your name before - but no idea what you do.” Draco stepped on his foot.
If it was this 'Saviour' nonsense, then he could just queue behind Harry and all his friends who were so done with the wizarding world acting like a mob.
Mostly because he was plagued with wet dreams and memories he thought he had long forgotten. Harry had football practice this afternoon, but Draco knew his schedule well enough to decide for both of them which day they had time.
He'd repaid his debts. Seeing Lucius sent off to Azkaban had been enough to satisfy his personal grudge. Harry trusted that Kingsley and the new Wizengamot passed fair judgement.
"Call me Andromeda. I'm still your aunt if you want me to be." At that, Harry stepped into the room and found Draco playing with Teddy on the floor, while Andromeda sat at the table watching them. Teddy was sporting Draco's white-blond hair and a pointy chin.
Even then they only moved up the stairs slowly, Malfoy sometimes wobbling under him, sighing from exhaustion. They made it past the first level.
The next morning when the bar closed down, Malfoy changed into different clothes in the loo – because, in comparison to Harry, he'd come prepared. When he returned, he simply handed Harry a sobriety and a hangover potion, and then they portkeyed back home.
"You had your head in the sand, didn't you? Everyone of age is allowed to leave as long as we ask for permission. We all came to the party." Harry looked around to find more and more of his former classmates among the crowd.
The ride went precisely as those in the Knight Bus did. It was a mix of apparating from street to street, landing on the wrong lane and then stretching to avoid other cars. When they finally arrived in front of the Leaky Cauldron, both Harry and Draco were sweaty and late.
"I still have a meeting in the evening," Tom said and flashed him a smile. "Business is a 24/7 job. But you are both delightful. I don't have time today, but I would love to have you over for a play session. I figure I have many toys you would enjoy. Although, I suppose we would have to talk some about hard limits and safewords before that." Tom took the tie off Harry's neck, leaving a red imprint behind. Draco trailed his fingers along the mark and raised an eyebrow at Harry who waved him off.
But Draco’s gaze was pinned on the mop of dark hair spread over a snow- white pillow on the fifth bed down, the lean curve of a sleeping back outlined softly by thick covers. He shook Zabini’s hand off absently, distractedly. The boy beside him was not his main concern. Without even looking around for Madam Pomfrey, who would butcher them if she found them disturbing Potter, he walked slowly over to the bed where he was sleeping, footsteps sure and soft. From where he was standing, only the clean outline of Potter’s nose and lashes were visible, his hair impossibly soft and wild over most of his face, cast into gold- black shadow as it was by the dappled sunrays streaming in from the enormous window over his head.
Draco took a deep breath in, trying not to just lose it and hit Potter. A particularly inviting expanse of pale skin, exposed by Potter’s loosened tie and open collar, beckoned him. Draco wanted to bruise it, maybe throw a punch or a jinx, or just
Harry gasped into Malfoy’s mouth as his hands slid over the curve of Harry’s bum, and he ground himself instinctively forwards, letting his neck bend backwards. Malfoy kissed him harder, deeper, never letting up and allowing him only snatches of breath between their lips. As Harry swayed backwards, head weighted by desire and legs weak, Malfoy chased him, holding him up with strong hands on his arse and waist. He was fucking everywhere, and Harry was starting to grind harder, unconsciously, completely lost in it.
At twelve thirty- nine, Draco was leaning against the wall of the corridor outside Professor McGonagall’s office, trying to look casual and unbothered.
Potter blinked. “Blaise?” His eyes peeked open, and he smiled briefly at Blaise, before his gaze slid – agonisingly drowsily – over to Draco. Immediately, a stream of emotions flashed over his face, too quickly for Draco to identify any of them. His eyebrows drew together finally, and when he spoke his voice was adorably bewildered.
Draco gulped, weighing up the situation. Shock and embarrassment sluiced through him like icy water, the syrupy thrum of his pulse picking up as he slowly regained his senses and the blur of arousal wore off somewhat. In his periphery, he could see Potter staring at the floor, his hair a mess and his tie askew. Draco didn’t need to look down to see that his own robes were badly mussed, the collar of his shirt rumpled, and he could feel a blush staining his cheeks, creeping across his neck.
Harry felt his brow furrow involuntarily, and he took another step, hands restless at his sides, wanting to reach out and touch.
, as such, Potter, but…” the tiny area of Ginny’s face that was visible to Harry flushed a deep, candy- apple red. “Yeah, I might be… seeing someone.”
He heard Malfoy snort from below, and it fuelled his cockiness; with a rashness that he hadn’t felt in, far, far too long,  he grinned at the ceiling and spoke, his voice lazy.
Sorry it ends pretty abruptly- I’m working on the continuation right now! Hope you all enjoyed it :)) (also by the way some errors in the formatting have been pointed out so if anyone spots any more please feel free to tell me as I think my software is glitching)
With a defiant squawk, the owl tightened its grip on the slim letter in its talons, tucked its wings in, and dropped to the ground with a dull thud audible even from inside the rosily warm kitchen. Draco leaned even further over the sink, peering painfully downwards at a precarious angle to see the owl lying prone on the tiny back lawn. He raked a hand through his thick blond hair, and turned to the other two.
“Forget it, Malfoy. Just… whatever. Go ahead.” Potter went around Draco, leaving a deliberately wide berth between them that stung Draco more than he cared to admit. He was too proud to go after the Gryffindor-
Chapped genetically, Pansy had informed him with a harried sigh. Apparently even she couldn’t smooth them out with all the products she’d smuggled from home—
Malfoy was climbing in, talking to the driver, one long leg still sprawled out of the door. Harry, sitting dazedly in the cab, tried to catch his breath, focus on something. The throbbing in his stomach did not abate, sharpened to something almost painful as he stared at Malfoy’s pink mouth, shaping words his brain slid over like so much impure water. He was jolted half- back to reality by the sound of Malfoy’s voice.
Blaise moaned, mouth stretched obscenely wide around a silver spoon heaped thickly with chocolate mousse. His tongue licked out and enveloped the creamy mass, delving into the rich depths of it and painting it around his mouth like one of those smug Renaissance bastards.
Weasley drew back, shoulders puffing out as he worked to think of something to say in return. Draco rolled his eyes and turned irritatedly back to the book, nerves wrung out from battling the potent effects of the smoke and this moron’s idiocy, because maybe Draco had said some stupid stuff - okay, a lot of stupid stuff - in sixth year, but everyone knew he hated failing at anything. Draco cared about school more than was comfortable, most days, but now that fierce desire to win was stumbling over the choking mist of steam the fucking potion was giving off, and the imbecile he’d been shoved with. It was just… too much.
"When I said that, mate, this wasn't what I expected," he said finally and pressed the glass into Harry's hand.
They were only in the air little more than one hour but because of the time difference it was 1:30 am by the time they stepped out of Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle.
Harry couldn't remember when he'd last had this much fun. Maybe in Sixth Year at a Quidditch game? Anyway, he wasn't giving this up any time soon.
together. Mostly Harry just hoped that Ron was better at changing diapers and making baby milk than he was.
“Draco?” Harry called from inside and footsteps approached. “Have you still not moved a single -” Harry fell quiet when he stepped outside.
Their mouths met with an easiness that made Harry tremble, and why had they ever argued, why had they ever shouted in hallways and glared and spat insults across classrooms when they could have been doing this, tongues sliding over one another with a wet, filthy friction that turned Harry to absolute jelly, and Draco was groaning into his mouth as his tongue ghosted over Harry’s lower lip, licked into his mouth like he was devouring him. Maybe he was. They were melting into each other, Harry’s hands sliding up to tangle in Draco’s hair- fucking God, it was so soft- and both of Malfoy’s hands were on his back now, moving lower and lower, pressing them together as their mouths moved over each other fiercely.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
“Okay, then,” he said, and his voice was finally laced with something like confidence. Suddenly, didn’t feel like he had to prove anything, and he smirked at Malfoy, waiting for the reaction as he brought his hands up behind his head and tipped his gaze back languidly, mirroring what the other man had done earlier.
“I shouldn’t have needed to,” Potter bit back, and Draco was unreasonably pleased by the flush of colour on the other boy’s pale cheeks.
Draco met her eyes, throat rough from alcohol. His head swam, and he nodded once, jerkily, hardly believing what he was agreeing to. His legs felt shaky as he stood up, fabric clinging tightly to his lean thighs and fingers coming down to fiddle with the material of his shirt. He slid his chair back, moving out from behind it so slowly he felt like he’d been hit with a drugging spell. His blood thumped sluggishly in his ears, pulse a fluttering beat that he could feel like the panicked roll of a drum. His eyes were fixed on the wooden- panelled floor.
Pansy slid three large, embossed tickets out of her pocket and fanned herself with them nonchalantly, mouth twisted up in a wry smile.
Now, McGonagall was simply regarding them sternly over the rims of her rectangular lorgnettes; Draco was sure it was a trick she’d learned from Dumbledore. It still made him itchy under the collar, the nape of his neck prickling with the memory of those wise, blue eyes on him.
The other boy flushed, pinkish colour spreading down his neck and disappearing under his jumper. It was a very noticeable tinge on his lily- white skin, and Draco raised his eyebrows.
Draco thought. He felt stuck, unable to move forward or think around the maelstrom in his head. It expanded with every breath, taking up every single brain cell until he couldn’t imagine thinking of anything different.
Potter nodded enthusiastically. “And, you know, I was the one who brought you in here. You can always blame me, yeah? I don’t mind.”
Harry twisted sharply to stare over his shoulder, suddenly paranoid. What if someone was watching him? What if they’d seen him going into the bathroom, and set up an Extendable Ear, or they were wearing an Invisibility Cloak, or, or—
The back stiffened, shoulders tensing even more than before, and a hand reflexively shot up to his hair, fingers spreading and raking reflexively.
Zabini sighed. “Well, he’s in the hospital wing. I was checking because...” he gnawed on his thumbnail, and Draco was taken aback by the endearing look of it. “I thought he’d be back by now. He’s just… I mean, normally… I mean…”
*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Sheer, unadulterated excitement started to pulse in his veins, mixing in with the heavy tangles of desire and want, creating something rather like a time bomb. He felt like he was about to explode, but remained upright, jealously bringing Potter closer and closer to his body until his hair- smelling irresistibly of warm apple and musky boy- was tickling his nose, tipped down as it was. They started up the stairs, Potter moving slightly more independently now, but head still burrowed deep into Draco’s black shirt, hot breath stirring over his nipples, keeping him electrified. To stir things up, as they reached the top of the staircase, Draco decided to play with Potter a little. No reason to give him an easy time of it, just because he was suddenly so edibly…
A particularly well- aimed jab from the knife inside Draco’s head made him hack into the sleeve of his robes. Zabini recoiled, looking disgusted in an aristocratic sort of way that made Draco long to punch him. He gritted his teeth, trying to stay lucid.
“If I’m thanking anything, it’s the boots,” he muttered, and Harry laughed outright, nodding slowly.
“Well, I met a girl there,” Ginny continued, and Harry could see she was trying to stay impassive, but her pink lips twitched up indomitably, and a slight blush crept up her neck, staining the pale skin.
Draco had no time to blink, or even to put down the mug he was holding, half- filled with milk and a dark teabag that was fast staining the creamy pale milk iron coloured. The contents of the mug splashed onto the onyx carpet below their feet and dampened it as Theo crashed into Draco, slamming him into a wall with his momentum and holding the bony tip of his wand to Draco’s throat.
Zabini scoffed. “Who else had inside information on the most underground, secret stuff the Death Eaters did? Who else has been trying to clear his name with the bloody Ministry ever since they basically put his father
Draco cleared his throat, and Potter threw a half- glance at him. It was enough to make his stomach tighten, hopelessly, foolishly. Draco narrowly avoided hiding his face in his hands, stifling the Lucius Voice before it could comment.
The small living room of the Burrow was pervaded by a comfortable sense of sharing and vulnerability and sunlight, the musty smell of dust dancing in the beams that poured through the window. The four of them sat there for a minute, before Ginny turned her head slowly to the side facing Harry, and said, “What about you?”
By the time he’d settled himself on Potter’s left, Zabini had come up on his other side. He and Draco scowled across the table at one another, textbook lying forgotten in the middle. Potter was a distractingly warm presence to Draco’s right, flushed cheeks split in a smirk, eyes flicking over Draco and Zabini. Draco was pretty sure he had his tie loosened, shirtsleeves pushed up in a way that Draco refused-
From behind their napkins and hands, under the pretence of smoothing back hair or checking lapels, sipping water, dropping cutlery or dabbing at their mouths with the linen cloths, they found countless ways to watch the couple, who were undoubtedly on a date.
“Close your mouth, boy, you look as though somebody had fed you a bad Pepper- Up Potion.” Warren winced, tail thrashing as though independent from his upper body.
Draco sighed, slouching lower in the chair and spreading his legs wider. He couldn’t think of anything, couldn’t get past the whirlwind of thoughts and emotions and new fucking information. God, so much had happened since he last wrote to Pansy. He didn’t know how to begin to explain it all.
Before Draco could get a word out, Potter was holding up a hand, still coughing- rather dramatically, Draco thought. “Jesus, Malfoy,” he gasped. “Do you always round corners at that pace?”
“Exactly!” Draco said irritatedly. “We’re the only ones whose opinions he can trust. And I say,” he tapped his foot on the floor in emphasis, “it’s disgusting.”
Pansy sighed, swallowing, and sat down in her previously vacated chair. The amusement on her face gave way to a more serious expression, brows pulling together and teeth slipping down to nibble on her lip. She tucked her feet underneath her, and her hands came up reflexively to clutch at her elbows. Draco felt an overpowering protectiveness rush over him; he took a step towards her.
Nott’s head whipped up, and he stared at him for a heavy second, before nodding, a hysterical laugh escaping him. His wand, which had hung limply by his side, raised, and Draco stepped back on instinct. Nott flicked him a glance and smiled, amused.
Potter seated himself comfortably in one of the armchairs, facing the fire slightly so that the warmth radiated towards him. He looked up at Draco, expectant, and Draco sighed, holding back a curse. He sat in the other armchair, and tried to look remotely relaxed.
Instead, he scowled. “Mind—” he broke off to choke a little, and it completely ruined his mojo. He swallowed. “Mind releasing me, Potter?”
It felt like a riddle. It sounded like a riddle. But, taking one look at Zabini’s disbelieving face, Draco felt like maybe the truth was staring him right in the face. This wasn’t some ambiguous code he had to crack. This was an observation Zabini had made about Draco.
The hallway had narrowed considerably by now- Draco double checked to make sure the walls weren’t just fucked up from the alcohol, and just about ascertained that it was not the Firewhisky. That meant he’d gone too far. The corridor was wider at the beginning- he should go back. He turned, swaying alarmingly, and spotted a smallish wooden door set in a deep cranny in the wall, almost at the beginning of the hallway.
Ron stiffened. “What House was she in?” He asked immediately, and his voice was strained. A muscle in Ginny’s delicate jaw ticked.
, and so is this girl I like! And so help me god, Ronald, you will be sweet and nice to her, or I will never get you Finals tickets again.”
Draco’s lips parted slightly, and he felt the urge to say something, confess the feelings swelling up in his chest like a wave boiling to smash against the shore, but Potter released him then, stepping back as though he thought he’d crossed a line, somehow.
His first thought tumbled, choked off, out of his mouth before he’d even had the chance to fully form it.
Who was going to want to date him? Who in the seven hells would ever even consider him like that? He was nobody at this school—worse than that. He was scum. He couldn’t put himself on a ridiculous dreg of hope, some fantastical dream that
It was with a shuddery exhale that he turned to the front of Grimmauld Place, closed his eyes, and visualised the house. And then, with a great rumbling slide of bricks, numbers thirteen and eleven were shunting aside, and number twelve bloomed in the middle, stones somehow more weathered- looking than the rest.
“Iwenht’meesmonefrmWishWeekli!” Pansy gabbled in one nervous, incomprehensible breath. She paused, and looked at them anxiously for a reaction.
Yeah, this is pretty much a trend by now so you probably all know what to expect- very little action, a coincidentally large amount of feels (it always happens by accident, dear lord) and furthering of character relationships. Enjoy, I guess? Happy reading, folks. Or not. It might be crappy :))
“No problem,” Theo replied quickly, giving Draco an almost motherly little smile and taking a seat once he’d slipped behind his desk and into his chair by the windows.
“Shall we?” He gestured to the entrance to McGonagall’s office, pushing himself up off the wall and grabbing Potter’s bag from their feet. He offered it to the other boy by the strap, and Potter stared at him for a second before accepting. Their knuckles brushed as the bag slid onto Potter’s shoulder, a fleeting graze of skin, and Draco clenched his stomach not to inhale sharply.
Soothingly, Pansy looked just as discomfited. She kept shifting, tugging at her collar and rolling her shoulders like they were too big for her, somehow. As though she wanted to shuck off the extra pounds of muscle and bone that rendered her lean and broad and hard- edged. Theo’s jaw was particularly sharp, too, the lines of his throat spare and long, and every time Pansy turned her head her brow would furrow slightly, as though she wasn’t used to being able to turn that far. It was hilarious. Now Draco was aware of the situation, he loved watching her struggle discreetly, and though he’d die before admitting it, a secret well of warmth always spread through him at the thought that she was enduring it all for him.
Potter sat up quickly, reaching for his glasses on his bedside table and putting them on hastily. As his vision must have sharpened, Draco saw his brain click into gear and start obfuscating, although rather sleepily.
Draco peered out from under the arches of the courtyard at the grounds, obscured thickly by pounding sheets of rain that slickened grass and stone alike. He grimaced, and cast a surreptitious Shield Charm, body enveloped in a softly glowing bubble that would hopefully protect him from the relentless weather. He took a breath, and ducked out from the cover, into the maelstrom of wind and rain.
“Nah, I like having a nice haze on me before the meal starts. Helps me when I try and figure people out.”
Well, that just ruined everything. Trust fucking Potter to have a Saviour complex big enough to actually encompass Draco. It made him want to retch, and cry, and write about seven more letters to Pansy, because his cursive was getting sloppy. Lucius would not approve.
Draco bit his lip, hard, and summoned the steel to turn sneeringly to his right. He opened his mouth, eyes half- lidded, to say something lazy along the lines of,
At the moment, however, Draco was fighting a raging headache, battling his way through the treacle- thick crowds on the way to Double Charms, NEWT level. What fun. He heaved his bag over his shoulder, tugging the strap closer to him and frowning hard. The pulses of pain right behind his eyes made it hard to concentrate on anything- the pushing, yelling mass of students surrounding him in the wide corridor blurred together into a single vicious body determined to split his head in two. He pressed the heel of his hand into his right eye, gripping his hair tightly and trying to regain some clarity. Draco didn’t realise he’d slowed down dramatically until a kid nearly collapsed his kidney with a bony elbow to the back, having stumbled right into him and tried to carry on sprinting as though there wasn’t a blonde, six foot Eighth Year standing directly in front of him. Draco groaned, clapping his hand to the meat of his back and speeding up, nearly buckled over in bewildered pain. By the time he’d gotten a few metres further, he found that he could barely see from the cleaving, white- hot knife behind his eyes. He stumbled, blinked, and jerked as a light hand gripped the crook of his right arm, steering him into the nearest corridor on the left and then through a large, narrow door bearing the number ‘347’ on it in dull gilt- his Charms classroom. He peered to his right.
“Come on. I’ve already done all the furniture. There are only your novels and your insane amount of clothes left. I’ll take the books.” Harry walked down the three stairs and lifted one of the smaller boxes with a grunt. “The clothes aren’t heavy. And you know, your father hates me. His hired labour would have set up traps in our bathroom or something.”
Only Hermione continued to bear the insults and impoliteness when returning over and over again. She wanted to determine where their world discriminated against all the other species. It was part of a big revolution which only existed in her brain at the moment.
Once Harry had taken the rolled-up letter from its leg, it took off without waiting for a response. Harry looked down at the white paper, unable to open it. Finally, when he heard Ron ramble back up the stairs, he ripped it, while looking away.
"There you are," Andromeda said and smiled at him. "I almost thought you weren't coming today. We're having soufflé. It's still in the oven. You'll find some jeans in Dora's room."
Then Harry pressed a kiss to his pucker. Draco loved rimming, but it was something he’d only discovered with Harry because no lover before had offered to do it. And he had never quite felt brave enough to ask. Harry did it like he did everything: passionate and with disregard to his own pleasure.
He vaguely realised that Harry’s towel loosened and fell to the floor, as they kissed. Draco loved the feeling of being in control, as he buried his hands in Harry’s hair, pulling strongly, which caused Harry’s breath to catch.
"No," he said and quickly folded the map in half. Ron stood behind him, Teddy in his arms who was sucking aggressively on his dummy.
"Thank you for your trust in this institution." Ragnok sneered. "The alarm didn't go off because there was a break-in. The customer started a fire – in his vault."
"There's something in Paris I have to take care of. I just thought you'd be interested in joining me. Not that you interpret it as me fleeing the country."
Draco had written him a letter yesterday. He had their costumes figured out and would come to pick up Harry in the evening. And whether Harry was really sure that they should go to the Halloween party together?
"Did we come to Paris to drink?" Harry asked as he let himself fall into his chair. Malfoy just stood silently for many moments before he returned his eyes to Harry. He handed him a glass of wine.
"Aren't you handsome," Andromeda said as he came back downstairs. Somehow she always managed to have the clothes fit perfectly, and Harry felt himself blush. He didn't hear that often – at least this quietly and genuine.
Harry narrowed his eyes. Malfoy nonchalantly sorted his chips while the dealer changed. He sipped smugly on his wine between every new tower he built.
When he'd sent it away, he looked at the photograph of his parents. He sometimes wondered what they would say to all these new developments in his life. He'd talked extensively at Teddy whose only reply had been a hand on the cheek and drool on his shoulder.
They crept forwards until they reached the vault door, which was nearly shut. When Roberts pulled it open, another cloud of smoke surrounded them. There was a flash of light, and then it was dark in the vault. Someone breathed heavily at the other end of the room.
"Well, but the Muggles don't know that, do they? You're talking like you've never abused their innocence before."
"Yes. With the two cups in the vault, I said goodbye to the time with the Dark Lord and all involved. I sadly cannot burn the Dark Mark from my skin." Harry saw him visibly swallow. "With the manor, I tried to get rid of the craving for my father's approval. In the beginning, I was in a headspace where I just wanted to burn it to the ground, but I would have regretted that. Like this, it might do some good. And it still represents the family history I used to be so proud of. But now all that pride is something dirty and twisted, and I hope that there might be a time in my life when I can get some of it back."
"I would like to move back sometime in the future, but I think for me to feel comfortable here, I will have to bring in a few specialists who will change this house significantly. I just wanted to ask you whether that would be okay with you. Everything you want to keep, you can have. But there are just things which will have to go." He thought about those house-elf heads. And a few walls.
Goblins were running around, screaming at each other in Gobbledegook. A loud alarm was ringing in the background. Somehow the fire-detection spells had been set off, and it was raining onto the black tiles of the floor. The few customers still inside had rain-repelling charms up and were cowering in a corner, glancing around in panic.
After he sent it, he lay awake for a long time, thinking about whether that had been a risky letter or not. And why those words felt so odd. His life was weird right now. He jumped out of his bed and opened the window as soon as Draco's owl arrived a little later.
"Cissy? I'm far from forgiveness, Harry." Andromeda sipped on her tea as she turned another page in her book. Her atmosphere was always one of complete calm.
"Not everyone is a chicken like you, Ronnykins. We will also make your pumpkin cakes say creepy things and laugh evilly. Fred and I taped parts of Voldemort's high-pitched laugh back in the day. They will be frightened for their lives." Ron shivered and looked at Harry for support. Harry shrugged – this was George's way of coping. It was okay if he got better at the expense of the magical community.
With a last sigh, Harry got into the back. If Malfoy was dosed with Felix, this would be weird for the foreseeable future. Nothing could be done about that.
Ron sighed and let George do what he wanted to. There was still candy in the oven and many colourful doughs in a few bowls around the room.
Harry searched Malfoy’s face for a trace of that blonde boy he’d met outside the Great Hall. His face was still expressive, still pale, but somehow matured, effortlessly lovely now. He’d grown into his eyes, too, Harry thought. Where they’d been enormous in school, grey and haunted, now they fit his face, elegantly cool.
She broke off with a sudden laugh like a streak of silver, darting through the air too quick to savour.
Ginny stalked over to his wardrobe, doors akimbo and a slew of shirts sliding out over one another, various colours starkly contrasting. She ran a finger over the hangers, looking at him with a furrowed brow, and hooked a practiced hand around a hanger, withdrawing a black Yves Saint Laurent shirt, polka dotted with tiny white speckles. It was loose and silky, slipping over the metal hanger like water.
“Then what?” Weasley demanded, doing up the final buckle on his bag. “You haven’t told me what happened to spook you, mate, and until you do I can’t help you. It’s not adding up for me, and Sea doesn’t know what to do. He’s hurt.”
Draco was startled back to reality by Pansy, looking at him strangely. He felt her eyes on him, gaze uncommonly soft and femininely discerning.
“Think he’s just hurt, mate,” Weasley muttered, homework timetable in hand. “I don’t think it was really about what happened when….”
Draco had half been expecting it to be in slow- motion, like one of those old Muggle films, but it wasn’t, and it was far too quick for him to adjust, and all of a sudden he was staring at the twenty- year old face of his schoolboy crush.
Zabini’s lip curled, and something of the glacial, savage- eyed boy Draco had been faced with for the past term returned. “No need to sound quite so jealous, Malfoy. At least we can look each other in the eye. You and Potter can barely sit next to each other without coming in your pants or storming out. It’s pretty pathetic, actually.”
, though Draco could not fathom what. It was incredibly unlike Theo to ever lose his temper, as far as he could tell.
Harry stepped inside, feet ginger, and the carpet exhaled a puff of dust. He sincerely hoped the house was not in as bad a state as it had been the summer before their fifth year. He suppressed a shudder. Now Kreacher had died… he didn’t like to think what kinds of ruin the house had fallen into.
Potter straightened his white shirt, rumpled as it was, and a stray tendril of hair like ebony silk brushed the cotton collar, curling above it. The bare skin of his neck, pulse unblemished and creamy, was so vulnerable that Draco looked away, at Finnigan, which also turned out to be a mistake, as the stupid bloody Irishman was looking at Potter with this endeared little smile on his face, and Draco could feel his blood-- free of alcohol and renewed in vigour-- rush to his head. He clenched his jaw, looked back at Potter, staring him straight in the eye.
Potter, and it was driving Draco crazy. Just these soft, barely- noticeable brushes and steers that spoke of an intimacy so sacred Draco wanted to burn it to the ground. A gentle hand on Potter’s hip, a pretentious stroke of the cheek when there was no ink on there and everyone knew it, a laugh that saw them lean close to each other, so close that Draco’s heart started to cook itself in a boiling froth of white rage.
underfoot as layers of sugary alcohol clung to the leathery heels.  Harry grimaced, needing the toilet more desperately than ever. A chilly stream of air conditioning slipped under the gaping collar of his shirt, and goosebumps prickled to life on the skin of his chest, a smattering of tiny bumps spreading steadily downwards until his stomach was tingling and cold. Harry increased his pace, striding down the dimly lit passageway until he came to a fork in the corridor. He peered to the right; a faint silver ‘Wizards’ sign glinted on a dark- painted door.
Weasley opened his mouth, a mulish smile playing around his lips. Draco braced himself, looking back at him coldly. Just as he was sure something idiotic was going to come out of the Weasel’s mouth, a lazy voice came from behind Draco.
“Yeah, of course!” Harry said, while Hermione nodded heartily in the background. “Why wouldn’t we… what makes you think we wouldn’t? Be nice, that is?”
And Malfoy groaned, half- aroused, half- mocking. Harry surged back into him, their chests pressing together, Malfoy’s hands desperate in his hair, squeezing over his hips, his stomach…
Draco set a brisk pace, heading out through the courtyard and into the grounds. The corridors were pretty empty, most students still finishing breakfast, and he was relieved not to have to keep his head down as he took a sharp right out of the stone arches of the courtyard and onto the dewy grounds. He was careful not to stray onto the grass, treading precisely on the gravel path all the way down to the Quidditch pitch, morning air whipping blood into the apples of his cheeks. Faintly, he could make out several sets of wasp- yellow and black robes fluttering in the breeze as he approached the changing rooms, and a procession of Hufflepuff players made their way up to the castle in the opposite direction, backs to Draco as he came ever closer to the building they had just vacated.
The common room was cold, last embers of the fire sputtering and glowing feebly in the chill iron grate. Draco stared at them detachedly, eyes faraway and distracted. It was late in the afternoon- he’d missed dinner, and his stomach groaned, curling in on itself wretchedly. However, it soon resigned itself to emptiness for the night, and quieted down. Draco was in no position to allay its silent suffering; his mind was spinning with possibilities, questions, and sparks of agitated magic.
It hit him like the Hogwarts Express; the memory of searing flame licking high just below him, waves of intense heat rolling up and soaking his shirt with sweat, pasting his hair to the nape of his neck. Hands like vices around whatever pieces of crap he could find a grip on; fingers sliding and straining, hauling himself higher on the precarious tower of rubbish collected in that accursed Room. Potter, a sleek, dark- haired arrow, soaring towards him, bent low over the broom. His eyes had burned into Draco’s, and even with unadulterated terror pounding through his veins Draco had been arrested by their intensity. He’d reached a hand up, clawing at the hot, thick air, fear a tangible taste in the very breaths he drew in.
Weaslette stared at him, lips pursed, and turned to look at Potter, raising her eyebrow not unkindly.
. But he’d had to ruin Draco for anyone else too. And Draco was ruined, of that he was sure. In so many ways, but he was becoming increasingly certain that this was the worst. Because what was there without Harry Potter? What could there ever be? He couldn’t move past this boy. He was ruined for anyone else.
****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Draco froze. Very slowly, he pushed Theo away from him and stood by himself, refusing to lean against the wall though suddenly his knees felt very weak. “How do you know about that leaflet?”
Harry and Hermione sat frozen as Ron extended his arms, and Ginny went into them considerably more agreeably than she did most things. The two fiery heads bent together, and Ginny’s long, strong limbs wrapped tight around Ron’s lanky bulk.
“Sorry, right, so- Harry. I’ve made some of that oatmeal you like, so I guess that’ll be fine? You boys leave your wands up here; Ron, your mum didn’t like wands at the table and neither do I.”
Potter clenched his jaw. “Stop being a child, Malfoy,” he shot back, but turned almost beseechingly to Zabini anyway.
Some weird as hell discoveries, the birthing of some new plot threads, and not even that much real action...but, like, angst? *insert Valley Girl voice* Also, I invented a Tipsy Jinx because, well, I can, and frankly it sounds so fun. Please comment and leave kudos and don't shred my heart to pieces.
He’d hoped Hermione would drop the whole oatmeal thing, but she was clearly convinced that they were both such fans of it they never wanted to eat anything different for breakfast ever again.
Ron looked as though he were undergoing a particularly painful internal struggle. He flushed, looking from Harry to Hermione with increasing desperation, and only broke when
Draco remembered helplessly- whispering over his ear.  Days had gone by, and Draco had been normal. Steadfastly normal. Nothing had changed, not that he knew of, anyway, and if he resolutely didn’t look when a certain scruffy dark head ducked into the hallways, well- who’d noticed?
Ginny’s eyes narrowed. “I’ll let that go, Granger, since you’re carrying Weasley spawn, but you might want to be careful. I’ll take any further slights out on the Golden Boy here.”
“Stalked her for a month, yes, you keep saying that,” Pansy snapped. “Look, you both see to have forgotten that the reason I followed this girl around for a bit—”
Draco nodded, impatient. “So you met up…?” he asked, desperately attempting to disguise the hungry tone of his voice.
,’ he thought sadly, and shoved the thought away. He wouldn’t be self- pitying. Anyway, it wasn’t that bad, was it? It was just that he hadn’t been out much lately, and the date had gone so wrong, and it was late, so late—he cast a quick wandless
Faintly, Draco sensed Potter shift his bag from one shoulder to the other and turn to him. Before he knew it, there was a hand on the arm of his robes, gripping him tight. He looked up to see Potter holding him, eyes urgent.
Draco’s hand tightened on his forearm angrily, and with an immediacy that slackened Draco’s mouth, Potter’s lashes fluttered down. The movement looked almost reflexive, his lips parting on a sharp inhale. His body, wrapped around the seat, went utterly pliant and his legs spread unconsciously to shift his pelvis even closer to the back of the chair, pressing up against it obscenely.
“No?” Draco said, leaning in, pulse a sudden throb in his wrists and throat. “Then what is it, oh Saviour? Enlighten me, please. What is this school, if not biased and prejudiced and fucking unforgiving?”
Ron looked sheepish. “Sorry. It’s just…” he lowered his voice. “Hermione’s getting cranky. She says she reckons you sleep in to annoy her, and its unfair for us to expect her to make breakfast and have it ready for whenever we deign to grace her with our presences.”
“Well, I don’t know…” Potter’s brow furrowed, as he stroked his chin in mock- thought. “You were the one speeding through the corridors at breakneck speed.”
McGonagall nodded. “Thank you for coming to see me. I hope, Mr Potter,” she raised her voice not unkindly, flicking a pointed brow at Potter. “You might learn to differentiate between ‘emergency’ and ‘showboating.’”
“Since the last couple years of school,” Harry replied, trying to keep his voice steady. He shrugged, falsely nonchalant. “Longer, maybe.”
Draco’s mouth was suddenly very dry. He half- turned to Pansy and Blaise, a screaming question in his eyes.
“I’m more likely to side with Draco’s pretty face than yours, though, aren’t I, Pans? That proves that this isn’t about that. I was just saying it was a little hypocritical of Draco to give you a hard time.” Blaise paused, and his smile became wolfish, teeth gleaming and dimple crooking. “Doesn’t mean I can’t though.”
“Fine, fine, fine!” Harry clapped his hands over his face. “Just, Godric, will ether of you be of any help? What shirt should I wear?”
Harry looked up at him, hair falling over his eyes as he licked his bottom lip, slow and deliberate.
Draco gave an awkward wave of his hands and wanted to Avada himself. “Nothing, I—nothing? You just looked… sad.”
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
Pansy looked slightly mollified. As the boys slid off the table and back into their respective seats, she sat down again, fingers still gripping the tickets tightly.
Blaise had gotten there before him; he loved watching other people, analysing and deducting, and he had a good target all ready to go.
Ginny swallowed a mouthful of oaty sludge, shuddering silently and wiping a tear from under her left eye when Hermione wasn’t looking. “Well, there’s a massive crowd of fans outside the block. Normally they’re more manageable, but now the Cup final’s coming up,” she shook her head. “Mental.”
“Lucky for you,” the ginger growled, shoving his textbook in next to his potions kit. “I was holding back.”
With a slow, dragging precision, Malfoy turned his head to the side, his profile lit by the weak streetlight- glow from the kitchen window.
It wasn’t in too bad a state, shockingly. The coppery shine of the pots and pans hanging from the ceiling wasn’t dulled, just thickened by faint tangles of cobwebs, downy- soft and catching the light slightly. The table was thick with dust, though, and Harry didn’t want to even breathe near it. A layer like that would be enough to give anyone asthma.
The corner of Zabini’s mouth flicked up, and a dimple Draco had never seen before pressed itself obscenely deep into his glossy cheek. Draco watched for a second, pleasantly surprised at the entirely different look of the other boy’s face, and then shook his head minutely, smile still fixed to his face.
(Pansy’s Plan, mainly, but he’d annexed it because as far as he could tell it was the best shot he had.)
Zabini looked murderous, but he stayed where he was, throwing a glance at Potter. It infuriated Draco, whatever this secret thing was between them, and he swallowed hard, chewing on solid, writhing jealousy.
the Lucius Voice murmured disappointedly, and, oh goody, it was back, and Draco would not be maudlin, not with his father’s voice in his head.
. Draco.” Or, “Draco Malfoy, if you think for one minute I’m going to lend you my Charms notes you have a second think coming. At least get out your quill and try to look like you’re listening. No, I don’t care if Crabbe’s not paying attention. If he fails, that isn’t my problem.”
“Tuck it in a bit, but loosely,” Ginny instructed, prowling around Harry as he slipped the button- up over his head. “Undo a button.”
He couldn’t bring himself to draw it out; careless of his robes stroking over the damp walls, he spun to face the wall.
“That makes no difference, Ron! Godric, can’t you just let go of what happened? They’ve all fucking made amends. Slytherins have been dragged in and out of the Wizengamot’s Court a thousand times since the end of the war. Every single one of them has paid their dues, sometimes when they didn’t even need to. They don’t need you giving them shit for stuff they’ve already done penance for! Let go of your outdated conviction that Slytherin is bad, Slytherin is evil. They’re
Draco leaned in, so close now, so close he could have bumped their noses together, just edged down to close the tiny gap between their lips. “That’s not a fucking secret. And you know what? It pains me to be here. It pains me to be near you, and your
“I did them over the summer. Low point. The only reason the bandages are still on is because they were touched by magic when they were still raw. Muggle blade, magical concealment charms. So while they heal, they’re bandaged. Okay?”
--softened Draco. It was ludicrous, and frankly unfair besides. Potter already had so much. He already had
It also did not help that the classroom was packed with students, unlike most of Draco’s other NEWT classes, and it was horribly hot, the air stifling and unpleasant. Draco had been put near the back- advantage of having a surname starting with ‘M’, but unfortunately ‘M’ was also very close to ‘P’, and with that came issues.
Theo looked down, and then up, gaze roving over their beds as if searching for an answer amongst the rumpled bedsheets.
“If you want, Draco,” Pansy said accommodatingly, “I can claim that part of the house. So the imperfection isn’t part of your bit.”
Malfoy’s lips curled upwards, still looking out at the window. “Of course there’ll be one, Potter. There’ll be one for you. The universe wouldn’t let the Golden Boy go without a soulmate.”
McGonagall eyed them shrewdly, glasses glinting in the bright light from above her desk. She was sitting, now; they’d moved over to her desk about three minutes ago, when Draco had gotten around to explaining about the reason for their visit- the friendly Quidditch match. The five minutes previously had been devoted to stuttering half- truths as to why he and Potter had ended up pressed together, centimetres away from snogging and half- hard against her fireplace. Draco had been horribly paranoid the whole time that
do. We’re all adults, we’re living our lives—who says we even have to acknowledge him? We went to the same school; that’s it.”
The dark- haired man interrupted, voice considerably quieter and more reasonable. Draco could just about make out his words anyway; the restaurant had quieted, people staring shamelessly at the spectacle.
“Take a shot every time that dude,” he jerked his head over to a nearby table where a guy in a vintage- looking sheer shirt and trousers was sitting opposite a dark- haired young man with his back to them, “flicks his hair off his forehead flirtatiously.”
Malfoy nosed closer to Harry’s cock, warm breath hitting him through the fabric of his boxers, and Harry actually trembled at the sensation. God, how was he meant to survive this?
“Yeah, I know.” Pansy grimaced, but they could both see the very Slytherin smirk tugging at her lips.
It was small things at first, the sharp angle of his straight nose dipping so that it was curved and slightly pointed upwards into a fine tip, the freckled expanse of his cheeks creaming over into high cheekbones and flawless skin. His lashes thickened and curled, flicking upwards from their straight, short line.
“Fuck it all out.” Blaise ploughed on as though he hasn’t spoken. “Works every time. Trust me. Just go over there, sit your pretty arse down, give him a smile and a patented sneer in quick succession, and he’s putty in your hands. You’re dressed to pull, anyway.” He gestured to Draco’s fitted suit trousers—they clung to his arse almost criminally well—and stark black shirt that brought out the clean pale lines of his throat. “It’s all in the stars! Just go, get it out of your system, and come back Potter- free. Let’s face it, we all know he’s been your only real wank material for years. Maybe it’s time you…” he raised his eyebrows delicately. “I don’t know. Move on?”
Theo jabbed the tip of the wand deeper into Draco’s sternum, and he hacked in response. The pressure of the wand felt somehow non- threatening, though Draco knew it could do serious damage. In fact, this whole thing felt like a sort of emotional response, a desperate ploy for
“Draco…” he breathed in a soft voice. Draco, feverishly gasping for breath, dimly registered this as strange for somebody who barely knew him.
“She made me come with her,” Malfoy gritted out. “To pay it a visit. I didn’t recognise it before… the way it revealed itself reminded me… I just remembered.”
. The same way he just couldn’t stop jiggling his leg under the table, despite how it had begun to throb and pulse with uncontrollable adrenaline. The same way he just couldn’t shift on his seat so his arse was slightly less tensed and his stomach less compressed. He was paralysed by an invisible hand that clamped down over his nostrils and squeezed, a silent weight that pressed on his chest and suffocated him, a spectral something that made his pulse flutter in erratic little bursts like the wings of a butterfly.
“Mr Malfoy.” Draco made an effort to look sorry, but McGonagall seemed uninclined to reprimand him. Amazed, Draco had to remind himself that the idiot had thrown food at him.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “Look, you have an attractive chest. Just because I like girls doesn’t mean I don’t know what makes men look good. You don’t have chest hair, you’re pretty buff but still got that kinda lean preppy thing going on, and the shirt suits your skin tone. Trust me.”
“Godric, Malfoy,” Potter said in his ear, and that was enough to make him tense all over, the hum spreading over the nape of his neck, which was exposed and vulnerable. He could feel Potter’ warm breath, and he wanted to spin around and kiss him hard enough to bruise, run his hands all over him, bury his fingers in the dark hair he could feel tickling his ear. His arms were held tightly, so fucking tightly, and he wanted to writhe a bit, test the limits.
Hope everyone enjoyed it! Please leave feedback etc- I'm tired as hell right now and my eyes are literally sliding shut so I'll be back in the morning. Peace out lovelies :))
So Draco tucked his legs up underneath him on the battered leather of the couch, socked feet curling in, as the faint drumming of rain on the lake echoed down through gallons of darkened water, drifting through the thick panes of the common room’s underwater windows and lulling his eyes half- shut. He sighed quietly, magic still sparking in his mind’s eye, and fell asleep as the last embers in the grate went out.
They were practicing Lucidity Charms, simple enough, but requiring a basic level of calm and mental control that Draco was dubious as to any of them possessing at the present time. Indeed, across the room, Longbottom, Bones and Finch- Fletchley seemed to be having better luck, all of them staying remarkably clear- headed after casting Confundus Charms and Tipsy Jinxes on each other.
Hermione shifted upwards on the sofa, brown eyes soft and intent on Ginny. Ron, on the other hand, was watching Hermione’s face with a tenderness mirrored in his gentle grip on her hand, the way their fingers twined together easily, thoughtlessly.
If anything, he wanted to punch Longbottom even more as he clung to Potter, talking to him for indecently long period of time for two people in different groups.
Ginny nodded. “Not patent. Get a pair of lace-ups, preferably with a bit of a heel on them. Helps to pull off skinnies.” She raked a disturbingly clinical gaze over Harry, who felt only mildly violated. “You’ve got good legs, Golden Boy. Show ’em off.”
McGonagall’s tiny smirk grew exponentially as her eyes flashed for a moment towards Draco. “It is a crucial distinction, no matter whom you may wish to impress.”
From across the large wooden table they threw themselves towards Pansy, who was already giggling and slipping out of her seat, dancing way out of their reach even as they slammed down onto the oak surface, heads hanging limply down and arms akimbo.
“I was in pyjamas!” Ron said incredulously. Harry hid a grin, and characteristically, Hermione softened.
Mere metres away from where Potter was sitting, his pulse picked up again. Draco started going over what he was planning to say, words running together in his head in a glistening river.
“Oh yeah,” Pansy said, “really terrifying, you are, ‘specially when you’re drunk and cuddly like some sort of debauched teddy bear.”
“So, yeah, I kind of coughed and looked down, and carried on eating, and that night I literally stared at the top of my four- poster and tried to sort out this tangled mass of feelings just sitting in my stomach.”
Draco snorted. Should he tell her how exactly he was coping? By dreaming up people scribbling the next few words to a song that he was almost certain only he knew.
“Oh, don’t look so scandalised,” Ginny said, examining her nails. “It’s a good thing. Shows your date that you have other options, whilst also giving him an attractive insight into what he might get a piece of if he behaves. Works every time.”
to anyone, really, about anything. What was more, he was tired of pretending he didn’t care about the writing on the Quidditch shower wall. He did care, couldn’t sleep for caring, and he couldn’t be rid of the obsession until he knew who’d been scratching away replies to him.
lanced through Harry until he was groaning into Malfoy’s mouth, their lips never ceasing. Harry felt Malfoy’s fingers on the buttons of his own shirt; Malfoy was smiling slightly into their kiss as his fingers slid the silken material off Harry’s shoulders, and it made Harry’s stomach explode with butterflies.
Hermione looked up from her knitting, cheeks pleasantly flushed from the fire. “Lovely. Was it alright?”
Draco stared. “What’s up? I nearly broke my skull open blundering around the corridors with my head gripped in my hands and you’re asking me what’s up? Obviously there’s something wrong with me.”
Hermione burst into the room, cutting herself off as she saw Harry sitting upright in bed, hair mussed and duvets rumpled around his waist.
Blaise was anyone’s dream, and as a boy who had figured out he was gay fairly early in life, Draco had always accepted that he was objectively attractive. At Hogwarts they’d messed around a bit, but it had never meant anything. Partly because Blaise had been completely in denial about his sexuality- which Draco had never been annoyed about, but it was still a surefire way to limit a relationship- and partly because Draco had been just a trifle preoccupied by one green- eyed Saviour. They’d helped each other out as friends, but that was what they were, first and foremost. Friends.
Potter rolled his eyes. “You’re clearly not ready to face it, and I have no idea why else you would be here, so…” he raised his hand as though to catch the waiter’s attention, and Draco saw his lips in slow motion, almost shaping the words ‘the bill, please?’
Draco was jerked out of his reverie by a loud scuffling just outside the classroom. He and the rest of the class looked up as Neville Longbottom, lanky arm looped around one flushed Harry Potter, hobbled into the room.
Ginny chucked lazily, the normally finely- tuned harmony of her voice wavering and slurring just a little. “That’s true. We didn’ know ourselves then.”
And tell her what? That you’re obsessing over some writing on the wall of the Quidditch showers? Part of his brain demanded mulishly.
They turned together to see the Headmistress standing with her arms folded, looking both faintly amused and terribly severe.
Potter turned around, shoulder curving as he looked behind him, and it was so fucking stupid that Draco’s fingers immediately flooded with adrenaline, started to tremble. Potter’s eyes went wide, wide and green, and his eyebrows flicked up. It wasn’t a hard expression, a part of Draco noted anxiously, not icy. As though he remembered the hospital wing. But there was a wariness there, and Potter’s eyes flitted to his right briefly, landing on where the Weaslette had turned with him and was staring baldly at Draco.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, gathering his strength, and with the shreds of his will he placed his hands flat on Malfoy’s chest and pushed, properly now.
“No,” she replied calmly, eyes sharp and alive with something Draco couldn’t place. It wasn’t—mischief?
“Yeah. By people who want to get into your pants,” Draco snapped, leaning away from Blaise and his shameless mouth.
It was fucking wrong, genuinely disturbing, that the sudden plumpness of his bottom lip shot to Draco’s cock.
Harry put his tongue in his cheek, considering. “No, not really, though,” he said eventually. “I mean, I suppose I never gave it a load of thought, but… I wouldn’t have wanted to.”
“Yes, she was,” Draco fought, but even as he said it he realised it was the middle of term. There was no way she could have been here.
But he was angry, and he didn’t care- something about their proximity made Draco reckless. “Not here? Then where, Potter? Where do you want it?” He lowered his voice suggestively, obnoxiously, and leaned in even closer, and then Potter was blushing deeply and drawing back, and a thrill shot down Draco’s spine, a thrill of the sort he’d never felt before. There was something else, too.
He tilted the half- inch forward to Draco’s left ear, voice a sensuous brush on his jawbone, his earlobe, his temple…
Potter waited, the set of his chin firm and his eyes challenging. The rest of his team, backing him, mirrored his expression, standing a little back, still close to the Gryffindor bench. Potter was closest to Draco, slightly apart, but he looked utterly at ease, his hand steady.
who’re in with all the big cheeses at the Ministry.” Draco spat the last few words, and to his shock Potter leant forwards, his face serious.
Something about him, a basic faculty that allowed him to deflect and raise his eyebrows and tell guys he wasn’t interested, had rusted over. He could only stumble weakly into a waiting cab—even as experienced wizards, they were far too drunk to Apparate—and press his face into the smooth column of Malfoy’s neck.
He gave himself an appraising sort of look in the mirror, running a brush through his hair, and then messing up the front so it was soft over his cheekbones, falling a little bit in his eyes and corkscrewing at his temples, damp from the shower.
They followed her down a long, winding staircase with sconces set far back into the stone wall, burning with a fierce light that cast their shadows onto the walls with a flickering vigour. Pansy’s heels rang out dully every time they struck the stairs, but the woman’s feet were strangely silent; Draco glanced down to discover with surprise that she was barefoot.
“Ah!” Draco clutched his heart with his non- chopstick- holding hand. “So brutal. No thought for the feelings of us poor peasants.”
Draco tried to reason, but he couldn’t shake a cold, leaden feeling of betrayal, sitting like a waterlogged corpse in his stomach.
Draco wiped the sweat from his forehead, pulling his robes over his head and using them to mop his brow. Still breathing harshly from practice, he bent, removed his shoes and socks, and walked over to the showers with his wand in hand, shutting himself in a cubicle. Just as he closed the door, he remembered what he had done the last time he’d been in the Quidditch showers. A slow grin spread over his face; still holding his wand, he switched stalls and locked the door, turning the shower on. Draco ducked under the warm water, soaking his hair so it clung to his face and trailed in his eyes. He swept it back with an impatient hand, and turned to the wall where he had inscribed the lines of the song. At first glance, he was sure something was wrong. Three lines, scrawled down on the shining white tiles, stared back at him. Draco frowned, reading them through, a feeling akin to being set on fire spreading through his body before he even realized what was different.
“—definitely pissed with me,” Potter was saying, a touch of anxiety colouring his tone. “I’ve been avoiding him since, and then in the dorm… you saw how he was.”
Draco sat up, offended. Probably without reason. But it stung, struck a place in him that was still too raw to be held to the light like that. “I wouldn’t do that,” he said, and it came out biting. “I’m not entirely a backstabbing worm, you know.”
His stomach growled, a faint edge of queasiness curling through him, and Draco was just about to slump fully to the table when Pansy elbowed him hard, staring at the doors to the Great Hall.
Draco sat bouncing his leg shallowly for at least five minutes before he felt someone squeeze his hand. The dry slide of skin over skin made him look up and do a double take; the way their fingers slotted together was incredibly familiar, so to see Theo Nott’s eyes looking at him earnestly from his right was… unnerving, to say the least.
