Kinsley smiled. “Good.” He pulled out a mountain of paperwork from somewhere under his desk and shoved it towards the both of them. “Start by familiarizing yourselves with the evidence. I will warn you-- some of the crime scene photographs are not for the faint of heart.”
They lived as a whole, a single entity, for three days. Endearments masked as insults, fondness masked as anger, drew the two impossibly closer together. After yet another round of some really great sex, as he ran his fingers through soft blond locks, Harry realized how deep his love for Draco Malfoy really ran. It was his blood, his flesh, his reason; his home.
Harry interjected. “Calm down, you two. I didn’t say I was going to try to shag him or anything. I was just...sharing an observation.”
“NO!” Draco bellowed as the bulky man seized his arms. He pushed against the knight but his attempts were futile;his chest was rippling stone. “UNHAND ME, YOU TRAITOR! LET ME GO, OBEY YOUR PRINCE!”
Harry snorted. “Hey, you got my name right this time! Excellent. But yeah, alright. Because conversing with you is
The events of last night hit him like a freight train. The Prince. Draco Malfoy was the Prince. Harry shook his head in an attempt to clear his racing thoughts, and when this failed he knew what he needed to do. Ron and Hermione. He needed to tell Ron and Hermione about this. With that thought in mind, Harry rolled off of the cold floor and stood, gingerly removing his soiled robes. He dug an old (and thankfully clean) undershirt of Dudley’s out of a chest, and dressed himself. He practically ran to the library, having known the way by heart now, and almost tripped when pushing open the heavy wooden doors.
Parkinson rummaged through her robe pocket and raised an empty firewhiskey bottle. She hunkered down and placed the bottle on the floor. She sat first on the ground with both of her legs tucked under thighs, and everyone joined her to encircle the empty firewhiskey bottle.
Harry chuckled at the last comment. He arched his brows and leaned back, crossing his arms. “Am I less handsome because of that?”
as Harry called it, and to this day Harry had a room to feel annoyed of the journalist. The room wasn't dark, but it wasn't fed with sunlight either, it would be narrow but at least they could shut the door without trapping themselves in. The place was discreet in general, enough to keep them away from the pryful students. He looked at Draco again to confirm, and to his relief, the blond nodded back.
"Bye, Malfoy," Harry had dismissed himself then went ahead to an empty table. He propped the books in front of him and dropped the books carefully. He started reading, flattening the papers first before he flipped the pages timidly. He scanned first the table of content before going to page hundred and twenty-seven. Then, he began reading. He thought for a moment he lost himself in the book since Potions had always been interesting to him (though Snape didn't favor him so much that he ended up not liking Potions when he's inside his class). Upon reaching the hundred and thirty-fourth page, he realized he wasn’t alone – accompanied by someone who was sitting just across him. He recognized the person by the smell. Harry, persistent not to snap, didn't look up and acted like Malfoy was nothing but air.
It was a good idea, Harry thought at first. Bring Malfoy to Hagrid to spend time with him together and talk about Quidditch, owls and other sorts of things they'd find amusing with a cupful of tea, two sugars and no milk just as Harry liked it. Harry, putting his wand back to his pocket, held Malfoy's arm and dragged him closer to Hagrid's house. He waited for Malfoy's breath to regulate before speaking again.
"Don't talk shit about Luna!" Harry watched blood drip off Malfoy's lips. His heart felt combusting and infuriated with every molecule that makes up Draco Malfoy.
"Oh, Mr. Potter!" said the clueless cheerful madam, and Harry was flaming inside with guilt. "You have Quidditch practice coming up, and you're the captain, I presume? I was informed by Professor McGonagall when I went to her office about your condition, so I asked Professor Snape for a strong healing potion for your quickest recovery." The madam held up a small vial. "Here, Mr. Malfoy, three drops on Mr. Potter's water. I have an important meeting to attend to! I trust you could be of assistance? And,
Harry drew in a deep breath first before nodding. That wasn't a bad of a deal but he was still in a situation where Malfoy was involved. He looked back at the circle and immediately turned furious when he saw Malfoy looking at him, impatiently tapping his foot on the ground. The circle wasn’t helping either, some are either cheering Malfoy, while some have blatantly disgusted expression written on their faces. Harry could relate.
“What?” Draco breathed, he doesn't think he can't function quite well after Potter cutting all his functioning wires with his words.
They waited for the Map to appear, eyes immediately sought for their dad's name and cringe in an instant when they saw where he was headed.
Harry narrowed his eyes at the dry comment before he rolled them. "Malfoy, if you must know, I'm not pleased to have you as my pretend boyfriend as well."
"How- how did you-" tried Malfoy breathlessly, couldn't even finish his sentence as he made a sound behind his throat, and stared at Harry unblinking.
"All of us didn't get any." Neville piped in from his bed. "You know the Slytherins gave them away at breakfast, and we were late this morning."
Apart from that, he had also gone to meet McGonagall to express his thoughts, but whilst she had given him a rather strange twinkle look, all she said was,
“You don't have to be sorry, you know.” said Parkinson, seemingly having gotten her wits together. “We only sit here together because of Albus and Scorpius. I can say this is the most civil we've been to each other.”
"Yea, well." shrugged Ron. "You didn't really tell us you already knew Malfoy was the one who has been snogging you senseless so we didn't think it was a matter."
“How'd you know?” asked Ron, as he moved to take a seat in front of the Irishman. The rest of them automatically followed his action.
“Come on, papa! Harry Potter was not the only wizard with these genetic traits! Isn't it Scorp?” said the black haired boy, nudging his brother on his side.
He had asked Seamus about it, but apparently Parkinson had spent less time with him, saying something about house unity that didn't make sense to the Irishman since she has been ignoring him. Harry could only patted him in sympathy, not that he had any luck with his own.
What shock Harry even more is when a voice, that he's very much familiar with, shouted far from his right.
“Well, you tell me then if you didn't feel the same.” said Ron instead, giving Zabini a challenging look.
"Merlin, fine!" Harry reluctantly stepped away, regrettably letting go of his hands' new favourite place for the time being. "You don't have to be so feisty."
There was nothing that can compare to what Scorpius felt when he saw his father walk down the Great Hall looking handsome as he ever; alive, and most importantly his father looked much healthier than the last time Scorpius saw him.
Harry doesn't remember losing control, he doesn't remember unleashing his power as he charged towards Voldemort; having only one purpose in his mind and that was to kill the King of Demon Regime with his own hands. He doesn't remember getting wounded, he doesn't remember summoning his lover's sword, the black blade of Hawthorne as he used all his strength to breach into Voldemort's defenses. He doesn't remember succeeding to steal an opening, using the opportunity to swing the black blade towards the King's neck and cleanly separated the head from its body, he doesn't remember that he had managed to end the life of Voldemort, making him as the new King of the Demon Regime.
He watched as Potter glowed up when Ginevra laughed at his jokes and he bit his lips. He looked down at his untouched food, and suddenly he didn't have the appetite to eat. A hand grabbed his elbow, pulling him to collide with a soft body. He looked at Granger who pressed her lips, eyes filled with sympathies making Draco roll his eyes at her.
There was a small moment of silence before Malfoy scoffed, though his cheeks were pink. "You could've at least see me tomorrow, Potter. There's no need for a night escapade like this."
His heart felt at peace somehow, once he understood the feelings he had towards Malfoy. It was bizarre indeed, having a crush on Draco Malfoy of all people. Nevertheless, at the same time, it felt as if a complex puzzle has just solved; indeed, some took days to put each pieces together, sometimes it took months and in Harry's case, it took them for about seven years, going through a war even, though they have fought in different sides but they have managed to survive and it was time for them to start a new beginning and knowing his feelings was reciprocate, Harry can't wait to explore this feelings with Malfoy.
"What!" exclaimed Harry, legs instantly halted as he wildly took his surroundings but Malfoy was already gone. He gritted his teeth in annoyance as he shouted, "You can run, but you can't hide!"
“Scorpius, proceed.” Albus instructed and the other boy nodded. They simultaneously fixed their demeanor by straightening up in their seats and placed both hands on top of their lap; a behaviour that Draco was familiar with. Whilst it amazed Draco that the two boys were in sync, it also sent him into a sudden alarmed because the behaviour was exactly what Draco would always do when he tried to convince his parents into agreeing with his ridiculous idea.
"Excuse me," said Harry out loud, finally deciding to take part in the conversation. Malfoy turned to him with a face feigned with innocence.
He heard the growl next to his ears and saw the man backed away with his hands up in surrender. “Sorry, mate. Thought he was available.”
Henry gave an amused laugh before a cool hand touch his right leg made him gasped. A foreign incantation of spells was heard then, as warm magic washes over him gently, making him shiver down his spine. He felt Henry's fingers touch every bit of his skin like a butterfly, slowly but surely as he inspected every inch of him. He savoured the warm feeling spread through his body, unaware of the hand that was slowly climbing up his body until he let out an accidental moan when Henry's hand touched his inner thigh.
"Gryffindor." Malfoy muttered, and sighed. "Well, I am well and alive. You may go now, before Madam Promfey wakes up and sees you here."
Scorpius gave an annoyed sigh, taking out the wand that they had nicked from their papa and tapped on the Map. "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good."
“We've found the curse,” Draco heard Granger said as he pulled the blanket over his sleeping twins. Poor boys managed to tire themselves playing games with Blaise, Potter and Weasley. He took a glance at the small group just next to the bed; the food was long gone and now all of them gathered in a circle, each possessing transfigured pillows in their arms.
“Draco!” called Potter and Draco turned to him with a questioning look. “Aren't you forgetting something?”
"Yea," replied their younger dad mindlessly, biting his lips and he frowned hard. He ran his fingers through his unruly hair and sighed desperately. He turned to Albus then. "I need to go somewhere, Albus. Can you stay here with Scorpius?"
." sighed Malfoy. "You knew I can't associate well with your friends. Let alone pretending to be Potter's boyfriend."
A death glare stares down at him, manages to gives him chills so he quickly put on a sheepish smile, hands lets go off the injured pretty hands to rub down the toned thigh in a gentle manner.
"You're welcome." said Malfoy suddenly, breaking the awkward silence between them. Harry took his eyes up to meet the pair of grey eyes, tilting his head in confusion. "Uh, what."
Albus nodded, “You keep that book along with other fancies looking books, you said the books are a forbidden knowledge for little children.”
Somehow, they unconsciously leant forward the twins, peering down at their faces waiting for the answer.
"I'm not going to let you go," said Harry, smiling when Draco frowned at him. "Not when I have you in my arms now."
“What, Harry?” asked Hermione, who turned out to be the victim of Harry's jab attack. She swatted Harry's finger away, a little frown decorating her face.
Harry blinked, aware that the expression was only reserved when Leo was trying to get someone into doing what he wanted them to do, and he always succeeded so; Harry can confirm it, he was one of the victims after all. He quickly dragged his eyes to Malfoy, weirdly anticipating how he would handle his brother's scheming look.
“Hey, you two! Why don't you take a break for a moment?” called Parkinson over the fireplace but got dismissive waves from both Hermione and Malfoy.
He remembered Draco’s face, flushed with happiness as he accepted Harry's proposal, he remembered Draco’s wide smile the moment he said 'I do', he remembered Draco’s excitement when they knew he was carrying their twins, and when the image of Draco with sunken cheeks, sickly thin body with grey pale skin, and tired dull eyes seeping through his mind, Harry had to exhaled a shaky breath, closing his eyes tightly until the image of Draco whimpering in pain disappeared.
He takes a deep breath as he rubbed his temple faintly, taking in the sight of Malfoy in front of him. As usual, he sits on the seat Harry pointed him to every time Harry called him in. But this time, instead of babbling his dissatisfaction towards the treatment he received, or defending his action on why he was in a fight; he simply sit there, doing none of those.
"I'm talking from experience, you brat." said Henry, gritting his teeth. "Remember, the key to a happy marriage is-"
Harry exchanged amused looks with his friends when they witnessed the once gloomy Slytherins turned bright and cheerful. They have been practically laying low since the term has started; walking around like a kicked puppies, heads bent down instead of lifting them up proudly like they once did, and they were literally doing their best staying out of trouble.
Malfoy stopped dead on this track, gaping as Henry laughed aloud. Zabini, Parkinson and Ginny follow his action - even Hermione cracked an amused smile while Ron looks mortified.
“Draco Malfoy?” The man says with hesitancy, as if he can't believe that he's standing in front of his old archenemy.
Harry ignored him, looking past Malfoy to send Henry a death glare. “You said you won't do anything to him!” He barked.
Draco burst out a laugh, and looked up adoringly to Harry's handsome face. “Okay, you got me there.”
“Dra- Draco.” Pansy suddenly slapped his knee rapidly, and he stopped to see that everyone had frozen as they stared dumbfounded at Draco’s back, even Blaise had woken up from his nap. That was when Draco realised of the shadow looming behind him. He quickly turned around and looked up to see a man; possessing the most unimpressed look Draco ever saw as the man crossed his arms, raising an eyebrow at him - no, not at him but at his twins.
"This is amazing." commented Harry, taking the surroundings. Though they used spells to pack the presents and wrap them, it didn't stop the students from working together whilst having fun at the same time. Stacks of presents that were done were piled in the corner, and Harry noted that they have done a literally good job at it.
He continued his journey back to the common room with a lighter heart, lips spreading into a wide smile. He went straight to his bed as he arrived, slipping under the blanket and propped his hands under his head as he recalled his interaction with Malfoy.
Draco gaped in disbelief before he scoffed, lifting a hand to rub his cheek, as if he could put off the redness that was painted on his skin. "Don't be ridiculous, and stop saying nonsense!"
“You see, Headmistress,” Albus continued, ignoring his brother exasperated face, “Our papa is currently has fallen ill, he's been cursed- a curse that turned his blood into poisons, and the only person who can save him is his very own self.”
Draco sighed, almost desperate that he couldn't be of help to calm the baby down when a song deep in his unconscious mind involuntarily stumbled out of his mouth.
There were a few moments of silence as the two of them watched as Headmistress McGonagall pressed her lips together as if contemplating the information she has just received. “Harry Potter's son.” she began, and they nodded. “I am sure Mr. Potter is currently sitting at the Great Hall with his friends.”
All of them wore a pinched look, and Draco took a glance at his twins who were sleeping soundly. “They didn't deserve this.” He whispered softly.
The first few weeks in, dared Harry said that it was just what he had pictured in his head before he came to Hogwarts. The students came to Hogwarts with the same vision of starting a new chapter of life and Harry was thankful for that even though sometimes there will be students who had gawked at him as if he was Merlin himself, some have even dared to be forward by taking a chance to touch him and some were shy enough to give him a grateful smile- he appreciated those the most. Even so, The atmosphere of Hogwarts was gloomy, dark and dreaded with what happened during the War that it has taken a toll on the students which made Hogwarts practically dead.
Potter didn't say anything, but kept his eyes locked to Draco that made him feel hot under his collar.
He proceeded with telling Harry that they were originally just wanted to give the chocolate to the Slytherin students to lift their spirit, but then they decided it was better to include their house in their plan and change their target to the other three houses seeing that Hogwarts practically dead when the students acted like the castle itself brought them misery. "Besides," said Draco with a little smirk. "It was good to restore our image."
"Wha- you can't do that!" Harry gaped at the white-blond haired man who has his arms crossed together, lips pressed as if daring anyone that would disagree with his words.
“They must've loved you so much.” said Potter, biting his lips and looking at Draco with those eyes again, as if regarding him closely.
"Gryffindor!" Someone shouted all of a sudden, that got the students to stop their activities and simultaneously turned to where Draco and Harry had stood. For a moment, Harry was worried that he might get a hex from the Slytherins but once again, he was surprised when the students gave a thunderous applause, and he gave Draco a questioning look when the younger students pulled him further into the room. When he found himself casting a spell to tie a ribbon on the presents half an hour later, he was glad that they had involved him in their activity. Not without getting tease every now and then, of course, especially from Pansy, Zabini, Nott and even Goyle but it was nice to see that Draco was having fun. He even kissed Harry in front of them too.
Harry yelped when Hermione jabbed his waist. He gave her a side eye as he rubbed his abused spot and frowned at her. “What, Hermione?”
With that, he pulled himself together and slowly blinked his eyes open, and subtly dragged his eyes to Harry's forehead. He let out a sigh of relief when he saw it was free from the infamous scar.
"About time you make your move, Potter." said Parkinson, stepping forward and slapped Harry's bicep in a friendly way as she smirked. "He was about to give up on you."
“I said, I think I'm falling in love with you.” He repeated, much louder and slower than before. Draco blinked stupidly as Potter fidget in his spot, peeking an eye at him.
“Alright,” decided Harry, crossing his arms together just to look intimidating. He'd hope he looked intimidating in Malfoy's eyes. “But whatever you want to say to me, you say it in front of them." He gestured to both Ron and Hermione.
“Wonderful! We'll be sharing a room then.” Henry grinned at Malfoy who spluttered, “Wo- Won’t that be inappropriate?”
He caresses the small nest of a black hair, quite sure with himself that the baby has fallen asleep. “You poor little thing, cried yourself to sleep, aren't you?”
What he looked forward to everyday was those bloody mysterious kisses. Now that he thought about it, Malfoy’s lips-
Seeing the bright faces managed to draw a smile from Harry. It was nice to see a change of event. Perhaps with this, Hogwarts will finally heal.
Draco suddenly felt his heart turned heavy when he saw two little frowns on his sons’ faces. “Well,” He gulped down the sudden lump in his throat and reached out to touch his sons’ cheek. “My future husband sounds wonderful and he's going to give me two beautiful boys! Oh, I love him already!”
“This is the tenth time this week that you managed to be involved in a fight. Do you have any excuses for yourself?” Harry asks. He draws a disapproving frown on his face and twist his lips in disappointed manner.
Never once Draco got attacked with kisses that fast in his life. He laughed when the twins kiss him wherever they can reach, complete with a smooching sound. He replied by giving them kisses back.
Draco frowns, unconsciously walks closer to the wailing baby, placing a soft touch to the baby's back. He looks at the witch who warily stares at him in confusion and he smiles at her reassuringly despite the baby's loud cries. “May I try?”
Several heads turn from Neville to him, and Harry instantly recall the meeting they were having before Neville bursts the door open - rather dramatically in Harry's opinion.
"I have packed these chocolates in a box, as I can't hand it to you in person. There's one for each day until Christmas hols and Merlin, I can't say more but I did include a card for you-"
They stared at each other for a good moment before Potter slowly approached him, and Draco unconsciously stood up straighter, his grip on the baby tightens.
and, by the way, had issues with his father currently in jail. He would cry on my lap all day long during the weekends, not muttering a single word about what his problem was. He would just sob like a kid, until he stops - then that's it. He'd leave and act like it was all fine once again. I guess sometimes he tends to run away from his frustrations by fighting with you." Pansy paused for a moment. "Draco isn't the type to spill all of his problems through talking, Potter. He prefers writing it all in his diary and not telling anyone of it. That's
“Malfoy,” he called, then tugged on Draco's sleeve. Draco slapped his hands off him and plucked his wand out. He thought Harry was going to attack, but he didn't. Harry wasn't just about to do that. Realizing the ridiculous pose, he coughed and gave Harry a chance to talk.
Harry nodded, holding a rather feral magical frog in his hand, screaming at his touch. He could feel Ron and Hermione staring at the back of his head giving curious gazes. "I know, but if you could give me a hint of how to make him talk to me,"
Harry didn't respond anymore and carried on with his reading, blood pumping through him fast. He stopped all the urges to tell Malfoy off the library because any second his arm would raise and attempt to blast Malfoy off Hogwarts all the way to the village down it. That wasn't a bad idea since half the population of the school would rejoice for his absence. Malfoy was just brave to mess him up in Potions because Snape favoured him in everything. Even at that time Harry's brewed
He watched Draco slowly release the tension off his own shoulder and looked Harry in the eye, unpredictable, but with a tinge of fear in it. Harry wasn't sure how he'd interpret Malfoy's expression but he could see that Malfoy almost broke his normal demeanor, an attempt to convey a reaction to the sentence Harry said.
good friends. Could it go like this until then? Harry was afraid they wouldn't be comfortable anymore after this, that they would be back to square one once Malfoy leaves his bed. He never found it a good thing to do but Harry was certain he didn't want this chance with Malfoy to slip away. Such a
"I’m going to study somewhere quiet where there is none of you. Good riddance, and please let me get the book," Draco said and stood up, gathering all of his things and grabbed a hold of the Potions book.
With that one swift moment, Harry realized how much tension had fallen off his shoulders, along with the fact tha maybe he and Malfoy had always wanted to be friends with each other.
A few seconds later, he had finally found his glasses and wore it back to his face, cheeks red. He stacked the books back to his arms before he stood to face the person he bothered the time of. And he gasped.
Harry, whose eyebags are getting darker by the day, was devastated to be one of the hundreds who needed to do these preparations, and in addition to his stress of homeworks and abusive potions master who couldn't stop taking points off him for unknown yet obviously irrational reasons, Draco Malfoy became
It was observable that Draco Malfoy was the palest of them all. The only milk-skinned pray tell what product he used to have that type of complexion, lacking in melanin. He was dressed in a seemingly expensive black and fit clothing, the sleeves clinging on his slender arms. At the pit of Harry's stomach, there was insecurity somewhere in there because of his baggy clothes that was almost four years old, faded through time. He didn’t exactly know why Draco was still bothering his mind, making him insecure, but he didn’t want to think about it further. It only causes him  headache.
Everyone actually liked greeting Harry, he had always been quick to respond to different requests, needs and other problems he would be willing to meddle in no matter how bizarre or foolish that is. Although not this time. He was barely approachable today, as if his looks alone could zap someone and leave fire.
If Ron would be honest, this must be one of the effects of Harry's depression. Losing his Godfather Sirius hadn't been easy for his mental being and the knowledge of simply having to die before having the chance to win against Voldemort, the mad lad who had a killing spree when Harry could barely walk, is tormenting Harry to bits even though he hadn't told him or Hermione about it too much. Emotional support was all he could bring to his best friend, to express his brotherly-love as much as he could.
"As if you'd tell me anyway." Harry looked at the floor, the dust there was getting very interesting to observe from his view. There was regret somewhere in there for having a deal like this with Malfoy. "I did want to... genuinely help you. Those cuts on your arm - you know the day I found you in Myrtle's bathroom. For a moment I was - "
Harry did two long breaths, voice bored as he spoke his next words. "You could go eat first. I'll be at Gryffindor Tower. Let's meet at the Courtyard after an hour."
Harry nodded and grabbed the huge stack. He looked at Malfoy, who was still desperately avoiding his gaze. “My office, or yours?”
Dudley laughed and stomped his way over to the stairs, and Harry had to repress another snort at how pathetic his uncle and cousin truly were.
“No!” Draco practically yelled, embarrassment creeping up his spine as soon as the word left his mouth. Harry only grinned, eyes glinting. Bastard, Draco thought.
“Ah. Yes, of course,” Draco said, and Harry raised his eyebrows when Draco failed to respond with a witty retort of his own.  “Would you please put a shirt on?” Draco fussed with his own shirt collar, shifting awkwardly. “It’s...distracting.”
“Hey,” Harry mumbled. He grabbed Malfoy's wrist and placed a chaste kiss to his slender, porcelain hand. “Don't be nervous. We can stop whenever you want.”
The pads of Draco’s boney fingers created a repetitive song against his mahogany desk. Focus, he thought, gritting his teeth. Focus.
“Yeah! Isn’t that incredible? I’ve never seen a Muggleborn with a job other than servitude. Uhm, no offense, of course.”
“I’ve seen their work before,” Draco released a shuddering breath. Images flashed before him-- a Muggle child screaming for his mother as she was torn from limb to limb, the Dark Lord smiling slightly at the show. Pleased.
“Wow, uh, that’s great. I’ll have to check those out,” Harry mumbled. Hermione seemed unfazed by the flatness in Harry’s tone; she just smiled and gestured to the entire library.
Draca’s face was a bright shade of pink and she was blinking rapidly, leaving into Harriet’s touch but avoiding her gaze. “Shut...Shut up, Potter.”
“I-I,” Draca began, suddenly without confidence, words forced and awkward. “I would never flirt with the likes of you, Potter!” She stuck her nose up into the air, crossing her arms, and Harriet thought absently that she looked like an angry toddler.
“Well I wouldn’t have if I’d’ve known you’d dump the goddamn laundry into the river and then have a near-death experience!” Harry said, quickly gathering up all the bags and shoving one of the lighter ones at Draco. “Make yourself useful and carry this back with me. It’s the least you can do.”
The Prince shivered at the forcefulness of Harry’s demand but shook his head. Hm, Harry thought with a smirk. Perhaps the Prince is imagining someone too.
Scorpio chose that moment to re-enter the kitchen and attach himself to his parents’ legs, squealing in delight. Harry laughed, removing himself from Draco, and pat his son on the head.
“Shh!” Blaise hissed, spit flying from her mouth as she tied her textured hair into two parallel buns. “What if someone hears you?”
Draco felt a cold, intense pain against his cheek. His brain went blank for a moment, only to realize that he’d been slapped. Hard enough to leave a bruise, he thought almost absently. His father grabbed the nape of his shirt, pushing him up against the cherry wood walls. Icy, almost inhuman eyes bore into Draco's own as his father hissed a few venomous words at him.
Harry cut him off with a wet kiss and began finger-fucking him harder and quicker, brushing up against his prostate with every thrust.  Draco, keened, arching his back and pushing himself onto Harry's fingers.
“That’s called ‘ringing’,” Potter was smirking-- he seemed to be thoroughly amused by Draco’s ignorance. “Put it up against your ear and listen.”
“Hm.” Draco stepped away now, smoothing his hair back. “I see. I wonder, were you invited to the Prince’s ball?”
Harry knows how much he will hate himself for this later on, but he gives into his impulses and pulls Draco into a tight hug. He smells of fancy cologne and clean air; his taught body is warm and pliant.
The blood drained from Harry’s face at the thought. It was still autumn and the weather, although mild during the afternoon, often became painfully chilly in the evenings.
“He thinks I’m a liar! He already thinks I’m a stuck-up ponce as it is, now I’ve just gone and made things worse!”
Not beta'd, I apologize for any spelling/grammar mistakes. With college stuff we just don't have much time to edit.
“Ah,” Narcissa cut him off, voice gentle. Her eyes were unusually warm as she clasped her two thin hands together. “I see now.”
“Accio glasses,” Harry whispered, catching his spectacles in midair as they flew to him. Once he could see clearly enough to navigate through the dark Muggle bedroom, he dressed himself and set off to find the front door.
“Excuse me? Are you implying that our library is lacking in some way? I’ll have you know that we have every book on every topic possible, and it is no fault of ours that The King has refused to publish any of his speeches.”
“Thank you, Harry. I made the dress from my mother’s old one,” She smoothed out her skirt. “You look wonderful too, Harry! Like a Prince.”
“Shown me how to be a decent human being?” Before Harry could stammer out a reply, Draco continued. “I regret nothing. And although it’s rather obvious, I suppose this needs saying.” Draco tried in vain to keep his voice steady and failed. “I...am...absurdly attracted to you, Potter. Someone of my blood status feeling this way is unheard of, but I figure there’s no use in denying it, i-is there?”
All too soon, Harry reluctantly pulled away. Kissing Draco was turning him on much more than it should have been, and he decided to spare them both the awkwardness that would come with Draco noticing.
Draco swallowed and flinched when Lucius raised a hand again. Relief flooded senses, however, when his father merely pointed to the jewel encrusted ring on his index finger; the family heirloom.
“Potter,” Draco said weakly, trying and failing to push Harry off. “I must return to my castle, Father is probably terrified.”
“People change, Ronald,” Hermione awkwardly took a sip of her butterbeer and the three sat in tense silence for a moment. “...Has he changed, Harry?”
Once he was spruced up in his typical attire, Draco looked at himself in the mirror. He knew he was good looking, of course, but today he was doubting himself. He shook his head and puffed his chest out while smoothing back a stray strand of hair. Perfect, he thought.
Ronda snorted out a laugh and her messy ,red pixie cut flopped around with every movement of her head. “Spending time together? Really, ‘Mione? You can just say it, you know. They’re fucking!”
Draco looked down, seeming to notice Harry’s hands wrapped around him, and flushed. “Oh...yes, I suppose you are,” He sniffed, looking everywhere but Harry’s eyes.
“He hates me, Pans, he hates me!” Draco moaned, head in his best friend’s lap. She twirled a silvery strand of his hair between her fingers.
Finally, summoning what little courage he had, Draco stood up. He rubbed his own arms and threw on some particularly ornamental robes (the ones his Father had chosen for him years ago) in hopes of winning his favor. He rolled his eyes at his own ridiculousness. Like his father would ever remember or appreciate such a thing. He sighed, gelled his hair back with a generous glob, and walked stiffly to his father’s study.
Harry pulled out for a moment, only to thrust back in with more force. Draco cried out, biting his own fist, and Harry grinned as a bead of sweat dripped down his forehead.
Draco cleared his throat and Harry just about jumped out of his skin. “Draco?! I-I mean, Your Highness?! What the hell are you doing here, it’s the middle of the night--”
Thoughts of Draco stayed buried deep within the confines of Harry’s mind. He couldn’t worry, wouldn’t worry, about Draco’s fate. About his own. Over the course of the week, however, anxiety began to creep up his spine often in the dead of night, when the walls creaked and silence permeated the stuffy air.
“Sorry about that. I, uh, had a situation,” Harry said, nodding at Draco. Vernon didn’t appear to have even noticed the gesture or Draco’s existence, however. His chubby face was morphing into an ugly shade of angry, purplish-red and his beady eyes were glued upon Harry.
“Fuck,” Harriet swore, pressing against Draca. Their moans were soon filling the lavatory, echoing off of the walls, and Harriet silently thanked Merlin that Moaning Myles was busy somewhere else for once.
“Well, I suppose that'll be our first step,” He mumbled, still shell-shocked by the pure perfection that was his new boyfriend.
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione smiled, placing a chilly hand on his cheek affectionately. “He’s already in love with you. Something tells me he won’t mind if you’re still in pajamas.”
Harry froze when he heard loud, echoing footsteps in the corridor outside of the dungeon. Was it time? He released a shuddering sigh, sinking to the floor and feeling strangely limp. He waited for a few tense moments, biting his lip; and then a group of men marched into the room, strong and silent. Harry looked up, trying to keep his dignity and not appear afraid, but was shocked to see The King himself in the doorway with an entourage of knights in his wake. His skin was flushed, something harry interpreted as rather uncharacteristic; he’d never imagine that someone so powerful could appear so disheveled. His eyes resembled Draco's although they lacked any sort of warmth; his blond hair was weighed down with product and barely brushed his collar bones.
Harry failed to see the appeal of that job, but he smiled politely anyway. “That’s quite impressive, Ron. What about you, Hermione?”
Once class was dismissed, Harriet breathed out an audible sigh of relief earning her a confused stare from Deanna Thomas, who had been her ‘partner’ for today’s lecture. Harriet noticed that Ronda and ‘Mione had left on their own, probably because the knew that she had other plans after class.
Harry sped up the pace and Draco shook with pleasure, practically screaming Harry’s name. Suddenly he was coming with a cry, shooting all over Harry’s abdomen. Pure bliss thrummed through his veins for what could have been an eternity; he’d never came so intensely before. Harry was not far behind, as Draco’s name stumbled from his lips and he shuddered, spilling into Draco with a low moan. Draco trembled with the aftershocks, mind buzzing with electricity.
“My deepest most sincere apologies, Sire,” She said, rolling her deep brown eyes playfully and walking alongside Draco. “Where are you headed?”
“Well,” ‘Mione began. Harry could feel another lecture coming on. “First of all, you hate each other.”
“More,” Draco hissed, pushing back against Harry’s fingers. “Give me more, just fuck me already, just--”
Scorpius stuck his tongue out at Draco and Harry smirked. One point for him. “I think that’s great, Little Bug. I think we can manage that, can’t we darling?”
“I...I felt I should apologize, for keeping my.... position from you,” Draco mumbled, cheeks hot. Apologizing was not one of his strengths.
Light snow is blowing about and the sky is grey and endless. Draco’s hand is heavy in his; a welcome weight.
“A commoner? So I’m not a filthy Squib anymore? What an upgrade!” Harry grinned slyly, unfazed by Draco’s insults. He took a seat on one of the armchairs, propping his feet up on the oaken coffee table, and stretched. Draco, who was glaring daggers into him, took a seat in the opposite chair.
“Don’t you treat your servants like dog shit too? Thought that was a noble thing. Not that you can even call my uncle a noble.”
"D'you think eating can wait?" Harry asked. He could feel Draco's warm breath against his face, could smell the fancy soap he used, and it was intoxicating.
“Yours,” Malfoy replied instantaneously. He seemed to catch himself, and then added a quiet: “Please.”
Draco's eyes welled up, much to his chagrin. They wouldn't take Harry from him. Couldn't. He opened his mouth to argue, to protest, but then Harry’s warm, calloused hand was cupping his cheek.
Potter rifled through the papers. “Here we are. June third, 2003. Yesterday. Or was it the day before?”
“What? Didn’t catch that,” Harry replies, fighting back the urge to take one of Draco’s hands into his own. I suppose I’ve tortured him enough for one day, haven’t I? He thinks.
“Potter, stop it, shut your stupid mouth, they aren't going to lay a finger on you, I won't let father--” Draco's rambling was cut off by an absurdly gentle kiss upon his forehead.
“I don’t...I don’t understand,” Draco said, cautious; he couldn’t allow himself to be happy, not yet, not when this situation was so surreal.
Harry swallowed and thought back to Malfoy’s tear-stained cheeks the night prior. With a strange feeling in his chest, he recounted Draco’s softer voice, duller eyes. “Seems as though he has. Quite a bit. But he’s...I dunno, scared of me or something.”
“Think we’ll catch them?” Potter asked through a yawn. Draco tried and failed to keep his eyes away from Potter’s seemingly sizable...package.
“Disrespectful lowlife,” Draco grumbled as he stepped out of his robes. Harry, ironically out of respect, turned his head. Draco did not seem to mind, however, being as he stepped in front of Harry in all of his shirtless glory the moment he had finished stripping. Thankfully, he was wearing a fancy bathing costume; deep green shorts with white trim. They fit him rather...well, and it took all of Harry’s self control not to curse under his breath. As obnoxious and prissy as this man was, Harry had to admit that he was simply gorgeous.
So Harry did. He found his favorite couch and took a seat after thumbing through various editions of fantasy stories. He settled on a collection of children’s tales and once again, despite their simple vocabulary, Harry found that he quite enjoyed them.
The Prince was quiet, refusing to utter even a word, and he moved with a certain grace that Harry had only ever read about. His limbs were quick, tactile, calculated; they somehow guided Harry, who had absolutely no idea how to dance. One foot pushed back, one foot gliding forward; to an outsider, it might have seemed as though Harry actually knew what he was doing. The Prince’s hand was clasped tightly around his, skin so soft and clean that Harry couldn’t help but wonder if he had ever touched a broom in his life. Their feet echoed on the sparkling, tile floors and Harry was keenly aware of the hundreds of eyes on his back. The Prince, however, was unfazed. He continued on without so much as a backwards glance, movements gracile and sure.
Harry barked out a laugh and pat Neville on the shoulder. “None taken. Well, alright, I’d better be going. Hope the fish bite today. See you, Neville!”
“I’m curious as well,” Hermione chimed in and then shifted her gaze to the bartender. Today, she was a tiny old witch with a giant hat. “Three butterbeers, please.”
Harry’s guffawing tapered off as he wiped a tear away from his cheek. “It’s--” He began stopping to catch his breath. “You were wearing these exact robes, with this exact hairstyle, when I first met you. And the first thing I thought was, what a stuck up prick.”
Draco was not an insatiable teenager anymore and he was not about to start wanking in his office. He would absolutely not sink so low.
“Did you wear these for me?” She asked breathlessly, moving her fingers in small circles. Draca said nothing, but pressed against Harriet’s hand eagerly.
Hermione elbowed him this time. “I do too! I just don’t see it. Ron doesn’t suit you. Too casual for a knight.”
Ron scratched the back of his head and shifted awkwardly. “Er, yeah. They are. But of course I’d never speak badly of his Royal Highness, that would go against my Knightly Pledge!”
(This is just for fun and it's not edited or anything, so sorry for any typos or grammatical errors!)
Now it was Harry's turn to blush. “It, er, I didn't want to go too fast since it's your first time and all--”
He continued on, taking in the brick buildings and various street vendors practically begging for his business, until he reached the worn-down establishment that was the kingdom’s center of knowledge. Little actually knew that this building existed, and the select few who did treated it as some kind of sanctuary. The library was special. Harry would always see the same people there, the same faces, reading the same genres of books.
manage to avoid one of them last Wednesday after their Charms class, but Malfoy had Disillusioned himself before Harry had the chance to say "
Harry nodded, noticing the awkward atmosphere vanishing, it must be a good thing Malfoy was good at being professional.
someone eating breakfast with peers, possibly knowing that Harry was glaring their way but had chosen to ignore it, unfazed or couldn't care less of it because Gryffindors are unfortunately on the top of their most-ignored list. Ron shook his head, not in the mood for another game of
Pansy, eyes roaming around the bustling area, eventually spotted Potter rooted to where he was standing ten feet away from her and stared tentatively. Eventually she smiled at him to Harry's surprise, waving her hands and turning to whisper something to Zabini's ear (probably asking permission to go to Harry) before she dashed towards him.
and believed all it said. They were all rubbish nonsense, in Harry's opinion, having spies in the school and putting all information they could get from those spies so they'd have the reason for their newspaper to sell well, putting him on the front page. He was glad Rita Skeeters was gone – the articles could've been worse.
Malfoy's low and hushed voice did wonders to Harry's stomach. He stared at Malfoy's eyes for a moment, defiant at first, trying to make something out of it, decipher it, read the greyness of the git's eyes that glared at him fondly for the past five years but he couldn’t. Malfoy was professional at masking his real emotions.
Harry paused eating. If all prefects would be there, then it means Draco Malfoy would be there too, right? His heart immediately thrummed loudly in panic. He didn’t want to deal with Malfoy yet, no, no. His weekends are supposed to be his resting days from all the school's tiring work, not deal with Professor McGonagall's scrutiny, Professor Snape's permanent revolted facial expression, and especially Malfoy's silly Hexes and insults.
Annoyed, Harry tried to tilt his head, while he let Malfoy lean forward first this time. As their lips tentatively touched, ticklish and warm, Harry's soul escaped from his body.
"Are you - " Draco pursed his lip for a second and Harry almost thought Malfoy would ask if he's okay, "your arm, is it usable now?"
After a few minutes of contemplation, he then told them what bothered his mind these days, excluding the bits of Malfoy kissing him inside an empty room. He focused on telling all the nightmares and odd visions of Voldemorts that were barely comprehensible to connect together, but also included bits about Malfoy the other day where Harry and Malfoy fought and ended up throwing themselves together in the disgusting, slimy water of the pool an the Clock Tower Courtyard right after they've found themselves walking their way together towards the bridge to get themselves the hill's fresh air.
we see him. Alright?" Harry said, as if finalizing a remark of their "agreement". They talked as if a contract was binding them, but truly, the sole purpose of this (Harry thought) was to fully reconcile with Draco Malfoy, and Malfoy agreed to the unspoken attempt of Harry to be friends with him - at least acquaintances if all else failed.
He walked and walked per stall then eventually saw a pool of blood flowing like a water from a broken pipe. Harry dashed instinctively towards the blood's direction, heart dropping. He stopped his tracks when he arrived at the stall with the blood, he pulled the door carefully and gaped.
Harry arrived at the conclusion that Draco must have, he hoped he was wrong, attempted suicide from the intensity of his situation. He might've stabbed himself, his mind occupied by negative thoughts.
That particular bothersome prick he was referring, to Harry's annoyance, seemed to be appearing everywhere in his line of vision, which made it harder for him to maneuver his way around the castle.  He declared days ago he would now antistalk Draco Malfoy, learn his schedule to avoid him, who, to his disappointment, had learned to observe Harry back the same way through the course of those three days. Draco would mock Harry, more aggressive in the middle of their rows. As if those weren't enough, sparks of Hexes would be thrown to Harry, always right on the shin or his poor bruise-covered shoulder from hasty first years who flunked their Quidditch tryout. Malfoy had grown fond of leaving Harry excess damage there, and wouldn't stop until it marked
"Stop sulking, Potter." Draco zoomed down the sky elegantly and mounted off Harry's Firebolt, trudging towards Harry who was sitting motionless on the ground, face looking like it was crushed by the sky and ground. "Come on. Race you to farthest loop?"
Harry did think she had the right to be mad. He was mad at himself too for exceeding his temper that led to him and Malfoy having a fist fight. If
"This is exactly what is wrong with you, Scarhead, poking your nose on other people's business while neglecting your own health." Malfoy crossed his arms smugly. "You're going to die at this point if you continue."
And to Harry's further satisfaction not caused by the pound cake, Draco smiled widely at Hagrid and sipped on his steaming tea, clinking teacups with the half-giant. Malfoy may have not shown it, but it was striking on his face that Malfoy rarely received affection and was happy to accept Hagrid's.
"Harry? Are you okay? Ron – what... what happened to Harry?” Hermione's voice was hushed, sounding worried, and she was already done with the task. She tentatively waved her hands in front of Harry, who was, to her dismay, eyes drifting at a spot at the ceiling as if the two spiders creating a web there were that much of an importance. She was careful not to get the attention of Snape who was sauntering around to check their progress as he discussed.
The boy nodded, almost teary-eyed, and tugged Harry's sleeve dragging him out of panic. He followed the boy, his heart sinking as he thought of the endless possibilities what may have caused the incident. Could a Death Eater be behind this? Myrtle herself? He doesn't know. Harry gripped his wand tighter than ever.
Harry snorted. "The hell did I see? Visual hallucinations? I'm not mentally ill, or delusional to get attention, I
He wouldn't call stalking Malfoy his habit, but Harry would find himself constantly restless whenever he would see Malfoy's aggrieved footprint patterns on the map where it had the same route every single day since the start of their winter term, vanishing somewhere his marks wouldn't be spotted on the map and magically return before dusk. He had his growing suspicions about Malfoy ever since the first day back in Hogwarts Draco broke his nose and left him petrified in the train.
Harry was confused, but before he knew it, he was laughing with Ron at the same time despite being not heard from the outside.
“Five little ducks went out one day, over the hill and far away.” He gently moves the baby in rocking motion, rubbing his back and continues to sing. “Mother duck said quack, quack, quack, quack. But only four little ducks came back.”
He opened his eyes in shock and looked down to Henry in an instant to see that the older man already got his eyes on him in surprise.
"Don't be such a brute, Potter." said Draco, unwrapping Harry's hand around him much to Harry's disapproval, and locked his eyes to Harry. "You can, but you can't because I have things to do tomorrow."
Harry brightly beamed at him, and pulled him closer till they're inch apart. “Please say yes, I'll make sure I'll treat you right. You can kill me if I don't.”
“But you believe that we're Harry Potter's sons?” asked Scorpius, feeling a little bit hysterical that they were just granted help from McGonagall herself.
At that, Harry sighed. "I did, actually." he bit his lips, frowning a little before he continued. "Like I said before, professor, we have a theory that the curse was casted in between before and after Draco graduated from Hogwarts. I have given Draco a full body inspection and yet, I found none."
He turned towards Ginny who was running towards him urgently, legs carrying her as fast as she could. There was a large giddy smile carved upon her face that led Harry into confusion. He has never seen those smiles after the War.
Malfoy's face was red with embarrassment that Harry almost felt sorry for him. Almost. He watched in fascination as Malfoy took a deep breath and sent him a mean gaze but Harry only blinked. Malfoy grew frustrated and Harry yelped when he was suddenly pinched on his bicep.
He tried to smile up at her despite feeling as if someone just ripped his heart away. It felt hurt, right there. Draco placed his hand to his heart, trying to ease them down as his other hand reached out the wall to balance himself before his leg giving him out. He saw from his peripheral view as Granger blinked her eyes, wiping the corner of her eyes.
Potter sighed in embarrassment, mumbling something about ‘not supposed to be like this’ as he locked in his eyes with Draco with a firm determination. “I'll repeat again. I think I'm falling in love with you, Draco Malfoy.”
It was hard, at first, for Draco to approach Potter. He can just waltz to the man and claim him, but somehow he doesn't want that. So he chose the hard way method; getting to know Potter step by step.
Harry stared at his friends with his jaw hung loose, gobsmacked, as he asked with a hitched voice. “You noticed?!”
Now they acted like lovers who were newly formed. Harry snorted, "So, may I ask why Malfoy was half naked?"
Their younger dad stopped at that, blinking at Albus in a questioning manner as he asked, "Where's Scorpius?"
Scorpius tugged at Harry's hand, asking for permission as Albus already on his dad's tail. Harry fondly smiled at the small boy, nodding to him to follow his dad. Scorpius grinned and raced off to his twin and dad.
It was when Ron personally dragged him to the common room, when he settled on his bed, when he recalled the kiss for the hundredth time that the thought had finally occurred to him; his culprit was using a strong Disillusionment Charm.
Frustrated; he has decided to put on a desperate measure. He waited in the hidden alcove near the Slytherin's lair, just a few feet before the stairs down the dungeon with his Cloak draped on his body. He knew Malfoy would always take his time getting done before he started his day and he would always be the last one to leave the dungeon, whilst his friends would wait for him in the Great Hall for breakfast. He knew Malfoy would not function properly without his morning tea and Harry had a higher risk of getting hexed to the next decade but he would take what he needed to take.
Harry plopped back to his own bed, dropping a hand to his chest to feel the rhythm of his thunderous heart as he breathes;
Foods forgotten, Harry put his attention towards the boys who were helping themselves with food, while his friends resumed their activities.
Harry answered with a laugh as he bent down to Draco’s awaiting lips. Smiles drawn on their faces as they exchange their kisses on a bright beautiful Sunday morning.
“Don't you dare use that tone on me.” Harry warns and Malfoy lets out a humorless laugh. “Do I look like I care, Potter?” A vicious smirk on his face, eyeing Harry with a cold look.
Harry knew something went wrong when the moment the front gate of the Palace was opened, there was no sight of the two warriors greeting them from the other side of the gate.
“Bloody hell!” exclaimed Ron, widening his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the photo. Harry can't blame him, he can hardly believe it himself. It was a photo of an older Malfoy with the twins who seemed much smaller than they were now.
“I'm fooling myself, really.” Draco forced out a laugh and moved to stand. He took a step to stand in front of Potter and slap the man's shoulder.
“Ah.” Henry grinned, full of amusement that got Draco narrowed his eyes warily. “You can leave those on. You might lose your virginity sooner if you take it off.”
What was he joking, even with all that, Potter won't look at him. He was a straight man. He was just too stupid to keep trying.
“That fucking dick had the balls to touch first years, like a fucking uncivilised people.” Draco says in heavy breaths, “I just had to show him how it feels.”
After a few arguments, and another few arguments about Harry's Invisibility Cloak when Malfoy explained his intention, after Scorpius defended his father saying that he was a huge fan of Harry Potter-
"What, like this?" asked Harry, playfully loosening his arms around Malfoy in an abrupt way and laughed when Malfoy shrieked, glaring at Harry with a disapproval look.
“But to think that someone fancy you enough to make them act to this extent.” Ron whistled, shaking his head as his hands quickly adjusting the blanket when they fell off his shoulder caused by his earlier actions. “Wonder what made him hide his identity.”
Harry gape as he sees Ron throws more words along the lines, Parkinson on his side with a triggered look on her face. Bunch of wands is in her fist and Harry understand now why there's no hexes been thrown. He frowns when he sees a small group of a terrified first years in between them, more when one was hiccuping hysterically as he covers a hand on his cheek.
That was an hour ago and now Ginny and Parkinson went to hunt for food, while Harry, Ron and Zabini took their spot next to the bed doing nothing. The small crowd near the fireplace haven't looked up from the book; Hermione jotting down notes on a parchment as Malfoy doing the same. They will read it while discussing and give each other their insights. The twins latch up on their father as usual, Scorpius pointing out what he has read before while Albus agreed.
"You are such an easily-swindled fuck." Draco pushed Harry's legs to sit between the space of it as he watched Harry sit, barely moving from hunger. "I want to tear you down and make you miserable all your life. That's what I really want."
"Mr. Potter! Mr. Potter!" exclaimed the boy, lack of breath getting in his way of explaining. Harry told him to calm down first. The boy did, and held on Harry's arm after.  "I was – I was about to use Moaning Myrtle's bathroom since our House was too far for my bladder to reach, but – but then… I saw a man in one of the stalls drenched in blood! It was all over the floor. Please,
As his eyes drifted along the length of Draco's arm, there were noticeable red marks all over his wrist, as if randomly done on purpose.
Draco hummed and responded, "Really, I've got nothing to say to the person I've bullied half my life." He looked at Harry. "I didn't say I don't want this. You made my eleven-year old self
"Got it." Harry was grinning and fired up with excitement. He threw Malfoy his wand back. Afterwards, they fought like there was no tomorrow. And he was ducking, rolling, running, jumping with heart at its full pumping speed. After successfully disarming Malfoy in a tiresome ten-minute fight, Harry won the duel, holding Malfoy's wand again in his non-wand arm, a smile of victory spreading on his damp face. He was damn right satisfied crushing Malfoy's ego, and would do it again if given a chance.
"What's it doing to you?" Malfoy hissed, still confused at Harry's now reddened face comparable to an overripe tomato. Malfoy rolled his hips again, and this time, Harry moaned involuntarily. It was a reaction formulated out of the intimacy of the position, and not because it was Malfoy who was
Arriving at the Gryffindor's sixth-year boy's dormitory, Harry sat himself to his bed, seeing that none of his housemates were left in their dorm. He rummaged for his cloak, then waded the folded cloth, wrapping it around himself and made his way all the way down to the Dungeons with the Marauder's map in his hands, avoiding every person he might bump on to. He's going to have to wait for Malfoy to finish his prefect duties in the morning, at the Viaduct, which Malfoy would surely pass by. At least after that, Harry could stalk him freely, without being seen but had the knowledge of what Malfoy was up to.
Pansy smiled at him that was marked fondly. "You're a decent and handsome bloke, the whole Wizarding World wants you head to toe. It's not hard to find a loving girlfriend, you know?"
love-hate relationship gossip! Potter, are you not aware that you and Draco are the hottest blokes wanted in Hogwarts as of this moment? They'd die just to create an issue even if they heard the truth already!
And that was it. He watched Malfoy tip his head forward and gently place his mouth on Harry's lips, closing his eyes. It was that exact moment Harry's world stopped working. He yelped in surprise, even though he had given his consent, mouth ajar as Malfoy transferred the bite of an apple to his mouth. It tasted sweet and it tasted like Malfoy's lips, sensing a bit of sour blood in it that rested on Malfoy's lower lip. It tasted
He sat up his bed and fondled himself on the forehead where he was hurting. It had been a week, he realized. He was not just haunted by his dreams because he was haunted by reality itself.
that did the job, and he knew he wouldn't be able to do it in Malfoy's level even if it hurts for his pride to admit. The blond was advanced.
She ordered a kitchen elf to bring Harry a full meal and asked Malfoy to stay for a while and keep an eye on Harry, which made Harry feel like an utter toddler.
"You and your ways to get to me. So you've successfully captured me through the usage of seduction, lighting up my carnal desire.
Harry's face heated, remembering his failed potion, broken glasses and lost five points. "Why did you bring that up? You were the one who dropped it in my cauldron and told Snape it was me! And – and, I'm
, Harry cussed internally and slowly walked away from the possible view. He should've been more careful around the talkative paintings.
"Let me go, Potter. This is rather pointless isn't it? Nothing would change even if you punch me, or Hex me now. Everything would still remain the same, everything is still twisted as it is. Our faith is still rotten," Draco said.
"It's Saturday," Ginny said, and the Gryffindors started laughing the loudest laugh they could produce. Harry swiveled his head around to look at everyone for a moment and he realized
Harry found it ironic that the Royal Family had the last name Malfoy. Perhaps Draco really was a distant relative of them after all. Harry snorted at the thought.
“Huh?” Harriet asked, still in a daze from the lingering smell of Draca’s perfume. It had smelled expensive, and sweet. “Oh. Er, we aren’t.”
Harry picked Draco up as easy as anything and practically tossed him onto the bed. Draco looked up at him, eyes huge and heated, chest heaving.
Harry raised an eyebrow and considered Draco’s words. “Haven’t been cold at all for the past few days, not sure why. I feel rather warm, actually.”
“I thought maybe you didn’t recognize me, didn’t...but, uh, yeah. I’m the same. I mean, I’m attracted to you, too,” Harry swallowed, adam’s apple bobbing.
The knight cleared his throat. “King’s orders, Your Highness. You must stay here until further notice.”
