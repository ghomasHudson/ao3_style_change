Two days, maybe three, and he would be leaving.
“You don’t do things the Malfoy way anymore, do you?”
Malfoy,” she spat. “You may be an expert in your field, but you aren’t his friend.”
There was a risk in the next bit, a particularly, Gryffindorishly, stupid bit of foolishness. I went to ask the headmistress – to plead with her – to be allowed to leave. Granger and Weasley were the only other possibility and they would never tell me but maybe, maybe, I thought, there was a chance she would at least give me permission to leave. I’d tell her it was a family emergency, that my mother had sent a howler, that it had self-destructed, that I had to leave, would wear a tracking charm, come right back, anything. Anything.
“You have plenty to say about doing good, but it’s just more of the same, isn’t it? Parties and influence and money and getting in with the right sort.”
A ball of light emerged from the tip of Potter’s wand. It was bright and round, and perfectly normal as far as Draco could tell. When Potter ended the spell, it receded back into the wood without incident.
“Try me.”
Beyond the doorway, Draco clears his throat. “If there’s anything else I can do, please don’t hesitate to come again.”
Potter’s resolve visibly crumbled. “I—” He sighed. “Yeah. Okay.”
“About it being pretty alright.”
“No, no.” Draco laughs, low and dangerous. “I’ve had that.” He steps forward again. “I’d rather have something…” his hand is warm, sliding down Harry’s back, “new.” He grips Harry’s arse, squeezes. “Turn around for me.”
He dropped his hand to Harry’s hair again. “Sure?” He panted. “I’m gonna…”
“Again, I appreciate your assistance, and the inconvenience you’ve gone to, which I know has been considerable.”
“Perhaps we could have come to a more collaborative agreement if not for the ridiculous list of conditions that Unspeakable Granger insisted we meet,” Croaker spat.
“Accusations are not necessary, Dr Malfoy. We pride ourselves in the strength of our Auror teams, and that is a well-placed sentiment. But even if Auror Potter were to accept a 24 hour guard, which I highly doubt—” Draco looked to Granger, who nodded her agreement “—we can’t guarantee that we would be able to overcome every threat, every time. If an entire wizarding gang were to descend on his home in the middle of the night with only a standard two-Auror team present, they’d be vastly outnumbered. We would gladly offer that level of security, but it would not be as strong as what he’s got now.”
Luna blinked. “Yes. Of course. There is only one conservationist in England who I trust to handle this correctly. You’ll have to go to Norfolk.”
“Sir, I’m afraid I will have to call Ministry Security if you refuse to leave the premises.”
Draco shifted in his seat. He didn’t quite believe that his posture was responsible for the twisting in his gut, but just to be sure. “They’re yours to name, then.”
“Oh,” Potter said again. “Okay.”
“Harry,” Draco rasped.
“Course.” Draco pressed the tip of his finger through the tight ring of muscle. “Okay?”
“Yes,
He took another step, and then another, until they were face to face. “Trying to find it.”
“You still know that this,” he puts his hand on Draco’s chest, “is as good as it gets.” He doesn’t waver. Doesn’t hesitate. “Took me a dozen men to be sure of it. That no one would fuck me like you do. That no one could.”
“Tried what? Tilting my head? Counting the paint specks?”
Shacklebolt cleared his throat. “I might point out that our host has arrived. Please take your seats.”
Am I angry with him? No. But impatient might be an understatement.
“Yes.” Draco wished he could retroactively take the tremor out of his voice. “I understand. That can be quite a difficult thing to come to terms with.”
Draco rolled it between his fingers, but still didn’t turn.
Again, Draco couldn’t tell whether, or how, he meant it, and ploughed on regardless. “You need to spend more time outside the void. For your immediate and long-term health and, apparently, your sanity.”
“Harry, please.” It was Granger’s turn to interrupt, apparently. “It feels like ages, and we’ve been wanting you to, you know, get out more, and we do worry.”
There’s no response.
“But we just –”
“What do you mean? You just agreed to do it!”
“Always. All of the above.”
“You will?” The words rushed out of Harry in a wave of gratitude and relief.
With the space between them almost gone, Harry could smell Malfoy's cologne on the wool. With Malfoy out of his sight line, he let his eyes flutter shut and imagined what the grain of the wool would feel like against his face.
Seven, when the Muggle security system would flip its locks to manual control. Seven, when they would be free to leave.
“Come in.” Potter’s voice was surprisingly friendly.
“That’s all I’m asking.”
But they couldn’t talk about this. Not here, when the killer might be anywhere, might be able to hear them, and then this would all be for naught. Except from the look of it, he’d been right; Malfoy had a spark to his eye that hadn’t been there before, and it promised fascination at the very least.
“There’s no candy trolley, but it’s not so bad.”
“What sort of work do you handle?”
“Draco. You know there’s something to be said for that. And we’re going out tonight. Greg has an early job, but Pansy and Blaise and I. Come with us. Just for a few hours. Clear your head. You can be back here first thing in the morning. Tell Galder to bring you up a tray at 7, or 6. Whatever you need to do. We’ll get you home early. But come out.”
“He can’t, at a public event. But word on the street is that Mrs Shacklebolt is a huge Daisy Green fan and will be bidding competitively. Plus—” Draco felt her hand dip in and out of his robe pocket “—he may have given me leave to take care of it out of the public view.”
“I wasn’t doing anything that important.”
“Your point?”
Potter’s body is a thing of beauty. I’d always thought he’d be scrawny; perhaps the impressions of our youth don’t leave us as easily as we might like. But three years of Auror training – and, I suppose, a war – have done well by him. His arse is firm and high, his waist trim, back muscled, his legs toned. I’ve never had the opportunity to take him in like this.
“Oh,” Potter stammered. “Right.” He dropped his arms and inhaled before quickly peeling off his top and setting it next to him.
"Actually," Harry leans in, running his thumb over Draco's hands, "I was hoping you would."
He didn’t quite have it in him to laugh, but he did appreciate the softness that crept in around her eyes.
Harry wants to scream. He is very, very tired of obstacles. Too tired for a poker face. Too tired for distance. “Draco, stop!”
He heard Malfoy walk around him slowly, tried to ignore the sensation of being examined from afar. The soft footsteps stopped as Malfoy came to stand behind him in the space between the wingback chairs.
The walk is short and silent.
Potter’s face is flushed and his eyes are red. His hair’s pulled up in even more directions than usual and his jumper’s pulled to one side so his collarbone’s poking out. Draco looks away. It’s a far better alternative than staring, which is proving a hard urge to resist. He’s not used to seeing Potter look so – well, not rumpled. He’s used to that, and Potter doesn’t look any more dishevelled than usual. But he looks anxious. He looks smaller. He looks vulnerable, all pale neck and bowed head.
“Strength,” Harry murmured. “Strength. Okay.”
Plus, there was only one Malfoy, and he wasn’t sure how to put the million pieces he’d just seen back together into one coherent person. Part of him wanted to ask him, but it didn’t seem like the sort of question anyone would be able to answer, and anyway, Malfoy was already off and walking.
Pansy breaks first. “That was a lot of thinking for a one-word answer.”
Harry gasps.
Silence stretches between them. Potter’s pouting, which could go on for years. Draco sighs. “You realise, Potter, that living in a dusty old mausoleum full of things that make you cry is not actually mandatory?”
“Apparently,” Draco interrupted. “Really. Must you?”
He doesn’t take it. Harry shrugs and lets go of it; it’s pure instinct for Draco to catch it.
“I’m on his medical team. You have every right to disclose that information, and one might argue that I have a right to know it.”
He shakes his head. Remembers himself. “No.”
“You were here all night?”
“No.” Draco tries to step back, but Harry's prepared for it. He slips an arm around Draco’s waist, holding him close.
“I didn’t,” Potter interrupted.
“That’s a bit surprising, considering.”
“You can’t keep his whereabouts under wraps for another few weeks, but you can hide the fact that he’s lost all magical ability for the rest of his life?”
I said there was.
“Ah. Yes. That was quite an interesting shape for a key.”
“Just thinking. Preparing.” Draco clears his throat. “Speaking of which, you would do to remember that our agreement involves a certain amount of charm. You are meant to convince people that you like me, that you approve of my company and endeavours.”
“And now you have fewer still.”
Potter stared right at him. “You knew that they were easily provoked. Temperamental. You knew that.”
“So, then?”
The elf obeyed with no outward sign of dissatisfaction. “Prippa will take Master’s cloak if Master pleases. Master will find tea in the music room.”
“So they decided the next logical step was to—?”
Draco’s fingers tighten around the handle.
There was the slightest wobble to Malfoy’s movements as he stepped back. “What?”
“Fuck,” Harry murmurs. He lifts one limp arm to throw it around Draco’s thigh.
“You really helped her.”
Draco’s face and stomach fall in unison. The ice in his voice is entirely genuine. “How many things?”
“Potter.” Draco quickened his pace to catch up. “Join us for dinner tonight.”
“At retrieving household items.”
Granger exhaled a sigh of relief. “Thank you.”
“Who would it be?” If Potter was a doormat for Robards and Croaker, he could damn well be a doormat for Draco too. “The Weasleys?”
His wand flew to his fingers when he reached for it. He dried himself and stepped out of the shower.
“Oh,” Harry exhaled. Had he been holding his breath, Draco wondered? “No, thank you. Bit tired. Afraid it might put me to sleep.”
“You want me to sit around wanting things really badly?” Potter said it, then rushed on as though it was his turn to realise how he might be construed. “When the other stuff is more effective? And easier to access?”
She shook her head to stop him and repeated herself. Looked him straight in the eye and repeated herself again. Said something else that Draco couldn’t quite make out.
“Blaise has suggested that it’s time for Daisy Green to cross over into the Muggle world. Given the subject matter, that may take a bit of adjusting. For instance, my current project,
“Anyway,” he said, voice muffled.
Draco shoves the parchment into a rough pile and frowns down at it. “Welcome to the Vanishing Department. How may we help you?”
And there is. Merlin, there is. He’s wanted to punch it. Wanted to kick it. Wanted to hex it. Wanted to wrap a time-turner around it and undo the web of scars he’s left on Malfoy’s chest. Wanted to make it invisible, irrelevant. Wanted to disappear it. Wanted to wrestle it to the ground and hold it there until Malfoy can’t do anything at all. Until he can’t do anything, for holding Malfoy down.
It was just that he’d reached a point of reassuring himself out loud, and Pansy’s presence made him feel less destined to become one of those portraits that earned eternal exile to the attic.
“That’s all we’ve been able to discern from what we’ve gotten so far. Now you strip, I fuck you, and we hope the snake tells us the rest.”
“Yes.”
“As I take yours.”
“No,” Harry sighed. “Or not only. I suppose it might feel simpler if it was, though. Everything else is stickier. Is it better to leave, or to stay and fight to be who I want to be, where I want to be?”
“I don’t mind saying I agree with you if it means doing what’s in his best interest.”
I chance a deeper thrust this time, and he gasps. Holds me closer.
Looking queasy, the corps did as they were told.
Harry flushed. “Doesn’t work. It’s not enough to... there has to be, you know,
"Neither do you." It wasn't his best, but if Malfoy wanted to talk about fighting like they were eleven...
Draco wished Blaise weren’t quite so correct, or that he wasn’t so unnerved at the prospect of Potter’s—all of their, really—disapproval. “Is Luna Lovegood still with them?”
They must’ve taken the same seats, but Croaker, Weasley, and Granger had stood out of theirs and were pointing fingers, both figurative and literal, over the table. Shacklebolt and Millie watched with almost identically calm expressions, though Millie’s betrayed a hint of amusement. Robards had his head in his hands and was massaging his temples aggressively.
She sighed and pulled out the seat nearest his. “Yes.” She dropped into it. “And I’d guess we agree that it’s a shit choice. But it’s not ours to make.”
Again. I drive into him, he arches and grabs my arse and lets out one of those beautiful, unearthly, moans. And again, and again. I’m sweating too, now, can feel it as our bodies slide together, but no power on this earth could stop me from pounding into this unbelievable arse.
Potter looked like he was actively working to keep amusement at bay. “You’re pulling my leg.”
V          V          V          V          V
– Dead. Azkaban.
“That wasn’t a very good question,” Luna mused. “Do you feel satisfied?”
Then there’s always Harper. One of the few proper Slytherins who knows to look up to his elders. Pansy’s had her eye on him and rumour has it he’s almost completely inexperienced. Nothing so sweet as a virgin arsehole, and Pans would be furious not to get there first. Casting a few aspersions between rounds would only be efficient, really. And she gets so lovely and flushed and fuckable when she’s angry.
Curiosity, perhaps? But what about? Draco is aware that he's reasonably attractive. He has no trouble pulling on the rare occasions when he tries to. His partners are generally far more interested in a repeat performance than he is, and who knows what animates the Golden Boy’s fantasies? But if that is the nature of Potter’s interest, why the vanishing act? The repeated vanishing act? Even by Potter’s standards, it's inexplicable.
“’Cause no,” he breathes, pushing my hand towards his waistband.
“Describe it back to me?”
No, Draco doesn’t mind at all. He’s fairly certain his teenaged id is pretty fucking pleased, as a matter of fact.
Harry doesn’t verbalise his response, just sinks down onto Draco’s cock. The salty tang at the back of his throat may be new but it’s not unwelcome, nor is the thick heat that fills his mouth.
Harry cleared his throat. “Thank you.”
Blaise chuckled. Pansy grinned, back to her own voice. “Truly, unthinkable even five years ago!”
Harry smiled, faint but genuine. “Yeah.”
“Was flying south for the winter. Only about twenty of them winter here, and Edgar’s magic would make the long flight easier for him. The presence of spoonbills in the UK is still a bit hush-hush; it’s less likely that he was hunted than that he ran into a bit of bad luck and encountered a hunting party that mistook him for game. That would explain the presence of buckshot. If he put himself into a defensive stasis—they can do that,
“Fine,” She said. “Sit down, Potter, would you? I’m hungry.”
“Oh, for – it was a house. Alright? My house.”
“The wool didn’t do anything to you.” She raised an eyebrow. “And mauling it won’t solve any problems. Make any particular houseguests appear.”
“Harry.”
Draco followed her into the dim main corridor that led down the East Wing, past a dozen dozing portraits, the doors to the ballroom, the drawing room, a trick staircase. She turned into the music room without giving him a second glance. He paused for a steadying breath before closing the distance and turning in after her.
Fortunately, it’s rarely put to the test. Draco works in Research and Development, Harry in Special Operations, and never the twain shall meet, outside of the holiday party and the quarterly meetings, neither of which is small enough to force anything. Harry occasionally hears that Draco’s invented something new, and Draco occasionally mentions a project that Harry later recognises in updates to their commissioned gear, but they are, for all work-related intents and purposes, former acquaintances.
“Human contact? Pulp free mimosas?”
“His letter came across my desk. He doesn’t agree.”
“I bet you mean that as a compliment.”
Or else it is Potter and it’s only a matter of time before he wanders back here like he owns the damn place, and Draco’s in no fit state for that.
It rang, the sound reverberating through the studio.
“Good. Very good.” He thought, for a moment, that Potter bristled at that. But that wasn’t quite right.
“I was there. That was enough.”
He’s bent over the handle, shooting forward, before he can finish the thought.
But I’d figured they'd send the Aurors, whose wool robes, heavy boots, and adherence to protocol would've given me a good head start. I figured I'd already become sufficiently practised at slipping between the shadows. I’d counted on it being late fall, leaves brown and barely clinging to their branches, cold enough that even the robust, backslapping red-robes sought harbour in doorways and fought for regular patrols near the Leaky.
There’s a long nervous pause, after which Draco murmurs, “Gryffindor.”
“Upstairs.” Harry points at the staircase behind him.
Draco blinked, trying to clear his head. “Yes,” he said. “More than. Just a bit overwhelmed, actually.”
You come each week to move and sweat and be. There’s no one here you know and no one who knows you. There are men and you meet them and you suck them and you fuck them but to meet is not to know. To fuck is not to know. You like it like that.
“I’m a writer. Full of imagination.”
“No, Potter. Tell me or I’ll stop.” He drove his fingers as deep as he could to punctuate the point.
“So?” Potter snorts. “Go on then, Malfoy. Show the world the kind of operation you’re running.” His eyes flare. “It’s exactly what your father would’ve wanted.”
Harry stared, just for a moment, and then wrapped a hand around it and brought it to his mouth. The corners of his lips stretched as he sank onto it, and then Malfoy's hand was back on his head, guiding him deeper down and holding him there. Harry sucked and Malfoy moaned, deeply enough that Harry could feel it. He exhaled and began to bob his head, thrilling as his forehead grazed the buttons of Draco's waistcoat on the way down.
Malfoy barked a single laugh. “No. But that seems to have been rather a problem, historically. That or caring about the wrong things.”
“A Pensive,” Draco affirms.
“Oh, for – What is it, Potter?”
Harry scoured the rest of the drawings. Some were barely outlines. Some were sheets of parchment covered in runes, some of which Harry had never seen before, and some of which he’d come to know all too well. Others depicted the crime scenes in astounding detail, down to things Harry had thought he’d forgotten.
’s, for the sake of circulation, you see, if they might be able to provide readers with a few more pertinent details, or perhaps a confir—”
“You’re mad,” Potter exhales.
Draco swallows. Nods.
“Was there any ambiguity whatsoever in ‘No. Never.’? Need I repeat myself?”
Harry slid to the floor and crossed his legs.
Harry nodded. “Yes. So... do we…?” He gestured towards the door to the bedroom.
He swallows and Draco withdraws his hand. “Good. Sleep.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes,
“In spirit, yes. But technically, you purchased the blindfold while I ordered the handcuffs.”
“Nothing that would bind, otherwise constrain, or injure.”
“I don’t,” Draco insists.
Walking behind Harry had the odd effect of obscuring the intent behind people's stares. He couldn't tell at first if people were gawking at him or at Harry. Or, for that matter, Harry Potter the war hero or Harry Potter who looked like he could take out half of Hogsmeade with a glance. But as they moved through the atrium, he became fairly certain when the stares came into focus, recognised the colour of his hair and the sharp line of his jaw as Malfoy and turned into sneers and threats… those were for him alone. He wished he could revert to his wartime autopilot, but it had been too long. He was too used to meeting stranger's eyes in greeting, even though there wasn't any sign of welcome in the ones he saw now. The few that didn't seem to notice who he was provided some relief, but those few who gave him smiles—dripping with obsequious, vulgar greed—were worst of all. He'd rather be cut openly than drooled over, and the whispers in the lift were nothing to the presumptuously knowing smirk Marcus Flint gave Draco as he came down the corridor outside the courtroom to hear his older brother speak.
Still, Draco had not the slightest inkling of anything other than his own mounting nausea. They’d discovered a pattern, a serial killer’s pattern, and it required calling Draco into a heavily warded conference room with the heads of the DMLE’s two most important departments and one of their star Aurors.
“The cars, too. Did you know that the Bentley Continental Flying Spur can reach double the speed of a Nimbus 2002?
“That’s why, in the next year, we hope to expand our community support initiatives. We want to go beyond the services we can provide at our centres in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. We hope to open a service centre in Manchester by the end of the summer; to supply counsellors at Hogwarts for children who have been affected by growing up with survivors or who have survived other types of trauma; to be able to provide in-home support for individuals and families who are struggling; and to expand our policy initiative, working hand-in-hand with the Ministry to create laws that account for the widespread incidence of post-traumatic stress in wizarding Britain, and to provide opportunities for recreation and community-building. And if you happen, as I am—” he grinned at the rapt crowd “—to be a fan of Kneazles and Crups, you may be interested to know that we’re also working with Hogsmeade Animal Rescue to start a companion animal programme.”
Harry pauses so long it’s almost a hesitation, but he keeps going. The aglet at the end of the tie almost catches every time, but Harry keeps at it, slowly. Wonderfully slowly.
at him for a moment, and then Harry nods, and the nod turns into a smile, and Draco smiles back, and shakes his head in disbelief, and then he slides halfway back out of Harry’s arse, and pushes forward, into Harry, twice as hard. And Harry arches and moans, low and throaty, and digs his fingernails into Draco’s shoulder blades and holds on for dear life.
“And how. I’d do almost everything differently.”
“The trial period was six months. There was no significant improvement in any of those cases and no reason to expect any. I gave them new implants and sent them on their way.”
Potter clenched his jaw. “Are we done here?”
“No brooms?” Harry repeats, confused. “Then how—?”
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco sighs. “You know I can’t take time out today.”
Draco let his arms drop, then. He stood in front of Harry, arms at his sides.
She nodded, and had barely closed the door behind her when Potter exploded out of his seat. “One hour?!” He looked over his shoulder and lowered his voice, though his ire was clear. “
“We’re not flying. Just throwing the ball around.”
“Yes,” he scoffed. “Of course. Not exactly the kind of thing a person wants advertised.”
“You can’t just bring them over?”
“The Minister?” Draco asked, still trying to piece together the events of the last hour. “Did you know Potter…. did that? Could do that?”
He only realised he’d stopped breathing when his head began to pound. He backed away, then, gripping his wand tight between his fingers. He scrambled to the hearth and, looking over his shoulder for movement, whispered Ron’s name into the Floo.
. Then the tart throws down a pile of magazines, perches on my desk, and directs me to cover of
She relieved him of the latter problem. “I was beginning to wondering whether the message had been waylaid or you’d got lost. It has been—how long, is it, since you’ve been here?”
Draco sighed. “Yes.”
“Moving too quickly for you? Do you need more time to cry over recovered armoires?”
Harry does, hem dragging and wet socks smacking against the floor with every step. He hopes Malfoy can’t hear it, though the tightness of Malfoy’s shoulders suggests otherwise.
Draco hummed and put the wand away, contenting himself at some tiny sign of backbone from Potter in lieu of getting Potter to actually cast. “Fine.” He turned down a slate path that would take them deep into the terrace gardens. “Did you read those articles?”
“Mistress,” Prippa sobbed, “Mistress says Master is coming home and is making things change. Mistress does not know if she will have to leave!”
It was really stupid of you, Draco. Really stupid and a little bit brave. She would’ve just grazed me but you, moving in the path of the spell like you were and kind of sideways, and closer to her, it got you all the way from shoulder to hip in an instant.
I had to keep my eyes on him through it all. He seemed to glow even in the fading sunlight, the pinks glancing off what was left of his tan and making him seem to burn with it. His mouth was open, his jaw working as he gasped for air. His eyes had been screwed shut, and I almost stopped at the force of his gaze when he opened them.
Again, Draco tries to interject, but finds himself without the chance to get a word in edgeways. Which is for the best, since he doesn’t really have anything to say.
Another dark flight of stairs, then he pushed against the edge of a gilded frame to reveal a staircase, flooded with light, smooth and bare, free of the dusty carpet that covers the rest of the house. I walked up first, into the attic.
Draco is very rarely speechless. And yet.
Draco began to work towards a rhythm. He watched Harry still, but let himself feel the tight heat around his fingers. His cock jerked at the feeling, at the thought of being inside of it.
Potter moaned and rolled his hips again, whining when he met with Draco’s knuckles instead of his prick.
He doesn’t really have anything to say.
“Please, Potter, do continue. I’m rather enjoying your imitation of an angry Quaffle.”
“Like—” Draco’s anxiety wants to finish the sentence for him, wants to fill in the blank with “a million Galleons” or “a trip to Bangkok.” But those things are a way out. That’s not what he’s scared to say. So he lets his eyelids flutter shut and opens his mouth and says, “You.”
I relax my throat, try to take him down. Something that usually undoes him, and it has no effect.
“You want me to throw first. I won’t.”
“Oh, yes, of course. Hermione told me that the first day. I don’t though. Withdraw my consent, I mean. A walk is fine.”
“It’s,” he rolls his hips, meeting me on a thrust, “all right.”
He moved his hands to Harry’s waistband, to the top of his flies, and fumbled to slip the button free without moving too far away. Pressed together as they were, he could feel the outline of Harry’s cock under his knuckles. He didn’t bother, didn’t want to bother, with holding back. He turned his hand, slid his fingers over the bulge.
“We in the Minister’s Office would strongly encourage you to seriously consider this meeting.”
Would that he could burn them himself. So much more satisfying to see the destruction than to imagine it. But these, at least, will make a worthwhile sound.
Potter ignored him. “Why? Why did they do that? They wanted this.”
“I heard you.”
Harry took a deep breath and continued. “
“I’d usually agree with you,” Draco conceded. “But I’ll ask you to do it with a twist.”
“Putting us in on the front page for the third day in a row, Granger. The development committee is hardly complaining.”
Draco plasters on his sweetest smile. “Oh, of course. Pray tell, Potter, what are your problems, exactly? I shall endeavour to do my very best to solve them all.”
It wasn’t like that at all. The moment we touched it was…well. I lost my footing and almost fell, and he stepped on my foot in the rush to catch me. He seemed torn between mortification and amusement, as though he wanted to laugh but didn’t dare risk it. I’m rather glad he didn’t. It’s not that I’ve never been laughed at before, and there’s no rational reason as to why it would’ve been any more wounding in that moment, but I’m glad he didn’t. Besides which, we wound up with his arm around my waist and my hand gripping his bicep, and it was as good a point as any from which to proceed. Fortunately, my instincts hadn’t abandoned me even if my balance had, and I asked him if he wanted to move to the bed to avoid grievous bodily injury.
“More,” Harry pleads. “Merlin, more.”
Potter watched him, and looked to be breathing a bit more easily, but still didn’t respond.
“But you still would’ve been a wizard.”
’s printing my receipts from Honeydukes. You think I didn’t notice that?”
The moment the door clicks shut, Draco flips over the parchment and begins to write.
“I have a meeting with the Vice-Chancellor Monday morning.”
“I know. But Potter doesn’t. If he’s going off the evidence, he’s got every reason to think this is all some grand deception. Or worse.”
“Are you?” Harry let his lips pull into a smile. “Prickly enough for it.”
Phillips has set up an array of devices while Robards and Proudfoot trade cordialities with the woman from R&D and congratulate Draco on his work. Harry shifts his weight from foot to foot, responding when spoken to, trying not to be too obvious in examining the strained note behind Draco’s thanks.
He barely manages to summon the bin in time. Even once his stomach is thoroughly emptied, part of him wishes he could keep going, that he could rid himself of these feelings right along with the Scotch.
“What is it?”
“No.” Draco’s only ever been able to lie to Potter at a distance.
“Ah.” Draco acknowledges, without moving to take it. “Thank you.”
“If you’re going to do any sort of Ministry work you have to,” Draco mumbled.
“Evening.” Millie smiled, hooking her arm through Blaise’s. “You remember Blaise.”
Draco’s eyelids flutter shut and he takes a deep breath. “Yes?”
“Just the vase.” Potter gave Granger a quelling look. “Just trying to be thorough, that’s all. Ron and Seamus and I were out drinking and got it in our heads to drop in on Hermione, see if we could convince her to join us—her and Millie, they were going over some report or other—and I broke a vase. Not even sure it was magic and not a bit of drunken clumsiness.”
“And?” Draco repeated, the tatters of his stomach seeming to settle into a leaden crypt at the bottom of his gut. This didn’t seem to be going in any predictable direction at all, and that was almost worse than waiting for certain doom.
“Might be.” Potter managed half a shrug.
“You own a newspaper. You own publicity.”
He nodded miserably.
“Mister snake? You’re not speaking Parseltounge.”
“Or,” Draco lowers a finger from Harry’s thigh to the crease of his arse, “to lick you.”
“Okay.” Harry hesitated. He closed his eyes and barely took a few seconds to focus. “
Draco rose to stand. “It’s who you are.”
“Mmmm,” Harry agreed. “Yeah.” He took a tiny sip. Hesitated. “He’s been asking me to think about that a lot. What I want.”
Nothing against Robards himself. It’s the news that Harry will have to do another round of Draco’s trials that sets him on edge. Seeing Draco—
Madame Pomfrey says you’re going to be out of it a while longer. Pansy’s spell cut pretty deep and you lost a lot of blood. Some damage to your internal organs, too. There’ll be a big scar this time. I bet you’ll hate that, but it was just too late and took too long to get you here.
“For publicity, yes.”
He thanked her for the second time in one day. She didn’t look any less surprised, though it was cut short by Millie’s insistence that he move.
“Master Draco, sir?” The elf sounded tentative and just a bit afraid. Or perhaps concerned? Between Weasleys and Ministry types and the maddening puzzle of Potter’s condition, Draco was almost past being able to tell the difference.
The click of the door echoes between them.
She pulls a hand back and looks as though she might be winding up for a slap. Draco refuses to flinch. But instead of landing a blow she grabs the item in question and shoves it into her robes. “You haven’t heard the last from me, I assure you!”
“Er, yes sir.” Higsbee doesn’t leave. “But they’ll want to know, down in F and L, where it came from.”
Draco only managed to suppress a moan because he was staring straight into Potter’s eyes.
) and please leave them some love!!
Across the room, Malfoy flitted from group to group, laughing and chattering and making introductions. He was tall and lean and impeccably dressed in a slim grey suit over a pale blue jumper that looked soft even a dozen yards away, and loafers shined to such a luster that they seemed to reflect each individual track light as Malfoy zigged and zagged across the wooden floor.
“No,” Draco pauses. “Of course not. How silly of me.” He turns back to the shelving, then peeks over his shoulder at Potter. “I suppose you don’t have any feelings about lace, either?”
He wraps the parchment around an eagle owl’s extended leg. It’s not as tidy as his usual correspondence, but that’s hardly the kind of thing Potter will notice.
“The flower one?” Harry said, incredulous.
“Don’t crush the creature, for fuck’s sake. Give it here.”
“Doors?” Potter squinted. “The one at the end, maybe, but those are definitely faces. Look, the red dots are eyes, and the blue lines are a mouth. Maybe the one at the end is a door.”
Potter’s hand is on his arm. “Hey.”
He smirks. I let him.
His jeans were too thick, too constricting. He wanted them off. He took Malfoy’s hand and put it on his top button.
“I have?”
Or not. “I really am sorry. Didn’t mean to remind you, especially at work and all. Because, I know that you miss it. Whether you want to admit it or not.”
Draco gave an exaggerated sigh. “I might notice if you were putting it to more interesting—fuck.”
“Have you been crying?”
“It’s hardly the same thing,” Robards blustered. “Rookwood was a wanted criminal. Auror Potter is a—”
He pulls at one, letting it fall open. “And this? Is this yours?”
Hosting this part of the show had been the easiest decision Draco had made since the Dark Lord crossed the threshold of his childhood home. He’d courted the artists’ collective for half a year before they’d agreed, and once they did he’d had the paperwork drawn up within the day. He’d badly wanted a garden somewhere on the property, but having an open roof had been out of the question; the odds were too high that wizarding types would appear there out of nowhere, stranded and possibly splinched by the anti-Apparition charms the Ministry had put in place.
At that Harry grinned, and all Draco knew was the press of Harry’s body against his own.
He clenches around my fingers. “Don’t stop fucking me.”
“Yes, if we must. Do I get to pick the restaurant this time?”
“Course!” Ron scrambled, and looked to Hermione, then Malfoy, then Harry, then back to Hermione. “I’m, um, just saying, love, that some things come more easily when you’ve grown up doing them. Nothing to do with blood.”
Printing the photos would take Jordan down a peg. A well deserved reprisal after the glory hound insisted on going to work for Draco’s competitors. It would look awfully bad for a man who’s made his name in investigative journalism to be caught in an illicit dalliance with the Deputy Head Auror. Depreciate the WWN’s investment in Jordan’s contract, perhaps considerably. It all sounds amusing enough for a Monday morning, in any event.
“Yes, as I’ve said.” Draco pivots away from Potter and takes a left two aisles past knives.
“Yeah.” Harry hesitated. “Got—”
Harry compensated. “
“Right now?” Surely, he’s plenty of suitors. I’ve seen him at the clubs, seen how they fall all over him.
The idea is more palatable than the last, until he remembers that Potter might not respond, and he can’t tolerate the idea of waiting indefinitely for a letter that may or may not arrive.
!” A silver wisp erupted from his wand and began to take shape before falling to the ground.
“No,” he says, and the syllable is broken in half when his breath catches.
?” Hermione frowned. “I don’t know that one.
“I don’t appreciate your sarcasm.”
Without so many people in the building, it smelled better to him. Less like sterility and money, more like wood and a faint, oily sort of scent that reminded him of Mr Weasley’s shed. His shoulders relaxed a bit as he breathed it in and kept walking.
Twenty-seven days after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry goes to the Ministry. He has a meeting with Kingsley but he doesn’t make it through the Atrium. There are a hundred people calling his name, crowding around him so thickly he can’t take a step. They all say the same things: “our hero,” “we love you,” “we need you.”
Draco fought to assimilate their reminders. “You didn’t tell me about the tax bit. Or Croaker and Robards’ interests.”
“Tell me,” Malfoy repeated. “Tell me how well your plan works out.”
Galder popped into view before Draco’s not-quite-date could finish the thought. The elf bowed low. “Master returns, with guest.”
He was clearly a first-timer. It was sloppy work. Inconsistent and too wet and a few scrapes of his teeth had me arching more in fear than pleasure. He squeezed my bollocks too roughly and moved too quickly and applied so much suction at times that I felt like he might’ve mistaken my cock for a sugar quill.
Potter’s cheeks coloured. “No. Safety.”
“It’s like you think it’s the end of the world, being without magic. But it isn’t. There’s still this.”
“You—of course you did. Of course. Are you taking care of all the details, then? Walking him to the gallows?”
“Boots, Potter.”
He nodded, and Draco could make out what he said, too: “Okay.”
“Right. Lead the way.”
Granger leaned forward tentatively. “Dr Malfoy, I don’t mean any disrespect either, but is that up to you? If Harry wants to leave?”
“Tell me.”
It’s enough, just enough, to send Potter jumping back out of reach. He’s gasping and flushed and trying his damnedest to look sceptical. “What’re you doing, Malfoy?”
She nodded and, with another single click over the threshold and the sound of the door shutting, excused herself.
“Let’s work up to that. There was a bin across the street.”
“No!”
“Fine. I could cast.” He hesitated. “I realised I kept my wand again yesterday.”
Draco barely suppressed a victorious shout. “And certainly, given some of the things she said to you last night.”
“What happened to tables?”
“Drinking, dancing, blowing off steam. Anything more? Oh, Salazar and Helga both. I just don’t bloody want to. It’s maddening.”
Draco turns towards him, willing himself not to blink, not to smile, not to give anything away. “Established that you’re capable of making it through a full hour in my department without fleeing. Well done.”
Harry gripped the back of Draco’s neck and pulled him into another searing kiss. “Come inside me.”
“Adequate. Acceptable. Passable.
“Not a clue.”
“Did,” Draco repeated.
“I think it turns out they’re not so different after all.”
He looks up at the clock and rolls his eyes. It’s only 10:15. It’s only Tuesday. It’s only community service hour 6,410 out of 10,000. Another seventy-five minutes of sorting and cleaning and labeling and storing to do before lunch. And on Tuesdays he has to water all the plants and dispose of whatever’s rotted, and then there’s logging items and addressing requests.
“Three days?”
“Harry?”
He kicks off, tearing after Harry, pulling up short to look down the aisle.
“I would. And would ask Ms Bulstrode for her assistance towards those ends, if that’s any reassurance.”
Draco was relieved to see Shacklebolt looking a bit less like a ravenous Acromantula.
“Let me touch you,” Harry breathes. “Please.”
I ask you, also, to consider the means by which this law is to be enacted after the initial drive to register. Imagine, if you will, your own Sorting.” He laughed softly and shared a smile with Susan Bones. “Several among your number will remember mine. I certainly do. Sitting on the Great Lake as the castle loomed into view. Entering those doors for the first time—how huge they seemed then!” He laughed again and lowered his voice conspiratorially. “I could hardly imagine them opening or closing at the time.
“The point was also to keep you safe.”
By the time Harry gets to the top, Malfoy’s settled on a doorway. He’s down to his trousers, the top button undone, waiting in the doorway with a hip cocked to one side and his arms folded.
“No need.”
The front office is empty. His stomach flips. Draco’s not there. He’d started to be, most of the time, like he was waiting for Harry. Not that he
With a deep breath, he tries it all at once, pushing himself forward so his feet flip over his head and he rushes towards the ground.
Harry shook his head. “No. Just new.”
He’d started writing Malfoy a letter the day after Luna’s dinner, but he hadn’t been able to figure out what to say. “Were you in love with me?” sounded mental. “I’m sorry if I hurt you” sounded insincere, but taking out the “if” made it presumptuous.
“And the snitch?”
Draco does, but he’s not saying it. Couldn’t say it—or anything else—even if he wanted to.
“You didn’t do the basic due diligence to make sure I did?”
"Oh, Potter." Malfoy shook his head, setting the paper down.
“You know what will happen if you stay in the void. Long-term.”
Harry moaned.
The photos. The photos, which feature Potter doing this exact same thing with someone else. With Lee Jordan, whom Potter has been so eager to protect.
“Oh, shut up, Potter. Spread your fucking legs and bring me your hole.”
The server appeared again. Draco, for the first time in many years, was on the verge of cursing the number of courses involved in a meal. Except that it let him gather his thoughts.
There was a pause. “Thank you.”
Fucked. I was already fucked.
they Vanish something.”
Knows it for sure when Harry looks at him and whispers, “Draco, please.”
“I would come up to your flat even if there were coconut.”
“Okay.” Harry frowned, but closed his eyes again and steadied his breathing to focus. “
As an area of mutual interest, Quidditch may be a useful icebreaker, especially because it gets him out of Granger’s grasp. Her presence foils most of the other obvious alternatives – he doesn’t need a tutor in any of his subjects, he isn’t wanting for company or support, and she seems to automatically anticipate the vast majority of his and Weasley’s needs. But I’ve made some inquiries to Blaise about upcoming social engagements, and fully anticipate making headway shortly.
“No,” Hermione agreed, starting to dissolve into giggles. “It really wasn’t.”
“It was on a high shelf,” Granger insisted.
Reflex takes over. Harry rolls to one side to dodge the spell, tumbles out of it and leaps into the air. He wills himself to move towards Proudfoot and tackles her to the ground before he’s even thought of it.
A response came that evening. Harry, restless from pacing the house, almost jumped out of his skin when an owl tapped at the window.
Harry inclined his head. “Okay, then. To the conservatory?”
He wonders how many other men Harry’s reduced to incoherence. How many men he’s got down on his knees for. Made moan. It’s almost enough to stop Draco. To make him pull Harry to his stupid feet and kick him right back out into the ballroom.
Across the table, Malfoy nattered on blithely. There had been, Harry learned, a cold front coming in from Wiltshire that had pushed a seasonal wind current towards London, and it was usually a particularly warm current, and Malfoy had missed it completely when, apparently, the meteorolowizard on the WWN had not only predicted a cold front, but had advised that the mixture of cold and warm air would produce showers across London, and Malfoy had been caught completely unprepared, soaked through too quickly to even cast an
Because, of course, the sex is phenomenal.
He was rambling on, about how it was plain and he knew it wasn’t much to look at yet, but it was clean and he promised the sheets were good, not that I had to, not that…he out-flustered himself. Just sort of ran out of things to say and stood there, scuffing the toe of his trainer against the bare wood floors, his hands tucked in his pockets.
He chanced another glance at Potter, who was watching him intently. Curiously. Hopefully, even.
It doesn’t matter. It wasn’t.
Five minutes later, he turns it back, realising he hadn’t actually read it before turning it over. He starts again.
Unfamiliar because it was, in fact, Draco Malfoy’s armrest. Draco lifted his head off of Harry’s chest, blinking the sleep out of his eyes and, as soon as they were open, groaned again, lifting a hand from Harry’s bare thigh to cover his face.
“Of course.” It’s automatic, defensive. Even if he’d been so shocked by it all that Harry’s actual words had sort of washed over him at the time. “I hear perfectly well.”
The hen was quite good and Draco gave himself a minute or two to focus on that, until forks and knives around the table had been set down. Draco followed suit, and their dinner dishes were replaced with dessert plates bearing fruit tarts.
"A first year," Harry repeated back, deadpan.
“Such as?”
When he got back to the office, he tried again.
“I thought a lot about it,” Harry admitted. “Including the reasons not to. It’s just… All of the things I said before, they’re true. And I think the things you said are, as well.”
“Breakfast
“Harry,” Draco sighs, though it’s fond. “You know it’s end of term. It’s a zoo.”
“I don’t understand. You will, but you won’t, because you can’t?”
Merlin, Draco didn’t want to. He hadn’t wanted to care at eleven years old, standing in front of Potter with his hand outstretched. Hadn’t wanted to care at twelve, when he thought he’d bested Potter at duelling, only to have Potter become the talk of Hogwarts. Hadn’t wanted to care at sixteen, when he lay awake in the hospital wing feeling his skin knit itself back together after Potter’s
Harry startles. “Oh, I.” His voice is still raspy. He swallows. “I, no. I can. Just need my clothes and then I can, if you want I can…” He waits, hoping Draco won’t finish his sentence, won’t give him that word,
He shouldn’t have got up. He should’ve Transfigured the orange tree into a bodhi tree and stayed there until he became one with it, until the concerns that plagued his every waking moment drifted off into some cosmic sea. Nothing he’d said or done would convince Potter in that reality, either, but at least it wouldn’t sting quite so sharply.
Potter’s maddening mask of politeness fell back into place. “Can I help you?”
“You didn’t. You wanted to live.” Harry stared down at the boards as he walked, worried that whatever he might see on Draco’s face could stop him talking. “And you said once that you wanted to see the Dutch masters, because you’d only ever been taught about the Italians. I don’t know if you even remember that.”
“Once filed, the Office of Boring Paperwork will reply by owl to confirm your request within seventeen business days.”
“I’m sure the floors appreciate it.”
Draco’s chest tightened defensively. “I’m a wizard. Being a pureblood has nothing to do with my feelings about that.”
“Think of it this way: I’m asking you on a date.”
“Mmm.” Harry hummed into his mouth.
Above them, the bird suddenly stirred and began to move its healthy wing.
“Is it?” Harry said, his cheeks starting to resemble his house colours.
character under discussion, who could ever compete with the perfect saviour, the Chosen One, the—”
“It always hurts a bit,” I offer, after a moment’s silence. “Burns. But if it’s worth it...”
“It is,” Malfoy said. “Just last week, we were able to isolate the strand of the curse that is coercive from the strand of the curse that encourages speech.”
“I’m glad you have some appreciation for life’s finer things.”
“Merlin, Potter. Do you just store boggarts around for fun? Is this your special boggart wardrobe?”
Potter knit his brow. “You already know what’s in the letter?
“Thank you.” Potter nodded, but didn’t move to leave.
“The sugar, Draco, really?”
Draco knew the room was designed for an echo, to make it sound as vast as it looked. He’d made good use of it on more than one occasion, jumping or stomping or sliding across the mirrored floors to hear the sound of his own movement reverberating around him. There had been times he’d been so nervous he felt as though he might float out of his body, and that sound had always brought him back.
It’s a pleasure he denies me. He has eyes for my trousers, my dress shirt, for the two buttons I’ve left undone and the skin between them. Perhaps I should be unsurprised that his attention doesn’t extend to impeccable interior decorating.
And he’s the homosexual. Well, more or less, apparently.
Harry couldn’t hear any more of Malfoy’s voice, after that. He pictured Malfoy’s face travelling through shock and anger and resentment and cold fury.
Harry shifted uncomfortably and tried not to wish the bird had hit McSullivan. “It’s bleeding. And it can’t have that much blood to begin with. So. I’d better go in a bit of a hurry.” He took a wide step around McSullivan, barely avoiding the fingertips grasping at his coat. “Apparition point’s that way!” He pointed a shoulder at the park down the street and took off at a clip, disappearing behind his Fidelius charm as quickly as he could manage.
offices. Though it doesn’t much matter; his staff are so well-versed in avoiding him at this point that there’s no one left to hide it from.
The intercom on his desk buzzed and saved him from his thoughts. Or might've, had it not been Kate to tell him Potter had arrived.
“Kitchen.” Draco pointed behind him and kissed Harry’s jaw. “Bathroom.” He rotated his arm further back and moved to Harry’s earlobe. “Other rooms.” He waved vaguely around, then gave Harry’s shirt another tug. “Bedroom?”
“Yes,” Draco conceded. “I did.”
It was late enough in the year that the sun was just peaking over the buildings. It spun a thin golden light, which was amplified by gleaming storefronts and filled the street with a pale, rosy glow. Draco heard lorries unloading up by the Tesco Express and the curry house. He saw Mrs Hughes across the way readying the till. A cyclist was taking advantage of the relatively empty streets for a morning ride.
“I also hear that your innovations with Shrivelfig have made a real difference in the teaching of O.W.L.-level potions as well.”
“However, I am assured that the matter is pressing. When are you free to meet?”
Harry’s eyes widened at the sharp edge to Malfoy’s voice, but annoyance won out. “I told you, it’s not enough to shove something in there, and you can bet your arse I wouldn’t be here if that’s all it took.”
“Yeah,” Potter rasped, his eyelids fluttering again and, finally, peaking open. He looked at the apple in Draco’s hand, watched Draco as he lifted it and took a bite.
“I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want,” Harry repeated. “Some things that it’s been difficult to realise. Not because I don’t think they’re true or I’m uncertain of them. I am. Certain of them, I mean. More because they were unexpected. I didn’t know what to do with them.” He half-laughed. “I’m not sure I do.”
Potter shrank back. “Including casting?”
He’s right. Potter’s cottoned on enough to look dreadfully uncomfortable but, aside from offering a particularly thin half-smile and shuffling half a step backwards, he doesn’t seem prepared to do much about it.
“Since when are you so bashful?”
And when it’s a note that simply reads, “
Potter opened his mouth.
The real Malfoy would be flesh and blood, would have detail. His eyes landed on one of the Malfoys and saw that the lights were casting shadows under his cheekbones and at his collar. He saw that a strand of hair had fallen onto this Malfoy's forehead and that his eyebrows were a darker blond than his hair. He saw that this Malfoy’s fingers were long and defined, and that there was a dark smudge of ink on the pad of his thumb, stark against Malfoy’s pale skin even in the lights’ dim glow. He saw the way the ridge of Malfoy’s nose ran down towards his mouth, ending in a perfectly parallel indentation above his top lip. He saw the way Malfoy looked at him, the wariness of it. Then, a spark of hope, or concern, or something. Harry felt himself spinning, thought he must have been wrong, that he must have found another mirror version after all. But no. The skin under this Malfoy’s eyes was dark and purplish, the way it had been in sixth year when exhaustion had overtaken them both. The mirrors couldn’t show that. This Malfoy was leaning towards his right ever so slightly, the way he had done when they’d sat in Hogwarts classrooms. The mirrors would have inverted that. This was Malfoy.
Draco grins, and Harry feels their familiar rivalry explode between them. Draco’s off in a split second, with Harry on his tail.
“Academically?”
“No, butterbeer caps.”
“Are you sure of that?”
He startles to hear Potter use his name like that. It’s one thing when someone’s got your cock in their mouth, but this…Merlin.
Draco barely hides a cringe. They sound like schoolboys. “I—do you want to? It’s a bit complicated, the hooks—”
It’s not because Potter is standing in front of him, gorgeous and observant, in a set of robes that do incredible things for his body.
“It’s very…” Draco searches for a word. “Nice.”
Not that the pages of
His robes, yes. Waistcoat first. Three buttons. Robes. He shrugs them on. He’s done this before. He can walk and - yes, one, two, three, four, five, six rows of buttons. Clasp at the collar, which he straightens. He runs a hand through his hair, smooths his robes and opens the door.
“Yeah.”
“No.” Draco sighed, trying to extend his patience with Potter’s proclivity for small talk. He reminded himself, rather sternly, that this was useful observational time. “There are non-magical animals as well.”
“Fine, but as soon as.”
“Tell me how.”
“Where are you going tonight, then?”
Pansy was right when she said I need someone who understands that world. It may be out of vogue right now, but the old families never lose their place for long. To let Potter deprive me of that is a mistake I’d spend the rest of my life paying for. To give that all away for a youthful infatuation – foolish at best.
“Yes, and I maintain that that’s the root cause and the most important factor to address. But I would imagine—I have observed—that you also have strong positive feelings for the people you care about.”
“Why?” Draco barely resisted the urge to turn and look for them.
He’s sure it’s mostly on account of it being a slow season. He’d survived the post-Christmas Vanishing of unwanted gifts and the Valentine’s Day Vanishing of items so repellent he’d considered self-Obliviating, and it’s not yet time for the rush of pre-Easter retrievals of Vanished Christmas gifts. It’s just…March. Rainy and chilly and dull in every possible sense of the word. Even the work he does have is remarkably dull. People Vanish quills with split tips in March, and singed dishcloths, and wellies with holes in the toe.
Draco took the deepest breath he could manage when his lungs felt as though they were made of glass. "Yes, that's right. To help with a crime."
needs time.”
Granger moved to interrupt him, and he held up a hand to stop her.
Ignoring the implied request, Draco leans forward, his brow furrowed. “And it’s been strictly casual? The whole time?”
“Didn’t think so.” I lick a strip up the underside of his shaft. He whines so beautifully. I wonder how he’d sound begging.
“I don’t know anything about them.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "Might've done, among other things. Would you like me to remind you?"
But when he steps back, Draco is still there. When he blinks, Draco is still there. When Draco pulls an identical cloak from his pocket, he’s still there.
“Your call.” He turned and made his way across the stables, past the Hippogriffs and the turnoff to the aisle that housed the horses. He turned over his shoulder. “Follow me. I have something else to show you.”
“You kick them off in the night.”
“Easy for you to say; it’s not your total humiliation.”
I hear his sharp intake of breath, but he doesn’t shy away. “Yeah?”
Ron found him, standing there, and it was only then that he realised he wasn’t in anything more than his pants. Even still, Ron’s surprise registered before his state of undress.
However he looked, Malfoy was everywhere. When he inhaled and exhaled, a million versions of his chest rose and fell. When he shifted his weight all Harry could see, everywhere he cast his eyes, was the curve of Malfoy’s back. His silhouette became Harry’s anchor in an ever-shifting sea of light. Malfoy was real when everything else was an illusion, yet Malfoy was an illusion himself. Harry wasn’t sure he’d be able to find the real one even if he tried. If he reached out for Malfoy, he wondered if he’d find the warmth of another body or the cold rebuff of glass.
Surely that hasn’t just disappeared. This isn’t just like Draco was before, professional and, Harry readily admits, good at his job. It’s colder than that, like he just wants Harry gone. But Harry was there, he knows now,
“Is that an heirloom or a practical joke?”
Draco froze, resisting the urge to edge closer. He’d suspected that Harry’s insistence that the Unspeakables’ surgical team had been caring was a gross exaggeration, but he didn’t find any comfort in having been right. He very much wished he hadn’t been.
“I—” Harry paused. He had imagined impassioned apologies and reconciliation, and there hadn’t been much of a role for the details, any more than there had been time to figure out who Draco might be now. “I think I do. I think I would, even more, with time.” He paused. “I don’t want to promise you anything more than what I’m sure of. But yes.”
Potter is slow to follow which, Draco reminds himself, is not a bad sign. Draco is running a hand over a length of rough grey silk by the time Potter’s footsteps round the corner.
"Come to your flat." Harry said, that angry tremor still reverberating, now tinged with something that Draco couldn't quite place.
“A complaint, then? Of course you’d have a complaint. Well, fine then. I can give you the form for that.” Draco begins shuffling around in the parchment under the counter.
“Of course, you know Mr Weasley and Ms Granger, and the Minister.”
Harry saw him reach for his trousers and pull them on, fastening them quickly and reaching for his shirt.
“I’m not gonna spill on the books!”
“Look,” Harry heads him off. “I don’t want to leave. Maybe you want me to, but I don’t want to go. And I don’t want you to go either. That was – maybe what just happened is old hat to you, maybe you do it all the time –” Harry blanches involuntarily at the thought “—but it’s not that way for me, and that felt good, and you, you’re. Just don’t go running off again, for fuck’s sake.”
“Good,” Draco soothed. “That’s right.” He pushed in again and twisted, and Potter whined thinly. “Your arse is bloody gorgeous.” He leaned in to catch Potter’s ear between his teeth. “I’m going to put my cock in it.”
He was also an exceptionally compliant patient. No evidence of the modesty that often cropped up during an examination, especially an initial exam, and especially with observers present. Potter obeyed every direction courteously and quickly.
“Right.” Malfoy looked at the door, and away from Harry. “Same, really. Shall we?”
And waited.
He frowns and – much to Draco’s relief – steps away from the counter. He pauses to survey Draco. The he turns to Potter, spins the knickers around his fingers once, winks, and makes a welcome exit.
That had been his logic at the time, he reminded himself, even if it didn’t ring as true as he would’ve liked.
He pulls back. Looks at you. Steps back and pulls free and you’re left with your fist in the air.
yesterday about my drinking problem because someone saw me moving all that liquor, and another one accusing me of having an affair with a portrait. Which,” he rushes on at the look on Draco’s face, “is absolutely and completely untrue. But there will always be articles.”
“That would kind of defeat the purpose, wouldn’t it?”
*    *    *
Potter shrugged and opened his mouth.
He looks down. It’s true. There are fine, red stitches spelling out “Potter” under a faded Madame Malkin’s label. Harry feels a lump rising in his throat. No one’s ever sewn his name into a jumper, which means…
Draco blinked.
“At least far enough to close the door,” Draco continued, “unless you’re secretly dying to be shagged against a water cooler.”
“You believe, then, that the orphan and the heiress belong together?”
Phillips makes a strangled sort of noise. Harry looks down. He’d thought Draco’s teasing was in jest all this time. At least, it had never been delivered quite so cuttingly. He does his best to still the twisting in his chest. Plasters on a smile. “What are we doing here, then?”
Draco tucks the tag under the knife. “You thought this was easy for me?”
He shook his head again.
He crooks his finger and runs the back of it, feather light, over the underside of Harry’s shaft and Merlin but he could cry with relief.
. Only your paper. And why is that, Draco? Why?”
“I’ve tried making conversation. And of course, if you’re uninterested…”
“You can return to the task at hand and identify the next item.” Draco moves to stand beside another desk. He rests a hand on the tabletop to, Harry realises, keep his fingers from shaking. “Writing desk, mahogany, early twentieth century. Familiar?”
Potter shrugged, and his voice cracked as he tried to speak at something closer to a normal volume. “I don’t mind it. It’s a nice break from…” He trailed off. “Things, I suppose. From worrying about accidentally freezing people.”
“It’s not a problem.” Potter grit his teeth. The leaf didn’t so much as wobble. “I was out of line.”
Potter crosses his arms. “Avoiding your staff. Can’t remember the last time they’ve gone this long without following me around. Thought they might drop if I just walked into their office.”
Draco swallowed. “Probably not a good idea. Too much of a risk to go off-plan.”
*  		*  		*
‘Full.’ I’ve heard of worse, but this is nothing to compare with how full he’ll be. “I’m going to add another.”
It brings Draco up short.
take him out of the void, repeatedly and, depending on the results, for increasing periods of time. I see that the Unspeakables haven’t—which is itself far less than ideal for his long-term prospects—but, more immediately, I can’t find a solution if I can’t observe the problem.”
Draco’s not at all certain of what to do with that. Comforting him is out of the question. Potter gets far too upset by inanimate objects and the Vanishing Department is not the sort of place where those sentiments ought to be encouraged. Cleaning saviour snot off his uniform is certainly not in the job description. But the other options aren’t any better. He knows Potter well enough to guess that scolding and yelling will incite a different, louder, sort of unpleasant reaction and really, all Draco wants is to be done with this. To go back to the neat, ordered world he’d almost begun to enjoy before Potter’s arrival.
Harry grimaced. “Right. What’s next?”
“So, we probably shouldn’t push it, really.”
Draco sighed and dropped his head on to the files with a bang, and left it there until a loud pop signalled Galder’s arrival.
Draco wasn’t sure he entirely believed her, but he didn’t think it would be counterproductive. At worst, it would upset Potter enough to prove the theory more decisively. “Fine. Would breakfast work? I’ll have Lobsey ask him and bring you his response.”
It’s Robards who announces the test: Harry is to chase Proudfoot who will attempt to evade capture using any means fit for the task, so long as they stay in the valley.
He shakes his head. “No, need to – can I touch?”
Once Harry was done she started talking with just as much fervour. When she raised her voice it was to tell Harry that it wasn’t his fault, that she’d made adult choices, that she didn’t blame him. The strength of her objections—her watery, forceful, “Harry James Potter, I made the choice freely and I wouldn’t change a damn thing”—almost struck fear in Draco’s heart even though she was half a room away and directing it elsewhere.
Shacklebolt stood next. “Dr Malfoy, please understand—”
“No,” Draco said. “Or, yes. Father did. It was never my intention. But in spite of your personal fondness for him, Hagrid had no business teaching. He was a danger to his students.”
From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry shake his head. “I wanted to. Part of me wanted to. But I guess when the time came, I just… I knew I shouldn’t.”
“At least,” Pansy replied. “Thrice, even, when Potter’s in the void and you’re too lazy to get your arse out of bed.”
“Yes.” Draco almost chokes on the word, thoroughly unprepared for it to make its way through his lips. The word is so unequivocal, so nakedly out there and, worst of all, so true, that his stomach withdraws into tight coils, that he bites down as though wishing he could retroactively catch the word between his teeth and keep it there.
Fuck. There had to be an out. He couldn’t be trapped here. Not without an escape.
“Not the art.” Though that didn’t make sense to him either.
“Guess that was always a bit vague. Away? Something about a void? Unless they were connected to something, like a pair of…” Potter trails off.
“Maybe a cup of tea?”
Draco scowled at the stack of papers that rested on the end table. It hadn’t been more than a few dozen times, and that was a matter of tying up loose ends. “What did he say?”
True enough. That I’m attempting to reconcile with my ancestral home is none of his concern.
“Malfoy!” Harry saw Malfoy shake his head, but he didn’t slow down. Harry ran after him. “Malfoy, please stop!” He redoubled his pace, feeling the boards bounce beneath his step, but it was so close, he was so close, and as sharp as the wind was, as hard as it was to move through the cold that had settled into his bones, he had to know. “Malfoy!” He called again as he got closer, close enough at last to reach out for Malfoy’s arm.
“Please let me…oh fuck, your mouth, your mouth, Draco, please…”
And it was a sense he just couldn’t shake. He was grateful that his friends were there, that they’d given up their Fridays to keep him company while he was stuck on an unwanted assignment, but even their presence couldn’t entirely assuage his sense that Malfoy was up to something. It ate at him, buzzing under his skin, making his usual restlessness all the more pressing. It wasn’t any one thing, but all of them combined. And as combinations of factors went, he couldn’t help feeling—as Malfoy swanned about the room, drinking wine and laughing—like his ire was unusually well-justified.
“Bed?” Harry whispers.
“I don’t think it’s one or the other.” He frowned. “Sorry.”
“Okay.” Harry nodded and stood. “Down in the field?” It sounded just as much like a request as a suggestion. “So I don’t accidentally knock it into anything?”
As soon as he’s certain he’s not been followed, his hands fly to his robes. He fumbles over the closures and shoves a hand down his pants. He’s aching, burning to be touched, has to stuff a fist in his mouth to keep from crying out when he wraps a hand around himself. He brings himself off quickly and inelegantly, collapsing against the post and listening to his own heartbeat echo in his ears.
Draco levitated a fallen leaf off the path. “Good. Now try ending my Wingardium.”
you should store your rare and valuable
“Um, thanks,” he replies, and buries his head in his elbow.
Licks the spot and moves down, biting Malfoy’s clavicle and laving the ridge of bone that drops down into a divot above his shoulder.

“She’s right,” Blaise adds, unhelpfully.
Weasley cast an Alohamora that rattled the doors but did not open them. Keeping his wand trained on the doors, he gave an order over his shoulder. "Goshawk, attempt Alohamora."
“Percy Weasley, that is absolute rubbish! ” Her face was almost the colour of the Hogwarts Express and she looked so close to exploding that Draco began to wonder if he was about to see more accidental magic. “You know as well as anyone that we owe Harry more than we could ever,
She leaned forward gently and rubbed his arm. “Shall I get it?”
“It was nice to be able to do it.”
Potter shoots him a look. “—since an entire house worth of stuff doesn’t usually Vanish, in my experience. So I don’t really know what was in there.”
“Realistically? No.”
Harry’s head spun. He looked around the clinic slowly, as though there might be some telling hint in the organisation of gauze or placement of surgical supplies.
“It’s not the only thing that makes me happy. But I don’t see why it can’t be one of them.”
She turned to him apologetically. “You’re not going to like it. It’s about his progress.”
“Everyone is fine, by the way.”
“He’s the one with a problem.”
Harry swallowed. “Touch me?”
Harry stops at the landing and gestures towards a familiar door. Draco’s heart is in his throat as he steps forward to open it.
The front of Harry’s robe is still curled into Draco’s fist. When he realises, he lets it drop. He tries for light-hearted. “So, left side for you then?”
Even through Draco’s heavy robes, Harry can feel him shaking. “You want this too.”
Draco felt Harry tighten his legs around Draco’s back and pull him closer. He still moved his hips, slower and shallower, until he was spent and sagged over Harry, breathless.
No response was forthcoming, except in the form of a Floo call from Luna two days later wherein she detailed further progress in rehabilitation and asked him, rather too pointedly, he thought, if there was anything else he wanted to know. He’d hesitated, but he hadn’t been able to bring himself to say it.
When she stopped, so did he. She repeated it again: “I’m sorry, Harry.”
“Did I? With the—?”
“No, but none of this is, and as long as we’re having a bit of fun.”
“Merlin and Circe both,” Malfoy muttered. He shook his head and began to pull apart the ends of the tablecloth.
“Oh.” Harry looks down at the boots, sitting right next to his feet. “You know, the socks are probably enough.”
He shot her a look, half expecting Galder to recount a tantrum. Would be out of character for Greg, but Pansy could put the fear of Salazar in anyone. “What kind of troubles?”
“Yes.”
“Fuck, yeah.” I withdraw my finger and add more lubricant. “Push back against me this time.”
“And he came to breakfast this morning looking just as wrecked as you do.”
“Right, sorry.” Draco shakes his head clear and passes the bowl.
“Tell me.”
“It’s not necessary, I can take a tray—”
Draco sank into the middle of the sofa across from them. “Greg.” He looked up, startled, and Draco caught his eye. “Good to see you.”
The only way out was the most obvious one, and he had the sinking feeling it was too obvious for Malfoy to have missed it. “What about the Muggle entrance?”
“Thank you for letting us use the ballroom. And for being here.”
“There’s also…” Draco cleared his throat. “There’s also the benefit.”
No such luck. The letter was as unfailingly polite as Shacklebolt always was, but the meaning was clear enough.
“Let’s be a bit more specific about the manoeuvres, shall we?” Draco interrupts. “This isn’t anything like walking. Your magic will propel you. You have to
Harry was pacing the room alone. The tea tray in the bow windows remained mostly untouched. It looked as though Harry had set a cup in its saucer and then had second thoughts about pouring.
“The elves don’t prune indoors until spring.”
Harry gives an exasperated laugh. “Now, you fucker.”
,” Potter intoned. “I just love being dropped head first when it’s on to a really soft carpet.”
“Harry.” Hermione had added a note of disappointment to the mix, and the urge to cry solidified into chest-aching guilt. “They may’ve made Malfoy a junior underassistant, but, well. Don’t you think that might be about keeping tabs on him? The Wizengamot may not have been able to convict—” she paused, and Harry knew it was meant to remind him that he’d been the one to get in the way of Malfoy’s conviction, that he’d insisted on testifying while Ron and Hermione flatly refused even to corroborate his story of their time at Malfoy Manor “—but that doesn’t mean he’s grown a conscience, or that someone didn’t decide it was best to keep him close enough to know if he was in contact with anyone he shouldn’t be, doing anything he shouldn’t be.”
“Have you ever had fresh apples?”
“I don’t think that’ll be a problem.” Potter stands, almost meeting Draco’s eye.
“Yeah…” Potter trails off. “I just thought,” he sighs. “Yeah, nevermind. I’ll be fine.”
Draco sighed. “I don’t know, to be entirely honest. There are a lot of factors. It’s not even possible to know, I don’t think. If that uncertainty is too much for you, I’ll understand.”
“Don’t disagree.” Ron paused, and Harry could hear him try, with mixed results, to steady his voice. “Look, mate, whatever you were doing with him, don’t let it cloud your judgment. We’re here to do a job. That’s what’s always mattered. Still does.”
“Casting while you’re focusing on different emotions. It may be useful that you haven’t done it before, as it means you don’t have a preconceived picture of the end results. Your magic is controlled enough at this point that I expect you’ll complete the spell correctly each time, but it will show us whether and how your emotions change the end result.”
“Are you going?” Draco cocks an eyebrow.
Draco schools his features and looks up. There’s a nervous flush creeping up Higsbee’s neck, which at least does something to put Draco at ease. “And?”
“Okay, I thought so.” Nice one, he thinks, and fights the urge to hide in his jumper. “I mean, I thought it was Tuesday. I mean, I didn’t think I got the day wrong.”
Draco walked on, trying to catch a good look at Potter from the corner of his eye. When he saw the anxiety written across Potter’s face, he nodded and turned back towards the stairs, gesturing for Potter to follow. “Still, in the interim. My fingers wouldn’t object.”
“Did you really just throw me into a bloody wall for your precious Muggle blobs?”
“No, no. Lucius will hardly be surprised by the general sort of activity. The choice of partner, on the other hand. Not to mention the noble intentions behind it… well, let’s hope he never finds out about that bit.”
The prospect of an argument seemed to evaporate, and Harry was set off-kilter all over again. “Oh.”
“So, two things,” Harry said, suddenly more nervous than he had been just a minute before. “This charity… It’s going to have a research division. Figuring out how to treat people whose magic is out of control in some way. Figuring out what they need, why they’re using magic violently, whether consciously or not. A lot of that will be led by Mind Healers, but there’ll be some cases that are about magic in the body. There have already been some in the news, about people who can’t explain why they’ve cast certain spells, especially children. And some cases where it seems like magic is reacting to neurochemical or hormonal conditions. We don’t even know exactly what the source is, some of the time. But we need someone to run it who knows about magic and medicine, and who’s willing to think creatively about how those things work together. So, one thing is wondering if you might be interested in running that.”
Draco gives the most half-hearted scowl of his life. Doesn’t even bother to turn it in Harry’s direction.
“They is iced over!!” Galder’s eyes grew to resemble saucers. “Last night they is going upstairs and they is finding icicles everywhere! They is finding frost on the beds and ice on the hearth and Mistress Pansy is finding the whole floor is ice! Mistress Pansy is very lucky she is not hurt, and Master Greg—” Galder’s lip quivered “—Master Greg is hurting his ankle!”
“We could, but frankly the details of the case don’t make enough sense for me to make an unqualified recommendation.”
He sank into his seat and crossed his arms.
Potter pressed his mouth into a thin line, then inhaled and closed his eyes, steeling himself. He met Draco’s gaze when he opened them again. “Were you injured?”
“Milk, no sugar? Or has that changed too?”
It was properly cold, that night. Cold enough to see his breath once we’d Apparated. Cold enough to see it speed up as he approached the concrete wall he’d chosen. Cold enough to account for his trembling fingers.
“No surprises,” I agree. “I’ll tell you. If you’ll relax.”
“Fuck.” Harry leans back, pulling Draco on top of him. “Need you inside me.”
Granger met her with a steady gaze. “I’m not at liberty to talk about it.”
“You’ve been…you’re not supposed to be doing this.”
Draco swallows.
There’s starched cotton there – more layers, more obstacles – but he can feel the outline of Draco’s body now, the curve of his ribs, the contours of his chest. He already wants more.
Harry half-shrugged, as if to brush off the question. “No, just thought about it. It’s chilly, you know? Figured that was good motivation.”
“I hope,” Draco tried, not especially pleased to find nervousness fighting sadness for chest territory, “that it was okay for you, as well.”
“Exactly,” Draco went on before Potter had the chance to figure himself out. “Do we have a deal?”
“All right?”
“Ah,” Draco deadpans. “A classic.”
He stopped short. “Are they trying to hide me?”
“Really? Given that our rather storied past includes several attempts at serious injury on both sides, I wouldn’t be particularly surprised to hear that you have reservations about having me put in charge of your care.”
He turns. Draco’s throat is painfully tight. He’s sure he couldn’t speak even if he had something to say.
“You go out all the time, though.”
A young wizard pushed to the front. “What is this artefact?”
Potter frowned. “Being empathetic and trying to see the best in people isn’t the same thing as being a doormat.”
“Fuck, Malfoy.”
Harry got to his feet, trying not to be shaken by the intensity of Draco’s gaze. He bent to retrieve the open golden ring that lay on the stone tiles. “This is yours.”
Harry tripped to a stop beside him. “What the hell are you doing?”
“Like policies permitting the construction of magical voids and wards for long-term treatment of magically unstable patients. And considerable resources devoted to biomagical research while—as you, unfortunately, know quite well—there’s nowhere in the UK doing this kind of work, or setting aside resources for it.” As he spoke, Draco’s stomach sank with the weight of his realisation. With its irrefutability.
“See that you do. A complete one, detailing the extent of his involvement with each. And the magical flare-up he mentioned?”
“As you are both aware,” Robards went on, “this is a matter requiring the utmost sensitivity and discretion. Underassistant Malfoy, how much has Unspeakable Wardwell told you?”
“I suppose so, yes.”
“Once confirmed, you may visit the Office of Boring Paperwork in person to request the specific forms necessary to disclose your requisition number.”
“You know about the bird, now. Do you feel any better?”
“Er.” Draco couldn’t quite remember. Harry’s eyes were so green. And Draco’s stomach was so stubbornly lodged in his throat that he wasn’t sure he’d be able to get the words out. He wanted Harry. Merlin. He wanted to hear a particular answer. Wanted it very much.
Harry loathed him on so many principles he could barely keep them straight.
“Yes.”
“Okay?”
Once upright, his head spun. He tried to focus on pulling his cuffs straight and raking his hair into place before he stepped out from behind the tree.
“I didn’t realise guests were allowed to demolish the place. That’s years of wasted opportunities. Unless you’re going to start threatening to kick him out, too?”
Though he had been watching Harry throughout the conversation, Draco was surprised when Harry’s gaze flicked over to him. He looked almost pleading, and definitely hesitant. Draco gave him a nod, which he hoped would communicate, “you can do this,” rather than, “not my problem, get back to it.” All of which left Draco feeling as unsure as Harry looked.
On the fourth day—and after three Scotches—Draco picks up a quill.
“Should be back by then. Lunch too?”
My hand drops lower still, and lower, until it’s the back on my knuckles rubbing against his bollocks, until I run my thumb over his cleft.
“Ah.” Luna nodded sagely. “Then tilting your head probably won’t help.”
He rocked back and stood, grabbing the discarded file on his way back to the sofa, wondering what Shacklebolt wanted this time and, depending on how it went, how he’d look wearing a Bouillabaisse.
“I don’t, usually.”
He hits the bell once and holds his breath.
“Wh—?” Draco stopped short at another almost imperceptible shake of her head. He shook his own head in a tremendously counterproductive attempt to clear it. The Hangover Potion in the bedside drawer, he really needed to—
“Ooh.” Pansy grinned. “You
Draco doesn’t drop his gaze, but he does drop to his knees. He pulls Potter towards him, leans forward so that the head of Potter’s cock is brushing his lips. He feels Potter twitch against him, feels him fight to stay in place, to exercise some last shred of restraint.
“Your mouth,” he says again. “Need your mouth.”
Draco hesitated. “I can get them, if you’d like. Have them for you next time.”
“Yeah.” Draco closes his eyes and arches into Harry’s loose fist.
“Not a terrible idea.” Draco lifted the last kitten onto a cushion. “But no.”
It gives me plenty of time to write, at least. And look at Harry.
“Of course,” Pansy replies, “it wouldn’t be necessary if you just told us.”
"Er, why call the Ministry when I've got one of the best on speed dial! If you could just come down, spell for prints, that sort of thing."
“Can I help you? I’m in the middle of something.”
, a half-moan that goes straight to Harry’s groin. Draco’s tongue darts out to lick his lower lip and the uses of that tongue come flooding back to Harry, who has, as a result of forgetting the English language, given up on conversation altogether.
“Yes,” Potter laughs, and Draco’s heart goes out to him even through the haze of jealously. “Totally sure. He doesn’t want me around.”
“She did.” Draco walked to lean across the window frame opposite Potter’s chair. “Was your visit difficult?”
“No.”
“Yeah?”
“Then perhaps his wellbeing might be a higher-order priority than fundraising?”
“You’re the one who asked me out!” Potter’s voice is strangely frantic.
“Not bad. Doesn’t feel like an Incendio to the throat.”
“Please,” Draco said. “Merlin,” he breathed, running his hands over Harry’s skin, holding him close to trace the line of his shoulder blades. He dropped his hands and traced the line of Harry’s ribs to his nipples and pinched. Harry arched into him.
He lifted his finger off the intercom and began to make his plans.
I should’ve run then. I should’ve changed my wards when I first thought of it. Should’ve kicked her out, plugged my ears.
“Mistress Pansy insists!” Prippa squeaked. “Mistress Pansy says Prippa is not to return without Master Draco, but Galder is telling Prippa to bring Master’s tray, but Mistress Pansy is saying Master Draco must come to the dining room for breakfast!” With her hands occupied, Draco could hear her stepping on her feet in punishment, the tray clattering every time.
was much of the same. Even if Draco had ever had any need whatsoever for cosmetic glamours, he wouldn’t trade in the satisfaction of an hour with Bobby or Fabrice, the feeling of wringing every last reserve of strength from muscles no amount of Quidditch could ever have touched. Or the results, which had the distinct advantage of not wearing off at inopportune moments. And he certainly didn’t need charmed curlers or contraceptive potions.
“The wards on the property are embedded in the very foundation, as well as many of the root systems on the grounds, and some predate the Magna Carta by over a century. Do you really think it would accommodate WiFi?”
The back pages of
Harry laughs, low and sweet. “Fuck,” he repeats.
Draco doesn’t move. “Is that meant to be an invitation?”
Potter stopped and turned.
“Yes,” Harry whispers, “Merlin, yes.”
“It was a shit plan.”
that you liked it.”
doesn’t seem to mind in the least.”
-- -- --
Draco rolls his eyes and slips out of bed, taking the sheet with him. “Is that the sort of show you’re planning?”
They drew to an abrupt halt in front of Myrtle’s bathroom and Harry had to jump aside to avoid stepping on Hermione’s heel.
“Before you walked back here uninvited and in violation of Ministry regulations,” Draco corrects.
Potter had asked the question so politely that Draco couldn’t tell whether or not it was sincere and decided to avoid it completely. “Give me the chance to find an alternative before you consider it.”
Potter wrinkled his nose. “A whole arm, a whole hand… nothing like that.”
It took all of Draco’s restraint not to bang his head into the doorframe. “I’m sorry. Merlin. I didn’t think you did mean—Perhaps I do need the break.”
Draco looked at Harry, and at Harry looking back at him, and didn’t know how long it would take to begin to know what his questions even were. He did know he still wanted to reach across the table and take Harry’s hand. And some part of him wanted to reach across the table and take more than that. He took a deep breath. Exhaled. “How many more courses are there?”
“No,” Harry rushes to answer. “No. Guest room.”
Malfoy took a long sip from his drink.
I’ve felt fear during sex before. The fear of being interrupted, or injured, or that my partner would neglect to follow through on the agreed upon terms. This was not a fear of consequence, but a fear of action. That I would drive him away, or fail to act at all.
"To help with a crime!" Draco answered. He studiously avoided looking at the switchboard and tried to sound defensive, as though it was some great surprise that his good friend Harry Potter wouldn't drop everything and come help him. "They've taken quite a few things, I think."
He wondered, briefly, very briefly, what would happen if he stayed. If he put it off a few hours, or a few days. But he had his meeting with the Vice-Chancellor, and he meant to see if Mother was free for dinner, and he’d told everyone he was going, made all of his decisions based on that.
Draco shook his head slowly. “I might, yes. Merlin. But what does this have to do with the monumental task Granger’s just laid out for me?”
“8 o’clock. Be ready.”
It clicks for Draco then. The moon. It’s Remus Lupin. Lupin, who he’d been so sceptical off, and who has still told Harry to…he can’t think about that.
In the corner of his eye, he can see Potter yanking at his clothes, his cock – limp but, Draco’s loathe to admit, still impressive – disappearing into his pants. Potter tugs his jeans up and his jumper down. His hair doesn’t look any different than it usually does, and as far as Draco can tell – as far as Draco will admit – there's no evidence that anything of note has happened here.
“Are you not going to talk to me at all? Shall we leave the room and start over?”
“What?” Draco snarls.
“Have you considered France?”
, Draco thought. “Well,” he said. “It’s been six months? Seven? Surely, with all of that, there’s twelve more courses worth of stories you can tell.”
“Did you just extend a metaphor?”
Draco is many things, but that is not one of them. That has never been one of them. He has helped Potter more than once and has stood for more of his shit than could possibly be considered a part of his job. He will not be Potter’s toy, to boot. If Potter wants to play games – or not play games, or half-heartedly play games, or refuse to acknowledge the games he’s very obviously playing – he’s come to the wrong place. Two can play at that not-game, and only one of them is a Slytherin.
“Does it bother you that you’ve hurt Draco?”
Money and fame. Of course. Harry felt almost as stupid as Malfoy seemed to think he was; of course that’s what would have motivated Malfoy.
Potter’s cheeks flushed. “And it was nothing to you. Just a phone call.”
“Wrap your hand around the base.”
He slammed his briefcase down on the desk and slid it across to land in front of Potter who, to Draco’s satisfaction, didn’t quite manage to suppress a flinch. “What are you doing here?”
“Says the artist.”
“Not to mention the ethical considerations. If his reactions to me are triggering outbursts I really shouldn’t continue on in my current capacity.”
“Hermione.” He reached up to, as far as Draco could tell, remove her hand, though he tempered the gesture with a squeeze. “Is it time?”
“Fine.”
Potter did, and huffed. “More tests?”
Some of the stuff you’ve written in here – it’s pretty mean, Draco. I kind of guessed you were up to something when you started being weirdly nice to me back in September. No offence, not that you’d even necessarily take any at this, but it just really wasn’t like you to just be friendly like that. Picking stuff up for me and saying hi and the like. It just wasn’t very you. And after all these years of fighting, I guess I already knew you pretty well. And Ron and Hermione agreed about all of it, and I guess they know you too. I guess fighting in a war with someone lets you know them pretty well.
“Do you want to see this, or shall I send you back and ask for someone else?”
He found himself strangely nervous as he waited for the reply. He ate his own breakfast. He showered off the last of an improvised Dittany salve and declared himself healed. He went to dress and found it oddly perplexing. There was less need for formal robes if he wasn’t in charge of Potter’s care and he’d found, in the course of re-training his implant patients, that the range of motion Muggle clothes provided could be advantageous. He settled on grey wool trousers and a white button down with a navy jumper. Then he took the jumper off; he didn’t want a handprint burned through cashmere. Then he put it back on again, as there was no reason to expect Potter to touch him. He forced himself out of his room, even if it meant wandering the hallways.
Draco kept to his knees and Potter met him there, nestling his hips behind Draco’s, and when Draco rocked back, Potter met him, sliding his cock between the fleshy curves of Draco’s arse. As Draco pushed harder, so did Potter, until his shaft was a constant pressure against the ring of nerves at Draco’s entrance. It was a tease, and it was pleasure, and it was fucking brilliant, and Potter clearly thought so too. He was moaning louder and louder, and if Draco’s cock hadn’t been almost painfully full that alone might’ve got him there.
“Wow. No,” Harry agreed. “That might be an understatement.”
I made it back to bed last night alone, for better or worse, but didn’t wake up that way. Pansy’d come in – really ought to change the wards when I get back – and was palming my morning wood. Casually as you please, sitting on the edge of the bed twisting that charm of hers between her fingers. The other hand was resting on my boxers, pressing into my erection. Said she was checking to see if I was prepared to claim my winnings.
I looked at him, agog. “The Ministry?”
“Your – I mean, the thing you’re holding is more. You can tell more about that than I can. About silk. Not my area.”
“When you were growing up.” Potter enunciated each word carefully. “You had them when you were growing up.”
Potter had always had a talent for putting a finger on Draco’s worst fears.
. Flipped past Quidditch results and was happy enough to notice that the Falcons were still performing well, though even that didn’t elicit more than a mildly pleased hum. He considered a request for World Cup tickets; he still had a few of the old Slyths around on occasion, and it might be nice to throw something of meaning their way. But Quidditch tickets were the sort of thing one threw in as an extra. They were far too trifling for the main event.
He laughs. “Brought me out for a secret kid’s party? Kinky.”
Potter had grown a bit reticent after our interaction in the changing room, but that seems to be passing quickly enough. We’ve progressed back to occasional moments of assistance and regular hellos. Not sufficient to win the bet, but progress. And he seems to have appreciated not being hounded with apologies, as his followers would’ve done. Bodes well, really.
- If has not showered in changing room, does not shower straightaway (disgusting)
“Yes,” Draco repeats, barely above a whisper.
Harry sighed. “No. It isn’t.”
Draco took out their wands and used his to lift the kittens out of harm’s way, resettling them on the settee. “There’s a better way.”
The smile vanished immediately. Shacklebolt sat in his desk chair, massaging his temples. Croaker and Robards were perched on opposite corners of his desk, clearly awaiting Draco’s arrival.
It felt really, unreasonably good to be out, and better still to be dancing. Between the insane rush to prepare for this case and the intensity of working on it, he hadn’t been properly out since the night before Millie called. An oversight on his part, surely, because this was better than he’d even remembered.
Draco rolled his eyes and lifted his phone. "Kate?" He paused. "No, no tea." He looked at the list. "Mr Potter has several clients who are interested in leveraging a combination of personal and business assets into our Mid Caps and I need to see their financials to know–” He waited out her interruption. “No, it’s the Old Mutual UK and the Franklin UK, and I have the précis for both. I need to know whether they’re qualified to invest personal and business assets separately, or whether they’ll have to liquidate–” He stopped for her apology. “Not at all. Would you call downstairs and have them send up complete records on,” he glanced at the list, “Christopher Macnair, Susan Wilkes, Charlotte Jugson, and,” he raised an eyebrow at Potter, “Archard Carrow.”
You reach for him. Slide your hand over his, clasp his wrist. You find it. Feel it. The pulse.
I’m so sorry, Harry. More sorry than I’ll ever be able to tell you.
He couldn’t understand it. Not any of it.
Harry falters. Draco’s fingers grip his jaw, turn his head so that he can feel Draco’s hot breath on his ear, can hear the low whisper. “Trust me.”
“Rain check?”
I should’ve known he’d not be the sort to rise with the birds. That he’d scratch his bollocks and throw an arm over his eyes to hide from the sun. That I’d have to nudge him awake, to remind him of what the day held, no matter what I’d like to have done instead.
Draco’s too tired to hide his disappointment when the morning passes without the arrival of Potter's owl or, more to the point, Potter, storming through the
They watched as he climbed higher, his wings fully extended, the white expanse of his coat turned blue in the night sky. He rose until he was in front of the moon, and then banked right.
“I,” Harry swallows hard. “Yeah, I could do that.”
It’s not just good for Draco, either. Really, this is far better for him, too. Simple. Peaceful, even. And it’s good to move around a bit. He’ll sleep well, maybe. Which would be nice. He’s tired. Lots of tossing and turning. Lots of waking up with an aching erection and rushing to toss one off.
Draco smacks Harry’s thigh. “It is not fifteen minutes.”
Malfoy whimpered into his mouth and Harry pulled back to ride him faster, resting their foreheads together and rolling his hips to draw out the delicious drag of Malfoy’s cock against his rim, then sinking back down until Malfoy pressed against his prostate and he clenched around Malfoy’s cock.
“Just the utility?”
He nods again, dropping a hand to my back, urging me closer, faster.
Harry took the glass. “Do I want to know how you managed that?”
Draco turns his appeal back to Pansy. “You, of all people, know that these things aren’t easily forgotten. It’s not as easy as just moving on.”
at the beginning of the night was noticeably silent on that point, replaced with a tentative curiosity and the return of the same low charge he’d felt before.
, to start with. He rolls down his shirtsleeves, links them shut. They show wrinkles from having been rolled up, but his robes will cover that.
Harry felt Malfoy squeeze a hand into his jeans and wriggled to try and make room. He imagined Malfoy’s likely reaction to the suspiciously well-squeezed container of Blackbeard’s Bottom Boysenberry Boy Butter he’d stuck in his pocket, just in case. He flushed when he heard a snort behind him, though Malfoy had the… well, courtesy was a strong word, but he coughed to try to cover it up. He rested what Harry assumed to be the the lid on Harry’s back. Harry heard a wet squelching noise, then Malfoy reached forward to shove the whole affair back in Harry’s pocket before straightening. “Alright, then?”
,” he spits, “to appease your lot.”
“As I have said before,” Shacklebolt interrupted, “we appreciate your sense of urgency.”
“You are.”
“Obviously fucking not.” The wind bit at his back and he pulled his shoulders up around his ears.
“We’ve moved on to wardrobes and bureaus. I will retrieve the most recent arrivals, you will tell me what you recognise.”
“Can it wait till Monday, love?” Ron asked.
“Yes. The ritual.” Composing himself, Draco shook his head and blinked. “We need to bisect Slytherin’s mark. Usually you’d stand on the center of it and face the sinks, but there are two of us. You still need to face the sinks, but may not want to stay standing the whole time, so it’s best if you’d kneel, facing the sinks.”
“I’m sorry.”
! I need time, Potter. I have an idea, at least one, and I need time to figure it out. If you do this, there’s no going back.”
Harry looks down at the hand on his chest and moves it to rest over his heart. “A lot. I would’ve given a lot.”
“Could show you right now. Could open you up so sweetly you’ll forget your own name.”
“Yes.”
“Why would I, when you’ve not mentioned him at all? In between opening and closing his dossier a million times.”
He’d been so focused on touching Potter that he almost startled when Potter’s warm fingers reached for the bottom of his jumper. He’d left his suit jacket behind the tree and the realisation that one layer stood between his skin and Potter’s hit him like an avalanche. He’d never taken something off so quickly.
Harry withdrew entirely in response to his efforts, letting Malfoy’s cock fall free of his mouth with a wet pop. “Like that, Malfoy?”
*    *    *
Draco took the last for his own, announcing himself by sitting dead centre. Small talk ground abruptly to a halt as soon as he did so. He poured himself a cup of tea.
“But he did it again?”
“Please,” Harry gasped. “Please come.”
Draco knew, instinctively, that if he paused to consider the question Harry would spook, but knew, too, that it contained dimensions he couldn’t quite grasp in the moment. He tried to keep his voice even and hope for the best. “Of course. It’s important for you to explore any feelings that might affect your magic. Your overall wellbeing, really.”
“No, it’s still the right.”
“Perfectly fine.”
“I am, yes.”
“And the seam on his thigh, where it ran along the implant, started burning up. Turning to cinders. I couldn’t work out why. It was a very basic medical exam, nothing to inspire any sort of unusual response.”
He was almost ready to beg—for Potter’s hand, for his mouth, for any path to release—when he felt Potter speed up behind him, heard him go quiet. And then he dug his fingers into Draco’s hips, pulling him close with such force that Draco thought he might leave a bruise as a souvenir, and Potter let out a low, guttural moan that Draco was sure he’d remember for the rest of his days. Draco felt the wetness of Potter’s ejaculation run down his arse and onto his thighs, then felt Potter collapse forward onto him. He felt the way Potter’s thighs shook with the intensity of it, the way Potter was still struggling to catch his breath.
Add in weekly dinners with Mother and the occasional night out with friends, and Draco was almost too busy by mid-summer. He’d reluctantly had to give up the idea of getting a Kneazle kitten when he wasn’t home enough to properly care for it. He’d even had to fight to carve out an afternoon alone in his flat to focus on the latest clinical reports without interruption. He was due to take on a next round of implantation surgeries himself. The biggest obstacle to making the procedure common was a shortage of qualified Healers, and remedying that shortage was, therefore, of highest priority. It was just a question of picking patients whose cases would be instructive.
“And how many times did Ginny hear me speak Parseltongue?”
Eyes locked, they both let their trousers fall. Toeing off his shoes and socks, Draco steps out of them and stands there, naked save his pants, already half-hard, across from Harry.
What if it feels like a stranger’s room?
look at
He is sitting almost above his department, with its shelves upon endless shelves reaching for a ceiling that’s never been nearly this close. The dais looks smaller, the doors to the front office comically tiny when framed by the vastness of the room.
“What are you doing?” Harry whispered.
He freezes, then. The moment seems to last forever. And then, an even slighter nod.
“I’m offering you a genuine solution. One that will require maintenance, yes, but a course of treatment that addresses the root cause and that might, given the nature of his condition, make Potter a fair sight happier in the long run, too.” His frustration swelled, as did his voice. “And you’d ignore that for an untested, superficial treatment that may or may not work? Is it that impossible for you to acknowledge that Potter didn’t make it through unscathed? That he’s ill? That your grand hero is in need of assistance? Does that make him less to you, or—”
Draco feels the moan rumble up through his chest and thank Salazar he’s got Potter’s cock butting up against his throat, because Potter groans and pulls at his restraints and seems to think it’s an advanced technique rather than Draco’s shock at hearing his name out of Potter’s mouth.
It’s a long moment before Draco speaks. “Sleep?”
“Say the word and I’ll fuck you,” Draco said. “Fill you right up. Might even let you come.”
“I arrived to the department one morning to find the most spectacular collection of items.”
Draco jolted upright, sending the pillow to the floor. “She did?”
“No.” Draco lifted his arms to stretch his shoulders in the empty expanse of the garden path. “You should try it.” He dropped his arms, and his stomach went along with it.
Harry’s twisting stomach begins to sink. He wonders if, in a world where standing without vomiting has suddenly become his biggest accomplishment, the delicate treatment he’s been getting from his friends isn’t justified after all.
“Do you sell them?”
He seals himself in his office, dims the lights, summons the Scotch, and pours two fingers. It’s five o’clock somewhere. Bangkok, he thinks. And isn’t he overdue for a vacation?
“Have you lost your memory? Do we need to call a healer? I would’ve sworn you know how to do this.
“But if they’d just done an implant to try and get the Wand in line, what would they have done with the Elder Wand?”
His shoulders sag with the realisation that giving in is his best course of action. “He came to the
He crosses his arms. “Your sense of what is or isn’t practical and beneficial has certainly changed.”
“There’s also—” Granger started and abruptly stopped again.
“No.” Potter turned the apple over in his hands, pressing his thumb into a tender spot. “Too bad about the apples. Was wondering what they’d taste like off the tree.”
“Yeah. It did.”
He raised a hand to the door, but hesitated. It was still his house; he didn’t need an elf’s invitation to enter his own foyer. He wavered, dropping his fist, then raised it again to grasp the iron ouroboros that served as a door knocker. He might not need an invitation, but there was nothing wrong with the hospitality that a proper entrance would bring. An elf to take his cloak, offer him a hot cup of tea, tell him how the unpacking was coming on. Before he could think thrice, he tightened his fingers and brought the ring down against the wood.
“Fine, then. What’s your investment in Potter’s treatment? Are you after the magical superweapon? The political pawn? What is it?”
“Want,” he said. Just, “Want.” He took a moment more to catch his breath, and then. “Are you close? I want more, want to feel you.”
Millie spoke before Granger had a chance. “There’s no need for that.”
I dodged, stupidly into a corner, and she cast it again straightaway. And then you jumped in front of me.
Draco looked to Millie and Granger, who were sharing a significant look of their own.
“What?” Draco rasped, stunned.
Draco’s now-familiar nausea makes a brief appearance as they make their way to the floor. He imagines the alternative wherein he never gets to do this again. He slides his arm around Harry’s waist.
“If, for instance, I put this on you with my mouth.”
“He knew what it meant to Granger. Knew its potential usefulness.”
“More?” Draco asks, half sincerely making an offer, half asking because he sincerely needs to hear it again.
“And you’ve called in sick for almost a week based on the assumption, made without so much as bothering to ask, that that’s what I said?”
“Yes.”
“Hey, that was…wow.”
“Fine,” Harry replies, raising his hands in concession. “Tell me what to do.”
“Our purpose has always been to return your personal effects with as much efficiency as possible.”
My hips move automatically, pumping into him. I know I’m losing some control, but he doesn’t look like he minds.
Behind Harry, a crack began to run down the window, getting longer and wider as he sat in silence through Granger’s well-meaning onslaught.
“Indeed.” Draco rolls up his list. “Do you see anything else?”
It was half past three on a Wednesday and Harry was failing in every attempt to lose himself in paperwork when Padma knocked on his doorframe. “Oi, Harry, looks like an owl got turned around.” She held a thin scroll in her hand.
“Harry, is that a –?”
“Hero,” Robards finished. “Regardless of his magical status.”
“Yeah?”
– Azkaban.
“What are you doing?”
Draco rose and ran a hand down Potter’s side and grabbed his hip, pulling him back and pressing up against him. “We could do so many nicer things with your arse, Potter, if you’d only play along.”
“C’mere.” Draco opens his arms.
“On who?”
Harry slips the button free and presses his hips into Draco’s back. The pressure is delicious, but it’s almost beside the point. He wants Draco to feel the effect he has. “You’ve done so much already. Just a little break.”
Comprehension dawned, and the edges of Harry’s mouth turned up. “Say what, exactly?”
“You arm?” Potter’s eyes widened. “Your whole–?”
“No, no. Every patron deserves the same exemplary service we’re known for.”
“Okay…” Harry looks at it warily, and when he chances a sip, he doesn’t choke. It’s not bad, actually. Not cider, but not bad.
.” He gasped.
Potter rushed to hold his wand out to Draco before he spoke. “You’re welcome.”
“As I said, I have a job to do.”
Without looking at them, Draco returns the set of photos to their folder and shoves them into his desk. “I’ll handle this.”
“Would you like to cast a warming charm?”
Harry’s voice seems to echo across the room before settling into a long silence.
“Maybe there are some things it’s better not to think about.”
Draco raised an eyebrow and waited.
ed. note – our Anthea does have a way with words! And this editor confirms that it’s entirely true. Harry just has that glow about him! See this month’s set of four Harry Potter covers for more!)
“Malfoy.” Potter nodded once. He was wearing that leather jacket again, and boots to match, and jeans and a white t-shirt. He’d have stuck out like sore thumb if anyone was still in the office.
“They are,” Potter insisted.
"What of it?"
Potter’s trembling with the effort of staying still. He shakes his head again and Draco’s grateful, beyond grateful, that his hand is wedged so tightly between Potter’s jeans and his pants that Potter probably can’t feel him trembling at the thought of it.
“This. The parties, the art. All of it.”
Behind him, he heard the door creak open, and a sliver of foreign light invaded the room. He whispered “
“They won’t send me to prison.”
Plants. He’ll water the plants. They’re against the back wall, almost as far as he can get from Potter. That will be productive, no thought required.
He was visibly nervous. Perhaps for knowing what we would be doing, or for remembering the last time. He dragged his feet getting upstairs, kept having one last thing to do or find or put away. To be fair, I didn’t intervene. I may’ve been a bit nervous as well. There was so much at stake.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, brow furrowed.
“He does,” Granger agreed.
“Yes,” Potter agreed mildly. “The implant.”
“Oh, true.” Pansy sits back, surprised. “Couldn’t get a name?”
“Isn’t finding all of that out part of the point?”
Potter started to object.
He went with the familiar. “What’s there to see?”
“He wouldn’t do that.” It’s automatic. Draco cringes.
Pansy and Blaise are proud of him. They do Draco the favour of pretending it’s pure smugness at having Slytherined him into asking Potter out properly, but Pansy comes to stand behind him just to stroke his hair while he reads the paper, and Blaise brings him mango Mrs Zabini’s sent from India, and they mention, in passing, that they’ve secured tickets to the HHS event just in case Draco should decide some friendly faces would be welcome.
“Which is?”
He tucks his head, and sees the green grass of Wiltshire, and the sun lighting Draco’s hair, and he smiles.
Harry’s head snapped up for the express purpose of looking at him like he ought to consider a trip to St Mungo’s.
“Easy for you to say, oh Chosen One. Do you know what they’d write about me? Do you have any idea?”
“So that you can fuck me over the sinks till I’m hissing your name?”
His shoulders tensed and the kitten batted at his hair in reproach. “Oh?”
He pushes until his fingers have disappeared inside of Harry, then slips them out, and in again. Harry stretches his legs even further apart and cants his hips. He almost grabs for Draco’s wrist, barely holds himself back, settling instead for a murmured, “Harder.”
Draco laughed. “True.”
Draco sighed. “Yes. I did.”
The calm that had been coming over Draco wavers at Higsbee’s equivocation. “Yes?”
“I said shut up, Potter,” Draco mumbled, half asleep, before closing his eyes entirely and passing out on Harry’s chest.
Greg shrugged again.
“What?”
“Big ones,” Greg confirmed. “You know, the Daisy Green ones. Get wrote up in the
The candles flared and Harry almost jumped when a thunderclap rattled the windows. When he looked back, the key had been absorbed into the tap, filling the opening so its edges were flat.
“Of course.” Draco stood. “I’ll have some sent up.”
He takes Draco by the shoulders and turns him around so suddenly that Draco can’t stop it before it’s done, before he’s facing Harry straight on, just far enough apart that the few inches difference in their height can’t save him from catching the full force of Harry’s gaze.
“But,” Potter rushes on, “we don’t have to stop. I know how you feel about efficiency. You know, getting things done.” Potter cringes. “I’ll be okay with just a couple of biscuits.”
“How are you feeling, in terms of magical fatigue?”
The silence between them moved from laden to explosive. When he spoke, Malfoy's voice was hoarse. "What?"
“You’ve thought about how he smells, then?”
Robards looked like he was about to start drooling.
And then there’s the question I’ve never dared ask before. The answer’s always been evident, if we’ve even got that far. “Worth it again?”
“The rather eclectic collection that came with your house was an inheritance, was it not?”
“Yes what?”
“Both of them?” This time it did sound like a question.
He can hear Potter turning to look at him. He can feel it.
“Yes,” he hisses, not looking up. “I fucking heard you.”
Malfoy walked past him, to the head of the stairs. He glanced back halfway over his shoulder, not quite far enough for Harry to catch his eye, then started walking. Harry followed, still searching for the words with every step.
He’s at 12 when he hears his name. The voice is so familiar. It’s reflex. He looks.
“Thorough.”
Potter didn’t respond.
The bird squawks when he pauses, flapping its wings and boring into Draco with furious black eyes.
Beside him, he heard Harry’s breath catch. “Might not, no.” Harry twined their fingers together and held on.
Harry shook his head.
“I guess it’s all’s well that ends well, if I’m figuring it out now.”
“Very?” Blaise asks. “How very?”
Except Potter’s words kept coming back to him;
“I didn’t assume you were.”
Because Draco hasn’t touched his Penseive since the day Potter arrived in his office; he hasn’t needed to.
“No,” Draco agreed. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of things St Mungo’s doesn’t have.”
“Are you?” Harry, having survived his last foray into looking at Draco, turned to face him.
“Considering what I just did to the tree, that doesn’t seem like a good idea.”
“Too dangerous,” Harry explained, running his thumb back and forth over a crevice in the stone. “Couldn’t even really go school shopping without a guard.”
of all things–with a Sphinx.
“We’ve done a thorough survey of the Aurors, and there’s no one else who offers such an apparent and, to be entirely candid with you, Malfoy, well-known and historically important set of contrasts as the two of you. We don’t think the killer would be able to resist.”
“No!” Potter exclaimed, pacing towards Draco. “There’s more. The press. Your reputation. I could restore your reputation in the wizarding world.”
Instead, Malfoy rolled his lip between his front teeth and watched Harry carefully. Expectantly.
Draco throws the word over his shoulder and disappears around a corner.
Then he wondered if it might be an eager young Muggle. It seemed possible.
Potter didn’t say anything. He folded the brochure, though, and slid it back into his pocket.
“Yes.” Draco tried to sound more definite than he felt. He’d thought he was on to something. An answer, even. But if he’d been right about the trigger for Potter’s outbursts, this latest one certainly complicated matters.
“Got it.” He took a sip of his whisky.
“Yes, Master.” Prippa tugged on one of her ears. “Excepting, Master’s tea…”
“Um,” Harry tries again. “I didn’t realise I was slowing you down so much.”
Potter’s pause lingers until he shakes his head as if to clear it. “Irrelevant. It’s irrelevant. You can’t prove anything.”
When his thrusts grow erratic Draco leans forward, wraps his hand around Harry’s cock, and begins to stroke. It’s so much, so overwhelming. The words come pouring out.
He inhales and holds it, and I push. He’s loosened from my tongue, and there’s the lube, and I slip into him to the second knuckle, so easily, like it’s nothing at all, like my finger belongs there.
He wondered what it would be like to kiss Draco. He’d wondered before, all those years ago. Had wondered when they were falling off bar stools. Had wondered when he was lying alone in bed at night, though he hadn’t wanted to admit it. Had wondered about more than kissing him, if he was honest. Had wondered if that same spark would be there. The push and pull, the piss-taking, the precious, precarious balance between challenge and understanding. He wondered what he would do if this didn’t live up to what he’d imagined. He wondered what he would do if it did.
He groaned and dropped his head into his hands. He'd slept dreadfully and neither the thought of his plane-to-be nor all the tea in England was shaking him out of it. He glanced at the clock with open resentment. Already past one, his meeting was at three, and his focus was nowhere to be found. Usually a half-decent shag had him sleeping like a king, and large sums had him as excited as a Hogwarts first-year. Instead he was blinking away sleep and watching the hands on his desk clock rotate more slowly than they ever had before. He half-wondered if it was in need of repair, but it was Chopard, and he knew as well as anyone that good Swiss clocks didn't just stop working.
“I want you.” He kissed his way across Harry’s clavicle. “Can I?”
It seemed clear. All quite clear. The lingering glances, unnecessary touching, the repeated hand holding. An attempt at a kiss from him after the last game, badly fumbled but charming all the same.
“Can I help you?” Draco’s voice is like ice.
Harry was distracted by the slow burning push of Malfoy’s tip breaching his hole and struggled to focus on the snake’s response.
“I assure you, I’ve said nothing about how good my skin feels.” Though now Potter’s mentioned it… “Not that the insight into your associations isn’t fascinating.”
He isn’t even that relieved by the appearance of Pansy and Blaise. They both look smashing, but Pansy is so obviously nervous around Potter. Draco’s heart goes out to her. But then, Potter is kind. He seems, genuinely, to have forgiven her. None of them know what to do with that, but Pansy’s eyes are bright by the time they part ways, and Blaise gives Harry a firm handshake, and Harry meets his eye, and something passes between them. Draco couldn’t name it, but he’s so glad of it he’s not sure he needs to.
Harry freezes. He’s not even holding a book. His hands are completely empty. Draco’s staring at him, into him, piercing but otherwise unreadable.
“Don’t think I didn’t consider it.”
I hadn’t accounted for the passion that burns in everything he does, for how he would treat a second time differently to the first. For how it could be now that so much else is changed between us. But it was even, for lack of a better descriptor,
Then Potter’s hands are at his robes, unhooking the clasps, and he forgets all of that completely.
Regardless, Potter was gone, off to shower and do whatever else he was going to do. Sleep through the rest of their Merlin-forsaken night together, maybe. He could leave on his own whenever he woke, and they’d never have to see each other again.
Draco closed his eyes. He heard leaves rustling under Potter’s feet and a surprised sort of noise coming from his direction. He quirked one side of his mouth into a smile. “If you do it with me.”
“Don’t you dare talk about my father.”
“Wizard, Muggle, gay?” Draco offered, shouting about the crowd.
“I have enough faith to risk it without protective earmuffs, for what it’s worth.”
He faltered on the last words. He meant them, meant them very deeply. But he hadn’t meant them to be funny, and Harry was smiling. He tried, not entirely successfully, to keep any petulance out of his voice. “What is it?”
“One,” Draco pauses.
Too hard. He sticks out his arms to keep himself colliding with it, and falls to the ground, limbs akimbo.
“Want me to give it to you?”
Harry settled across from him. Or tried to. He couldn’t entirely sit still. Draco wanted to grab his hand just to stop him playing with the silver. Or needed to stop him playing with the silver without grabbing his hand, because he wouldn’t want to let go once he had.
Noise in the background grew louder, and when particular chants grew distinct we both snapped out of that strange, warm haze. There was about to be a game on, and it wouldn’t do to be seen like that, for either of us. Which is why I withdrew my hand. I’m not sure why he didn’t let go.
Draco couldn’t entirely hide his surprise at such an overt refusal. “On the way back then?”
Harry leans back and spreads his legs, keeping his eyes on Draco, who feels his way back, who presses a finger against Harry’s hole and pushes, and Harry bears down around him, and he slips inside so easily.
Because he’s Harry Potter, Draco thinks. Because his father would have disowned him or dismembered Potter, or both. Because his mother wanted—wants—to see the line restored. Because the paper would have been accused of favouritism and never could’ve become what it is now. Because there would have been rampant speculation that he had Potter under
Thinks back to the reasons—the long list of very sound reasons—he’d had for leaving Potter.
“Shhhhhhh!” Malfoy hissed, holding out his free hand to signal that Harry should stay where he was. “You’ll ruin it!”
Potter cupped Draco loosely in his hand. “Could make you wait.”
“You’re asking me to move mountains. Can you at least tell me why?”
The door creaks open. Draco jumps but wills himself, with everything he’s got, not to look.
“Yes. But it continues to be promising, even if we need more time to realise that promise.”
“Beautiful,” fell out of Draco’s mouth unbidden, and, “Perfect,” and, “Want you.” Harry whimpered at each endearment, arching his hips to meet Draco’s hand.
Harry rolled up onto his side and looked at him. Malfoy’s eyes were closed. He shook his head back and forth slowly, rocking the crown of it across the plaster. He was pale and there were dark circles coming out beneath his eyes. He still didn’t ask for anything.
“In the flesh.” He spreads his hands. Drops them.
So he didn’t. He sat Potter on the edge of his desk, pulled Potter’s legs up around him, and kissed Potter until he was gasping, until Potter’s fingers dug into his shoulders as if asking for more. And then he slipped a hand down Potter’s back, and when he wandered towards the centre of Potter’s arse, he met with no objection.
Pansy leaned over to whisper into Draco’s ear. “You can go join him, you know.”
“Of course, Master Draco! We is elves!” And with that, a still-flustered Galder popped out of the room.
“Are you going to help me or not?”
He knocks again and waits until Philips interrupts.
It’s a blur until he gets back to rubbish disposal. He leans back against a post and listens for footsteps. There are none, thank Merlin.
“It’s never come up like that before, has it?”
When Granger blinked she closed her eyes for longer than could possibly have been necessary, but otherwise she held strong.
Harry relaxed at that, which was surprising; that he would want that sort of guidance. That something as simple as a jumper could make him nervous. Draco’s heart ached, and it swelled, and he wasn’t sure what to do except trace his fingers over the faint line of Harry’s ribcage, down to his waist and up again, over his sternum, one thumb settling in his clavicle while his fingers ran over Harry’s neck, over the base of his jaw, his pounding jugular. Harry turned his head, looking down between them.
Draco forestalled them with an extended hand. “He will be perfectly fine, but needs his rest. I will pass on your good wishes. Please, take your time to enjoy the food and tea, with compliments, and thanks very much for coming.”
He left the office with a very loaded wink for Millie and a much lighter heart.
“I did, yes.”
an item rather than
He’s in the office by 8, with a memo to F and L to send him the complete guest list for the HHS event, another to the photo team directing them to leave Potter alone until further notice, and a third on Higsbee’s desk with orders to see him immediately.
He complies immediately.
Draco’s startled into looking right into his eyes. “Yeah?”
“Oh?” Harry replies, a bit less enthusiastically.
“And half the time when we asked if you wanted to do something, you had plans with him,” Hermione added. “And it seemed as though they were rather big plans. You were talking about going on holiday together, and about bringing him round to dinner, and helping him get a job at the Ministry. He was at the pub with you more often than not.”
Hermione clapped her hands over her mouth, and her soft, “Oh,
Lunch lasted, and lasted, and Draco had work left to do afterwards. But even after several hours of reviewing patient files and a long, unusually roundabout walk home, Draco’s head was still spinning.
Malfoy laughed again. “All of this.” He waved an arm at the room, then dropped it back to his side with a thud as his arm hit the wall. “Everything I’ve told you. If you even heard it.” He shook his head and turned his eyes towards the ceiling.
Harry opened his eyes and spotted it. He looked up sheepishly. “Sorry?”
“That we needed to see the plans, and when it asked why – well, I didn’t think it would be that keen on having the Chamber closed forever, so I might’ve told it that we were protecting the Basilisk bones. It made me promise to do that, and then said it’d tell me the rest once I took it there. Why? Is that a problem?”
He knocked.
Draco stayed perfectly still, resisting the urge to pull back as the heat of Potter’s fist intensified. “Then prove me wrong. Do it.”
“Because in the course of daily life we all use magic while we’re feeling frustrated or angry. This is a chance—an intentionally controlled, safe chance—to see how those emotions affect the results of your casting.”
“Good question. He didn’t seem keen on finding out when I offered.”
“What were your guesses?”
His vision flickered as it rolled through him. His hand slipped on the pane, and then it was just Potter’s back holding him up, the world narrowed to the heavy satisfaction in his thighs and the heat of Potter’s bare skin pressed against his own. His breathing slowed. He dropped his hand to Potter’s shoulder and felt Potter relax beneath it.
“So you do remember.” Draco ignores the roiling in his stomach. “That was my preference far more than wanking.”
Draco felt the affront down to the tips of his toes. “You think I buy it myself? That’s what decorators are for you–” He clenched his jaw and force himself to exhale. “Do you want to make a deal or not?”
“So,” Draco replied. He paused. “I’m not sure how to…”
As if on cue from some particularly benevolent deity—quite possibly one that his father had paid off while sitting in this very seat—the door slid open again, admitting Granger and Millie. Behind them, peeking over Mill’s head, Draco saw the unforgettable, unmistakeable cheekbones of Blaise Zabini.
She quirked a smile. “True, if that’s all right.”
,” Luna corrected.
But I have bigger plans.
Draco blinked. It stung more than he would’ve liked it to. “Telling people what you want, going after what you want, doesn’t make you a coward.”
“Your house is under
Hearing his name pulled him out of his trance. He turned to Draco, shaking his head slowly, his eyes blazing. “You have Hippogriffs.”
Potter scowled. “And no insults. None. That’s a hard limit.”
He extends a shaking finger, but still, he worries. He sees Harry fisting the sheets. He knows this isn’t a memory.
He shakes his head.
Draco gaped at the back of his head. “I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Nine o’clock.”
Draco hugged himself against the wind. He didn’t say anything.
