'Nagini, Tom has said you are coming to protect me while we’re out.' He says kneeling down. He could hear Draco faintly moan and smirked. Seems like Draco had a Parsletongue fetish.
The public outcry to the article was tremendous. When Aidan and Draco, went out to find Rita they were mobbed. Wizards and witches were crowding around them and shouting things as Aidan and Draco walked hand in hand towards the Daily Prophet. All the noise was making it hard for Aidan to move.
Before Potter could continue, he was interrupted by Lucius, “He, Heir Potter? Who could you be speaking about?”
“Are you kidding me?!” Draco said shocked, “If I hadn’t acted been mean to the Weasel, then you would’ve been a Slytherin? You’re like the epitome of a Gryffindor!”
"A little farther to the left, Harry.” Tom says absently as he sits down. “So you want to be my equal, but you don’t want to rule? What makes you think you are strong enough to take that role? Why do you want to join the dark? What did Dumbledore do to make you want to join the dark so badly?”
“First up, the Slytherin heir rings.” It said handing Harry the ring and telling him to put it on his left pointer finger.
Quickly he responded to the letter and got dressed, trying to dismiss his worries. Nagini was with Harry and would protect him from any harm.
“The seat a few steps in front of you is yours. Young Draco here is to your right, I am to your left. Lucius Malfoy is right in front of you and Narcissa is diagonally to your right.”
“Maybe, but we have to check it out anyways.” His father said looking at the pictures on the mantel. “Look at this, he’s not in a single portrait or picture here.”
“Uncle Sev, hurry!” Draco exclaimed, running towards the bloodied form that was on the ground. There was a puddle of blood underneath the figure that had already soaked through the tattered bare clothes Potter was wearing.
Curious, he picked it up. A picture of Harry wearing sunglasses was the first thing he saw. Then he promptly chocked on his tea.
“Hello Rita. Thanks for coming to meet me here.” Harry says sitting down when he gets the signal that she was sitting in front of him. Tom was in the kitchen checking out the Order’s plans that they had left behind when they had been kicked out, for the time being.
Draco could see Tom’s eye twitch but couldn’t resist a giggle. “Right.” He says trying to get back on topic. “Well let me just read you the inheritance out loud and then the questions can be asked;
She was cut off by an amused Severus because both Tom and Lucius couldn’t stop laughing at the horrified expressions on both of the boys’ faces at how fast Narcissa was speaking and what she was talking about.
The star came down and the prince got on his back. The Dark Lord, Bellatrix Lestrange and his subjects arrived but couldn’t find the prince.
« Why are you crying, freak? Aren’t you happy to marry the great Bellatrix Lestrange? » asked the fat cousin.
Once upon a time, on a high hill in an isolated kingdom, lived hundreds of men called Death Eaters, whose king was called Lord Voldemort.
« Sire, don’t do this. If you kill him like that everyone will say that you are a criminal! Let us do this; send men to your farthest field. Ask them to dig a large pit. Then order them to throw in the first man on horseback who comes to them. »
Lord Voldemort as his name reveals, was fascinated by death. Or rather, he was afraid of death. So afraid that he had gone beyond the bound of what is usually called the realm of evil.
And the old man disappeared. The young boy didn’t understand any of this but he still kept his words.
A man showed up. The young boy had never seen a man so tall and with such shaggy hair and beard. He asked, still sitting on his horse:
Time passed again and the prince gave birth to a third child. The father, the former guard, whispered in the ear of the newborn:
Meanwhile in the castle haunted by remorse the prince went to see his father and told him the truth:
The king’s men had finished digging and they saw the right-hand man coming on his horse. They caught him, bound him, muzzled him, threw him into the ditch and covered him.
« Father, as soon as you left my crown was stolen and my room destroyed. And I'm sure it was your guard who stole it with his ability to make himself undetectable. Search his room, I know you'll find it hidden in his belongings. »
But The Dark Lord had a son, very beautiful, who didn’t look like his father, no. He was as beautiful as the moon, as bright as the brightest star in the sky,...
DM: I know, it’s just, with your disability I’m worried for you. The Order may find a way to get here and take you back to those dreaded muggles.
“You are welcome. It was you two who helped me out when I first entered this world so I just returned the favour.”
“Awww. Young love. It brings a tear to my eye.” The twins say with what Harry assumes – due to the movement of their magic body – is an overdramatized wipe away of a tear.
When Draco finally stopped covering his face in kisses, Aidan put the ring on Draco’s finger and smiled.
Then something strange, to Harry at least, happened. The two glowing spots where the heir rings were on his finger, melded together and became one ring.
RS: Well, what do you plan to do this year for school? You will be separated due to your different houses.
“Yes, Dumbledore. I can’t believe that Harry is corrupting my Fred and George. I should write a letter to Charlie and Bill to get them to come back and to make sure that they too aren’t becoming tainted by the Dark.”
“I’m to escort you there. Then I’m to take you to the room you’ll be staying in while you are here. Since we don’t want you to get lost, you’ll be staying in my room so I can help you. The house elves are putting another bed in there as we speak.”
“Hello everyone and thank you, Lord and Lady Malfoy for allowing me to stay here as you guest.” Harry says formally as he sits down.
“Harry! Harry calm down!” a familiar voice said to him from somewhere. “Calm down Harry, you’re safe. Calm down!” Now he remembered.
He would have to up the love potions to keep her from complaining so much. All that was left was to wait for Harry to walk out of Gringotts so that he could get him, using the voice activated portkey that he had to take him back to Grimmauld with him.
“Now, Sirius wanted you to be emancipated when he died, so we can do that now. He also wanted you to get an inheritance test as well as a test to see if there is any magic on you that shouldn’t be. That includes blocks, spells, and potions that may influence you in any way shape or form, good and bad.”
Readers, after the interview I went down to the ministry to see Sirius black’s files, because they were available to the public. I was astounded to see that there was no file. If you didn’t already know; when a person is tried, the magic of the trial makes a file for you it then tells if you were found guilty or innocent but it was always there. In order for him not to have a file, it would mean that there wasn’t a trial to begin with. I am shocked readers. How could the Ministry condone sending a head of an Ancient and Noble house to Azkaban without a trial? How could they also condone letting a ministry employee torture students with a Blood Quill? How could they also threaten one of those same students with an unforgivable? Where was Dumbledore throughout all these issues? The wards around Hogwarts shouldn’t even have been able to allow the Dark Artifact into the school, let alone him not know about it. These are the questions I’m faced with after I left my interview with Harry. I assure you readers, I will not rest until I get the answers.
“I don’t know my lord. The car was gone but most of their things were still there.” Severus said sitting in one of the chairs in Lucius’ office facing towards him. “All of his school supplies was locked in the cupboard under the stairs. His wand, a photo album, a map, and his invisibility cloak were underneath a board under his bed.”
After getting a secure hold around Potter, he touched his heir ring and said, “Malfoy Manor” and the portkey transport him home.
“Harry!!!” was the only thing he heard before he was practically tackled in the middle of the street.
Sirius had smiled his little secretive smile when Harry had told him about his crush for Draco. He had said not to worry about it, that he would do something to help out as well as make sure that Dumblefuck and his order couldn’t do anything about it.
Harry cleared his throat and held his hand out for the box, since he couldn’t grab it. When Tom handed him the box, he slowly moved towards his betrothed’s father. He kept a lookout for any objects that he might have missed, his familiars helping a lot with this task.
Harry let out a relieved breath and smiled widely. He couldn’t believe Draco liked him back! After all those years and all the agony that came with pretending that he didn’t like Draco, he could finally act on his feelings.
“Why, we are going to get the Nargles cleared from your head and to see if the Crumpled-Horned Snorkak gave you any gifts as well.” She said still pulling him along; she was surprisingly strong for a small girl.
“What?” he asks shocked. Last he remembered, Draco had decided he didn’t want to marry anyone. “Didn’t Draco say he didn’t want to get married for the time being? That he had his sights set on someone special and that he would probably not even date seriously until after Hogwarts?”
“What are we doing here Lucius?” Snape impatiently asked, waiting for a reason to why he had to leave his last potion just to come here to this quiet neighborhood.
AN: Sorry that this chapter is short. Hopefully, I’ll make the next one longer. Will everyone give me their opinion on whether or not you want me to turn this story onto an mpreg? This will help me determine how long this story will be.
To Narcissa Malfoy, I leave to you the knowledge that I know who you truly are and can only hope that there are no hard feelings. There is a letter for you that I wrote. Hopefully it will explain what I cannot right now.
“Perfect.” Harry answered, “But make it so the twins, and Bill can’t be forced to pay back the debt. I know that at least Dumbledore, Ron, and Ginny will try to force them. Molly might not be as forceful but I know she would try.”
Yes readers. It’s me again. Now I know that you have all probably read the interesting article that came out last edition. Well I’m telling you to ignore it. That’s right readers! Ignore the last article. It’s wrong.
“Yeah, Fred. My Uncle took one of his beatings too far and I was blinded because of it. Currently, I’m living with Draco, Dad, and the Malfoy’s.” Harry said looking directly at the twins.
“Like I said, the house elves know you are blind and filled your plate already.” Draco said to the unasked question. “On your plate there is eggs, scones, bacon, and pastries. To your right, next to your fork, is some jam.”
“Nothing extremely major, Just that Sirius had been teaching me some grey and Dark Arts when he could fight off the compulsion.”
Trust Potion – 50% (keyed to: Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, Albus Dumbledore, Molly Weasley, Arthur Weasley)
After he finished reading their letter, he thought deeply about what he was going to do. He finally decided to talk to Bill before officially deciding to go back. He strode towards the Floo, hoping to catch up with Bill before he went to bed.
As luck would have it, they both managed to find their familiars together. They both felt a connection inside the fox section of the store. Their familiars were obviously going to be mates and were curled up and entwined one on top of another.
“No.” The twin on the right said with angry fire in his eyes. “You got us messed up again! You call yourself our mother and you can’t even tell us apart! We’re tired of you doing this to us! Both you, dad, and the family have done it since we can remember. The only one in the family who hasn’t done that is Bill and the only one outside of the family who has ever gotten us right is Harry. From now on we refuse to acknowledge any of you as part of our family ever again!” they finish together before they Apparate away leaving a stunned silence behind.
“And to answer your question, I left the Dursley’s because they blinded me. It was in the papers, yesterday, I believe. If Draco hadn’t gotten my letter and came immediately, I would have died. We’ve been staying at Grimmauld Place.” Harry said looking to the left where he had last heard Dumbledore’s voice.
The next morning, when breakfast had ended and the Malfoy’s, Tom and Aidan, and Severus, plus all of Draco and Aidan’s familiars, had adjourned to the sitting room, Harry got up clearing his throat. Draco, who was slightly snuggling into Aidan, looked up with a small pout wondering what he was up to.
Narcissa was enraged. How dare that two faced slut think she can encroach on her son’s husband! Well, they weren’t married yet but it was only a matter of time. It was obvious ever since they were eleven that they would get together. After all, there’s only a thin line between love and hate.
To Ronald Weasley, I give you the advice to grow up. You are so jealous over how much money Harry has, that you seem to miss that he would give it all up to have a loving family like you.
“Arthur my dear boy, how is dear Molly?” Albus said as Arthur walked into the Headmaster’s office for another Order meeting.
“Great!! Now we should let the Prophet know about this new engagement before Dumbledore tries anything new. We should also start planning the wedding now that Draco’s wearing a ring. When do you two want the wedding to be? We could do winter? That’s always a good time, what with the winter solstice. And then the actual wedding. What flowers do you two want? What arrangements? Who do you want to-”
To Nymphadora Tonks, I cast you from the family line on the account of being non-faithful to the family line. I withhold the family magic to you making you lose your Metamorphmagus abilities. You could have had me freed at any time and you chose not to. We all know that Amelia Bones would have looked into it if you told her you had so much as a suspicion that I had not been given a trial. Instead, you listened to Dumbledore and didn’t tell anyone. Tonks screamed as her power was forcefully ripped from here. Her cries in pain lasted for a little bit before slowly subsiding.
“Hey Forge, do you think that H-Aidan and Draco will ever realize or confess their love for each other?” Fred asked George as they watched Draco, Aidan, and Tom walk from their shop.
“Sirius may have been put into Azkaban, taking him out of the running for guardian. But there was no trial so in the eyes of magic, he was still able to be magical guardian. Which is all we need. So that means, not only did you illegally place yourself as magical guardian of one Harry Potter, but you also had no right to control his vaults and seats in the Wizengamont, or to withhold them from him.
I am ashamed to even call you my daughter. I thought that I had raised you better than this. Abandoning your true friends for money, books, and status? What is wrong with you? I want you to take a really deep look at yourself and see if you are happy with who you are. Then do the same to your so called ‘friends’. Until I can look at you and see my bright-eyed daughter who was so happy to learn magic and staunchly supported Harry throughout all his challenges, I don’t want to see you anywhere near your father or me and our house. I’ve already talked to your father about it and he agrees whole-heartedly with me. I finish with only these two quotes you should remember, “A friend is one that knows you as you are, understands where you have been, accepts what you have become, and still, gently allows you to grow.” And “Making a million friends is not a miracle. The miracle is to make a friend who will stand by you when millions are against you.” See which type this Ronald boy and Ginevra girl is and then see what type Harry was.
Thank You so much for all the positive comments. I also love the constructive criticism! This made me rejuvenated to continue writing. I didn't know so many people loved this story!
“I hope that we can continue to do business as well. May your gold prosper.” Harry says with a bow towards the goblin sized haze.
This is an update of the will reading. Sirius was obviously more tainted by the dark then we thought. Instead of giving any money to the Order he gives it to Fred and George, who won’t give us anything; Remus, who we haven’t seen since the will reading, and Harry, who snubbed the rest of us. He didn’t even mention the Marriage Contract between my Ginny and Harry. Then he had the audacity to tell me that my trying to help bring up Harry was unneeded. ME! That’s not the worst part! Fred and George renounced me and Arthur as their parents! US! After all we’ve done for them. To top it all off, Harry has been getting extremely close to the Malfoy, Dumbledore is worried that Harry may be influenced towards the Dark Side. That’s why we need you to come home. Bill is getting the same letter and we’re hoping that the family will be together to fight the evil Darkness.
(Readers, this is where if you are a little squeamish or hate violence, you may want to stop reading. There are some very graphic things going to be said.)
“Yeah. If it hadn’t been brainwashed into me by both Ron and Hagrid that all Slytherins were evil and if you hadn’t dissed the first two friends I’ve ever had; then I would have been in Slytherin.”
/You need to find another familiar. You have too much power for me to be able to control. Just follow the bond and it should take you to your next familiar./
“The abuse had to have been happening since he was at least seven, maybe even before that. The malnourishment has definitely been happening since he was a baby.” Narcissa said starting to pull herself together, grief still evident in her tone. She had been unable to have another child after Draco due to complications and the thought of someone not wanting and abusing a baby caused her pain in her heart.
“My lord, I’m sorry to interrupt, but Potter’s owl was the one to deliver the note.” Draco said handing over the bloodstained note to Voldemort, who read it and then handed it over to his father.
He knew he should’ve made Harry write a will. The goblins wouldn’t let anyone touch a dead person’s money unless it was written in the will they could. That’s why he couldn’t touch Sirius Black vaults. He had to wait to see what he was given in the will. The confundus charm he had placed on Sirius should have worked and if not that, then the loyalty potion would have worked. Harry couldn’t be there either, just in case he got something major.
“I think that Aidan will finally have the family he deserved. Although you have to admit, when Aidan thinks he won’t be caught, he can be as cruel if not crueler than the Dark Lord. How anyone could think he was Light, I’ll never understand. His magic is as dark as could be.”
“That’s a Cù-Sith. I wonder how the owner of this shop found one. They usually stay with the fairies.” Draco said, his voice sounding shocked.
“Why did you want me here Potter? I got from our last meeting that you despised me.” She said from in front of him.
Hey everybody. I'm wondering whether or not to continue this fic. If you guys want me to continue I will but i'm not sure I will continue right now. It's just not as popular as my other fic.
“Well,” Draco says answering this question instead of the goblin. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but an inheritance ritual tells you everything that has been left to you, both by magic and by people. It is usually used after wars because whole families were killed off during them and purebloods used them to keep old families still living. Sirius must assume that you are the lord to more than just the Ancient and Noble houses of Black and Potter.”
“What all does the inheritance ritual include?” Harry asked tilting his head in a slightly questioning way.
“Harry…. You know we don’t care about that. We knew that it was only a matter of time before you went dark. Actually, the reason we were looking for you just know was so that you could take us to the Dark Lord. We’ve had enough of the so called ‘Light side’. We’re tired of them forgetting about us or thinking we’re useless. Just today our own mother couldn’t tell us apart. We’re just sick of it.”
“Alright. I better not catch you two in each other’s rooms!” Cissy shouts at the two blushing boys as they make their way to their rooms.
“Now that we’re in private, what was it that you wanted me to sign again?” Harry said while being guided to a seat by Draco.
“It is about knee height and has shaggy white hair with glowing green eyes. Its tail is braided back but is still pretty long.” Draco said trying to take in all the detail he could for his blind boyfriend.
“I now I’ve only been betrothed to Draco for a little time now, but I want to make sure that everyone in the world knows about it. So I am asking for your permission to ask for Draco’s hand in marriage?” Harry was slightly shaking as he opened the box and gave it to Lucius for his approval.
Harry dares a look at his Aunt and Uncle, awaiting their fury, only to find two identical looks of horror on their faces.
“Pet?” he called worriedly, as he saw his wife in the living room staring off into space. He paused as he started toward her, having noticed the boy with dark hair in his son's playpen. “Who's this?”
Petunia shoved her spatula into his hands, snapping him out of his thoughts. With this, Harry went over to the stove, flipping the eggs that are still cooking in the pan expertly. Cooking came naturally to Harry at this point. And why wouldn’t it? He had been cooking for the Durselys since he was 6 years old. Shaking his head, he puts those thoughts aside. ‘Best not think about it’ he thinks to himself.
Finally, there will be a rewrite posted eventually. We have been going through the story and finding quite a few issues with tenses, grammar, and phrasing that we would like to fix in order to give people a better reading experience. There shouldn't be any changes to the story line, and if there are, they won't be very major. One thing that we are not sure about is whether we should just edit the existing chapters or post the rewrite as a new story, so if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.
If you have any questions, comments, and/or concerns about book 1 or the continuation of the series, don't hesitate to contact me. But there will be no spoilers, obviously. Lol.
When Harry was with his parents, he had only known love and laughter. He hadn't known what it was like to go hungry. Never known what it was like to have a hand raised against oneself. Never known what it was like to be yelled at and belittled. He was their everything. But, on Halloween night that all changed.
Harry went to his backpack and pulled out a piece of paper and a pen (all of which were originally bought for Dudley but never used) and wrote a reply.
“I have nothing to say for myself, Aunt Petunia.” Harry says respectfully, biting back a sarcastic remark.
So, this is it! Book 1 is officially finished. Writing this has been an amazing learning experience for me and my amazing co-author, FreerSpirit.
Hey guys! So here is the next chapter and we're really sorry that it took so long. We finally got a base down for how we want the next few chapters to go so we will be posting every other week unless we run into some problems. By the way the next chapter will be the last Christmas chapter, finally, and we should be back to the regular storyline by chapter 20. FreerSpirit is having internet issues right now but you should be fine to post every other week. As always we would like to hear any suggestions about anything you want to see even if we have to add it to earlier chapters during editing.  We hope you enjoyed this chapter and thanks for sticking around!
“With their magic it’s just the slightest bit different. When I look at people, I see both the strength of their magic as it moves through their bodies and also the colour. Every body’s colour is a little different. Draco’s is silver, Dad’s is a mix between red and hazel. Fred and George’s are both blue but they’re both subtly different. Fred’s is a little bit lighter than George’s. It’s nothing major. I bet that if you paid attention, you could also pick it up.” Harry finished with a shrug.
His name was then cursed and he ended up being called The Dark Lord. For how can one name a being who has let down his humanity…
Once upon a time, just once upon a time, there was a young boy who was orphaned. His parents, before they died, left him an Invisibility cloak. This was his only legacy. That’s what he thought.
Dazzled by the charm of this beautiful prince, the young boy wanted to kiss him but he remembered the old man’s words:
A miserable little boy, orphaned and taken in by an old lady he called grandmother, came to the castle to take up the challenge.
The prince was submissive to his father, who decide everything in the castle and in all the Death Eaters territory.
The beauty of the monarch was blinding. His long, beautiful silver-blond hair and gray eyes were mesmerizing.
The king thought it was an excellent idea. So he asked his men to go and dig a deep and large ditch and to throw in the first man on horseback who would come to them.
« Sire, it is true the years weigh on my shoulders, but I still know what I say; I have put the meat "BY THE FIRE"! »
“Well, isn’t that… interesting.” Draco said as he finally walked into the room. “Before we do anything else, don’t you want to make sure that Dumbledore and his sheep can’t access your vaults without your explicit okay?”
“I would wish to know as well.” Harry said with a shrug. “I took an inheritance test and Draco said I couldn’t hear what it said until we had summoned you.”
“ALBUS, Albus come quickly to headquarters. Something’s wrong.” Molly shouted as she ran down the street to him.
“You have my permission to ask for his hand. I would say that I wish you luck, but I know that you will not need it Aidan. Welcome to our family.” Lucius finished with a smile.
HP: I did tell someone. I told Professor McGonagall. She just told me to keep my head down and not get in trouble. After that, I assume the other kids saw how none of the teachers helped the Boy-Who-Lived and didn’t even bother trying to ask. What’s worse is by the end of the school year, I had been tortured with a blood quill, almost drugged with Veritaserum, and threatened with the Cruciatus Curse.
It was a Hungarian Horntail in rose gold with a fiery gold flame that wrapped around two sparkling gems; a glistening sapphire and a blazing emerald. It was majestically beautiful. It completely symbolized Draco, the dragon was strong, like he had had to be for years in Slytherin, and delicate to show his actual personality and how he was with those he loved.
“Lord Black must have expected this to happen because he had us reserve a ritual room to get rid of all of the blocks, spells, and potions today. The side effects might be that you will be exhausted and your magic may not work correctly for two to five days. After we cleanse you of the potions I would advise you to eat afterwards because the potions have integrated with your system so it will feel like you don’t have enough nutrients in your body.” The goblin said checking to make sure he had covered all the bases. “Now, if you would just follow me we can begin.”
“Are you telling me that, against my requests, you have signed me up in a marriage contract to somebody I don’t even know?!!!” Draco shouted, starting to get angry now that the shock had worn off.
“It was Harry Potter’s owl and it had a note.” He said handing the bloodstained note to Voldemort, who read it then handed it over to his father.
But don’t worry my young readers! This marriage contract won’t be loveless. When asked who exactly he would be marrying, a smile light up his face like none I’ve ever seen. He told me that he was going to marry ‘the light to his darkness’.
SORRY!!! I'm so sorry that it took me so long for me to update. RL got a to be a little to much for me for a while. Hopefully I'll go back to updating regularly, but if I don't, once school finishes for the year, I'll for sure update a little better.
“I’m sorry father, but I thought this was something that couldn’t wait.” He said trying to catch his breath.
Aidan slowly went on one knee in front of Draco, who had both of his hands over his mouth in shock and had tears glistening in his eyes.
Dumbledore’s eye twitched before he took a deep breath and slid his grandfatherly persona back onto his face.
“What’s in the box?” Lucius questioned, already having a small idea of the mystery inside it. Or more correctly, the jewelry inside it.
“I don’t know Gred.” George sighed “The attraction is apparent in their every move. Hopefully whatever it is that Sirius did will make them recognize it.”
“WHAT? THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE!!! THERE WAS A CONTRACT MADE BETWEEN HARRY AND I. IT WAS COMPLETELY VALID!” Ginny shrieked like a banshee.
Glaring from the direction Dumbledore’s voice came from, “Yeah, that’s why I got a letter before I left the Dursley’s stating that you, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and Mr. Weasley have been stealing from me. I would also appreciate it if you would refrain from trying to put compulsion charms on me.” He said with a tone so cold everyone could feel a shiver rundown their back, but for different reasons. For Draco, it was with lust, but for everyone else it was fear.
“It’s actually really simple if you pay attention and really want to. Before I was blind I could tell by a few cues, like Fred was a little softer than George. Fred would also be the start of the more mischievous ranks to get everyone to laugh. George is usually the start of the pranks made to specifically humiliate and embarrass people.
Fred and George exchanged looks before saying together. “You might want to sit down this is a long story.”
HP: Yes. I’m sorry for the secrecy but I don’t want anyone to know where I am until I’m ready for it.
“Okay.” He says as he uses his emergency portkey that would take him to the house infirmary where he knew his mom would be set up waiting.
“Harry, just wait for him to get here. Everything will be explained then.” Draco said trying to calm him.
“The Dark Lord told me to tell you that, when you calmed down, he would see you in his office.” He said looking at the boy in front of him. He had always thought Harry Potter was good-looking but, now that he had a chance to be closer he could see that he was in fact extremely handsome instead.
Aidan and Draco went through the bonding process again before finally deciding on the names Lerato for Draco’s male shadow fox and Anima for Harry’s female shadow fox, both meaning soul.
At that comment, Tom’s magic which was already faintly swirling around the room, became palpable and things started to rattle in the room.
Harry sighed with relief, he was completely uncomfortable with the magic that layered over him to make the glamour. Ever since the seal on his magic was broken, he had become a lot more sensitive to the magic cast on him or near him.
Fred and George’s mouths were wide open staring at him in shock. Nobody had been able to explain how they could tell the two of them apart so matter-of-factly before.
“We are in the middle of the Entrance Hall. The door seven normal steps to your left will put you in a hallway that will eventually lead to the kitchens and dining room. The dining room is closer to here than the kitchens. The house elves know about what happened; so if they find you wandering around or lost, expect them to help you out. You could also call one if you need to get somewhere or something and I am unavailable. We will probably assign a house elf to you. The door twelve steps to your right lead to the wings where you can find most of the bedrooms. My parents and the Dark Lord have rooms somewhere else and those are warded to keep people out, so don’t worry about accidently entering their rooms. The door five steps behind you, as you know, leads to the Infirmary. It also leads to the Owlry where your owl will be when you don’t need her. About eight to ten steps in front of us is a door that will lead to the ballroom and it will also lead to where we’re going, which is the Dark Lord’s office. My father also has an office this way as well.” He says as he leads Potter to the door in front of him as he finished his speech. “This manor is pretty big so don’t be afraid to ask directions or help. I still get lost sometimes if I’m not paying attention to where I’m going.”
RS: What disability is this? Why are you hiding out from the Order? Why are you so friendly with Draco Malfoy? What muggles are Draco talking about?
“Now, James and Lily Potter are not actually my parents. They are my adopted parents. My parents are actually dark.” Here he looked at the twins for their reaction, hoping that it would be a good one.
Harry couldn’t stand the sadness he heard in Tom’s voice, so he got up and slowly moved towards where he had heard Tom’s voice. He soon reached Tom and bent down to give him a hug. Harry yelped as Tom yanked him down to sit on his lap as Tom wept into Harry’s shoulder muttering “My son is alive. He’s alive.” Over and over again.
“The Tinkerbes gave me a gift. They were sorry about my mom so they gave it to me.” Luna said with a mysterious smile on her face that only Neville and Draco could see.
Lucius and Tom exchanged smiles happy about Draco’s reaction to the paper. They were happy that he actually meant it when he said he cared and wasn’t just being pressured into the engagement. Narcissa had already known about Draco’s love for Aidan, but she couldn’t even think about that because of her anger for what was written in the Prophet.
Tom, never expecting Harry to call him father so soon after learning the truth, calmed down fairly quickly. Most of that though, was do to shock.
“You are correct heir Malfoy. I would advise doing both though, your lord rings may not accept you if your under any compulsions.” The goblin adds.
“Now look here, my dear boy-” Dumbledore began, “Since Sirius was put into Azkaban I was made magical guardian by proxy. I had the right to do as I see fit.” He said conveniently forgetting that Harry hadn’t left the room.
“Well not exactly, more like I can see your magical core and how your magic is dispersed throughout your body. It’s like your magic runs in veins throughout your entire body so that’s what I see. I can’t see any features but it’s instinctive to know how tall you are based on where the magic stops. The more powerful you are, the easier it is to ‘see’ you.” Harry explained as he stood up.
HP: (Harry snorts here) Umbridge was an evil bitch. Her classes were all theoretical and we learned nothing. We couldn’t complain though or else we would get punished. Her punishments included writing with a blood quill until the saying was permanently scarred on our hands.
Draco walked in behind them and stopped, looking at the sight. Then he breathed the two words that they were all thinking, “Dear Merlin.”
It took Aidan down one aisle and a turned corner before he made it to the four-legged animal section. He followed the pull until he stopped right before a cage with what sounded like a wolf cub padding along the inside of it. The magic circulating throughout the animal made it out to be about knee height.
Harry and Draco were surrounded by well-wishers the second they walked towards Gringotts. After a while of smiling, unknown touches, and answering questions, Nagini got tired of being surrounded by people and hissed.
“Before we get to the keys, let’s make sure that the rings accept him as lord of the house or, in the case of Lord Riddle here, heir. All you have to do is put them on. The magic will either accept you or not.”
(He then pulls out his wand, points it to his face and says a ‘Finite’. The glamour placed there dissolves and I gasp in shock. Harry Potter’s eyes are a very pale, misty green instead of the vibrant green they had been a second a go.)
“Why didn’t you tell anyone about the abuse, brat?” Someone who sounded suspiciously like Snape snapped.
Remus, I’ve given you 3,456 galleons. At least half of it is to go to your wardrobe and the other part is to start up and fund a werewolf foundation for other werewolves like you. In that vault I left you a letter that explains some things. I am ashamed of you, when I got out of Azkaban I expected the Remus I knew and love, the one who thought things through and kept us mostly out of danger. Not a Dumbledore fanatic who didn’t think twice about our cub being in danger 24/7. You’ll always be in my pack, but I have to say I am ashamed. Here Remus started to silently cry, only Harry could hear it with his enhanced hearing due to the fact he was blind.
Harry quickly retreats to his room. Exhausted from the day, hoping to get some sleep, he closes his eyes to the sound of scraping silverware on plates.
“And last, to Mister Harry Potter. It takes much determination and cunning to successfully stand against one who is more experienced than you. Not only that, but conviction and strong morals are required to stay true to your objective. For this, I award sixty points.”
I regret to inform you, as of last night, October 31, 1981, your sister and her husband, James Potter, were murdered by Voldemort. They died while protecting their son, Harry. I have decided that as his next of kin, it would be best if you were to care for him. The night o f the attack on the potters, lilly accidentally enacted a very powerful protection, which is tied to blood. I have also added more to ensure he and your family are safe. The protections will only stay in place if he calls this place home. Should he leave before his majority at 17, and the wards fall, he and your family could be attacked by the remaining Death Eaters. So, as long as he lives here, your family is protected. I would also like to remind you, the wards will fall when he has reached his majority in the wizarding world at 17.
“Oi, Potter! How does it feel to have lost the House Cup? With your ego, it must feel pretty terrible.” Harry comes to a dead stop, instantly recognizing the grating voice of Ron Weasley.
The Slytherin table looks at Harry and Draco in shock, a glimmer of Hope sparking in their eyes. Dumbledore continues.
A/N: Hey guys, we started having very brief point of view changes in the last chapter. We didn't indicate them because they are so brief and it's usually noticeable by the wording. If it's not clear enough, let us know and we will start pointing out the changes. Thank you for reading.
https://fanlore.org/wiki/Wix#:~:text=Urban%20Dictionary%20has%20this%20definition,alternative%20to%20witches%20or%20wizards.
A/N: Thank you to those who are reading this story. I am going to try to post a chapter every Friday. If there is ever an occasion where I won't be able to post for a while, it will be put in the A/N at the end of a chapter.
We also would like some advice on something we are planning to write into the story. In a previous chapter we mentioned a trial against the Dursleys and to change Harry’s guardianship. We have been doing some research on the subject, but there is quite a bit of information and we aren’t exactly sure what we can use that fits into a Wizarding Trial. If you have any suggestions, or if you have read something like this before, please PM us or leave a comment. We would really appreciate the help!
When Harry and Draco walk in, every eye is immediately on them, all heads turned and all conversations silenced. The attention makes Harry slightly uncomfortable, but he refuses to show weakness in front of the entire school. As such, he begins to stride confidently over to the Slytherin table, noticing along the way that the Great Hall is adorned with Ravenclaw banners, indicating that Ravenclaw has won the House Cup.
Thank you for reading! We hope you enjoyed this chapter. Please feel free to leave comments and feedback.
“What in god’s name have you been doing you lazy brat? You know what is expected of you, yet for some reason you think it’s okay to slack off? The dishes are still piled in the sink and the floors are absolutely filthy. Well? What do you have to say for yourself?” Harry’s aunt rants at him relentlessly.
When Petunia pulled away she began to explain her plan. She had decided they would keep the boy for the protection of their family. He would be provided with the bare minimum and he would work to earn his keep. They quickly came to their next dilemma, where he would sleep.
Vernon’s face turned a dark shade of red, quickly resembling a tomato. “So he’s one of those freaks, is he? Why is he here, Pet?”
“Yes, yes, well done Ravenclaw, well done. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award.” The Great Hall falls into a hush, confusion flooding the room. Harry and Draco glance at each other, both coming to the same conclusion about where this is going. “To Mister Draco Malfoy and Mister Harry Potter, twenty five points each for the use of cool intellect while facing great peril.”
Harry dresses quickly, hoping to avoid the daily complaints about his apparent laziness. So what if he didn't wake up at ass-o-clock in the morning. It'd be a miracle if Dudley woke up before noon if he didn't have his mother yelling at him like a banshee every morning. Not that it matters. Dudley was their "perfect little angel". Well, let me tell you, Dudley Dursely is the furthest you can get from angelic without heading into demonic territory… And he definitely isn't little either.
Harry turns his head to meet Draco’s gaze, smiling as he recognizes happiness and contentment in his friend’s grey orbs. Harry returns the sentiment, hoping the intensity of his feelings will shine through.
“Of course we knew,” Petunia begins,” How could we not? What? With my perfect little sister being what she was. When you showed up on our doorstep, I knew you’d be just as strange, just as unusual. I knew you’d be a freak, just like you mother and father.”
“Didn’t Dumbledore tell his loyal chickens? Vernon,” Here Harry spat the name with enough hatred to make everyone in attendance flinch, “this summer, after begging Dumbledore not to put me back there and being shot down once again, I told myself that I would fight back. Well, Vernon didn’t take well to that. He beat me black and blue and I almost died. Thankfully my dear friend Hedwig managed to get me paper and a quill and I was able to write a distress note, in my blood. Hedwig sent it off to Draco, who saved my life. Without him I would be dead instead of just blind.”
“Great.” Harry could hear the smile in Tom’s voice. “You will take a shrunken Nagini with you until you get your familiar. After the reading, you will go get a familiar with Draco. If, for whatever reason, it’s located in Knocturn Alley take this bracelet and anyone who is either a Death Eater, or a Dark supporter will see it and know that you are under my protection.”
“Dumbledore has told the Prophet that Ginny Weasley is pregnant with your heir and you will marry her due to a marriage contract. Apparently, you are thrilled to marry her and are so glad that she is carrying your heir. You have also stated that you shall do whatever you can to make her life comfortable and provide for her and her family.” Draco finished off still seething.
That comment stopped everything. Tom was jolted out of his thoughts and Aidan’s face went completely blank. There was no emotion seen on his face or in his eyes. Draco’s reaction was the worst. His face went extremely pale, paler than normal. He almost looked like he was going to pass out.
After they worked out a way for Fred and George to contact Aidan when they needed to, Aidan, Draco, and Tom all go to the Apparation point in order to Apparate back to Malfoy Manor. Ever since the twins had started to talk about Aidan’s spying and assassin abilities, Tom had had a thoughtful expression on his face. He obviously was thinking about something pretty important so Draco and Aidan left him alone to his thoughts.
Harry blushed. “I just haven’t found an opportunity. When we met I was passed out, then I found out I was blind, there was about a day of an adjustment, then we had an interview with Rita, then there was the will reading, after that was the inheritance testing and claiming of all my lordships, and right after that we ran into you. I was planning on telling Dad and Draco at least today though.”
Crack! The window in the dining room that overlooked the garden shattered at that announcement. Everyone looked towards Aidan who had an extremely icy expression on his face.
“Yeah. I’ve wanted to call you that since I first heard your name. Let’s head towards the dining room. I’m starving.” Aidan added walking towards where he hoped the dining room was located.
“Not doing very well. She hasn’t left their room and hasn’t stopped crying. She’s acting like their dead.”
Sorry for taking so long to update. School has really caught up to me and I didn't have the time or the motivation to right. Hopefully I'll be able to update at least once per month. We'll see though.
Molly was sitting in her room crying and thinking about her decisions. How could she not have known the difference between the twins? She was their mother! That brought out a new round of tears.
“No dragon, I would never marry you off to somebody you didn’t know. This person is very prominent in the community and will bump up our social status quite a bit.”
When they got to the house, his father unlocked the door and they all went in. Nothing appeared to be wrong, but something felt off.
“Hello?” He called out, trying to get a response from the person who had obviously just been running their hand through his hair. Obviously, someone had gotten his note and saved him. Hopefully they weren’t apart of His group.
Draco was the next to find his familiar. He led Aidan to a cage a little farther back inside the cats section.
He slowly made his way into his bathroom with his hands out in front of him. When he reached the door, he opened it and made his way to the sink to brush his teeth and get ready.
“Okay. As I was saying earlier, James and Lily aren’t my parents. My parents are actually the Dark Lord and Mariela Evans. I was taken from my parents by Dumbledore during a raid on one of the dark houses. He killed my mother and led my dad to assume that I had also died. I don’t know if James and Lily were in on it, but I do know they adopted me. I found out about my being adopted because of an inheritance test. Draco called the Dark Lord and he accepted me as his son. He’s also here right now.” Harry finished with a smirk on his face.
Oh my god! I can’t believe Siri did this!! I can’t believe he knew!! What if Draco hates me for making him marry me? What if he doesn’t want to marry me? I’m so worried!! Were the thoughts going through Aidan’s head as he stood with a frozen expression on his face.
“Now,” Harry said turning to where the goblin’s voice was last heard. “can we take off all the blocks, spells, and potions today or do we need to come back?”
“I don’t know, I had come in to check if this had been Harry and Malfoy’s ‘safe house’, while the others went to change clothes or get some of their belongings, not feeling it was safe now that they couldn’t control who owned it. As soon as I tried to enter the kitchen where all the Order’s papers were, the house started shaking. After it had shook for a while, the front door opened and I was sent out as well as all the others. I came to get you a few minutes late.” Molly said indignantly.
“I know for a fact that you do have to inform your teachers, because there are things that happen in classes that being blind prevents you from doing. Especially in Potions class, you have to work with a partner who knows what they are doing so that you don’t blow something up accidently.” Tom said joining into the conversation.
After taking a minute for Aidan to get used to the noise, Draco guided Aidan towards the center of the store before allowing Aidan to let his magic guide him.
“Aidan!” Tom called when he saw Draco and Aidan home with their new familiars. “I need to talk to you about something you wanted me to do for you.”
Draco was in awe. He couldn’t believe that this man, this extremely strong, extremely good looking man, was into him. The magic swirling around him was only a testament to that power. As more and more things were picked up and were added to the mass chaos of glass already swirling around the room, Draco realized that someone would have to calm Aidan down. Slowly Draco stood up from his seat and moved towards his boyfriend.
“Yeah who didn’t know about them? They were brutally attacked and the Light assumed it was me eve thought the Dark Mark wasn’t cast. The Dark knew it wasn’t me and it wasn’t any of my rogue Death Eaters. Are you saying that was Harry?” Tom asked when it clicked.
HP: Dumbledore was the one who placed me there. He left me on their front porch step along with a note telling my Aunt that her sister and her brother-in-law where killed and that she had to take me in and raise me as well as raise her son too. At the end of first year and the year after that, I begged him not to let me go back there. He always brushed me aside and told me that I had a vivid imagination or he told me to stop making up lies about my relatives, that they were great people. After a while I just stopped asking and the punishments just got worse. I thought that at least at Hogwarts I’d get a reprieve. That changed my fifth year when Umbridge joined the staff.
Dumbledore had been sitting in his office when one of his silver doohickeys (AN: I don’t know what they’re called so this is what I’m calling it. If you know what they are, put it in a review and I’ll change it.) started to go off. It was followed by two more. They all had one thing in common; they were all tied to one Harry Potter: The Boy Who Lived. The first one told Dumbledore that Harry was dying. The second told him that Death Eaters had breached the wards, and the last said that the blood wards had failed. Then, all of a sudden, they all went silent. The only thing that could make the third one stop was if Harry was either dead or no longer considered #4 his home. And the latter wasn’t possible because of all the compulsion spells and loyalty potions, not to mention the personality-changing potion he had made Harry ingest to keep him compliant.
“There was a marriage contract made that Sirius was supposed to give the approval of in his will.” Ginny said snobbishly.
Harry grins and bows dramatically, one arm across his stomach and the other thrown out to his side. “Of course, M’lady!” Harry straightens and takes Hermione’s arm in his own, hearing Draco laugh at his antics.
He turns back to his Aunt and Uncle saying, “It came yesterday afternoon. It’s from a school called Hogwarts. They… they say I’m a wizard. They say I have magic.”
When he’s broken from his thoughts, Harry realizes that he’s finished. ‘I really need to work on staying out of my head and actually paying attention.’ He chastises himself. And it’s surprising that he hasn’t learned already. What, with his so-called family lunging for his throat at every turn. Although, if he thinks about it, that could be just the reason he retreats into his head so often. He still has that nasty little habit of thinking, ‘If I can’t see it, it can’t see me.’ And more often than not, that mentality transfers over to his more serious life problems.
On the other side of the door lies a small child swaddled in a white blanket. She bends down quickly and scoops the child up in her arms. "No child should be left out in this cold unattended!" she says aloud to no one in particular. The child squirms in her grasp, his sobs turning quickly into silence as he is comforted by her warm embrace. As the child moved, a thick envelope with elegant writing on the front peaks out from within the blanket.
With exams quickly approaching, the castle is relatively calm; If you consider a near constant atmosphere of study induced panic calm. The endless, stressful cycle of study is only broken by the occasional prank form the twins and Harry. One of their latest masterpieces being a scheme where they condemned a few of their classmates to speak in song for a day. The prank was a complete success, and a large majority of the student body appreciated the distraction immensely.
Harry decides he should do the gardening first. Pulling out all of the weeds and deadheading the flowers won’t take long. And besides, he wants to put off human interaction as long as possible. Human interaction meaning Dudley Dursely and all of his charismatic charm. Harry laughs at his own sarcasm.
“Well, neither did you, Weasel. And, just in case you haven’t noticed, or you’ve forgotten basic mathematics, Slytherin scored higher than Gryffindor. So, if I were unfortunate enough to be you, I would shut my mouth before embarrassing myself further.” Draco is using his patented snobby aristocratic tone; The one he reserves for people who are being particularly annoying or stupid.
Just wanted to let the people who are following this story know that the update schedule for this fic may be less consistent for the next month or two. My friend and I just started back at school again for our senior year and it could take a few weeks for us to get back into a school schedule. Of course, we will try as hard as we can to get a chapter posted every week, but if we can't please don't think that we're abandoning this story. Our goal is to eventually start post two chapters a week so we will be slowly working up to that within the next few months. Thank you to everyone who has been reading, commenting, and leaving kudos! You all have been unbelievably supportive.
Once Weasley is seated, Hermione turns to Harry and Draco, her eyes softening considerably as she gives them a sheepish smile.
“Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. In third, Hufflepuff with 352 points. In second place, Slytherin with 426 points.” Most of the Slytherin table groans. Yeah, second place is good, but first place is better. “And finally, in first place, with 472 points, Ravenclaw!”
When his uncle told him he wouldn't be going to Hogwarts, he reluctantly sent a letter back saying as much. And as much as he wished he could run from this place and go anyway, there was no way for him to get there or to pay for it all.
“Now,” Dumbledore begins and the room falls into silence as he continues, “If my calculations are correct, that brings Slytherin to the lead with an outstanding five hundred and eighty six points.” Dumbledore claps his hands and the banners hanging from the ceiling change from Ravenclaw blue to Slytherin green, rousing the Slytherins into celebration once more.
“Once again, to Mister Potter and Mister Malfoy, I award twenty five points each for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has ever seen.
Petunia’s glass of orange juice shatters next to her and Vernon is instantly standing. “You will not perform magic in this house, and you will not be going to that school.” Vernon fumes, causing Harry to back away from his uncle’s bulk nervously.  His uncle lunges at him, smacking Harry across the face with the back of his hand and knocking him to the floor. He then takes Harry’s arm into his meaty hand and drags him forcefully through the hallway. He opens the door to Harry’s cupboard and shoves him inside, glaring unapologetically at him when he stumbles and falls, hitting his head on the way down. Vernon slams the door and locks it. Seething, he says,” You’ll not be coming out until you learn some respect, boy.” Then, he promptly leaves Harry alone in the dark, wondering what he had done to deserve a life like this.
Muted claps come from the Gryffindor table and most of the Gryffindors have dark expressions on their faces. Hermione, however, jumps up from her table, grinning. She runs over to the Slytherin table and pulls Harry and Draco up from their seats. She pulls them into a hug, laughing and smiling.
Draco shakes his head fondly and comes up to Hermione’s other side, offering his arm to her too. “May I too have the honor?” Hermione doesn’t answer, instead laughing and looping her arm around Draco’s.
He looks to the clock and realizes that he needs to have his chores done in an hour. He rushes to put his shoes on while going through a mental list of what still needs to be done.
Thank you to everyone who's been reading! I am going to be out of town for the next few weeks and am not sure if I will have service. If I do then this story will continue on its normal update schedule. If not then I will post the chapters for the weeks I was gone as soon as I get back. Thank you again and as always, comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.
Weasley snaps his mouth shut, grinding his teeth together angrily. He scoffs, then turns on his heels, trudging back over to his seat at the Gryffindor table.
Together, the odd trio makes their way over to the Slytherin table, ignoring the disbelieving stares of Hermione’s fellow Gryffindors.
A/N: Hey all! For anyone who doesn't know a "wixen" is "n. pl. Magical people. Wixen is a gender neutral alternative to witches or wizards." Basically it's just another word to use. The singular form is "wix". I did originally read this word in another fanfiction. I don't know the author but thank you for adding this to your story.
When the eggs are done he places them on a large plate and brings it to the table where the Durselys are seated. Dudley, who has already helped himself to the bacon and pancakes made by his mother, tears the plate from Harry’s grasp the moment it is within reach. Harry rolls his eyes, exasperated.
“He will not be sleeping with my son, I won't allow it! I don't want my son to catch his Freakishness” Vernon bellowed, ignoring the two sleeping babes in the house.
‘Thank you, Dudley, for yet another thrilling addition to the conversation.’ Harry thinks sarcastically. Harry looks at Dudley… And promptly ignores him.
Petunia woke up to the faint cries of an infant. Believing it to be her son, she rushed to Dudley’s room, ready for anything and expecting the worst. She soon realizes that the crying she hears isn't coming from inside the house, but from the doorstep. She reaches tentatively for the knob, hesitating slightly. She finds her resolve and opens the door.
“Just sit down, Weasley. Every time you open your mouth you lower the reputation of your entire house.”
Although, there are some days where his pride comes in as a close second, demanding attention. But once again, he knows better.
Ron goes to lunge at Draco, ready to use their close proximity to gain the upper hand, but he is halted by Hermione jumping in between them. She puts a hand to Ron’s chest, holding him back as she stands in front of Draco protectively. She glances back at Draco to find him staring at her in shock. She turns back and fixes Ron with an icy glare.
A/N:We did not write the Hogwarts class schedule. We copied it from this site. All credit goes to the owner/s.
Harry examines the hard set of Draco’s jaw and the coldness in his eyes before deciding to give into his best friend’s request. He backs up a few steps, just enough to give Draco his space, but not enough to keep him from being able to get to Draco in time if anything happens.
We wanted to let everyone know that we have about 2-3 more chapters left and then we are DONE with book one. We will then take a break as we edit this one and start writing chapters for the second book. If there is anything in specific you would want changed in book 1 or anything you want to see in book 2 just leave a comment or message us. We also wanted to let you know that we DO read your comments and take them under consideration even when we don't respond.
Despite Harry’s problems with this room, he doesn’t actually mind doing the dishes. The procedural movements help to reclaim a sense of order in this absolute shit-show he calls a life. He notices his aunt standing behind him, waiting for him to finish so she can start dinner. He looks to the clock and is startled to see it’s nearly 5:30. He’s a half an hour late finishing up his chores. That means he won’t be eating dinner tonight. Just add it to the list of things he has to look forward to. Harry rolls his eyes, anticipating the annoying hunger that will undoubtedly begin to gnaw at his insides soon. He wipes off the counter, turning to his Aunt.
A few minutes later, the sound of hurried footsteps made it to Harry’s ears a few seconds before the door banged open. Draco jumped a little from surprise at the sudden noise but Harry stayed where he was already knowing that Tom had been coming a few seconds before he burst through the door.
After moving to Lucius’ office in order to have a chance to talk about what they found, Voldemort asked, “Where are his relatives?”
Luna smiled her mysterious smile before saying. “Do you like the gift the Crumpled-Horn Snorkaks gave to you? You need your sight after all. They are sorry they couldn’t give it all to you. The Flutterbys are happy that you still have some family though. They were overjoyed that you could finally get a familial relation.”
“Well, Mr. Potter, may I call you Harry? Harry, I have some bad news for you.” Mrs. Malfoy said gently to him. “You are blind. Your uncle did something to your eyes and you can’t see ever again.” She finished sadly.
Throughout this whole thing, Fred and George were still laughing, it progressed until they were on the floor, and could barely breathe because they were laughing so hard.
Hey everyone!! I’m not dead!!! Sorry this one is extremely short. Next chapter will be longer I swear on Draco Malfoy’s hot ass. I just thought you would like something to tie you over for now.
“How could it go so wrong? Ever since Sirius’ will- That’s it!! Lily and James will! We made sure to have the marriage contract written in their will!! I’ll just have to unseal it.” Dumbledore smiled and penned a quick note to send to Gringotts. Things were finally on the right track.
(Here, readers, Draco did something adorable. He not only helped Harry up, but he also had the gentlest expression on his face as he did so. Draco then guided Harry’s hand to mine to shake and then shook mine himself. I’m sorry ladies for those vying for their affections, but I predict these two bachelors will be dating sooner rather than later.)
Speaking of Sirius, how was he able to change the will? He shouldn’t have been able to fight off the compulsion spell that made him give most of the Black money to Dumbledore.
“Whoa! Calm down a second Cissy. They just got engaged. We can check the marriage contract and sign it now so that someone like Dumbledore can’t try to coerce Aidan into marrying someone or trying to get his money.” Tom said trying not to laugh at the boys’ wide eyes at what Narcissa was saying. Lucius was also trying to hide his amusement at what his wife was saying.
When they had finished the goblin greeting, Harry took Draco’s hand and let him and Tom lead him out of the bank.
As she was crying, Dumbledore entered closing the door behind him and setting up a Privacy barrier so that no one would hear what was happening inside the room.
“Okay Draco, ready to go.” Harry said looking towards the general location he last heard him in as he put Nagini around his neck.
“Aidan! Stop this! Calm down and let’s talk about what we’re going to do about Dumblefuck and his band of merry idiots.” He shouted hoping that it would be enough to get through to Aidan’s rage fest.
“Right.” He said as he put Potter’s head in his lap and held his mouth open. After Snape poured the potion down Potter’s throat, he rubbed his throat to makes sure Potter swallowed.
Hey everyone!! I'm alive!! I'm on break so i have time to type. For those following my other story, hopefully i'll get a chance to update that one as well but no promises. For those wondering what's going to happen to Fawkes, i have an idea for him and maybe i'll use it for the next chapter.
“I don’t understand why no one else bothers. Even though you two are twins, you are different people. There’s a reason why identical twins are considered one soul in two different bodies. Two bodies, two people, two personalities – no matter how similar the personalities are. Calling identical twins the same person would be like saying that soulmates are the same person as well. They complete each other yes, but they aren’t the same.” Harry said explaining his reasoning.
There were quite a few things that Harry had no reason to learn about. Like the fact that he was really adopted.
“Oh,” Harry said, “Do you know if the house elves at Hogwarts do the same?” he asks genuinely curious.
“All right, Draco you can show yourself now.” Harry said looking to the general direction of where Draco had said he would be.
“I didn’t know I was adopted.” He said a little sadly. “Just another thing Dumbledore kept from me.”
Bloodhook didn’t say anything for a minute just processing what was said before he started to speak rapidly in Gobbledygook.
“Dragon! You’re rambling. Calm down. I’m finished getting dressed so we can go to the Dining Room now.” Aidan said stopping the young Malfoy from speaking.
AN: Hey Everybody!! Sorry I’m so late on this. During Thanksgiving Break I greeted sleep like an old friend and it didn’t want to let me go. This update still technically counts as the November update in my book, so expect a December update sometime in the future. And no I am not abandoning either one of my fics. I have decided that you guys will decide the familiars for Draco and Aidan. Just send me a comment or PM saying what the animal is, it can be magical or nonmagical, and maybe why you picked it. Whoever’s I pick will also get to decide on something else they would like to add into my fic as an incentive. Hope you like the chapter!!
He was at Malfoy Manor, he had been blinded by his uncle and was now sharing a room with Draco Malfoy. Yesterday he went to the Dark Lord to ask if he could be part of the dark side and was accepted. Today, he was supposed to work on his casting now that he is blind as well as show Tom what he could do.
Luckily, the magic started to die down and Aidan looked visibly calmer. Everyone sighed in relief, no one wanted to get hit by the floating objects that were only now settling down.
Harry had had enough of his relatives for the day. From the moment he got back, he had been worked to the bone. He was also being starved and beaten again. He decided to go to the park to get away for a little bit. While he was sitting in the park, in a secluded area that most people didn’t know about, an owl flew up to him. He saw that it had the Gringotts seal on it. He opened it up and it said:
“Okay. I’m ready to go whenever.” Potter says wobbling a little as he stands up, trying to regain his center of balance. Draco, seeing he was about to fall onto the bed post, rushed forward to help steady him. He held Potter’s hand as he led him out of the Manor Infirmary. Potter’s hand felt very warm and soft in his.
I, Sirius Black, being of gorgeous hair and body, and of a sane enough mind do hereby present my last will and testament. What I say is absolute and no wills and agreements up to this day may counteract this.
Harry reached deep into his mind like he used to do when he was younger before he was obliviated and found his core. It was a pulsing light green and blue ball. He could see that there was another person’s magic over half of his core and that core was almost black. Harry pumped his magic to full strength and the other’s magic weakened a little but didn’t come of completely. He was going to have to ask for help.
“We are about to begin. If you two could leave, that would be very appreciated.” The goblin said towards Tom and Draco.
After taking a minute for Aidan to get used to the noise, Draco guided Aidan towards the center of the store before allowing Aidan to let his magic guide him.
After Draco helped him find the bathroom and pick his clothes, something distinctly soft and silky-it was probably some of Draco’s clothes but he wasn’t going to complain- he helped Harry find the dining room.
“Well it doesn’t matter now, now does it? I’ve already accepted the offer.” The smirk continued to grow on Narcissa’s face as well as the amusement on Lucius and Tom’s faces.
The twins yell as they take in the new changes to Harry. Instead of looking like James Potter with Lily’s eyes, he looked like a young Tom Riddle with Avada Kedavra green eyes that pulsed with magic.
Shaking his head, Fred walked to the door and looked to see who it was. Recognizing his eldest brothers, he cautiously opened the door.
“Father! Calm down. You forgot it shows that nothing except the Metamorphmagus Block is at one hundred percent. Hopefully, we’ll be able to take off the blocks without me being damaged.” Harry said trying to calm his father down.
“Wait until his magic settles. Right now, his magic is volatile after being blocked for so long; it will attack any new magical source that comes into contact with it.” The goblin explained as he took a Pepper-Up potion from nowhere and downed it.
AN: Hey all my readers!!! I know that you all have been waiting and begging for the next chapter, so here it is!!! This is my birthday present to all of you since today is my birthday!! I can’t believe it’s already been two years since I started this fanfic. I hope that I will be able to finish this fanfic. I hope everyone is enjoying their summer. I don’t know how long it’ll take me to write the next chapter but hopefully it won’t be terribly long.
“I see you have finally come to claim your inheritance Heir Longbottom.” Bloodhook said from behind his desk with a small disapproving look on his face.
He was furious. How dare they steal from him! He went back to his room and quickly wrote a note to Gringotts to say that he could make it.
“Yeah, Aidan. The Wackspurts told me that there would be major revelations this year.” Luna said not exactly looking at any of those she was talking to.
Lucius was impressed. Not only at the insults spewed by Aidan towards Dumbledore, but also at the amount of magic that could be seen swirling around him. Lucius felt more confident in leaving his only son in Aidan’s hands. Lucius was not a fool. Sometimes oblivious about his son but not a fool. He realized that his son was submissive, and needed someone to take care of him. Hopefully Aidan would be that person.
