He looks over to James and Matthew, who are standing with hands clasped, both looking as if they might very well vomit. He embraces both of them briefly.
Harry slowly takes inventory of his body. Nothing hurts, nothing seems off besides being tired and the residual feelings from all that vomiting.
“Fetal scan appears normal.”
“Sure.”
“I see. Are you sexually active?”
“Could it damage the magical core?” Harry’s words are almost biting as he forces the words out.
“Sure, Claire, I don’t mind. But you’re much more experienced than I am, so I’m not sure how much help I will be.” Harry places a light stasis over his imaging and steps over to Claire’s station.
“It’s not dangerous in and of itself, but if there’s no connection, the baby has to be removed by using a cutting charm through skin and muscle, then moving organs to access and remove the womb and the child. It's a much higher risk to both the carrying father and the baby. In the case of canal agenesis, we begin a regime of potions to help the body prepare for the trauma at the 20-week mark.”
Draco smiles ruefully. “Very much so. I’m sorry.”
slip?” Hermione inquires.
They find everyone else ready to go in the living room.
“Even if I do, I don’t think I can go back.”
Harry can hear the smile in Draco’s voice, even if his head is still lying on Draco’s shoulder.
“Let me take you to lunch to thank you,” she says eagerly.
“I never imagined that asking you for tea would lead to all this.”
“Yes. Hermione’s with them. She’ll bring Al and Scorp and I’ll bring the older two.”
“Thank you, Potter. Thank you.”
“Shush, you prat.” Harry elbows Draco gently. “So you’re ok with moving in?”
“If I am still this miserable later today, we can see what Healer Carr thinks. I don’t want to push Regulus before he’s ready, but I’m just
James turns back and comes over to the bedside.
Harry loves watching Draco’s absolute joy at seeing that image in the bubble almost as much as he loves seeing the baby himself.
James and Matthew pile on the foot of the bed, looking expectantly at Harry and Draco.
“Excellent. Fluxweed.”
Harry joins the laughter. “Ok, ok. What do you prefer?”
He looks up to see Draco’s concerned face looking at him from his workbench.
“With lunch?” he requests hopefully.
“Are you okay with the way you feel?”
Harry extends one hand behind Draco’s back and concentrates, focusing his magic until what he’s waiting for lands in his hand. Draco feels the gentle movement and leans back to peer at Harry.
“How many partners do you currently have?”
Draco’s expression changes to one of slight amusement. “Pretty sure, Harry. Just…stay away from her. She’s a terrible idea.”
“What about the Chosen One’s adoring public?”
“Mmm…” The noise Draco makes is somewhere between a moan and a sigh. “Your mouth.”
Harry kisses Draco softly. “It’ll be ok, Draco. It might be awkward and a little fumbling and not perfect this time, but we’ll keep practising.” Harry winks and squeezes Draco’s hands. “Better now?” Harry waits for Draco’s nod and then lets go of Draco’s hands, and stretches back out on the blanket.
Harry feels Draco’s hand on the small of his back and he leans slightly into the touch.
“We can tell them at the Christmas holiday?” Harry lifts it into a question, just in case Draco has other plans. “They’ll be home the second week of December.”
“That’s quite all right,” Draco assures her. “What we found was an excellent fit for our space. We find ourselves needing furniture for this one’s bedroom today.”
fingers inside me. I want
“Are you both okay with this?” Hermione asks carefully. Harry can tell she’s still reeling from the news and is trying to gauge their reactions. He can’t blame her; he’s still not completely accustomed to the idea himself. He closes his eyes and sighs softly when Draco’s lips meet his temple with a gentle kiss.
“Matthew? It’s Harry. Are you safe?”
“It was good, dad.” Albus meets his father’s eyes and they both grin. “Things are really good.”
His vision goes black at the edges and the middle bursts with white stars. This contraction is more torturous than the rest. Harry arches his back and pushes. He pushes for Draco, the man who has loved him so fully; for Regulus, the product of that love; and for himself, to meet this child who is the blend of himself and his husband.
“You boys think all of this has been good?”
“Yes,” Draco answers confidently. “I’ll brew wand-sanitiser and a high-quality lube for you this weekend. And your dad and I will make sure you have condoms before you go back. You’ll have to let us know what else you need.”
“We don’t have to label it if we don’t want to. I think we’re both on the same page.”
“Your…
Harry’s only answer is to heave once more and then finds himself unable to stop.
“Time is it?” Harry mutters.
Draco laughs as he places the empty plates back in the basket. Stretching out next to Harry, he lays on his side, head propped on one arm. The angles of Draco’s face look softer under the lights, and his alabaster skin is almost glowing. He looks absolutely gorgeous.
Harry rolls over and pushes himself to a sitting position next to Draco. He takes Draco’s hand and laces their fingers together, giving him a soft kiss.
“Of course, Aunt Hermione.” James climbs the stairs to Harry’s side and offers his arm, which Harry gladly takes.
“I understand. I’ll do my best.”
Harry raises a hand and the bedroom door swings open. Healer Carr steps in a moment later.
“I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else. Even if my parents tell me I can go back there, I don’t want to. I’d rather be somewhere I can be comfortable being myself.”
“Is anal penetration safe during a male pregnancy?”
“Can I see?” Lily scrambles over to her father.
After hugging both men, Hermione settles on the couch and looks at them both expectantly. Draco balances on the arm of Harry’s recliner, lacing their fingers together.
“If there’s something worth worrying about, I will make sure you know. But I’m still probably going to be ill for a while. It’s normal, and it’s not dangerous. And you’ll be home for the last couple of months before the baby comes, so you’ll be able to see for yourself.”
Harry neatly folds the dishtowel, places it on the counter, and follows the swell of the music into the living room. The fire is crackling, and Harry notices that Draco’s pushed the couch back and moved the coffee table aside. Draco turns from setting down a bottle of wine and steps towards Harry as he comes in.
“Dinner in bed?” he asks Draco.
“Yes, the building is kind of like the Leaky. One side faces a Muggle area and the other faces a Wizarding neighbourhood.” Draco gestures to either side as he explains. “If we need something delivered from a Muggle establishment, we have a faux apartment there. The Muggle-side’s doorman is a Squib, so he puts the package in the faux apartment and our doorman comes in from the other side to retrieve it.”
get comfortable. He eyeballs his husband of ten days, sleeping soundly next to him.
“You look pregnant because you
“Oh!” Harry chuckles. “I forgot, you’re not used to this. Polyjuice, Draco. Hermione makes sure I have some for situations that can’t easily be avoided but where being me — or being with me, I guess — isn’t feasible.”
“Mr Potter, is it all right if I show James how to feel where the baby is from the outside based on our imaging? I think he’d find it interesting.”
Raising one hand, Harry wards the Floo. He looks at Draco and smirks.
“Magic reacting with more or less power than you intend?”
“Absolutely,” Draco chuckles. “I could use a glass or two.”
“It was kind of embarrassing at first, but now it’s nice to be able to talk about it and not have to guess what he’s thinking.”
“When do you need to see me again?”
Draco jumps at Harry’s shout, looking alarmed. “Hate…what exactly?”
“Provided this potion keeps working, I’ll be fine. Hermione has seen me much worse than this.”
Matthew pulls his hand from Harry’s belly and wraps James in his arms. Harry can’t hear the young man’s words, but he can hear James’ whispered reply.
“I feel the same way.” Harry kisses down Draco’s neck, running his hands down Draco’s water-slickened chest. The soft moan from Draco goes straight to Harry’s groin. Yes, he’s exhausted, but he’s also not dead. He feels his cock begin to swell as he attaches his mouth to the spot where the graceful slope of Draco’s neck meets his shoulder. Draco clearly notices as well and Harry feels Draco reach towards the soap, then a hand wrapping around his cock.
“Merlin, yes,” Draco breathes. “I’ve never used toys on someone else.” Draco’s eyes go a bit unfocused and Harry wonders if Draco’s mind is where his has gone. All he can think about is Draco stretching him wide and sliding a dildo in his arse.
Draco descends the stairs and wraps Harry in his arms. “We’re getting married, Harry. I still don’t know how I got to be so lucky. I’m so in love with you, I can’t even find words to describe it. We have five incredible kids. You’re carrying my son. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
the baby move in a little bit. Healer Carr comes in about twenty minutes.”
“Are you in labour, dad?” Lily is positively bouncing with excitement.
Harry sips at his cocoa and then pushes it aside. Cookies and cocoa just don’t sound appealing at the moment, so he wraps his hands around the warm mug and studies his children instead.
pregnant,” Draco sighs, rolling his eyes. “I feel like we’ve been over this before.”
Draco’s hand snaps up and catches the Snitch before it can flutter away.
“You’re plenty intelligent, Harry. Just because you weren’t a total swot in school doesn’t mean you aren’t smart and capable.”
“I’m ready, Draco.
“Four! Three!”
bedroom?”
“If he doesn’t go back to his parents’ home, we would need to get some sort of legal guardianship of Matthew,” Draco explains “That way if there is an emergency or you need medical attention, or there’s any other issue, we can be contacted and spoken to as if we were your parents. We’re going to contact our solicitor about how it would work.”
Both boys move to fill a plate.
“I have no problem with that,” Healer Carr winks at them. “I have nine children of my own.” She lifts her bag. “I’ll see you next Thursday, gentlemen. I can see myself out.”
“That I can understand.” Hermione delivers a Draco-worthy smirk. “You never were one to let the chance for action go by.”
“Because we’re grown men!” Draco finally regains enough of his composure to form words.
“Hello, Her—”
“Yeah. It just feels like something hard is sitting in there right now. It’s right—“ Harry takes Draco’s hand and places it over the spot. “—there.”
“Mostly. And I think he’ll be fine. It’s just a lot for him to wrap his brain around. Unfortunately, he’s also got Albus in his ear whispering about how everything is going to turn out as a worst-case scenario.”
“I do.” Draco insists. “We specifically need witches and wizards skilled in Defence Against the Dark Arts to pick apart the web of magic found in these maladies and explore counter-curses.”
“Hmm…” Draco sounds a bit nervous.
Harry steels himself just a bit and decides that there’s not going to be a better moment than this.
“If you find the person you’re meant to be with, why wait?” Harry leans against Draco’s chest and wraps his arms around his husband. ”I love you, Draco. I wouldn’t change a thing about how quickly we moved.”
Draco tightens the arm he has around Harry. “Partner,” he says softly. “I’d like to call you my partner.” Warmth spreads through Harry’s chest. Not only does Draco feel the same way he does about the seriousness of their relationship; he has also chosen a label that carries a lot more weight than “someone I’m dating”, or maybe even “boyfriend.”
“I’ve only been fingered by someone else. I enjoyed it. I finger myself and use toys. I find it very enjoyable. I’d love to have you do either to me.”
“My wardrobe,” Harry sighs.
“Draco. No one deserves to pay for the shite we went through as teenagers. And you certainly never deserved to pay for your father’s transgressions.” Harry’s voice softens and he squeezes Draco’s hand. “And maybe this will be the start of my
“I feel the same way. And that’s exactly why I did it.” Harry takes a sip of wine.
“You fell asleep during the movie. It’s nearly midnight.”
Draco’s face relaxes slightly as Harry shuts off the water and reaches out to grab their towels.
“Let’s get you back in the supports before the next wave, Harry. It’s time to meet your son.”
“I’ll undress if you want to go meet Healer Carr?”
Harry takes in his surroundings. There are two people in Mediwizard robes and a man in Healer’s robes. He’s clearly in St Mungo’s
He smiles as the sound of four pairs of feet clamour up the stairs. Turning to Draco, he leans into his chest and sighs happily.
“All right, we need to head out,” Draco says softly.
Draco’s grin tugs at Harry’s heart. He couldn’t put proper words to it if he tried, but the feeling of having a baby with someone he loves as much as he loves Draco — and knowing how very thrilled that man is to be having a baby with him — does something to his emotions.
“The preferred way for men to give birth is naturally. Your body should be forming an additional path from your womb to your rectum. If it’s forming properly, you’ll be able to birth much like a female pregnancy but through the anus.”
Two fingers become three, slow pace becomes more frantic, and Harry is moaning Draco’s name.
“I’ll send for those. Has it always been a little wild, as well?”
“C'mere, Scorp.” Harry opens his arms and Scorpius obligingly fills them as Harry murmurs in his ear. “I love you, son. I would love you if you stayed a Malfoy, but I can’t tell you how special it will be to have you as a Potter.”
“Okay, Harry and I will take you to Wood and Wand first, then.” Draco nods. “Anyone else?”
“Nothing but my joggers fit. I can’t button anything. I tried these on—“ he holds up a pair of denims “—last weekend to make sure I had something for tonight, and now they don’t close.”
Panic is beginning to set in. He tries to take inventory of his body. Nothing really hurts. There’s something cold and hard on his abdomen. Something is keeping his left hand warm. He feels…floaty. He can feel everything outside his body but not his body itself.
“I know it’s always bad when you’re out, but this is going to be ridiculous, isn’t it?”
cock to fill me. Because this isn’t wanting sex for me, it’s wanting
“I know.” Harry leans his head back to kiss Draco’s jaw. “But if we’re going to go out today, I think we’re going to have to let the proverbial cat out of the bag.”
“That’s where the baby is.”
She doesn’t seem put off by the notion, thankfully. Harry truly hopes his children will all be ok with Draco and Harry moving at the pace the two of them choose. That aside, Harry knows four kids between them has been, and will continue to be, a consideration in their relationship.
all right?”
Harry rolls his eyes. He hates that he has to hide their happiness and their relationship because a bunch of nosy reporters can’t mind their own business. He knows that when they do come out publicly, it’s going to be front-page news.
Once back home, they deposit their shrunken and lightened packages outside the bedroom. Draco starts levitating belongings out of the current wardrobe and dresser and into a couple of trunks while Harry retrieves the antidote to the Polyjuice.
“Hi, Harry,” she says into his chest.
“What’ll you have, Potter?” Draco gestures Harry forward as they step to the register.
“I’m not?”
They turn and head for the door. “Next time, we should go for a fly. Maybe play a Seekers’ game?” Draco smirks at Harry with a challenge in his eyes.
Pushing the thoughts of Draco aside for now, Harry climbs the front steps of Potter Cottage, waves his hand to unlock the wards, and pushes through the front door. Stepping just over the threshold, he sighs softly. The house seems so empty already, without the kids.
“I love you, too.”
“Low back again, but it’s starting to wrap around my belly.” Harry looks to James. “Would you Floo Healer Carr and tell her it’s not an extreme emergency, but I think I need to be checked over?”
“Do you really think I’d be able to help with the project at CRMM? Do you think they’d hire me?”
“Sure.” James smiles and heads for the door.
“Why don’t you Floo-call and see? Maybe we can get that squared away today and then pay Minerva a visit later this week to make sure it’s all on file at Hogwarts. And we can check on Matthew at the same time.”
There’s a soft knock at the bedroom door, and Draco moves to open it.
“Yes. That’s one of the unseen places we’ve only learned to scan and detect damage in recently. Really only in the last 4-5 years.” Draco is clearly forcing his voice to remain steady but Harry still can’t look at him.
“Not in the least,” Harry shakes his head vehemently. “James is gay, you know. Got his first boyfriend over the summer, actually. And I’m not entirely straight myself, so it would be rather hypocritical of me to have an issue with it, wouldn’t you say?” Harry gives his own almost-shrug.
“You are very clearly a carrier, Mr Potter, seeing as how you’re currently pregnant.”
“Thanks, Scorp. We’ll be right up. Go finish putting your things away.” Harry shakes his head as footsteps ascend the stairs.
Harry finally blinks his eyes open and gropes for his glasses. Sliding them on, he finds Draco sitting against the headboard, wire-rimmed reading glasses on, and a book in his lap. Harry loves Draco in those glasses. They somehow just make him look that much more handsome.
“I’ll order you a new patio chair that can do both, love.” Draco squeezes his hand.
A few cleaning charms later, they’re under the sheets with Draco’s chest flush against Harry’s back, both drifting into a sated, satisfied sleep.
“Well, it’s not as if Draco hasn’t seen you in your everyday clothes.” Hermione gestures to one pile on the bed, and then to another. “And he helped you pick out your work clothes. He knows what you look like and he asked you for a date with that knowledge.”
“What’s ‘this’?”
“Do you need to talk, or do you need some time?” he asks Matthew.
“I’m sorry, Dad, did I wake you? I just brought Draco some tea.”
“Carbs.” Harry pauses. “And cheese.”
Harry has just returned to the bedroom from putting the books away in the study when Draco’s throwing open the window to let Woody in. The owl pecks at Draco’s fingers as he tries to untie the parchment from his leg.
“Oh, hush!” Harry laughs at his own awkwardness. “I’m saying I want to have that with you. I want to know what you like and dislike and what you want. I…I haven’t been with anyone since Ginny, and I’m not sure it’s like riding a broom.”
“Are you all right?”
Harry sees Draco’s eyes flick down his body for the briefest of seconds as he returns the smile. “Let me just grab my jacket.”
“Mmm,” is the only answer Harry can manage, now painfully hard beneath his pants. Draco eases the shirt off his shoulders, placing kisses over his shoulder and down his back as the fabric is pulled away.
“Harry. We’re having a son. You’re carrying our son. I would love you forever even if you’d never gotten pregnant, but I can’t even put into words what this little boy means to me. He’s
“You’d better believe his feet are in my ribs,” Harry laughs. Healer Carr chuckles.
“I didn’t know you’d written your mother.” Harry really isn’t sure how to feel about this piece of information. Draco is completely entitled to write to his mother if he chooses, but as far as Harry knows, they haven’t been in contact.
The instant the door is shut, he’s caught up in Draco’s arms and they hold each other close. Pregnant. He’s pregnant. There’s a baby that’s half him and half Draco, and it’s inside him. The mix of surprise and hope and something else he can’t pinpoint has his eyes welling with tears.
“Sounds good.”
did all their schooling?”
“Oh, Al…” Harry is almost impressed at his son’s ability to find a potential crisis anywhere. “No. No, I’m not. We did have a bit of a scare a couple of weeks ago, that’s why I was in St Mungo’s. But we pinpointed the issue and it’s been taken care of. Everything has looked great since then. I’m not going to haemorrhage like your mum. I’m afraid you’re stuck with me until I’m old and grey.”
Harry fights the intense desire to bear down and sucks in deep lung fulls of oxygen as he feels the Healer’s hands working at his opening.
Harry takes a deep breath and nods. He’s finding it hard to remain calm and accept the testing and prodding with no time to mentally prepare himself, especially this one since it’s invasive in a very personal manner. Healer Carr moves to her conjured table and begins pulling more equipment from her bag.
“Yes…”
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Draco’s voice sounds equally uncertain on the other end and maybe a little hurt. “If I’ve done something to upset you, I truly am sorry.”
“It can only mean one thing.” Draco tugs on his trousers and looks at Harry. His face is some strange combination of sad, resigned, and angry. It’s a strange look on him, and Harry doesn’t know how to help. “The gossip has reached France and she knows about us — and possibly Regulus. I’m sure she’s going to tell me what a disappointment I am. Again.”
“Harry?”
“Good.” Harry is extremely relieved. He knows James and Matthew are the first serious relationship for each other, but it’s a good habit to develop. “None of those prevent pregnancy, though.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. There are retorts on the tip of his tongue, but he can’t bring himself to pick the fight. “I want to argue with you so badly, but I know you’re right.”
“I am, too,” Scorpius agrees, “as long as I have a place here. It’ll be good to spend the break with Al.”
Draco’s hand caresses his hip and then pauses.
Matthew nods. “James has told me.”
“Don’t suppose,” he pants, “there's time to decide I don’t want to do this?” He’s crying openly into Draco’s shoulder and can’t even bring himself to care.
Twenty minutes later — garlic finished, tomatoes diced, and basil chopped — Harry feels the wards shift just as he’s about to light the hob for the sauce. Wiping his hands on a towel, he heads for the front door.
Minerva offers her palm again, this time with Draco’s wedding band laid in it.
Harry waits, hidden on the stairs, heart full. Maybe, just maybe, his
“How do we make sure it doesn’t hurt?”
“You’ve got a bright son,” Healer Carr smiles at Harry.
“I would be quite pleased if it was Matthew. He’s a wonderful young man. But I’d still rather not be a grandfather before you graduate.”
“The situation certainly seems to warrant it.” Her trained eye looks Harry over. “Can you tell me what happened?”
“This is typical in male pregnancy. He only has nine more weeks; the baby is growing and running out of space. If he makes it to thirty-three weeks, which is the equivalent to thirty-five in a witch’s pregnancy, we won’t stop labour if it starts. But your little boy really needs these next four weeks for lung development and growth, so I’d rather take precautions.”
Draco smirks and reaches for the hem of Harry’s shirt. “May I?”
“Neither did we,” Draco smirks. “It was a bit of a surprise.”
And then Harry can feel it. There, thrumming along his own magic, is Draco’s. It’s like an echo, just a soft reminder that he is bound to the one his soul loves.
“You know, a year ago, if someone had described our life to me, I would have thought they’d completely lost the plot,” Harry says as he scoots towards Draco. A happy moan escapes his lips as Draco moulds his body to Harry’s back and holds him close. Outside their bedroom, he hears the noise of all five kids moving around the house. It’s never quiet when they are home, but it makes the house seem alive to have them all there. The two days since they returned from Hogwarts have been wonderfully chaotic.
time.”
, too.” She buries her face in his chest for a moment and then pulls back, taking both of Harry’s hands.
Draco nods and kisses him again. “I love you, Harry.”
“I usually only use a wand at work, but no.”
Draco shrugs. “It was fine. Crowded. Got some strange looks having Hermione with me instead of you. We’ll see if the Prophet chooses to speculate wildly,”
Draco turns to Harry and carefully helps him to kneel on the soft fabric surrounding the base of the stone before lowering himself next to him. Right hand clasps left and left hand clasps right, all laid atop the smooth surface.
Draco pushes himself up to sit and finds his shoes, passing Harry his, as well. Picnic blanket and basket surreptitiously shrunken and tucked into Draco’s jacket pocket, he takes Harry’s hand and they set off walking through the park. The night air is just chilly enough that Harry casts a wandless, wordless warming charm over them both.
Harry pauses. He doesn’t like acknowledging the fact that his eldest son will probably be having sex at sixteen. He’s also not delusional enough to think a teenage boy with a steady boyfriend will put off having sex until graduation or engagement or marriage.
“Except Matthew! Can he be a Potter?” Lily supplies. Harry looks at Matthew. Matthew would be welcome to change his name as well, but he’s not sure that’s what the young man will want to do. To Harry’s surprise, James speaks, not Matthew.
“I was, too, until Hermione called on the Floo to distract me. She knew I would be worked up.” They head down the front steps, and just outside the wards, Harry turns to Draco, who offers his arm.
“Albus has always been my worrier. He’s so much like me, emotionally.” Harry lifts a spoon to his mouth and tastes the sauce, then reaches for the spices. “His letter to me the night of the Welcoming Feast had a bunch of questions about how I was doing and what I was to do now. I replied and tried to reassure him, but until I have something more concrete to tell him than ‘I’m fine and I’ll figure it out,’ he’s probably just going to keep on worrying.” Harry lifts another spoon and tastes the sauce, wrinkling his nose a bit. Grabbing a fresh spoon, he dips some sauce and holds the spoon out to Draco. “Taste this. Do you think it needs more salt?”
“These are the books I’ve got so far.” He surveys them again. “We could look for some more.”
James and Harry reach out and touch the length of rope, Draco touches the activation point, and they are all deposited in the living room of Potter Cottage.
Draco’s fingers caress his cheek.
Harry is angry all over again at Matthew’s parents. He seems so conditioned to feel like he has to earn love, like he’s a burden that must be borne, instead of a child — a person — worthy of love. Harry, more than anyone, understands feeling unloved and unvalued as a child over something he had no control over. He doesn’t want that for Matthew.
Harry drops his head again and kisses softly along Draco’s hip bone, slowly moving towards the centre. He buries his nose in Draco’s curls, inhaling the musky scent of Draco’s arousal before lifting up to look at Draco again.
“You look exhausted, Harry.”
“Everything okay?”
“I haven’t. Not in several years.” Draco sighs heavily and climbs out of bed.
“Is this a problem?” she pries gently.
“No. He and Scorpius sat with the Slytherins.”
for a long time.
“I’d love to see them.” Hermione catches Harry’s eye and the look on her face speaks volumes. She’s so happy for them, and it’s genuine and whole-hearted, but she also lost her partner — albeit in a different way — and hasn’t found what Harry and Draco have. Harry can see the moment she stuffs those emotions inside. “Have you told the kids yet?”
Harry snorts. “I’m not exactly known for being patient when I know what I want.”
“I’m not sure, exactly. Your magic is not within normal range, but I gather from Mr Malfoy that it never has been?”
“I hear you’re to have an eventful break.” Blaise casts a knowing look between Harry and Draco.
By the time they’ve enjoyed lunch, the outside of the restaurant is swarming with gawkers, reporters, and photographers. Draco wraps his arm around Harry’s waist as they pause just inside the door.
“I can Floo for a reservation. They always seem to have a table for me.” Harry rolls his eyes. “Then we can write Minerva before we go.”
“It is.” The Healer’s eyebrows rise into her hairline, clearly impressed. “You really have been reading. So, let’s have a look at your little brother.” She conjures the imaging bubble and touches her wand to Harry’s skin. Regulus appears on the screen and Harry squeezes Draco’s hand. Something about seeing their son, moving and wriggling inside him, makes him emotional every time.
Harry laughs to himself.
He hands the letter to Draco and sees the moment Draco reads the line suggesting that Harry ought to be dating again.
When a hand lands lightly on his shoulder again, Harry shifts back from the Magiscope and finds himself in very close quarters with Claire.
Hands fisted in the sheets, Harry eagerly pushes back to meet each deep thrust. “Faster!
“Just like that. That’s…nngh.” Harry trails off, seeing stars as Draco brushes his prostate with every stroke. He can already feel his balls tightening and his release building in his belly.
“Will you turn over? I want to see your face.”
“Thank you, Healer Carr.” Harry nods to her.
“Do you remember the first time you visited? When we walked down to the pitch?”
“Is that the transducer potion?”
“Hasn’t it?”
“It certainly wasn’t planned, and we were both rather shocked. But I’m finding it impossible to be anything but excited about having a baby with Harry.”
“Other than your weight and iron, everything else looks good, medically speaking.” She rummages in her bag and withdraws a syringe. “Let’s get the bloodwork going so it can brew while we check on the baby.”
“We are,” Draco whispers back and covers Harry’s lips with his own as their children call out in approval.
“That’s never easy. I mean,
“And who talked about his coming out first?” Harry prods gently.
Harry clears his throat and Draco looks up. Warmth spreads in Harry’s chest at the grin forming on Draco’s face. Draco immediately stands and looks at Harry earnestly.
is what you took away from this?!” Draco rolls his eyes. “Yes, those trousers make your arse look fantastic, all right?”
“Do you know how lucky your kids are to have you as their father?” Draco kisses Harry’s cheek. “As for what we’ll tell James, let me go fetch some parchment and a quill and we’ll figure it out.”
“Worse.” Harry laughs as his son turns a bit green at that declaration. “But worth it. Having a baby with a partner you love is worth an awful lot of pain and sacrifice.”
“You look wonderful, as well.”
“Hmm,” Hermione’s brow is furrowed and one hand is twirling the ends of her curls idly. “Has he ever dated anyone seriously?”
“Do you text a lot?” Draco eyes Harry’s mobile with interest.
“I don’t want to feel this way either.”
“Honestly, I wasn’t really sure.” the young blond shrugs.
Lily settles in the chair beside Draco, and Regulus is placed in her arms.
“You know, I really didn’t think I’d ever have a chance at this,” Draco says softly.
“That’s a good start.” Draco shakes his head. “All right, let’s go downstairs and see what needs done before Saturday.”
Home has never felt so wonderful.
Harry’s stomach flutters a bit and he bites his bottom lip. He hasn’t realised how much he wanted to see Draco again until now, with the opportunity laid out before him. Would it be too forward to ask Draco to join him for the dinner he’s already started? Before he can talk himself out of it, Harry strides to the study to reply.
Harry steps out of the Floo and sinks onto his couch. After his very enjoyable lunch with Draco, he’d been so distracted that his afternoon went both slowly and horribly. He’d had to restart the imaging analysis on his Magiscope several times, and he’d snapped at Claire when she just wouldn’t quit talking to him. He ended up staying late to try and get something done. Now it’s gone eight o’clock at night and he’s just getting home. His mind was completely preoccupied with analysing what had happened with Draco over lunch, from telling Harry to stay away from Claire, to the casual touches that always drove him wild — not to mention that intense look in Draco’s eyes that makes Harry feel like he’s being undressed right there.
“All right.” Draco nods. “Off we go.”
Harry doesn’t recognise the voices he’s hearing.
“We should probably let the kids know we’re letting it slip tonight, too. It’ll hit the Prophet in the morning, and nobody needs that as an unexpected Sunday treat.”
“Good morning, sleepyhead,” Draco says affectionately.
“Good afternoon, gentlemen. I’m Erwin. Is there something I can help you with today?”
“I like that one.” He points and Erwin immediately pulls the ring from the case. It’s white gold with a thick textured band and a diagonal swirl of five diamonds across the top. “Maybe not all diamonds, though.”
Footsteps on the stairs announce Hermione’s return.
“Hello, Draco.”
“Well, we certainly hope so.” Draco fails to keep the mirth from his tone.
“If our seventeen-year-old selves could see us now.” Draco drawls with a hint of a smile.
“Because I had Lily on my lap having a relatively identical conversation while you were having that one. She, James, and Matthew apparently discussed it while we were all out today.”
“Still better. I hate the bedrest, but it’s helped. James, will you call for Draco, please? He’s in the study.” James shifts to go find Draco but pauses when the man in question comes through the door.
“No. Nothing’s wrong.” He smiles in an effort to ease Draco’s mind. “I’m just nervous.”
“See if she’s available, then. But we’re ordering in so you can still take it easy.”
The meeting with the solicitor was easy enough, and the office was sending someone over to Matthew’s parents today to see if they’d sign the appropriate paperwork. They could do a contested guardianship, but it would take much longer. Mr Stargell had been hopeful they would sign, and he could send the paperwork over by the end of the day.
“We’ll have some contractors out to take a look once everything’s public with this one.” Harry rubs his stomach lightly.
“Thanks, Dad.”
“My trunk is shrunk and lightened and inside James’ trunk. He’ll be along in a minute.” Lily’s eyes sparkle with a look that Harry knows means she has a secret. “I think he and Matthew are saying goodbye in the compartment so it doesn’t get photographed.”
“What’s on your mind, James?” Draco dives in.
pregnant yet, but I can already see a little.”
“Harry!” Hermione sounds torn between the anticipated scolding and hysterical laughter. “What on earth?”
Draco’s genuine concern warms Harry’s heart. There may be a lot of bad things about today, but Draco here beside him, supportive and caring, is
“How did that go?” The drumming is back. Harry can’t help but smile. His best friend’s relentless pursuit of knowledge extends to his love life too, evidently.
Harry picks up his phone.
“Why don’t you pack a trunk?”
Draco is less muscled than Harry but incredibly fit. The white-blonde hair on his legs matches the hair on his head, so light it’s almost translucent. Harry takes in the bulge in Draco’s pants, feeling his own cock swell more at the sight.
“It was great. We’re having a son.”
“Are you in a relationship?”
“Scorpius always wanted a sibling growing up. I’m hoping he will be excited once he wraps his head around it.” Draco pauses thoughtfully. “I think Lily will be quite excited.”
“I know, love.” Draco drops a kiss to his temple. “I wish there were something more I could do.”
The hand slips from his hair under his chin and Harry finds his face being tipped up for a kiss. Slow and soft, Draco covers Harry’s mouth with his own. Harry feels Draco’s tongue gently run along his lips and he grants him entry. The heat pooling in Harry’s belly moves lower, and he’s straining against the fabric of his jeans.
“Part of me can’t believe we’re sitting here doing this — the rest of me feels like we should have been doing this all along.” Draco shakes his head just a little.
“Me, too.”
Harry traces a random pattern on Draco’s chest and tries to get his hammering nerves under control.
“That sounds brilliant. I think I’ll take a shower and try to unwind.” Harry eyes Draco, unsure how this next bit of information is going to go over. “You can Apparate straight in if you don’t want to find a Floo. I added you to the family wards.”
Harry smiles to himself. He’s nervous, too, even though he knows he wants this. He’s rapidly falling in love with Draco and as much as that scares him, it also thrills him, and he’s ready for this next step.
“Come on, all five of you. I’ll help.”
“He really is an arse.” Harry holds the bedroom door open so Woody can go join Edgar downstairs.
Harry guides Draco’s hand over his womb and lays his hand on top.
He is exhausted and sore. His belly, swollen and squashy, no longer holds their son. He delivered the afterbirth and the Healing team spent a good amount of time with spells and salves to put his ravaged body back together, but it is still far from how it once was. Draco had helped him into the shower, where he wept, partially out of relief, partially out of pain, and partially out of just being overwhelmed.
“I love you, too,” Harry replies without looking away from Regulus. He’s both of them, and it’s amazing. Strawberry blond wisps of hair look like they may end up being Harry’s curls and he has Harry's mouth, but he has Draco’s nose and chin. And only time will tell what colour his eyes will be.
“I suppose this means I don’t get to go with you to pick up the children,” Harry sighs.
“He stays,” Draco sighs. “I can see if Mr Stargell has time this afternoon. We need to get some kind of guardianship document.”
Harry hopes fervently Draco understands that he doesn’t
. You’ve been engaged since New Years!”
“Well, my family doesn’t do birthstones; we usually have a stone chosen for us that corresponds with the stars we are named after,” Draco explains.
“Some time, if that’s okay?” The young man sounds absolutely broken.
“Oh, Harry!” Draco gasps and Harry wrenches his gaze from the baby to look at Draco, who’s not even trying to hide the tears in his eyes.
“I’ve missed you, too, Dad.” Al pulls back and studies his father carefully. “You look happy.”
“Pretty good. I’m actually not nauseous. Still tired. And I’m awfully anxious to know the baby is all right.”
Harry can’t hide his grin as warmth spreads through his belly. It’s so nice to be out and about with Draco, proudly in a relationship with him, even if it’s not really their bodies. He can’t wait for all four kids to arrive home from Hogwarts so they can stop hiding away.
“What?!? What does that face mean??” he blurts.
“I will have you lift one knee to your chest and I will cast a relaxing charm and slide two lubricated fingers into your rectum. I’ll press lightly on the outside just above where the womb is sitting. That will allow me to feel a bump or bulge if the connection is being properly formed.”
he whispers, releasing the dildo and pillowing his head on his arms. A guttural moan is wrenched from his core as the head breaches his entrance.
“Of course. One tiny silver lining of being in the hospital.” The Healer’s wand appears to siphon the image from the bubble and drops it onto photograph parchment. These, unlike others they’ve gotten, show the baby moving.
“Thank you. We’re quite excited.” Draco squeezes Harry’s hand.
“Absolutely.”
“And we are about to have a sex discussion with them.”
Harry returns to rest against Draco’s chest. He’s pretty sure he’s in whatever this is for the long haul, and he’s pretty sure Draco is, too. But what do two grown men, both single fathers, call something like this?
“Good. Knee up for me, please.”
doing part of this parenting thing right.
” sets the dildo in motion, withdrawing until the head stretches at his rim before it unhurriedly sinks back in. Harry gasps as the head brushes his prostate, momentarily seeing stars behind his closed eyelids.
“Harry? Is that not ok?”
Malfoy nods tersely. “It
“Everything okay at the platform?”
“What do your notes say, then?” Draco peers over and Harry shows him the parchment.
“I need to pop over to the flat for some work clothes for tomorrow,” Draco says casually as he runs some dishwater in the sink. Harry notices how it’s become “the flat.” He smiles and sets the frying pan on the counter, picking up a towel to dry the dishes Draco’s washing.
“My son is having sex.”
“We didn’t waste any time after, though, seeing as we’re married and adding another little duck to our row today.” Draco pauses in his walking, tugging Harry into his arms and kissing his forehead. “It’s been a bit of a whirlwind romance, but it’s been perfect for us.”
“That sounds great. Would you hand me my mobile first, though? I’m going to text Hermione and ask if she can up the ante on her book and DVD game for the next several weeks. I’m going to lose my mind if she doesn’t.”
“I don’t think it will be long before you can see something. I can feel where the baby is sitting.”
“Okay, we’re ready to do some shopping. Do all of you have your Gringotts cards? And know how much pocket money is on them?”
“What did you do to the Muggles.”
“Go on then,” Harry encourages.
“Good. The issue is that I’m finding that…” Harry pauses and heaves a deep breath, grasping the pillow and twisting it in his hand. “…that I’m finding myself rather attracted to you.”
“Just tell me?” Draco’s voice sounds just the slightest bit pleading.
“All right, let’s do this. It’ll all be out in the open in a couple of hours.” Draco kisses him quickly and they head for the stairs. A firm arm slips around Harry’s waist and he smiles at Draco’s protective behaviour. Any time he can offer support or a little extra safety, he always does.
“Thank you.”
“Exactly.” Harry doesn’t want to cause any of the children any unnecessary distress, but he admittedly does worry about Al more than the other three in that regard. “How do you think they’ll take the news?”
“Well she can fuck right off,” Harry spits waspishly.
Harry can visibly see James gather his courage.
Draco’s arms slide around his middle to hold the place where Regulus is growing. At eighteen weeks in a male pregnancy, there’s no way Harry looks anything but pregnant. His skinny frame has nowhere for a baby to go but out, and he can’t blame weight gain if the only place that’s bigger is his round belly.
Draco pulls Harry closer. The staff at St Mungo’s had let them transfigure the hospital bed to be big enough for both of them. Tonight makes the seventh night they’ve spent in it, but this one is proving to be particularly sleepless.
, it inevitably means he’s about to navigate some treacherous parenting territory. Lily, having only known Harry’s open and honest parenting style, has no shame in asking him the things she wants to know or telling him exactly what she’s thinking.
“Better than a fight, I suppose.” Harry pushes himself into a seated position. “Did you Floo Minerva?”
“So what’s—“
Draco’s lips meet Harry’s and he’s flooded with warmth, both from Draco’s mouth and the contented feeling of starting 2020 with
“Exactly. Sneezewort.”
“That sounds good. James, do you want to help me with some snacks and Al and Scorp can get the telly set up? Matthew can save you a seat.”
“Do you know what colour or kind of wood you're looking for?” Bernice brings them to a stop in front of a section of bedroom furniture.
“Of course; I’ll marry you.”
Swinging the door open, his first glimpse of Draco nearly makes him gasp. He’s dressed in black trousers and a deep plum dress shirt under his stylish jacket, and he looks absolutely gorgeous. Harry shamelessly looks Draco over before smiling up at him. Draco’s returning smile makes him melt, just a little.
“Better?” Draco asks softly. Harry nods and Draco takes his hand. “Will you let me call a Healer to come check you over? You’ve not kept anything down all day and I’m concerned.”
“Mm-hmm…” Harry nods.
“Draco,” Harry murmurs, eyes closed. His stomach is threatening to revolt once again. It’s been an ongoing struggle for the two weeks since finding out he’s pregnant.
“You really
“For you, too,” Harry teases. “No more sex.”
There’s shuffling at the door, and Draco is ushering the other three kids into the room.
Harry can’t decide if he’s exceptionally nauseous Friday because of the baby or because he’s nervous about telling the kids that, after nearly twelve years, they’re getting a sibling. Regardless of the source of his stomach’s unease, Draco is taking his own anxiety out by hovering and inquiring constantly about Harry’s well-being. It’s about to drive him completely spare at this point, so he’s sent Draco to the pantry to hunt the pasta just to give him something to do. He sets aside the ingredients he’s been preparing for dinner.
“I can’t wait,” Harry answers truthfully. He reaches into his robe pocket and withdraws a small box. “Here, James. Don’t lose it.”
By the time New Year’s Eve rolls around, Harry is beginning to wonder how he ever survived raising three kids on his own. He is completely exhausted from constantly being on the go. The Prophet had, of course, put a picture of Draco and Harry in The Dragon’s Eye on the front page the day after their first trip out, and the media drama has been non-stop ever since. Draco has strengthened the wards on the house to keep out owls from anyone they don’t know, because the quantity of Howlers has been completely ridiculous.
“So it was okay when you were gay, but not in a relationship with a man?” Pure-blood ‘rules’ make no sense to Harry, even now.
Draco’s bright smile makes Harry’s pulse flutter. “Your house is under the Fidelius?”
Unable to keep from grinning, Harry pulls on some clothes before making his way to the Floo. Kneeling on the cold stone, he tosses in some powder and calls out “Malfoy Residence, London”. Pushing his head into the flames, he waits for Draco to answer.
Harry grins. “Deal.”
“It’s perfect.”
“I’m so glad to have you home.” He studies them both as they pull away. Albus, to his delight, looks wonderful. He looks as if he’s been sleeping more and his face isn’t pinched or drawn with worry. “Good trip?”
But since that day on the platform, they’ve become fast friends and he’s felt no discomfort speaking openly, even when they disagree. He finds Draco interesting and thoughtful and kind. Not that he’s perfect — his temper is still quick to rise, even though he’s better at controlling it, he rants when he’s frustrated, and he gives a wicked cold shoulder when he’s angry — but Harry’s not perfect either. Harry dares to hope that maybe they—
Wand working delicately, Harry untangles the benevolent magic from the image. It’s not the most complex he’s seen, fortunately. The tangle of malevolent magic, however…
“I shall have to retire before then,” she quips, before breaking into a rare grin. “Congratulations, gentlemen. That is wonderful news. Am I correct in assuming that’s why the children were required at home?”
Harry stretches out his hand and spells on the lights surrounding the pitch as they approach. “I’m sorry people made you feel unwanted. You’re welcome to fly here any time you wish. Scorpius, too.” He turns towards a small building to the side of the pitch. “Come on, I’ll show you the changing room and where we keep the brooms and balls.”
“I would, too. I know you’re ill, but so far, I can’t see any evidence that you’re pregnant. Seeing that tiny baby in the bubble reminds me that it will be worth it in the end.”
“You’ve been sick.” Al seems to think this is a perfectly valid argument for his father dying.
Gathering the letters, Harry heads for his study to pen replies to all three of his children. Lily needs her quills, James needs some relationship advice, and Al needs some reassurance. They may not be at home, but at least he knows his children still need him, even if it’s just in letter form.
“Harry? Is something wrong?”
“Yes. Home in a couple of days.”
“I recommend a longer-acting anti-nausea. I can give you the directions for brewing, Mr Malfoy. A male pregnancy usually entails pretty severe exhaustion, nausea, and magic fatigue from about four to twelve weeks. Your body has a lot more work to do than a female body. Unfortunately, it will probably get worse before it gets better.”
Draco kisses back willingly and Harry can’t get over how, every time he’s kissed Draco this last few weeks, it’s just as amazing as the first time. He feels Draco’s tongue run against his lips and willingly parts them. Harry moans softly and deepens the kiss further. Though they’ve had lunch together daily at work and gone to dinner a couple of nights, there hasn’t been nearly enough time for
“How serious is this?” James sounds intrigued.
He puts his hands over his face and sighs. He’s never kept anything from Hermione and he’s not going to start now. He drops his hands.
Draco’s warm hands are back on his arse and then he’s gently spread apart.
“No. You need to have words with your son; he won’t let me get comfortable. He’s determined to use my organs as pillows and punching bags.”
“Okay. Will you call James just as soon as you’re done? No matter how it goes?” Harry wants to make sure that Matthew’s safety is accounted for, regardless of the outcome.
As if on cue, an owl taps at the bedroom window. Harry lifts himself from the bed and retrieves the scroll, seeing the Hogwarts crest as he unfurls it.
“That helps; you holding me. But something’s different now that he’s shifted. I don’t know what happened. It’s just so much pressure.”
“We have some things to talk about. But nothing is wrong.” Draco’s voice is steadier than Harry’s at least, and Harry is thankful for the arm still wrapped tightly around his waist. “Why don’t you go put your things in your rooms and we’ll finish up dinner. We can talk while we eat.”
“Is it always that intensely awkward?” Draco asks.
“Well, no, he’s not.” Harry decides to take the leap. “Are you?”
The young man takes a deep breath and looks at Harry with grey eyes, so much like Draco’s.
“What happens if I do?”
“Would you want to be the Mediwizard that tells a pregnant Harry Potter he can’t have his fiancé in bed with him?”
“Fuck.”
Standing and crossing to a shelf filled with DVDs, Harry pulls three off the shelf. “Considering you said you haven’t seen many Muggle films, why don’t you pick from these? I’ve seen them all and they’re all quite good, but also very different from one another.”
Harry sputters at his daughter’s frank question.
“Have you seen Al?”
“Was everything consensual between you and Matthew?”
“Would you mind walking? It’s rather nice out, and I’d like to enjoy the sunshine.”
“I know.” Harry’s whole body is flooding with warmth at the thought. He’s absolutely terrified and this was not in their plans, but he’s daring to hope that this baby is part of their
“Oh?” Claire sounds disappointed but then continues hopefully. “Dinner tonight then?”
“No, I want to do the nursery. I just need a minute and I’ll be good.” Harry stretches out on the couch and closes his eyes.
“I love you. More than I thought possible. I'm so glad you’ve chosen me to be your partner.”
“Romantic feelings?” Hermione asks, voice carefully controlled and crisply enunciated.
“Is it dangerous?” This is becoming Draco’s mantra with the Healer. He’s always focused on Harry’s well-being and safety. And, Harry supposes, the well-being and safety of their baby, now.
“Would you like to go out tonight and let ourselves be spotted? I honestly thought we’d be spotted on the platform taking the kids back, and if I’m about to go back to work, I’m certainly not hiding our engagement.”
“Oh my.” Hermione manages to somehow look overjoyed and overwhelmed all at once.
Draco nods appreciatively. “You’d do well with some advanced study in psychology then, or possibly Healer training if you’re thinking of becoming a Mind Healer.”
Harry nods and Draco takes his hand, knowing that he will be uncomfortable. Healer Carr begins casting.
He wakes to Draco’s gentle shaking.
James lays his hand on top of the box and Draco begins a complex series of wand movements and incantations. A tendril of silver magic wraps around James’ hand and the box before sinking into the wood.
“The kids will be here soon. Later. We’ll silence the room once the kids are in bed.”
Piling his sandwiches and some crisps on a plate, Harry grabs a butterbeer and heads back to the couch. Tonight is going to consist of food, the couch, bad television, and texting Draco. Arranging himself comfortably, he flips on the telly and reaches for his phone as it vibrates.
“Some people can’t leave the past in the past.” Harry waves a hand dismissively. “Thank you for this.” Harry raises the bottle of wine and takes Draco’s jacket, hanging it on one of the hooks in the entry. “Come on through to the kitchen. You’ll be stuck in there if you want company, at least until dinner goes into the oven.”
“I do. I’m actually quite nervous.” Harry takes a moment to look Draco over. He looks fantastic, even if he’s not as formally dressed as Harry. “I appreciate it even more since it’s you.”
“I love you, Harry.”
“I can’t even imagine.
“Please stand, gentlemen.”
“It’s a lot, love. I hate seeing you in so much pain but you’re managing it so well. You’re doing so much better than I ever would. And there are no words to tell you what this means to me, for you to bring our son into the world.”
Draco’s eyebrows rise. “You did their cooking?” Draco sounds surprised and maybe a little angry.
Harry groans, his own cock hardening further just knowing he’s about to give Draco his very first blow job. “Tell me what feels good, and tell me if anything doesn’t, yeah?”
“I’m nervous. I feel ridiculous, but I’m nervous.”
Draco emerges from their en suite as Harry closes the bedroom door, having just finished telling all four kids good night. They meet in the middle and Harry immediately relaxes against Draco’s chest, laying his head on the taller man’s shoulder. They haven’t had a moment alone all day. He’s missed the comfort and warmth of being in Draco’s arms.
“Good. You are welcome at ours any time.” Harry turns to James. “We’ve a Portkey home since I can’t Side-Along any of you anymore, so why don’t you walk Matthew to the barrier and find a place to say goodbye for now?”
“That’s the plan, but just in case.” Harry can hear the desperation in his own voice. He needs to know that his kids will be cared for, even if something does go wrong.
Draco leads them to Jubilee Gardens, where there’s a picnic blanket spread out with a large hamper next to it. Harry feels the magic of the gentle Muggle-Repelling Charm around it as they approach.
James smiles. “Someday, I hope.”
“It’s about half four.”
“Your membrane is totally dilated and broken. You’re at about a 7 of 10 for your anal opening. You’ve really done a fantastic job labouring so long at home, you’re nearly there. I would bet you’ll have a baby within the next two hours.”
Harry shudders as another spell washes through him. He closes his eyes as his emotions threaten to overwhelm him. This is all so much, and there’s no way to get a break.
“Mr Potter, how are you feeling?” Healer Carr follows Draco into the bedroom where Harry is already laying in the bed, waiting. Draco sits in the chair they’ve moved next to Harry’s side of the bed and takes his hand.
“I know, love. I know.” Gentle hands smooth his hair as he writhes, his body attempting to somehow alleviate the pain as fluid gushes from his body.
“It’s been a long time for me, too.” Harry is flooded with relief at the fact that Draco isn’t upset at the proposition. A thrill runs through his groin, hoping that before the weekend is out, maybe even tonight, Draco will be buried inside him.
“You’ll make quite the pair, then.” Harry beams at his son, then turns to Hermione. “Have you seen my groom?”
Standing in the doorway to the nursery, Harry prepares the box that contains the painting charms.
“Any magical fatigue?”
“It’s fine, Dad.” James looks concerned, as well. “Draco will take us. You really look like you could use the rest. You’ll write though, to let us know when you feel better?”
“Damn it, Draco! I hate this!”
“Oh?” Draco arches an eyebrow.
“Thank you,” Harry sighs. “I feel a bit useless lying about all the time, but between that and the potion Draco brewed, I am at least more comfortable.”
“Like…I grew up without my parents, so maybe making life better for orphaned children. My kids don’t have their mother so maybe doing something to benefit single or widowed parents. Harry pauses and thinks. It’s so hard to remember sometimes, what used to make him,
“When my father died, she was given the widow’s vaults — which is more than enough for her to live three lifetimes on — and the Manor and family vaults went to me as the new Head of the House of Malfoy.” Harry nods, already having known this much. “But if I had entered a relationship with a man before he died, my father could have removed me from the estate. Basically, he would have completely kicked me out of the family, like I never existed, meaning my mother would have gotten all the vaults to do with as she pleased. My mother has no power to do anything now, as I am already the Head of House.
“I could join you?”
“I’ll let you get some rest. I’ll be back in a little while.”
“Oh, Draco.”
The phone flashes as the call is disconnected, and then Matthew and Draco appear in the kitchen.
Apparently sensing his unease, Draco leans down to whisper in his ear as the charms wash over him and the Healer’s fingers slide in.
“Yeah. I mean, I haven’t had a lot of it, but it was definitely good.”
Hermione looks quite confused when both men burst out laughing.
Draco’s face splits into a soft grin. “We’re going to have a baby?”
“You’re twenty-nine weeks, so that sounds about right.” The Healer conjures her usual table and lays out her equipment. “I am a bit concerned about the hip pain and the increase in pressure, so let’s see what’s going on.”
“Better?”
Draco lifts the ring and studies it, before handing it to Harry. Harry looks it over and the more he looks at it, the more he likes it.
“That sounds wonderful. Both the bed
Harry walks in from the kitchen, two cups of tea in hand, setting one on the table. “It’s probably Hermione. I’m not answering, seeing as we’re both in our pants.” He laughs, envisioning Hermione’s reaction if she were to see Draco and Harry lying on the couch, in their pants, looking well-shagged and drinking tea. He arches an eyebrow at Draco, who is obviously having a similar mental image, and bursts out laughing. “She’ll text if I don’t open the Floo.”
Lily grins at the mention of takeaway.
“My variation took longer to brew, but it binds a person’s benevolent core magic — and
Harry sets a pan on the hob for popcorn and reaches past James for the oil. James’ hand flies out, grabbing Harry’s wrist before he can retrieve the bottle.
“Very well. I’ll apply a thick potion to your lower abdomen first and then conjure an imaging bubble. I’ll use my wand to transmit the image and I’ll explain as I go.”
“I’m not encouraging you to have sex. I’d prefer you wait. There’s a lot of responsibility that comes with the consequences of sex. But I wasn’t much older than you when I started having sex, so I’m not going to pretend it’s not happening. I
“Yes, the same I’ve always brewed. He just had a third dose before I called you. But he hasn’t kept anything down all day.”
“Are we?”
Draco’s eyes dance with a bit of mischief and a lot of love.
Harry lowers his gaze, keeping his eyes firmly on his nearly empty plate. “It’s Draco Malfoy.”
straight. I can’t make myself straight. And I’m happy with my sexuality and with James. I don’t want to change that.”
“Just notes, no actual names.” Harry hasn’t wanted to make any kind of naming decision without Draco’s input. It’s very important to him that this name be something both of them love.
“I just want the Malfoy name and everything it stands for to be left in the past. We — our whole family — we’re better than that.”
“Very well. Let me start this bloodwork, and we’ll make sure the baby is doing all right.” She turns to her table, and Draco turns back to Harry. Soft lips kiss his forehead and a hand cups his cheek.
“What questions do you have?” Draco speaks up, stepping closer to Harry and laying a hand on the small of his back.
“Is he talking or shouting?” Harry asks in concern.
“That’s the last of it.” Draco closes the doors to his wardrobe and turns to Harry. Harry settles his hands on Draco’s hips and kisses him softly. Draco huffs out a laugh against his lips and Harry eyes him curiously. “We’re living together. Just kind of surreal.”
Harry lifts his knee and Healer Carr’s charm washes over him and fingers slide in. He feels the hard spot in his abdomen shift with the internal pressure and press towards his hand.
“We’ll see you soon.” Harry’s eyes close, and he floats away.
“Sex.”
“Sure!” James pushes away from the table and everyone else follows. Lily hurries to start pulling blankets and extra pillows from the chest behind the couch and passing them to Matthew, who lays them out on the couches and chairs. Draco starts levitating furniture so everyone will be able to see the screen.
“Missing something?” Harry tries to smirk but bursts out laughing all over again.
Two loud cracks announce the arrival of the other four children. Draco and Hermione both smile as Harry accepts hugs from each of them from his new recliner.
know that dating me — that being in a relationship with me — comes with…Er…” Harry rolls his eyes. “Publicity, I guess?”
“Should I call the Healer?”
“Perfect, now—” The Healer places her hands on top of James’ “—If we press, just a little… There. Do you feel that hard, round spot?”
“Neither did I, but we didn’t even get forty-eight hours to enjoy being engaged before I started getting sick.” Harry regrets not getting to bask in the joy of Draco proposing. He especially regrets not getting to celebrate privately with Draco after the kids returned to Hogwarts.
“Hello, Draco,” Harry says with immense relief in his voice. “Ready for lunch, then? Let me put a better stasis on my Magiscope, and we can go.” He flashes a grateful grin at Draco — who still looks somewhat thunderous — and heads for his own station.
Draco smiles softly at him. “So you didn’t hear my question?”
much about his appearance. He never had when he was dating several men after the war, and he certainly never had with Ginny. There’s just something different about this date with Draco.
“Okay…”
“I think I understand.” Malfoy heaves a sigh, “Would you like to go get a cup of tea?”
The answering look on Draco’s face is positively lascivious.
Draco eases back, taking Harry’s face in both his hands and studying his face. Draco’s eyes are molten silver with desire, and Harry could absolutely lose himself in them. Draco presses a soft kiss to Harry’s lips and then steps away, pulling a plush blanket from the couch and spreading it on the floor in front of the fire.
“Thanks, Son.” Harry turns to follow James and Draco up the stairs.
Obediently, Harry goes to the closet and starts folding and hanging clothes. Several piles later, Hermione has three outfits laid out on the bed. “Ok, first question. Are you wearing your glasses or are you using a vision charm?”
Draco closes his book and places it on his nightstand with his glasses, and Harry settles against him. Harry feels Draco press a kiss to the top of his head.
“We’re studying multiple series of imaging of patients who eventually haemorrhaged from their core for unknown reasons. It’s a lot like what happened to Gin. It’s a huge age range, from kids to adults, but once I got past that first series that had me so frustrated on Monday, I started seeing a lot of patterns.” Harry closes the drawer he’s been working on and opens the next. “I’ve been able to untangle almost all of the benign and benevolent magic so the malevolent can be sent to the Curse-Breakers. I might actually get sent over to Curse-Breaking for a few days towards the end of the week, so we can try to break some of the nastier stuff.”
“I’m sure she did.” Draco chuckles before looking at Harry with narrowed eyes, a bit of confusion crossing his face. “Did you not have any other help? I mean, surely the Weasleys…”
“Don’t you dare make me cum until you’re inside me.” He clenches softly around Draco’s finger. “More, Draco.”
“Any fever?”
“I also just don’t know much about male pregnancy. I suppose I should learn. And James will need to learn, as well.” Harry pauses thoughtfully. “Do you want to see if Hermione wants to come for dinner?”
Harry shifts back, easing the soft black fabric off Draco’s feet. He nudges Draco's knees apart, running his hands over the muscled legs from ankles to hips and settling himself on his forearms between them. Looking up into Draco's face, he sees swirling silver eyes that are lust-blown, staring back at him intently, pink lips slightly parted.
Three days later, Harry is humming softly to the wireless as he finishes chopping onions at the kitchen counter. He scans the ingredients for his favourite chicken and pasta dish, laid out on the counter, and reaches for the garlic. Just as he’s peeling the first clove, a tapping sound draws his attention to the kitchen window. Opening it, Harry takes in the impressive-looking eagle owl.
Harry’s quiet lust-filled voice is the only sound in the room. He presses his arse back, welcoming the dildo’s stretch and the slight burn that accompanies it.
“Keep an eye on your sister, and be careful, ok?”
Harry laughs softly. “Guilty as charged.”
“I love you, too, Dad. I will.”
Draco smiles at Harry before turning to lead him out of the hidden Apparition point. Walking hand in hand with Draco is nearly surreal. Harry hasn’t been with
“Well, that won’t be an issue after tomorrow.” Harry takes a breath. “I’d like to discuss more about what your parents said. Would you prefer to have James here for that.”
“His level of dehydration is concerning.”
“That sounds fabulous.”
Draco gently rocks them back and forth as Harry moans. The wedge from earlier feels like it’s being hammered into his hips and there’s an immense amount of pressure pushing down towards the base of his spine. He’s certain his hips are going to shatter. Guttural noises escape his mouth, unlike anything he’s ever heard before.
“Is it that late already?” Draco’s surprise makes Harry chuckle. His fiancé loses himself in his work quite often. Having the lab at home has led to some unintentional late-night brewing when he forgets to set a
“Me, too.”
said basically the same thing the first night he came over for dinner. ‘If our eleven-year-old selves could see us now.’”
Hand in hand, they walk, talking about anything and everything except the fact that in a matter of hours, Harry has to push a baby out of his body. They talk about Lily and her excitement over visiting Mina and her family. They talk about Albus and his progress with his anxiety. They talk about Scorpius and his blossoming love of Potions. They talk about James and Matthew and their post-Hogwarts inclinations. Anything but birthing their child.
“Draco?”
She begins casting her usual series of spells over Harry and making rapid notes on her parchment.
“Did you plan this?” James is the first to find his voice. Judging by his expression, he’s not at all sure how to feel about this situation.
Draco wraps an arm around Harry and offers his support as they shuffle inside. Once he is settled in the recliner, Draco kneels in front of the fireplace and Harry taps on his phone.
“There we are!” The healer’s face relaxes and she gestures to the bubble. “Do you see the dark circle?”
The corners of James’ mouth turn up.
and Harry sees his lips quirk at the title. “You can read it this weekend, then you can leave it here or take it back to Hogwarts. But read over the section about using toys alone or with a partner. If there’s something you want, we’ll get what you need.”
“It does.” Draco reaches for both of Harry’s hands and squeezes them. “I feel so lucky. I never expected to get the chance to be in a serious relationship…to get the chance to fall in love. But here we are.”
“I can’t figure out what to wear.” Harry’s hands twist into his hair and he sighs. “I
When his face swims into focus, Harry can tell he’s been crying. His face is pinched with worry, but then there’s a spread of the slightest bit of relief.
“I don’t remember.”
“Yeah.” Harry can’t figure out the emotion in Draco’s hesitant voice. “Yeah. That’s brilliant.”
Some colour returns to the boy’s face and he nods. “That would be good.”
“I am, as well, but your pacing isn’t going to do anything to help.” Draco sets his cup down and moves in front of Harry. Steadying hands grasp his hips and Draco’s soft lips cover his. After several minutes of languid snogging, Harry is less nervous but more aroused.
“Good!” Al smiles.
“Oh, surely you’ve read the unauthorised tell-alls that came out after the war,” Harry says with mild disdain. “They even had pictures.”
Harry closes his eyes and takes in a deep breath of crisp autumn air, holding it for several seconds before letting it out. Opening his eyes, he finally turns towards Draco.
“Have you decided when you’ll talk to them?” Draco asks as he appears beside Harry.
Immediately shuffling away, Harry smiles carefully at her. “I think you were right, Claire. The orange bit does appear to be Dark Magic, or at least close to it. I’d leave that bit for the Curse-Breakers.”
James’ eyes are wide as he looks down at the hand he’s gripping. He looks back to Harry’s face.
