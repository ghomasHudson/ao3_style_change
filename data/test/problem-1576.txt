“I thought there was no one left in the world who hasn’t read my book! Every day is something new! Worry no more, I’ll sign one and send it over right away. Good-bye!” Draco’s ears picked up on Lockhart’s voice, but that didn’t shake the image of
Draco dropped Harry’s hand and stood. “I’ll see if I can get some salve for this. We should get back." He gathered his lantern. "Talk to Sirius. Talking to him always makes you feel better. He can probably tell you more about what's happening at the Ministry.”
"This is something that you must carry on your own. I’ve made some bad plans, Draco, but it was for me to not get attached. Attachment makes people reckless, impulsive, and those things never come out so well. I do not like it, and you might not like it as well, but it’s for the best. Understand?”
I’m giving it next—oh hey, Draco, Michael.” Anthony and Terry saw the two boys push their ways to the seats saved for them.
A vein on Draco’s temple pulsed. “Ron, don’t make this more difficult than it needs to be. Just. Take. My. Waist. Now!”
“What’s it mean?” Draco asked. Harry’s throat bobbed, but the boy stayed quiet. “Does it mean something bad?”
“You expect me to wear the horrid thing I have? No way! Everyone's going to have normal ones. Even Harry has normal ones.” Ron grabbed Draco’s shoulders. “Mate, they smell like my great aunt Tessie."
Against his better judgment, Draco wrote Harry’s name. He also wrote 'hates' with more force than necessary.
“We both are terrible at following through things we say. I don’t put it against you. I know how hard it can be. And I can never hate you.”
Draco knew that it would be helpful for him to learn the spell, but he rather not deal with Harry’s cold shoulder while trying to conjure a nonexistent joyful memory.
this chapter was originally longer but since i don't have the second half completely finished and it's been too long since i updated that i split it in half :)
To my American readers, if you want to help with the protests happening despite not having the money to donate or going out to protests, then I highly encourage y’all to check out
“And since you’re already fixed,” Anthony added. “I’m sure he won’t do anything drastic.” Draco still didn’t feel satisfied with that answer. He only had to hope that his father was changed enough this time around to not let the school governors know about this incident.
If Potter didn’t want his insight then that was fine. If Potter wanted to act like their whole conversation by the Black Lake never even happened then
Hermione nodded and attempted to search for another topic. "Oh, Ron and I was chosen as prefects!" she said a touch too loudly.
“I can… talk to you about all these… things?” Draco’s writing was slow, his thoughts all jumbled that he couldn’t tell what to put on paper or what to keep for himself.
“Draco, why are you defending him? I know he’s your godfather, but please—“ Weasley and Granger came out, saving Draco from speaking.
The boy wildly searched the air to see what was the cause. He found none. Fletcher gave Draco one last scowl. “Like, I said,
“I am, too. But it’s for him. If something is to come out of this, it'll only to give us enough accountability to save him if no one else."
“Oh, yes, of course, Terrence dear,” Mrs Boot waved her hand. “Whatever you say. Alright, I’ll bet you boys are tired from the long journey. Let’s get out of here.”
“You think Ireland’s gonna lose?” Ron asked, reaching out for another biscuit from the centre of the coffee table.
An old memory connected. The secret organization that Umbridge sent around Draco and the rest of that nauseating Inquisitorial Squad to go find. It was this year? He barely remembered it. Draco also didn't know that it was Hermione who thought of it, but he shouldn't be surprised that it was her.
about it. He wasn’t going to get rid of it for the sake of the meatheads in front of him. With a deep breath, he said something that he wouldn’t even consider in his old life.
"'S probably nothin'. Come on, we'll switch groups so Neville will be with me." Glaring at the back of Longbottom's head, he followed until he met Harry and Granger were standing in the clearing. "Neville just got a bit scared. How's about we switch up the groups? Hermione, with me 'n Neville. Draco, you can go with Harry."
"I hear the line at Flourish and Blotts is madness, so I'm going to do some more private runs and we'll meet there."
longer than should have, but even when it softened to indifference and Draco just waiting for a girl to catch his eye… there was no one. He never knew what to do with Pansy’s affections. If anything, he took advantage of them. He lightly indulged in them because he really liked it when someone stroked through his hair and gave him a slight taste of his fantasies. Lucius told him during sixth year that his marriage arrangement would be someone from the Greengrass family and Draco can say with complete honesty he didn’t know anyone by that name despite his father saying they were in the same house and not that apart in age.
“Now that’s because the actual gift of Sight is not something you can achieve by a book or by a form of academic study…” Trelawney’s huge eyes landed pointedly at Hermione who was visibly startled. “It is a Gift that is so scarcely given to mortal beings as of recent past. It is something that you can’t just be achieved by a sudden anomaly--
, he said, “My father… He’s returned to You-Know-Who. He said he’d try to be better and—I live with the benefit of that, Aunt. They said they’d change for the better but they
There was an archaic feeling of uneasiness as Draco stood on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, letting Aunt Andromeda smooth his hair.
“So what are you thinking about this Lockhart guy?” Terry asked as he checked over his timetable. “Think he’ll be any good?”
"Yeah, you're not one to chase glory, Harry," Cedric added. "And any glory you have is because you were only doing the right thing."
!” Terry grimaced as a beetle scurried by his shoe and darted unevenly down the stairs and into the shadows of the corridor. “Does Hogwarts got a bug problem now?”
want to get on Moody's bad side, both for his benefit and not tainting the friendship he and Tonks had. Draco didn't understand Moody one bit and, unfortunately, it seemed like he needed to. But he didn't think that he'll figure out in time.
"Draco!" He spun around at the sound of his name to see Harry grinning at him. The journal was pushed into the small of his back to hide it from Harry.
Draco opened his mouth to protest his father’s treatment of Dobby but thought better of it. He quietly deposited himself on a couch.
Draco crept over to look over Harry’s shoulder. It was a doodle of a Snitch. Draco rolled his eyes on how it was
"Dobby likes the new young master Draco. He's nice. Madam is kind. Dobby needs to repay on how Dobby has hurt young master Draco's friend, Harry Potter."
Draco made sure he picked an empty compartment. He dropped his truck in with a loud thump, not bothering to move it out of the aisle as he flung himself on the seat. Rubbing tired eyes, he pushed his blonde hair away to look at the compartment's ceiling. He was alone and he was confused by that. Usually was the time that Harry and Weasley found him, leading to a discussion over Quidditch while Harry tried to follow helplessly. He dug deep into his memories... they did something this year at the feast... and it involved a Howler somehow. A very loud Howler. It seemed so important back then now it was hard to even remember it happened.
Draco left the table and dashed out to the trapdoor. The ladder shuddered as Draco tried to grabble down.
Shaking his head, Draco took his hand away from the shelves and continued further into the library. In a forgotten corner, Draco knelt down to pull out an ancient book. Its leather cover was frayed and the Black family crest was peeling off from the centre. His mother’s family history book.
. The Head of Houses should go and inform their students of the Express that'll arrive tomorrow to bring them home. Please make sure that there are no loose students still running around. This will be the final year of Hogwarts." McGonagall found Snape in the faces of grim professors. "Severus, are you alright? I'm sure that Mr. Malfoy can't be--"
There was an acute awareness that Harry was staring at him and Draco didn't know what else to do but to stare right back. Both boys were pink-cheeked as Harry’s bright green eyes seemed to try to convey something but it was lost to Draco.
"It was because he knew something, right?" Harry asked, making Ron's head jump from the table. It was the first time he'd spoken since they'd found out about Draco. "That's what he was going to tell us that morning."
” It was weird for Draco to hear Dumbledore’s voice be raised. “I do not think Draco attacked that student.”
The rest of the time leading up to the holiday break was students practically crawling over each other so they wouldn’t get in his way. As if they stared at him too long, they’d be turned to stone. Anthony, Terry, and Michael didn’t even seem the slightest bit phased that the entire school thought one of their best friend attacked those people.
They went through the entire extended song and one restart before Draco was beginning to get satisfied.
"Professor, he needs to go to Hospital Wing." Anthony slipped his arm around Draco and lugged him up. Draco kept a tight hand on his arm but didn’t stop the stinging and his sleeve started to stick to his skin because of his wound.
"He didn't win the trial." She said as she handed over the letter. He saw that Hagrid included his name when thanking Hermione for helping with the case.
Draco remembered the unforgiving burn of the Dark Mark, the lifeless eyes of the half-bloods and muggle-borns, Dumbledore washed over in a wave of green, the Dark Lord’s angry face before the world was enveloped into darkness.
"D—D—Dobby is just doing some extra helping out, Master Draco sir! Helping out Master Draco! Keeping Master Draco safe!" the tray in the house-elf's hands began shaking.
Draco was walking back to Ravenclaw Tower when he heard his name called. He turned around to Michael hurrying beside him, blushing brightly with a large smile on his face.
His eyes gravitated to the lower branches and saw his mother’s young portrait once more. He saw a twig connect to Bellatrix, then the twig seemed to sicken when it reached another portrait of a girl with similar features to Bellatrix. Andromeda Black. An aunt. He has an aunt. An aunt he’s never known about. But
“He’s… I don’t think he’s a bad guy, Harry.” Draco said, but his shortened breath and most likely broken ribs said something different.
! "The attacker has to be smart, right? Attacking when everyone was in one place and distracted, not to mention aware of them... they would be dumb as to attack so much, right? It’ll bring them attention. Spacing the attacks will the smartest way.”
” Draco’s eyes went immediately to the boy next to Weasley. Harry’s eyes found his and they stared silently. They continued staring until Molly Weasley’s voice reached a higher note, Draco winced and Harry went pink and made himself smaller, looking pointedly at his porridge.
let me go, won't you? It's not like anything can happen while I'm getting candy and having a butterbeer."
Harry also flew down to the ground and tried to head towards Draco’s direction, but intercepted by a mass of Gryffindors. They swarmed the pitch and gathered him up, bouncing him on top of the crowd. Harry only stared at the back of Draco’s head as the boy walked to the changing room with the other Ravenclaws.
“Welcome to Arithmancy, I’m Professor Vector and if you’re here then that means you have gone against the warnings given to you by the older students and still joined my class.” Professor Vector passed her gaze in the first row of students, locking down a fidgeting Hufflepuff boy. “Some I believe should’ve heeded their warning.”
Cho furrowed her brow but stood and followed their professor down the Ravenclaw Tower and to the Headmaster’s Tower. They entered and saw four chairs lined up in front of Dumbledore with two already filled. One chair held an older woman in furs that regarded them with a frown. The other chair held Gabrielle.
Draco was about to lift cloak up to leave when Potter whispered, "It's here—just here—yes!" He grinned as he pushed opened a door.
"We were right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone. Snape's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it." Harry said.
"Quite a chance for us to meet," Draco played along and laughing and grabbing the attention of Lucius.
“Are you still thinking about trying to get prefect next year?” Draco asked, thinking back to their recent conversation in their letters.
Draco felt himself shake, frustrated tears burning behind his eyes as he glared at the ground. “I thought you said you’d trust me.”
Trelawney’s gaze passed over the blond’s face before she swept away, wiping tears under her glasses and sniffed wetly. She continued her introduction with ease as if she didn’t leave Draco to calm himself silently at the table with a thudding, panicked heart. Her request to do tea leaf readings seemed laughable at that point.
The Ravenclaw door burst open. Dozens of giddy third years poured into the common room, disturbing the previous silence Draco had for studying.
The three Ravenclaws looked at him. Their faces turned weary at Draco showing an emotion more than unusual for the blond.
." Giddy laughter suddenly burst out of his mouth, and the hairs on the back of Harry's neck stood up. "I simply never grew bored of his stories! He carries all of this weight alone and it's like he's having a mid-life crisis at twelve! Worrying about outcomes of certain events, how this or that will affect the future, or..." Tom peeked at him through his black hair. "how did he ever become friends with Harry Potter despite all the things that happened."
“Tonks! Don’t disturb Professor Moody,” Draco said before an abrupt headache slammed into the blond.
Months fluttered passed with each day of cramming and practically relearning everything within a night until exam week arrived in the second week of June.
“Now,” Draco closed his eyes to gather every strand of strength he had to say his next sentence. “Take my waist.”
“I saw Cedric dead, Harry,” Draco yelled. “And… it would’ve destroyed you, Harry. You were… screaming and everyone was just—Cedric is a good person that didn’t deserve to die and more than anything I wanted to make sure that you didn’t have to go through that pain because seeing someone die right in front of you… You’re never the same.”
“I want us… I want us to be more than friends,” He rushed out before turning back imploringly, lightly grasping at Harry’s shirt. “Oh, Harry, can we be more than friends?”
The game made Draco feel exhilarated. Viktor Krum still had the ability to make Draco stand on his tiptoes with his Omnioculars to catch better glimpses of him in action. (Draco felt the beginnings of an archaic, forgotten hyper interest in Viktor Krum was about to grab hold of Draco and spiral him back into the fanlike obsession if he wasn’t too careful.)
Edward eyed her briefly, cast a glance at Draco, before heaving a breath. “Alright, alright. Guess you should probably come in then.” He opened the door further.
Giant craters were in the place of faces such as Sirius and Andromeda along with others he didn’t expect.
Harry perked up at the sight of him. “Draco!” His smile faded when Draco stifled a yawn. “Oh. Were you asleep?”
"Why not?" Tom asked. "After all, I'm the one who knows you best. I'm your closest friend." He held out his arms for a hug. "So come here, my dear time--"
"No, I want to tell you. I..." Harry gulped very loudly, confusing Draco so very much. “care about you a lot, too. And I—I—need to say is that-- what I need to say is that I really, really,
Ravenclaw kept a steady pace of scoring, easing off pressure form Draco, but Fletcher looped around him like a vulture. “Are you ever going to play the game, Malfoy?!" he screamed. "It’s not to be as fun to beat you if you don’t!” Draco cursed under his breath and sped far from Fletcher.
Draco tried to pay no attention to his father and the shop owner talking about selling Dark Magic objects from the manor so they would seem clean or how the discriminated against Arthur Weasley. He found himself in front of a decaying hand on a cushion. He remembered this... the Hand of Glory... he recalled asking his father if he could get this, only to be reminded that Granger had beat him for top grades  that first year.
A bolt of green light exploded in the crystal ball. Draco shot back in his chair, chills running down his back.
“He’s been Stunned,” Tonks said. “This part’s easy.” She pulled out her wand and pointed it at Cedric’s chest. “
The entire month of January had either Draco or Harry displaced from their friend group when they would gather together. (Michael would also often be missing, yet he had a happier reason for his absence.) Draco would glance up from during meals and see Harry turning away and Draco wouldn’t feel hungry anymore. Draco continued to help Hermione with her secret studying of spells Harry could use in the tournament, but his mood would always be occupied with squirming guilt or awkwardness on how he last left things with Harry.
"Sorry, but your eggs were about to go cold," Mrs Boot said placing a plate in front of him. "I here I thought Terry would be the one who'd we have trouble waking."
Far away from Grimmauld Place, Draco smoothed down a red and black long-sleeved shirt in front of his mirror, making Bulgaria’s Quidditch crest properly visible. After a once-over and running a quick hand through his hair, he went over to his bed to gather up the various letters spread across it.
Draco bit at his lip. “Harry, I need to tell you something. There’s going to be a professor this year sent from the Ministry. She’s going to be more vicious than she looks."
Draco thought on what an owl that was owned by the Weasleys must’ve seen. What did clean and young eyes saw in its lifetime? Maybe saw messy breakfasts, carrying more and more letters as new red-haired children appeared in the house. Carrying care packages of food over long distances to be delivered.
Looking back outside to the green school grounds, he looked over and saw streaks of red around the Quidditch field.
Nil must’ve seen Draco’s shift of emotion because he narrowed his eyes angrily, his nostrils flaring. “Freak.” Fletcher spat, pushing off Crabbe and Goyle’s hands and stomping through them, going further and further down the train opposite of where Harry and Draco were heading. The blond turned to see Harry’s brow knit in question but Draco shook his head.
Somehow, that kiss toppled Draco’s composure more than the kisses from earlier. He laughed airily. “Yes, goodnight.”
Anthony, Terry, Michael, and Draco were in the Ravenclaw Common Room, pretending to do homework, but none were able to concentrate on the jarring tension of Draco’s forced nonchalance on his textbook. Three of the boys were giving silent nods over to Draco, pushing one of them to breach the tension (but they were met with incredulous shakes).
Draco rolled his eyes, waving an unbothered hand. “Don’t put him on a pedestal. Always bothers me when people do that.” Draco glanced out the window to see the train finally picked up its travelling speed. “I’m actually pretty good at Quidditch.” A brief silence pulled Draco away from the window to see the dubious looks from the other boys. “What? I am!”
Draco shook his head, feeling dumb that he thought Potter was someone that would have his back. To talk to when they were going through something…. and all he did was yell and shove him away.
"Draco," He wanted to duck down, but that wouldn't help him at all. "I gave you expectations. Did I not?" They were sitting in his father's office. The office he used for his work at the Ministry of Magic which was all for business and the place Draco would go for his lectures and punishments.
Draco turned around and was knocked down to the ground once more. He looked found himself being stared down by a Death Eater. Their impassive silver mask glinting in the flames. Before Draco could begin to get up and run away, the Death Eater's wand was in his hand and with one flick of his wrist, Draco was sent into darkness.
“You’re also a freak, Malfoy. You know that?” Fletcher interrupted, finally turning toward the blond. “I never interacted with you in my life. Ever. I never even heard about you until Hogwarts.” Fletcher gave him a distrustful glare. “Yet why do I feel like you know everything about me? You don’t! You have no idea who I am! You know NOTHING!”
“Yes, it is.” Lucius pulled out an old, broken pocket watch from his robes. “Hold onto this." He held out the watch's chain.
Minutes of the sound of rustling leaves and they met with a crossbow wielding gamekeeper. "What happened?"
Terry forced a cough. “So… So Anthony! Your family--Some of your family from America are coming over?” He asked Anthony.
“You’ll see.” She said and smoothed a hand over his hair and opened the door, letting Draco out first.
"Master Draco? Dobby is here to tell you that you are going to Diagon Alley for school supplies." Draco shot up to see it was indeed Dobby who was holding the breakfast tray up to him.
A nightmare. Another nightmare of walking down dark, empty hallways that stretched forever until his throat was seized by sharp pinpricks of a snake. (God, he hated that snake with every fibre of his being.) Draco had brief moments of light sleep in between his restless tossing and turning, but he still woke up more tired than before. These sort of nights was one of the things Draco didn’t miss.
“How was what?” Draco set his bookbag against his bedpost. He walked up to Scabbers on his sock-made bed, petting the rat awake.
Shakily, he stood up, keeping his hand tucked in as he walked down the corridor, hoping he could find Ravenclaw’s staircase soon.
"We're first years, sir. Waiting to be sorted," Draco replied. If Bloody Baron taught the Slytherins anything, it was to always reply and show respect to the ghosts here, unless they want Peeves after them.
"Well, it doesn't matter now, come on, we have to go over here." Anthony greeted and pulled them in a train until they reached a free carriage.
“Yeah, cool, great. I’ll see you later.” Harry agreed before practically running down the corridor, leaving a mildly confused Draco.
Draco looked up to Hagrid as if he would advise on how to deal with a crying girl. Hagrid just gestured back to her.
“Malfoy, I’m about to tell you something important so listen closely." The man lowered down to make the boy look him in the eye. "Keep Potter safe."
“Oh, right,” Harry rubbed his forehead. “Sorry, I’m just…” Harry closes his eyes and laid his head back on the pillow. Draco tried to work out what else to say to the dark haired boy.
Tonks noticed the workbook on the table and laughed. She picked up the dormant songbird. “Couldn’t speak French? Yeah,” She placed the bird down. “Mum had to stick me to the chair for my lessons when I was a kid. Literally, I wouldn’t be able to move for hours.” She sighed, scratching the back of her head. “But...
“Not really. It’s just that… Ron said something… that… they locked you up. Like a caged animal.” Draco turned towards Harry. “Is that true?”
Draco ignored him and forced himself closer, his eyes straining against the sharp intensity of the wind. And, for a moment, his fingers brushed the golden surface.
Along with wearing jumpers and denims with casual ease, Draco had not been putting product in his hair and had been wearing his least fancy clothing all around the mansion for the last month. He had tried wearing his 'fancy' clothes and styling hair once more, but it had made him look like a mini-Lucius. That right there should give anyone shivers.
drew perfect art for this fic and im????still????in shock????how was this story blessed with such talent??????
Andromeda seemed to pick up on it and started with, “It’s quite an adjustment, isn’t it? Being uprooted from your home with little explanation and even less time."
The grounds a darkened almost pitch-black blue. Draco tripped and crashed into Harry, grabbing his shoulders for support. Draco glanced up at him. Bright moonlight made one side of Harry’s face glow.
“It’s--It’s just a matter of circumstances. If I wasn’t in certain situations with Harry and if I wasn’t there where I was--He would have never liked me. I’ve seen it before. He’s meant to go out with someone else.”
“I’m here, Father.” The blond cleared his throat and descended the stairs once more. “Is it time to go?”
Draco remembered how Ron tried to provide comfort on the train. How Anthony let him take shelter in his arms the rest of the trip to Hogwarts. Harry promised that they had each other's back with honest eyes. That’s what Draco wanted to focus on.
Draco looked at the scene with a smile on his face before he got up from the pile. He tiptoed around the sleeping boys to get downstairs. He crept into the living room to get on the large window seat Draco noticed on arrival.
Draco left the kitchen and tried to shake off his nerves. He held his breath as he crept up the stairs and passed by the curtain portrait to go down the hallway. He reached out the door and entered an unused bedroom. The furniture was draped in white tarps, spiderwebs developing in the corners of the ceiling.
"Wait, what's that?" Past Harry, Draco saw a clearing and the moonlight was making something seem to glow on the ground. "I think it's the unicorn!" Rushing past Harry (hearing a sad sigh behind), he went to look at the unicorn. It was beautifully sad.
“Are you sure?” Anthony asked, not really wanting to leave Draco alone at the moment. "It's not a problem to go with you--"
"Draco--!" Snape called out and Draco was a few paces away from the Potions classroom when he heard a quiet
Nil shoved Draco hard as they ascended, almost throwing him off balance as he sped off. Draco glared back at the back of Fletcher’s head.
While the platform began to fill, Draco practised little spells nonverbally. Getting lost in the magic, he didn't hear the door open again.
Draco took a peek at the boy’s parchment as he set his own textbooks on the table. “You didn’t even start it.”
Draco suddenly got close to Harry, inches away from his face with the use of his toes. Harry's eyes went wide, his throat seeming to work to get back into function. "I will take that challenge then." Draco turned away, looking for his last book. "I didn't think I'll see you until school started again."
“Just go.” The two left and Draco tightened his grip on his wand, too scared to let it go. It made him feel better that he had his wand again. A sense of familiarity that would never be changed. Something to ground him in this bizarre game of chance.
Draco climbed out of bed and went over to Terry's area. He picked up the newspaper and unfurled it to read the headline.
"Potter and them came by asking for you," Michael said. "Said something was urgent, but I bet they can do it without you. You need to get more rest."
“As long as nothing catches fire, I’m good,” Michael replied. Draco heard the noise of Micheal’s pillow collapsing onto his weight. “Happy Hanukkah, mate.”
“Then stop asking the same question,” he snapped, getting a shocked look from his three friends as he stood up, gathering the books in his arms. “I’ll talk to you later.” Then he left the Great Hall.
walking down the hallway. And, And I can tell that he's looking for something. Sirius has told me as much. There’s something at the Ministry that the Order is trying to protect. And they don't think the Ministry is going to be safe anymore. Well, we already know that the Ministry's a broken system."
"There are others religions, you know?" Anthony said as they stood outside the Great Hall, admiring.
"Er, no thank you." The blonde shrugged and bit into the chocolate bar one more time before he sighed and let his hand drop in his lap.
“Hermione’s cat keeps trying to hunt it. Ron’s asked me to look after it.” Draco pulled out his pyjamas. Being a rat-sitter was the least bizarre thing to happen to him.
“Rid your mind of all distraction…” Her voice laid like a spell. "And focus." Noises faded out of existence as Draco’s eyes got tunnel vision on the crystal ball.
Refusing any other attempts at changing his appearance, Tonks tried to distract Draco the last few weeks of the summer holiday. She took him to the cinema for the first time (“When they said the film was going to be about a vampire interview...” Tonks said as they stepped outside, and a few hours later. “I was expecting something a
The Second Task was a bore, and the entire competition was entirely unexciting since public opinion on Harry Potter switched when everyone took pity on Potter’s heartbreak and his so-called bravery in rescuing two people from the lake. Of course when he was thriving that Potter's love life was in a worse state than his that Potter must cover it up with his positive news to maintain his overinflated ego.
have an experience with a dating ritual, he suddenly remembered. He received that love note last year which was completely new for him. That was a change. Someone liked him, absolutely someone did. Or someone still does. He never did find the one who sent it…
What's happening to him? Sleepwalking? Did the future start taking matters into its own hands? Is he no longer in control over his
“Maybe that cat should eat it,” Terry said as he pulled his nightshirt over his head. “To put it out of his misery.”
“She’s wrong, you know.” Draco noticed that Harry didn’t relax. “She doesn’t know anything about this world, about our world. She can never understand. She’s only a muggle.” Draco wanted to say something dumb, like how he thought Harry was extraordinary and had the memories to back it up. But that sounded too weird from the mouth of a friend.
Draco couldn't help the smile he had at the Christmas dinner. Draco would talk to Michael (Terry and Anthony went home) and other Ravenclaws. Laughing at jokes, friendly jostling, open smiles.
"What?" Ron pointed down the breakfast table and Harry could barely see Colin Creevey around the students. Still, he saw him, Draco standing behind where he was seated. They were leaning very close to one another, no doubt talking in hushed voices. He could see Colin shaking his head, but Draco seemed to be trying to reason with him. Harry saw Draco give him a pleading look that caused something vile to course through Harry's system. Draco said something else, and Colin closed his mouth. Finally, Colin seemed to agree with whatever Draco was saying with a tired nod. Harry was shocked that he saw Draco giving him a quick hug.
He continued muttering as he left the dormitory, none the wiser that Draco was within his four-poster bed.
”but I know that the Slytherin Common Room is down in the dungeons, the entrance is a blank stone wall and the password’s..." Draco paused for a moment. "‘Pureblood.’”
"Yeah, I just came back from the library and he was standing outside. He couldn't get in." the corners of Draco's mouth twitched.
“I mean all you do is sleep nowadays,” Michael reasoned. Harry, Weasley and Granger also stood by him as well.
Harry! I knew that something was wrong with Moody but I couldn’t see. And my father helped him return! On my behalf—“
Gabrielle, Cho, and Mrs. Krum seemed very pleased at the admission but Draco wished Dumbledore would
Draco raised an eyebrow. “You don’t blame me? Really?” He glanced over at Harry who turned back to Ron’s hand. “All of you?”
“Really?” Draco was still surprised. Snape was a nightmare but he said (though not openly) he wouldn’t be so hard on Harry and those around him.
“Yep,” Terry fluffed his pillow. “Train rides have always been for naps and I’m over having my neck be sore afterwards.” He shuffled himself into a sleeping position. “Don’t be too loud and wake me up when the Trolley Witch comes around.”
Yes, he would’ve. He did. “I have to talk to him anyway.” Even after making up with his father, Lucius said that the complaint was already too far in process to void even for him.
a Death Eater. He said my father was doing this on my behalf. That our family would be spared if he did what he was told but it’s
The world around him got enveloped with dark, his hearing got plugged, his blood felt like ice. His father helped Voldemort come back.
Ted tried to show Draco popular ‘films’ at home with VHS tapes but Draco got distracted at the shiny, smooth strips he could pull at. (He wasn’t allowed near the VHSs again.)
“Of all the things Potter could’ve done this is by far the most...” Draco heard Anthony sigh and click his tongue. “He must’ve done something that really unsettled Draco. I just don’t know what could make him that upset. He’s so secretive about the important things.” There was a groan. “Arg! Every time I think I’m starting to understand him, I always end up going back to square one.”
Harry was a human version of a house-elf. It was insane that he used to think that Harry used to roll around in lush carpets and pranced around a large mansion like himself. It was a stupid way of thinking. Now he didn’t know how to even respond. Sorry, that happened? That’s messed up? It’ll look up, don’t worry? There isn’t a proper response to your friend that has lived a life that didn’t sound like it was technically legal in any sense. How do you go not knowing anything like magic for your whole life?
One day, someone is going to pull his shoulder out of its socket from all the arm pulling. For the what seems like the millionth time, he was pulled into an empty classroom.
“You know, this sounds like my cue to leave, I’m going to see if I can sneak in a few minutes of lunch. Bye, Harry.”
"I'm going to get cleaned up," Ron said suddenly, scratching at a track of dried mud on his face. He and Harry walked over to the door as Lockhart nodded obediently at McGonagall's whispering.
“...And then Hagrid came and told me that I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday. After he gave Dudley a pig’s tail, I was then taken away and went to Diagon Alley to get school supplies. And I met… you. That’s as much as you missed.”
Harry felt at peace on that train ride. Letting himself talk about things he liked about Draco until they arrived at King's Cross. But now, this is the third time Ron has pointed into the busy crowd in Diagon Alley and questioned "Draco?" causing Harry reach up to his hair to pat it down as he looked around expectedly.
Draco's name sounded displaced in Riddle's voice. "Doesn't this seem familiar? I, offering you my compassion and for you to choose me, you, thinking you're too good for me, that you're
Fleur frowned and searched around. “Oh! I zink I see her. Zat is her, right?” She pointed a finger up at the top of the stairs.
"Is there something you want to tell me, Draco?" Dumbledore asked and he felt himself stiffen. Draco didn't say anything aloud, right?
Draco burst from the tent flap and nearly cried in relief at the sight of Harry who was alone, glaring at his leather bracers he fastened to his forearms.
that--” Draco bit the inside of his cheek. Why can’t one thing that changes in this timeline make sense? “Nevermind.” Draco wanted to put his face in his hands. “It’s not important anymore.”
“The Second Task is champions rescuing something very important to them from the bottom of the Black Lake."
Michael would be with his father. There was a very little chance that he managed to get gravely injured. He would have to write a letter as soon as possible.
Fourth year was the tipping point. It was when everything took a turn for the worst and began the most terrible years of Draco’s life. But he could make things better. Cedric Diggory doesn’t have to die by the Dark Lord. He could save a life. No mistakes could be made. And he isn’t going to make any.
"Okay. Okay, I won't." Skinny arms went around him. Instead of pushing away, like he would in a regular situation, he leaned into Harry's touch. Draco moved up so his face was no longer in Harry’s chest, but his neck. The scent of sunlight came off of Harry and it made him curl even closer to Harry. How was that even possible?
“Oi, Draco, go see if Potter’s still kicking.” Michael pushed Draco down the row, almost crashing into Luna Lovegood.
"And it's not like he got Hufflepuff or Gryffindor. Merlin, forbid. In the compartment, you didn't see Harry Potter get out as well?" His mother's voice was light, they way she talked to house guest she hated. Lucius didn't speak for a very long time. He seemed to be thinking about something long and hard... "Draco, explain how you are not friends with the Weasley and instead friends with Harry Potter."
The lantern did little to light that way towards the fallen tree trunk that he and Harry have taken to sitting at, but when he neared he saw the rounded glow of an illuminated wand.
“Ye seem to be getting worse.” Hagrid put his free hand against his forehead and he almost fell backward.
Lupin hurriedly excused him and told Michael and Terry to take him back to the castle so that he could rest.
"Right, I didn’t tell you about him. He’s this house-elf that watched over me during the summer. He’d be there all day and blocked all my letters.”
“And anyway how would you know anything about the problems a person like Nil has?” The blond boy frowned.
Harry seemed to look around the area, trying to find them but the crowd was too immense. Without warning, the Hungarian Horntail shrieked and pounced at the boy. Harry scuffled around the area, breaking away brittle rocks as he crawled over away from the Horntail’s spiked tail.
Professor Flickwick fainted, Professor Sprout hurriedly went down to his side. Snape seemed to stagger, gripping on the back of a chair so tight that his knuckles went white, his face carefully blank. Madam Hooch grabbed him to steady his sense of gravity.
Draco turned back out to see the sun beginning to set over the seemingly shrunken Muggle neighbourhood.
The Minister walked out after minutes passed, his listening party following right after him. Draco looked up from his fingers. Madam Rosmerta was the last to leave the room, wiping under her eyes as she let the door swing closed, hurrying over to wait on tables.
Draco glanced up at the sky hesitantly. “It’s beautiful. But why are we out here? Is something wrong?”
“That’s nice, dear.” She said pleasantly. Lucius didn’t say anything, despite looking like he wanted to. Nothing was spoken after that.
"Mr. Potter," Ron stood next to Harry like he was ready to receive punishment. "Mr. Weasely." Snape seemed to have trouble forming the words he was going to say. "Thank you, for your acts to save Mr. Malfoy." Lockhart walked up beside Snape, clapping a hand on his shoulder.
“Right… you liked Hermione,” Draco said. A mortifying memory of him pacing the Slytherin Common Room in a rage because
Draco honestly didn’t know what he was expecting. Despite already knowing, actually hearing that Snape helped Harry and Sirius from someone else felt surreal.
Draco silently freaked. Was he about to go to the first meeting of this organization that he could never find before? One that had him hanging around people like Filch and never could find it on his own?
haven't yet. Yes, you're right, you cannot change the past, but Draco," Narcissa looked down at her lap. "the future is still untold."
Creevey swung open the portrait and dashed down the stairs moments later, a giant muggle camera in his grip. He said goodbye aloud as he ran down the stairs.
"Don't worry, mate." Ron suddenly punched Draco's arm. "Me and Hermione are here to balance it out." Ever since Anthony, Terry, and Michael discovered a friendship with Ron and Hermione, they had no problems hanging together in a big group. (Whether it was a good or bad thing was still up for debate.)
A rush of confused annoyance boiled within Fletcher and he hurried up to trail after the blond. “Er, hello?
I would like to thank all of your most precious comments! They honestly make my day and I can’t ask for a more sweeter audience!
different…”). She gave him cassette tapes claiming to fit his mood ("You can never go wrong with some Weird Sisters."), and books to distract him ("I know you love those Muggle teen romances that are leftovers from me. Don't look so surprised, cousin.").
“We have each other's back right?” Draco smiled again, knocking his shoulder. “I thought it couldn’t be all that bad knowing that you’ll help me.”
Potter looked as if he was punched. For a brief moment, his face was devastated before it twisted into fury.
Filling up with rising confusion, he did was he was asked and hurried to follow. As he followed, he tried to look over the "neighbourhood."
He knew he couldn't keep all the secrets to himself. He needed—wanted—to tell someone. If it was going to be anyone, it would be Dumbledore.
know?” Weasley whispered since Madam Pince leaned back from her post to see past the bookshelves and give Weasley a disapproving glare.
best friend. Hermione thought of it as romantic and made Harry swear that he'd go and talk to her if he 'needed advice'. Ron pledged to "help in any way he can". Both ideas sounded terrible to him.
"Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost his." Her voice held a bossy tone even at this young age and it took ever fiber in Draco's body not to laugh at it.
"Draco!" Seriously, no one ever called him this much. Just as expected, it was Potter hiding behind a suit of armor, calling for him.
They watched as Cedric cleanly transfigured a rock to a bouncing dog to distract the dragon. Draco leaned forward when the dragon quickly lost interest and neared Cedric enough to burn half his face, but he nonetheless captured the golden egg. There was a special interest from the crowd for Fleur’s turn. Her turned ended swiftly with a quick sleeping charm with only a mild accident of setting her tunic on fire. Michael held up a banner proudly displaying Viktor Krum’s name as the boy stepped out.
"Harry, my family is one of the oldest in the Wizarding world. They were all in Slytherin, all of them. My Sorting was a very big deal to my father. Merlin, I don't know how he reacted." Draco rubbed his forearms. He
“I recognized her,” Harry said when he sat down. “She was at Sirius’ retrial. She was one who tried to oppose the removal of Sirius’ charges.”
As the last girl dashed over to the Hufflepuff table, Dumbledore rose from his seat. He held up his hands for complete silence.
He shook his head. “It’s alright, professor. I’m just really glad to be back here for another year. “
In a dim, unused corridor, he let himself slid down the wall and tuck his legs to his chest to hide his face. He took deep breaths to try to stop his chest from bursting from the inside, his throat felt tight, and he could feel himself shuddering under the tight grip of his hands.
Did Moody know Harry could be chosen by the goblet? How would Moody know? Did he know the person that did it? Did
” She hissed at him before turning back to Harry and Ron. “It’s why he always knew everything. Because he already saw it. He was
“Pfft, yeah, I know!” Michael grabbed the mirror to set it down and pulled at Draco’s arm again. “Now, come on! Let’s look around the place! I bet we can find all sorts of people here!”
“You can’t actually mean that.” Terry’s said quietly. “Potter’s your friend. Not being on speaking terms has never happened between you two. You don’t hate him.”
Draco walked into the kitchen one morning to see a new picture tacked onto the fridge. A girl with spiky hair was winking at the camera while Mad-Eye Moody grimaced, seeming to try to pose seriously.
“What brings you here, Potter?” Michael asked, leaning back and crossing his arms in an attempt to look cool. He flipped his bangs in a dramatic flair.
Hagrid talked through the basic introduction of hippogriffs. He carefully repeated all necessary precautions and how they
Michael jumped up for his Snitch which flew up higher in response. “Spending time with Potter, of course.”
"True." He pushed his bangs out of his eyes just for them to got back in place, letting out a breath he didn't know he was holding in. "Something is up with me. I need your help. It's about—"
“You couldn’t hurt those people, Draco. I believe that you didn’t attack those people," she said. “But who ever listens to Looney Lovegood?” As if he didn’t already feel like a prick, now she had to go and say what he called her in his mind since he heard the name Lovegood. “Let me do this for you.”
When Dumbledore rose to give the Welcoming speech, his eyes drifted to Snape, who was staring at him intently. Draco's eyes didn't linger there long and they soon landed on Professor Quirrell. Draco winced painfully.
The meeting was bumpy and full of contradictions. Sirius seemed to attempt to talk about an object that the Order has hidden, but Mrs Weasley would make the conversation cut short. With the vague descriptions of updates and repeating rejections of letting any of the younger people in the room join the Order, Draco found the meeting pointless as Order members began saying closing remarks.
“I actually did it. I admitted my feelings. After, like, three years, I finally did it. Crazy, right?”
"Without you, we probably never figure out who Flamel was!" she gushed. Draco looked at the two behind her for an explanation.
Instead of answering, Harry jerkingly pointed his gaze to the sky. “It’s—It’s a pretty night, isn’t it?”
Draco felt himself tip his chin upward to show his dignity. “Yes, Mother, I’ll be careful. You can trust me.” He liked that his parents have taken a more... ‘emotional investment’ in him after the Chamber of Secrets Incident, but the coddling had to stop.
Neat, curly handwriting appeared over his vanishing spidery writing. He scrapped his chair in an attempt to put distance between them.
“Come on,” Tonks urged Cedric up. “There’s more important things happening than some measly tournament. Cousin, help him sit down over there.”
Anthony sighed heavily, shook his head, and reopened his textbook. (His attempts at conversation were getting shorter and shorter with each passing week.)
Draco was returning to Ravenclaw Tower from a trip to the library (returning books about time spectrum and the basics for Arithmancy). The term was winding down, everyone had higher spirits and everyone was put at ease with the pass of final exams, now using their time to go outside, laying across the fields.
Harry, surprisingly, didn’t raise up to the same hackles. “They’re not. They’re students just like us. Aren’t they supposed to our opponents anyway?”
“Are you saying that you've been pretending this entire time? They you’re not Michael’s best friend, or Terry’s, or
Draco's nerves made him stumble a little harder as he and Tonks landed in front of Grimmauld Place. He stared up at the townhouse and felt like it was looming over him.
Harry was occupied with grumbling to himself, pulling at his shirt sticking to his stomach. He crouched down to pick up his emptied bucket by the handle.
Draco’s body felt like lead. It was so ridiculous. He was Harry’s... He shouldn’t be. Why was he? Why couldn’t he wrap his head around anything?
“But there has to be a reason!” Hermione insisted. “Black must know that Harry’s in Gryffindor and if he’s after him…” She shook her head. “Maybe there’s something that’s only in the Ravenclaw Tower. An object that Black could’ve hidden back in his days at Hogwarts or an heirloom of some kind.”
“How can he betray their trust like that? He was my dad’s best friend… he’s my--just, why?” Harry asked.
The dread of second year hit him halfway through the summer. How could he forget what happened? The Chamber of Secrets was opened. Students getting petrified... professors breathing down everyone's necks. The first time around was awful enough, now he must endure it again and closer to Gryffindors that surrounded the whole thing?
Fleur smiled at him and Gabrielle before breaking off from them to step inside the Age Line, effortlessly passing through. She took a deep breath and held out her parchment to be eaten by the flames. With a giddy smile, she hurried back to Draco and Gabrielle. “See you later!” She waved, looping her arm back through her sister’s and leaving.
Draco would much rather wake up in his bed and be seventeen again, Dark Mark and all, than be walking to the train station for his "first year" at Hogwarts. His father was pushing his trolley to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, wearing high-end Muggle clothes along with Narcissa, distaste stuck on his face at the feeling of cotton than silky robes. Draco was perfectly content, wearing a large jumper and denims (sneaked in by Dobby).
A lifeless tree trunk that was toppled over and there were hushed sounds of someone trying to keep in their crying quiet. Draco walked slowly to the tree trunk before kneeling in front of the crying sounds.
“I didn’t know what was going to happen when I spoke to you that first time,” Anthony finally said. “I’d never talked to someone before. Terry and Michael started to talk to me first. I didn’t even know what to start with. I just… decided. I mean…. you’re not supposed to know how it plays out. You can make fantasies, you can have your prophecies or visions, but you can’t prepare yourself for this. It’s...
It took a lot of convincing for Draco to go to Moody’s classes. Ever since his family’s history was publicized to the entire class, Draco had very little incentive to continue going but it felt pointless to be holed up in his dormitory for an hour. Moody just finished a caution story about ghouls when class was deemed over. As the students filed out, Draco steeled himself and walked up to the front of the classroom.
"Found it 'n the snow," Hagrid gruffed. "Seemed to be out there fer a while." He looked down at the dead rooster. "Second one I found. It’s either foxes or somethin’. I need to ask if I can charm the coop. Wait a minute!" Hagrid suddenly said. "Why aren't ye in class?"
A sharp, insane smile grew on Tom Riddle's face. A half-hearted chuckle slipped from his mouth, then another came, and another until he was howling with manic laughter.
"I think you can, Terry," Anthony responded, an accusing tone colouring his voice. Micheal pointed a finger at Anthony as if he was on to something. "You know very well what drove Harry Potter to save Draco."
like you. And it… scared me. That you would like me. There were so many things that made me run that night. I thought I wasn’t allowed to like you, how you weren't supposed to like me. You are everything I strived to be better…” Draco glanced at his image on the tapestry. “But I thought I wasn’t good enough. And then I thought that I couldn’t do this without seeing how it all turned out in the end. But, Harry, I really like you. And I know that you’re probably over me—“
"We can't leave," Harry said, he went inside and saw a wardrobe to his left. "Hide in here." They scrambled inside just as the sound of student's footsteps rumbled above them, and the room's door slammed opened; Harry could see teacher's robes pouring in. Harry could make out McGonagall's green robes. The lounge door squeaked as she closed it.
“What? No—I just mean—who sent it?” Harry was fumbling with his words. Harry stopped looking at the letter and finally realised the puddle of ink his bag was making and set it down on the floor to repack. As Harry took out the dripping textbooks and quills, Draco finally felt pity and started helping him.
“It’s not your fault,” Draco waved a hand, trying to not let the admission sour his mood. He pinned up a smile. “We'll tell the others about dinner.”
“But is it not Lucius' fault that you're placed in this predicament? What was he thinking of doing something so dangerous?!”
been better. He has changed, he opened himself up, reformed into a new person, a more likeable person. They had no idea on how he was in the past and they never will. God, what was the entire
“Everyone, today we’re going to be doing something a little more... eccentric.” Professor Vector announced, making students straighten in surprise. “Still within calculated reasoning, of course.” Everyone slumped back down. “Today, we’re going to be looking into the compatibility we have with one another. Now, please turn to page 514 and think of a person who you have a close connection with.” Her dark eyes lowered to a particular Hufflepuff student. “I said page 514, Mr Murphy, thank you.” A piece of chalk rose to the board and began writing. “Now this method uses two particular kinds of words, ‘hates’ and…” the chalk finished the other word in a flourish. “‘Loves.’" There was a ripple of giggles and groans.
“We’re both fine!” Harry said a little too loudly. “I mean—we weren’t hurt,” he said in a lower voice, looking from side to side.
Draco brought his hand up to tuck his hair back only to have it stubbornly go back in its place in his eyes. Harry inwardly groaned. When Draco tried to tuck back his hair it always left Harry's stomach uncomfortably fluttering.
Harry blushed at the compliment. "Really? Because the way I look at a Quidditch game, I seem to go to Hospital Wing after, even during." Harry shifted the books from one arm to another.
Tonks sounded like she didn't think badly about Moody and thought he could never do anything wrong, but Draco couldn't get behind that. There was something more to his distrust than the grudge from some ferret transfiguration. He needed to find the answer.
“Why are you all obsessed with other people’s love lives?” Draco asked. His three friends were worse than middle-aged witches with trashy romance novels.
"Exactly! Thank you, Ron!” Michael crossed his arms. “I’m willing to bet 10 galleons that Bulgaria will win because of him.”
"Well, I guess that can wait till later. We should be grateful that these two risked their life to save your son."
"Dumbledore goes on how the professors are beyond impressed on how advanced his magic is and how he got top marks in his entire year." She went beside Draco and set her hands on the back of his chair.
As he followed Michael downstairs, he was mentally slapping himself. Was he already dreaming about it? Why couldn’t that dream be real then so that he could get it out of the way? Draco didn’t know what it meant to confess. Even within his head, he was a giant pile of nerves. How did Harry manage to do this?
“Harry?” Draco asked to the empty air. The crying noise shuddered and there were more pauses in between of inhaling gasps. Draco reached forward until his fingers met soft material and grasped it to pull it off the other boy. He has never seen Harry Potter cry before.
They were all comforting Granger and defending her as Draco stayed silent. It was the second time this has happened, no, was it the third? He couldn’t remember anymore. It was still so…
“Ron, it’s Harry’s life you’re talking about. You can’t just meddle around it and try to play Cupid.” Hermione admonished.
"It's going to be alright, Hermione." Draco panicked as Hermione looked ready to cry once more. He floundered for a cheerful thought and remembered, "Buckbeak will be fine!" he tried to soothe. Buckbeak escapes, his father told him after when he returned from school and it sent Draco into a tantrum.
He sat up, body sagging from tilted sleep, scrubbing his eyes to remove the after-images of the dream. He looked around his room, the dull light from his lamp post outside creating tall panels of light. He sighed as he laid back down, now fully awake.
He didn’t truly know that status of what positions his parents had with acknowledging their past. But he had to give them enough trust that they were trying to fix themselves as much as he was. His father wanted to be a better father. His mother wanted to be a better sister. They acknowledged it. And they were making amends.
He checked his other hand and saw it was free of any kind of red, but he saw something on his cuff that made his breath get caught in his throat.
"Well, I suppose yes. He has... helped with a few things." Draco tried thinking about first year, but sleep was pulling him back in. He yawned. “Can I go back to sleep?”
“Oh, get your heads out of dragon dung, will you!" Vector snapped. "Love has implications outside of romance, you know.” She cleared her throat. “Now, I want you to write your name you’re thinking about and either put ‘hates’ or ‘loves.’ Then, write your name.”
“Harry Potter better hurry,” Kreacher said before jumping off of Harry’s bed and shuffling out of the room.
“He’s fine, Narcissa,” Lucius said. "Just nerves, though he should not have any.” He directed the last part towards Draco. “Can you at least consider dressing
Draco took a calming breath. "I need to apologise. I was a... idiot." There was a pause. His whole body seemed to reject the idea of himself as an idiot, but he continued. "When I was around you I was quiet, and when I wasn't I was being a jerk for no reason. I'm
Sheets of dense rain made difficult for Draco to even see three feet in front of him, much less players.
An unfamiliar man was seething underneath Tonk’s foot, his eyes wild, his tongue darting out now and then.
“I swear, you’re a strange one even by wizard standards.” Michael shook his head as he reached towards his own copy of The Book of Monsters. (It growled around the thick rope tied around it. When asked about this problem, Hagrid explained that all you have to do is stroke your book’s spine because
“Tell me!” Nil’s weasel-like face got into Draco’s. “Explain to me why do I think like this? Why you always to seem to take my things away from me!” Fletcher pushed Draco down to the ground, grabbing Draco’s coat to haul him forwards. “Who do you think you are, Malfoy? Who do you think I am?”
"You know how much I wanted Slytherin to lose their winning streak? I was gonna rub it all over Goyle's face. Now, I can't do that. So, for the time being: Ignore them." That got a couple of nods from the students next to them. On instinct, he leaned off to the side to see the Gryffindor table. Cold shoulders were giving to the Golden Trio along with Longbottom.
Terry then noticed Potter was leaning forward, aiming for a kiss, but Draco’s face was morphing with rising... horror? He felt the need to call out. He needed to call out and say
“Yeah, I know that we've all been busy with D.A., and I’ve been busy with prefect duties, and Umbridge's overrun the place with her idiotic decrees. I don’t know, I guess I miss you.”
Harry blinked. “I was? Er, I mean, I wasn’t.” He turned away and scratched the back of his head. “I was just…”
“Aw, you’d be lost without me?” Anthony placed a hand on his chest as if humbled. “Wow, how…” He threw his arm around Draco and mussed his hair. “
Draco really did like that note. It was the nicest thing that anyone gave him, cheesy poem and all. It made Draco feel special but in a better way. Not as a vivid time jumper, but special enough to be a person's daydream. Daydreams for the two them to
“It’s Christmas, Young Master Draco! Master requires your attendance if you want to open gifts.” Dobby answered, bowing lowly.
“Harry Potter and some other idiot first years just cost us Gryffindor the House Cup." Terry was shoveling eggs in his mouth straight from the serving dish, not bothering with a plate.
A Hufflepuff student was looking up at the ceiling. His eyes were blank and he was rigid and cold. Draco also noticed the Gryffindor ghost, Nearly Headless Nick, was right beside the Hufflepuff, his transparent body smokey and blacken. A lump appeared in his throat. He was never this close to any of the attacks last time. Never. But here he was, like…
"Of course. Goodnight, Master Draco." with a crack, the blonde let his body fall back onto the bed, not bothering pulling the sheets back over him. When he fell back asleep, it was dreamless.
"It’s something huge—no one but you can probably understand it. It’s about the future—It’s about Harry—I need to tell you now—“
. I grew stronger with each of his deepest, darkest secrets. I became so strong that I started pouring
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything. Otherwise, Dumbledore wouldn't trust you to help with the Stone." she used a sweet voice. Draco tried to push Harry's hand away, but it clamped tighter on his mouth. He shot him a glare; in return, got a red-faced Harry with an apologetic face.
Several people suddenly screamed and Draco saw the school's ghosts float in. One ghost stopped their conversation.
Draco cleared his throat. “No, nothing like that.” He placed the back of his hand against his cheek to feel the warmth, the heat reminding him of how close Harry’s mouth was to his that night. He shook his head. “He didn’t do—that. Nothing like that happened. Tonks, don’t even joke about that.”
“God!” Nil gave a frustrated shout, balling his hands in his hair. The Slytherin boy bowed his head to the ground as he yelled at the ground. “Every time you’re mentioned I suddenly feel like I’m vapour! You're now the rival Harry Potter has to worry about, you’re the one talked about along with Potter and his band of idiots, you’re the crush of the girl
“Were you staring at the Hufflepuff table? Something interesting happening there?” Terry stretched his neck over students’ heads to see.
Terry was sprawled on his bed, hands smothering his face as he groaned. Michael was standing next to his bed holding a letter. “Nooo. She can’t be serious!”
Homework was piled high, much to Harry and Weasley's displeasure. Draco spent most of this time in the library with the three of them. He was helping Harry look up the word "Dittany" he heard Weasley say, "Hagrid! What are you doing in the library?"
Narcissa and Lucius were waiting at the platform, calm and dignified, standing out against the regular witches and wizards trying to reach their children. Draco dropped his suitcase and went to hug his mother, ignoring his father’s rule of waiting until they got home.
Draco could recall rumors passed around Slytherin that Granger was in the same bathroom as the troll and heroic Harry Potter saved her. Maybe he could get her out of the bathroom before the troll came.
“In a Muggle village. Or is it called a suburb? A neighbourhood,” Narcissa said. “Turn in your school trunk so the crest doesn’t show.” She added before taking off down the pavement.
“No, I'm not trying to doubt you! Honestly, you're already doing a lot for me. It's nice enough that I have this warning if anything. But if I do… Then you think I’ll be fine?”
“Fine.” Draco stood up. “I’m going.” The blond’s carefully made his tone sound indifferent. Merlin, why were his eyes doing that?
so… they were always close to one another). He doubted out of all these things he changed drastically, pushing forward a relationship already made to happen wasn’t something severe. He’s going to hate having to leave Viktor Krum without a date. But… Hermione and Ron would be happy together.
“Oh,” Michael muttered, sounding disappointed. He attempted another grab at the Snitch before it zipped towards Terry’s bed who swooped it up with ease.
Harry cleared his throat, shaking his head. "Neither did I, but I had nowhere to go after I... ran away."
"'Right then, guess this is where we part. We'll owl to each other, right? Harry? Draco?" Weasley asked as he pulled down his trunk.
Ron snorted. “That much is obvious.” He looked over at Harry. “I mean Harry was only trying to tell the truth and she gave him detention!”
"Are you familiar with phoenixes, Draco?” A new voice came in the room. Dumbledore was at his office door, a gentle smile twitching his beard upwards. “You do not seem that shocked to see a bird spontaneously combust.”
“He insisted that he wanted to know any time you were placed in the Hospital Wing. I’m sorry, but I can’t go against a parent’s wish.”
“Harry, dear, could you tell Ron and the others that dinner’s running late," Mrs Weasley said, taking up a large spoon.
Anthony furrowed his brow as he unfurled his paper. He gasped as his eyes blew wide. “What the--How does she know?! This was just last night!”
“You think I should open it?” Harry asked Draco. He turned towards the Gryffindors. “Who wants me to open it?” he enthused. Roaring shouts of approval and applause thundered throughout the common room. “Do you want me to open it?” More intensified sounds of approval.
Andromeda exhaled deeply. “I think you can see that Ted is my husband." She gestured around her. "And I think you can see he’s not exactly a pureblood.”
Draco was pacing along the Black Lake shoreline. He kept rubbing his hands together and nibbling at his bottom lip. It feels like he’s been waiting for ages.
After the announcement, there was a similar bias for Cedric than Harry. Fletcher Nil didn't seem to have the creativity of making 'POTTER STINKS' badges, but the presence of Rita Skeeter and her satirical publishings in the
"What are the Beaters doing?" Michael shrieked beside him, violently pulling himself out of his wallowing. “They’re only paying attention to Potter! Play the game!“ He shouted at them.
"You're very odd. Don't take that wrong." Dumbledore saw the look he was given. "That's good, everyone's odd, but you are something a little different. But if you want an excuse, it's your eyes. How are they so old on a face so young? What is your secret?" Dumbledore peered down at him with his half-moon spectacles. "You're very odd, my boy."
Dinner ceased and Dumbledore stated the rules, his twinkling eyes sweeping all over the room before pausing briefly at Draco. He called the night over and students rose from their seats.
“Petrified? The cat was Petrified?” Draco looked down at his hands, his head was hurting all over again.
“Well, tell him to find me before this evening to know how he's going to spend his detention this evening.”
“Hey, hey, is that who I think it is?” Michael made Draco pause as he squinted off into the distance. “Merlin it is.” He cupped his mouth. “OI! WEASLEY! GRANGER! POTTER!” The blond followed Michael’s gaze and saw the backs of the trio.
Tonks hummed doubtfully but knocked on the door all the same. Draco felt equal parts relief and stress that it was Sirius who answered.
“Right.” Harry reached out to Draco’s hands. “I’m… I’m really happy right now. Happiest I've been all year.”
"I knew something was wrong with you." Anthony clicked, finally releasing the blonde, seeming to ignore Harry's introduction. "I'm never doubting myself again. All that spacing out, the silence, the tiredness. What was I
"Be careful, Scabbers is in here. We just left to get him rat tonic. That rat tonic was expensive." A witch and a little girl walked passed them.
“Harry!” Sirius’ voice carried from downstairs. “Are you up? Come down here before breakfast gets cold!”
Draco didn’t know what to say and elected to just let himself stand in Harry’s embrace as he processed the sensations around him. He knows this… he spent the entire summer saying the same thing, yet there was a kick response in the presence of Harry.
The entire kitchen was bustling with movement to get everyone seated, bowls of soup being passed down the table.
“Well, fine, he didn’t say no,” Terry conceded but quickly added on, “But running away isn’t exactly a yes either!”
Draco felt his tense shoulders relax. A logical approach to add to his cumulation of offhand research from the library. It was better than nothing. Maybe he could figure out once and for all why the universe felt so insist on certain events.
Later that night, as Anthony was stifling yawns on his way to the dormitory, Draco pulled himself closer to the table that was set near the windows and crinkled the journal open. He was finally alone, free of any distractions as everyone else went to bed.
"Draco!" Someone was shaking his shoulder. He gasped loudly and flinched away, making the two boys look at him funny. "Are you 'right?" Weasley asked. "You zoned out."
“Draco,” Hermione leaned forward to the blond when the door closed. “Don’t you think that there’s something--something
"Where'd you get that?" he asked. Harry looked down at the cover, surprised to see it dry, unlike his other supplies.
"Lockhart, just the man I needed. A student--my godson, no less--has been taken by a monster. Taken right into the Chamber of Secrets. Lockhart, your chance has finally arrived."
Fletcher's unpracticed smirk turned confused when he glanced at the blond. “Why are you looking at me like that?” Nil demanded. Draco let his face slip back to passive.
Draco cried out and fell out of bed, getting tangled in his bedsheets. His heart banged against his chest, fight or flight adrenaline energising his body into a frenzy. Scabbers squeaky cries sounded from his bedside table. He thought he heard the dormitory door close.
“Because he defeated the Dark Lord as a baby. He probably doesn’t even remember it! Then he has to be a nice and friendly and it just makes me… makes me… sick! But then he was nice to me and then I didn’t feel sick and I was… actually
Draco took a frightened step back. Then, Draco started running. Terry pressed into the alcove as Draco ran past him, fleeing to the bright Great Hall. He turned back to see Potter’s reaction.
Draco, who didn’t want to sit in silence, stood up. “I’m tired. I think I’m going to go to my room for a nap.”
"We're sorry that you have a horrible father," they both said in unison, sarcasm heavy in each of their voices.
“S’all right, you’re okay. Tom’s gone, the diary’s destroyed. Everything is fine.” Draco shook his head as if he was ashamed of himself.
Draco giggled as he pulled the fabric off him and got to work. He managed to cut off the outrageous ruffles, removed the ‘Great Aunt Tessie’ smell, and vanished the antique print pattern on the robes so all that was left was a respectable dark brown.
