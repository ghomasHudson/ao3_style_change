Harry gaped. Nineteen gifts. “It’s too much.”
Draco smiled a soft, tender smile. “I don’t think you’re mad. I’m intrigued, actually.”
“That’s as fast as the stag will go,” Harry calls out.
“Not that I’m aware of.” Harry pulled his hand back and shoved them both into his pockets. This clearly wasn’t going well. He considered going back to the film without the snacks, but Draco’s eyes softened.
. Kreacher is going to murder you.”
Harry’s heart beats faster.
. Harry thought about Hogwarts and its wondrous magic, and about how safe and alive he felt within its walls, despite the obvious irony of numerous attempts on his life over the years. He saw Hagrid’s Hut, the Quidditch Pitch, and his four-poster bed in Gryffindor colours awaiting him when it was all done.
The next time Harry awoke, it was dark outside. Shadows played along his walls, and a pebble bounced off the glass.
“I know.”
Petunia paled, then pursed her lips. Her eyes flashed with anger, and that seemed to sober her.
Harry had rented a luxurious beachfront cabin with a spectacular view. The interior was a fusion of wizarding elegance with Muggle-chic elements (currently avant-garde among the wizarding elite), but in his opinion, the Muggle aspects were overstated. The biscuit tin was a bit much. So was the
“Kreacher has been working on a special menu for this evening. Eight courses of gastronomic delights — warming foods served in a cool environment.”
They visit many rooms with trees ranging from whimsical to verging on gaudy: a tasty gingerbread tree, one magnificently bejewelled, another weighed down by Goblin gold, and a tree with a perpetual snowfall enchantment that reminds Harry of the inside of a snow globe.
It was well into the afternoon before they headed out.
Draco needed answers, and he knew what he’d have to do to get them.
Draco shivers. He checks the windows, but they’re firmly shut. He frowns, realising it’s much brighter than when he usually rises. He casts a
“Do tell me you’re wearing something under that apron.”
She pursed her lips together into a strained half-smile that was more like a grimace.
Draco looked into her eyes, imploring her to trust him. She seemed apprehensive, but also burdened by the past. “It can help to talk about these things. I mean, let’s examine my role. I had this”—he rolled up his sleeve, and she winced. “It burned every time he’d call his followers, and sometimes, when he was angry, he’d press it for fun. A long-distance Cruciatus.
Petunia pulled out another cigarette and used the almost finished one to light it. After taking the time to inhale and exhale, without looking at Harry, she answered. “You know perfectly well why.”
Draco—
After a quick tour of Draco’s flat, they sat shoulder to shoulder on his bed. “Shall we do this?”
on Muggle coasters. His eyes widen when he sees Harry.
“Will you finally come out with us tonight?” Jess asked, tucking a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear. She sat on the counter while Draco restocked the drink cups, arranging them so all the labels faced the front. It was a Friday tradition to go to the pub after the last showing, and to this date, Draco had never joined in. At first, it was because Draco didn’t trust himself to mix alcohol with Muggles. Would he get loose-lipped and accidentally reveal himself as a wizard? But it had been months; he’d acclimated. Perhaps tonight would be the night he finally took the plunge. He nodded.
Briefly, Harry’s eyes opened—completely bloodshot—and he looked right through Draco as though he wasn’t even there. His body trembled, and Draco could feel sparks of Harry’s magic pulsing weakly beneath the surface at irregular intervals.
“I’d relax if you’d stop trying to get yourself killed.”
It loomed over Harry, and he could see his face reflected in each of the eight shiny eyes.
A Malfoy would never willingly give up even an ounce of their magic. But he was Draco, and not Malfoy, and he would do anything to protect the man he loved.
everything went dark.
. You broke your promise.”
—harder!”
As much as it pains him to do so, Harry takes a slow, steadying breath and pulls his gaze upward, away from the tantalising red velvet pants, and focuses on Malfoy’s face. He studies his patrician features: intense grey eyes, straight aristocratic nose, high cheekbones, luscious lips with a perfect cupid’s bow and a plump lower lip that begs to be sucked. Of course, Harry’s looked before, but never for as long as he’s liked for fear of being caught staring. But now he has the perfect excuse; it’s what he’s here to do. He begins his sketch. He’s never done this before, but, like a true Gryffindor, he dives right in. Hermione is already way ahead.
“I love you.”
“I’ve come to see Harry.”
“So let them see,” Harry growls, pushing him back against the wall. “Who’d believe someone saying they saw the two of
Draco, about to exhale in relief, notices the snowdrifts that have formed against the walls.
Harry said something, but his voice was so quiet Draco couldn’t hear. He leaned in closer.
She took a deep breath, as though willing back tears. Quietly she said, “It was his birthday yesterday.” But then the tears fell, rolling down her cheeks, and Draco, caught off guard and unsure what to do, put his arm around her. Granger cried and shook with grief. They must have sat together like that for fifteen minutes, but then she realised where she was and who she was with. She straightened, reached into her purse, and dabbed at her eyes with a tissue.
There’s no response, which doesn’t surprise him. Draco opens the other door leading out into the hallway. Nevermind the bathtub; ice and snow cover every surface of the house. Have the Temperature Control Charms been deactivated? Is the Central Core degrading? Draco shakes his head and mutters expletives under his breath.
Harry mused, “This would be the perfect spot for a picnic.”
“I’m sorry, Draco. You work so hard, and I just wanted to treat you to a nice, relaxing holiday. We’ve had so little time together lately, what with my training schedule and all your overtime.”
It was a fluttering noise, the sound of wings flapping, and a rush of cool air against his cheek that forced his eyes open again. But he wasn’t in the room filled with keys, as he’d expected—he was in his room, with all the things Petunia had carefully chosen for him, bought his affections with. He couldn’t explain the sensation, but the image of an owl popped into his head, which made no sense at all. Weren’t owls nocturnal? He surveyed the room; the window was closed and barred, as expected. No bird could have flown into his room. Except…
It’s not common knowledge, but I happen to know there’s a portrait inside the room. Unfortunately, it’s charmed, so only former Headmasters and Headmistresses may enter. But I’d be willing to bet Dilys Derwent is in there right now, pervy old cow. Not that I’m jealous or anything.
“It’s speeding up,” Draco noted with a pained expression. Harry’s forehead continued to crack and bleed. Hadn’t Petunia heeded his warning?
And there it was. Harry now understood.
Draco sat back down and slowly exhaled. What more was there to say?
Harry took a large bite of eggs and watched as Petunia sat down and served herself a piece of toast. She daintily sipped her tea—the cup was hand-painted with roses and almost always in her hand—then lit a cigarette.
He’s obviously exaggerating.
Draco wraps his arm around Harry’s waist and pulls him closer, he speaks quietly beside Harry’s ear. “When I was little, perhaps seven or eight, Mother said I could decorate this tree any way I wanted. It’s always been the purest white, to represent our Pureblood lineage” — Harry turns his head and rolls his eyes, Draco smiles fondly back — “and I wanted to keep with the theme. I wished and wished, with all my power, and, in what Mother calls
“His magic is powerful,” Draco shouted. “We need to harness it and use it. Three against one.”
“Not Weasel,” a haughty voice drawls. “You missed class. Again.”
They were in the eye of the storm. The windows rattled, photos banged against the wall, and Draco’s papers flew freely about the room, caught in the updraft.
When Draco unfolds his arms, Harry catches a glimpse of the Dark Mark, crosscut by old scars… and a row of fresh cuts. He’s about to say something, ask him about it, but Draco wraps his arms and legs around Harry and pulls him closer.
“That won’t be a problem.” He pulled Draco flush, threading his fingers through his silky hair, and grinding their clothed erections together. There were too many layers between them.
When Harry pulled back, his lips glossy and well-kissed, he said, “I’ve wanted to do that since the moment I first saw you.”
Fourth, he used to sleepwalk. Sometimes he would end up in the garden, and once Vernon found him at the end of Privet Drive at 4 am. That’s why he installed all the locks on his bedroom door—to keep Harry safe. This made Harry feel so loved.
“I’m going to tell you something. Something I should have told you a long time ago.”
; it’s 6:30 pm. He pulls on his winter cloak, picks up the bouquet of Narcissus, and the gold heart-shaped box of dark Belgian chocolates with salted caramel centres. After a quick
Harry stared at it, and something familiar stirred in his gut. But just as quickly, it was gone.
“I don’t know. I—”
“There,” Draco said, as he finished the last stitch. “I’ve transfigured the thread so it will dissolve in three days. Do try not to overexert yourself and undo all my hard work.”
Back at Privet Drive, Petunia suggested more shots. Harry gently guided her away from the drinks cabinet and into the kitchen.
” he sighed.
Malfoy smirks. “Oh, Potter. You most certainly have not been good.”
Despite his inability to remember his past, he had, however, learned several things.
They stood, and Draco cupped Harry’s face as another bolt clicked open.
Petunia sniffed. “Well, you shouldn’t. Your mother was wicked, and the same wickedness runs through him. I can tell.”
“I’m sorry, Draco,” he said and removed his glasses. He opened the bottle, tilted his head back, and placed a drop directly into each eye. It burned, like getting soap in your eye, but became more tolerable after he blinked. He replaced his glasses.
That was something Draco couldn’t fathom. But the hows and whys weren’t important. Harry was alive, for now, and in trouble. Draco needed to focus on that.
Harry missed Draco, but Petunia had no one else. How could he leave when she needed him?
“Not here, someone might see,” Draco says, pushing Harry away.
“Look, they’ve included rose petals for the bath.”
Draco paused, as though considering his response.
The last bolt slid open and Petunia burst into the room. She eyed Draco with vehemence.
Draco shuffles into the adjoining bathroom and performs a Tooth Cleaning Charm. Upon exhaling, he sees his breath, which is unusual. He shrugs and casts a Warming Charm. While examining himself in the mirror, he runs his fingers through his hair but freezes with his hand mid-air. Slowly, he turns around and calls out, “Potter! Why is there snow in our bathtub?”
Hermione smiled. “Nothing. It’s just you’ve come a long way. You’re not the hateful boy you once were back at Hogwarts. I’m proud of you.” She took another sip of wine, the tannins staining her lips. “And to answer your question, it depends on the witch or wizard. Magic, or magical ailments, won’t show up on Muggle diagnostics. It takes magic to detect magic. Non-wizarding medicine will only detect what’s physically apparent, right down to a cellular level. Magic exists essentially on another plane.”
“Harry,” Draco gasped.
“We’ll see about that,” Draco replied. With a whispered
Draco reached out and took the cigarette—almost burned down to the filter—out of Harry’s hand.
Draco’s knee slipped on the vinyl and became wedged between the seat and the gear shift. Harry chuckled, but Draco cut off his laugh with a kiss and took Harry’s cock in hand, rock hard and velvety smooth. The weight of it made Draco’s mouth water. He wanted to taste it, but he didn’t want to stop kissing, and—
15 April 1998
They repeated the incantation, voices raised above the storm, and with each repetition, the void got smaller. After the seventh time, it disappeared completely.
of hooves sounded in the distance, and through the dense fog of colours, Harry noticed four figures walking close beside him. He couldn’t see their faces, but he wasn’t afraid—quite the opposite. He drew comfort from their presence, and they radiated warmth, love, and protection in shades of scarlet, carmine, and deep wine red. Harry held a small stone in his hand, dense with smooth edges, but every time he tried to look at it, his forehead burned. There was something he needed to do. Something he had to remember. But it felt elusive, like a forgotten turn of phrase.
They go up the back staircase to a large purple room Harry’s never been to before.
. Harry smiled, hearing the words again in Draco’s posh accent. He decided he liked it better this way too.
“Harry can’t come to the phone.”
“You are a child,” Draco mutters while he grasps the skates. He sits down to put them on, and they magically adjust to the perfect fit. He stands on wobbly legs and Harry offers him his hand, which he gratefully accepts.
When they reached their cabin, Draco held open the door.
“Potter! You’re skating on 400-year-old ebony flooring! It’s extremely rare and expensive… and damages easily.” He cringes as Teddy gouges at the ice with his skate.
Draco arrived home from his shift—Sundays meant just a matinee—to the sound of wings flapping. Artemis perched on the kitchen chair and preened her feathers innocently. Draco searched for the open window, but they were all closed, as he had left them. He raised an eyebrow.
Petunia pressed her lips together and narrowed her eyes. Surrounded by shades of pink and cranberry, she reminded him of that hideous cow Umbridge. Draco’s lip curled in disgust as he remembered serving the vile creature. Was this an inquisition?
Draco leapt into action and steadied Harry, wrapping Harry’s arm around his neck and shoulder as he half-carried, half-dragged him to the bedroom. He flopped Harry onto the bed and wiped the blood from his nose. He tapped his cheek twice. Three times. His head was hot to the touch, but further examination found his hands and feet icy cold.
Thick, muscular thighs grip the broom—a Nimbus 3050—as he banks right to avoid a Bludger. Callused hands with hairy knuckles keep a firm hold on the shaft. He veers left, barely avoiding the opposing team’s Chaser. He sees it, a hint of gold, and plummets full speed, chasing down the elusive gold speck. The ground rushes up. At the last possible second, he pulls out. The crowd, a swirling mass of blue and bronze, remains silent. Until he opens his hand. The uproar, instantaneous and deafening.
“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” she replies innocently and busies herself adjusting her tidy row of pencils.
When Harry woke up, he felt like hell. His body ached and his forehead throbbed. He wished he were still at Draco’s, nuzzled against his neck, safely wrapped up in his arms. But he had been right to hurry home; Petunia had been beside herself with worry. Understandably, it upset her he hadn’t left a note, but it wasn’t like he planned to sleepwalk. She forgave him easily, though, made him toast with marmalade, and asked him what had happened. She kept asking for specific details, and truthfully Harry couldn’t recall much. He knew he’d experienced a bad acid trip—cloaked figures, mist, a giant spider—but he couldn’t tell Petunia about that. Instead, he told her what he could remember: Draco had taken care of him, performed some New Age healing technique with a red light, and Harry tingled with energy afterwards. Harry was relieved that she wasn’t too angry. In fact, she seemed pleased. As soon as he’d finished eating, she’d sent him up to bed with instructions to take a nice, long nap.
He took three deep breaths, then decided sleep was unlikely. There was only one thing for it. He rolled out of bed and prised up the floorboard. He now knew the bottle contained LSD. After placing a drop of liquid on his tongue, he laid back in bed and waited. Perhaps exhaustion and elation sped up the process because it all happened so fast. Power surged down his arms, extending to his fingers where it prickled like tiny explosions, and for a brief moment, he thought the lights flickered. But it didn’t happen again. Harry could understand how some people might think they had superpowers or were invincible, but he knew better.
Draco smirks and casts his Patronus. A silver dragon springs forth, looking every bit like a moving ice sculpture. It swoops down and pushes Teddy along, its wings beating with power and grace. “Weeeee!” Teddy calls out as his hair lengthens and turns platinum.
Draco smiled and busied himself with setting up their picnic. He’d brought elderflower cordial and an assortment of finger sandwiches: curried egg salad, cucumber with cream cheese and dill, and chicken with cranberry, watercress and dijon mustard.
Harry says nothing, then sighs. Why won’t Malfoy just leave?
Draco caught him and pulled him against his body. “I’m afraid you don’t have a choice, love.”
Harry exhaled. “No, it’s excellent. It always is.” He guided his cock back to Draco’s hot, wet mouth.
Harry smiled. “I’m fine. Really. Now come here.” He went to unzip Draco’s trousers, but stopped stock-still when he caught sight of Draco’s chest—gashed and bloodied. In shock and horror, Harry swiftly undid his buttons. Draco’s chest was pale and unmarred. Harry exhaled quietly. He was losing his mind. There was no other explanation.
“What’s he saying?” Hermione asked.
“It stings.” Fire flared through Harry’s left shoulder, worse than the bludger he’d taken last month.
Draco looked surprised, but he gave a slight nod.
“Harry!” Hermione’s hiss snaps him out of his fantasy, and he finds himself staring into piercing grey eyes. He quickly glances down at his page while she chides, “Class ends in ten minutes and you’ve drawn nothing in the last five. Focus. Your drawing needs legs.”
. His eyes moved over the words, but he couldn’t absorb the information. He closed the book with a snap.
The silence extended indefinitely, punctuated only by the hiss of steam and the swirling of the mist, and when Harry couldn’t stand it anymore, he said, “Who are you?”
With shaky hands, Draco unfolded and read the letter. Harry had woken up early, and Draco was sleeping so peacefully Harry hadn’t wanted to disturb him. He hadn’t told Petunia he was going out, and knew she must be out of her mind with worry. So, he slipped out and planned to take the train home. He said he’d be in touch later and signed the letter ♡H.
Not his mother, then.
The bird continued to groom her plumage. Draco sighed. There was no letter to add to the pile, but he saw a very old book on the table, familiar, leather-bound, from the Malfoy library.
set to end the spell after ten minutes—Slytherin to the core, he had a modicum of self-preservation.
Petunia smiled sweetly as she watched Harry leave. Once he’d reached the staircase, his footsteps muffled by the carpeted runner, her demeanour shifted from falsely chipper to icy cold.
Harry turned his attention to Petunia, and she forced a smile.
“Well, I thought you might like to see today’s edition.”
He picked up his snacks, his change, and returned to the film. As he opened the door, he glanced back. Draco was still staring at him. With a parting wink, Harry disappeared through the door.
thing to do.”
Draco eventually recognised that his family were on the Wrong Side and following a madman. But it took Potter’s death to realise there was no Right Side. The so-called Light Side used Potter for their own purposes. They sent a seventeen-year-old into battle to fight their war, all because of a stupid prophecy. Cowards, that’s what they were. Everyone had blood on their hands. The wizarding world was filled with users and manipulators. So, Draco did the only thing that made sense: he removed himself from the equation entirely.
. The name formed on his lips, but he didn’t say it aloud.
. I’ve seen you before. At King’s Cross Station, at the”—she looked over her shoulder to ensure they were still alone—“barrier to the
“We need to finish this now,” Draco shouted.
“I’ve been studying Muggle medicine,” he said. “I hope to start school next year to become a doctor, but I’ve already started reading ahead. I have some questions about magical ailments and Muggle medicine. Since you grew up Muggle, I thought you might be able to offer insight.”
“Are you absolutely certain?”
When Harry came back, he placed a small kiss on Petunia’s cheek. He handed her a glass of water and the requested pill, which she popped into her mouth and carefully swallowed. The tenderness between them made Draco think of his mother, and a tightness formed in his chest. He swallowed down the lump in his throat. He couldn’t trust her, but he missed her all the same.
Dumbledore’s words echoed in Harry’s head. Harry didn’t understand the images as they flashed before him. Hogwarts was home. His friends were home. Not Privet Drive, with its locks on doors and the cupboard under the stairs; with his irritable, beefy uncle and bony, horse-faced aunt.
“Thank you… Hermione.”
The last page contained a photo of teenaged Dudley in his school uniform. Harry was just about to close the book and accept defeat when he noticed another photo peeking out from behind. He carefully pulled it out and his breath caught in his throat. This was an older photo of two young women, barely any older than Dudley had been in the last one. One had wavy brown hair, Petunia, and the other had striking auburn hair. It was a younger version of the woman in Harry’s vision. Harry’s heart raced. This was his mother—he knew it with every cell in his body. Which meant that there had to be some truth, memories, mixed in with the hallucinations. He wondered—
The Dark Lord’s new wand, peculiar and knobby, arched through the air. Hermione, with reflexes a Seeker would envy, stretched out her hand and caught it. The surprise on the Dark Lord’s face was clear—how dare a Muggle-born disarm a wizard of his stature? In fact, he was too shocked to notice the flash of silver immediately to his right. Longbottom swung the sword and severed the Dark Lord’s head, just as he’d dispatched the snake.
“Both.”
Harry smacked his hand against the door. “He’s not a friend. I love him.”
He must have heard, Goldstein is sitting right in front, but Malfoy’s face remains unaffected. Frozen. Bored. As much as it pains him to agree with anything Goldstein has to say, Harry finds he does. Very much so. He wonders if he’ll be able to look Malfoy in the eye the next time they work together; he knows his mind will always return to this class, to the blazing red Santa outfit. He’s not sure whether Hermione ought to be thanked or killed.
I had lunch with Marjorie Polkiss today. It’s been so long since we’ve seen one another. They’ve just come back from their summer holiday in Majorca. She told me, in hushed tones, that Piers came out to her last month. I never would have guessed. But it makes me wonder… Could this be the answer to my prayers? He would be a better match for Harrykins. He’s hard-working, easy on the eyes, and he’s
— and suddenly they are coming at him full speed. Draco tenses and awaits the inevitable collision, but it never comes. Instead, Harry makes a quick stop, showering Draco’s legs in snow.
“What do you think?” he asked in clipped tones.
“Of course she did.” Draco examined the brochure. “Did you read the fine print? This part here, on the bottom.”
“You know what I want,” Draco purrs, infuriatingly self-assured. A jolt of arousal pulses through Harry.
Draco no longer considered himself the Malfoy heir—he didn’t want that life.
Draco kisses Harry fiercely, touching and grabbing, as Harry slowly works himself up and down. Draco slides down in the chair, using his increased leverage as he grabs Harry’s arse, gives it a firm spank, then spreads his cheeks apart, making each thrust feel more intense. The aged leather squeaks with each movement, filling the room with the sounds of their coupling.
Harry knew he spoke the truth. Draco was a man with secrets so dark he could barely face them himself, and Harry realised perhaps he could confide in him without judgement.
Draco didn’t know what expression he wore, but Harry stopped talking and stared at him.
“Because we’re engaged. Because you love me.”
in this house or around Harry. No talk of magic or Hogwarts or witches or wizards. Do I make myself clear?”
“Your uncle was a good man. What they did to him… It wasn’t fair what happened.”
Draco picked Harry up and carried him over to the kitchen worktop, setting him down gently and reclaiming his lips. Harry wrapped his legs around Draco, his erection straining madly against his apron—he needed more friction. Of course, Draco pulled back. He glanced at the oven, his expression smug.
Draco tossed his head back, his features soft in the early morning light, and he bit his lower lip. Harry loved him like this: uninhibited, unwound, and so fucking sexy. Harry grabbed Draco’s hips, hard enough to bruise, and thrust up while he pulled Draco down hard. A lock of platinum hair fell across Draco’s face and his plump lips parted as he gasped, “
“Evening, Hermione,” Draco called out over Harry’s shoulder.
“What? You don’t think so?”
“Take that, you little freak!” It was a boy’s voice. The stomping came again, pounding from above, reverberating around the small, enclosed space.
And, well, Draco couldn’t say no to that.
“I’m sure the pleasure is all mine,” she said, her voice falsely saccharine. “Would you care for some tea?”
Just like the day of their picnic, there was a moment when Harry’s head pulsed with pain. It subsided just as quickly, and he reassured Draco everything was fine. But Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it. He leafed through another book,
“Then maybe you remind me of someone I knew. Perhaps someone I cared for.”
Draco gasped in disbelief. The Elder Wand, the Deathstick, was real. Hermione Granger was the owner of the most powerful and feared wand in all of history!
More than one, apparently, by the amount of broken glass.
She looked at Draco, and he could see the emotions flash across her face, wanting to talk, uncertain if she should. Having decided, she cleared her throat.
Harry must have slept—the clock read 12:15 pm—but he felt no more rested. All at once, a sense of urgency overcame him—the desire to remember burned. He knew he shouldn’t do it. He’d used it last night and ended up sleepwalking. But his forehead throbbed, and when he closed his eyes, he saw the swirling vortex from his nightmares. What did it mean? He needed to remember, and he knew from his numerous failed attempts that meditation wouldn’t help.
, although the Dementor’s kiss didn’t actually kill you, but it might as well. Draco shuddered as he remembered the Dark Lord commanding the evil horde to do his bidding. Nope. Draco would rather think about the Kiss of Life. Or just kissing in general.
“Harry, what’s wrong?”
Harry smiled as Draco sauntered in, crowding against Harry, pressing a kiss to the back of his neck.
She was completely off her nut.
Harry’s head swirled with new information. King’s Cross Station, shrouded in mist, flickered in and out of existence. Dumbledore, dressed in shimmery silver robes, half-moon spectacles perched halfway down his crooked nose, stood to Harry’s right patiently observing. To Harry’s left, a train appeared, sleek and robust. Steam rose from the engine with a hiss, followed by a loud whistle. As if in response, the fog billowed around them, closing inward, making Harry uneasy. He swallowed hard.
Hermione remained quiet for a moment. She sighed. “Let’s hear it, then.”
Neville boldly stepped forward. Who knew he had it in him? The Dark Lord certainly didn’t. He sneered, made a joke, and put the Sorting Hat on Neville’s head. He made a show of setting it ablaze, threw back his head, and laughed. But his laughter ended abruptly—Longbottom pulled the sword of Godric Gryffindor from the hat; the ruby glimmered from the hilt. Draco watched in awe as the blade made a graceful arc through the air and sliced Nagini’s head clean off.
might resurface, but it seemed less likely with each day that passed.
After a moment she said, “It didn’t work out. Bad timing. After the war, with Fred and Harry gone… My parents…” The silence stretched between them; then she dabbed her mouth with her napkin. “There’s this expression. They say that misery loves company. But, sometimes too much misery is really just—”
Harry cupped Draco’s cheek, placed a gentle kiss on his lips, and massaged his furrowed brow. “Relax, love. We’re on vacation.”
“I want to see exactly what you see,” Draco whispered.
. His kind were headed to war, and they said we might be in danger. Foolishly, Vernon and I listened. But we did it for Dudders; we’d do anything to keep our sweet boy safe. We remained there for months, watched over day and night like common prisoners, being taunted by those
“Morning,” Harry said, soft and sleepy.
Harry is next. He gets into a car… The Malfoy boy’s car. I can’t see his face, but I see blond hair through the window. They drive away, and I’m left all alone.
Draco had been doing perfectly fine, successfully navigating a life amongst the Muggles. He had even decided it was time to join his coworkers at the pub, like a normal member of society. And then Potter had come back into the mix, making him question everything. Turning his back on the wizarding world was supposed to make Draco’s life simpler, easier—trust Potter to complicate matters. Draco gave his apologies to Jess, picked up a curry, and hurried home.
—was willing and needy, all but begging for it.
Harry smiled, his dimple on display, and kissed Draco.
Harry showered, then combed his hair so it covered his forehead. He didn’t know why, but he didn’t want Petunia to see the mark. He told himself it was because she’d worry, but deep down he knew there was another reason. One he couldn’t even begin to fathom.
,” he seethed. Harry’s forehead pulsed; his heart raced as the man drew closer…
Soon, Harry finds himself captivated by Malfoy’s nipples, so pink and delicious, and he wants to nip at them, flick them with his tongue. He shifts uncomfortably in his chair, his jeans suddenly too tight.
“I do.”
“I’m here, with you.” Harry traced his cock along Draco’s lips until they stretched wide and swallowed him back down. “So good, Draco.” Harry tilted his head back in pleasure. He was warm, tingly, just like he got when he tripped. Was he tripping now? There was something about Draco, an energy he gave off that reminded Harry of the ‘
He sighs. “You shouldn’t Apparate while exposed to unknown potions, especially when you don’t know how the properties will react to magical travel.”
“It was. We were ambushed at Godric’s Hollow, and during our escape, my curse went astray. Broke Harry’s wand clean in half. For months he had to borrow mine—he was pretty sore about it too, not that I could blame him. But he kept the pieces inside the mokeskin pouch Hagrid had given him.” She left the room, and when she came back she had a small brown pouch with a drawstring. “He gave this to me before he—” Her eyes grew watery, and she swallowed.
There were no bright colours, only drab stone walls, and when Harry came to, he rolled off the bed and scrambled for the chamber pot. The stench of day-old urine assaulted his nostrils, and he was instantly sick, vomiting up slugs, just like the boy. He retched, and the slimy creatures slid out from his mouth, each one landing with a
Kreacher looks at Draco, obviously awaiting his reaction. When Draco smiles and nods, Kreacher looks impossibly pleased. He bows, then skates a lap around the room, adjusting the decor. With a parting pirouette, he heads back to the kitchen.
But it’s more than that. Harry is never home when I need him. He sleeps in late, which I can’t fault him for. It sounds like he’s up half the night with nightmares. But during the day he’s out with the Malfoy boy. The house is so quiet, and I feel so alone.
. He hissed as Harry gave a twist on the upstroke, and he redoubled his efforts on Harry, cursing his lack of foresight to bring lube. As if reading his mind, Harry spat into his hand, and Draco did the same. It was dark, he’d parked the car under the canopy of a tree, shielded from the streetlamps, but still, he hoped they weren’t giving the neighbours a show.
The next time Draco awoke, light filtered gently through the windows. It was a perfect morning, with Harry pressed against him—a welcome start to the day. But the previous night came flooding in, suffocating him.
But they found even with Harry’s cooperation, it was arduous work. The void had grown rather fond of Harry’s magic and wouldn’t give it up. Not without a fight.
“That’s lovely,” Harry says, his voice barely a whisper over his chattering teeth.
“Don’t know, don’t care.” Truthfully, he wondered about that himself.
“You can’t keep me here. What if I have to take a leak?”
She stared at him, then nodded. “Is there a reason you wanted to see me?”
I’ve had trouble sleeping as of late. I keep having the same dream. I’m surrounded by Vernon, Dudley, and Harry. We’re one big, happy family. Then Vernon looks at me and laughs, as though he’s told a joke. I don’t know what he’s said, but I join in the laughter. He keeps laughing and laughing, shaking with mirth, and then he fades away to nothing while I scream.
Harry’s close—
” There was a note of panic in Potter’s voice. “That’s not all.”
Hermione’s been at him for months to join her. “Harry, you’re always so worked up,” she’d said. “You need balance in your life. It’s time to slow down and nurture your creative side.” Reluctantly, Harry allowed her to sign them both up for a figure drawing class. Hermione looked smug, triumphant even, but Harry decided it was worth it if it earned him a month or two free from nagging. Conveniently Ron had to work (Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes were always flat out during the holidays) and didn’t get roped in as well.
While Draco fiddled with the fridge and microwave, Harry drew a hot bath filled with complimentary potions. He may have used a heavy hand on the ones with ‘calming’ and ‘romance’ on the label.
They went to the kitchen, and Draco filled her in about how they met, Harry’s lack of memory, and the time they spent together—he left out the more salacious details.
“Do we know each other… Draco?” Harry glanced at his nametag and hoped he’d pronounced it correctly; it was an unusual name.
The Dark Lord announced he’d killed Harry Potter—which meant he’d also killed the Horcrux residing within—and he must have been telling the truth because when Neville slew him, he stayed dead.
“Yes?”
Red lightning forked through the sky, illuminating the swirling mist.
“I—” he swallowed for a moment. “I can explain.”
“Why not? It’s just like that ice hotel in Sweden. But it’s here, and it’s ours.”
Harry stumbled out of bed and landed on his knees. He clutched his forehead, which felt like it might split in two. White-hot pain seared through his skull, radiating outward. He thought he might sick up. Petunia hadn’t let him go to bed until he’d polished off two large pieces of chocolate fudge cake, which he now regretted. But the cool hardwood floor under his shins soothed him. Harry rubbed his forehead—an action that seemed familiar. Had he experienced pain like this before? Or was this related to whatever had caused his memory loss? Harry breathed in and out, slow and steady breaths, and gradually the pain shifted from a raging inferno to a moderate ache.
Harry examines himself in the mirror. He runs his fingers through his hair in a futile attempt to smooth it down. He’s wearing his green suit, the one that brings out his eyes, freshly laundered and immaculately pressed. It fits a little more snugly than he’d like, and he frowns at the dark circles under his eyes, but overall, he cleans up nicely. He fastens his cufflinks—silver dragons—and knots the tie carefully at his throat.
I huff in annoyance and pray my palms aren’t sweaty. Every time I think I’m getting it, moving to the rhythm, Malfoy changes direction, and I feel as though I have four feet.
“Wonder how long it will last?” Harry asked. The pamphlet conveniently didn’t mention that fact, just that they were to remain indoors, and that they could order room service or help themselves to the Muggle-style mini-fridge.
Draco levitated Harry and followed her through to the guest bedroom. He laid Harry down, and they both examined him. His pulse was weak, and he was cold—except for his forehead, which was burning hot. Having experienced this before, Draco knew there was no time to waste.
“It’s cool,” Harry said casually, oblivious to the fact that the creator of the mark had murdered his parents. “I like the snake.”
I take offense to that mouldy remark! I’ve seen how hard Mr. Filch works at assigning students to keep the walls mildew-free!
Harry mouthed, “Sorry,” and ushered Draco into the living room, a garish monstrosity decorated with conflicting patterns in obnoxious cranberry hues. An elongated oval wooden coffee table—the cherry wood clashed hideously with the cranberry decor—already set up for afternoon tea, was sandwiched between an overly plush sofa and a matching wingback chair. Harry’s aunt Petunia wore a sour expression and eyed Draco with obvious disdain as she lit a cigarette. Well, he’d had a lifetime of dealing with difficult people; he could handle one more.
They enter the dining room and Draco stumbles — Harry catches him — because he suddenly remembers they are hosting tonight. But how can they, with everything encased in ice? They’ll have to cancel, and it will be yet another thing he’s failed at. His father, although not invited, will never let him live it down.
Stairs. He was under the stairs, in a cupboard. Draco wanted—needed—to get out, but there was no way out. He felt around for a door, pushed and kicked at it, but it was bolted shut.
“I don’t know how Harry came back from the dead, or how he ended up at the Dursleys, but I believe that thing inside his head is the aftermath of the Dark Lord’s Horcrux. It contained Dark Magic for so long, and once it was no longer needed—”
Draco glanced at his watch. Blast. Where was his tie? He always kept his tie in the same spot—hanging off the edge of his bedroom mirror. He searched the floor behind the mirror, inside his wardrobe, the laundry basket (even though he would
They drove back to Little Whinging in silence. Draco wasn’t sure what to say or do. He knew he should just tell Harry the truth. About his parents. About magic. About their turbulent history. But there was a part of him that just couldn’t. This opportunity was just too good to miss, and Draco hated himself, just a little bit, for his weakness.
A loud
The tree is tall with pure white branches, every ornament white or silver. Even the popcorn garlands are snowy-white rather than buttery-yellow. Harry squints at the tree, confused. He scours the branches. “Why is it called that? I don’t see any peacocks.”
The goblins at Gringotts had been more than happy to sign a non-disclosure agreement; they would keep their mouths shut about Harry’s existence, so long as he did the same about his break-in and theft from their bank.
“What happens now?”
The bed squeaked with every movement, and Harry hoped their Silencing Charms held.
But I think it will be so much better for everyone concerned if the boy never remembers.
When Draco returned to the bedroom, the glass slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor. Harry lay perfectly still, pale like a porcelain doll, his chest neither rising nor falling.
Harry grins. “That’s revoltingly adorable.” He squints at the tree, eyes gliding over each branch.
Harry groaned softly, and fresh blood seeped through the lightning bolt scar. Draco carefully tipped the potion—a modified Calming Draught mixed with a Muggle muscle relaxant—into his mouth and whispered soothing words as Harry swallowed. He’d infused the potion with treacle to mask the peppermint.
“Are you insane?” Draco cries out, moving away from Harry. His skates wobble; Harry glides forward and steadies him.
. Harry wished for more time. His fingers tingled, as though he could feel the grains of sand slipping through the proverbial hourglass with himself pulled in multiple directions, unsure of which grains to capture. The idea of going onward, being freed from his many burdens, appealed. Harry thought about his parents, and Sirius, and the things they never got to do together. If he got on the train, he would see them again. Excitement swelled within him. But no, that wouldn’t do. He couldn’t join them yet—not when Hermione and Ron and his other friends were still out there fighting. He wouldn’t leave unfinished business. Voldemort was still alive, and Harry was the Chosen One. He had to finish it.
Harry was silent for a moment, then surged upward and captured Draco’s lips. When he pulled back, he said, “I might not remember who I was, but I am certain of who I am now. I know what I want—I want you. Memories or no memories, it makes no difference. You’re gorgeous, and funny, and being with you just feels right. Like it’s where I’m meant to be.”
She cleared her throat. “He was clearly the wrong sort. You won’t be seeing him again.”
At the end of last July, they sent us to a so-called Safe House because of
Draco sat alone in the ticket box. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and there were next to no customers. His mind wandered to thoughts of Harry. Two days after their LSD trip, Harry made love to him twice more. The first time, urgent and frenzied, like he couldn’t possibly get his fill; the second, tender and slow, as though he wanted to draw it out and make it last forever. They gazed into one another’s eyes, each movement slow and deliberate, fingers intertwined. Draco came with Harry’s name on his lips.
He looks around as the other students file in. The desks have been artfully arranged in concentric rows surrounding a raised platform, and sunlight streams in through large windows bathing them in light. While Hermione would have preferred to sit front and center, they’ve elected to sit halfway back, partially because Harry doesn’t want to be
“Hermione, can you promise with utmost certainty that they’ll be able to heal him? That they’ll know what to do, and have his best interests at heart? That they won’t treat him as an experiment and use him?”
I can’t help myself; I follow. Harry’s clearly not in danger, but I could use a little nighttime adventure to spice things up. It gets boring staying in one spot, hearing the same password repeated ad nauseam. Why do you think I change it so often?
(seriously, who names these places?), a shady apothecary at the far end of Knockturn Alley known for its unsavoury clientele. Malfoy enters the store first, carefully silencing the doorbell before it can make a sound, and I follow closely behind. (We’d fought about that, too. About which one of us should take the lead. Malfoy won the game of wizards, goblins, and trolls—the wizarding equivalent of rock, paper, scissors. His haughty sneer made my blood boil.)
. He stared her down and asked her about the multiple deadbolts on Harry’s bedroom door. She smiled demurely and explained about Harry’s sleepwalking tendencies.
“And I reminded you of them?”
“You know, wave your wand around, make the pieces fly back together. You’re of age now, I’d have thought you’d want to flaunt your abnormality.”
“Wave my wand?” Harry asked in disbelief. “Have you hit your head too?”
He’d finished tidying, had gathered his belongings, and was just about to depart when Hermione joined him.
When Draco awoke, mouth cotton-dry, his limbs tingled, and his breath came in quick gasps. His mind, a maelstrom of images; his heart, a torrent of emotions. They’d fallen asleep with the lights on, and now they blinked off and on, off and on, off and on. Draco shuddered—the hairs stood on the back of his arms like that time he’d plugged in the jug with wet hands.
“Mmmmm, me too,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s shoulder.
Harry wants to drop to his knees and remove those sexy Santa pants with his teeth, let them fall to the floor while he grabs Malfoy’s cock and licks a firm stripe from base to tip. He wants to swirl his tongue around the head, taste Malfoy’s precome, grip his thighs so hard he’ll leave marks, swallow him down, let him fuck his mouth until his eyes water and saliva drips down his chin.
Harry takes a deep breath and stares at Malfoy, hating himself (just a little bit) for his puppy-dog crush that inconveniently won’t go away no matter how hard he tries. He knows full well that nothing will ever come from his
“Transfiguring a vine into a broom was clever.” Draco’s voice drifted out from the loo. “Fancy that, they have a salve specially formulated for curse burns. Right next to the
“Draco,” Harry says, his voice whipped away by the wind. “You’re the only one for me.” He gnaws at his lip. “When you died, a part of me died too.”
Draco shrugged and took a bite.
She stared at him, unblinking.
Harry chuckled, as though he didn’t believe it would have any effect. Then, with a dramatic flair, Harry said, “Draco, darling, love of my life. Won’t you please come inside?”
“We can’t have Mother and Aunt Andromeda here like this.” Draco pinches the bridge of his nose and prays for patience. Everything is a disaster and is not going according to plan. He remembers to breathe. In and out.
. It was such an embarrassment. I’ll have to try again.
Potter held out his hand. “I don’t.”
Instead of answering, Draco gracelessly flung himself through the window and landed in a heap on the floor. Slightly embarrassed by his dismount, Draco stood up and brushed himself off.
When Harry awoke, his head pounded fiercely. His limbs were heavy, like he’d walked a hundred miles, his chest thick and tight, as though he’d emerged from a blazing building. He couldn’t remember how he’d gotten into this state. Had he been to a party last night? In fact, the more he thought about it, he found he couldn’t remember last night at all. Alcohol must have been involved then. While he couldn’t remember the events leading up to this morning, he was certain his name was Harry—Harry Potter. The knowledge was inherent, but it was the only thing he knew for sure.
“Admit it, the ride was thrilling. Weaving through trees and dodging dive-bombing Occamys.”
Teddy smiles a toothy smile; his hair messy and coal-black, his eyes emerald green. Clearly, the kid is enjoying himself and think’s Potter is amazing. He grabs at the snow on Draco’s legs and makes a messy snowball which he lobs at the wall.
“Hermione.”
“I’m so sorry, Draco.”
Hermione nodded and took a deep breath. “Harry started taking private lessons with Professor Dumbledore during Sixth Year. He’d hoped to prepare Harry for the war, so he could face Voldemort and defeat him once and for all. Voldemort was so sick and twisted, determined to preserve his life at all costs, that he split his soul. Have you ever heard of the term
“And the Elder Wand became yours. Wait, does that mean my wand is also yours?”
“We’ve got to go. There’s no time to explain. Do you trust me?” Draco’s heart pounded as he heard the jingle of keys. The first double cylinder bolt slid open.
“I forgot I lit it,” Harry said, absently.
“Pardon?” Harry asked.
“I’m good. Great, actually. But I was hoping we could meet at your earliest convenience. I’ve something to ask.”
Harry pulled out his wand, and Draco did the same. Their eyes met, and Draco nodded. Harry thought back to their wedding day and shouted in tandem with Draco, “
Draco set to work brewing a potion of his own devising, a blend of wizard and Muggle components. Artemis perched on a chair and casually observed.
“There’s something I need to tell you.”
“I don’t think you understand. Without a functioning magical core, a wizard will die.”
Harry looked up at the moon, shimmery and bright. A creature howled in the distance, electrifying every cell in Harry’s body. He didn’t know how he got there, but suddenly Harry was deep in the forest. Moonlight filtered through the canopy in a kaleidoscope of spectral colours. The
Had she taken it? Was this why she was so insistent he take a nap? How had she known?
Draco dug into the books Artemis had brought to his flat. He called in sick and did nothing but read and eat takeaway for three days. He researched memory spells, magical balancing and very obscure realms of experimental magic contained within Dark tomes.
Draco pulls a box from his suit pocket. When he opens it, a platinum band, engraved with the Malfoy family crest, glints in the moonlight.
“Fuck, you feel so good.”
isn’t the same thing as
Many elderly wix hadn’t yet made it back to their cabanas.
The thing about meditation was it required physical presence and a relaxed state of mind. But Harry could not calm down or focus—his mind whirled with untamed thoughts about his multitude of worries. What was he to do about Petunia? Where was Dudley? What did his nightmares mean? Why couldn’t he remember anything?
The lights flickered, and Harry inhaled sharply.
of hooves sounding in the distance and spectral colours falling from the foliage above in a fine mist. Just like before, he could feel the emotions of his guardians—love, protection, and loyalty, beating from their hearts, rippling outwards and converging into his—but this time he could see their faces. One was an older version of himself, with glasses and hair poking out in all directions. The wolfman and dogman were there too, in their human form, with hands joined. The fourth figure was a woman—a striking beauty with long auburn hair plaited with lilies. But what entranced Harry the most was her eyes. She had his exact eyes—it was like looking through a window into his soul.
Draco chuckled as Harry got down on his hands and knees, so he was only visible from his shoulders up—better to chat and easier to cover up his nakedness. He wiggled his arse, just to torment Draco; the apron strings tickled his bare skin.
“Oh, I remember. You talked of little else for days.” Harry laughs and shakes his head. “The look on your face. Of course I cast the Impervius everywhere, what do you take me for?”
A while later, Petunia spoke on the other side.
Harry, still breathless and overcome from the rush of orgasm, nods.
—he definitely didn’t want Harry to stop doing
Harry paused, hand mid-air. “Er,” he said and scanned the label. “Is there even such a thing?”
, you look just like you did when you won the League Cup. You had the finest arse in the entire league. I couldn’t take my eyes off you.”
. She always buys something new for it when she visits.”
The peacocks shrink and one-by-one leap into the tree. They scurry about the branches and peck at the popcorn garlands. Draco laughs a hearty laugh. “It’s warmer in here, and they have plenty of food. I think they like it.” The peacocks arrange themselves, evenly spaced as proper ornaments should be, and fan out their tail feathers. To Harry’s delight, they rattle their feathers in unison. They make such an unusual sound, and the way the light reflects off their white, iridescent plumage is breathtaking.
A photo album.
But it doesn’t matter. Nothing matters anymore. Not without Draco.
“Faster!” Teddy cries out. “I want to go faster.”
He kept his eyes shut tight and stumbled over to the bed; it was easier if he couldn’t see the slugs or the ants. He breathed in and out, as Draco had instructed, and like a mantra repeated the words:
“I should get you home,” he said abruptly. “We don’t want your aunt to worry.”
Draco gasps as Harry’s hand slides into his pants and wraps around his hard, leaking cock. “Just a quick one,” Draco whispers and casts a wandless spell. Suddenly their trousers and pants are at their ankles, their cocks pressed together. He summons his favourite lube — one he brews himself that warms pleasantly the closer one gets to completion — and slicks them both up.
Draco shrugged. “Sometimes life makes no sense.”
“Petunia? What do you mean? What have you done?”
“I’m glad I have it; it makes me feel like he’s still with me.”
He smiled and shook his head. “No, it’s not me. I’m just curious about the limitations of Muggle medicine on wix. What if someday I treat a squib?”
“But we just got back.” Draco placed an open-mouthed kiss to Harry’s pulse-point, as he gripped Harry’s arse and pulled him even closer.
“But–”
“Harry? Who’s in there with you?” Petunia’s voice was shrill and urgent.
Draco removed a bag from his pocket and restored it to its proper size. He pulled out spellbooks, a large stack of handwritten notes, and together they poured over the details.
“Don’t be out too late, darling.”
“There, that wasn’t so difficult.” With a crooked smile, she ushered him inside.
They kiss deeply, lost in the moment, savouring the feel of lips and tongue, tasting each other. Harry’s tension melts away; he forgets about everything else until a throat clears in the doorway and they break apart.
“Did you take it?”
Once Hermione’s diagnostics turned violet, they began.
Draco huffed a sigh of relief when he saw Harry’s silhouette in the window. Even standing as far back as he could, his skin burned, and his ears rang unpleasantly like an itch that wouldn’t go away. But at least at this distance, he could breathe. He knew that would abruptly change unless he could get through to Harry.
With a snap of fingers, the bottle and Pensieve float to the shelf, and Harry lies back in bed.
Malfoy stands in the doorway, perfectly still, candy cane in hand. But he doesn’t give it to Harry, he stares at him instead.
“How did you get in here?”
“You’ll think I’m mad. Or think badly of me. Or both.”
Harry rests his head against Draco’s, and they remain still, breathing slowly until they come back to themselves. Draco’s cock softens and slips from Harry’s body, his seed trickling out. Slowly, Draco reaches down, and with a flourish, cleans them both. He takes a deep pull of whisky, then hauls Harry in for a passionate kiss. The complex flavours—rich and smoky with notes of vanilla—fill Harry’s mouth and add to the heat between them. Harry sits back, and Draco looks at him intensely, his expression a mixture of satisfaction and a depth of love that matches his own.
“I still can’t. Come here.”
Draco knew he should take Harry to St. Mungo’s—he needed an experienced Healer, not someone who dabbled. But the idea of exposing Harry’s existence to the wizarding world without his consent made Draco feel ill. They were more likely to use him than help him—treat him as an experiment—and he couldn’t be certain anyone there could actually heal him. Maybe he should speak with Hermione first? She would be furious, and rightly so, but she wasn’t known as the brightest witch of her age for nothing.
“No, it’s not that.”
“Until you’re all better. Until you’re back to normal and can see the error of your ways.” Harry could hear her teacup clink behind the closed door.
“I wanted to ask you about Potter.”
After an elongated pause, Potter said, “Er, Malfoy.” Eloquent as ever.
“She didn’t hurt you, did she?” Draco asked, his brow furrowed with worry.
I asked if he could be faking it. Dr Vaughn doesn’t believe so. Dissociative amnesia, that’s what he called it, caused by trauma or stress. Who knows what unsavoury things he’s been up to all year?
“Just like every year. Why would you promise him that? I’ll have you know you could have conjured snow outside, or we could have Apparated to the mountains.”
“If you destroyed them all, then the Dark Lord would become mortal and could finally be killed.”
“That’s what I thought,” Jess said, and slid off the counter. She grinned mischievously. “Speaking of, four o’clock. Tall, dark, and handsome is giving you the eye. Good luck.” With a wink, she grabbed the broom and headed for the stockroom.
Potter set the teapot down. Silently, he opened and closed his mouth, then he cleared his throat.
Afterwards, Draco rolled over, head propped up on an elbow. Filled with a fierce desire to protect, he’d said, “I know this is soon. Sudden, perhaps. But I’d really like it if you moved in with me. We spend so much time together anyway, I’d like to make it official.”
“Maybe next time you’ll listen to reason and I won’t have to stitch you up with the hotel sewing kit.” Draco shook his head. “Honestly, who keeps their sewing kit inside a biscuit tin?”
But Draco was already halfway into his robe. His pinched expression meant no returning to pleasure. Harry sighed and ran his fingers through his hair, already resigned to a sad wank in the shower.
Dr Vaughn increased the dose of my medication today. He said it should take the edge off. He also said I should continue to write, even if it’s hard. Even if it’s only a few lines. Utter nonsense, but I’ve nothing better to do…
I turn to Dudley. He blows me a kiss, tosses his rucksack over his shoulder, and walks away. He won’t look back. I keep calling out to him, but he never looks back.
When Hermione returned, she placed the Elder Wand on the bedside table furthest away from Draco. He couldn’t blame her. They went over Draco’s notes again and he talked her through the finer points of the procedure. She asked questions and offered suggestions.
“But we need to talk about the other stuff. The LSD.”
Harry released a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding—Draco didn’t think he was losing his mind.
Malfoy rips the covers off—Harry scowls.
But that’s not all he wants. He’d bring Malfoy to the edge, but he wouldn’t let him fall over. Instead, he’d pop off and Malfoy would groan, sharp silver eyes glaring in annoyance. But then Harry would lean over the desk, offering himself up. He’d whisper the preparation spells and Malfoy would slip in a finger, just one at first, and then two. He’d make Harry beg for it. Three fingers. Harry would cry out as Malfoy grazed his prostate, and cruelly, just at that moment, remove them. But Harry wouldn’t stay empty for long. Malfoy would line himself up, teasing Harry until he pants,
A tap on the glass brought him out of his thoughts. Artemis. Two letters from his mother in one day was too persistent, even for her. He almost sent the owl away in anger. But then he had a better idea. He removed the letter, added it to the pile, and pulled out his stationary. He raised his eyebrows as the owl hopped closer to his curry.
The final credits rolled. Between them, they’d killed the bottle and reduced the bowl to kernels. Hermione sat with her feet in Draco’s lap, and he massaged them with slow circles.
Draco laughed, rich and deep. “Those are fine. Pour them in.”
Harry blinks in surprise. “You want to meet there? On Valentine’s Day? At night?”
“We look fine.”
The woman, Petunia, gestured randomly, then lit a cigarette from a crumpled pack of Mayfair Superkings. She inhaled deeply, as though the smoke sustained her better than oxygen, then let the smoky tendrils waft slowly from her mouth. She fixed her icy glare at Harry.
“You could still be a Healer. You could come back and start Healer Training at St Mungo’s. I could speak with—”
“If you’re referring to your drugs, then yes, I did. I should have been firmer with Dudley; I can see that now. Trust me, you’ll thank me later.”
platform.”
, fronted by Percy Weasley, and had seen a record number of donations over the past year.
Draco sat on the bench next to her. “I didn’t know if you’d come. After everything.”
“Who,” he sneered with obvious disdain, “are
Harry snaps. What he wouldn’t give to hex Goldstein, cover him in boils, perhaps a severe case of Scrotal Pox. But in a room full of Muggles, he can’t risk it. Instead, he grabs Goldstein by the t-shirt and pushes him back against his desk, perhaps a little more forcefully than necessary. “That’s enough,” Harry fumes. “Shut your mouth or I’ll shut it for you. Permanently.” Goldstein looks terrified, and, of course, that’s exactly when the teacher walks in.
“The Elder Wand is a dangerous wand,” she said. “I used it to repair Harry’s wand and I haven’t used it since. It has a long, bloody history—has commanded its previous owners to do monstrous things—and I don’t want to abuse that kind of power.”
After a moment’s hesitation, Harry picked up the bird and flopped back in bed. Faint lines of ink visible through the paper informed him the bird contained a message. He took a moment to appreciate the artistry—he knew he wouldn’t be able to fold it back up as neatly. Carefully, he smoothed out the paper and instantly recognised Draco’s tidy script. His stomach fluttered as the words swam on the page. Harry took a deep breath, and the writing steadied.
Following a quick shower, Draco towelled himself off and applied his usual sequence of lotions and leave-in hair serum. It had taken weeks to nail down the perfect combination to attain the silky-smooth finish the Malfoy family Charms could instantly create. He wanted nothing to do with magic—or anything Malfoy-related.
It was unsurprising to find Harry’s magical core dangerously depleted, to the point where his body had shut down—the unplanned Apparition had used up valuable resources. But Draco could now see the source of the problem, which
“I’m not actually sure. This is going to sound strange, but I recently lost my memory. You seem familiar, but obviously I’m mistaken.” Harry held out his hand. “My name’s Harry. Harry Potter.”
“What have I done to him?” The nerve of her. “He came to me last night, extremely sick, and I did what had to be done. I helped him.”
Harry’s eyes grew wide with surprise. “How did you do that?”
“There’s a chamber pot beside your wardrobe.”
As if reading his mind, Harry turned and pressed his morning wood against Draco’s thigh. Draco’s breath hitched, and Harry chuckled. He shamelessly ground his erection against Draco, and Draco sighed. Harry kissed him, slowly, deeply, effectively removing all thoughts from Draco’s mind. Harry laid on his back and pulled Draco on top of him, cupping his arse. Draco kissed him urgently, satisfying a deeply rooted need to claim and possess. Draco Malfoy had always wanted Harry Potter, even when he didn’t know how to show it—even when he knew Potter would never give him a chance. And now Harry—
As Harry watches him leave, he’s left with a lingering visual — undoubtedly planted by Malfoy — of himself bent across strong, pale legs with bright red handprints on his arse. He smirks and resolves to be at least twenty minutes late.
Befriending Hermione Granger—not something Lucius Malfoy would do.
He’d spent the greater part of the week reading and researching memory spells. A carefully modified Obliviation Spell was the answer to his problems. He’d constructed the spellwork to isolate the past five months. All memories of Harry, Hermione, and his life working at the cinema would be gone. He’d start over, just as he’d done that first day in his new flat. Except it would be the first of October.
When Harry got back to his room, he saw the meditation book on his desk and instantly felt guilty. But he’d tried. He really had.
“I don’t know,” Harry replied. “I think I had too much to drink. I must have hit my head; things are a bit fuzzy right now.”
“Besides, that Occamy came out of nowhere.”
Draco pulls away.
They kiss feverishly, Draco stroking their cocks together, and Harry pulls back long enough to purr, “You feel so good.” His hands tangle in Draco’s hair and his breath catches as Draco adds a twist over the top. Harry rocks his hips into Draco’s fist, the drag of cock against cock within Draco’s firm grasp feels electric, the pleasure intensified by the warming sensation. It feels so good Harry doesn’t know how he’s still standing — why haven’t they moved to the bed? — but he also doesn’t want to move now that he’s so close. Pleasure coils in his belly and he tries to hold off, to prolong the rapture, but when Draco nips his lip, groaning as he comes, the pain and the added lubrication from Draco’s release push him over the edge. Harry cries out and comes hard, shuddering as Draco holds him tight. They cling to each other as their muscles clench and release.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry. “Because you agreed.”
“The vortex? Or Harry?”
“What I’m trying to say, Draco, is that I remember. All of it. Hogwarts. The war—”
A baby cried, and a woman pleaded.
“Please.”
“I want that too.”
“You are pure evil,” Draco sighs. “You know I can’t resist you like this.” He pulls Harry’s shirt out, undoes his trousers, and slides his hand in, teasing him over the fabric of his pants. “You know, I think the whole
She nodded, her emotions carefully tucked away and replaced with the calm professionalism of a Healer. “Come this way.”
“This way’s more fun. Where’s your sense of adventure?” Harry’s eyes are bright with excitement and it’s contagious. But Draco remembers how old his ancestral home is.
Draco had brought a bottle of Pinot Grigio. He poured two glasses and set them down on the table beside the bowl of freshly popped popcorn—the buttery aroma smelled heavenly.
“This is the lounge,” Draco says casually. But there is nothing casual about the room; the furnishings are fit for royalty.
He went for a leisurely drive, his favourite pastime—it had been a mistake. He’d taken Harry on all his favourite routes, and driving near their picnic spot was gut-wrenching. Draco couldn’t sleep in his bed, overwhelmed by thoughts of soft hands gliding across his skin, hot breath against his neck, and the words, ‘
Draco did not have such a device and didn’t know where to look. He sighed. That wasn’t entirely true. There were many Dark Artifacts hidden within the depths of the Manor. He’d vowed to never again set foot in that wretched place, filled with horrid memories of murder and Dark Curses. But he would, for Harry.
Narcissa, elegantly dressed in a blue gown, eyes the couple, clearly amused. “It’s lovely to see you, Harry.” She nods at her son. “If you’re quite finished,” she says, her eyes twinkling, “dinner awaits.”
“It’s okay, I’m here,” Harry whispered beside him.
I slide into the Troll Tapestry—ugh, Trolls are so smelly—just in time to see the pair slip into the Room of Requirement. I catch a glimpse just as the door shuts: there’s a giant gilded four-poster bed with black silk sheets, piled high with a mountain of plush silver and gold pillows. The Room’s gone all out for them.
Wistfully, Harry thought of Draco’s bright grey eyes, his soft platinum hair that felt amazing as it brushed against Harry’s skin, his smile, his warm embrace. Harry longed to be at Draco’s flat right now, safe in his arms. It had been so long since they’d last seen each other. If only—
He lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Her voice was so sweet.
Draco recoils as if stung. Because that’s not what Harry said the first time. When it really mattered. When it would have made a difference. Bile rises in Harry’s throat as his words replay in his head, a bitter refrain.
Harry’s just finished Malfoy’s face, his eyes moving of their own accord downward, tracing the delectable line where tendon meets clavicle. Harry has the urge to bite, to mar that perfect porcelain skin and leave his mark. Malfoy’s chest is chiselled to perfection; Bill ensures that his Curse-Breakers are in peak physical condition and Malfoy clearly has not skimped on training. A series of silver-white lines crosscut Malfoy’s chest, marks Harry left years ago, and he stares at them with a fascination formed from equal parts guilt and arousal. He wonders what it would feel like to run his fingers along each sinuous line, followed by his tongue. He draws them instead.
“I just heard him,” he snarled through gritted teeth. “What have you done to him?”
Draco continued to breathe and visualise: a magical container, created out of necessity, no longer needed but still there, sucking in magic and memories.
“Are you all right?”
“This one’s Mother’s favourite. I call it
In the afternoon, Petunia came back and pushed books and papers through the cat flap. “It’s high time you gave your future some consideration.”
Draco’s tongue circles Harry’s rim, teasing him—it’s so good, but not nearly enough. Harry mewls, then pushes his hips back, just a little, making his need known.
A myriad of emotions flitted across her face. “How?”
Potter coughed. “I should… Would you care for some tea?”
When they break apart, Harry grins. “And you wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Bottles clink.
Hermione cast a series of spells, and a shimmery blue orb rippled over Harry. “It’s a medical-grade Stasis Charm,” she said. “It will keep him safe. For now.” She turned to Draco. “You have some explaining to do.”
“I’m sorry,” she said. “It’s still so raw. He was… He was like a brother to me.”
Draco bit his lip. “I feel like I’m taking advantage of you. You don’t remember your past, and when you get your memories back… Well, I might not be who you want.” Draco swallowed and looked away. There. He’d said it. It wasn’t the full truth, but the important parts were there.
He tipped back the phial.
“Again?” The teacher says. “I’ve warned you about this before, Mr Goldstein. I’m afraid you must leave.”
Hermione reached the door, and the smile dissolved from her face. She stood still, with her mouth agape. “Who is this? Is this some kind of joke? Because if it is, it’s not funny.”
Draco wondered if he should just carry on as planned. Artemis nipped him hard on the shoulder.
, Harry interjected—“next time, I’m choosing the resort.”
Harry looks at Hermione. “You planned this.”
The phone rang, and Harry knew it was Draco. He wished Draco were here—he should have moved in with him when he had the chance.
The day starts out just like any other day. Kreacher begrudgingly makes my breakfast—the eggs are cold and the toast hard, but I scarf it down with a smile. One day I’ll wear him down.
“That’s fair.”
“Shhhh. It’s just a power surge. Go back to sleep, love.” Harry snuggled against Draco and shortly after began to snore. Draco breathed a shaky sigh of relief.
Petunia inhaled sharply, as though mention of the war brought back foul memories.
When he reaches their place, he looks out over the sea. The waves are white-capped in the wind; the moon, nearly full, is reflected in the ripples below. Harry casts another
Just as he was turning to leave, the door flung open. Draco looked soft and gently dishevelled in his pyjamas and slippers, his hair lightly sleep-tousled. Harry’s heart fluttered at the sight.
“Too right it has.” Petunia nodded earnestly.
The question was, how did Harry come back?
There was still the slight matter of not being able to reach Harry. He’d tried calling him—many times—but each time Petunia answered and firmly told him to stop calling.
But he can’t take it back. He doesn’t even know how many nights he’s stayed up into the wee hours, wishing for a Time-Turner, with Ogden’s as his only company.
The effect was instantaneous. The bezoar neutralised the LSD, and the rate of magical drainage decreased to a trickle. He’d been right—the LSD
Draco looks at Harry, and Harry looks back into his dark, dark eyes.
“Oh God,” Harry said. “I think I’m having an acid flashback. It sounded like you just said we’re wizards.”
“Actually,” Hermione interjects, “Harry was defending Drake. Anthony has been verbally harassing him all class.”
“Me too,” Draco whispered, but he was thinking of a time long, long ago.
Draco reached out, his magic melding with Harry’s, pulsing as it connected. It wasn’t like talking, it was more of a feeling. But he tried to tell Harry, through emotion—love, compassion, joy—that he needed to relax and let go. That he would be there for Harry and would take care of him.
“I think you’d better.”
Harry looked like a devious angel as he took Draco’s cock into his mouth—just the head at first, teasing him, making him beg before swallowing him down. He sucked with hollowed cheeks, plump lips, and bright, mischievous eyes that drank him in. Draco shuddered and spread his legs at Harry’s insistence. While he licked, sucked, and savoured, Harry circled Draco’s entrance with a lubed finger, and as Draco relaxed, Harry pushed inside, just past the ring. Draco was no virgin—he’d experimented plenty on himself, and the Slytherin dormitory wasn’t known for chaste activity—but being worked open by Harry Potter was like nothing he’d ever experienced before. Maybe it was because this was his fantasy come to life, maybe it was because he’d desired him for so long, but Harry’s touch was positively electric. Before Draco knew it, he was rocking his hips as Harry took him apart, piece by piece.
“Of course.” Harry rose and looked at Draco. “I’ll be right back.”
“I think we’ve already established that.”
Harry was like a somnambulist; such an apt term for his existence at Privet Drive, gliding through each day in a dreamlike state, oblivious to the imminent danger. Draco yearned to guide him to safety without waking him prematurely. Draco hadn’t seen it initially, but he couldn’t look away now.
“There’s no guarantee you’ll see what I see. It’s probably different for everyone.”
I received a postcard from Madrid, and then another from Ibiza. He said he was having the time of his life, and I wasn’t to worry.
“Everyone knows magic isn’t real.”
No magic? No mention of the past? It was almost too good to be true. Without the war, the rest of the wizarding world, including annoying Gryffindor hangers-on, Harry could be his—all his. For the small price of a lie… Draco felt a tingle of guilt in his belly. What would Lucius Malfoy do? Lie through his teeth. But this was different, and Draco would not look a gift Thestral in the mouth. He knew full well if Harry’s memory was intact, he wouldn’t want anything to do with Draco. It wasn’t a guarantee that things would work out between them, but at least he had a chance. Draco would do anything for a chance.
Because Potter was dead.
Once fully seated, Harry kisses Draco hard, and runs a gloved hand against his jaw. He wants—
“Close your mouth, Harry,” Hermione whispers, and Harry does.
The boy... the

again to distance himself… to keep him separate from his memories of
“Don’t worry. I’ll change them back after,” Draco says. His eyes smoulder with intent. “Now, turn around.”
“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” Draco replied politely. She didn’t offer her hand, so he nodded instead. Petunia continued to stare daggers at him, and he didn’t know why; his manners were impeccable. This situation obviously required perseverance. They sat down, Harry and Petunia united on the couch, and Draco in the chair, which attempted to swallow him whole. He twisted uncomfortably as he sank deeper.
Harry and Draco quickly swam for shore.
Harry can tell he’s getting close, is eager to taste his release. But Draco pulls Harry back by his hair with a sharp tug, and the accompanying pain is just this side of pleasurable.
Was there a way to tell him the truth and still get to keep him?
Draco nodded and sighed. “Yes. You feel so good.”
This is the first year he and Harry are hosting Christmas Eve dinner, which will be the only opportunity for Narcissa to spend time with Andromeda and Teddy. Everything has to be perfect; his mother has impossibly high standards.
She smirked. “Those two.”
“Artemis, I have a job for you. If you’re successful, I’ll order a beef masala with rice just for you.”
“I’m sure it does.”
Driving an automobile—not something Lucius Malfoy would do. But Draco decided early on if he could fly a broom then he could drive a car. He’d learned the hard way too, through grit and determination, no Confundus Charm required for his driving test. The 1966 Ford Cortina—sky blue, the colour of freedom—was his pride and joy, and he’d found that going for a scenic drive was every bit as enjoyable as flying a broom.
Harry looked mildly alarmed, but Draco continued. “You’re a wizard, Harry. And so am I.”
But before he put his clothing on, he sat back down and contemplated
“He looks good,” she said.
When I return my attention to the hallway, it’s Harry who’s in control. He’s got Draco pressed against the wall with his arms pinned overhead. Harry’s undulating, and I can’t see what’s happening on account of those dratted robes, but Draco seems to like it. He hisses, and when Harry tilts his head to the side, I can see him smirk in a very non-Gryffindor way.
The woman did neither. She trembled, then lowered her arm, her shoulders drooping like a wilted flower. Harry took a step forward.
“Oh, I understand all right.” She put her hands on her hips and looked Draco squarely in the eye. “I told you what would happen if there was any
“But what? What’s stopping you?”
, and Draco couldn’t think of a better term. Wizards had the
Harry couldn’t believe his eyes when a mermaid rose from the depths. He’d never seen a tropical mermaid before, only the drab grey and green species from the Black Lake. The mermaid’s scales were the most beautiful shade of turquoise Harry had ever seen; they shimmered in the diffused light like tiny jewels. A lilac shell bra covered her ample bosom, she wore a matching shell necklace, and her auburn hair glowed, illuminating the surrounding water like a liquid flame. Small fish followed her blazing locks as they flowed in the current, and Harry was equally enchanted. He couldn’t look away.
He found Hermione in the kitchen. She made them tea and pulled out a loaf of banana cake.
She sniffed. “I suppose it’s probably for the best.”
Draco understood, he missed his mother too. But there was nothing to be done about that.
Much like the rest of his flat, Draco’s lunch was a simple affair. A plate with cheeses, crackers, and cured meat, far removed from the lavish meals of Malfoy Manor. Nowadays, Draco delighted in the freedom of simplicity. Liberated from the heavy burden of expectation, he could finally breathe.
“Yes. You need something real.”
Harry approached the counter. The blond had his back turned, so Harry took a moment to appreciate his slender frame. Clean, clear lines gave way to a shapely arse, and as he turned, Harry admired the blond fringe that flopped across his left eye. When he caught sight of Harry, he froze. His eyes were ice-grey, and Harry looked at his lovely, plump lips, slightly agape.
With a growl, the gigantic spider attacked. But Harry was falling… falling…
Pleasure coiled in Harry’s belly, and he inhaled sharply as he tried to hold on. “I’m close,” he gasped. “Touch yourself.” But instead, Draco froze, then quickly wriggled off and landed beside the bed with a loud
They continued until the last memory rang out: the voice of Albus Dumbledore.
No, Privet Drive was not home. Privet Drive was…
23 August 1998
Now Harry’s guiding you up the stairs and into his bedroom. You’ve been here before, many times in fact, but under different circumstances. You tell him you have things to do, and that really, you’re all right, you just need to be on your way. He shushes you. His hands, his deft hands that have taken you apart so many times before, are gentle and careful as he slips off your clothing, mindfully draping it across a chair, and he dresses you in his favourite, cosiest pair of pyjamas. You don’t mind that they’re crimson and covered with snitches; they feel warm and comforting. They remind you of him. You shake the thought away and remember all the things that need doing, how you need to leave. He ignores you and tucks you into bed, makes you take your potions — one to calm your nerves, another to make you sleep. He kisses your forehead, gently, and you suddenly remember Scorpius. You need to pick him up. But sleep pulls you under before you can speak. The last thing you see is green.
Draco shrugged. “I’ll behave if he will. But you know he won’t. He hates me.”
not be allowed anywhere near the house.
A smile played on Petunia's lips. “All right. But just so we’re clear, there is to be no
Harry continues to sketch and shade Malfoy’s hipbones, wishing he could touch, dip his thumbs in and trace the indentation. He wants to suck on Malfoy’s fingers, one at a time, while he looks him in the eye. He wonders what it would feel like to run his hand over the red velvet, to trace the hard lines beneath. Surely Malfoy didn’t have a semi earlier? Harry would have noticed. He’s certain he would have done. Unless he’s been too distracted by his…everything else.
“Did you mean it?” she asked and turned to meet his eyes, searching their depths.
Hermione packs up quickly, but Harry remains seated. He needs another moment. She smiles knowingly and says she’ll meet him outside. One-by-one the students exit the classroom and Malfoy hands each a candy cane as they leave. Harry thinks of Voldemort in a pink vinyl corset. A short while later, he’s able to adjust himself and stand. With his drawing and pencil in hand, he heads for the door. He hopes, being the last one out, that Malfoy might already have left and he won’t have to look him in the eye on the way out. But no such luck.
She looked down at her plate and Draco realised he’d put his foot in his mouth.
She pulled out a box, the corner of her mouth quirking up into a fond smile. The cover featured a lion, a tinman, a scarecrow, and a girl with a little dog. “You’ll have a laugh at this one. It’s one of my favourites.”
“But Potter,”—
For hours, Harry thrashed in his bed as the thing he had to recall got further and further away, like a locked door at the end of a never-ending hallway. Eventually, he fell into a fitful sleep. He awoke in the morning with a sentence on the tip of his tongue.
Harry was sure he’d imagined it.
A good night’s sleep—if you could call it that, he’d awoken after a few hours and paced the flat—had done little to calm Draco. In fact, he’d worked himself into a lather contemplating various scenarios. Probably not the cleverest move, but he was going to let Granger have a piece of his mind. How could they keep the knowledge of Potter’s existence to themselves? How selfish of them? The world—and Draco—needed hope following the fallout of the war.
“I don’t know!” His voice reverberated throughout the platform. The mist reacted, swirling into a cyclone of colours—scarlet and emerald, indigo and lemon, chartreuse and orchid—with Harry centred in the eye of the storm.
from downstairs startled Harry
“They’re not there, darling.”
At once, the pain stopped. The ringing in his ears ceased. He could breathe again.
Draco sighed and sat down on a cushioned bench opposite Potter. The table was rectangular with slats of wood stained a tasteful stone grey. The teapot was navy blue, painted with gold irises—it went well with Potter’s sweater. Draco made himself look up, and he found Potter staring back intently.
The darkness, extending around Draco like a terrifying blanket, seemed never-ending. Then there came light, the tiniest, minutest beam of light, filtering in through a crack. Draco’s heart raced, engulfed in a wave of claustrophobia. He had to get out.
He was inside a hut filled with giant things—giant cups and saucers, a giant dog, and a giant man who served rocks instead of cakes. There was a small red-haired boy who barfed up slugs while a bushy-haired girl rubbed his back. Harry felt a strange surge of affection for the pair.
Draco buried his face, wet with tears, into Harry’s neck and smelled the citrusy, sandalwood scent that was distinctly Harry.
“There you have it.” Draco grins. “A bet’s a bet, Potter. I win.”
Harry looks up and points to the green leaves and waxy white berries hanging overhead. “He’s right. We’re standing under the Kissletoe.”
Draco squared his shoulders. He wouldn’t spend his life hiding in the loo; he could deal with this. He went back to the kiosk, put on a fresh batch of popcorn, and affixed the Malfoy charm as he greeted the first in the queue.
Harry tiptoed along the hallway. He snagged a cricket bat from one of the other upstairs rooms. The bedroom was the exact opposite of the one he’d woken up in; so messy it amazed him that anyone could find anything in it. Slowly he crept down the stairs, avoiding a step he knew was creaky. He paused and shook his head. The house was both strange and familiar at the same time. Or maybe the house was familiar, but he was strange in it?
“True.”
The Dark Lord loomed over everyone, eyes cold and reptilian, as he announced Harry’s death with obvious glee. There came a collective gasp from the crowd and a wail of despair. Draco’s chest tightened—searing pain surged through his heart, and he knew he would slowly bleed from the wound for the rest of his life. Tears formed in his eyes, stinging, just like on that fateful day, and he must have made a sound because Harry pressed closer.
With surgical precision, Draco spoke the incantation to access the vortex and create a carefully constructed rift. Never taking his eyes off his work, he instructed Hermione to begin. She took a deep breath and commanded the Elder Wand. Her hand vibrated, then jolted, but nothing else happened. After a moment of silence, a low buzzing noise, like static, filled the room.
05 September 1998
“It’s a Muggle thing.”
“Well, I’m just putting the Beef Wellington into the oven, so I can’t leave the house. But you’re welcome to come over. You could stay for dinner.”
“I’m going to try something.”
“And why did I do that?” Harry leans back into the embrace and Draco nips at his neck.
reappeared, and they fed us some rubbish about the other Aurors being needed elsewhere. Ensorcelled, she drew Dudley to her. When Vernon caught them kissing… Well, he lost it. And rightly so. It was wrong. Unnatural. Imagine if they stayed together? Got married? We could end up with another one of
And with those words Draco spilled, wave upon euphoric wave rippling outwards as he became lost to the sensation. Harry shuddered, the wetness between them growing as Harry panted against Draco’s neck.
Draco purposely avoids the ballroom and takes Harry to the music room, which has a cosy feel and is less formal than the lounge. Draco informs him that the tree is classically themed with Rococo elements. All Harry can see are an excessive number of naked angels and harps.
“There’s one more thing we need.” He looked directly at Hermione. “A powerful conduit—we need the Elder Wand.”
Well, Draco wasn’t about to tell anyone he’d seen Harry Potter. For one, he had too many unanswered questions. Second, they wouldn’t believe him. Unless they already knew…
Harry reached his hand into the secret compartment and extracted a small bottle and a business card. The bottle, filled with a clear liquid, had no label. The lid had a dropper attached. Harry examined the business card. One side had a technicolour aeroplane. He flipped the card over. The other side read:
He’d never sent it, though. He knew Potter would only laugh at him and show it to all his Gryffindor followers. Draco couldn’t risk that—the Malfoy reputation had to be upheld at all costs. The chance of public humiliation outweighed the slim possibility of a positive outcome, and the old Draco would never risk pride or public appearance. He’d only sent Potter the notes intended to hurt.
Unless… Was Harry avoiding him? Using Petunia as an excuse? Perhaps it had been too much to ask him to move in so soon…
and not ‘
Secretly pleased with Draco’s commanding tone, Harry takes one step, then another until he looms over Draco, and straddles him. Nimble hands cup his arse as Harry claims Draco’s lips—Draco kisses like a dream, with fire and intensity. Skilled hands glide lovingly, with devotion, over every square inch of leather, and Harry’s cock plumps at the attention. He groans as Draco pulls him closer, grinding their erections together.
“Darling, look at you,” he says reverently. He licks his lips and gestures for Harry to turn around.
. But he turned the pages of the Medieval tome until he found what he needed: a Containment Charm. It was powerful magic, meant to contain demonic powers, but it would suit their purposes just as well.
Harry studies and memorises Draco’s face, his sharp angles softened by his diaphanous form. He wishes he could touch him for real, feel his porcelain skin, thread his fingers through his silky hair. Instead, he settles for the cold radiating from Draco, permeating through his fingers, reacting with his magic to make him feel the most alive he’s felt all year.
Harry beamed when he spotted the treacle tart. “That’s my favourite. How did you know?”
Draco lay down next to Harry and cast a spell he’d learned long ago from a Dark tome.
He’s never going to live this down. He’ll have to change jobs.
Until now.
Immediately, the ringing began in Draco’s ears. His skin burned; his lungs constricted. With her welcome rescinded, the wards reactivated. Petunia smiled as he took several steps back until his symptoms eased.
You awaken. It’s dark out now. You’re not sure how long you’ve been asleep, but your body feels better, more centred, grounded. For a moment, you forget where you are. You look around as confusion sets in, then clears, replaced with worry.
“Of course I’ll marry you. There’s nothing I want more. I love you so much.”
Harry passed Draco the cigarette, and he inhaled deeply, the smoke calming his nerves. They were getting too close to the truth.
“What opens at the close?” Harry wasn’t making any sense. “The close of what? Harry, look at me.”
He’d kissed Draco goodnight before they’d left their parking spot. He’d been right to do so—a ruffle of curtains meant Petunia had been peeking out the window. Harry knew she meant well, and it was only because she cared so much, but just for once, he yearned for a little privacy. He wanted the freedom to kiss his boyfriend—was Draco his boyfriend now?—in private before he went inside. If Petunia was still watching, all she would have seen was two friends shaking hands as they said goodnight. She didn’t see the heat in Draco’s eye or the way he clasped Harry’s wrist, stroking over the tender skin on the inside, which still burned from his touch.
I’m just about to nod off when I hear footsteps from within the Gryffindor common room. The hour is late and every student should be in bed. I’d chastise the miscreant, but quite frankly I’ve lost the will. Over the years I’ve been slashed, I’ve been hexed, and I’ve been threatened with destruction—it grows tiring. Besides, it’s not like my lectures do any good.
Another
. What a sadistic, twisted bastard. Such a desperate act—to think one’s own life is more valuable than those he killed.
“Hey Santa, I’ve been a good boy. Can I sit on your lap?”
18 May 1998
“How about now?” Harry asks tentatively.
Harry’s heart beat faster, and he smiled, hoping to warm the strangely frosty encounter. He’d successfully done so with Petunia.
They were kissing passionately, grinding their erections together, when Draco experienced the first wave.
“Hermione, I’ll explain everything later. You can yell, you can hate me. Punch me if you’d like. But right now, he needs our help.”
“That’s right. Not a thing. And I intend to keep it that way. If you want to be a part of his life, then you must agree. And this stays between us.”
With a bite halfway to his mouth, a sleek Eagle owl tapped at the window. Draco cursed and hurried to let the beast in before any of his Muggle neighbours noticed. His mother was nothing but persistent. He detached the letter and the small gold box of Belgian chocolates. He fed his mother’s new owl a piece of cheese, which it immediately wolfed down.
“You’re gorgeous,” Draco replies and dives back in.
“I’m afraid we’re at an impasse,” Harry said.
When the cinema was busy, Draco enjoyed the fast pace as it kept his mind from wandering to the past… to things that couldn’t be changed. During the quiet times, he read his medical textbooks or chatted with Jess.
. The owl perched on the back of a kitchen chair and eyed Draco expectantly.
. It’s perfect. Absolutely zero chance for dear, sweet Harry to be led astray and ruined.
He had been so focused on the snake that day, but now time rippled around him, suspended, and Draco could take in the details he’d missed the first time. Fear in the eyes of the surrounding Death Eaters; Neville’s face, set with determination; The Dark Lord’s stunned expression before contorting in rage. Even though Draco knew the outcome—had lived through it—he feared for Neville.
Harry groaned as Draco’s hand wrapped around his cock.
is what she called it. But I knew then what it was—a poison, and it ruined my sister. Of course, she went and married another freak. Harry never stood a chance. We thought a heavy hand might help, but he was clearly a lost cause.
Petunia’s shrill, panicked voice snapped him out of his thoughts.
No response came.
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry, slowly, deeply. Harry tilted his head to the side and leaned into the kiss, practically melting into Draco.
Harry decided perhaps it was for the best they stayed out of the ocean. Draco agreed wholeheartedly. They stretched out side-by-side on lounge chairs beside the pool instead. The water was crystal clear, no hideous surprises lurked within. Harry ordered another round of mimosas and the tropical tapas platter.
“Just take a little,” he’d told Harry. “This shit will fuck you up.”
Draco bit his lip. “I meant it when I said we’ve never been friends.”
Draco plants a small, tender kiss on Harry’s left arse cheek. Harry’s so overcome with the sweetness of the gesture that he’s caught off guard when Draco dives in and licks a firm stripe from his balls, up and over his perineum, across his opening.
Harry got up carefully and staggered to his desk. It had been empty the last time he’d seen it. Now, in the centre, sat a paper crane. How did it get there?
Draco conjured a glass and cast
Draco pants and writhes beneath Harry, his arms casually folded behind his head, his long platinum hair fanned out over the pillow. He practically glows against Harry’s dark bedspread. A bead of sweat forms at his brow, his cheeks are deliciously flushed, and his eyes, blown with arousal, stare into Harry’s. He parts his plump lips and Harry can’t help but lean down to kiss him, give him a quick swipe of tongue, as he sets into a pounding rhythm.
Not that Draco could blame him, he still had that paper crane tucked away.
A moan from the spare bedroom halted further conversation. They set down their cups and raced to Harry’s side.
One at a time, Harry slides his legs into the sleek leather trousers. He manages to pull them all the way up—but can’t do up the laces. There’s nothing for it. Alteration spells aren’t exactly Harry’s forte, but he magically adjusts the uniform so it fits him like a glove. He ties the laces and hopes Draco won’t notice his shoddy spellwork.
“My, my, is it just me or does Santa look extra hot this year?” Goldstein says loudly and whistles, earning him a glare from Hermione.
But when Draco drove past number four, Privet Drive, the house was empty.
Draco took a sip and charmed his glass to hover nearby. “Where did you find this place?”
“We should go away again,” Harry whispered, arching into Draco’s touch.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” Harry said as cordially as he could. The blond didn’t say a word but nodded. “I’d like a packet of Maltesers and a packet of Jelly Babies.”
Perhaps this isn’t as one-sided as Harry thought.
“The whole situation has been a little fucked up, to say the least. But I remember it all, and I don’t want things to go back to how they used to be before the war.”
He lifted his wand to his temple and began the incantation. Immediately, warmth flooded his body—his extremities tingled. He shivered as the first memory began to work itself free, feeling like spaghetti slipping through a colander as it pulled towards his wand.
“It’s for your own good, Harry. You’re not well.”
Harry smiles, warm and reassuring. “Relax, love. I cast an Impervius Charm on the floor.”
is an allegory for LSD—that’s a Muggle drug.”
“I hope you had a good sleep.” Her voice was calm and syrupy-sweet. The cat flap opened, and Petunia pushed through a bowl of tomato soup, a grilled cheese sandwich, and a cup of tea.
But before he got the chance, bells chimed.
put a tie in there) before he gave up. He had a spare. It wasn’t part of his official uniform, but a Slytherin tie would be close enough.
“Harry, you have to focus.”
“Draco,” he said. “We’ve never been friends, and I don’t intend to start now. But what we had together, I want that. With you.”
“This is serious,” Draco snapped, resisting the urge to hex the vile cow. They were out in the open in a Muggle neighbourhood. “He needs help, more help than what a Muggle doctor can provide.” Petunia scowled, but Draco pressed onward. “He needs to go to St. Mungo’s, the wizarding hospital.”
06 August 1998
Dumbledore nodded and waved his arm. “Then think of home, and so it shall be.”
Inside the cupboard, Harry took Draco’s hand in his. “Come with me. I’ll take you someplace better.”
Draco coughed. “I’ve heard of it.” He dug his knuckles into Hermione’s arch.
All because he was selfish. He should have acted sooner, and maybe Harry wouldn’t be in this much trouble.
Except it’s difficult. Malfoy’s nipples. Were they always so pebbled? So hard? They must have been. Harry realizes the room is a little drafty. Malfoy must be cold, and that’s why his nipples are hard. Discreetly, Harry sends a wandless Warming Charm in his direction.
Harry staggered to his feet, and in three strides was at the door. He yanked on the handle—it wouldn’t budge. He rattled it, then pounded on the door.
like you,” she spat with vehemence.
For the second time that day, I grab Malfoy’s wrist and Apparate us away.
“What’s all this?” he asked when he’d found his voice. Surely they weren’t all for him? One or two gifts were more than sufficient. Unless he was finally about to learn about the extended family that Petunia refused to discuss. Or perhaps he had some friends after all?
What the fuck did that mean?
She stopped talking when Draco cast the diagnostic spells. She stepped forward to examine the magnified version of the vortex. “What is that?” She cast spells to highlight portions and examine the drain from Harry’s magical core.
She looked at him sternly. “Draco, this is a major violation of countless hospital guidelines. We should take him to St. Mungo’s straight away.”
Harry’s resistance shifted to acquiescence.
“Look at those soulless eyes. Do you think it’s been watching us this entire time?”
Harry and Hermione make their way back to their seats. Malfoy hasn’t moved an inch, but Harry thinks he sees a slight smirk on his face. He must have imagined it though because when he looks again, it’s gone.
The woman swayed on the spot as though she might collapse, then steadied herself by gripping the nearest chairback. “What are you doing here?”
“That’s good to hear. He was miserable at home. His mum’s a piece of work.”
Draco stepped into the bath and lowered his body into the water with a contented sigh.
I decide to follow them... just to be sure Harry isn’t in trouble. I slip into Lord Bottomsworth’s portrait—he’s always asleep in his chair; it must be tiring to be
“Mmm… Finished for the day, love?” Harry asked.
“I have no idea.” Quite frankly, Harry didn’t care. He spelled the curtains closed. “Now, where were we?”
Harry’s eyes met Hermione’s. “Hmmm, reveal myself to wizarding Britain by attending a Ministry-sanctioned fundraiser. No, thank you.” Draco’s tongue circled Harry’s rim, and Harry felt the vibrations as the git chuckled.
“I’m surprised you didn’t just Hocus-Pocus it back together.”
Harry flopped back onto his bed, but sleep wouldn’t come. His heart was soaring high from the euphoria of kissing and touching Draco, of shared breaths as they panted together towards their release. Harry craved more; wanted to feel Draco pressed against him, wanted to taste him.
“Well, in theory, what would you say if a witch or wizard was experiencing repeated headaches, but nothing showed up on the Muggle scans?”
“It’s hard to explain, but it’s him.”
Harry sits back and exhales. What a bloody waste. Fifty galleons and nothing, barely a twinge in his gut. He siphons the shimmery vapour into the bottle and labels it ‘
Harry aimed a wandless Stasis Charm in the oven’s general direction. Fire flared in Draco’s eyes.
“Are you all right, Harry?”
A loud
Draco’s mouth quirked into a grin. “Typical. Get in here. And bring the
Hermione raised her wand to Harry’s forehead, but Draco placed his hand on hers. “Let me.”
With a shaky breath, he takes a step back. And then another. Before he turns to leave, he says,
“Are you all right?” he asked.
Harry lathered his hair with shampoo and massaged circles into his scalp to relieve the tension.
“I just saved our arses,” I huff. I’m sticky, wet, and not in the mood for any of his shit today. “You can thank me later.”
—to touch him. Borrowing one of Draco’s tricks, Harry casts a nonverbal spell and transfigures the gloves so they are fingerless. The tips of his fingers brush along a chiselled cheekbone, warmer than marble but just as perfect.
“Now I just want to
Tears form in Harry’s eyes as he looks at Draco, his beautiful Draco.
Sirens blared—deep, booming blasts that crescendoed, then gave way to shrill whistles. Harry glanced around. The resort was divided into two sorts—those who casually gathered up their belongings as though this was a routine occurrence, and those who were panicked and weren’t sure what it all meant. Harry and Draco fell into the latter group.
“Look, I’m sorry if I said or did something to upset you.” Harry looked at Draco so earnestly it broke his heart.
Hermione stepped forward and pulled out—was it really? Draco squinted. Yes, it was—Draco’s hawthorn wand. Why was she using his wand instead of her own?
“I know you’re its master. It’s how you repaired Harry’s wand.” Draco sighed, unsure of how much more he wanted to tell her. She would be livid—madder than she already was. “Harry’s been using LSD to help access his memories, only he never believed they were memories because he doesn’t believe in magic.”
Where was the fresh bottle he’d put in last night? Harry glanced around the room. To the untrained eye, nothing was amiss. But things weren’t exactly as he’d left them. Someone had carefully rifled through his room.
Dudders looked up to Vernon—as a young man should—so naturally he took his father’s passing hard. He wouldn’t admit it, not that I blame him, but I could tell. A mother knows these things.
He drove rather than Apparate. If things went poorly, he’d need a long drive along a new route to clear his head. He parked the car and with trepidation approached the Hampstead home. There was a note affixed to the door. Draco’s heart sank.
“You love him,” she said. It wasn’t a question.
Slowly, Malfoy looks him up and down. His eyes rest on Harry’s lips.
Except Harry’s eyes were directed at him, so vibrant and intensely green. When he smiled, his dimple appeared—Draco had never seen it this close—and Draco’s insides melted. And then Harry was leaning forward, his palm resting against Draco’s jaw, and he brushed their lips together. They were kissing—he was kissing Harry Potter! And then he wasn’t. Harry had pulled back, face perplexed and nervous, and Draco realised in his initial shock at being kissed he had not kissed back, had simply remained still and in awe. He quickly remedied his mistake, surging forward and chasing down Harry’s lips, pleased with the soft sigh that escaped those perfect lips as they parted, allowing him entrance. Harry tasted of cigarettes and treacle, and smelled of citrus and sandalwood, a heady combination that made Draco’s head swim and insides combust. Harry sucked Draco’s bottom lip into his mouth and gave it a playful nip; Draco trembled.
“That was him on the phone, wasn’t it?” He took her silence as confirmation. “You can’t keep us apart.”
Tonight Petunia wanted to go out to the pub. Surprised, but accommodating, Harry agreed. They started with a pint each, but when Petunia ordered shots, Harry discreetly switched to soda.
“Good. Then he’ll be normal, permanently. Not a
After another round, a disastrous game of darts, and the unwanted affections of a randy patron, Harry cornered Petunia and ushered her into a taxi.
He paused with the note in hand. The past couldn’t be changed, and it was better to leave it well enough alone. But when it came to Harry Potter, Draco was never one for making good decisions. He carefully opened the delicate bird and gently smoothed out the creases so he could read his tidy script.
“Have you ever done this before?” Draco rasped.
. He’s early, but it’s nearly time. The butterflies grow in his stomach but become overshadowed by something darker, something not so sweet.
He pulled out the small sealed bag. It held two squares, each tab adorned with a technicolour aeroplane like the one on Lenny’s business card. According to Lenny, it was a mix of LSD and MDMA.
Harry, not knowing what else to say, did as he was told. He turned and left.
He needed to find a way to extract Harry’s magic and heal the void.
“Now who’s the child?” Harry replies and pulls Draco closer. They skate down the hallway and it’s like they’re dancing, but on ice.
“Thirsty,” Harry gasped. Draco didn’t think Harry had enough magic left to Apparate again, at least not without resting, so he went to the kitchen to fetch a glass of water and make a cold compress. Draco wondered how this had happened in the first place. Trust Harry Potter to accidentally Apparate.
“There were rumours.”
He left himself detailed notes outlining his plans to study and apply to medical school. He’d lined up a new job for himself at a wine store—he knew plenty about wine.
“I’m sorry, I’m still taking in the details.” Harry wriggled, then cast a non-verbal Sticking Charm to keep Draco’s wandering hands firmly affixed to his arse cheeks. He couldn’t help but smile as Draco tried (in vain) to move.
to protect them from the shards. With a twist of Draco’s wrist, the pieces flew back together.
Harry whines in protest and looks over his shoulder. Draco’s completely wrecked—eyes blown dark, pale skin flushed, hair a sweaty mess. Harry’s cock, painfully hard and aching for release, twitches at the sight and his heart flutters.
Harry snorted and reclaimed the cigarette. “That makes no sense. Why fixate on someone you hate?”
Today I introduced myself to the delightful couple who purchased batty old Mrs Figg’s house. I had to take a moment… They reminded me so much of myself and Vernon.
Harry looks at Draco and a lump forms in his throat. The sneer falls from Draco’s face and he seems so vulnerable. Alone. Defeated. His parents, fresh in their graves; his friendships, each one severed; countless applications, all rejected. Door after door closing in his face. And then another one…
Draco’s eyes widened with alarm; his pale skin dotted with sweat from their coupling. He clutched the blankets, pulled them against his slender frame. Harry looked over to the window and saw a large, puffy bird with vibrant pink plumage. The Fwooper stared at him with the most judgmental expression Harry had ever seen.
“I suppose, you could always imagine he’s still alive, but off living his life with his Muggle relatives.”
He prised up the floorboard and retrieved the bottle. It was nearly empty.
While the owl ate, Draco penned his letter. If he was to sort this out, there was only one person he could ask. She would know better than anyone.
It said ‘
She gripped the wand tighter, as though clinging to a lifeline. This confirmed it for Draco, the reason it seemed familiar—it was Potter’s. Eleven inches, holly, with a phoenix feather core. She wouldn’t have Potter’s wand unless he truly was dead. Except he wasn’t. Was he?
He took a step closer to Draco, and Draco couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe.
had been written by a Muggle who hadn’t been properly Obliviated following an encounter with a rampaging Hungarian Horntail.
“Because of one bad trip?”
Draco held up his wand.
“We haven’t much time,” Draco said, his voice urgent.
But when he awoke, it was to an empty bed.
Petunia had been more than nice about it. Understanding, even. But once again Harry was wrong. He’d seen great kindness, tenderness, in the women in his vision. His mother—Lily.
Draco began thrusting his tongue, in and out, deeper and deeper into Harry’s channel—licking, sucking, tasting—and Harry was losing his mind, not to mention his ability to concentrate. “
The lights flickered again, and Harry stirred. “W’as happen’ng?” he said, his voice thick with sleep.
Hermione, with obvious excitement, rushed to fill him in. “You’re all right. We’re at my parents’ house.”
“Harry, we don’t know how it might be affecting you, or your ability to get your memories back. I still feel tingly all over.”
“Robards knew what preschool the wee lad attends.” He ruffles Scorpius’ hair and smiles.
, but thought better of it—“normal person ever since. No Magic.”
“Kreacher is going to murder us.
“You feel it?”
Draco met her eyes. “It’ll work, I know it will. We have the Elder Wand—its power.”
“I promised Teddy a white Christmas, and as you can see, the weather didn’t cooperate.”
their
“This is delicious.” Draco swallowed a mouthful of wine, which accompanied the beef beautifully, just as he’d expected.
“And they just let you take him?” you ask, incredulous, and realise you may need to rethink your choice of preschool.
Harry awoke with a start, his head pounding to the rhythm of the swirling vortex. He knew it was just a nightmare, but the fear gripping him was real. He swallowed; his throat was dry. His t-shirt and boxers clung to him through a layer of sweat. He looked at the clock and saw it was nearly noon. He’d overslept again.
“Where is it?” she hissed.
A calm voice, amplified by a Sonorous Charm, filled the resort compound.
The House-Elf, dressed in a red Santa-inspired tuxedo, complete with a white beard, skates into the dining room while whistling Celestina Warbeck’s
The green follows you into your dreams. It’s supposed to be Dreamless Sleep, but you dream anyway. You look into green eyes and outstretch your hand, but it’s rejected. Pain. Sorrow. Endless frustration. Heat. Flames. You wrap your arms around him tightly. The scene shifts and everything is white. Peacocks roam the grounds. A wedding cake stacked high. Stori looks so beautiful and laughs as she shoves cake into your mouth. You laugh too. But walls form around you, grey stone, cold, hopeless. Your father, trapped within the walls, is soulless, his face gaunt, hollow, and it’s the last time you see him alive. The next is at his funeral, his body heavily glamoured so he looks like his former self. A pale hand rests in yours and feels like an anchor. The scene shifts again and you’re overjoyed. A small, pale-haired, rosy-cheeked bundle rests in her arms and you can’t believe how lucky you are. But it doesn’t last. Her smile fades, her pale, thin frame wastes away, and then there’s a bejewelled hand in yours keeping you afloat. Everything steadies, but then there’s more pain because you remember. Even in your dreams, you remember she’s gone. Then you remember the green eyes that stared into yours as sleep pulled you under.
Malfoy steps closer. “And now?”
“Are you sure you’re all right?”
Harry went to make it for her, but she insisted on making a cup for both herself and Harry. He went to set out the rubbish bin for collection instead. When he came back, he found her fast asleep with her head on the table, cigarette nearly burned down to her fingers. He stubbed it out, then carried her upstairs, laid her down in bed, took off her shoes, and covered her with a blanket.
“There was a brochure in the Quibbler.” Harry summoned it from his bag. “See, it looks beautiful. Sandy beaches, cabanas. ‘Tranquility on a silver platter.’ I thought it would be perfect. Luna said she had a fabulous time here.”
“Yes—
“Are you ready, Harry?” Draco whispered against Harry’s temple. When he felt a small nod, Draco Disapparated, just as Petunia lunged forward and shrieked, “Don’t leave me!”
“You only cast Impervius on the floor?” Harry, the infuriating git, merely shrugs. “What about the wainscoting? The mahogany is irreplaceable, harvested from the Goblin Forest. The one recently destroyed by Muggles. I’m sure you remember the exposé in the
Harry had visited Draco at work on Friday—Jess had given Draco a knowing wink when she saw them coming out of the loo red-faced and sweaty. They’d gone out for pints with his coworkers. Draco only had one, then he’d driven Harry home. But he wished he could have brought Harry back to his flat instead. Petunia, however, was expecting him.
“Speed up the magical drain. I know. We did LSD together—don’t give me that look—and that’s how I found out how it affects wizards. But I also had a clear re-play of the final battle. The Dark Lord’s defeat. You disarmed him, and the Elder wand became yours. I saw it.”
Potter rose as well. “Draco, I remember how much you cared for me. You helped me when no one else did. You fought for me and never gave up. And you never once judged me.”
Harry didn’t know how long they slept, but when he woke up, he felt completely relaxed. Delightfully sated, warm, tingly, enveloped by safety and love—he loved Draco Malfoy. He couldn’t believe how easily Draco had let the words slip from his lips. It had been so simple to say them back. The sex, being as close as two people can get, was phenomenal—everything he could ever want.
Harry cancelled the Sticking Charm and turned. “You arse. You’re absolutely incorrigible.” He pulled Draco into a searing kiss, tasting himself on his lips.
She raised her eyebrows. “All right, then. What would you like to know?”
. He also advised Harry to drop the LSD directly into his eye for faster results.
“At first, I wanted to feel something else. Something… not horrible.”
But Harry still had no clue what it meant. He had no recollection of writing, but he must have done, because his hand felt tired and cramped.
Hermione’s hair whipped in the gale-force winds; she nodded. The bed shook, but they maintained their positions on either side. Their eyes met, and in unison, they began the incantation.
“Pardon?” Draco asks.
“I’m still cross with you.”
There were still many blanks, a myriad of things Draco didn’t think he’d ever understand. He’d read the interview Granger provided the Prophet in the weeks following the war; his mother had sent him a copy, back when he still opened her letters. Potter had sacrificed himself. They’d never recovered his body—it was forever lost to the Forbidden Forest. But somehow his death made the Dark Lord mortal. He’d offered himself up so they all might live.
Dudley’s still gone.
Their drinks arrived topped with those little paper umbrellas that amused Draco so much, and the food looked divine: skewers of coconut chilli prawns; grilled oysters on the half shell with spicy mango salsa; bruschetta topped with pineapple, mango, and ceviche; crispy calamari rings; and watermelon, mint, and feta salad drizzled with balsamic glaze.
“It’s not because of you. It’s me, my past. I’ve done things I’m not proud of.”
“You’ll find another friend, Harry. A better friend.”
Harry calmly walked out into the foyer and over to the cupboard under the stairs. Somehow, he knew he’d find a dustpan there. What he didn’t understand, though, was why he shuddered as he opened the small door. Inside he found an odd assortment of items: an old cot with moth-eaten blankets, old toys (all broken), a small assortment of rabbit-eared books with broken spines, as well as various discarded household items. Harry took a deep breath. The cupboard held unwanted items, normal things to cast aside over the years, yet filled him with inexplicable dread. He snatched the dustpan and returned to the living room, where he knelt and swept up the broken glass. He’d have to give it a good wipe-down later to clean up the sticky traces of whisky.
“But you… You’re—”
“Don’t you dare.” Draco smirks, and there’s a wicked gleam in his eye. “Allow me.” He pulls his wand from his holster and Harry feels a ripple of magic—fiery and intent—around his crotch, followed by a breeze. Harry looks down; Draco’s transfigured his flying trousers into arseless chaps. Harry’s completely on display for Draco’s viewing pleasure. If his ardent expression is anything to go by, Draco is exceptionally pleased by his spellwork—he looks like a Kneazle with a saucer of cream.
“Harry, I’m ready for you. I need you.”
He turns around, kisses Draco, sucks on his bottom lip and savours the tiny sigh that escapes Draco’s mouth. Harry rolls his hips and Draco groans, low, deep, and pulls Harry tightly against him. Yes, things are going according to plan. If he can just keep Draco distracted for a few hours, then maybe they won’t have to go at all.
“Can I at least call Draco? He’ll worry if he doesn’t hear from me.”
Diddy acted like nothing was wrong. As though Vernon was just away on an extended business trip. Then my sweet, impressionable boy started hanging out with a new crowd. He’d stay out all night, and when he came home, he reeked of alcohol and cigarettes and Lord-knows-what-else.
—. Dirty, unclean, unholy
“You’ll stay for tea first.”
When last at Privet Drive, he took a good, hard look at the cupboard under the stairs with the sturdy bolt lock. When he encountered Petunia, it was like two ships passing in the night. He knew she despised him, but would continue to tolerate him so long as there was no
And then he flew away for real.
25 August 1998
“Because it might be, Harry. When you get your memory back, there’s a good chance you’ll want nothing to do with me.”
“You don’t?”
Harry crept down the hallway and entered Petunia’s room. He looked around—there was a vanity topped with a photo of her and Vernon, another with her, Vernon and Dud, and a new photo of her and Harry at the museum. Everything was orderly, not an item out of place. Harry wasn’t sure where to start, but he had to do something. He went to the chest of drawers, opened the top drawer, and immediately wished he hadn’t—his aunt’s knickers were not something he needed seared into his brain. He quickly searched the other drawers, trying hard not to look at the brassieres and stockings, and then moved on to the wardrobe. A small box on the top shelf caught Harry’s eye, and he carefully brought it down. Inside, he found a book.
“I do.”
up just in time. The snowball explodes against the invisible shield, and Draco can’t help but laugh. They both look at Teddy, who’s grown bored with all the grown-up talk, and is attempting to skate unassisted.
Hermione gives him a warm, reassuring smile. She already has her pencils all lined up in order from 2H to 8B along with her eraser and smudger. Harry smiles in return and sharpens his pencil. He just has the one, and that’s only because Hermione reminded him to bring one.
“You look beautiful,” Harry said. Hermione wore a floor-length lace gown in navy blue, with her hair styled into a sleek updo. She brought a hand to her waist—her engagement ring sparkled.
“Potter, you idiot,” Malfoy snarls.
“No matter what happens, I want you to know I love you.” He tipped up Harry’s chin and pressed a tender kiss to his mouth, savouring the taste and feel of those soft lips.
Hermione bit her lip, and glanced at the door.
It worked. Harry was alive and out of danger. He was himself again.
Draco places his hand on the small of Harry’s back and guides him down the hallway and into the conservatory. He has an enormous smile on his face, which Harry can’t help but return. “This is
Pleasure intensifies and pools in Harry’s gut like molten lava, and when Draco pulls him down extra hard, slamming into that tender bundle of nerves, he can’t hold back. Harry cries out as he comes harder, more spectacularly, than he has in a long time. Ribbons of come splash across Draco’s perfect suit. Draco moans, then shudders, and Harry kisses him gently through his orgasm, as they rock together.
“Sorry for sleeping so late.”
Draco startled, and Jess chuckled as she entered the ticket booth.
I took the boy to see Dr Vaughn today, because I’m a good person, and it needed to be done. Never let it be said that I didn’t perform my duty.
She took another bite, chewing thoughtfully. The silence extended, and Draco felt the urge to fill it with… anything else.
“Do you really believe that?”
“You’re a strange creature.”
Draco swallowed. “Earlier, I performed a transfer—he would have died without it.” He buttered his cake without looking up at Hermione.
“It’s you,” she said. Two simple words, yet injected with such venom. Harry wondered why she’d be angry to see him if he lived there.
“Dudley’s happier now, is he?” Lenny asked.
Tentatively, he steps out into the hallway and almost does the splits. He grabs hold of the railing to steady himself and casts a weak Sticking Charm to the bottom of each slipper. It’s enough to keep his feet from going out from under him.
While Draco didn’t trust his family and didn’t entirely trust himself, he found one thing he could depend on for making decisions. He’d ask himself, what would Lucius Malfoy do? Then, he’d do the opposite.
And that was the problem, wasn’t it? The Mark was a part of Draco, part of who he was. Part of the Wrong Side. He was the one who had done as he was told and didn’t stand up for what was right. And now he was taking advantage of Harry, serving his own needs instead of helping Harry. Draco always did the wrong thing.
They looked at each other, eyes locked without blinking, before Harry continued.
At the Apparition Point, he casts
“Off you go, Artemis. I’ve nothing to send.” He urged the owl outside, and she left with a ruffle of feathers and an indignant hoot. With a heavy heart he added the letter, unopened, to the growing pile. There was nothing more she could possibly say. Father was in Azkaban, where he belonged, and his mother’s letters were all varied versions of her begging him to come home, dangling rewards like jewels in front of a dragon, gilded promises if he’d just return. But there was nothing that could make him go back. Not now—not ever. He would keep the chocolates though; they were his favourite.
“Once. Whispered by Bellatrix. It’s not something to be dabbled in—very Dark Magic. Are you telling me the Dark Lord created a Horcrux?”
It had been a mistake for Draco to merge his worlds. The cinema reminded him of Potter, and Jess often asked after him. He gave his notice, but his heart hung heavy. He had no family, and now he’d have no friends. Despite the odds, Kirk had grown on him. But Jess… he’d miss her most of all.
“I see. But if a wizard were to become ill while living as a Muggle—and don’t give me that look, I swear I’m not talking about me—then Muggle medicine would be of no use?”
“After you, Potter.”
He’d known this was the likely outcome, and maybe it’s what he deserved. For his part in the war, for everything after. But still, he’d hoped.
Harry inhaled deeply. The ocean air was invigorating, the glittery sand between his toes felt divine, and Draco looked positively edible in his tiny red speedo. He was smiling even, their odd morning encounter washed away with brunch mimosas. Harry felt hopeful. Surely their rocky start (how was he to know the five-star restaurant was overrun by tiny dragons that stole the silverware?) was behind them and things could only get better from here.
. Have a good evening, Harry. Draco.” The green flames flickered out.
“Draco?”
When they eventually pull apart, Draco looks wrecked: his skin, deeply flushed; his hair, tousled; his shirt, horribly wrinkled. Harry’s sure he doesn’t look much better. Draco casts
“So, Potter’s wand was indeed broken. But you have it now, and it’s whole?”
Draco summons his fuzzy green dragon slippers, the matching hooded dragon robe, and pulls them on. They’re gauche and not befitting of a Malfoy, but Draco wears them anyway because they make Teddy smile. Definitely not because they’re warm and cosy.
“Potter-Malfoy,” Harry replied, then winced as Draco pulled the thread taut. A wave of Draco’s magic washed over him and Harry relaxed as the Freezing Charm took effect. Draco continued his work with precision.
Harry lumbered down the hallway to the loo. He turned on the shower, then examined himself in the mirror. Though the dark circles under his eyes suggested a restless night, his skin was flawless, and his cheeks were rosy. But who was he, really?
Malfoy steps up onto the round platform and casually lets his robe slip to the ground. He adopts a pose, and Harry’s jaw drops. Draco Malfoy is a work of art.
. Draco’s magic, floral and delightfully tingly, washed over Harry, and the apron became Slytherin green. “Brings out your eyes.” He winked at Harry, and when Harry looked down, the apron said,
“You’re wearing too much clothing,” Draco murmurs, his lips grazing the shell of Harry’s ear.
“Already done. Had a CT scan, an MRI, the works. The doctors declared me perfectly healthy… well, except for the memory thing.”
Draco faltered. He wanted—Merlin, how much he wanted to plunge into Harry’s hot, tight arse, and Harry was offering it to him. But Harry couldn’t know what he was asking, because he didn’t remember all the awful things Draco had done. Draco Malfoy had tirelessly made fun of Harry Potter for having dead parents, had stomped on Harry’s nose and left him on the train, had let Death Eaters into the castle to cause destruction, and done unspeakable things at their command. Harry Potter would never ask for this if he knew the truth.
. There were many things Muggles could see and diagnose that wizards could not. For example, the Greengrass family carried a Blood Curse, a malediction passed down from generation to generation, but they never knew which child the curse would affect until it was too late. If they had access to genetics, perhaps they could predict in advance who carried the gene and prevent the illness from taking hold.
“All right.”
. It looked just like the one Hermione caught when she disarmed the Dark Lord during the final battle.
“What’s this?” he asked.
Harry shuddered as Draco continued to thrust deeper, spit dribbling from his hole, trailing down his leg.
, they landed in Hermione’s backyard. Draco held Harry as he retched into the bushes. He eyed him with concern—Harry was worse than he’d expected. If he’d have known, he would have driven rather than risk Apparition. But Petunia’s appearance had forced his hand and they’d barely escaped. Draco steadied Harry and guided him to the open door.
She looked around, and once she was certain they were alone, she continued in harsh, hushed tones. “You cast a spell on him. I know you did.”
Maybe Draco was right—he didn’t know what the LSD was doing to his body. Perhaps he should have tried harder with meditation. But it was just so hard, and the LSD was too tempting. The images brought forth were so vivid and disjointed, though they couldn’t possibly be real. Except, he’d seen his mother… and everything Harry experienced felt so right. Better than good, it felt like home. But so did Draco, and he would be so disappointed in Harry right now.
Harry brought Draco’s inner arm to his lips and kissed the Dark Mark, ran his tongue along the sinuous snake. The simple act should have been erotic but seemed sacrilegious—wrong in so many ways.
The use of his last name stings.
to ensure he’s alone—one can never be too careful where the
Draco’s job at the cinema wasn’t a necessity—a visit to Gringotts connected his vault to a Muggle bank so he could withdraw Muggle currency—but it was something he enjoyed. It gave him ample opportunity to observe and interact with Muggles (they were nothing like what his parents—or the Dark Lord—had told him) and he genuinely liked films. They were just like wizarding photographs, but instead of an endless loop, they continued onwards and told the full story. It was also fun to see wizarding influences on Muggle culture. He strongly suspected
“The trees?”
. Its intended use was to steal—not give—magic, but Draco worked the wand movement in reverse. Threads of shimmery gold, followed by silver, regal purple, emerald, sapphire, and bronze, rose like tendrils of smoke, stretching from Draco’s chest to Harry’s. Draco closed his eyes. He’d woven in an automatic
“Hilarious, Potter,” Draco grumbled.
, echoed throughout his mind—he’d waited forever to hear those words; never expected them to be spoken. Harry Potter, with his memories intact, would never have said them, not to Draco Malfoy. Was Draco brave enough to tell him the truth?
He screamed. He shouted. He pounded on the door.
For the first time, Harry recognised how vulnerable he was.
Well, I know why.
It was time. Together, they grasped the Elder Wand and focused on channelling the storm, directing it at Harry, willing it to re-enter his body. As the magic swirled downward, the memories played out, reverberating around the room. From misty green tendrils came a cold, shrill voice.
. That was one of the few times Draco had wished he still carried a wand. But no, hexing his Muggle boss wasn’t a good idea—that was something his father would do.
“Not just one—seven.”
“In the Room of Hidden Things?” He looked at Hermione and she nodded. “The Fiendfyre destroyed it.”
’ he’d felt when walking towards the living tree or traipsing through the dense forest with the kaleidoscope of colours. He could taste the sweet, floral aroma… “Honeysuckle and lavender,” he whispered, then shuddered as a jolt of pleasure rocked through him.
