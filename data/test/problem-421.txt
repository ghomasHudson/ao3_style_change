Harry tried to keep his expression neutral. He had no idea what Draco’s intentions were. Hell, he had no idea what his own intentions were.
“A rolling pin?! Potter are you trying to insult me. This is real bamboo.” He started tapping it on pressure points on Harry’s back.
As Draco stilled and gasped for air Harry shoved him onto his back, grabbing the back of his head and pushing it towards his cock. Draco opened his lips and sucked eagerly.
“Let’s get out of here. Draco, take care of Potter. We’ll get rid of these two...”
“Please what?”
“I’m a spy for the order.”
“Draco, pleassse.”
They paid the driver and Harry produced his wand to the scanned on the door.
“Saint fucking Potter,” he sighed wistfully. He trailed off, then moved forward, straddling Harry’s lap in the chair.
Harry grinned. “I’m not sure it would make much difference.”
“Yes! Oh, fuck Potter. Harder.”
Harry couldn’t reply.
“Maybe we should go some time,” Draco purred in his ear. “You wanted to take me out right? We could go to some muggle club, and you could spend the entire night grinding that righteous cock up against my arse.”
“I’ll say it again, Potter, you’re a terrible liar.”
“Damn, Draco.”
“It’s cleansing me!”
“No.”
“How long do you think it’s going to take?” she asked.
The parchment started to wriggle again
“You think you can use it?” Harry asked.
“Oh!” was all Harry managed to say.
“I thought that was what you liked about shagging me?”
She squealed and whipped around with her hands over her eyes.
Draco slid his lips down Harry’s cock, easily taking it to the back of his throat and bobbing his head like nothing Harry’s had ever known.
Harry curled his toes when he felt the tip of Draco’s cock on his arse.
“Where have you been?!” Hermione demanded as he slid in next to her.
The judge was quiet for a few seconds before giving Harry a curt nod.
Potter kissed him hard and Draco’s groaned into his mouth. Potter’s kisses sent shivers down his spine. They were rough and passionate, and possessive enough to make Draco weak at the knees. Draco grabbed hold of the bars and lifted himself up, wrapped his legs round Potter’s waist. Potter grabbed his arse, pulling Draco’s hips against his and grinding their hard cocks together.
He shook his head at himself at his sheer stupidity. This job was everything to him. Usually he was the epitome of good professional behaviour. Malfoy just irked something in him. Something far below the surface, that made him forget who he was, that he was in fact an adult, and would be facing something much worse than detention if he got caught pounding the shit out of Malfoy during office hours.
“You know, muggles like to make a fire and heat up baked beans.”
“You could at least give me a little foreplay before we start choking each other.”
Harry tried to gasp in vain, his head spinning, adrenaline through the roof, his eyes rolled back into his head, trying to scream against Malfoy’s hand. Harry could swear he was floating. He was light headed, higher and harder than he’d ever been in his life.
Ron caught him as he fell towards the floor. Grief consumed him. His parents. His godfather. His mentor. His lover. All they had lost. All they still had left to lose.
“Pervert. There! Oh Potter there. Get your dick and put it right there.”
Harry thought his heart might explode out his chest it was thudding so hard.
“That better sweetie? Feel better full of cock you slut?”
“Wasn’t so bad, was it?” Draco soothed, coming to stand behind him and massage his shoulders.
Harry sighed.
“Malfoy. You keep doing that I’m going to come in my pants.”
“Yes! Fuck Potter yes. That’s so good.”
Draco nodded to them both as he left.
Harry still didn’t understand why they had to get there so early, or go half way across the country for a stake out. Surely there were officers closer who could take this job. Either way Harry was reluctant to drag himself out of bed on a cold January morning to go sit in a tent with Draco fucking Malfoy.
The green light burst from Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore in the chest. The green light lit up his pale face for a second, a frozen wrinkled death mask, before he dropped to the floor. The paralysis spell released and Harry fell to the floor. Draco was the only one that looked down. Harry couldn’t read his expression. All he saw was that he was shaking, before a dark cloaked arm wrapped round him and guided him away.
“Are you sure this isn’t a proposal?”
Harry couldn’t breathe. Draco rubbed something slick on Harry’s cock lifted himself up and then. Then Harry’s world as he knew it ended.
Harry nodded violently. He wanted everything he could get.
“Hello,” Potter said quietly, probably very aware of all the eyes on them, on all the clientele that we finding excuses to come closer and closer to their cage.
Harry bit his lip as he watched Draco squirm as he fucked him slowly with his fingers.
“You don’t like it?”
“Three.”
“It does.” Harry felt a twist of nostalgia for the Weasley’s warm family glow. The cheer and love in that tent. He missed it. He made a mental note to go and see them soon when he got back.
Harry ended up with a prawn mayonnaise sandwich and a packet of salt and vinegar crisps. It reminded him of terrible school trips when the Dursleys ‘forgot’ to pack him something and the schoolteacher had to give him whatever they could find for under 3 quid.
Draco grinned at him. Like a lion grinning at his dinner. He poured oil onto his hands and wrapped them both round Harry’s hard cock and slowly stroked him up and down, circling his fingers over the head as he reached the top.
Draco moved his hand to grip Harry’s neck, the other still wrapped round Harry’s cock.
“Sorry.” He took his hand away.
“Did you mean what you said about Hermione and Ron being swapped? They’re not going to kill them?”
“Thank you.”
“Mmm, Potter, that’s better, you remember how to behave...”
“I don’t know. It kind of looks like a leopard.”
Light exploded in Harry’s head as he came violently. Draco held him up against the wall tight by his neck all through his spasm and tremors, seemingly unconcerned by the cum that came from Harry in endless threads, covering Draco’s trousers.
“It’s a beautiful night.”
Draco gasped, keeping himself perfectly still.
“Come on, Potter, don’t keep me waiting...I have better sluts I could go to, you know and they’re much better behaved...”
“Soppy twat.” He slid another finger inside him and Harry groaned.
Harry stuck his fingers up at him and chucked him the binoculars. Draco caught them and they shuffled round each other in the tent.
“Hmm…what shall I do with you? You’ve been such a good boy.”
“Well. May as well get some sleep if we’re stood down.”
Harry’s insides relax in relief.
“He’s still more polite to me than the Death Eaters.”
Draco’s hard body against his own was surpassing everything he’d imagined. The smell of the sweat on Malfoy’s skin from their scuffle was making Harry light headed. He wanted to push his face into Draco’s neck to inhale him deeper.
“You’ll keep going till you do.” The hint of threat in Draco’s voice made him shudder.
Harry blushed, despite there being no one there to see. He’d never touched himself like that before.  Draco always did it.
“Please, please...”
“We’ll get out of here tomorrow, better safe than sorry, we can go to the burrow,” Harry said.
“Fuck...fuck...fuck...” Harry was crying out with every stroke now, tossing and turning on the bed but the thing gave him no mercy, just kept up it’s relentless rhythm. Draco grinned.
“Buy me a drink first.”
“Is there a problem?” Sally asked, looking between the two of them as they continue to stare at each other.
Draco scraped his wet hair back as best he could and Harry laughed.
“Got to work for it, Potter.” Draco slapped him on the thigh. “Get your morning workout.”
“Hermione…” Harry started before realising he had no idea what to say.
“I am not going to one of the teachers and telling them Malfoy spiked me with a love potion. It was bad enough telling you!”
“Right, that’s enough for today everyone.”
“Jesus fuck,” was all Harry could manage.
As Harry sat down and laced his boots back up Draco disappeared into his bedroom. He wondered what on earth he was doing until he came back with a silver shirt and set of plain black robes. More subtle that the dress robes he’d worn to the party.
Harry’s head dropped back against the wall with a loud clunk. He was going to have to skip potions.
Harry was shaking underneath him already, his body remembered Draco, welcomed the intrusion of his long fingers.
“Fuck. Oh fuck.”
Harry rolled his eyes.
“Painfully?”
“We’re all human beings. And we’re all going to die if this doesn’t work.”
“But effective. If I hadn’t told you.”
“More.”
Harry grinned.
Malfoy took Harry’s hand and put it to the significant bulge in his trousers.
“No. I just wanted to see.” Harry left it at that, failing to put into words what he wanted.
“Help!”
They walked to the shack with the prices scrawled on a chalkboard but found it empty.
“Only if you promise to take the spell off.”
Draco was stroking his side, smiling almost lovingly at him as he started to scream, the thing still growing bigger inside him. Draco curled himself around behind him, wrapping his arms round his waist and holding him still; feeling him shaking in his arms, still stroking his side.
The tears of laughter in Malfoy’s eyes made Harry realise Malfoy was telling the truth. Harry flushed deep red and grabbed his invisibility cloak, ready to bring it up over himself and hide in it for the rest of the year.
“And I’m sure they’ll forgive you eventually, Potter, you could tell them it was a love potion.” Draco walked over to the bed and knelt down next to him and stroked a finger down his cheek. “You could even tell yourself it was a love potion that made you say what you did...you were always an expert in denial...” He kissed him on the lips. “Come on, Potter, let’s go.”
Harry spluttered and tried to put his hardening cock down to the warmth of their sleeping bags. Draco grabbed a fist full of Harry’s hair and kissed him hard.
“What the hell do you want, Potter?”
Harry moved faster, snapping his hips back and forth, moaning and gasping as he did. It felt deeper like this, somehow, with all his weight pushed down on Draco’s cock.
“Husband. Would be better for me I think.”
He groaned.
“In your dreams.” He pulled out a book and started to read, happily sipping at his coffee like he spent every weekend relaxing on a muggle train.
Harry nodded.
“I think it’s your turn to be patient.”
“Can I pick the restaurant?”
It did feel better. It felt like every bit of tension he’d ever held in his back had been released. He didn’t want to tell Draco that though.
The toy grew and began to fuck him pointedly.
“There, that’s it right?” Draco pointed to a road sign for the campsite.
“It’s called bravery. “
Hermione’s face contorted as she tried to conceal her laughter.
“Ask the weasel, he locked me down here.”
Harry tried not to splutter.
“Yes. You want to do it?”
They both nodded solemnly.
“Now, as Mr Malfoy has no one willing to represent him…”
Harry’s always quite liked Scotland, but then it’s never rained sideways in his face before.
“Yes, it was nice to have a night off potion brewing.”
“That was wonderful, thank you.”
“Oh!”
“I was just posting an owl.”
Draco tipped his head forward.
Harry cried out as it began to vibrate inside his arse.
Seeing Malfoy at a muggle train station carrying half a tent was pretty bewildering. Harry had to admit Malfoy was blending in better than he’d expected, wearing dark blue jeans, walking boots (Harry was surprised to see these had some wear on them) a slate grey fleece and a dark green waterproof coat. He had a black knitted beanie pulled down over his platinum hair. The tent was packed in a ruck sac. He carried a steaming take away cup of what Harry imagined was coffee.
Harry gave in. Something inside him cracked. It didn’t shatter, be didn’t break, but he knew the first crack had appeared in his resolve. His sanity.
“Untouchable. Desired by all. Forbidden fruit. All the best things.”
“Think you’re up to fucking me Potter?”
“I’m sorry.”
Draco threw him a charming grin.
meet…”
Every time Draco moaned Harry’s hips flicked forward of their own accord. Draco moaned. The cycle built until Harry was fucking Draco hard, drowning in the heat around his cock and Draco’s moans in his ear.
“I thought she’d been glaring at me even more than usual today.”
“Shut it.”
“What?” Malfoy yelped indignantly. Harry just gave him a look and nodded to Hermione to carry on.
Harry nearly fell off the seat. The bounds on his wrists came undone.
“Malfoy! I could have— “
Hermione yawned as they sat down on the floor of the girl’s bathroom with their cauldron. Harry was wide awake, happy occupy the hours between midnight and 6am with something other than explicit dreams about Malfoy. He didn’t even know he knew the things he was dreaming about. How the ideas of all the different ways men could fuck had made it into his brain he had no idea. He assumed it was the potion.
“Yes!” he yelled, aware that he was causing their audience to leer and call him all array of dirty names.
Draco gave him a knowing smile. They pulled up outside the flat. He supposed he’d at least managed to have a slight conversation with Draco. Draco stumble slightly as he got out the car. At least he wasn’t the only tipsy one.
Harry couldn’t form words. Enjoy wasn’t the one he wanted. He wasn’t aware it was possible to feel so exhilarated and satisfied, yet so ashamed and humiliated at the same time.
Malfoy held his wrist up and shook them and Harry heard the metal clink. Harry was speechless for a second, trying to make sense of the situation, and trying to adjust to being back in Malfoy’s presence again.
Draco’s mouth twitched.
The Death Eater looked perplexed as his wand crumbled to dust in his fingers. Harry had a second to enjoy the indignation on his face before Malfoy snapped his head back against the Death Eater’s face. The Death Eater searching Harry span round and Harry yanked the wand from his hand. He petrified them both and Malfoy got up from where he’d been beating his Death Eater to a pulp on the floor.
Harry groaned, pushing into Draco’s hand.
Draco was quiet for a moment.
“Okay?”
Harry gasped as he felt Draco push a finger roughly inside him, he tried to lean back onto him for support but Draco stepped back, having none of it.
“You have no idea. How hard is that lovely cock of yours?” He pulled on Harry’s hair when he failed to reply. “Tell me.”
Harry stared, speechless.
“Now.”
Draco arched his back the moaned as Harry pushed back into him, hard and slick.
Two steps. Swift and decisive. A swish of a black cloak.
“We should probably bring them in alive,” Harry drawled.
Harry shrugged.
Harry just smiled.
“Check down stairs first?” Harry said.
“Didn’t get me one then?” Harry nodded to Draco’s coffee.
“I condition my hair!”
Draco pushed forward, fucking him gently, a few inches at first, stretching, prepping.
“Gosh, Potter, you’re in such a bad mood today. You should have taken me up on that offer earlier...you seem stressed.”
“Are these even legal?”
Harry did as instructed and Draco cried out loud. Harry realised he wanted that sound almost as much as he wanted the tight heat around his cock. He did it again and again then flipped Draco onto his back.
The judge frowned and leaned to the side to confer with his colleagues.
“Say thank you, Draco.”
“You are just too delicious, Potter.”
Draco straddled his hips and grinned, grabbing a handful of Harry’s hair.
“You got the tickets?” Draco asked.
“You think I don’t know that?” Draco shouted then closed his eyes and sighed quietly.  “I can’t turn against my family, you wouldn’t understand.”
“I thought I might go to the farmers market tomorrow.”
“What about a wife?”
Harry narrowed his eyes.
“Someone’s been working on that self control,” Draco purred in his ear. “Is it in your bag?”
Draco pointed his wand at him and Harry froze, realising his was on the other side of the room.
“No I’m not hungry, I feel a bit sick... I’ve taken some pain killers... I... “
“What?”
Harry just glared at him.
“Fuck you.”
“Some of them. I’ve never done muggle camping before. I liked wizard camping for the world Cup.”
Harry, love, baby and beautiful were all words Draco never used. It was then Harry realised something was very very wrong. His eyes flew open and he what he saw made him nearly throw up all over Draco’s chest.
He poured them both tea.
After twenty minutes he snapped the book closed in frustration.
“Fuck off.” His scowl sent shivers down Harry’s spine.
The guilt must have shown on his face. Her mouth dropped open as realisation hit. The look of horror on her face made Harry’s insides twist.
“Someone’s talked. There’s more of you traitors lurking then we realise.” He tightened his grip on Draco’s throat. “I knew you when you were just a boy, Draco Malfoy. Oh. Such promise. I wonder when the rot began.”
“What? Dressed appropriately? I’m not a moron, Potter. I have no desire to freeze to death in the Lake District because you can’t control your temper.”
It was the only explanation for the way he seemed to play on his emotions so well. God, he hated him, it had been so long since he’d seen him that he’d happily pushed all thought of him from his mind, buried it deep away inside him. He knew his body was missing him, yearning for him, but he refused to let himself think of him as he got himself off. Still sometimes just as came he swore he could smell the sweet sweat on his body like when they used to fuck, could almost hear him growling in his ear, feel his teeth on his neck, his perfectly manicured nails dragging down his side...
“I’m a Death Eater slut.”
Draco laughed quietly.
He moved faster, harder, letting his body take over. The natural snaps of his hips pushed him hard and deep into Draco’s arse and Draco moaned underneath him.
Harry moved him faster, crying out as the heat pulled him closer, the delicious pressure, the sound of Draco moaning above him every time he pulled him down hard on his cock.
“You keep patronising me, Draco, I’m going to put you through the fucking window...” Harry growled at him.
“Yes, sir.”
“I don’t have one.”
“Yes Captain...Come on, Malfoy. I could use a drink and somewhere with central heating.”
“Malfoy! You can’t,” Harry hissed under his breath, quickly casting a silencing charm around the bed.
“Potter!”
He took the top off, peered inside, then looked back at Harry.
“I love you too, Potter. Go to sleep. I’m gonna give a proper fucking in the morning.”
Harry gave him a death glare.
“Very well. Draco Malfoy, you are sentence to five years service in the ministry under the supervision and mentorship of The Minister of Magic, Harry James Potter.”
“Wait.”
Harry groaned.
“You close sweetheart?”
“Harry Potter. Saviour of the wizarding world. Can’t cook. Nothing without his PA.”
“Kneel down in between my legs.”
“My ankles are tied.”
He stood with his wand in hand, ready to do what was necessary. The Death Eaters were backing off though, this wasn’t their final attack. This was just to remove Dumbledore. Take hold of the school from within. The real battle would come later.
Harry tried not to shriek.
“He might! He’s up to something. I know he is!”
Potter knocked the stool out the way and grabbed the back of Draco’s head, steadying him as he nearly over balanced. Draco ripped off Potter’s trousers, desperate to have his cock in his mouth, to make Potter moan. The bulge had not done it justice. Draco thanked his stars he’d had a lot of practise. He sucked eagerly, taking it to the back of his throat with ease, letting Potter grab the back of his head and fuck his throat. He looked up and groaned at the site of Potter, head back and grinning and he flicked his hips.
They looked around the dungeon, which seemed to be more of an old basement.
“Not much else to do out here is there?”
Harry looked at the pale unmarked skin on Draco’s skin where his Dark Mark would be.
Harry did as he was told.
“Yeah, yeah, ah...” he moaned as the toy stretched him again. He grabbed onto Draco’s hair tight as it pushed hard on his prostate.
“Uhuh. Turn around.”
He handed him a jar.
“Did you know your cheeks burn when you flirt?” Draco had that deadpan expression on his face.
Eventually Malfoy shrugged, smirked, took a gulp of his drink, and walked across the circle. Someone squealed.
Harry shivered underneath him.
“Fuck you, Potter.”
“Apparently I’m your new prisoner, I knew you’d be thrilled...” Malfoy drawled. He clearly thought the sheer idea of it being that way around was hilarious, he could see the amusement glinting in his eyes. He felt like knocking him off his feet but didn’t think it would go down very well with Hermione, especially not after what Ron had done to him already. It definitely wouldn’t go down well with Malfoy, and he knew that with him being here in his house, it would only be a matter of time before they were alone together and he knew he’d make him pay for it. The thought made blood rush to his groin and he snapped his eyes away from him, keeping his mouth shut for the moment. He could tell Malfoy was smirking at him even without looking though, he’d long become convinced that the bloody boy had worked out how to read his mind.
He groaned and his cheeks-tinged pink. The group were looking between them in delight.
“Morgan,” she answered half asleep. “This better be good Potter or-“
The scream had chilled him to the bone. A woman’s. So like his mother’s. He shuddered and tried to refocus. They reached the landing. There were four doors to chose from. One was ajar and Harry could see a dim glow coming from the room.
“How would you know?”
Harry for once didn’t feel inclined to disagree.
Harry tried to look at her like she was the one that was going insane.
“Good. Dinner’s at 7 Draco, I’ll see you then.” He nodded curtly and walked off.
“I bet you could come like this, couldn’t you, Potter?”
Harry groaned as he felt himself come round slightly and realised he could hear the shower running. He thought he’d better go in there really, he was supposed to be watching him after all. Not that he really had a great chance of stopping him if he tried anything, but still. He winced as he felt the afterglow still making his body tingle, it shouldn’t be like this, he shouldn’t like this...
Harry’s breath hitched as Draco pushed something cold into his arse. It felt fairly small, but as Draco continued to pump his cock and bite on his neck it began to grow and swell inside him.
“My hair? My hair was a mess in school.”
Harry blinked at the stark answer. At the only person who’d ever told him they thought he couldn’t do whatever he set his mind to.
“Draco. God. Please.”
Draco picked his wand up again and smiled. Harry hadn’t felt this vulnerable in a long time. It made his cock throb even more.
“Hi,” Harry managed.
She gave him a sly smile and led the way to the library.
“Get on your knees and suck me.”
Harry heard the scrape of Lucius’s chair.
“You gonna behave for me then? Or you still as bratty as you were in school?”
“Alright.” Harry sighed. “Fine I’ll try.”
“No, Potter, you’re just infatuated with me. Very sorry to break the news.”
Draco grinned back at him, all charm and suggestive eyes.
He needed to get back to class. The mental breakdown could wait.
Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
“See you at dinner...I’m glad he’s safe.”
“It’s okay, I’m okay,” he panted.
She nodded.
“He’s fine.”
“Ah! More, Potter,
Harry’s eyes were wide with images he’d never dared to imagine before.
“The strangest of friendships are often struck up at the strangest of times.”
“Keep doing it...harder...”
“Major?” Harry asked after a pause.
“Hope for all of us then.”
Steam was already filling the room and Draco beckoned Harry over to him under the water. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and Harry let out a happy sigh, not caring if Draco mocked him for it, and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. Draco didn’t comment for once and kissed Harry on the side of his head. The held each other under the water, the silence between them saying more than they ever could.
“I’m sorry.” He knew far too well why Draco remembered all the dates that led up to the war so well.
Harry couldn’t speak, so settled on giving Malfoy his best glare. He just laughed at him.
“I bet it’s a swimming pool.”
“We don’t have to do that. We just have to get you out of here.”
“Where are the creatures?” he heard Morgan’s voice.
“Christ. Good night, Potter.”
“Shhh!” he hissed, his eyes darting to the door to make sure his friends hadn’t come back through.
How could Harry ask that of anyone.
Draco walked over to the coffee maker and ran a hand down its side. Harry was sure it purred.
“I can’t stop you,” Hermione said.
Harry squeezed Draco back, despite his protesting body. The last time he’d heard of anyone seeing Draco alive was over a year ago now. They’d got word that Draco’s family had declared him a traitor months ago, but no one had any way of knowing if he was alive or dead, or if it was even true. Blasted to kingdom come, rotting in a dungeon, or sitting with his feet up in the lounge. They’d had no idea. It had taken all of Harry’s self-control not to try and take the Malfoy Manor by himself to find out what had become of his lover. And Hermione’s dissuasion. Mostly the later. She might have held him back a few times.
It was in the furthest cage. Malfoy was crouched down infront of it.
“No? Well...we’ll see about that.”
Harry held Draco down, one hand on his shoulder, one on his hip, and fucked him hard and fast. He was losing control, his body tensed, spasmed and thrust how it wanted, deep and hard into Draco’s willing arse.
“Fuck yes. God.” He moved faster, to Draco’s groaning approval.
“Camping. You know. Muggle thing. Get away for the weekend.”
“Potter, I have no idea what you’re talking about.”
Harry shuddered at the contact, still feeling aftershocks and shivers.
Draco raised his wand.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned, Malfoy’s body weight fully against his own was too much. He flipped Malfoy onto his back and Malfoy wrapped his legs round Harry’s waist, clamping them tight around him.
“How the hell would you know?” Draco spat at him. “You’re just a naïve silly little boy who thinks he can take on Voldemort single handed and save us all. Maybe I don’t want fucking saving.”
“Too soon? Come on, that was years ago!”
“Shh,” Draco whispered and pulled the much enlarged toy out of him.
“Yeah. Yeah, oh.” The buzz on that spot, and the way it slowly stretched him, the ever so slight burn, he squirmed.
“Straddle my lap, fuck yourself on my cock...go on, Potter, ride me...”
“I got some stuff in,” Ron said, “I missed you cooking us breakfast,” he said to Hermione.
“there’s a shower if you want.”
“I’m not moody! I’m just… not exactly enthusiastic about spending the weekend with you in a tent.”
Harry winced. He knew exactly what Draco wanted. He didn’t know why he was resisting. Saying something didn’t necessarily make it true. Maybe it was because it was true. I must not tell lies.
“Ask first.”
He still wasn’t used to how wanted Draco made him feel. Desired. He didn’t understand it, he knew plenty of girls had swooned at him cos he was ‘Harry Potter’. This was different.
“Then don’t. Don’t fight with them. Fight with us.”
“Please, Harry, that’s advanced magic. Even I’d struggle with that.”
“They like your arsehole,” Potter bit his ear lobe. “Shall I ask for a volunteer?”
Draco squeezed harder on Harry’s throat till Harry could barely draw in a breath. Draco lifted him with strength Harry thought he’d couldn’t possibly have. It must be a potion. A spell.
Harry shrugged.
“I don’t know if I can do it.”
“Um...” Harry said, looking at the loaf of bread in his hand, unsure of when he picked it up. “I guess yeah. Do we have anything?”
“Does the Halfblood Prince not have any love potion antidotes scribbled in the margins?” she drawled.
Harry rolled his eyes.
He ran down the rest of the stairs then walked cautiously over.
“Your coffees going cold.”
“Mmm, say please?”
Malfoy stood on the stand, looking resigned to the inevitable, leaning his forearms on the gold filigree. He looked at Harry hard, his grey eyes nearly burning through him, until the judge called out his name.
“I like you.”
“Latte, two sugars.”
“Ron, you sit there and keep your mouth shut. Harry and I will ask the questions after Malfoy drinks that.”
“What the hell…”
Harry nodded.
“TRAITOR!” A blood curdling scream from one of the Death Eaters.
Hermione rolled her eyes.
“If you’ve still got you invisibility cloak and are willing to risk Snape’s wrath then, of course!”
The sight of his cock disappearing into Draco’s mouth was too much and he pulled back with a gasp.
“Good evening, Minister.” The automated voice said to him and the double doors swung open.
“It probably would be if you stopped talking. Let me try this deeper oil. And some bamboo.”
She gave him a small smile and ran her index finger down the ingredients list.
“Same.” Draco looked Harry up and down with raised eyebrows.
“Calm down, Potter,” Draco said as he moved up to knead his arse. “Your glutes are muscles too you know.”
“You know if Voldemort didn’t want you alive I’d have reduced you to ash by now. I can’t stand the sight of you, you pathetic little coward.”
He cried out loud as the wall disappeared and he started to come, harder and longer than he ever had, digging his nail into Draco’s hips, fucking him hard and erratic as he came in long shudders inside Draco’s arse. He grabbed Draco’s cock, pulling him over with him. Draco shook and shuddered, groaning loud as he came in Harry’s hand, with Harry still pounding out the last of his intensified orgasm on his arse.
“It is a little bit funny. And you don’t know that. Harry’s he’s
“I’d never touch a hair on your head. And you know it.”
“This one. This one sounds likely. It’s called obsession, for a start, and it more focused on infatuation and sexual desire rather than your traditional romantic love potion.”
“Yeah, you like that? You want me don’t you?” Draco rocked his hips.
“You’re a monster!” He heard her screaming down the stairs.
“You won’t have the Half Blood Prince to help you on this one Harry.”
“My dad? There is no way he’d know about this and not tell me.”
“That’s it Potter. Work for it. Fuck yourself on my fingers. Pump your cock. Do some work for a change instead of standing there like some blushing virgin.”
“What do you mean?” Draco asked.
“You hate me. I hate you.”
Harry rock his hips, trying to imagine what it would feel like.
Harry heard Draco’s body hit the floor and snapped. He stepped into the door way.
“Fucking. Potter. We’re Fucking. And it’s incredible.”
“You want me to fuck you in front of all these people?”
“I want to fuck you over the tower wall.”
“Have to start again,” Harry muttered.
It was a mix of houses. A real one. Harry looked around and thought it was rather wonderful. Even if there was the blonde Slytherin sitting across from him smirking. Twat.
“You’re gonna feel so good.”
Draco yelled out, grabbing Harry’s shoulders hard and he came, fucking him so hard Harry’s eyes rolled back into his head.
“What am I supposed to do with that?” Malfoy asked, shaking his wrists at him again, a noise Harry was starting to find particularly irritating.
“Starving.”
Draco grinned and pushed him up against the wall.
“I couldn’t stand his whinging,” Harry tried, wondering if this was an acceptable excuse.
Ron banged on the post again.
“Ah fuck.”
“Yeah, yeah. Get hard for me again I wanna...”
“Yes. Yes. Fuck. Any way you want me Draco,” he babbled.
“Its to get you used to it. So you’ll be expert by the time I fuck you.”
“I feel like I’ve been dreaming about this for months. You down here, like this.” Draco reached for Harry’s wand and slicked his fingers. “So pliant...”
Draco rolled his eyes but dutifully slid into the window seat. Harry sat next to him and pointedly stretched his legs out into the aisle.
Harry smiled gratefully but shook his head.
Harry closed his eyes. He didn’t feel spectacular. He felt sticky, and impossibly hard.
He picked up his wand and Harry closed his eyes, dreading to think what he was going to do. The spell washed over him and it took a few moments for it to take effect. Harry groaned when he realised what it was.
“Yeah alright,” Draco tutted. “Guess you are a manspreader.”
“Isn’t this usually HRs job?”
Draco wrapped his legs round Harry’s waist and groaned.
Harry shuddered against at the thought.Then groaned as Malfoy came down his throat. He swallowed greedily, licking Draco’s cock clean.
It's been five years since I first wrote this but I finally got a brain wave for how to continue it :D
“I can arrange for someone else if you know each other?” Sally said.
“Ah yeah, there, there, that’s it…” Draco gasped and pushed his arse back hard against Harry’s hand. Harry groaned, his cock throbbing painfully.
“Because you can only buy the ingredients on the black market, obviously.”
“So?”
Draco whimpered and Potter gripped his throat harder. Draco’s cock throbbed in response and he nodded.
“I haven’t been giving you anything, Potter, I swear. I have bigger things on my mind that amusing myself by making you fall in love with Professor Sprout or whoever it is you’ve developed sudden affections for.”
“How’s he doing?”
“God knows if he will ever forgive us.”
Harry nearly slid down the wall.
Draco pumped his cock hard, staring at Harry intently, panting.
“I’m sort of glad we’re going back to the Burrow...this place gives me the creeps.”
“Oh, you are a beautiful little slut, Harry...”
“Mmm, how do you like that baby?”
Harry didn’t know if he could stand, let alone live up to Draco’s task, but he nodded anyway, determined to try. He stood up, lifting Draco with him.
He shuddered underneath him.
“Ah!”
Their kiss became faster, more heated, till Harry was panting into Draco’s mouth as they frotted against each other. There was no other word for it. Draco pushed Harry down onto the floor and climbed fully on top of him and resumed the onslaught of Harry’s mouth.
“Well, enjoy, Minister.”
“Easssy, Potter.” He stroked the back of his head.
“I told you! I’m qualified! Distinction, thank you very much.”
“You gonna scream for me, Potter?”
He watched in horror as Malfoy plucked his wand out from between his fingers. Harry didn’t even try to resist, he didn’t understand why, he just let Malfoy take his wand. It was looking back at moments like this that Harry felt the most infuriated, why did he let him take it? He could have cast a thousand spells at him from the chair to where he was standing, so why didn’t he?
“Work out much?” Draco smirked at his ran his thumbs down Harry’s now defined arms and laced their hands together. Harry squirmed, Draco’s thigh kept brushing against his hard cock. Draco held Harry’s hands down pointedly, leant down until their eyes were inches apart and grabbed Harry’s lower lip with his teeth.
Harry breath caught in his throat and his cheeks flushed but he did as he was told. He squealed as he felt not Draco’s cock but three of his fingers pushing hard inside him.
He pulled back his lips and smiled approvingly at Harry. He imagined he looked a dishevelled red mess.
“Using muggles?”
“Better?”
Harry nodded.
“Well surely, they’re too big to sneak across the border?”
“Don’t start praying to me just yet.”
“I’ve never been on holiday,” Harry mused.
“Okay, that’s enough practice, Potter. Now you get a proper cock sucking lesson.”
“He’s a posh git, Harry, of course he knows how to dance.”
“Good boy come on. Now ride it properly, work for it. Come on. Impress me.”
Harry pulled back and Draco groaned.
For a while Harry had thought this personality was just another sex toy to use on him because he knew it drove him wild, and the more pleasure he gave him, the more he knew that Harry loathed himself, and Malfoy loved nothing more than to humiliate him. But then Harry had started thinking that it came a bit too easy to him, sometimes the look of pure hate in his eyes as he fucked him was just a bit too convincing to be fake.
The lack of a clock on the wall was disorientating. There was light from outside, but Harry still would have killed for a watch. Something to cling onto, to measure, count. The days weren’t enough. The amount of times he’d come in his own bloody hand were enough. He needed Draco. Desperately. He craved no one else, nothing else in this state than Draco. He was all he’d ever known in terms of a lover. All he ever wanted to know. And the guilt was tearing him to pieces. The order. He’d let so many people down. And now everyone would know. What a monster he was for... Loving, yes loving, that bloody death eater.
“Gods, Potter, what is it like to be that self-obsessed?”
“You’re very feisty for this time in the morning, are sure you don’t want to stay up here?” Draco smirked at him. Harry tried not to let himself be drawn in and opened the door pointedly.
Harry jolted from his dream. Nightmare. He definitely wasn’t hard. In the dream he’d been dancing with Malfoy and Malfoy kept pulling him closer and chuckling in his ear.
“Very good, Mr Potter, if you’d like to follow me.”
“Fucking hell Draco, “ Harry gasped.
“Fuck,” Draco groaned. “Yes, yes, more.
Harry groaned and then gasped as Draco pushed the thing inside him, feeling the pleasure coursing through him.
“With them closed?”
“That’s a strange way to say thank you, Malfoy.”
He pushed the wood up Harry’s spine and Harry groaned again.
“Take off your boxers,” Draco said.
“Tap!” Draco ran to the opposite side of the room and stuck his head underneath it. “I can’t believe there’s been a tap here all this fucking time and I didn’t find the it!”
“They might be under imperius.”
“Bright and early.”
“It’s too late for the Horcruxes,” Draco sighed. “He’s too powerful.”
“That’s the best chat up line I’ve ever heard,” Draco said dryly. “But it’ll do.”
“He does,” Harry agreed.
Draco groaned and brought his hand up to shield his face. Harry dimmed the lamps. Draco was a mess, a skinny, bruised, filthy mess. Harry had to exercise all his self-control not to go back up the stairs and blast the death eaters to kingdom come.
Harry took his own clothes off and put them in a pile on the now clean floor. He walked under the hot water and wrapped his arms around Draco’s frail frame.
“Yeah, you want that?”
Another one of Draco’s knowing smirks. The bastard was having the time of his life getting him off.
“Shh!” Arthur said.
“Oh piss off.”
Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest. He needed to get out of there.
Harry helped Draco off the table.
Harry was caught off guard and forgot the speech he had rehearsed to finally make Dumbledore take him seriously.
“Oh, if it’s proper cooking I’ll do it,” Hermione got up, ushering Harry back to his seat and taking out her wand.
“Malfoy, what’s wrong with you? You seem, happy?”
Draco moved his hips faster.
Draco groaned and reluctantly rolled out of bed.
“Actually I think I want a review...”
“Yesss fuck Draco I need this.”
“Oh, don’t be worried about those two. I’m sure you know The Order have two of my father’s dear friends prisoner, we’ll arrange a trade. They might be a bit bruised and bloody...but...I’m sure they’ll have been in worse places. Like this place...” Draco looked round the room again in disgust. He was talking far more than normal, Harry could tell that he was excited, buzzing about this having actually worked. Harry found himself thinking - surprisingly logically - that this was probably the first thing his father had let him do since he failed to kill Dumbledore. It would make sense that he was elated that he had succeeded.
“They’re planning an attack...like I said...it’s in three days...”
The cold water quelled Harry’s erection and he let his head drop back down into the pillow. It was just a stupid dream. Sometimes he dreamed that he was naked flying around on winged desks in the Great Hall. It didn’t mean he wanted it to happen. Or that he was fantasising about it.
Hermione jerked her head back to Harry as Draco walked past her desk. Harry smelt it too. The same perfumed aroma he knew was on his skin. In his hair. Shit.
Draco smirked at him.
“Gone.” Harry snapped at him, walking past him and over to the bed.
“Drugs?”
“Ah! Fuck!”
“Don’t you dare, open them. Look at me. Don’t break eye contact.”
“Don’t. Control yourself, Potter.”
“Thank you.”
“That you’re crying over? Not all the Slytherins are that bad looking, surely?”
Harry groaned.
“Good.”
“No!” Hermione blushed. “That you know he’s up to something.”
“Uhuh.”
“Yes...yes...oh, Draco...” Harry moaned, and god he couldn’t help it.
Harry was trying desperately to keep up with Draco’s steps and cursed as he stumbled.
“Potter, when did you last clean this?”
“Come on, breakfast.”
“Come for me,” Potter whispered in his ear.
Malfoy was straddling his lap before Harry could object. Harry barely had time to register his weight and roll his eyes at Malfoy obviously showing off for attention when his hand grabbed a fist full off hair and he kissed him.
“You dare raise your wand at me, Potter?”
“Look, I’m not entirely comfortable about this either, sweetheart, but you know what’s at stake here.”
“Can you talk?”
This caught Harry out. He was waiting for reassurance from Draco that everything was okay.
They walked across the empty road and into the petrol station and scoured the shelves for anything remotely edible that didn’t require an oven.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to ignore him. Like this, against a wall, Harry could pretend it was someone else sending him into a state of ecstasy. He could feel his orgasm building already, no wonder, and felt Draco fucking him harder, brushing against his prostate. Harry let out something near to a squeak.
Draco shuffled underneath him and put his ankles on his shoulders.
It was strange to watch Draco like this. After seeing Draco from a far at school, his chest puffed out, standing tall, ring leader. Now he stood quietly, a small smile on his face, sipping on his drink, occasionally making a sarcastic comment that made the group laugh. Harry thought it suited him better.
The edge on Draco’s voice was making him harder. That quiet malice that always lurked behind his eyes. His nails biting into his skin.
Harry held him tight under the water.
Potter ran his hand inbetween Draco’s legs, playing idly with the silver butt plug that the last dom had left in him.
He tried to compose himself and not hopelessly rut against Draco’s stomach. Draco touched his wand again, slippery gel covered Harry’s fingers. He took a deep breath and moved his fingers inbetween Draco legs. His hand was shaking as he pushed a finger inside Draco’s arse. It was hot, tight and inexplicably soft. He had sort of done this before at least. He moved his finger back on forth, trying not to pass out at the thought of what was going to happen next.
“Yes. Fuck yes.”
“Uhuh,” Harry agreed, jumping a fraction as Draco’s fingertips go a little too close to his arse. Draco didn’t seem to notice and carried on massaging.
“You’re not fighting.” Morgan looked between them both and narrowed her eyes.
Harry leant over him to whisper in his ear, making sure every inch of him was burried inside him as he did.
Draco pushed him up against the wall by his chest with his forearm and held him there hard. Harry bucked in Draco’s unmoving hand and whimpered.
“Oh…” Harry’s mouth was hanging open as Draco moved, the tight heat sliding up and down his dick leaving him breathless. Draco kissed him, pulling on his lips with his teeth, running his teeth down his neck. Harry began to move with Draco, his hand on Draco’s back guiding them together.
“Tell me these places are soundproof.”
He wished he had a witty retort, or a way to tell Malfoy to just piss off, but his brain seemed to have wandered off with one of the beers he’d drank.
Harry laughed. Draco’s hand was still on his back.
“You go first,” Draco said.
Harry nodded and opened the door.
What irritated Harry most was how Malfoy strolled through the door like he hadn’t a care in the world, whilst Harry stood there with his nerves on edge, every muscle tensed. Bastard.
“That’s the plan.” Draco gave her a fake cheery smile. “Come back if you come up with something better.”
“Draco. Please. Jesus christ.”
He felt helpless. Something was coming. He was going to lose Draco, and God knows who else.
“That’s why I’m not in Slytherin like you.”
“Yeah?” Harry’s mind flooded with images of Draco getting fucked against every possible surface in Hogwarts. Of every seedy club in London. Not that he’d know what one looked like. But he could imagine.
“Alright alright.” He pushed Draco back against the wall and fucked him faster.
Lucius just nodded and Harry watched from the floor as he levitated Ron in front of him and floated him out of the door with Bellatrix and Hermione behind him.
Harry groaned at the delicious sensation, slick and smooth.
Draco groaned, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the bars.
Draco gave him a sarcastic look.
The reality of the situation hit Harry and he went to grab his wand. Malfoy already had it in his hand. Harry went to smack him again but Malfoy caught his wrist, he went to struggle but Malfoy whispered a spell he didn’t catch under his breath. He felt his whole body turn to jelly and he slid down to the floor.
“These are the latest enchantment. They’ll turn blue if someone’s lying to you,” Harry heard as he walked past.
“Does it?”
Draco shrugged. “Being an order spy in the Malfoy Manor under your father’s nose isn’t the safest of occupations.”
“Come on, I’m ready.”
Potter leant down and whispered in his ear.
Malfoy was exhausting him already. He averted his eyes as Draco dropped his towel carelessly on the floor and climbed into bed with him.
“Yes. The younger wizards are going mad for it. They’ve been smuggling it into the nightclubs.”
He had no idea what he’d agreed to, but it caused Hermione to shake her head at them both and make a quick exit diving into the girl’s bathroom.
“Oh fuck. Oh hell.” Draco swore, riding high, so close, if it wasn’t for the spell he knew it’d be now. He groaned in frustration.
Draco flipped him onto his back, lifted Harry’s ankles onto his shoulders and pushed back inside.
Harry choked back a laugh.
“Careful there’s –“
“Shut up, Potter...” Malfoy snarled in his ear, grabbing his hard cock through his trousers, Harry groaned at the contact, could feel his body giving in already. “You think I came all this way just to save your stupid lives? Just your’s actually, think I’d let them kill my little pet? No chance...It’s been far too long as it is, since I’ve been buried inside your tight little arse, Potter...”
voice, startled him and he whipped round, lost his footing and fell, down what appeared to be a very long set of stone steps. Harry was sure he hit every single one of them on his way down, with every pointy part of his body.
“Wait. Could you not have fucking done that when Hermione burst in on us?”
“Is it muggle?”
“I’d like to see...you trying to fucking relax if you...” Harry broke off as Draco pushed harder.
“It’s me, Potter. I brought you some vegetables.”
Harry felt a spot of rain on his nose.
They left together and left Draco to his thoughts.
He was running his thumb down the contents page of his text book in Potions that he realised what must be going on.
“Say please?”
“Do you have a boyfriend?” Harry asked
He wasn’t sure about the next part. But he knew it wouldn’t be good. No, he was not going to fall for this.
“Did you say something about ketamine?”
“I’m not a fucking virgin.” These things just kept coming out his mouth. His kiss with Cho was as far as he’d got with anyone.
“What do you want?”
This time when Malfoy kissed him he didn’t bother to pull away, he gave in and kissed him back, letting the flood of emotions that went with it hit him full in the face. Every time he tried to fight against Malfoy he just ended up winning anyway, what was the point in resisting?
“Thanks mate, you’re amazing.”
“I’ll be right back,” he shouted over the music into Hermione’s ear. “Toilet.”
“Ever fucked anyone that wasn’t Ginny Weasley before?”
“Fuck. Fuck. Oh…” He knew he was going to come soon. It was inevitable. This was the best damn thing he’d ever felt in his life.
“Turn over.” Draco slapped him on the thigh.
“You’ve poisoned me. Slipping me love potions. Or lust, obsession, whatever the hell you used.”
“I’ll watch him.” Kingsley said. “You two go eat something.”
“I only came cos Hermione thinks I’m stressed.”
“Where have you been?!” she whispered. “You missed two classes!”
“Harry, he could be using you. He could be feeding everything you tell him to the Death Eaters.”
Harry’s watch bleeped as they lay panting on the floor of the cellar.
Harry stared at him for a few seconds and was about to say something when Hermione started shrieking at Ron. Harry could just about make out something about human rights and neglect before she raised her voice even further and Ron started backing away up the stairs with Hermione chasing after him.
“Mmm yesss Potter, look how well you can take this now.” He pushed in most of the way and Harry squeaked, fuller and stretched more than he ever had been with the toy.
It vanished from the parchment. Harry’s stomach turned. He was sure this was just a school boy trick, probably from Malfoy, but after his experience with the diary in second year he was wary.
Draco gave Harry an unreadable look, not containing its usual malice, but not thankful either. Harry didn’t expect it to be.
“Distraction. We fed them bad intel that our safe house is up in Scotland. They’ve sent everyone but your father and a couple of lackies up there I believe. The Order are outside. I’m waiting for the allotted time, and I’ll get us out of this basement, get past the Death Eaters, take down the wards, and get out of here.”
“Turn round, show them.”
Harry stumbled at the word ‘boyfriend’, but luckily Hermione unknowingly rescued him.
He compliantly opened his mouth and let Harry pour it into his mouth, locking eyes with him as he did, flicking his tongue out to catch the last drop. Harry thought he might die on the spot. Draco opened his mouth to show them it was all gone.
“It was more than he deserved,” Draco said. “But I’m glad he’s gone.”
She ignored his attempt to deflect.
“Oh yes, Potter, nice and tight, definitely ready for another fucking.”
“All I wanted was a kiss...you’re the one that said you wanted fucking.”
“Try and relax.”
“Mmm.”
“Draco!”
A bell rang back in the therapy room.
“You can’t just walk out!”
Draco looked round the open plan penthouse flat curiously.
They walked out of the house with its all lights on glowing in the night as the Aurors scoured it for evidence.
She patted him on the shoulder.
Now Harry had established there was no threat and dropped his wand, he realised that he was in a very small space with his…He couldn’t complete the sentence. Sexual partner. Fuck buddy. Death eater wannabe. Malfoy. Small space with Malfoy.
“So, what are you going to do? When it comes down to it. You’re on opposite sides of the battle, he kills one of us. You kill one of theirs. Then what?”
“Oh, Professor Slughorn was telling us about an extra credit project that he wants to do, we’re going to the library, do you want to come?” Hermione asked.
He held it up to Draco.
Harry’s wariness must have shown on his face.
“Shall I call us a taxi, Minister?”
“Hermione?!” He heard Ron’s voice travel down the stairs and winced as Ron flicked the bright hall light on that Harry had put there to try and lighten the mood of the hallway. Mrs Black had been removed from the wall in a particularly boring month last summer but her presence seemed to linger on in the dark hallway.
“You do a terrifyingly good job at being my father, Kingsley.”
Draco laughed.
“How do you like it? Harder?”
Draco groaned into his mouth, apparently not objecting in the least to Harry’s rough treatment.
The tight heat on his cock was incredible, like Draco’s mouth but, more intense. Draco put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and rode him hard. It was all Harry could do to sit and stare with his mouth agape as Draco moved above him, that same grin on his face. He was still struggling with the idea that this was happening, that Draco would make himself this, vulnerable? Like Harry would feel in that situation anyway. Draco didn’t look vulnerable at all as he took his pleasure.
Harry grabbed a spare one out of the wardrobe and threw it at him.
“Ah fuck, that feels really fucking good.”
“What does the boy wonder have to be stressed about hmm?”
Harry started to move, quickly realising that Draco putting that thing up his own arse made the vibrations travel through to his cock and although they were dull, Harry could still feel them driving him higher. He moved as he was told to, angling Draco’s cock just where he wanted it and moved faster still, feeling his body’s own need take over.
One by one the Death Eaters turned and walked away. Narcissa’s hand was on Draco’s back, guiding, as if she knew that at any moment he might turn and run for the other side. He went with her, softly, head down. At the end of the bridge both Narcissa and Malfoy turned back to look at the school. Harry was too far away to catch the direction of Malfoy’s gaze.
“Yes, great, that’s why I need your help.”
Harry had absolutely no idea what time it was.
“Crucio.”
Harry did. Draco groaned loud.
“You wish, Potter. Come on. We’re starting to smell like this mop bucket. I’ll go first, so no one sees us, wait two minutes, then you meet me up there.”
Harry couldn’t talk. That part of his brain seemed to have stopped working.
“I will...get up...stay ahead of me, that way...into the hall and up the stairs.”
Harry put his arm round Draco’s waist.
Draco pulled the sheets up over them and closed his eyes.
He nearly shrieked, so sensitive from that bloody toy and Malfoy fucking him as hard as he always did. Draco laughed in his ear.
“Harry. Mate. You need to get a grip.”
Harry sighed and picked up the cloth and sat down next to him.
“If I behave will you still throw me round this cage and fuck me into next week?”
Draco grabbed the rope and pulled it tight, pulling him back onto the bed. Harry scrambled to keep up with him so the rope didn’t pull too tight round his neck. He sat and watched Draco undress, dipping his fingers into the pot as he watched Draco slowly reveal his pale skin. He was still so lithe, so beautiful.
“I’ve never done this before,” Harry blurted.
“Yesss, oh Potter.”
The witch at the counter stood up taller at the sight of him.
“Yes. Yes. Please. So good.” Harry flexed underneath him in pleasure. The fullness, and that it was Draco, was threatening to make him come untouched.
Draco took his hand away and kissed Harry again, hard and deep. Harry raised his hips to meet every one of Draco’s rocks, desperate for more contact, for anything he could get. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s hair.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Harry pushed in three fingers and Draco cried out.
“Oh no, Draco, go and get some rest.”
Harry turned the light back on. Draco threw his arm over his eyes dramatically.
“Ah! Ah... God, Draco. Fucking hell...”
He was sitting in Defence against the dark arts studying a particularly dull paragraph when a tiny piece parchment whizzed through a crack in the window and onto his desk. Harry frowned and caught it in his fingers before it could attract Snape’s attention. It wriggled in his hand, refusing to be ignored. Harry gave up and opened it as subtly as he could.
“What? Suits you.” He brushed his thigh deliberately against Harry’s erection.
“More, I need...”
“Oh, thanks,” Hermione smiled, “We’ll go and do our packing then and we can head off. We should be there by lunch.”
“Would you like me to start warning you at five minutes to 4, sir?”
Harry’s body trembled, spasmodic jerks that made Draco give him that evil smile again.
Harry sighed into his mouth as he got hard.
“It’s not wearing off!”
“You’re the one that’s late!” He’d meant it to sound casual, but it came out petulant. He tensed all the more.
“Yeah? Just there?”
“How noble of you.”
“Yes, fuck, that’s good. That’s really...fuck.”
Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, flushing bright red. His darted his eyes around the classroom but everyone else had their gaze fixed on their text books. Snape caught his eye and raised an eyebrow. Harry blushed even harder and looked back down at his desk. Mortified.
At least it used to. Now it just made him pissed, he was a better wizard than him, he had no right threatening him like that. He had no right at all to make him feel any of the things that he did, and yet...
No, he’d feel much better when he was back inside the Order Headquarters (or Sirius’ place as he liked to think of it) with all the protection and disguising spells in place. That and the promise of a soft warm bed was making Harry walk to the door so fast that Hermione was struggling to keep up with him.
Harry stumbled back off Draco’s lap.
“Thanks to Potter’s wandless magic or we’d be dead,” Draco said.
“Thank you, Minister.” Major nodded and rushed away.
Draco shook his head in apparent disappointment then grabbed a can out of the bottom of his bag.
“Keep still.” Draco touched his wand to Harry’s wrist, whispered a spell and Harry’s hands stuck firmly to his sides.
Harry shrugged.
“Lovely bunch, those Death Eaters. Hang on.”
The tent eventually rose above them and they tied it down in place.
“That’d be far too easy, Potter.”
“I can’t wait to see you rot in Azkaban,” Draco spat at his father.
Harry smiled at the familiar phrase. God, but what would Remus think of this new development? He shuddered.
“It doesn’t like me.”
“Yeah? Missed it?”
Stressed. Harry rolled his eyes. He’s an Auror, course he’s fucking stressed. Yet, here he is, with the gift voucher Ron and Hermione brought him for his birthday, because they said he seemed stressed lately.
“Yes!” Harry said defensively.
The look Draco gave him cut through all his assumptions.
They finished their food.
He could feel Draco grin behind him.
“He’s told me he’s been asked to do something, something awful. I don’t know what. But he’s not, he’s not bad Professor, but if he doesn’t do it they’ll hurt his family and he’s not eating and he’s not sleeping and I don’t know what to do… I can’t help him.” It poured out if Harry like a pensive memory, a gush of feeling that wracked his body as it was released. He realised he had tears pouring down his cheeks.
It was pitch black. He had no idea how long Draco had let him sleep for. He sat bolt upright and moved over to Draco.
“I haven’t told him anything,” Harry said.
Potter was wearing a tight black shirt, black jeans and black shined shoes. God but the bastard had just got more attractive as he’d aged. Sure, he’d had a bit of a school boy crush on him, but now. This just wasn’t fair. The brown messy hair looked stylish now and verged on black with the wax Potter put in it. Charmed by Granger he was sure. The glasses were gone. Rumour was that he’d had them lasered by muggles. The nutter. So now those bright green eyes stared at him with no barrier as he approached his cage. Draco gulped. As much as he could with the gag in his mouth.
Harry wasn’t concentrating, he only really paid attention now in classes he thought would be useful against Voldemort. Dancing his way out of a fight wasn’t a tactic he’d considered. That was why he’d been staring into space when McGonagall told them all to choose a partner. It was also why he and Malfoy now stood in the middle of the dance floor looking at each other with identical expressions of horror.
How could Malfoy have no qualms about this? Not even the slightest inkling of guilt. An easy smirk and a look over his shoulder.
“Are you kidding? Harry that potion could have killed you. It was reckless of me to even try it, they’re not reputable potions Harry, not approved, they could have done anything. I don’t know what I was thinking.”
Draco pulled back and turned Harry over; happy that he was still somewhat conscious, he stepped back and walked over to the bathroom to finally wash the dust off his skin.
The cold air started to prickle at his skin and Harry cleaned himself up and put his clothes back on. He checked over his reflection in the mirror the room had helpfully provided him with, trying to flatten his hair. No chance. His cheeks were a flushed, but other than that he thought he’d pass for normal.
“There’s only one cloak and its under my bed.”
“Hi Ron!” he heard Hermione call as she pushed past Harry to run up the staircase to meet him.
“No, I’m serious, I need your help. But…I can’t tell Ron about it.”
Harry grunted in disbelief.
“Since when does Malfoy know how to dance?” Harry complained as they followed Hermione down the staircase.
“Poor thing,” he cooed in his ear as pumped his cock, then moved down him and slid his lips down his cock.
“Grumpy, damp, and rather cheeky. One of them tried to sell me some Glitzamine as I was leaving.”
“Yes, Minister. But who do you imagine would volunteer for such a task?”
“I thought you didn’t care what he was doing,” she whispered.
“Why are you doing this?” Harry asked him. “You’re risking your life for this...for us...you’ve never shown any inkling towards us before...”
“Both?” Draco chuckled in Harry’s ear.
Harry’s breath hitched and he pushed back hard, his hand tight on Draco’s hip. He fucked Draco slowly in the steam, living in that second only for Draco’s cries and that blissful heat around his cock.
“Don’t get too used to them. Push your hair back. I can see it glinting even with your hood up.”
“Oh. God.”
“You sure you haven’t done this before, Potter?”
They crept through a living room, the dinning room and a kitchen before finding themselves back in the hall. Harry frowned at Draco. There was nothing out of the ordinary, in fact nothing magical at all to suggest a wizard or witch lived here. A door creaked upstairs and Harry nodded to Draco.
The platinum disappeared down the stairs and Harry came back to himself.
His deputy nodded to him gratefully and slid into Draco’s seat.
“Dumbledore didn’t deserve it. He’d been nothing but kind to me. No matter how vile I was to him.”
“I’m not. Only sorry I didn’t have the bottle to do it myself. I’m a coward.”
“Oh. Fuck.”
“I do. Doesn’t mean you’re not a spoilt brat though.”
“Yes dear,” Harry drawled.
“Your powers of perception are still sharp I see. Steal the Death Eaters. If you’re plan has worked the ones they’ll have left behind here are thick as shit, they’ll not know me from their own.”
,” it burst from Harry’s lips without his consent.
“Lucius is dead,” Harry said.
“I can’t seem to see a dressing gown...”
you can do wandless, Potter, come on. I don’t fancy this ice bath.”
A rational voice was trying to tell Harry that he had to see Draco on Monday. And great many other days after that. If this all went horribly wrong, if he was reading this wrong, it would be a disaster. Draco gave him a small smile and laced his fingers through Harry’s, dragging his thumb up the palm of his hand. Harry tried to tell his cock this was not a sign to stand to attention.
“Good.” Harry purred in his ear.
Harry stared at the desk, refusing to meet Malfoy’s eyes.
Harry shook his head.
“See Harry!” Harry jumped as he heard Ron’s voice behind him. “I told you he was full of shit!”
“I...” the promise of Draco’s mouth round his cock overrode his awkwardness. “I want you to suck it.”
“My assistants pretty hot.”
“He’d never stop laughing.”
He managed to leave the hall without giving Malfoy a second glance. He didn’t even know if the Slytherin was still there.
Harry had never felt so intimidated. He had no idea how Draco was doing it, when he was the one telling Harry his schoolboy crush secrets.
“I don’t know! You tell me! Part of Voldemort’s plan. Distract me, get me out of the way before he strikes?”
Harry groaned and pushed past her into the corridor.
“Yes!”
Harry let himself go. He fucked Draco erratically as his body took what it wanted. Draco’s arse clenched hard around his cock and that was all it took. He cried out loud, pounding into Draco’s arse, burying his head in his neck, coming what seemed endlessly, shuddering and twitching as he came.
Harry’s heart skipped.
“I should have let him leave you down there in that bloody cellar!” she said.
“Fuuuuuck,” he moaned as Draco sucked him dry, drawing out every tremor and moan from him with his mouth.
Draco gasped as Potter pushed two fingers inside him.
“I’m sorry, Harry. That’s the last potion.”
“Harry! Wake up mate!”
There was a tiny lock of Draco’s hair that curled, just behind his left ear. The rest was poker straight, regulation Malfoy platinum and always in place. Harry noticed it when Draco was leaning his right ear on the telephone, propped up by his elbow, on the phone to what appeared to be a very tedious employee of the ministry.
Harry realised with horror that Malfoy was actually going to go ahead with the treatment.
He slapped his wand down on his arse and Harry cried out in surprise, he kept hitting him with it, in time with his hard thrusts.
“Holy fuck.”
“Come on. I’m putting you to bed. You need rest. And painkillers.”
“Poor little boy wonder.” Draco ruffled Harry’s hair. “It’s not easy being in love, is it?”
“You’re in love with him, aren’t you?”
“Still is.” Draco grinned at him. “It’s so thick though.”
Draco sat down on a chair that definitely hadn’t been there a moment ago and kicked off his trousers and pants.
He climbed out of bed, threw the invisibility cloak around his shoulders, and put on his shoes. Wand clutched in hand he made his way to the bathroom. Wind whistled through the castle corridors, biting at the exposed area between Harry’s socks and his cloak. He pulled his cloak tighter round himself and cursed himself for coming out in his Gryffindor pyjamas and polished shoes. He wondered if he could look any more ridiculous.
“Sexual Partner, Potter, it wasn’t a proposal.”
“Harry?” Ron shook him awake.
He heard Potter kneel down in between his legs and looked determinedly down still. He didn’t want to give Potter the satisfaction of looking back, showing how nervous he was.
“Fucking hell,” Harry said eventually.
“Yeah? There?”
“Still got it then, Potter?”
“No arguments. Do it or you’re out. I want you to walk back in here a solid partnership that can work together in my force, or I don’t want you coming back at all.” She walked out the office and slammed the door behind her.
“Tell me it doesn’t take as long as the Polyjuice.”
It was just impossible to concentrate on dancing and retorting to Malfoy’s constant provocations at the same time. Harry opted for silence and getting his steps right. He managed eight bars before Malfoy put him off again.
Draco pulled on his ear with his teeth.
“More than he deserved. Still, at least that’s one less Death Eater in the world.”
“Ron, what the hell is going on?” Harry demanded, looking between a sheepish looking Ron and an extremely pissed looking Malfoy.
“Morning, Harry,” Hermione chimed. She was generally a lot more spritely than Ron who just trudged into the room and collapsed onto the chair opposite Malfoy.
“You’ll understand when I tell you.”
“What have you done to your face?” he asked as he ran his hand across it.
“Surprisingly, she lost interest. Not that I really need one anymore anyway. They’re a status, children and carrying on the line sort of thing.”
“You always seem so surprised Potter, that I can make you feel such things...do you deny it to yourself that it feels this good after?”
Draco smelt like hell but Harry didn’t care. He kissed Draco’s chapped dry lips and ran his hand through his filthy hair like he’d been longing for, for all this time.
“I didn’t tell her, she figured it out,” Harry said.
“Dismissed.”
Harry jumped out of his skin at the thudding on the door, then closed his eyes in despair as he heard Major’s voice on the side of it.
“No. I tried that soul-searching shit but they kept interrupting it to kick the shit out of me.”
“Come on, I wanna hear it from those innocent lips.”
“Take him with us, see if your dad really does know what he’s up to.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said. “You’re right. It’s stupid and childish.”
.” Hermione fell back into step with them.
Harry pulled the door open a crack.
“What?”
“Maybe for you,” Ron said.
“I think Molly’s cooking,” Arthur said.
“Hermione,” Harry said quietly. “I need to talk to you about something.”
“Think about?”
“Yeah? Come on then.”
He chanced a look at Hermione. She looked delighted and scandalised all at the same time. Harry was hyperaware of Malfoy’s every movement as he walked back to his place in the circle and sat back down. He looked utterly dishevelled. He smirked at Blaize sat next to him and took another swing of his drink.
“mmm.”
Harry paused, then moved his hands down to Draco’s arse, easily lifting him up and and letting him drop back down on his cock.
“I can’t. I can’t.”
“You said you knew what you were doing!” Draco said.
“They’ve got subtle differences. I’m sure if you went to Slughorn he’d work out which one it was straight away.”
“Um, cos I’m taller and I’ve got longer legs?”
“Okay,” she said as they scrapped back their chairs. “So, what’s the problem?”
Draco laughed.
Draco shook his head at him and took out his wand, muttering under his breath. The coffee maker buzzed happily as Draco cleaned it, spelling all the dust and dirt into the bin.
“Creeps me the fuck out.” Harry said.
Draco couldn’t talk and Potter knew it. His hand was too tight round his neck.
“It’s kind of nice. Still. Probably shouldn’t make a habit of it. Ministry to run and all that.”
“A mudblood would have been a better father than you.”
“Do you want me to suck it?”
Malfoy just nibbled at his ear lobe and smirked. Harry tried not to squirm.
He swallowed down Draco’s cock like he’d been dying to for so many lonely nights, wondering whether it was inappropriate to keep having these dreams about Draco when he didn’t even know if he was alive for god sake. His cock hadn’t wanted to hear it.
Draco pushed the toy inside him and Harry gasped.
Harry pursed his lips.
“I’ve got a lighter, fresh out of beans.”
“Not all of us are rolling in money, Malfoy.” Harry tutted at him, hoping that Hermione bringing over their tea would move the conversation along and they could just forget he ever said anything.
“You didn’t lock the curtains?”
“Come on, Potter, is that the best you’ve got? If you want to make me come you’ll have to move a little faster...”
Draco didn’t think it was possible for his cheeks to turn any darker.
“Trapeze artist?” Harry suggested.
Harry bit his lip and moved Draco’s hips experimentally.
“At least then...at least then it’s just fucking...”
They went their separate ways at the staircases. Harry crept into bed and closed his eyes, falling into a blissfully dreamless sleep.
He kissed him back, hard, and Harry realised quite how out of his depth he was. He’d never felt this before, the lurching of his stomach, the butterflies, the goosepimples on his arms, the hair standing up on the back of his neck. The world was falling away below him and there was nothing he could do about it.
“I wish I could see things so simply.”
“Faster,” Draco moaned.
“Avada Kedavra!”
He watched Draco raise his arm in slow motion, watched him shaking, trying so desperately and failing, in what he had been tasked to do.
“Do muggles actually enjoy this?”
Harry apparates. The wind and sideways rain hits him in the face and nearly sends him flying. Major grabs his arm. He thinks he’s sober again now.
“Scotland,” Major says, with a particularly disdainful voice.
“What do you think I’m doing?” Draco laughed in his ear, so self assured, even at the apparent rejection. He swung a leg over Harry’s and lay a hand on his stomach. It felt so right that Harry thought he might be sick and abruptly pushed him back, kicking his leg off his own. He couldn’t take it feeling so perfect and fairytale, not with Malfoy. It was sick.
Harry knew from sharing an office with Draco for a year that he was silent almost all of the time. That when he made a noise it was because he wanted to be heard. So, when Draco pushed his chair back with a curdling shriek against the wooden floor Harry jerked his head up.
