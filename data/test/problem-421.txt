A mass of fur shoves past him, running towards- running and leaning over- hand pressing to the pulse of-
He pushes against him weakly for a few seconds, then resigns himself to the hug and the inevitable tears. In some way, it feels good to cry like this. He may give himself a headache and a snotty nose, but  with every sob, he feels himself getting freer. Harry holds him through it, rubbing his back and whispering comforts that Draco doesn’t really process, yet can appreciate.
"Sorry, Headmistress, but I don't really fancy having to sleep with a wand in my hand and a thousand wards around my bed. Is there no way we can join the seventh years? There must be enough room in Slytherin house!"
“Me and Luna were just talking. About wishes, you know?” Potter says keenly, sitting on the end of Draco’s bed. He still hasn’t eaten the tart, which is bizarre, as both him and Weasley have the disgusting habit of shoving food into their mouth like there’s no tomorrow.
He can feel Pansy’s glare on him now, practically restrained to her bed by Blaise, both of them with healing boils and slime from a new hex. Madam Pomfrey fusses over them, mostly ignoring the younger students, who are constantly sniping about how Draco deserved it. They’d left Harry alone when he started growling at them, but their conversation is still itching at him.
“Ron!” Another pillow narrowly misses Ron’s head, this time from Ginny. “I can’t believe you! Don’t be such a dick.”
“Come on.” Nott pulls him to his feet, and starts leading him along the path. “I’ll get you some tea. Maybe you can try one of Hagrid’s rock cakes as well.”
He chooses to just put the cloak on over his current outfit. Tucking the rest into a ball, he walks out of the bathroom and towards his compartment. Blaise and Pansy have both returned before him, along with a more surprising addition. Theodore Nott.
“That’s why I recommended the painting set and canvas.” Luna clarifies, looking at the rest of them. “I told you he did very excitable artwork.”
This chapter's recommendation is... VeteranKlaus! If you love reading about Klaus from the Umbrella Academy, VeteranKlaus has written a lot of fanfictions on this. Some are incomplete, but there are a lot of interesting ideas and possibilities explored very well. They have a good style of writing too, so for picky readers like me, you won't be disappointed.
“Want a cigarette?” Theo speaks up after an hour of silence. He’s digging in his pocket, pulling out a packet that Harry vaguely recognises.
“Yeah. So, I’m going to go without magic for a while, see how I go, let my magic recharge, like Hermione says. Think about things more.” He glances at Draco, green eyes sincere. “About you more. I don’t want to keep hurting you.”
No. He swallows the potion, grimacing at the sour taste. He’s not going to become like one of those hopeless messes, wishing for death every second of the day. He’s a fighter, always has been, and what he should be focused on doing is fixing this disease of his. If he doesn’t find a cure, at least he’ll know he tried, and by then he might have found something else to work on.
As if this day couldn’t get any worse, Potter starts yelling at them. Draco wishes he could sink into the floor and disappear forever. Not only is the pain in his ribs starting to make him think he’s got a broken rib that will pierce his heart and kill him, but the pain of possibly having to now fight off Potter is making him feel woozy. Or maybe that’s the knock to the head from when he first fell.
Comments are greatly appreciated, I love reading through them and getting ideas for what to write next. Thank you!
Further away from the main huddle, Neville is chatting quietly with Nott. Pansy almost becomes interested, until she sees that there is a plant in between them. Of course. Nott nods seriously, then reaches out a hand and strokes the plant, which shivers. It’s strange seeing him so gentle and tender, considering his actions in the war. Still, Pansy isn’t about to judge anyone for what they did back then. She herself behaved like a coward, and is still deeply ashamed of it.
“A little.” She concedes. “Neville has approached me about the same topic. Not the same subject, but the same topic. If you’re willing to put in the extra work that will come with it, I will be willing to place you both with the professors.”
“I am feeling quite alright.” She reassures him, and for once, it edges on the truth. If she ignores the crushing despair of losing her son, and the black hole in her heart at losing her husband, and the crawling loneliness of only having house elves for company, she does feel lighter.
And today's recommended writer is... Gwendee! For anyone who loves the very niche fanfictions of Asano Gakushuu from Assassination Classroom, gwendee is the perfect person to follow. There's everything from mildly traumatic distress to hilariously over-the-top reactions. Best of all, the characterisation is so believable and entirely human (well, human as in human emotions... there is supernatural Gakushuu thrown in there).
They’re sitting in Draco’s room again, posters and books strewn all over the floor. Pansy has assigned herself leader of the campaign on the pureblood side, placing Draco on poster creation and Hermione on research and debate. The house elves that usually bring Draco food took one look at the mess and never returned, so now it’s up to Luna to keep him fed. This has the unfortunate consequence of him being forced to actually eat all the food, as Luna won’t leave for classes unless he does, but he enjoys her company for the time she is there.
There’s no response. Pansy huffs, worry bubbling into irritation in her stomach. Draco had hid in his room for two whole days now, refusing to answer anyone coming to the door. When she’d asked Theo about it, he’d given a noncommittal shrug and said they’d broken up, then wandered off with that dumb flat look of his. She’s starting to regret ever letting him join them on the train.
“Sure you were.” Blaise winks at him, blood-red shirt styled to casual elegance. “Ron and I were discussing potential Auror robes designs. Care to contribute.”
Okay, finally done writing the second half of the chapter! It was a little short yesterday, so I added an extra scene at the end that doesn't really contribute much but is there anyway. Actually... I think that's probably most of the scenes in this entire thing. I had no idea what I was doing until, like, threee chapters ago.
She breezes past him, leaving her sudden apology hanging in the air. Harry smiles. Turns out people can be nice, if you give them the chance. Well, sort of nice, if calling him a clabbert’s pustule right after apologising counts.
“Perhaps you could.” Lucius murmurs, breaking his code of clearly audible words. “You’ve always managed to go beyond what’s expected. Perhaps you could fly so high you could hold the moon in your hand, and your mother would see you safe and I could show the world what you can do. Look at my son, up there in the clouds, with the moon in his hand and the stars in his hair.”
We have loose ends, yes. So many loose ends. If you know a loose end that doesn't have to do with Draco becoming alive, please tell me. It's been a while since I started this, and I have forgotten pretty much 90% of what I have written.
Except… in Malfoy Manor. When Malfoy had stood in front of him and risked his life to save Harry’s. Then Harry had left him. Perhaps if he’d taken Malfoy with them, he could have saved him then. After all, Malfoy was left wandless, and so couldn’t have summoned the Death Eaters to Luna’s home.
“Ron, break the connection. Slice it like butter, remember?” A boy says near him, the other one who had been shouting before. He doesn’t like him. He doesn’t like what he says even more. He should shut up.
“Magic can’t fix everything.” Nott starts. His voice is frustrated, but he does nothing to lash out at Harry. “Expelliarmus might stop the Dark Lord, but you can’t always be the Saviour, Harry. Sometimes, people just need time and understanding to sort things out themselves. This was Draco’s fight. Even if Draco had been given everything in the world, he would still have had to deal with his own thoughts. Magic couldn’t fix him. The only thing you could have done was be there for him when he needed it, given him space, given him comfort, allowed him to work it all out himself. I couldn’t do that, so I gave him space for people like Pansy and Hermione and Luna and Blaise to help him instead. You should have just- just waited!”
“Fine, fine. You win, Blaise.” Harry throws the other boy a galleon, the third one this week, which is tucked neatly into a hidden pocket of his robes. “Anyone want a butterbeer?”
Mind made up, Harry grabs some parchment and starts copying up the spell, along with the potion. He’s a terrible potion maker, but Slughorn could do it for him. All Harry needs to do is work out which food Draco would reject.
“I always thought you had an unhealthy obsession with that boy.” His father sniffs, rolling his eyes.
Then he’s gone, shattering into white light that melts into the floor and the walls, leaving Draco bitterly alone again, unspoken words caged in his throat. He sinks into himself, heart throbbing. His father is gone, forever.
There are a few moments of tense silence where Gobsy pours out two cups, handing them to their respective owners.
Draco winces, carefully prying Pansy from him. Instantly, she grabs his hand and pushes him back onto the seat, flouncing down beside him. “Oh, darling! You’re so thin! What happened to you?” She fusses, gazing at him with over-wide eyes.
But then Malfoy had faced him in the Room of Requirement, and Harry had saved him then. Ron had saved Malfoy again from another Death Eater, so it wasn’t fair to say he hadn’t tried. It was just Malfoy being a git throughout all of their school years that meant he couldn’t understand. It wasn’t Harry’s fault.
“I won’t!” Harry promises, fingers crossed together behind his back. “Thanks, Remus. You’re really helpful. I’ll send over some chocolate from Honeydukes next time I visit.”
He shakes his head, picking up the slice of plain bread and biting into it. The taste is identical to sawdust as he chews far longer than he should, struggling to swallow. Three mouthfuls later, and he sets it down, stomach roiling violently. Goyle would have eaten the entire thing in two bites. Crabbe would have eaten it in one, just to show he was better. He shoves his plate away, guilt adding to his queasiness.
Harry nods, searching his mind for something to say, but he comes up blank. Instead, he turns on his heel and scurries out, shadows and whispers chasing him to the gate.
“First of all, a welcome to all first years. I’m sure you will make us all proud of you during your time here, provided you work hard. You are lucky enough to have come to Hogwarts at a time of peace, so try to make the most of it. This leads me to my next point.” She tilts her head down, looking severely down her nose at them. “While we may have felt losses during the war, we must all learn to find a healthy way to grieve. Those who passed during the war must be remembered in a respectful way, or their sacrifice for a peaceful world will have been for nothing. I’m sure most of you will have heard about the attacks on innocent civilians during the summer.”
“Before you came here, did you see Harry?” Black breaks the silence, words a shock in the still quiet.
He glances at him, recognising the man from somewhere. The knight jogs along with him, shoving disgruntled people out of his way as he moves from lush greenery to taverns, glaring at Harry the entire time.
How is he dead? Draco’s mind accelerates, confusion and dread flooding his veins. His father is supposed to be in Azkaban. Locked away and probably miserable, but alive in his cell. How is he here?
For him? This is all because Harry doesn’t want to hurt him? Draco shakes his head, guilt burning in his stomach, hoping to get through that he doesn’t want Harry to give up magic because of him.
“I have enough!” Harry shouts, breaking Blaise’s concentration for a second. “I have enough magic to do it both! Blaise, now! Now!”
Draco’s collection was a little different to the others. Instead of essays and grades, he’d set up a small gallery of paintings, each one talking and moving around and interacting with others. Mr Lovegood brought along his camera and took photos for an article he was writing on Draco’s work, which had gathered attraction only a few weeks after he started. Because these weren’t just any people in his paintings. These were those who’d died in the Battle of Hogwarts. He had developed the idea after finding his list of people that he’d abandoned a while ago, the ones he’d wanted to help in return for forgiveness. Now, he just wants to help people heal, like he and his mother had after he’d painted Lucius.
And reality kicks in. Severus is dead. The cloak is burnt away, his safe haven nothing but a distant memory. The boy, the man, standing outside the door is the one who caused all this. Without Potter, Vo- the Dark- the creature of a man wouldn’t have done any of this. Severus would still be alive, if it wasn’t for Potter’s stupidity. Every time anything ever went wrong, Potter was at the heart of it.
For me, I definitely read a lot of Assassination Classroom, but only specifically about Gakushuu. Harry Potter is up there, again specifically Draco things, as evident by this fanfic. BNHA about Todoroki, and Bakugou, but never Izuku (please don't kill me but Izuku kinda annoys me in canon). Then there's The Umbrella Academy, which I've only really started reading recently, and sometimes if I'm really running out of interest in everything I'm currently reading, I'll read Sherlock or Merlin things. I hesitate with the Merlin stuff, because it's such a part of my childhood that having adult stuff about it in fanfic is just... weird to read.
His wand couldn’t be saved. That is his price for having the Dark Mark destroyed, so he can't be too upset about it. The poor thing was struggling anyway. Without it, he now has to master using magic without words or a wand, which would be near impossible if Sirius didn’t have as much time on his hands as Draco. During the long days in the ward, he and Draco have been practicing their magic together, offering each other tips and comfort when they fail. Apparently, being trapped in Limbo for years on end restricts magic somewhat.
“She’s always been like that. What did you say to her, anyway?” Harry questions. He hadn’t been paying much attention at that point, staring into the fireplace and wondering if he could firecall Remus later.
Harry stares at his tea, rippling in a faint wind. He’d been selfish, that was it. If he had Draco here with him again, he would do everything that Nott just told him and he would never, ever use magic on him again. But he can’t have a second chance, because Draco is dead.
The glass teeters, then falls over and smashes on the ground. Not so much as a single shard comes flying towards him.
Now what? The two people are still wrapped in Harry’s magic - his magic, now - and he can either sink it into their skin to make them alive, or he could experiment, play a little. There’s not enough magic for both.
“Are you sure?” Harry glances between the staircase and Draco. “I don’t want to force you up there.”
He stammers, stomach clenching as he desperately thinks of a way to not tell them. His visits are special, a secret that he treasures between him and the silent boy. No one can ruin that, especially not Parkinson and her upturned nose. But… then again, Parkinson is Malfoy’s friend. Actual friend, not minion or blind follower like Crabbe or Goyle had been. She’s proved it through months of defending Mafloy’s name, subtle hexes, outright brawls, and letting Malfoy come out in his own time, despite her obvious frustration.
“Shouldn’t you talk to Draco about this?” She whispers, nervously picking at her skirt. Pansy’s closeness is making her face heat up more. She probably looks like a tomato. She hopes not. It’s not like Pansy will ever like her in that way, considering the girl is straight, but she’d rather not be thought of as ugly by the most attractive girl in the school. Except for Ginny, and Astoria, and Lily from Hufflepuff, of course.
He can just hear it, the subtle way his father tells him how proud he is of him. At least this copy didn’t miss that. Draco’s sight suddenly becomes incredibly blurry, so he buries his face in his arm and wills away the tears. As usual, he feels Harry’s arms wrap around his waist the second he does so, Harry’s chin on his shoulder, muttering reassurances.
Instead of risking telling them himself, he leads them to the board. There are two staircases leading downwards, originally meant for a gender split. Now, they just lead to the same corridor. Harry wonders whether this place has been used as dormitories before, since Hogwarts rarely changes its skin for new purposes.
When Harry suggests getting together with both of the groups on New Year’s Eve, Draco almost blacks out at the thought. One household was overwhelming enough. So instead they decide to have a quiet night in their dorm, a muggle movie and some popcorn to fill the time. Neville is the only one who isn’t going elsewhere, and after hearing of their plans, he tactically decides to spend the evening with Theo and Hagrid instead.
“I think there might be more people in there.” Luna peers into the wispy gauze of magic, the closest person to it.
Sirius Black, the man whose face was splattered everywhere in their third year. The disgrace of the family. His aunt’s brother-in-law. A man who, by all rights, should be dead.
“You two!” Hermione sighs in exasperation. “You’d think we’re a gaggle of first years. Draco, put down the paintbrush and cast a drying spell. Pansy, tell me how on earth I’m supposed to fix this.”
Reaching out a hand, he makes to silence him when a flash of ginger interrupts him. The weasel raises his wand, looking scared shitless, and yells something.
Harry slips in between him and Hermione, eyes scanning over the list, praying it isn’t as bad as they seem to think it is.
With that, he steps back, and the glow vanishes. Complete silence. His heart thuds in his chest as he looks around at all of the enraptured faces, every one startled into silence.
“Not then, sir. Too much lying in bed. Gobsy stayed to help young master Draco and mistress. Don’t know what they’d do without Gobsy, sir. Gobsy stays because young master Draco was always a little weak, sir, always ill and in bed. Snakey man never good, infected poor manor, and young master Draco always caught everyone’s illnesses. Young master Draco infected, Gobsy thinks.”
“Now, if you wanted.” She casts a tempus. “Yes, they should all be downstairs. You should come with me.”
Harry sips at the tea, then sets it down gently. “I killed Draco.” He whispers before he can stop himself, all of the horror and guilt creeping up again.
“What about Draco? I thought you two were going to move in together?” Luna tilts her head, voice light and curious.
“Ask Potter, professor. He’s the one who’s been sneaking in there every day without telling anyone.” Parkinson sneers, fingernails tapping against the desk.
“Which is why Slytherins suck!” Ginny gripes, nose wrinkled as she follows Luna and falls onto the sofa. “I don’t get the Draco thing, but Nott is a huge asshole.”
Silence. Draco’s hands are clenched in his covers, and at some point he must have lost control because his cheeks are wet and he has no idea why. Theo’s hands drop from his ears, wiping away a thin trail of blood dribbling down.
“On the contrary, the program you are part of is to prevent ideas of blood purity lasting into your adulthood.”
“I’m afraid I already know about my husband, Mr Potter.” She says gently, picking up a delicate cup of tea and sipping. “The ministry was quicker to tell me of his death than they will ever be to tell me when my house arrest will end.”
Pansy takes the lead instead. “I think I understand what he’s trying to say. It’s not that house elves are happy being slaves, it’s that they know freedom isn’t fun for them. They could be reduced to what they were before. The one that left the Malfoys was lucky, since he knew Potter. Dumbledore would obviously take in anything Precious Potter liked.” She snorts, a bitter tone coming through.
His back slides against the wall as he sinks to the floor, aware but uncaring of the number of germs that must be rubbing off on his clothes. If his mother was here she would be appalled. If his father was here… if his father was here he wouldn’t have done it in the first place. But he isn’t, so he can, and why is that man even in his head anyway? He’s gone. Buggered off to waste away in Azkaban.
“We are.” Harry grins. “It doesn’t matter where we are, Draco can still paint and sell his art, and I think he’d prefer staying at Hogwarts too. His mum and my da- I mean, Remus and Sirius are already happy together at Grimmauld Place, they won’t need us there too.”
Nott’s voice cracks, so he stands and walks back over to the counter, leaning against it and dropping his head. “Just because you love someone, it doesn’t mean you know what’s best for them.”
Their group moves over to the Slytherin table, sitting in the same seats they had every year. The younger slytherins, most likely scared to be associated with them, move down to leave room between them. Not that they have to move very far. This table in particular is so empty that even when the first years are sorted, less than three quarters of the table is filled. It’s a far cry from the time when Slytherin was a proud house.
She only nods, gripping her cup like a lifeline. Gobsy pops into existence next to her, as though sensing her distress, and gently rests a hand on her knee.
“I’m sorry for being an asshole and saying you should have been given to him. Even if it turns out you’re a clabbert’s pustule and deserved it. I was being selfish and a bit of a bitch. See you!”
Draco can only helplessly nod, watching the small figure dance around the paper. What a mad turn of events.
Wetness on his cheeks. The wind in his hair, on his face. The skin under his hand. The bark on his back. The chirping of birds in the trees, the whistle of wind through his teeth, the rustling of the leaves above. His heart begins to slow as he rubs his eyes and focuses again, panic seeping away gently.
The Weasley’s lunch went a lot smoother, even if it was a little overwhelming. Molly took one look at Draco’s skinny frame and bombarded him with food, despite his constant polite protests that he was far too full. Ron delighted in egging her on, telling stories of how the Slytherin table rarely has any fatty foods, and giving not-so-subtle hints about how Draco barely ate anything more than an apple when he first arrived at Hogwarts. Ginny brings along Luna, arguing that if Harry is allowed his boyfriend, she’s allowed her girlfriend. For this, Draco is grateful. If Luna hadn’t been there as a quiet, calming presence, he doubts he wouldn’t have run off at some point to get some space.
Nott’s chair screeches as he stands sharply, footsteps pacing on the wood as he walks around the hut, uncomfortable silence prickling the back of his neck. Harry’s fingers clench around his cup, teeth stabbing into his bottom lip as he tries not to let out a choking sob. He fails.
“At the Manor.” She smiles at the memory, one of the few bright sparks in the darkness of that time. “He brought us food, and we talked as long as he was allowed. When he told me about Blaise, I tried to help him in return, by- oh. Can you not tell him I told you?” She’d promised not to tell anyone when he’d asked, and now she’d broken that twice. Maybe he’ll find out, and not want to be her friend anymore. She hopes he doesn’t. She likes being his friend, on his good days.
Harry snorts. “Oh, it’s fine. Let him hide it away in the attic until he decides it really isn’t worth the space.”
“So much for Gryffindor bravery. You’re only brave when you have the advantage, and then you pretend you’re outnumbered.” Zabini scoffs, his irritatingly perfect smirk in place. “Lower your wands, and stop embarrassing yourselves.”
Harry isn’t angry. He really isn’t. At least, that’s what he’s telling himself under the screaming impulse to go knock someone’s teeth out. It’s the one year where he doesn’t have to worry about trying to survive, and now some stupid Slytherins are ruining it. As usual.
Draco nods, suppressing the fluttering in his stomach. The last time he saw Harry, the man had kissed his forehead. He reaches pale fingers up and brushes them over the spot, recalling the soft press of lips to his skin.
As always, any new ideas or suggestions for future chapters are much appreciated! (I'm publishing as soon as I finish writing every chapter, and I have little planning, so anything you want to see in here probably will appear if you comment it.)
Harry’s hand starts trembling around Blaise’s wrist. He doesn’t care. He draws deeper, further, wrapping the bubble into a cocoon as words flow from his lips. When he finishes, he stabs the bubble, watches it burst, watches the magic fly to the two people inside, revels in the feeling of holding two living beings in the palm of his hand.
He can hear the apprehension in her words, the same feeling racing through him when he steps out. Hogwarts. The renovations, paid for by money taken from families like his and Theodore’s, have finally finished. The uneasiness leaks away. He’d been dreading the castle would be just like the Manor - reeking of death and dark magic - yet the new stone, while identical to the old, smelt fresh and full of new hope.
Pansy’s arm snakes around his, and he lets her lead him into the castle, away from the source of his aggravation. The castle is too bright and warm for the dreadful weather, presumably enchanted to make the students feel more welcome. By tomorrow, the corridors will be just as grey and sodden as the outside world. Chattering students skim around the edge of their bubble of Death-Eater-ness, heading to the Great Hall.
Harry flushes, looking away. “Well, you don’t have to if you don’t want to, I just thought that since we, uhm, kissed, you might like me in the way that I like you? It’s fine if you don’t, I get it, I just had to ask, because-”
Harry gags, frozen in place, unable to rip his eyes away from the massive chunk of skin hacked out, the blood and muscles and bone merging into a huge bloody mess. His wand, that stupid wand that Harry had kept for so long, lies in splinters on the ground. He can see a unicorn hair poking out, silvery and white, so different from the stained shard of mirror lying next to it.
“Is it… are they being cruel to you?” She asked gently, well aware that pureblood society is not kind. Just like in the muggle world, the higher classes expect those being bullied to keep a stiff upper lip, and hold their tongue.
Rolling his eyes at how stupid this is, he crouches until his feet are covered, and waddles across the room. Merlin, why is he cursed like this? As if the war wasn’t bad enough, he now has to waddle across the castle to help an ex-Death Eater who doesn’t even like him.
“Why was this the first place you went?” Harry asks, turning to follow the house elf. He isn’t sure why he asks, exactly, he only feels there has to be something significant about it. Surely a house elf would automatically go to the kitchens, or their living area.
Pansy and Draco have been helping? Two purebloods who have house elves to pamper them every day? Harry can’t help feeling a little suspicious, but he doesn’t want to crush the hopeful look in Hermione’s eyes, so he nods. “Alright. I trust you. Good luck.”
There’s no response, the darkness shrouding Draco’s bed, only showing the faint outline of his figure.
“Master Draco, yes, yes. Poked Jaebo awake, he did. Nasty wand poking Jaebo.” Jaebo grumbles, rubbing his side.
The corkboard hangs between the two staircases, with only one sheet of paper stuck in the middle. Neville is the first to get there, reading the rooms twice before his eyes widen.
Since when was this a thing? Hermione has never read anything about it, even though she spent hours pouring over old texts about house elves.
Their breaths fill the space, stretching like a rubber band about to snap. Harry’s eyes rove over the other boy’s face, heart quickening as the next few moments whizz through his mind prematurely. Malfoy will apologise. Then Harry will say it’s fine, will apologise too, and in that moment everything will be fixed. Or Malfoy will apologise and then Harry will kiss him, and Malfoy will suddenly realise he still loves Harry and he will kiss him back. Or Malfoy will apologise, and confess everything, and Harry will remember some magic to fix Malfoy’s head, and Malfoy will be so grateful that he’ll propose.
Hermione rolls her eyes exasperatedly from the other side of Ron, opposite Harry, evidently struggling to hold in the protest that nargles don’t exist.
Draco groans inwardly. First day, and they’re already in a fight. Blaise can’t calm Pansy, not when she’s like this, and soon they’ll be kicked out of Hogwarts into Azkaban for attacking the Noble Golden Boy.
The death of Tonks had been hard on him, Harry knows that. But when he sees Teddy’s gurgling face, growing up without a father, he’s less sympathetic. Being an orphan is something he’s painfully familiar with.
“Not so busy, regretfully.” She laughs quietly, instinctively. “There is not much to do in the Manor. Although, I suppose there will be much to do soon.”
He doesn’t know why he writes it, but some part of him yearns to go outside. The other parts scream resistance.
The light is too bright on his face. Had Hermione opened the curtains? No, she never comes in this early. Luna? No, she wouldn’t punish him like this. Draco groans, rubbing at his eyes, and reaches down to pull the blankets over his head.
“Just go up to them. They got some magic on it to recognise you. Dark magic, probably, you know what the Malfoys are like. Keep your wand close. She may be an old hag, but her sister was that mad one.”
Is there even any point in him doing this? Draco had seemed happier at the party last week, playing the games and casting small firework charms. Harry remembered the tiny smile that he’d worn, as though his old wand had held all of his former happiness, and it’s now returned to him. He’d even talked to Ron, briefly.
“Narcissa.” He pauses, words clogging up his throat. They don’t seem to want to leave, and he thinks he finally understands why Draco could never force words out. “Narcissa, there’s something I have to tell you.”
“Narcissa…” Harry hates this. He hates this with a burning passion, but he has to do it because this was his fault, and these are the consequences. “Narcissa, Draco is dead.” He forces himself to meet her eyes at this.
Theodore wanders over, face in that flat expression that Draco has come to recognise as irritation. “They’ve separated us.”
“Granger, this sounds like more of an attack than persuasion. Purebloods do still have pride, you know.” Pansy sighs, tossing aside the latest speech Hermione has written up.
“I used to think that I didn’t deserve to be here, when so many better people than me can’t be. I’m sure many of you would have agreed with me. Over time, I realised that I was looking at it all the wrong way.”
He nods, glancing down at the table. Shame fills him. All she wants him to do is eat, and here he is having a massive panic attack over it. His eyes drift over the bread and apple again, hopeful, yet the sickening unrest in his stomach refuses.
“Right, thanks.” Harry mumbles, pushing aside the manic laughs of Bellatrix in his head. “I think I’ll be fine. She did save my life, you know.”
A soft thump startles him from his thoughts. He directs his wand light at Malfoy, who’s sat down heavily, watching the wand in his lap with disbelief. Black wisps of smoke are trailing around his head, forming into words and sentences which scatter as soon as they form. Harry holds his breath, unwilling to disturb the opportunity to read his thoughts.
He motions for the house elf to come closer, then tries pushing himself to his feet once more. The creature’s hands steady him by his waist, wrapping around it and letting him grip the emerald silk on its shoulder for support. Draco, the old Draco, would have felt disgusted by this. Needing a house elf for support? Pathetic. This Draco is far too tired to care.
Limbo is quieter than what Draco had expected. He and Black are the only ones there, drifting between life and death, although Black has said that he expects Draco will move on soon. Apparently many people have passed through here.
Any other suggestions are greatly appreciated, I'd hate to leave you with nothing from me to read for the duration of the fic.
“Hey, hey, it’s okay!” Black, much closer than Draco had realised, pulls him into a hug. “You can stop. I understand. We’ll stick to yes and no, okay?”
They’re sat by the column again. Draco’s head in Sirius’ lap, tears dried up and sobs died down into the oppressive quiet of Limbo. He doesn’t think. His vision is webbed, blue waves rushing over his eyes at the harsh light, but he doesn’t care. He can’t care when he can’t think. He can’t feel sad or lonely or desperate if he can’t think.
Hesitantly, he drops his arm, blinking away the wetness in his eyes. His father is watching him with that cool mask, the one that means he’s trying to hide how lost he is. Draco starts thinking of ways to excuse it, thinks about shoving Harry away, thinks about how disappointed his father will be if he finds out.
“What do you do in there, really?” Parkinson stalks closer, arms folded. “I know you’re not actually teaching him, because he’s under Imperius. Do you make him do your nails? Do your potions homework? Or something a little more…” Her gaze trails down to between Hermione’s legs, and she can’t help flushing and stepping back.
“Me and Harry want to become professors.” Neville explains, bouncing with happiness. “Me in Herbology, Harry in DADA, obviously. I can’t believe she actually said yes! Snape didn’t even get the Potions position until three years after he graduated!”
The battle is over. Draco saw the Dark Lord die, with his own eyes, and a sense of calmness washes over him as he thinks back. It’s fine, now, to leave them. No one will miss him anymore, being such a disappointment, such a waste of space. In all the panic and desperate reunions, no one will care that a Death Eater is gone.
“Awww, come on!” She pouts. “Aren’t you curious about how Looney Lovegood knew about your obsession with phoenixes?”
All of your ideas were amazing! You've given me such inspiration that I think I might do draco-centric fics during my large gakushuu-centric fic, and I'll probably be keeping them to about 10 to 15 chapters each, just so my motivation doesn't run itself dry.
In the end, the ministry lets Black go without trial. Draco has a feeling that’s only because Poppy threw a fit when asked if he could be moved. The poor woman has been running around all of the past few weeks, tending to their needs as well as dealing with the day to day injuries around the school. With the Christmas break in full swing, there has been less than usual, but he’s seen far too many students come in with a broken limb from falling on the ice.
He crumples the paper in his hands, tossing it over his shoulder. His mother can sniff out a lie like a werewolf can sniff out prey.
The world twists around him, knotting his stomach, and then it’s all noise and lights and movement and people, so many people chatting and laughing and pushing past him that he can’t breathe, it’s all too much-
“But I thought it didn’t have any healing properties.” Neville is saying as he approaches, frowning at Luna.
Pansy sighs. “You really want to bring him down here? Into a noisy, crowded room with drunk people?”
“Yes, but it has calming ones, doesn’t it? The animals in the Forbidden Forest like to eat it when it's’ getting close to the full moon. Isn’t it used in some Calming Draughts?” Theo comments, looking to Luna too.
“My son.” She says, voice barely more than a whisper. “You came with news about my boy. Harry, please… please tell me without any twisted words. I want to be clear what has happened. Since he is not here himself, I’m afraid I’m starting to imagine the worst.”
Draco watches hazily as Blaise drops like a stone into Pansy’s arms, the brilliant light gone from his eyes and hands. He isn’t dead. His arm and head ache like hell, but he isn’t dead. He isn’t dead!
“I’ll take that as a yes.” Her heels click against the floor as she walks away, leaving him in the dark and the silence once more.
“It’s actually a really boring talk about being nice to ex-Death Eaters. You wouldn’t like it.” Pansy hums, sipping from the bottle of firewhisky as she watches Finch-Fletchley.
He needs to calm Pansy down, but her back is almost completely turned to him. Speaking is the only option.
“Harry! I thought something had happened to you. I tried calling last night, and- oh. Hello you two.”
He’d been lucky. Draco hadn’t. It seems that now, more than ever, their positions had reversed since the first year of Hogwarts.
“I can’t just leave it alone, though!” Harry kicks at the shards of glass, then turns to glare at Blaise’s newspaper, since he can’t see his face. “This is all your fault. If you hadn’t used so much of my magic, I wouldn’t be-”
Harry huffs, sparing the shattered glass a glance before moving to help. Recharge, that’s what Hermione says. Harry can’t help but think that this is his punishment from some higher power for daring to mess with fate.
The spell! He’d given the book to Theo that morning, before heading off to the Manor. How had he found something already?
“Good riddance.” She mutters, stepping back through into the common room. Most of the people had gathered in a large circle near the fire, gryffindors, slytherins, ravenclaws and hufflepuffs all mixed together like the socks in Potter’s drawers. She has no idea how the boy manages to get matching socks every day, but he must do so, otherwise Brainbox would complain. By complain, she means glare balefully until it is fixed. Merlin knows enough posters of Pansy’s have received that glare.
“Ah.” Lucius falls quiet at that, appraising Draco. “That is… a revelation. I am surprised this skill was kept hidden while I was alive.”
But Malfoy is not like Ron, or Hermione, or Ginny. Malfoy can’t joke without a voice, can’t smile after years of scowls, and can’t shrug when he doesn’t leave his own bed. Harry is left fumbling, trying to edge around difficult topics that he hadn’t realised were sensitive.
Didn't expect this scene to be as long as it is, but at least you get another early chapter out of it! The loose ends are being tied up, the character flaws are being thought about, the jobs are being assigned, and the ending is approaching. I may have underestimated the number of chapters last time I guessed how much there was left, so... I'll say there's around seven chapters left now, give or take.
Nott doesn’t respond as Harry stands, sorts out his clothes, and walks to the door. Just as he’s about to leave, he finally speaks up.
Harry shivers. Something about the way he says it makes the hairs prickle on the back of his neck. Maybe he was right to try and help, to try and cure Draco of this sickness Gobsy thinks he had.
Pansy can’t help but feel hurt. She’s been at that door every hour she can over the past two days, trying to convince him to just speak to her (metaphorically, of course, considering his worrying muteness), and yet the second Potter asks to come in, Draco lets him. Has he been drugged, again? Or under a spell; the Imperius? She wouldn’t put it past him.
Nott pulls down his sleeve again. “Better to be safe than sorry, right?” With that, he pushes open the door to Hagrid’s hut, and heads to the kettle.
That is it, folks. One more chapter, our epilogue, to go, and then this will be the first long story I've ever actually finished. Woo!
It waves a tiny hand back at her, scrambling to hang onto a huge letter S as she picks the paper up.
“No. I suspect he was sent to Limbo.” Theo collapses into a chair, grabbing one of the cups and taking a sip, only to grimace at how cold it is. “And if we find a descendant of Vizzini’s son, we can get him back.”
Draco digs his nails into the palm of his hand, a flood of unexpected resentment rising up inside of him. Black is his family member. Black is his first cousin once removed. Black grew up in the same sort of household as him, yet Black doesn’t care one bit that Draco is dead. Instead, he’s worried about Potter, who seems to be doing just fine without Black.
It has been far too long since I last updated... and this chapter is basically like 'I've forgotten all my plans, let's make a new one'... and this was the best title I could come up with... things are not going well.
The other boy looks at him curiously, tension melting, then pulls up his sleeve. The Dark Mark twists against his arm, faded ink writhing as though in pain, but there’s another line around it. White ink, marked on in a circle of flowers around the Dark Mark. It shines in the sunlight, iridescent and glowing.
The woman who had lived through a war, watched her students die, accepted the post of Hogwarts Headmistress, and been Harry's head of house (that one was probably the most exhausting), rubs her eyes as though Parkinson's refusal is the most wearisome thing she's experienced.
“Sit, Gobsy. We’re both guests here.” She sighs, patting the seat beside her. The house has changed from what she remembers, although she supposes that is the point. Ridding the house of the remnants of her family is entirely why she is here.
2. What should the dorm layout be? Paired by house or mixed up? (any requests for specific pairings are appreciated)
Morgana’s silky hair. Well, if they’re already together, it’ll make no difference if she told her now. “Harry… Harry’s been talking to me since he found out he was gay…”
“What are you going to do?” Luna hums, settling on the floor and turning to him as though she hadn’t just witnessed his first ever breakup.
I will respond to your comments, I swear I will, but the last week or so has been a bit of a rough patch and I haven't done much at all. I only actually wrote the majority of this chapter today. My mood is improving rapidly, ignoring the lack of sleep last night, so I should be back on schedule and writing out new stuff soon.
Then there was the After, when everything fell apart. He couldn’t go home then, with his father in prison and his mother long gone. It was then that he felt her loss most strongly. He’d needed someone to turn to, to tell him what to do when he knew his future was going to be a mess. So he’d gone to Snape, hoping for some sort of advice, however meagre. Snape hadn’t liked that. A Slytherin doesn’t show weakness, a Slytherin fights back, a Slytherin uses his own brain. ‘Don’t make a disgrace of our house again’. The door had slammed in his face, leaving him to wipe away his tears.
No. No, no, no - he can feel it like an amputated arm, the power shrinking away from him and back to the source. Desperately, he reaches his own weak power after it, but it slips through his grasp and then-
From then on, Parkinson - or Pansy, now - joins their study sessions. Harry, obviously, would rather fail at chess with Ron. Or Zabini. Ever since Pansy has been friendly to Hermione, Zabini has been offering Ron a fair chance at beating someone of his own skill. Unsurprisingly, it’s taken Ron a while to accept. Pansy has thankfully kept quiet about Harry’s crush on Draco, so it’s always with trepidation when Hermione hears Pansy deviate from their work.
“Hey, Draco! I brought you some food from the kitchens.” He holds out the treacle tart to him, which is exactly like Potter, because he knows perfectly well that Draco despises it.
Draco nods, and the room quiets as the two of them approach the stand. Harry’s fingers intertwine with his, hidden behind the lecturn, offering something to focus on other than his rising panic and the sea of faces staring at him. Two full year groups, depleted by the war, but still enough to make him rethink everything. Even so, it’s too late to turn back, so he places his paper on the stand and looks to Harry.
Ron huffs, kicking his legs up onto the coffee table. “Git. If someone removed the stick up his arse, I might actually like him.”
“Anyway.” Theodore shakes his head. “Vizzini was famous for creating grand spells that always went wrong if the slightest thing happened. Usually, a mispronounced word makes a spell puff out some smoke or not work at all. In Vizzini’s spells, a mispronounced word could send a building crumbling on top of the caster. You see how specific every part of this spell was? Some think she loved to be the only one who could cast her spells.”
He shrugs again, uncaring. She could think what she liked of him. Eventually she will see the monster he really is, when they arrive at school with all the whispering and the glaring. Maybe that’s what he is scared of. Not the questions, but the answers. He’s not ready for them to know how horrific his true nature is.
Relief fills Harry’s stomach as he repeats the words in his head. He didn’t kill Draco. He didn’t, because Draco can be saved, and the stupid spell and the blood and his blank eyes don’t mean anything because Draco can be saved, he can be alive, and his death won’t be on Harry’s hands. He can smile, and laugh, and live out the rest of his life, because they can save Draco. They can save him.
After a while, the sobs die down, and Harry helps wipe his eyes dry as they sit back. Except for the occasional sniffle, the world around them is silent.
Warm arms wrap around him, lifting his body away from the cold floor. Pain stabs into his ribs for a moment, making him hiss in pain, but then it fades as the arms adjust him.
Michael's face turns the shade of a Salamander's tongue; that is to say, incredibly red. Unfortunately, with only a small number of them, sniggering is out of the question. Harry settles for covering his smirk.
“No, you’re not. Draco, can we please talk together? I think you’ll want to hear this.” She says gently.
“Draco! Careful with that paintbrush, darling!” Pansy squeals, jumping away from the accidental flick of paint flying her way.
“I’m not as stuck up as the others, if that’s what you’re thinking.” Nott glances at him. “I don’t care about any of the pureblood stuff. If Hagrid lets me work with him, I don’t have any reason to hate him. Half giant or not.”
“Harry. May I call you Harry?” Narcissa stands as he walks back in, setting the empty cup down. “How are you feeling? I know this must not be a pleasant place to be.”
“So stay out of my business, Potter.” Nott spits, voice trembling ever so slightly. “Stay out of my business, and I’ll stay out of yours. Permanently.” Tucking the shivering plant under his arm, Nott shoves Harry’s shoulder as he storms out.
Shit. He hadn’t thought this far ahead. “Uhm, so, I saw you sitting here, and you didn’t look all that happy, so-”
“Blaise, darling, sweetheart, lovely rose of my soul.” Pansy drifts in next to them, slipping her arm through Blaise’s. “Your intelligence and bravery take my breath away, and I’ve never seen anyone with better fashion sense than you, my-”
“Look at me, spilling my heart out to the Boy Who Lived Twice.” Nott smirks, slipping into the seat opposite. “If I’m giving you some blackmail material, you may as well give me yours. I can’t exactly hold a panic attack over you without feeling dirty. Come on. Spill, Saviour.”
Apologies for the late update, though. At least it's given me time to have a plan for the next few chapters, and a one-shot I want to do with both Draco and Gakushuu, my favourites, as the main characters. Tell me if you want to see it done, and I'll start it as soon as possible (along with everything else of course...).
Footsteps. The others have run off, now that Potter is distracted. Unfortunately, Draco didn’t see their faces before he fell. Not like he could tell McGonagall or Slughorn anyway. Potter almost murdered him in sixth year, and got away with detention. Four Gryffindors only kicking him around a bit? They’d get a medal.
He creeps closer, one hand clutching the edge, one hand tentatively reaching out. His fingertips fade right as a tingle of magic rushes over his body. So, there is actually a spell there. Emboldened, he prepares to step out when he makes the fatal mistake.
Both girls turn to glare at him, and he holds his hands up defensively. ‘Didn’t say it was wrong for them to want to be free. They’re just scared.’
“Remember, it’s like reaching out a hand.” Theo calls from behind him, notes and books on the table in front of him. They’d gone over this hundreds of times in the last few days, so neither he nor Hermione truly needed to be there. Still, if it comforted them to keep reminding him of what he had to do, he’d put up with them.
“Do up your buttons.” She downs the rest of the cup. “If you want to date me, I won’t have you being ogled by other girls, got it?”
Leave, now. Harry only makes things worse by messing with other people’s business. Quick steps to the door, pushing aside a growing idea. Not now. She’s just lost both her husband and her son.
As ever, anything you would like to say, be it questions, ideas, or just random thoughts, please leave in the comments! I love reading what you think of the chapters.
Theodore hesitates in the doorway, watching McGonagall as she writes. The gargoyles had let him in without a password, which he takes as a good sign, but his request isn’t easy. Draco had said goodbye. Draco must have known, somehow. He sighs, backing off, suddenly uncertain. Maybe this was a bad idea, maybe Draco’s farewell hadn’t meant that he should do this.
“Two times this month.” The portrait behind her whispers, and she repeats it to Pansy, who suddenly looks gobsmacked.
Sure enough, entering fifteen minutes later with three cups of tea, she finds the two of them slogging through the mountain of work. She joins them, passing out the tea and settling down on a cushioning charm. Parkisnon mutters a reluctant thanks, and they sit quietly. Time ticks by. Eventually, Parkinson sighs, and holds out her hand to Hermione.
“How are you here?” His father’s grey eyes flick over him, hand dropping to rest by his side. “I thought- But you were at Hogwarts- You should have been safe!”
The knot in his chest constricts more at his words. Lovely. Blaise just had to give a bloody challenge. A few moments of expectant silence follows, interspersed with whispers, but no one takes the bait. Spinning back around, Blaise marches to an empty carriage, scoffing as he goes.
Nott notices the action, and tenses. “Hm. I thought you didn’t care about that stuff anymore.” His voice is a little bitter.
So maybe he can’t speak, and maybe he always feels shit, and maybe he can’t see much of a future for himself.
“Parkinson, Draco isn’t under Imperius…” Hermione says gently, biting her lip in worry. She can feel her forehead creasing again, like it always does these days. She’s going to get early wrinkles.
Carefully, he reaches to his thigh, pinching the skin there. At the same time, he flicks his other finger in the air, spelling out letters in his usual black smoke… which doesn’t appear. Frowning, he tries again, briefly noting that the pinch didn’t hurt. Definitely a dream. But why wouldn’t he be able to cast magic in a dream?
Yes, I know, that's a very lazy title for this chapter but I can't think of a better one. I think quarantine is turning my brain to mush. I hope you're all staying inside and staying safe.
Hermione yells, starts ordering people to move, pulling Pansy away from- pulling at her and at Harry’s arm, telling him to not look at- telling him to move away from-
Eyes welling up, Harry can only manage a single nod before walking out, regret tasting sour in his mouth.
Begging, now. They should all beg. He is powerful. He is far above them. He could set fire to this world and build it anew.
There’s a tense silence as the two of them stand there, Harry straining towards going up, and Draco recoiling from the place where his life went to shit. Eventually, Harry sighs and moves away from it, crestfallen.
White material shines back at him. Confused, he pulls the last of the paper off, and stares at the blank canvas and painting set. What does this mean? Is the blank canvas supposed to signify that he and Harry don’t have a future together?
“Yes, thanks.” Harry nods, hands twisting nervously together. “Professor, have you thought about what I said yesterday?”
“I’m sorry about what happened. Pomfrey says you weren’t hurt too bad, but they shouldn’t have done that. Especially with what happened with No- Oh. Sorry.”
He walks forward, taking the chair opposite McGonagall and clasping his hands in his lap. She carries on writing, quill flicking in the air, but nods to him as though to give him permission to speak.
‘It’s just a lot to take in’ is what he tries to write, but every letter rains down on him before he can finish a single word. After the third time, he makes a frustrated noise and kicks at the railing.
He suddenly realises he’s been staring again, and sharply glances away. He’s not stalking the ferret. He wasn’t stalking him in sixth year either, no matter what Luna says, he was only trying to find out what he was up to. And he had been right, as well! Luna and the whole lot of them can shut up about it.
“Oh!” Luna jumps up again in realisation. “I forgot to talk to Red Hawk this morning. I need to go.” She drops the plant into Ginny’s lap, and dashes off, hair flowing behind her. Ginny stares at the plant, which waves at her feebly.
"Try not to hit someone, Ron." Luna smiles sweetly, letting Ginny pull her into the stream of departing students.
He can’t tell her what he’s done. He deserves to be dead, not Draco. He has no one waiting at home for him, no one who would be all alone without him. Draco had done anything and everything to protect his mother, had been the only person he truly protected and loved, and he hadn’t even said goodbye to her. Because of Harry.
Then Malfoy scowls at him, ignoring the box, and turns over to put his back to Harry. Conversation over.
Harry sits down beside him, wrapping an arm around his waist as Draco pulls the blankets over Harry too. “Anything for you.” He mumbles.
“I don’t-” He has to cut himself off as the haul comes to a standstill, both Draco’s and the mysterious newcomer’s magic halting his progress.
Harry sighs, standing again to join the quickly gathering crowd around Hermione. It doesn’t take her long to order everyone into a line and have their names down, so Harry reaches the front relatively quickly.
They sit there for a while. Harry doesn’t know how long, yet the feel of Malfoy curled up in his arms makes the time irrelevant. Neither move, except for Malfoy’s weakening sobs. It’s… nice.
“I’ve read up on the creator of the spell. It’s a witch named ‘Halosydne Vizzini’.” His dark brown eyes rest on Harry as though the name should mean something to him. It doesn’t.
Draco takes Luna’s tea absentmindedly, draining it in one long depressed sip. He’d always assumed he’d die before he grew up. Now he thinks about it, the future is just as unsteady as the war had been.
Draco pulls his knees to his chest, letting them fall into contemplative silence. The Ministry ambition had mostly been his father’s hopes, and now that he thinks about it, it’s hard to see how he would have any chance of being accepted there. Hogwarts is bad enough. Working with potions would be nice, but he couldn’t find work in Saint Mungos. Who would put their life in the hands of an ex-Death Eater?
Draco shakes his head in exasperation, giving Harry a quick kiss on the cheek before following Pansy. Oh, well. Harry sighs, walking into the hall by himself. The house elf drawing can be quite clingy sometimes, so Draco usually carries a sketch of a room in his pocket for Jaebo to drop into when he needs him.
Blaise tenses, nose sticking in the air defensively. “Nonsense. That brat should be left to fend for himself.”
“Harry!” Hermione calls, ignoring the odd dip in volume as she brings Draco over to him. “Do you remember where you put Draco’s old wand?”
She’d been confused, at first, but with every sincere gesture Blaise did, Pansy felt her heart softening. It had been a while since someone had tried to win her heart rather than just her body. Even so, she plans to wrap the man around her pinky finger before she lets him kiss her. Better to have a well-trained man than a reckless one.
His legs ache from climbing, but he’s almost there. Gritting his teeth, he makes it up the last few steps, and gazes out from the top of the Astronomy Tower. Dumbledore, the bias manipulative old fool, died here. His body fell from… there. Draco leans over the railing, eyes roaming over the destruction, and focuses on the exact point the body hit the ground.
There’s no response. Draco is likely still asleep, so Harry shifts the tray onto one arm and reaches for the door handle, twisting it. The plate of food tilts alarmingly, pastries threatening to spill over the side, but Harry doesn’t mind. If they do, he can just go back to the kitchens and get more. Draco will be too happy to mind.
“Study hard and think about things and be smart.” Draco summarises, closing his eyes and snuggling further into his father’s warmth. “And then I can be the best, and I can fly really really high and I can fly all the way up to grandma and tell her about my school and the garden and the things I’ve been practising, and she can tell me what it’s like where she is…”
“I know… I know what you did after the battle. Remus - I mean, Remus Lupin -gave me the letter last night. Will you please let me in?”
Then the news had spread. It’s hard to keep a secret in Hogwarts, now, especially when Harry’s involved. So he’d walked through the corridors, avoiding the disgusted glances of eighth years and the disgusting celebrations from the younger years, which made his skin crawl. How can they be happy that Draco is dead? How can they congratulate him for killing an innocent boy?
“Vizzini’s son brought people out of Limbo. Blaise might be able to do that. He can get both Sirius and Draco out of there at the same time!”
Along with my mock exams and rehearsals for a play, I now need to spend a lot of time with her rather than writing this.
“Thanks everyone for coming.” Harry starts off, tapping the top of the lectern to set off the amplifying spell. His voice carries across the hall, making those who hadn’t been paying attention turn to look at them. “It’s been a strange last few days, knowing that we’ll never come back here, but I hope you’ve all enjoyed yourselves tonight.” A cheer at that. “I’ll say a few words at the end, but there’s someone else who’d like to speak first. Please be kind, as I know he’d be to you.”
Woah. Woah. This is getting far too weird for Pansy’s liking. Time to back out of this situation real quick. “Ok.” She squeaks, backing up and fleeing the common room as fast as she can. Phew. What was that about?! They were having a completely normal conversation, and then suddenly Blaise had to agree with her. Agree. Like they hadn’t been at each other’s throats for the past seven years about that precise topic.
“You’re so cruel.” Blaise sighs, turning back to a hopeful Harry and Theo. “Alright, alright. Of course I’m going to do it. He is my best ‘bro’, after all.”
A white and brown stick emerges from the packet as Theo gives him an unimpressed look, one eyebrow raised. It almost rivals Draco’s. “To smoke? Merlin, Harry, Draco was right about you. You really aren’t the brightest glow worm.”
It hadn’t been so bad, at first. McGonagall had looked disappointed, upset, making Harry sink in his seat, but her punishment had been light. Monitored magic use, along with the job of telling Narcissa her son is dead. Harry isn’t looking forward to it, yet he knows it could have been a lot worse. He has a feeling McGonagall didn’t want the Ministry involved. They can’t do anything to Harry without public protest.
He can feel the wispy strands of sleep creeping up on him, coating his mind in a fuzzy haze. His father’s hand on his hand slows, silence drifting over them for a few seconds, letting Draco slip further into the comfortable darkness.
The grinning. The smug sniggering every time one of those words floated past, turning another Gryffindor red. He’d seen this coming for a while, just didn’t want to admit it. Theo’s mask doesn’t mean he’s calm. It means he’s planning how to get revenge later.
Draco opens his mouth a fraction, to retort or apologise, he has no idea, but his voice snags. Lowering his head, he snatches his trunk from the floor and climbs into the train, all too aware of the whispers caused by their confrontation. They only continue down the train, faces glaring at him from inside the compartments, until he finally finds an empty one and collapses in it, sealing the door with an anti-alohomora locking charm and conjuring a curtain over the window. Silence. Breathing out a long sigh, he rests his head back and closes his eyes, praying for a restful journey. Unfortunately, life has other plans. Only a few minutes into the train ride, sharp rapping yanks him from his stupor.
Draco turns his wand over in his hand. There’s a few scratches, here and there, that Draco definitely had not put there himself. Damn Potter and his careless habits. Although, in the end, it is really Draco’s fault for making all the decisions that led to the wand being taken in the first place.
Carefully, Draco shakes his head. The elated feeling bubbles through him, lifting his chin high and shoving his thoughts away. ‘Can we stay? I bet I could beat Potter in a game of Exploding Snap.’
Portraits whisper to each other as they pass, grinning at the Gryffindors, sneering at the Slytherins. Further on they go, memories passing them like fading laughter, until they reach a dimly lit corridor with slits of windows. At the end is a large gap in the wall, as though a giant has stuck his fist through it. Filch doesn’t seem to have realised his mistake, however, as he carries on walking towards it.
“Idiot.” Remus sighs fondly. “You love motorcycles and pranks. I don’t know what you’re complaining about. Besides, you should open it and start reading if you’re going to make a judgement on it.”
“S.P.E.W. actually.” Hermione huffs, feeling the familiar anger rise up in her. She still can’t understand why everyone was so against it. Even her own friends! Especially Ron! “And before you say anything, I’ve stopped it. I know ‘the house elves don’t want to be free’, ‘they’re happy as they are’, et cetera, et cetera.”
Luna is the only one who sticks around. She invites him to talk to the thestrals, to collect herbs, to knit scarves and sew outfits. He thinks about how she’d greeted Draco at the start of the year, all kindness and smiles, ready to forgive him for everything, and he feels sick to his stomach. She reminds him too much of Draco. Her long blonde hair is light and fluffy, like Draco’s halo of hair, and her pale skin and quiet manner sparks images of Draco on his good days. She smiles, a smile that Draco used to receive, half pity and half love.
“Ah, yes.” Remus nods. “Been a while since I heard that name. I’m pretty sure I had to explain them to Sirius at least six times.” His face turns wistful, and Harry feels that pit in his stomach again when he thinks of Sirius. The pain has dulled, but it is there.
“Don’t you feel it, sometimes?” She shivers. “Some magic leaves a trace. Mine, not so much. Blaise’s, yours, Draco’s, Dumbledore’s, the Dark Lord’s - anyone’s that holds a little more power than the rest of us. I’m betting yours could infect people too, if you let it.”
A whisper of a memory drifts through his mind. McGonagall at the first feast of the year, reminding them to be civil to each other. Warning them about what’s happening on the outside. Telling them of vigilantes, who take revenge on their lost loved ones, killing anyone associated with Death Eaters. How far could they go? Draco hadn’t been paying attention. To kill the person who made all of the deaths possible, of course they’d break into Hogwarts.
Draco swallows. He schools his expression blank, gets to his feet, and tries to pretend that Potter wasn’t standing right in front of him expecting an answer. A nod is all he gives to the stranger (he’s just a stranger don’t look don’t look don’t look) as he picks up his trunk and marches off.
Another day passes, and when he’s spacing out over another game of chess with Ron, Hermione eventually decides to intervene.
Crackling yellow spells attract his attention to a dining room, door open yet sealed off with magic. He can feel the pulsing heart of dark magic inside of there, hear the screeching frost stabbing into him, and knows he could walk in that room and let himself be ripped apart by it.
She watches the chair, a sort of delighted satisfaction on her face. “This will be so much easier for you now. Why don’t we go back and try a few spells out?”
Harry winces, watching Ginny and Luna exchange a knowing look. Yes, the lack of press or media anywhere near Hogwarts may have made him more biased towards getting it, but he wanted the job anyway. He doesn’t necessarily have to do magic, only say the theory and show them the spell a few times. It’s one of the few places in the world in which he can trust everyone there, and the only place in the world that’s ever felt like his true home. Plus, the taste of teaching during Umbridge’s reign made him feel important and worthwhile, helping people through teaching instead of fighting all the time.
‘No. I can’t.’ Draco places down the cup, a painful twisting in his gut. ‘I don’t hate you. But I can’t love you, not like this. Goodbye, Theo. Good luck.’
“I won’t, I promise. Oh, I really should talk to you more often!” Pansy squeals. “Anyway, what has that got to do with Draco?”
Hermione regards it wearily, mind tearing out all the ways this could go wrong, yelling at her to leave and never speak to any of these fascist bullies ever again. Instead, she takes the hand and shakes it. “Truce.”
Yes, maybe this question is a little for my own benefit, but I really can't decide. He can't be locked up or killed, but other than that the floor is open to any ideas you might have. Let the jury of the comments section decide!
“Please, take a seat.” Narcissa smiles, a ghostly beauty even in her older age. Harry sits on the edge of an armchair, the cushion stiff and uncomfortable beneath him. He wonders for a second why they would have such a horrible armchair when they have so much money. Then he remembers how Draco had more pride than common sense, and he sighs internally.
Filch, Mrs Norris at his heel, hobbles forward. It’s amazing that the cat has managed to survive this long, considering her age. Harry’s surprised to find he doesn’t feel disappointed by this. Perhaps he’s developed a soft spot for her and her owner, considering that they’ve been consistently there, unchanging, throughout all his years. What a horrid thought.
Hm. He supposes he might need that. The ringing in his ears really isn’t pleasant, and maybe Poppy will give him more of that potion that helps him sleep.
Tears are streaking down his father’s face too. “Can you forgive me, Draco? I didn’t mean for you to get hurt. I didn’t mean for it to ever get this bad. I wanted us to be happy, to be powerful, to be alive and together. He forced my hand, Draco, I knew he’d kill us all if I didn’t let him recruit you. I failed you. Please, my son, my beautiful boy, please forgive me!”
“In your dreams, Potter.” Theo mumbles as he lights up his cigarette, dropping the packet onto the table and turning to his books. “If you can find this asshole, maybe I will, actually.”
Hermione’s face flames red as Pansy contains her snort of laughter. Harry shakes his head, trying not to get that image stuck in his head. “Blaise, please, let’s just go. We need to work out the specifics.”
“Nah.” Ron frowns, shifting between his feet. “Imagine if it didn’t work. She’d be even more crushed.” He exchanges a glance with Harry. “Losing a son once is bad enough.”
No, it’s not ok. He hurt Theo… No, he’s Theodore, now. Or Nott. Draco doesn’t love him, he knows that, or else he wouldn’t have made him bleed. But neither does he hate him. Perhaps if they hadn’t kissed each other, then they might have become each other’s support to get through difficult times. Friends are always far better than lovers. Besides, attraction isn’t the same as love. Just because Theodore has a nice face and muscles doesn’t mean Draco loves him, not at all. They should’ve stayed friends. If he hadn’t accepted Theodore’s kiss, maybe he wouldn’t be feeling like this.
“I thought he would be happy. I didn’t want him to be sad anymore. I’m sorry. I made a mistake, a horrible mistake, and now I can’t take it back.” Harry sniffles, nails pressing into his cup. “I’m sorry.”
The group looks startled, all except Luna, and gather around closer to stare at the tiny house elf drawing.
“Yeah. Oh! Yeah, in there, it said that every house elf who becomes a slave must be kept fairly, with bedding and nourishment. Before that, house elves were sort of like strays. Any house elf brought in could easily be replaced, so every one was in fear of being kicked out and left to starve again. That’s why they made the HEEA.” Pansy nods, then scowls. “I hate knowing all that. Makes me sound like a weird bookworm.”
She snorts, standing and folding her arms. “There’s no way you’re as fabulous as a phoenix. Only I could achieve that.” With that, she flicks her hair and turns to march off, waiting for him to argue back.
She slaps his arm lightly. “No touching until you’ve put your wand away. I refuse to be the victim of an accidental spell.”
Furious, he turns towards the Slytherins, certain that they had purposefully arranged this so they can murder him while he sleeps. Stormy grey eyes catch his for a second, before flicking away in fear.
Pansy. He wishes she would leave him alone. It’s harder to focus on dying when she’s there, reminding him of all the pain he will cause.
“What music?” She shrugs, blocking the hole in the wall. A burst of laughter comes through, despite the enchantments. “I don’t hear anything. Maybe you should go to Pomfrey, hallucinations aren’t a good sign.”
Eventually, like everything in his life, his temporary happiness is abruptly cut off by the screeching of brakes. He groans in annoyance as she lifts his head off her, complaining about her pins and needles.
Why?! He could speak before, he could speak to Theodore and Pansy and Blaise before, he could speak when he had nothing important to say. He told them stupid things, like ‘I hate baked potatoes’ and ‘I think Neville is crying over a dead plant’. Why can’t he say ‘I love you’?
She wasn’t lying. The noise hits him like a bludger, laughs and shouts and for some reason, crying. He’s surprised no teacher has made the trek up here to yell at them for the volume of the music, but then he feels the wards on the doorway. Blaise’s work, he thinks. Then he wonders why on earth he would know that.
Ron and Hermione share The Look. They’ve also been doing that a lot lately. It’s the sort of despairing expression that radiates knowledge which really shouldn’t be shared. It annoys Harry. Since when did Ron and Hermione suddenly become the ones to behave like a carer for an especially difficult child?
“H-harry?!” One of them, Harry is too furious to recognise faces, stands. “But- but- they broke the points jar! And they-”
“There’s nice buttery croissants, and warm pain au chocolat, and tea with heaps of sugar, just how you like it.” Harry coaxes, certain that the smell will wake Draco up.
“Hey, hey, it’s ok!” Harry pulls him into a hug, arms holding him tightly. “You don’t have to tell me right now. I understand.”
For now, they sit in silence, both leaning against a column. He doesn’t know how long he’s been here - the light never changes from bright white, and his body feels like it’s floating. Does time even exist in Limbo? He isn’t sure.
The Great Hall has been decorated with bright colours, banners strung from every wall and plates of food floating through the air. Originally, this was supposed to be a relaxed event to say goodbye to everyone, but Hermione had somehow managed to commandeer the whole thing into a F.H.E. event (Free the House Elves. Pansy had flat-out refused to keep calling it S.P.E.W.) and now boxes for donations and sign up sheets are everywhere in sight. Ron had been skeptical, until Blaise had drawn him into an idea about house elf themed wizarding chess. Now their prototype chess board sits by a wall, a group of seventh years poking at the figures.
A hand, clawing out the darkness even as Draco’s high scream fills the air, even as Harry slumps down beside him. He drags out more power, more energy, crushing the darkness in a fist, shattering it and banishing it completely. There. All gone.
“Come on, it’s time you enjoy your own party.” He grins, taking her waist again and leading her to the circle. She rests her head on his shoulder, feeling the pleasant tingle of being tipsy.
Suddenly, a loud bang startles the two of them, saving him from having to explain that awkward secret. They whip their heads to face the noise, and dissolve into laughter when they see it’s only the two boys at Hagrid’s setting off fireworks. There’s faint yelling from some teacher out of a window, and the two figures sprint back into the cabin, letting the sparkling dragon twist about in the air.
“Listen up!” Pansy’s voice cuts through the low bubbling of conversation. “There’s a party in here tomorrow, ‘kay? Bring firewhisky and anyone else who isn’t here right now. Except for Theodore, Justin and sixth year or under, obviously. Oh, and you either gotta pay to get in or donate time for making flyers and posters, cause we’re raising money for a charity. Got it? Good.” She flicks her hair and saunters out, leaving Hermione with a sign up sheet.
Theo visits. He brings a glowing white flower with him, setting it by his bedside table and leaving a small jug of water with it. They don’t talk. After half an hour, he leaves again, tending to the grounds and the creatures lurking in the forest. Draco’s glad he’s found something to dedicate himself to, other than killing and torturing innocent people. He has to remind himself that he and Theo were similar, once, and then he spends the rest of the next two days thinking about every gentle touch they shared. It hurts, especially when Harry comes and tries taking his hand.
Easy for you to say! You were always- always better at controlling everything. It all went your way!
“Yes, I know.” No, bad move. Don’t interrupt. “I’m sorry, headmistress, but I’ve thought about this a lot. They only want me here so they can keep an eye on me.”
“In a hundred years time, they’re not gonna believe how much of an idiot you were, you know? Our grandkids are gonna think we were either lying about the spell you used, or just that we were complete idiots for praising you to the high heavens.”
He jumps to his feet, walking away as quick as his legs will take him, a clawing horror in his stomach forcing him to move, constantly move, or else the guilt will catch up with him and he’ll be punished. Hermione tries to stop him as he leaves the classroom, but he pushes past her. He needs to get out.
Hesitantly, he takes Harry’s hand and hauls himself up, blankets wrapped around his shoulders tightly. They make their way out of the common room, through the corridors and around staircases, ducking into rooms whenever teachers pass by. Technically, they’re allowed to wander around in the night, since it’s the holidays and they’re eighth years, but Harry had argued that it was more fun this way. Draco agrees, although he wouldn’t ever admit to it. This sort of thing is supposed to be far beneath him.
The letters drizzle down onto the floor in fat droplets, but neither of them comment. Instead, Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads them up slowly, checking back every few seconds to see if he’s ok. He has to stop, once or twice, to push away the memories (green flash, mad laugh, the trees waving below for him to just lean a little bit more and join them) yet within twenty minutes they’re at the top and he can finally breathe.
“I don’t know. I left that to Hermione.” Ron mumbles, suddenly serious, and Harry winces. His guilt had never truly vanished. Most days after the battle, he’d stared at the ceiling every night, wondering how many people he could have saved if he’d just done something a little differently. Luckily, he’d had so many wonderful friends to help him through it, and now he manages to stop the spiralling thoughts.
"What are you doing here?" The Golden Boy jabs, and it's almost funny how annoyed he is, except it isn't. It really isn't, because Draco knows why he's annoyed. He would be annoyed too if the person who'd caused the death of so many friends was standing right in front of him.
Here he is, trapped in a school of people who despise him, and the only person he’s opened up to in years attacked him. It was only a prank. He was only trying to defend himself, because Merlin knows he needs to. All those bruises and cuts didn’t form by themselves.
“I know the feeling. Becoming Mrs Malfoy was a little bizarre for me, after so long as ‘the youngest Miss Black’.” She picks up the cup again, fingers rubbing against the handle like it is a talisman. “Although now I suppose I shall become ‘the widow, Mrs Malfoy’. How things change.”
‘First, the spellcaster must prepare a meal dipped in the following potion, and offer it to the intended. If the intended accepts, the Votum spell cannot be cast. However, the spellcaster cannot explain to the intended that they should not accept, as this would reverse the spell to grant the spellcaster their worst fear.’
“Look, what’s done is done.” Pansy throws her hands up, rolling her eyes. “Frankly, I think we should be focusing more on the fact that they’re alive. They’re alive! I don’t give a shit about whether or not the ministry hates us - that part should be obvious, considering the fact we’ve brought an ex-Death Eater back to life. They can’t lock Black away for something he didn’t do. We have proof he didn’t do it. So maybe you lot should be helping with the presents instead of moping about!”
Except he doesn’t. The second morning of his return to Hogwarts life, he comes into the common room to find Pansy, Hermione, and Blaise standing over a pile of burning letters. He doesn’t say anything. Neither do they. He’ll thank them, at some point, when the white smoke doesn’t constantly turn into rain when he feels emotional.
“Trust me, Harry, having a huge gash in his arm will probably be better than having the Dark Mark.” Theo’s voice lowers at this, his own fingers rubbing at the fabric over his own arm. “It’s like a living thing in there.”
Not for Remus, though. Having only Andromeda’s place to go, Remus had decided he would do Harry a favour and renovate Grimmauld Place. What he truly meant was that Andromeda reminded him too much of Tonks. And so, they switched places. Harry stayed with Andromeda over the summer, looking after Teddy, and Remus holed up in Grimmauld Place with Kreacher. The Burrow had been no place for Harry, still isn’t, without Fred’s laughter lightening it up.
(‘Harry, stop.’ White smoke, still new to him, and hard to conjure without his poor wand. ‘I understand. You did something stupid to try and make me happy. I’ve done a lot worse, I think I can forgive you for one stupid mistake. I’m alive, right?’)
This took a long time to write... but here it is! Chapter nine. Harry's perspective, again. Last chapter was very fluffy, and I had planned for this one to go back into angst, but I haven't managed to get to that point yet. Next chapter, I promise.
Any ideas, please leave in the comments, I love hearing what you think! And apologies for spelling and grammar mistakes, I don't yet proofread my work.
My cat keeps meowing at me and trying to open this cupboard, so I really can't think of much to say. She's an adorable fluffball, but I really can't deal with her sometimes...
Instead, it’s Theo who comes first. He runs in, bag swinging wildly from his shoulder, and drops into a chair beside Draco. His stony face breaks the second he knows no one is watching, worry and fear in his eyes. “I heard rumours but I didn’t think they’d actually have- I’m so sorry, Dragon! Who did it?!”
“On the way in? Careful, you don’t know what you’ll find in there.” The ministry worker chuckles, punching his shoulder lightly. “Might be some stray curses from You Know Who! Still, I’m sure you could stop ‘em. You are the Saviour, after all!”
Finally, Malfoy’s lips open. Silence. He makes a strangled noise, pale cheeks flushing, and instantly snaps his mouth shut again.
The second day was a little better, even when they saw the article from the previous day. A small group of them had a bonfire for each newspaper in the morning, then headed down for the events of the day. Over the last few months, they had gathered together a portfolio of their work over their last year, and each of them had a small corner to display their work. Prospective employers wandered around, chatting to students who were hoping for last minute arrangements. Employers who’d already accepted students came to check over the work, assessing them for the job as well as taking in others’ work.
It's been amazing all of the support you've given me, every comment has made me so happy to read! Those of you who've answered every single question (you know who you are) have really blown my mind with how dedicated you are to this. I've never been so happy at reading that someone's from Gryffindor house, or that someone has a dog and a cat. I'd love to hear more about all of you whenever I write another Draco fanfic, if you're willing to read it. This has been such a wonderful experience, seeing genuine reactions to what I write.
“This is the last day you’re wallowing in self-pity. Tomorrow, I’m gonna drag your ass out of there so we can eat ice cream and plan revenge on Nott, ok?”
Harry flicks to the next page, only half concentrating on the words now. This is the best thing for Draco. Something that is guaranteed to make him happy, for longer than one night.
Harry hates the feeling. He wants the casual joke, like with Ron, where nothing will ever annoy, not anymore, because they can laugh it off far too easily. He wants the gentle smile, like with Hermione, where they can talk about anything and everything, and the other will know exactly what to say. He even wants the awkward shrug, like with Ginny, where they know every shade of hate and love, so fall into the on-off structure. At least then he would know that no matter what he does, at some point he will be accepted again.
Harry’s voice stops behind him. Draco doesn’t notice, delighting in the feel of his voice rumbling in his throat, bursting out and speaking words he’s trapped inside for so long.
Harry grins at McGonagall, who returns a stiff yet affectionate smile. The four of them, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and himself, settle on a bench together. It seems that only three or four eighth years have returned from each house, all from a single friend group.
I've had the idea for this for ages, ever since I wrote 'wearing their new uniform' in chapter one. Dobby should have survived, but this idea of giving his grave the new uniform, even if he couldn't wear it, was just too tempting.
“Oh, it wasn’t serious.” She reassures, smiling back at the giggling pixie in the portrait behind her. “At least, not for Blaise. Draco told me they’d laughed it off, since they were both drunk and high at the time.”
He’d glanced up, stormy eyes set in dark sockets, looking more and more like a skeleton every day. He rarely answers her questions, instead nodding or shaking his head. She supposes the spell must be tiring; it’s not one she’s read about before, and new spells always take years to condense down into an easier version. So he simply stared, a blank expression on his face.
He shudders, stuttering breaths trying desperately to follow the steady noise of the figure beside him. In. Out. He needs to breathe. Slower, gentler, until the world comes into focus. The hand reaches out hesitantly, so he grabs onto it, feeling the firm skin beneath him like an anchor to reality.
Hermione and Ron are curled up together on a loveseat, closest to the fire, while Neville is sitting on a beanbag. Apparently, he has one at home.
Black shrugs, flicking the first one open. Abruptly, blue smoke floods across the open page, swirling into an image, until a fully fledged motorcycle forms on the page, driving around by itself in the air as a voice bursts out. Draco narrows his eyes at the smoke as the voice starts narrating the history and parts of the vehicle, and… yes. It’s the smoke he uses, the one they all learnt in third year to pay attention in history classes.
He lets out a huge sigh of relief, a beam spreading across his face. “Merlin, thank you, Professor McGonagall!”
With Harry’s solid weight behind him, and his friends falling over each other in their pride for him, he’s so glad he came back to Hogwarts.
He gasps, heaving air into his lungs as his father approaches, white robes flapping slightly in the non-existent wind. Draco tries to stand, muscles automatically tensing in anticipation at the sight of him, and shame floods through him as he realises this. He’s scared of his own father.
Hermione shivers, opening her mouth to answer, but is interrupted by the door swinging open by itself. Parkinson pushes past her, storming into the room, and pulls up as she sees Draco. Sighing in resignation, Hermione follows, flicking a quick incendio at the candles littered around.
“Harry stalked Draco, Gin.” A dreamy voice supplies from behind Ron, who jumps and curses as he splashes himself with gravy.
They’d talked about it a few days ago. Hermione had just started to settle into their sessions, talking to him a little more, and her curiosity had got the better of her.
“It’s not that, it’s just…” Neville trails off, clearing his throat awkwardly. “You two, in a room next to us… the walls aren’t great at hiding noise…”
“Draco?” Luna’s honest blue eyes gaze at him, and he knows she would never lie. If she thinks Draco would want to hear this, he should, right? He trusts her, even if he doesn’t trust Theodore anymore. Slowly, he nods his head.
‘Wonderful.’ Draco spells, and he means it. Everything else may have completely gone to shit, but his wand still accepts him. Carefully, he shoots a wingardium leviosa, and the chair he aims at doesn’t shoot to the ceiling and set on fire. It lifts, gently, carefully, precisely, just like his spells used to. It feels both familiar and foreign, but it feels absolutely wonderful. A smile rises onto his face.
Draco remembers in third year, when he’d sat in the bed opposite him, accepting piles of sweets from all of his friends in Slytherin, and those friends with his family. Now his bedside only holds a single chocolate box from his mother, who sits with his hand in hers and a small smile on her face.
“Hello!” Black calls from beside him, watching as the group of people swarm into the wing with two wrapped boxes. “Is that food? Merlin, please say it is, I’m starving!”
Pansy raises her eyebrows. “Uhm, that’s not what I was going to say. I actually think it’s quite good.”
“Merlin’s beard, Harry. Are you gonna crush on every Slytherin?” Ron collapses into another chair, throwing the cushion at the snake painting on the wall, which hisses at him and slithers away.
Harry crouches in front of him, taking his hands gently. Malfoy flinches, taking in a huge gulp of air, right as the smoke vanishes without warning. Grey eyes flick up to meet green, guilt flashing across them as sharp as a dragon’s tooth. Malfoy looks so vulnerable, so ashamed of what he’s done, pinched face twisting with disgust at himself. Harry recognises that look - he saw it in the mirror every day as a child. But he doesn’t feel pity; he feels a rush of hope and excitement, because Malfoy is about to apologise.
She must have been like a mother to him, in some ways. She must be like a mother to all of her students.
“She was saying there’s actually a way for wishes to be granted, and I said if that were true, my first wish would be to be a Hogwarts professor.” Harry rambles, taking his first hesitant bite of the treacle tart. “What would yours be?”
That’s what the great Harry Potter has become. A nothing who trails after his friends, blindly hoping for a purpose again.
That was far too easy. He didn’t pose Harry anything resembling a challenge, and Malfoy never backs down from a challenge. Never. Especially against Harry. So Harry scowls at him, watching him for hours from the corner of his eye, waiting for him to do anything else suspicious.
“Aren’t you going to eat the rest of that?” Again, he shakes his head. “Darling, you need to eat something. Have some carrots at least. Or some pasta.”
He can’t help letting out a choked chuckle of confusion. It may make his throat burn in resistance, but he couldn’t not laugh at that. What else is he supposed to do? Accept that as fact? Accept that Harry bloody Potter just kissed his forehead, and his heart is thumping in his ears, and there’s a grin spreading across his face, and he is most definitely, certainly, absolutely fucked.
Eventually, Malfoy leaves early to go to bed. Suspicious? Possibly, but Harry doesn’t know his usual schedule at this time. The Slytherins all leave early, in fact, only a few minutes after eight. None as early as Malfoy, though. That must be something.
“Not speaking to me either? Wow, you’re really stuck up your own arse. Even on the losing side, with dear old daddy in Azkaban again.”
“Will he ever come out?” Harry mutters, mostly to himself, although of course Hermione takes that as directly to her.
“The funerals.” She says plainly, pausing to sip again before continuing. “Sorting out the wills, planning the ceremonies, editing the family line, adjusting my own will… There is a lot to do when the remainders of your family die.”
“Do you not want Draco there too?” Harry frowns, thinking back over any interaction Neville and Draco have had. He didn’t think they hated each other anymore. Sure, Neville was terrified of Draco’s bullying in the past, but Harry had thought everyone had gotten over that (ignoring Terry and Fletchley).
Malfoy’s been in their room for a while, so he’s been crashing with Ron and Zabini. He can tell his presence there is a welcome relief, since Ron has stopped moaning about how obnoxious Zabini is every morning. Unfortunately, Zabini clearly doesn’t feel the same way, as his massive wardrobe has creeped slowly into the centre of the room, making it hard to move around in there. Even without that, Harry can see why Ron hates his roommate so much. Every morning, Zabini sets off three irritatingly loud alarms, and refuses to switch them off until both of them are up and out of the door. Parkinson’s always waiting outside, with fifty tonnes of makeup and clothes in her arms, and brushes past them into the room to start their daily makeover session. It would be cute if it wasn’t so bloody early.
“No shit, Sherlock.” Theodore instantly flattens his face out, regarding the wand with an unimpressed expression. “We get it. We don’t want trouble, ok?”
Theodore picks up another cup, dipping his finger into it with a small smile and taking a sip. “Yes. We can save Draco.”
1. Should Sirius and Remus have survived? Everyone else will still be dead, but I'm thinking about making these two live as Harry's sort-of-parents. Sirius will have disappeared somewhere when he was supposed to die, I'll figure it out if you want him to live.
I myself am a proud Ravenclaw. Never really changed my mind about it like other people sometimes do. I wonder what happens if a person's personality changes during their hogwarts year - they can't move house, but then they're stuck in a house that they don't feel they belong to anymore. Yes, magic is magic, but... oh well.
“Draco!” Pansy hurries forward, from the entranceway, dress swishing about her knees. “Thank Merlin, I thought you weren’t coming. Your Jaebo keeps asking for you, I think he might run away to try and find you if you don’t talk to him.”
Instead, he pushes to his feet and runs away from Black, praying that Limbo really is endless and Black won’t ever find him again. The man calls out after him, but he keeps running, his floating body never getting tired. Eventually, Black’s voice fades away, but he keeps running and running, wishing he could run into the abyss and not have to feel anything anymore. It seems that even in death he can’t be free of the thunderstorm in his head.
Draco is on his back, staring blankly at the ceiling. The blankets have been shoved out of the way of his body, arms hanging loose over the sides of the bed, the left one… dripping…
Draco laughs, the sound escaping him like a bubble popping in his pure joy and relief. Harry cuts himself off at that, mouth twitching upwards as Draco laughs, and stretching it into a huge grin as Draco nods furiously. Would he like to date Harry Potter, the Saviour, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the stupid scarhead who he’s been obsessed with since that dumb rejected handshake eight years ago.
Slowly, he writes DECEASED next to the name and carries on, hazily registering each DECEASED, each name passing by, until-
“Don’t be stupid, Parkinson, I can hear the music. Let me in.” He glares, folding his arms. He looks like a child. An ugly little brat having a temper tantrum, actually.
“Theo, he can do that, right?” Harry turns to the anxious boy, his chest sparking in anticipation. “We can get them both out at the same time, and then we can all live in Grimmauld Place when we’re done.”
But then the party had ended, and the next day was the same as ever. Harry had become better at avoiding bad subjects, so Draco no longer refused to look at him when he opened his mouth. Yet the next day he’d acted exhausted, as though the party had taken every ounce of strength he’d recovered.
“Oh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to…” Harry Boy-Who-Lived-Twice Potter trails off, apology replaced with shock. “Malfoy?”
He shakes his head quickly, blinking back tears as he moves to tear off the last piece. He knows he isn’t good enough for the Saviour, knows all that faces him is rejection, so he might as well be brave in the face of his own destruction.
Draco frowns slightly. When had Harry been speaking to Theodore? Did… did they get together after Draco died? Is that why Harry hasn’t talked to him about the kiss yet? Oh Merlin. His stomach clenches, nausea setting in. He was such an idiot to do that! In front of everyone! They’re probably all laughing at him, being so stupid, knowing that he doesn’t have a chance with Harry because - because, well, he’s Harry bloody Potter!
Speaking of next chapter... mocks are a thing, and they are not friendly to me. From wednesday to the 20th, I will not be able to update at all. I'm really sorry for this, but I will be back after that. I might even post a christmas special (in addition to the next chapter, don't worry) to make up for it!
He shakes his head, brushing aside the first comment. “Why do all of the Slytherins call him the Dark Lord? You weren’t a Death Eater.”
“Do you like it?” Harry grins, spreading his arms and gesturing at the scene. “I was going to get a sofa or something, but I didn’t have enough time.”
The Veil stands before them, rippling and whispering, the stench of magic so strong that Blaise has to cover his nose. It’s not like other magical smells; there’s a mash of scents, of different people’s magic battling each other for domination. He can smell the Malfoy’s magic, and the Black’s magic, and Potter’s magic, and a whole host of other unrecognisable ones.
Tug. Tug. Tug. Draco shakes his head, trying to step back and pull against the force. Is this one of those gods the muggles are obsessed with? Were they right all along?
There it is. Merlin, Potter, you really love to walk in on the worst moments, don’t you? Draco’s surprised that he wasn’t there when that snake was branded onto his arm.
He rolls his eyes defeatedly, and flicks his wand in the air in brief irritated swipes. ‘I don’t want them to see me like this. They’ll get worried, and distracted, and won’t see the next hex or jinx thrown their way.’
Any ideas, questions, or random babbles are always appreciated, especially if you've seen something in earlier chapters that I haven't explained.
Two days later, and Narcissa stands outside of Grimmauld Place, Gobsy and her house elves separating her and the three Aurors they sent to escort her. As if she needs it. Most days she feels too tired to walk, let alone try to escape the country.
Strangely, Jaebo must have absorbed some of Draco’s artistry when he was created, as he constantly advises him on what colours to use or which brush stroke to make next. It’s soothing, in a way, to get lost in the colours and delicate flicks of painting. Not long after he started, a vague shape of a face can be made out, pale skin against a dark green background. He doesn’t know how to control his sudden ability, so he’s decided to at least paint someone useful.
She appears similarly confused. "I don't know. I suppose it's just Luna being Luna." Satisfied with her conclusion, she frowns at the food hanging in his hand. "Ignore her, and eat that bread. You look like you're trying to sneak it out!"
His father runs a hand over his harrowed face, the lines in his face creasing as despair sets in. “You were supposed to be safe. I’m so sorry. I thought- When I died, I thought you would be safe. I thought they’d be happy enough that I was gone that they would leave you alone! Draco, I’m so, so sorry!”
Not only that, but they are both using magic that is foreign to them. A large part of their energy is made up of Blaise and Harry’s magic, which is unfamiliar and harder to work. Countless times they’ve both cast a spell for it to blow up from the unexpected power from Harry, or for it to slip from their grasp and cast something completely unexpected because of Blaise’s impulsivity.
Ideas or questions or anything else you want to talk to me about, please do! My door is metaphorically always open. It can't be physically, however, because that would be both creepy since you'd know where I lived, and against the government restrictions.
Theodore eyes him carefully, book open in front of him on Hagrid’s table. A single rock cake sits abandoned to the side, surrounded by multiple cold cups of tea and coffee.
b) Begin a new story centred on Draco (if you prefer this, I would love some new ideas if you have them)
“I- uhm…” Harry slumps in his chair. “Remus, I… I killed Draco. I didn’t mean to. It was a spell gone wrong, and I somehow sent him to Limbo, but Blaise is descended from Vizzini and so can fix it. It’ll be fine. It’ll work out. We can fix this.”
When Pansy broke his nose, he was almost glad. She hadn’t said anything, just marched up to him in the middle of a group of gushing fifth years and punched him. They’d all descended on her, of course, but her and Blaise cast enough hexes and jinxes between them that the entire group of them ended up in the hospital wing.
“Hello Luna.” Ginny grins, now almost sitting on a furiously blushing Neville’s lap. “Why aren’t you sitting with the Ravenclaws?”
“Yes.” He had a lot of time to think when his friends were busy ignoring him and Draco was hiding in his room. It seems like only Neville will talk to him any more. “This isn’t on a whim. I know what I’m doing. I’m not as talented as the rest of them, headmistress, no one will have any reason to accept me despite my mark. Hogwarts might be the only place left for me to live a good life.”
They are approaching the seventh floor now, and Draco’s hands bunch tightly in his robes. The Room of Requirement is just around that corner, where that damn cabinet was, where the Fiendfyre licked at his heels, where Crabbe died.
Fred’s absence was like a gaping wound. George was so much quieter, and didn’t pull one single prank throughout the whole meal. A sheet was thrown over the clock at some point, thanks to Draco’s constant glances towards it. No one sat in Fred’s chair, even though there was barely any space for the large number of people. Draco couldn’t help but feel guilty, a lump in his throat that wouldn’t go away when he swallowed.
I'm kinda tired from school starting up again, so this chapter might be all over the place. It's more lighthearted than Draco's view of the world, just to give you a break from the misery, and to show you not everyone is completely ruined by the war.
Yes, Theodore has apologised, and Draco can’t hate him, not really. Yes, a part of him still loves those broad shoulders and that caring personality. Perhaps some of his heart is still yearning to be wrapped up in those arms and just forget about everything, if only for a moment. But…
“Master Malfoy, sir, you should calls the nice Madam Pomfrey. Your face be very pale!” The drawing squeaks - his drawing, the drawing he’d done for S.P.E.W., the drawing that’s now talking and moving around.
“Harry-” Narcissa’s voice cracks. She’s pale, even paler than normal, if that is possible, and her face is so gaunt and tired that Harry fears she’s going to drop dead where she sits. “Harry, you… Thank you for telling me. I would like some time alone.”
Draco stabilizes himself against the wall as a gust of cold air sweeps from the gap, clouds practically on eye level from their height. Argus is actually going to stroll straight off the building!
‘Nothing.’ He spells, and takes the wand. There’s a tense moment where he fears his doubts were true, but then a rush of magic shudders down his spine and he senses the wand welcoming him as an old friend.
Piercing green eyes suddenly meet his for a split second before he wrenches his away, glaring at the stone slabs under his feet. Potter. Interfering holier-than-thou Potter with his irritating rat’s nest of hair and constantly cracked glasses. Yes, Draco used to be a stunner, but why couldn’t Potter stop stalking him for once?!
Hermione lowers her wand. “Oh, I see. I don’t remember what happened to it. I could ask Harry about it.”
So, no, he’s not ready in the slightest, even when he’s standing with his trunk by the door, ready to apparate to King’s Cross. The clothes he wore before don’t fit his skeleton frame, and he refused to go to Diagon Alley with all the people, so his mother let him use a muggle computer to order new outfits, while she ordered his robes. He wore one of his new outfits now, black sweater over black skin-tight jeans over black trainers. Without his father around, he no longer had to wear tailored suits, so he took a rather savage delight in wearing clothes from people his father despised. The lack of attention it brought to him was a benefit too.
‘You won’t have known about it. It’s just something purebloods learn about as a kid, since they have so many house elves running around them.’ Draco drops his arm, exhausted from all the writing.
Wait...how did Luna know? She doesn’t exactly listen to what other people say, never mind hear about it before Ginny.
There’s some elements of his father to it. If you had only met Lucius once a week, or had known him as a colleague, the impression would be startlingly realistic. You might even be convinced that it really is him. But for Draco, who has grown up knowing every inch of his father, he can see that the painting is nothing more than a copy, a bland clone of the real man.
Professor Flitwick peers down at them from his stack of books, tucking his wand into a pocket. “Now, then. I trust you three won’t start spreading rumours around the school, so I’m going to ask you directly: where is Mr Malfoy?”
“That’s great!” Harry grins back, trying not to think of all the possible disastrous outcomes. He’d accepted Sirius’s death a long time ago. He doesn’t think he could manage if he had to learn to do it all over again. “How are the renovations going?”
“Hello?” A faint voice calls out near him. He startles, scrambling to his feet and staring at the newcomer. For the first time in a while, he finds he can stand easily, with no shaking or pain. However, this revelation is quickly outshadowed by the shock of the man standing before him.
“Right.” Harry sighs, resigning her to speak this over with Luna. When Hermione had confessed to him her feelings about Pansy, he hadn’t been too surprised. He’s seen the way she looks forward to every F.H.E. meeting like it’s a lifeline. Luckily, neither of them have had any delusions about Pansy feeling the same way for Hermione, so these conversations are few and far inbetween.
He’s breathless when Harry (who kissed him, he kissed him because he likes Draco too, and he isn’t alone) pulls back, adrenaline ripping through his veins and leaving him weak in the knees, clutching Harry (Harry Harry Harry) like he’s the only person there.
Scowling indignantly, Parkinson marches over to Malfoy’s side, away from Zabini mouthing 'Great job, Pans!' with a shit-eating grin on his face. Malfoy lifts his head, hazy eyes drifting over the scene, and Harry is struck with how gaunt his face is. In their brief confrontations, he hadn't had time to properly see him, and during dinner the discomfort at Malfoy even being there had distracted him.
From the group of Ravenclaws, someone has been muttering furiously, their words about it being 'disgraceful' and 'stupid to put us all together' clearly heard by the rest of them. McGonagall coughs politely.
Harry’s stomach sinks. He can’t play Quidditch anymore? Quidditch was one of the only things that made his life bearable, and now, at the time he may need it most, it’s gone. Using the pitch by himself doesn’t sound so appealing.
That voice is familiar. He isn’t used to hearing it so unsure, but it is familiar. He turns, using a small tendril of magic to poke at the girl beside him, staring at him. She should stare. He is incredible, in this moment, a powerful deity that they should bow to. Why isn’t she bowing?
This needs to stop. No matter what Remus said, Malfoy needs to know that Harry doesn’t hate him, and so does the rest of the school. Harry has to talk to him.
“It’s not like sixth year! I don’t even know what you mean.” He grumbles, absorbing himself in a chicken wing.
“Is that really you?” His father crouches down beside him, reaching out a hand to touch Draco’s cheek. He flinches back, the blinding pain of a crucio flashing through his mind. His father falters, uncertainty passing over him, and Draco can see the lines in his face deeper than they’ve ever been before.
“I would suggest that Potter pays for it, but he needs to send his money to dear Weasel Hair, who is buying wedding rings.” Blaise drawls, examining his nails.
“No offense, ‘Mione, but you’re not great at sorting out other people’s emotions. Besides, Harry’s the one who’s so bothered about him.” He grins at him. “And besides, he’s just broken up with Nott. No time like the present, am I right?”
“Decent. I’ve moved onto the kitchens, which Kreacher isn’t happy about, but microwaved meals are all the rage. I’ve learnt not to put forks and spoons in there.”
“I’m not entirely sure that’s a good thing for the Ministry to be doing, but I’m happy for you too.” Hermione chimes in, sliding next to Blaise with a clipboard in her hand. “Any of you donating?”
“I don’t think we need bother with formalities. You are all grown ups now.” McGonagall seats herself among them, placing her hat on the tabletop. “Eighth year isn’t something we’ve ever had to do before, but Hogwarts will always have a place for those who need it. Unfortunately, physical space is something rather lacking in your house dormitories, so we are using a spare wing for you to share, three or two to a room.”
“She says she doesn’t want to see you. I would tell you where she is, but she doesn’t like to be interrupted when she’s sending her letters from the owlery.”
“Whoops.” Blaise sniggers, then tuts as Hermione’s breath hitches. “I’m joking, Front Teeth, no need to get your knickers in a twist. It’ll make them hard for Weaselbee to get off.”
Four figures, cloaks abandoned, are tightly packed around something on the ground. Wait, no. Not something - someone. Two of them are laughing, spitting, yelling. The other two are mostly silent, throwing out the occasional insult, but they are pummelling the person curled up on the ground as though it’s Voldemort himself.
Parkinson must have snapped. She’s got that feral look in her eye, the one Ron had when they destroyed the locket, and Hermione’s hands are too full with schoolwork to grab her wand. What is she supposed to do? Talk Parkinson down? If not that, she could at least distract her enough until Draco is done, then he can step in and stop her. Parkinson always listens to Draco, right?
And suddenly it’s like he’s filled with power, a tsunami of new magic flooding his system and flowing to his hand, which gives one final jerk and rips both of them out of the Veil and onto hard stone. His eyes fly open, as he doesn’t need to concentrate with this influx of strength, and he sees pale skin and pale hair, lying beside dark hair and dark eyes.
They all turn to look at him, a riot of emotions across their faces. Draco feels his heart clench with anxiety, hands clamming up at a remarkable rate. Allow them in, and disappoint Pansy. Reject them, and disappoint Luna. Allow them in, and have to face his fears about Theodore. Reject them, and never be able to sort out the fear, living his life wondering what could have been.
Trelawney? No. Yes, Trelawney is a seer, and Pansy adores her flair for the dramatics, but everyone knows she has almost no skill at all. Besides, Pansy doesn’t want to know about the future, she wants to know the present.
She picks up her quill, and begins writing again. “I don’t think you are talentless. It takes a unique person to lose a war and still have faith in their decisions. Hogwarts will be honoured to have you looking after it.”
“That’s great!” Harry claps him on the back, his own stomach sinking. The Auror hadn’t asked him for his grades, just offered him a position with minimum training. He’d turned it down. He’s done with fighting, especially if he’s not going to use magic for a while.
“Wait. You said the ‘last of your money’.” Harry frowns, settling into his usual seat. Hagrid and Fang are out clearing an infestation of bark beetles, if the papers on the table are anything to go by, so the two of them have the hut to themselves.
His father had turned into a twisted, desperate man. He’d grasped at broken beliefs, molded them until they could excuse what he did, and then dragged his family along into it. He’d dragged Draco, sixteen and naive, into murder. He can’t ever forgive him for that.
Draco knocks on the frame of the bed, three times. Instantly, one of the house elves appears, wearing their new uniform. His mother had created them, with a mixture of magic and sewing, to replace the old sacks his father preferred they wore. She had told him it was to make them look neater, but Draco knew she needed to have something to work at. To keep her sane. The house elf bows his head, fingers twisting together in front of the silver sash.
“So, uhm, Ginny, what are yours and Luna’s plans again?” Harry quickly changes the subject, even though he already knows exactly what they’re going to do after this year.
As always, any ideas for future chapters or other fanfics, I'd love for you to put them in the comments section.
Ginny and Theo burst into laughter, making Neville sink into his hoodie further, face beetroot red. Harry can feel his own face heating up, but tries to laugh it off too.
This is why I envy people at Hogwarts, cause yes they did go through a war, but they only had to learn how to do cool spells and potions! I would kill to be able to say a word and make someone puke slugs.
Who is your favourite character in the wizarding world? It can be from Harry Potter, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the Cursed Child, or even my fanfiction if you really can't decide.
Except… sixth year. In Myrtle’s bathroom, he’d almost killed him, right after seeing him break down. He could’ve cast a different spell, or not cast a spell at all. In hindsight, he knows Draco’s cruciatus wouldn’t have worked. Harry could have let it hit him, and tried to talk Malfoy out of it. Perhaps then the cabinet wouldn’t have been fixed, and Dumbledore wouldn’t be dead, and none of it would have happened.
He lets out a shuddering breath, giving up on the words caught in his throat. It’s not okay. It’s never okay. Harry deserves someone so much better than him, someone who can say they love him without having a massive breakdown over it.
Cream, cream, cold cream… and strawberry. There! He grabs the faint trace of magic, Draco’s magic, and tugs.
Harry opens his mouth, then closes it, confusion and dread jumbling together. “You don’t know? Haven’t you, uh, read a newspaper?”
“Thank you.” Luna rubs away the lipstick stain, standing and holding out her hand to Ginny. “We should go to my room. All the other girls who sleep there will be studying.”
“I heard that the Hogwarts house elves are increasing in number. All the purebloods having to let them go, y’know?” Pansy interrupts the quiet one afternoon, picking at the edge of her skirt.
She turns, preparing herself with a deep breath. Mr Lupin stands at the top of the stairs, door open into the house. Her house, by right, if that Sirius Black hadn’t handed it on to Harry. She can’t be bitter about it, she should be glad the boy has a place to go.
How are you all? Good? Great. I'm fine, thanks for asking. How's Draco? Not so great. I have kept with the theme of every chapter being uneccessarily dramatic and painful, on that front you will never be disappointed. Fluff? Not in this one, unfortunately. Soon, I promise.
He takes a step there, pulling out his wand to dispel the spitting barrier. He deserves it. The despair reaches into his chest, twisting the guilt into furious flames that tell him to walk further, walk into that room and end it all.
“I said ‘that’s true’. Only you could be as fabulous as a phoenix, Pans.” He mumbles, not daring to meet her eyes.
Going back to Hogwarts would be hard for anyone after a war, but it's a little easier to manage when you're not alone.
How could he have been so blind? The silence, the malnourishment, the bruises under his eyes. Harry reads over the letter again, mind frozen in shock. He hadn’t known. It wasn’t Harry’s fault, right? If Malfoy had fallen, it wouldn’t have been Harry’s fault. It couldn’t. Harry was busy saving the entire wizarding world.
“I suppose we have opposing views, then.” Theo whispers, cheeks flushing. “I’m sorry. I won’t bother you again. Goodbye, Draco.”
“Thank Merlin.” Harry sighs, launching forward to hug him again. “I thought I was going to have to buy a new house to make everyone fit. Although, I might buy a new house anyway, considering we can’t really do… y’know… with your mum and my godfather and our old teacher in the house.”
Draco slams the bathroom door behind him, anger and humiliation still coursing hotly through his veins. Why had they even come back? With their oh-so-holy reputations, all three of them should have been accepted anywhere without having any knowledge. Unlike certain other people.
“It’s been a difficult few years for each of us.” Harry starts the speech, squeezing Draco’s hand, then drops his voice to a whisper in Draco’s ear. “Just say it with me, ok? Just like we practised.”
“Your grandfather, and his father, and his father before that would be so proud. Our family would shine brightly up there, in the stars in your hair. My little dragon, finally free to fly, not weighed down by the harsh world outside. There would be no need to make you learn to survive. No monsters up there to catch you. The moon in your hand and the stars in your hair.”
“I’m sorry, father.” Draco sniffles. “I only wanted to be like that bird. It looked so free and pretty…”
She snorts. Not like that would happen. The relationships of this year are a far cry from the desperate, clingy lust of the last. Having their lives in danger made many reckless, including Pansy. Now, she wishes she’d waited just a little longer.
The gates creak open, large and ominous, and a gusto of cold wind blows into Harry’s face. He shivers. The stench of dark magic and death is strong in the air, creeping out of the estate eagerly. He hurries inside, relieved when the gates rattle shut behind him, trapping the hissing fury of darkness inside.
“Well, neither am I, mate.” Ron snorts. “But at least I know when I’m an Auror, I won’t be prancing about in bloody heeled boots. You know how impractical those things are?”
The days pass. He manages a tiny bit more every day; a short stroll in the gardens, a whole bowl of soup, changing into new pajamas, running water and shampoo through his hair in the sink. His mother notices instantly, of course, and now sits with him while he eats, or reads to him before bed like she used to. She’s trying to make up for it all, he knows, and he wants to tell her that it wasn’t her fault, she wasn’t to blame, but every time he takes in enough air and is on the verge of saying it… his voice catches in his throat. Her forehead will wrinkle up, eyes pleading, but he can’t speak. He just can’t.
Harry thinks he would like to take Narcissa away too. Death creeps around her family, and Harry feels responsibility now. With Draco gone, he has to take care of Narcissa.
The third day came, and everything was packed up. Harry checks through his trunk again, then around their room, jumping over Draco’s and Michael’s trunks. It’s strange to him, knowing this is the last time he’s staying in a dorm room. He’ll miss it.
“S.P.E.W.” She fixes a glare at him. “Don’t you dare sigh or roll your eyes. Pansy and Draco have been telling me things, things you won’t understand, and now I know it’s going to work. Trust me.”
Broomstick polish. Wet grass. The smells Draco hated, then fell in love with, then hated, and now… is falling in love with again. He should hate it, but it’s… nice.
Malfoy started getting up. The 20 minutes Hermione stands outside is to let him get changed before she comes in. After she leaves, he’ll go straight back to bed, but it’s an improvement. Harry can’t help feeling a little miffed that Malfoy makes the effort for Hermione and not him, but on the bright side it shows he’s relatively comfortable around Harry.
Oh. That was fast. None of the portraits had told her they were already together and… in each other’s rooms. She can feel her face heating up, so she looks down to let her hair fall over it. “Uhm…”
That shouldn’t be a problem. Draco can’t speak, that’s true, but the spell can still be cast. Harry doubts that Draco would lie either; he has no reason to, after everything.
The door closes behind her, and they wait for a few seconds until there is the familiar crack of apparition.
...Straight into the Golden Trio. They look as startled as he feels at first, before all three of their faces morph into dislike. The weasel is the first to speak.
She scowls at him for a few seconds, then continues to chatter away. Draco remains silent, unresponsive apart from the odd shrug, causing her to become increasingly hysterical. Eventually, she storms out to recover in the bathroom, leaving him and Blaise in silence. A few moments pass.
The man’s eyes fly to him, a mixture of emotions whipping through them. He seems stunned, speechless, as he should be. Draco’s a monster. Draco kills and tortures and destroys lives. Maybe the werewolf is seeing that now.
“Nothing!” He winces. If Remus knew he wanted to fix Draco’s self-loathing with magic, he would probably assign Harry to a ward in Saint Mungos. “It’s a research project. Since we have so much time now, without trying to kill Voldemort.”
He would have been angry, would still be angry, if his giddiness at being alive and suddenly so free wasn’t whizzing through his mind still. Later, he knows, the full weight of his manslaughter will come down on him and leave him breathless and furious. He wishes his emotions weren’t so unpredictable.
This is it. We're nearing the end. I apologise for missing last week's update, but this week's is an extra long one thanks to its importance. I'm betting you're all holding your breath for how I'm going to end this, so I'll finish my notes quickly and get to it.
It doesn’t help. He keeps being dragged, Sirius pulled along with him, until he’s right in front of the door and the whispering becomes a scream.
Ron stares after her, bread still in his hand. "Why would I hit someone?" He questions Hermione, baffled.
“Wait! Malfoy!” Potter scowls after him, but he doesn’t see, he doesn’t see because he’s definitely not looking, he’s not looking except he is, and he’s stopped, and now he can’t pretend he’s just a stranger because those stupid green eyes are glaring at him.
“On a lighter note, welcome back to all of our older students, including the new eighth years. Since there are so few of you, I would prefer for you to stay back after the feast, so that I may fill you in on some details. Finally, I would like to present our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Heartstringer, and the new Transfiguration teacher, Professor Doily.”
Harry stares, certain he's read it wrong. But no, there it is. Potter, Harry above Malfoy, Draco. Whipping around to Ron, he stammers in aggressive bewilderment. Ron, who gives up on trying to understand him, shrugs.
Maybe he’s trying to make them pity him, so he won’t be attacked. But… there was the train incident. Ron had brushed it off, saying the ferret had finally realised he was lower than them. Hermione… had gone strangely silent, staring after him with a thoughtful frown.
She looks pained but complies, pressing her lips to the top of his head and moving away. He watches her go, heart squeezing at how thin she looks. Had she always been like this? Did she stop during the war or after it? Or did she stop eating when he left for school, or when he died? He doesn’t know.
Her face crumples again. He was that worried about the pranks that he was refusing to even see them? Isolating himself because they would get hurt? If this proved anything, it was that Draco had changed, for the better.
Draco shudders, horror rising rapidly. His father is dead. He hadn’t even visited him since he’d been taken away, and now the man who Draco had adored since he was born is dead. Eyes blurring, Draco desperately drinks in every part of his dead father, knowing with awful certainty that this will be the last time he ever sees him.
His throat may feel like a cat has clawed the insides out, but Draco has an enormous smile stretched across his face. This. This is what he wants to feel like forever. It doesn’t matter that he doesn’t know what he’s going to do next, it doesn’t matter that he doesn’t think he’ll ever feel like this again. He’s happy - if happy is an appropriate word for the unadulterated energy pumping through his body.
Harry lifts his wand again, preparing to hex someone, but then the ferret moves again. He points with his right hand, one finger on his left hand moving up each time.
Next chapter finally done! Really hope you enjoy this one - it's been completed tiny bits at a time so may have become a little jerky.
Even so, here's the new chapter. It'll be a little slow at the beginning, it's just cause I've skipped over a month of time and the situation needs to be explained. For the drarry shippers reading this, I swear they'll actually interact again soon! I just needed Theo and Draco together so that he improves a little, and now that he has, I can start working on the drarry.
Harry stalls, dropping his head and letting shame push down the frustration. “Sorry. Is it going well?”
Draco backs up quickly, mind racing. Had someone cast a hallucination curse on him? This can’t be real. Black fell through the Veil, so he’s dead, he can’t actually be walking towards Draco, he can’t be!
“I didn’t think you were.” Harry mumbles, then subconsciously glances at Nott’s left forearm, which he’s still holding onto. He lets go awkwardly, wondering if he’s hurt him. He knows Draco’s arm hurt a lot. It’s always wrapped in a thick layer of bandages, after all.
“Draco…” Harry sits on the bed, and this is it, isn’t it, this is the point where Harry says he doesn’t love him at all, and never has, and he only kissed him because he didn’t want to embarrass him, and-
“Sometimes.” She says, head tucked into Ginny’s shoulder. “It’s more for the ability to ward away wrackspurts. You should have looked at my research on them yesterday, it’s amazing how many students with mental health difficulties have a higher percentage of wrackspurts around them.”
When he wakes up, the hospital ward is quiet. His body aches with the foreign magic running through him, the smell of wet grass and broomstick polish intermingling with Blaise’s scent of fine wine and honey. He won’t be able to shake it off. It’s part of him now, as deeply cut into his body as the dark mark had been.
Perhaps he’d misunderstood it all. Malfoy is a Malfoy, after all. As Ron said, Malfoy was a dick from day one. He isn’t going to change, even if he is little more than a ghost.
His father looks around at them all, painted features shifting from the warm smile Draco had painted him in, to a bewildered sort of awe. That’s when Draco knows it isn’t his father at all. He’d tried to focus on the memories of before the war, when it was just him, his mother and his father against the world. But even then he wouldn’t have revealed his emotions so clearly.
Potter beams, crumbs falling onto Draco’s bed. Damn Potter. “Great! Well, I’ve got to go to class, so I’ll see you later.”
Harry and Hermione both snigger as he darts away to grab cake from a plate, Blaise flicking his wand to see Ron chasing after the now speeding dish.
Her sewing rests in her lap, head resting back against the armchair she’s sat in on his right. Someone’s put a cushion under her head, letting her sleep without acquiring a painful neck once she wakes. Small mercies, really. He hadn’t been quite sure what to do when she’d appeared not long after Lupin, eyes wide and disbelieving. She’d thought he was gone for good. That hurts more to him than the occasional stab of pain in his arm, or the flashbacks. All his life, he’s tried to protect her from all of that, whether it be waving a stick at imaginary monsters or working to kill his headteacher so the Dark Lord wouldn’t hurt her.
“Pans.” Blaise, lip curled at the weasel, rests a hand on her raised arm. “Don’t listen to the poor, foolish thing. His brain must have overheated.”
“No.” He leans back in his chair, draping a hand over the back of it. “It’s not hard to guess. Phoenixes are fabulous, I’m fabulous. There’s a strong link.”
This doesn't mean I can't continue writing this! I will still find time when I can, so you will get updates, they just won't be predictable or regular in any way.
“Want to practice?” He asks Draco, who nods nervously, fingers tight around his. “Ok, we can find an empty room. You have nothing to worry about, I’ll be here the entire time, and you can do it whenever you want.”
“Hey, Malfoy? How are you… Are you feeling ok?” Potter. Of course the Saviour Upon High would come sniffing. In the eyes of the Gryffindors, time spent alone by Slytherins must mean they’re plotting Armageddon, right?
Hermione winces, and rapidly backs out again as Parkinson’s shrill squeal threatens to make her ears bleed. She’ll give it a good ten minutes, perhaps twenty.
“You never think.” Theo snorts, and the somber mood lifts. “Look, there’s no use worrying about it now. What happens will happen, and we can’t change what happened in the past. Let’s just focus on this.”
There’s a slight click, then a creak, and Pansy has to peek around the corner, just to be sure. But it is. The door of Draco’s room is open, and Potter, anxiety written across his ridiculously stupid face, is stepping inside. The door clicks shut behind him.
To have Malfoy as his friend too, he needs to, unfortunately, make friends with his friends. It’s no good being together if you hate everyone your partner loves.
The tears that sting his eyes from that statement are perfectly justified. Not too long ago, he was dead and thought only his mother would do more than simply shrug at it. Now, Harry bloody Potter is hugging him and saying he would do anything for him.
He nods, slowly, and hugs Harry back when he moves in. He wishes things were different, that he could say what he means and express himself without choking on empty air. He wishes he could bring himself to believe Harry. He wishes he were better, happier, stronger, and he wishes he hadn’t been so stupid in the first place.
“Right! That’s enough!” Poppy bustles over. “You’ve given your presents and had a nice chat, but these two need rest! Only two visitors each!”
‘Wouldn’t want Blaise to see you all dirty, would we?’ Draco spells out, smirking as Pansy’s face flushes.
November trickles into December, and soon the professors start giving pointed looks to Malfoy’s empty seats. Eighth years are given leeway, yes, but a full week of missed lessons by a Death Eater - no, Ex-Death Eater - can’t be ignored. However, it isn’t until the end of a charms class on a wednesday that one of them speaks up.
It takes him an age to get to the end of it, but the pride shining from his friends’ faces is worth it. Confidence swells inside him, encouraging him to lift his voice a little louder.
For a moment, Harry wonders why Remus doesn’t just use magic. Then he remembers how horrible magically heated food is, and appreciates having house elves around to do the cooking, since Hogwarts functions without electricity.
WARNING: MORE GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION -- If you would rather not read this, ignore all text in brackets. It isn't really important, it's just Harry remembering what had happened, so you won't miss anything by not reading it.
“...so, I’m really sorry for saying all of that. I understand it upset you, and I perhaps went a little further than necessary. Forgive me.” The man drops his head, stiff and uncomfortable. Luna smiles at Draco. Draco sighs.
I know it's not essential or anything, but I'm still experimenting with what makes people want to keep reading.
He opens his eyes, squinting out at the blurry world, but the light is too bright and burns him. “Saint Potter.” he mumbles, then falls with relief into the darkness.
“Thank you.” Theodore stands, shaky with disbelief. It worked. Despite his anger messing everything up again, despite his terrible speech making, it actually worked. He allows a small triumphant smile to slip onto his face as he reaches the door.
“Hm.” Pansy raises an eyebrow noncommittally, not bothering to look over from where her and Hermione are working on… something. Harry isn’t quite sure. “As long as I get a new necklace, and a new Draco to do my hair for me. You’re useless at it.”
“Well, as long as she’s happy with Blaise, right? Plenty of other fish in the sea for me.” Hermione puts a smile on her face, clipboard out again. “She’s just so irritatingly attractive. Anyway, I’ve got donations to collect. See you!”
Imperius. Yes, it's a dark spell that you're not legally supposed to cast, but controlling people? That has to be the best spell there. Maybe it's just my moral ambiguosity, but it sounds like imperius could pretty much let you do whatever you want, all of the time.
I have a beautiful cat called Marbles, who is a very loud fluffball. Her favourite hobby is sprawling over my laptop or paper that I'm trying to read or write on. I think I'll go give her love and affection now, otherwise her meowing will drive me insane.
‘Crucio’. The force of his thoughts explode into black ink letters over his head, spitting sparks that light up the room in bright flashes, illuminating the word for all to see.
Narcissa rises as Harry follows Gobsy into one of the vast rooms. The darkness seems to have seeped into her, shallow cheeks and pale skin giving a deathly glow that Harry wishes he couldn’t see. Her eyes are rimmed red. She had been crying. Does she already know what he is going to say?
“Come on in.” He steps to one side, eying the aurors as they watch her ascend. Like she’s going to suddenly turn around and kill them all. Ridiculous.
“No! I was thinking about the looks Parkinson and Zabini keep giving him.” He sits up, scowling at Ron, who looks relieved.
“Malfoy! What the hell?!” Potter splutters, struggling to his feet. Draco doesn’t give him time to recover.
“Draco?” Luna drifts to stand next to his bed, spiralling gold earrings clinking with the movement. “Are you going to open yours?”
Harry winces, searching through his mind for a suitable explanation. He should have thought of this beforehand, but the constant worry of Parkinson’s future intentions had distracted him.
“Good point.” Remus nods at her. “I just hope that they decide to drop it and keep this on the down-low. I don’t want to have him back only to drop him straight back in there again.”
“It’s ok, love. You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. I’m just worried, that’s all, Draco. If you need to tell us anything, we’ll be here, okay? That’s what friends are for.”
He can’t die. He can’t die, he can’t die, he can’t! His breath hitches, body desperately kicking and pulling away from his death. He can see someone in there, multiple people, milky faces staring through and waiting for him to join them.
“What are you thinking about?” Hermione frowns, pulling together the books and papers with a wave of her wand.
The Unspeakables surround them, ready to record and monitor the ‘extraction’, as they called it. Blaise can’t help but feel like a lab rat, sacrificed for some greater good that he has no choice to die for.
Alarmed, he opens his eyes and sits up suddenly, a wave of dizziness crashing over him, even brighter sparks flashing in his eyes than the blinding white light. He doesn’t know where he is. The room is huge, arches crossing high above him, white and blank. As his eyes adjust, he sees he’s wearing a plain white shirt and shorts, but there’s no bandages over his dark mark. In fact, there’s not even a dark mark there.
Ginny flushes sheepishly, pressing her back against the window. Luna, on the other hand, smiles innocently as she sits up. “Hello Pansy.”
The castle is quiet, except for a few adventuring first years he comes across sneaking into Filch’s office. He almost knocks over a stack of books in the entrance to the library, thanks to his poor eyesight, but eventually makes it into the forbidden section unscathed.
Draco grabs Harry’s arm, stopping him at the last second, battling with himself. Harry tilts his head curiously, waiting for him to explain, and at his hopeful face Draco crumbles.
To die, Draco thinks. I wish I could die and leave everyone to their own business. Mother wouldn’t have to worry about him, and all of his new friends wouldn’t have to keep on pretending they liked him. The rest of the world could celebrate, dancing on his grave in vengeance for the horror he’s caused. Most of all, Draco wouldn’t have to keep on living this rotting life.
“...and I’m sorry I wasn’t there in time. I… I didn’t realise how bad things were getting. I promise it won’t happen again, Malfoy.”
“Harry, that was a rather large spell.” Hermione sighs from where she and Pansy are arranging Draco’s present. “Your magic probably just needs time to recharge, get back to normal. Pushing it won’t help.”
“Your wand? Oh, yes, it is a bit troublesome, I suppose.” With another flick, the stack shoots into a drawer where they now store all his schoolwork. “I could ask McGonagall for permission for us to visit Diagon Alley. What do you think?”
“Cool.” Blaise flashes white teeth in a grin, reclining back with the air of an emperor. “Well, I think that deserves some begging. Perhaps a little kneeling, a few gifts of diamonds, a small array of promises and blackmail material. Don’t you think, Pansy?”
“I want to show you something.” Harry stands, holding out a hand. “Although you might want to take the blankets, we’re going outside.”
After they’d accidentally transformed a curtain into a snake which rampaged the area for a day or so, Poppy refused to let them practice much without supervision. Therefore, Sirius mainly stuck to his books and chatting, and Draco focused on his painting.
His heartbeat slows, calm replacing the rushing flood. He’s fine. Breathing out a sigh, he turns to the problem of his creased robes. The cloak itself seems redeemable, thanks to the fabric, but his trousers and shirt are ruined. It’s bad enough being who he is, without looking like he slept in his uniform.
Isn’t thinking straight?! This is the most he’s thought since year fucking six, where he was branded with the dark Mark! Finally, he’s doing something good, and now this stupid man is stopping him!
c) Not do much with Draco, just finish the Gakushuu one so another long Draco one can start soon after
Draco’s magic is losing the battle, but the effort is leaving Blaise weakened. He pulls, and pulls, and inch by inch the hand hauls both of them back towards him.
Theodore sighs, nodding again. “Alright, I get it. I’m sorry. It was really nice knowing you… Good luck for whatever you’re gonna do, too.” With that, he walks out, leaving Luna and Draco alone.
He feels the tendrils of numbness every now and again. They wrap around his heart and his mind, tugging gently, welcoming him back to the haze he’d been trapped in at the Manor. It wouldn’t be such a bad thing to slip away again. He’d had his second chance, and ruined it, like he always does. All that’s left is to fade away from the earth forever.
“Great! Great! That’s amazing!” Harry breathes, buzzing with excitement, and launches forward to hug Draco tightly. His arms are strong around him, comforting in a way Draco’s never felt from anyone else, and he thinks that if he can date Harry bloody Potter, he can do anything.
Draco weaves his way over to her, taking in the theme of purple, grey, and white, as well as the shifting animals across the walls. A snake - its scales unnecessarily shiny - hisses at him from above the mantelpiece, before slithering after a badger snuggling a lion. Abbot is tracing her finger over the wings of an eagle, which fluffs its feathers proudly.
“Those people were good people because of their actions. If I am here instead of them, I need to make sure I don’t waste the opportunity. We only get one life to live, and you never know when it might be cut short. To honour everyone we’ve lost, to make up for all the pain I’ve caused, I’m going to be the best person I can be. I’m going to work hard to help people.”
“Yep!” Ron grins. “The guy from yesterday said they’ll let me in even with lower grades than normal. What with the stuff from last year, and all. Apparently helping destroy Voldemort is better than getting Exceeds Expectations in Potions.”
He never thought he’d go back. Even if he was allowed to, he would never want to. The prospect of going to Hogwarts was nonexistent, in Draco’s eyes. Yet here he is, clutching a letter that is forcing him to for a whole year. The parchment crumples easily between his long, pale fingers, the only thing that has come easy to him in months. First, there was waiting for the trial to come, in a house smeared with memories of V- Vol-... the Dark Lord. Then there was the trial itself, having to face everything he’d done in a brutal few hours, fully convinced he was going to rot in Azkaban until the Golden Boy decided to vouch for him. Draco knew he had a saving-people thing, but turning up at the trial of the boy who did all of this, and defending him? It’s still too much for Draco to handle.
Harry sighs, dropping back into his seat. Ron and Hermione offer him sympathetic looks (well, Hermione’s is more of a ‘what have you done now’), and walk out together. Parkinson groans in exasperation, flicking her hair over her shoulder and lounging back in her chair. He’s surprised she doesn’t glare at him, seeing as that has been every interaction they’ve had recently, but he supposes she’s thinking about Zabini again. Oh, great! Now Luna’s got him thinking about who likes whom.
Harry, Theo, and Blaise stare at Remus’ head in the fireplace of Hagrid’s hut, who had left quickly after Blaise had entered. Harry was slightly disappointed by this, but he supposes Hagrid hasn’t had the chance to see Blaise like he has. Living in the same dormitories has given them all a chance to see each other at their worst and best.
Well... be prepared for this one, that's all I can say. I've updated this pretty quickly, but that's only because there's important information in here that you needed to know for the Christmas Special (which is written and ready to go). Two days until Christmas! Yayy!
Disbelief makes him lift his hand and run it over the smooth skin, feeling no scars or dents where someone might have carved it out with magic. It's just… gone.
Without another word, Theo wanders past a shocked Poppy to the door, and leaves. Draco doesn’t stop him.
Right. The spell. Blaise dips deeper into the ocean of might, winding it around the bubble as he starts reciting the words. He can see it now, with his eyes open, the wave of pure liquid magic streaming from him. It’s beautiful. It feels incredible. His soul is suspended in a galaxy of sparkling magic, and he never wants to come down. He can do anything with it.
Gradually, the other three return to their conversation, and he rests his head on the table to block it all out. Pansy’s fingers run through his hair again, gentle, soothing him into the comforting illusion he’s at home, in bed, with his mother singing softly.
“You better.” She sniffs, lifting her nose. “Bring Draco back, or I’ll make sure your nose stays broken next time.”
Oh, shut up, Sev. No one cares what the name of the fucking potion is, as long as he doesn’t have to see death every night.
Something’s wrong. There’s another magic there, something familiar but not quite, wrapping around Draco’s magic and resisting Blaise’s increasingly weak attempts.
Draco curls into his father’s lap, six years old with a recently broken arm, tears streaking down his face. It’s not often this happens, but his mother is out and his father had not wanted the house elves to comfort him. His gentle hand strokes through Draco’s fluffy hair, body relaxed and giving off a soothing warmth.
“We- we’ve overc-c-come challenges no oth-other year group-ps have ever had to d-d...do.” Draco repeats, cringing as his stuttering voice amplifies to the crowd.
Thank you so much to everyone who sent those lovely comments to me! I'm really grateful to know how much you support me and I hope I can pay you back sufficiently with my writing. You have all been kind and are such nice people to have reading this.
Harry stares, feeling the tension dissolve into the air. There are tears streaming down Malfoy’s hollowed cheeks, actual tears, reddening the outline of his eyes and dripping steadily onto the floor. One thin hand comes up, covering his gasping mouth to stifle the sobs wracking his body. For a moment, the two of them simply sit there, Malfoy desperately trying to stop himself, Harry gaping back.
Harry sits in the hospital wing, clutching a broken nose, and regretting every decision he’s ever taken.
“Hey, that’s our poster for… Didn’t you draw that, Draco?” Pansy asks, eyes wide and shocked as she turns to him.
“I’ll take that as a yes.” She rolls her eyes, turns, and marches to the common room. Blaise is focused on his homework, a huge essay due for the next day, so she sprawls over it and smiles at him sweetly. “Hey, Blaaaaiiiise?”
“It was my idea.” Harry grins. “Theo told me about it, so Blaise helped Pansy cast it before we wrapped the books. I would have asked you, but that would have spoiled the surprise.”
Harry glares at the ferret's bleached halo of hair, shooting as many violent thoughts towards him as he could until he peeks up again.
The war had been hard, yes, but at least then his path was clear. Do what you were told, and if you don’t, you die. Besides, it’s all for a good Slytherin cause. He may not like it, and he may let some people slip past, but for the most part he settled himself into his role well and impressed his father. Once the war was over, he could let it all go, marry a nice pureblood, and gather his rewards for his dedicated work. That was it.
“There’s no lock on it, and muggles can’t do magic.” Harry sighs, dumping his head on Draco’s shoulder. “If they could do magic, they wouldn’t have needed to wait for their taxi in the first place, because they’d have just apparated, and then there would be no movie.”
Harry blinks at her in confusion for a few seconds. Then his face lights up and he pats himself down, eventually pulling the wand, Draco’s precious old wand, out of a pocket. “I forgot about this! I was going to give it to you when I found it, but… it must have slipped my mind at some point. Here.” Potter sticks it out towards him with a grin.
Pomfrey tends to his broken nose quickly, roughly, and then speeds away again. He wonders whether she loved Draco too, in the end. She’d healed his arm, when Buckbeak attacked him. She’d tended to his sectumsempra wounds. She’d been there to heal the bruises when Draco was attacked and Harry brought him here. She’d looked after him after the boggart incident. For him to be dead, after all that care and attention…
‘The least known spell for making a wizard or witch obey certain commands is the puppeteer curse. This involves…’
Draco winces, feeling heat flood his cheeks. That. Years ago, when he’d still thought this strange obsession with Harry was hate, he’d been passing a girl in a corridor, Crabbe and Goyle following him. The girl had held the sweater, nervously trying to hide it. He’d taken it, laughed at her like the bully he was, and learnt she was going to return it to Harry. At first, he’d kept it so he could later use it for a prank, line it with a potion to cause boils or something similar. In all the panic of that year, he’d forgotten about it.
Draco feels the sting of tears again, but this time he lets them fall as he starts chuckling wetly. He can’t help it.
“So?” Theo folds his arms, scowling. “We did what we had to do, we shouldn’t have to suffer for that. The war’s over, like McGonagall said. What’s done is done, and I refuse to spend the rest of my life regretting that.”
You can guess what this chapter will be about. It's been a long time coming, but... here we are. I've stuffed as much as I could into this, although I may have forgotten a few things which will be addressed in later chapters, so if anyone notices something that I've hinted in earlier chapters but never explained, please tell me!
A muttering starts to spread through the hall, cut off when she raises her hand abruptly. Attacks? Draco frowns slightly, wishing he’d picked up at least one newspaper during all that time in bed.
Draco snickers, imagining the many awkward breakfasts that might follow. He remembers enough avoided eye contact from when Pansy slept over at his house. That was enough for a lifetime, and the two of them had only played truth or dare and gossiped about cute boys (carefully avoiding the topic of Harry).
Their eyes watch him, still angry but now confused, as he chokes on his own words. A pathetic cough echoes from his throat. He flushes, humiliated, a hand rising to cover his mouth as he spins and storms off.
“And Sirius will be alive and the house will be fixed and there’s enough bedrooms, probably, and then-”
“I’m hoping for a new one. Imagine if he was left with… that.” Harry gestures at his forearm, grimacing. The image still haunts him whenever he closes his eyes, but the hope that Draco can come back stops him from panicking. He isn’t dead, not really.
“Young master Draco always want to be taken back here, Mister Potter, sir. He never walk here on his own, sir, not with those legs, Gobsy thinks. Young master Draco always needing help with everything. Gobsy thinks young master Draco was waiting to die, sir.” Gobsy’s eyes fill with tears, hands trembling. “Poor young master Draco. Mistress and Gobsy happy he went. The creepy crawly shadows not good for him, mister Potter, sir. Always creeping in his head.”
“You know she’s not going to leave Blaise.” Harry turns to Hermione, putting a hand on her shoulder. “It’ll just make this worse.”
Draco smiles, moving to settle down by the railings on the softest carpet he could see. ‘I love it. It’s amazing, Harry, thank you.’
“You’re the Malfoy boy, aren’t you? Narcissa’s kid.” Black walks forward slowly, looking remarkably clean and healthy for a dead man. “How did you get here?”
Hermione must know, if she’s been thinking about it. Harry glances to her, and realises she’s lowered her wand. What? Why? Her face is resigned, pitying, and her gaze is directed to Malfoy, whose hands are now clenched in his robes. Oh. She’s fallen for his trick.
“I’d have liked to stand here today with my head held high, declaring that I’ve done the best I could have.”
Shoving his wand in his pocket, he shrugs. “Not much point. It’s the first day, we should go enjoy ourselves."
‘Jaebo.’ He draws out, smoke faint and blurred from shock and exhaustion. ‘Did I make you like this? Am I’ At this point, the smoke fades out, his magic (Harry’s magic, Blaise’s magic) too turbulent to keep it up.
He knows they don’t actually mean it. They’ve become a weird mesh of interconnected friends, so none of them can truly hate each other without offending one of their own friends. He may hate the way Blaise manages to rile him up, but when Ron plays chess with him every evening, it’s impossible to stay mad for long.
Just as Pansy’s about to hex Potter into oblivion for such a stupid observation, Draco stands. All of the Gryffindors' wands snap to him. He stops, still half crouched, and curses himself. They see him as a threat. He's not the frail child that his mother sees, nor pathetic Malfoy pincushion that the Death Eaters saw. Here, surrounded by Dumbledore's Mistakes, he's an enemy.
They make their way through the common room, passing Neville’s many boxes of house plants, and through the hallways of the castle. It’s eerily quiet, without the younger years chasing each other about. Harry misses the noise. Soon, however, the chatter of voices reach them as they approach the Great Hall.
“And I’m sorry for it, I truly am. I never wanted to do what I did. I’ve made some horrible decisions, yet somehow, I’m still here.”
“No, Harry, I can see that look. I’m not getting desperate! The new recruits have reexamined it and the other ones were wrong! It’s not impossible to get back!”
“How is miss feeling?” Gobsy blinks up at her as he slips onto the seat. Poor creature. He’s an incessant worrier, perhaps verging on paranoid. She doesn’t blame him; having the Dark Lord in the same house as you does that to a creature.
Next chapter already! Slightly longer as well, which I hope you enjoy, and I am no longer blindly stumbling along! Ok, maybe some stumbling, but I have a faint idea of a plan.
As always, any suggestions or ideas, please leave in the comments section! I love hearing what you think.
...so therefore, Kingsley Shacklebolt is under the charm of a veela. It’s so clear to Luna. The wall against her back is cold, seeping through her shirt. Perhaps she should stand, walk around a little, chat to Madame Flowerbury on the wall next to the Charms classroom. Or maybe not, considering Flowerbury is so full of nargles these days.
Draco glances around him. The room seems to go on forever, stretching out into the white mist, the two of them the only dots of colour in the place.
“Draco!” Harry cups his face with his hands, looking him straight in the eye. “It’s ok, I understand. I know what you’re trying to say. I love you too. You don’t have to be able to say it.”
Looney? She did know about Blaise’s phoenix craze, which is actually very hard to guess. She knew about Draco’s silence before any of them, showing that it wasn’t just him refusing to speak. She knew about Potter’s disgusting attack on Draco. She knows exactly who Pansy is looking for every time she runs past her, and exactly where that person is.
“Harry!” Remus squeezes his eyes shut in frustration. “You’re not listening. These Unspeakables have trained differently, they know things the old ones didn’t. It’s not a Veil between the living and the dead. It’s a Veil into Limbo. Anyone who is choosing whether to pass on or remain alive goes there. Along with anyone who’s fell through the Veil. Do you see, Harry? Do you see?"
“Harry! I’ve been meaning to talk to you. The ministry workers have told me they’ve figured out the curse that sends people into Limbo, they just need to rework it to take people back. I don’t know how long it will be, but it's something, at least.” Remus’s face glows with happiness, a splodge of white paint across his cheek from earlier work on the house.
Shaking his head, Harry pushes his legs to their limit trying to keep up. He doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to the bizarreness of Hogwarts.
“Malfoy’s been staying in his room, professor. I don’t think he’s feeling that well and, uhm, you have to have seen what’s been happening. He can’t step outside without being hexed!” Harry bites his lip, praying Flitwick will let this go.
Harry nods, closing his eyes to try and process that. Vizzini, mad spells, sent to a safe place, descendant to get them back. To get Draco back. “Theodore… does this mean we can save Draco?”
Anger boils hot in his stomach, creating a twitch in his jaw. It’s almost a habit now, after seven years of it, to grow furious at any mention of his father, despite the fact that he agrees with the weasel. No! Not agrees. He would never agree with him. The confused swirl of emotions he is incredibly unprepared for make him turn rapidly, marching off swiftly before… before something bad happens.
“Draco, you should be more careful with your broomstick. I won’t always be there to carry you back to the house.”
“If the teachers and the ministry agree, we can do it!” Harry declares, seeing Neville’s face light up. “We might have to share with Theo, sorry man, but it could happen!”
He sits up, a rush of nausea threatening to push him back down, but he fights through it. No matter how much the soft, warm, comfortable bed calls to him, he has to write back to his mother today. Placing the wand gently on his bed stand, he drags himself over to his desk, pulling parchment and a quill over to him.
They leave the room. Fresh, cold air sweeps over Draco’s skin, awakening his body in shock. It’s bright, almost too bright for his eyes. Hermione doesn’t seem bothered by it all, walking ahead with Draco in tow, through the corridor and into the common room.
Oof, that's been far too long of a break. Still! New chapter, new mysteries (kinda), and new relationships blossoming! I always hated that S.P.E.W. was never mentioned in the films, so I'm bringing it in here, because why not.
It’s more of a shudder than a tingle this time. He cracks open his eyes, and registers he’s standing in the common room. It’s about the same size as the slytherin common room, yet lacks the cold, regal manner, instead opting for being cozy. There are a few chairs mimicking the stately style, however their grandness is diminished by the overstuffed sofas surrounding them.
‘Why doesn’t he just lock the door?’ Draco flicks the comment into the air, letting it drift over the projection and dissipate.
“Narcissa, please.” The woman interrupts him, sinking back into her own stiff sofa. It reminds him of Pansy’s favourite chaise lounge. He makes a mental note to ask her if she and Narcissa have discussed furniture, then remembers that Pansy hates him.
The ringing begins in his ears then. It stabs through his head, right to the centre of his brain, drilling into his thoughts until he clamps his hands over his ears to try and shut it all out. But it’s too late. The name bounces around his brain, in whispers and in shouts and in screams, in the hiss of the man himself and in the choked begging of his own voice.
With this, he could tear them apart. He could separate their atoms, one by one, and put them back together again. He’s almost tempted, until he feels the natural reversal of the spell call over something dark and twisted that winds itself around Draco’s arm, ready to complete the undoing of the spell fully.
Luckily for Draco, this means he isn’t completely stuck with only an estranged family member and a sketch of a house elf for company. While Harry does visit every day, twice a day, and sometimes during the night with his invisibility cloak, he does have his own lessons and life to be getting on with. Draco’s own schoolwork is delivered in the form of recordings through the smoke spell Pansy has been perfecting. She sets a spare wand to keep running the spell during the lesson, and Draco has finally perfected the wandless flying note charm to ask the professors for help when he needs it.
(“Isn’t it beautiful? The note says his mother made it by hand.” Luna swoops over to a tiny full-body outfit, green silk sewn in at the waist and a silver sash sliding from shoulder to hip.)
Far, far, far below lies the ground. A tree, barely a speck in his vision, is waving at him, almost encouraging him to jump down. He stumbles back, stomach twisting and knotting and boiling as a memory he had repressed surges up.
“Blaise!” She calls, and the handsome devil appears by her side, yet more buttons undone on his shirt.
(The drip, drip, drip of blood, trailing in a smooth stream down his arm, pooling on the cold stone floor and creeping towards him-)
A single apple is all he manages. It’s the only food that tastes like anything to him any more, and when the acid burns the wounds across his tongue, fresh from the previous night of biting it to suppress screams, he can’t help but feel ever so slightly less like a moving corpse.
Now, days later, Hermione wishes she’d talked to Parkinson about it at the time. The girl’s face is rapidly turning sour, a disbelieving curl to her lip. “Worry about him? Is that the best excuse you could come up with? Granger, darling, I’m more worried when I’m not seeing him. So if you’re done trying to make me go away, I suggest you let me in and take the curse off of him, before I cast a really nasty hex on you.”
Draco shakes his head slightly. He doesn’t want to hear it. If he listens, he has to think. If he thinks, then he has to feel. So he doesn’t listen, and he doesn’t think, and he doesn’t feel the waiting surge of pain.
Oh no. Please don’t say you’ve changed your mind. He turns, fingers wrapping into a fist, nails digging into the soft skin of his palms.
