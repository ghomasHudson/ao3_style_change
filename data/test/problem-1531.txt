Whatever it is, seems to be getting worse. Not only has Malfoy invaded his dreams, but he’s invaded his vision too. Harry can be looking down at his breakfast, staring down at a book, watching a quidditch match, and all the sudden he’s seeing visions of Malfoy… Alarmingly, and (mentally and physically) uncomfortably, he’s seeing Malfoy in various states of undress – clad only in quidditch trousers and gloves (jersey, cape, shin, knee and arm guards suspiciously missing – why would he be out on the quidditch pitch in such a state); in only a towel, drying off in the dormitory showers; or in his dressing gown as he returns to his room, legs bare as if he hasn’t got on his pyjamas underneath; alone in his room, eyes lidded, covered in a sheet but not much else, as far as Harry can tell - and he did… Look, that is.
Hadn’t wanted Harry to list him as an emergency contact at St. Mungo’s.
There’s Malfoy, on the back of Harry’s broom, only it’s not a nightmare in the Room of Requirement, rather, the most pleasant of days, just the two of them on the quidditch pitch. What is that
so hard for us to get here.”
Harry’s thoughts strayed to how Draco looked in Defense that morning. His hair was unruly – well, unruly for Draco, that is. Harry had a passing desire to run his fingers through it.
, Harry thinks.
What’s even worse than that, is that they don’t stop when he sees Draco – rather, they grow in volume.
It’s the only way he could explain all of this – His eyes lingering on the back of Malfoy’s neck in the Potions classroom – he’d thought about moving many times so he could no longer take advantage of the view his seat – Malfoy, graceful neck arched to peer down over the roots he was cutting, unassuming stance as he stood to bend over his potion, long, thin fingers clasped around an ostentatious quill as he scribbled a note into his potions book (not that Malfoys
Seeing a glimpse of blond hair turning a corner –
Harry continued on. “But now, being here with you, it’s the easiest thing in the world. It seems so natural, just being here with you in my garden. It’s like breathing.” He took another drag. “Just sitting here, drinking coffee, and smoking, talking… There’s nowhere I’d rather be, nothing else I’d rather be doing. I… I love you so much it hurts.”
no less, warranted some type of registration or oversight – but he’d purposefully neglected to ask Neville. Clusters of plants for potions he’d planted lovingly, with hope, for Draco. Belladona, toward the very back. A proud, tiny little Wiggentree, toward the front. A Mimbulus mimbletonia, against Harry’s better judgment, but it had been a gift from Neville, after all. It really was a nuisance but Harry couldn’t find it in himself to get rid of it.
the alcove, he pulled him
. Look, maybe it’s silly, but I don’t trust what she’s got stored up. But you, I trust you… Could you…”
He leaves Potions in a daze, and heads back to the common room. He sits for a while, lost in his thoughts, and doesn’t notice when Zabini and Parkinson come in. Parkinson is droning on in a tone that bars Harry from even considering eavesdropping, but he takes a moment to appraise Zabini’s face. He’s got a narrow one, but high cheekbones, a chiseled jawline, and a faint yet even dusting of hair about his jawline. Harry’s eyes drift downward to take in his neck, and chest, through his open robes, displaying an elegant shirt – Harry would call it a button up if it had buttons instead of a simply lacing up at the top, like a medieval tunic, or something – that wasn’t
form fitting but still gave Harry a bit of an idea of what lie underneath. He turned to follow Pansy to a corner where two armchairs sat, and Harry was provided with a glimpse of his backside.
just passed by, on the way to the opposite end of the table. Harry had asked Hermione to pass him a rasher of juice. He’d meant to say the juice and a rasher of bacon, but it hadn’t come out right. She’d looked at him and patted his shoulder, saying he should work on getting more sleep. He rather thought he would get more sleep if Malfoy would quit invading his dreams.
wrong with you! You are very much in absolute control of your faculties!”
“But even if I don’t always want to admit it,” Draco continued, “If I don’t say it… I’m glad we found our way here. I… I couldn’t imagine life without you here.” The look on Draco’s face was grudging, but beneath it, Harry could see trepidation, and hope.
That was an understatement if Harry had ever heard one.
He wasn’t absolutely sure that was legal either, but they were still behind a Fidelius, and he knew Draco well enough to know that he could be plied with such a springtime oasis.
“Didn’t know you cared.” Draco says, a slight sourness to his tone.

Harry thought he heard the tiniest of sighs from Draco, and felt as though Draco had been holding in more than his breath. Harry almost thought Draco released a part of himself with it, as though he was letting go of something he’d held back for a long time.
to Harry – Harry looked away quickly, which was just as well, as Hannah Abbot was quickly approaching.
“A Pensieve? You—publicly?” Potter stares at him, speechless.
“Still,” Shacklebolt persisted, “why don’t we meet then and see? Weasley, that should give you time to think through a few different scenarios. Robards, security, if you would. Croaker, Granger, you can adjust your research agenda. Will that suit?”
Draco lifted it and turned it over to see the Minster’s seal. “Thank you Galder. That will be all.”
Malfoy levitates a pair from a taller shelf, adding them to the row.
He’d never wanted to admit that Potter’s opinion meant more to him than a random stranger’s might. He’d never wanted to admit that less than he did with Potter’s orgasm still tacky between his fingers.
“Are you looking for the technical terms?”
“You’re serious?” Potter asked, sounding equal parts disbelieving and curious.
Draco drew his wand and aimed it directly at the seam. “
,” he groans. “Fuck, yeah.”
“Too?”
And when Harry rolls his hips up against Draco’s thigh, Draco feels him, too, and the noise is there again and he doesn’t care, wouldn’t hold it back for anything, because Harry is hard. Harry is rock fucking hard for him,
Harry shook his head dumbly.
“Right,” she agreed, looking fondly at Ron and barely suppressing a laugh. “And I don’t imagine wizards do.”
“Thank you. That was very helpful.”
“Apparently not.”
Blaise didn’t pause in his conversation with an older witch, whom Draco didn’t recognise but whose magical heritage was indicated by the choice of a gold lamé waistcoat over a ballgown that could’ve come directly out of the Black family mausoleum.
“The Ministry…” Draco sighed, at a loss for how to begin to explain the machinations he’d witnessed. Created.
Draco shrugs.
“For anything from the Malfoy estate.”
She sighed. “You’re not going to Azkaban. Your mother isn’t going to Azkaban. Even if anyone could find your father he wouldn’t be going to Azkaban. No one is trying to send any of you to Azkaban, or put you on probation, or house arrest, or levy any more fines, or make you testify in any trials. None of you are in any legal trouble.”
He look up, startled. “How do we...?”
“Across the house.”
“Don’t hoard your elf-made raspberry jam, darling. You’ve got plenty, and it’s unbecoming.”
“Shut. Up.” Potter’s shoulders tensed.
Potter shook his head without bothering to look back. “Completely sealed in with security and anti-Apparition charms.”
“To kill Voldemort!” Potter rubbed his arm. Draco would’ve bet money that it was a show.
Draco managed a half-hearted scowl for old time’s sake. “Some help you are.”
“You won’t do it, then?”
“Yes, I agree. But there is a pattern. The times he’s done something—we were talking about his medical care and how no one at the Ministry told him anything the first time. The second was when we were talking about the animals on the property, and I mentioned Hippogriffs which, well. You know.”
He has prepared for this possibility, of course. Has a plan. It will be fine. He sets down the container and starts for the front office.
“Research? For romance novels?”
It didn’t mean he had to Apparate on time. He had things to do in the office. And points to prove.
Draco huffs. “What I want is to shower with enough time left after for a proper breakfast.” He makes for the en suite. “You can see yourself out, I’m sure.”
“Ministry regulations, including officially issued forms and correspondence, serve an important role in the day-to-day functioning of Britain’s bureaucratic agencies.”
Draco dives.
“Need a good slap to the back, Weasley?”
The door scraped open. “Auror Potter?” Susan’s voice.
The change of topic left Draco off balance. He had to stop and consider. “Midnight snacks,” he admitted. “You say you don’t want to leave the void, but when there’s no one looking—”
“You really are keen, aren’t you?”
“Work?” Potter raised an eyebrow sceptically.
“We’ll be attending as dates, is that right?” Potter’s voice is so insistent that it’s barely a question.
“It’s not that simple.”
“Okay?”
She was expecting me. In all of this, that may still be among the biggest surprises. That she didn’t kick me out on sight, didn’t refuse me on principle.
“Or men.”
“Though…if I’m going to put it on you, you’ll have to take off your robes.”
He reached down to put his work boots back on. If Malfoy was working at the front desk, he’d just go in the other direction.
“You can.”
A pair of whispering ghosts floated past them, snickering into their hands.
“Harry.”
He perched tentatively on the edge of the sofa and looked surprised when Draco walked around his desk, ignored his chairs, and took up the other end, crossing one leg over the other and twisting to rest one elbow on the leather upholstery and look him straight on.
“Harry,” he said again. “Remember: if I really didn’t want to, if it was truly too overwhelming or onerous to be worthwhile, I wouldn’t do it. I’ve told you all of this in the interest of explaining why I hesitated when you first asked. Not because I want you to feel indebted, which I don’t. I’ve made the decision freely. You’re welcome, and I’m glad to hear that it’s a relief, but you don’t owe me anything.”
“I, um. I’m sure that’s more your area. Your expertise. Area of expertise. Your – your thing.”
“No, that’s quite all right. Are you warm or cold, beyond what you would expect for being outdoors for so long, or walking for so long?”
They were 21 again and sneaking out of a window at a Ministry fundraiser, the hunted look on Malfoy’s face fading away as Harry held out a hand to help him over the sill.
Harry nodded. “Yes.”
He grins at Malfoy, can’t quite help it.
* * *
His mouth is hot against Harry’s neck, the suction bruising, and this mark is one Harry wants to keep – no Glamours, no concealment of any sort. He tilts his head, giving Draco better access, but Draco has moved on to his jaw and then his lips, nipping at them, pressing into them, kissing him so thoroughly that Harry is left gasping and boneless against the quilt.
His nod is clearly unconvinced.
He bends forward, and lets himself fall.
“Yeah.” Potter squeezed Draco’s arm. ”And fuck me.”
He can take it almost to the base and it’s perfect. His mouth’s full and it’s hot and salty, his hands are gripping Potter’s arse, pulling him closer, and then, then it happens, on an exhale.
When he tapped them with his wand, the text rearranged itself to read
"The way this works is, we got to the contacts on our phone, scroll through at random, and whoever it lands on we call and play a little prank or, if you don't want to call them, just delete them, right out of your life."
“Okay.”
“You’re such a holier-than-thou hypocrite.”
“I’m sorry.”
He yelps when I pull him towards the end of the bed and looks over his shoulder, indignant.
He turns to look at me. Halfway there already, then. He winces when he moves his hips and lies back very delicately, flinching when he rests back on his arse.
“The Ministry helps witches and wizards recover objects. Transportation is the sole responsibility of the witch or wizard whose items have been retrieved.”
“Over.”
“Ice skating? In Diagon Alley? In front of people? Do you know what they’ll say, you crazy fool? You and I, ice skating together in the middle of everything? Imagine the headlines and tell me you want to do that.”
“Perhaps,” Draco mused, “but the stakes are so much higher. You know, I think Shacklebolt genuinely wants to help? But it’s impossible with Robards and Croaker yapping at his heels.”
Ron swallowed, stuck his chopsticks in the carton, and pushed it across the desk, away from him. Not a good sign.
“Do you want –” he pauses. Me? This? He hasn’t got an end to that sentence.
I don’t think I’ve had one I’ve enjoyed more, one that’s leveled me so entirely. His face, eyes closed in concentration, and the ravenous noises he made, the way his fingers dug into my hipbones as though holding on for dear life.
Harry looks up at him, unsure of the correct response.
“No, not at all. It’s your space. I shouldn’t have interrupted.”
Potter was left silent, seeming to take him in for a moment. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”
A telltale crack preceded the swing of the door. A leathery foot came into view, and the back of a wrinkled head.
“I want to understand,” Harry repeated.
Everything I can think of is too dark to belong here. And I don’t want that. Not distraction. Not darkness.
“Fuck off.” Potter turned for the house.
Harry set his pint on the bar and let himself be pulled towards the dance floor. He was awkward at first, moving too tentatively to look at ease.
He lays that bunch down next to the others and pulls out his labels.
The room expanded endlessly before him, millions of flickering lights seeming to stretch into infinity. For a gut-wrenching moment it reminded him of the Hall of Prophecy, with its glowing orbs stretching towards vaulted ceilings and down never-ending aisles until their luminescence faded into the distant darkness.
. That was it.
“I can choose, if you’d prefer. However, I know you’ve made your decision and, as you’re aware, it may become difficult for you to spend time in magical spaces afterwards. This should help, but still, if there are any particular things you’d like to see or do, I would be pleased to offer that opportunity.”
“Yes.”
“Bullshit, Draco. Finch-Fletchley’s a great cocksucker.”
Harry’s breath hitches. He leans in to Draco, circling an arm around him, resting the side of his head against the side of Draco’s. He breathes deeply and holds them there until Draco becomes aware of the balls of his feet, of the ache in his heels left over from dancing.
“That’s how you make a boatload of Galleons while reclaiming the family name.”
“Do I?” Draco arched a brow and raised his glass to cheers.
“Sort of. Healer Barrett asked me to make a list, just put everything on it I could think of that sounded at all appealing.”
Draco didn’t waste time or breath. He handed Potter his wand. “Start with Lumos.”
“Worth trying.”
“Fixing what?” Draco sat up in his seat.
Draco gestures for him to move along.
“Do you know why they assigned me to the Vanishing Department? Why they chose, as punishment, to make me the sole member of a new department?”
“That makes no sense.”
“Is that your answer as a survivor of the Dark Lord, or as a scholar?”
“What?”
The bird fell just as Harry took a step back. His intention had been to escape the increasingly assertive grasp of one Spencer McSullivan, who had spent the better part of dinner and the walk afterwards assailing Harry with supposedly fun facts about the regulation of growth enhancement charms for root vegetables. Harry was so bored that he thought at first the sound might have been his own head hitting the ground as he passed out from a sheer lack of will to go on.
Harry was outside of the clinic at 7:59. The sun was still climbing over the horizon, and the boardwalk had taken on an orange cast in the early morning light.
There was no way Potter would understand any of that. Or wouldn’t willfully misunderstand it, even if he did.
Before Harry could speak, Draco rushed on, feeling suddenly compelled to make clear every warring emotion he’d spent the last day sitting with. “Before you say anything, I want you to know that whatever you’ve decided, I’ll respect it entirely. It’s a difficult position to be in, I know, to discover things about yourself you might not have realised. Doing it properly, whatever that means to you, is important. Non-negotiably so. And I realise, too, that the situation is further complicated by our working relationship, not to mention our history, and that it may be too much to overcome, particularly when I’m leaving so soon and you have this personal journey ahead of you for which you might, quite reasonably, want a partner. And so, all that to say, if the answer is no, whatever your reasons, you’ll hear no objection from me. You’ll have nothing but my support.”
“Right, great. The magical spoonbill that’s bleeding all over my dining room table?”
He called Luna. She came through so quickly he fell backwards trying to scramble aside. She perched next to him on the edge of the hearth as though he had meant it all along.
“Gonna come,” Harry murmured into his mouth. “Want to come with you.”
The riot of sensations that followed escapes even my best attempts at recollection. I remember the rough drag of glass against the floor, his nipples just out of tongue’s reach as he stretched for another jar, and another. I remember the strength of his hand around my wrists and bucking under him, my sides spasming and back arching as he dragged the fine bristles of his brush over my ribcage. I still bear the marks he left: twin stripes of black down my sides; red streaks on my shoulders matched by raised pink welts where his fingernails bit through my skin; half a cobalt handprint on the inside of my thigh and a full one where he’d grabbed my arse.
Draco lifted the bottle and began to pour. “It wasn’t bad, actually.” He held out the glass. “I think you have as much time as you need.”
“Only almost? Not entirely unbelievable?”
Malfoy turned his head towards Harry and opened his eyes, then seemed to startle.
“Fuck, yes. Fuck me.”
“No, no,” Draco laughed. “I had the dungeons filled in years ago. Thought I might offer you a drink.”
He felt Potter push himself to standing, could tell when Potter locked his knees. The rigidity seemed to erase anything else that might have been.
Nothing about Potter is delicate, but Draco can wrap his fingers all the way around Potter’s wrist. The skin is bare at the gap between his sleeve and his gloves, and it’s warm and soft in a way Draco never knew Harry was before this thing between them.
me? Just tells me to shut up and piss off or acts like I’m not even there, when I— when I—” He let out a frustrated growl and tugged at his hair. “When everyone’s tiptoeing around it like there’s some big fucking secret and no one will even tell me
He could just show up to one of these things and run into Potter. F and L can tell him what Potter’s RSVP’d to, and then they’d be on more equal footing, and that’s not a bad idea.
Draco nodded.
The scepticism that flashes over Harry’s features hurts but then, Draco thinks—he hopes—the words sink in.
“No,” Harry managed.
Draco slips off his stool and straightens his robes. “Not any more than you could the last time, but once an exception’s been made, well. Might as well.”
“I don’t.”
He leaned forward to study them. The twins were exactly as Harry had seen them, as Turner had found them, laid out in the street almost parallel to one another, except that their bodies were so twisted they no longer looked anything like straight lines. The mother—the Mediwitch—and her daughter, the Knockturn shopkeeper, were slumped on opposite sides of Diagon Alley, the mother with vacant eyes open and staring upwards, head tilted back against a store front and her blonde hair stuck to the glass with her own dried blood. And on her forearm,
Which was, well. Draco wouldn’t use the word disappointing. It wasn’t disappointing. Mystifying. Confusing. Perplexing. Illogical. Idiotic, perhaps, might be most appropriate.
“It’s true, isn’t it?”
“I am.”
“Unfortunately, they won’t be able to join you.”
“Pardon?”
Of course, he hadn’t come anywhere close to saying all of that. His half-sentences felt woefully inadequate.
“You want me to accept a half-arsed apology for serious insinuations, and perhaps a touch of stalking, which you’ve chosen to deliver by breaking and entering?”
“I should think that would be obvious. It’s clear he must care for you a great deal. Now, take this.” Harry hears her bustling about near Draco’s bed. He feels the bed shift a bit under his arms.
Plants, flowers, and trees, both magical and muggle, were spaced in rows (though not the neatest) and where there were no rows, there were random clusters, surrounded by mulch in some places, grass in others. Tufts of monkey grass grew merrily throughout, looking somehow, against all odds, intentional. There was even a tiny forest that he wasn’t sure was
Nevermind that Hermione swears Malfoy’s up to absolutely nothing. Just trying to get his NEWTs, like the rest of them… And something about a future Potions mastery…
Madam Pomfrey shoos him out of her hospital wing, after his third request for a diagnostic has no negative results.
“Yes, well, if you’d ask a bit more nicely and stop shouting, I’d be glad to make it for you if you’re so insistent. It’s not that difficult a potion, and all of the ingredients will be in the student stores.”
Draco sniffs haughtily. “Yes.”
Harry is affronted. “What kind of question is

His eyes slid over glowing toadstools, bioluminescent in all their glory; the green, red, and yellow muggle fern Harry and Neville had brought from New Zealand; the tiniest of babbling brooks – if he squinted he thought he could see the tadpoles – the curious willow with purple leaves that positively glowed on the full moon; an unassuming cluster of clover Harry hadn’t had the heart to pull up, damp with dew; the calla lilies, gleaming white and ethereal…
“Hermione… I need a favor.” He says in a rush, peering around the stacks to make sure he isn’t overheard.

to explain that they wanted the both of them.
Draco loved him, but there was something… Something that Draco seemed to be holding back. He hadn’t agreed to move in with him, when Harry had asked. Had a thousand reasons why he shouldn’t, why they shouldn’t.
He knows that he’s not really under the influence of anything. Hermione and Madam Pomfrey alike have guaranteed it. He’s not sure that he’s ready to accept that these feelings are entirely his own – He can’t imagine feeling this way about someone he despised so much, and for so long.
“Harry, don’t be absurd! If you’d been slipped a love potion, you’d know. You’d be right uncontrollable by now, Merlin knows what you’d be-”
But as his thoughts wander, he realizes he’s not really the person he was when he felt that way, and that Draco isn’t the person he despised so much, anymore. Throughout this strange eighth year, he’s seen a completely different side of Draco. He’s seen Draco remorseful, contrite, unassuming, repentant, humbled, and joyful. He thinks he likes the joy the best. That’s when he knows.
Harry is staring into space after the goal is scored, but is startled, his eyes sliding into focus. He watches the incident in slow motion – Zacharias Smith has grabbed the beater’s bat, and, perhaps in a show of anger, bat the bludger at Draco, who is already hurtling away.
He’s taken to discussing his plight with Luna, knowing Ron and Hermione are simply
Harry swears he’s been potioned.
Every errant thought seems to lead back to Draco, and it seems sillier and sillier to Harry as time goes on.
I–” Harry stops himself. Draco’s eyebrows raise.
“Since we, reconnected–” had it
It’s the only logical explanation, really.
Harry gave it a moment before he spoke. “I want to build my whole life around you.”
Well. That’s settled. Hermione probably already knew, even.
He makes up his mind to go to Hermione. He finds her after lunch in the library.
Belatedly, he realizes he’s never even tried that spell, and that he didn’t even use his wand.
“What gave me away?” Harry whispers. Draco just stares pensively.
Classmates still sniggering at his answer, Harry sighs. He doesn’t notice that Malfoy isn’t laughing and is actually quite subdued.
“Anything, Harry!” She responds automatically, though narrows her eyes as though she’s regretting such an open offer.
Concerned at that line of thought – Merlin, it was
Harry isn’t really sure he even understands why he’s dreaming of Malfoy. It doesn’t make sense that he sees him in his dreams, in all of these situations, some compromising, even. It’s not as if he’s interested in Malfoy in that way. He isn’t even sure he’s interested in blokes like that… Though… Now that he thinks back, he wonders if that might’ve explained his… ogling… of Oliver, in prior years.
All right, Zabini was definitely attractive. Harry could admit that. He wasn’t sure he’d ever fully considered it before, but he wouldn’t say no to seeing what was underneath.
Yeah, maybe it’s a spell.
“Why are you here?” Draco asks without preamble.
The backyard garden of Number 12, Grimmauld Place has been revived, and in many ways, reborn.
Harry sighs and rubs his forehead. “Hermione, would you help me make a purging potion?”
It was exotic, and chaotic, but at the same time, Harry found it positively calming. He and Neville had put no small amount of work into it, so he hoped Draco found it calming as well. Harry rather thought he did, because it seemed as though whenever he was looking for Draco, the garden was where he could be found. Harry congratulated himself once more on the temporal charm he’d had such trouble casting, that granted his backyard garden eternal spring.
He wanders the halls and his thoughts stray back to Draco. He thinks of going back to the library - he thinks there might be an alcove he could just pop into, close to where Draco’s sitting. Shocked at his own thoughts, he trudges very determinedly back to the common room.
Definitely a potion. He was sure he wouldn’t notice things like that if he weren’t under the influence of some potion.
He’d only halfway been paying attention, because he’d been staring at Malfoy again.
shouldn’t be, sat in front of each other, hand on Harry’s arm, on the shore of the Black Lake.
Draco is flying quite well, playing chaser this time, avoiding bludgers, and has scored two goals. Draco’s team, the Thestrals, made up of five eighth years and two seventh years, is up by thirty points so far. The trailing Hippogriffs, with only three eighth years and four seventh years, haven’t been doing as well, but they are still in the game.
Harry takes this time to conjure a goblet and charm it full of water. He holds it up to Draco’s lips. Draco is a little surprised, and something else Harry can’t identify, but he drinks deeply.
And so, Harry figured this was as right a time as any. He pulled a small box from his pocket. He fumbled with it in his lap, finally getting it open, slipping something from it, and reaching for Draco’s hand.
Harry can’t sleep. Can’t sleep for thoughts of Draco, and he wonders what his life has become. He snorts at himself for being so melodramatic.
Draco’s face softened before he spoke. “Care to elaborate?”
He looked across the library to where he knew Draco was sitting, and debated asking him. Ultimately he decided against it. He sighed, rolling up his scroll of parchment and packing away his things, feeling like he needed air.
“Well I’ve been slipped – something!” He cries in frustration. “Isn’t there a potion or spell or something, that could clear my system?”
He doesn’t always remember them, but when he does, he cringes. Because Draco Malfoy is there, when he definitely

He leaves his thoughts behind and returns to the present, where, in response to Slughorn’s question about whether Harry could give him one of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, he’s just said it could be used as a “cure for oven.”
But is he really being melodramatic if he finds he can’t even
“Go on,” Draco smirks. It’s a look so reminiscent of Draco’s younger self that Harry realizes he hasn’t seen in quite some time, though Harry’s response to it doesn’t really feel anything like it did when

Turning left out of the library, he thinks Draco might have followed him out. He knows he saw a green scarf trailing behind him. He turns but it’s only a Slytherin from a lower year, with dark hair and decidedly
He strains his ears for more, hearing nothing. He’s wishing he could open his eyes, but he’s turned toward Draco and presumably, Madam Pomfrey, and he doesn’t want to give himself away if she’s not thought to wake him. A few moments pass and he thinks he might be able to drift off again.
As the game begins, he sits up and starts to take notice of his surroundings. The teams are playing well, and he finds he wishes it was his turn to play this month.
His eyes fell on Michael Corner. There was a bit of an odd history there he supposed – seeing as they’d had the same girlfriend, once. He could acknowledge that Corner was attractive, but as his eyes roved over Corner’s face, and form, nothing stood out to him. He guessed Corner didn’t really do anything for him.

Four nights into his vigil, Harry wakes slowly and quietly to the hushed tones of Madam Pomfrey, but she isn’t talking to him – he appears to have found himself in the middle of the conversation. His back is killing him but his arms and head are on something soft.
“I suppose I might care about you too.” Draco admits grudgingly.
It’s not a potion – Hermione’s immaculate Purging Potion seems to have no effect on his… Feelings, and she’s cross with him for questioning if there was anything wrong with it – but he knew there wasn’t, really. Just didn’t want to admit it to himself, but – he stops that thought in its tracks.
All Harry knows is waiting. He floats through the week in a daze of classes, the occasional meal, and vigils in the hospital wing. He doesn’t notice the strange looks from Zabini, nor the knowing ones from Parkinson and Hermione, nor the incredulous ones from Ron.
He makes his way across the castle and heads out the doors, shutting his eyes and breathing deeply. When he opens them again, he notices a cluster of fifth year girls. A few are giggling. He turns on his heel and heads back inside.

And this is how Harry winds up in Hermione’s shared room with Millicent Bulstrode, windows open wide as they’ll go, avoiding the Potions lab in deference to Harry’s paranoia.

– anything could have happened. What if you hadn’t woken up? I was waiting for you to wake up.” Harry thought that was a pretty good answer. Draco went silent for a few moments, seeming to absorb Harry’s explanation.

Draco is completely unharmed – well, unharmed aside from the bludger to the head. Harry can’t stop the loop of the image of Draco falling limply from such a height behind his eyes.
of hearing about it. Luna says they’re called fantasies. Harry chokes on air.
“Pomfrey says you stopped me from falling and transported me here. Why?” Draco asks.
Hadn’t wanted to get added to Harry’s Gringotts accounts.
only been two years, he thought, taking another gulp of coffee– “You’ve brought me nothing but joy. Sure, we fight sometimes, but my heart isn’t really in it – is yours? And even though you give me a headache sometimes – Hey, I know I’ve driven you to a headache potion once or twice too – I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Because when I look at you, when I hear your name, when I think of you, all I feel is the most intense… Joy. And that’s how I know. That it’s you.”
and, fearing he’d be caught ogling, Harry cast his eyes about the room. They landed on Neville.
seems like it’s only when Malfoy is around. But that couldn’t be right.
In the common room, he takes a seat on the small loveseat, trying not to think about what he might do if instead of observing Draco

Slowly, so slowly – hands shaking, damn them – he slipped the ring onto Draco’s third finger. Rather presumptuous, he thought, but he was hedging his bets.
“How long…” Draco’s voice is hoarse. Harry wonders if she has gotten him any water. Draco clears his throat. “How long has he been here?”
He looked over to his coffee cup and found it was empty. A carafe floated nearby, courtesy of Kreacher. He reached out and poured himself another cup. Draco was still watching Harry, eyes pinched, so Harry spoke.
He thinks back to the time he’d been speaking to Hermione in the common room, and accidentally caught Draco’s eye as he approached, angling for the door, only for Harry to blurt out in response, “That’s terristic!” That earned him a few laughs, to his embarrassment. He groaned aloud at the memory.
It was late, or early, depending on one’s outlook. Harry thought it might have been around three. He smiled down at the watch on his wrist that Draco had given him for his 31

Harry keeps getting tongue tied. But the thing is – it

“This is about Draco again?” She looks like she’s trying quite hard not to roll her eyes.
Harry doesn’t think anymore, can’t think anymore, just reaches his hand out to Draco, reaching with everything he has. And then, it’s as if an invisible net is slowly lowering Draco to the ground.
And Charlie, once.
Harry’s not sure where he went wrong, but as he approaches the pitch, he sees Draco hurtling around as he warms up, looking more attractive than he has a right to, a look of pure joy on his face. Harry almost turns around, but ultimately decides to take a seat in the stands. He lays down on the bench for a moment, staring up at the clouds.
Harry gasps and calls out. Draco’s eyes lock on his, and he sees the moment Draco hears the telltale whistling of the quickly approaching bludger, and it’s all just too fast. The bludger has collided with Draco’s head, and Draco is falling, and he’s so high
met, I guess, everything started to feel – right. Life used to seem so hard – thinking back to all the places I’ve gone, and the people I’ve met – I drifted around just… Looking for something, something I didn’t even really know I was looking for. I tried not to let loneliness get to me, but I’m only human. There were days upon days, months, maybe even years, where I was just… Particularly sad.” He took a breath, and decided to light another cigarette. Draco’s eyes hadn’t strayed from his.
Harry keeps having the strangest dreams.
Against his better judgment – Neville was his mate, after all – Harry took in Neville’s seated form from top to bottom – first, he noticed the crease in his brow, but then his eyes traveled downward to Neville’s deep, brown eyes, focused in concentration on a book. His eyes travelled lower to Neville’s lips – they were full, and as Harry watched, Neville drew his bottom lip in with his teeth as his brow creased further. Harry suddenly felt hot. His eyes travelled down to Neville’s chest –
Harry sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. "Why are you so persuasive?"
He was pretty sure he had found what he was looking for; this potion was green like the curse it was named after, it contained emeralds that he was sure was the jewel used in the paste and it caused a painful death but Draco didn't get his hopes too high up, better not to than get them crushed.
I watch, after casting a disillusionment charm on myself, as Potter sits beside the sofa Draco is laying on. He is staring at my unconscious best friend and I can't see him doing anything to harm Draco.
"No." Harry replied. He wasn't in the mood and he didn't want to lose control and shout at Malfoy, which would probably end up in a vicious duel.
"I'll send him here." She shouts and she's about to turn away when I grab her arm.
Draco became even redder than before.

"I asked him what he would do to get his magic back. He said anything."
"You look a little...put out, Harry." Ginny said.
Draco knew he could decline. He wasn't compelled to go there, was he? No he wasn't. He wanted to decline, he
He searched the list of potion ingredients carefully; sandalwood, salamander, occamies, skrewts, lead, marble, jewels.
He then grabbed his other hand and entwined their fingers together. Harry could feel his own cheeks warm but thankfully his tan skin didn't let it show much.
"I don't know." Harry whispered back.
Malfoy's expression softened, "Have you talked about this to
When he opened them again, he wasn't alone in the desert. Ron, Hermione, all the Weasleys, his parents, Sirius, Remus, all of his friends and even Dumbledore were surrounding him in a huge circle.
"Will I have to make a Sacred Oath or something before you tell me the details?" Malfoy asked, his brows scrunched and his face set in a grim line. His eyes clearly showed how much he despised the idea.
Harry sat up slowly, his throat dry. "Everything wasn't alright. The man was there. He had apparated. I'm pretty sure he was the wizard but before I could catch him, he disapparated. I don't know why I passed out. Probably just tiredness. I haven't slept since last night."
"Potter, try to slow your breathing, okay?" He said but it seemed as if Potter couldn't hear him. Draco placed his hand on Potter's shoulder and instantly pulled it back; Potter was practically burning. Now Draco started to panic. This didn't look right at all.
"I'm about to kiss you, you imbecile Slytherin. If you want me to that is." Harry's words made a shiver run down Draco's spine. Draco didn't know how to respond to the question Harry had just presented him with so he said the only thing that came to mind.
With a sigh, Harry rubbed his throbbing temples and answered Ron, "I'm not doing this case with my team, Ron."
"I do think you can do this. Think of something that has made you the happiest you've ever been. Something you've always wanted. How did you feel when you got it? Focus on that feeling. Let it fill you up. Clear your mind of anything except the emotions you felt at the time. You can do this, Draco. I believe in you."
"Indeed, but that doesn't mean you don't miss him." Draco said in a calm and collected voice.
"Oh! I am so sorry Mrs. Malfoy. Do come in and it isn't Mr. Potter, just call me Harry" Harry steps aside to let her in.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Was it 1000 galleons?" Draco asked as they exited the restaurant. The sun was shining brightly; it was almost noon.
"Harry Potter. Never thought I'd see the day when you
"Uh- your friend?"
"But it's not lunchtime yet." Draco said. He knew that the Aurors were only allowed to leave the Ministry for lunch or investigations.
"I-" Draco started to say but he had no idea what. He had absolutely no idea what this case was about and what he was getting in.
Potter gives a frustrated sigh. "Do you know how to feel your magic?"
It was only when he felt Harry froze and his laughter cease that Draco realize what he was doing. Not meeting Harry's eyes, Draco took a step back, an apology on his lips but before he could say anything or move further back, he felt Harry's arms wrap around his waist and Harry gave Draco such a strong pull with his hands that Draco had to put his hands on Harry's chest to steady himself.
"I-I was w-wondering if..." Harry waited for Draco to continue but he didn't say anything.
"His guilty pleasure more like." Blaise muttered just as Pansy said, "He could've used a calming charm though."
But as he entered the room, he wished he hadn't.
Harry frowned as he read the case file Kingsley had given him. It stated that the villagers had a strange man amidst them. It was the quaint town of Purely.
"Mate, no offense, but everything you do is awkward." Ron snorted.

"I'll be a minute." I announce to the room and run out behind Potter, leaving a confused Draco and Blaise behind.
Harry blew an annoyed breath through puffed cheeks and muttered, "It was a few months back. I was on a case. Me and my team were following a murderer. I had almost caught him, in a dark alley but before I could do anything, my vision blurred. It was the worst that time, the most agonizing."
"Alright, sorry. Harry, I agree with Hermione. You defeated the Dark Lord, you are the Boy who Lived, you can ask a Slytherin git out, for sure."
Harry gazed in horror at his hands, watching as they turned to sand slowly. He tried to stop it from happening. Willing whatever this was to
On his doorstep, completely clad in black and looking widely awake stands Narcissa Malfoy.
"H-harry." I whisper and I see Potter's eyes fill with such joy that my own heart squeezes in my chest.
"It's not nothing, Harry. I get if you don't want to tell me but talk to
I nodded and prayed to whatever Gods above to give me strength.
The receptionist nodded and opened a battered-looking register. "He's on his break at the moment. You may find him in the room that is just on the right, the basement."
"Harry, look I understand that you have a case but you should get some sleep, okay? I'll firecall John and tell him that you can't come today."
, Harry. I know you've never solved a case without your team but I would never have given this to you if I did not believe you to be capable enough for it. It is hard, of course, this case is very challenging but I believe in your abilities."
"Now hold your wand on your heart and relax." Draco does.
Suddenly a loud shriek interrupts the music. I look behind me and see Pansy grinning like a cheshire cat, Blaise right behind her.
"What? Mother NO! I will not go to Potter of all people for help. I am mortified as it is!" Draco shouts his face red as a tomato.
"Did I look that desperate?" Potter asked.
Potter's eyes are blazing, with anger, so much anger. Draco has seen this expression only in one pair of eyes, a very red, very inhuman pair of eyes but Potter isn't like the Dark Lord. He isn't evil at all. The expression on Potter's face, however, reminds Draco so much of *his* eyes that Draco can't help the tears that rise in his eyes or the tremble of his body as he thinks of how the Dark Lord looked, or his Father looked at him before they casted Crucio on him. Potter had the same expression in his eyes. Draco backed away in fear.
"Yeah you. Posh, modern, expensive. By the way if the bill is more than 1000 galleons, I'm not paying. I would've been fine with pizza take-away." Harry muttered and picked up his menu too.
Or maybe he was just too foolish and arrogant to accept the fact that someone could outsmart or overpower him.
"I told her that too but she said she would convince him."
Harry rolled his eyes with a sigh; he was so damn tired. "I am not lying, Ron. Anyways, we've made a truce to work together in peace." Harry waved his hand dismissively.
"I am so sorry, Draco. I would never harm you. You are a great person now. You haven't done anything wrong." Harry said softly. Malfoy's shaking lessened but his tears and sobs didn't stop.
"Fine. Let's go feed you or else we'd all be doomed." Draco sighed dejectedly and got up. "Where are we going, anyway?" He asked.
Days passed and Draco continued his lessons with Potter- no Harry. After the night of Draco's panic attack, Potter kept calling him Draco so in return Draco called him Harry. However, none of them mentioned that night again anymore. Harry had woken Draco up and in a perfect gentlemanly manner, without mocking Draco at all, he had apparated Draco and himself to Malfoy Manor. Mother had freaked out, of course, adding to Draco's embarrassment but Harry was fine about it. He had replied politely to Mother and Draco's thanks then disapparated.
It worked for a few minutes but then Potter's breathing grew ragged again and he started to shiver.
"Uhh- I don't want to get hexed, sorry."
Draco frowns. He doesn't know what Potter means by that. He looks at Mother for help but finds her frowning at Potter too.
The feather is floating only 2 inches above the ground but it is floating nonetheless. Draco laughs happily and looks up at Potter, expecting to see a similar expression of mingled pride and happiness as before but all he sees is disbelief and is- is that disgust?. Draco's smile vanishes as he sees Potter's expression. Without looking at Draco, Potter turns around and rushes out of the room with no words other than,"Come at the same time next Saturday."
Harry was halfway through the door when Kingsley spoke again, "I know you won’t. And do remember my advice. Choose the wizard who is most suited for the
"Mate, you are late for-
Then, suddenly he felt a such a tortuous agony all over, it was like he had been Crucioed; his arms and legs were bent at a strange angle, his body twitching in pain as he released unintentional moans of pain. It was the worst Crucio, if it was that at all, he had ever felt. His whole body hurt so much, it was like someone was trying to tear him apart limb by limb.
"Dray, I'm so-" But before Harry could finish apologising, Draco threw his cup of tea on the floor and marched out of the room.
Draco closed the book with another sigh. He had searched almost every book he owned but apparently, jewels weren't a very common ingredient for potions.
"Oh, do we have to…bring someone?" Malfoy asked.
"Do you want to borrow this? We can research at the Ministry. Kingsley might get angry if we aren't there soon." Potter spoke thoughtfully.
"I-I've n-never don-done this before." He admitted because it seemed like the only thing to say.
rotten
Malfoy,
He looked at his menu; Ricotta steak, Meat casserole, coq au vin, lamb chops, risotto, sushi, all kinds of food were available.
"So today I want you to try and use your magic more, have you been practicing at home?" Potter stares at him with his big green eyes.
"I...it only happened once." Harry muttered lightly tracing a pattern on the table with his fingers.
"What? But you said it was very important. Robards would never give you a case to solve all alone. No one has ever solved a case alone." Ron exclaimed, still a little shocked.
"It...it was before you came that day but...he was here again. I tried to stop him, thinking he was mad but...he...I don't know what he did but I didn't call the healers or aurors. Even when my heart was shouting at me to. He grabbed a book...I..I tried to see which and it was an ordinary one. He then started to say something, a spell of some sort.
for the betterment of the Wizarding World, that there were people who did even noble acts that Draco couldn't even come close to but he didn't voice his thoughts.
"Well she was a Slytherin, wasn't she?"
I'll try to post again as soon as I can!
"Oh I remember last time well, Kingsley. Very well indeed. It was
"I-I, be ca-careful." And the man fell to the floor, unconscious or dead, Harry had no idea. He searched for a pulse, a breath and was relieved to find a steady one.
Potter smiled softly. "Not as much as it did before." He said. At that moment I realized how much had changed. I realized that Potter didn't hate me anymore. I realized that everything was okay now, it was all better now. By reassuring me instead of mocking me, I realized the fact that Potter had forgiven me for all the foul things I had done, for all the wrong and regretted choices I had made.
"Then how did it get here?" Draco asked. He was pretty sure who was behind it, the same Dark Wizard who wanted to kill Potter but why leave the book in a library?
"Potter! Potter, look at me." Draco placed his palms on each of Potter's cheeks, a rough stubble tickling his fingers, and forced Potter to look at him.
Harry didn't ask the man about the Dark Wizard's identity; he knew it was no good.
He saw Asper's eyes widen comically, a soft surprised breath escaping the old man.
"Here. Have this." Harry says, sitting beside Draco and giving him a piece of chocolate.
"No."
"What did you do?" I asked her as soon as she reached me.
Draco had noticed his Mother's behaviour too. He knew she missed Lucius, knew how hard it was for her to live without him but he always avoided talking about his Father, especially in front of Mother.
. "I can't do it today then. I am very tired already."
"Hey." Harry said with that brilliant smile of his.
"What in Salazar's name was that?" Draco exclaimed.
"I think I'll go home too." Malfoy said, with a nod to Harry and Ron, he disappirated.
"Fine, only because you're insisting so much." Malfoy sighed but it didn't bother Harry because it was the fakest sigh he had ever heard.
I obey and stare at the blurry figure of Pansy. She slides my glasses on my face and steps back. I blink for a few minutes and then everything comes into focus.
Black spots danced around the edges as the dark and murky street transformed into a scene from a smudgy oil painting. Harry felt his hands shake as his breathing became shallow, afraid he'd give himself away, he clapped a shaking hand on his mouth, trying to muffle the sound of his laboured breathing. Harry did not have a bloody clue as to what was happening to him but he knew his auror team would be right behind him, he knew they'd soon come.
~~~●●●~~~
"Alright then, please sign this form." Kingsley slid a parchment inf front of him.
For a few seconds they stared at each other, then Potter spoke, "Let's not talk here." With that he turned around in the direction of his office.
"Thank you, Harry." She says and her voice carries so much gratitude, so much emotion, Harry can't help but mean it when he says, "It's a pleasure."
Draco walked towards where Kingsley was directing; a freezing white room. Draco entered and saw the two dead bodies laying on a stretcher. They were covered with white sheet so Draco couldn't see them. Draco wasn't unnerved by that, he was a Healer, he had seen dead bodies before, examined them even but the thought of how much damage was done to
"The hell?" Is the only thought in his mind after he has finished reading it. Not only did Potter send him this letter at this time of the night, he apologized, actually apologized to Draco. What 'surprising' things had he realized, anyways that he had left Draco without so much as a 'Good job' or 'Goodbye'? Draco knows he should say something, say how disrespected Draco had felt when Potter had that expression on his face or when Potter exited unceremoniously but all he could feel was a warmth in his heart at the fact that Potter apologized. Damn his lovesick side, damn Draco's unreturned feelings.
He felt mortified for acting like a sensitive crybaby but Potter's comfort made him feel better than he had in days so he let go of everything he had kept bottled up; his unreturned feelings about Potter, fear of being married without his choice, fear of his Father, fear of losing his magic. Everything that had made him feel suffocated had now been released in the warm cocoon of Potter's warmth. Draco felt exhausted and his eyes fluttered, his mind still on his previous thoughts as he fell asleep, still in Potter's arms. His last thought was how he could be in them forever.
"Okay." Draco says. He doesn't want to sit in awkward silence so he tries to get to know Potter, their professionalism aside, he wants to befriend Potter, maybe more after that. See if Potter actually likes him or is doing this only out of obligation. Even though he knows Potter doesn't like him that way, why would he? He is a Greek God while Draco is just slim and pale and pointy but a small part of him hopes and wishes that Potter would want to be with him as much as he wants to be with Potter but just as he is about to ask the first question, Potter abruptly stands up.
"Oh, come on, Potter. I want to know why you hate the Minister so much."
"A lot of people want me dead, yet here I am." Harry said.
Draco has his first lesson with Harry.
Do tell me your thoughts and feel free to give any suggestions you like. Also if there is anything you want me to include in the story, feel free to mention it. The next Chapter will be up next week!♡♡
Kingsley sighed, "Harry you know that the Minister-"
"Its okay." He proceeds to cast a calming charm and signals Draco to try again.
He had entered the house before and it was the same as he had left it, except for the absent dead bodies. The puddle of blood was still there, it's disgusting smell in the air.
I gritted my teeth. Potter was acting like he was doing a huge favour coming here, which he was, my mind reminded me but this was his job, wasn't it? He was supposed to be professional.
"So who are you guys taking to the ball?" Ron folded his hands behind his head, looking entirely too comfortable.
The demolished house on the end of the street was always off-limits. Innocent little children were forced to stay in their houses, wizards were not able to roam freely in the streets, all for fear of the monster that lived in House 248.
"Close the lid, Zabini." He says as he supports Draco's limp body and stands.
"You haven't slept yet, baby?" Harry asked, managing a tired smile.
Draco's eyebrows rose. 2000 Galleons was a generous amount and was definitely a plus but Draco's reason for accepting Kingsley's offer was still mainly to make up for all the devilish things he had done.
bodies made him shudder.
"You are my everything, Mother. The only thing I have left, the only thing I love and will love forever. I care about you and your current behaviour is making me worried."
"Yes you will."
"Sit." He gestured to a chair.
and not your company."
Draco nodded, "I just came to give you this. I'll be going now, if you don't mind."
"Why not? You haven't done anything wrong. You killed evil; you still do." Malfoy said, searching Harry's eyes for something Harry didn't know of.
"Potter, you know you can't fight me, besides, you want to impress Dray, don't you?"
"Come soon, lover boy." With that she disappirates.
Draco was over-reacting and
He couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't bare the way Potter was ignoring him. He shot up from his seat causing Potter's focus to drift away from his precious reports.
Harry had heard it enough times by now to know what was a simple hiss and what wasn't. This wasn't just a simple hiss. It was Parseltongue, Harry knew that all too well but either the words didn't make any sense or Harry had lost his sense of thought along with hearing and sight too.
Harry cringes at Ron's disbelieving shout. When Harry had told him that Malfoy couldn't perform magic anymore, he sounded gleeful, too gleeful but when he come to know of how Harry had agreed to help him, his reaction wasn't the best.
"Breathe, Hermione." Harry cuts her off with a grin, moving in the living room and hugging Ron.
He crouched low just behind a wall nearby, like a predator waiting to attack its prey at the right time, watching the criminal as he searched for something in his coat. Harry waited, adrenaline rushing in his veins like blood, he waited for the man to reveal the precious heirloom he had stolen after murdering a Ministry official. Harry was ready to spring up on the man the minute he took out the evidence of his guilt but just as the man did that, Harry's vision blurred.
"Sure. Thanks once again." Narcissa says and gets up and Harry shows her out the door. Closing the door behind him, Harry takes a minute to think what the hell he has gotten himself into.
The man shook his head, his cheeks stained a rusty red and his brow beaded with sweat.
"Can you both go and bring a bowl or something? We need water to wake him up." Potter says.
Draco thought but didn't speak his mind.
"I request you to kindly not make a scene at the ceremony. You are now on a higher post among the aurors, it will not put out a good impression if you act aggressively."
"Now since you've mastered the Levitating spell, let's move to something more challenging. How about...ummm...say...a Reducto?"
The man grabbed a goblet and threw it at the far wall. It fell to the ground loudly but stayed whole.
He stood in the middle of a bare land, almost like a desert except for the fact that the sand was brown-red. A wind blew past him and sand flew into his eyes. Harry closed them instinctively.
"Are you sure you've read this one?" Potter asked Draco for the trillionth time.
"Probably a month or two."
Malfoy raised a disbelieving brow, "Really, Potter? You couldn't ask me anything else?"
"Want to give it a last try?" Harry asks once Draco has finished his chocolate.
"Hey yourself." Draco smiled back shyly as he entered the house, hanging his coat on the hook.
"I am afraid, that's all we have, Mr. Malfoy." Kingsley said.
"Why is Potter here?"
"O-of course." The man winced lightly as Harry took out his wand and twirled it in his hands.
Harry's insides churned at it and he clenched his fists, both in anger and fear.
"Okay, Asper. I borrowed this book a few days before for an Auror case." Draco said.
"Sir Shacklebolt, Harry asked me to send this message to you. We are both fine but extremely exhausted. Harry will be reporting to you tomorrow." The patronus stopped speaking and then vanished into thin air.
"Mistress Malfoy! What a pleasure. Would you like Kreacher to make you your favourite chamomile tea? Or the curry you like so much? Kreacher has learnt how to make it from-"
"Hundred percent." Draco replied firmly. He won't be changing his mind now.
Draco cut her rant of with an upheld palm. "I will talk to her, Mippey." He nodded and moved towards the living room.
"So y-you want me to return that favour an year after the war?"
Draco felt the oxygen level decrease in the room at Potter's words. Somehow, he managed to nod and attempt a shaky smile which apparently satisfied Potter as he went back to his report.
A sudden urge to beat his confused, innocent face to a bloody pulp comes over me but I resist. No good beating up my best friend's future boyfriend.
"Me?" Malfoy asked as he picked up the wooden menu a waiter in a tailored black coat just placed in front of them.
didn't go to today but shouldn't Shacklebolt consider that? Isn't there any respect, any consideration left for him?
Whoever was the killer, he was ruthless and dangerous.
Draco took a deep breath and exhaled softly as he clutched his head in the Auror bathroom. He kept the book aside and splashed some cold water on his face.
Harry continued working on his report until Malfoy spoke again. "How did you know that the potion was fatal? Did you test it on anyone?" Malfoy's next question was uttered in the same calm and collected voice as before but it sent a flare of anger through Harry.
"I wish to talk to you about a certain book I borrowed." Draco spoke respectfully, just as his mother had taught her.
"As you know, there is a Ministry ceremony, to thank the employees for their efforts, that is held every year." Kingsley continued, ignoring Potter's sharp exhale. "And this time, Mr. Malfoy is invited too since he's helping the Ministry."
"Say my name too then." He whispered back.
Perhaps a mistake? Draco hoped it was because if it was some kind of manipulative act to lure the Aurors towards whatever the man wanted, Draco didn't know what that would mean. And he had no desire to.
"Go look in the mirror." Pansy squeals, clapping her hands together and jumping up and down behind me.
Draco sighed, why were Aurors so thick-headed? "It is a paste which was around the bigger wounds. I had thought it was rotten flesh but it wasn't. There are little pieces of glittering stones in there but I'm not sure what they are. I'll have to examine this."
"Oh, I don't give a single fuck about that bastard, Kingsley. You and I both know he doesn't deserve the position he holds." To say Draco was shocked at Potter's words was an understatement. Potter was talking that way about the
? It didn't sit well with Draco, it looked like a trap but why in Salazar's name would they want to trap him at all? He hadn't done anything wrong.
"Then why are these lessons still continuing?" Pansy raised an eyebrow.
Draco was aware he shouldn't be focusing on these things, his attention should be on who was trying to kill the guy instead, but Draco couldn't help it.
"Can you feel your magic?" Harry asks.
"I think you do, Dolohov." Harry said. "I suggest you speak up before I make you." As if in response, a few sparks burst from his wand.
"D-Draco?" He asked hesitantly, moving a little closer to Malfoy. When Malfoy didn't pull back but stared at Harry's feet, Harry took it as a sign of encouragement and moved forward. He squatted infront of Malfoy and attempted to comfort him again.
." Dolohov said with surprising intensity.
"I'm not lying. You're so beautiful, Draco. I'm so proud of you. You did it, Draco. I knew you could do it."
(POV Harry)
"So you wanted to talk about the ferret?" Ron asked around a mouthful of cake.
Draco smiled back and apparated back home.
"Alright. Now think of the happiest memory you can." Harry instructs.
Draco groaned and whipped out his wand, first casting a Lightening charm on the auror in front of him, then Levitating him outside the room.
"It's your birthday gift. Happy Birthday." I tell her.
I grin at her and turn left and right. "Do you think I look okay?" I ask nervously, waiting for her approval.
"I don't care about others. My friends will support me no matter what. So, will you be with me Draco? Will you be mine?" Harry asked again.
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy working with the red potion; Malfoy had said it was harder to determine its effects than the paste's so he wanted to crack its mystery first. Harry glanced up at the blonde then; over the course of the few weeks they had worked together, Harry had observed how Malfoy had changed since Hogwarts, both physically and personality wise too.
Then the whispers started again;
"Yes?" The glower in the old man's eyes was an extremely irritated one.
"No I won't."
Harry was surprised to hear that admission from Malfoy. "Why?" Was all he managed.
(Harry's POV) ~~~●●●~~~ (Harry's POV)
As I turn back, I'm pretty sure I heard a whoop of excitement from the direction he went in.
"N-no"
He felt Harry move more closer. Draco could feel Harry's warm breath on his lips. He couldn't wait for what was to come. His toes curled in his shoes and he fisted Harry's shirt in his hands. Draco had no idea how long it had passed when Harry finally, after torturing Draco sweetly, finally pressed his lips to Draco's.
Then he had given Draco that grin; the all-too-wide-split-your-face-into-two grin. And Draco couldn't resist poking some fun back at him. He would one-up Potter and have the last word.
"You want to go and live there again? Haven't we already made enough memories there? Not to remind you that they aren't good ones. I don't want to see those gates or that cellar to remind me of how I was captured there or how Hermione was tortured. And you? Haven't you been Crucioed there enough times? Haven't you recieved the Dark Mark there? You want to relive those memories again?" Harry shouts.
"It isn't funny! Harry do you know why his magic has gone away? As soon as Ron told me, I researched but-"
"You did it." Potter is smiling softly at him and there is so much pride and admiration in his eyes that they are shining and Draco feels his heart flutter as it normally does around Potter but he cherishes the feeling and it makes his heart clench thinking how he was the one who put the expression on Potter's face and- with a deep breath Draco cuts off the thoughts of his stupid lovesick side.
"So? Do I have magic?" Malfoy asks anxiously.
Harry nods then asks his next question. "What was the first spell you tried to perform?"
"Here, Potter. You can try it." Draco pushed the platter towards Potter who looked up at him in surprise.
"What in the name of Salazar are you doing?" Blaise shouts as soon as we get out of the room.
"Okay, then. I uh- discovered something. We have a lead." Malfoy grinned brightly, his eyes sparkling with happiness and Harry couldn't look at that open expression for a second longer. He looked away.
"Harry, I'll just say it. Either you ask him out today, or tell him that you would like to keep hanging out with him." Hermione finally suggests.
Harry apparates at the Burrow by 7 p.m. for dinner. As soon as he enters, he cinds himself wrapped up in someone's arms, soft hair tickling his cheeks. He realizes it's Hermione once she pulls back. "Oh Harry! I've been meaning to talk to you for so long! What you are doing for Malfoy, it's so mature of you to forget your past history and-"
So that was it.. Do tell me what you think.
"Do you think he's lying?" Draco couldn't help but ask.
"I love you so much, Dray. Seeing you cry, it breaks my heart. I'm so so sorry." Harry kisses Draco's forehead and lays down beside him. Hoping to make it up to Draco in the morning.
"And it's very Slytherin of you to avoid my question." Harry stated.
"Would you please close your mouth, Draco?" Narcissa hisses.
Harry walked inside, taking a seat in front of Kingsley.
Draco wanted to tell her that what he was doing did
But then Malfoy shrugged and muttered half-heartedly, "I like green."
"Ar-are you sure I c-can d-do it?" Draco stutters like a 5 year old, once again embarrassed by his inability to perform simple magic even 1st years should know. Potter's genuine smile, which he recieved in return was probably worth it.
With a smile Harry told them, in less crude language, about how he was feeling. A long silence continued when Harry was done.
"So I have heard that the famous Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, The Chosen One, The Boy Who Lived has taken it upon himself to teach magic to none other than Draco Malfoy, his arch nemesis. What compelled you to make this choice Mr. Potter?" George says, holding his fist infront of Harry as a mic.
"I-I think we should talk later." Draco says.
"You still think I can do this?" Draco asks but he stands up anyway. Add Harry to the list of things Draco can never say no to as well.
"What was that?" I ask, meaning the silent conversation she just had with Blaise.
Harry nodded, "We do have it but Kingsley has kept it hidden safely, considering the danger it poses. He'll let us inspect it if we request, though."
"Draco. There is an urgent firecall for you from the Ministry." His Mother hurried over to him as soon as he stepped in the Manor. She looked anxious, her eyes wide and urgent.
When no reply came, Harry took it as a yes and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. At first Malfoy froze but when Harry ran a hand down his back, he relaxed and sobbed into Harry's shoulder. Harry whispered to him about how sorry he was and that he had no idea what had come over him. That Draco had done nothing wrong, that he was a good man, that it wasn't Draco's fault, all the while Harry's hand ran down Malfoy's back in a comforting gesture while the other hand massaged his head.
"Oh? How many potions do you use on your hair? And these robes you're wearing? Let me guess hundred percent pure silk. And-"
think he was cleverer and stronger than the Aurors.
"A case, Kingsley?" Harry asked, usually it was Robards, the Junior Head of the Auror Department, who gave Harry the cases. He exhaled softly, relived by the fact that Kingsley wasn’t aware of his episode.
"Y-yes. I did. I was able to levitate a leaf higher than that-that day and after much practice, I could even lift a cauldron!" Draco exclaims, excited about the progress he was making in so  little time. He had pushed himself to the limit and had fainted actually. His mother had found him on the floor, wand in hand and had scolded him for over-exerting himself but she was proud with Draco's progress nonetheless. Potter, however, didn't need to know that.
"Maybe they've changed their minds about you. Realized that you
Narcissa, though didn't seem to mind. She gracefully picked up the teacup that Kreacher had served and took a sip. Her eyes closed for a few minutes. Harry drank his tea too, it was warm and tasted good.
She shouts and even though no one knows who she calls "Dray", they all turn to look at me, in Potter's arms, because Pansy is grinning and waggling her eyebrows at me. I feel my blush spread from the tips of my ears all the way to my chest.
"Do you guys have coke?" Harry asked. He could see Malfoy frown in confusion.
Draco has no idea how to do that. He has tried before but to no avail. He tries, though, because he can't imagine living without magic forever. He relaxes, clearing his mind of all thoughts. Suddenly, he feels something cold trickling at the back of his neck, like someone casting a disillusionment charm.
"Yes, yes, I remember. So? Have you decided?" Potter asked. Draco had no idea what was going on so he only flitted his eyes from the guy, Will apparently, to Potter.
This thought reminded Draco of the real problem he was dealing with. The wizard brewing the potion was extremely dangerous. Draco wanted to examine the potion sample as quickly as possible and then get rid of it. No need to keep anything evil lurking around.
Harry was very very tired. Robards had been giving him shitty cases for a long while and wasn't considering giving Harry good ones even after Harry practically begged him. Harry knows he can be a little impulsive... well.. maybe a bit more than little.... but that wasn't the point was it? Like who gives a Senior Auror a case of robbed teapots of an old lady who loves cats?
Harry looked around his office, taking in the place he had spent so many sleepless nights in, solving case after case. Most of them had been challenging but Harry, along with his team had got to the bottom of each and every one of them.
Potter picked up the picture of the murder scene and examined it with a crease between his brows. Draco stared at him, though he didn't know why. Perhaps because he had never seen Potter look so tired and weary.
"Yes, Mother. I – there’s a yearly Ministry Ball and they have invited me too." He muttered, not meeting his mother's eyes.
Draco's breath was now coming in short bursts, his heart rate spiking up with excitement. He
"Nothing." Hermione sighed. "So Harry? You wanted to talk about something?"
"I don't believe you."
A loud crack interrupted his musings. "Master Malfoy! Mippey is here to take your cloak!" His house-elf exclaimed. Draco nodded and handed his cloak to her, waiting for her to disapparate like she usually did but she only stared at him with huge eyes.
Harry sits in silence for a while. Contemplating the situation, the pros and cons of accepting this job.
With a sigh Draco tells them about the settlement with Potter, how much Potter has changed and their first lesson about Draco's magic. After he finishes speaking, there is a stunned silence which is broken by Pansy, "How great! Now you can finally tell him about your feelings. I swear I was so tired of your pining after him. Potter this, Potter that. Potter's hair, Potter's eyes, Potter's ars-"
"P-Potter." The man stuttered back.
"I have made my choice; Draco and he has made his." Mother's tone was clipped and icy, Draco resisted the urge to flinch at it. She always used that voice when he was misbehaving or did something disappointing when he was a child but Draco wasn't a child anymore. He was a man, a man with a free will and complete independence over his life.
"Now remember, Draco, no disrespect, no sarcasm and no whinings. I want you to act as a respected member of a respected family." Narcissa says. Draco is about to remind her that Malfoys are hardly a "respected" family anymore when the door swings open and Draco sucks in a sharp breath.
"Before, I didn't push you because I wasn't sure whether you had magic at all or not. Now I was sure so I did push you. As for what I casted, it was a simple calming charm."
Harry saw the shopkeeper gulp and knew he was right.
Draco sighs. "Fine. Enter my mind." He says finally. He tries to perform the little Occlumency he had learnt from Aunt Bella, trying to keep Potter out of the embarrassing and shameful parts of his mind.
"Close your eyes." He finally demands. Draco does. If someone told his father that Draco obeyed Potter's orders without any hesitation, he would probably die of shame or break free and kill Draco.
"Okay, now close your eyes like a good boy." Pansy orders and unscrews the cap of the tube.
And then all the stares I caught him giving Draco while he wasn't watching, the soft and tender way he held Dray's wrist, the way he realized that Draco was scared and then reassured him, all those things start to make sense as I realise that Potter likes Draco.
The words lit up a new kind of hope in Harry. He smiled and nodded, hoping his saviour status can help him get a guy.
"Antonin Dolohov."
As he neared the place, Harry saw what he had been looking for. It was a small dagger, it's hilt was gold with a sparkling, emerald green stone set in the middle. Around the huge stone, there were small empty spaces, as if some of the jewels that had sat there had been removed. The blade wasn't covered in blood as Harry had expected but it was sharp as though someone had just whetted it.
