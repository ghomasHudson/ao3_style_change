Draco looked up at the teetering house before following everyone inside. It looked exactly how he had always expected the Weasley house to look, but it was like he was seeing it through different eyes. The features of it  he would have made fun of in the past, now seemed fun and cosy. He realized how much he changed since Hogwarts, and also since he started dating Harry.
"Don't tell your brother and sister, please, let me tell them." Albus couldn't believe is father was actually asking something of him. Now. But he doesn't want to have to go explain this to his siblings anyway.
Harry legs gave in and he collapsed into the dirt ground. Everything was numb. He knew what he had to do. He turned the vial over in his hand, watching the little air bubble move around the side of the glass. It was a very fast acting poison, he would likely be dead before he swallowed. He unplugged the cork.
James, Lily and Albus had heard growing up that their father must be crazy or even dangerous: "Harry Potter must be fucked in the head after all he's been through!" "He was only a boy when he killed the Dark Lord, that must mess you up." "Harry Potter is good but he's still a murderer. He killed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!" Most people adored Harry for what he had done, but even those who loved him many still questioned his sanity.
"Just when it seemed like everything was perfect, you always have to mess it up." Ron said sarcastically. They all giggled as the mood lightened.
Then Molly insisted on a photo with Ginny and Neville and Draco and Harry. Then more with other people, all the while people were still trying to give Harry hugs, pats on the back, and handshakes. It was chaos for a while, but finally it came to a end and it was time for 'Happy Birthday' and cake.
He heads down the hallways, this turn and that turn towards the shortcut to the dungeons. Harry thinks he's going the right way, it had been a while since he had all the passageways in the castle memorized. He turns a corner, and there, walking towards him, is Draco Malfoy.
"Fine." Draco said, he turned to Hermione, "I just want to say I'm sorry for calling you a... 'mud blood'." That word seemed harder to say now.  "I know I should have years ago. I don't expect you to forgive me, but I just needed to say it."
"It's ok sis, we understand." George said, "We just want to be here for you. I thought Harry was right for you, what did the brat do?"
But if Draco wasn't playing with Harry then did that mean he fancied Harry back? Could 'the chosen one' and 'the boy who had no choice' ever really be... a couple? That thought was still foreign to Harry.
"Just tell us, Harry." Hermione said calmly, "Did your issues affect something?" She asked concernedly.
. How did he know? Was it that obvious? But slowly he started to think about what Aberforth had just said.
"Neville, we're good." Harry patted Neville on the shoulder. Just as Harry was going to turn back to Draco, he saw a Hogwarts student come through the door.
Harry couldn't help but smile, everyone at the table seemed pleased as well, "Yes, I think it will be the right thing for me. After a year off, I'll being starting the following school year."
"Dad?" Albus and Scorpius both say in surprise in unison. Albus is frozen where he was standing by the door, Scorpius right behind him.
George chimed in, "Gryffindors for life, right?" Just then the door opened and in walked Bill and Fleur.
Lily and Albus just remained silent, but James angrily spoke up, "Tell us what dad? That your gay? Or that you're dating a Deatheater!?"
! I wasn't happy about you being with her in the first place but you're DIVORCING her after 20 YEARS of being married to her! You guys have kids together! What the BLOODY HELL did you do?" Ron yelled at Harry.
Harry and Ginny felt terrible. For a second, both of them wished they could take it back. Wait until the children were older. But they knew it wouldn't do any good. If they tried to stay together longer just for the kids, it would just put a lot of strain on the family. Both Harry and Ginny believed this was for the best.
Harry looked wide-eyed at Draco. Draco also looked amazed. They looked at each other and then broke into laughter.
"Well," Harry said as he reached into his robe pocket and pulled out a ring box, "I was going to do this today, but then Neville asked so I figured I would just wait–"
"No, see that's the thing, one of my father's old friends in the Ministry told me someone - someone important - vouched for us. Couldn't tell me who it was though."
Albus finally turned back to see the mixed expressions on his brother and sister: they looked worried and confused. "Because I know." Albus wanted to keep his promise to his dad, despite his father lying to him.
"I don't think that that is that bad Ginny, but why did you do it? I know you were drunk but..." George trailed off. He didn't want to put more blame on his sister, but he knew you don't hit on other guys just because you're drunk.
Draco jumped up and rushed to his fireplace, "Ministry of Magic" he said clearly, throwing the floo powder into the ashes.
"Potter?" he heard from the top of the stairs, "What are you doing in my house?" Harry saw Draco's head come over the railing. Draco said it in an entitled way, but his face looked happy to see Harry. He came down the stairs to greet Harry.
"I don't know. It was stupid. We've become friends, you see..." Harry said looking at Hermione and Ron. He should be honest with them; he was always honest with them. But he couldn't stand to look at their faces so he looked back down to the ground when he said, "Well... maybe more than friends."
Harry felt Ron's arms wrap around him too. "No, he's not. You are the bravest man I have ever known." Ron said.
The kids were absolutely shocked, they had had a million different thoughts running through their head of what could be wrong but not a single one of them had thought of this. They all thought their parents were in love; they never fought and they seemed to be happy.
Draco was sitting in his house when he turned on the radio and heard Harry's voice, "...other thing I would like to address is the rumors about my sexuality."
"It's the sex isn't it?" George asked jokingly with a smirk. But then he looked over at Luna for a quick glance and Ginny could tell he was thinking about something dirty. Even though she knew it was just a joke, she felt weird that he said that in front of their mother because it was partly true.
"Your mother," Harry continued, putting a hand on Ginny's knee, "deserves someone who can be there for her. Who loves her in a way that I can't."
Ron was steaming mad when Harry got there and almost immediately started yelling. His face was so red he looked as if he was about to explode, and he was screaming so loud that Hermione had to put a silencing charm on the room so they didn't wake up the neighbors.
Molly then grabbed the sides of Harry's face with her hands, making him look at her standing over him. Harry looked into Molly's eyes for the first time since the conversation started, and in them he saw love and acceptance. Having Mrs. Weasley accept him was as if his own mother was.
"My own son..." Harry said between sobs, "called me a coward.... and he's right." Harry couldn't stop thinking about what James has said. He was a coward for living a lie all these years. Lily was right that he hid it from himself and Ginny when deep down he always knew. Albus was right that he chose to date Draco, something he predicted Albus wasn't going to be happy about. Harry kept it from him, from all of them, which he always knew was just going to make it worse. But he was too much of a coward to face them. His son was right.
Ron then had a thought pop into his head. He knew he shouldn't have to ask, but he felt like he just needed to make sure, "Harry... You don't fancy me right?"
"Room of Requirement, huh? Wish we had gotten the chance- OW! Stop doing that!" Ron said as Hermione jabbed his shoulder again.
"There's something you should probably see..." Ron said nervously, "It's not good." He handed Harry the morning's Daily Prophet.
James was having a really hard time believing it. He always felt like he was very close to his father. How could his dad hide something this big from him? Why did he marry his mother if he was gay?
"I don't feel like being blamed and yelled at again, Potter." Draco masked the sadness in his voice now; he was trying to sound angry. He felt torn about Harry being here. He still fancied Harry. The day they shared at Hogwarts was one of the best of his life. But it seemed like that was all over because Harry believed that he was the one to tell Rita Seeker about his
"But what about them dating! Did you know?!" Albus asks, now directing his anger towards his friend.
Draco looked to Harry, trying to silently ask him if that really meant he was being invited to the Weasleys'. Harry gave a slight nod, grasped Draco's hand and disapparated with the rest of the group to right outside the Burrow.
By the time Harry kissed his children goodbye back on platform 9 & 3/4, things felt at least semi-back-to-normal with James, Lily and Albus. With all the commotion, however, he didn't see Draco on the platform that day.
The faces saddened. "He didn't want to come." James replied, then he rushed into saying, "Dad, I'm so sorry I called you a coward. You're the bravest man I know. I can't believe you stood up and told everyone. That was incredible and I know that took a lot of strength." he said without stopping for air.
On his way through the ministry, Harry saw a Daily Prophet stand. The front page read "Harry Potter Cheat? The Real Reason Why The Potters Divorced" Luckily, it hadn't gotten out to the press that Harry was gay, yet. Harry wanted to explore his sexuality, but he was very weary about dating. He was worried that if he tried to date then it was going to get out, and he wasn't ready for the whole wizarding world to know.
Albus felt bad saying in front of his mother that he preferred to stay with his dad, so he kept quiet. He hadn't really processed the rest of what this would mean for the family.
Draco opened the door with a surprised look, "What are you doing here?" he didn't sound angry, honestly he sounded a bit sad.
"I didn't want to tell you guys until you came back because I wanted you to have a nice honeymoon. I didn't think the press would get it this soon. I'm sorry I didn't tell you."
Ginny turned to Harry to see if she should go on, Harry was glad to have her do so. This was harder for him to say to aloud; he never could really say the words. "Your father suffers from depression and PTSD." Ginny said as she started rubbing Harry's back. Harry was full on head in between his knees now.
"No, it had to be when I told Draco. We didn't tell the kids about the... we didn't tell the kids all of it, remember?" Harry said. He was still in a bit of shock. He blamed Draco. He blamed Draco and now he had fucked everything up. Draco wouldn't want to be his friend anymore, or anything more.
"Unless he has done something terrible to you Ginny? Like maybe... cheat?" Molly asked looking at her daughter.
When they got to the town, Harry found what he was looking for: Chinese food. He took Draco inside and ordered to go for the both of them as Draco looked around.
"Hey, is Neville free?" Harry asked, "I saw him earlier but we didn't get to speak much. He had to prepare for his lessons."
Luna was the first to speak. "That's not your fault. You could've have worked that out. Harry is a nice guy, he would understand."
Hagrid seemed to snap back into it, "Alright? 'Course it's alright! I love ya just the same 'Arry. Makes no difference to me." He said with a large smile.
of your friends about this. Your father, our whole family has been through enough. We don't need this is the news too."
"Harry!" Hermione said urgently as she ran down the stairs and also gave him a hug, "I have to tell you something!"
About two weeks later, Harry, Ginny, Hermione, Ron, and Draco were all waiting on Platform 9 3/4 together. The train pulled up in a puff of steam and through the crowd they saw their six kids coming towards them, all together as if they had rode in the same compartment.
Draco said nothing, then he leaned in and kissed Harry. They held the kiss, forgetting their kids could see them (though they doubted they were watching anyway). When they finally pulled apart, "Can I take that as a 'yes'?" Harry asked softly.
Their father said, "Your mother and I need to talk to you in person, and we didn't want to wait until Christmas." The kids all had their suspicions confirmed now that it must be something bad.
Harry rolled his eyes to Draco, seeming jokingly annoyed and not at all surprised by Molly's surprise family invites. Draco on the other hand was starting to sweat. He wasn't prepared to meet everyone tonight. He couldn't believe himself,
Harry then looks to Draco and Draco looks at him. Harry has a strong urge to kiss him, but he doesn't want to do that right in the middle of his press conference. He settles for grabbing Draco's hand and interlocking their fingers.
Harry was very grateful Ginny started for him. "I know he doesn't show it, but your father still has a very hard time with what happened with Voldemort." Ginny had since been used to saying the name. They rarely talked about him in the house, but when they did they always used his name, never 'The Dark Lord' or 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.'
They both leaned in and kissed each other, and just as they did, the bell above the door rang and it opened. Harry and Draco looked up to see Albus and Scorpius staring at them.
"Why didn't you identify me at the manor?" He didn't even have to say anything more about that day. They both knew he was talking about the time that snatchers had brought Harry, Hermione, and Ron to Malfoy manor while they had been on the run destroying horcruxes. Harry had a disfigured face and Draco was asked to identify him so he could be given to the Dark Lord, but Draco didn't.
"DINNER!" Molly yelled from the kitchen. So before anymore could be said on the subject, the six men got up and helped Mrs. Wealsey bring food from the kitchen to the big table set up outside, and they all sat down to eat the feast Mrs. Wealsey had prepared.
James, quite the opposite, was still internally freaking out about everything that was going to change. He felt like someone just turned his whole life upside-down.
Harry didn't see Draco in these days. He still felt conflicted about being with him now that he knew all of his kids didn't approve. Now they would also have to deal with the article too. How was Draco going to feel about being with him now? That article didn't just out Harry, it had outed Draco too. Would Draco ever want to be with him publicly? Harry had always avoided that conversation with him, but now he wished he hadn't.
Ron was still a bit mad, but less so at Harry. He couldn't help but feel bad for him; Harry had been through so much and it seemed like he could never just be happy.
It was true, Harry had stayed at Draco's nearly every night of the past few weeks. It was starting to feel more like home than his apartment. Draco had set up a whole closet for Harry to keep stuff there. "Uhh...." Harry had no idea what to say to the boy. Draco just gave him a look that said 'well I'm good with that.'
"We deciding to come back a little early when we saw the papers." Luna said. She looked sad; she felt bad that she and George were so in love when Ginny wasn't with Harry. For some reason, Luna had thought there was something wrong between Ginny and Harry for a while but didn't think it wasn't her place to say anything. Luna could just always tell.
"But it is. Harry... I cheated on you." Harry was shocked by this, he knew his wife had started to realize something was wrong. He thought maybe she thought he was cheating. He never would imagined that she would cheat on him.
Herminone and Ron remained the only people who knew, though Harry was reluctant to give them details. It was something, for the time being, that was really just between Harry and Draco. And Harry had never been more happy.
"I'm not really. Just to him. We - my wife and I - told him, and I've had men by the house over the years."
"No matter what people say about you, you will always be the boy who is defeated... Voldemort." Draco was not used to saying the name, but there was no point in fearing it any longer. Draco had watched him die - watched Harry Potter kill him - and he was never coming back. "And there will always be people who love you for that. You ended a war, Harry Potter, nothing will change that."
"Hey Harry!" said George and came up to him to give him a big pat on the back, confirming in Harry's mind that they were still friends.
They met Hermione, Ron, Ginny, George, Luna, Molly and Arthur back in the room Harry had started in before the press conference started.
"He didn't talk about me much, my brother." Aberforth said as he walked towards them with the drinks.
It took Harry a long while to calm his breathing. When he finally did, he wrote letters back to each of his kids. He told them it was true, but not to worry about him, and that he was sorry for not telling them all of it before.
Harry then looked to Dumbledore's portrait, who had been quietly listening in. Then he spoke to it, something, despite his frequent trips to Hogwarts this year, he hadn't done in years. "Why didn't you tell me?"
"Sometimes I wish I could. Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed some of the glory. But at this point in my life, I just want to live. I can't stand the reporters trying to find out things about me and the people wanting to know every detail of my life. I just want to be happy... And you make me really happy, Draco."
"Fine. Bloody fine, he says." Ron says to himself, "Hermione! Harry's here." he called out behind him.
Harry finally broke down crying, into Hermione's arms. She led him inside. Ron walked in, "Who's here-" he stops short when he sees his best friend crying in his wife's arms. "Harry..." he said quietly, in a worried voice.
"So," Draco finally asked, "that's why you divorced huh? Little Weaslett couldn't deal with you anymore?"
The two sit and talk for a while. Mostly about James, Albus, and Lily. Also reminiscing about Harry's times at Hogwarts. She does him curtesy of not asking Harry the reason for the divorce, and so the topic of Harry's sexuality doesn't come up. He's not even thinking about it when he gets up to go, hugging her again.
All day Thursday, Harry was excited that Draco was coming, but he had gotten wrapped up in his work when he heard a knock on his office door.
Then Lily started, "Ya, dad that was so brave. I'm sorry for what I said too. About mom and you, I shouldn't have."
"The Headmistress wants to see you in her office." he said. They knew this was coming. They got up and left through the portrait hole.
There wasn't much more conversation before kids all headed back to their dormitories. They didn't say anything to each other as they walked down the hallways, but there was an unspoken bond between them all now that was stronger than it had ever been.
"We just aren't happy together. It was a mutual decision; we both agreed it would be for the best. We both want a chance to be happy."
"You didn't tell us this was a whole family affair!" Harry called out to Mrs. Weasley who came bustling in for a second time to kiss her son and daughter-in-law.
There was a quiet moment between them before Ron said, "I'm sorry it went this way, mate. Now, what can I make ya for breakfast?"
"What is this place?" snickered Draco, hiding how much Harry meant to him was brining back his old bitchiness.
"Shut up, Malfoy." he cuts Draco off, and in two strides Harry crosses to him and kisses him deeply.
"Told Albus, James and Lily they had to come home this year though. Ginny and I wanted to have some family time with everything that's been going on."
They both ran to him and gave him a big hug. It felt so good to Harry after this past week, well really this whole year, of tension with the kids. Harry looked up and saw Minerva smile at him and then she left them.
"I had a feeling you'd be fucked up by now." Draco said with a little silly smile. It lighted the mood and Harry chuckled.
Harry was very tempted to reply 'I didn't know you could read' but then he remembered that Draco didn't know that Harry knew about that time he said it to 'Goyle.'
He stepped up onto the podium,"Sonorus!" Harry said pointing his wand at his throat and his voice spoke above all others, "Thank you all for being here. I've gathered you here today to clarify some things about me that were recently in the press." Harry took a deep breath, "It is true that I have in the past, and in lesser ways continue to, struggle with my mental health. And I have done so since the day I defeated Voldemort." The whole room winced but people knew that Harry Potter always used the name.
Harry went to the kitchen to get the owl a treat while Draco still slept. He grabbed a pen (which in his later years had started favoring over a quill and ink) and wrote back on the the same parchment:
"Fine!" Albus says before storming out with Scorpius on his heals, letting the door slam behind them.
"It's been a bit hard with the kids, but Ginny and I hadn't been good for a long while. It was time."
It was the a beautiful spring Saturday; Harry and Draco decided to go to Hogsmeade for the day. They didn't mind getting seen together, most people didn't know they were gay so everyone just assumed they had some business together or had now become friends.
"It was never relevant." Portrait Dumbledore said, "And I was quite ashamed that my feelings for Grindelwald clouded my judgement; I let things get too far before facing him. After him, I never found myself in love again."
"Ya, quite the stories I've been seeing in there. But I don't believe them, I know how much of what that woman writes is nonsense, used to feed her half of it." Draco and Harry both laugh.
"Ya. Pretty fucked. And that's not even all of it." The words were just slipping out,  "I tried to kill myself back then, about a year after the Battle of Hogwarts. Didn't tell the kids that though." Harry couldn't believe he had just told Draco that, he wasn't even sure why.
After living with Ginny and all the kids for a while again, his apartment felt very empty. Harry suddenly realized he hadn't written a letter to Draco since before Christmas. He took out a quill, ink and piece of parchment.
Harry was in shock, he was just frozen for a second, but once he processed what was happening, he started to kiss back, but Draco suddenly pulled away.
Harry knew he just had to say it. She deserved to know the real reason and know that it wasn't her fault at all. "I think... I think I might be gay." he said, glazing at the ground.
"Draco! We have to go; it's a Hogwarts weekend!" Draco jumped up, he didn't want to surprise run into his son either. They left the rest of their butterbeer and headed towards the door, "Bye Neville!" Harry yelled on his way out.
Albus didn't want to talk to them. He knew the letter was likely from their father and he didn't want to talk about it with James and Lily. He got up to leave but his siblings still came towards him, they caught up to him before he reached the door.
Harry was barley paying attention to what she was saying; his mind hadn't fully left Draco yet. Then from behind him he heard a door open. He looked behind him and out stepped Draco, who was holding his robes in his arms and hadn't bothered to fix his hair either.
Harry was left standing alone in the hallway again. He wasn't sure what to do with himself. At first he instinctually thought of heading to the Gryffindor common room, but then he realized that even if he knew the password he probably wasn't supposed to be in there. He decided to head to the Headmistress's Office instead, figuring he should pay Professor McGonagall a visit while he was here.
"The other thing I would like to address is the rumors about my sexuality." Harry paused before saying, "I am gay."
"I told you not to call me that!" Draco said through gritted teeth. Harry chuckled to himself, but Draco ignored him, "Was that an owl that flew through the bedroom?"
He removed the small vial. He had been planning this for a while. He hadn't told anyone. Everyone expected him to be happy. Voldemort was gone. The war was over. But not for Harry; he relived it every night in his dreams. He jumped and drew his wand at every sound. He saw Voldemort everywhere. How could he live a life like this? It was a life he wasn't supposed to be living anyway.
." Draco had only been using Harry's first name very occionsally. Usually when they were being serious.
. There had always been something about Draco, but Harry, maybe because he was so much in denial about his sexuality, or maybe because he couldn't bring himself to believe that he actually fancied his enemy, had always refused to let himself think about Draco in that way.
Hermione, Ron and Ginny left a few seconds before Harry stepped out into the atrium full of reporters yelling over each other  and cameras flashing and people crowded everywhere anxiously waiting to hear what Harry Potter had to say.
"Harry!" Hagrid said excited as he opened the door to see Harry standing on his step. "Cum in, cum in!" He eagerly ushered Harry inside.
"You got all the attention." Draco continued in earnest, "I was used to the center of attention back then, and I liked it. Everyone loved you, still do."
Harry put his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees. Ron still looked angry but stayed silent. He was still worried about his best friend.
"Not here Malfoy!" Harry said in an urgent whisper, "What if the kids are around, or anyone else for that matter!"
"Well so can I, Potter, because I don't have to work!" Draco says, reverting back to that entitled voice Harry was more familiar with as they walk out of the office.
He and Ginny were married that winter over the Christmas holidays. Neville wanted to do a big wedding, Mrs Weasley was more than happy to. Although Ginny wasn't too fond of the idea as she had done it once before, she obliged understanding it was Neville's first time getting married. They had it in the beautiful, large space decorated with the most beautiful plants. After their marriage, Ginny sold the house in which she had raised her kids with Harry. Ginny and Neville wanted to have a space that was their own, so they got a cute cottage not far from the Burrow with a huge garden. Neville now came home to Ginny every evening through the fire in his room at Hogwarts instead of sleeping at Hogwarts.
But it had been so long, and part of Harry had missed the Black Lake, the edge of the forest, and the view of the castle. He missed the stone hallways and classrooms as well, so Harry decided to head inside the castle. As he enters the large doors, he could hear a large clamor coming from the Great Hall: lunch must still be going on.
Hermione was the first to speak, "How did this come about? You just learned this? Are you sure?" she asked in rapid succession.
"Well I spend most of my days at home by myself and don't bother to cook. Mother never bothered to learn to cook after the house-elf left." Hearing Dobby being referenced pulled at Harry's heartstrings a bit, but Draco just continued on. "So I just make up whatever is around the house, usually its cold."
Harry nodded and Minvera nearly jumped for joy, "Well the current professor said he would stay one more year but if you'd like to come sooner-"
"Is that why you were so mean to me as kids?" Harry asked, looking back on their past in a different light for the first time.
"He didn't take it too well did he?" Harry said. Draco didn't say anything. Harry continued, "I didn't want them to find out this way."
Harry looked up and saw Hermione. She gave him a 'I told you so' look, Harry looked back down at his son, "I love you so much, Al. And you had every right to be mad. I should have told you. "
It wasn't until over a year later that Harry told anyone else. He told Ginny, Mr. and Mrs. Wealsey before he proposed. He thought Molly and Author should know before they gave their blessing to marry their daughter, and Ginny of course deserved to know who she was marrying. But they all told Harry it was ok. They already knew he had been really struggling, so it alarmed them, but it wasn't unbelievable.
He slowed down a bit and turned to Scorpius, "I can't believe them!" he said angrily, then quieter he said, "Our dads are gay."
"Of course I have friends, Potter!" said Draco defensively. "I still speak with Goyle and Blaise." By the way he said that Harry thought it was unlikely they spoke much anymore.
Christmas was fast approaching, which meant the kids were soon coming home for the holiday break. Harry started working overtime trying to free himself up so he could spend the holidays with his family, but that also meant his didn't get to see much of Draco in December.
Ron spoke up before Hermione even got the chance to answer, "Whatever you have to say you can say in front of me." Draco saw Hermione give her husband a look that blatantly read "I can take care of myself," but she turned back to Draco and said nothing.
"Listen, Ginny. This is not your fault." Harry didn't think Ginny had cheated. Even she really had, he was the one that pushed her into the arms of another man. "Even if you weren't drunk, I wouldn't blame you. You've been living with me for years and I've never been able to love you the way I should have. Then here comes someone you used to love who still has those feelings for you."
Together they answer questions about how long they had been together, and clarifying they were not at all involved during the Second Wizarding War or anytime prior to Harry's divorce. Harry answered questions about his sexuality explaining how he didn't realize he was gay until relatively recently. He answered questions on his mental health talking about his years of therapy and how the Minister was always aware. Harry ignored any questions about more of what happened in the forest during the Battle of Hogwarts or details on his suicide attempt: those felt far too private and difficult to talk about. But Harry had Draco by his side for all of it, and that gave him more strength.
"So you finally figured it out huh?" Charlie said to Harry nodding his head towards Draco, then he said quieter so the people in the kitchen wouldn't hear, "Mum keeps wanting me to get married but I'm still not sure how to explain to her I'm asexual."
"Oh! That." Draco looked bit nervous, "It was nothing, just uh.... dropping something off something for a friend."
A few days later, Harry arrived to work to find another owl on his desk, but what was surprising was that it was a Snowy owl. Harry hadn't known anyone to own one besides himself when he was young. He untied the letter. It was from Malfoy.
Draco continued, "But, you know, you make it through one day, then another. Then you went ahead and saved the bloody world and things got a lot easier."
"Don't mock my mother, Potter!" said Draco, be he didn't really seem too angry about it. "Now tell me what you're going on about."
He walked up to the bar and ordered a mead. There was a man sitting on a stool a few seats to his right. He thought it looked like... he looked closer, "Malfoy?"
Harry wasn't too surprised. He had never thought of this, but he remembered how unhinged Draco seemed back in 6th year. Him wanting to take his own life wasn't a far stretch since Voldemort would have killed him if he failed anyway.
"What do ya mea- OW!" said Ron. Harry looked up to see Ron rubbing his shoulder, presumably where Hermione had just jabbed him.
"How is it not fair? What isn't fair is you freaking out like this." Scorpius said, remaining calm, "Your dad probably feels horrible right now. I just want my dad to be happy, don't you want the same for yours?"
James told his siblings about this when he remembered it. The three of them got much closer over that break. They felt separated from their parents, and that pushed them more towards each other. They had long talks about what they had learned about their father and what life was going to be like with their parents now divorced.
"So," Draco said now that they could talk, "We're alright then?" He thought so but he felt like he had to ask after how distant Harry had been before.
Harry went over and got in next to him. Draco wrapped his arms around Harry and pulled him close. Harry laid his head on Draco's chest, and had one of the best sleeps of his life.
"Your father and I are just fine." Molly said with a smile, trying to keep Ginny as ease. Arthur was working late tonight. "Come sit with me, love."
"Well, we saw each other at The Leaky Cauldron one day and then we started becoming friends. Once I told him I was gay, he.... admitted he had feelings for me, and I realized I felt the same way about him."
"Come in." Harry said without looking up; he was used to other Ministry members coming to him for things.
"Sure." Harry said, quite confused. Neville led him upstairs into a bedroom where his three children were waiting. They looked just as confused as he was. Harry took a seat next to his son James and turned back to Neville, who was sweating profusely and shaking.
When Harry got a return letter from Hagrid saying that that worked and that he was looking forward to seeing him, Harry wrote to his kids to tell them he's be at Hogwarts, just so he didn't catch any of them by surprise. The next day he apparated right to the gates of Hogwarts, then made his way up to Hagrid's hut.
The two men make their way to a small restaurant on the corner and get seated at a small table across from each other.
Draco waited silently for Harry to speak. "I'm so sorry." Harry finally started, "I know it wasn't you, and I never should have assumed..." he trailed off.
"NEITHER DO I DAD!" James finally burst too, "I CARE THAT YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO TELL US! TOO MUCH OF A COWARD TO TO GO MARRY SOMEONE YOU ACTUALLY LOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE INSTEAD OF MARRYING MOM!" James had forgotten everyone else in the room, that it wasn't just him and his dad. He looked to his mom now, she looked sad, and he felt bad for saying all that. He was still breathing very heavy, his heart racing.
Ginny looked back down at her feet as she started the story, "I went to a bar one night, while you said you were working late, I thought you might be doing something else. I wanted to... you know, forget for a little while. After quite a few drinks, an old friend came by and was trying to help me get home. I knew that he liked me so I flirted with him. He knew I was drunk so he didn't engage. When he got me back here I convinced him to take me to the bedroom. I don't remember exactly what happened but I just remembering wanting to kiss him and then doing it."
The prefect led James and Lily to the gargoyle and told them to wait there. They were soon joined by Albus and the head of Slytherin house, who gave the password, "British Short-hair" (Professor McGonagall had made the passwords to her office different breeds of cats).
Harry took a deep breath, he knew he had to tell them the whole truth. They were family, they deserved it. "Actually... about that... there is something I have to tell you." He looked first at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then George's confused face, then at Hermione and Ron who knew exactly what was coming.
He didn't want to run into any of his kids though, it felt like a breach of privacy to do so, so Harry didn't want to go walk by the doors of the Great Hall. Just as he was about to turn away from the them, he saw a familiar face coming out towards him.
"Hmph!" Albus couldn't believe his own best friend wasn't on his side. He stormed away from him and back towards the castle.
But Draco wordlessly stepped aside and let Harry in. They sat across from each other in the living you.
Harry looked from Ron to Hermione. The looks on their faces were a twist of pain and relief. Harry broke down crying into the arms of his two best friends. It was the first time he had cried since the day after the Battle of Hogwarts.
When it had gotten quite dark, Draco pulled out some money and paid for both their drinks, "Let's do this again sometime?" he asked, a bit apprehensively.
Draco stayed close to Harry as everyone settled into the house. He still didn't know what to do with himself. He followed Harry to sit on the couch in the living room where George, Ron and Mr. Weasley were. Luna and Ginny were both helping in the kitchen. Draco silently listened in to the men's conversations.
Harry could see Draco's normally icy grey eyes were a warm grey. He just knew, even though he had been so worried that Draco didn't mean it or it was a trick, he knew in that moment it was all real. And Harry felt the same way about him.
When the two broke the kiss, Neville put the beautiful gold ring on her finger. Harry couldn't be happier for them. Then Draco whispered into his ear, "You ever going to get me a ring, Potter?" he seemed like he was trying to sound sarcastic, but Harry knew he was serious about it. "Like I know we don't need all this traditional hogwash, but it would have been nice."
He knocked on the door, and Hermione answered. "Harry? What's wrong?" she asked seeing the sad look on his face.
Molly replied, "They all have been working so hard I thought it would be nice to have the whole family together again." There was a moment of silence remembering that the whole family wouldn't be there, the whole family would never be there again. Fred.
"I'm sorry you had to find out that way." Harry said. Albus thought his dad would be very angry with him when he found out he had told his siblings, but when he looked up, Harry just looked sad. "I didn't know how to tell you."
"Albus!" Lily called out. Albus had to stop now, it would be weird if he didn't. She was holding the letter in her hand and James was right beside her. "It's a letter from dad."
Harry just nodded, he was trying to process, Dumbledore had been gay, he had been in love with his enemy, who was once a friend. Harry looked at Draco and couldn't help but see the parallels, only the other way around. They were enemies, then friends, and now... he looked at Draco who was looking into his drink, also lost in thought, and Harry knew he loved him.
"Do you veed velp in ve kitchen?" Fleur asked and followed Molly back into the kitchen as Bill headed to the living room.
Al looked up at Harry, they had gotten so close since the time-turner incident. Al was thinking about how he had just gotten through to his father and now they were going to be separated. He decided in that moment if his parents were going to be separated, he wanted to live with his dad in the summer. He would miss Lily, but he would get a break from James.
Lily just wanted to know why. What was so wrong with her parents that they didn't love each other anymore, but she couldn't bring herself to ask.
"That makes a lot of sense." George said staring off into space for a second. Apparently this is the first anyone had heard of it, except Bill looked completely unsurprised.
Harry had told him so much already, why not tell him the truth? He felt so comfortable with Draco. "The real reason," He said sitting on a opposite end of the couch as Draco, but facing him,  "is that I'm gay."
"We love you guys so much, and we're so sorry we're doing this to you three." Ginny said, "But me and your father just don't belong together... anymore. None of you were a mistake, we both love you all dearly. You are the best things in our lives."
"I don't regret anything between us." Ginny said and gave Harry a small smile. She meant it; despite how it was ending, she cherished the chapter of her life with Harry.
"I should go, but thank you again and good luck with everything. I promise I won't tell anyone, at least until it's in 'The Prophet!" Dean and Harry both gave a little chuckle.
"Would you and James, and Albus be alright with that?" Ginny said turning to her kids. They all nodded in agreement. Then she turned to the man she now loved. Neville looked shocked, not sure what to do. "So, how about it?" Ginny asked him, "Stay with us for a bit?"
"Oh... oh!" Ron said as he realized what that meant. "Really, mate? Draco Malfoy? How long that been a thing?" Hermione gave him a stern look. Hermione was quite surprised and didn't think it was the best idea either, but she thought Harry had been through too much today to also have his two best friends showing their disapproval over who he liked.
"It's time for everyone to hear the truth from you." Hermione said putting a supportive hand on his shoulder.
Harry sighed, he wasn't even surprised anymore. He wasn't mad at Albus, he blamed himself, "I would say I'm a worse parent still."
When he set them down on the table, Harry thanked him. "So what brings you two here?" Aberforth asks.
James was really upset by this, he loved and got along well with both his father and his mother and didn't want them to split. His life was perfect, and this was going to destroy everything. Then he remembered his siblings and knew that this wasn't just about him and decided he was going to be tough to help them get through this.
Molly Weasley put down yesterday's Daily Prophet on the table. She looked over at the clock on the wall and saw her daughter arriving at the house. Ginny walked in the door. She seemed to be holding up ok. Molly decided today she was going to get the whole story of why they divorced because her daughter had been so vague with her before. Ginny looked fine, but Molly was going to be careful, she didn't want to hurt her daughter at a time like this.
Harry apperated to Ron and Hermione's house after work. Inside was Mrs. and Mrs. Weasley, Ron, Hermione and surpirsingly George. George, Harry had already spoken too, and while he wasn't happy about the whole situation, he didn't seem to be taking it out on Harry. Bill, Percy, and Charlie - has had heard through Ron - were very protective of their little sister, and not knowing at all what happened, were completely blaming Harry. Harry was thankful they weren't here right now. He was thinking he was probably going to have to come out to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, and he wasn't sure if he could have done that with the whole family here.
Harry was very anxious to see Albus, as he still seemed to be angry with Harry. Albus hadn't spoken to him since he and Ginny went to Hogwarts and Albus screamed at him that everything was Harry's fault. But as Albus's face came into clear view, it didn't seem to be one of anger, actually when he saw his father, Albus started to jog, then sprit towards him.
"Isn't it a bit sexist that we're all loundging around while the women are in the kitchen?" Bill asked turning to the rest of the men.
"Oh, Harry." Ginny was a bit annoyed that Harry could be as stupid as to go to Hogsmeade on a Hogwarts weekend, but she also felt bad. She knew Harry wasn't really ready to explain to the kids and when he did, he wanted to do it on his own terms. He'd lost that now; she knew they would have to tell James and Lily now.
But the Weasleys seemed to accept even more than he could that he didn't want to split up his young family, since he told them he hadn't really figured it out until after James was born, and still didn't accept it for years after, which was true. Molly apparently had spoken to her older sons, as per Harry's request she didn't mention his sexuality, but she told them they ought to forgive him. Harry hadn't seen any of them since, but he did make his way down to Diagon Alley one day to see George and Ron at Weasley Wizarding Wheezes.
"Is it true you are dating Draco Malfoy?" one reporter yells over all the rest. Harry had yet avoided bringing up Malfoy; he didn't think it was his place to confirm that Draco was gay. "Uh..." Harry just said and then in the crowd he saw people moving and shoving around. Right in the middle of that, coming towards the stage, he sees Draco. Harry just stares, watching his love coming towards him.
Draco looked to Harry, silently asking him with his eyes if he would take the question for him, but Harry just gave him a look of "no, you," so Draco sighed, "Uhhh..." all thirteen pairs of eyes on him, "We met up by chance at the Leaky Coudern one day." Draco began, and he told the story of their love from that day to the Hogwarts visit (skipping a few details) to the day they were caught by their sons. Not much time had past since then but still everyone laughed and chuckled except Harry. When Draco saw Harry's eyes down towards his plate, he regretted saying it, but as Harry turned back to Draco, he smiled again.
Draco wrote to him, asking him to come over, but Harry wrote back saying he was too busy with work. It pained Harry to lie to him; he still loved Draco. Just a few days ago he had told him that and everything seemed prefect, and now it all had come crashing down.
Harry looked to Ginny and Ginny looked at him. They knew that the kids were probably going to ask at some point, but they hadn't really planned an answer. They both agreed that there was no reason to tell them about Ginny's night with Dean. Harry hadn't made up his mind if he was going to come out to his kids yet, but seeing all their faces staring up at him, he knew he owed them the truth and it was time. He looked to Ginny and gave her a small nod, she understood.
"Alright, I think. She seems to be taking dad being in Azkaban pretty well actually. Like she's finally free of him. We both are, in a way, but I still don't wish he was there."
Ron later told him how he had returned home early to find the note and went straight to Professor McGonagall's headmistress's office through the fireplace. He quickly told her what was happening and to get Hermione while Ron ran faster than he had in his entire life down to the forest.
Harry and Draco disapparated together back to Harry's apartment after dinner with the Weasleys. This was the first time they were alone since the press conference, and really, since that day in Hogsmeade.
After Jame's quidditch career he went on to be a Auror, as did Lily. Albus, however, went on to become a healer, as did Scorpius who ended up marrying Rose. All the kids married and had their own kids, and lived happy lives.
Right after Harry's birthday, which they spent in L.A., they headed back home, which was now Hogwarts. Harry's lease in his apartment had ended and he had moved out before they left on their trip. He still had Grimland place. Draco even sold his house, saying their was too many memories of Astoria there. All of their things were currently at Malfoy Manor. Scorpius now had a room set up there, but Harry and Draco's things were still in boxes waiting to be moved to their new room at Hogwarts.
He didn't want to believe it. Draco seemed so trustworthy. They were friends and after yesterday... Harry didn't know what they were.
"Yes... and no. You hated each other too much to truly be enemies. You blamed him for everything. Well, he was always looking to get you in trouble as well. But you seemed to go out of your way to pick fights with him and you were always talking about him– heard you in the hallways constantly. And I would catch Malfoy talking about you too to his friends. Even though it was about how much you each hated the other, you two were just too...
Albus was in shock, "You knew your dad was gay?!" he said in a loud whisper, there was no one around them but still, "What about your mother?"
"Are you sure? They are finding out I'm gay and dating Draco Malfoy. Do they really need to hear that you're dating their teacher?"
"This isn't your fault mom! It's dad's!" Albus bursts out, "He was the one who decided it was a good idea to date my BEST FREIND'S DAD!" he said turning to his dad, "I DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE GAY!"
"So Harry," Bill said turning to Harry, "Great job. I got mom's owl in time for us to listen to it on the radio." Then he turned to Draco. Draco got a bit nervous; he knew of, but had never met, this Weasley. But then Bill turned back to Harry before asking, "So how long have you guys been a thing?"
Hermione didn't know what to say. Ron was her husband and Harry was her best friend; she hated when they fought. She knew Ron was being a little irrational when he didn't even know what happened yet, but she also understood how he felt. She didn't say anything for the time being, knowing Ron needed to just get it all out.
"No, honey, it wasn't like that. I didn't know. It took me a long time to figure it out." Harry said, but he was disappointed in himself.
"I don't know what to do, Ginny." Harry said to his ex-wife one night. He had come over to her house to talk, "They might fire me! Everyone seems to think it's a possibility. What about the kids!?"
"I saw you dad!" Well that answered that question. Scorpius stood silently behind Albus looking to his father.
Draco looked to Hermione standing with Ron, and knew that was where he had to start. Draco felt quite nervous, and hoped he would be able to get it out before she punched him again or Ron tried to make him eat slugs again - this time he was quite sure Ron would be able to do it. But just then Molly pulled Hermione into the kitchen with her to help prepare dinner.
"Ok. Good, 'cuz that would be weird." They all laughed as if they were still just three kids in their first year of Hogwarts again; but they had always been different, they never had normal lives... and it was looking like they never would.
"Oh no, I should go Neville." Harry cut him off,  "Sorry. I don't really want to run into the kids by surprise!" Harry said as he rushed back towards Draco.
Harry silently looked to his feet. The Weasleys, along with most of his friends, still didn't care for Draco that much. Not only had he been so mean to all of them at school, but he was also a Deatheater, they had not forgotten that. But maybe Ginny would be ok with it, she never seemed to have a problem with Albus being friends with Scorpius. Either way, Harry had to tell her.
, but had used the other two. He does have depression, PTSD, and he did try to kill himself all those years ago. It was something Harry still didn't like to think or talk about, and now the whole wizarding world knew.
"Haven't stopped by the store in a while, Harry." said George, "You should come by sometime and see all the new stuff me and Ron have been working on."
Draco took them to his door. He could see the lights of a town not too far away. "Come on." Harry said pulling Draco towards the town.
"I know! I just wish things had gone differently sometimes." Draco admitted. He couldn't help but think that was his fault.
"Gay?" Minerva guessed, "No, I didn't. Not for sure at least; he never told me." That made Harry feel a bit better, at least he wasn't the only one that didn't know. "But I had my suspicions." Minerva continued, "Never had much interest in women, Albus."
"Eh, haven't been doing much. With my wife gone and Scorpius at school I'm all alone in the house. I see mother sometimes."
There is silence before Albus finally finds his voice, "You're ok though dad. Right? You're not gonna... you'd never...?
"I did! I did!" Ginny cried over and over. She didn't understand why she was crying, she was mad at herself, she felt guilty even though Harry wasn't upset; he forgave her. She deserved worse for what she did. She blamed herself because she was the one who got herself drunk that night, without anyone there to help. She sniffled and continued on...
"Is it bad?" Lily asked, still seeming more worried about her father than annoyed with her brother like James was.
He got an owl from Hermione telling him to come by her and Ron's place that night for dinner. That she needed to talk to him.
Harry had stepped into that. Harry and Ginny looked at each other and silently communicated what they were about to tell the kids. It wasn't the reason they divorced, but it was true. And it was going to be almost as hard as telling them his sexuality.
He was walking through the forbidden forest at night with his wand tip lit. The same path he had taken a year ago, but this time he seemed to reach the clearing must faster. In his pocket, just a small vial of poison.
"No, it's ok Lily, both of you," Harry looked from his daughter to his son,  "You were right. I should have been brave a long time ago, but I have to say I'm glad I wasn't. Otherwise I wouldn't have either of you." He kissed both his kids and neither protested.
Arthur got up to give his son a hug too, and then followed Molly into the kitchen saying, "I'd better go help now before I get yelled at."
"YES!" Draco shouted, cutting him off. Harry had opened the box to show Draco an emerald and ruby entwined on a white gold ring. People now were looking to the couple, trying to figure out what was going on.
Harry and his two kids hugged and talked for a while. James and Lily told Harry that they had written to their mom as well. James felt a lot better now that both of his parents forgave him, and now that he had forgiven both of them.
By the next morning, Albus still hadn't spoken to Scorpius. Scorpius tried to talk to him when he came into the dormitory the prior evening, but Albus pretended to be asleep. Albus got up early and went to breakfast. He was nearly finished eating when he saw his Gryffindor brother and sister come into the hall. An owl swooped down and dropped them a letter. He saw them reading it from across the hall and then they both started coming his way.
Harry pulled Draco into the door on his right. As they entered, neither of them recognized the room. It had a couch and chairs in a living room like area, and a canopy bed towards the right wall.
"Only by a few inches!" said Albus. "Plus I don't want to stay in your room, and I don't want you in mine either!"
Harry and Draco slept at Hogwarts every night while they were teaching. It took a little while for the kids to ajust to having pretty much three parents as teachers, but Albus and Lily couldn't help but loved their father's lessons, and Draco was a surprisingly good teacher.
"They both told me before she pasted that their marriage was more of an arrangement that worked well for both of them. They cared for each other; they just weren't in love, but they loved me. I guess it's weird, but I don't really remember a time when I thought they were in love." Scorpius just shrugs.
Harry chuckled too, "Ya... well. You know..." everyone chatted happily but Draco didn't join in, he just sat there listening. Then the door opened a second time. In walked Percy and his wife Audrey.
He thought back to everything that lead to this moment. From his childhood at the Dursleys, to his time at Hogwarts to walking into the forbidden forest to die (twice), he never could have imagined how happy he could be. He knew his parents must be smiling down. Harry hoped they would have accepted his sexuality, although he never really knew them, he couldn't imagine them not wanting him to be happy like this.
The second day after the press conference and family dinner, Draco was still staying at Harry's apartment. I was weird for Harry not to have to go to work in the mornings now that he had officially left his job, but it was really nice just being able to spend time with Draco.
A few minutes later, Charlie walked in. "Hey mom!" he called out. Again, Molly rushed in to hug and kiss her son, this time taking a bit longer because she doesn't see Charlie as often as the others. "Well I had to come see Harry!" he said once his mom let go. His mom looked angry, "And I wanted to see you too, mum!" Mrs. Weasley stopped pouting.
am here on school board business." This wasn't really true. Draco knew Harry was going to be here today because Scorpius had mentioned in a letter home that Albus had gotten a letter that said Harry was coming to Hogwarts today. Draco wanted to see Harry again, but he had wanted it to look like an accident. He couldn't go to Harry, what if Harry just rejected him? Told him there was too much bad history, he could be friends, but never lovers. After all this time, that would be Draco's worst nightmare.
