“You look like a vision. But I don’t want you perfect... I want you broken with lust, wanton and begging. This comes off first,” said Harry, unhooking Draco’s bra and dropping it to the side of the bed. “You’ve got exquisite breasts,” he murmured, kissing Draco’s nipples, lavishing his front with his tongue, whilst pinching the other lightly with his fingertips. “You’re like a piece of art...”
Harry looked on aghast at Draco’s tears, his heart shattering more with everyone that rolled down his lover’s long, aristocratic face. The truth was, as much as Harry loved and wanted Draco, he could never tell him to give up his life and everything he knew. That wasn’t the alpha he knew himself to be. Not in his heart, anyway.
Draco was soon beside him once more, and they headed out to get into the Uber Harry has booked. They were going to Fratellis, an ice cream parlour that Harry knew Lyra loved.
She got into the bathroom, her body already hot with need. She took off her beautiful silk nightdress, and then her underwear. Her breasts were heavy with milk for her baby, her body chubbier and curvier, but she felt so hot at the moment, she didn't care.
When Draco arrived, she understood what he meant. She left to Harry to do everything, and was surprised by the amount of stuff there was on their tray when they sat down on a table to eat.
The touch of the omega’s hand was surprisingly warm, his fingers long and lithe, the fingernails immaculate, as they entangled with his. Maybe Harry felt himself hold for a second longer than was polite; maybe not. He couldn’t be sure. But he did know that there was no future with
As she washed, she realised her body was less bloated, she felt less like the deflated balloon she was feeling like a week ago, but she still was too strange for her tastes. She didn't feel like herself. She was ashamed and didn't want Harry to see her in this state.
“But right now, love, it’s time to think about meeting Lyra.” Harry smiled. “But you’re covered in massage oil. Shower?”
Harry laughed, cupping Draco’s face in his hand, and learning in to kiss her face.
“Just because we’re together it doesn’t mean that you not still a part of your family. Just remember Draco, this is all really new to them. They might feel like they’ve lost you because you’ve stood up to them. But it’s really early days, baby. Let me get your shoes, and your coat. You might be a Potter now, but your Malfoy heritage is still a part of you.”
It was his mother.
Draco wasn't perfect. Oh, he knew he wasn't. But between his many faults, there was one that was worse than all of the others. When he wanted to hurt, he pushed his fingers way,
He moved to the bathroom so he could have a shower and prepare for the day. He was resolved to go on with his plan, but he was getting cold feet. What if someone found out about what he was going to do? Something he has been doing for a while, but much more subtly. As he went on with his routine, he kept thinking and thinking. It wasn’t illegal, but it would give him freedom if he ever needed it. And he was thinking that maybe he would.
“Sometimes I think you should've let me die in that fire.”
He kissed Harry as hard as he got, holding Harry with all his strength then turning the alpha with his stomach up. Draco took off his silk shirt, and practically broke his bra's clasp with the fury he took it off. He straddled Harry after taking his bottom clothes off. He licked his lips and bit down the side of Harry's neck, pointy teeth drawing blood inside his mouth.
Draco got his wish rather sooner than even he had dreamed.
Harry held Draco, close, sticky and intimate. He’d never slept soundly before living with Draco but now in his happiness Harry found his body was relaxed, comfortable in their life together.
and his
As they got apart, Draco sighed, trying not to cry. His heat was on its end, and it left him extremely sentimental.
“Before you even start on the jeans, Draco, there’re vintage. I think. And the leather jacket belonged to Sirius so it’s practically a family heirloom. I’m keeping it safe for the worm to wear when they’re bigger.”
There were many fruits all over: cashews, acerola berries, a type of small berry that the locals called 'sirigoela' or something close to this, and many others. Draco was trying to find those Açai berries that got famous in the UK, but she could only find a fruit that looked a bit like it at first, something called
After a week, it was time for Harry to bring his wife and new baby back home.
While the adults had a nice conversation at the park, Chloe and Iris played on the sand box, laughing and digging while big sister Lyra took care of them. Draco was always surprised when he remembered that cute little girl he met years ago was now eleven, and she was slowly turning into a very beautiful lady, her long curly hair in a ponytail, green eyes exactly like Harry's always looking smart and way too wise for a pre-teen. Soon, she would present and Draco was sure both Harry and Blaise would be way too protective over her. Thankfully, baby Chloe and Iris were too young for them to worry about it.
But Harry didn’t hesitate. It was like another wizard had taken control of his body, his muscle memory reacting to the threat to his family. Without even thinking, Harry seized hold of his wand, and he fired off a
give up everything for you... But... Do you know that in our constitution there is still a law that says that
he liked, and turn himself back too! Now, I want you to close your eyes”, he continued, running a finger over her flickering, tired eyelids “and imagine all the animals you are going to become when you go to Hogwarts when you’re a big girl... I love you baby. Sweet dreams darling... The puppy will be here so, so soon.”
"Draco, my young boy, I heard about what happened to you!" He said, and Draco lowered his eyes. It was only Monday and the news were already spreading. "It was with great sadness that we discovered today in the morning that our arrangements with the Malfoy company had... changed. And not for the best, may I say. I called young Nott's office this morning to cancel our agreement with the company since it no longer served us, with the new arrangements and all."
“I never said
When Draco came out of the back room, Elijah waved at him, before continuing to make the list of magical plants, flowers and muggle flowers and herbs this customer was requesting. Elijah did as he was trained, repeating each item as he wrote it down, to ensure he had heard correctly and to help Draco get an idea of what they were working with without having to take over Firecall from the apprentice. The list seemed rather normal at first and Draco was nodding happily at the list, rubbing his hands together, eager to get to work creating a brilliant bouquet.
So Harry did, all at once, pushing his three fingers in with a deep assailing plunge forward. He used his weight to bare down his husband, holding him still so it would be over more quickly.
Finally closing the kid, he went to the sofa. Hopefully, Harry would finish his bath soon and they'd cuddle while Draco felt amazing with his warm lover and delicious food.
There was certainly never any gossip about Draco. No rumours of a mate, or even any sort of partner. Not like Harry, with his chequered past. A single father? Tick. A partner who’d left him? Tick. A broken heart? Tick.
. It was like he didn't care if Narcissa noticed it. And it was okay. Draco couldn't help the smile on his mouth, even though he tried to make it smaller than it wanted to be, and looked up to Harry for a second.
“Every day, if you want Draco. Every day, I’ll fuck you, and I will fucking love it. You’re already bigger than you were, and soon you won’t be able to hide it from the world... Everyday you’ll be rounder, filling up with our baby, and I’ll be watching you and my cock will be so hard, because you’ll always be so sexy... And your breasts will fill, and they’ll be so sensitive you’ll cry. And later, when I’m fucking you, you’ll find your breasts leaking, milk dripping  from your swollen nipples but don’t worry, I’ll lick you clean. I filled you up with our baby, Draco, shagged our baby into you, but I’ll make sure you’re satisfied every single time you’re desperate... And when you’re so big you can’t even touch yourself anymore, I’ll give you lots of orgasms...”
“I... Being honest, Harry, I don't really know. I'm very overwhelmed right now, my feelings are really confused. I'm sure we'll be great. You'll be, at least. And I'll try. I'll try not to spoil them rotten.”
“Harry... Hnn... How can you do this to me...?”
But that wasn’t the case.
Draco dreaded the weekends. He liked it because he was slightly free from work - slightly because he'd still receive calls and e-mails and messages all the time - but at least he could sleep until he wanted to wake up. The bad part was having dinner with his parents. They'd be happy with his work on the company, but then his mother would ask, politely with a small smile: "what about an alpha? Have you met a good one these days?" to what he'd reply "No, mother, I've been just working".
Harry focussed his magic as hard as he could. He’d left his wand in the lounge and casting wandless was a challenge at the best of times.
! When she opened her eyes, there was absolutely nothing around. There was a highway in the middle of nowhere, and a big field of small, retorted and dangerous-like trees and bushes.
In one quick movement, Harry grabbed Draco by the hip and flipped him over. Pulling his lover’s legs abruptly apart, Harry lapped at Draco’s arsehole, rimming him quickly and deeply. The warmth, the tightness was such a rush, and Harry’s giant cock was leaking and ready...
He looked at the others, continuing the meeting.
“Well, that’s perfect,” Harry grinned. “I’ll text Ginny in a minute, it’s my day to take Lyra and she’s been excited to meet you again. She can meet us in the West-End, we’ll go to one of those Italian places where you can get the big knicker-bocker glories. In fact, I’m more excited than she’ll ever be.”
“I needed you; You made me go away. You took my daughter and made me go away. Do you think I'm not capable enough to be with my child? I'm sorry I couldn't protect her today! I know I'm a shite parent! But the least you could do was to be with me once we get home, hun? When I'm scared and guilty and thinking I'm not good enough as a mother, as a wife, even as a woman! That woman told me I was faking myself! That I was the same old Draco Malfoy in girl’s clothes! I know I don't deserve you! I've always known! But you don't need to shove it on my face and take my baby away from me!”
“If you want me gone, at least let me see her!”
that it was crazy her train of thoughts, but scared, vulnerable and PTSD Draco thought it was reasonable that Harry would try to get Jasmine and kick Draco out of his life.
Well, Draco wanted. He wanted something. Every time he felt that Harry was aroused because of him, he wanted to give in. Touching him in any way would ease that need.
happy for them. They’d be wonderful, loving parents and their baby would be the luckiest child in the world.
“Ummmm... You’re lovely and clean, now omega. But I need to check every inch of you,” Harry explained as he slid his body ever closer, reaching down under the waterline to seize Draco’s beautiful, perfect cock.
Draco had a full on smile now, and he nodded, even though the old alpha couldn't see it.
Harry sighed, stroking the side of Draco’s smooth, chiselled features. “But me? I’m not the most exciting man, love. I read, walk and spend time with my daughter. It’s a quiet life, but it’s good. Really, you say you want to know more, but truly all you’ll find out is that I’m not worthy of you... Draco, you’re like a shining star. I’m blinded by you.”
he could stop. He knew. But something inside him just urged him to go, and go, and go. He sat over Harry’s hard cock, his whole body trembling with desire.
Harry thought Draco looked especially beautiful tonight. He wasn’t expecting his boyfriend to have worn the full, traditional omega garb, but he had to admit that it really suited him. Harry was wearing a lightweight suit, with a navy suit and tie. He hoped he looked even half as good as his omega.
How could he imagine that Harry would have the same kinks as he did? It was so filthy, and at the same time so completely hot. I was just amazing that Draco could feel that under Harry's hands.
“I'm so sorry, Harry,” she mumbled, tears falling down her cheeks. “I was so mean to you, I didn't mean to... Please, forgive me! I'm sorry, I just--” she couldn't go on. She started to sob, tears washing her face as she run to him, pleading for forgiveness.
It was
Harry stroked the soft curves of Draco’s breasts under his hands. He couldn’t believe that this perfectly formed, entirely beautiful individual would sell himself as short as he was doing.
~Harry
Leaning his back against the back of the shower Harry got his stance comfortable and gave Draco as much space as he could.
Finding Draco’s neck, he kissed him warmly and purposefully. He wanted to show his husband that their intimacy didn’t have to start in their bedroom. After checking that nobody was looking, Harry found the hem of Draco’s shirt, tracing lines on the soft, satiny skin of his sides and stomach. He wanted to find his pliable, warm little breasts, but worried if anyone saw Draco might be embarrassed.
“Come here”, he said to the man in front of him, pulling him into a hug. “You haven’t been sad all day, because it’s not over yet. We’ve got plenty of time. You’ve got me forever now, and this is just the first day...” Harry kissed his husband slowly and purposely, before he continued.
Draco put her hands on Harry's thighs for leverage, bobbing her head back and forth, swallowing as much as she could of his thick cock. Her jaw started to hurt, but as she licked around the head and felt the tip nudging her throat, she felt so hot that she needed to keep going.
Turning around, Harry got up and went back to the bathroom.
“Shush,” Harry whispered, kissing a line over Draco’s shoulder, holding his body tight to his. “I’m going to make you come so hard, here in your green fucking bedroom, like you fucking wet-dreamed when you were fourteen...”
“Okay, love,” Harry smiled, as he looked Draco in the face, wondering at just how such an innocent young man could have risen to be such a powerful figure in business. “Vaseline is absolutely fine, baby. You go and get that and I’ll be here waiting.”
And every morning Harry would wake up hard, so hard for his husband. They’d have sleepy morning sex until Harry was despatched to make the morning coffees and buy pastries.
“We’ll have the ice cream, with the banana, silly. We always have a banana split here. Daddy and me have been coming here forever, ever since I was little,” Lyra stopped for a moment to drink from her cup before continuing. “I’ve been hoping daddy would get a new friend like you, ever since mummy got married... I don’t like daddy being alone every night, it makes me feel sad. But you should tell him, Mister. Malfoy, that he
“I thought we’d review the papers in the ride over,” he began, trying to act the professional. “I’m not convinced my predecessor was offering Ollivanders the best value for their fees. I think we can do.... I’m interested in their supply-chain management. I think we can get the operation really slick-“
Harry was besotted with this new, confident Draco.
. He was proud to have Draco beside him, and he’d be proud to show him to Lyra too. Harry really hoped Draco would like her so much he’d change his mind about having babies, even if it meant losing him to the rich old alpha his parents wanted him to marry.... even if the thought of Draco with someone else turned his stomach.
“Do you plan to have me and Jasmine attached to your ankles?” Draco smiled a little, tired, as she decided to straddle his lap and hide her face on his neck. She knew Harry liked to be alone when sad, but she needed someone at her side. She needed someone to talk to, someone to be close. It wasn't weird that she resorted to be friends with a ghost when she needed desperately for friendship.
He even forgot the tea he was making. Well, it was dead cold now. No need to worry about it anymore.
-x-x-
child to put her to bed while you had a bath... Now, we
He drove his hips forward, thrusting with all his might as Draco flooded their joined bodies with his delicious slick. He was bearing down, bucking deeply into the other man when he came, an explosion of heat and wetness that had him groaning. It felt like an out of body experience, but Harry knew it was all too real.
“Do you like it?” he asked, unsure.
His orgasm was building by the second, his cock rigid and tight with need. He bore down hard onto Draco, full of need, full of want. Every part of his body was tingling, coiling, electrified with the moment...
He pulled Draco to him, holding him tightly. He wanted him to know he’d always be safe with Harry.
And then he was there, panting, swearing and coming for Draco, his husband, and whether a man or a woman,
Harry went to the kitchen, glad to give his hands something to do. His hands were trembling, and he’d noticed he was rambling a little bit.
“Please, Harry,” Draco repeated, his voice louder this time. He rolled his hips, beseeching. “Please, love. Please, fuck me.”
“I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about breeding with you. Knotting you and filling you with my seed. You’d be a great dad, Draco. Brilliant with kids. I can see that already, and in another life I’d love to share that with you... But you
Draco moaned with Harry's mouth on him, his whole body trembling with the pleasure of being sucked. He didn't know much about food play, but he was in the process of understanding if he liked it or not.
"I love you, too. You've made me so happy, Harry, you have no idea. I know I'm an emotional mess right now, and it will take me a while to come back to the brat I know I am," Draco's voice was hoarse, but slowly coming to his assured boss tone. He smiled a little as he said that, biting on his bottom lip before continuing. "But, if given the choice to come back in time, I think I'd do it all over again."
Draco moaned at the touch, having to hold on to Harry's shoulder so he wouldn't fall down. He never felt this before, and it seemed like his whole body was about to explode.
“Help me take it off,” Draco asked, since his legs were under Harry and he couldn’t take his jeans off. “And take off yours too. Too many clothes here.”
While the majority of the magical community lived here in the Square of the Middle of the World, (It was all-wizard, like Hogsmeade) many magical people lived in Recife, Salvador, on the Amazonian rainforest and a small city called Petropolis. It all looked gorgeous, Harry thought, lots of historical buildings and beaches. He resolved to wait for Draco and ask her where she wanted to go. He wanted her to be as utterly relaxed as possible.
Harry felt quite bereft as he flooed home away from his daughter and wife. Still, he consoled himself, in a few days he’d be able to bring both of them home forever.
Harry’s nipples were hard too, his shirt agony against them as he kissed back, exploring every part of his lover’s mouth with his own. Pulling away from the kiss, he pulled his shirt over his head.
He wasn't living on the Manor, now. Not anymore. He and his mother moved to a smaller, cosier house. It was still big and beautiful, like all Malfoy states, but this one was his mother's only, and it looked pretty feminine and floral, with light pink walls and golden details. His father never liked it much, but being in Azkaban, he had no saying in it. Draco loved it. His bedroom had huge windows and he had an amazing view of his mother's garden.
?!" Draco almost screamed, and his father showed him some printed pictures... of him and Harry kissing on the company's kitchen.
The two chocolate tortes sat, on silver platters, waiting for their attention on the table on their room.
Draco waited, but then he got impatient waiting for Harry and just walked to the bathroom. He didn't want to leave his mind wandering, he knew he needed to move so his mind wouldn't play tricks on him.
He couldn’t believe how sweet it all tasted and how happy the small weight of it between his lips made him.  His body felt warm and satisfied, his own cock already wet with anticipation.
Shaking his head, Harry tried to force his mind back into the moment.
Draco kissed him on the lips, closing his eyes and whispering.
That would make them real, and he couldn’t face that reality yet.
Picking Draco up easily by her hips, it was as if his wife weighed nothing. His cock was full, hard and curved towards his midriff.
"I know we're supposed to have a meeting some days from now, but I wanted to see if you were accommodated," Draco entered the office, looking at Potter. He was a little rough around the edges, tired eyes and seemed annoyed. Draco's first instinct was to ask him if he was disturbing him, but he didn't want his omega submission to show
Draco was going to complain about being picked up like a princess, but, being honest, he didn't really mind that much. He felt his cheeks burn a little with Harry's words, but he didn't have any energy to reply to that. At least, not yet. He waited as he was put in the bath, and sighed with how delicious the water was around him.
“And of course I’d love you to meet Lyra. She’s incredible. Cheeky and forthright. A bit like you really. She meets everyone that I care about. She’s with her mum most of the time, my ex Ginny, but we have a good relationship. You’ll get twenty questions Draco, though.”
Pulling away, Harry stroked Draco lightly on his sides, moving his head down to kiss the flat plains of Draco’s tummy. He circled his bellybutton with small sucks and bites, his body alive with passion and need.
“Now, Harry... Now you can do it.”
They held each other close, the rest of the world forgotten in the bubble of love that held them tight. Harry never wanted to eat Draco go.
“I’m going to take you to bed now, lay you down and take care of you. What would make you happiest, my love?”
“Oh Lyra,” said Harry, his voice breaking under the surge of emotions he felt, “that wasn’t the problem, baby.  Draco has a very old-fashioned family and they like to make sure he lives his life according to their rules. But it doesn’t matter to me if you’re an alpha or an omega, darling. I’ll love and treat you the same whatever you present as.”
to be touched there. His nipples were sensitive and tender, and he just couldn't wait. His left hand went between his legs, and soon he was coming, and coming, and coming.
Harry fellated Draco through his orgasm, enjoying how well the omega was taking his pleasure. He swallowed all of Draco’s come, and was delighted by how perfect he tasted.
Draco smiled with Harry's words, feeling comfortable and complete. He wasn't completely happy. He still loved his family, specially his mother, but he knew he couldn't be happy without Harry in his life.
“Mr. Malfoy is the victim of Obliviation and the effects of a family curse. Mr. Malfoy remembers nothing of the past five years. “
But soon they’d ran out of bread, and Jasmine wanted to go down the slide. Harry though this was a splendid idea, so they walked over to the play park and waited for the slide. Sure enough, it was a thrill, and Jasmine squealed as they raced to the bottom. They went on the swings, the roundabout and the climbing frame, and by the end even Harry was feeling ready for their lunch.
He held the swell of Draco’s belly in his hand as he kissed her all over. Her body was changing every day, and it was just the most erotic experience of his life.
"Harry,
, silly old wives tales about soulmates predestined from birth. Harry wasn’t a fool; it wasn’t fate. It was biological. Some couples were simply, perfectly compatible.
Lyra pouted and looked at Draco. “Well, I do hope that you
me. That was all I ever wanted. Love and commitment forever. I’m a proper alpha, I suppose. Looking for a partner and babies. She knew we weren’t right for each other. Draco... We broke up because I asked her to
"But I love that you thought of it... You're the best alpha in the world."
Ginny and Blaise were having a baby, and had told Lyra- and now Harry. A new brother for his daughter, and further evidence that families were for everybody except Harry. He’d been polite and pleased of course, but inside he didn’t know how to feel.
“I guess we have to get ready if we want to catch our portkey,” Draco said after they were finished, his cheeks still burning a little. “You'll stay here for a couple of days still, right, Mother? I want you to enjoy it the most you can.”
“I'll miss here when we go back to England,” he said, drinking some of his water and letting a little bit fall by his chin. He didn't make a move to wipe it.  “It's so sad to think we are coming back tomorrow night. And we didn't even properly fuck on that bed. I kept imagining us doing it, you know? You pounding on me so hard we'd wake up the next door's neighbours and they'd scream at us, but then we wouldn't care because we'd be coming so hard.”
Harry hushed his voice as his toast arrived, and Draco’s omelette. “But a night out in London sounds super. What do you suggest?”
“Harry, wait... It needs more than this. You're not exactly peanut sized like me, are you?” Draco joked a bit, trying not to destroy the mood. He touched Harry's hip with one of his feet, creating a gap between them. He looked around for his wand, summoning it wandlessly as it was far from them. As soon as he felt the wood touch his palm, he directed the tip between them, turning to his arse, and murmured a lubing and opening spell. Now, it would maybe hurt a little still, but it wouldn't be excruciating pain as it would be before.
He was definitely close; his Magic was sparking off his skin and he could feel their bond in a tight ring around his heart.
“Draco,” he said, carefully “I’m not the Alpha that you threw water into. I’m not a liar and I don’t
Draco was unstoppable all the rest of the week. He was arriving earlier and going out of the company later, inspecting as many reports as he could. Throughout the days, he was constantly seen with a phone on his ear, talking to whoever businessperson he needed talking to.
!" Draco almost spat the words, looking angrily at Nott who had a smug smile on his face, as if he knew that Draco would fight, but in the end, he would obey his family.
-x-x-x-
Draco was in the room too, and his lover looked extremely cheerful as he proudly presented some rather
“I’ll show you your place, Draco,” Harry moaned, pulling away from his boyfriend’s perfectly slick pink arse. “Your place is with me, beside me. You can be my boss when we’re at work, but here you’re mine. Only mine.”
With these words Harry himself coming, deep and satisfied in Draco’s slick hot cunt. He gasped, pulling his husband close.
Draco decided to come back to Harry's page, looking out for Lyra. He found a good amount of photos of her. She was such an adorable girl, with tanned skin, bright green eyes and brown, curly hair. Draco fell immediately in love with her, and liked all their photos together, even one from many years ago when Lyra was about three.
See you at the wedding.
Harry hadn’t needed any help with his cock. He woke up half hard every morning as it was, and the extra stimulation of the most gorgeous man he’d ever seen had filled his prick out completely.
His cheeks were pink with desire, nipples already peaking inside the lace, knickers getting soaked. Harry was going to be the death of him.
It was decidedly different from all the people he had done this before - Harry included, after one game he fell open legged on the broom and Draco was sure Potter has gone infertile, which was proven to not be true and Harry was fine.
Locating their favoured ice-cream and chocolate, Harry and Draco were back at home before they knew it. Before they could get in the door, though, Harry moved over to his husband.
"I'm sorry, Harry. I've always been wealthy, so I can't really understand what it is to be poor... But I've known suffering and I know how it can destroy a childhood. I'm happy you've grown into an amazing man..."
He kissed the shell of his husband’s ear, and gave his earlobe a tentative bite. His fingers continued to stroke Draco’s round little breasts, enjoying their softness, the way they dipped under his fingertips.
His legs spreaded the most he could, and he grabbed his thighs to leave them open just for Harry. He could feel his body gushing out pleasure; he could feel it burning and the orgasm sensation building.
On that day, she was changing Jasmine onto a unicorn onesie. Molly finally got her wish and was staying with Jasmine overnight. Living alone, the matriarch was feeling that her house was too big for only two people, and wanted some baby company for a while. Draco took some time getting convinced to it, but in the end, she gave in.
"I live near the company, in the Bright Sun Residence Hotel. Is it far from you? Can you come here now? I need you."
It came to him like a wave crashing. The pleasure of his orgasm was so big that he lost his conscience for a moment, and all there was, was Harry. His cunt was holding on to Harry's cock with a furious grip, contracting around it, as he came and never stopped coming.
“Ummm, that sounds delicious, Draco,” said Harry, nearly growling in anticipation. “Don’t know how I’m going to be able to focus all afternoon when I’ve got you to look forward to tonight.”
Harry closed his eyes, revelling in the ravishing, sexy omega giving him such a wonderful time. Even though he knew they were on borrowed time, and it couldn’t be forever, Harry didn’t want his time with Draco to ever end.
Oh, how wrong he was.
Harry loved the touch of Draco’s thin, elegant fingers on his cock. He was so aware of the other man’s surprise at its size and girth, and despite how excited he felt, he wanted to reassure.
, Harry thought,
very clear. I can't wait to see you and Lyra tomorrow and forget about tonight."
And remember Draco would. It didn't take long for the sensation of being
Draco turned on his heel as he stormed away from the counter, heading for the nursery to tend to some of his kinder magical plants; they always calmed him down. “I will not be Harry Potter’s next conquest. I will be his only or, I will be fine on my own.” Draco grumbled to himself as the door to the nursery opened and Elijah almost ran into him.
Harry threw his arms around Draco’s shoulders, pulling him backwards onto the bed. Nuzzling into his neck, pressing chaste kisses everywhere he could, Harry wanted Draco to know how purely happy he was.
“I didn't!” Draco felt her eyes, watering, her arms holding Jasmine so strong the kid started to whine. “I nev--”
He walked up to Harry's door and knocked. He was trying hard not to cry again. He couldn't cry anymore.
He almost said 'daddy'. Almost. He controlled himself in the last minute.
omega was so wet, dripping and wet with slick. He was nearly out of his body with desire, with want. It was as if their bodies were so aligned, like Draco had been made only to fulfil Harry’s desires.
She sat and cleaned her eyes with her hands, hair messed up over her shoulders. Unconsciously, Draco touched her bump, greeting little Jim good morning.
"If I can, Harry, yes. But I don't know what is going to happen. I can't promise you something I don't know if I'll be able to do. But if I can... If I can, I'm all yours. Always yours."
Dressed in the formal robes so carefully chosen by his beloved, Harry knew it was but a few minutes until Draco and he were presented to each other, and their bonding would begin.
Oliver was devastated, of course, but Harry secretly thought the better team had won. It hardly mattered, because the Brazilian team were some of the funniest and most interesting wizards Harry had met in many years.
“Just exquisite, honestly... I love you. What can I do to you to make you feel better, sweetheart? I just can’t resist you.”
Fumbling with his trousers, Harry had his cock in his hand moments later. Bobbing large and excitedly in front of him, his shaft was red and heavy, already leaking with need. The thick ridge at the base of his cock where his knot would form was already visible, and he moaned, hot from both the omega under his fingertips and the pure sexiness of their illicit relationship.
“Good morning, Mr. Malfoy,” he smirked, pulling out a chair next to Draco. “I’m in the mood for a full English this morning. The beds in this hotel are surprisingly comfortable aren’t they?” Harry flirted, and sipped at the cold orange juice Draco had already poured for the pair of them.
"You tried it until the end because you were weak and couldn't make an alpha son. I don't blame you, Father. I'm grateful for existing. But don't blame
And the idea that they could have a baby... babies... was amazing. A part of him didn’t want to wait, a feral, deep rooted need to rut his baby into his lover’s body washing over him. He knew that Draco was traditional, and Harry would never hurt him, so he could never act on it now... but once this body was offered to up to him after their marriage, he knew he’d not be able to stop.
Harry was so excited that he could hardly walk through the door with Draco before he pushed her to the wall, kissing her passionately.
"Oh, I see. Mr Potter. I should've smelt it when you came with him, all smiley. I'm sure that can be arranged, Draco. Or should I call you Mr. Potter, now?" Ollivander joked, and Draco smiled. "I'd love you to come and see me for an interview first, though, just to keep it professional. You know you've got the job. And I'll be able to piss your father a little bit more."
“I’d be heartbroken Draco. Devastated. But we’ve got each other, and that would always be enough. I’d never pressure you to use a different method to have a family either, because you are more important than having children by any means. If it’s not with you, it’s not with anyone. Have you actually been to the healer about this, Draco? Baby, don’t upset yourself before you actually have answers.”
He hid his face on Harry's chest, holding his arms and trying to breath. How could he go all the way if he was crying with just Harry's fingers?
The pain stopped, as suddenly as it came, but she was sweating and Harry's side of the bed was getting just as wet.
Harry looked at his husband, for the first time actually taking him
"I don't feel like having sex right now, I'm sorry... Can you just take care of me, Harry? I... I need to feel your arms around me. Let me know that I'm not alone and that I have you, now."
“Did you just hear something, love?” Harry asked. Letting go of Draco, he peered out of the kitchen door, but there was nothing to be seen at all.
Draco kept his eyes closed for a while, trying to come back to reality. His body was pleased and his mind blank. When Harry held him, he felt at home, and sighed contently. It was a bit unpleasant to feel their sticky bodies together, but his kiss made him forget about it for a while.
', but Draco smiled and nodded.
Harry’s breathing was shallow, and he was desperate for release. His body was electrified, like it was full to the brim with need for the man in front of him. At the back of his mind he wanted this to be the time, get Draco pregnant with the baby they both wanted. He couldn’t, wouldn’t mention it but he hoped Draco felt the same.
As much as Harry was growing to love Draco, his hunger won out and within a few minutes both were enjoyed the pizza. As he ate, Harry thought how beautiful Draco looked when he was relaxed, happy and enjoying himself. His fiancé spent so much time on his appearance, and how he presented himself to the world, it was a simple pleasure to see him looking so carefree.
what I feel like quite yet... So...”
As he dressed up, he was still thinking, biting his lower lip and almost hurting himself in the process. He got his phone, sat down on the bed and texted the only person he knew would be at his side, no matter what.
Draco couldn't stop crying. He hugged Harry for dear life, clawing his shoulders and wetting his skin. There were just too many feelings in him at that moment. He couldn't understand how Harry could possibly love him, with his past and the possibility of not having a big, amazing family as he'd always dreamed of. He knew Harry wanted a family of his own with all his heart, and he didn't believe when Harry said they both would be enough. It wouldn't. In Draco's head, Harry was just trying to calm him down by saying what he needed to hear.
, that much was obvious. Her face was white, and her mouth was open, but not one sound was emerging. Her fist was fixed on Jasmine, her knuckles were white and she was shaking.
Thank you so much for all you guys that have been here! I'd like to remember, again, that this story came from a roleplay. I'm trying my best to correct any plot holes and mistakes, but something might slip. Thank you for your patience, all!
I’ll bite: I was surprised you wrote that you’ll never be married. Why is that? France has many eligible bachelors that would surely love to slip a ring onto your finger.
"Harry, I
He was really enjoying being watched, having the rapt attention of his husband. He soaped up his muscles, his pecs and his taut little stomach. He was in great shape, and he knew it.
“Brazil?!” Harry muttered, giving Wood, his captain, the best scowl he could manage.
The week passed in a haze. First of all, Draco's period came and he got really grumpy when it happened. Second, he was so used to be near Harry, sending him messages and meeting him after work that he was short on patience every single day. Even Pansy, who was always happy to help him, shut him off for being such a git.
Then she entered the bathroom and locked the door. She took off her hospital clothes and reached for the most important piece in the box - a binder.
“And the collection of Louis Vuitton bags? You truly need seven of the things? I thought you’d cast a Doubling Spell by mistake…”
It was difficult to think with Harry's mouth on him, though. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't say a thing, because his brain was full of the pleasure Harry was giving him.
me, Harry..." Draco closed his eyes, showing off his neck and letting Harry have his way with him. He was all wet and so, so aroused. He needed that, he needed all that Harry was giving to him.
“Feeling romantic today, Potter?” She asked, smiling and giving room so Harry could give her her breakfast. Her mouth watered with the scent of toast and honey. “And yes, please. I can't go to work using your clothes all the time. People will think I'm sloppy. What will you have for breakfast?”
Draco's mind started to run around. He went on with his day on the automatic, smiling and joking around with Ollivander, acting like the proper rich omega he was.
Finally, their wedding day has come.
Draco smiled at that small touch, and turned his head a little so he could properly kiss Harry on the mouth. He wasn't supposed to do that here. People were small minded between muggles, he knew that, but he couldn't care less at that moment.
Harry felt like he was leaving his body when the wet, hot jets filled Draco. All of his vision went white and all of his body burned in pleasure. This was sensual, and Harry felt himself tip over the edge with all the love he felt for the husband - the love of his life - that was there beneath him.
Harry shook his head. He was just too wound up and excited. The hard ridge of his knot was there, throbbing just his skin and his blood ached with need.
“Get on top of me, love. I want to fill every part of you; fill you full of my cock and my baby... Ride me while I suck your breasts”
Draco felt like he was flying, in a cloud of bliss. Harry's hands over him, the alpha's lips on his, his scent... Everything was driving Draco crazy, and he found himself slipping a little on his heels - something that has never happened before. He let the alpha press him against the lift wall, let him kiss him deeply and taste the now gone chapstick.
Harry gave Draco a reassuring smile, and kissed him slowly over the top of his lovely soft lips. The other man looked so unsure and it broke Harry’s heart. “I’m honoured though, that you’d risk it all for me. I’m just your average alpha dad! I couldn’t ever have imagined anyone would want me ever again-”
In this chapter, we have a little bit of food play.
! Mum’s being totally boring about the foods we’re all allowed to eat. How are you? I want to see Draco again, and go out for dinner! I miss his face!”
. He was a
Draco didn't think he'd laugh so hard with Harry. His cheeks were burning and it seemed like they shared a sense of humour - although Harry seemed to refrain a bit more than Draco, that knew his jokes were borderline dark humour.
It didn't stop him from having an over the top libido. Draco constantly felt hot and bothered, and he couldn't help but imagine how would it be with Potter. Holy Fuck, he was needy. He smiled, though, crossing his arms over his chest because he knew his nipples would try to press on his shirt.
Harry paused, wondering how to phrase just what he wanted to say. His husband was skittish, and the last thing Harry wanted was to upset him.
, bitter and sharp in his mouth. Draco looked magnificent, and Harry was rock hard, and leaking with the thought of coming hard in Draco’s arse.
Draco hold himself not to jump in front of his mother with that touch. A shiver went up his body from the point where Harry was touching him, and he felt incredible to know that it was okay. It was okay for Harry to touch him like this because they were married and he wasn't doing anything wrong.
Draco’s cock was small, but wonderfully hard. Harry could fit it all in his mouth easily, and he experimented circulating his tongue all around it. He loved pushing the foreskin down under the head and licking the slit smooth of pre come.
Before he could finish his ice-cream, though,  his phone rang.
They had bottles of potion to give her to help her grow and thrive, and Jasmine’s new bedroom was set up to Draco’s exacting tastes. Not that it mattered; she would be sleeping in a Moses basket in with them for the next few weeks.
“And Nott had no right, no right whatsoever to mention the strength of your scent! There’s gender protection laws in place, and were he the boss rather than you, you could have taken him to a tribunal. He’s got no right! I’d talk to him, Draco, but I know you wouldn’t want that.... Sorry, this is me going all alpha on you.... But I won’t stand anybody speaking to you disrespectfully!”
All in all, he was having the dream start of a marriage. Also, his husband was insatiable.
Harry only knew that their future was in Draco’s hands now, and he hoped desperately that the terrible fears the omega was having would not be realised.
“Would you like me to fill your arse with chocolate and eat it out?” Harry asked boldly, looking Draco straight in the eye.
Without any further ado, Harry picked up Draco and easily carried his lithe, smooth little body back into the bathroom, placing him carefully back in water. Harry shrugged off his shirt, and dropped his trousers to the floor. “I’ve always fantasied about pleasuring a lover in as big a bath tub as you’ve got... Will you let me pleasure you?”
"Well, we have to. Otherwise, Mr. Ollivanders will have a nice chat with my father, and we both know how this is going to be fun. I wish to have a date with you, too, with all the ducks included, but we can't... At least not now. I think we have to do the best with what we can actually have."
“I will fill them, let me check the office and see the damage. You tend to the plants here, and I will call on you if I need assistance. Thank you Elijah.”
“Okay, Draco... Nothing too much. Tell me if it gets too much and I promise I’ll stop-“
“I can't believe the Ministry didn't take this child away from you the moment she was born. I guess it has its perks to have used a love potion on Harry Potter,” the woman looked furious, and Draco stepped back, looking around for Harry, who had disappeared from her eye sight.
She didn't reply for a moment, and he thought that maybe he had scared her to death. She breathed in, though, deeply, before saying:
, since he’d met Draco. They were incredibly compatible, and he’d felt Draco’s scent burning his soul every moment since.
asked, but after two years... Well, it was a long time, and Harry was the first to admit he’d become used to the status quo.
Draco smiled with that little token. He knew he'd be constantly looking at it, and probably would ask Harry to do it again so it wouldn't fade.
Draco's mind was blank save for this very moment. He had his eyes closed, so deep entertained by this activity that he could barely listen to Harry. But his moans would make Draco's skin shiver, his nipples and cock harden. He was so wet he was sure his knickers were ruined, completely ruined.
"Well, Harry, I can't be happy. It's not in my stars and you knew it since the beginning," Draco was angry now, and he had a small sarcastic smile in his lips.
“Well,” Harry smiled. “I can’t be responsible for the breaking of any hearts, can I? There’s not any going back for me either, Draco. Once I’m committed to you, I’m yours, and I will be until the very end of time. I desire, love and adore you.”
Draco turned to Harry, eyes red and puffy.
was her opinion, and Harry had to agree. He texted back to say that he, Iris, Draco, and the bump would all be at the park in an hour’s time.
Harry fed Draco some rice on a cracker and finished off the rest for himself. He hooked a careful finger underneath Draco’s chin and leant over to kiss him. “Very beautiful,” Harry said, smiling. “But your lips are still too cold. I think you’re a little bit in shock.”
-x-x-
“Come and sit with me for a while... I can get a quick shower at home. We’ve got ages before I need to make a move.” Harry steered Draco’s upset form, walking them both towards the living room. He sat on the settee, and motioned for Draco to sit next to him. Flicking through Netflix, Harry found a comedy that he’d enjoyed and put an episode on for them to watch.
it with Draco. But he acted like he was too old for Draco, which he wasn't.
, I know you don't care, but I care, and it is all fun and games until I'm leaking and I don't like it, okay? It's disgusting!” Draco got the towel, getting mad and wiping himself angrily. He followed Harry to the bathroom, his tears almost falling from his eyes. He didn't want to cry, but... Ugh! Bloody hormones. “I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry I can't give you what you want now. We should probably just go out and forget about sex for a while, how about that?”
“How are you feeling?  Are you excited for tomorrow?” He sent a text message to Harry, while relaxing on his bed. It was almost midnight, but he couldn't sleep.
Draco felt Harry's come pouring inside him, stretching his insides almost as much as his knot. It was an amazing feeling, something he longed for so long and now he was having.
It was good to talk to wizards who didn’t have a massive set of prejudices about Draco and him that he had to correct before they could become friends. The hot, sultry evening found Harry Draco and Oliver having dinner with several members of their opposing team, and Harry was
Draco tried to swallow as much as possible but, unused to the sensation, he sputtered a little. He got away from Harry after he finished coming, and cleaned his chin with his fingers, licking them while looking at Harry. Draco got up, his eyes tearing up a bit, but he had a smile on his face.
Harry looped his arms around Draco’s smaller shoulder and they started on the path towards their home. Because, Harry supposed, that was what it was now. Their home, their space. It was a wonderful thought and even though they were quiet, Harry knew he was smiling.
The tiny lace knickers that he’d worn beneath his dress all night were soaked through, and Harry’s shorts were soaked in pre-come, his cock hard and ruddy; utterly eroticised by the gorgeous little omega taking all control of their situation.
Harry had to admit that he was indeed impressed with all the different food choices his hosts had laid on. It was nothing like the meals he ate at home. Everything was far fresher and more plentiful.
Harry decided it should be okay to just let himself into Draco’s flat. After all, he’d given permission to see him in bed, at 6.30 promptly. He was dazed with lust, his hormones a riot in his brain, and his cock aching with want.
Draco felt the last tendrils of composure leave him. “Yes,” he snapped, “for your information I
Do you think I’VE forgotten? The lazy summer days? The lay-ins? Sitting together and talking until dawn? I loved you, Draco. I was utterly smitten.
“I’ve missed this,” Harry smiled, amazed at the sheer adoration he felt for the omega in his arms. “Missed you. I think I’m finally ready to appreciate what
His wide hand span making short work of his husbands skinny legs, Harry deliberately moved his fingers to Draco’s inner thighs. He sneaked his finger once, twice under Draco’s silky underwear. It really was too delicious.
Harry was out of words to help Draco to feel better. He though she looked wonderful, even in the plain black nursing bra she was wearing. None of it mattered to him, because she was all perfection to him.
He grazed his knuckles over the omega’s sides, spreading out his fingers to cup Draco’s pert backside, the silky material a gorgeous contrast to the taut flesh underneath.
“Everything you do feels fantastic, sweetheart... I can’t wait till our wedding night, I’m going to make every part of you delirious, make you so proud of your tight little body”.
... Come in my mouth..." Draco whispered, his voice hoarse as he put Harry's cockhead inside his mouth again and sucked, hard.
Harry picked up his tea, and drowned the rest of the mug. Laying down carefully on the bed, Harry snuggled up next to his wife. He didn’t want to disturb the breakfast tray, but a warm, sleep-ruffled Draco was far too lovely to resist. He nuzzled up to her side, kissing and snuggling her belly and enjoying her sweet morning scent.
. It would be extra pressure the omega didn’t need.
“Please. Tell her our baby is here, but... It's late. Maybe in the morning you can tell her?  And you can tell your friends and family too...?” Draco yawned, but refused to sleep because she wanted to have her baby back. She really wanted to feed her for the first time.
"Harry... Yes, please...! You've made me so big with your baby... I... I'm sure I can be even fuller... I need your cock inside me, I need your knot... I'll be so full of you I won't even think about anything after that... Please, Harry... Fill me... Give me more... Give me another finger..."
Draco arched his body, shivers running down his skin, and he opened his legs unconsciously.
Harry pulled away, and kissed the inside of Draco’s tender white thighs. He pushed the omega’s legs apart, and bit lightly, leaving a tiny mark.
Draco bit his lower lip, thinking about the offer. He wanted it, but it was too risky.
Unfortunately, the very next day Harry’s plan hit a bit of a snag.
As they finished their shower, Draco walked around their house, careless about his nakedness. He wanted the clothes he was using before, because they were comfortable, and he had barely used them. He decided to let his hair naturally dry, and then walked back to their bedroom.
Fucking hell, Draco tasted good, his slick tasting like honey and as viscous as oil. His tongue was everywhere, and Harry couldn’t get enough. He sucked and kissed, paying particular attention to Draco’s cock and cunt.
. “It hurts... It hurts now...!”
Pulling her close, Harry snaked his arms around Draco, kissing her soundly.
Harry wanted to enjoy this moment, wanted it to be all about Draco, this first lazy morning married and together. Pulling away, he instructed his husband not to move a muscle.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco, pulling him close. Harry was shaking with need, with the intimacy of the moment. He moved his head southwards, his husband’s pearly white skin like satin next to his lips.
“We wanted you two to be the first ones to know…” Hermione began, looking at Ron and grinning before turning to Draco and Harry again. “We are pregnant!”
"I'm not marrying Nott. I'm not marrying anyone who I don't want to marry. I'd rather
As Draco opened his eyes, he smiled with the warm feeling of being embraced. He felt loved and satisfied. But then another feeling took over his guts. He sat, groaning a little with the slight pain in his arse, and looked at Harry, and the windows that showed the day had begun.
Of course, it was all nonsense. They were as likely to have that sort of relationship as they were to fly to the moon. Harry had
“Draco,” Harry said, feeling the reluctance in her body to moving. “this  baby wants to come! You can’t wish this to stop, there’s no magic that can halt this! You need to go through that floo with me, because if our baby is small, then the safest place is at hospital! You need to come
“Lovely... Can I do anything else to make you feel good, darling?”
kind of bleeding. He chuckled to himself, and pushed Harry slightly, so he could sit on the bed.
“Oh yes, Draco. I think I can manage that,” Harry smiled, stoking his palm over Draco’s cock, enjoying the friction of under his hand. “You have a beautiful cock, Draco. It’s a work of art.” He stroked it, enjoying how silky smooth the skin was, how neat and perfect it was.
“Sorry you were bored, Draco.” Harry smirked. “You need more amusing than any person I’ve ever met... Good job you have other, considerable talents...” Harry laughed, rubbing his soaped-up hands all over Draco’s body, paying extra special attention to the round curves of his husband’s arse.
There were still fifteen minutes before midnight.
were fussy! Anyway, that’s what babies are like. She’ll be up in a bit, and you can have another go at settling her. Come here...”
, he though, deciding there and then to give up for the day.
They ordered sandwiches and pancakes for their breakfast, with two cups of tea. Draco cut Jasmine pancake in tiny pieces and took off her dummy. She went for it immediately, eating one and then shoving a piece on Harry's mouth. Then she would eat another piece and try to shove it on Draco's mouth.
Actually, with all the blond’s wiggling, it was actually quite tough to get a good hold, but Harry didn’t care. He was loving rimming Draco, enjoying the wonderful mixture of his spit, and the slick that was everywhere. Just to annoy, he licked two or three times more, and pulled away, wanting so much more but not presuming just to take...
if I lose you!"
“Daddy! Guess what!!! Mum’s got the most exciting news EVER!!!! But I’m not allowed to tell you :-( But this isn’t me telling you, I’m just saying there’s
one more on the scan spell. Harry half-heartedly tried to convince Draco to keep it a secret, but looking at the other man’s joyful face at the hospital, Harry knew immediately he was onto a losing battle with that one.
"No. In our intern hierarchy, Nott is in the same position as you in the company. Nott had been clingy for years, and I hated when my father insisted that Theo worked with us. Our families know each other since we were but a thought in our parents’ minds. I think he feels like you are stealing something like... My friendship?  My attention?  I don't know. I couldn't care less about Nott, but he feels like because we know each other since babies, he is entitled to be around me all the time."
“Yes.” Dudley Dursley’s voice was monotonous. Draco had no idea whether he was truly happy about this turn of events – so he sneaked a look.
Draco had never owned a second hand object in his life, and so far he didn’t like much of it.
She was a Slytherin. She might be looking for ammo to torture him, or ruin his reputation. It might all be a trick, so that she could tell everyone they knew just how terrible the life of the great Draco Malfoy was.
Figuring that blending into the shadows might be the best cause of action right now, Draco slunk to the side of the room. Nobody else seemed to notice him, and Draco felt weird about the fact that his newly-learned skills in sneaking around were coming into use.
“Thank you,” Draco said, hoping that Dumbledore would get the hint.
He stood on the bottom stair for a moment, questioning his every move.
Of course, the act of buying the food would be entirely beneath Draco. There was no mistaking that. but to have the freedom to choose all his own meals…
The scratchiness of this bed, the lumpy mattress – they immediately reminded him that actually he was still in the muggle house, with things of terrible quality that none of his ancestors would have been caught dead in.
He read the letter over and over. Each time he read it, a little part of him died on the inside a little more. he couldn’t say no to it. He couldn’t, not when he had already said he would go.
From inside, voices sounded. Draco shuffled his feet on the ground, trying not to scuff the shine of his shoes. He didn’t have access to polishing charms, and he didn’t know where to get them polished. If he messed them up now, he wouldn’t have the chance to make them good again for who knows how long.
And then suddenly it was Saturday. Draco didn’t know how that had happened so quickly, but it was the day of the party, and he wasn’t prepared at all.
“I’m sure,” Dumbledore said gently. “It won’t be forever.”
“Hi there!” An older woman stood in front of him, holding a clear container of some kind. (More plastic? Why were muggles like this?) “I saw that you moved in recently, and I just wanted to welcome you to the neighbourhood!”
Draco felt a little sick. The muggles wanted to socialise with him.
From this position he could see through the slats of his fence into his neighbour’s garden. It wasn’t the best of views – there were flowers which got in the way, and it didn’t seem overly well cared for to begin with – but it was interesting to see how the muggles chose to decorate their gardens. (It didn’t surprise Draco to see that the muggles were not good at gardening at all.)
The one bedroom upstairs that actually had a bed in it was clearly meant to be Draco’s. It was the biggest room, to be sure, but that wasn’t saying much. It wasn’t even as big as the boy’s dorm at Hogwarts, and Draco had always thought that that one was too small. The only reason that Draco put up with that was because he knew that it was traditional. His father had used this dorm, his grandfather had used this dorm, and so it was okay to be in it. So long as he could bring as many home comforts as he could.
“It’s great to see you again!” Draco looked up to see the woman he had talked to earlier in the week, who had invited him to this party to begin with.
Draco blinked. How long had it been since he had slept in that long? Every night here he had woken up at eight at least, his body clock still used to being forced to wake up that early.
It was clear that it had been several weeks since the grass had been cut – it was taller than the regulation grass at the manor had ever been, and it was raggedy in places. There were dandelions and buttercups growing all about the place, and all in all it looked very untidy.
He fell asleep before he could even register that choice.
“And there’s another thing, too,” she said, “there’s rumours – and I don’t know how true they are, mind – that there used to be another boy living there. Nobody quite knows what happened to him. There was talk a while ago of them sending him off to some boarding school for troubled boys, but nobody knows what came of that. All people have told me is that they haven’t seen this boy in literally years, and they have no idea if he’s still living with them or not.”
“Draco, this is Carol. She’s the host of this party,” the woman said, smiling.
He wouldn’t be replying for Pansy’s sake. He would be replying for his own.
His conclusions are thus: this house has clearly been looked after much more over the years than his own had been. Where his carpets are worn and slightly dirty (and had been since the moment he moved in) these are soft and fluffy and cream – any dirt would have shown up immediately, if there was any.
This time, Dumbledore turned and walked away, down the rest of the street. Right. They were in a muggle neighbourhood. He couldn’t just apparate away. And that meant that Draco couldn’t apparate away either.
It was a good job that this ‘den’ was dark, because Draco could feel his cheeks heating up. This was the first time that he had really messed up with making the muggles believe that he was one of them, because it sounded very much like the questions the man had asked him were completely normal for… whatever context a muggle would have had.
He opened it. Inside was a wall of metal, just a whole bunch of pots and pans stacked on top of each other in a mass that looked ripe to fall out and on him. Quickly, he shut it again. Qith each failure he was getting more and more hungry, and it only made him want to get that food more.
“Draco.” It was sort of nice to say his name, and revel in how much better it was than the muggle’s. He had already known that muggles had their own strange naming conventions – the mudbloods at Hogwarts had been rife with them – but it didn’t take much for Draco to remind himself how much better the pureblood names were
“I have had one… but I’ll take another,” Draco smirked, picking one up. (He didn’t want to admit it, but they really were very good. He hadn’t thought that muggles were capable of making such good food.)
But they were muggles. And there was more pressure – he was representing all the wizards, even if none of the muggles knew about it. Straightening his spine even further, he tugged at the bottom of his suit jacket, trying to get its lines to sit just right. He once again found himself wishing for a good, simple set of dress robes, but they had been very clear on the things he was
Not sure what he was going to go in and face, Draco pulled the door open.
But he wasn’t supposed to be getting any letters at all. They had been very clear about it – he wasn’t allowed to have an owl at all, because the muggles would find it strange to see owls about so often. Which was ridiculous, as far as Draco was concerned. How else were you supposed to send your mail? No doubt the muggles had a far inferior system – they probably still used the pony express. Hah!
Stepping into the house, Draco tries to look around as thoroughly as he can without making it clear that he’s snooping around to see how similar this house is to his own.
He pulled out a drawer. Thankfully, it was empty – there was no trace in any of the drawers of his things.
Then – like the world knew that he was doing so – there came a knocking at the front door, echoing throughout the house. Draco only had his trousers on.
Picking up the letter, he threw it under his bed. He would deal with it later. Pansy would be lucky if she got a response at all, and if she did it would only have the bare bones of the details. Exposing your weaknesses was Slytherin no-no number one, and if this was a trick then he wasn’t going to fall for it.
Choosing the cornflakes, mostly because he didn’t feel like he’d throw up from the sugar in the other one, Draco settled in to eat.
Draco touched the corner of one of the squares. Packets. It rustled and crinkled at him, and Draco tried to not be disgusted by the whole thing. How did muggles look at this stuff and think, yum, time for food?
The men he was sat with all groaned in unison. It must have been the other team in the game who had… got a point? Draco didn’t know what ‘footie’ was, even after having to listen to the mudbloods talk about it sometimes.
“I’ll see you in three months for your check up,” Dumbledore said, taking one step back. “Don’t forget to keep out of trouble.”
Then he noticed the letter on his floor. So it hadn’t been a dream, then. Pansy really had written to him, and she really had wanted for him to reply to her and… do something.
After spending a whole evening surrounded by muggles, it had Draco longing to be a part of the world that he had grown up in. sure, he could spend time around muggles, but there was nothing like talking to wizards. Being left in the dark for hours was enough to slowly drive him mad.
There was an owl perched on the windowsill.
And then his stomach growled, and Draco jerked back to himself.
The second thing that Draco noticed was the words written down on this first page.
Then Draco pulled open a drawer next to that cupboard, and hit the jackpot. Inside was so much muggle food. Just – so much of that plastic material that muggles tended to use for absolutely everything and anything that they could.
As if Draco would risk getting into ‘trouble’ again. He had to keep every urge to bristle to a minimum – Dumbledore probably wouldn’t see him in front of the wizenagamot, but there was no telling what they might do to him if they decided that they needed to review Dumbledore’s memories of this. “Thanks,” Draco repeated, trying to keep frustration out of his voice and face.
If only Draco knew how to warm this place up.
When he peeked in to where he thought the living room would be, he found that he was right about this, that the room was full of more people. Maybe it wasn’t going to be the most interesting thing in the world, but it would be better than watching ‘footie’.
Draco might not be happy about being in a muggle’s house, but he could at least show them all that he had better manners than any of them.
Gingerly, he reached out and opened the front door.
Inside, it was immediately obvious that there was an extension charm put on it. The amount of items that were stuffed inside – there was no way there was no charm on it to make it bigger.
As if she had even been in the same vicinity as the dark lord.
Soon enough, the water warmed up. Not massively, but it was lukewarm enough that Draco was happy enough to get under it. For all that it was meant to be at the hottest it could go, Draco wasn’t very impressed.
Wondering what the time was, he pulled out his pocket watch. It was ornate, and wonderful, and had been a gift from his mother on his birthday. He hadn’t expected to even get one, and yet she had gone ahead and done it. It had been one wizarding thing that he had actually snuck out with him, and it had been entirely worth it. He wasn’t going to allow the ministry to take his prized possession and sell it, probably. No, this was staying safe with him. where it belonged.
He could not afford to dwell on it, though. There were more pressing issues, which made it nearly impossible to ignore.
He shared a few more pleasantries with Carol, mostly surrounding the food as they ate some of it.
Heading back downstairs, Draco set about making himself lunch. He wasn’t massively hungry, but it was something to do. And he had been hungry earlier, so that was the same thing, right?
Gingerly he tried opening the one that looked like a big black box with a glass door.
Sure, during their school years he and pansy had spent a lot of time together. They had put on the act of being the perfect Slytherin couple, after all, and the whole school had thought them wonderful, to be envied. But in all the time they had spent together, Draco couldn’t recall them having many meaningful conversations. From time to time they might discuss what the dark lord was planning, or how much they all hated the Gryffindors, but it never went deeper than that. Pansy would always claim that their stories were too gory, and they should change the topic to whatever gossip she had for them this week. (Draco thought that he probably had a mental catalogue of every couple who had gotten together and broken up in the entire time they were at school. All of the information had been learned very unwillingly.)
Scrambling out from under the covers, Draco struggled with the window for a minute. How was he supposed to get this blasted thing open – he wrestled with the handle for a solid 30 seconds, before realising that there was a button he could press, and that he could then twist the handle and push.
His mother’s words came to mind.
It was difficult to resist.
Draco blinked. “Wow,” he said. “And – how do people know about the existence of this other boy at all?”
“I’m not sure I understand,” Draco said, running his fingers along the side of his glass. “Why do you dislike them?” He could see his own reasons for not wanting to go near them, but Alison had said nothing about any of that.
He shook his head a little, reminding himself that it wouldn’t do to get too happy here. He had come only to avoid being impolite; there was no need to actually enjoy himself here. There were no friends to be made, no acquaintances to be found.
“So – um, who’s playing?” Draco murmured to the man closest to him.
The woman on the other side smiled at him too. “Why don’t you come in?” She said, gesturing at the house behind her.
It didn’t take him very long to go round to check out what tools he was working with. And – there were a lot. Far more than he could name, or even get a good look at.
Picking out the first ones he came across, he realised that they were cloaks. Smiling, he placed them to one side. It was nice for his mum to have packed them, but one of the strict lectures he had had about coming here was that he wasn’t to wear cloaks under any circumstances. From what Draco understood from seeing the mudbloods at Hogwarts, muggles chose not to wear cloaks any more. For what reason he couldn’t understand, but it had been made very clear that wearing a cloak in public would be treated by them much the same as if he had performed magic. And Draco was eager to not be sent to Azkaban, thank you very much.
Alison released his hand, and took one step away from the door. Draco immediately went to shut it.
Out of boredom for anything else to do, Draco ended up having another look around the house, trying to see if there was anything else he could do here.
Okay. Maybe there was something else he could do.
One of the men grunted, and in unison they all turned back round to face the glowing box.
Opening it, he stared at the first page. Not only was the type of parchment muggles used incredibly white and flimsy, but it also smelled weird. It was the first thing Draco noticed, that it was so different to the parchment that he was used to using.
Everything here was… definitely of the muggle standard. Draco didn’t know who had purchased it, but it looked like they hadn’t put much effort into it.
Oh. Draco glanced over at the Dursleys again. Vernon had disappeared, presumably to go watch the football with the other men, but Dudley was still stood next to his mum, politely nodding and answering questions. He was heavyset, sure, but he didn’t look like a thug. Not that Draco had any idea what a muggle would consider thug-like, but from what he had overheard at Hogwarts, a lot of it had to do with tattoos.
He began to pull the clothes on.
How did muggles light up their rooms again? Draco knew they must have a way, but he had never paid any attention to the muggleborns at Hogwarts, and his father would have had a fit if he had ever suggested taking muggle studies.
So if they hadn’t been close – and Draco certainly hadn’t told her any of this – then how did she know all this? Who had told her? Why had she thought that she needed to contact him at all? The last he had heard, she had moved on from him to Blaize. And when she had, Draco had felt nothing.
allowed to bring, and dress robes had been at the top of the list. He didn’t
There was milk in the cold box. Draco had seen it yesterday – it was the thing traditionally eaten with the cereal, right?
If Draco had had any owl treats, he would have refused to give the owl any. As it was, he didn’t have any, so the owl would have to go without either way. He took the letter, and closed the window in the owl’s face. That would teach it.
Sipping at his wine, and trying to appear uninterested, Draco listened in.
Holding the trowel firmly in his hand, Draco walked back into the garden. His hat was shading him from the sun, there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and he had a potted plant ready to be planted. How hard could this be?
He blinked a few times, feeling blank.
And then he remembered. This was his house now. He lived here. He was in his own living room.
Draco looked up. And back down at the watch. And across the room at where the muggle’s clock was.
If muggles had to deal with this every day, then no wonder all of them were constantly awful. Draco could practically feel himself turning into one of them already.
He placed the first trunk right beside the dresser. He had no intention of putting any of his clothes in it, of course – he’d rather live out of his trunks for the next few years than have his belongings touch that old thing.
(Draco was well aware that even if he had an owl, there were very few people he would need to contact. And there were only a few of those people who would want to contact him.)
Opening up his door, he didn’t even bother to turn the light on. It was dark, and it may as well stay that way.
Stepping further into the grass, he looked around, just in case there were any tools left outside, or anything.
He spent the rest of the afternoon looking over the books he had brought with him. There were only a few that he truly treasured, and the rest were just ones that he had thought he might enjoy, pilfered from the library at home before the ministry turned up to confiscate everything his parents had ever owned.
Momentarily, he thought about taking the time to put them on. But when the knock came again, he realised that he fully did not have the time to worry about that, and he leapt out of his room.
There was a mirror in one of the other bedrooms that was full length. Draco admired himself in it – the suit looked as good as the day he had bought it, and there wasn’t a speck of dust on it. He looked good.
Then he nearly tripped over his own feet, and ended up lying back on his bed. Maybe it was the universe telling him to leave the letter alone.
It wasn’t there.
Alison walked away. Draco didn’t want to think about her for any longer than he had to. A muggle wasn’t worthy of his thoughts, not for any longer than she already had been part of them.
He was filled with the urge to do it himself. It was fine if nobody knew he was doing it, right? He could pretend that someone else did, if his mum came over.
There were several metal racks inside, but no food of any kind.
For what was probably half an hour, Draco sat on his new sofa and contemplated his life. At least three times during that time he went for his wand. Clearly his mind still hadnt figured out that there was no chance of him using any magic for a long while unless he wanted to get locked up for real this time.
From out here, it was even easier to see how well his little plants were doing. In the few days it had been since he planted them here, they had begun to flourish. Maybe it was just Draco’s imagination, but he thought that it looked very much like some of them were taller and brighter than they had been before. It made him feel very good about himself.
Or long to wake up again.
Through the glass, figures wobbled. Then the door opened.
And why hadn’t the ministry told him to leave it behind? That was an odd oversight on their part.
It wasn’t the biggest win, but it was definitely something. And that had to be good enough for Draco.
And so he headed back through to the kitchen, trying to keep the ever-present irritation from spilling out from him. This was just his life now, and he would have to deal with it whether he liked it or not. (Only years of controlling his emotions at home kept him calm right now.)
The two women led him through into the kitchen. “Everyone’s going to be so excited to see you,” the first woman said, who had introduced herself as Carol when she closed the door. “You wouldn’t believe how much everyone has been talking about you.”
But when he finished the chocolate bar, he put the wrapper to the side, and looked at the other packet on the table. It was coloured brighter, and was much larger.
Like it had burned him, Draco dropped the folder on the floor. It fell face down, and Draco was sure that some of the pages were being crumpled under its own weight. That didn’t matter, though, not when he was being insulted like this. As if Draco would ever have any interest in learning about muggles and whatever filth they got up to in their own time. Draco would be dead before he ever agreed to assimilate to muggle culture.
It was something which made Draco slightly uncomfortable. How was he to live a good life here if he struggled to remember the actions he took? (Was this some strange muggle phenomena? Was this something he would need to watch out for in the future?)
The owl looked reproachfully at Draco. Draco closed the curtains.
Brushing his hair out of his face, he began to read.
Alison sounded slightly detached form the thing she was describing. Draco found himself re-evaluating his neighbours once again – this time because he thought that maybe they were abusers, or something else.
And there, by the bush, there was a figure. A bench stood next to the bush, and the figure was sat on it, a small glow next to them indicating they had some sort of light source.
As he watched, the figure and its light moved, heading into the house. Whoever it was, they clearly had their own plan in mind. That was good enough for Draco – mystery solved, problem over.
Draco stumbled into his home. It was dark, and quiet, and a little cold. The heat of the day earlier had gone, and now it was replaced by the chill of the night.
“Yes, we’re so proud of you, aren’t we Diddykins?” Petunia Dursley’s voice stood out to Draco over the noise of everyone else talking.
Suppressing a groan, Draco opened the door back up. “Yes?” He said, through gritted teeth.
The woman wasn’t much better. In contrast to all the other women here (who Draco had been surprised to find pleasant to talk to, if a little giggly), she looked haughtily at everyone else, craning her long neck over their shoulders, even when talking to them. She wasn’t particularly tall, but she gave off the impression of being, and teetered on high heels which put her only an inch or so above the rest. She didn’t particularly remind him of his mother…. But there was something in her expression, something in the cruel set of her eyes, which reminded him of certain parts of his extended family. And he would rather avoid any association with them so far.
Usually the trunks would be protected with charms. But seeing as Draco had no way of undoing them himself, he could already feel that there was no magic on these. It was sad to feel, and he tried to pretend like he wasn’t bothered by it as he opened up the first one.
If nothing else, Draco did want to find out what the muggles possibly put inside it. He opened the door, and immediately was hit with a blast of cold air, as well as a light which the box emitted as soon as he opened it. Draco’s jaw dropped – what magic had this box been infused with that it could do this? Be cold all the time?
There was a short pause. “Well,” Mrs Dursley said, “obviously we applied to Oxbridge. But they didn’t want him – he’s too clever for them by half, I dare say. So we thought, well, may as well apply for some which are more likely to be up to his standards. So we applied for the University of East Anglia, and Sheffield Hallam, and the University of Hertfordshire. And you’re quite happy with those, aren’t you Diddy?”
The garden to the left was the one that Draco had seen movement in. Just looking at it, Draco was already jealous. There were rows and rows of beautiful flowers, and a greenhouse in the corner right at the back. A small bush sat in the middle of the garden, its flowers seemingly white in the dark of night.
Draco only sort of understood what university was, anyway. It was something that the mudbloods talked about sometimes, but it was always in the context of their muggle siblings, and it had never been clear what the purpose of this was. Were muggle schools not up to the task of teaching their pupils well enough? If university was meant to be another level of schooling, why could they not teach them enough while they were at school? It made no sense.
Going out of the door to the left led him in a full circle, back to the hallway and the front door where he had first come in.
Draco woke to a familiar sound, that of the soft hooting of an owl mixed with the tapping on the glass which meant that he had mail.
The woman Draco didn’t know began to talk about things he didn’t quite understand – something about ucas, and about the application process, and about the university she went to.
Immediately Draco knew that this would be what would keep him entertained while he was here. Usually he would be hesitant to lower himself to tending his own garden – there was a reason why the manor employed ten gardeners alone – but there was no shame in elevating his house to the glory it should be in. it would be more shameful for him to leave the garden in its current state.
Carefully, worried that it might be dirty somehow, Draco sat down gently on the bed. Immediately, he felt a spring digging into his buttocks. He grimaced. Was this the level of comfort he was to expect for the next few years?
Determined to not find out, Draco went back to his trunks and took a look at what his mum had packed for him. As he thought, at the bottom of both of them were several books. Only a drop in the ocean compared to the library at the manor, but it would do to keep him occupied for a short while.
Determined to get a handle on what was inside, Draco began to pull everything out, hoping that getting a better look at it might help him to understand it better, and maybe help him get inside the minds of the muggles. To let him fit in better.
It held a letter in its beak.
It didn’t even look like ‘Diddykins’ was looking forward to it.
But there was something missing here. He had pulled out most of what he had here, piled them on the floor next to him, and there was no sign of underwear. Draco could probably live without any, but it felt like an odd thing for his mum to leave out when she was packing. There was another place that the rest of his things could be, and he knew he had to check there.
Instead of going back to his book, he went back upstairs. There was bound to be something else he could do. There was bound to be more in the trunks to entertain him aside from the books.
But no matter how hard he looked through the trunks, he found nothing else of interest. There were only his clothes. Which, okay, he did need clothes. But it would have been nice to have something else to entertain himself with.
Stripping off, Draco stepped into the bathtub. He shivered a little, the air feeling a little colder now that he was naked. The warm water had better come soon.
Draco stood in the middle of the kitchen, trying to think if he had ever seen anyone cook sausages. It must be possible to do with what he had. There had been that whole cupboard full of… cooking things, after all.
He circled the house a few more times, and eventually decided that yes, he should leave now. It was late enough that he felt he could justify leaving by now. After stopping by to tell Carol and Alison that he was leaving, he headed back over the street to his own house.
There was nothing to
The day after that ended up being a little more interesting. But only a bit.
“That’s an interesting watch.” Alison’s voice broke through his thoughts. “Where on earth did you get that?”
Right! Alison, that had been her name.
Inside there was all manner of foods – some of which Draco recognised, and others which he didn’t. That was okay – Draco wasn’t picky about his food. Well, he was, but so long as whoever had stocked the thing with decent food, he should be fine.
Then Carol asked a question which made things a lot more difficult.
His hand brushed over where his wand would be if he still had it. The line of his coat felt wrong without it, but he knew full well that it was currently sealed away in some part of the ministry building, wherever they usually put prisoner’s wands. Draco had very little hope that he would get it back when he was released from this sentence, but it was nice to imagine that he might one day get to go back to being normal.
To be honest, there wasn’t much to do. He hadn’t established any kind of routine yet, although he thought he probably should.
what's up my dudes! apologies for taking so long with this chapter - hopefully there won't be such a long gap between this and the next chapter. enjoy!
Maybe team names weren’t universal across sports. That – that would make a lot of sense.
But then he remembered that he had responsibilities. And he couldn’t stand the idea of being rude to anyone, even if that person was a muggle.
“And don’t forget, you can’t come back in until you finish watering
of them! I’m going to come and make sure you do!” A shrill female voice seemed to shout after the first person. It was sort of reminiscent of some of Draco’s less savoury family members, and he shuddered.
He spent a few minutes like that, just trying to think if there were any ways he could cook this sausage that didn’t require relying on muggle contraptions to do it.
Eventually Draco found them in another cupboard he hadn’t looked in before. He went about making the cereal quickly – he didn’t want to think too hard about the fact that he was apparently going to be eating something that the muggles liked.
Next came the trousers, and Draco had several options here. There were casual jeans, ones which he understood muggles were fond of wearing all the time, even in formal settings. But the idea of dressing down… well, it just wasn’t done. Why his mum had even packed them, he didn’t know. But underneath them were suit trousers, and they were acceptable. He could wear those and not feel like he was doing away with all of his upbringing.
Shit.
Draco resisted the urge to point out that the problem was that it was happening at all. The cheerful ‘no. 2’ stared at him like it was mocking him in its muggleness, like it was going out of its way to point out that Draco didn’t belong here. “I know,” he said instead.
Then he looked away, so as to make it clear that he wasn’t listening in on the conversation.
Draco stalled. He couldn’t mention Hogwarts. He couldn’t. Muggles didn’t’ know about Hogwarts – Draco might not know much about muggles, but he had known that much since he was a toddler.
And then – the sound of sizzling met Draco’s ears. He lifted his head. The sausages were making the sizzling sound. They were – were they cooking?
An anxiety that Draco hadn’t thought he would ever feel began to fill him. Why was he anxious at the prospect of talking to a muggle? It didn’t make any sense.
Thinking it must have been part of a dream that he couldn’t remember, Draco looked towards the window. He would see nothing, he told himself, he would simply have to go back to sleep.
Wait. No. he wasn’t meant to be getting interested in anything the muggles were doing. That was ridiculous. He couldn’t possibly do that.
For a moment, he thought he was back in his home. Back where he belonged, wrapped up in thousand count thread sheets, on a mattress made two hundred years ago and filled with ostrich feathers. He had received mail in this room thousands of times, and it was second nature for him to sit up, and –
And then he stopped dead in his tracks, realising that there was something major he had missed when he had looked around the house before.
Alison nodded. “It would be very rude not to,” she said.
Draco blinked. “Thank you?”
Neither of them looked pleasant.
He sat down in a dining room chair. It wasn’t exactly comfortable – it felt hard, like it had been used too much and been flattened.
In fact – what was he doing in the living room? He had a bed upstairs, admittedly a rather uncomfortable one. There was no reason he shouldn’t have used it.
That seemed to break the tension. The women laughed, and cooed, and it made Draco feel good about himself.
After all, any pureblood witch or wizard was ten times better than a muggle.
“And that’s nothing on the way that Mrs Beech treats her niece,” Alison said, changing the topic at will. “You should have heard the way she was screaming at her the other day. It was downright embarrassing. If I ever…”
And then Draco’s gaze wandered up from the grass. There was a tall-ish brown fence enclosing the space – it was much smaller than the kinds of gardens that Draco was used to. Still, he stepped out into it happily enough. It seemed that nature was one of those rare things that was the same no matter if you were a muggle or a wizard.
But he was going to be buying his own food. That had been one of the things made very clear to him when they told him that he was going to be forced to live by himself in a muggle neighbourhood – that they wouldn’t be providing anything to him in the time he was there, and that there would be no interaction between them at all, unless he broke one of the rules.
It didn’t take long to get him sorted out, but by the time he turned back around the other woman had disappeared. So had some of the other women, and Draco could only assume that they had moved to another room.
This time, he took the plunge and began to climb the stairs.
Then Draco realised that none of the men were talking, and there was the sound of thousands of people cheering from the stadium shown on the box. There must be some way to get a lot of sound out of it, Draco mused, but how?
“Do you have the keys?”
Draco made his sandwich, as full of ham as he would make it if he was at home, and he enjoyed eating it greatly.
Closing the curtains, Draco turned away from the view of the muggle street. It would wait until Saturday.
Just like the bed, this was clearly a second hand dresser.
A lot of green. That was a good sign.
Getting into his pyjamas after brushing his teeth (something that had taken him a while to figure out, when he’d gotten into the habit of just using cleaning charms for it in Hogwarts), he got into bed.
“Come with me,” she said, smiling like she thought she knew what Draco wanted. “They’re through in the den. I shouldn’t let them sit through here and watch the footie, but you know how they get when I don’t let them watch the game.”
Pulling them out of the pan and onto a plate, Draco finally realised the hubris of his actions. There were so many – why was this going to be his only thing for dinner? Was this even a good idea?
Putting it in the door, he turned it – and the door unlocked. It seemed strange, to open a house like this and feel no trace of magic around it. The whole point of this was that he should have no access to magic for the remainder of his sentence, and he had to get used to that.
Without thinking it though much, Draco nodded.
Already his fingers felt greasy, just from holding onto the plastic. Was that normal? Just a plastic thing? Or was it because it was food? Draco didn’t know, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to know.
No. The risk was too great.
He unfolded it. It was a handwritten note, which read:
But no. He wouldn’t give in.
“So what do you do, Draco?”
(Already the idea that he was going to have to give up hot showers plagued him.)
Well, it wouldn’t matter for now. Draco couldn’t be sure of some of the things that the letter mentioned, but he knew what rsvp meant. If he didn’t have to reply at all, he would have until the party to make up his mind.
Draco sat there for what he deemed a reasonable period of time. The game didn’t seem hard to follow. It was like a very dumbed down version of quidditch. There was only one ball – which was far too few, because otherwise what was everyone else on the field meant to do – and two goals, one at each end. The men ran up and down the field, and tried to kick the ball at each other. Or in the goal; Draco wasn’t entirely sure.
Immediately, all eyes were on them. Being completely used to this, of course, Draco didn’t mind. Well – what he did mind was that they were all muggles. Had this been a wizarding event there would have been nothing wrong with any of this, and he would have allowed them all to drink their fill of him.
When reading slowly – intentionally so – he only read through a chapter or so before deciding to go ahead and make a start on dinner.
And so Draco picked up several of the packets, and brought them over to the dining table. If he was going to eat these, he was at least going to eat them at the dining table, like a civilised person.
He had hoped that being able to sleep would make his mind up on the subject, would help him see what the best course of action was. Unfortunately, this does not seem to have worked. Now he had no more idea what he should do with it. Pansy had never been close to him. Did he even want to tell her all about what it was like to live in this hellhole?
And there was no sign of any heat. Draco held his palm over the ring, hoping to feel something. Maybe there was a tiny amount of heat? But surely it made sense to just immediately make it hot? Wasn’t that how magic cooking worked? (Draco realised he didn’t actually know – there had been so few times that he saw any cooking going on that he actually had no idea whether that was true or not.) But at least if he’d had his wand, he could have summoned fire, or some other kind of heat, and that could have cooked these sausages.
Nott, that unpleasant Alpha that had so aggravating Harry the previous week reared his ugly, horse-like face into view. He immediately upset Harry’s alpha instincts by deliberately pushing in front of him and really invading his personal space.
"Harry, can you take them here? I guess the monster would like to bite on something," Draco smiled, once again looking at them, while Lyra cleaned Iris hand and checked if Chloe didn't stick anything in her mouth, too.
"I love you so much, Harry Potter. You have no idea what you make me feel."
"Fuck, Harry! Ahn! So... So fucking good...!" Draco's eyes rolled back to his head, and he felt the need to touch his own nipples, but he didn't feel safe enough to release Harry's hair from his tight fists. Harry's stubble helped in the pleasure, touching his skin and for sure marking his thighs a deep red. Draco didn't care. "Oh, God, Harry... I'm... I'm almost... Fuck, how do you always...?"
He dried his hair and combed it perfectly. When he was completely dry, he walked to their bedroom, feeling a little uncomfortable for being completely naked. It was unusual and foreign feeling only his skin, his chest and cock out for everyone (Harry) to see. It gave him chills, but he firmly continued walking. He got on the bed and immediately got under the sheets, touching his back to Harry's chest.
He wriggled out of his damp boxer shorts, his cock jerking free next to those
He moved his own head, touching his lips to Harry's and holding on his tee shirt, opening his mouth, giving permission so Harry could explore it.
Draco supported himself on his hand, looking down at Harry, his eyes getting used to the dark as he observed his husband, touching his beard with his free hand.
Harry felt the sound of those heels clicking on the floor as if they were pulsing through his very centre.
Draco didn't wait much. He sent a message with 'Meet you there' to Harry and left his office. Pansy just looked at him from where she sat, filing her nails, and rolled her eyes. Draco got into the lift, going to the kitchen floor and walking casually. He didn't want to show he was about to do something he wasn't supposed to do.
, was Harry ready to take this gift he was being given.
The trip was fine, even with Draco waddling a bit to get around the portkey. The sensation of the travel had made her sick, and she had to sit down for a moment, eyes closed, trying to ease her stomach. The first thing she felt was the heat.
“You’re doing fine, darling... You’re such a good mummy, and Jasmine is happy and content. See, it was
Draco took off his blazer, his black shirt, toed off his shoes and, as he moved towards his bedroom, he was only wearing his black, silky lingerie.
“I'm sorry... I didn't think it was going to hurt so much...”
Harry was enjoying the quiet of the garden, a midday cup of tea and a day off the quidditch field when Draco came bounding up to him, demanding a trip to the supermarket.
“I haven't drank in over a year, Harry. One glass and I already feel a little tipsy,” Draco smiled, her cheeks pink with Harry's compliment.
“And I want to mark your lush little neck. I know it makes me sound like a prehistoric alpha arsehole, but I’d like to show everyone at the company that you’re mine -
. With the position he was in, he couldn't really go away from him, but he tried, trashing his legs with the new, unexpected sensation.
“I hope you don't say that because of recent experience with other mouths,” Draco teased, but hugged Harry and sighed. He was so warm and delicious. She just loved him so much... She wanted to give him more, but shame took over her.
Draco was truly happy that his husband wanted him so much. It was strange, for him, after many years of not having any of this type of action. They almost got caught in the Quidditch changing room, and luckily Draco was still wearing his healer robes.
Draco was struggling to adapt to his new living arrangements. Merlin, but Harry was obnoxious. He was every part the Gryffindor git that Draco had been expecting.
Draco's legs were weak, his mind and body a mess. He was so wet he was sure he was going to slip on his own slick anytime. As he opened the door, he had to control a moan with the mere sight of Harry.
“Jamie... I love you. I'm sorry we can't have sex. I love that you understand...”
Harry was only too happy to agree. A trip out wasn’t what he wanted either.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand and practically ran out of the parlour. He couldn't stay there anymore. He had to go and really didn't want to cry in front of Harry and Lyra. He got inside the first taxi he saw and gave his parents’ house address to the driver.
he wrote, “
Harry felt awful; he thought perhaps he hadn’t given Draco enough time to acclimatise to the sex. That was always his weak spot; rushing into things without thinking, just assuming they’d always work out.
Harry laughed at her enthusiasm. “I don’t know. We’re having a week catching up with our lives. But I’ll give him your love.”
“I'm...
As soon as he arrived, he took a long shower and looked around his body. He barely had any body hair, but where he did have, he plucked them all out. He was very used to it by now that he barely felt anything. Also, they were so thin and blond that if he missed one or another, not even him would notice.
"Actually..." Draco was confused, between happy for Harry's words, and sad because of his Hell of a day. "All my bags and stuff are out here... If you can help me put them inside. They're pretty heavy, me and Pansy almost died putting it in her car," he said, looking behind to where Pansy's car had been. The spot was empty. "And... I'd like a very, very strong cup of coffee. Pansy gave me vodka already and I don't plan on getting drunk. I'm a stupid drunk."
“I certainly can. Although I don’t recommend you passing out
Harry narrowed his eyes.
And then Draco was angling his body, his hugging legs knotting his in a way that sent vibrations straight to his cock. Harry knew he was teasing, his cock head sitting pretty at Draco’s entrance. All he needed was one roll of his hips to slide all the way home.
“I’m sorry, but why would Draco Malfoy be insistent on talking to me, we have not been in contact in over five years.”
... But chocolate wouldn't help him with this. Not anymore. he needed his alpha now.
Draco had given him a workout that could rival the toughest Quidditch match, but he wasn’t about to stoke his ego by admitting it aloud.
He went to his jeans, opening it up and trying to shove it down. He was using black pants, and it showed how hard he was already. Although small, his cock's shape could be seen on it.
He helped Draco to move into a comfortable position on his hands and knees, and opened his legs wide so his beloveds perfectly pink furled arsehole was on display. He licked a lovely strip across the delicate skin, and rubbed his thumb across the pliable flesh.
“I think so, yeah,” Harry said, a look of concentration on his face.
“Okay, I’ll instruct the driver,” he replied, and knocked on the glass to instruct him to take them to Draco’s apartment.
As a direct result of Harry’s audacious nudity, Draco was randy every moment of the day, a situation that had left him preoccupied and inattentive. He couldn’t focus on his lessons. He’d nearly fallen off his broomstick
Harry was really warming up to his idea.
Harry wasn’t a healer, and hadn’t a single clue what he was looking at when Draco cast the spell.
rent boy. If your parents turn you out then you’ll have a home with me... And I wish I could save all the those omegas, Draco, but I can’t. I can only save you.”
good enough. You’re clever, and lovely and a good mum. More than I’d ever deserve, really. Don’t say you’re unworthy. It hurts me terribly, Draco, that you feel like that. You’re wonderful.”
me? I'd like if was outside, though, over the skin of my arsehole... Because then you'd have to lick it all clean. What do you think?"
“Now... I want you to make me come. I know we can't do penetrative yet, but...” Draco took his top off, showing his lithe body, small breasts with puffy nipples, a dark shade of pink on them. “Suckle on them... And play with my cock. I know I'll be coming in seconds.”
“Don't worry, baby, it's okay. Didn't hurt, see? It was just a slip, you're fine,” Draco got up, holding Jasmine in one arm, the toy in the other hand, as she kissed her knee to prove it wasn't hurt.
Draco still looked at her before turning and getting closer to Harry again. He cleaned his cheeks, and hugged Harry. He wasn't sure if he could explain what just happened to him.
It was incredibly funny.
"Come with me for the interview, Harry. Talk to him about your plans for the charity. I'm sure he'd love to help us out."
His alabaster skin was even whiter after he took of the black dress, stark bright against his lacy bra and knickers. His bra was see-through, showing his hard nipples behind beautifully made lace. He sat back again on Harry's lap, getting closer and whispering on his ear.
.  He’d made that clear. Harry knew he needed to go home. The hormones, the pheromones... It was too
With Harry's question, Draco went bright red, his mouth opening a little. Was he okay with that?  Did he feel hot with it? Draco considered for a few seconds before replying.
He felt a bit rueful about Draco’s negative feelings, and he absolutely hasn’t meant to make her feel unattractive.
Harry’s cock was hard and dripping and he was ready. Ready to take Draco and make him his own. Lining his cock up with Draco’s cunt, he took a deep, uneven breath. It was utterly, absolutely the right moment and he was so ready for this...
. He swallowed saliva, unconsciously raising his hand behind his neck and pulling his hair and showing his unmarked, pale white soft neck to the alpha.
Harry leaned into the kiss, thoroughly enjoying how relaxed they both were.
He let go with a
“Put on a show just for you? Well, with your hot little body right there, I don’t really have a choice... I’m still hard from before, you’re so fit...”
“I don’t know your parents, Draco, but even if you defied them, and lived life for yourself, were your own person rather than somebody else’s ideology, surely they’d come around to it? I mean, you’re their only child, and any child of yours would be the heir to their business, their fortune and the only way of carrying on the family name. I can’t believe they’d be willing to give all of that up. I don’t care what Lyra presents as, I want her to live life in whatever way makes her happy. You should give them a chance, talk to them when you return from this business trip. They might surprise you.”
Oops. Our hands slipped.
Draco dressed casually, skinny blue jeans and a soft, silky white shirt. He wore silver sandals, because he was feeling pretty delicate that day and wanted to show it.
“Dogs can be
“I think it’s harder for the mum in our situation, her life gets turned upside down and it’s hard to see how you’ll get back to the person you were before... But Draco, I do think you are doing so well... Our baby is thriving, and happy and comfortable. And you look beautiful.” Harry took her hand in his, playing with each of her fingertips.
And then, what that woman said: 'You're the same old Draco Malfoy, dressed in girl's clothes'.
“How can it protect us, Harry? It's so small. Jasmine will end up biting it's tail. It's adorable, but I don't think it will suit us for protection,” she licked her own lips free of butter, as Jasmine tried to get a hold of the laptop.
Harry was on Draco in a moment, hands all over him, removing articles of clothing with very little finesse or care for how they would look when they were put back on.
Draco felt complete. She truly did feel complete, as she felt every time she was like this with Harry, full of him, in his arms, with his words echoing in her head.
"Thank you, alpha... I want this... I want this forever... I want to have you with me every day... And I want you to talk about yourself, and Lyra... What do you want, what do you like... "
Harry looked at his husband, completed exhausted by the pleasure he had experienced moments before.
As he dressed up later that day, he couldn't stop thinking that, even married, they still had to wait.
Draco didn't know much about laptops, being honest.  Just that she could see shops inside it and sometimes the mail would drop things on their post box or something. And they could watch muggle films in it as well.
"Yes,
at it.
Harry palmed his hard cock through his shorts. They were already damp with pre-come but what Draco wanted, he always got.
"Can I go to work now?"
While Draco was showering Harry lazed about on the bed waiting. He couldn’t quite believe the way that their day was going. Draco was far more cheerful and relaxed than he’d ever seen him. Of course, there was that inane threat from Nott, and the thought made him twinge a little with guilt. Should he tell Draco? It would certainly ruin his brilliant mood.
"You certainly look excited, Mr Potter," Draco smiled, his eyes bright as he let his sight bath in Harry's presence. He was such an amazing figure, and Draco wished to have him all the way.
Baling the boxers up, Draco rubbed the soft cotton across his chest, fantasising about Harry’s defined muscles and the thick treasure trail of hair that led to his cock. That was the moment a naughty idea flew into his brain. What if he had a quick sniff, just so he knew the way the wizard smelt? It was an outrageously erotic idea and his cock jumped in agreement.
“That feels so beautiful,” Harry gasped, arching his neck against Draco’s warm mouth. “Everything you do is so good...”
took over Draco's body. It was just too good, too marvellous. He embraced Harry by his shoulders, finding his mouth and kissing him while the pounding on his body got faster.
It was a freeing sensation. His whole body needed it, and he wasn't ashamed of doing it. Not anymore. He wanted it, needed it even. He was holding the base of Harry's cock with one hand where his mouth couldn't reach, moving in a steady rhythm. He let go for a moment, his hand still moving, and looked up at Harry.
He muttered thickly into Draco’s ear.
we have to stop and not do what we want. I'm going to be very honest with you... I don't have time do have a relationship. I have a Company to lead and I can't give a husband or a family the attention they would need, but if somehow we can make this work with the limitations we have, I'm up to have everything. I'm not in it to keep controlling myself every time I'm naked with you in my bed. I wouldn't want you to control yourself either - of course, respecting the boundaries we asserted on the first night. You won't be a regret. You gave me something no one else has given me before. And I want more of that."
His own... He could see his uterus, nicely formed. At the sides of it, a little under, were his testicles, way too small for an adult, which explained why he was so small and didn't grow to be Harry's height. And then, coming out from his uterus delicately, were his ovaries.
“Draco,” Harry said “normally when Lyra comes to stay we end up having take-away pizza which we’ll eat while watching reality tv. It’s dreadfully domestic, but you’re really welcome to keep us both company. It wouldn’t be the same without you now.”
Draco moaned with the image he received. He touched his nipple, caressing it and closing his eyes as he imagined Harry there with him. His body was incredibly sensitive because Draco barely touched himself. He was now burning, lust pooling inside him as if his heat had come earlier.
Harry felt his knot swelling even more. He couldn’t quite believe the size of his cock, and he was amazed by the reaction of his body to his omega mate. It’d never been like this with any other partner, and Harry knew it was due to their bond.
Draco couldn't wait to live all of those fantasies with Harry. He needed it, he wanted it more than anything. A big family, their love and lust knowing no end.
He faltered, unable to say more. Harry was a brave man, but he couldn’t look at Draco then. He was afraid of what he’d see in his big, grey eyes.
Harry wouldn't agree, though. He would never put Draco's life in danger for an “if”. Even if he actually got a baby in the process. He was too noble.
After almost an hour, since they had to take the boat back and all, they were finally at their hotel room. Draco just dropped his bag as Harry closed the door, and all but
He lavished all the attention and adoration that the lovely omega deserved, and Harry thought he’d never seen such a beautiful, lovely individual, so well suited to all Harry’s tastes. Hard once more, Harry ground his cock against the bed, heavy and ready.
Before Harry could knot him, he left his lap, finding a spot near him in the empty side of the bed, getting on all fours and putting his arse up in the air.
The second problem was... Draco would probably die alone. He wanted a mate, he wanted a family,
“I bet we'll begin again many other times, Harry,” Draco said, before kissing the man he'd like to be with for ever and after.
Draco licked the wound so it would heal, moving his body against Harry's hard cock.
“So fucking hot, Draco... You’re the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” Harry lavished kisses all his wife, all over her face and her mouth, moving his mouth down to her pert little breasts. Her nipples felt heavenly on his lips, hard, erect and wonderful. Pulling away he murmured into her skin.
“There's nothing around here, Harry,” Draco whispered, standing up. Her cheeks were already turning pink because of the heat. The sky was bright blue, not a single cloud in sight. She turned around. Beside her, there was a small square. There was a little statue of Christ the Redeemer on a podium, and a blue board with a globe and some words on the side. Draco puller her wand, casting a semi-permanent translating spell over her and Harry. Her eyes shifted a little, a very unpleasant sensation, before settling. Now, she could read ‘Square of the Middle of the World’ beside the globe on the board.
Harry smiled to himself as Draco marched out of his office, head held high. If he were being truly honest with himself, he had let work slack a little that week, and the telling off was probably deserved. He’d sworn that he wanted to remain professional at work when all he day dreamed about was getting Draco in that big double bath that he knew was in his hotel room that weekend, shampooing the omega’s hair, soaping up all of his body and massaging him with the most relaxing oils he could imagine.....
Harry rested his hands over Draco’s, his heart thrumming with love for the person that was in front of him, and the little baby growing happily inside of her...
And today, I’m honoured and happy to share with you the news that’s made me happier than anything else in my life. Draco is carrying our baby and in around seven months - give or take a day! - our baby will be born.”
Harry was surprised by Draco’s sudden change in attitude. He thought he’d understood what the omega wanted, what Draco wanted from Harry.
need to listen to people like that anymore? What we have is insurmountable... It’s perfect. You’re the love of my life. It’s not about that... You’re not pretending. You
Fidgeting, Harry drank deeply from the glass of lukewarm water beside his bed and dragged air deep down into his lungs. Neither brought him any degree of satisfaction. The ritual robes that Luna had dressed him felt farcical, like the regalia of a druid from some half-baked Muggle film.
He typed out a quick reply, his other hand idly stroking a drop of come around the head of his erection.
that word) still looked a little nervous. Harry wanted to put him at ease.
He knew then, that this was what it meant to be truly alpha, that this was what his body had been built for. To give his omega, his beloved, the baby he wanted. Harry felt the swell of his knot at the very idea.
“Obviously not.”
Draco couldn't believe in what Harry was doing... He never thought he could use
“I’d hardly expect a hair-brain such as yourself to notice the difference, Potter. There’s a myriad of subtle differences. The leather, the heel… No, love. I must have them
Harry was unaccountably nervous. He hadn’t thought Draco would agree, so when he disappeared, to get himself prepared, Harry wasn’t sure what to expect. After what seemed like the longest five minutes of his life, he entered the bathroom to find his husband.
Harry slammed his hips into Draco, and he felt pleasure rise within him, so slow, steady and deep. He heard himself whimper as he orgasmed; his head swam, his ears rang, and he shivered and shook as he lost himself, drowning under the waves of his orgasm. Harry saw white as he climaxed, his hips jerking as his prick spurting deep inside of his husband. Absently, Harry felt Draco tensing beneath him as he followed Harry into his pleasure.
“Don’t worry, Draco.” Harry said quietly, smoothing his hand over Draco’s hair. “That’s how it is with alphas... You know that. I’m stepping on Nott’s territory, his place of work. He’s not going to do a bloody
He was skinny, and soft, and his nipples were red and puffy from Harry's handling. His cock was once again soft, and he knew it could be seen as a big clitoris if he wanted to associated it as something else. His cunt was basically a slit starting a little after the base of his cock, and it was small and closed. He pressed a finger between the labia, finding the entrance and pressing a little inside. He shuddered, his mouth watering, but then he took off his finger from there. He cleaned himself again for good measure. And waited.
"Dinner with my parents was absolutely awful. My alpha aunt was there, and she made her point that her alpha daughter was
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry placed Draco down carefully, still feeling a little concerned he might tumble over again. Harry was a feeling a little cold too, and a long night with his husband in his arms was incredibly alluring.
Knew he had to put his arms around his husband; hold him, before his anguish made him collapse under the weight of his heartbreak. Harry knew he had to be strong for both of them, because that was who he
When she was ready, she came closer to Harry and asked:
Draco left the bed, slowly, trying not to wake Harry. He really needed to empty his bladder, so he tiptoed to the bathroom to do so. After, he decided to wash his face and brush his teeth, since he was already there, and sighed as his stomach grumbled. A rice cracker wasn't enough dinner, he supposed.
Draco’s breasts were small, but to Harry they were just perfect. Round and pert, Harry cupped them in his hand, loving their weight and smoothness next to skin. He intended to enjoy this intimate moment, and wanted to take his time.
The next month passed quickly for Harry. Hermione was getting bigger every time he and Draco visited, and on one momentous day she pulled Harry’s hand to her thickening waist, letting her oldest friend feel her baby moving.
I’d love to see some photos. If you want, I could send you some of myself...”
“Harry... I want to feel your come in me again... I feel so empty... So, so empty... I want you to put a baby inside me... Please, Harry... Do it.. “
Harry couldn’t help but come when he heard those words.
Harry collapsed, his body spent and his breath gasping. He pulled Draco close, and listened to the rocking beat of their hearts.
Draco turned, looking at a woman who was roughly the same height as herself. She had short, dyed blond hair, and a kid about five or six at her side, a little girl dressed all in pink.
"I'll meet you in my house so we can go together tomorrow?  Do we meet each other somewhere else?" Draco asked as soon as he arrived home. He wanted to ask Harry to sleep with him that day, but it would be suspicious if he left with the man from the building.
knowing what you’d been doing.”
“I’m only yours Draco... no one else’s...  No one else even comes close to your hands, your soft skin, your cunt... everyone will see these finger marks, and they’ll know exactly how rough you are with me...”
"Baby, oh my beautiful baby... I can't stop crying since you disappeared..."
Biting his lip, Harry wondered if Draco has any idea about how attractive he looked. Harry was well endowed, but he didn’t think that Draco would have any problem taking him fully. That might never happen, but surely fantasies were okay? He decided to play a little bit of role play with Draco.
Harry spied one of Draco’s ties hanging around the neck of one of Draco’s formal suits. He looped it around Draco’s hands and the wire of the bedpost, and each time his hands touched the smaller man’s, he felt his body tighten in pure desire. Draco’s fingers were petit and elegant, and he couldn’t wait to see them wrapped around his cock later that night.
He held himself up, touching his chest and resting his head on the sofa's cushion, putting his hand down. One of them pinched his nipple, hard, and as he was deciding either to touch his cock or his arsehole, Harry came inside of him.
“I guess it's too hot to wear robes here,” Draco whispered to herself again, following Wood again. They walked about five minutes to get to the hotel they were going to stay. It didn't look like a hotel, really. It was like a huge manor, coloured in baby blue, from gate to windows. From the front, Draco could count at least nine huge opened windows, and a huge door, also coloured baby blue. They entered and Wood walked to the reception, where a girl was sitting behind a wooden desk. She had many muggle appliances on her desk, and she seemed to understand him just fine. Draco got closer, listening.
“Clean yourself too, Potter. I won't have you smelling like sex in my last night at Venice.”
"I can't boil water, if that's what you're saying. I never cook. This kitchen was given in the hands of the architect and it's been exactly the same ever since," then a stray thought came to Draco's head as he sipped his coffee, arranging the sandwich delicately on his left hand. "It seems like you took my virginity and my kitchen's, too."
“It will get into your eyes if you don't put it on!” Draco tried to reason with a toddler, and although she knew she was being silly, she was sure Jasmine understood perfectly.
wizards.
Draco closed his eyes, imagining the day that Harry would fuck him in all his holes, fuck him in his cunt and pour his seed deep inside his womb. The day that Harry would fuck a baby into him, make him full like in their fantasy... Out of control, Draco came, his arse twitching around Harry, his walls grabbing him, pulling him inside as he moaned his lover's name over and over.
“Your body is magnificent, sweetheart.  I’m enraptured by it... I won’t push you further than you want to you, but know this. I’ve never seen anything in my life I’ve desired so much-“
Harry listened to every poisonous word this small-minded arse has dreamt up, thinking him more pathetic with every sentence.
Draco might have said 'yes', but Harry's mouth on him made his brain black out. He moaned loud, spreading his legs as far they would go, his hands grasping the restrains tightly so he'd have something to support himself. He wasn't as sensitive as the day before, because he was expecting it now, but he was soon close to coming.
“Draco, I know you’re upset,” Harry said quietly. “I can see that you’re trying, and failing, not to cry.”
. I've always had these thoughts in the back of my mind... Being called 'she' instead of 'he', being touched as if I was a woman, not just a weird boy with too many bits. Do you understand me?”
"He fucking stared at my neck. What a fucking jerk," Draco complained, throwing himself on Harry's chest and hiding his face on the men's body. "He noticed I was... He noticed my smell. I'm sure he's going to use it against me somehow. Fuck, can you help me forget this meeting?"
But at the same time, he was fascinated by the idea that Draco wanted to take things further... Always so shy about his body, so lacking in confidence about sex when they spoke, would it prove to him that he was more than enough, that Harry was so erotically charged by Draco?
Draco's throat got tight, and he felt like being sick.
But right now he was pleasuring his husband, and nothing was a bigger thrill than that. Every part of his body ached with want, for the release his body was craving. Harry stroked Draco’s precious arsehole, slowly pushing in the tip of one finger.
! , Harry! It's... It's... It's too much... I think... I will... I-- “ His eyes opened at the same time as his mouth, and he came, like an explosion in his body, his clear liquid coming out in a big flow of pleasure.
“No, mama!” Jasmine threw her new tiara on the floor, black, messy hair getting even messier. She was, as usual, dressed as a fine little lady, perfect green dress with apples sewn on it, and beautiful green shoes.
If there was a thing that Draco loved more than Healing and Harry, it was tradition. He wasn't the most traditional person ever, it would've been his father, but he still valued a good tradition. And it meant that they weren't to have sex until after their marriage. When Harry asked for his hand - to his mum, as tradition said -, Draco felt over the moon. Now, he couldn't wait for it, because he wanted to give in.
Of course, Harry composed himself as he walked towards Draco’s office. He wasn’t going to embarrass his lover by turning up half-hard, panting with need. This could well be purely professional. Indeed, that cretin Nott might be there... How very dare the man, using Draco’s first name like he was an equal partner in the business? Even if he and Draco were bonded mates Harry would
The chocolate was rich and bitter where Draco had placed it in his mouth, and Draco’s tongue was flickering, moving delicately and relentlessly against his own. Quite honestly, Harry was afraid to even move a muscle, so intent was he on enjoying everything. Screwing his eyes shut, Harry determined to let Draco continue his slow journey down his body.
Harry blinked twice. Despite his renown as the most famous short-sighted wizard to have ever lived, he was quite aware that things right before his eyes were not quite as he was used to...
Of course, Draco’s luck never held. The very second that Draco burrowed his nose into the material, the door to the door flew open and Harry strode into the room.
get it. If the places were inverted, Draco knew Harry would never trade his business or respect to have anything with him. And maybe that's why the alpha couldn't understand.
He’d not forgotten his promise he’d made to Draco, however. He wanted to protect his family, and still couldn’t think of a better way than their getting a dog. He’d talked to Luna, who had a superb understanding of animals both magical and Muggle, and Harry had chosen the breed of Bull Mastiff.
“A couple of touches and here you are on the want... If you weren’t so hot, I’d have half a mind to make you wait a bit longer. As it is...”
And with each passing week their baby grew and developed, warm and safe with its mummy.
. He bit back the words that he truly wanted to say though.
Harry was incredibly shocked to hear these words come out of Draco’s mouth. He felt guilty, too because he’d been so hard just moments before. He didn’t want anything to compromise Draco’s principles, and he didn’t want to pressure him.
He didn't know if he was going to be feeling like this after the sex. Or after today. But now... Now he felt like he and Harry could do this forever.
"Alpha..." he showed his mark, satiated, but now longing for emotional satisfaction. He wanted his alpha to cuddle and kiss him while the knot was still inside him.
One day, five weeks before Jim was due, she woke up to a wet bed. Ashamed, she thought she had pee'd herself, and looked at Harry hoping he wouldn't wake up.
He, then, felt bliss.
He was certainly excited; his cock jerked as he slid off Draco’s shorts and knickers, exposing her beautiful cunt to him; making him ache and burn with want.
“Yeah, but you bloody well know I'm
"I thought... I was clear?" Draco got apart from him, because it was difficult to think with Harry's face on his neck. "Let's go to my bedroom so we can talk more... comfortably."
His whole body vibrated with pleasure, and he flicked his tongue as deep as he could around Draco’s smooth tight hole. Leaving a final, smacking kiss there, Harry pulled out, satisfied that his lips had helped to slick up his husband nicely.
Harry stopped the moment Draco told him to. In all of his sexual life Harry liked to let the omega dictate the pace, and he wasn’t about to change now.
He showered and cleaned himself as good as possible. He was sticky not only with his come but also the slick from his cunt. He didn't think he would feel so much with just Harry's hand job and mouth. When he felt he was completely clean again, he waited, nervous, looking at the glass door that separated the shower from the rest of the bathroom.
Harry gasped with the intimacy and sexiness of the moment.
He could feel his husbands gorgeous little cock sticking up just for him, and as the tell-tale burning in the base of his belly started to build, Harry grabbed at the end of his cock. He arched his back, pulling away from Draco’s embrace. Grinding the head of his prick against that of his husband, Harry found himself losing all control.
"A family is always excited when a baby is coming. Aren't you excited about being a big sister, too?" Draco asked, looking at her questioning. When their orders came, he began eating excitedly, thinking about the possibility of spending the night at Harry's. He's never done that before, so it was a good opportunity.
He couldn’t do this. It had been five years since he had seen Draco last, and he was still heartbroken.
Harry held tightly to Draco’s hips, his mouth never leaving his husbands cock, riding though every moment of his orgasm with him.
Draco felt the urge to punch Harry on the arm, but he smiled to his mother, eyes locking with hers as if asking ‘please, no comments’. She seemed to understand, because she kissed him on the cheek, and did the same to Harry before sitting on the head of the table.
Harry found Draco and Jasmine in their room, looking quite comfortable and happy. Jasmine was fast asleep in Draco’s arms, looking very satisfied in her onesie.
“Umm... You’re making me insatiable Draco... This is some of the hottest, most intimate behaviour I’ve ever shared in my life. My body feels too big for my skin, like I’m going to explode... Do you trust me enough to come in the shower with me?... I want to wash you clean, not have anything between us...”
Harry felt his stomach twist in pleasure, felt his body writhe in insatiable longing.
Harry felt Draco shift underneath him and he took the opportunity to deepen the kiss, his tongue slipping into Draco’s warm mouth.
Harry was noisy. He snored. He sang loudly and out of tune and didn’t care who heard him. Harry was impulsive. Draco had caught him hiding Pygmy Puffs, pilfered from the Potions Lab.
Slowly, he went down the stairs, looking around.
“Umm... You like that, do you?” Harry whispered into Draco’s ear. He couldn’t help it, Draco was just too irresistible.
Harry looked at his husband, who really did look utterly wretched about the situation.
Three chapters in a day? Yes, yes, yes!
The lady was unfrozen by the Aurors and she immediately started to spout her poison. She screamed at the red haired witch, calling her a liar. She spat at Harry, and told him she’d wished
Draco kept looking at his phone, waiting for some kind of reply. It never came. He felt his eyes watering. He bit his lower lip as his heart dropped to his stomach.
His fingers deep in Draco, scissoring his marble white arse, and his own hand stroking himself to orgasm.... Harry knew it wouldn’t be long before he was coming.
Draco got up, stretching a little, her back hurting. Her breasts were still sensible, and bigger now, enough that she had to buy maternity bras too. She grabbed Harry by the hand and took him to her favourite shops. This time was faster, since she was used to buy boys clothes, and soon they were getting back home.
He smiled, and ran his fingers up and down the soles of Draco’s feet. This really was a treat (Draco was usually quite ticklish and precious about her feet) so Harry wasn’t about to refuse.
He could have kissed Molly for taking Jasmine for the night. Both of them were exhausted by her night time parties, and were well ready for an evening off. Harry felt confident that Draco’s self-image had improved massively in the last few weeks, and he hoped they were ready to resume a more intimate relationship.
"I don't want you to last long. I want to taste you like you tasted me. I want to make you come like you made me," Draco touched Harry's chest, kissing his neck and collarbones, going down until he kissed his abs. He rested his hands on Harry's legs, still kissing his stomach.
He looked down at his husband, wet and wrecked under the cascading water.
, not the
Harry wouldn’t have cared. He loved babies and wouldn’t have minded if Draco had got pregnant that same day.
But Harry Potter wasn’t ever a man to shop for these items. Merlin,
in every department.”
“Fuck, Harry... Yes... Yes, please...” He pushed his fingers through Harry's wet hair, his cock now hard.
Anxiety coursed through his veins and he felt sick with worry. He didn’t know what Draco’s parents were doing to do to him, and what Nott had planned. The alpha was a twisted, disgusting piece of work, and Harry didn’t know if Draco’s parents were just as bad. After all, the omega had seemed terrified, shaking with worry as he had left the ice-cream parlour. The thoughts swirled around his head, and Harry paced irritatedly up and down the room. He simply couldn’t get comfortable.
"They shooed me out." Draco whispered to Pansy, looking up at her with his feelings dying little by little. "I bet there'll be someone in my office on Monday."
“Oh, you beautiful creature,” he moaned, inarticulate with lusty thoughts. He knew he shouldn’t have such thoughts, but he loved how he towered over the slight body of the omega, loved how sexy Draco looked bobbing up and down in front of him...
. So he ignored it, closed the door behind him and walked to Harry's desk.

"I understand your worries, really. But although you are, indeed, older than me, I'm an adult, and I can deal with the consequences of my actions. I know that you don't want to make it into something more than it is, but I don't see
Harry was filled with a huge glut of love, and he wanted to share that with as many children as possible. They’d decided that they wanted lots of babies. They’d met late and wanted to focus on growing their family while Draco was still in the peak of his heats.
Harry took a big mouthful of the cheese on toast, which, while lacking in skill, clearly made up for any deficiency with its
“We should wash ourselves. I'm sticky and gross. You... You certainly can come a lot,” Draco teased, a tired smile on his lips. He was really happy. He felt his hips complaining because of the pressure, his legs and his cunt, but it all seemed worthy of everything. He'd do it again immediately if he had the energy to do so.
“Your cunt will be exquisite. It was built to bare a baby, it is the most wonderful gift you could have been given... I promise you, however you are made, we’ll fuck beautifully, and you’ll take all I can give you.... I promise on our wedding night, you’ll be surprised at the joy your body can bring you...”
He’d never got that reaction before, and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t absolutely thrilled. The idea of a fortnight without the bloody
"Please, let's do ours jobs now. In the night, we're lovers. I don't want to give up on you, Harry... But I can't just let go."
He moaned as Harry's hands grabbed him. On top of Harry like that, with him looking up to him with that lust in his eyes, his hands crazy on his body, Draco felt like the king of the world. In the past, he couldn't even imagine himself doing this, but now... Now it was like it was meant to be. They were meant to be, since the beginning.
Harry smiled at the omega in front of him, surprised that Draco had felt the need to ask, but then the effect of being in heat would do that to anyone. Hormones washed through their systems, making them soft and glowing, and making them revert to a more natural traditional version of themselves.
Harry laughed at how easy it was to turn Draco’s head. All it had taken was a few days without shaving.
There was his wife, fast asleep, holding their tiny baby, who was in a similar sleepy state. Harry would have stayed there, watching them forever but he knew that it wasn’t safe for Jasmine. He slipped a hand carefully, underneath her and slipped her back into her basket.
He hadn’t thought anything of his husband’s slightly softer lines, thinking that charitable dinners and three-course opera luncheons all had to end up somewhere. But he hadn’t really wanted to mention it, as he’d hoped to attend the Ball that night without being hexed into the middle of next week.
She finished her shower, drying her hair with the hairdryer that was in the bathroom and drying herself with a towel. She drank the potions she was supposed to drink all mornings to help her sustain her pregnancy, and redressed in the nightdress since she felt like it would be too humiliating to talk to Harry all naked.
, he wanted to eat me alive! I'd drop dead if this puppy grew as big as him!”
"Well, Mother, I can be a Potter. And I know I'll be forever a Potter, because he'd never shut me out.
Draco hit send, then he reread his message. He did it without noticing, but had he ever told Harry 'I love you' with all of the words? He didn't think so. And he just said 'ly' like it was the most normal thing to send his lover.
