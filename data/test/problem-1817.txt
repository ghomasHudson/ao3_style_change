“And it’s been ages since I last played against you. I’ve been missing catching the snitch from right under your nose,” Harry said, making the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch a little.
“Well, isn’t that lucky for you then that you couldn’t resist me?” Draco said, snaking his arm suddenly around Harry’s waist and pulling him closer. “You don’t even know yet all the things you would’ve missed,” he whispered into Harry’s ear, making Harry shiver.
Draco breathed in sharply as his utterly exhausted brain registered his true location, and he quickly shut his eyes tightly again.
“Of course they don’t know. No one knows. As if I’d wear the Invisibility Cloak just for fun,” Potter said, rolling his eyes and taking a few steps towards Draco. “Come on, let’s go!”
Harry gave Draco a mischievous smile and started suddenly tickling Draco’s sides, stomach and armpits.
When the shaking of Harry’s body calmed down a little, Draco pulled slowly back, took Harry’s hand and guided him to the bed. He took gently the other boy’s torn clothes off and cleaned carefully all the new, small wounds Harry had gotten with a wet towel. When he had removed the dust and dried blood from Harry’s skin, he helped Harry to dress to the clean pyjamas they had brought to the Room just in case one of them would forget to bring their own one day.
Ginny rolled her eyes. “At least swallow before Apparating,” she said, taking Harry’s arm and let him Apparate them to Andromeda’s garden.
“Well, that was a great pleasure again,” Blaise said as the huge doors closed behind them, preventing their curious fellow students from ogling at them any longer.
“Yes,” Ginny said in a low voice. “I mean, I feel like shit, but don’t we all right now?” she continued, laughing grimly.
I had planned to explain here a bit my reasoning behind Draco's actions and why I sympathize with him quite a lot in this story, but it seems like I already made Andromeda and Hermione say almost everything I wanted to say, heh.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean –” he said, still sounding somewhat uptight but maybe a bit more controlled. He had surely taken some sort of a mindfulness course before he had abducted Draco to live under his roof, there was no way he’d be able to go through this otherwise. “Was there something else you’d like to have?”
“’Course. We’ll just have to plan it a bit better as I’ll be at the Burrow, but I think I could sneak away with Ginny for a while or something.”
“Oh, so a couple of Death Eaters just took a hold of you and kept you still while Voldemort printed the Dark Mark on your arm?” Harry asked, making Draco flinch and look panicky around to make sure there were no eavesdroppers.
Harry gulped. Well, he hadn’t definitely been ready for that. To be honest, he couldn’t remember Draco being this open about what there was going on in his mind ever before, not even during their time together.
and the resulting accidental Horcrux that had created the connection between him and Voldemort. As far as Harry knew, Malfoy hardly had ever had anything to do with any kind of Horcruxes, and even if he had, it would definitely have nothing to do with Harry, so it was completely absurd to even think if there was a possibility that he and Malfoy shared some kind of connection.
Harry stared at Draco, looking flabbergasted. He was probably so used to seeing only the side of Draco who cared about nothing else but saving his own skin, no matter what. “Why not?”
Molly was silent for a while, clearly considering what to say next. “Oh, Harry, you know you can always be yourself in this house? I just wish you could’ve told us. We could’ve supported you both, we could’ve helped Draco to leave his family earlier –”
Even though Harry was extremely happy about the article and everything that had followed it, he was even happier about Ginny and Blaise. The thing between them had escalated quickly, and even though Ginny kept stubbornly saying they had just become very good friends and they weren’t really together together, they had started to spend almost all their free time with each other. Of course, Harry was truly glad for both Ginny and Blaise, but he couldn’t help feeling selfishly more excited about how much more opportunities the situation created for Harry and Draco to meet. Now they didn’t have to see each other only in the Room of Requirement, in a random alcove or somewhere outside at such place and such time no one had a chance to see them together. Now it was only logical for them to meet publicly from time to time because Harry, of course, wanted to hang out with Ginny and Draco with Blaise, so it was obviously absolutely necessary for them to learn to put up with each other on some level.
“Oh, forgive me, your Highness, I should have known the whole bloody doorway was reserved for the Chosen One’s exclusive use,” Malfoy snarled.
Draco blinked his eyes, confused. “And you would still want me to come to your side? After all I’ve done?” he asked feebly.
“Draco, it was better this way. You know it was,” Snape said, his voice sounding uncharacteristically sympathetic.
Then, the door squeaked open and happily babbling Blaise entered, very tense looking Draco following on his tail. Harry’s eyes met Draco’s, and he could guess the look on their faces must’ve been almost identical.
Harry tilted the bottle and took a small mouthful. The wine definitely didn’t taste good but, to his surprise, not too bad either. It was somehow sweet and flowery and had a strange, bitter taste in it at the same time. After his unfortunate experience with vodka, the wine was definitely a level up.
They looked at each other for a while, and Harry felt overwhelmed by emotions. Whatever bad had happened during the summer, it was all fine now, they were safe. They were back at Hogwarts, near to Dumbledore, and finally together again.
“Not admitting anything,” Draco said and came closer to Harry. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist and pulled him against his chest.
“So, what do you think?” Harry asked Draco, nervous. “Thought we could practise using this together before Christmas, I’m not that good at using a phone, either, because I’ve never had one. But I thought it’d be nice to be able to communicate somehow during the Christmas holidays as we can’t firecall or send owls to each other. Phones just don’t work in places with lots of magic, so we should go a bit further away from home when we want to send a message. But if you don’t like it I can return it, maybe it was a stu –” Harry went on babbling until Draco cut him off.
Harry chuckled and dragged Draco to the couch, snatching his glasses on the way. He sat down and pulled Draco to sit between his legs, Draco’s back leaning on Harry’s chest.
“We all can do different things and we all have our strengths and weaknesses. They don’t make us any more or any less worthy compared to other people. It’s only human,” Harry said. “You know, Muggles have justified genocides and wars by the fear of different ethnicities, skin colours and religions.”
“It’s about Montague, they’ve found him, and Headmistress said she needs your help, Professor,” Draco said, looking at his shoes.
Harry took Draco’s hand, pulled Draco close to him and kissed him, enjoying his soft lips against his and their bodies flat against each other. Only that Draco wasn’t kissing him back. Instead, he was shaking.
“Potter, you’re late,” Snape drawled as Harry entered his office and closed the door behind himself.
Suddenly, Draco could hear weird rattling noise behind his cell door, which made him jolt completely awake. Oh well, it seemed like they had decided to feed him before tomorrow after all. In vain, they already knew that Draco would not be able to eat anything.
“Harry, dear, would you like to have more coffee?” Molly asked as she noticed Harry was about to doze off.
“I can get it if it’s in the common room. I forgot my book and I’ve already eaten anyway,” Harry said and stood up.
Harry walked through the castle towards the dungeons, barely paying any attention to happily chatting students who passed by him. It had become a habit of sorts to him to at least try to clear his mind right before every session, though he knew he wasn’t succeeding in that very well. It felt like every session went only worse and worse the more the time passed, and Harry didn’t want to speculate how this session would go as his mind was already a big mess even before starting.
“Draco doesn’t know I know him to be a homosexual, and I prefer to keep it that way. He thinks no one knows, except for you, apparently, and I don’t want to freak him out. At least not yet,” Zabini said. “Anyway, the main reason I dragged you here is that I’d really appreciate it if you tried to take the first step towards Draco. As I’ve understood, the infatuation is mutual in your and Draco’s case.”
“Erm,” Harry said, dumbfounded. Now that he thought about it, he remembered that Ron and Hermione had told him more than a couple of times he was thinking about Draco way too often, but he hadn’t honestly thought there would be something suspicious about it. Besides, talking secretively to Ron and Hermione about his worry for Draco had taught him about some new and important things, just like about the Unbreakable Vow.
“Oh, sure. There’s not a drop of water anywhere at this party,” Malfoy said as Harry stared at him unbelievingly. “Taste it if you don’t believe me.”
Avoiding thinking about the Dark Mark wasn’t luckily the only thing that made Harry’s life feel somewhat normal, or even enjoyable from time to time. The lessons started as usual, and for once it was Harry’s time to shine in Potions as he had gotten a new old Potions book with interesting sidenotes, and there was no Snape attempting to make Harry fail with everything he was trying to brew. A totally new experience to Harry was Dumbledore’s private lessons, which, to be honest, made Harry feel a bit gloomy and serious afterwards. Although they were definitely a level up after last year’s Occlumency lessons with Snape.
Probably Harry’s favourite ordinary thing of all was flying. As he had been forbidden to fly and play Quidditch almost the whole last school year, he couldn’t get enough of it now. Whenever he wasn’t spending time with Draco or occupied by school things, he tended to sneak out to the Quidditch pitch with his Firebolt. It would have been even more fun if Draco could have joined him, but Harry didn’t even dare to suggest it this year. At least, he had always Ginny who was more than eager to go flying and talk endlessly about this year’s Quidditch tactics. Those Harry wouldn’t even be able to share with Draco anyway as he had been, to his surprise, chosen as Gryffindor’s new Quidditch captain.
“I won’t go back. I mean, they wouldn’t even take me back, not after the spectacle they organized for me.”
“I’m not talking about reckless risk-taking where you put your life in danger,” Molly said. “I’m talking about rationalizing your fears and taking chances that aren’t idiotic or irresponsible. In Draco’s case, yes, you’re right that there’s a risk he might go back to his parents. We can’t see the future, and we can never know the outcome of our decisions beforehand. However, it doesn’t seem very likely Draco would go back as there’s no more war looming in our future, Draco has many people who accept him completely as he is nowadays and you both have so much more support now, the support you would’ve needed already years ago. Day by day, Draco’s getting stronger, and the control his parents once had over him is fading.”
“Yeah, probably,” Harry said, even though he no longer bought that as an explanation. He was sure by now Dumbledore was trying to avoid him almost at all costs.
Hermione cast a worried glance at Harry. She had been even more worried about him than usually after his, let’s say a little bit difficult, summer and the outbursts after that. “No, I’m really okay, just a little bit tired, that’s all. Erm, so how did it go for you two?” Harry hurried to say, trying to get the attention away from himself.
“I think I’ve got a fair idea as there hasn’t been a day after you left that I wouldn’t have felt like I didn’t miss you or didn’t love you,” Harry said, smiling gently as he broke the kiss. “I don’t want to hide anymore. I want to call you my boyfriend in front of everyone. I want to be able to hold your hand at the Great Hall. I want to do this to you at the Three Broomsticks,” Harry said, starting to kiss Draco’s neck, making Draco sigh and tilt his head to give Harry better access.
Hermione looked at Harry with sad and emphatic eyes, as if she knew exactly what there was going on inside Harry’s head. And knowing her, she probably
“What makes you think so? I’m the second youngest and Ginny’s only one year younger than me,” Ron said defensively. “So, how did it go with the Muggles?” he went on and asked Draco smugly, a challenge in his voice.
"Exactly," Ginny snapped. “You should talk to him,” she continued more softly, looking Harry in the eye.
“Yeah, I don’t get why they didn’t tell even to us. We’re left outside all the time as if we were still some bloody kids,” Ron complained.
Not that any of that mattered now. Everything had happened in a flash, and Draco still couldn’t quite make sense of all that had happened in the afternoon. All the fifth-years had been doing their O.W.L.s, and everything had seemed to be just as usual, until Harry had suddenly passed out. Draco had instinctively almost leapt from his chair, wanting nothing but to get to the other boy and see that he was alright, but Blaise had caught his eye at the last second and mouthed him to stay put. Having regained consciousness, Harry had left from the Great Hall immediately, shaking violently and looking pale as a sheet. There had been a strange, suffering look in Harry’s eyes that had haunted Draco for the rest of his exam and made him lose his concentration completely.
“Malfoy,” Harry said coolly as he filled his mug again. The Slytherin was still an utter enigma to him. They had been on the opposite sides of the War, but towards the ending, something had changed. Malfoy had played a crucial part in the favour of Harry’s side, and when Harry had testified for him on the trials and returned his wand, they had managed to act almost exemplary civilized towards each other. Maybe that was what it meant to be an adult.
“What? Did I hit a nerve? Isn’t everything as sunshiny and rainbowy between you three as the media shows?”
one. Instead, there seemed to be several truths people believed in and followed faithfully. Technically, Draco would have had the opportunity to choose another truth and follow it, but by the time he had realised it, it had already been too late. He had already had the Dark Mark printed on his skin, proudly decorating his arm, and telling everyone what truth he had chosen to follow. He had been far too deep in the truth his parents had told him, and there had been no turning back anymore, not at that point.
As Blaise had become an important part of Harry and Draco’s relationship in a way, so had Ginny turned out to be an amazing support for Harry. Even though she loved to tease Harry, almost driving him over the edge from time to time, she never pressed him to tell her who he was seeing. Now that Harry was seeing Draco much more frequently, she used to help him to make it work smoothly. When sleeping with Draco, Harry had to wake up around 4 a.m. to be able to sneak back into his dorm without anyone noticing, but in the evenings Ginny could quite easily cover up for him. She even sent Harry’s and Draco’s mobile phones to Arthur so that he could charge the batteries for the Christmas holidays. Harry remembered vaguely Ginny saying earlier something about him deserving more happiness in his life, and now he could really see how she truly had meant what she had said. In between all her grinning and the mischievous glinting in her eyes, Harry could see a glimpse of a warm and soft smile every time they happened to talk about Harry’s ‘secret affair’.
“Would you mind if I borrowed Harry for a moment?” Ginny asked cheerfully, grabbing Harry’s arm, and yanking him up off his chair.
“Well, yeah, I – I just don’t think there’s anything between us. At least nothing more than a friendship.”
“Well, you could have warned the bloke,” Harry said in a low voice, feeling Draco’s breath tingling on his lips.
“Your thoughts steer your life practically completely. If you’ve got a lot of toxic thoughts inside your head, they may make you lose your sense of your own boundaries and you may let people treat you really, really badly, even for years. Why do people stay years in relationships where your partner assaults you? Because it has usually started gradually, and your brain has learned thought patterns that tell you it’s your fault your partner hits you.”
“Oh,” Harry said, having suddenly a bad conscience as he hadn’t bought anything for Draco. “I’m sorry, I didn’t have anything for you on –”
As they entered Harry and Ron’s room, Harry noticed Draco stayed back beside the door, looking a bit nervously around the room.
your footsteps this year. Anyway, I’m still going to keep my promise, of course, I’m going to make your year a hell,” Malfoy went on babbling.
Besides, why would people on the dark side even need trials? There was not even a hint of light in them. They couldn’t be cured.
Well, as Snape had already entered Harry’s mind various times without Harry’s actual consent, it couldn’t hurt too much to take a brief look at what kind of secrets Snape might be hiding. Harry took a deep breath, dunked his face into the Pensieve and let himself fall into Snape’s thoughts.
“Draco!” Ginny cried and jumped to Draco’s neck. “Are you alright? Why didn’t you try to contact me? I tried to ask
Besides, even if the dream had been true and Malfoy really had asked Harry for help, he had meant everything he had told Malfoy in his dream. He, Ron, and Hermione had really already
The whispering in the middle of the night when they both had been too tired to speak out loud but still didn’t want to waste their time together sleeping.
“Just Ginny,” Blaise said, smiling warmly at Ginny, whose cheeks had gone slightly pink. It was utterly strange to see Ginny getting almost speechless. If Ginny had had any kind of presumptions of Draco’s friend, Blaise was apparently behaving in a way she hadn’t prepared herself for.
They took the path that led around the lake, and the further away they walked the fewer students there were. People hadn’t apparently bothered to walk to the other side of the lake as there was more than plenty of place on the castle’s side.
When Valentine’s Day came, Harry felt extremely nervous. He said his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, who were sure Harry and Ginny were up to something because ‘no one in their right minds would skip a trip to Hogsmeade’. Harry explained he had no desire to meet Cho there meanwhile Ginny told them she felt still too heartbroken after her and Michael’s breakup. Hermione and Ron remained still clearly suspicious, but they left eventually after their short and seemingly dissatisfying interrogation.
It took a couple of seconds for Malfoy to gather himself before he rushed back to Harry’s side. “How dare you to point your wand at me you bastard. I told you not to touch me. Do I have to spell it for you, so your little brain gets it? DO. NOT. TOUCH. ME,” Malfoy said, fuming now on Harry’s side.
“Well, we got some information about our duties as prefects. And there are also other prefects, two from all the Houses,” Hermione started saying, wearily.
With Umbridge gone, it had been much easier to try to help the Gryffindors and Lovegood, and Draco had even managed to have a surprisingly profound conversation with Ginny only through glances. As Draco was some kind of an unofficial leader of the Inquisitorial Squad, he had told the other members to go and try to find more members of the DA, just to see if they could milk some more information out of them for Umbridge. The other Squad members had looked at him suspiciously, but Draco had assured them he could always handle a couple of Gryffindors who were tied with ropes.
,” an old-looking house-elf muttered as he descended the stairs. “Oh, Master has a guest with him!” the elf peeped and bowed deeply.
Suddenly, Malfoy pulled away shocked, as if he hadn’t realized before what he was doing and with whom.
spontaneously on Malfoy in the middle of the fight in their sixth year as Harry had regretted it immediately and would probably regret it at least until the end of his earthly life. And he had most definitely
Harry took a long breath in and closed his eyes. God, he should take a grip of himself as he knew he was now so close to repeating the mistake he had made the night Seamus had organized the party in their common room. It was just that now Harry wasn’t even drunk. It must be the Pepper-Up Potion. Or the lack of sleep. Or probably even both.
“It doesn’t matter that it’s broken. I don’t want to hide anymore,” Harry said, grabbed Draco’s hand, and pulled him abruptly into a gentle kiss.
Draco felt his legs becoming weak and his lips answering automatically to Harry’s kiss, his whole body humming with joy as he felt the so familiar body pressed against his.
When the Christmas holidays drew nearer, Harry and Draco decided to make some other plans, too, than just to celebrate Christmas at the Burrow. They both felt like getting away from the country for a week or two would be a good idea, especially as Harry had never been abroad in his whole life. They pondered different options for a while, but in the end, choosing a travel destination was quite simple as neither of them wanted to travel too far, and after the War, they both preferred a calm and quiet destination with lots of nature around instead of big and hectic cities. Draco wanted also to practise his Norwegian skills, so after scrutinising Norway’s map for a moment, they ended up choosing a little city called Alta in northern Norway as their travel destination. They booked a Portkey for the Boxing Day morning and started to read more information about Alta and Norway in general, which made Harry feel both nervous and pleasantly excited. The winters weren’t that warm in Scotland, either, but in northern parts of Norway it could sometimes get as low as -30 Celsius, which sounded so cold Harry could almost imagine himself freezing to death. And the sun. Harry was used to days becoming seemingly shorter in Scotland during the wintertime, but how was he supposed to survive a day in a place where the sun didn’t rise at all in December? Like how dark was that going to be?
Harry turned his broom to follow Draco, and, to Harry’s luck, the speed of Draco’s old Nimbus 2001 was nothing compared to Harry’s Firebolt.
In any case, Draco's feelings for Potter were something that could never be reciprocated. If Potter ever happened to fancy blokes, he could never fall for Draco. Draco had tried to hide his feelings so furiously that he had shown Potter only quite opposite feelings than his real ones. Potter was certainly 100% sure Draco hated him more than anyone, after all these years of cruel bullying. And on some level Draco really hated Potter. Sometimes it was just so much easier to blame Potter for causing Draco to feel these stupid feelings towards him and making Draco struggle so much with the path his family had laid for him. Without Potter, Draco would probably be able to meet his father's expectations so much easier.
Draco didn’t have to be asked twice. He took a couple of steps forward and pulled Harry into a tight embrace. As soon as Draco’s arms were firmly around Harry, Draco could feel him starting to cry against his shoulder. Harry cried almost silently, only sniffling occasionally as his tears soaked through Draco’s shirt and his shaking arms squeezed Draco tightly, as if he was afraid of Draco disappearing into thin air if he didn’t hold him tight enough.
This chapter is somewhat shorter than my chapters usually. Thought it'd be better to cut it here before Harry & co. go back to Hogwarts.
“Haven’t you thought about telling your other friends, too?” Sirius asked, sounding a bit worried. “It’s exhausting to keep secrets, especially from your best friends.”
“Jesus, Anne, let the poor lad enjoy his beer,” a young, brown-haired man with kind eyes said to Anne as he sat down on her other side. “I’m Chris by the way, nice to meet you,” he said, smiling and stretching out his hand to Harry.
That night, Harry had trouble falling asleep. When he and Ron had headed to their shared bedroom around midnight, Ron had started snoring almost immediately, while Harry had rolled around his bed for hours before finally giving up. His head was buzzing with thoughts so quickly he couldn’t even grasp hold of one of them to put it into words.
“Well, that was a warm re-encounter,” Ginny said, breaking the silence. Hermione shot a warning look at her before meeting Harry’s eyes, concerned. Harry could guess that his best friend had also caught Malfoy’s way of using the word
Luckily, the corridors were deserted as everybody was probably still eating, and Snape’s office was only behind a corner.
Draco took a deep breath once more, snatched the wand that had just been returned to him out of his pocket and Apparated to the Manor gates. The wards recognized him immediately and let him in through the old, squeaky gate. Draco was actually rather happy the day he got to go back to the Manor was a warm and sunny summer day as not even the Manor could appear too threatening when it was so light, the birds were singing all around the place, and different kinds of flowers in all the possible colours blossomed and filled the air with both delicate and exotic scents.
“Yes?” Harry asked quickly, the feeling of relief spreading all over his body as he realised Malfoy was still there.
“Here, let me take him,” Harry said, taking Teddy from Draco’s arms so that Draco could open the present.
“Our brains create a lot of thought patterns during our childhood and adolescence as the groundwork is laid then. If you’ve got a healthy and good childhood and adolescence, your brain creates a lot of positive thought patterns that form thoughts like
Harry really wanted to see Hedwig, but he was also in desperate need of some time alone. He visited the Owlery, petted Hedwig for a moment and offered her some treats, but instead of heading back in afterwards, he decided to take a walk around Black Lake.
Ron snorted. “If you weren’t concentrating while Hagrid was gone, I think we might have a little different understanding of the word concentration…” Ron murmured and Hermione shot a murderous look at him.
“Who are you?” Harry cried into the mist as loud as he could, and he heard his own voice echoing softly in an otherwise completely silent environment.
“Ron had a huge fit when he heard about that. Hadn’t seen him that… emotional in a long time,” Harry said, trying to lighten the atmosphere.
When Harry opened the door to the Room, he could find Draco sitting there by the table, reading a thick and ancient-looking book.
“We’ve talked about this before, the mead was an accident, he didn’t really try to kill Ron. And not even Dumbledore, not truly. And what could he have done to help me at the Manor? To attack against all the other Death Eaters all of a sudden? That would’ve gone well,” Hermione said, a bitter tone in her voice. “Actually, considering his position during the War, it really was a big thing he didn’t hand us over to Voldemort. It would’ve made Voldemort see him and his family in a good light again,” she went on. “All I mean is that he couldn’t be on Voldemort’s side, not wholly. But he was young and didn’t have much of a choice.”
As every Thursday, Gryffindors had Potions with Slytherins, which Harry wasn’t looking forward to at all. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking towards the dungeons when they heard Malfoy proclaiming loudly how Umbridge had given the Slytherin team permission to continue playing straightaway.
“What did you mean by not believing Draco has congratulated you?” Ginny asked as they walked towards a meadow nearby the Burrow.
“That went well,” Hermione said, and Harry rolled his eyes. “No, Harry, I mean it. Malfoy was sure you’d rise, but you didn’t. Did you see the look on his face? He looked so surprised and even… uneasy.
To the right, up the stairs, to the left, long straight corridor, up the stairs again… At the top of the stairs, Draco flinched and closed his eyes in surprise as the windows let natural light flood in. It had been more than two months since he had last seen something other than the flickering flame of a torch, and at first the natural light, despite the day being quite cloudy, was blinding.
As Harry was falling back to sleep, he started to recall the reasons that had caused him the hangover. He could vaguely remember coming back to the common room after dinner, and there had been some sort of a party. Seamus had persuaded him to drink… vodka? Or rum? He couldn’t quite remember which one. Or had it been tequila? Anyway, Harry had a feeling he hadn’t really liked being at the party that much at first, but after a couple of drinks, he had definitely started to enjoy himself. He could remember the light and happy atmosphere when he had been talking, joking, and laughing with his friends, the War and death forgotten at least for a little while.
”What did that mean?” Harry asked, shivering. Draco speaking Norwegian did indeed some strange things to Harry.
Ginny had been so lost in thought she startled a little when she heard someone talking to her. “Well hello to you too,” Ginny said, smiling mischievously. “You two looked just so cute and cosy as you snored and drooled on each other, so me and Blaise thought it’d be nice to give you some privacy.”
Harry turned around to meet Draco face to face. He gave Draco a short kiss on his lips, took his hand and dragged him towards the hearth and the armchairs.
“Don’t worry, mate, I made you a couple of toasts. You can eat them while we walk,” Ron said, handing toasts to Harry.
“It’s a yes, you dumbass,” Draco said, grinning. “Though I might reconsider if you ever happen to describe kissing me with the word ‘wet’.”
Draco chuckled. “Well, I’ve actually done that too, but I think I still prefer the apple shampoos from the Manor.”
“We thought it was better to keep it a secret. Only Blaise and Gin knew. And Dobby and Snape, but they got to know by accident,” Harry said. “And I was a bit scared of how you’d react. Thought you wouldn’t take it well.”
The Manor grounds were always so beautiful around Midsummer. Everything was so green, all the planted and natural flowers blossomed, and various types of birds sang endlessly, stopping only for a few hours at night.
“Ah, so, you have both said your farewells? Shall we go now?” Lucius asked, putting his arm tightly around Draco’s shoulder. “It was a pleasure, Mr. Potter,” he continued smugly, starting to steer Draco out of the room.
“Could’ve gone better. Though I think I wouldn’t have been able to do this at all if Granger hadn’t helped me,” Draco said, shrugging and looking at his lap. “I hope that’s okay. You know, Granger passing time with me,” he continued, biting his lip nervously.
Harry glanced at his friends apologetically over his shoulder before exiting the common room with Ginny.
When Harry’s back met the wall behind him, Malfoy pushed his chest and waist against Harry’s and took Harry’s arms, pinning them against the wall. Malfoy started kissing him heatedly, slipping his tongue into Harry’s mouth without hesitation. Harry felt powerless to struggle to free himself from Malfoy’s grip as he felt Malfoy’s body flush against his and Malfoy’s warm mouth on his as he kissed Harry passionately.
It was buzzing so much in Draco’s head his father’s voice sounded like he wasn’t in the same room at all.
Though it had never really been just Potter's appearance that drove Draco mad, and it made things so much more difficult. Some lust based on one's appearance would probably just come and go without pain, but Draco's feelings had been something deeper right from the beginning. To begin with, he had always envied Potter's close friendship with Weasel and Mudblood. Not that Draco wanted to be Weasel and Mudblood's friend, he envied just their relationship as such. Everybody could see how close they were to each other, how they trusted each other and how they stood for each other, no matter what. Potter was utterly, and quite often even stupidly, selfless and loyal to those people he truly cared for. Despite his erratic background being obliviously Wizarding World's number one hero grown up by muggles, Potter was always so benevolent, brave and he just seemed to know how to do the right thing. Or maybe it all was rather thanks to his background. A background that was really different from the one Draco had.
Draco came to a halt and turned to face Harry. “I’m not in a mood to talk,” he said coolly, looking still horribly tense.
Draco and Blaise were sitting on a red and white checkered picnic blanket that was full of all sorts of dishes. There were at least three different kinds of sandwiches, a huge fruit bowl, all Harry’s favourite candies from Honeydukes, a treacle tart and butterbeer. In the middle of everything, there was a small bottle of Firewhisky, about which Harry didn’t know who had managed to smuggle it into the castle. Probably Blaise.
And then their lips met, gently and cautiously. Harry’s other hand started running in Draco’s hair meanwhile his other arm was wrapped tightly around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer. Draco’s hands were wandering all over Harry’s body, starting from his face, lowering down to his shoulders, and finally running up and down Harry’s spine as if he was trying to memorize every single detail in Harry’s body.
As Draco opened the huge, dark mahogany doors he noticed his parents were already sitting there on the opposite ends of the table. They were both wearing completely black dress robes, the ones they usually wore only in funerals. The table was full of Draco’s favourite pastries and sweets, and there was a delicious-looking cream cake decorated with strawberries and blackcurrants. There were Draco’s favourite flowers, dark blue cloves, all over the room, and even the curtains had been changed to the dark blue ones to match with the flowers. Right in the middle of the table, there was a lighted one, white candle beside a framed picture. Draco started to walk slowly towards the table to be able to see better the picture, and when he realized what there was in it, he came to a sudden halt.
“Well, I might have reorganized my priorities a little,” Draco murmured, turning towards Harry so that their noses were touching.
Soon they both felt their stomachs grumbling loudly. Harry had no idea what time it was, but he was sure it was way past breakfast time.
“I can’t really tell you much about his private matters, but he was also kind of disowned. Got thrown out from his family for the same reason as I did,” Draco said, shrugging. “Without a funeral, though,” he added grimly.
think you had done something malicious to me,” Harry laughed, lowering his head over Draco’s and feeling Draco shaking with laughter against his shoulder.
On Friday, Harry and Ron packed hastily their rucksacks and left to Hogsmeade from where they would floo straight to the Burrow. Hermione hadn’t joined them as she had said she had something urgent to do regarding her new House unity campaign, and she would therefore need to see a couple of professors and check some books in the library.
“Of course it’s okay. Ginny asked you first anyway,” Harry said, trying to sound reassuring even though he did feel a bit uncomfortable, to be honest. He just couldn’t quite figure out why. “Truce, remember?”
“Of course,” Malfoy said, nibbling Harry’s earlobe. “Do you really think I didn’t notice how you watched me at school? Or this summer at the trials and when you returned my wand? How you’ve followed me, making sure you know my every single step?” he whispered in Harry’s ear and started lowering his hand slowly along Harry’s chest, over Harry’s stomach, ending up to Harry’s prick. To Harry’s very definitely erect prick. “I know you want me. Have wanted for years.”
proofs you have had something to do with their escape, you will answer for that directly to me,” Snape hissed venomously. “Now go. This doesn’t concern either of you.”
Harry felt blood rushing in his veins just like during their previous encounter on the train, and he grabbed Malfoy’s wrist before the Slytherin had time to walk away. Once again the Slytherin git seemed to freeze as Harry touched him and his mask dropped down letting Harry see the mix of despair and anxiety on Malfoy’s face. Harry stared confused at Malfoy before he got his voice back.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked, confused, and Draco pulled back a little like a scared animal. His grey eyes were storming with anxiety. “What happened?”
They were chatting lightly, joking and laughing, as they ate. Harry was feeling as if he was a bit tipsy even though the butterbeer Dobby had given them was definitely alcohol-free. If he had known earlier that being friends with the Slytherins would mean so much fun, he would’ve tried to befriend them much earlier. Or, well. He knew it probably wouldn’t have gone that well before this year.
Despite all Harry and Draco’s difficult moments, Harry felt like the happiest bloke in the world most of the time. When their friends had heard they were back together, they had seemed to be genuinely happy for them, and they had immediately made it clear Harry and Draco could be completely themselves in their company. At first, Harry and Draco had decided to keep a low profile as they were still so used to hiding and to the feeling that they shouldn’t show affection towards each other in public, but day by day, they became bolder. It felt so new and exciting to be able to occasionally hold hands in the corridors, sit next to each other at the Great Hall, and kiss each other good morning or good night regardless of who was seeing them. And when Draco had come to sit next to Harry on the couch in the packed common room for the first time, leaning to Harry’s side, wrapping his arm around him and nuzzling his neck, Harry had felt so happy he had feared his heart would burst in his chest.
“Harry, what on earth happened to you?” Hermione exclaimed as Harry sat down on the Gryffindor table, still covered by his own blood.
And oh god, how could Draco ever have let his parents make him believe kissing another boy would be horrible and disgusting? How could he ever have thought something that felt so perfect and made him feel so happy and complete would be wrong? Because it wasn’t. It couldn’t be. Not even all the Muggle gods and deities would be able to make him think otherwise.
“He came to talk to me earlier today. As for how he knows, I don’t really know. He just said it was kind of obvious or something,” Harry said. “You should ask him.”
“So, who exactly is this Dobby the house-elf?” Zabini asked as he ate blueberry tart, looking content.
“All right. Kreacher goes and makes a few sandwiches for Master, they’ll wait for him in the kitchen,” Kreacher said.
“Manners Potter, or I’ll have to give you a punishment,” Malfoy sneered maliciously, poking at the prefect badge on his robes. “As you can see, I, unlike you, have been made a prefect, which means that I, unlike you, have the power to hand out punishments.”
“Ugh, no, just the usual, waiting to get away from the Dursleys as soon as possible,” Harry said, groaning.
“This was the hat I gave to Dobby at the end of the fifth year,” Draco said, running his fingers on the material. “Why do you have it?”
Harry was still quite obsessed with Draco disappearing from the Map, but he didn’t know anymore if he truly wanted to know what Draco was doing. On the one hand, Harry felt like he ought to try his best to find out because of Ron and Katie and possible future victims, but on the other hand, he knew knowing might be too much, maybe even the end for him and Draco. Besides, one was always innocent until proven guilty, right? So, as wisely as ever, Harry decided deliberately to keep ignoring the giant-sized elephant even though his screaming and protesting mind didn’t quite want to play along.
“I knew you were seeing someone from another House, Ron and Hermione would’ve known if it was someone from Gryffindor. But I thought you were seeing a nice Hufflepuff or maybe a Ravenclaw. Draco sodding Malfoy, Harry, seriously. Well, at least he’s handsome, I’ll give you that,” Ginny kept mumbling mainly to herself. “And who’s the friend of his, the one who’d join us?”
“Yes,” Draco said sullenly. “Didn’t know how to tell you. I knew how you’d react, I honestly thought I had lost you.”
Harry startled. For a fraction of a second, he was sure Umbridge had discovered them, but then he could hear a familiar laugh. “Ginny! You can imitate her too well for your own good.” Harry said, laughing now as well.
“But once we do it, we have to plan it really carefully,” Draco said, with a serious tone. “You know we can’t just be mortal enemies one day and snog each other senseless all around the castle the next?”
in this context,” Harry snarled, feeling himself getting frustrated again. “What do you want from me, Malfoy?”
“Well, he said it feels a bit weird to be there as he can’t talk about anything magic related, but he said it still feels like people there can understand him and he them.”
“Hey, but Harry, didn’t you have something you wanted to talk about?” Hermione said, looking at Harry pointedly. Harry glanced at her murderously. He didn’t exactly fancy the idea to talk about anything else that night.
“Yes, you idiot. There’s hardly anything I wouldn’t do to annoy Weasley a little,” Draco said, grinning, as he tried to comb Harry’s messy hair with his fingers. “Can you imagine his face if we just started to snog right in front of him?”
However, now that Harry thought properly about his feelings for the Slytherin, he could sense a clear change if he compared to how he had still felt at the beginning of last summer. Then the mere thought or mentioning of Draco had made Harry’s blood boil in anger, disappointment, and bitterness, making him try to ignore the git completely and pretend there had never been anything between them. Those feelings were still definitely present inside Harry, but to his amazement, they were no longer targeted at Draco. Harry was angry at Draco’s parents, Voldemort, pureblood fanatics, all the gods and deities and maybe even at the universe itself; simply at everything and everyone he could come up to blame for making his and Draco’s path so difficult. But he couldn’t find himself being angry at Draco, not anymore.
“Fancy seeing you here,” Harry heard Draco Malfoy’s familiar voice drawling suddenly next to him. Harry startled and spilt water all over the table.
Because Draco knew now his values had changed a lot over the past months. The things that had seemed to be important a year ago felt now something so trivial, and he found it every day harder and harder to see everyone and everything through the pureblood hierarchy. Even his priorities had gone through some drastic changes, and somehow inexplicably the Boy Who Lived had become the centre of his world.
Draco was silent for a moment, looking pensive. “I don’t think so,” he said finally. “But if I didn’t go to the Muggle group and if Andromeda hadn’t taken me to her home, I think I’d already be back at the Manor. I’m not a strong person, Harry.”
The day was bright and sunny, and there wasn’t yet a hint of the upcoming autumn in the air. Harry closed his eyes for a moment and enjoyed the feeling of the sun kissing his face.
Harry and Draco jumped as far away from one another as possible, both looking dishevelled with half-open shirts, tousled hair and swollen lips.
Malfoy chuckled a little before leaning his forehead against Harry’s. Harry closed his eyes, put his arms around the other boy’s waist, and pulled Malfoy firmly against him. Malfoy pulled slightly back, which made Harry snap his eyes open. He stared into Harry’s eyes, grey eyes sparkling. He lowered his hands to Harry’s chest and started pushing Harry slowly backwards, his eyes never leaving Harry’s.
“Yes,” Harry said, his hand still feeling the form of the ring through his shirt. “The ring wasn’t even his, to begin with.”
“Harry, stop, he’s not worth getting into troubles,” Hermione screamed as Ron put his arms around Harry’s chest, trying to pull him away from Malfoy.
“Well, that admittedly sounds a bit weird,” Ron said, frowning. “Malfoy’s mother wouldn’t insist Snape making an Unbreakable Vow if she didn’t think Malfoy would be in a really serious danger.”
They both froze for a second before Draco’s mouth found Harry’s lips again. “We don’t have to answer the door,” Draco said, pulling Harry tighter against himself as if to support his words.
“Draco,” Harry whispered back and kissed Draco gently. “You know, I might have a place in mind. For us to meet, I mean,” Harry said, breaking the kiss but leaving his forehead against Draco’s.
“So, do you have any plans for this summer?” Hermione asked Harry, trying to sound cheerful as she, Harry and Ron were sitting in the deserted common room. The sunny weather had tempted everybody to go outside, but Harry wasn’t really prepared for seeing so many people being happy and carefree when his own mood was quite the opposite.
“Here,” Draco said, placing a cup on the sofa table in front of Harry, making Harry’s eyes snap open. “Oh, sorry, I didn’t realize you had fallen asleep,” he said as he sat back on the couch, a cup in his hands.
” The voice repeated, whispering quietly into Harry’s ear. Even though the question could be interpreted as an accusation, the voice didn’t sound accusing in the slightest. Instead, it was rather… sad and disappointed. Or maybe hollow, somehow resigned to its fate.
“Erm, things might’ve escalated a bit. I think I might’ve kissed him,” Harry mumbled as he felt himself blushing furiously.
And even if all this was just wishful thinking and there would actually be nothing after death, it would always be much better than his present state. He wouldn’t need to feel pain anymore. He wouldn’t even understand he was gone.
Harry turned his gaze to Draco. This was the first time in weeks Draco opened up a little about what was bothering him.
to think about how pitiful and utterly helpless he felt right that moment. He could worry about that later. Potter didn’t hesitate to wrap both his arms tightly around Draco’s waist again, and soon Draco felt the familiar, revolving and squeezing sensation, as if he was forcibly stuffed through a narrow pipe.
“It was good to see you, too. You’re always welcome to join us again,” Chris said, shaking Harry’s hand once more before Harry and Draco stood up.
When Ginny had left Harry’s home after they had come back from Andromeda, Harry had barely time to sit down and turn on the tv before Hemione knocked on his door and stormed in with two bags of takeaway Thai food.
“Why have you brought me here?” Draco asked wearily as Harry folded the Cloak and tucked it into his robe pocket.
“Now you’re speaking gibberish again. Charge? Battery?” Draco asked, looking at his phone, utterly confused.
“’Course now. What did you think, tomorrow when it’s rainy and cold again?” Ginny said, kicking her brother gently in the shin. “I mean, we’ve got to stock up on vitamin D as we still can and all.”
“Mother,” Draco said, bolting upright as he saw his mother entering the cell. “What are you doing here? How did they let you in?”
Harry huffed and turned to look out of the window. Soon Harry could feel Draco wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist and putting his chin on Harry’s shoulder.
“I envied them, too, I think,” Harry said, and to his surprise, it felt quite good to say it out loud to someone for the first time in his life. “They had such a big family and I had no one as I don’t really count the Dursleys as my family. Then I had Sirius for a few years, and then he left me, too. I dunno, I suppose my childhood was a bit lonely.”
“Neither have I. Even though he’s usually always angry with me,” Harry said. “Do you think he’s really not going to tell anyone?”
Harry crawled quickly off Draco, and Draco stood up immediately and started to pace towards the castle without saying a word to anyone.
The contents of the basket were no disappointment this time, either, as they consisted of a pile of turkey sandwiches, a blueberry tart, homemade toffee candies and a few butterbeers. This time, though, there were no roses, to Harry’s relief.
Harry broke off suddenly. As he and Draco had turned towards the door, they both noticed they were no longer alone in the room as there was a tall wizard with long, blond hair, completely black robes and a sneer on his face standing right in front of the door.
Draco was sitting on his bed cross-legged, trying to read the Advanced Arithmancy book, though with poor success as his mind didn’t quite manage to concentrate on anything. All the eight-years had been divided into small rooms with only two beds and desks, and as Draco had been paired with Blaise, he had gotten to keep the room himself completely for his own use so far. Even though there were definitely no distractions or noise, Draco struggled a lot to be able to keep his mind on his studies.
Harry had to send the last message really fast before he had time to change his mind with his word choices. He knew Draco would call him a sap, again, but he just couldn’t resist writing something emotional.
Slowly, Harry took a long breath in, turned around, and started to walk away from Ginny and Draco, step by step. He didn’t manage to walk far, though, before Ginny grabbed his arm and made him stop.
“That sounds actually a great idea,” Hermione said. “Fresh air would do good so that you two can't sleep the whole day away,” she went on, shooting a meaningful look towards Ron and Harry.
Hermione flushed and smiled at Harry. “Well, anyway, I think you should talk to your mystery bloke and ask him what’s going on between the two of you.”
Harry grabbed his bag and exited Snape’s office as quickly as possible. He didn’t stop when he got out. Instead, he let his legs lead him without further thinking.
Harry understood now why Draco had taken the Dark Mark, he really did, but he couldn’t pretend it didn’t matter. Because it did. Harry could barely stand the feeling of knowing Draco was now imprinted by a person who had already taken so much from him and was now trying to take Draco, too. Frankly, it made him scared as hell. Last year he had still thought Draco could simply just step aside and change sides, but with his parents being in danger, that probably wasn’t a plausible solution, at least not for now. And, eventually, Draco would have to face a situation where he would have to choose between his parents and Harry, and Harry had no idea which Draco would choose.
Harry gasped sharply. “I – I have no idea what you’re talking about,” he said, sounding so untruthful even a troll could tell he was lying. Of course, Malfoy had gossiped to the Slytherins, it had all been just one big Slytherin scheme, and now they were going to, what, blackmail Harry?
Ron had turned red and he took a step towards Malfoy, but Harry seized Ron’s arms and dragged him backwards. Harry looked Malfoy coldly in the eye. He couldn’t stand the situation any longer, Malfoy acting as if he hated and despised Harry. Maybe he
“Don’t you even start. How could you have understood me when even I didn’t understand at all what there was going on inside my own head?” Draco said bitterly. “But do you really mean it? That you have forgiven me?” he went on, sounding tentatively hopeful.
Harry looked like an utter wreck. His clothes were dirty and torn, his hair was even messier than usual, his eyes were red and swollen, and he was shaking violently. He looked so small and weak as he stood there, shoulders drooping and arms folded across the chest.
“Er, no. Potions have never really been my strength,” Harry said and grimaced. As if Malfoy didn’t know the lack of his potions skills.
“Hey, I’ve got something for you, too,” Ron said, digging his bag. “Here!” he exclaimed eagerly as he found an opened box of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavour Beans. “Sorry, got a bit hungry on our way back. Studying French is hard work.”
“You never learn, don’t you?” Draco said, sighing, as he gave Teddy to Harry nevertheless and opened the baby’s fingers gently from around the strand of his hair. Watching Draco trying to make Teddy let go of his hair, Harry got an odd feeling he would also like to reach for Draco’s hair and touch it, just to see if his hair was still as soft and silky as it had been over a year ago. “I should cut it,” Draco continued suddenly.
Andromeda took the teapot and started to hustle around the kitchen, humming some sort of a lullaby. It made a warm feeling spread inside Draco’s chest; it felt good to be taken care of even though he wasn’t even sure if he deserved it. Probably not.
“Hey, just try to relax, okay? I meant it, it really is okay that you’re coming as well,” Harry said. “Besides, they’re all your friends as much as they’re mine.”
“You just envy Harry for all the attention he gets. You still don’t get any, even though you’ve tried so hard for years. It’s quite pathetic, you know.”
Because Draco was relatively sure he could feel the soft mattress on the bed, smell the clean sheets that were wrapped tightly around him, and for the first time in a long, long time he felt like his body was pleasantly warm from head to toe.
“Oh, that was a good idea. Thanks,” Ginny said, looking pleased. “Are you still going to see Draco tonight?”
Ron’s face turned red of fury, and he stepped forward, trying to grab a hold of Malfoy’s robes. Harry had just enough time to stop him by taking a firm grip on his friend’s shoulders.
Harry considered Draco’s words. Following the auroras moving in the sky, he could definitely see where the belief Draco had mentioned came from. It looked like the auroras were rejoicing and dancing across the sky, not knowing or caring about the sorrow and misery below them. Harry gulped, feeling his throat tight all of a sudden. Who knew, maybe even his parents were there. And all the others he had lost. Maybe they had come there to greet him and show him that they were alright and happy, wherever they happened to be.
of all people would be pure torture. Not that he and Draco would’ve promised Snape to break up, but Harry still didn’t like the idea of Snape poking around his brain and possibly seeing something too… private.
“Oh god, Draco,” Harry moaned, dragging the blonde nearer to him and tilting his head to give Draco better access.
Malfoy laughed softly against Harry’s neck and let finally go of Harry’s arms. Harry put his hands instantly to Malfoy’s waist and started tugging the hem of Malfoy’s shirt. He laid his hands against Malfoy’s warm, soft skin, feeling thin hairs below the Slytherin’s navel.
Harry took a long breath in, trying to make himself calm down. “With all due respect, Professor, I think Draco can make his own decisions,” Harry said levelly, making himself look Snape straight in the eye.
“Go and talk to him,” Ginny said, sounding worried. “Please. He’ll talk to you,” she went on as Blaise and Hermione joined them, looking at Draco’s receding back, bewildered.
Harry was quiet for a while, feeling lost of words. “I’m sorry,” he said finally in a low voice, and as he couldn’t come up with anything comforting to say, he decided to wrap his arm around Draco and pull him closer.
“They don’t like magic, or rather, they can’t stand it. They made it really clear as soon as they noticed I was magical, and it was far earlier I knew myself.”
Slowly, Draco turned his gaze away from Harry and started to walk towards his father, who was now grinning triumphantly.
“No, you twit. I said I haven’t told anyone and won’t tell without discussing it with you first. Just told her I’m bent,” Harry said, shrugging.
“Nah, probably just partly. I think it has more to do with Ginny being his little sister, I mean, he kind of freaked out even when you were seeing Michael, remember?” Harry said, turning his gaze to Ginny.
“Hm, okay,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes but luckily dropping the question of the Durleys’s way to treat Harry. “But how could someone not like magic?”
“It’s nothing, let go of me,” Harry said, panicking and trying to jerk his arm away. Malfoy ignored him and rolled Harry’s bloody sleeve up with a fast, eloquent movement.
Finally, after the longest first week Harry had ever had at Hogwarts, Friday arrived and allowed Harry to have a little rest. Before that Harry had one detention left, the one that had prevented him to attend the Keeper tryouts. The night had fallen when Umbridge finally thought Harry had learnt his lesson and let him go. When Harry left Umbridge’s office, he could walk just around the first corner before he had to lean against a wall for a moment. His scar had started to hurt abruptly during the detention and now also his hand was bleeding and throbbing worse than after the previous sessions, both making Harry feel dizzy. He squeezed his eyes shut and tried to concentrate only on the coolness of the stone wall behind him.
Draco took a deep breath in, smelling the morning dew in the air. He was shaking a little as the morning was rather chilly, or maybe Draco was just recovering from all the adrenaline that had been running through his veins for the whole previous day. Now it was the first time in about twenty-four hours he had time to really sit down and think about all that had happened.
Harry would have loved to fly a little more, but his numb fingers and wind-bitten cheeks were painfully disagreeing with him. “Yeah, fine,” Harry shouted back at Ginny and turned his broom towards the ground.
Harry came all too soon, feeling unable to control his body at all. He would’ve felt embarrassed if Draco hadn’t come just a second after him, collapsing heavily on Harry.
Probably, Harry couldn’t. To be fair, he had been all too occupied to fight Voldemort in one way or another almost every single year during his adolescence, so he didn’t have the slightest idea of how it was to be a normal, teenaged boy, getting wasted on a house party.
Harry pulled Malfoy against him so that Malfoy was laying on him, their limbs entwined tightly together. Malfoy’s head was resting on Harry’s chest, and Harry could feel Malfoy’s hair tickling slightly under his jaw. They fell into somewhat bittersweet silence as they watched clouds floating slowly by.
Harry felt Draco’s body freezing suddenly. “I’ll never come back, mother. I can’t,” Draco whispered, sounding hurt.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t dare to open his mouth as he was quite sure the only thing that would come out of it would be embarrassing sobs. He was so close to tears now.
As Draco sipped his tea and regarded the nocturnal garden, his thoughts started to wander again. Sleepless nights made him always recall the times when he hadn’t been able to fall asleep at night as a child. Not being able to sleep had always made him anxious as somehow the darkness of the night made his fears and sorrows feel so real and oppressive, and he just felt so, so alone. Every time he hadn’t been able to fall asleep, his mother had somehow sensed it and come into his room. Call it a maternal instinct or something. Even though those nights had always started with anxiety, they had ended up being one of Draco’s favourite memories from his childhood. During the days his mother might have seemed to be quite cold and distant, trying to raise him a proper young pureblood man, but during the nights she had been something completely different. She had taken Draco for short walks on the Manor grounds, they had asked the house-elves to make them hot chocolate with marshmallows, they had built a fort of pillows and blankets, and sometimes his mother had just held Draco, combing his hair and humming songs he had never heard before.
“I know,” Narcissa said. “I don’t want you to come back, I know you’re doing so much better now and that you’re safe,” she went on, her voice so full of pain and vulnerability Harry wouldn’t have believed it to be Narcissa if he didn’t see her right before his eyes. “But I miss you so much, my son.”
“Oh, for Merlin’s saggy balls, this might be one of the weirdest things I’ve ever done,” Draco said, amazed.
They walked past the Room three times, both thinking about their own idea of a cosy common-room-like place. Harry was feeling a little giddy as he had no idea how the combination of their thoughts of a common room would be like. What did you get combining red with green? Yellow? Harry grimaced at the thought.
Hearing Malfoy using the reference to Sirius, with or without knowing, for the second time during the week made Harry see red. He pulled his wand out of the pocket and pointed it at Malfoy’s chest.
“Oh, fine, you insufferable git,” Draco snarled, apparently attempting to look annoyed but he couldn’t quite manage to make a serious face.
“Ugh, and I didn’t get to use make-up or dance for the very same reasons. Even waltzing was seen as something so sinful I didn’t get to take part in the dance lessons our school offered,” Anne said, rolling her eyes. “How about you, Harry? Any weird stuff happened at your childhood home?”
Malfoy followed Harry cautiously and closed the door. His eyes were unreadable when he turned to look at Harry in the eye.
Now that Draco mentioned it, Harry probably had not. He could see the Milky Way clearly crossing the sky, and there seemed to be thousands and thousands of small, bright dots, all twinkling at them.
Draco sighed heavily, turned to his side, and fortunately managed to fall into light sleep in a few seconds.
But Potter ignored Draco’s question and stared determinedly into the strange Auror’s eyes. “Show us a way out of here so that nobody sees us.”
Malfoy looked at Harry suspiciously. Then he seemed to decide that Harry didn’t appear to be a threat at that moment, so he sat cautiously down on the ground next to Harry.
“It’s so good to see you both. You should’ve told me the eight-years don’t have to stay at Hogwarts during the weekends, you could’ve come for a visit so much earlier,” Molly said, letting go of the boys.
The weekend and the first meeting in order to organize secret Defense lessons gave Harry something else to think about. He didn’t still know if he liked Hermione’s idea, but he could admit there definitely was a need for proper classes, especially if, or rather when, they one day had to fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters.
For starters, Draco seemed to have a thing to Potter's deep green eyes and his black and always-so-messy hair. Even though Draco was used to comment nastily on Potter's appearance, Draco thought Potter had always been the most beautiful boy he had ever seen with his stupidly pretty green eyes and tousled hair, and even when he was wearing his cousin's old muggle rags. Draco couldn't help the feeling of wanting to absorb every little detail of Potter and his body. He wanted to try how Potter's hair would feel like if he could run his fingers through it, how soft and warm Potter's skin would feel like under his fingertips, how right Potter's flat chest would feel against his own, how well their lips would match with each other…
But Harry didn’t care about fairness. Instead, he was enjoying his advantage far too much by trying to find new spots that would make Draco squirm even more desperately.
“So, you’re trying to say there was no way Malfoy would’ve been able to leave his family at the end of the sixth year?”
“I thought I heard you coming,” Narcissa said, making Draco startle as she came quietly into his room.
“I didn’t say you did, just wondered. Ferret’s never like that, he has always something to say, likes too much his own voice,” Ron said, lifting his hands defensively.
“No, I’ve already admitted it’s a losing battle to fight my dear mother’s Permanent Sticking Charm,” Sirius said, laughing hollowly. “Just wondering how different routes one’s life can take.”
“It is. I can see both of you are missing each other, and Draco’s being miserable because he thinks you think he’s betrayed you,” Blaise said. “Just let him explain.”
“Don’t. You start to sound like a broken record, or how did that saying go,” Draco said, smiling indulgently. “That’s actually one of the reasons I fell in love with you.”
and moth-eaten mattress, counting the grey stones on the wall for probably the hundredth time as it seemed to be the only activity to keep him sane. The cell he was locked in was actually at the Ministry, which was a bit strange as he couldn’t figure out who in their right mind had come up with an idea to build there cells that reminded so much of some medieval torture chambers.
Draco had always loved this time of the year. Some people considered winter to be just something depressive and grim, and all they could see around them was death as many of the birds had left to the south, days had become significantly shorter, trees had lost their leaves and flowers had disappeared. Instead of death and misery, all Draco could see was comforting peacefulness that radiated from the sleeping nature. Everything was just sleeping, gathering their strength to feel alive again for the upcoming spring and summer.
They fell into silence, both lost in their own thoughts. Harry wished he could just concentrate on the moment, he really did, but the fear of losing Draco or having something happening to him had started to pop into his mind more and more frequently. He tried to remind himself that they were only teenagers attending school. What could possibly happen to them when they were at Hogwarts? Besides, there was always Dumbledore. Dumbledore would never let something bad happen to either of them.
As if getting angry because someone had thought it to be ‘just a could’, the green stripe got brighter and faster, starting to wave slightly as it moved forward. Little by little, more and more stripes appeared in the sky, filling the sky with green, red, and purple as they made their way through it, some of them going almost straight, some making curves, and some making even some odd circle-like forms.
Ron raised his eyebrow questioningly but, to Harry’s relief, refrained from saying anything. They picked hastily up some leftovers and hurried towards the dungeons.
Draco nodded absently, even though he knew Potter couldn't see him. He turned his gaze back to the sky and tried to distinguish whether the red spots remained at the same height or whether they were slowly coming down. He was so focused on following the red spots that he didn't even notice they had come to the shore of a small, deserted island before the boat thumped against the shore rocks, causing him to almost fall overboard.
“He’s alright, though it feels like I have two roommates instead of one as Ginny practically lives in our room.”
“That sounds a good idea,” Hermione said, approving. “It goes well with Expelliarmus and there’re still some who don’t master it yet, so we could practise them both at the same time.”
been up to something. And there had been no harm in that Malfoy wasn’t extremely hard on the eyes, either. Objectively speaking, of course.
“Blaise is still abroad,” Hermione said, biting her lower lip nervously. “Did he have anyone else he trusted, besides you and Ginny?”
Soon they were a mess of tongues and lips and limbs entwined with each other. Harry could feel Draco’s chest hard against his and both of their hearts hammering wildly. Their touches had become bolder as they were now groping each other everywhere they could reach. Harry’s hands found Draco’s arse and, oh, he hadn’t known someone’s arse could feel so good and how squeezing it would make them both groan and move even closer to each other.
The closer Saturday came, the more nervous Harry felt himself. At first, the Room of Requirement had seemed a perfect idea for a meeting place as there would be no bitter coldness nor fear of getting caught. Then again, Harry realized this would be the first time he and Draco would actually be alone somewhere inside, in a closed room, without any distractions. The thought made Harry feel both thrilled and anxious at the same time. They had only agreed to meet, but they hadn’t decided what they’d actually
“Don’t lie to me!” Harry was yelling now. He felt like his eyes were burning, as if he was on the verge of tears. “How could you do this?”
Draco telling Harry how the War wouldn’t have to break them apart, and how the War wasn’t theirs at all, to begin with.
“You must be joking, right? Parkinson’s been chasing after Malfoy since the first year. At least,” Ron said incredulously.
“Nonsense,” Ginny said, first waving her hand nonchalantly and then beckoning Harry to follow her. “C’mon, let’s go.”
“It was actually alright, I mean, I think I needed someone to, erm, hit me in the face, so to speak.”
Harry hadn’t had any idea how spending the night with Draco for the first time could feel so much scarier than fighting the Hungarian Horntail last year. He wanted Draco so much his body seemed to go all numb, and when he tried move his limbs, it felt like they weren’t his at all. Besides, he was still quite worried about doing something that would make Draco shut down. What if Draco just freaked out and left? Harry took a long breath in, gathered all his Gryffindor courage and took Draco’s hand under the blanket.
It was the beginning of October, but the weather was still unusually warm in Scotland, and to the delight of all students, the first weekend of October happened to be a particularly sunny and warm one. Harry, for one, was happily sitting in the eight-year common room, talking with Ron and Hermione. As the weather was so beautiful there was hardly anyone else inside the whole building, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had managed to occupy the most popular purple-coloured couches by the hearth. The atmosphere was light and easy, and Harry could feel himself starting to doze off, listening to his friends’ stream of conversation.
Narcissa looked almost exactly the same as a few days ago with her lifeless hair and dark circles under her eyes, but there was still something else that bothered Draco. The expression on her face looked like a studied mask that was impossible to read. Other people wouldn’t probably think anything about it, but Draco had seen that look on his mother’s face so many times in his life he knew it could only mean she was trying to hide something ominous.
“So, has your boyfriend sent you anything? We’re that far from Grimmauld Place the phone should be working fine,” Ginny asked.
They walked in silence for a moment, regarding the frosty grass. It felt good to be back at Hogwarts, even though Harry hadn’t wanted to leave Sirius alone at Grimmauld Place. It had just happened too much during the Christmas holidays, so Harry felt quite relieved to continue living the mundane, school-filled life again.
“Dunno. Just kind of realized I know nothing about it. Except for the aristocracy and hierarchy based on the blood,” Harry said, trying to shrug nonchalantly.
At first, Harry spotted Ginny and Luna who were talking animatedly with some seventh-year girls Harry didn’t recognize. Feeling too tired to try to get to know new people, Harry continued scanning the room until his eyes fell on Ron and Hermione who were talking with Neville, Dean and Parvati.
“It’s an ancient pureblood tradition to shut someone out from the family and the pureblood society in general. The family organizes a funeral, with flowers, pastries and everything, for the person who is going to be shut out,” Hermione explained. “When the ritual is over, you’re basically dead to them.”
Draco sighed. “Harry was doing something in Umbridge’s office, and a bunch of Gryffindors and Loony Lovegood were standing guard and they got all caught. Umbridge went somewhere, I don’t know where, with Harry and Granger, and I let the others go. Haven’t seen any of them since then.”
“Ron, should we go in and get some more juice? And see if there’s any snacks or something? It’s quite important to remember to eat something salty during these heat waves,” Hermione said, nudging Ron’s side and seizing the empty carafe.
“You’ve smuggled firewhisky into school? Wouldn’t have believed of you,” Draco said, raising his eyebrow.
“Might have a crush on one, rather handsome Gryffindor, and want to stay on his good side. We Malfoys are pretty cunning and selfish, as you’re well aware,” Draco said and kissed Harry.
Harry sighed heavily and explained everything he knew about the Horcruxes: how Voldemort had learned to create them, how many of them he had created, where he had hidden them, about the Horcrux hunt with Ron and Hermione, and about Harry having been a Horcrux Voldemort had never planned to make.
Harry knew that Ron might be right, but he didn’t want to admit it out loud. The Dursleys had never shown him any signs of love and they had never given Harry anything but Uncle Vernon’s and Dudley’s old, holey clothes. The last time Harry had seen the Dursleys had only made him want to get away from them as soon as possible and never come back, although his aunt and cousin had shown a tiny bit of fondness for him when they had said their farewells. But it was nothing compared to what Ron, Hermione and even Draco had, and, to be honest, Harry had no idea how it would feel like being raised in a family where you would feel loved and wanted at least on some level.
“Yeah, see you in a bit,” Harry said, grabbed his coat, and both he and Ginny waved their goodbyes to Sirius as they exited the room.
Another thing Draco was almost sure about was that he was right there where he was supposed to be, in the path that was meant for him, if he happened to believe in things like destiny. And
Ginny huffed. “I don’t understand how you can stand their pointless bickering. I’m absolutely done with it.”
“A bit,” Harry said, staring at the canopy with empty eyes. “Was it all real? I mean, everything that happened yesterday,” he asked, hoping that at least some of it would’ve been only a dream.
Suddenly, someone knocked on his door, making Draco startle as no one had shown any interest to pop into his room this school year.
“What? Why not? We were supposed to look for some new Quidditch stuff for our next matches!” Ron exclaimed.
They uncurled themselves from each other, stood up and started to look for their clothes. Once they both had got dressed, Draco came to stand in front of Harry and put his arms around Harry’s shoulders.
Harry wanted to object but refrained. They both fell again into silence for the rest of the class, and this time the silence between them felt relaxed and somehow amicable.
Phew, now there's only the epilogue left, which I'm planning to try to post on  Wednesday or Thursday. I hope you've enjoyed the story so far, it's definitely been a lot of fun to write!
Harry flushed slightly. “Couldn’t you call him by any other name?” he groaned. “But yeah, I think so. I’m actually going to see him now.”
Draco looked at a bit nervous and speechless-looking Harry and sighed heavily. “Sorry. I’m kind of practising telling more openly about my thoughts and feelings. My mind healer tells it helps. And the group.”
“Dunno, probably just going to stay at Grimmauld Place,” Harry said. As all the Death Eater trials were over by now, there wasn’t much to do. Or, well, of course there
“I thought you would,” Harry said, sighing. “When you said you’d be dogging my footsteps this year, were you referring to him?”
Before Harry had time to even consider what he was doing, he stood up and let all the pent-up rage erupt at the smirking git by grabbing his collar and slamming him harshly against the wall. Malfoy seemed to freeze surprised by Harry’s sudden reaction. Their encounter hadn’t probably proceeded the way the Slytherin had expected, and for a split-second Harry thought he was seeing something like despair and anxiety flickering behind the all too familiar Malfoy mask. Malfoy’s stormy grey eyes locked with Harry’s deeply green ones, and neither of them seemed to be able to move or breathe.
“I’m glad everything turned out the way it did, even though Mr. Potter didn’t deign to be present in your trial,” Narcissa said, trying probably to comfort Draco in her own way.
Harry scanned the room, trying to find some familiar faces. It seemed like almost all the eighth and seventh-years were there, which made the rather small common room feel horribly crowded and too warm.
When the last day before the summer holidays dawned, Harry was outright brooding despite the beautiful and sunny weather. His friends tried their best to cheer him up, telling him it wouldn’t be a long time until they saw each other again, and Harry tried really, really hard to pretend like he wasn’t feeling as bad as he actually was. He knew he had been a difficult friend, not only to Hermione and Ron but basically to all his friends. He was just so, so tired. And definitely not looking forward to going back to the Dursleys.
? What’s going on? Malfoy’s the most dangerous and most protected prisoner here, he has no right to wander outside of his cell, he must –”
And Draco blamed himself, had blamed every day since he had left Harry at the end of the sixth year. It was no wonder Harry was acting so distant. Actually, even having Harry testifying for him in a letter form had been much more than he had been expecting. He didn’t know how his life would have turned out to be if he had had the strength to stay with Harry, and actually, it felt quite useless to even ponder that anymore. He had made his choice and stuck with that. To be honest, it all felt still so blurry somehow, and he wasn’t sure, not even today, which path he should have chosen.
“’Course, I’ve just got you a Christmas present that takes some time to learn to use,” Harry said as he handed Draco his present, wrapped in Ginny’s snowflake wrapping paper.
Harry shrugged. “Just called me a selfish prat, nothing out of the ordinary,” Harry said and hesitated before continuing. “Look, I get it if you want to end this. Snape did have a point there, I’m setting you in danger.”
“Yeah, I can get it. I’d have said you’re mental if you had told me last summer I’d start calling Draco my boyfriend this year,” Harry said, laughing hollowly. “Though honestly, I kind of like him, a lot. And Blaise is rather nice, too.”
When Weasley and Granger began to say their goodbyes to Potter, Draco stopped listening and fell back into his own thoughts. He was utterly confused by how much effort the trio had clearly put into saving him. Or well, not just
“I just… Look, just be careful with Umbridge. She can be unpredictable. I already knew she’s a nutter, a
“Is it because you don’t get to play this year? Harry, it’s going to get better, maybe McGonagall could talk to Umbridge,” Hermione said, tentatively.
“Some of them, yeah,” Harry said, laughing at Draco’s reaction. Not that he would be that much of a vodka drinker, either. “I think I should have a bottle of Ogden’s in my room, we could go and get it.”
“Extinguish fires,” Harry said, shrugging. “The thing is, most of them are men, though there are some women as well, especially nowadays, and they have a tradition to make calendars with pictures. To raise money or something.”
Harry pocketed the present and drew Draco closer by putting his hands on Draco’s waist. “Thank you,” he said softly against Draco’s lips.
“That’s alright. You can have all the time you need, and when you’re ready, you know we are here to support you,” Hermione said softly, radiating so much fondness and warmth Harry felt unbelievably happy to have a friend like her. “Have you told Ron yet?”
Harry was quiet for a while, trying to understand what on earth Zabini was explaining to him. “I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Harry said again, this time meaning it.
Molly looked at Harry, eyes slightly shining with tears. “You’re right, Harry. I had almost forgotten how fast you all were forced to grow up,” she said sighing. “But you still care for him?”
And Harry tasted, taking a huge swig at once. Malfoy had been right, it was vodka, but there was no way Harry would admit it to the git. He made himself swallow the liquid, feeling his throat burning and eyes filling with tears.
“Yeah, what was that all about? Ferret looked speechless for a moment, as if you had done something,” Ron commented, bemused.
Draco rolled his eyes annoyed focusing again on the doors that lead into the Great Hall, "May I kindly remind you that it was
“Draco?” Harry said tentatively as he noticed Draco was lying on his bed, his face turned towards the wall.
“Sounds like an excuse to me. I’d guess your friend Granger would be able to tell the answer to my question right away.”
Incredibly, they made it to the castle somehow. They entered the entrance hall and made sure there was no one else there.
¡SPOILER ALERT! A book about Engelv’s own experiences about growing up and coming out in a Jehovah’s Witness family. Engelv’s experiences actually inspired Gardell to write the Jehovah’s Witness character who followed Engelv’s real-life experiences quite a lot.
It felt like heaven, to be drunk and seduced by Malfoy. To be drunk on Malfoy. Hehe. God, why hadn’t Harry done neither of these things much, much earlier?
“To Sirius,” the other three said in unison, raising their glasses and taking a sip. Harry was so unused to stronger liquors Firewhisky almost spurted out of his mouth, but he managed to swallow it eventually.
“No!” Granger said, almost panicky. “I just thought that because there isn’t much support available for people with the background like yours in the Wizarding world, maybe you’d like to try some sort of Muggle support group,” she continued hesitantly.
“Probably not. But just so you know, I’m not offering this stuff to every passer-by,” Malfoy said, shrugging and turning around. “You coming?” he asked and glanced Harry over his shoulder, his grey eyes twinkling and blond hair waving slightly.
“You should really ask Dumbledore to do something,” Hermione suggested, and not for the first time. “It’s horrible how they treat you. It’s not right,” she said, biting her lip worriedly.
“No, it doesn’t,” Draco said, turning his eyes to Harry. “Some people might feel their loved ones’ presence when they look at the starry sky or listen to a flowing river. Where else would we go if not somewhere in nature? It’s the most peaceful place I can think of.”
“Okay, now I do want to know what you’re hiding from me. What’s going on?” Ron asked curiously. Both Ron and Hermione turned their gazes to Harry.
“Thank you,” Draco whispered sleepily, kissed Harry’s forehead, and let his body and mind finally relax completely.
“So the problem here seems to be that Snape’s not exactly the one to go by the rules,” Harry said gloomily. “Why couldn’t Dumbledore just teach me? I’m sure he’d be far better than Snape.”
“Then stop talking and just kiss me, you git,” Draco said, smiling and pulling Harry back into a long, tender kiss.
“Harry, you look happier today,” Hermione said, pouring pumpkin juice into her goblet at breakfast the next morning.
There hadn’t been even any new encounters with Malfoy until one Thursday morning the git had quite clearly got up on the wrong side of the bed. When Harry was entering the Great Hall with Ron to eat a hasty breakfast, Malfoy was getting out at the same time. He glanced at Harry with a sullen expression and shoved Harry deliberately with his shoulder.
“It’s always so peaceful here,” Ginny said, regarding the garden and its various trees and flowers as they walked towards the front door.
“Who is it, Draco? Is it me whom he has ordered you to kill?” Harry snapped. “Or don’t answer that, it doesn’t really matter. I know you’re trying to kill someone from the Order’s side, anyway.”
“Harry,” Harry said, shaking Chris’s hand and looking at him curiously. Chris was probably a few years older than he and Draco, and his warm, brown eyes and the gentle smile on his lips radiated so much benevolence Harry could now understand how Chris buying drinks to Draco could’ve been seen purely as friendliness. “I’ve heard about you,” he blurted out.
agreed to it, and Draco wouldn’t have been able to leave them. Not even if he somehow miraculously had found the courage to leap to the opposite side.
“What fine? Is the Chosen One really this easy to tame? I had wished for a bit more challenge you know, as I promised to be
“I wasn’t the one who started the whole alcove thing,” Harry said, flicking Draco’s forehead with his finger.
“Master was rolling restlessly around in his sheets, and Kreacher is quite sure Master was screaming the name ‘Malfoy’. Might Master have been screaming the name of Narcissa of the noble and honoured House Black? Or maybe of someone else in her family?”
“Oh?” Harry said. He found it almost hard to breathe now as he was feeling somehow so relieved about getting to know his godfather didn’t dislike Draco. In fact, it seemed to be quite the opposite.
Harry started to laugh, too. “Or Dobby when he tried to ask very discreetly if I knew with who I was passing time in the Room of Requirement the first time he saw us together? He looked at me like I had gone mental.”
Harry gave a slightly high-pitched laugh and took Draco’s hand. “C’mon, we’d better go fast before our limbs go all numb.”
Harry didn’t know which one of them started it. They both took a step towards each other and leaned forward, closing slowly the small gap between them. Harry’s face was only inches away from Malfoy’s, and he could feel Malfoy’s warm breath on his lips. The kiss was tentative and timid at first, Harry’s lips barely touching Malfoy’s. It felt like a game, both of them wanting but neither of them brave enough to take the next step. Finally, Harry couldn’t help but press his lips more firmly against Malfoy’s, giving completely into the kiss.
When Harry had just seized the door handle, someone opened the door from inside, making Harry jump a little.
Draco’s mother’s case had been a much easier one because of her rather passive role during the War and thanks to Harry’s testimony. She had been ordered to stay at the Manor on the same conditions as his father, though her sentence was ordered to last
“Hard to imagine me and Malfoy ever having got on that well,” Harry muttered. He felt like he really wanted to tell Sirius that he and Draco actually got on rather well now, but he didn’t want to do that without having asked Draco first.
And before Harry had time to register what was happening, Malfoy swung his legs on both sides of Harry so that he was sitting on Harry’s lap, straddling him. Harry gulped.
They landed collapsing roughly on the ground on the shore of Black Lake. It was actually the exact same spot as last time, though this time it was much colder there. Some of the trees had changed their colours from green to different variations of orange, red and yellow, and Harry could nothing but just admire them, even though the grey and cloudy sky didn’t really flatter them.
“C’moon, Potter, have a drink with me,” Malfoy said and showed Harry a really expensive-looking bottle of white wine.
“Yes. Let’s just go and sit –” Harry began, looking around. “— over there,” he continued, pointing at a bench that was hidden behind some bushes and therefore quite well out of sight.
“Well, maybe you weren’t, but that doesn’t change the fact that you set a good example to other students. It’s a pity Malfoy had to ruin that with his actions.”
“Wait wait wait, does Dobby know about you two?” Ginny asked, pointing at Harry and Draco, who were now sitting rather stiffly next to each other on the couch.
“I knew you were a self-centred fool, but this goes beyond me,” Snape hissed venomously. “Did you think at all the danger you’re putting Draco in with your actions?”
Ginny sighed heavily. “I know, it’s only a couple of months since the War. But Harry, you know I can’t wait for you forever.”
“Oh, that’s really nice of you, Dobby will be thrilled. Send him greetings from me!” Hermione said, and Harry squeezed her hand once more before exiting the common room.
This chapter seems a lot like fluff without plot, but I promise there really is a plot somewhere underneath there :D
it? Talk to me!” Harry snapped, taking Draco’s face between his hands, and making him look at him. “Please, don’t shut me out,” he said, almost pleading now.
Harry looked at the bottles. He had already had rum and tequila so there was only vodka left. He seized the bottle of Absolut and read the label. “Vanilla? That sounds, um, interesting.”
“I’m not hungry,” Draco heard himself saying even though the food next to him smelled absolutely delicious. He knew he was being childish now, but he had no desire to act nicely towards Potter.
The school corridors were flooding with happily chattering people. Most of the exams were behind, summer holidays were right around the corner, and even the sun seemed to be celebrating along with the students, shining brightly on a cloudless sky. The light and cheerful atmosphere engulfed everybody, letting them dive into the sense of upcoming freedom.
When Harry’s feet met the thin ice cover for the first time, he felt like wanting to back out and rush back to his pile of clothes. Instead, he gritted his teeth determinedly and stepped on the ice. He could barely feel it before it broke under his feet, rattling a little as he walked through it.
And he didn’t. Instead, he started to stare at the instructions on the board, face completely expressionless.
"I really didn't see that coming. If only had I known about Mudblood's hidden, secret sides before…" Blaise said bemused before glancing at his own date, Daphne Greengrass in slytherin green dress robes, with discontent on his face. Not that there was anything wrong with Daphne, but this time Granger might have drawn a longer straw. Or probably even the longest at the whole school.
Not that Harry wouldn’t have any real reasons to feel grim or grumpy. It was actually quite the opposite, and one could say that his summer hadn’t exactly been an ideal one. Dementors, hearing at the Ministry, Prophet’s articles and constant nightmares had all been messing with his head, and no matter how much he tried not to think about them, they came always swirling back with emotions that made Harry feel like drowning. He hadn’t even had time to process Cedric’s death on the Triwizard Tournament before all of the summer’s incidents had come pouring out one after another. Maybe that was the reason why Cedric had been, and still was, one of the main characters in the nightmares that made Harry wake up screaming as in major pain and agony. Even Dudley, as obtuse as ever, had found Harry’s nightmares as his sore point and started poking at them every once in a while to make him riled up. It felt just so unfair how someone could speak so lightly about everything he had gone through as if his reasons to wake up screaming every night were just something petty and childish.
“It’s your decision, and yours alone,” Andromeda said firmly. “You have the right to decide about your boundaries and who you want to have in your life. However, I think it might help both of you if you talked with him.”
“I don’t like Lucius Malfoy either, but he has an equal right to live just like everyone else. People shouldn’t play gods, it has never resulted in anything good,” Hermione said.
“Tell me if you need anything. And you can ask Kreacher for whatever you want,” Potter said, sounding a bit awkward now that they were no longer in an acute danger.
“How were your holidays?” Harry asked. As fast as the question had left from his lips, he could feel Draco tensing.
Potter. To be totally honest, Potter might actually be Draco's main reason to participate in the Ball. Not that Draco would ever admit it to anyone, not even to himself. As a Triwizard Champion, Potter must be on display all the evening having everybody's eyes on him. Only this time his stupid Gryffindor courage and dumb luck wouldn't save him like during the first Tournament task. The git, clumsy as ever, had simply no taste at all and wouldn't certainly survive the opening dance with his two left feet. The humiliation seemed to be inevitable for the Gryffindor, and Draco was really looking forward to witnessing that occasion. And, who knew, maybe help Potter to make himself even more embarrassed in one way or another.
“Where’s Ron?” Harry asked, sitting down next to Hermione and opening the other bag. He hadn’t eaten anything after the sandwiches Ginny had brought him, and the food smelled so delicious it made Harry’s stomach grumble.
“If you could just listen to me,” Draco said, trying to take Harry’s hand, but Harry snapped it away.
“I’ve kind of gotten used to it,” Harry said, shrugging. “I don’t usually even hear them doing that anymore.”
P.S. I was really struggling with the word 'applely' in this chapter (like fruit --> fruity, citrus --> citrusy, mint --> minty etc), and I've got no idea how it sounds in English. I didn't find 'applely' in any dictionary and Grammarly didn't recognize it, but Google gave me some results with it, so I let it stay. Let me know if you come up with something better!
“And you should listen to him. Nothing has changed,” Harry said softly, stroking Draco’s silky hair. “Come here, sweetheart,” Harry said, standing up and taking Draco’s hand to help him up as well.
Draco didn’t answer, but the someone still turned the door handle, opened the door slowly, and peeked into the room.
When he had arrived at the Room, Draco and Zabini had already been there, waiting for him. Everything had felt surprisingly smooth and easy as Zabini had sat down on one of the armchairs, while Harry and Draco had gone to the couch. Draco had laid down so that his head was resting on Harry’s lap and soon Harry’s fingers had found their way into Draco’s hair.
“Are you really okay with me joining your company?” Draco asked in a low voice. “I could make some sort of an excuse and stay inside if you’re feeling uncomfortable.”
As long as Draco's unconscious had hinted about being gay, as long had it hinted about being bent for Potter. Draco didn't even know which was worse. At first, he had explained to himself that his constant desire to get Potter's attention arose from the git's irksomeness that made Draco's blood boil. Actually, Potter didn't usually even have to do anything to annoy Draco, the bastard's bare existence could be enough of a reason to make Draco react. Draco had longed for Potter's attention ever since they both had started at Hogwarts, and at first annoying Potter had felt like some kind of a crusade for Draco. He had wanted to repay Potter for humiliating him in front of the others by not accepting Draco's friendship in the first year, or so he had explained to himself. Gradually Draco's lonely crusade had started to include also other, more complicated feelings than pure hatred and bitterness. If it ever had included only hatred and bitterness in the first place. At some point, it had become clear to Draco that he didn't really want to rile Potter up to make him suffer. Draco just wanted Potter to notice him for reasons that Draco hadn't really let himself to ponder.
“Enough, Harry. We won, fair and square,” Ginny said, smiling triumphantly after landing on the ground, Ron following right after her.
“Well, I actually do have something for you,” Harry said, feeling Draco’s hands slipping under his shirt.
“Ginny charged my battery again,” Draco said. “We’ll be able to talk to each other more than during the Christmas holidays, right?”
Harry had now a clue about how hard this was for Draco, so he really didn’t want to upset him. Harry wasn’t too excited about telling anyone, either, let alone letting the Prophet know. And he meant what he said, he
Harry eyed Zabini, feeling still suspicious. “I can’t promise to do that,” he said hesitantly after a moment. “But I promise to think about it.”
When Draco deepened the kiss, biting Harry lower lip and making it bleed, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Draco pushed Harry to lay down on the bed and followed right after him, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Draco whispered fervently he wanted to feel Harry inside him, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. When Harry pushed into Draco, making both of them moan, Harry couldn’t think about anything else. Not even after, when they were both breathing heavily and feeling their bodies tired and sweaty, Harry couldn’t think about anything else than Draco.
Harry tried to smile at Hermione, but the look on his face looked probably more like a forced grimace than a smile. “Thanks.”
“Of course I do but I might forget to give it to you if you go on harassing me like this,” Draco said, trying to sound annoyed but failing at it as he couldn’t make the wide smile on his face fade.
“So Malfoy’s practically a living dead now to his family and all the pureblood families who still follow the pureblood traditions,” Ron added.
as he had absolutely no idea what he wanted or how he felt. When had he even been supposed to have time to think about something like that? “Yeah, why not,” he grunted finally reluctantly as he couldn’t come up with any reasonable excuse to say no.
kind of bullying or taunting, and it would’ve been a suicide mission to try to debate with her when she was in her speech-mode. Harry started to eat his now cold food as his thoughts wandered back to Malfoy. It seemed like he couldn’t read the Slytherin at all. Malfoy had always felt predictable, in a way like an open book, but now he had become some kind of a puzzle. Or maybe Harry just had never noticed that all he had seen was just a tip of an iceberg, and there really might have been something more under the surface.
When Draco came to the kitchen, he began hastily to open the kitchen drawers. He needed something, something sharp enough. Anything would do at this point.
“Mm-hmm,” Ron muttered knowingly. “The next time you go out together, he’s going to try to take the initiative properly. Just mark my words.”
“As if you could. You’re such a mother hen,” Ron said, snorting. “I mean it only in a good way,” Ron hastened to continue as he saw Hermione raising her eyebrows disapprovingly.
“I checked there’re no lessons here today,” Draco said as he pointed at the door with his wand, locking it with Colloportus.
“Well, we three are practically only children in our families, so I think it’s actually Ron who’s supposed to be the one with the most experience here,” Hermione said.
Speaking with Ginny and Hermione had helped somewhat. However, Ginny was the one with the experience of being possessed by Voldemort, so she definitely knew what she was talking about. Harry’s dream hadn’t reminded Ginny’s experiences during her first year at Hogwarts at all as he didn’t have memory gaps nor found himself abruptly in some peculiar place. He was rather sure he had been in his dormitory for the whole time when Arthur had been attacked, so there really was no way Harry would be the culprit. But if he wasn’t possessed, what had happened to him then? He was pretty certain his dream wouldn’t be considered a normal one, not even in the Wizarding world.
They didn’t move for a moment. Harry’s arms were tightly around Draco and his face on Draco’s hair as they were trying to steady their breaths. Draco’s hair was tickling Harry’s nose and he just smelled so good, like apples and summer. Harry felt like he could wrap himself in Draco’s smell, never more needing anything else.
Harry, still dazed because of the kiss and the sudden loss of touch, looked at Malfoy confused. “You’re not or you cannot be?”
“Mm, as much as I appreciate this, I know you care,” Harry said, pushing Draco gently on the chest. “And that’s fine. Honestly.”
“I could ask if Fred and George came up with something. Ferret would be quite a good test subject for some new product,” Ron said, grinning.
And so, Harry had found himself in a huge garden in the countryside in Seamus’s family’s summerhouse with a bunch of other Hogwarts students and fresh alumnis who all were desperate to get intoxicated.
, Draco had started to think that maybe there was a tidbit of sense in Blaise and Ginny’s rants. They had gone through so much, he and Harry, so it’d be crazy to throw all that away because of a small, idiotic quarrel. Well, at least Snape had become happy as he had noticed the icy atmosphere between Draco and Harry.
“It doesn’t matter, I still have to kill someone soon. If I don’t, he’s going to… he’s going to kill me and my parents,” Draco said as a sudden new wave of sobs hit him. “I can’t do it… I can’t… kill anyone,” he continued in a strangled voice between sobs. Draco tried to get a hold of himself taking a deep breath in. Then, before Harry had time to back off, Draco raised his gaze a fraction and noticed Harry in the mirror, lurking behind the door. Draco froze completely, and the breath hitched in his throat. Slowly, he turned around, and Harry stepped properly into the room.
Hermione had returned to her book, and Ron and Harry had settled down to a discussion of different Quidditch moves when Harry saw from the corner of his eye someone with blond hair entering the Great Hall.
Draco opened the present really carefully, apparently not wanting to tear the wrapping paper. Harry made a mental note to tell Ginny his mystery boyfriend had appreciated at least her transfiguration skills.
“Just some students from different Houses,” Harry said, shrugging and acting nonchalant. “Anyway, there’s a Ravenclaw girl who may think there’s something between me and her, so she kind of kissed me at the end of our practice.”
Draco sat down on his bed and felt the material of the robes. It didn’t make any sense. They were not allowed to have any guests, and, besides, why would his mother buy him white robes? His mother was well aware of Draco preferring dark colours, and he was actually pretty sure he had never even worn anything white, at least not after he had been old enough to decide what to wear.
Harry closed his mouth, not knowing what to say next. To be honest, he had been so obsessed with his own thoughts and feelings he hadn’t thought at all how Draco might have seen last night’s incident.
But Draco didn’t know what he could have done differently. It had been a stupid idea to even consider his parents would willingly change sides; they would’ve probably preferred to turn their backs to their own son than betray the Dark Lord. Draco had felt like he had been stuck between a rock and a hard place, not being able to move nor think. But he had made his choice, and there was no longer anything to do about that.
to do with psychology,” Hermione said, incredulous, but the look on Harry’s face remained confused. “Okay, so, basics of psychology. God, we should really study this stuff at Hogwarts, it’d be so much easier to understand both yourself and other people," she went on, sighing heavily. "So, you know, our brains, both Muggle and wizard, consist of brain cells that create chains according to what you learn, and those learned chains form your thoughts. Your brain is an evolving organ, so it may always create new chains meanwhile some chains may decay and vanish if you don’t use them. You’re keeping up with me?”
For the first time in ages, it was only his mind that was in his small and cold cell in Azkaban while his body was somewhere else, in a huge, immensely soft bed, wrapped tightly inside a thick and warm blanket.
It was a hot and sunny summer day, far enough from the War for them to be able to do something as mundane as enjoying the weather and having drinks in the garden but still too near for them to be able to talk about anything else but the War.
Draco didn’t answer anything. Instead, he turned his gaze back at Harry, giving him a hesitant look.
Draco turned his gaze to his lap, his whole body radiating uncertainty now. “Yes. I – I don’t know where to start,” he said, voice trembling slightly.
Harry was leaning his forehead absentmindedly against a cold window on the Hogwarts Express on his way back to Hogwarts for his fifth school year. He was sharing the compartment with a happily chatting group that consisted of Neville, Ginny and, a new and quite interesting acquaintance, Luna. At first, Harry tried to catch their excited mood about going back to school, but he had to give up quite quickly as gloominess and grumpiness took over his mind. Different negative emotions had become a more and more familiar company to Harry over the summer, and he didn’t quite know how to handle them.
“And you’ll never guess who’s the lucky one from Slytherin,” Ron added sarcastically cutting off Hermione’s explanation.
But the inside of the Manor was a completely different story. The appearance was appalling, sure, especially compared to the Manor’s glorious days when there had been plenty of parties and balls, and the building had been full of people in their most expensive dressing robes. The contrast had been striking already during the War, and not to mention now as Draco’s parents hadn’t certainly learned a single cleaning spell and all the house-elves had been gone since the beginning of June. But Draco hadn’t actually paid that much attention to how the Manor had
“I’ve already told you, I’m not going,” Harry said stubbornly, sitting in the garden at the Burrow and discussing with Ron and Hermione who were both looking rather frustrated at this point.
Looking suspicious, Draco opened slowly the present that revealed a box of handmade fudge and a knitted, green sweater that had a grey ‘D’ on the front side. Draco looked at the sweater, confused, and all of a sudden, he went paler, if that was even possible, and his hands started to tremble as he ran his fingers over the letter ‘D’.
“But that sounds… How could anyone even consider abandoning their child only because they’re not straight?” Harry said incredulously. “But you’re pureblood as well? How come you’re being this supportive?”
“Ask Kreacher to levitate you, I don’t care,” Potter answered, slamming the bathroom door shut after himself.
It wasn’t an easy task to find them after making his way through the crowd, and when Harry finally heard their voices in an empty classroom, he was sure he had already missed some essential parts of their conversation.
Harry took a long breath in to make himself calm down. They hadn’t really talked that much about the war looming around the corner, and Harry would’ve loved to go on ignoring that topic altogether. “So, the Death Eaters must really trust you?”
“So, you fell in love in school?” A black-haired thirty-year-old looking woman, Emily, asked from the other side of the table.
Not that he would’ve kissed her back, either. He had been so surprised he had kind of frozen to the spot as all the thoughts had left his mind, and, well. He was well aware he should’ve said something, but crying girls tended to make him nervous as he had no idea how to behave around them.
“I’ve got a birthday present for you, I’ll give it to you when we get back to the castle,” Draco said. “And don’t even consider opening it before your actual birthday.”
Harry felt suddenly like an invisible hand had come to his throat to strangle him, making his breathing utterly difficult. “Which one?” he asked hoarsely.
Draco sighed heavily. “Mother, I know you know what there was between me and him. I know Severus told you.”
Harry couldn’t live with not knowing what Draco was hiding from him. At first, he tried but in the end, it took him only a day or two before he started following Draco’s dot regularly on the Marauder’s Map.
“So you’re saying I should’ve just been okay with him choosing Voldemort’s side and working for him?” Harry asked, incredulous. He couldn’t believe his friends were actually defending Draco. Or so it felt like, at least.
“Malfoy,” Harry answered, failing quite badly at sounding cold as the corner of his mouth was twisting too much. He took Draco’s hand firmly in his own and knocked their thighs together.
“Er,” Harry said. Now that Ginny had mentioned it, he realized he was actually rather hungry. “No, but I can eat something when we come back.”
“It’s up to you, only you can decide if you want to have someone in your life. But, to be honest, giving Draco a chance doesn’t sound like one of those dangerous and reckless ideas you and my son are quite famous for,” Molly said, the corners of her mouth turning slightly up. “And as an elderly lady, I’d hope you youngsters wouldn’t be too scared of life.”
“Nothing really, I'm just referring to the minor fact that you clearly haven’t told even your so-called best friends that you’re hiding a death-sentenced criminal at your home,” Draco said, trying to sound nonchalant.
“Erm, Harry?” Draco said uncertainly, squirming a little. “I’m so sorry for the quarrel, I never wanted –”
Feeling frustrated, Harry slumped on the couch and closed his eyes. His head was hurting, and no matter how much he tried, he couldn’t forget the blood-curdling scream Katie had made as she had been hanging in the air, eyes widened in horror.
“Sorry, sorry,” Zabini said, raising his hands up in surrender. “But honestly, I’d have paid a fortune only for getting a glimpse of the expression on Snape’s face when he caught you. The poor Professor, walking to his office to have a lunch break and then abruptly finding the Golden Boy seducing his dear, innocent godson,” he continued, snickering.
“Erm, I’m not exactly an expert on technology, but I reckon it goes through telephone lines or something.”
“It had nothing to do with forgiveness,” Harry said, fidgeting with his sleeve. “Well, I still have feelings for you. Obviously. It was me who started the kissing, after all,” he trailed off and sighed. “I just, um, I don’t know how to trust you anymore. I mean, I’m scared of letting you back into my life. I’m scared of you leaving me again. I don’t think I would be able to go through that again.”
“Not for long,” Neville said. “Seamus and Ron just seem to be making sure everyone’s filling their cups often enough.”
“Potter, you remember what I told you about the pureblood system? It’s not taken very well if you’re… different,” Zabini said gloomily.
“Probably not. And it’s always been possible to eventually go around or abolish the laws if they’ve seemed too barbaric or inhuman,” Hermione said. “But now I’ve got no idea what we could do next. Not even Kingsley seems to have a say in the Wizengamot’s decisions.”
Harry turned around on the corridor when he heard a familiar voice. Of course, Malfoy just had to have his prefect rounds always when Harry was going through his worst moments. “Malfoy,” Harry said, reserved.
“We know!” Hermione cried. “We already talked about this before Malfoy’s trial, it’s not that simple or black and white when your family is involved.”
Slowly, the Slytherin had started to show some signs of change. At first, he had stopped hiding completely in his room and started to pass a bit more time in the common room doing homework with Hermione or talking with Blaise who had finally come back from France. Draco was still seemingly reserved, and he looked quite cautious always when he was alone, but when he was with someone he liked, his whole appearance changed from passive, distant and anxious-looking to more present and animated. Sometimes Harry could see him even smiling.
Draco barked out a laugh. “Okay, so if the only word you can come up with to describe kissing a girl is wet, I don’t think I have too much to worry about.”
“Ginny is right,” Harry said after a moment, standing up as well. “There would be no point to play with only three players.”
“I do! Or no. Or, I mean… I don’t know,” Harry spluttered, feeling suddenly like wanting nothing else than to sink through the ground.
definitely was big and beautiful, albeit somewhat shabby. Potter clearly wasn’t too interested in taking care of a highly respected old house. But at least the room was clean, and the bed felt comfortable and soft, although it wasn’t that much of a miracle as after the hard and cold floor in the cell anything would probably have felt comfortable and soft.
“So, what do you want to do in Hogsmeade on Saturday?” Hermione asked, trying to change the subject.
During last year Harry had tried to block all his thoughts about Draco and all the feelings he had for him, and he had actually managed surprisingly well as his brain had practically been only in survival mode for the whole time, not being able to handle any other thoughts than how to hide, escape and stay alive. He and Draco had, of course, had their few encounters during spring, the last one having been bittersweetly in the Room of Requirement that had been burning down like the remnants of whatever there ever had been between them. Now, that the War was over, the Slytherin had made his way back to Harry’s mind, slowly but surely, first appearing in his dreams, then in all the memories his mind had started to show him spontaneously,
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Ron asked, sounding rather disappointed, too. “You were almost two years with Malfoy and never said a word to us.”
“Erm, Harry Potter,” Harry said awkwardly and shook Zabini’s hand, feeling clumsy. He was so perplexed he couldn’t make himself do anything else but stare at the Slytherin with wide eyes.
“Harry, you’re staring again,” Hermione said warningly to Harry the next morning when she, Harry and Ron were eating breakfast in the Great Hall.
“It’s a vow you can’t break, no matter what,” Hermione said, cutting in. “If you make un Unbreakable Vow and break it, you die.”
“Oh… Er… I haven’t really had time to think about that. Us, I mean” Harry said, fidgeting with his sleeve.
“I don’t think he’s really sulking about the doomsday, why would the doomsday be something to sulk about? It’s not necessarily a bad day,” Luna commented airily with her feeble voice, peeking from behind her Quibbler.
The day Draco Malfoy had waited impatiently for months had finally come. It was a beautiful winter day and the first snow glistened like millions of small diamonds everywhere around the castle in the bright moonlight. Draco wouldn't usually prefer to celebrate Christmas at Hogwarts instead of his home, Malfoy Manor, but this year was different in many ways. First of all, the whole castle was decorated rather decently for once. Not that Draco would admit it after years of loud complaint about the staffs' lack of style in festivity decorations. And in any case, Hogwarts could never be as luxurious as the Manor, of course. Secondly, all the students from all the four Houses, at least all those above the third class, had decided to stay at school to take part in the Yule Ball. It wasn't a Christmas feast like the ones at school all the other years for those pitiful students who didn't have a family to celebrate Christmas with. No, this was something that happened so rarely it was truly an honour to be one of those to take part in it. Besides, the Ball was not only for the Hogwarts students but also for the international visitors, even for a couple of famous ones, who were staying at Hogwarts during the Triwizard Tournament. All that being said, Draco just couldn't miss the chance to make an impact on all the important international students or to brag with his dancing skills and fine and expensive taste in dress robes.
Hermione nodded solemnly. “I haven’t found that many books about purebloods. Or, I mean, of course, there’re loads of books about them, their traditions, family trees and so on, but they are all praising the pureblood system. I haven’t found anything even remotely objective, let alone something criticising. I have actually compared the pureblood culture quite a lot with religions, there’re surprisingly many similarities between them. If we’re talking about the most, well, conservative form of pureblood culture, it isn’t that different from really conservative religions.”
“No. But I want to concentrate on what we’re having now,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand and lacing their fingers together. “You must believe me when I say I’d never fight against you.”
Ginny’s eyes widened and she put the hand on her mouth. “Does that mean I finally get to meet your paramour?” she asked excitedly.
“Yes, you are. You’re working for Umbridge like a good little underling, and Umbridge’s working for the Ministry, and the Ministry is against me and Dumbledore,” Harry said, bolting upright from the couch. “Why can’t you keep a low profile, just like Blaise?”
Draco shrugged. “It’s gone much better than in all my scenarios,” he said and leaned his head on Harry’s shoulder.
“Harry, please. He’s feeling upset, just listen to him. I’ll make sure no one comes to disturb you,” Ginny said, nudging Harry in the side.
That night Harry’s mind was filled with memories of Draco’s finger drawing lines on his chest, Draco laughing so that his warm breath was tingling Harry’s face, Draco trying to comb Harry’s hair gently with his fingers, Draco’s lips meeting Harry’s in a slow, tentative kiss, his whole body telling Harry how much he cared for him.
Hermione beamed. “Oh, Harry, I’m so glad you’ve got excited about the, er, teaching thing,” she said, lowering her voice and watching worriedly at the staff table. Umbridge was unsurprisingly present, glowering at the students as she sipped her tea.
“Harry,” Draco said taking Harry’s hand and turning his gaze to Harry. “This is perfect. Thank you,” he said softly and kissed Harry on the lips.
When Draco turned his gaze to his mother, he felt a wave of dread washing over him. His mother was crying silently, eyes red and swollen. She looked out of the window with empty eyes, refusing to look at Draco.
“Bloody hell, Harry, didn’t know you’d be this rusty,” Ron said, looking at Harry and Draco a bit oddly but refraining from commenting anything. “This must be the first time you lose to Malfoy,” he went on, making Ginny hush him down and kick him, but it was too late.
When Harry had finished his breakfast, said bye to all the Weasleys, and hugged Molly probably for the fifth time that morning, Harry headed out and Apparated straight to Andromeda’s countryside cottage.
“Me? Ridiculous?” Draco said coolly, raising his eyebrow. “If you’ve already ogled enough, you may as well leave now. I’m actually quite busy, you know. I still have to count the stones in the ceiling once more.”
“Please, I don’t want to talk about that any more than necessary,” Harry said, talking over Draco. He still hated talking about him having been a Horcrux and other people having played him like a pawn.
But again, there was no answer. The door was so thin it was usually possible to hear if Teddy was crying or if someone came to open the door, but this time there was only silence.
“You know Ginny, she’s quite lively. She has probably as many friends in other Houses as in Gryffindor,” Harry said, shrugging.
“Stop it! Stop it!” Draco cried, laughing, too, and trying to get the snitch as far from Harry as possible.
Draco stood up as well, crossing his arms over his chest. “You know why I can’t. My family would suspect there’s –”
“You stay out of this! It’s a pity I can’t kill you myself, but I suppose the Dark Lord will do it for me soon enough,” Lucius snapped at Harry. “Draco, you can still make things right. We can forget all about your little misjudgement if you come with me now.”
I'll be busier than usual during this and the next week, so I don't dare to promise to update as often as I've been able to do so far.
“Oh,” Harry said. To be honest, there had been so much occupying his mind he had forgotten all about the phones. “Yes, I have it in my coat pocket,” he said, patting his pocket to make sure it was still there.
“Well, that’s no surprise as we got to learn such important subjects as Divination instead of all the Muggle school subjects,” Hermione said, huffing. “Anyway, if I could guess, Malfoy’s brain is probably full of toxic thought patterns that form thoughts like
“I think so, yes,” Ron said. “Just keep us better updated next time you decide to start shagging someone regularly, okay?”
Harry was sitting in the kitchen at the Burrow, trying to open his eyes after another night filled with nightmares. It wasn’t even that early in the morning, but he was already regretting he had promised to come to the Burrow every other day to eat breakfast so that Molly could keep an eye on him. She had started to notice how much weight Harry had lost during the War and how he looked always so tired she had proposed Harry would visit them more regularly. According to Molly, it had not been the right time to move out on his own now, right after the War, when he was still going through trauma and grief for all the losses. At first, Harry hadn’t liked the idea, but Molly had been so lost after Fred’s death, constantly on the verge of tears and worrying excessively for all her family members, Harry had finally agreed to Molly’s proposal, hoping it would make her feel at least a bit better.
Harry read through the messages, thrice. How could he have forgotten about the phone? Draco had been in his mind multiple times a day, but he just hadn’t remembered the existence of their phones. He had been too fixated on the idea of him being Voldemort’s puppet he hadn’t even thought someone would be worried about him.
“Yes, Draco, I do. I have forgiven you,” Harry said firmly, trying to convince Draco. “Now that I understand better, I know I shouldn’t have tried to make you choose me over your parents in the first place. It was unfair that even I was pushing you when you already had so hard. And I still wish I had at least tried to understand you.”
When Draco couldn’t come up with anything to delay going to the dining room, he started to pace downstairs, fear increasing with every step.
“It’s always possible it won’t work out, and there’s always a chance he might leave you or you might leave him. You can never be sure, and it’s just part of life. I mean, there’s always a possibility that I and Ron don’t work out, and Ron leaves me, or I leave him. But you have to try if you want to get to know that. There’s no other way,” Hermione said.
“Yes,” Draco said, nodding. “We’re going out with the group today. Any last-minute tips for how to survive a pub night with Muggles without making a complete fool out of myself?”
Harry’s summer back at the Dursleys wasn’t anything to cheer about, but at least it wasn’t any worse than the previous summers either. Some of the Order members had indeed talked to the Dursleys, or rather threatened them, which might have made the Dursleys leave him alone more often than they’d normally do. Harry felt like he didn’t need even the Invisibility Cloak to make himself invisible in the Dursleys’ household, and not even Dudley dared to be too much of a nuisance to Harry for once.
Ron sighed, looking pensive. “Who would’ve guessed a year or two ago that the ferret would be the one to have more Muggle friends than any of us?”
“So, you must be wondering why I ruined your pleasant morning walk and dragged you here,” Zabini said, managing to somehow make his voice sound elegant, posh and polite at the same time.
The last days of the school year passed in a blur. Harry couldn’t find himself caring much about the school or even the O.W.L. results that all the fifth-years seemed to be waiting for excitedly. Actually, Harry found it difficult to care about anything at all these days, and if he could, he would most preferably pass all his time somewhere cuddled up with Draco, which seemed to be the only thing that made him feel somewhat calm and anchored in the present moment.
Harry pinched his nose for a moment, feeling frustrated. “He wasn’t insinuating anything. He was just reacting to you behaving like a dick.”
Ginny’s face turned almost as red as her hair. “I don’t know yet. But I’m going to get to know soon because I, for one, took the Muggle Studies.”
Hagrid’s return had certainly been the best news of their week. It had been such a relief to see their friend alive and doing fine. Well, all things considered.
Harry stared at his own cup for a while, shrugged, and followed suit. And ugh, the rum tasted so bad and made Harry’s throat burn like crazy so that he had to gag and cough, making the rest of the group burst out laughing. Christ, how was he supposed to be used to this stuff? He hadn’t exactly had time for partying before as there had always been some more, well, pressing matters, such as trying to stop a madman from taking over the Wizarding world.
But the mere thought of leaving his family, as Sirius had done, made Draco get goosebumps. He knew he had never been an exceptionally brave person so he probably wouldn’t dare to leave them, and, besides, he didn’t even
“I’m quite tempted to ask who this guy named Jesus is all the Muggle-borns and Half-bloods are fussing about,” Blaise said, thoughtful.
, Harry thought bitterly. He had absolutely no desire to talk about anything that had something to do with his messy feelings.
“Harry, you’re my best friend and we’ve known each other for years now. It’s been quite obvious you aren’t entirely straight, to say the least.”
Abruptly, the compartment door slid open with a small creak cutting Harry’s train of thought. Ron and Hermione had finally been able to leave the prefect carriage, at least for a moment.
“Why don’t you tell me about your plan? Draco, I only want to help you, I made the Unbreakable Vow to protect you. I promised to your mother to keep you safe.”
”Oh, well,” Molly said slowly. “I can see why you’re scared. I don’t obviously know all the details, but it’s so unfair and wrong what happened to both of you. No kid should have to go through something like that,” she continued. “However, the things are different now. Do you really think Draco would leave you this time?”
“Would you like to come for a visit to the Burrow tomorrow?” Ron asked suddenly, apropos of nothing. “You’d have something else to think about for once, and mum and Ginny have asked a lot after you,” he explained, giving Harry a meaningful look.
“So, you remember when I compared the pureblood culture to conservative religions back at the beginning of the fifth year?”
Nothing could have prepared Harry for the unlike conversation between the very unlike couple, which was taking place in the bathroom. Draco was opening up about his fears with Myrtle and sobbing so violently Harry would have guessed it was someone else if he hadn’t checked his Map beforehand. To be able to get a view of the couple, Harry opened the door slightly, only to see Draco shaking and leaning heavily on the sink, head bowed, and shoulders slumped down. Harry got a glimpse of Draco’s face in the mirror, and the view made him feel almost sick; Draco’s skin was paler than ever, his eyes were red and swollen, and his face glistened with tears that were streaming down at a fast pace.
“He didn’t come out for anyone else but himself,” snapped a red-haired, thirty-something-year-old looking woman, Olivia, who was sitting next to Anne.
know, maybe even better than Harry himself. “You’re thinking about Malfoy, aren’t you? Draco Malfoy?”
“You don’t have to apologize. I get why you acted as you did. I know what the Dark Mark represents to you,” Draco said in a pained voice.
something to do with you, I saw you two sneaking to your room last night,” Blaise snapped, clearly being protective of his friend.
“Yes. You don’t have to sound like that, we get along quite well these days. I gave him even a new hat.”
Malfoy pulled his hand away from Harry’s grip and started framing Harry’s lips with his index finger. “I like you, too, but that much must already be obvious to you.”
“Fucking Blaise,” Malfoy muttered and started playing absently with Harry’s hair. “Well, he’s always said I’m a little obsessed with you, though I really don’t get it. And he noticed I had a small breakdown at the Yule Ball when you stumbled into the Great Hall.”
As midnight approached, Harry noticed himself getting a bit restless. He had been curious about Draco’s gift, and the more time passed, the more impatient he became. It’d be okay to open the gift now, right? Harry decided to make his excuses and headed quickly to his room, snatched the slytherin green gift from under his bed and opened it.
Harry felt his heart jumping and something warm spreading in his chest as he heard Draco’s words. “I’m happy to hear that because I’m hardly letting you go, either,” Harry said and kissed fondly Draco’s forehead.
Harry hurried to the Gryffindor Tower to leave his schoolbooks there and to take the Invisibility Cloak and the Marauder’s Map with him before heading to the lake.
“We haven’t really talked about this,” Ginny said, sounding a bit sad as she gestured vaguely to herself and Harry with her hand.
The first days back at school were filled with hurry. All the professors seemed to think the Christmas holidays had only been a waste of time and the students would better make up for their leisure time by using at least twice as much time on homework than before the holidays. Having to fit the DA lessons and Occlumency with Snape made Harry’s first week at school a horror timewise.
Before you start reading this chapter, I want to warn you that everyone who died in the books is going to die in this story too. You might guess what’s coming next.
It was not a miracle Draco's head had been a big mess for a long time. Admitting his feelings finally helped somewhat, or at least his head felt a lot clearer. Now he only had to come up with a plan. Draco had been raised to follow his path, and he knew he should follow it with pride. He could never let his true feelings to show, no one could ever know. The only possible way Draco saw was to try to hide his feelings even deeper. Draco knew he couldn't hide his feelings from himself anymore, but he was pretty sure he would be able to fool everyone else. Maybe he could try to date Pansy during his time at Hogwarts and start courting right after graduating. Draco knew he wouldn't be able to be perfectly happy, but maybe he would be content enough. The happiness of his parents came first, while his own wasn't as important. And how could he even be happy if he didn't have his family or his heritage?
“I know. Believe me, I didn’t imagine this to go like this, either,” Draco said. “And I’d really appreciate it if you at least tried to listen to me in future.”
Harry took a few steps back, looking slightly embarrassed. “Sorry, I had meant to talk to you before kissing you,” he said, turning red.
“’Course, knew you wouldn’t survive a night without me,” Ron said, grinning and starting towards the staircase.
Harry kissed Draco’s head before starting to stroke his hair lazily. They both felt quite calm and much more relaxed than in the beginning. They closed their eyes contently, feeling each other’s body warmth and listening to Ginny and Blaise’s vivid stream of conversation.
For the rest of the journey, they walked talking about lighter subjects from the Gryffindor Quidditch team to the next DA meetings. Once they arrived at Grimmauld Place, Ginny rushed immediately to her room to start with the packing meanwhile Harry started to look for Sirius as he had promised to still talk properly with him before leaving.
“Nonsense, Harry, you’re always more than welcome here. I hope you one day could really see this as one of your homes along with Hogwarts and your own flat,” Molly said sincerely, looking Harry in the eye. “So, you can stay in Ron’s room or you can choose almost any of the other rooms if you want. George is going to stay here over the weekend, but all the other rooms are empty.”
“No, there’s no god to worship, but the system is still very reminiscent of conservative religious groups, especially of sects. For one, it’s a group that teaches you certain beliefs you have to believe to be able to stay as a member of the group. Those beliefs include usually thoughts about your own group being better than the others, how other people outside of your group are a threat to your group’s existence, and how it’s preferable to marry someone in the same group and have children with them to keep the group pure. You’re following me?” Hermione asked, waiting for Harry to nod before going on. “There are also a lot of strict rules and traditions you have to follow or you may be shut out as a punishment. Those groups are usually really exclusive, which means they don’t want people outside of the group to intervene and people inside the group don’t tend to have many connections to the people outside of the group.”
