“Well – yes. But also why you weren’t on our side, if you weren’t on theirs.”
Blaise sighed. “Oh, this is going to be difficult. Harry, did you know that Hermione went to the cinema with Anthony on Monday?”
Lee grinned. He’d filled out quite a bit, with a nice shoulder to hip ratio and long dreads down to the small of his back. He was also shirtless, something that Harry could appreciate quite a bit.
Harry looked at him sideways. Draco was bouncing as he walked, smiling aimlessly. “You’re, like, ridiculously happy today. Did you take something from Blaise?”
“And I’ll never cook for you or clean your house.”
“Being cool and supportive about this,” Ron hissed back.
“I get it,” said Parvati. “Even though you won in the end, there will always be this memory of the time you weren’t enough.”
Michael went down like a stone. Harry had his wand out instantly, trying to work out whether to point it at Blaise or Michael. Blaise was stepping away from the wall, hands in his pockets. He casually kicked Michael in the side.
the implications of that aside. “Um, what about Susan?”
“Of fucking course,” scoffed Seamus. “Harry just couldn’t wait to be there for him, to hear all about poor little Dean and all his problems, and maybe they’ll just get talking to how I’m a bastard and then Dean will want comforting – “
“On a date?”
“Worse,” said Pansy. “He’s meeting her family. He’s trying to get their approval.”
“It’s fun, that’s all,” she’d told Harry, when he’d mentioned Blaise’s future-fist-fight theory. “They all know it’s just fun. I think Terry actually has a point-scoring system for them. He’s taking me swing-dancing, which I’m dubious about.”
Following the hideous clusterfuck of the last few years, apparently the people putting together the Teaching Magic course had felt it was important that educators had a strong understanding of right and wrong (presumably to prevent any of them from viciously bullying everyone in sight to cleverly conceal their conscience). Unfortunately, it turned out that most wizards had been too busy with magic to develop intricate moral theories –
But apart from that, the night was pleasant, until Susan – who had been put in charge of the rounds system – pointed at Draco and said “All right, Malfoy. It’s your turn.” Harry suddenly remembered that Malfoy was working in a Muggle pub, and had been cut off by his parents, and probably couldn’t afford drinks for fourteen people, and this whole thing was going to end in a humiliating mess.
“Thanks. Um, I suppose I’ll owe you that favour.” He turned to walk away, and she grabbed his sleeve.
“Haven’t done anything brave.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, grimacing. “He was really apologetic, second year. Kept thinking about how if he’d succeeded, Voldemort would have come back. I think that’s when I really started liking him, though. He knew he was a shit wizard, but he still tried anyway.”
Seamus was just looking at him. Dean held him harder. “Promise me, Seamus. Promise me we’ll talk about this when I come back.”
“Hermione. Love life.”
She waited another week before ending things with Terry. Luckily, he was a Ravenclaw and therefore far too deep in his studies to ask her on a date. She used the limited time in between to catch up with Draco, who was, a little tentatively, a friend. Or at the very least, friend-adjacent.
He shot her a look. “You didn’t notice? With Ron?”
“Why?”
Morag reached over and ruffled his hair. “Not what I meant, but it’s refreshing to see that you’re still the same post coming-out, Harry.”
“Draco, I’m bi, and that’s not how sexuality works – “
“Exactly.”
Harry laughed. “There’s no juicy gossip on that one. She’s gay.”
Ron was gaping. “Bloody hell, Hermione, I thought you said the wizarding world was weird.”
“Those bastards.”
“And I’m a six-foot-four black bisexual and I’ve survived the night so far.”
Blaise’s glare was mutinous. “Are
They sprinted across the grounds, heads low and wands covered. Harry followed Blaise into his room, slamming the door behind him and leaning against it like Michael might burst through any second.
Harry silently vowed to never find out how Blaise knew about Lego.
“Like, embarrassingly,” said Padma. “She wouldn’t shut the fuck up about you when she came home for Diwali.”
“Oh fuck off forever, Harry.”
“Yeah, I’m sure that will make you less obsessed with him.”
“I’ve never actually had a shot before.”
“So, I should – go sleep off my hangover,” he said, and fled
There was a moment where he seemed caught – the pleasant, polite mask on his face trembled. And then it fell away. His lip curled with feral hunger. His eyes darkened. Before there had been Michael, her friend, confused as to what was going on. Now she could see what was underneath, and it was hatred.
Harry was about to bristle and defend himself, when next to him Ron heaved a long-suffering sigh.
“And then – when he asked me to come back to his room and I said that I didn’t want to have sex, he got so offended. Kept asking me why I would assume that he was after that. And then he said – he asked me if I’d never been on a date before. He said the nightcap was kind of traditional. He seemed like – he was implying I’d be rude if I didn’t go with him. And he’s just Michael, right? He’s our mate. And he was right, I’d never –“ She turned her face to the wall. “And then on the walk back, he started saying all this stuff. Asking me if I liked it when he spoke like that. I just felt like I couldn’t back out once I’d agreed. Whenever I pulled away he told me to calm down and stop being so anxious. Anyway, it wasn’t – it wasn’t a
“Never have I ever had nightmares about spiders forcing me to tap dance,” said Harry.
“You’re so good at this, mate,” said Seamus. “Look, Harry. There’s so much good stuff about to happen. Let’s not focus on the bad shit, yeah?”
“Merlin,” said Blaise, “I almost miss the days you were trying to kill each other. Finnegan, I am insisting on that coffee run now. The café’s three flights down, so who knows? You might find an opportune moment to push me down the stairs.”
“Sorry.”
By the time the lights came on, Harry had to admit defeat. Draco was not anywhere in Eclectic. He apparated back to the edge of the Royal College, and half-jogged all the way to the dorm to find Nott smoking outside.
“Oh Merlin,” said Ron. “What was that about?”
“If she feels she has to feel grateful, she’ll hate me,” he said. He poured two glasses and motioned for Harry to sit down, levitating the drink over to him. “I just – fuck, I was so scared. If Michael had actually tried to fight back, I don’t know what I’d have done. I’ve always been rubbish at duelling. That’s really why I bought you.”
Harry waited, and drank Blaise’s wine because he needed it. He felt like ripping Michael’s face off his skull. Was that too violent?
She thumped her on the shoulder. “How did you realise?”
“He does know it’s not actually the forties, right?”
“Because I needed to,” he said lamely.
“He barely spoke two words to me!”
“I don’t know why we have to have the party here,” Hermione was saying when he went down to see her for breakfast. “It’s Blaise’s thing.”
Blaise hissed under his breath. There was something sharp there, hot and lonely, and Harry – well, Hermione always said he had a saviour complex.
Thankfully, Seamus was still on campus, because searching the whole of Windsor Great Park would have been a bitch. She found him sitting on a bridge above the ornamental water feature, throwing stones into the pool, and settled down beside him.
she didn’t need to get twelve books out at once.
more attention grabbing than simply saying ‘shagging’ – “With the
“Of course.”
“A wrong one.”
“Sounds good,” said Harry. “I’ll just – “
“Mate,” said Ron, enveloping him in a hug. Harry relaxed against him. The world was dark and confusing, everyone here was wearing the least possible amount of clothes and the music was far too loud, but at least there would always be Ron to hug.
“Unless there’s something you’re not telling us?” said Blaise, peering at Harry.
Because he was enjoying Harry fucking him. Loving it so much that he didn’t trust his body. He was rocking forward onto Harry’s dick each time he thrust, moaning and clawing at the bedsheets, and Harry couldn’t help himself, went faster, rougher.
“You do?”
“I’m not here for that. What are you doing Saturday?”
This had been a mistake. She was leaning forward with a predatory smirk. “Quite what, Potter?”
“Exactly, Granger,” said Susan.
He remembered Draco saying that he needed a hand on himself to finish, and he reached round. His hand was batted away.
“Don’t you bring up the Hannah thing like you were so cool and understanding, you were furious about that.”
I was fourteen, for fuck’s sake. He was eighteen. He was just being nice. He’d seen the articles Skeeter put out about me and Harry and he wanted to cheer me up, because he’s a gentle giant. I knew that, I just pretended I didn’t. Only two boys asked me to the Ball, and one was just being kind, and the other had run out of people to go with.”
Not that things had been stellar in eighth year, even with Ron there. Harry had felt like he was limping through school, trying to work out what he wanted to do with his life, standing on the edges of Ron and Hermione’s drama.
“What she said,” said Hermione. “I can’t believe you, I thought I was your friend and you’re turning me into some kind of joke – “
He was looking at her desperately, helplessly, and she realised that he was waiting for her
“I can’t believe I’m the only Slytherin success story,” muttered Theo. “My father might even be slightly less disappointed in me.”
“Touching me.” Seamus’s tongue darted out, flicking against his lips. “Do you like touching me?”
The bar was called
Blaise grinned again, his expression wolfish. “Is that how it is? All right Thomas, what’s your poison? Wait, don’t tell me. I pride myself on being able to find a drink for every occasion.”
“All right, so utilitarianism – bugger.” Her wand had started to chime. “Harry, I’m sorry. I’m going for cocktails in London with Parvati tonight, and I need to leave now if I want to be ready in time.”
“Good shout, Pansy, this game’s rubbish,” said Ron. “Truth or dare?”
– smiled. “Please. He can barely stand up. I’m not sure I can bear to drag him the rest of the way, but Pansy would murder me if I left him to die in a bush.”
Harry grabbed the bottle, drank, raised his fists to the sky. “Bisexual and biracial and undesirable and alive!”
“Furthest thing from my mind.”
“I have a problem, mate.”
“I think Susan probably doesn’t need a nightcap.” There was Anthony, face resolute. “Why don’t you sit outside with us and have some fresh air?”
“I take my artform seriously?”
Dean pushed him away, gasping. “Was that – was that a fucking joke?”
“Of course,” said Hermione. “We love your insights.”
“Morag’s a Ravenclaw and she doesn’t love you.”
“So you’re, you’re – you like girls now?”
“You’re not frumpy.”
Harry turned. Hermione was indeed snuggled up next to Anthony, perched on an overturned Tesco trolley. Anthony was trying to put a traffic cone on her head as she giggled and batted him away. She saw Harry looking and waved at him, and he barked a “be right back” at Dean and bounded over.
“Poetic, Harry. I know he’s not gay, but if he was he’d be giving off serious mixed signals. Like the other night, when we held hands on the way back from the pub. It was a joke at first, sure, but then he didn’t let go. Just held my hand for an hour while we spoke about nothing. He’s always been tactile, I guess. It’s not new. It’s my own fault for getting confused. Pity he only does it when he’s drunk, now.”
“Yeah.” She squeezed her hand. “Tell me your despair.”
“I said fuck off. Seamus, you cowardly wankstain, open your fucking door!”
Draco went red. “That shit. He never could keep his mouth shut.”
Parvati laughed again. “Ok. Gimme a second – we need booze for a proper drinks and bitch session.”
“He does terrible things for you ego,” said Pansy. “Remind me to have him arrested on false charges as soon as I actually make auror.”
Harry burst out laughing. “Oh fuck me, yeah. That weird grin he does when he’s trying to pretend he’s fine with something, and you can just see the anger twitching under the surface – “
Draco was tight and warm and glorious, and Harry had to grip his hands into fists to stop himself from coming. He thrust in, shallow at first, running his hands gently across Draco’s trembling back.
“You mean – “ a wet cough – “Susan?”
“I might throw up on him,” said Nott.
“You should invite Malfoy,” said Harry, when on Thursday Blaise began making noises about getting the weekend off to an early start.
“You’re in a right snit,” said Pansy over Sunday tea, who was herself in a right snit. Apparently Weasley had stopped dancing with her and bolted out of the club as soon as he saw Granger leave, which any fool could have seen coming. He said as much, and she threw a scone at him.
Harry raised upstairs and found Blaise and Susan in the kitchen, doing – something.
“Fine.”
“You’re always going to have to be making new rules,” said Harry.
“Who told you, Hermione? Was it Anthony?”
“Oh for the love of – “
“That you’d rather have been getting high in a manor than fighting werewolves or something? No, I think that might be the sanest thing you’ve ever said.”
“He’s not?”
Draco refused to watch him go, as a point of principle. He was an adult man who could survive a few awkward encounters and a broken heart without turning into a teenage girl.
“Uh, yeah,” said Harry. “Love to, you know. Get drunk and wild.”
Next to him, Ron stiffened. Pansy raised her chin defiantly. “Truth.”
Draco shrugged. “If you think it won’t be too much of a stain on your reputation to be seen with – how did the reporter put it? – ‘a dangerous reminder of harder times.’”
“Hannah? No, I meant because of your previous experience interning in the Wizengemot.”
“Sounds horrible. Have you been speaking to Granger again? That woman is an unmitigated menace, and she doesn’t have a leg to stand on. Honestly - “
“As long as you don’t finish the whole bottle. Then we’ll get you into bed.”
“Start what? I’m not saying it was wrong, Harry. But it’s fine for me, but not for Seamus? Why doesn’t he get consequences for his actions?”
“Are you still alive?” said Parvati, opening the door to her room. Hermione straightened out from behind a pile of books, trying to look less like some kind of dirty study goblin who’d been hunched over for seven hours.
“Told you,” said Parkinson. “Lions have claws, you know.” She looked suspiciously like she was smiling into her drink.
“I’d love that,” she said, before a bright idea struck her. “Though if you have another dancing friend, perhaps we could bring Luna along? She told me everything free should dance once, so she’s probably love being thrown in the air.”
“Will always be us,” said Harry. “I promise.” And he meant it, even as a small part of him sat up and worried. Hermione was great, but she was probably going to end up with a whole bunch of Ravenclaw types who Harry wouldn’t be able to keep up with, and without Ron there to be stabilise them, would there be space for Harry?
“Bones.” There was Nott. “Look at me. Do you know where you are?”
“I wasn’t complaining.” Draco grabbed the bottle back and drank. “I know. I just want to be a new person. But I can’t be, can I?” He grabbed the sleeve of his left arm and pushed it back, revealing his Dark Mark and spilling a decent amount of the gin on his trousers. He didn’t push it in Harry’s face. Just stared at it, sad and lost. “Same old Draco Malfoy. Always and forever. Written on my skin.”
“Though let me be absolutely clear here – if Dean decides tonight that he’s going to shack up with Terry or Anthony or some anonymous twink at a bar? Good for him. If I’d been fucked around the way you’ve been fucking him around I’d be champing at the bit for a good shag to get it out of my system.”
“I missed a lecture,” she said. “I can’t believe I missed a lecture to have sex. Who have I become, Harry?”
“Could you not?” Ron slammed his pint down with force.
“I don’t know, and I never want to.” He tried to focus on his books.
said the Hermione-voice in his head – and little traffic along the roads.
He tossed his head back. “Yeah, but on me it’s elegant. And a sign of good breeding. Like a horse, or a really fine dog.”
“Um, any one of the three Ravenclaw boys who follow you around constantly?”
“Sure.” Just like Hermione said, nice and friendly. “Can I call you Draco, though?”
“Say, Harry,” said Terry. He had smooth dark hair he wore in a brilliantined wave and a blazer that probably cost more than a nice broom. Harry could never quite shake the feeling that Terry might call him
“Hermione – no,” said Ron. “She wouldn’t. No. Right? Not that I care but. No. No.”
Parvati. There was something off about her whenever she was friendly to Hermione. Something that suggested she thought she was being
Blaise sighed. “I was asking you if you had any plans to join a society, but fuck it. Just ask me what you want to.”
They had fucked a dozen times. It wasn’t like he left his shirt on in bed. Potter had seen it, and hadn’t cared. Hadn’t even commented. Like it was nothing. He already knew, he’d factored it into all his calculations, and he just hadn’t given a damn.
“We mostly knew why we were angry,” said Harry.
“As are mine,” said Malfoy. He crushed his cigarette under his boot. “You’re apologies are lacking in finesse, and this conversation is going nowhere. You apologised, I’ve got a job – you can go back to shaking with rage whenever I step into the room. Get lost.”
Halfway there, he heard the sound of singing.
“She’s a terrible auror. I’m pretty sure she just took this job so she could hinder any criminal investigations into Blaise.”
Parvati cocked her head. “Um, ok. Wow. You seem like you’re going through a lot right now. But – yeah, I can see how what Padma said sounded really bitchy, though I’m still not sure why I have to suffer for my sister’s sins. You know we’re sharing with Anthony and Michael? And Terry’s just upstairs?”
“ I think it’s nice that you two are friends,” she said. “We’re all friends now. That’s so – so – “
Harry looked up. Ron had summoned Harry for a drink at the Three Broomsticks with an air of urgency and then – well, proceeded to act like a lunatic, downing his first three pints with almost manic energy, talking a mile a minute about auror stuff and asking Harry far too many questions about things he didn’t care about.
“You don’t want to know,” said Dean, desperately. “You’re drunk. You don’t want to know.”
“Hermione!”
“I’m a challenge for you,” she said, her voice flinty.
“He’s gay,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice even. “They cut him off because he was gay.”
“No, Ron,” she said sweetly. “My revenge will come when I watch you tell your mother you’re dating Pansy Parkinson.”
“Harry – “
“Don’t be a bitch, Patil.”
“Slytherin girls love me. And Ravenclaw girls too. I even dated Katie Bell one summer. It’s just these bloody Hufflepuffs I can’t charm.”
“Well, you’re half-feral anyway - “
Unfortunately for him, Potter kept on popping up everywhere. For the next
“Cool. I’ll find Hannah. Hang out with someone normal for a bit.”
“But I – “
“There are no good options on the noses, though,” mused Ron. “Maybe they’ll end up with a halfway-point of both of ours. That wouldn’t be so bad.”
“Was it to do something good?”
“Fuck off.”
“We’re sick of it,” she had hissed, blocking the way from the Slytherin boys dorm. “All you do is drop cryptic comments and then storm off. Stop the sulking and just talk.”
“No? But I think we were pretty close. Maybe I’m just imagining it. I don’t exactly know how female friendships are supposed to work. Maybe all girls get that close with their friends?”
“I’ve missed you both,” said Ron. “I mean, Harry I see regularly, but – “
haunted. He’d had Hermione and Ron over on separate evenings, back to back, until it became undeniable that they were only coming over because they pitied him.
There will be a bit of a delay before posting chapter 3 - less of it is written. I have almost all of the ending, but I'm still winding my way there.
“It’s where she belongs,” said Ron, but he didn’t look any less sad. “I just – I mean, the three of us – “
“Fuck off
“You’ve scrubbed up,” said Harry, taking in Ron as they pulled back. He was wearing a tight black shirt that actually fit him and showed off his new muscles. Had his shoulders always been this broad? God, his new found love of cock wasn’t going to start applying to
“Yeah,” said Harry glumly, and tried to focus in on the conversation about Puddlemere’s chances against the Harpies (poor to dreadful) and not his own chances of enjoying university with Draco Malfoy on the floor beneath him (similar).
“Am I going to have to start dressing like Morag?” said Hermione, unremarked by all around her.
Seamus turned. His nostrils flared, his mouth twisted into an ugly grimace. “Sorry, Potter, was I keeping you from your hot date?”
Somewhere out there, his father was probably fucking laughing.
“More than touching Harry? More than touching Blaise?”
“Oh,” said Harry, “yeah.” Then – “I don’t hate you, though. I think. I don’t know. It was great sex, though.”
“Hmm.” Draco frowned. “It sounds unnatural.”
“Good. Then, dancing?”
“But not me,” said Draco.
table service, thank Merlin. I wouldn’t wait at this bar for all the galleons in Gringotts.”
“But that’s my favourite game,” said Malfoy, almost a whisper. They were very close together, Malfoy’s head practically in Harry’s shoulder. He hadn’t realised the slight height he had on Malfoy, or the muscle build. Their thighs were almost touching. When had they last been this close? The Room of Requirements, Malfoy’s thighs squeezing his. Right now, it felt like their breaths were intermingling.
He’d bared his teeth. “Just talk? Bit rich from the girl who’s been bitching at Ron Weasley as foreplay for three years.”
And then he turned back to Seamus and Dean, apparently deciding that the conversation was over, to hold forth on the many values of Mariah Carey. As if he hadn’t just thrown a bomb into Harry’s mind.
“It’s fine,” he said. “You should probably go to bed, Hannah. I think everyone’s just a little drunk.”
Harry patted his shoulder. “I love you too, but you both have constitutions of tissue.”
“Fuck off, Malfoy,” said Harry.
“Eighty-five.”
“But they’re always so funny - “
Neville was still looking at him, quiet and intense.
Oh, she liked that. She stuck her chin out imperiously. “Go on.”
“I forgot to ask – how’s Pansy? I haven’t gotten round to – “
“So, nice night out,” said Harry.
“Right,” said Harry.
He slumped. “Yeah.”
“What is your problem,” said Dean. “Ever since I came out, you’ve been weird. You’ve been fucking avoiding me, and then acting like you haven’t, and if you’re going to be a homophobic tosser about this again at least let me know so that I don’t keep trying with this friendship.”
“I’m just wondering how you’ve come to this realisation.”
“Or doing anything – anything at all – that isn’t talking about Malfoy, before Morag puts us all out of our misery and Kevadra’s you?”
“Why?”
“You dolled up for the Yule ball, though.”
The shots leant the evening an edge of unreality, and the rounds system broke down as soon as Susan got too pissed to keep track properly. A DJ started blasting top hits from a decade ago, which meant Blaise screamed “this is my
“Hey.” There was Neville with a beer in each hand. “Saw you come out here. Want a beer?”
Draco had said, as they rolled in bed together.
“She has twenty-eight piercings, Harry. Some are in places I can’t name without squeezing my legs together. The woman has endured pain none of us can even imagine.”
And him hard as fuck, moaning as Harry just took him, just took what he wanted. Thinking about how lucky it was that he got to see this, how lucky he’d been if his whole shit-waste of a life ended up with him here on the bedroom floor making Harry come.
you mean. First name basis now, Potter.”
“No, Malfoy. Look.”
and Hermione had made him cross out
Unfortunately for Draco, love seemed to have left him in kind of a daze, so he didn’t make his escape in time when Potter dropped into the chair opposite him in the library.
“I’m in love with you,” said Harry.
“You’re incorrigible.”
He patted her shoulder unsteadily. “Not like that, I’m sorry. You’re really pretty. You know you’re pretty. Everyone loves you. Everyone hates me. Who wants ol’ Seamus?”
“You’re nervous?” said Draco. “I’m the one who has to deal with you fumbling about in my arse.”
“None, all of them, and zero. You called me Draco.”
“Uh,” said Harry, unsure on his territory. This was brushing dangerously close to talking about the war, something that by mutual consent they Did Not Do after the last time. “I asked if I could take you.”
“Ah yes,” said Blaise, pouring again. “A certain Hufflepuff ice queen. Another!” And he repeated the whole show again, Michael copying, struggling and spluttering by the time he came back up.
“Better than anyone I know.”
“I think Terry Boot just came by to ask you on a date,” said Harry. “I might have accidentally scared him off. Sorry.”
“What made you happy, Harry?” she’d said.
“I’ll walk up with you, Harry,” said Dean, and Harry smiled gratefully as they fitted their arms together. A muscle in Seamus’s jaw twitched. They made it up the carpet, Harry’s smile slowly turning into a homicidal grimace, passing Hermione and Parvati who seemed to be stopping at every single reporter and talking about their dresses.
“If all that’s separating you from sucking Zabini’s cock is a drink or two, maybe you’re not that straight,” said Dean. He was snarling now.
Dean shrugged. “What else can I do?”
“I want you so much,” said Seamus, staring him down. He was poised on the balls of his toes, arms outspread like he was commanding the rain. He looked like a dare. He looked like a broken man. “I want you so much that it’s almost killing me. And I have tried to destroy it but I can’t. Because – here’s something fun for you, Dean – my mum wouldn’t just feel uncomfortable, and make award jokes about me being gay, or stumble over the word partner. My mum would never, ever talk to me again. My dad neither. I would be dead to them. I’m not bi, Dean. I’m not, so I can’t just hope to end up with a woman. Do you know how absolutely blitzed I had to get to shag Hannah? But I can’t be gay, because then I’d just be broken. So I’m nothing, Dean, I’m nothing except this great big pile of hatred and want.”
She didn’t want to, not really. She’d never thought that she and Parvati would have much in common – but she’d never thought she could be a Ravenclaw heart throb, either, or apart from Ron, or apologised to by Draco Malfoy.
“No,” said Blaise. His smile had far too many teeth. “We Slytherins all already knew how, having been raised in the civilized world. Can we help you, Harry?”
“Malfoy.”
“Doesn’t feel much like winning,” said Harry, without meaning too. “Half my friends are dead.”
“So, don’t take this the wrong way,” he said, leaning forward. “But at school you were quite, uh – “
“Virtue ethics determines an action’s rightness or wrongness depending on whether or not it aligns with a particular set of virtues,” she said, ignoring him completely.
He was just entertaining a vivid fantasy of finding out about Ron and Hermione’s wedding through the newspapers when he turned a corner and found Draco Malfoy, drinking alone on a bench at the edge of the Royal College’s grounds.
“Don’t need to,” she said. “Weasley minor’s dragging me along.”
“Had a little drinking competition.”
“You are?” said Parvati, poking her head out of the kitchen door.
“Ok, good. Wait, no. Whatever. Anyway, Lavender was always so pretty and polished and put together. She used three different perfumes, did you know? Applied in three different ways. And I’m – “ She gestured at herself.
“Woah,” said Hannah. “Fancy kissing me, Harry?”
“Well, I suppose we’ll just have to make the best of a bad situation,” said Hermione, flipping a pancake with far more force than necessary. “I certainly plan to. I have many, many plans for this party.”
“Hmm,” said Parvati. “And he does give off the impression that he’d be absolutely filthy in bed.”
what’s wrong. I’m behaving like a love-sick fool who – “ He broke off. “Fuck. Granger, you’re a sensible girl. Is there an – an – anti-amortentia? Asking for a friend.”
Harry thought about asking him why, and decided against it. He had no idea if wanting Draco to talk to him was some kind of sexual-awakening induced mania bought on by the kitchen boner, but that didn’t mean he wanted him to stop. “All right. Does the rapport have to involve talking about Dean’s dick?”
“Well,” said Blaise idly. “I’ve gotten you drunk and been a perfect gentleman. I suppose it’s time for us to have sex now.”
There was a lot in that statement that Harry didn’t think he had time to unpack. “Uh, it’s just sex. I think. And she might be seeing Terry Boot too.”
“Uh huh,” said Morag.
“Don’t. Call me Malfoy. It makes it easier.” It had begun to rain around them. Draco tilted his head up and let the water run down his neck. “It’s better if I remember what I am to you. When you say my name when we fuck it almost sounds like you care about me.”
It was nice outside,
“Don’t you dare, Potter,” muttered Draco murderously, but seven years of instincts were not easily repressed and Harry was already waving Hermione and Ron into their hiding place. They crowded in, closing the door silently just as Susan stormed into the courtyard.
Hermione’s drink was flavoured with Parma Violets, and came with a little packet of the sweets balanced on top. It had cost the better part of twenty pounds.
- and Hannah Abbot was doing a wonderful job of distracting Seamus from glaring daggers at the Slytherins, but especially Blaise. He was, Harry noticed, not sitting next to Dean, and Dean was carefully not looking at him.
“Really?”
“Hermione,” said Harry. “Who’s in your flat?”
“Found her,” said Dean, scanning the garden. “Looks like they’ve been beaten out. She’s looking pretty cosy with Anthony over there.”
“Hermione says I lack the necessary precision require to duel perfectly,” said Harry.
The evening was surprisingly pleasant. Hermione and Pansy were cautiously circling each other, but in a friendly seeming way. Like dogs sniffing each other’s bums or something. Draco and Pansy kept trying to one up each other with embarrassing stories. The appletinis were flowing. Life was good.
“I’m trying to have a successful date, you used up whore, so back off.”
It was time to do what Blaise had suggested at the start of term, and ignore Potter completely. He opened the door, ready to face a brave new world, and found Potter
“Am I really frumpy? I mean, I think I am. I know I am. Does knowing make it better? Maybe if I’m self-aware of it I can kind of pull it off in an ironic way.”
“Don’t.”
“Here you go.”
Harry looked up, like an idiot. What did he expect to find, a phoenix? But no, there was mistletoe, cheerfully menacing.
“Why?”
“Do you think this is funny for me, Blaise? Having you flirt with me all the time? It’s fucking excruciating.”
“The triangle,” said Morag, po-faced, and Harry collapsed with laughter.
She slammed her fist on the table. “I get to decide if I hate him for that, Harry!”
“Communications, maybe? You were quite good at dealing with the press for a while – “
Dean whooped. “You didn’t have to say the bisexual bit, Harry.”
bloody black dog – wouldn’t flatten his mood.
Seamus was still slumped over when Dean appeared on the other side of the lake. He moved to come forward, then stopped, pointed at Seamus and gestured questioningly. Morag gave him a thumbs up, and watched as he turned and walked away.
“Prick.”
“I can’t imagine you dealing with drunk people politely.”
“Oh, fuck this,” said Hermione, clearing the table with a discreet charm. She looked up and found everyone staring at her with raised eyebrows. “What? Uni is about trying new things. I’m trying saying ‘fuck’. I’ve been thinking it for the past seven years.”
Hermione waved her arm. “So basically the whole thing was a disaster.”
“Ok,” said Harry, wondering whether to mention that Hermione already knew. He decided against it. “Can you do to me what I did to you, that last time? With the lube?”
He raced up to Draco’s rooms when he got back. Draco was leaning against the sink in his bathroom, carefully brushing his hair. He always looked so neat, so calm. It made Harry want to ruffle him up again.
“Fuck yeah.”
“Hah. You’d be a terrible dictator.”
“I mean, she’s not the best at it either, is she?”
“I don’t know what happened, Potter,” she said. “But I know something did.”
“Nope!” she squeaked. Ugh. “No,” she tried again, in a lower tone of voice. Too low. Now she sounded like she was growling at her. “No, I haven’t.”
“Don’t worry. Do you think it’s too late to pop over to Diagon?”
“Those can scar, you know,” said Harry mildly as Michael blubbered beneath them.
“You all right, mate?”
“Harry! Dean! Seamus!” said Blaise. “So good to see you, my fellow studious…studious…students! Do come and join us. Sit down, sit down.”
“I came to apologise,” he said, all in a rush. She gaped.
simply fucking. Potter was simply experimenting with his sexuality, and Draco was someone he didn’t care about and could therefore fuck with.
“You clearly don’t want to talk to me – “
“ – Togeth – sorry, what did you say?”
“In that I would have
“Well, I’ve changed too. Plus there’s not a war on anymore.”
“Don’t say the word. Please. Sorry. I still have – I just don’t think I could hear it. Coming from you.”
It wasn’t even that Draco was handsome – he’d known that for ages. He’d probably known that since he was about twelve years old and noticed that Pansy Parkinson wouldn’t let go of him. It was that Draco was ridiculous. Possibly actually bonkers. It was that he would run himself ragged trying to give his friend a happy ending. It was – and this could not be over stated – because he wasn’t a fucking terrorist anymore, and therefore just Draco.
“Do you mean that or are you just scared of crying women?”
“Struggling, Potter? That doesn’t surprise me.”
“All right,” she said, chewing on her last strip of bacon. “Good theory.”
“That – that – that fucking – “
“Call Hannah,” she said between gritted teeth. “I don’t think I can cast a patronus right now.”
said Theo, with such bewildered disgust that Hermione howled with laughter.
Draco was still staring at him.
“Pansy’s nice,” said Theo mildly. “I think she’s gone a bit mad though.”
“Of course not,” said Blaise, through gritted teeth. “Because that would be a crime, and he definitely wouldn’t be stupid enough to talk about that in front of an auror.”
She got the details anyway. The details being that Draco was extremely fine with how things had ended with Potter, and just adored the way that he and Potter were now in sexless friendship, and he just loved spending time with Blaise and Seamus. He wasn’t thinking about Harry at all, except that he was, all the time, but that was fine. It was probably just something called the
“Great! So great. I’ve got to run. See you soon.” And Blaise took off at a sprint, still somehow moving with eerie grace.
And then Terry Boot said “Mistletoe.”
Hermione wrinkled her nose. “I don’t think we should treat our first year of academic studies as an excuse to drink constantly – “
“I know how you really feel about me, Parvati, and I’m done being your plaything.”
Looking at her now, Harry thought he could maybe see something of what Ron saw. She was never going to be pretty, but there was something faintly self-mocking about her prim little pout now. Her eyes were shrewd and intelligent; her dress was a violation of public decency. What had Ron said?
“No one is coming to save you, Michael,” said Blaise. “It’s Knockturn. You could howl all night. Shall we find out if you can do that?”
Harry leant against the wall and considered it. Malfoy was still not looking at him. Maybe he knew about his eyes and how they gave him away. His arms were held stiffly out from his body, his breath fast. He looked like he was bracing for a punch.
Hermione sighed. “For god’s sake, Seamus. It was
he wasn’t sick enough to collect on the bet.
“How drunk are you?” said Draco.
“What?” said Harry. “What?”
She shut her eyes and leant back on the dew-wet grass. “Do you remember when you apologised to me and I asked you if I was attractive?”
They smiled at each other, soft and exhausted and sad.
“Yes. It comes from an article by Laurel Ulrich, written about female Puritans in the United States. They
“Flattery will get you nowhere, Malfoy,” she said, smiling a little before she remembered who she was talking to. His face shuttered.
Dean looked wrecked, and no less hard. “Sea, I – “
And then the second – or maybe the third, or fourth, who was counting now – domino fell. Dean pulled away, teary eyed, and the door behind them opened and Draco walked out. Harry had a brief, violent out of body experience as he saw how the whole scene looked – Dean inches from his face, and Harry holding him close, and then he watched Draco’s eyes track up, up, up, Harry following him until he saw the mistletoe above his head.
“I don’t do that,” he said. “I’m Dean Thomas. I’m lovely and nice and polite and well-spoken so that nobody remembers I’m a six-foot-two mixed bisexual and starts throwing slurs. Me? Have feelings? Complex ones? Psshhhh.”
“Good grief,” muttered Blaise. “I’d rather blocked that aspect of it out.” He caught Harry’s black look, and sighed. “Sorry, Potter. Diggory was a good man, and had a hell of an ass. Pour one out, lads.” He dribbled his drink over the table, and after a moment of sighing, the others did the same – all except Daphne, who clutched her Bellini with renewed vigour.
“And his voice does the little squeaky thing – “
“Maybe it is,” he said, ignoring Hannah’s sharp breath. “You don’t know me.”
“Hey,” he said, jogging over to where Malfoy was smoking. He really didn’t want to do this, but there was an inner Hermione still yelling at him in his head. Why couldn’t he have dragged Parvati into his adventures instead? She seemed like she had much fewer morals. “I just wanted to apologise. That was really shitty, what I did last night.”
Lee smirked. “Want to do something brave now?”
“I hadn’t smoked before last week,” said Harry. “This is nice. This is the best way to smoke.”
“What?”
Harry did like it. Liked it so much that he was reduced to incoherence, hands scraping against the wall as he babbled. He felt messy, wet, open. There was nowhere to hide when someone was fucking you, fucking you so hard that the bed shuddered and the walls shook and his body felt like it was unravelling beneath Draco’s hands.
“Of course.”
“Hey Harry,” said Hermione. “Did you know that – that I – Parvati?”
He showered quickly, wanking off fast and gritting his teeth and not particularly enjoying it. He threw on some clothes and was halfway down the stairs to Hermione’s flat when he realised he didn’t know what room Malfoy was in.
enough to do anything to be married before her.
“I blame my mother,” he said, over coffee with Harry and Dean. “If she hadn’t been a paragon of the social graces, Blaise would never have asked me for my help. Oh, how I long to go back to those simple days of selecting the most elegant centrepiece. She always sent a message, that woman.”
“I’m so good,” he whispered back.
“Yeah,” said Harry, because he was the worst. “Sit down. Let’s catch up.”
“Right,” he said, in a very small voice, and Draco flashed him an odd look and went back to the previous silence.
“What if – look, you know I don’t know how I feel about kids, right?”
“I don’t know who I am outside being clever,” she whispered, “and my parents don’t remember me, and I broke up with Ron, and I’m worried that no one will ever love me once they see what a small thing I am inside. I don’t know who I want, or who I like, or what I want to be. I think I might have to change the world, and I’m not sure the world wants me to change it. And I – I’m not sure
“I know why I shouldn’t tell Potter – oh for god’s sake, tell
“Well,” said Parvati. She was carefully not looking at her. “That – that calls for shots, I think.” And she disappeared back to the bar, and didn’t raise the subject again.
Harry reached out and covered Draco’s hand with his own. Was it possible that Potter knew all about his horrible secret feelings and was, in fact, a secret sadist? He probably did. God, Granger had probably told him. She was too clever for her own good. Maybe he should reconcile with his parents just so he could buy her silence. How much would clothes for every house elf in Britain cost?
She shrugged. “Yeah, ok. Thanks.”
mum. My siblings all crack jokes about it. Just stupid, sexual shit, there’s nothing really meant by it, but it’s all about gay sex, you know? Like, we’ll be eating hot-dogs and one of them will go
He stalked towards Michael’s table, full of murderous intent that suddenly switched to convivial bonhomie when Michael looked up.
“So you’re here to do what? Tell me it’s ok to be gay? Give me a big speech on self-acceptance?”
“That is – oh screw you, I’m asking hypothetically.”
“I’m done with you, Blaise – “
“And even if she was, she had a thing with Lavender – fuck, I wasn’t supposed to tell you that.”
“Yeah,” he said. “You’re a nice guy, Neville. But you’re more than that, too.”
“I’ll do my best.”
“I should fucking coco,” said Draco, eyes closed. He looked like a very smug cat, which bought disturbing McGonagall related images to Harry’s mind that he really didn’t need in the wake of sex, thanks. “And this never happens again. Crystal?”
They were, but not because of the break-up. They were awkward because Ginny was crying a lot now, and Harry didn’t know how to deal with that, didn’t know if he had the right to. They were awkward because someone would always end up glancing to Fred’s hand on the clock, permanently pointing to
Parvati’s fingers laced through hers.
She was a wise woman, Alice Granger. Hermione should have listened to her more.
“All right, Harry?” There was Terry Boot, making his way down the corridor and looking particularly hale
playing muffled from within, with Dean and Seamus doing a lip-synced routine. The alcohol had apparently curtailed the awkwardness between them, and now they were the same as ever.
Malfoy just nodded. Harry smiled and wandered off. He had a date with his bed he was late for.
“But we should never do it again.”
“Stop flirting and help me claw the bitch’s face off!” screamed Pansy.
“Pretty much.”
- so Harry found himself with Hermione (who needed to take this for Law) at the back of one of the lecturing halls of the Royal College of Magic’s Muggle sister school, Royal Holloway, listening to
“Perhaps you can show me,” said Daphne, stepping closer and – was her hair twinkling? Her hair was definitely twinkling. This was such a bad idea.
Why on earth would a nipple be slippery? Harry never wanted to know. Maybe he’d ask Draco later. It certainly hadn’t
Draco smiled. “Well. Since you asked so nicely, Potter. Yes, Saturday sounds good.”
“Ok,” said Harry, after Malfoy had rattled off the orders. “I know what I’m about to say is going to make you hate me. Hate me even more. But let me get this round.”
“It’s not a competition.”
“Said it added to the thrill,” said Goyle.”
“Oh, you got chrysanthemums?” said Hermione. “Why?”
“She was non-evil, at least,” said Hermione, grimacing as she remembered Professor Stone’s lessons. “She was very keen on Harry. He kind of ended up teaching the class a lot.”
“Do you know what I wish,” said Dean.
“Fine,” said Harry, “but I pick Pansy.”
“Dare,” chorused all the Slytherins in time.
“Oh fuck you,” said Dean, grabbing Seamus by the bicep. “Why do you care if I do shag Harry? It’s none of your business who I fuck.”
“No, Potter, I’m trying to fuck her. It’s not using if it’s a good time for all, you small-minded Puritan. But you may be right, about making a move on Saturday. I’ll dance her, romance her, keep her sober enough to not treat it as a mistake – “
“I wondered if you wanted to go to a club opening?”
talking about Harry.
really giving me life advice?”
Susan looked ravishing in a black and silver wrap dress, and she was arguing hard with Blaise over some piece of legislation around giant rights. Harry had the impression that Blaise didn’t believe a word he was saying – every time Susan burst forth with a furry of well-formed arguments, his grin got a little bit wider.
“Sure,” said Draco. “Subject Dean and Blaise to socialising with a vocal homophobe, just so that Seamus can one day learn his lesson. Sod the damage to them.”
“With you?”
“I don’t understand what’s happening here,” said Harry. His head was completely empty. Why was he such a crap liar? How had he ever survived his childhood? Maybe it was just Draco, and Draco-adjacent things that turned him into a fool.
“Because then everyone will know that I can’t afford it.”
“No wait, I want to guess. You had such fun guessing about me and Ginny. Did they decide you were as much a disappointment a son as you were a Death Eater? It’s not a good look, Malfoy, incompetent
“If I didn’t want to talk to you, I wouldn’t be here, would I?” said Dean. Harry edged along, driven by unquenchable nosiness. Dean and Seamus were encamped behind a pair of mini firs, looking furious.
Theo wrinkled his nose. “That’s disgusting, Goyle.”
“Fair enough,” said Dean. “Come along, Seamus.”
“I needed to –
“Does
“How was everyone’s night?” said Harry, and received a ringing silence in response. Dean was staring out of the window, Terry and Anthony falling asleep on each other’s shoulders, Parvati fiddling with the strap of her dress. Morag glanced around and raised an eyebrow.
“Did. Don’t need that anymore, do they? No more Dark Lords.”
“Quidditch and glory, the unofficial house motto. Much better than the Ravenclaw’s unofficial motto.”
“Susan.”
“Why did you break up with poor old Ronald’s sister here?”
Harry jumped. The library was dark and quiet this time of night, and for a second he thought it was a ghost – maybe Snape’s, chasing him down from Hogwarts to sneer about his academics here too. But it was only Malfoy, tense and irritable and looking strangely like he’d been crying.
of that has ended up on my trousers – “ said an unforgettable voice, and then Harry rounded the corner and found Draco holding Theo Nott up by the armpits as he vomited into a bush.
The trick was just to hang on. To dig his nails into this friendship and refuse to let go through all the pain and hardship. Eventually things had to get better. They had to. It was actively impossible to be this miserable for his entire life.
“Any idea what they’re on about?” said Seamus.
“Oh for crying out loud, Blaise,” drawled Draco. “You wouldn’t be trying to suggest that our saviour would be anything other than straight as a ruler?”
“She was nice,” said Harry. “You should keep her around. Way better than Diamond.”
“Make them like me more,” said Malfoy. “Do you know why I suggested that round of shots? Because I am well aware that I’m currently having to buy friendship. It’s just like second year all over again.”
“I’ve never been a lesbian,” she said, with breathy wonder. “It sounds lovely. Never having to worry about men.”
“I kind of need a piss,” said Goyle. “Will you still be going when I come back or should I hold it?”
Harry considered this as he plated up the fry-up. On the one hand, Draco hadn’t actually said it was going to happen. Had said exactly the opposite. But. They hadn’t been able to keep their hands off each other. Draco had whispered that he was beautiful. Well, actually his precise words had been “
Blaise scrambled to his feet. “I was just going to find you – “
“Hanging out with your friends isn’t exactly an original concept, Dean,” said Hermione. “Anyway, none of them know anything about Muggle pubs, so they’ve ended up at a Weatherspoons.”
“Yes, actually. But it would be worse with you.” He stopped, biting his lip as though he wanted to chew it off so it couldn’t reveal any more.
“I hate it,” he said to Finnegan, who was apparently avoiding Thomas again. There was less open shunning going on, and more a bewildered sense of what-the-fuckery that followed the two of them about after Thomas’s little breakdown. Luckily, it meant that Draco still had someone to drink with who wouldn’t invite Harry bloody Potter. “I was under house arrest for a year. How the
They hadn’t said they were stopping. Draco had just been pissed at him. Maybe he could - ?
They stared at each other for a long moment, and then both collapsed into giggles, frantically shushing each other. It felt just like being back at Hogwarts again, slamming the portrait behind them as they  narrowly avoided Filch, but better.
“Exactly,” said Harry. “She’s very much not into him. So it’s all ok. Nothing to worry about here.”
“It doesn’t look any different,” he said, staring at the blocky little lump he called home.
“We both are,” said Harry. “Do you think she’ll ever leave that poor man alone?”
Susan whirled around at Blaise, her eyes sparkling. “I want you to leave me alone, Blaise, because I’ve had enough. I’ve had enough of you following me around everywhere, with this joke flirting and this over the top chivalry act. You think I don’t know what you’re doing? You think I haven’t had this before? Do you want to know how many times I got asked out as a joke? How many times I heard “Oi Susan, my mate fancies you” just to hear a chorus of ewws and giggles? You all think it’s funny, don’t you. Flirting with the fat girl. Oh, how sad, she thinks someone actually finds her attractive. Well, I’m not tolerating this bullshit anymore, and I haven’t fallen for it in a long time. I’ve spent my whole life wishing that each one was true, that maybe someone had bothered to look past their instinctive judgement that any woman over a size sixteen isn’t a person and discovered that I’m funny and intelligent and kind – and sexy, too, I’m hot as hell and I’m a lay and a half. I don’t need your jokes, Blaise, and I sure as hell don’t need your pity flirting. I do not need to be grateful for the scraps of attention the world gives me as some kind of charity for being fat. I’ll find someone who likes me for me, and if I don’t I’ll die alone happy as a clam and still loving myself. So you – you can fuck off.”
She looked at Parvati’s dress against her own. The way Parvati had insisted they go together. It wasn’t about the dresses matching. It’s that they were here together, and not as an accident – more as a fact of nature.
Seamus looked like he was having a breakdown. “Blaise Thin-Lizzy Zabini, you are a fucking legend. The boys are back in toooown!”
“Cobbled it together? Draco, this is the best bit of magic I’ve ever seen!” He grabbed Draco’s hands. “You’re bloody amazing, you are.”
“I think the night Sirius died was the night I became ok with the idea of not making it through the war,” he’d said, and Ron had nodded at the non-sequitur and held Harry’s hand.
“What have we done to him?” said Susan.
“Exactly.”
Hermione waved a hand. “Probably for the best. I’m not looking my most datable right now.”
“I can’t, Harry,” said Blaise miserably. “That’s not me. That’s not who I am.”
“Of course,” said Malfoy, equally nasty. “Can’t have a poofter as the heir to the Malfoy line, can they?”
“How do you know?”
Just for one kiss.
Parvati hummed and pulled her knees up to her chest. When the light struck her just right, it turned her cheekbones sharper than metal. She looked alien, intense, unknowable.
“I’m sure Pansy would agree that we need to talk. Right, Parkinson?”
Blaise looked half-guilty. “Didn’t mean to cause trouble in paradise.”
“What about Ron? I’m glad he’s friends with Pansy. I don’t care what he does with his life.”
“Weasley,” he said, stiff and awkward. Merlin, he probably looked like such a twat. Well, he
“I’m so sorry. That was such a shitty thing to say.”
But she was still a good friend, so she made sure to check in with Harry, who was continuing to be annoying about Malfoy, though in a new, fun way. ‘Fun’ here being used in it’s lesser used meaning as a synonym for ‘excruciating’.
He asked Dean about it when they went up to the bar for their next round – Susan was insisting that everyone paid for at least one, which meant that they were going to end the night barely upright – and Dean leant against the bar, downing the last of his pint.
“Ok, ok,” said Draco. “Stop for a second. First, aren’t we a bit old to be all house-rivalry about this? I’m a Slytherin, and I’ll always be a Slytherin – and so will you, and I don’t plan to ever be ashamed of that. But the core of Slytherin is ambition, and cunning and loyalty. Not hating the ‘other side’. For god’s sake, weren’t Salazar and Godric rumoured to be, uh – you know.”
“Sorry, sorry, just give me a second.” Seamus ran to his room, and was back a second later holding a CD. “Is this your dad?”
“I – I – “
“Is Hermione coming?”
well behaved women. Her point was that women only get written about when they do something big and crazy and break the mold. The vast majority of women were out there doing exactly what they were supposed to do, living up to the female ideal. They lived these quiet, unexciting lives probably filled with a thousand quiet dramas, shaping history in their own way, but they don’t get written about. They get ignored.”
“We’re going to figure something out, ok?” Hannah pulled her in closer
to cover the absolute skull-fuckery of that night.”
Predictably, the universe shoved him and Malfoy together the next morning. Kind of. It slightly nudged him together. Harry did most of the rest of the work himself.
“Never have I ever snogged everyone at this table,” said Parvati, with a wicked grin.
Harry left them to it, and took the tea that Anthony offered him. Then it was just him and Draco, leaning on either side of Hermione’s door.
“What thing?”
Theo sneered, but in a way that looked marginally more friendly. “God, don’t. One-time Snape caught us in the Astronomy tower. He took ten points away each for the drugs and thirty each for not ‘properly ensuring the quality of our ingredients.’”
She laughed. “Why? So you can talk me into getting back together with you?”
She lay on the grass and started to giggle too, both of them laughing and laughing until they wore themselves out. The drink and the kiss and the exhaustion were combining into a soft numbness that was the next best thing to actually feeling good.
“For fuck’s sake, Bones, I just don’t understand how you’re managing to be insulted by the fact that I’m interested.”
“I heard that this is the most haunted uni in England,” one of the excited freshers was saying to another, as Harry struggled not to smile. “Apparently Thomas Holloway was into black magic and shit. Some say they see him running around the grounds in the form of a devilish black dog.”
He peered at her. “Hermione, when was the last time you slept?”
“And how are you? With the – thing?”
When he came back out, he found Blaise and Susan in the garden, joined by Dean and Seamus. They had also managed to get hold of some weed, and Harry took the proffered joint from Blaise’s fingers.
“I need a piss,” said Harry. “You can keep going until I come back.” He actually needed to throw up, but he wasn’t about to tell anyone that. Draco would probably inscribe it on a banner.
“I am here,” said Draco. “And no, Weasley, we were not being bisexual in this cupboard.”
“That’s a shit line.”
“Scared of Pansy. Who could be scared of a ginger?”
“Oh gosh, I’m so sorry!” She buried her head in her hands. She did remember, actually. He’d shaken her hand afterwards, with patches of his fringe still smoking. “You were very gracious about it.”
But there were little moments where the pain of not talking about it was almost too much. When Draco was making coffee for them and bitching about his professor, his hands moving through the air like he was sketching the lecturer’s incompetence. Or when he caught sight of Harry trying to dodge an over-enthusiastic fan on a day out shopping and mouthed ‘famous Harry Potter’ at him with such a trademark leer that Harry burst out laughing and the fan, clearly worried, offered him a hankie. Or when Blaise told a story about the first time Draco got high – holding off Draco with o nr hand, who was trying to fling himself boldly on Blaise to shut him up.
“You do look pretty good tonight, Potter,” said Draco. Was that his bedroom voice? What was going on?
Knowing his luck, he’d probably survive the fall.
“Was she right?”
A door opened somewhere in the apartment, and they jumped apart, guilty and twitchy and, in Harry’s case, confusingly half-hard. He thought vigorously of Filch and Umbridge making out, and prayed Malfoy didn’t look down. Theodore Nott came down the corridor, whistling aimlessly. He stopped when he saw the two of them, lurking guiltily in the kitchen doorway.
“Go on,” said Padma, clapping her hands. “It’s Christmas.”
“I’m helping him take his first steps into the real world,” he said. “Today he becomes a man.”
“And some of us haven’t got the option. That bra must be older than your ugly cat now.”
“Do you not want him to date someone else?”
Blaise’s handsome face twisted miserably. “I don’t – I don’t know.”
“It looks more like a date-rape, are you fucking serious –“
“Everyone knows, Potter! Subtlety has never been one of your strong suits! Look, I just want you to – I want you to – “
“Don’t.”
Harry closed his eyes. “All right. I’m sorry about first year, when I didn’t take your hand. Yeah, you were rude, but that must have been embarrassing. I’m sorry about the time I helped Fred and George set up a fire-work to follow you around the on your broom during Quidditch practise.”
“Isn’t that good?”
“I started shagging Potter,” said Draco, nodding wisely. “And his personality vastly improved, and your gratitude overwhelmed your good sense.”
“What?”
He was nearly out of the door when Harry blocked his way with his arm. “No. No you don’t. I’m too hungover to play silly buggers.”
“So what?” said Dean. “What’s wrong with that?”
“Fuck off, Harry.” He hammered on Seamus’s door. “Oi, Seamus! Open up! Get out here!”
“Brill,” said Harry, and then did.
“Oh I could have done that. ‘Harry now, entering the zone, reaching for the schnapps. His fingers are trembling – will it make it to his mouth?’ Who against?”
So Michael did. And he drank. He told them that Susan had been a frightfully dull conversationalist as he finished off the bottle. He told them that she was acting far too picky for someone with a body like that as Blaise called for more whiskeys. He told them that he’d been a perfect gentleman all night, and it wasn’t his fault she didn’t appreciate that as she should, while Blaise nodded and made soothing sounds and announced that that called for a round of shots. He told them, over and over, that he’d only been trying to be nice, that she was probably a fucking virgin anyway. And he drank, and drank and drank while Blaise smiled darkly and poured his own drinks away when Michael wasn’t looking.
“You almost make me wish I’d gone to uni,” said Pansy, watching Hermione with newfound fascination.
“It’s not,” said Harry. “I know that you’ve got reason to be a bit sensitive about these things lately. I just wish you’d come to me and told me the truth.”
“Yes,” said Blaise, slightly less patiently.
“I just – “ She put her head in her hands. “He’s got really big shoulders. Really big shoulders, Draco. And big hands. And he should be cocky and obnoxious, with a body like that, but he isn’t – he does these little movements, sometimes, these little gestures, and they’re so gangly and awkward and sweet. And he really is brave, and good, and strong, and – well, he’s such a fucking Gryffindor, but it turns out I’m kind of into that. And when I’m mean to him, he apologises. He doesn’t just go, “oh that’s Pansy, she’s kind of a bitch”. He actually wants to work out what’s wrong, and he tries to cheer my up in these stupid hamfisted ways that actually totally work. Oh fuck, Draco. I want to have his babies. Our kids would be so ugly.”
There had to be some way to make this, whatever he’d done, ok. He thought of all those golden moments with Draco, the way they’d twined in bed afterwards and chatted about nothing. That couldn’t be over, could it? Not when Draco was the one who’d pushed him away. He’d pushed him away – and there was the anger, flying with the fear like two Seekers chasing a snitch around his stomach.
The arm-holding lasted until they arrived at the street outside Eclectic and the sparkle of flash-bulbs lit up ahead of them. There was an honest-to-god red carpet next to the queue inside, and Harry had a horrible feeling he’d be expected to walk up it. Draco jumped away like he’d been burnt.
“There’s one person,” she admitted, because she was drunk and stupid. “But I don’t – I can’t talk about it.”
Hermione traced her fingers around the rim of her glass. “I spent my whole life knowing I couldn’t be this. And that should have been fine, you know? Sure, I’m not very pretty and I’m not very friendly, but I’m fucking
“The hair thing was just racism,” said Parvati.
“So the club,” said Harry, desperate to be saved from the many values of Pansy Parkinson.
Seamus laughed and pulled away from him. “Better go check that out, right?”
“Right.
She trailed off. Parvati was smiling at her politely, and Hermione suddenly remembered why she didn’t
“Er, what?”
“You’re going to kill me.”
She tossed her hair. “You know what they say, you should try everything once except for incest and morris dancing.”
“You weren’t actually going to Crucio him, were you? Because I’d probably have to fight you.”
“I don’t know what there is to say about it,” Dean said. “I loved him. He kissed me. He had a mental breakdown. He’s not here. End of story.”
It was the day after the Yule Ball when everyone had gone back to not looking twice at her. It was –
“I’m standing still,” said Theo. “You stop moving, and I’ll move around you.”
Hermione burst into tears.
He remembered once, in sixth year, he’d actually bought it up. In a dickish way, of course, because sixth year hadn’t been his proudest moment. Pansy had cornered him and tried to force out from him what was going on with him.
Harry took the hand that was offered him, and stood up. Draco was only a few inches away, and it was a weird rerun of earlier – as if all the crazy stuff that had happened in between had meant nothing, it was just a sideshow that they had to get out of the way before they could get back to this moment.
“I’m not going to talk about Harry,” he said, when she gently approached him outside a lecture and invited him for a coffee.
“It’s so typical of Potter,” he said, as he was winding up his monologue. “Invading every corner of my brain, when he hasn’t been remotely invited.”
“Fuck,” said Draco. “All right, Weasley, you’re with me. No offence, Granger.”
“Here,” she said, handing him the bottle. “Down as much as you can without vomiting.” She waited as he drank and then took it back, having a bit more herself for good measure before the boy necked it all.
“Susan?”
“I could have a go at taking over the world if it would make you feel better.”
“Am I?”
“Which was?”
McGonagall hadn’t. Hermione had, storming up to him while he was considering trying to teach the Giant Squid to play catch and dropping a bunch of prospectus’s in front of him.
“Unfortunately that’s where I live, Potter. What with my eternal shunning from the Malfoy bloodline.”
He resolved not to think too hard about Malfoy all night. There were fourteen of them, he wouldn’t need to interact with the git. He was just helping along his rehabilitation, that was all.  And if Blaise and Nott were invited, it would have been rude not to invite him too. Unfortunately, he seemed to be in the corner of his vision every time he turned around, chatting to Morag or whispering to Nott or scowling at one of Blaise’s jokes. Even the barman looked a little bit like him – a short version of him, who clearly thought he was too good to serve anyone drinks. Harry commented as much to Hermione.
“Harry, you great big – sex-haver! You were having sex!”
“Pans…”
“If he’s dead, we don’t have to carry him up to his room,” said Draco, which was a fair point.
“Since the Yule ball. I mean, I think probably some of them had a crush on you anyway – you were so smart – but after the Yule ball you became, like, the Ravenclaw pin-up girl.”
It’s not like he ever apologised, after the war.”
“Harry.”
“Hermione – “
“Nah, you cretins, it’s the name of a song – ok, who’s got a CD player? We’re getting wild tonight, lads. We’re drinking with rock royalty. Oh my god, Zabini – Dean, move over, I’ve got a new best friend.”
“Number five.”
“You got this?” he said, jerking his chin at Nott.
So this time,
“Dish,” sniggered Hermione. “Dish the dirt on the boys.”
Malfoy laughed. “Potter, that place was unquestionably a shithole, and I saw the guy pocket several fivers that should have gone in the till. Making him think I was legally shady probably helped.”
“Hermione – “ Malfoy snarled. “That lying sneak.”
“Out of interest, what should I have gone for?” said Theo. “Just in case, you know?”
“Maybe,” he said. “I don’t know. We’ll see.”
“I’m in love with Parvati!” said Hermione.
The next morning he woke up hungover and furious and half-hard and thought
“It was second year. Hermione made the potion.”
“Ah.” Draco giggled, and then began to laugh.
“Not now, Potter,” said Draco. “Padma’s telling us about life in the fashion industry – “
“Oh.” She almost laughed. “Oh, thank god. Wait, am I obvious?”
“Is it? I mean sure, there’s nothing wrong with peach. Absolutely nothing wrong. It’s like she bypassed anything with flair and went straight to the don’t-notice-me section of the colour wheel.”
“Yeah,” he said, whispering. “I’m – I love him.”
“In your robe?” said Anthony. He sounded extremely polite.
“You should kiss her now,” said Padma.
“Gryffin-DORRRRR!”
“The great Harry Potter, admitting to being afraid?”
“All right, I’ll ask Nott then.”
so there’s some nice anti-Finnegan sentiment going. I think Hermione’s whipping people up and demanding that no one talk to him until he’s apologised.”
“I’m sorry,” said Michael, whimpering. “I’ll drop out, I’ll transfer, I promise - “
“I don’t think it is. That’s a shit ending to a story.”
“I have tried so very, very hard to forget.”
“I haven’t actually said I love you, Harry.”
“Knowing the indomitable Ms Granger, she’ll likely develop three new fields of magic in the process,” said Terry dreamily, and Morag poked him in the side and snickered.
“My kinks are wide and varied.”
“That wasn’t your fault,” said Malfoy softly.
After a few seconds, he rapped harder.
“Me too.” Their faces were so close. “I can do anything when I’m drunk. I’m fucking untouchable when I’m drunk.”
Harry looked back, to where Hannah was still standing in the kitchen. “I don’t think – “
Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Time to expertly lie his way out of this. “I’d really rather not,” he said.
“Thrilling,” said Hermione. “I finished all my law reading early, so then I ended up looking at Harry’s course – he’s doing teaching – and going down a rabbit hole of muggle versus wizarding law surrounding education. Did you know that legally, Muggle schools have one person who’s the point of contact for making sure that children aren’t being mistreated at home? I’ve been thinking about whether it’s possible we could implement a kind of social services in the wizard world, make sure that nobody has to leave Hogwarts over the holidays if their homes aren’t the kind of places a child should be raised. I wrote to Shacklebolt about it, and…”
“Terrible,” said Seamus, with feeling. Dean caught Harry’s eyes and smiled.
“You – no.”
“I’m fine,” he said. “Honestly, I’m fine. I’m just going to – check on Dean,” he finished lamely, as Hermione was ignoring him now in favour of Anthony’s mouth.
He was laughing.
“Oh.” He gulped as he looked at Harry. “Hello, Potter, come to help us out?”
“If you can’t – “
“Give me a cigarette,” he said, and Malfoy handed one to him with no argument, offering the lighter afterwards. He caught the way Ron’s eyes widened at the casual gesture of – of non-hatred. Yeah.
“Are you really going to be scared off just because Draco’s acting prissy? Blaise was right, you two are a shitshow together.”
There was a terrible beat of silence. And then Pansy whirled on Blaise. “You said you told him!”
“What?”
“Thursday, why?”
“The point of virtue ethics is that there very much is a right way to be a person.”
“You?”
“I am aware that being near me probably brings back memories of my – memories you don’t want.” His eyes were fixed on a point just left of her shoulder. “I asked the university to change my room. Not because you’re – because I thought you wouldn’t want to see me. No one would. I’m sorry for what my family did. And what I did. I’m not trying to get rid of my personal responsibility – I’m sorry, I didn’t practise this.”
Potter,” hissed Malfoy, who had apparently been standing right beside him. He knew the bartender of course – he had gotten a job here, and it was apparent from their short and sulky conversation that the two of them did not like each other.
“People only really started trying to kill me when I was eleven,” said Harry. Draco looked astonishingly well put together as always, his grey beanie turning his paleness elfin. It matched his horrible eyes. With his pea-coat and his skinny black trousers he looked like a French art student, or an off duty model. With his eyebrow raised like that he looked – like he was waiting for Harry to finish staring at him like an idiot.
“Susan was just what?” And there she was in the doorway, eyes red. “Susan was pissed off at you, and rightfully so? Susan gave you exactly what you had coming?.”
“Yeah, maybe. Actually no. His best friend is being a right arse. When you came out, were your friends – actually, don’t answer that. Blaise has already told me exactly how supportive he was of your sexuality.”
She shrugged. “I don’t know what you want me to say, Harry. Hooray, Malfoy’s changed? What does that change for you?”
“I still haven’t come out to him. I just don’t have the words to do it, you know? We haven’t really spoken about the things he said at the party. We each said we were drunk and apologised for being bitchy, but I think we both know it’s a topic we don’t really want to touch. Every time I try and bring it up, he just starts talking about something else. I get the impression he does know, and he doesn’t want me to say. Like he thinks he can convince me to stay in the closet for the rest of our lives so he won’t have to deal. The worst thing is that I think – I think I might actually do it, if it was for him.”
“He’s the worst, isn’t he?” said Pansy.
“Bugger. I knew I didn’t understand it.”
“There, there,” said Blaise, refilling Michael’s glass. He tipped the bottle to his own, but nothing came out. Harry caught his quick wink over the glass. “Tell us all about it.”
