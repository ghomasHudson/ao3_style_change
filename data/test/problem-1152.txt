And Harry wouldn’t take advantage of him while he was like this.

He reached out through their bond, seeking his Alpha’s emotional embrace. Harry’s emotions bled through the cracks of his shield, tendrils of
Draco let out a soft cry, submissively baring his throat. With the tip of Harry’s cock pressing against his entrance, his Omega side took over once again.

Though it seemed sacrilegious to his dead friends and family, he was in
Draco nodded slowly. “I know. I know that you do, and that’s okay. Sometimes, we can’t help who we love, even if that person isn’t worth loving.”
Without thought, Harry reached out and brushed back an errant strand of Draco’s hair.
Harry sighed, running a hand through his hair. “Your mother was at the Ministry yesterday. She may have…mentioned that you were in heat. I was worried, so I went to check on you.”
There was no
When Harry gave a curt nod and disappeared through the Floo, it didn’t escape his notice how his pup went still beneath his hand rubbing his belly.
Draco flushed, feeling all eyes on him. “When I had him, the healers couldn’t stop fawning over him…”
Harry’s arm shot forward, wrapping his fingers around his wrist and jostling him. “
Harry’s cock rubbed against that euphoric spot inside of him at the same time Harry’s mouth pulled his milk from his breast, the suction and intense pleasure making him come with a shocked whimper.
(See the end of the chapter for
He immediately released Harry’s arm and protectively hugged his stomach, pressing back against the dividing wall. “W-what do you mean by that?”
Some splattered against Draco’s cheek, making him groan and breaking him from his desirous thoughts.
to you, Draco?” Harry taunted cruelly, sliding his fingers into his hair and gently tugging at his roots.
Harry took him outside of his cage for an hour or two each day, allowing him to hop around his bedroom as he worked. The rabbit would tire easily, curling up next to Harry’s feet and falling asleep.

. In pain and
But he couldn’t stop.
The smooth, jeweled black surface shone under the light, a sharp contrast to Draco’s porcelain skin.
Harry snapped out of it, loosening his grip around the boy’s thighs.
To his complete shock, he felt nothing.
Draco had asked Kreacher to bring him a book on magical Omega pregnancies and what to expect. He knew the house-elf had requested permission from Harry first. One evening, the book had appeared on the nightstand next to his bed, so he guessed Harry was okay with him learning about his own body.
“Come in,” he called out.
Harry felt like a fucking arsehole for turning her down, but it was for the best. He didn’t want to get into a relationship with her again just because it would provide him a convenient distraction. She deserved better than that.
The sound of resounding crack echoed throughout the manor, making Draco and Narcissa startle.
”These fucking intrusive thoughts,” Harry murmured, realizing that his cigarette had been burned down to the filter.
“Careful, pet,” Harry rasped.
She wasn’t who he wanted.
smiled.
Draco’s eyes darted nervously between Harry and the door of the bedroom.
Harry closed the distance between them, gently capturing his wrist and raising it to press a kiss to the back of it. “I do, Draco. I want this. I want you,
. Ruminate on that for the next seven days and get some sleep, pet.”
”S-sometimes. I used a dildo once, b-but it wasn’t enough,” he mewled.
Harry realized that this whole trust gaining process was going to be more difficult than he had initially thought.
Harry closed the distance between them in two steps. “It would. Are you worried of what your father will think?”
Maybe Draco wanted that. Someone younger with the seal of approval from
. He hated
Draco padded further into the kitchen, stopping in front of the long wooden table right across from Harry. He placed his hands on his hips, feeling ridiculous because the sleeves of Harry’s shirt hung past his hands. Although he probably didn’t appear very intimidating to the tall Alpha, he didn’t
The kitchen at least had more lighting than the rest of the house, even if it was artificial. Three pendant lights hung from the ceiling above the long, wooden table, a decorative bronze cage enclosing the lightbulbs within.
for your Alpha,” he growled against Draco’s ear.
Scorpius whined and Draco pulled him close, allowing him to to nuzzle against the scent gland on his neck. Scorpius quieted, sighing contentedly as he scented his neck.
The boy let out a high-pitched moan when Harry pressed his tongue even lower, against his leaking hole. The sweet taste of his slick emboldened Harry, making him push his stiffened tongue past the tight ring of muscles.
All that mattered now was his jellybean.
He had everything he wanted.
He hadn’t looked at that picture in a long time.
Harry placed his hands on either side of Draco’s head on the stall divider wall, bracketing him in.
When Ginny disappeared inside, Harry waved his hand in front of his cigarette, igniting it with his magic.
Harry roughly pressed his clawed finger into the boy’s slick-covered hole, not caring if he tore the boy’s delicate opening.
“It also won’t rectify any problems left behind. To stay and face your fears, that is true bravery. For a person to
That couldn’t have been
Draco began clumsily pumping the dildo in and out of his hole, matching the pace of Harry’s hand pumping his own cock.
“You’re going to see
“Your shirt and slacks,” he said coolly. “They’re wet.”
To avoid suspicion, Draco told his mother he was visiting Blaise.
Potter didn’t seem to care. He hefted Draco up bodily into his arms and paid no mind to his desperate flailing.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I shouldn’t have asked. It’s none of my business.”
The smell and taste of the boy’s slick had Harry’s fist flying up and down over his cock, a burning feeling deliciously building at the base of his spine.
He lifted their joined hands and pulled Draco’s hand towards his lips, pressing a chaste kiss to one of his fingers that sent a jolt of heat straight to his heart and traveled throughout his whole body, warming him from within.
He steeled his gaze, refusing to look away. “I promise, Harry.”
!” Scorpius squealed, reaching for him with outstretched arms.
Harry allowed himself to study the boy, his knot still connecting them.
Just as it was in Harry’s nature to want to protect and care for Draco.
They both turned in unison, still holding each other.
Draco felt a tinge of
His rabbit glared up at him, angrily yanking his shirt down.
Draco swallowed thickly, staring up at him and trying to ignore how his heartbeat accelerated.
boy, aren’t you?”
At the base of the boy’s spine, Harry could see the round outline of the boy’s scut vibrating under his shirt as he scratched.
Under the Alpha’s touch, he felt a small flutter in his stomach. A small whimper escaped Draco, his hand shooting down to press overtop Harry’s on his stomach.
Gritting his teeth, he pivoted on his heel and stormed from the room.
A Malfoy dud.
Lucius’ cheeks took on a tinge of red, his eyes becoming glacial. “And I’m supposed to believe that? The last time we let you have unhindered freedom; you came home pregnant and with no mate to show for it.”

The girl sighed loudly and eyed him disapprovingly. “Well, if you’re not going to talk, you can at least help me. Bring me those spices from the rack behind you.”

Scorpius looked up at him expectantly, smiling, a dimple appearing on his left chubby cheek. Draco smiled back, his nerves calming somewhat at the sight of his happy baby.
Pansy grinned, her long black ears erect with delight, the torn one drooping slightly lower assumedly from cartilage damage.

Harry deepened the kiss, tilting his head slightly for better access. Draco didn’t know what to do, so he hesitantly brushed his tongue against Harry’s. The taste of Harry’s saliva against his tongue made him softly moan, sliding his hands up and twining them around Harry’s neck, his eyes sliding shut in surrender.
”Hello, sweetling,” Harry cooed.
Draco flushed and covered his chest with his arm, still embarrassed by how swollen his breasts had become in the past few months.
They both froze, going silent.

Harry leaned over and nuzzled against the shell of Draco’s ear, making him shiver. “Say it again,” he murmured softly.
Harry ignored him, sucking one of Draco’s swollen nipples into his hot mouth.

Draco searched Harry’s eyes, logic and arousal warring within him, but most of all, his heart
When Draco bent down to retrieve it, Harry beat him to it.
Ginny set the glass half-full of amber liquid in front of Draco on the table. He eyed the glass, already unsure about his hastily made decision to drink. Without giving it anymore thought, he picked it up and knocked it back.
Draco imagined Harry, dropping to his knees before him, nuzzling and kissing his stomach.
Harry stopped licking to kiss and suck at the boy’s sac, muttering, “So sweet, all
Without speaking, Draco scooted backwards off his lap and got to his knees between Harry’s spread legs.
Harry stood at the end of the bed, his eyes darkening as they raked over Draco.
”Are you—enjoying this?”
It was an Alpha’s duty to make sure his Omega was happy and comfortable to be able to care for their young.
Harry knew it was about building trust, but trust between a carnivore and herbivore was laughable to some.
He let out a low groan and sucked the wet bud into his mouth, hollowing his cheeks as he pulled milk from the boy’s swollen tit. The taste of Draco’s milk against his tongue made his cock pulse with
Harry took his trembling hand into his own, rubbing his thumb in small circles against his skin. “Why don’t we go lay down for a while, sweetheart? You’re tired. You know what Arlen said about your stress levels.”
It was late, but he couldn’t sleep. His thoughts kept drifting to Draco and Scorpius, sleeping in his guest room upstairs.
“Say it again.”
“Yes,” he admitted. “Yes, it still hurts to think about him, but that’s okay. It’s okay because I have you now. You make me happy, Jellybean, and those unpleasant memories don’t hurt as much whenever I’m with you.”
Harry’s eyes narrowed, and Draco noticed that the eyebrow on the right side of his face was still intact, but a deep burn scar was slashed down the middle.
Harry stood and slowly walked around the table, stopping directly in front of Draco. His pheromones permeated the air, thick and dominating.
She stood tense for a few moments before sighing, her shoulders loosening.
”Dada is only trying to clean you, little one. Nothing more, I promise.”
“Sorry to disappoint, little one,” Harry said dryly.
“You’re so bloody
“You’ll be a good mate, Harry. You’ve always been a natural protector.”
Draco averted her gaze, staring at the floor in shame.

Harry gave a low chuckle. “
Draco frowned. “Mrs. McGonagall instructed me not to leave the manor and that all of my assigned duties were to remain inside. She was very adamant about that when she detailed my job duties.”
Harry was standing in the doorway, one outstretched arm resting on the frame. His black button-down was open at the throat, revealing his tanned skin and hint of chest hair. His sleeves were rolled up, showcasing his corded forearms.
Narcissa laughed, hollow and rough, like dry kindling over dying embers.
He didn’t have anyone to confide in and the portrait in the forbidden room provided him an outlet.

since you went into heat this morning.”
“You act as if you’ve never heard such things. Don’t try to fool me, boy. I know a desperate omega when I see one. You’d rub up against any alpha with a knot that would get you through your heat, as if that little scene with the stable boy wasn’t evidence enough.”
Hermione shook her head. “It’s quite all right, Draco. I remember what it was like. Go get some rest and I’ll see you next week, okay?”
The older beta girl had taken him under her wing the past week, showing him where things in the manor were and how Mrs. McGonagall liked things done. He was appreciative of her help, but it seemed she was still wary of who

“If you want me to beg, Draco, I will. I’ve wanted you since the first moment I laid eyes on you in your parents’ garden. If you really don’t want this, I’ll leave, and I won’t contact you again.” He lifted his hand to let his fingertips brush over his scent gland on his neck, making Draco whimper. “But if you want this, I want
beg if you want me to—”
But all he had was the here and now.
He began pulling his wand from his pocket, but Harry stopped him.
Draco, still flushing, nodded. “Please, Auror Potter.”
“I mean,” Harry fought to control the tone of his voice, “I think you should release the boy into my care. I’m unmated and you can trust me to ensure that the boy behaves outside of his mother’s influence. We don’t know what kind of information Narcissa has been feeding him over the subsequent years. She could have still been active as a Death Eater and any information Draco has in relation to that could be invaluable to the Ministry.”
The first time Pomfrey came to check on Blaise and ease a few potions down his unresponsive throat, Seamus noticed. But eventually he stopped registering her visits altogether.
Harry’s brow shuttered. “What are you talking about? This isn’t about guilt, this is about gratitude. For risking your life.”
He opened his eyes and found that Ginny’s were wide and fixed on him. Draco realised he had no idea what he looked like. He wondered what she saw.
*		*		*
He tried the door again before Harry could respond, but it remained steadfastly shut and he could still feel the other man’s presence behind him like a shadow. There was movement as Harry shifted.
Harry sat up, dangling his legs over the side of the bed. Luna was still singing, even so late at night. Harry didn’t want to think why; he liked the blank wall that stood between him and the reality of the war and the ugly things it was doing to the people he cared about.
“Do you know what I’ve done for you?” Draco’s voice shook to slivers. “I’ve killed for you. I’ve given up my life for you. I’ve lied and used people I loved. For you. Why did I do that?” A new horror—an old one. “Theodore…”
“I can’t do this to him.” It came out in a rush, hissed words. His chest contracted. “I—”
It felt blasphemous to ask, to seek a story from this, as though he were reading a book. The look that came into Malfoy’s eyes only made his stomach twist.
By the time Malfoy fell silent, the constant catch of his voice sat heavily in the room. Glistening trails wound their way down his cheeks. Harry stared at the wall, seeing Narcissa Malfoy’s twisted body imprinted there.
He was resisting. No matter. Harry already knew what the answer would be.
“What’s the word from Guernsey?” Moody inquired.
are you injured, too?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“N—” Hermione caught herself before the instinctive response slipped free. She clutched the arm of her chair with both hands. It felt good, whatever Luna was doing. But Hermione couldn’t ignore the nagging memory of an owlish girl who read books upside down and walked quite blissfully into cobwebby statues without noticing a thing. And here Luna was now, fussing around inside her body.
He winced. “Ginny.”
Had Harry and Draco become friends when she wasn’t looking? Before the war, she would have laughed aloud at such an idea.
“Couldn’t sleep. And you’re awake. I’m glad. Kept missing you.”
“Millicent.” Breathe. “What are you doing?”
“I don’t think so. Perhaps if they’d gone through the full magical binding as well as the physical binding. Seamus described emotions, feelings. And dreams. I daresay the bond you two will undertake will be quite a bit more complex. Based upon this partial bond, your abilities will be something to behold.”
Dumbledore continued.
smart.”
Apparition. Subtle seeking spells.
But the Healer looked even less inclined to speak than before. She rubbed the fingers of one hand with the other. “I believe I’ve managed to stabilise him. He’s very sick, and I just don’t know if—At any rate, he’s not getting worse, at least not at the moment. But there are discrepancies. Things I couldn’t explain at first. I spent all last night casting spells.” At last, she looked up from the table. “Can either of you tell me how long Mr Finnigan and Mr Zabini have been intimately involved?”
All he wanted now was Draco. And to live. As it turned out, he most likely wouldn’t have either.
She stalked up and jabbed him in the chest with her finger.
Harry needed to touch him, to feel the life within this body. He’d not managed to take it away yet; for reasons he couldn’t fathom, he’d been granted a reprieve in spite of his stupidity. Draco was here, moving under him and against him and

know either way. There are more immediate questions to be answered!”
“Potter! So polite to come meet me.”
Her head bobbed like a heavy weight on her neck. “And he does, every time. Every single time, his body attempts to pull itself back up. But that’s during the times when you feel him in pain, Seamus. The periods of calm are the exact opposite: he collapses then, deeper with each. He’s no longer fighting then, and so the pain subsides. In time, I don’t think he’ll have the ability to come up from it again.”
Luna sang on.
It was the fifth day. Blaise had been careful to double-check, to keep his watch dry and his dates straight. The fifth day since Draco had walked off into the darkness with Ginny behind him. The fifth day since he’d seen Seamus, or anyone that he knew, for that matter. He had only to wait until night fell to find a way inside the castle’s new wards and breach the inner chambers.
ed again and got up. He stumped creakily about the room, back in forth in front of the hearth.
“You’re just going to let him in? Like he’s some sort of ally?”
“I know,” she muttered. “You chose well.”
Hermione jumped. Looked around. But no one else seemed to have heard a thing. She swallowed. Bowed her head and whispered, “Luna?”
A terrible calm rolled through Draco’s mind as his options became clear. He gripped his pack in a sweaty palm. It had come to this at last. And he wasn’t even fighting the idea. Something in him protested feebly, reminded him of the injustice, that he didn’t deserve this sort of end, it wasn’t his responsibility for fuck’s sake, but Draco silenced it. He waited until the nearest Death Eater had gone nearly out of view, then turned to face Weasley.
Draco felt sick all of the sudden. “Me too,” he choked out.

for those small, fleeting moments. He wanted his Alpha back, but he was afraid he had ruined whatever connection they had before he had revealed the truth to Harry.
“Fuck, the way you’re
Harry rolled his eyes and used his magic to slam the door on Jack.
Whatever Draco wanted him to see, he wasn’t sure if he was ready. He admittedly was still hurt, his pride still stinging from Draco’s rejection.
Shoving some of his dark hair away from his face, Potter’s eyes cut to Draco. He flinched, sidling closer to Pansy.
Are you sure you don’t want to know the sex?”
And the slow, lazy way Harry had been taking him...
”Stop, p-please, I’ll come if you keep—“
Draco held his tongue, not wanting to get in trouble with the master of the manor on the first day. When he remained silent, the man’s eyes dropped back down the papers he held.
Harry cupped Draco’s face and turned it towards him. “
He looked refined and composed, his arms crossed over his broad chest.
”So how did you end up finding her after all this time?”
. Threatening the boy’s mother seemed to be the only thing that got through to him, so he would do what he must.
Harry pulled back, casting him a patient look. “Cease your crying, pet. I won’t have it, not tonight.”
It was raining again.
Draco’s lips parted in surprise, his cheeks suffusing with heat. “Where did you get that? That was supposed to be private, Potter!”
Harry winked at him and Draco felt his heart trip.
when he was around his Alpha.
He attempted to bring his magic to the surface, but it quickly fizzled out as another wave of cramping pain seized him, disarming him completely.
It was Draco himself that had ensnared him.
Harry cut him off with a slow kiss, his tongue meeting his. They lazily kissed, Harry playfully nipping at his lower lip before he pulled back.
The unmated Alpha within Harry could sense Draco’s need for him. Every time he was around the beautiful creature, his Alpha prowled the perimeters of his mind, just waiting to pounce.
“I’m not your
“Well, what better time than the present, pet? Now,
“Okay,” he said softly. “I’ll do it.”
Harry gave him a sheepish smile, draping his arm down against the back of the sofa behind Draco’s head.
His mouth tightened slightly before his eyes flicked back up.

Draco shot her a withering look. “I know what to do with my own child, Mum. I only breastfeed him if he’s upset and needs comforting. It’s not a regular occurrence.”
Draco whimpered and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, pressing their chests together as he continued ruthlessly pounding into him, chasing his own orgasm.
Draco set Scorpius on his feet and watched as their pup clumsily rushed over to Harry. Harry immediately stooped and swept Scorpius into his awaiting arms, chuckling.

Draco shook his head and tried to scoot further away, but Harry grabbed his ankle and dragged him underneath of him.
Harry pulled back, sliding his mouth lower to lick and suck at Draco’s marked gland. Draco’s breath hitched when he felt Harry’s erection prodding between his arse, rubbing against his covered hole. He pressed down on the rigid length, earning a low growl from Harry.
“Thank you for allowing us to stay over. I hope your girlfriend returns safe from her trip. Goodbye, Mr. Potter.”
Draco sat up straighter. “It’s all right, Hermione. I don’t mind at all.”
Narcissa glanced up, her eyes widening with surprise. “Oh, just ignore me. I tend to overshare, Mr. Potter. Draco would be so cross with me if he found I was divulging so much. Mummy worries too much, doesn’t he, dearest?” she asked Scorpius, nuzzling against the top of his head.
She nodded, catching his hand in hers and holding it. It infuriated him. He tried to yank out of her grip, but she held on. “I know, Seamus. I know. But that was one spell that you were suffering from. I could heal the damage, I could replace the blood you’d lost. We still had time. So many things have gone wrong in Blaise’s body that there’s too much to fix. I don’t know how the bond has kept him alive as long as it has, but…” She looked straight into his eyes, and he could see she was trying not to cry. “Right now, it’s the
Hermione stood there looking at Draco as if she’d just—
*		*		*
It was at the exact instant that he felt the damp cling of the sheets at his back that he realised he hadn’t heard Seamus’ gentle breaths. A long, uneasy rasp rattled in his ear and the indefinable burn blossomed heavily in the pit of his belly. Blaise struggled onto his elbows and looked at Seamus to find freckles standing out stark and livid against white… greying skin. Seamus’ eyelids were half closed; the dull sheen of blue irises was barely visible.
Until he moved. A step to the side, turning from them as though he hadn’t even seen them, and then Harry could feel the unsettling judder of Seamus’ one-sided bond as though it had crept under his skin, too.
“Here.”
Draco exhaled. “But why all of this? There are protective spells. Strong ones. Simpler.”
“Luminare.”
The next day they were sent their separate ways, and Blaise first realised just how costly a blunder their accidental bonding would be. The chills at night shook him; every sound was a thunderous drum in his ears. He felt as though he’d swallowed something too large and it stuck there deep in his chest, sharp-edged. It was nothing but a stroke of luck that he did not run into any Death Eaters.
She told herself that maybe the bond was contingent upon it, maybe every embrace and touch had to occur a certain way. The spell was so old that no one really knew how it would manifest. Other ancient spells were going into it to bind their magic as well, so the outcome was even less predictable. Ginny had never given much thought to Harry’s restraint, far too distracted by her own delight that he’d come back to her at last.
Harry straightened. He let the room fill with discordant music again, and then spoke. “There was never anything to change,” he said quietly.
“So.” And there they were, at that subject already. She didn’t think she’d ever be prepared to talk about it candidly. It was sex, in every sense of the word, and Harry was the end of the line. It didn’t surprise her how willing she was to commit to the idea of forever. She’d known it for months now. But there had never been an alternative in all those months, and Harry’s response meant absolutely everything now.
Draco’s hand rose, brushing over the cut, over Harry’s fingers. Draco pulled his hand away, letting it fall back to his side. His eyes closed. “She hit me.”
Their own Apparition shields must have come down by now.
“Damn it, Malfoy, if she stops, the wards will fall!”
“Yeah.” He struggled to sit up, pushing his hair back. Blaise’s head turned very slightly on the pillow, and Seamus inhaled sharply. But Madam Pomfrey’s eyes only grew more somber. She sighed and flicked her wand, casting a silencing barrier around the two beds. She sat down carefully on the edge of Seamus’, placing her hands in her lap.
have this power, Harry. Should or should not… You have it. They have given it to you.”
“I merely suggested him, Harry, if you’ll remember.”
In the time it took for Katie to say the words, Harry saw that Malfoy did not have his wand—it was in Dean’s hand—and his cloak was ragged at the edges. He stood with thin hands raised, hair brushed back from his face as if he had tried, but failed, to retain his old habits. It was the expression Malfoy wore that caught Harry, however. The narrow features he remembered so well were hollowed out. Years had carved their way into Malfoy’s face. He held steady, eyes half-closed, but he wasn’t looking at anything. The grey irises were glassy.
“Then…” Her shoulders jumped and she put her face in her hands. “Oh god, Harry, I don’t even—”
Footsteps came at a run, and then Harry skidded around a corner near the top of the staircase. When he saw her, his eyes widened. “Ginny!”
Draco frowned. “Of course I’m alright. What could have possibly happened to me here in this prison?”
“I thought so, but I couldn’t find anything in his body or his blood. None of those spells last very long, but if he’d cast one or drunk any such potion in the last few days, the signs would be there. There’s nothing.”
“Luna will call us,” she tried. “When it’s time.”
Harry shoved at his hair, cursing. Not today. He didn’t want to think about it today, not with the return of two sorely sought friends, not when things might actually be looking up. But it was getting much harder to fight off the truths he didn’t want. Each day that passed nudged him closer and closer to facing his future.
Weasley strode into the room, much taller than he had any right to be, tossed his sweater over the sofa, and froze. A furious twist struggled over his features and he opened his mouth. Draco waited dully for the outburst.
By the fifth floor, Hermione could distinguish the crack and sizzle of individual spells.
Ron gripped her shoulders. “S’all right, there are other ways out.”
Harry dropped his voice and locked Malfoy’s wide eyes with his. “Just for me, then. Tell me what happened that night. On the roof.”
Not when every touch Harry shared with Draco was a slice into Seamus’ already bloodied flesh. Not when he could feel every inch of their strength in every inch of his raw wound.
Malfoy’s anger tore through the last of his walls. Suddenly he was no longer a surly child, but an infuriated man. “Fuck off, Weaslette.”
Draco nodded and watched as Blaise disappeared back into the throng of people gathered around the game booth.
“I don’t know if I can forgive him for what he’s done to me, but I can’t help but wonder if…”
He hooked one hand under Draco’s knee closest to him and spread him open, dropping his head between his legs to devour his hole.
”That’s an even bigger concern, Draco! Why would someone take the time to deconstruct our wards and break in, then not take
Harry couldn’t help but feel unease as the man’s yellow eyes skittered over him, fleeting but unnerving.
Harry clicked his tongue. “No more tears. I’m growing tired of this little dejected performance.”
Another soft caress against his stomach made him startle awake.
“Uncle Harry!”
He found himself entranced by everything the tall Alpha did. From the way his shoulder blades moved beneath his shirt on his broad back, to the way a lock of his raven hair kept falling forward before he would absentmindedly push it back.
her at St Mungo’s. She had only left his side because of Ron’s urgent message to come back home. He had seemed so small and defenseless in his hospital bed and she had already failed him as a friend by not noticing his silent cries for help over the past few months.
Scorpius whined and peeked over Draco’s shoulder, noticing Harry standing behind him. “Werewolf!”
Draco knew that’s what he liked most about him, his unwavering loyalty for himself and Scorpius.
Draco moaned, arching up from the bed until the hardened bud brushed against his lips, smearing warm milk across them.
Charlie Weasley was Ginny’s older brother and worked at the dragon sanctuary in Romania.
He knelt and helped Narcissa to her feet. She gave him a guarded, quizzical look, shrinking back in fear.
Harry stood, stepping away from Draco.
“Sorry, what?”
Harry rushed over, met with a bundle of blankets and sheets on the floor.
With the warm sunlight embracing them both and Hermione’s arms around him, he didn’t feel numb anymore.
Narcissa shook out her wrists and legs, still looking at him warily. “What are you doing, Harry?”
Harry lowered his hand and pressed it to the side of Draco’s stomach. Draco let out a relieved gasp when their pup immediately kicked in response.
Draco’s neck heated, memories from the night before drifting through his mind.
“I’ll see you later,
call me that.”
Harry lowered their joined hands back to the sofa and turned to look at his mother again. His free hand was still securely on Scorpius’ back, their pup nestled up against Harry’s heart as he continued to sleep.
Draco let out a choked whimper, arching his hips up from the bed.
No, he decided.
“Draco,” he said softly. “There’s something I want to talk with you about before I leave.”
He hated that his jellybean was between them, like a witness to Harry’s abusive behavior. He wanted Harry to fuck him like they always did, facing away from each other. This position was too...
Harry gave him another experimental scratch with his short claw, lifting his thigh to press harder between the boy’s thighs.
He knew what he had to do.
When he finally pulled his fingers away, he awkwardly cleared his throat. “There, do they feel any better now?”
Would his pale skin redden under his claws as he held his hips, rending him open with his cock?
He cried out, his prick hardening again between them, the painful bite of Harry’s teeth laced with burning pleasure.
No Alpha would be strong enough to protect them both, not like Harry could.
Draco’s eyes popped open, his arousal quickly dissipating due to Potter’s insulting words. The unknown desire that had been building like a forge within him burned away to ashes, shame and anger quickly replacing it.
Had he even brushed his hair that morning? He couldn’t remember. He had been so busy looking for Juni’s other shoe.
Harry resisted the inane urge to bare his teeth at his longtime friend and co-worker.
Alpha, the biological father of my child. If you don’t touch me, don’t

When he looked up to meet the man’s eyes, he found him staring down at him with a bored expression.
“Need to taste you, sweetheart,” Harry said gruffly, getting to his knees beside the sofa.
children, sweet one.”
Harry grasped him by both shoulders, trying to reign in his instinctual anger.
”I won’t torture us any longer, pet,” he promised, rearranging the boy so that he was on his hands and knees before him.
Draco moaned around his length, his tongue sliding against the sensitive underside in one slick, sinuous glide upward.
wasn’t practiced in the art of deception.
Harry quickly stood and grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair behind his desk before returning to sit next to Draco on the sofa.
The girl rolled her eyes. “What better time than now? Anyway, you’ll be busy with your chores for the next week and the master is leaving tomorrow for business.”
Harry leaned over him. “That’s the pup?”
The Healer was doing his examination in the drawing room of Harry’s home. Harry stood next to the sofa, watching him with an inscrutable gaze.
him, needed his healing saliva. When he was satisfied with that, he sat back on his haunches and untied Draco’s other wrist from the bed frame, gathering the writhing boy into his arms.
“Please be patient, love. I’m just talking,” Draco reassured, gently bouncing him on his hip.

Draco rocked his hips, letting out high-pitched whimpers and moans as Harry feasted on his hole.

…” Pansy whispered, her voice taking on a pitying lilt that made Draco’s insides shrivel.
!” Harry roared, reaching down with one clawed hand to hike up the hem of the boy’s shirt. He pressed his claws to the curve of his rabbit’s arse, digging his claws into his delicate skin.
“I’ll deliver your letter to your mother, Draco. I’ll make sure she knows
He bumped into something hard mid-step, almost falling backwards in surprise. Strong fingers wrapped around his upper arms, steadying him and keeping him upright.
A spike of panic lanced him, his pulse quickening at Harry’s threat.
Draco set down the dildo and lowered his shaky fingers to his hole, intending to prepare himself.
A light rain had started to fall, the droplets soaking into his thin jacket and dampening his hair.
His dada stood taller, blocking their view of him behind his back. “What I said, Hermione. He won’t speak and I’m not going to force him into doing it.”
Harry rolled his eyes and sauntered over to him, stopping just in front of the porcelain tub. He reached out and hooked two fingers behind Draco’s wrist, giving it a tug.
A thin, almost nonexistent laceration was on her elbow.
“Have you weaned Scorpius yet, Draco?” he rasped, his eyes flicking down to Draco’s covered chest, his intent clear. “I dream about your taste, sweetheart. It’s been driving me fucking
piss on you to cover that offending scent.”
After Harry had saved him from the magical fire, Draco had been pulled back home by his mother. He hadn’t had a chance to see the damages done to his savior and part of him wished he still hadn’t.
. He didn’t want to scare Draco away again by acting possessive.
“Are you all right, darling?”
Draco swallowed thickly before replying, “That’s because there’s nothing to figure out,
“I don’t want to kiss you! You’re a horrible person and I want to save…” Draco trailed off, not meaning to share that much.
Theo grinned; his long fingers still wrapped around his wrist. “Look at that! She likes you, Draco.”
Ginny didn’t live with him. They had been dating for about a year now and Harry was still hesitant about committing. They often stayed at each other’s places, taking turns traveling back and forth.

The logical part of Draco recoiled in abject horror, wanting to get himself far away from this scary man and his proposed plans for his body.
Ron snort-laughed but was immediately shushed by Hermione.

Draco let out a choked hiccup, turning the knob and quickly shutting the door behind him.
Arlen nodded and stood. “Since your condition is currently delicate, Draco, I’ll make visits to your home instead of making you travel to the hospital. I’ll return next week to check up on your pup.”
?” Draco pushed up to his tip toes, pressing a soft kiss the underside of Harry’s jaw. A soft purr emanated from the back of his throat, his body recognizing it’s Alpha and feeling calmed in his presence.
“H-Harry,” Draco whined softly. “Sleep with us tonight?”
He didn’t know what had happened to the boy in the photograph.
The tiny pup opened and closed his small hands, reaching for Harry. “Bye bye, werewolf!”
He wouldn’t want another life. Not if it meant he had never gotten pregnant with—
Draco’s breath hitched, Harry’s soothing words like a balm on aching heart. He wanted to fall into his arms and beg forgiveness for his hastily spoken words, but his pride held him back.
Draco huffed, crossing his arms over his chest. “From
His affection was one-sided. Draco didn’t want him.
“Even with your husband gone, even being pregnant, you’re still—” Harry scoffed and shook his head, looking off to the side.
Because that’s what Draco was. He was in love in with Harry Potter.
Several diners’ heads turned in unison, their eyes widening in obvious shock at Harry’s appearance.
Yeah, time. That was all he needed and then…
“Why are you doing security detail anyway?” Draco spat, digging his nails into the sleeves of Harry’s coat. “Shouldn’t the Chosen One be off galivanting across the globe, spreading tales of your
Draco looked down at his daughter, wrapping his free arm around her shoulders. Her innocent question reminded him of a conversation he had with her father, all those years ago.
“I would have loved you
Harry’s eyes moved down, catching on Draco’s twitching tail. A trail of clear, glistening slick had leaked from the boy’s hole, covering his inner thighs and pooling on the blanket under his hips.
But...
The sudden light had the creatures scrabbling to the back of their cages, their eyes wide with fear.
After licking and sucking at the boy’s hole for a while, he bit off one of his claws and sank his finger into Draco’s loosened hole.
The boy looked up, his eyes appearing watery. He pushed past Harry and clambered onto his bed, lying flat on his back. He pulled up his large shirt, exposing his prick and chest.
Harry dug his claws into his palms, the bite of pain needed to pull him from his primal state of mind.
“Draco, it’s time for us to go home. You haven’t ate since breakfast. Thank you for all you’ve done today, Arlen.”
Draco nodded, swallowing thickly.
Roland smiled at him, a charming divot appearing in his chin. “Finances, yes. I’m one of the financial advisors that work for the Ministry. I make sure budgets are set, to put it simply. If one too many Galleons are being spent on, let’s say, the Auror Department’s fieldwork potions, I come in and scale things back.”
The boy was openly moaning now, pressing his thighs together, his hands resting on top of Harry’s raised knees.
The boy moaned softly around his fingers, rocking his hips against Harry’s thigh.

Narcissa’s eyed widened, her shoulders loosening. “Draco? What about Draco?” she visibly swallowed, her cracked lips parting on a shaky exhale, “is he…all right?”
“L-like sexually?” Draco blurted, his cheeks heating.

Theo suddenly grabbed Draco’s wrist, directing his hand to behind the mare’s ear.

Harry’s question took Draco by surprise. He set his fork down and glanced up, meeting Harry’s hopeful gaze.
He knew how independent Draco was, and even though Harry wanted to protect and provide for his Omega, he admired Draco’s stubborn refusal to bend
One early morning, after the rabbit being in his animal form for nearly two weeks, Harry awoke to a surprise.
The blond tufts of hair sticking out from under the boy’s dark green knitted cap caught his attention. Though his back was to him, Harry could recognize him anywhere.
Draco’s blood went cold, keeping his gaze averted. “W-what do you mean, Harry? I could have said anything. I was in
“Any tenderness when I press here?”
“I wish I had never met you,” he whispered, hatred lacing his words.
Harry surprised him by cupping his cheek with his free hand, leaning down until they were eye-level.
“I’ve never had it, Harry,” Draco whispered back. “Just one, I promise.”

”We shouldn’t have—I didn’t mean to—“ he let out a small sob.
What he
The boy’s scut teased the head of Harry’s cock, adding a torturous sensation that had him gripping the sides of the tub.
He paused, placing his free hand on the top of his stomach, sliding it down slowly over his covered belly.

”Poor thing,” Harry tsked, letting one his claws brush against one the rabbit’s long ears. “Dada will take care of you, sweetheart.”
Pulling back, he leaned forward and sucked Draco’s small prick into his mouth, swirling his tongue around the head and playfully dipping it into his slit.
voice.
Draco trailed off once he glanced up, his eyes meeting a familiar green gaze.
Draco nodded, feeling like an idiot. “I don’t want them to hate me, Harry. I don’t want them to think…that I’m a bad person,” he admitted thickly.
When he could finally pull his eyes away from the scars on the right side of his face and over, Draco felt his chest tighten.
“So, you expect me to just be okay with all of this? I don’t even know why you’re being so cruel to me anyway! I’ve never done anything to anyone, and you’re subjecting me to all of this…”
“My baby,” Draco whispered, reaching over to card his fingers through his son’s soft hair.
requirements to the breeding law, however. Draco will have to be checked over at least once a month by a Healer from St Mungo’s and if he becomes pregnant, he will be under strict supervision of the hospital and the Ministry. All precautions, of course. A healthy, happy Omega means a healthy, happy pregnancy. You do understand, Harry?”
Harry could feel his knot swelling at the base of his shaft and was disappointed Draco wasn’t actually in heat.
The only indication that he actually understood Harry was when he would nod or shake his head in response to his

of Draco.
“Oh? Perhaps you want another part of me instead. I remember that you were quite fond of a certain appendage of mine, for days actually.”
“Could you go stay with your father and mother, just for a little while?”
Arlen left through the Floo, emerald flames engulfing him entirely before he disappeared.
His breath hitched.
Draco shook his head, inwardly fighting his instincts to lean into Harry’s embrace. “No. This pregnancy doesn’t change my feelings about you. You’re the reason I’m stressed, Harry. It’s better for me to be away from you, so
Draco sat up, clutching his now free hand against his chest protectively. “W-what?”

Harry hefted Draco’s bag higher on his shoulder and strode after him, the tether around his heart uncomfortably tight.
“Thanks for that. She worries I miss my meals when I work out here all day.”
Harry stared down at him with hooded eyes, that indifferent mask firmly in place.
Draco grimaced and left the kitchen, making his way back to the living room, towards the sliding double doors that acted as a partition between the dining area and the sitting area. They were closed now, and the sound of his dada’s muffled voice made him pause in his tracks.
Draco wasn’t even able to finish his sentence, cum suddenly spurting from his slit and splattering against his stomach and chest. Some of it hit Harry’s chin, making him smile against Draco’s nipple.
Draco shook his head again, biting his lower lip between his teeth.
Draco was emitting broken whines and keening moans that traveled straight to Harry’s throbbing cock.
He knew why.
Draco opened his eyes, his arms tightening around his heart. “A letter?”
,” Scorpius begged. “Please, Mummy.”
The substitute alpha he’d picked was Roland Tack.
Harry pulled up Draco’s long-sleeved shirt, exposing his stomach and chest. His nipples were now permanently swollen, readying to nurse his pup once it was born. He tried to raise his hands to shield the small swell of his stomach, but Harry knocked his hands away.
Draco Malfoy’s mother, Narcissa, continued pacing the floor in front of where he was seated on the chaise.
“Do you want some more, Harry?” Ginny asked, pointing to Harry’s tumbler on the table.
Enough.
“I had to do a bit of digging, but I was able to find it. I even got the help of the headmistress of Hogwarts. She used to be my professor, so it was fairly easy. I hope you don’t mind, I just thought…you’d want something to remember them.”

“I won’t lie to you, Draco. I eased your pain while you were in heat, but we

Harry pulled back, disgusted with himself.

“What did you two discuss?”
Draco swallowed nervously. “Harry, I—,” he trailed off, shaking his head.
”Well, I’ll let you know if I think of anything. I should take my son back inside now.”
“Go upstairs. Wait for me,” he ordered coolly.
Draco shifted on his lap, Harry’s erection steadily waning beneath him. “And you loved him?”
Draco
Draco scooted closer to her, still holding her hand within his own.
He regretted his decision to push Harry away and Harry had done nothing but be understanding to Draco’s fear and indecision.
Harry took a step towards them. “I didn’t mean it that way, Draco. I know you can take of yourself, I’m just worried. Leaving you and Scorpius alone—”
Harry let out a low chuckle. “You’ll never see her again, Draco. You belong to me now.”
His eyes searched Draco’s, once again trying to convey something to him that he had no idea of what was trying to be wordlessly said.
The rabbit’s tiny snores and warm breath gusting his skin as he slumbered, had made Harry felt possessive satisfaction.

Ron nodded. “Took Pansy nearly two weeks to be comfortable enough to change back. They have to be able to trust you first. Bloody fickle creatures, herbivores.”
He craned his neck to the side, unwittingly sniffing the air to follow the intoxicating scent with his nostrils.
“All right, I’m here now,” his mother said, taking a seat across from them in a velvet wingback chair. “It’s lovely to see you again, Harry. How are things at the Ministry?”
He grimaced into the empty hallway. “Well. He’s just like you now.”
Harry looked away. Nodded. Neville’s lips shaped a word that was never uttered. His right hand moved restlessly. “When?” he asked at last.
Pomfrey snorted, a brief and shocking return to levity. “It is not selective! There are several different forms of it noted in the books, and regardless of which form it takes, its powers of binding are simply incredible. What Voldemort, what we all have been doing to the world, must have unearthed it. There is so much we don’t know about this bond and what it does. It’s the basis of a number of linked bonding formations, and if both parties want it enough, it just… Oh, but they have to
not yet, just—just—
Blaise’s chest felt wrenched. As though he were bleeding out. Seamus’ words, the space between their bodies, all of it throbbed in places where he had no muscle, no sinew,
“Hermione,” he said in a low tone. “Why are you alone? Didn’t Seamus find you?”
Sloper’s sneer had been uglier than the suffering Harry had walked past in Azkaban. Harry had grabbed him, thrown him against the wall.
Draco crouched and slapped the Minis-port onto the flesh just at the felled woman’s nape. She vanished in a quiver of air. The voices in the woods were audible now, coming closer. The muted clap of Apparition echoed. The branch fell from Ginny’s grasp. Draco grabbed her hand, and they started to run.
Harry grabbed his arm, jerked him forward, and met Draco’s open mouth with his own. It hurt. Draco’s eyes flew wide. Harry’s tongue swept his mouth and the rest of Draco’s words choked in his throat. For one shattering moment he couldn’t breathe, couldn’t move. Then he grappled with Harry’s shoulders and forced him away.
“Sorry to disappoint you,” he said as calmly as he could manage. Her jaw clenched.
“Hey.” Blaise drew a deep breath and let it out. “You’re up late.”
“You can’t do this.” She took his arm. Her grip was strong and would have been comforting if not for the hollowness of it: there were still things she didn’t know and until she did, any comfort she gave would not ring true.
Draco’s throat rattled as he inhaled, and he felt Harry’s hands cinch fiercely around his upper arms. Draco forced words out, a truth he wasn’t sure he understood.
sign. But she’d never expected to make it all the way to Harry without being harassed by something or other. Regardless of how far away Hannah and Hermione were with her wand, or how careful Draco Malfoy was—he’d left no trail that she could have followed and seemed to know every hiding place available in this county—her instincts told her that the Death Eaters would find them. Somehow, someway, even if it wasn’t until they were at the very door of the castle.
Many had gotten in. Pansy had, before. But Blaise could count on a single hand those who had gotten back out.
the person in the dark did not scream. Draco couldn’t see. A human being, wrapped in the black. Want surged through, rattled his bones, but it wasn’t his own desire. He keened, stretched forward for Harry. Had to be Harry, didn’t it have to be Harry? No one else—
A world of unfinished sentences skittered through him. He pursed his lips against them, but one got free. “I’m grateful you did leave me alone.”
He turned slowly in the middle of the room, at a loss as to what he was doing there. The nearest dais held a stack of books as tall as his torso. The hush of recognition crawled through him, and he moved closer.
Naadi has gifted us with two beautiful pieces of art for this chapter:
In the beginning, surprise had been more than enough. But as the Death Eaters developed better shielding spells, the potency of each vial became horrifying, a delicate balance perfected by the surviving experts on either side. Certain potions could be directed at certain people over short distances, provided one knew in advance who would be there.
Harry blushed. Did she see it all, or could she hear it? There was no telling what she knew and what she didn’t know. Harry recalled the slide of Draco’s hands down his chest and stomach, then lower, then a mouth. He shook his head, too unsettled by the thought of Luna having ‘witnessed’ it.
Heard the spell coming before he felt it.
Seamus gripped Blaise’s hand and watched the tear’s progress. “What?”
Harry nodded. “I’ll ask you to handle the selection of spells and the casters. Anyone you need.”
Harry crumpled, squeezed his eyes shut and swayed bodily into Draco’s legs. Draco moved instinctively, catching him, holding him upright for just one moment. He bent over Harry and cried into his hair, then pushed him away and left the room.
A thousand imagined reasons soared into Harry’s head, bumbling and cluttering around each other. The meaning of them all overwhelmed him and he shut his eyes briefly, trying to pinpoint the questions he had to ask to sort it all out. “How… Who came back?”
had climbed inside him.
He didn’t remember being prepared, didn’t even remember being unclothed. It was as though Harry was there before he was, following directions Draco never voiced. He clenched his hands over Harry’s shoulders, and then, dissatisfied, wound his arms beneath Harry’s, pulled Harry’s hips to his by the crook of an ankle and spread wide and—
Fred raised his head, features pinching. “What—George?” He struggled to sit up, wrestling with his blankets. “Is—”
They were not there. Malfoy’s face was still, weary around the edges of his mouth. His lips had parted and there was a tattered looseness to his expression: a need Harry had not seen in years, and never on that face. Some nightmarish dream lay behind his old adversary’s expression, waiting to be banished, explained away into the insignificance of such dreams—
She held George’s hand, listened to Fred breathing, and wondered helplessly where her friends were at that moment.
Malfoy looked back out of weary eyes. “Sanctuarium.”
Strong enough to swing a branch over her head.
No. Not this, not when he knew how it would all turn out. Not Draco. Anyone but Draco.
But the attempt at a smile faded on her lips. Malfoy’s face had paled: bloodless cheeks under darkening eyes. Ginny was caught in a tidal glare that stole all her words. With a jerk, Malfoy looked away.

He couldn’t think. Couldn’t make sense of it. It was an endless knot, one he had tied himself, and kept tightening because the inner loops were just too raw. Theodore was in there, tangled hopelessly with Harry, buried underneath him, dead, bloody, shoved aside like a broken Remembrall, and hurting so deeply.
Luna nodded, and filled the room with the next verse. She lifted her shoulders and let them drop.
**originally posted 4/30/07**
He knew Draco’s wounds because he’d bloody well put them there. He could see his signature on them just as if they bore his magical stamp. They might as well have; the thought flashed through Harry’s mind that he’d marked Draco with something of himself, something any Death Eater worth his or her salt could pick up on, and then he’d sent him into their very arms with the orders to get through at any cost. The idea was foolish, of course; Draco bore nothing of Harry’s magic, but still the danger hung there, along with the sour tang of Harry’s guilt.
The largest window held an ancient shield with three lions, claws outstretched and teeth bared, surrounding a large white rose. Golden banners fluttered along the edges, and the ornate glasswork shimmered. Time had long since forgotten the family that had dwelt here. It was not a line recognised in any Wizarding text, and there were no Muggles in the vicinity to offer an answer of their own. Harry knew this shield from somewhere back before real magic had edged into his consciousness. Some class at school, some book… But it had faded, pushed to the recesses by more pressing matters.
It would take time, but every ward was surmountable, especially the types he felt eddying through the air below. Pansy had given him enough to combat a third of what lay around the castle, and Draco’s ancient and dusty texts had been most helpful once devoid of their curses. If Blaise never looked at another tome again, it would be too soon. He’d lost more sleep than he wanted to admit committing the ponderous ward-breaking spells to memory. It was bad enough that he’d have to shed and use his own blood to get through them.
“No.” This time there was an edge to the word, and Ginny blinked. Wondered if he would offer anything else. But Draco only wrapped his cloak more tightly around himself.
“All the fucking time, Hermione!” he snapped, but she didn’t shy away, and he should have known she wouldn’t; he’d seen this light in her eyes before and he knew what happened after, without fail. Hell, he’d counted on it so many times he couldn’t remember them all.
“Three days ago.”
Dean Thomas stood in the centre of the hallway, his wand arm extended, but it was Katie Bell who was yelling, her face white with rage, at none other than Draco Malfoy. Jack Sloper stood behind him, an ugly look on his face, wand jabbing into Malfoy’s back. Tonks was off to one side, her wide eyes fixed on her cousin as if she could not quite believe what she… No, she was horrified. There was a sorrow on her face that Harry had never seen, not even during her morose periods. Her wand hung useless at her side, but that hardly mattered with the other three wands shoved into Malfoy’s throat and chest.
Harry shook his head, mouth clamped shut to hold back what was coming. But his shoulders had begun to tremble. Remus came around him slowly, one hand reaching, and Harry turned away again, but that hand caught him, smoothed over his arm, and drew him up short.

“I suspect all three are needed together in order to function as intended.” Su picked up a scroll and pointed at a painting of a very old three-point knot woven out of what looked like roots or branches. Upon closer inspection, the knots multiplied, growing smaller and smaller like a fractal, until Harry could no longer distinguish individual lines. “The color’s shot, but this tendril is supposed to be blue, this one red, and this one yellow. In the center, they all blend together until you can’t tell which is which.”
“I’m sor... I...”
“Can’t even just
Draco looked wrecked. Horrified and sick. His eyes tracked Harry’s face continuously and Harry summoned himself a little more. “M’fine.”
His self-conviction, unfortunately, still needed to be reaffirmed every time he thought about it.
“And it does not negate the fact that he could
“Tell him you’re in love with him.” It slid from him like water. Draco cleared his throat. “Tell him you love him, Blaise.”
“But this needs to be done, doesn’t it? Or we’re finished. This—you, me, even Nott. And if it’s what needs to happen, no matter what Harry says when we get there, I’m going to do it. Because there are people who have given everything to get me here. I want to give what I can to this, something I can like myself for. Even if Harry doesn’t want me to.”
The Mark seethed against white flesh, its edges red and raised. Harry could see the difference in skin texture: angry blisters, tender bruising. Under the snake’s lapping tongue, the wrist was raw and pink. Harry looked away. “How long has it been hurting?”
“We’re Gryffindors,” Hermione said, not sure why she was still nodding so fervently. “We should go to Gryffindor.”
Harry’s expression was saturated in anger, and getting darker. He scowled. “You are the world’s most selfish person, Malfoy.”
Footsteps skidded down the corridor and Oliver barrelled into the room. He ran to Luna’s side and dropped hard onto the floor by at her chair, sliding to a stop. “Luna, what the hell is going on?”
“Malfoy.” Harry stepped closer. Malfoy backed up and Harry raised a hand in placation. He reached for Malfoy’s left sleeve.
The song came as sweet and haunting as ever, but her face pinched, perplexed once more. Then she grinned openly.
But Hermione’s brew was the purest and cruelest that Harry had ever witnessed. It allowed nothing to escape. Harry had seen Death Eaters offer up the names of their own children in order to escape its relentless force.
Draco shook his head. Theodore was so pale now. The blood traced his lips in crimson lace. Draco fought with his own shirt sleeve and wiped it away. “Fuck it all, I’m not just going to leave you here!”
He had nothing to say. Emotions, yes, waiting to tear out of him; cries of betrayal, fury. But no words. Words had gone farther away than ever. Harry felt deserted in this warm room under the watchful eyes of the man he’d trusted for the last half of his life.
“Have you seen Seamus?” Blaise demanded.
On the fourth floor, they paused and regrouped inside the library, huddling behind the nearest bookcase. Footsteps ran past several times and Hermione nearly went out after them, just to see what was happening. God, if Harry was downstairs, if they were all fighting and she and Ron were stuck up here—
They hadn’t known what they were really doing until the fifth time, when the sting of Finnigan’s mere touch made Blaise bite through his lip to keep quiet, and taste blood until his climax. He still remembered the utter fear in the Finnigan’s eyes afterward, the graze of panting breath over his face. Blaise felt as though he were sizzling away under a flood of acid, more Finnigan’s body than his own. He’d gotten up without a word, walked outside in the rain, and threw up in the bushes until he was empty.
“Can’t say I was glad to be in London again,” Oliver managed between bites. “Half the buildings have come down. The Muggle Centrepoint is a wreck. The Strand’s completely shut down. And Buckingham… Well. The whole street up to Buckingham doesn’t exist anymore.”
Blaise licked his lips. He felt quite outside of himself, watching as another person who looked just like him waited for what was approaching. It wasn’t his tongue that slid around the slithery words one more time and spoke them aloud into the room.
Ron spoke up. “How many of you know Expelliarmus?”
There was movement out of the corner of his eye. Weasley’s eyes darted. Her gaze was shrewd and suspicious.
“This is war. When are you going to learn that there’s always some sort of ‘expense’?”
“He hasn’t spent it with me,” she managed to say. It came out calmly, and she was insanely proud of herself. “Been more interested in everyone else that’s arrived.”
“Pairs.”
More than once, Ginny caught herself wishing for him to be the way he had been, and then grew angry every time.
Seamus spun. Tears ran tracks down his cheeks.
Harry squeezed the armrest once more, wishing it was Malfoy’s arm instead, and rose to his feet. The door was closed again, with him on the other side this time. Malfoy’s side. Harry breathed deeply and thought of bandages, supplies. Food and water. He wondered about Malfoy’s left arm.
“Something seems to be interfering with the bond,” someone said over Harry’s shoulder, and Draco jumped, even though he’d known there was another person in the room. Logic, it seemed, had little staying power at the moment.
“Fuck,” she whispered. Draco stirred. His eyes brightened into hunted awareness.
Ginny woke at dusk from a very sensual dream.
Draco Malfoy, in love with Harry Potter? Yearning after him as if he had any right to do it.
“Anxious to see Harry again?” he said, lips thin.
He pushed his nose against Draco’s skin, smelled his scent. Sleep, the tang of sweat. “Does it feel wrong to you?”
A Reductor Curse blasted a huge slab of the wall to pieces, sending chunks of granite into the midst of the gaping Muggles. Death Eaters and their Order counterparts spilled through the smoking gap, and chaos erupted in the Muggle streets.
Oliver snorted. “It’s for shite. I didn’t bother to go inside. I’d have either been interrogated or killed, depending on whether I ran into an Auror first, or a trapped Death Eater. And I’m still not sure which group would have done what. At least the Ministry’s still pretending they’re the law and order of Wizardom in there. Keeps some of Voldemort’s crowd out of our hair.”
There was one left: resignation. For everything, even the thirst parching his throat. An odd calm had settled over him, and yet he seemed outside it still.
“Harry, what is it you feel for him?”
And then, silent.
It would have required sacrifices. Hundreds. And not all of them Muggle. And what had Riddle become as a result? It was unknown territory to the Wizarding world, but Blaise was certain that Voldemort was no longer fully human. If he ever had been.
Hermione gathered herself visibly and raised her chin again. “Harry.” It was more of a sigh than a word. “Sometimes things have to… be done. We may not like it, at all, we may
Draco fidgeted against the tree trunk yet again, scanning the forest as far as the gloom would allow. It was midday, and drizzly; the rain pattered like a muted drum on the canopy of leaves, seeping through to soak the soil. Except for the sound of the water, the woods were quiet, but Draco’s nerves were not. He couldn’t sit still. Something just felt… off. And bloody hell, there was no reason for it that he could see. He’d kept an extra close eye on their surroundings and an extra tight clamp on any discussions Weasley had felt the need to engage in. She’d long since given up; the last few hours had been waited out in tight-lipped silence.
Somehow he’d gotten Draco from the front hall to the kitchens, hoping that food and perhaps the time and space to clean himself up properly would put colour back into his cheeks. He’d already begun to forget what Draco’s eyes looked like enlivened, but the absence of that energy struck hard, winding him. When had he ever been close enough to understand it so thoroughly, to recognise all its facets? He hadn’t realised he’d formed an attachment to so intangible a thing until he saw Draco devoid of it.
Ginny went white. Her freckles were much too dark against her pallor. Something haunted crept into her face.
“Are you playing with our lives?” His voice was hoarse with feeling.
It struck Harry as incredibly funny. He snorted.
has always been in a sense irrelevant, a mere consequence of one’s desires.” He leaned closer. “Power has many facets, Harry. It takes every form. You have seen the power of fear and of deceit. Of loss. They are indeed substantial, and treacherous. But it is when that power is given over freely by others, and not taken from them, that it becomes the strongest.”
He didn’t think he could handle it. Mentally, physically, if this was what it meant to bond with someone, if this was what he’d be subjected to all the time—
With a start, Ginny remembered. “How’s your head?”
A silence fell, carrying a minor shockwave that rippled around the room. Hermione sat there holding the scrolls of calculations and spellwork they’d finally forced into working order, but her eyes were vacant. Harry knew what she was picturing: a time when this castle’s doors would have to be flung wide, the wards broken down, its denizens rushing out to meet their fate.
Ash-coloured eyes stared up from a wide-open face. Harry looked back, uncertain of the strange waver there. Draco’s cheeks were flushed, and the warmth of his body beat into Harry’s. He wanted to kiss Draco again, surprise him again, but he wasn’t sure he wanted Draco to be surprised by such a gesture. To look back at Harry as though he’d fallen open and could not draw himself together again. Draco shifted against the bedclothes, one bare leg sliding along Harry’s side, and Harry pulled further back. Draco’s throat was flecked here and there with the pinking ministrations of Harry’s mouth, and his chest rose and fell in an unsteady rhythm.
He wondered how long it would take them to break him; hours, days, weeks, until that moment when he spilled his secrets like so much blood. As long as it took to break Pansy? He had no idea how long that had been.
A few seconds later, it returned. He was moving.
“Is it all right?” Draco asked, trying to turn his thoughts from where they had gone. He gestured toward the window. “For him to be out there. Away from you, I mean.”
“Blaise?” Remus frowned.
“Parkinson is, and it’s not her choice, now is it?”
“Don’t you see, that’s the beauty of it,” Hermione said. “The spells are already there, in the mixing process! We didn’t have to develop any of these concoctions ourselves. We found all of the instructions in these papers. Wode and madder, and weld, too, which is yellow, have always been blended with magical protection in mind. The oldest magic users used the paints to shield their people in battle, Harry.”
“—Granger, tell her to stop!”
through him, eating up his muscles. Blaise cried out and let go, reaching for the hurt instead, the horror. He found his shirt ripped, his arm bleeding, and her head rearing for another strike. Blaise threw himself back with all his strength and just barely avoided the flashing teeth. She closed in, fangs bared. Blaise jabbed out with his wand and the snake actually screeched, a high-pitched sound that caromed through his ears. She flailed with her whole body, tail lashing madly over the floor, catching him across the legs. She jerked herself free of the wand point embedded into her eye.
Ron’s grip on her hand had not lessened. “Should we seal them in, do you think?”
Harry opened his mouth, but there were no words.
The ones who could had managed to escape the inferno that had been their school. Draco had dragged Pansy off the steps and into his arms, hearing her whimpers of apology, terror, and tangled dementia in his ear. She’d passed out by the time he got her to St. Mungo’s and saw the damage that had been done to the entire Order that night.
It was almost comical, and so sad, the things they were all refusing to say. Harry could feel Draco’s presence behind him. He could almost see him: leaning against the wall, arms crossed, chin low. Feet braced shoulder-width apart. Everything about Draco was becoming another set of sensations, as though he were forming new nerve endings.
Ginny still had not gained back her colour.
He gave her a dispassionate nod and lowered himself to the cave floor, wrapping his cloak around his body. Let her kill him as he slept if she wanted to. He was the only way she had of getting to where Harry Potter was; without him to guide her, she would never find her destination. As far as Draco knew, he was the only person who had been told the actual location of the castle, save those already housed within its walls.
Harry was still battling with being questioned on such a personal front. Merlin knew that were it his relationship under scrutiny—He shook his head sharply, throwing off the rush of heat before it smothered him. In good time, it
He was reaching before he could think. Ginny watched as he knelt by the small stone.
It was with a thorough sense of relief that she greeted the shaking of his head; she didn’t want to move just yet, didn’t want to step away from the circle into a night full of shadows. Her fear tapped on her nerves like little fingers. She didn’t quite believe that they were alone yet.
Due to the destruction of St. Mungo’s, all documented Wizarding medical aid ceased in London. Supplies dwindled, and trained Healers became a valuable commodity on both sides of the conflict, resulting in multiple abductions. Those who escaped the Death Eaters fled into what protection the Order could provide.
it, but—If you love him, I know how hard you’ll fight. Because I know how hard I would have fought. To keep him here with me. With the living.”
In the indigo dawn, rolling from sleep as suddenly and blankly as she had rolled into it, Ginny had discovered she was now voiceless. But not wordless. Oh, no, the words dug and scraped away inside her head, but there was no outlet. Her voice was a tremble of wasted breath, and after an hour, Ginny gave up and succumbed to the inner monologue.
of the Auror’s approach sounded within, and the door opened onto Moody’s sparsely furnished office. The light of a roaring fire crawled up the walls. Harry drew his chair as far away from the heat as he could.
He couldn’t
Draco dragged his attention back. “You’ve obviously got the upper hand. Why don’t you tell me?”
Her intention was clear: to keep him from the Infirmary. Draco’s anger bubbled up yet again, fast and hot. He fisted his hands, trying to keep it down. He was up and he was going, and she wasn’t going to keep him out. Neither was Pomfrey.
Harry shut his eyes against the onslaught that sheared over the bond. “Go,” he muttered, “leave the room, I need to—”
Oliver rose from his seat and walked the length of the room. “It’s got to take something out of her, hasn’t it? She can’t just go around searching for everyone. They could be miles from here.”
Malfoy stared a moment longer, then broke the tableau; he lifted jittery fingers to rub across his forehead. Even from the distance, Hermione could see the white tracks his fingertips left against his skin, fading quickly to a worried red.
Ginny spun back around, her face wide open. “Can it even happen like that? Without them knowing, without—”
There was a flash of green light and Blaise watched dully as Millicent toppled over backward. Her head hit the floor with a sharp crack. Blaise’s brain tried to shut down on him, but the recognition of the new Death Eater standing before him jolted him into action that his body couldn’t handle. Bellatrix Lestrange’s face was pale as a banshee’s, her lips nearly black in the light as they formed the words to a spell. Blaise dove and rolled, nearly blacking out at the horrendous slash that carved his innards. He couldn’t tell if her spell had been successful or if the pain was from a previous injury. Her second spell connected, however, hitting him full in the chest and sending searing heat through his lungs. An instant later it didn’t matter: what could only be Cruciatus turned his mind to jelly. Only the sinister blending of the spell’s magic kept him from passing out. He jerked, screaming inside, outside, everywhere, oh gods, he hadn’t thought it possible to feel this much pain, scorching ripping tearing Seamus Seamus Seamus
Almost.
Wriggling, Harry insinuated a leg under Draco’s bent knee, flung an arm across his chest, and gathered him in until he rested against hot, sweaty skin. Draco fumbled sluggishly with the bedclothes, finally succeeding in extricating the edge of a sheet. He tugged it over them both and exhaled. Harry pressed as close as he could get. Only then did he let himself drift, listening to the hitch and sigh of Draco’s breathing.
Something snapped. Everything, falling upon Draco from the highest heavens, and it wasn’t worth it. For the first time he felt it keenly, that it wasn’t worth it. His heart cracked in his chest. “Fuck you, Potter!
Draco Malfoy already looked defeated.
A Death Eater released a flood of arrows from his wand and Draco threw up charms instinctively, felling most of the deadly hail before it gained momentum. But several of the arrows zipped past him, and Draco whirled, the words of wards dying on his lips. A Muggle man running full tilt was caught by the green blaze of a Killing Curse and pitched headfirst into the earth. More arrows hummed viciously around his body.
too much, the motion of Harry’s hand
it.” Hermione’s fingernails bit into his skin. She stared at him with large, watery eyes. “Don’t you say that, Harry James Potter, don’t you dare.”
“No.” Harry shook his head. “No.”
Harry breathed into his shoulder, and the heat flooded the thin fabric of Remus’ shirt. “Nothing.”
It was deserted, but the fire bloomed to life on the hearth as he entered. For a second, the room looked cosy.

But Pomfrey’s head was shaking back and forth in frustrating sweeps. “I have no way of knowing. They didn’t mean for this bond to happen. That complicates things, I think.”
Ron’s nod was almost nonexistent. His lips pressed against her hair. “T’morrow,” he murmured. “It
But the more it turned inside her, the more probable it became. She’d seen it all over him, but hadn’t known what to look for until now. The reason Draco was there at all. The reason her foolish,
Draco grabbed his hand, and Blaise’s head jerked around again.
“Malfoy and Nott?” she murmured aloud.
she thought sadly.
“Draco,” he said softly.
the person said without saying.
They all dutifully moved backward.
He clenched his jaw and made to walk past her. “Nothing, Hermione.” Nothing beyond the norm, at any rate.
Adrenaline skittered through Harry’s veins, tightening his shoulders right up. Draco came inside and shut the door. For a second, he remained facing away, a hand pressed to the wooden surface. Then he turned around and met Harry’s eyes.
“Blaise, wait. I—” She stuttered into silence, then raised her hands, placating. Blaise took as deep a breath as his broken ribs would allow and shook his head at her.
Dumbledore roused himself, his gnarled hands settling on his armrests. “Then there are things we must discuss before you proceed.”
Seamus handed her cloak to her, watching her with eyes she didn’t quite want to memorise. It felt so final: the smattering of freckles that belied his adulthood, the curious asymmetry of his smile. And Blaise Zabini’s dark eyes and sloping brows, the curl of his hair. He was perched on the arm of the couch beside them, Ginny’s new wand held between two fingers over his knee, and Ginny didn’t want to remember any of it because that felt like asking not to see it again. She pulled the cloak on, then shrugged the strap of her bag onto her shoulder and looked at the floor while she finished with the clasp.
“No. Not after all this, Harry. You
At last the whisper came. “Snape.”
“I’m sure I have no idea,” he said shortly.
“They said my name. Could have been a guess, but…” She trailed off. Harry looked away.
Draco shook his head. The tension remained around his mouth. Harry could feel expanses he was sure he wasn’t supposed to feel. Normal was a long way off these days. “Draco?”
She heard a scuffle of shoes on stone, and then silence. He’d left the cave. Ginny counted to fifteen, then opened her eyes. The shadows on the far wall were soft grey, motionless. She rolled over carefully, ready to feign sleep, to find only sunlight gleaming through the narrow aperture.
She was only the other half of a spell. Perhaps that’s all she was—No, no, the spell was not just some spontaneous bond. It required sacrifices no one could be prepared to make without, pieces of the body and mind that were irreplaceable. It was ancient and permanent, and there was just no way Harry would ever choose a person he didn’t love and cherish and wish to share his very soul with. For that was what would happen; their souls would tangle together, weaving like a tapestry, and she would
“Nothing that powerful is free.” Malfoy stopped, obviously considering the question answered. Ginny continued to glare at him, until he finally glowered back. “I’ve no idea, Weasley. If I knew the details, wouldn’t I have taken them to Voldemort long ago?”
For some reason—the trigger was unclear—the one-eyed witch appeared in her head. Hermione paused, then sprinted up the stairs, a new energy coursing through her. It wasn’t far from Gryffindor House to the statue, and that entrance was most likely still a secret. That’s where they could go. The presence of a plan cleared her mind and before she had even thought through it, she was casting a
Remus opened his mouth and stopped. His eyes grew slowly wider, slowly aware. Harry felt the man’s hands close around his upper arms again. “You knew about us, then.”
“Are you even in love with her, Potter?”
Pomfrey let out a quick breath and set the flask down. She pried Blaise’s mouth open, then placed the bezoar against his tongue and closed his lips again. For several seconds, nothing happened. Then Blaise’s body gave a great heave, his back arching. Hands clawed, and Seamus caught one without conscious thought. Blaise’s fingers were dirty with dried blood. His nails bit into Seamus’ flesh. His limbs began to twitch.
“Can you get up?”
What little of it he had left.
Malfoy snorted. “Granger then.”
His family was gone. Was hers? He remembered the constant tension when his mother had still been alive, how he’d been unable to focus, to think, without endlessly coming back to where she might be, what she might be doing. Where his father was.
Grief boiled up. He clutched Harry’s arm and Harry wrapped his hand tightly in his own. Harry’s eyes were wide and haunted.
His own magic, so long unused, fogged the room in a murky flood. Blaise blinked, feeling the comforting shift and sway of energy against his body. The Death Eaters would have to be absolute idiots not to have sensed that. But it was done: the room was sealed with the snake inside.
“The wards will be open for departures only tomorrow at six,” Harry said, hating the shiver in his voice. “I can’t give you your wand, but… You go peacefully, and they won’t stop you.”
Hermione joined him a few seconds later, bumping his chair with her foot, already engrossed in whatever her own scroll contained. Her finger tracked across the parchment, following spidery writing. “It’s got wet,” she murmured, and set about tapping the scroll cautiously with her wand. “I think… There, ought to stabilise the parchment a bit. That’s all I’m risking.”
He didn’t recall how he got to their room, only that he was suddenly there, enclosed in tight darkness. The scent of it was familiar enough to pierce through the squall in his head. Not enough to quiet the agony racking its way through him. His stomach twisted into a knot and Harry retched, felt threadbare carpet under his knees and between his fingers. Draco hauled him up again, and wherever they touched, the pain flumed out like a gale released. Harry heard an inhuman cry and understood an eternity later that it had come from him.
“Still.” She worried her lip, uncertain. “He’s going to want to thank you.”
“You’re saying we have a way of protecting ourselves.” Harry gestured at Morag. “Painting ourselves.”
A small handful this time.
Harry shook his head, already regretting the question. He breathed in deeply, and the fire snapped at damp wood. Dumbledore’s beard was a tuft of snowy cotton, almost real enough. If he leaned forward, Harry thought he might be able to feel its texture.
But the third desire, he still might achieve if he held on tightly enough: to pass through whatever life he had left as fluidly as possible, without dragging others into the depths when his time to sink finally arrived. He’d never felt it so near before, a giant rock on the rim of sight.
“Oh, yes,” Draco seethed, “your precious bond. I know all about it. Weasley isn’t exactly tight-lipped when she’s gloating.”
“Well, Theodore,” he forced out between gasps. The moss beckoned, warm and icy at the same time, light and dark and full and translucent. Eyes of two hues. “Theodore… at least…. At least in a pinch…” He laughed, a helpless burst. “We know I will rise to the occasion and do the good, the
didn’t agree.
“How?”
Draco bent into his field of vision, forcing Harry to look at him. “He went, Harry. Not because you sent him, because he had to. We all had to. Merlin, you have some responsibility here, but not all of it, not the whole fucking thing. If it meant the end of this war, I would stab myself through the heart with Voldemort’s wand itself,
“Yes,” she replied. “I no longer believe that the periods of… restfulness, as we have termed them, are a sign of healing. His blood work and the results of the tests…” She inhaled deeply. “Each time, his body seems to slow down even more than the previous time. I know I told you that it was a good sign. I thought it was. But the crash that always follows has only been growing deeper. He’s searching for something he cannot find.”
“Goyle.” It came on a breath. The hulking Death Eater’s face twisted into a snarl and he stepped forward. Blaise’s wand was pointed at his chest in a flat instant.
“Neville!” He grabbed his old roommate up into a fierce hug. Neville’s arms rose immediately, returning the embrace without hesitation. He felt thinner, muscle stretched over fragile bones. But there was strength there, too, inherent and startling, impossible to ignore.
But Harry could not share her optimism. All he could see was the stiff, still form of Blaise Zabini stretched across the hospital bed, and the lolling figure of Seamus slumped helplessly beside him.
Another boom. The sconces rattled. Ron’s eyes were narrow, older and alert. He pressed her wand into her hand. “Are you—”
“I would,” he answered. “If I thought I could.”
*		*		*
“Harry,” Blaise said thickly. He swallowed, and Seamus practically felt the difficulty of the action. Madam Pomfrey shook her head, gripping Blaise’s good shoulder with her hand.
The next day… days? They passed without Harry, without Draco. Someone brought food to their door. Harry was relatively sure no one had walked in on anything humiliating: the bond seemed content to stick them in close proximity but not to bind them physically. Harry existed in a stupor filled entirely with Draco: Draco’s smell, Draco’s thoughts, the heat of Draco’s skin. Whenever he roused, they were in contact, woven together on the bed, all limbs and tangle; sometimes just their fingers tightly interlocked. He wasn’t sure how long he spent with his mouth hovering a mere breath from Draco’s, air passing between them even as thought and emotion bled together.
Draco thought, studying the dull gleam of her hair, the streaks of dirt on her face and hands.
Harry let go instinctively. “No?”
“It’s Seamus. We can get down. Seamus!” Hermione called as loudly as she dared, and then the staircase exploded.
“Spare me your pity, Potter.” She could taste the sneer.
Ginny glared at him. “Yes. I will. I have no problem admitting I was wrong. But I haven’t always been wrong, Malfoy.”
“And the castle wards?”
Wordless improvisation now, and the pluck of strings. Harry opened the door at the end of the hall.
The thought slipped up too quickly to deflect: he was the one who had put their bond at such risk. By sending Blaise to Voldemort. He swallowed down the ensuing nausea.
**originally posted 6/27/09**
They heaved Harry to his feet.
“You’ll be confined with spells into one of the rooms of this house, until we can verify what you’ve said, and what you’ll tell us under Veritaserum. If you so much as make a move to leave, or to contact anyone, I’ll let them have you.”
She was still clothed. And this, beneath her, was no downy bedding, no lush hollow firmed by muscled arms and legs about her. This was hard earth, packed with pine needles and the odd rock. She was outside.
But her eyes told her a different story. All the colours had warped, as though she were peeking through a tinted veil, but she knew what she’d seen. It had been burned there like a twisted tattoo. If it had been anything less...
Harry looked at the nearest wall. The edges of the wallpaper were curling, warped by the damp and bordered in mold. “I’ll take you to your room.” He started for the door and, after a shaky moment, heard Malfoy’s footsteps following.
“Just what are you doing here, anyway? Little blood traitor, within our walls…” The frown on Goyle’s face was calculating. Sweat slid down under Blaise’s collar. His legs were beginning to cramp.
“Oh, god,” Seamus whimpered.
“Amazing what people will do to keep you safe.” He studied her fixedly, and Ginny heard scorn in the words. She sensed the smug expression hiding under his deadpan and wanted to smack it away.
There was no pressure in his lover’s grip. That hurt more than anything else.
The Death Eater’s face was old and craggy with scars, but Hermione had recognised him. It was Macnair, all the worse for the seven years since she’d last seen him. It was incredibly disturbing to think—actually
Nothing but a simple nod. Harry was struck all over again by how mussed Malfoy was. His hair was limp, oily, hanging about his face like an afterthought. There was a tremor to his body that had never been there. A slight but steady quiver in the muscles of his hands. Harry leaned over, a foot from Malfoy’s face. “What could I possibly help you with?”
“Are they alright?”
You’ll break the clots.”
The instant he touched him, though, he knew. Oh gods, he knew.
“I’ve no idea. Perhaps the fairies brought it.”
“This isn’t his fight.”
“In your head,” was all Harry said. He still had not looked away from Ginny. But Ginny was no longer looking at him. She stared down at the table with white lips.
“No.”
*		*		*
Draco’s breath stuttered. He curled up, fumbling for Harry’s belt, and snicked it open. He thumbed Harry’s fly wide, the shaking of his hands more and more obvious, until Harry caught his wrists and stilled him with a deep kiss. He pushed up, levering Draco into his lap. Draco’s chest heaved against his. Harry wrapped both arms around him and pulled him flush, concentrating on the way their mouths fit together, the way they didn’t fit, the pliancy of it all. He wanted every bit of Draco touching him, his heat and skin and the play of the muscles beneath. Their remaining clothing felt like an insurmountable barrier, too solid and wholly unnecessary. Harry needed it gone. His heart thumped against his ribs; he felt like he’d just raced up flights and flights of stairs, as though he’d just been bled out and his heart was struggling to keep him alive.
away from the end of this,” she seethed. “We’re just about to put everything we’ve got into one basket, and you’re ignoring Ginny in favour of some—dalliance you’ve suddenly got a mind to indulge in, and I want to know, what do you think you’re doing?”
They had all lost things. Harry had lost almost everything inanimate that he’d owned. And the people to whom they had all been forced to say goodbye left a much deeper void. But Harry had never expected to lose Hogwarts, not even in his wildest nightmares.
It wasn’t until after their meal, when they reached the staircase leading up from the cellars and saw Draco Malfoy coming down, that Ginny realised her mistake.
to win.”
“Shut it if you know what’s good f—”
Ginny nodded wordlessly, unsure how to address him anymore. What were they now, friends? She certainly didn’t hate him and was certain he didn’t hate her. Companions, then. And not just in name. She’d found reason enough to save his life, he had returned the favor, and now she found herself in an unfamiliar landscape, wondering exactly what they meant to each other.
“I…” Malfoy’s frown was dark and brittle. “Not knowingly.”
“I’m sorry, Gin.”
if the wards remain intact.”
“What is it?”
He jerked up and stared Harry right in the face, searching for his composure there. He’d always known that face, even if he hadn’t known that body until now. He could face the countenance of the Boy Wonder if nothing else. “No?”
*		*		*
Harry settled a hand on the arm of Malfoy’s chair, centimetres from his pale fingers. “Does anyone know you are here?” he repeated.
Ginny swallowed, met his gaze. Draco crawled toward her, and leaned in until the grey of his irises was all she could see. They sparked fitfully. His fingers pressed into the ground near her knee.
It was not the idle wonderings of what Nott and Draco did in bed that fascinated him, how they moved together or what it might feel like to have sex with another man. Harry had not wondered about that for nearly two years, since the night after Bordeaux fell. The man had been French, and he’d left Europe the following week, losing himself in the mess of magical refugees making their way east. The stress of battle and constant peering over his shoulder had long ago sent Harry seeking the comfort of male companionship when that of women just did not dull the ache, and the man in France had been a fine ally, and a fine bedmate, while it lasted. But it had never been meant to last, Harry’d known that from the moment it began. Despite his personal feelings. So Harry did not wonder what Nott and Draco got up to in the darkness of their bedroom or tent, or wherever.
Seamus had found her a day ago, wet and unravelled and hunted, Apparating in just an instant after she arrived herself in some desolate, broken little village, grabbing her while her eyes were still filled with grey and setting her to screaming mindlessly. He’d clamped a hand over her mouth and spirited them both into the void again before she could decide if she had heard another crack of Apparition.
was trying to distract herself from.
He could remember Harry’s hands on him. Cradling his hips. Sliding around to knead the muscles of his lower back. Pressing hot points into his shoulders with his fingertips. Every stroke burned into his flesh as though Harry’s hands still moved over his skin.
Ginny nodded; already her chin was trembling. She watched him open the door and shut it again, leaving her with the crackling of the fire. Luna’s voice had silenced, a new sort of ward in its place, and in the quiet, Ginny wrapped her arms around herself and squeezed as hard as she could, trying to contain the sobs.
A spasm crossed Oliver’s face. “They’re… managing. Still living their lives as normal. Salazar, some
He looked up and found that Harry’s eyes had darkened, narrowing in on his face. “Malfoy. Are you alright?”
Draco’s eyes traveled over his face. “I’ve read about them.”
“We’ll do what has to be done, Hermione.”
“You don’t owe me anything, Malfoy. Everything—” He stopped, gesturing weakly. There just wasn’t anything adequate anymore. Not for this. “I won’t make you stay.”
Draco’s head swivelled toward him. “Why are you doing this, Potter?” he asked in a tired voice.
Even that didn’t seem able to break through Kingsley’s weariness. He did nod thoughtfully. Moody’s magical eye spun in its socket. “There’s too much at stake, Potter.”
Ron’s smile melted into a sputtering chuckle that Hermione felt against her lips. She tried to remain oblivious—really, the kissing was so much better, and Ron’s hands—but Ron’s laughter always made her laugh, too. She broke away and turned her head against his chest, trying at least to keep the giggling quiet. God. She didn’t
“How far can you see? To call people home.”
“Harry.”
wasn’t even sure he knew what he was thinking, and yet Remus seemed to know. “What happens now?” he whispered.
The voice was not loud enough to overpower the murmuring, and no one answered the query, but Fleur Delacour’s accent was instantly recognisable even before Harry saw her. He had only seen hair that colour on two people, and one of them had been in the castle for a day; Gabrielle’s milk-white tresses, unlike her sister’s, were finally free of the grime and filth of days spent running, hiding, fleeing. Fighting.
“He’s not missing,” Harry muttered. And said nothing else. The only people who knew what Blaise was up to were himself, Moody, and Dumbledore. And Luna, perhaps, if her powers really were that monumental. “And that’s beside the point. Oliver’s right, Seamus could be responding to any amount of dark magic.”
Ginny nodded, clasped Blaise’s hand briefly. “I know. I know.”
Draco swallowed and turned his head. “Weasley, Potter. For fuck’s sake.”
want—
“It is understandable,” Dumbledore said. “The two of you share a passionate history.”
Seamus heard clunking, then the sound of something being dragged. Another cot appeared in his view. Again Harry knelt in front of him. Seamus felt his friend slip both arms under his and pull him up, settling him on the other mattress. A hand ghosted over his grip on Blaise and for an instant, hackles rose within him.
Only silence answered. Then, Draco’s voice.
dealt with.”
As though Luna had really heard her—which Hermione was still finding difficult to wrap her mind around—a new warmth tickled through her temples, sweeping gradually down her neck and into her shoulders. The pain in her head eased at last. Luna’s song sounded more glorious than ever.
“A few hours.” Draco snorted softly. “You can let go of the stone. The magic reaches further than that.”
to see his father again. To save a mother who would later die, in spite of everything.
Ron turned bleary eyes to her. “Huh?”
it happen. Something raw and helpless clotted up inside him. His mind threatened to topple. “I can’t… This isn’t
Gods, nothing had been accomplished yesterday. He’d not spoken to Ginny. He’d not managed to convince Moody to keep everyone inside the castle, and he couldn’t take credit for a fortuitous chance of fate that had locked all the doors regardless. As for Draco… He hadn’t been able to find him after leaving the Infirmary, and he’d looked. In Draco’s room, in the kitchens, the library, even the bloody supply room. The only difference this time was that bothering Luna about it was not an option. He couldn’t steel himself to ask her again, not when it was plain she knew everything he and Draco were doing. And not when he had no idea what the search for Seamus and Blaise had done to her. Even now, her music sounded hollow, the wards more evanescent.
“They’ve started out,” she croaked. Her voice rasped like broken glass. But Harry had not flinched in some days. Luna took a deep, rattling breath. “Be here. Soon.”
*	*	*
But… kill himself? He was beginning to think he might not be strong enough to see it through. And what would the Wizarding world do then, when its own saviour couldn’t summon to courage to do what was necessary?
“I’ve taken so much from you, Malfoy.” He shuddered. “So many.”
unspoken like a superstition. The bones of the land had been left to its soldiers, the last resistance being slowly smothered by darkness.
“Harry,” Oliver warned. But Harry only pursed his lips.
But love? Harry
His home. He hadn’t been able to claim a real home for almost two years. They were all homeless now.
Harry tore through the door, shirt in hand. Luna sat there plucking at a lute and humming softly. Her eyes had been closed, but they opened to reveal curious ocean blue.
“At the moment of the last Horcrux’s destruction,” he went on, “Voldemort will be at his weakest. But he’s still powerful, perhaps the most powerful wizard currently in existence, and we have no way of knowing what else he has in reserve. We have to assume that he knows we understand my role in his survival; we must plan for the fact that he’ll have contingencies at the ready.”
Even if Potter had not stepped in and given him debt after debt to pay back, his own conscience wouldn’t let him gain distance from the mire in which he’d lodged himself. Draco pressed two fingers to his forehead to stem the building headache. If only he’d been a solitary prisoner in that mire, it would have been much easier to drag himself out.
“I don’t—
Harry found Draco’s trouser fly, and Draco arched into his touch, hips bucking spasmodically. Harry squeezed his thigh to steady him and pushed the buttons free. Draco stuttered on a word, and then Harry felt hands scrabbling with his own trousers. He lifted himself away just enough to give Draco room, already hating the space between them. Draco got his trousers down at last and Harry kicked them off, not even bothering to make sure he’d completely freed himself before returning the favour. Draco’s hips rose off the bed more from Harry’s efforts than any aid from Draco himself, and then his trousers were gone as well and Harry saw pale skin stretching across red linens. Draco’s knees bent and Harry’s body slid between them on its own. He couldn’t tell who the moan came from when they finally touched.
Why the fuck wasn’t Potter with his future bride, celebrating her safe arrival? Draco’s chest cinched up; he had to force himself to inhale. Because they wanted to make sure he knew how happy they were? “What?” he said flatly.
Harry nodded and read. And read.
Krum nodded. “They’ll be glad to have more ammunition.”
“Remus, I’m sorry,” he choked out. “Oh, Merlin, I’m so, so sorry.”
“Don’t be.” Harry’s shoulders hitched, and he shivered even though it wasn’t cold. He glanced over in time to see Seamus rub a fist firmly against his eyes.
Maybe those particular thoughts were the source of his discomfort as well.
The look Malfoy gave her could have chipped ice. His eyes flicked over her face briefly. “Since I decided it would make
“Yeah?”
Draco made a sharp sound. “Couldn’t very well do that, could I?” he muttered, a strange lilt to the words. If it had been any other situation, she would have sworn it was amusement. But bitter-tasting.
Harry blinked, and understood the final bit of calculation. “He has no idea. You made sure.”
“He has a few days at most,” she whispered. “I think they will be good days. You are taking his pain from him, Seamus. He’s not hurting anymore because of you.”
“No, Harry, that’s not what I—I know you don’t.”
The smile he wore when he turned to face Harry again was relieved. He squeezed Harry’s shoulders. “You really don’t know how worried I was, Harry. There were moments when I was so certain…”
Ginny raised her head unsteadily and Draco followed the sound until a figure formed in the gloom and came toward them.
*	*	*
“Get out.”
All thoughts left Draco’s head. He spun toward the door, and Harry’s hands fell away at last. A bond? Impossible. They weren’t—How—?
Nothing you can use, at any rate. Nothing worth offering!”
Fuck almighty, he wasn’t even with Draco anymore. Twenty minutes ago, he’d thought it the best morning he’d had in years. Funny how everything flipped on its head.
“We’ll treat it like another strategic review,” he said, gruff. Beside him, Draco’s mouth tightened. Hermione looked up, more nervous than he’d expected. It irritated him, that she could be caught off guard when he could not allow himself to be.
It repeated over and over in her head, a strange, thumping heartbeat.
Behind her, Ron was pressing the students from Gryffindor forward. The stairway was too narrow, too exposed should anyone turn the corner below. “He’s going out through a passage on the third floor, but we can’t get to it from here.” She grabbed his forearm. “Where’s Harry?”
But magic was a delicate thing. A patient thing.
“Does Minerva still have Filius’ scrolls?” Moody asked, squinting his good eye. Remus gave a wry smile.
His body thrummed heavily with it, with Harry and nearness and that aching, irrepressible need.
But the alternative was too horrible to accept.
“Damn it.
Dumbledore lifted an eyebrow. “His choice of lovers, for example. Out of all the men in the Order, do you not find it convenient that he chose Theodore Nott?”
The Weaslette
Below, smoke billowed from the ground floor, concealing the lower stairs. The flash and bang of spells ratcheted off the walls, bathing everything in blues, yellows, greens.
There was anger laced through it, frustration. And heat. Other things Harry couldn’t begin to define, but they preyed upon him, closing in. An image of himself dead on the ground abruptly entered his mind, and he choked and pulled away.
But another voice, other words, came first from around the corner. “Expelliarmus! Incarcerous!” And then, an exasperated afterthought: “You fucking
But the haunt was gaining ground in her eyes, a fear that looked so out of place there.
“What do you want me to do, then?” Harry snapped. “You want me to just sit here? Not do everything in my power to stop that fucking bastard from ruining the whatever’s left? He’s already blighted the entire world! I can stop him, do you understand me?
been Dumbledore. Now, what was left?
Harry’s head began to hurt. “He… was sent after one of the Horcruxes. He killed Nagini.”
“It’s a war. We have… so little time.” Blaise’s eyes never wavered, even as his fingers trembled in Draco’s hand. “Tell him. Before you miss each other.”
Draco slumped into a single sob, half laughter, all agony. Blaise squeezed his fingers. “Draco… Not all your doing. He kn—He knew.”
Fleur’s head craned wildly, eyes shooting wide. She stumbled sideways, throwing a hand out to catch herself. Harry saw her fingers clench into a fierce white fist, as though she would tear into the very stone.
No one said a word. Draco’s hand had tightened around his. It hurt.
The hiss that erupted from her mouth was one of anger. Her eyes narrowed into slits. Blaise lifted his wand a final time, sweeping the entire room with its point. He spoke clearly, never taking his eyes off of the massive serpent. “Fractus Anappareo.”
Moody stiffened next to Seamus. Pomfrey’s brow creased. “Mr Zabini. Blaise?”
His forward drive had evaporated, shredded by Dumbledore’s revelations. The need for the bond had never been greater and now there was nothing standing in his way. Only now he couldn’t make himself get off his bed and put it into action.
“The price will be too high!” Harry shouted, and Draco fell silent.
To the south, Hogsmeade was a jumble of buildings and forgotten magic. People still lived there. But the twinkling candle glow through frosted windows was gone, and the inhabitants let the quiet cloak their presence.
When she opened her eyes, she very nearly expected Harry to be there beside her, arms around her, pressing her against his damp chest. The ghostly scent of sweat lingered in her nostrils and her fingers tingled with touching skin her entire body remembered, though she had not felt it in years. Her muscles were still reacting to the comforting weight of Harry upon them, and her… Ginny inhaled sharply, still swimming up from the fog of dreams. There was a riveting pulse between her thighs, aching up her spine and into her belly in delicious, unsatisfied waves.
Luna saw him and smiled. One hand fingered the strings of the ornate harp before her. Her hair tumbled over her shoulders, cream against the green embroidery of her robe. She looked like a fire fairy, glowing orange, eyes bright as topaz. Harry stepped across the room amidst a roll of notes. Luna broke the statuesque serenity of her posture and nudged a cushion toward him from under her chair. Her hands never left the instrument. Harry lowered himself down beside her.
Harry’s selection of this room had one other purpose. He doubted Malfoy had noticed the large, ancient portraits adorning the walls. Particular ones; some covered over with white sheets, some empty of their occupants. And one on the west wall in the darkness, oft frequented by a familiar, half-moon-spectacled face.
Harry had told her of the scars he’d inadvertently imposed upon the body in front of her during his sixth year. This one across Malfoy’s back did not fit.
Merlin. Was Remus seeing it all on his face?
Molly Weasley was ‘mother.’ Indisputable. But Narcissa Malfoy had never worn that title in Ginny’s mind until now. Her finger crept out of its own accord and brushed the shining strands again. It was obviously a treasured possession, one for which Malfoy had sacrificed crucial space in his pack. Delicately coiled, tucked away in a box, and wrapped in a stained piece of cloak. Which was another mystery all on its own.
exactly what you were doing!”
The Great Hall was almost too warm. Hermione struggled out of her cloak and tossed it on the bench beside her. Above her head, the ceiling was a mass of swirling snow, the sky a deep grey. She sighed, unable to keep from smiling.
*		*		*
A dry chuckle. “Nott showed me.”
“He’s fine, Zabini’s fine, they can both take care of themselves!” Merlin, she’d been so stupid. So tired and shocked and confused that she couldn’t act on all the obvious reasons why they should stick together, couldn’t remember that everyone had nightmares. At least she remembered where she was going. But now there was no castle, and no Seamus, and no safety, and—
Ginny squeezed her brother’s hand, perhaps too tightly, but she couldn’t distinguish anymore. The hospital ward was quiet except for his breathing. It had become easier; the change had been audible even as she sat beside him.
He hadn’t known what to think. He’d just looked over and seen the empty side of the bed. He’d reached out, and his mind had barely registered the cooled sheets before he was sitting up and pulling on his trousers. Searching for his glasses and finding them inexplicably next to his bed. But there was no time to wonder. He didn’t bother with Draco’s room; the only one who would know instantly was Luna, and he’d been terrified of what she might tell him.
Fucking Harry. Fuck being fucked by Harry, and liking it, and wanting it so badly. So pitifully.
“I—” She bit her tongue, and Draco looked up again. Ginny gestured aimlessly at herself. “Is it alright if I go and… and…”
Pomfrey sighed. She looked incredibly old. “I’m sure that’s not the case, not truly. He may be dreaming, or this may all be backlash, trying to create some sort of equilibrium and not being able to do so because of Mr Zabini’s absence.”
The funeral was short, edged with uneasiness. Draco stayed until the chill fog crept in, darker and darker, until Potter’s stag Patronus erupted, until people were shouting, and he was forced to Apparate away with the rest. He spent the night staring with dry eyes at the moldy ceiling of Black’s old manor.
Ginny sat up at once, gaze fixed on the empty cave entrance. He’d left, presumably to have a look around, perhaps for other more private reasons. But the end result was that he was gone. Without his bag.
No. It wasn’t the Death Eaters’ way to watch, to trail and then pounce. A simple, sudden Killing Curse would have been the way of it. So they hadn’t located them yet. But they would soon, in moments. He heard the rustle of robes over the earth and the squelch of boots against the soggy loam.
It was ludicrous. The proof stared her right in the face. Ginny yanked the hood of her cloak over her head. If she were Draco... oh, no, it was much too obvious: She would never, ever be able to guide someone else into the arms of someone she was so desperately in love with. To walk by that person’s side day after day, knowing that the instant she succeeded in her task, the other half of her soul would be ripped away forever.
“I’m still hopeful,” she said. “There’s still time for the spells to work. It’s entirely possible he will come through this.”
For some time, all they had was a conversation of breathing. Absolute silence came from the area of Katie Bell’s bed. Did the victims of Dementors really sleep? Avoidance, that was what Draco’s thought process was, that and finally having a quiet sphere in which to think. He was still trying to run from reality, it seemed. It made him angry all over again, and exhausted. They were all fading, wasting away in the castle, waiting for a battle that would find them too late. When Voldemort finally showed up, everyone would be like Blaise and it would be so, so quiet.
“Well,” Hermione said after a beat, “we’ve got something now that ought to upset the playing field a bit.” She whirled on her think tank, and Su motioned Morag forward. Morag, whose arm seemed to have gone blue.
No. He couldn’t afford to second-guess himself. Blaise inhaled deeply. It was here; he’d studied these corridors for far too long to be wrong. The Death Eaters couldn’t magically reorient a structure as old as this one.
He struggled upright despite the pain, bracing himself against the mattress. “Finnigan.”
“You’re a sight,” she said. Fred looked at her for a long moment, and then the tiniest of smiles cracked his pallor.
“Goodness, I should be letting you sleep. Let’s get you to Pomfrey’s, yeah?”
But Malfoy simply exhaled. “I’ve been here before.”
Hermione opened her mouth, but her headache intensified and she sank back, raising a hand to her temple. The tip of Pomfrey’s wand alighted on her forehead and held there. She felt the drone of new magic through her skin.
“You can each have your own, though if all the others are coming, eventually we’ll have to—”
—He couldn’t keep from moving, twisting both closer and away, and it wasn’t exactly pain. It never would be, and yet it straddled that razor thin line, snatched the breath from his lungs, pulled Harry’s name from him in helpless gasps. Draco writhed, felt Harry thrust up, twist down, and rode the pain right through into something else entirely.
Seamus remembered the cigarette and took a long drag. His eyes went cold and distant again. “You mean, am I going to die, too? Just say it, Harry.”
Draco shuddered at that thought.
this boy? By indulging in such a childish habit, he could only guess.
”Master Potter,” Pansy gasped. “I wasn’t aware you had returned.”
The boy let out a small moan, a furrow appearing between his pale brows.
Omega, his
Draco let out a high-pitched whimper, cupping his own breasts and squeezing them, milk leaking in thick rivulets from his lovely nipples.
The boy gave a sharp cry, his cum spurting from the head of his prick and landing on his stomach and chest.

Draco’s mouth fell open in disbelief. “I’m not—I’m not
“There it is,” Arlen said brightly.
“I-I’m not!” Draco said with a bit too much force. “I just hadn’t expected to see…
He wasn’t going to give him the satisfaction of seeing his face.
and the child you carry will always bind you to me. We are forever entwined, no matter how much you want to deny it.”
Not until he faced what had caused the wound in the first place.
He stared at the broken pieces of glass laying on the floor, thinking about how they resembled his heart.
Draco stepped closer. “And you’re saying we didn’t have sex?”
“What do you mean he can’t
Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s ear, his prickly stubble grazing the sensitive skin. “I wouldn’t mind if you called me it, too, sweetheart.”
Draco felt blood rush to his ears, anger overtaking him. He turned and threw the soiled washcloth he’d been using to wash Juni’s hands. It hit Harry in the center of his broad chest and fell, plopping wetly to the floor.
Draco gritted his teeth, flushing as he averted Harry’s intense gaze. Slowly, he nodded.
Theo chuckled, keeping his hands around Draco’s waist to hold him in place. “Because of her sweet demeanor.”
at the thought of some faceless Alpha licking and sucking at the boy’s small chest.
Even now, slick was oozing from his hole, his prick unbearably hard between his legs.
He lifted his hand and swiped at his cheeks with two fingers, holding them up in front of him. They glistened with wetness—not his own.

Truthfully, it felt like the brush of a butterfly’s wings to Harry, but his heart
“Yes!” Scorpius exclaimed, grinning up at his father.
Harry Potter? What an honor. I think I have just what you’re looking for. Follow me.”
Harry felt askew in her memories, the sound of his quickening heartbeat deafening as he tried to pull himself out of Narcissa’s mind.
,” the rabbit whispered.
And his cute little pup, Scorpius, his eyes had seemed so familiar…
Ron was silent for several moments. “A flare of underage magic was made known to the French Ministry of Magic. They traced it to the source and found Narcissa. Someone there recognized her and alerted us. They allowed us to bring her back to London to be persecuted for her crimes.”
To quell the Alpha instincts that roared inside of his mind at the thought of intentionally harming his Omega mate, he closed his eyes and carded through the memories of his family and friends that had suffered and died due to Draco’s family’s involvement with Voldemort.
”Ah. Clever Narcissa. She’s always been a cunning snake.”
It was the first hug he’d received since parting from his mother. She smelled like sunshine and citrus. It felt wonderful.
And he knew he couldn’t say no to his mate.
“I love them both, with my entire heart. They are my family, and I don’t want to be parted from them ever again, Narcissa.”
, not this hard, unyielding toy.

Harry raised his free hand and reached around the boy’s thigh, grabbing his prick. He wanked them both at the same time while he kept spearing the rabbit’s hole with his tongue.
He held a bouquet of red carnations in one hand.
and choices.
“Well,” Harry said gruffly, “you’re the mother and you know what’s best for you and your pup. If you’re not ready to stop and Scorpius isn’t ready…”
Eat him. Fuck him. Eat him.
Draco’s lids felt heavy, slick starting to flow thicker between his legs because of Harry’s possessive words. He grabbed onto both of Harry’s forearms for balance, his wet belly pressing firmly against Harry, dampening his shirt. “I-I didn’t, Harry. He was just checking the baby,
He had never witnessed someone standing up to his father like that or ever had anyone defend him so fiercely.
Draco kept his eyes downcast, studying the delicate petals of one of the carnations in the bouquet.
”Who were you touching? Which Alpha was it?”
. You ran away because Lucius
“Oh, Dada,
The boy wobbled slightly on his feet, holding onto Harry for balance.
But he wasn’t a young, scared teenager anymore. He was now a man, but still haunted by memories that refused to be forgotten.
Ron turned and gave Harry a rueful smile. “Follow me.”
Harry chuckled and waved at the pup. “Hello again, Scorpius.”
Draco shrugged dropping his gaze back to his teacup. The milk was almost completely blended now.
For the first time in his life, he cursed being an Omega.
He pulled up his feet, spreading his thighs wide so that his Alpha could see how wet and ready he was. Even though his instincts were controlling most of his actions now, his face suffused with heat under Harry’s intense gaze.
He moved lower, licking at the boy’s drawn-up balls and taking time to coat each one in his saliva.
”You’ll let me know when he’s ready to converse? I know if he gets pregnant, he’ll be whisked away to St Mungo’s for numerous appointments.” She gave a mock shudder. “I don’t miss that. Especially under the Ministry’s scrutiny with the new breeding law.”
He would remember that he was a kept
“You…already knew?” he asked haltingly.
”Then leave us alone,” he hissed, not wanting to raise his voice around his daughter. “I don’t need anyone to babysit me, especially some scarred freak who thinks I’m not worth his precious

stay hidden.”
“Potter?” Roland arched one regal brow. “Odd to see you outside of the bowels of the Ministry like this.”
Draco’s heart leapt, an overwhelming feeling of gratitude overtaking him for the kind witch seated across from him.
DON’T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT
Draco giggled. “Shouldn’t Scorpius be the one to call you that?”
Harry sat up, arching a brow. “Come here.”
“Then that settles that, I suppose,” he murmured, brushing past Draco and walking towards a door off to the side of the study he hadn’t noticed before. “If you’re going to be under my employment, you should address me correctly. Respect is earned, not given.”
The entire right portion of his face was warped from the Fiendfyre, the once unblemished, olive skin now scarred over and silvered with age.
When Harry turned to look back at him, his eyes were scathing. “Still able to manipulate. Still a

Harry scooted closer to him, but Draco shook his head. “I just need a moment, Harry.”
let the boy be taken care of by someone else.
“How many.”
Without thinking anymore about it, he sliced open the envelope with his finger and held it out over his open palm, shaking the unknown object loose.
He’d only let himself slip into the boy’s room one time this week. Draco had been asleep, his lovely face relaxed while in repose. Harry could see how swollen his eyes had become from crying all the time. Unable to help himself, he’d leaned down and lapped at the boy’s eyes, the need to heal his hurt unable to be repressed when he was laying right in front of him.
The small boy was currently hiding under his writing desk, trembling. He was completely nude except for his collar and Harry had been trying to coax him out for the past two hours.
He knew the portrait only held the
If Roland couldn’t even handle him talking about his daughter’s cute mishaps and his constant need for bathroom breaks during his pregnancy, how were they ever going to actually spend time together?
“But when I caught Harry bringing you and Scorpius home by Floo one evening, that only confirmed it for me.”
To think that Draco was suffering through the painful side effects of quitting breastfeeding because of his need to please his insufferable father…
He pulled back, wiping up Draco’s cum from his face with one finger. “So sensitive. It makes me wonder how you’ll react when my cock is finally inside of you.”
Before Draco knew it, he was three months pregnant.
Draco knew what he was asking. He could remember his sleepily stated promise from the night before.

. If Draco refused to see him or be with him while pregnant with his
Draco sat up, his desire quickly evaporating under Harry’s callous treatment. “Good. Maybe he’ll catch on to what an abusive prick you are,” he murmured.
Harry’s hand froze, his heart stuttering.
.  He wished that Harry was kind and caring—
His poor Omega was probably dripping slick, waiting for his Alpha to come and fill him up, his breasts needing suckled—
Even though he was thirty-six years old, Harry couldn’t help the slow smile that curled his lips brought upon by pure joy.
Her hand slid from his shoulder, dropping listlessly to her lap. She stared straight ahead, pain etched across her pale features.
“Self-sacrifice is often seen as heroic.”
”What did you just say?”
Sleeping with his dada at night made him feel safe. He hadn’t felt safe in a long time. His dada kept the bad dreams away.
It was pure euphoria and Harry never wanted it to end.
you. Resign yourself to the fact that I will be the one to breed you.”
Harry glanced to the side, meeting his eyes.
“Come back up here, baby—”
Love, satisfaction, protectiveness, and
His eyes traveled over to Ginny, whose speculative gaze was on Harry, a small furrow between her red brows. When their eyes met, Draco quickly looked away.
Harry sighed, dropping to his haunches in front of the desk.
He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze, feeling nothing but gratitude for his friend.
Potter raised his free gloved hand and placed a straightened finger to his lips in a universal sign for silence.
him to admit that to himself.
He hadn’t wanted to lie to Harry all this time, but after that fated night at Hogwarts, everything had happened so
Jack’s words echoed in his mind and as they did, a feeling of determination settled over Harry.
“Draco, you don’t have to,” he whispered, placing his large hand on his thigh under the table and softly squeezing.
