“Here! You can sit here, here with me!” piped a tiny boy at the fire up, gesturing wildly to get Harry's attention and patting the ground between his jeans-clad legs and two dozing horses, one brown, one chestnut.
“I thought you were working.” Harry arched an eyebrow, amusement in his tone, and sipped the hot beverage, sighing contently.
He groaned and the other boy chuckled. “You didn't notice the wardrobe was a bit more cramped than usual?”
The leader of the merpeople looked thoughtful. “It's true. Humans would be harmed, but not us. In fact, my youngest daughter thinks it fun to saddle her underwater-horse and ride with them whenever they come along.”
“There were fisherwomen mending nets on the beach. They were singing while they worked and we made a bet on who could get closest to them without being noticed.”
It was starting to go dark when Draco at last had everything together and was ready to head homewards. It was time; his stomach was growling already, in need of some sustenance.
Malfoy and he were definitely falling with breakneck speed down into a seemingly bottomless pit. He knew that for a fact because looking up told him so by the rapidly shrinking dot of candlelight that marked their entrance. Yet they were at the same time apparently floating in mid-air, as their hair and cloaks were billowing in a slow-motion sort of way.
Draco opened his mouth in righteous indignation, but Harry elbowed him and shook his head. Better not let a razor-sharp Malfoy-tongue loose on Death himself. There could be severe consequences.
A smile brighter than the July sunshine turned Draco's way. “Great! And look – it's all done. So, how about some cooling down in the lake?”
Also that time in the afternoon when Ember, Dreamer in arms, had unpromptedly looked at Seeker and nonchalantly told him that Ember, by the way, would kill him for losing the Jolly Rogers every game lately. It had been such an intense moment that Seeker hadn't been sure what to think, Ember's eyes dangerously calm. After a few seconds the travel companion had barked a laugh and shaken his head: “Just joking, man.” But Seeker hadn't been completely convinced. Ember would always have a darkness to him somehow.
Sure enough, out of Holle's Pond rolled a magnificent golden chariot onto the clearing. Seeker gaped. First he thought the vehicle moved on its own but as soon as he had blinked once, he knew better: Harnessed in front of the wagon were two horses, two oxen, two cows, two lynxes and two white cats – in that order – preceded by twenty-four Hunt dogs and a single eagle owl. However they were only there for the time of the fluttering of his eyelids. There and gone in a tick.
“What?” Hearing Potter's husky voice so close to Draco's ear did things to his nether regions. He shuddered.
“You did? How?” Harry's eyes went round and he could feel that Draco was also listening intently. It was as if excited tension radiated from his invisible body.
was the one to be the centre of attention.” He cocked his head slightly. “But you really mean it, don't you? You hate those things.”
“Any moment now what?” asked Harry, confused, and Malfoy rolled his eyes and stomped off, apparently to circle the room once more, looking for a way out. Harry's gaze followed him.
Swiftly scratching a few lines onto Warrington's parchment, she topped the words off with a  familiar jinx and then proof-read her work with a satisfied nod. “That will do. Now, if you would please sign this?”
He sighed deeply and shifted so that he could put both arms around the crying boy in his lap. One hand started stroking Potter's untameable mane (finding it surprisingly soft) and Draco forced his anger down, beginning to whisper soothing words into Potter's ear, Draco's chin on top of  Potter's head.
Despite worrying about what was to come, Harry had to smile. Really, only Draco could make a rebuke sound so caring. Geez, he'd really fallen hard for this insulter.
“Oh nothing much, just that he's in big trouble and it's only fair to let the headmistress know about
Berchthold was still on horseback, seemingly listening into the distance. Holle as Dormarth lay at his feet, one of her eyes glowing eerily at Harry through the break of dusk.
Blinking rapidly, Harry tried to grasp that concept but gave up eventually, chalking it up to Hunt logic. One thing finally added up though. “That's why you were here, on the night of The Battle of Hogwarts and that's how you brought the others – my friends – to The Hunt.”
Draco however had picked up something odd then: “Kreacher, what did you mean 'your master gone, yet there'?”
It was as though scales were falling from Draco's eyes. How could he have been so blind. Of course Potter came in here nonchalantly like it was his own bedroom, because
Howling, Kreacher had then thankfully buried his face in his hands and had enthusiastically nodded to show that he felt the same way.
? “Yes, please, enlighten me, Malfoy.” Harry jerked his head at the other side of the table. “Is that really how you think I should be?” It was supposed to be a mocking question, laced with disdain, but Harry found that it came out rather unsure and he wondered if he truly wanted to hear the answer at all.
“Of course he did. Potter was basically the drive behind the whole resistance. But his huge ego wouldn't have survived if he hadn't pulled a solo – sorry, trio – stunt and had vanished for half a year, doing who-knows-what.” Draco rolled his eyes.
There were no words spoken, as the woman and the leader of The Wild Hunt looked at each other, eye to eye.
Except, there was a night raven perching on his shoulder. A black bird with white feathers dotting its wing tips. It could have been any old bird, but Harry knew the moment he saw it that this was yet another form of Holle's. For her sheer presence was emitted in such a humongous way that he was once again reminded just how powerful and ancient she really must be. Yet there was also her softness that, even in this dark place, made him feel something akin to hope. She was like winter and spring – bird or no bird. Her beady eyes seemed almost glowing when she looked down at him.
The expression on Malfoy's ghostly pale face, only illuminated by the candles for the dead, turned hard, his gaze flickering towards the crosses.
Draco scanned the room. Right in front of him, two older gingers and that former Beauxbatons champion girl on a worn couch looked at him curiously. Meanwhile, his welcoming committee had split up: with Mrs. Weasley joining her husband on a love seat directly under the tree to the left while the other two sat down by the fire to the right, mixing in with a circle of people apparently in the middle of a game of Exploding Snap. Draco had never bothered to learn their names, but there was the surviving twin and that stuck-up ex-Head Boy. As well as one bushy-haired Hermione Granger. Oh goody.
According to the information that Sir Nicholas had gathered from the Headless Hunt, The Wild Hunt ritually passed by this place on New Year's Eve; here, on the crossroads between water and land, continent and island, in the hour that was not just between days, but between years.
Alright, I said, I wouldn't make you wait on last chapter's cliffhanger, but, sorry, the intermezzo just needs to be.
“Genius,” Draco acknowledged in awe and Harry felt his heart swell at the unexpected compliment. “Though you could have told me that before.”
Harry bit his lip to suppress a pained groan as Malfoy's hand tightened around his body. The prospect of beating Harry – even this crazy version – was definitely an incentive; and if Malfoy got out of here in the end, what did it matter to him if Harry didn't? The mini-sized Gryffindor peeked up at his companion, only to find Malfoy's face shuttered, his mouth a firm line.
Lacie narrowed her saucer-round eyes. “Well, the others, obviously. The Upsters.” She pointed a spindly finger at the obscured ceiling. “Up there.”
what to do to get him freed, but I can't bloody find him. And all it would take is calling his name once. That's it! Easy enough one should think, but
“I think you've done enough of that already,” the redhead said quietly and while doing so he looked at Draco in an earnest way that made Draco believe he meant it.
It wasn't that much better to look at the adjacent walls though, since all of them (as far as Harry could see in the dim pool of light) were cluttered with paintings of fluffy bunnies and rabbits (and for an unintelligible reason, one badger) that were mostly awake and staring at the unusual sight of two boys snared by some stairs. The only thing amusing about the pictures was the fact that every last one of them seemed to have been painted by the same person: W. Rabbit.
The Weasel choked out a sob and sat up so quickly, sand was flying everywhere. “Enough! Hermione seriously, I wanted a day off, remember?”
Weasley soundly opened a notebook that Granger had shoved at him. He positioned a weird-looking Muggle writing tool over the paper as it was his turn to take notes.
Draco had almost forgotten about his hurt shins and being reminded now brought the throbbing pain back to the forefront of his mind.
Draco nodded. “As long as they're justified; which this case surely is. I wrote about it to the Swedish Ministry's Department for International Cooperation. They said it's fine, as long as the knowledge about magic stays within this family and Mr. Withane swore up and down he would never tell anyone
Seeker noticed that seemingly all of The Hunt were up at this ungodly hour to witness the spectacle – whatever it was.
Anguis soothingly curled around his ankles and Seeker absent-mindedly petted him, something the snake only allowed because he felt the boy's despair.
answered Seeker distractedly while watching Draco pulling out a small stick from his pocket. It looked a bit like the one Seeker had found in the back pocket of his own trousers. He had often thought about throwing it out, but it had such a nice length, just right for roasting marshmallows on. So he'd kept it.
“So tell me, how would he hear me if I don't?” With a sigh, Harry slumped into one of the arm-chairs draped around the table, each of the backrests topped with a wondrous headgear (his had a sallet). This was too strength-sucking. He rubbed his forehead and closed his eyes, exhausted. “Maybe he's not coming because he knows
Draco blinked and then slowly gazed down his body. A moment later, he really, really wished, he hadn't and blushed scarlet. He was still wearing his pyjamas. The childish Hogwarts ones no less.
Of course the ever-sympathetic former Gryffindor still wanted to help people which was why he kept attending benefit events and the such, even though he hated them. Draco, socially adept as he'd been brought up, always had to brave the crowds for both of them.
Finally she talked, her voice raspy from crying: “I heard your call. Thank you for the offer, but I won't go with you. My life was here and now, it is no more. I had all I ever wanted. I desire nothing you could give me.”
Leaning over the stack of witness reports on a missing person case that the Auror Office had asked assistance on, he chewed on the end of his quill. This one was a bit tricky as statements differed widely. Which was probably why Draco had been tasked with it in the first place: Somehow he had built a reputation of being good at this stuff, at locating people that were hard to find. That the sister of the husband of the woman Thomas had requested Draco to find, all those months back, was an Auror had most likely nothing to do with that... nor the fact that Draco indeed was really talented at retrieving information about lost people's whereabouts...
“Do you think he'll come back with me once I find him?” Draco's voice was tight. “What if he wants to stay with The Hunt? For all I found out they are a rather free bunch. Maybe he likes that... He... he's a good guy. That makes it hard on him sometimes. He forgives everyone eventually, even me. But not himself, I think. Even though he didn't do anything wrong, really. But sometimes I wonder if it could be that The Hunt took him because he wanted to be taken, as punishment or something.”
The sun was beating down mercilessly and Draco felt like he had sweated out every last drop of liquid from his body. Yet still those stupid roof beams wouldn't stay in place. Instead they kept collapsing back into a heap of wood and dust every other minute or so.
Knocking piles of books over, Harry was at the other side of the room with lightning speed, yet, when he yanked the door open, a frantic Draco had already passed him in the hallway and was halfway down the stairs.
Harry averted his gaze. Not for the first time since they'd entered the staircase, he wondered if maybe he'd hit his head during the stumble? Because what other explanation was there for his weird thoughts? Thinking about Malfoy like that, looking at him. Even though... looking at Malfoy really wasn't something new, per se...
Harry grinned. “Well, for one, strictly speaking you haven't turned me down even once yet and two...” He lifted their still entwined hands between their faces, so that Draco could see the silvery scar on the back of Harry's hand.
Better to give the prying Gryffindor something else then. “Alright. Truce. For now. But I swear to Merlin, if you pull my hair again, you're going overboard. Are we clear?”
It wasn't that he couldn't have used some time abroad. But for Draco, going away at that point in his life would have meant never coming back. In his cell, he had had time enough to think about things in general and he had realised that so far he had always picked the easy way out. Yet this one time he didn't want to be a coward, he wanted to stick it out, get his life together.
Truly, there they were – a Hippogriff, a Sphinx, some weird flower and a flaming heart – surrounding some askew scribbled notes of which all Is had teacup-shaped superscript dots.
He shook his head once more. “I don't know what you're talking about. But one thing's for sure: I'm not dead.”
He stood awkwardly by the door for a moment, unsure as to where to go. After all, he'd mostly been patching alone for a reason, so... He paused.
It must have shown on his face, since Ember suddenly stopped chortling and declared with a sombre voice: “We all can hear the bells, too. We were all born with magic. We thought you might as well, since The Hunt picked you up at the same castle, we came from some months back. The Hunt often passes through those woods there,” he nodded in agreement with his own words. “We all came from there. We are one.”
“Use it well,” Harry instructed and squeezed Teddy's hand. “And should you ever... if you ever feel you need to inherit the title master of Death, too, then search the pockets.”
She whipped around, foaming the water with the force of her silver fishtail and they could now see for the first time, where the light around her came from: As part of her necklace, embedded in between her protruding vertebrae, sat a glassy sphere roughly the size of a Snitch, warm glow pouring out of its swirly whiteness in a wide circle.
You think you know the melody? Listen to the undercurrent… there are many layers. Just like in this story.
After a moment of awkward silence, he picked up walking. Clearing his throat, he aimed for a light tone when he pondered: “If only we had some Floo powder.”
Still in thought, out of the corner of his eye, he suddenly spotted something glowing: Somewhen Glow, the glow of things connected to his former life. Drawn to the source of light, he nosed forward until he had reached a side of the hay pile, where, hidden beneath a white tablecloth, he found an assortment of food, drink and everyday items. The snow had covered it up.
the way he had imagined the L-word conversation to go. Harry chanced a glance at Draco's scarlet face. He caught Harry's eye and reddened even deeper, but he didn't avert his gaze and right there, in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, in utter darkness, in the company of Life and Death and via words spoken by another, they
Manor Library had officially opened its doors on September 1st. Of course, the current selection left a lot to be desired, but the foundation Hermione had managed to gather so far, was solid and quite diverse. Draco himself had gotten the first library card and was in the middle of working his way through several volumes of
the best.” She looked thoughtful. “And I think Harry could use some dancing. You look pale. Are you alright?”
“Well, you were always jetting around the globe and I thought, just in case, if something were to happen to you... It was really just a precaution for your safety. ” She squirmed under his glare. “But I should have asked you first.”
Lacie followed nonchalantly. She extended her hand. “Have this, too. For the company; it was fun to have guests.” What she offered was a small silver thimble. “It can buy a moment with this – when there is not so fun guests.” As Malfoy made no move to reach for the gift, Lacie made an impatient gesture. “It will need it. It has baggage. Magic baggage. Like
“Of course not. He never was alive – or human. Same goes for a number of 'afterimages' that could be deemed as ghost-like. First and foremost, moving portraits –
While Harry's heaving slowly subsided, Malfoy simply continued holding his hand. When the blond boy finally spoke, it was barely audible: “You already apologized enough, Potter.”
The reason that Holle gets to change names all the time and Berchthold doesn't is simply because I realised that it was confusing enough with
“Don't know what they're all on about. I'm going back to sleep.” With that Ember turned around  and trudged off.
Death's laugh rolled like thunder overhead. “Not at all. That came rather unexpected. What we did do though was to make sure Draco had the best chances to succeed. For one, we never
"I guess you could ride with Gee and me for a while,” Half chimed in, hastily fastening a bag to his horse. “He has six legs after all."
With a sigh, he headed out to the grounds and down to the banks, yet his feet seemed to have decided on a different destination, away from the crumbled walls and towards the edge of the Forbidden Forest.
I probably bored the hell out of you (really sorry!) and definitely forgot some stuff, but yeah. Someone had asked for information on The Hunt, so here you go. If you ever want to know something specific, drop a comment.
“Did you know?” she asked chipper. “There used to hang a portrait of your great aunt Walburga here. She insulted everyone passing by. Guess someone took it down. Well, good riddance if you ask me. She was very annoying.”
“Not a dream, eh?” Now that the Slytherin had started laughing, he couldn't stop and his shaking body trembled through Harry's hand, as they were still connected via the cup. “We fell through a trick stair way down without getting hurt and are currently in a room immune to our magic, with a Muggle book character and, haha, not only did I get to sit on your lap earlier and you were basically cuddling me, but
They had reached the second floor and upon opening several doors (one of which was a cosy looking bedroom that had, despite the abandonment of the house, a warm, lived-in feeling to it) they had finally found Grimmauld Place' private library. A room which turned out to be big, naturally lit and somewhat friendly, with a round fluffy rug dominating the spacious middle between walls and walls filled with books. To Draco though, it seemed a bit weird that there was basically no dust to be seen anywhere.
They're not weird! All headings are lines of the popular Christmas song Carol of the Bells. Of course, the lines are not in the right order, more like the way they fit with the content of the chapters. As the story is somewhat centred around Christmas, it seemed fitting.
The Wild Hunt. Harry was part of them now. Logically, he also realised that although the sky was almost black now, the smooth pace of the horses had not changed at all. They were galloping through the air as easily as before, protected by unseen forces.
The redhead leant closer to get a better look and searched the immediate area with mounting nervousness. “But that can't... Hermione, where are they?”
“Pleasure,” said Malfoy stiffly and Harry got the feeling that things were very wrong if the blond git thought it necessary to be polite to house-elves.
“Then why,” Harry pulled in frustration and ended up with Malfoy toppling over and pulling them both down, with the final outcome of the blond boy being splayed half in Harry's lap, who groaned and sacked back into the chair, “don't you ask Perfect Potter over there how to undo this predicament? I'm sure a Slytherin would know the answer. No wait, maybe you should have imagined a Ravenclaw me.”
.” Her threatening eyes shifted upwards. “Keep him in check, Harry, or I can't guarantee your safety. We don't take it kindly when your species talks badly about us.” She looked back at Draco, locking eyes. “You are warned.”
“Unless she had reasons to. Perchta can be odd at times,” Wolfe mused. “Maybe she thought it funny.”
Indeed. There was the night sky. It was of a deep endless blue and dotted with countless tiny lights, no clouds in sight.
For a moment it seemed as though nobody had heard him, but then quick footsteps became audible, increasing in volume as they approached the door.
Wolfe turned a prancing Binky towards him, her face nervous. “Ember is infantry, so to speak. He – he did something not so great in life and that's why they wouldn't give him a horse and make him a hunter. But don't worry. He's a fast runner.”
. Flying was great! Even on a gluttonous horse, with a singed-smelling guy behind him, in the middle of a crazy crowd of dead people.
From that moment on, as if on cue, the masses took the opportunity to circle Harry and express their heart-felt thanks, whether he wanted to hear them or not.
Harry stared after her, barely noticing that the moment she had left, the noises around him had picked up again and colours had grown brighter once more.
How bizarre it was to think that they, ever rivals, always fighting, had kissed each other with fervour just an hour ago.
Draco gulped. Being honest, saying out loud what he really felt... how long had it been? But could he? Could he be open with Potter?
“I don't know.” Granger's bushy hair drifted in the wind and she watched the waves come ashore. “Maybe she was whisked over when her mother died and then just went with them. We can't say for sure. I mean, why did they take Paisley? Must be a reason.” She looked at him. “We'll find out, I'm certain of it. And... maybe we need to look into the animal spirits, too?”
Adrenaline was flooding him. Wasn't flying just the best feeling in the world? Seeker reached out his hand to brush the ceiling.
“The lake. I've seen this before, through the window in our common room,” disclosed Draco. He'd just spotted something: A swarm of tiny silver fish had entered their pool of light, only to immediately disappear again, moving like one entity and cutting through the water like a knife. “Anyway, shouldn't you
Sometimes they just needed a little reminder of why they were so good together. Like that Europe tour they'd done in September, right after the big gala for the first anniversary of the opening of Manor Library.
Er, that sort of just happened? I had several lore elements I wanted to include (soul being taken from a sleeper, someone getting punished for insulting The Hunt, geese honks getting quieter the closer you come when approaching death) and they just somehow fit like that. I wanted the sleeper's soul (=Dreamer) to be a baby because they would have to carry that person around all the time.
If you know the lines of the song differently that's because there seem to be some variations. I stuck with the sheet music of my choir.
, but after years of contrary experiences… I mean, it  could be, they were simply coughed out on the other side of the castle. Just the same though, it could be something more serious, so seeking aid from a professor sounds reasonable. However,” she continued over Ron's sharp inhale, “we can't risk it, as there is a decent possibility that word gets back to Umbridge. A message though... that's actually an ingenious idea!”
Mrs. Longbottom's face stayed politely blank, even though Draco could feel disdain rolling off of her like a wave. Of course she would despise any ex-Death Eater, after what happened to her family.
horse (reference to Death; don't say I hid things from you, it was all there in plain sight the whole time), or connecting chapters through little things (Draco sings a song, next chapter Harry sings a song etc.). The ambivalence of Hunt themes was also quite fascinating – is The Hunt good or bad (depends on perception), what is punishment, what reward... And also the many opposites there are in the story: life and death, hope and despair, Draco and Harry, but also Draco's solitary Christmas in the beginning of the story and his many Christmas parties in the end. Here also more symbolism: growth, acceptance from others but also accepting himself; going full circle. Just as when Harry first comes to The Hunt, he talks to Life and when his final talk (in the Forest) is with Death. Kind of poetic, don't you think?
With that she pulled up a hood over her cow horns and clicked her tongue which caused the wagon to gain momentum.
“It simply means, we met you before we died. When we were all alive,” Half picked up the conversation. “In The Hunt when you see something or someone glow like us, it means you know them from your time
Draco would have probably shivered if he hadn't been working so hard that he sweated instead. Planting trees (even with magic) was rather laborious. He already knew he would be dead tired tonight.
One of the tiny creatures wearing a skirt and a blouse with a matching blue hat looked vaguely familiar.
“She's waiting, too,” Death said and pointed ahead where the trees thinned, allowing the view onto a familiar scene: Holle's Pond glittered in the low autumn sun and The Hunt was scattered all around it, noisy as ever.
Hermione quickly cut in, bless her, “we, that is Ron, Draco and I, have been looking for clues to free you from The Hunt and this was our research headquarters. Also,” and at this she gave Potter such a stern look that Draco could feel him flinch where their legs touched, “Draco is our friend now, so you better treat him nicely.”
“What's that?” inquired Granger, looking annoyed for not knowing something for once. Served her right.
Not one of the busy last-minute Christmas shoppers was aware that something big and terrible had just happened. That in this very minute, the last memory had disappeared, of a boy who never lived.
A present for Mother. Check. A present for Father. Check. A present for Aunt Andromeda and a present for Teddy. Double check. A present for Hermione, for the Weasel, for Theodore, for Pansy, for Howard, for Eagle, for Kreacher... Draco sighed. Being friendly with people really tore a hole in his finances.
“Whoa, easy there, Potter, maybe you should sit down?” Malfoy's hand was on Harry's arm, steadying him.
Draco didn't have the heart to tell them that he had actually already made plans to visit his parents in France. He would just have to wing it somehow.
So, he entered Ollivanders and a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop. The narrow store was as austere and dusty as it had been when he'd been eleven.
“You know,” Harry pointed out while tenderly brushing a stray strand of blond hair behind Draco's ear, “you can't actually order me around. I'm not a child.”
Before he could dive deeper into his musings though, there was dinner to be had and a cat to please.
“How should we go about this?” Cassius asked and produced some more parchment, ink and quills from his pockets. “Looking up everything about Helga Hufflepuff would take forever. Also...” he fidgeted and then glanced up rather sheepishly, “I'm not grand at, er, research and stuff.”
“Because I'm Half.” For once, the jokester's face was serious. Harry was about to say that he had known
It was his own guilt mixed with the new-found need of her assistance that made Draco go  “Don't call her that!” in a slightly louder voice than anticipated.
“Nothing,” said Draco as he put his hand to his chest for a moment. “It's just that he's a do-gooder kind of person and he blames himself for every death he couldn't prevent.”
Mabel leant over and whispered to them: “Normally, merpeople exchange 'hearts' as sign of their companionship. But humans don't have anything like that to offer, so to give a human one's 'heart' is a big deal.”
He swallowed. “I would like to formally apologise for all the mistreatment you endured in my residence.” It felt terribly inadequate.
“Not sure how this works, but I guess, I'll just have to think about wanting to find The Hunt?” Harry pondered.
He ground his teeth. “Regardless, Potter – someone – has been abducted by The Wild Hunt and we need to rescue him!”
Eyeing the loop-door warily, Ron asked: “So, what should we do now? Wait? Ask a teacher for help? Try sending a message in after them?”
. It will show you the way then. That's a new enchantment Draco and I worked on for years. You'll remember the word?” Teddy nodded. “Right. With that, you have them all.”
It was cold. Icy wind was whipping Draco's hair into his eyes and he cast another warming charm. Yet the sea spray carried up by the stiff breeze went a step further and had Draco clammy all over.
“Seriously? Are there no normal rooms in this castle?” Malfoy grumbled and stepped inside. “Now, left or right?”
For a while, there was no sound from inside the house and Draco was just about to knock again, when faint footsteps could be heard and the door was unbarred.
“But,” Draco hesitated, shifting uncomfortably in Harry's half-embrace, “I visited Ollivanders, just before I lost my last memory of you. I didn't have time to write it down yet.”
So, if you don't care for stuff like that then thank you for reading Storm Chasers. If you are a bit like me and always curious about what the author's intentions were and such then go ahead.
“Couldn't have done it if you had given me away at the Manor. If you'd identified me then, I would have been too dead to save you.” Potter managed to grin, that idiot.
Only lit by the stars and the dim glow from the distant castle, he could barely see Malfoy's profile when the latter spoke: “I never believed you before, you know? About hating being in the limelight. I always thought you were so annoying for acting humble while you secretly enjoyed it. Or maybe it was just that I wished
Draco stood dumbfounded for a moment, staring at the closed door. Did that just really happen? Did Hermione Granger,  Muggle-born extraordinaire, simply walk into his bedroom and order him around? He blinked. And what was that about a hu– The Wild Hunt! Potter! Dammit, he had forgotten about him again!
“I suppose we have to wait for a while for Ada to return. Maybe we could... Mother, won't you tell us a story of old?” Mabel suggested.
“When what happened?” Stuck-Up wrinkled his nose at Draco. “Really, Malfoy, start making sense, will you?”
Harry was just about to say something uplifting, when a pearly someone came crashing through the tinted glass.
“What do you reckon they use this place for?” Harry mused. He snickered. “Maybe McGonagall rehearses her dance lessons here? Remember?
“Who would have ever thought that members of Dumbledore's Army and the Inquisitorial Squad would one night work together?” Ron grinned and slapped Warrington on the shoulder. “Weird, eh? DA and IS, united.”
“Before that – about Potter...” He faltered. Mother Weasley kept smiling at Draco in the way of the oblivious. Draco gave up. “No, thank you. I must be going, I think.”
Then he traversed the room and planted himself next to Draco, pulling up his (holy shit!) bare feet and sitting cross-legged on the love seat. His knee came to lie on top of Draco's thigh, who simply stared. What was going on? Meanwhile Potter had both hands around his cup of tea and looked totally at ease.
“And you would know that how?” The clumsy attempt at a cheering-up from Malfoy's side still tingled in Harry's hair. It was weirdly conciliatory.
He was about to tell that to his companion, when he found, he was alone in the forest. He clicked his tongue. Little moss bastard, what a prank to leave Seeker alone like a fool.
“Ah, yes! We were talking about old fairy tales, weren't we? Well, my favourite story has always been
Draco swatted away a precariously wandering hand, yet couldn't suppress a grin. Good gracious, Harry’s perseverance had always been endearing; which was a problem now.  “Would you stop it, you tosser?! You might not have had enough opportunities for this last year, but that doesn't mean–”
Draco shifted a bit further away. “You said you didn't remember us during your time with The Hunt. So
A few bodies over were entangled Fred and George, mouths open and snoring. All along they'd been a double deal. Witnessing them apart after the war had been like meeting them all over again and Harry had realised that he liked them both for different reasons. Fred's impish protectiveness of his friend Seeker had really caused quite the uproar, but in hindsight Harry was thankful. The open cheerfulness of Fred’s had made Harry welcome – be it back in first year at Platform 9¾ or at The Hunt. He was one of the best people Harry knew.
That gave even the tipsy former Gryffindor pause and Draco, completely bewildered but thankful for the excuse, pointed at the purring cat to indicate the impossibility of him making a fool of himself on a Hogwarts kitchens' table. Thomas shrugged and gave up. That was good, because... Draco had the sudden strange feeling that if he ever were to dance on tabletops it would be with someone else. Someone–
Draco exchanged looks with Granger. She was distraught, he could tell, but determination settled in as she nodded once. “Why don't you see what useful books you can find here and meanwhile I head to Hogwarts alone? I think this might go faster with Kreacher's help.”
“Wait!” Queen Harry had made it across the table and was grabbing for them now. “That's dangerous! Draco, don't!”
“Ah, yeah, so...” Malfoy hesitated, then quickly grabbed the piece of metal and shoved it into his pocket. “Thanks.”
“Young man, I see an early bedtime in your future if you don't listen,” the man said sternly. “or do you want me to tell Mummy?”
“...I really missed you this year, you know? I missed us.” Potter blushed despite his solemn tone. “I mean the banter.”
“As a matter of fact, we as well have a transgression of school rules to report,” Hermione continued, unfazed.
Seeker hummed non-committally. Through all this, all he had known for sure was that he needed to speak with Draco. The other boy's confession had come as a surprise. Concerning Seeker's own feeling towards Draco, he wasn't completely sure himself. He just knew that, for some reason, he trusted him and whatever Draco meant to him – these feelings were warm and aching and
“Er, well, not really. I mean, we have a few books, but honestly... you know our house, Hermione, we don't have space for a room just for books. Where would we put that?”
Something like that. I'm sorry, it's been too long. We sang those rhymes to you when you were but babes.”
“Draco. Please, say my name,” Seeker pleaded. It would be so easy. After all this fruitless trying today.
“She isn't!” proclaimed Potter vehemently and Draco secretly agreed. Well, not that he cared either way.
Right, they had talked about that before. Seeker, while not being dead, was slowly getting there with the knots of his bracelet turning red, Dreamer's bracelet however was still as pristine white today as it had been the day they had picked her up. That was because their circumstances were different.
Draco skipped stones frustratedly, while Granger had sat down on a piece of grass with a Warming Charm.
“Yes, thank you for the well-meant 'help'.” Draco waved the interjection away with the trained movement of an arrogant aristocrat. Harry knew this wasn't wise, but he also knew it was a hoot. He squeezed Draco tighter, who spoke once again: “Now I have a question for the bird lady: What's your actual name?”
Harry chuckled quietly. “Only you can turn an insult into an endearment.” He drew back a bit to better look at Draco, his pupils blown wide. “Proves my point though. Wouldn't have worked if you hadn't meant it. Now...” He leant back in.
Harry had stopped between two broad trees. There, almost hidden under debris, was the source of the faint glow they'd been following.
A breeze ruffled their hair. Music from the castle was quietly drifting through the air – someone must have opened the high windows in the Great Hall.
Potter huffed. “Well, yes, but that was before you kissed me like there's no tomorrow. Draco, come on, this is ridiculous!” His face grew concerned. “Why do you keep pushing me away?”
“And don't forget the storm wind, lightning and thunder,” Ember whisper-shouted into Harry's ear, a vapour of burnt smell hitting his nose.
what to do to get him freed, but I can't bloody find him. And all it would take is calling his name once. That's it! Easy enough one should think, but
Harry didn't go for the bait. “The question is,” he said calmly, “which is to be master, the words or you – that's all. Whether to make them powerful, the words. Your refusal to call him
“Seeker, calm down! We're already over another country,” Wolfe tried to convince him. Her face caught the first light of the moon that tinted her scars silvery.
“Cool,” Finnigan, always the mood-swing, was already grinning again, “see you Saturday then. Now I need a drink. What about you?”
Acquitted. Huh. Draco let out a long-held breath. Who would have seen that coming? Not him, that's for sure. Right up until the end of the trial he had been certain that he would spend the rest of his life in a cell in Azkaban – whether that would have been a long solitude or a short dread till receiving the Dementor's Kiss.
“You're welcome.” The answer was already fading when they advanced back into the bowels of the castle.
that seems as if woven from clouds. I guess it's part of yours? Looks a bit like it. But mostly, the dead giveaway (excuse the pun) was the elder plant that she supposedly gave to mankind. I mean,
Mid-December found Harry and Draco sitting in Ronald and Hermione's apartment for a joint gift wrapping session. The mood was light and the wireless was radiating holiday spirits.
Harry still grinned as he opened the bathroom door and was flooded with thankfulness. Here was another thing he'd missed without consciously missing it: toilets.
Holle I took because I knew the fairy tale and thought it was funny. Berchthold... I just thought the name was unusual, so it appealed to me. In retrospective I should have named him Herne, for this version of The Hunt's leader seems to be most wide-spread.
They'd been at it for a while now and hadn't really got anywhere. He was starting to feel a headache forming.
The firelight was painting Harry's features in a soft glow and Draco found himself  unexpectedly mesmerised by hearing Harry's low voice reading poetry to him. Wow, that was quite the find. He'd have to remember that for later.
think your name is boring? Are you hungry? Do you like bonfires?” he rattled off while pulling. “The brown one is mine. Her name is Grapes, because she likes grapes. And that is Half's horse, Gee.”
“Howard, come here, good kitty-kitty!” Draco crooned, trying to coax the cat out from under the kitchen counter of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
Maybe sometimes you need someone, who just listens, for you to find your own truths. Yeah, he... maybe he liked Potter... a tiny bit.
“In here!” he yelled and within seconds a very upset Hermione appeared in the living room of number 12, Grimmauld Place.
Death sighed, his breath like a storm gale. “After The Battle of Hogwarts, in the weeks before you joined us, you were closer to me than while you were with The Hunt. Do you understand what I'm saying?”
“Death is part of life, you know,” Half offered carefully. “You can't help them now. But look at us: We are dead. That doesn't mean we can't still be happy. Alright?”
“He is. Good to a fault. That's why he deserves some rescuing himself this time round,” Draco sighed.
“Morning, Draco. Ron just meant, you would absolutely still have had time to, er, change before coming over,” said Granger (who now sometimes had the audacity to call Draco by his first name as if that was normal) and folded a Muggle newspaper. “Want some breakfast?”
He sighed and placed the crown back on his head. All this was just too weird. He needed to get out of wherever this was. And the best way to do that, was through. So Harry, his owl on his shoulder, started to stir his horse (with a stern look: “NO, Lightning!”) among the surrounding people.
“It's the master key to Malfoy Manor and its grounds. I'm giving the properties to you as a permanent loan. Don't worry about the peacocks; they flew off while we were in holding. And in case you're wondering: There are no house-elves left. Also, while the garden is a bit overgrown yet rather nice still, the house itself might need a deep scrub for residual dark magic... ”
“It was only for your own good!” Half shouted back, rubbing his face, ugly blotches appearing on his cheeks. “You should thank me!”
“Alright, but why did you, Holle, let magic doers steal a piece of your pond? I know that legend is true, I saw the archway at the Ministry,” Harry ventured.
On that matter, I re-set the updating schedule to bi-weekly (for now), since I just currently can't get any decent writing done in one week, what with my social life actually starting to exist again.
. But it... when I'm with him, the chaos calms down a bit. We can simply be Malfoy and Potter and bicker and banter and all that. You wouldn't think so with our history, but sometimes it's easier to be around him than Ron or Hermione. I mean, he gets it...”
Seeker blinked. Indeed, there really were miniscule letters on the leaf, barely to make out. He squinted his eyes and tried to decipher the text:
“One's enough.” Weasley literally beamed now. “My brother Bill. He's currently working a desk job at Gringotts, so if we'd send him an owl now–”
While they were settling into a rhythm of reciting the incantation, Draco’s thoughts wandered back, wondering how it had come to be that he now was peacefully working side by side with Harry Potter as if it was the most normal thing in the world.
“So, all things I mentioned so far are related to ghost types of the mind or in other words, they are somewhat connected to character and personality. There is however also another sort of ghost-like apparitions that are linked to the soul.”
Tightening his hands in Malfoy's hair, Harry was about to give a sharp reply about how Cedric had been so much
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Wow, that is spectacular.” The Weasel put his arm around Granger and she laid her head onto his shoulder.
“The what?” Harry asked before he could hold his tongue and regretted it instantly as him talking seemed to trigger an even tighter hold by Tillie's hand.
“Er, yes, er,” Potter ummed and erred, “ah, so, Mabel said we can't go up because of The Hunt, but you just said some of your people are on the surface? We really just want to get back inside the school.”
This is starting to be a running gag - me never actually making the deadline I wanted to make. Therefore, again, apologies for the late upload.
Yeah, well. Frankly speaking, there are too many dead people in the Harry Potter universe. I could have included the Marauders, Lilly, Snape, Dumbledore, Dobby, Mad-Eye, Tonks, Cedric etc. But where to stop? It would have been too many, so I decided on the Fallen Four with the explanation that the Resurrection Stone called for The Hunt. I could have tried to include the unnamed Fallen of Hogwarts as well, but I think that joining The Hunt is a choice and the others just didn't take it.
“There was a call for you,” Granger informed him while pouring Draco a cuppa, “from that Swedish Muggle library you went to last month. It was on the answering machine when we came home yesterday.”
Mr. Ollivander leaned a bit forward, even more into Draco's personal space. “I was tortured. I thought I would die in your house. But... it was fascinating to see what He Who Must Not Be Named's wand could do, up close. Terrible, yes, but great.” He reached out a pale finger and tapped at Draco's left arm, making the latter flinch away. “Witnessing his power was... formidable.”
Harry rolled his eyes fondly. Kreacher really resembled a doting parent at times (“Master Harry should eat! Master Harry should take a shower! Master Harry should go for a walk!”).
Unfortunately, this had two unpleasant side effects: The first was the replacement of memories of Cedric by memories of Malfoy, laughing and awkwardly swim-dancing with the merpeople. Gosh, hadn't it been the epitome of cuteness to see the stuck-up Slytherin let loose like that? Harry was almost tempted to think of it as, shudder, endearing and this train of thought was simply appalling. Why couldn't he keep this nonsense at bay tonight? He normally managed so well...
Tom,” she pointed at the barman, “to inform me the next time you came in – and it took five bloody months.
“It's beautiful,” Potter said quietly, turning the pages of his new scrapbook. In it were pictures of things that had happened while he had been away. Draco had learned how to use a camera just for that.
Draco, nerves still frayed from the recent happenings, felt a sting. All he wanted was to get in on that cuddling, but all he could do was stand awkwardly on the side. Even though he had fought for a year to keep the memories of Potter, even though Draco's feelings were in free fall – to Potter, they were Patcher comrades at best. Nothing had changed for him. Draco might get a thank-you-pat on the back and a gold star, but that would be it. What had he thought would happen once Potter was rescued?
Inside was a sort of brick-built hallway. Its walls had a certain curve to them, so that the gallery was most likely making a perfect circle around whatever was hidden behind the inner wall.
AKA The Wild Hunt would visit his barn due to the fact that it had been built on top of an old road. Such buildings were often in danger of being torn down by the riders.
“To help you,” Draco whispered. He felt his chest tightening. What had he done leaving Gregory alone for so long? The boy just wasn't built to take care of himself.
“Deal.” Queen Harry snapped his fingers and immediately their hands were free to move, no longer glued to the cup. Harry couldn't suppress a shudder, when the apparition continued: “And if I win, I'll get to keep him. Forever. So, stop hitting on my boy.”
Equally good had been Hermione and Ronald's first wedding anniversary later that month during which they renewed their vows, so that Harry wouldn't have to feel like he'd missed too much while he'd been away.
“Second marking,” Mabel announced, gesturing at a perfectly round stone circle up ahead. “That's our school. We have it a bit away from the village because the kids can get loud at times.”
The castle lay silent, giving off a somewhat eerie, deserted vibe. Of course no one was here this early in the morning.
They were almost standing shoulder to shoulder and Draco glanced quickly at Potter's face, before averting his eyes back onto the cloak. “Your things weren't here. Only this fellow. Every personal belonging that indicated your existence had been eradicated. You weren't even mentioned in any of the books about the war.”
Tillie squirmed when Lacie wrangled Harry from her hands. “Deal is deal. We give it back to Master Malfoy.”
“Right... Malfoy, why are you here again?” The Weasel's face was scrunched up in thought. It looked right painful. “What were we talking about?”
“Be careful, Potter. If you tumble into the water, there's no way I'll let you back into my hair.” Ugh, shudder,
Suddenly the centre of attention, Ember fidgeted uncomfortably. “I... I'm not good with these things. Words and stuff. Seeker, you picked her up, you do it.”
In any case, Harry and Draco had taken to eating at Draco's aunt's house almost as often as at Ron and Hermione's or The Burrow.
sorry about all the other things. I never wanted you expelled or hurt or worse. I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't know it would turn out like this. I was blind to the consequences and I didn't, I didn't... I... Potter...” All of this had cascaded out of Draco involuntarily and in his inner turmoil he had crossed the space between them, totally ignoring the still poised wand, and had now both his hands dug in Potter's front, standing face to face with the Saviour.
That reminded Harry of something he had been meaning to ask for a while. He cleared his throat. “Since we're at naming and all, I've been wondering, Wolfe, why is your horse named Binky?”
Maybe he should just take all this rubbish back to the stores and spend the reimbursement on a nice little solitary trip to Hawaii... At the moment, Draco was very tempted to do just that, since he was currently in the middle of a full-to-the-bursting-point Diagon Alley on December 24th. Merlin, could people not shop for Christmas presents a bit earlier?
“Yes,” she nodded solemnly, “a terrible place. Your aura was pitch black back then, but it looks much better now. So, dance?” She held her hand out for him to take.
“Nothing,” Harry had quickly reassured and added seeing Draco's furrowed brows. “He's just curious. But he didn't
“Oh, I just realised it's Halloween this weekend. Ginny and I had thought of going to visit my parents' graveside together.”
“Have a biscuit,” Alice interposed and smiled absentmindedly. “They are VERY dry.” No one paid her any heed.
The roaring reached its peak and Draco felt as if the rushing of the winter storm's gales were trying to blow him away. He groped blindly for Potter to pull him down. But Draco's hands came up empty. So, he waited. Trapped within the storm for what he experienced like an eternity, until, in the end, the turbulence had died down to nothing but a soft murmur, stray snowflakes falling gently.
“Let's do this then,” Draco instructed, “Ember? Come over here. You too, Mr. Withane. Hold the bodies close together.”
Up, up they soared, air rushed through Harry's hair and his robes whipped out behind him – and in a rush of fierce joy he realised he'd found something he could do without being taught – this was easy, this was
He was cut off as Potter abruptly moved up and basically threw himself at Draco. Bodily. Draco lost his balance and fell backwards, landing on his behind, Potter half on top of him. The latter was now bawling his eyes out, hands tightly fisted into the front of Draco's robes. Wonderful, really
Strolling over to the windowsill, he picked up Harry's scrapbook and perched next to a snuggling heap of Howard and Eagle. The book was a lot thicker now, since Harry and Draco kept adding new pictures ever since last Christmas.
“Potter,” Draco sighed and rubbed a hand over his face. If he'd learnt one thing about Granger during their years in school together it was that she was persistent. And really, would it hurt to say it out loud once? “Okay, fine, maybe – possibly – I
This story is for I. who made me watch Teen Wolf which brought on my interest in The Wild Hunt. She would laugh her ass off about Lightning the horse.
Harry came home with the first rays of sunrise and when he finally fell asleep, he heard Malfoy singing in his head:
Harry grinned. For a bloke who'd just screamed his head off, Malfoy had quickly regained his composure – and his cheek. “Not so easy without brooms. Although, I accidentally blew up my Aunt Marge once. I could try doing that for you? So you can float up?” He blinked innocently at Malfoy who looked somewhere between scandalised and 'you're kidding'. “Or we could simply take one of those.” Harry pointed away from the pile of pillows.
Draco slapped the book shut. Ever since he had told Teddy that story, Mother Holle was his favourite character of The Hunt. But reading the same thing over and over again would get him nowhere.
“One that calculates you would say just that,” Draco snapped and turned his head away. The only thing ridiculous here was Harry who was just too thick to understand that there was
Malfoy snorted bitterly. “That should be my line, don't you think? I tried to turn you over to the Dark Lord."
! Catching her will mean the end of everything. We have to stop this! Stop The Hunt from chasing her!”
Draco pinked. The others laughed and Lovegood invited Kreacher to sit with them, which he, to everyone's surprise, agreed to.
“They need it. They weren't ready to be separated yet. Hey, we even gave George a Hunt name – OtherHalf.” Taking note of his boyfriend's concerns, Harry had lifted Draco's chin then and had looked him in the eyes. “I promise to be careful. As
Distractedly Draco pointed his wand at the broken pieces. “I suppose you are right. I will look for her starting tomorrow.” A fixed cup wrapped in a snake sprang into his hand. “But it was only twice. Cadair Idris doesn't count, we missed you there.”
“Of course, right away,” the elf cheeped in delight. He closed his lids and screwed up his face in concentration. When he blinked his huge eyes open again, he looked confused. “Dobby cannot find Harry Potter anywhere in Hogwarts. Is Miss Hermione sure Harry Potter is in the castle?”
Worth a try though. “It would be just a little hex? Itsy-bitsy?” Draco made exaggerated puppy eyes at Harry, who had to laugh along with the others, and then leant over to kiss his boyfriend.
stern look when he rushed in without knocking and found her sitting on her sofa in front of a cosy fire.
“What is it?” he asked, mesmerised, one hand carding through the brightness, watching with delight how every movement changed the curly patterns.
“Youngest Seeker at Hogwarts in a hundred years? Winner of the Triwizard Tournament? Defeater of the bloody Dark Lord?!” Draco's voice rose with every word until he was almost bellowing at the top of his lungs.
“How generous.” Harry held out his hand, palm up, in front of Draco's face. “Do I get that now or what?”
“Oh, that's a good name for her,” cooed Wolfe and leant over the baby. “As she will never wake...” Her face fell for a moment. “Well, what about this one then?” She tried to sound cheerful, but everyone heard her swallow. She was gesturing towards the hellhound, lying curled up in a ball at Ember's left knee, eyes on Dreamer.
“I'll have you know,” drawled Draco, suddenly in high dudgeon on Potter's behalf for being called 'Pooper', “that he did indeed bravely best a dragon – on three different occasions! AND yes, he can fly. Actually, he is the best flyer you'll ever see on a broom. The youngest Seeker at Hogwarts in a century. Not that you would understand the significance, Weasel, with your poor flying skills.”
Still, it had taken all of Draco to get out of bed that day and even more so not to crawl right back in once they had found out that the traditional appearance period of The Wild Hunt typically ended on January 6th. They would have to wait for the next Yuletide to come around to find the ghost riders again. Which meant, Potter would have to stay with The Hunt for a whole year.
“– Harry!” announced his companion. Then he frowned. “That's a boring name. We will have to find you another one. How about–"
“Granger's right,” Cassius stressed. “How about a compromise then? With this blasting storm we should take precautions: Let's send them both, one as Pig as main carrier and Pepper as safeguard should something go wrong.”
“Wait, wait, wait, hold on. Peeves is not a dead person?” Weasley's eyes were wide as saucers and Draco silently wondered how he himself never knew all that. These were indeed 'eye-openers'.
And before either of the addressed could do any more than gape at him, Draco had fled the place of his defeat.
Malfoy squawked “No deal!” at the same time as Harry growled “Not yours.”and took very deliberately Malfoy's just-unstuck hand in his. Like Harry'd let some wacky illusion take possession of a schoolmate; even if it was the most infuriating git of all of Slytherin.
His friends looked back and forth between Draco and Thomas and finally decided to stay out of it, awkwardly walking away.
, to get Goyle sober and you here, to help. Thus, when Parkinson messaged that she would go and pick you up at the Leaky Cauldron, we all came to support
So Seeker found himself wandering back to the gang's camp fire after having petted Lightning for a bit (though Lightning had seemed to be far more interested in munching on some of the left-over feathers still sticking to Seeker's wardrobe).
(“It's one of my favourites. I thought you'd like it.”). They sang Christmas carols, told stories, ate some more and when it was finally time to go home, long after midnight, Harry and Draco took lots of left-overs with them to Grimmauld Place.
Suddenly two big owls and a tiny one fluttered from the top of the Christmas tree with indignant hoots and shot out the living room door past Draco. The tiny owl messing up several red hairdos in the process. All the raised voices in the room must have woken them.
He threw a resentful look at his self-imposed guard: Front legs folded neatly, Hagrid's hippogriff lay in the only patch of sunlight, watching Draco's every move. That beast.
Furrowing his brows, Harry did. Nothing. As much as he wiggled he didn't get his digits out from under the other boy's grip.
Having a child in his life was new and he still was insecure about handling Teddy, but Draco had taken a great liking to the little one. However, watching the gurgling infant now, Draco felt a sting. The Swedish baby girl had been so still. Yes, he was determined to get her back as well. Potter
Towards the end, Pansy had nudged Draco in the side and had leant closer, whispering: “Well, I suppose I can forgive you now – since you dropped me for
“Righttttt,” the redhead agreed and then launched into a wild marketing sale that had Draco's ears ringing when he finally stepped back out onto the street (
“Er, do I know you?” Harry choked as the young man enthusiastically strangle-dragged him along, back into the centre of the crowd.
Harry tore his eyes away from the peaceful image and tried to get more comfortable. Or less comfortable really. Sleeping on the ground for a year had, despite the protective Hunt magic, not been the most enjoyable kind of bedding and right now Harry felt the bed
His eyes were on the real Harry who squirmed a bit under the hard gaze. However, part of him was secretly pleased that Malfoy kept rejecting Queen Harry's advances. He scratched his nose. “Sort of?”
“We know this might come across a bit ludicrous, but yesterday was May the second,” Granger elaborated. Draco's brows furrowed. Of course he knew what the date implied – anniversary of The Battle of Hogwarts. “We talked about how lucky we are to still be alive and how many times we nearly died already and we thought 'Why wait? Life is bloody short'. So, here we go. Oh, speaking of going, Ron, I think we should head to The Burrow, tell everyone. Draco, do you mind if we reschedule dinner?”
“Why did you even come, Weasel?” Draco snapped, annoyed with the whole situation. It had all started out so well but in the end they only had one more person to look for and zero new information.
“Exactly. Your time had come there, but Master Harry deemed you worthy of saving. So we,” he inclined his head towards Holle, “let him save you. That time in the fire and now. All this was as much for your sake as it was for his.”
“You're all awful!” But Harry couldn't suppress a gleeful giggle as he, amazed by the ease with which his owl Snowdrop kept up with his horse Lightning's speed, reached out to caress the former in mid-air. He was awarded with a delighted hoot.
“What about his mother?” Draco asked as Millicent wordlessly pushed a quill and a small ink bottle at him.
Also, sorry for Draco being a little bigotted shit in this chapter. Please don't take it to heart. I'll talk to him about it and he'll be better in future chapters.
Head out of the gutter and into the game. “Alright, I'll put my hands on your hips and pull you up, yeah?”
“Goodbye,” he choked awkwardly into the group and left, glimpsing some of the heads turning his way and some of the faces furrowing their brows. One especially.
“What do we do now? Hex Malfoy and hope he forgets it?” Ron eyed the stilled name of his best friend miserably. “Or give him some antlers matching Parkinson's? Or maybe some cornflakes skin like Warrington?” Both of which had occurred this morning when oppressed students had lashed out. Yet, not even the amusing memory of the rightly punished Inquisitorial Squad members could lift Ron’s mood much at the moment.  “They haven't re-emerged today, have they? Served them right to get some for being so insufferable bullies.”
Harry fidgeted, looking this way and that. How to have a conversation like that with a former school bully in a sea of death and sadness when it was hard to formulate the words with his friends in the Weasleys' cosy living room?
“Seems like we're landing soon,” said Half desperately. He shot Harry a look. “Oh, come on, Seeker, you can't be mad at us forever.”
The girl nodded. “Good idea. But that might not be enough for such a specific topic. I was thinking – isn't there an actual wizarding library somewhere?”
The a silent, rueful smile appeared on his face. Yes, he hadn't been here for all the important things, but Draco had made sure Harry wasn't missing out completely. A warm and fuzzy feeling bubbled up from his stomach. What a wonderful, thoughtful gift indeed.
What Draco needed was... something else. Something of which he wasn't sure himself what it was. Just that he needed to find it. Preferably alone. Because, while everyone else was trying to get over the war, Draco was still in battle. With himself, his own demons, his guilt.
“Headmistress McGonagall, what brings you here at this hour?” Malfoy asked, clearly trying to steer the conversation away from the song.
The two of them had taken time off their busy (work) schedules and Draco had shown Harry  all the places he had visited while gathering information on The Hunt.
“Stalking is such a strong word, Harry.” He received a glare. “Ah, okay, okay, so, er, sometimes Headmistress McGonagall lets me roam during the nights. I guess she feels sorry for me. After all, it is pretty mean to have me under a sleeping spell all the time. It's like being back at the Dursleys', locked up in my cupboard all over again.”
“It's the last official hunt of the year,” Wolfe said lazily from her lying position on Binky's back, her legs dangling. Seeker wondered why she wasn't afraid to fall off. “See, The Wild Hunt is only in business for the Yuletide give or take, only in winter. For the other three seasons, we camp out somewhere and chill.”
She closed her eyes. Her face was calm. Then she shimmered, her outlines turning blurry, fading until there was nothing left but countless tiny specks of light swirling in the frosty winter air – and she was gone.
Wolfe sniffled a bit, but straightened her pose. “We don't and,” she glanced at the others, “we would love to remember, but the thing is, it's better that we don't. We can never go back and it would just make us unhappy pining after a life we can no longer have.”
Despite the increase of wintry gusts Draco suddenly felt a spark of warmth blossom in his stomach. And a lump formed in his throat, which he quickly cleared.
Potter had been so bland: a poorly dressed, scrawny boy with unkempt, windswept hair who could barely get out a whole sentence. He had been a no-one to Draco and yet even so, Potter's green eyes had captured Draco's interest and without knowing who the other boy was, Draco had decided to keep tabs on him.
“Well, off you go then,” sniffed Pansy and was delighted when the ginger grumbled silently, but got up to get the reference work anyway.
Aaaand here's a disclaimer: Some lines are direct quotes from the books. Obviously those are not mine.
“Alright,” grumbled a bodiless voice in front of Harry and he felt fingers wrapped in cold fabric close around his hand. “But you better tell me everything. And Harry? Stay close to me.”
“Sure.” Harry shrugged and turned to the fire to warm his hands. “My game went fine by the way. Our team won. I caught the Snitch.”
“Because I know you. You're not a murderer. You wouldn't have stood by and watched me get killed. I know that. You know that. You wouldn't have,” Harry reaffirmed. Then he cracked a wobbly smile. “Also, you would have missed fighting with me too much. Admit it.”
It worked better than the both of them had anticipated and so Malfoy's exhausted body crashed a bit too forcefully into Harry's, knocking the air out of the latter. “Oof!”
Laughing happily, Harry pressed his lips to Draco's once more. “Yep, completely sure. If I'm honest, I was thinking of doing it myself, proposing. You just beat me to it.”
Draco blinked. Looking up close, he had realised that the something hanging on the apparently female house-elf's belt had indeed been a bag of his and Kreacher's self-made biscuits. The things you see when you live long enough...
Hermione was always on their case these days to study for their upcoming O.W.L.s, they were still more than
The goldilocks among gingers gave him a tight-lipped smile. Don't lose your nerves now, Draco. “I can handle a few redheads. Mind you, I did this without you last year.”
“Yes, love,” Harry lifted their hands up and kissed Draco's knuckles, “just like everyone else. But I suspect,” here he flashed a brilliant smile in Death's direction, “that it'll be a long time before it's either of our turns, am I right, mate?”
“Are you talking about PewPew? Did you find him yet?” Twin Weasley had reappeared (if you could call it that, since his head was completely hidden behind a big pile of hazardously stacked knick-knack).
“Weird, in the past, a snake would have made me think of Slytherin, now it only reminds me of him... all I do these days is think about him,” the apparition said and Seeker finally shook out of his reverie. Of course the other boy was talking to Anguis.
Cards had come in, letters, and a parcel from the Withanes, containing pictures of Anne's first birthday party and a copy of her uncle's newest bestseller
“I think it's a great idea,” Cassius said jovially. “Let's do it and while we wait for his reply we can have a look at the Mell's opening. See if we can gain access. It's in the dungeons, near our common room.”
“Alright,” he acquiesced. “So, researching The Hunt. For that I suggest we go and have a look at the books at Hogwarts.”
“Let's put it this way, I 'hunted' Draco in his thoughts, since he was a wrongdoer – until he could no longer run and righted his wrongs somehow. Or in other terms: He was constantly thinking about you (at The Hunt) and because of that he evolved, walked new paths and did good along the way. Like patching broken buildings he inadvertently helped destroy, or finding missing people, whose misery his past actions unintentional facilitated. And plenty more. He was just as much in need of solid ground as you were, Master Harry. And just as you felt bad in the beginning when you came to The Hunt and started feeling better after,
“Right then, may I?” Harry reached out his arms for Anne and with visible hesitation, Mr. Withane gave him the child. “Anne, sweetheart,” Harry cooed, the baby's wide eyes attentively on his face, “can you please call your uncle?”
“Well, silver lining: Now the portrait can accept all their thanks in your stead.” Hermione grinned and Harry shot her a dirty look.
Pacing, Harry cast his gaze to the ceiling. What was taking him so long? “I didn't steal him, your father freed him. DOBBY!”
Harry felt a prick of pride as he took in the mended walls, the clean hallways and fixed windows. The Patchers had really done a splendid job here. Even though there were still minor repairs afoot, the school as whole had reattained its functionality so that starting  tomorrow, first of September, students could once again walk the venerable halls of Hogwarts.
Draco shifted uncomfortably. Normally, he would have sat himself next to the witch. After all, this had been his home for the last year; but if he acted that way, Potter would probably lose it. For him, Draco was an intruder in
Draco nodded. It felt still weird to talk so normally with these two. As if they hadn't been at each other's throats for years.
Looking back now, it was blatantly easy to decipher that Harry had had a thing for Draco way before Christmas last year. All the signs had been there: Like mostly being more comfortable around Draco than others or giddily looking forward to seeing him at Hogwarts. Harry'd subconsciously always sought his company, for Draco somehow represented peacefulness, safety... feeling alive. Chuckling, Harry conceded that even his own portrait had known he liked Draco; Harry had just needed time to come to terms with that. He wondered now if maybe that's why he had bought Draco a Christmas present last year? Following the thought, Harry contemplated if possibly he had hoped to work up the nerve to ask Draco for a cup of tea sometime? Mhm, curious.
She released her iron grip and left Draco to swim for himself now, lazily circling them like a shark.
Tearing his gaze from his dead former friend, Draco managed to give the tiny boy at his arm an amused look. “Did he now? I wonder what else he said about me?”
The redhead gaped at him as if Draco had just sprouted wings, and remained like that unblinkingly until his sister came up from behind, throwing an arm around the Weasel's shoulders. “Who is– What do
“Yeah, but,” it was Weasley who answered, hand awkwardly on his neck, “we just want to know, you know. What he's like. Even if we forget instantly. For instance what does he have to feel guilty about?”
“Don't encourage her!” Weasley hissed feebly, but he still paid rapt attention as Granger continued after a sharp side-glance at the ginger.
Harry shrugged. “Why not? If I'm the master, I can set my servant free. Like your father did with Dobby. Really not that difficult, I think. And didn't The Tale of the Three Brothers end with them as equals, the third brother and Death?”
A knock on the door interrupted him mid-sentence. Filius Flitwick popped his head in, dangling a bottle of wine and two long-stemmed glasses in one hand. “Good evening, Minerva! I thought you might be up for a nightcap? Oh! Mr. Malfoy, you're here, too? How lovely! Merry Christmas!”
Malfoy, in the middle of adjusting his cloak, looked up, flabbergasted. “What now? Potter, are you seriously that stupid? We're free, let's make a run for it!”
Look he did though, when Potter lifted his wand and weaved a complicated figure into the air: left, right, diagonally across, upwards curve and tiny clockwise loops fizzling out towards the end.
Scanning their surroundings, he had found that they had landed in an oval room, maybe fifteen metres in length, with a high, slightly curved ceiling that was, at one end, pierced by the hole they had fallen through. More to the middle of the chamber was a long table, laid out for many people, the dishes covered in a thick layer of dust. Oddly though, the candles in the candelabra on the tabletop were lit, casting a flickering twilight on the walls. Those were an earthy colour and adorned with four life-like, painted trees in the four cardinal directions. They were all Flowering Cherry trees (Harry should know, Aunt Petunia was so proud of hers), but all of them in different seasons: Starting to their right was a smaller tree in full, pink blossom, next came a green summer one (biggest of the four by far), then, on the opposite was a colour gradient autumn tree, red on top slowly transitioning into yellow, and lastly a leafless winter version covered in snow. The most interesting thing about these four trees was the fact that they silently shed leaves (or snow, in the winter one's case), ever so softly falling, falling...
“I've been a bit busy, okay? The Ministry asks me to help with charities and stuff. I can't be here as often as
Weird how it was the snobbish, hurtful kid Harry had so often argued with who had won his heart. He put the mug down onto the table. Fitting together his before-, during- and after-memories was confusing.
As they made their way towards the gates Potter's mood suddenly seemed to plummet back to not-great. He scowled.
A song that shows the wishes of the boys - to have a place where nothing changed, a place that holds only good memories.
Most times, the leader is a man and sometimes he hunts the crone. But then there are accounts where she is the leader and he is her servant. Or she is his servant. Sometimes they are married. Sometimes one of them is an animal or inanimate object.
the squid. We just don't like it to steal our food, you know. Hence the shooing. You would think the house-elves throwing the leftovers of Hogwarts' meal times into the lake for the squid would be enough. But
“It's not! And I didn't feel for that creature at all! And I don't need to have this conversation with you!” Malfoy snapped and Harry wished desperately to be big again so that he could strangle him.
One tea time had turned into several, had turned into a semi-regular thing and was by now an almost weekly occurrence.
A moment later, Mr. Ollivander appeared behind shelves full of stacked wands and approached Draco, stopping just before him, so that the old man was just a bit too close.
Everyone had been happy with the little presents Draco had gotten for them – especially Millicent's eyes had shone at the sight of the framed picture of Howard. The big girl always had had a soft spot for cats.
“I don't have to forgive you to give you professional advice!” hissed Mr. Ollivander, clearly hurt in his pride. “What's the question?”
The closer the arrivers drew, the louder turned the yelling and crashing sounds that made Draco remember very unpleasant scenes from the Manor during its Death Eater headquarters' period.
Even though, watching the newly-weds slow-dance in the middle of the open-air dance floor tugged painfully at his heartstrings somehow. To have someone look at him like that... The sudden, forceful longing was almost palpable and inexplicably his thoughts turned to Potter and his laughter as Draco had spun him around on the stands at the Quidditch pitch all those months ago. Potter was such a bad dancer. Draco swallowed. He would give anything to have the Scarhead tread on his toes about now.
The smartypants put her hand to her heart. “Geez, Kreacher! You scared the hell out of us! Er, hello, how have you been?”
Harry couldn't help but grin. Even though the enclosure around his own ankles was rapidly starting to feel very uncomfortable and this whole situation was less than ideal, the display of a helplessly bent-over Malfoy had its perks... “How long can you hold that pose, Malfoy?” he leered and leant to the side, so he could see the other boy's profile.
“And you just told me, you'd seduced me to curry favour with the public. Draco, really, I never knew you were so insecure.”
With that Potter moved forward and closed the gap between them. His lips met Draco's with the heat of a thousand fires and the world exploded as Draco melted into the kiss. It was better than he could have ever  imagined. Their lips slotted together perfectly as Draco put his arms around Potter's neck to pull him even closer, burying his fingers in those unruly black curls. Potter tasted like toothpaste and sunshine and Draco couldn't help but moan quietly as a hand cupped his cheek; as a thumb travelled down his jaw and tilted his head up to deepen the kiss. Draco combusted from the inside while Potter's left hand on his hip burned a hole into him. Every playful nip, every press of tongue was answered, mirrored, enhanced. They were completing each other.
Her boyfriend looked way less enthusiastic, but agreed nevertheless. “Might not be all too bad, really. After all, it's a bit of a shame no one's using this place anymore and it is your great aunt's old house, so yeah? Why not? I say, go for it.”
It was true. Crushed by guilt, Harry had crept out of bed the night he had attacked Malfoy in Myrtle's bathroom and snuck into the hospital wing to sit at his rival's bed, while holding his hand and looking at his too-pale face. In the morning, he had left and never told anyone.
When they had to break apart for something so utterly unimportant as air, Draco whined, tightening his grip in Harry's hair so that he couldn't move away far.
that the me you see here is only half of who I am. The letter G is connected to my other half somehow, I'm sure. ...and I think, you have met them, this jumper of yours is linked to them, definitely. My heart tells me so.”
“Can't what?” Harry snarled back and tugged more vehemently while simultaneously trying to force Malfoy's hands off. “Would you leave off already?”
Later, while he was dancing with one person or the other, Seeker felt as though he were in a dream and he wondered what the longing deep down in his stomach could mean – the longing to dance with somebody who loved him – and whether he would ever have it. Although, some part of him whispered that maybe once he
He checked the Muggle wristwatch Father Weasley had given him for Christmas. Five minutes to midnight. Now all that was left to do was wait.
. And now it's all a scheme?” He tilted his head up, so he could look Draco in the eye. Their faces were so close now, Harry's lips brushed Draco's cheek with his next words. “I get that you're scared,” (“I'm not scared.”) “but aren't you tired of these games? Draco...” A soft kiss landed next to Draco's ear.
“The Hunt took Potter!” Draco, having come in at a breakneck speed, nearly keeled over in his attempt to stop before crashing into his former professor.
It had taken her only a moment to decipher the words though the meaning didn't quite present itself to her yet.
just find it cute how Potter blushed. Oh and not to forget that ass… But of course, these were all rather infinitesimal things. Not worth dwelling on, really. Ahem.
surprise, it was Hermione who Kreacher had attached himself to next, sobbing some more. “Kreacher is very sorry! Kreacher doesn't know how he could have talked to Miss Hermione that way! Kreacher did not
stones shot past. In fact, there were surprising amounts of bioluminescence now that they had left the squid's cave. The soft light of the pebbles illuminating the floor, were nothing compared to the gently swaying, glowing cloud of white-blue far ahead on their left – or the numerous odd animals that crossed their way: There were fish, of course, like haddocks (fins veined with unusual, silvery brightness) and other normal lake animals like crabs (bluish dots down their back; Draco was reminded of Vincent) but then there were also outlandish sightings like a walrus with green-gleaming teeth, some mice (!) scurrying along the ground with their gills shedding violet light with every breath and... Draco blinked, a mob of–
The shop owner's eyes gleamed. “Oh, great! We have a wide assortment. Let me show you!” He bustled off.
After he had put so much effort into cleaning and rearranging it, Grimmauld Place really did feel like a home now.
“Not an it,” grumbled Malfoy through gritted teeth and halted just below the three creatures on the hilltop, “and I order you to give Potter back to me. Right now.”
Draco's heart fluttered just as Potter's voice wavered. In the oppressive silence, he could hear both their breaths too loud in the little bubble.
He swallowed, holding the opened ring box higher. “You must think I'm insane. We're barely out of our teens and have been dating for less than a year. But I just, Harry, I know I want to wake up next to your mop head in the morning. I want to share the last strawberry. I want to fight about who takes out the trash. I want to watch the sunrise with you. I want to hold your hand. Every day, for the rest of my life. ...do
Momentarily, it looked like they would start hexing each other, but both of their attention was drawn to the shaking girl in their midst who was holding her stomach and trying really hard not to burst into laughter.
What emerged though wasn't a girl at all. Rather it was a mountain of a boy: broad shoulders, thick neck, gorilla-like arms and a flat nose in an expressionless face under a pudding-bowl haircut. He was dressed in nothing but a singed piece of old robes, arranged carelessly around his privates. The most interesting thing about this newest addition to Harry's ever-growing assortment of weirdos though was the sooty skin that was interveined with dimly glowing red veins, making him look like a moving bulk of half-hardened lava. Ember, glowing ashes, of course.
“I guess not.” Harry patted Malfoy's scalp. “For someone with such low opinions on house-elves you sure know how to make them appear in a good light, though.”
“Don't pretend, Malfoy, I know you felt something during that story. Don't forget I'm sitting on your head. You hated that Aoife had to die just because she wasn't like Murcus. See, and that's what I don't get: If you disagree with what happened to those two, you should see that that's the same thing with the blind prejudices against Muggle-borns and others.”
“Of course I don't mind. But–” Potter got up and Draco lost his nerves, when he saw a hand reaching for him in his peripheral vision.
Ronald and Hermione had Apparated next to Draco, missing the edge of the cliff only by mere centimetres. Not that they cared about that. Or about the fact that Potter had been back for what, a minute, and they were already monopolizing him?! Both of them stormed forward and buried their long lost friend in a tight hug.
As days had gone by he had started roaming the streets of Muggle towns, walking along cliffs, wandering cross-country though Britain's landscape. Hours and hours.
Potter doing all the time?” Pansy shook her head and exhaled deliberately. “That doesn't help us though. Gee, I wish I had a cup of tea now, a really strong one, to get the gears going.” She cocked her head, a nasty smile slowly curling her lips. “
Hence, basically falling in love with the old abandoned Black house came as much as a shock as it was welcome. As was Kreacher essentially acknowledging Draco as his master by following his orders and therefore making him someone permitted to live at Grimmauld Place.
So? Hadn't there been an argument somewhere in that? “Wha-what about the others? People will not like us together. They'll say I hexed you.” Draco was grasping for straws now, not even sure anymore, as to why he was fighting at all, as Harry's lips were barely touching his, the tension unbearable.
“You're an idiot.” The insult was spoken very gently. “It doesn't need words for an apology. You saved my life and you saved my freedom and every day you come here and don't treat me like a leper, you save my sanity. Look, Potter, I was angry at you back then. Of course I was. But I was also drowning in my own fear.” He lightly squeezed Harry's fingers. “I don't think I would have survived that night in the hospital wing if you hadn't been there, comforting me.”
She then turned around to look at her home one last time, before directing her gaze to the infant in her arms. A melancholic smile danced on her lips as she kissed her baby, then laid it down into the snow.
Draco shot him a sharp look. “Or maybe you just find me attractive, which is understandable but highly unlikely. Anyway – the point is: This,” he gestured between them, “is not happening.”
There was only a split-second of hesitation, then Harry was pulled up, mischief glinting in Malfoy's eyes.
“You're not much of a drinker, are you?” Half had come over and offered him a hand up, which Seeker took thankfully.
For a moment, Half looked guilty, but the sentiment quickly disappeared. “We drank a bit. But aside from your headache, everything will be fine.” His smile had a touch of something darker to it that Seeker couldn't quite place. “It's all going to be okay.”
Same as Nott who now jerked his head towards the noise. “Blaise went in.” He bit his lip. “It's really bad today.”
“But you don't remember anything, do you? How do you know you're not dead, hm?” Half's condescendingly soothing tone enraged Harry even further.
Still, Seeker cocked his head, pondering. “Okay. But here's something that doesn't quite add up. I think I never told you this but actually, Holle's Pond is a Somewhen Thing for me. How can that be if it means certain death and I'm still alive?”
“It should be around here.” Hermione let her hand wander over the mural, not caring that her fingers hovered eerily in mid-air. No one was close-by to see them.
“Your tea, Master Harry,” said Kreacher when Harry entered the kitchen and handed him the atrocious mug Luna had got him for his birthday last week: It showed a very blurry snapshot of a DA meeting back in fifth year, Harry was pretty sure Colin had taken.
“Just a little test run for a new product: Unicorn Powder.” George grinned and winked at her. “Makes you see only happy, fluffy things for a minute or two.” It was nice to see him smile again. He had been moody lately, for understandable reasons.
Draco flinched ever so slightly. While he was alright with not-talking about all things war-related, he wasn't particularly interested in discussing Potter's (lack of) love life. Too vivid was the memory of that day some weeks back when Potter had arrived with an explosive mood, being snappy and insufferable until he had finally roped Draco into a fist fight after provoking him on purpose. All of which had ended in a highly uncomfortable Draco with an armful of Potter.
Harry blushed. Heart's name, indeed. Maybe he should go back to bed after all... well, only one more page?
There had been talk about research. Harry's curiosity was too strong to resist a peek, so with a regretful glance at the closed bedroom door, Harry slipped into the library instead.
And while Draco's eardrums seemed to burst in the onslaught of clamour, he could faintly hear an underlying tune:
The kiss, first almost chaste but quickly passionate, went on and on, while BraveHeart had an attack of giggles, Ember goggled and Seeker wondered whether someone had hit him on the head unnoticed. Half and Wolfe were bickering more often than not, when did
In the high-ceilinged room, that was as  big as the Great Hall above, house-elves, teachers, Patchers and (as Draco suspected) even a few students, were loudly celebrating.
At the following reception (which had included even the new-born Weasley of Bill and Fleur's), Draco had danced with Harry, the way he'd wished at the actual wedding, and Harry had dutifully stepped on Draco's toes in the process. It had been terribly romantic and Draco hadn't minded his hurting feet one bit.
Miraculously, Malfoy followed the topic change. “I've never carried you around as much as tonight, either. Besides,” he reached up, hovered his hand for a moment to give the tiny Malfoy-rider time to see the movement and then blindly sort-of-patted Harry's head, “they are not left to die in the Mell. Did you not listen to them? They said it themselves: The Upsters, that is, the other house-elves, are taking care of them by providing them food. Pretty good one, too, if I'd ask you – aren't you so very keen on treacle tart?”
I am holding your hand.” He doubled over, gasping for air in his hysteria. “If this is not a dream I don't know any.”
It takes a brilliant mind to have brilliant ideas. I call myself very lucky to have been graced with the fortune of having met a person possessing such a mind.
The hand with the brush paused mid-air and BraveHeart glanced at Seeker, then quickly looked away. “I rather see than be seen; even though it doesn't seem like it with me being constantly so loud,” he mumbled under his breath. “Not very brave at all, I know. But I... I can't really explain it, but I feel like I need to hide because there are bad people out there who want to hurt me for I'm not how they want me to be.” He gave a humourless laugh. “Yes, I'm aware that's not the case, but it's still... I can't just turn it off. I feel like this might have something to do with my life, when I still lived, you know? Anyway, this,” he touched his own landscape-mask, “is my protection.”
Biting his lips, he hesitated only for a moment, before he spoke the secret word to wake up his portrait: “Mimblewimble.” (Uncle Vernon would have a fit would he know Harry used his ramblings back from the hut on the rock to do magic. The thought filled Harry with glee.)
“The fishermen from Aoife's village wanted to marry her off to one of them. She said no and when they pressured her, she told them she already had a lover from the sea.”
“Potter!” Draco hissed scandalized and yet couldn't tear his eyes away from the well-toned amount of bare skin on display. “What do you think you're doing here?” And
“Hermione is right.” The wild-looking Weasley straight ahead, whose jumper was decorated with a fire-spewing dragon, ignored the Weasel's comment and looked expectantly at Draco. “Start from the beginning. Who was abducted? Where? When? Why? And, maybe most importantly, by whom?”
Draco wrecked his brain, trying frantically to come up with something. His eyes were on the dark-haired rider who seemed to be staring back at him with the same level of intense desperation, his lips moving inaudibly.
“I could just throw you out, you know,” warned Draco and felt carefully on his head for Potter, who promptly– “Shit! Did you just
Seeker shrugged. What did it matter? After all, for all they knew, they had eternity to talk about this. “Anyone up for a round of ninepins?”
So they'd buried the truth between the two of them. So that the families of the dead would have the time to grief and let go; the way they needed it.
“That's rich coming from someone who just declared I was unable to have ideas of my own,” Weasley grit out.
“Alright, alright. I... it just hurts to talk about it. Look,” Mr. Withane reached for a framed picture on the windowsill, “this is... was my wife. She died giving birth to our daughter. When she left, it felt like she took a piece of my heart with her.” He swallowed and Draco found himself mirroring the movement. It was as if this stranger said Draco's most secret thoughts about Potter out loud. “I thought I would die, too. Of broken heart. Yet I knew I had to be strong for our baby girl. I tried so hard to be a good father. I still do, but I'm sure now, the
Harry glanced back at the images (Harry staring at Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson dancing at the Yule Ball.) and then at Malfoy's hair floating around his head like a halo. “Can you do a Cushioning Charm?”
What was it with them that they couldn't even remember Potter's stupid name for five minutes? Potter, Potter. Wasn't so hard now, was it?
Forth they went to the moss folk clearing where they were greeted by unearthly music and floating lights and laughter. Hunt people and moss folk alike were moving to the melody. Above them all, the snowflakes were dancing at their own pace, swirling, so fragile as they floated through the midnight air, reflecting a thousand shimmers onto the spirit dancers.
Draco stiffened. All of Thomas' posture screamed antagonism, from his crossed arms to his deadly glare. That was more what Draco had expected.
Weasley looked a bit dazed, as if shaken from a dream. He turned to Granger, eyebrows drawn up in question.
And really, I think, by writing it all down once more, I could get it out of my head. I had The Hunt hunting my thoughts for half a year ^^°
Even BraveHeart had ventured (“Berchthold's word is final, so...”), but Harry hadn't wanted to hear any of it.
“Yeah, I'm back in my life and this is Draco who I told you so much about. We're together now. All is well.” Harry felt his face split into a happy smile. It was true, all was well indeed.
Draco already lost Potter today, he could not stand to lose face as well. Especially not in front of
Harry had half a mind to inquire about the 'powers that be' but eventually decided against it. Sometimes it was best not to ask questions you weren't prepared to hear the answer to. Draco seemed to think alike, as he opened and closed his mouth several times, without words coming out.
Names have power. That is old wisdom. Therefore here a list of names of the protagonists. Most names are rather self-explanatory, I think, but some might not have been so obvious.
The inhabitants of this region had learnt to keep both doors open though, for the ghost procession to travel through harmlessly. Or so the owner of the barn claimed, because all Draco and company had found were fields and hay and not a single sign of supernatural shenanigans, the hunting kind or otherwise.
Yet there was something he wanted to ask first, before he lost himself in the pleasure of kissing Draco (which indeed, could just become his new favourite thing).
“I was, I am,” squeaked the addressee and hid her face behind her hands. “I forgot to send a replacement. Oh, Ada, do you hear the magical warning drums? The squid is close.”
He counted quietly under his breath and they raised their wands simultaneously to cast the Rearrangement Spell. This time it worked and the bricks that had lain strewn across the frost covered grass floated into the air to re-form the southern outer wall of Hogwarts Castle they once had been.
Basically the story extends over a period of three years: intermezzo year, research year, epilogue year.
Self-blame wouldn't bring Dumbledore back and it would not repair Harry's damaged self-confidence. Sometimes, starting fresh helped solving a problem. Like this numerical chart right here.
“What did he do now?” Draco asked, inwardly sighing. He would not be able to finish gift wrapping in time.
Malfoy snatched at the cup with both hands, his right trying to pry Harry's fingers off while his left curled around the second handle. “Why would you drink that?!”
The moment he landed, a whole world of memories came flooding back. The fights, the longing, the everything.
For a moment it seemed as if Mr. Withane was going to shut the door in their faces, but then he opened it wider and moved back a bit. “Come in.”
“I'll just have to make him then, right? After all, I'm not chasing storms all around the globe to come up empty-handed. I'll drag him back with me even if he's kicking and screaming. Yeah. Just you wait and see, I'll bring him next time, that's a promise.”
“All sorted out,” Thomas told them and snatched the glass out of Finnigan's grip, handing it to Draco. “Now, cheers!”
“Then we would have gone with Plan A and hoped Master Harry would find his own way out of  The Hunt – or realise his place was with it. Whichever seemed more fitting. But truly, we like the happy ending better. Good thing our meddling helped.” Death grinned and Holle flapped her wings in approval.
“Still... He was kinda... possessive, wasn't he?” Potter fidgeted and Draco purposefully stayed silent.
done this a few times already and Draco was impressed by the others' resilience, especially since he was sure that by now both of them had completely forgotten about the original reason for starting the research: Potter.
“Are you sure about this?” Harry hissed, a side glance at the Muggles. “That the Swedish Ministry of Magic is lenient regarding violations of the Statute of Secrecy?”
are almost corporeal memories of the soul's owner which act according to the owner's wishes, but mostly independently.”
Really, that person. Harry rolled his eyes. “Back to square one then. At least we know what doesn't work. That's something.”
"...no." It was true. With Potter, Draco felt good, whole, in a way he hadn't for a really long time.
He smiled down at the serpent, feeling suddenly chipper and full of energy. “Just you wait and see, I'll bring him next time, that's a promise.” His grin widened. “Thanks for the talk. You're not a bad listener.”
“Thanks,” he mumbled, sipping the scalding hot beverage while the little moving people in the photograph on the porcelain scrambled out of the way to not be under his lips. “How about you go back to bed? I won't be back before dinnertime, I think.”
What had just happened? Had Berchthold really just magicked this yelling man into a dog for his pack?
“Now, why was it again we were looking for this... person?” Headmistress McGonagall pushed her square glasses up her nose and Draco suppressed a frustrated groan.
Harry jogged over to where Malfoy was angrily poking the (very good) imitation of an exit with his wand, shouting: “
It was a sunny afternoon in autumn. Bell chimes were floating in the air and Harry watched the black crowd in the distance. He smiled. All their friends and family had come, all their loved ones. His gaze caressed the familiar features and finally stopped on the ones he cherished the most: Hermione's wrinkly face and Ron, still freckled under his retreating white hair.
“Oh, our little raven is also the goddess of crossroads,” Death smirked. “That's why we, Master Harry” (“Not your master anymore!”) “met at King's
“Someone with manners and... other skills,” offered the alternative Harry and smirked at Malfoy, who pulled a face and proceeded to watch the autumn leaves fall over the newcomer's shoulder.
Harry could feel Malfoy's chest rise and fall with each breath, the blond hair tickling his neck where the Slytherin's head rested on his shoulder. It was surreal to have this kind of conversation in such an intimate setting as theirs.
“I can look on my own,” Draco yelled after him, but the redhead only shouted back over his shoulder: “It's VIFF service!”
“To me then?” Tall, broad Cassius Warrington, Slytherin Chaser in his last year, flexed his biceps and gave Ron a challenging look.
Ember didn't seem fazed and simply re-positioned baby Dreamer in one massive, sooty arm. “You can't. The Hunt goes forward, never back.”
No sound from the other boy. Maybe he had left, never to return again, never to talk to Harry again...
Draco had spent the second half of the year globetrotting after every tiny hint. That and his other activities had resulted in him having a full schedule and putting off Christmas shopping until the very last minute.
Potter, apparently sensing potential conflict, quickly cut in: “So if we ride your underwater-horses, could we also ride with The Hunt?”
“No!” The echo was another house-elf. It was clad in a worn-out shoe box, with only its arms and legs sticking out through crude holes in the paper.
know?” The betrayal hurt more than any of the punches Half had gotten in. Seeker's heart turned black. “I thought you were my friends,” he said bitterly. “To hell with you all. I'm out of here.”
The day had turned into evening and from somewhere on the mantelpiece of the gently crackling fireplace in Grimmauld Place' library it chimed 8 o'clock on Boxing Day.
Then some part of  what had been said caught up with him. Hadn't Half explained that Holle only called the dogs when there was prey? They were over an ocean. What kind of prey could there be found here?
Draco made up his mind. He should've come here earlier, but he had put it off because of the prisoner-holding incident at the Manor. Now though, he had the feeling that he was slowly running out of time.
“You are both going to have some,” the merchieftainess insisted and her knee-weakening gaze pierced Draco. “For your own good. I am older than you, and must know better.”
“Yes. It's all taken care of,” Harry mumbled, then added a tad louder. “And don't scold me for being late, you old git! I want to see you do all that in less than seven days!”
He was greeted by Harry's brilliant smile. “I guess I just wanted your attention for a little longer.” Harry's knuckles touched Draco's cheek as he ran a thumb over the latter's cheek bone. “Sometimes I'm getting a bit jealous having to share you with all our friends, you know.”
“May I?” Hermione didn't wait for an answer and was already casting a simple clean-up spell that left the room in a neater condition. Then she ignited the fireplace and sat down on the 'guest couch' as Draco had dubbed it, a three seater on the left side of the room.
up than listen to his seemingly crazy story about a visitation from a nursery rhyme stealing away a man no one was able to remember. Also, it was Christmas Day and most likely everyone was at home with their families.
. So, why not? Harry reached for the handle with his right hand and took a long sip of what tasted like weak tea with cream in it. Not bad. He downed the whole cup in one go.
Draco had no time to dodge and the fist hit him hard in the stomach, making him double over in pain. Above him Thomas breathed heavily, looking like he would love to murder Draco.
“I mean... have you really thought that through? An ex-Death Eater at your wedding, are you sure?” Draco didn't try to get out of it. In fact he was rather touched and excited, already planning wedding gifts in the back of his mind. But he was also realistic and he didn't want to ruin their day.
Frustrated, Harry threw his hands in the air. Gone was the amiable mood from just a few minutes ago. “Do you even hear yourself? Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself. When
. Of course, as a Patcher, Draco was working hard, but he usually didn't get much recognition for his patches, so this was nice.
Mabel gestured at him. “Just go with it. It's what we do when our mood is too sad. We can't have the lake grow much bigger, you see. So we have to distract ourselves when the tribe as whole feels like crying. And mother's stories often make us tear up. But they
Pansy was already marching up the path to the front door, so he had to jog to catch up with her. “What's with Gregory?”
“So, what are you doing here, today of all days?” Longbottom inquired, dangling from his arm a red women's handbag out of which peeked a toad.
Obviously because Draco chases the winter storms of The Wild Hunt, but also because Harry (subconsciously) chases the storm-grey of Draco's eyes.
“Woah, you got an invitation! How cool! Can I come with? Please? Please, please, pleassseeee?” BraveHeart's shoulder was pressing hard into Seeker as the smaller boy tiptoed to get a better look at the... 'invitation'?
“Ah.” Draco could hear the smile even in this one syllable. “I said:,” Harry lifted his head, so they were eye in eye, “'Call my name'. And you did, sort of.”
Draped over the side of the bathtub, Harry found his dirty clothes and other belongings that he had simply left there after his shower earlier. He would probably throw them out, but not before quickly retrieving his wand from the heap. This one he still needed.
Draco yawned, stretched his arms over his head and rolled over on his back. That wasn't hard to do since for some time now all three of them had been lying prone on the fluffy rug. At first Draco had vehemently refused and widely sneered at such a behaviour, yet after a while he found that it was more comfortable to join the Golden Couple on the floor and also more convenient when they were exchanging books, scrolls and hand-written parchments back and forth over a single bottle of ink in the middle of their circle, three quills dipped in.
As if the cry had been a sign, the weather changed with such sudden force that Harry had to cling to Lightning for dear life: The wind, just a breeze before, had now picked up, transforming into strong gusts. The forecasted lightning buzzed and thunder clapped around them, leaving an electric sort of taste in the air and Harry half-deaf. It started snowing and hailing in equal parts and a fog thick as pea soup materialised with breakneck speed over the water.
I guess. Partly due to your imagination and partly due to hers.” His grin widened. “In reverse that means she's weak in the middle of the road, which is why Draco would have been safe from The Hunt when we met him in front of the barn, even if he hadn't been part of our 'project'.”
“You have no idea how many times I've looked at these lines this past year, wondering what they meant. Now that I remember their origin as a pink toad-y woman, I could do without them again. But when I was riding with The Hunt, I used to imagine I carved them in to remind myself to be true and brave. That's what I want to stick with – being brave and not lying about how I feel about you.”
He halted at Lavender's cross in the first line to conjure a bouquet of daffodils (a trick he had Hermione teach him before her travels). Ron had told him that those had been Lavender's favourite. He laid them down next to a picture that showed young Lavender with her pet rabbit Binky in third year.
Everyone had been surprised when Seeker had switched to Team Jolly Roger in the first game. But he had just grinned when they had asked him and had told them that he had seen a cool tattoo on his trip to the outside world which had made him change his mind about the skull design.
Draco squinted upwards, but all he could see was his own mussed-up fringe. “Bit more wouldn't hurt, Potter.”
Because what would we be without help? Woebegone, that's what. Therefore, upmost thanks to my grand beta
Malfoy stared. Then he let out a long breath of disbelief. “Potter. Why are suddenly the size of your brain?”
“I have a name. My name is Harry. Here, it's even written on my jumper.” And with that Harry opened his robes to show the embroidery on his chest. BraveHeart whistled appreciatively and Wolfe made an ooh-sound.
The top of their air-bubble had forcefully hit something solid. Turned out, there was a wall after all.
It was only then that Harry realised that he understood every word although the yeller (and the deceased as well) was clearly speaking Swedish. Curious, must be Hunt magic.
“Not a joke!” Granger squeaked. “We just assumed. Since that is what happened to our friend... Parfay?” (“Potter.”) “And we thought it might be the same for you.”
“Hey, you, do you go here?” Malfoy had leant forward to better see the girl. “You look awfully young.”
“It's a draw! Maybe we can make it a duel next time, at Midnight!” Harry laughed, but something tucked at the back of his mind at these words. Midnight duel, there was something. Something...
“Alright, alright. I'm going,” sniggered Harry, trying to steal a kiss in passing which earned him a glare from Draco. “You could come with though?”
think it would be best if we all took turns,” Wolfe interjected from her horse Binky's left side. She smiled at Ember. “You're one of us, we should all share."
Harry was very aware that his face had turned bright red. That bastard had worded it like that on purpose. He sniffed. “Can't. Too narrow.”
Draco felt relief flooding his body, but he quickly dampened it down. “I didn't ask for your approval, Weasel, but I'll take it into account that you acquiesce,” he sniffed.
Finally the epilogue holds a whole year after the night Harry returned, from January to New Year's Eve.
Even from afar, Harry could tell he was a gigantic man, sitting on a gigantic eight-legged pale white horse. Berchthold, leader of The Wild Hunt, wearing a green hunting attire, was enveloped in an ever-moving storm cloud that lay on his shoulders like a cloak and similar to Holle, he had an iron chain wound around his hips. He, too, was sprouting horns from his head, though in his case they were rather impressive antlers. Most prominent feature however was the red and black half-mask that covered the right side of his face contrasting sharply with his fair skin.
Harry rolled his eyes at that. “Would you stop fighting me on this? You like me. I like you.  What's the problem now?”
which means hell and would fit the Mother Holle fairy tale where the Marys fall down into Holle's realm. But only recently I found out that Holle actually used to be the German adjective
“Speaking of house-elves, that's actually a good thought.” Harry eyed Malfoy warily, before he called loudly: “DOBBY!”
Taken by surprise, BraveHeart hesitated, then pulled the mask off and handed it to Harry. For a moment, he looked small and uncertain, but then he smiled as if a burden had been lifted off his shoulders. “Thank you.”
was under the tree! I looked first thing when I got up and there it was and I know he's slow sometimes, but
“The heart's a weird thing,” he told Howard who had just wandered into the kitchen and was now eyeing his half-empty food bowl with a critical stare.
“Yes.” Her face turned matter-of-fact as she got up and motioned Draco to follow her over to a little Muggle contraption on the sideboard. She seemingly broke off a piece (gasp!) and offered it to Draco.
When The Hunt had first arrived at this forest, Seeker had been very startled by the little child-like creatures whose whole bodies were covered in moss. Some of them looked old, some ugly but others were almost pretty and all of them had a human flair somehow.
Having Aunt Andromeda tell Draco so much about her little family made him always sad and angry about the missed opportunity to get to know them. Now he never would.
Draco waved his wand to clean himself up, grabbed onto the owl and Apparated right into the Golden Couple's kitchen.
“Shut your mouth!” Parkinson gritted out and made a threatening move towards Ron and Hermione. “Another twenty points from Gryffindor for insulting a prefect, Weasley! No, actually, might be best we just take you straight to the headmistress.”
It was entertaining to see Death in all his glory looking taken aback and floundering about. “Ah, er, right, such a chain of events. How curious.”
Their noise woke up Ember and he growled something about 'idiot couples' as he rolled over to sleep some more only to be shaken and forced to look at his sketch by an overzealous BraveHeart.
As if reading his mind, Potter declared: “Well, it's late. I slept on the frozen ground for a year, I can sleep on the couch for now.”
For now though... Draco sat down again and searched in the top drawer of his desk until his hand touched a little notebook. It was a pretty, gold-adorned piece. He'd never had any use for it. But now it was exactly what he needed.
He plopped out of existence before anyone could reply and was back within a wink, carrying an old worn notebook.
“Sorry, it's just – weasels and ferrets are actually distant relatives in the animal kingdom,” Granger giggled.
Between his vibrant and vivid companions, the soot boy was like a cloud of darkness that absorbed the surrounding light. Harry shifted as far away as possible. Ember made him uneasy.
Draco found his eyes darting this way and that. He couldn't look at Potter. Shit. This was definitely not the way Draco had imagined confessing. In fact, he had not planned on ever saying anything about that at all.
As if on cue, the front door was heard and a cheerful voice floated through the house. “Ron! Draco!”
“We don't have anything like that, I'm afraid. Libraries are more of a family matter. Like, all pure-blood families have private libraries at home and then obviously there is Hogwarts,” Draco elucidated.
What else could Draco have done than to say yes, but deep down he'd known that he would always be queasy about Harry going back to visit The Hunt.
longer than I had anticipated ^^°  In retrospective, it would have been better to split this one into two, but in my defence, when I wrote down my plot outline for this chapter, it had exactly one bullet point. Things just kinda happened from there on. Anyhow, now you get one chapter with the length of two!
“And some sandwiches while you're at it?” added Cassius. “Pansy and I didn't really have time to eat today, with being in the hospital wing and all.”
Indeed was a number of Hogwarts ghosts apparently playing some sort of loud game in the far corner of the stone-walled hall. It looked like charades.
“Indeed,” concurred Wolfe, grinning broadly, “and based on that, we shall henceforth call you Seeker.”
To their left, the whole wall was plastered with paintings of leporine animals, surrounding a Gobelin with sleeping bunnies on it, right next to an ancient-looking grandfather clock that had partly been built into the wall.
Around midnight, the mood was rumbustious. An impromptu band had formed at the end of the hall by the large brick fireplace and Lovegood and Finnigan were dancing barefoot on the table to the tune of
you bring us to your village? I thought you said you knew a way into Hogwarts that doesn't endanger us to be snatched by the mysterious 'Wild Hunt'.” He used water quotes.
Grinning, Harry took Draco's hand and pulled him away, Wolfe and BraveHeart leading the way back to the fire of the gang.
Harry thoughtfully observed as the giant went to lay down beneath a single oak tree at Holle's Pond's edge. The tree looked just as much out of place as the man.
The little family made its way through the masses and reached Potter who seemed to be busy shaking hands while simultaneously... receiving gifts? Typical. Draco's life was on the brink of doom and Potter celebrated his own greatness.
Draco nearly tripped. Potter couldn't possibly mean.... or could he...? Okay, gamble. "Yeah, actually just made some today."
Granger sighed heavily. “Boys, really, we had that in class! Or I mean, parts of it. But it makes sense: Thestrals are ghost horses which left The Hunt for one reason or another. That's why they are connected to death and misfortune in people's minds. Same goes for Grims; they are ghost dogs that defected from The Hunt. What do you gather?”
While Draco treated Kreacher nicer than he had ever treated any house-elf, because Draco tried to turn over a new leaf, he secretly thought that rights for house-elves were nonsense (they liked serving, so what?). But he had taken to following Weasley's lead whenever Granger started S.P.E.W.ing and silently nodded along to her ramblings. He had even joined, albeit rather reluctantly and only because he knew that Granger could get any job she wanted, yet she had chosen to be without one for the time being to assist her parents, do S.P.E.W. things and last but not least, help him look for Potter.
Life rolled her eyes. “Not what you think, you heathens. Gosh. We,” her finger whipped back and forth between Death and her, “are
However, when Death set foot on the clearing, the clamour died down. Everyone turned their attention to Harry and they made way when he walked by.
Draco's heart skipped and then he grinned widely. “Is that so? Well, I don't want to seem greedy. You can pay for the wedding.”
“Should we go to The Burrow, then? They are so worried. We all got our memories back at the same time and of course, everyone wanted to come right away, but we didn't know what condition you would be in, so Ron and I came first, but now that you're alright – you
Sighing, Helga picked up the discarded item and dusted it off, then hung it next to the others. So what if she liked designing funny hats? One was never too old for fashionable headwear!
The effect was almost immediate: His shins stopped hurting, his brain cleared up the fuzziness and his tired muscles ceased aching.
Gently prying Teddy's hand off, Harry looked at him with a smile that wrinkled his old face in a thousand little ways. “To the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.” Teddy crumbled at that and Harry pulled the now sobbing man into a tender embrace. “And I'm not dying, I'm just... moving on.” He kissed his godson on the forehead. “Farewell, Teddy.”
Seeker shivered. As far as he could tell it was way past midnight but hours till sunrise. He shuffled closer to BraveHeart; it was chilly, even for Hunt standards, as it was snowing softly.
“Ha! I wish. No, that was because, er, I mean...” Harry suddenly felt a blush creeping up his face. Why would he confess something so embarrassing to Malfoy? Well, in for a penny. “I didn't really feel like dancing,” he finished lamely.
. Was that even imaginable? Yet, here Draco was at the receiving end of the oddest gaze by someone who should know Potter better than most people in this castle.
“A strong black tea maybe, if you don't mind.” Harry yawned. “I don't think I can sleep anymore. I'll go to Hogwarts, see if I can get some repairs done before Auror training later.”
“Oh hurry, Seeker, hurry! The Hunt is leaving!” BraveHeart's horse pranced nervously on the spot. “If we miss the connection, we'll be doomed. Come
Seeker nodded. Just another of the many unsolved mysteries of The Hunt. That didn't faze him anymore.
“I don't think we have time for chit-chat, Neville dear. Let's go, shall we?” The strident voice of Mrs. Longbottom cut through the air like a knife.
Hesitantly, the redhead took the quill from her hand and after one last wary glance, signed the parchment as well.
Draco nodded stiffly. Everyone looked at him expectantly now, so he eyed warily the thing she'd given him.
Draco fiddled with the hem of his sleeve. “I know it’s not ideal – with everything that went down there, but I thought maybe you would want to open a library in the Manor. A public wizarding library, modelled on the Muggle ones. I thought if anyone could pull it off it would be you, Gra– Hermione.”
“That, that is a stupid idea,” squeaked Draco and tried to push past the former Gryffindor, but the latter put his right arm up to block Draco's way and leant closer.
“Okay, that's all for now.” Weasley's voice had an edge to it that made Draco look up. The redhead had been fidgety all afternoon and kept glancing at the door.
“Nowhere. I don't know. I... it was last year, right after midnight, when I found you and everyday since, whether we fight or embrace, everyday has been a gift. I feel very lucky.”
Just then, a white dog, its red ears flapping, slid next to Lightning. Its fur looked fluffy, so Harry moved to touch it.
is most certainly not. I've lived with house-elves all my life – their magic doesn't look like that. This is something else.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath himself. This was going to be a disaster. Seriously, like the worst idea ever.
“Friend of Thomas'. I managed to find her. Am good at that,” Draco replied, words wobbling slightly. He, too, was still in a bit of shock. Understandably.
Yes, quite. Especially since the personae of the leader of The Hunt and the crone often intertwine, overlap or trade places.
Malfoy sneer. “Heh~ Your precious Dumbledore isn't such a saint as you presumed him to be, eh? Must be devastating. Aw, poor Potty.”
“It's no use. This table has some sort of spell-repellent or whatnot on it. Nothing works.” Frustrated, Harry threw his wand onto the tablecloth and growled at it. This was starting to feel like a crazy version of the mad tea party from Alice in Wonderland. At least Alice would have an idea.
Harry scanned the crowd once more, this time with purpose. He was about to settle on 'non-attendance' when he finally caught a glimpse of blond in the furthermost corner of the Great Hall, right next to the portal. Malfoy was leaning in a niche, half-hidden by Hogwarts' banners. His arms were crossed over his immaculate dress robes and he was listening intently with a grim expression.
Draco's heart sank a bit. Grimmauld Place was Potter's house. Draco had forgotten about it. Of course, he would have to move out immediately... He straightened his back. Draco would gladly live on the street if that meant Potter was back.
He fumbled his way to the fringe of the party and finally let out a breath when he squeezed out in between dancing figures, finding himself at last alone-ish at the bank of an almost circular pond, glowing in the same light as his laurels and Snowdrop. Here, close to the midnight blue water, the noises seemed to have moved away a bit. Only soft chimes of bells (which oddly enough seemed to be coming from inside the pond) were heard now and made room for fresh winter air to fill his lungs and thoughts his head. Harry eyed his surroundings. He saw snowy mountains encircling the water in a wide round on all sides. There were no visible paths that could have led out of the dale.
“What did you do to them?” Hermione suspiciously eyed the out-of-order press people over her shoulder.
Draco gave up on trying to provide for their advancement and let his feet dangle. Now, they soared over a strange, dark, foggy landscape with forests of rippling, tangled black weed.
“These are the same symbols as on the scroll we retrieved from the assumed entry,” Weasley pronounced excitedly and fumbled for their loot to place the two parchments next to each other.
Harry's stomach did a weird little flip when his brain provided unsolicitedly an interpretation of those words: my Potter. Again. Malfoy'd insinuated it
“Er...” Hermione blushed crimson and Draco, remembering her and Ronald's make-up session after their Christmas fight, swiftly changed course and sat instead in the love seat across the witch and the fire.
Draco looked slightly ill as his lips formed the words 'call back' and she rolled her eyes: "Alright, I'll show you." She checked her watch. “We are one hour back, so it should be alright to call now, don't you think? That suits me fine, I still have some S.P.E.W. stuff to do later on.”
Not a chance. Under no circumstances would he eat an unknown food forced upon him by wild animals. Nuh-uh. He'd rather keep his pain, thanks a lot.
“At least according to Ronald. They always bodged up your name while you were gone, couldn't keep it and all. So you had the funniest nicknames. But 'Princess Potter' definitely has a nice ring to it. Maybe I'll keep that one for you?”
It started with a hum in the air, then suddenly there was a deafening thunderclap and in the distance a cloud appeared over the waters. In it Draco could make out dozens and dozens of people of all ages –  many on horseback, many afoot, some dressed in strange costumes, some almost naked –, accompanied by flocks of dogs, pigs, seafowl and owls. Straining his eyes against the increasing onslaught of snowflakes and hail, Draco saw the leader: a single tall rider on a white horse accompanied by a flying woman.
“It wouldn't help you anyway. Out there, in the world of the living, no one even knows you exist and you can't tell strangers because... You must have realised it on your trip: People can see us only during Yuletide since that is the time between years – one year ends, a new one begins – a crossroad of sorts. That's when Perchta's powers are strongest and between her and Berchthold they can make us all visible. But only then. Now, we are nothing but shadows, protected by the barriers of Hunt magic.”
“Mhm, I'd rather you took something off then put more on, but I guess that'll have to wait until after.” Harry grinned and strolled back to the bedroom, leaving a flustered Draco standing in the library.
His eyes moved on to Colin who was barely in the photography as he'd been the one to take it selfie-style. Only half of his face was seen, sleeping in the upper corner of the mug, while drooling down the side. It was ironic how small Colin was the biggest in the shot now, because of perspective. Harry smiled. Actually, Colin had always been a giant, in his heart.
He dipped his quill into the ink bottle, hovered over the first page for a moment and then started writing:
There was nothing he wanted less at the moment than to go back in there and make a fool of himself on the dance floor while everyone was watching him.
Drying his tears with the back of his hand, Harry snivelled. “That's great, thanks, but what if I hadn't healed? I mean, I nearly died anyway.” Draco sharply inhaled and Harry quickly cleared his throat to mask the sound. “My Hunt bracelet was almost red. Oh, by the way, now that I got my memories back I guess that the initial red knot was there because I've already been dead once, rather than for having a death wish?” Death nodded. “Right. But before I left The Hunt, there had only been one white knot left to go and if I understood that correctly, then all red would have meant I would have died. So...?”
“Here, let me hold Teddy for a while,” said Aunt Andromeda at his side as the dance ended. “Why don't you go and give them your present, dear.”
His gaze jumped between the receding crone and the group of late Hogwarts students. He wanted to look at them, just a moment longer, but he also had to find a baby in the babel of riders
And of course there were the Sundays he still used for actual patching at Hogwarts, on top of the bi-weekly Friday Slytherin get-together and his visiting-Greg trips to St. Mungo's on Mondays.
“Right. Also not testy,” remarked Harry snidely, before lowering his voice even more. “If it's because of the jumpers–”
Planting the yellowed pages in the middle of the table, they all leant over the ancient scribbles. Next to a recipe for pumpkin pastry (in Old English but that was no problem for Pansy, she was fluent in several languages, obviously) there was a whole section of doodles depicting millinery and in one corner–
“Come back, Scarhead!” Draco cried – and just like that, everything clicked into place. It just felt right.
Maybe it wasn't entirely terrible holding Potter like this. Not that Draco would ever say that out loud, although their closeness wasn't that unusual nowadays: After all, since that sunrise at the memorial site in August, Potter's casual touches had been rather frequent. No sense of personal space, that guy. But... they weren't
“Besides on Hermione's night stand? Ouch!” Weasley had got elbowed by an irritated Granger. “History section, ten rows down that way, near the door.”
Half grinned humourlessly. “It's really easy: Don't fall down!” He mounted Gee which had, Harry doubled back, six legs. Okay.
. He turned back to His Majesty. “Okay, har har, you had your fun. Now make me right-sized again so we can get that duel over with.”
“Yes, yes, rub it in, Weasel. I'm getting married almost as young as you after making fun of you. Go ahead, laugh all you want,” Draco had granted generously.
“Well-meant is the opposite of well-done,” Harry grumbled darkly and fumbled with his rumpled dress robes.
The girl giggled following Harry's gaze. She petted the horse. “This is Binky,” her fingertips brushed over her face absent-mindedly, eyes hardening, “and I'm Wolfe.”
Upending his arm-chair and launching over the table, Malfoy had grabbed little Harry. The Slytherin quickly backed away, till he hit the wall behind them.
“What did we say? Don't run on ahead!” A man pushing a pram had huffed up the little hill they were currently standing on.
Harry however was momentarily distracted as Alice had unprompted started singing very loudly and out of tune:
“Let me see. It must have been in the founders' chapter somewhere...” Granger had already buried her nosy nose in one of the volumes.
“Oh,” Mr. Weasley's eyebrows shot up when he assessed 'the guest' hovering in the doorway. They climbed even higher when the Weasel and his puffy-eyed sister pushed past Draco. “Er...”
Blood-shot eyes had blinked at Draco. “Kreacher meant that it has been weird to have two sets of memories and not knowing which one was real. But all of Master Harry's things had vanished and Kreacher thought Kreacher'd gone mad from solitude and imagined it all. Kreacher wasn't sure whether Miss Hermione had
Seeker and his team mate made it into the hollow tree by a hair. Squeezed together uncomfortably, they both gasped for air. Meanwhile, Ember unable to 'capture' them as they were in a safe zone swore colourfully and stomped his huge feet.
Harry sighed. This was futile. What was he thinking? “So, you would never make friends with people who aren't magical – or all-human for that matter?”
Hearing a witch talk thusly to a house-elf didn't sit well with Draco at all. Lonely servants. Laughable. But when he contemplated the wrinkled-skinned little fellow, his views wavered as Kreacher's bloodshot eyes had a longing look to them, if only for a moment.
“Chop chop, you lovebirds, time to work!” Granger clapped her hands. She'd just finished applying the enhancing spells. “We'll be down in the dungeons for your reply. You'll find us, right?”
Harry followed suit. 'A way out, a way out, a way out...'. After maybe thirty seconds of silent chanting, he squinted around the room. Nothing had changed. He sighed. “You can stop now, Malfoy. No such luck.”
“Don't.” Ember's voice was low. “It might not seem that way but we are completely safe inside Berchthold's storm – Half told me so. As long as we stay in the middle of it, nothing will harm us. We are The Wild Hunt.”
The equally gigantic leader of The Wild Hunt on horseback looked as he always had: Wearing a green hunting attire, he was enveloped in an ever-moving storm cloud that lay on his shoulders like a cloak and he had an iron chain wound around his hips. He was still sprouting rather impressive antlers. Most prominent feature however was the red and black half-mask that covered the right side of his face, contrasting sharply with his fair skin. Oh and his horseman's boots which were aflame, like it was nothing special...
“Library!” shouted Draco without looking up; he was busy and long since used to Harry calling him by the name of a pastry.
The addressee's head snapped towards the group, eyes beaming. “Absolutely!” He had to shout, since he was currently several feet away, telling other Hunt members that his good friend Seeker got an invitation to one of the moss folk's famous masquerade balls and wasn't that just
“How about these long lines here?” Weasley's fingers followed the letters, some of which were really strange.
While the woods around them were green and full of life, the base camp at Holle's Pond continued to be under a permanent layer of clouds, the ground covered with powdery snow.
With her free hand, she pointed at some crooked paintings hanging at the walls. Harry could vaguely make out some mouse-traps indeed, the three sisters celebrating Christmas, a portrait of a round-faced, white-glowing woman with floating hair, and presumably muchness (?) in the form of a blank canvas with a single black dot in the middle.
At least with them the big boy was in good company (as proven by currently riding behind that giggly Gryffindor girl Brown). At least Draco hoped that. Had he first thought The Hunt was of terrible and demonic nature, he had found out that this was just a misconception; that the cortège was actually a place of cheer and laughter (and he was aware of the irony).
“Yes, you did. I saw you enter. Wait, I'll try.” Hermione wasn't a Gryffindor for nothing and now, she was also curious.
The chalkboard listed pending tasks from the day before and Harry half-heartedly chose 'debris removal from the lake'. It didn’t matter what, he just needed something to get his mind off his nightmare.
Longbottom nodded relieved and Draco thought that this wasn't the worst of ideas. However, Thomas who had not said a single word during the whole conversation, spoke up now: “You two go ahead. I still have something to say to Malfoy.”
In the one second Harry had been reminiscing, photographers had surrounded their little group. Harry felt uncomfortably trapped. The press was still not his cup of tea, even though it was now way more moderate and printing way less lies about him.
Holding his sides, Harry had laughed about Draco's indignation and pulled him close to pepper his face with kisses. “Sorry, love. It's just such a good Weasley joke. You should have seen them quip! It was great, Draco.”
!” Every word was a painful pant and Harry suddenly became acutely aware that this was not the best moment for teasing.
“Er, so, that's odd, yeah?” Harry had blushed furiously and tried to divert now, but Malfoy kept following the passing pictures with his eyes, his gaze snapping up and down at second intervals.
“A round for Malfoy,” Finnigan hollered ignoring Draco's sarcasm and zealous house-elves appeared to top off their beverages.
Draco glared at him. “Left your brain with The Hunt, did you? I'm an opportunist! You should know that best!”
“There are more of you here?” Malfoy's wand was back in his hand and he looked increasingly nervous.
His gaze followed the outstretched arm of his new friend which pointed to a fast approaching land mass.
“What? Oh.” The girl looked up, jolted out of her reverie. “Right, sorry. I meant: Remember when we came into the nursery and Ron shouted for us not to say the baby's name so that we wouldn't forget about her?” Simultaneous nods. “Yeah, that wouldn't have happened.”
My word-vituoso beta umbrellaless22 (thank you <3) made the philosophical remark that the first scene could be read as Harry's id and ego. Wonderful interpretation!
“How about this,” Half said emphatically, his red hair floating in the wind like a cloud, “we're about to land over there, see? Let's talk this through once we're down, yeah?”
Draco swallowed hard and made a decision. “When he's gone you'll be alone again, won't you? Why don't you,” he faltered a bit but ploughed on, “come live we me for the time being?”
It was the first time Harry had ever heard anyone call Crabbe by his first name. It was also the first time he'd ever heard Malfoy talk like this – and it somehow made him angry.
“I...” Harry wanted so much to tell Malfoy to belt up; that he was tired from constantly studying for his O.W.L.s while being sleep deprived over weird nightmares, not to mention the overall threat of Voldemort and Harry's guilt about Dumbledore’s fate. However none of this was any of Malfoy's business and mostly those were not things you'd talk about with your school rival. Also (and here Harry leant back quickly), Malfoy's face was only centimetres from Harry's at the moment and that was just a bit... distracting. “It's late,” he settled on lamely and gently pushed the other's shoulder. “Make space so I can un-stick us.”
Harry's hands curled fists. Yes, it had been unfair and uncalled for and he really wished to scream that out into the world. Though in the long run, everything had turned out alright. If he had learned anything during his time riding with The Hunt, it was that getting upset over every little thing in the past wasn't helpful.
would always be frozen in the state he had been in when he had been painted. Sure, as a portrait, he could make new memories, but he would never really live, never change. Maybe knowing that made him fearless of consequences.
“Five, this year included,” Hermione replied, “And how many times,” she continued a little louder when Parkinson opened her mouth to cut in, “did you see a Slytherin who was doing something for others without expecting personal gain?”
Seeker furrowed his brows. What had BraveHeart been talking about? Leaving The Hunt? When had he ever wanted to leave The Hunt? Here, where his friends were, where he was free and every day was fun – who would ever want to leave? He shook his head. BraveHeart, that overexcited child, was simply spouting nonsense since he was so happy to have a main part in this game's round, surely.
“Is it crazy that he's always on my mind? Even before... See, he got himself kidnapped by The Wild Hunt and now
Harry did and his blond adversary landed undignified and cursing on all fours... which turned out to be a bit awkward for Harry who was presently faced with Draco Malfoy's backside pressing into his groin. He quickly tried to move away, only to find himself somewhat stuck and, losing balance, he tumbled over backwards, landing painfully on his ass.
“Brilliant. A dead end,” Malfoy groaned and flung himself into a nearby armchair with fading blue satin fabric.
Impossible. It couldn't be. Or could it? Could the whispered stories of vanished or eradicated people really be true? That they never truly existed in the first place? Had Potter's life been erased when he'd been taken, like in the old tales?
For an endless moment the couple didn't appear to have listened, but then they pulled apart, hair wild and cheeks flushed.
Ron had walked head-first into the clock-face to Hermione's left. She blinked, confused, and stared back at the door to her right. “What..?”
“Alright.” The girl shook her bushy curls and gave the room a scrutinising look. “Malfoy, what do you think about setting up shop here rather than your place? No offence, but the gatehouse is awfully small. Here, however, we would have enough space to store and categorise books.”
The man-dog seemed just as confused. Now, though, he had spotted his sister's newborn on the ground and jumped into the courtyard.
They were just rounding a corner, when Ron pulled them into a sudden halt. “Sodding son of a–!” he cursed under his breath and showed Hermione that they were very likely too late: The two little ink people on the aged parchment were shown standing next to each other on a small staircase. There was no way Malfoy hadn't caught Harry.
Granger nodded. “Exactly and it is spearheaded by a leader, who also serves as the cavalcade's crier. Depending on the stories’ origin, he is said to be various persons, can be either male or female. Among the 20 personae we've found so far, more often than not the leader is described as a man riding a pale horse. Among other things he is called winter, hell hunter, king of the nation of the wind, lord of storms or even the god of magic. He is thought to carry either a club or a crossbow as well as a harp or a hunting horn. He hunts prey but there are stories of him chasing a woman – his companion or even his alter ego in other tales – or a folk of little forest people that might be fae or other beings. But at times he supposedly hunts down wrongdoers until they can no longer run. Some say he can see the future with his right eye and that he can shape-shift into things or animals, particularly into a stag. Also, he's frequently accompanied by a right hand man or woman – or dog.”
Wow, either Hermione's hair pins were zooming around them or Draco was in the middle of having vivid hallucinations of sparks flying.
Aside from wearing a nice dress that practically screamed 'holidays', her appearance was in disarray, her bushy hair even wilder than usual. She looked livid.

Mounting their brooms, Draco couldn't help himself but voice a thought that had just occurred to him. “Is that why you're here so often? Because your family is shit?”
chimed the door). Good gracious, that guy could sell water to fish. Draco had bought way more useless stuff than he had wanted to – and the VIFF discount had absolutely nothing to do with that.
“Alright, alright, we get it, we love you again. Now go in there and take care of Goyle and then let's all grab a drink or something. Er, non-alcoholic of course,” Greengrass said, pointing at the door from behind which loud expletives were shouted their way.
That explained the fact that Seeker had never seen anyone get too close to the pond. Only Holle once, one very early morning, when she, stark naked and somewhat youthful looking, had dove in. He had been wondering about that (and tried to scrub the picture from his brain ever since).
Lacie relented. “But it'll have to do one more thing for us, see Elsie here is a painter. Elsie draws all manner of things – everything that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness.”
“Vin...” Draco slapped a hand over his mouth, forcing himself to swallow the name. If he called his dead friend now, what good would it do Vincent? He would have to leave The Wild Hunt and be what? A ghost at Hogwarts?
Catching snowflakes in his hand, he felt light and warm as if one of his many inner cracks had been healed just a little bit.
Even though he hadn't had any specific plans to move out yet, the thought had been on his mind for a while now. It was just difficult to find a different place to live – after all, it had to be a wizarding location (problem one: No one wants former Death Eaters as their neighbours)
The lights flickered. No, they didn't. But it felt to Harry as if they did, when the world suddenly started tilting before his eyes. Myrtle and Malfoy and water...
Oh, Seeker would miss these idiots, too. More than he let himself feel at the moment; but his life was out there, with Draco, and Seeker simply couldn't stay with The Hunt forever. Even if that meant, leaving the friends behind.
“Rules are rules, Potter,” Malfoy lectured, only to continue, still awkwardly hanging head-down, “and before I forget it: fifty points from Gryffindor for breaking school regulations and resisting punishment.”
Draco sighed and took a deep breath. He had been in similar situations before. It was one of the reasons he had decided to avoid social gatherings lately.
Suddenly all his strength left Draco and he slowly let out a breath, sinking down onto a battered wing chair facing his interlocutor. “You're not familiar with Harry Potter.” This was starting to sound like a conversation between two parrots, always repeating the other's last words.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. It would be so easy. Why couldn't he let out his inner Slytherin and just seize the opportunity? But it would be so unfair for Harry... and so painful for Draco once the former woke up from his delusions. Draco opened his eyes, looking straight at Harry. “The problem is, you
Malfoy finally ripped his gaze from the walls (Malfoy watching Harry getting detention in Umbridge's class.) and faced him. “No. But I don't think it would help with this height anyway, Potter. Use your brain as long as you still can.”
make words mean so many different things. Not saying the Dark Lord's name is out of respect. Something
Hermione brushed the other girl's hand off. “Don't worry, we're going for the package deal – we'll spring Harry and get Malfoy as a bonus. You'll have him back in no time.”
Half-heartedly they had discussed checking for pipe entries, but had decided to wait after all, since they had no idea which pipes to take, if any.
It had taken all of Harry's Gryffindorness to head upstairs earlier and to nonchalantly step into his bedroom, where he'd known Draco must have been as there had been light shining from under the door. Just, he'd simply wanted to be close to Draco, no matter what.
However, the young man who was now glaring out of the window with wild, pain-filled eyes was not having any of it. He stared at the assembled riders.”You! You give her back right this second. You bastards! You murderers! You
Love. Of course it was love. The most powerful magic, the most powerful connection – and certainly nothing the two of them were ready to talk about yet. Hell, Harry hadn't even digested his own feelings completely, how could he talk about this with Draco? And Draco's feelings... he shook his head – not tonight. “Right, you know what? Let's continue this conversation another time, yeah? I think I'll try the bed again. Care to join me?”
Half, as the mischief-maker he was, took this very moment to start a snowball fight and soon everyone except Ember (who had quickly ducked away, cradling the nursling) was panting and giggling and had snow in unmentionable places.
