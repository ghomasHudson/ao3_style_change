Draco settled next to Harry stroked his face, the lightest of touches which left a tingling wake behind it. Harry shuffled closer and hummed, then closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep with Draco, feeling that maybe, just maybe, he was finally home.
"l've lost the only person who would hug me," whispers Draco, and the tears threaten to rise again, as he acknowledges just how bleak and empty his future is. Potter is silent, but then draws him into a hug again.
“Anyone would think that you’re making excuses to visit us here now,” Potter said. “You’ve been here three evenings this week already.”
“My great-great-however-many-times grandfather would take people over during daylight hours only.” Harry pointed out to the river, aware that they were nowhere near London Bridge, new or old. “But if he didn’t like someone, or they had paid with bad coin, he would wait until no one was looking… and push them in.”
“It’s that or Malfee” Harry said. ‘Malfoy’ seemed too… cold, or distant somehow. “Sorry. Between Pansy and Hermione saying it so much, and then Teddy with his ‘Drackee Malfee’s…”
Draco thought maybe he should just Apparate away and dry off at the Manor, but then Potter reached out again, his hand returning to Draco’s clothes. He kept his eyes on Draco’s as he continued unbuttoning Draco’s soaked coat. As it slid from his shoulders, Draco swallowed. Potter smiled then, his eyes heavy with intent. The breath caught in Draco’s throat: was this really happening? To check, he touched a finger to Potter’s hand, but with another smile Potter batted it away to pull Draco’s sodden sweater over his head. The wool was wet and cold as it slid over his face, but that wasn’t why Draco was shaking.
Draco didn’t want to talk about it. Not to Sarah. Not to anyone. “It’s just sometimes… I have nightmares.” He sighed and ran a hand through his hair, hoping that Sarah would assume that it was some inner turmoil: post-war funk or concern for his parents.
Harry saw Malfoy shudder at the word ‘party’, and scowled at him: Malfoy was always so quiet around the others, maybe what he needed was a chance to loosen up a bit. Malfoy raised an eyebrow at Harry, and held his gaze before seeming to realise where he was, then turned away abruptly. It was the most interaction they’d ever had in front of the others, and suddenly Harry felt nervous.
"Oh, I'm going to do that now," said Harry, pulling Malfoy in for a kiss. "And maybe next time we should wait before we... you know, against the table."
Draco does not even pretend to want to sit by the fire that night, and goes to the tent early. Potter follows soon after, and there is an awkwardness as they both strip and get into bed. Soon though, they are breathing in unison and asleep.
“I– I should leave you to it.” Draco stepped back, and ran a hand through his hair. It left him looking uncharacteristically ruffled, and Harry didn’t know if he wanted to see Draco like this more often, or if he wanted to pat it all back into place himself. “I'll see you at work next week, Harry.” He nodded at Hermione, then turned, and began to walk away. It only took another two or three steps for him to stop, though, as Harry felt the familiar tug in his gut, pulling in Draco’s direction.
Harry thought of Walburga, pouring forth her foul insults. “I did think that if I ever got her down I’d shove her down in the cellar, but I don’t think I could do it.”
The man pulled his waistcoat down sharply, then hooked his hands on his frock coat as he looked down his nose at Draco. “This must be important, to come in here.”
“You’ve been avoiding me.” Malfoy’s voice disturbed the quiet of the room. Harry turned to face him.
Hermione’s next note arrived when Draco was reading about divination again. It was such a mess of a discipline, he wondered how he could ever have found hope in such patent nonsense. He put the book down with some relief. He decided to head straight to the Ministry to see if he could catch her on a break – according to Pansy she liked to stop for tea – and avoid wasting any more time sending notes back and forth.
Harry chanced a look at them. Ron was frowning, his ears bright red, and Hermione was looking at Harry as though he were a puzzle to work out. Neither had stormed off, so it was already better than he’d feared. There was time for that, though.
Malfoy looked at him then, and unlike before Harry saw hope written across it, saw it in the wideness of Malfoy’s eyes, and the way his lips were parted.
“He’s not stupid,” Harry said automatically, even though he’d spent years thinking that Dudley probably was.
"All we can do is hope," Draco said. "I… don’t want to be just ‘fine’ anymore. I want to know what life is like when I’m more open to it."
"Blimey, Harry, were you okay?" He shifted uncomfortably. "And, er, I don't think I want to know what you were doing to break it."
“We’re still looking for a violin,” said Draco, dragging his attention back from Potter. “You know, the one we’re being blackmailed about.”
Every time he moved his wand arm he was reminded of their time together; he had so many muscles that ached he wasn’t sure if there were any left that didn’t.
Harry’s hand moved up Draco’s leg, and a new sensation started up for Draco. Heat coursed through him, through arms and legs, into his kiss. He pulled Harry closer, and Harry groaned.
“I can like both,” Harry said. He put his head in his hands. “I can’t believe I’m having this conversation on Christmas day.”
Draco was so focused on his work, so lost in the rhythm and the sounds the sharp scent of metal in the air, that he didn’t hear Potter arrive.
The tea was helping, a little. Unfortunately it wasn’t enough to persuade Draco that this was all some surreal dream, and that he’d wake back home. The grey and brown dirt ingrained under Henry’s nails and in his clothes were too real a detail for any dream. Draco ignored the fluttering rising in his chest, and put his mug down. “When do we get started, then?” He was proud of himself for not wavering as he asked. There was no way that he was going to show a moment of weakness in front of this stranger. He may never have woven a basket before, but he’d been good at every subject at school: why shouldn’t he excel in this, too?
“I have to bring a guest?” Harry said. “There’s nothing about this ball that isn’t a total nightmare.”
Luna had been right; Harry did, indeed, like Draco. His fingers itched to reach out, to feel what he’d previously only accidentally bumped into: smooth skin, a smattering of hair, and a landscape of bumps and ridges. Harry wanted to map the heat of Draco’s body. If his feet were hot, what then were his thighs like? What, Harry thought with a barely contained whimper, about the space at the top of his thighs and all that lay there?
Somehow, despite being desk-bound, Harry was actually falling behind with his paperwork, and when he got back home, there was an owl from Robards with various not-so-veiled comments about the department not meeting its monthly targets. Harry realised that he would just have to go back into work.
McGongall’s reaction was more extreme than Ron and Hermione’s. She had to sit down - the Room provided a stiffly upholstered chair - and take several deep breaths before she could speak.
“It’s rather unusual for south London to have any underground tunnels. Most of the land isn’t suitable. However, it’s been just fine for the last hundred years,” Malfoy added. “I’m sure it will manage for a few more.” His fingers drummed on the door. “Come on, Blaise, we’re going to be late.”
Later, Wwith his arms pinned down above the bed as Draco wanked him off while sucking on his neck, relishing the feeling of freedom and skin-tingling arousal while he twisted with pleasure, Harry decided that everything would be different from now on.
“Don’t flatter yourself. You’re not that much of a rebel, with your perfect tea cups and huge manor house.”
Harry stayed where he was, staring at the far-off stars. In his hand, he held a small green feather. He sat there for a very long time.
With the single lantern lit, the room was filled with the sinuous shadows of stone branches. Softly dark at its edge, an inner warmth and light held Harry and Draco.
"A few. I go fishing in the river below sometimes. The big ones tend to stay away from all the splashing though. And I don’t think any of them eat people."
Felix, his own breakfast finished, curled around Harry’s legs then sauntered off. From where Harry sat at the breakfast bar, he could see that the cat walked around the hazard tape as he had done.
“I know,” Harry said. He waited, as there was clearly more that Malfoy wanted to say. Plus it was fun to see him squirm a bit with his unasked question.
“Much as he deserved it for being a prejudiced tit, I’d hoped we all moved on a little since then,” Hermione said. Her mouth always went a bit tight at any mention of her punching Malfoy. Harry suspected that she had developed Rather Strong Views on hitting people. Malfoy had totally deserved it though.
“No, no it wasn’t,” said Draco. “In fact, I’d quite like to do it again.” He smiled, and time picked up where it had left off: no longer standing still, it felt as though clocks had started ticking again.
A broom,” Harry said flatly. “I think Muggles know a thing or two about having to clean with their tools alone. I bet this one works better than yours.”
“Er, I’ll leave you to it,” Harry said. “I wouldn’t want to mess anything up. Although would you like a cup of tea? I was about to make one.”
"Don't laugh," said Harry, feeling mortified. "That's probably scarred Ron for life." He felt Malfoy shrug against him.
“About how to avoid revising?” Draco said. “You can’t distract me again. Not unless you try, very hard.”
Low light slanted through the room, bright yet cool. Harry though, felt warmer than normal. When he stretched out and encountered a thin leg, he remembered why, and wakefulness rushed upon him like a wave crashing onto shore. Suddenly aware of every part of his body, Harry made an effort not to move. He foot though, was still touching Malfoy’s. As slowly as he could, Harry pulled his leg away.
“Sirius was my godfather. Remus… looked out for me. And now I’m godfather to his son.” Harry thought of his little godson, both parents dead, exactly like him. It hurt too much to think about for any length of time, and he closed his eyes, trying to forget the sight of Andromeda Tonks with grief marking her face and a wailing baby in her arms.
He came to settle on Harry’s antlers. It was strange to be connected in this way, to feel this weight on his head and neck and know it was Draco. After a moment, Harry dipped his head, and Draco flew off and landed instead on one of the stone branches.
“I thought I should try something different. Anyway,” Harry tried to focus on what he wanted to say, “I’m a bit jittery. I’m not sure what a cup of tea would do to me. But I’d like to have one, with you.”
“Quabble? What is that, an off-shoot of The Quibbler? You’re not working as a hack now, are you?” Malfoy moved back slightly. He didn’t read any of the papers, not anymore. Not even for the Quidditch scores.
, passed through his mind; but he wanted his house back, so he gestured to the steps then made his way to the front door, not checking to see if Malfoy followed him. Harry gripped the doorknob, suddenly worried that number twelve might not let him in, but he turned and pushed and the door swung open as usual.
Draco touched Harry’s face again, and hooked his other hand in the softness of Harry’s t-shirt. The desire to kiss him had returned, it filled him with a soft ache. Whereas the first time they’d kissed Draco had wanted to consume Harry, now he wanted to savour him. He wanted to take his time, and taste Harry. With this in mind, he reached into a kiss, slow and sweet.
He licked his lips, noting how Draco’s eyes followed his tongue. He could hear Draco’s breathing, open-mouthed, shallow.
It was such a lovely day, and the house so gloomy, that by unspoken agreement they had chosen to eat there, rather than take sandwiches back to Grimmauld Place. They found a table, tucked away at the back by a blue-painted window, the sash wedged open with a piece of wood. It managed to look cheerful even though it opened on to a tiny space which appeared to be mostly made of brick wall.
The kitchen, too was full of sharp corners. He managed to walk straight into the breakfast bar, letting out a loud ‘Ooph’, before managing to push the bathroom door open so he could piss. Everything was still dark, and the thought of a bright light was too much. He swayed, standing at the toilet with one hand braced on the wall for support, for a while after he’d finished.
“I wondered about the balls. Did you use yours, or were they switched for League balls before the match?”
Harry almost dropped his second cup of tea. It took a few moments for Harry to realise what Malfoy meant; in his mind’s eye, he saw sheets and skin. Even though he knew Malfoy meant desks and parchment. And now he was thinking of pushing up
"A union between an heir from elsewhere along the family tree, and the person attempting to claim the house," Severus said.
"If you prefer, you can leave this house, never break the curse, and never return. The choice is yours," Malfoy said, his voice flat and uncompromising.
Potter put down his tea, and crossed the room to where Draco had left the case on the worktop. His demeanour changed as he tightened the bow and tuned the violin. Draco stopped seeing the holes in Potter’s jumper, or the stains on his trousers. Instead he just saw focus in the set of Potter’s face, and the reverence with which he handled the violin.
The offices of Ogilvy and Taylors were housed in a street not too dissimilar to Draco’s: an industrial mews. It was, however, in a wizarding part of Gloucester. Draco instinctively walked with his head down, wishing he had his robes on so that he could better blend in. Potter, interestingly enough, adopted a similar stance.
“I’ve wanted to do this for weeks.” Harry pushed Draco back until he was pressed up against the wall. “Your mouth is completely kissable, you know.”
The table creaked with their weight as Harry pushed Malfoy back. "I'm glad you changed your mind," said Harry. "But I think that we need to work on equality in this... whatever this is." Malfoy regarded him, eyebrow raised.
“What? Oh.” Harry looked down at his hand. “It seems fairly clean to me. Rain-washed, if anything.” He looked around the room, as though seeing it for the first time. “I guess I better set up a proper perch or two. Cast a waterproofing charm on the floor.” He frowned at the old bed opposite him. “And I don’t think they really need a bed in here. Maybe some more space…”
“Oh goodness, it is getting late, isn’t it?” Draco said before Potter could question him any further about puppies.
“Look, I’d really rather not, if you don’t mind. It’s probably just… that stupid talk Robards gave us got me wound up.” Harry knew this wasn’t the entire truth, but he really didn’t want to talk about it: he hadn’t said some of those things about the war before, not even to Ron or Hermione, and he hated that the first person he’d ever said them to was Malfoy.
“I’m so happy I could kiss you, Harry Potter,” Malfoy said. As soon as he’d said the words his mouth clamped shut; the atmosphere in the room changed, the laughter turning to a sudden quiet.
Harry remembered Dobby, but then he remembered Sirius and Kreacher. He felt uncomfortable with the idea of house-elves, and he knew it was another reason to want to avoid Grimmauld Place.
“I’m not saying no to a cup of tea. I’m not a total snob, whatever you think. All I’m asking is that you do it properly.”
“When the bond wears off, I’ll get stuck to the first person to come near me. Could you walk me to the Floo?” Harry suddenly realised that Draco was also probably too drunk to Apparate home. He couldn’t quite picture him taking the Knight Bus, either: he’d probably get beaten up by a little old lady with a handbag. “And, er, I’m sure Tom will let you use it, too.”
Luna nodded, causing her carrot earrings to swing. “And unfortunately destroying the lawn mower would make it permanent.” Harry was still trying to get his head around the idea that the curse had been buried within the nuts and bolts of a
“Right. That.” Any peace Harry had got from watching TV seemed to evaporate, replaced by a sense of heaviness.
“And pick and prepare the reeds to make them. I’ve got a store of reeds and rushes from last summer, but I think it’s important for you to understand the material you’re working with.”
By the end of November, the household seemed to have settled into a new set of rhythms. Greg seemed to have gravitated towards Luna – a result, perhaps, of the week he’d spent living as a cat and curled up in her lap. Harry and Ron were back at training, while Malfoy spent most of his time with his potions. He came to bed smelling different every night.
“Found you!” Proudfoot gave the tree another shake. “I can’t see you, Potter, but you just gave off a blast of heat and magic. I know you’re there.”
“Considering all the rubbish he’s made us test over the years I can’t see how he can complain,” said Harry.
Sometimes, Harry would wake, or not have fallen asleep yet, and he would hear Draco’s night-time cries. They varied, from tears for his mother, to shouts of fear, to a voice twisted with rage. Harry never mentioned them, but would lie, stiff and silent, as Draco’s voice filled the room.
“Dancing. You should try it, too.” Potter reached out and spun Draco around, knocking him off balance. As Draco tripped, he heard a tearing noise. He landed in something soft and sticky: cake. His pocket had ripped open, and all the food he’d hidden in there had spilled across the floor.
“Liz Bagman married Glenn Taylor, of Ogilvy and Taylor. They’ve both been borrowing substantial amounts from the Goblins—”
Malfoy brought his trunk up, and put it under the window. Harry remembered seeing his own in the same spot; it seemed to belong there.
All around them beech trees spread their branches wide, and the canopy was aquiver with their leaves. Light moved in patches on the forest floor, carpeted with old leaves, and in the shade of the trees the day was comfortingly warm rather than overly hot.
“You’re not allowed to?” Harry was shocked. He couldn’t imagine even the Wizengamot handing down such a punishment.
Weasley reappeared, his head no longer bleeding. He stopped short when he saw the two of them on the floor. “Obviously I wasn’t gone for long enough.”
Although Harry had done his fair share of sweeping over the years - usually the kitchen floor, garden patio or drive at Privet Drive - this was on another scale entirely. Muggle or wizarding, the design of the broom seemed immaterial when there was so much to do.
“Merlin, how did we end up talking about Lucius? That man will never ruin anything for me, ever again.”
He stared at the key for a moment before unlocking the door. Draco hadn’t needed to use a key in weeks now, and there seemed something petty about all these boxes full of people, all locked up. The key itself looked strange in his hand, small and mundane. It looked like a Portkey, an object that meant nothing and could be discarded.
down with a heavy clap. “You’ve got purple hair; I can’t believe you’re fussing about a napkin to eat a bowl of Greg’s lumpy porridge!”
“Tonight?” Anthony said, He was already packing his trunk. Harry, along with Ron, were going to do their usual last minute chuck-everything-in style of packing.
They sat, the two of them in the over-full room, without talking. Harry looked back at the desk, where countless cups of coffee and snatched lunchtime sandwiches had left their mark. It didn’t look too different to any of the desks on the main floor. A clock ticked loudly behind Harry’s head, measuring out the seconds where nothing was said. The throbbing across his forehead intensified. He could picture Professor McGonagall, sitting in a chair by the fire in her office, trying to protect her students even after they had left school. The thought of it left him with an ache for Hogwarts, for the times he’d felt safe there. Eventually, Harry looked up. Robards was looking at him.
"I… I want to show you something." Potter leant forward and touched Draco’s knee briefly, a short squeeze before he stood again. Draco stared at his knee, and felt surprise that there wasn’t a glowing red spot where Potter had touched him, because that was how it had felt: a red-hot glow of warmth.
"Do you two really still call each other Potter and Malfoy?" asked Ron. Harry and Draco exchanged a look.
Malfoy took a bite of omelette, and his eyes shut for a moment as he hummed to himself in pleasure. It was distracting enough a sight that Harry stopped mid thought and watched him chew instead. He swallowed as Malfoy did, even though he didn't have anything in his own mouth.
The silver mists of a memory pulled Harry in, as a spring day swam into focus. Young leaves, bright and green, spread overhead.
"I am going to eat you up," Harry said, "and then I am going to let my dick let you know just how much it’s missed you."
Holding onto his hips, Harry set up a slow, steady rhythm. He didn’t let up. And Draco felt himself let go, button by metaphorical button. Each thrust brought him to something deeper within himself, and somehow the rough earth beneath his knees, the bark under his hands, the scent of the forest were all part of it.
Harry swallowed down the lump in his throat. Tonks was gone, but how cool was it that he could learn to make his own hair pink like hers? The thought that he too could learn to change his hair opened up other possibilities. Surely this would help if he became an Auror, or even if he wanted to change his appearance so that he could have a bit of anonymity?
“I will try to talk him into it, I’ll ask him to do it for me, personally. I really would like it if you could.”
For the first time that day, Harry wasn’t bored, or impatient, or even that tired. “I would like to know.”
“You don’t rob banks, do you?” Ron said. “Because if you are involved in any criminal activity, I’ll have to—”
“Eight, keep the noise down. Nine, be considerate about visitors. No parties without consulting the others.”
“Oh!” Pansy’s cheeks pinked up and her lips parted as she inhaled. “Oh, I see.” Draco could hear the interest in her voice. Dammit, why did she have to be so obsessed with sex?
The room, which had seemed so dead and empty, now felt different. It felt as though it were waiting.
“I do not! How many times have I woken up to find you cocooned in a nest of blankets? Or curled up right up against—”
Draco thought of Potter surrounded by a wheeling flock of Snidgets. It seemed as though it would be right, somehow. Potter was as wild as they were, in his own way. It was unlikely that Potter would take him up on the offer, but if there was a chance... “I’d love to see you with them. Er, I mean, I’d love you to see them.”
Too bloody right Draco wasn’t used to it. The water felt icy, and he almost yelped when he wet his hands and face.
Draco sank into an armchair, his body feeling every ache of his journey back, of the weariness of his soul.
Harry sat back again. “Fine.” His eyes travelled over Draco’s face. “Maybe another time. But you’ve still got to come to the ponds with me.”
Finally, he turned to look at Harry. They were standing quite close to each other, and Harry could see very clearly just how striking Malfoy's eyes were; they were pale, and filled with light. He was transfixed with the sight of his eyelashes, each one distinct and so fine that they were almost transparent, as they swept down with each blink. Harry backed away, struggling to remember what they were talking about. Malfoy said nothing, but turned to the tapestry again, this time wand in hand. The familiar pink glow spread across the family tree and Harry sensed that whatever that moment had been, it was over now.
"What happened to taking your time?" asked Malfoy, as Harry unbuttoned his fly with trembling fingers.
At the same time, he wanted to be able to be honest. It was about more than touch, or getting off. It was about attraction and a deeper pull of connection. He had to be true to and with himself, with Draco - and somehow, with his friends. Would they think of him differently? He watched Ron and Hermione as they all played cards together, or as they splashed in the sea. His friends would love him no matter what. And yet he still didn’t know how to tell them, where to start. He’d been living a double life all year, trying to get on as an eighth year with them, and fixing the Room with Draco.
Up on the roof it was windy, and the noise of it seemed to fill Harry’s ears. He longed for silence, proper silence, and the image of a cool white waiting room flitted through his mind; he felt tired, all of a sudden.  “I don’t need your opinion. Didn’t ask for it, either.” Harry just wanted to be left alone.
“I just… I hate turning up and everyone staring at me, and then using the wrong fork and accidentally insulting them. I always leave with the feeling that people only put up with me because of who I am.”
"That doesn't have to be true," Potter says, and his voice is muffled next to Draco's ear, but the words spread through Draco like an ache. He doesn't know what he's doing, being hugged by Potter in a tent, but it feels so good to be close to someone like this, and so Draco hugs back.
“You’re welcome,” Harry said, as though his defeating Voldemort had anything to with some background Slytherin he’d barely registered until now. He immediately felt a low wave of shame at how mean this thought was. It had been for Blaise; it had been for everyone. They all deserved to live in a world free from murderous nose-less bastards.
“What if I want to bother you?” Harry said, watching as Malfoy’s eyebrows raised at the suggestion. Neither said anything, both taking nervous sips of their drinks instead.
Ron nodded, and as Harry made his way across the room he felt a sense of peace at seeing all his friends together.
He quickly scrawled a note and tied it to the owl’s leg, then watched it fly away. He was ready, he thought, to have them over. Then he remembered his housemates. Bollocks. He’d have to talk to them and check it was OK to invite his friends for dinner. It was his home too, Harry told himself, but he could never quite get away from the fact that Malfoy and Blaise had no say in his living there. He looked down at the ink splattered on his hand. He didn’t have a choice about avoiding anyone now, and he’d acted as though he hadn’t heard a single thing Blaise had been saying to him.
"Sorry to interrupt all this talk of knobs and pricks, boys, but here are your sandwiches," said a woman bearing two plates. She bit her lip and put the plates down, then hurried away back to the counter, before either of them could say anything. Harry could just see her out of the corner of his eye, whispering with the other woman behind the counter, both of them looking over to Harry and Malfoy, while they giggled and looked pleasantly scandalised.
“Apart from that spot back there,” he pointed at the taped-off section of floor. “And the fact that three wizards live here.”
“Tea? Water? I don’t have much else.” Despite her poise, a fine sheen of sweat was beading on Pansy’s face and she looked flushed. The sun was lost behind thick white cloud, and the air was heavy. Draco was sticky with sweat. What he needed was a good thunderstorm, lots of rain and noise to wash away his malaise.
The next piece of wood felt so strong, Draco opened his eyes to look at it. "Ash, it would match someone with a strong will."
After he’d enquired about Ron’s weekend and heard all about how Hermione had taken him to the old Mimsy-Porpington seat - the ruins of Nearly Headless Nick’s old house, as Ron had explained when Harry looked puzzled - he returned to his paperwork. As a gentle return to work, he was to review files, which meant spending more time in the office than usual. Surprisingly, Harry was fine with this. Without the extra pressure of being miserable, he found he could concentrate without it feeling as though his head might implode. He’d always liked the active part of Auroring, but now he was enjoying this part too. All the careful thinking and attention to detail made him think of Malfoy, and as he picked up the case with the missing potion ingredients, he wondered what Malfoy would make of it all.
“I mean every day. Shop for food together, and cook together. For each other. Eat together, too.” It was what Harry wanted, more than anything else.
“Thanks.” Draco took his tea and placed it beside the bed. He smiled up at Henry, who sat beside him and carefully set the tray of pastries down in the space between.
Draco picked up the first, and closed his eyes. He got dappled light, the echo of birdsong… "Oak, relatively young, might suit someone musical."
The gentle buzz of magic washed over his skin, and Draco’s head shot round to see Harry quickly stow his wand.
He led Potter up the stairs. He normally used the shop below for business meetings, but Potter, although he’d been frowning, had mainly looked perplexed, and Draco thought that maybe a cup of tea was in order. And the kettle was upstairs, so up they went.
“Well if you’re not going to move, I guess that I better get this out of the way.” Malfoy took a deep drink from his glass before continuing. “Thank you,” said Malfoy, flushing, his pale hair sharply contrasted against his skin. “I mean, for, you know….”
"I missed you," Harry said. "Do you have an idea what a mind fuck that was? I have spent years accepting and being proud of how I live here alone, and then I’ve spent every day since you left pining after you, wishing I wasn’t alone. Poor Ron and Hermione, I think it was a bit of dampener on their holiday."
“Let’s eat,” George said. “We can have some of my nearly-as-good-as-mum’s roast potatoes, and the rest. After pudding I’ll show you.”
“Well then you must call me ‘Harry’.” Potter glanced over at Draco. “Although I doubt that your son will ever call me anything other than ‘Potter’.”
A woman with short blonde hair smiled as he said this, and Draco gave him an encouraging nod. Harry wondered how Draco was coping with something being added to his tour that hadn’t been written on a card first.
"I guess. Although…" Harry looked up at Draco, squeezed their joined hands. "It’s been… it’s been great having you here." He hooked Draco’s shirt and pulled him closer. "I wonder what life would have been like if we’d done this sooner."
Once Potter had left the room, Draco picked the violin up, and placed it on his shoulder. He half-imagined it still warm from Potter’s touch. What he would give to be able to play like that ridiculous scruff of a man! He lowered the violin, and cursed his own slim, elegant and talentless fingers. With a sigh, Draco touched his wand to the violin, and began his tests. Soon enough, this would be in the hands of some collector or musician, gathering dust or singing as it should. Either way, Draco’s role in the life of this instrument was limited.
Even without the promise of summer sun the promenade by the river was busy. Peeking over the wall Harry saw that the tide was out, just as it had been that day that everything had changed for him. He walked down to the small shore, aware of how differently he walked and felt. Where before he’d been exhausted, worn-out and defeated, now he felt calmer. For the past few weeks he had been floating on a strange kind of hope, of possibility. It felt like walking on air: impossibly light, and utterly terrifying in equal measures.
“Welcome back, everyone,” Professor McGonagall said. Her eyes swept around the hall, pausing at each of the four House tables. “It is good to see you here, and an especial welcome to our new students.”
Draco tried to keep his focus on the laundry, on the task of shaking and folding and making neat piles of clothes. Henry made it hard, though, when he pulled away the towel and wiped his chest and arms dry, revealing dangling flesh and dark wet curls. A strangled sound half-escaped from Draco’s mouth, and he bit his lip. He picked up another t-shirt, his cheeks burning at the thought that Henry had heard him. When he looked up again, Henry had put on the clothes Draco had given him. He was though, giving Draco a strange look.
A few of the beech leaves were turning yellow, Draco noticed; summer would be coming to an end soon. However much he wanted it to be an endless summer of sunshine and swimming, it could never have lasted forever.
“You lucky…” Harry kissed Draco on the chest, pausing to lick his nipple before travelling lower. “Bastard. Getting to preview all this.”
“You can get something for while we’re walking,” Hermione said. “I think Harry’s right, we need to get out.”
Heat rose through Harry; Malfoy was too close. Harry leant back, and Malfoy sighed. Malfoy’s glass, Harry noticed, was empty. “Another drink?” he asked, needing to put a little distance between them. This Malfoy –
Kreacher disappeared, and Potter stepped towards Draco. “We need to get those clothes off you,” he said, raising his wand.
Malfoy took a step back and his face fell, as though Harry had struck a blow at him. He turned his face away from Harry, who all of a sudden felt as though he were witnessing something private, something he should not see.
“We can turn the music down,” Ron said. He’d watched Malfoy as they’d walked back into the room, glancing over from where he sat with Blaise. Harry saw curiosity in his face, and he knew that Ron was more observant than people thought. Or at least, he was with the benefit of Auror training behind him. There were times at school he’d been oblivious to everything around him - particularly anything to do with Hermione. Poor sod.
"I wanted to work with hope, and possibility, and the joy of magic. I wanted to create things." Draco didn’t know why he was telling Potter. Talking in such mawkish terms usually embarrassed him, but considering he’d come across Potter communing with a tree that morning it didn’t seem too bad.
“Hi,” Harry said again. He took a step closer to Draco, wary of stretching his bond with Hermione, but he didn't feel anything so tried another step. This, too, was fine. “I don't know if I've ever seen you outside of work before. Except that one time, of course, at the Leaky…” Harry said, feeling awkward.
"—and sometimes just to amuse ourselves," Harry said, as if Draco hadn't spoken. He was trying hard to ignore just what people thought about the times he and Draco disappeared into his office. It wasn't as if it happened often. Well, not
“Well that’s the crux of the matter, isn’t it?” Odwolfe said. “In fact, I have to get started on organising the next set of tests, if you’ll excuse me.” Odwolfe walked out of the room, muttering to himself as he went.
Something about the wildness of Potter’s face brought a corresponding leap of daring to Draco. "I hate it here. At school, I mean. Everyone hates me, and I hate living with… him."
“There used to be, but things are changing. For example, it would be more complicated if it were a young man approaching Harry.”
Ron took a moment to finish chewing the massive bite of his sandwich he’d just taken, swallowing it down with a swig of tea. “There you go, Harry,” he said. “You can save the world but a Ravenclaw will always judge you on how you do your homework.”
"I don't want to mess it up. I– I think I'd quite like to be friends." Malfoy's words filled Harry with a swell of warmth.
Two days later, Draco knew enough to owl Potter asking him to come back. Draco had also returned to his workshop in the interim, pressing out the wings and smoothing the edges by hand. It was a laborious process: filing away with a jeweller’s needle file, sanding with the finest grade possible, then polishing, taking care to work in one direction only. Before he charmed the wings they were fairly fragile, and in many ways this was the trickiest part of Snitch-making. The silver glinted dully in the sunlight. Sometimes Draco wished that he could remove his gloves and test the wing edges properly, but he didn’t want to risk any contamination.
Harry was still holding on to the roof edge, fingers clasped tightly round stone, but he realised that yes, deep down he did know that he wasn’t about to be shoved off. He relaxed his grip a little, but was still wary as he eyed up Malfoy.  “Can’t you just leave me alone?”
Whereas Transfiguration had sped by, Harry fidgeted through Herbology, his whole body restless and his mind unable to focus at all on the lesson, and then lunch. Malfoy, too, he noticed, seemed unable to sit still, looking over at Harry then away quickly throughout lunch.
"It doesn't scare me, if that's what you think. You know, you're nothing like Voldemort was, so don't think that you can possibly remind me of him," said Malfoy with some amusement. His smile was self-deprecating as he met Harry's gaze. "I promise you, when you're hissing away like a snake, he's the last thing I think of."
“What?” Harry laughed. “No, he’s in the kitchens.” He grinned at the image of Kreacher in a Hogwarts gown. “Although the idea of a house-elf studying alongside everyone else would probably be Hermione’s idea of… well, of the most wonderful thing ever.”
Draco nodded, approving, at least of this decision. He slid another piece of paper from Potter’s file, this time a photograph of the Cannons and Puddlemere Seekers reaching for the Snitch at the same moment.
"We should work on that. If you can become a little more attuned to this ward, then it should help you sense when someone enters your house."
With a sense of courage that he hadn’t felt in a long time, his hands moved to Malfoy’s trousers, and he pressed his fingers along the hard heat pushing up against the fabric. Malfoy moaned, his hips twitching, and Harry felt a thrill that he was doing this, that he was making Malfoy react like this. His heart was pounding as he freed Malfoy’s cock and wrapped his fingers around it. It felt good, another man in his hand like this, hot and hard. Harry moved his thumb in a slow swipe over the head, watching as Malfoy’s mouth fell open and his eyes closed, his breath snatching in a shallow gasp.
Harry was torn between wanting to forget, wanting to ignore that part of himself that had loved being pinned, loved his arms twisted in his t-shirt and at Draco’s mercy, and wanting to do it all again. He didn’t know if he wanted Draco to smile or scowl, or push him or kiss him, but every moment they spent together it became clearer that he wanted a chance to make all those things happen. But of course Draco kept pushing him away.
Did Potter find these birds as fascinating? He glanced over. Potter was down by a boggy bit of land, picking his way across the firmer tufts with care. He seemed lost in thoughts, but his shoulders looked relaxed rather than slightly hunched as they had been earlier. The wind had picked up and Potter’s hair looked rather like something a bird would nest in.
Malfoy patted his hand print, then came to sit beside Harry. He looked through Harry’s collection of copied marbles, taking several out to examine them carefully.
By the time Harry went to bed that night, thoughts of his house or Malfoy were far from his mind. In his dreams though, a brass snake reared up and hissed "sex on a stick", while pale cheeks flushed and breath rasped next to him, bringing him to a delicious hum of arousal himself. He could see grey eyes filled with light, and reached out to touch warm skin. He woke in a hastily vanished damp patch, turned on, yet alone.
Three, maybe four kisses later, their clothes were lying scattered around the room, and Harry had his hand around both their dicks. Draco looked down. Without seeing Harry’s face, all he could see was Henry. And finally he was getting to live out every wet dream, wank and fantasy he could imagine, all at once.
“Flattery works well with you, then? I’ll remember that,” said Henry. He grinned. “Who’d have thought that Mr Rich and Mighty could be cajoled into a little work by means of flattery.”
He skimmed the titles in front of him, looking for something that might pique his interest. Hermione had taken down a huge tome and was propping it open on one arm, carefully turning the pages with the other. A shuffling sound made him turn around. Draco Malfoy was looking through a book a little further along the opposite shelves. Draco looked up, and his hand froze mid-page-turn. Harry felt a little sorry for him: after Hermione’s words earlier, he had an inkling how she might react when she saw Draco. She’d probably suggest that this was deliberate, him being here, whereas it was obvious from his wide eyes that he was just as much surprised as Harry was.
“You could say that.” Draco couldn’t see how they could ever work together, let alone anything else.
Greg followed Harry in. He immediately went to the Black family tree. “My family have got one of these,” Greg said. “Doesn’t have any burnt patches on it, though.”
“I’m not answering any more of these puerile questions.” Malfoy pulled the blankets up to his chin, and Harry saw his nose point up. Even in the dark Malfoy still pulled haughty faces.
“He is beautiful, though,” Ginny was saying when Harry arrived at the Three Broomsticks. She sounded like she’d already had a couple of drinks, and was waving a tankard around as she spoke.
When they left, Draco went to find Pansy in the kitchen. She had finished her tea, and was sitting up on the worktop.
As he moved around, his foot caught on the table leg, and Draco looked down in time to watch the table shift. Everything slowed down as the table leg folded in, but Draco couldn’t move fast enough to stop Henry’s pots slide off, one by one. Each one made a loud bang as it smashed on the floor, Draco’s hand only managing to grasp the lip of a plate, but too late to do more than deflect its fall as it slipped from his fingers.
“Inconvenient? No, it’s fine. I can read in my room. Blaise will polish his leaves or something, he’s always got something to do in that jungle of his.” Malfoy looked up again. “He told me he showed you his room.”
Harry jumped though, when Draco turned his head, grey eyes shining with tears. But Draco reached out and brought Harry’s hand back to his hair.
“Worse than trying to kill Dumbledore?” Harry’s blood felt hot in his veins, and the words came out in a half shout.
Once they’d finished their hot chocolates the three of them walked back towards the castle along the other shore. Eventually Harry let Ron and Hermione fall back, and hurried back to the castle on his own. He could see that they needed some time to talk to each other about everything he’d told them.
"But—" he said. He didn't know what he was going to say, he just knew that he wanted to kiss Malfoy again, and soon.
Harry closed his eyes and focused on his sense of himself, on that inner space that felt connected to the ground. This time he let that space expand, let it connect to the ground with four feet. The transformation, when it came, was nothing like the animal-head one had been. There was no pain; although he felt his body stretch and change, it was more like water pouring into a vessel, taking on its shape. He felt his strong muscles, ready to move, and the weight of antlers on his head.
“Why can I hear shouting?” Snape called out. “And you better have some clothes on now.” He walked back into his painting, his hands over his eyes. When he peered out from between his fingers, he groaned. He looked at Potter accusingly. “You said you hadn’t brought him here for a sordid tryst!”
"You look like you’ve been on a nice jolly somewhere," she paused, looking confused. "You look different somehow… have you been touring the Med on a yacht with a millionaire playboy or something? I swear you look more well-fucked than normal."
When they landed back in Potter’s study Draco stumbled and gasped, then righted himself, embarrassed at such a lack of finesse. He shivered again, aware somehow now he was indoors of just how wet he was. Water dripped down the back of his neck, it dripped from his nose and down the ends of his fingers. He began to shake.
Yes, Harry remembered rule sodding nine, and he had checked with Blaise first. “Blaise was OK with it.” Annoyance flared but then faded just as quickly. Malfoy might sound like his teen self, but Harry knew him well enough now to understand that all this bluster was merely a front. Harry laughed. “Anyway, you live with me; I think it’s a bit late to be complaining about sharing your space with Gryffindors.”
Harry let Ron’s chatter about the office float above him. He kept thinking about how uncomfortable Malfoy had looked. He felt awful, he realised, that it might be his fault. Since when did he care how Malfoy felt? Malfoy had been nothing but irritating since Harry had moved in, and yet… Harry wanted to see him relax. See him smile.
“Are you going to be like this the whole time?” Harry asked. Not that he minded; this was the most sociable Harry had seen Draco so far.
Draco gasped, and the sound filled the hallway, the touch of it bursting the illusion. The lines of light and shadow shifted, and Draco stumbled as the world seemed to sway around him. He steadied himself with a hand against the wall, and looked around to find that he was again alone in his hallway. The only evidence of his vision was his still racing heart and – damn it! – a hungry lick of arousal filling his belly. He could almost, but not quite, feel hands ghosting across his skin.
When Harry climbed the stairs to bed, before the stars had faded but after he’d closed the living room window to Malfoy’s satisfaction, he felt lighter than he had done in a long time. He’d never thought he’d be able to have a conversation like that. He didn’t, he realised, have anywhere to air his feelings about seeing Ron and Hermione together, or how lost and unfinished some parts of his life still felt. Yet Malfoy seemed to understand. He seemed, in his own way, lost and unfinished too.
Molly had surprised Harry by agreeing at once. She had a lot of questions about Draco, and Harry suspected that he’d be in for a bit of an inquisition when they went for lunch. She asked so many questions, that Harry wondered what Ron and Hermione had been saying to her about Draco. He hadn't really thought about it before, but of course his friends and family - the Weasleys were family - were interested in who he was living with.
Anger flared in Harry at Malfoy's tone, and he closed his eyes for a second. “Of course,” he said, trying to maintain the semblance of civility. However he felt, he needed to score well in every test from now on, to stay on the course. Bitterness twisted every time he thought of Malfoy though, with his bloody prowess and strength. Something even darker flared too, but he ignored it. Despite everything he had to admit that Malfoy was indeed good at all of this. The sneaking around in particular.
“Fine. Well, not fine. I don’t know. Tired mainly,” said Harry. “It’s busy at work.” Hermione nodded, and Harry didn’t say that although it was busy, he obviously wasn’t there. He had spent too much time staring into the distance, thinking about that box of memories. Harry drank some coffee, all bitter and sweet. He had snuck away from work to see her so that they could talk in peace and quiet, but now he was here, he didn’t know where to start. “Um, how are you?”
Harry, so shocked at Malfoy saying his given name, almost dropped the marble. But then he looked up, and saw that the tendrils now reached almost halfway across the room. As he watched, he saw them spreading, like a yawn, across the room.
That afternoon, fluffy white clouds appeared in the sky. In the evening the heat had become heavy and oppressive. By the next morning, a brisk breeze and overcast sky brought Potter in earlier than normal.
"I think mum is a little… overwhelmed, to be honest. It's a bit too modern for her. Although," he added, looking a little scared, "she has mentioned that there is plenty of room for children."
Hermione stretched, cat-like, dipping her toes lazily in the sea before looking around her. “I used to go on holiday with mum and dad, but nothing like this.”
“It seems to me,” Harry said, “that we have the chance to find out how magic can… I don’t know, heal us. What magic means when there’s peace, not war.”
He had spun at the sound of a rustle to his side, his wand quavering in his shaking fingers. He scanned the trees, but saw nothing. Whatever it was, he hoped it had gone away. After another few deep breaths – closer to gulps than breaths if he was honest – he lowered his wand and continued to make his way deeper into the forest.
Ludo Bagman stood behind his desk, his face a magnificent shade of magenta, his robes so magic-filled they floated around his body. He looked like a giant purple cloud of fury. Potter threw a shield up between Bagman and the rest of them, but not before one of Bagman’s stunners had hit him.
“Did you ever see what Greyback did to her?” Potter sat back in his chair, his face set in hard lines. “Actually, maybe you’re not the person to get a second opinion from.”
Harry just stared at her. He really didn’t remember her from school. Her scowl deepened. As he led his way to the Auror office, Harry sighed, thinking that at this point, his morning cup of coffee would have been most welcome.
A wand. He’d made a wand, and not any wand at that: he knew precisely who this wand was for. He didn’t need to try it out, because he knew it worked. He could feel it, when he held it. It felt like touching the tree.
Potter sat quietly, his brow gently creased. Draco’s eyes drifted down to Potter’s hands, and he felt again the heated slide of fingers across his skin. He shut his eyes, willing away the false memories of what had never been.
Of course, Greg had made up for it since, and Draco was staying in his spare room, but still, the past stung.
Before they sat down, though, Harry noticed something had changed. “The window!” Harry ran his hand along the window sill. Where he and Malfoy had been standing the last time they came, there were now two hand prints, side-by-side, just like there were on the back of the door.
Draco nodded, and moved out of the way so that Potter could get to his fireplace. The tin of Floo powder stuck slightly, but Potter managed to open it without spilling it everywhere. In a whoosh of green flames, he was gone. And Draco’s flat felt quiet… no, empty, in a way it normally did not.
“I hadn’t thought of it like that,” said Harry. “But I was thinking, just now, of trying to do something with this space. I mean…” he hesitated, unsure of going on.
A bell tinkled as Draco stepped through the door, and the man sitting on a stool in the corner looked up and smiled.
Both Draco and Potter spun around. An ancient house-elf wearing a huge red spotty apron – ruffled straps wrapped several times about his middle – was watching them from the other side of the room.
“Would you like some tea?” Malfoy continued swishing hot water around the tea pot, then poured it out into the sink. “If you would, get a cup.”
Harry focused on marching out of the building as fast as he could. He made for one of the quieter side exits, hoping not to bump into anyone he knew. Shoving the door open harder than he would do normally helped his mood a little. It was cold outside, but he sucked the cool air into his lungs as if he'd been deprived of oxygen. The ache of it also helped, as did kicking a wall. Harry went to his favourite place to mope: his room at the training centre was no good, only giving the semblance of privacy.
Draco and Quinte had merely been discussing the finer points of Snitch design. After a few drinks,  things had got messy, and they’d both been done for breaking the Italian version of the Statute.
“Oh, don’t look so alarmed! I know that everything you have suggested has been most valuable. I really do appreciate your input. We all do.”
“This is Odwolfe Scovel. His focus is more on the magic side of things,” Potter nodded at a pale man wearing silver glasses. “And this is Celeste Mire, she is our resident Muggle expert.” A woman with warm brown skin, her hair wrapped in a brightly coloured headscarf atop her head smiled at Draco. They both put down their instruments – Draco didn’t recognise Odwolfe’s – and stood to greet him.
“Thank you,” Draco said, and smiled. A shy, gentle smile. Harry smiled back. He felt again the loosening inside of him, as he had that morning. Their faces were reflected back at them from the darkened windows as they settled into a gentle chatter, hospital gossip and a story about Ron getting stuck inside a giant pumpkin. Harry couldn't remember the last time he'd let himself relax like this with Draco, and it felt good.
Rounding the corner after Herbology, later in the week, Harry almost walked into Millie. She was standing in the middle of the path, taking up space in a solid way that reminded Harry of Crabbe and Goyle in the old days. The scene in front of her, in fact, was reminiscent of those days too: two boys from the second or third year, angry at a small girl in a Hufflepuff tie who had recently been crying; her eyes were red and there were tear marks on her face.
"I could lose my wand if I tried!" Having his wand snapped had been recommended as the standard penalty for breaking one of the terms laid down for him at his trial, after the war. At least Potter had waited to disappear until after he’d provided a statement for the Wizengamot. A cold river of dread washed through Draco at the thought of what might have happened otherwise. Draco’s heart stuttered at the thought, and he took in a breath to steady himself. No wonder he was so fixated on making wands: it was one way to take away the threat of losing his own.
Bringing his attention back to Draco’s words, not paleness of his skin, Harry felt the need to defend himself. “Getting stuck to someone every five minutes doesn’t really go hand-in-hand with my work as an Auror, you know!”
The silence between them grew. Malfoy went to stand by the window, his hands on the sill as he looked out onto the cool grey day, while Harry paced restlessly.
“Another drink, maybe?” Percy said. He refilled all their glasses. “A toast to happiness,” he said. “Where ever we may find it.”
When Luna stopped chanting half an hour later, Harry was able to move more than two feet away from her, and he was beyond thankful.
“Harry,” Hermione said, once they’d stopped. “You are being careful, aren’t you? I mean… after the war and everything… you’re not trying to restart any old fights, are you?”
Beside him, Malfoy slept on. Malfoy still looked pale, but asleep lost his pinched, wary mask. The git was still pointy, mind, but at least he didn’t look scared anymore. Worry, like an ache in the heart, gnawed away at Harry. He had an odd collection of people living under his roof, and they’d been through all sorts of things, but Malfoy was the only one who looked this… wounded. The ache hardened though, as Harry remembered Death Eaters roaming Hogwarts, or Malfoy standing behind Umbridge. Malfoy was right to look so troubled; he had done much to feel guilty about.
“Oh right. Sorry.” That did explain why she looked familiar. Still, he wasn’t expected to remember every student from every year—
“Thanks,” Draco said. At least that answered the question about whether Henry had noticed Draco beside him the night before.
“There’s so much,” Malfoy said. “And there’s all this ash, too. I don’t know if we can simply Vanish it all.”
Harry knew this was more than a bog-standard holiday. They had a whole small tropical island to themselves, and the kitchen cupboards were stocked with full meals under Stasis Charms.
Peg Leg Joe was, it transpired, somewhat of a slippery eel, and Harry ended up staying in Devon for the next few days. He barely stopped to eat. He didn’t even get much of a chance to have a cup of tea, but when he did, he thought of Draco, quiet and serious but with a hint of laughter in his eyes. Harry tried to write a note, but just didn’t know what to say in it beyond ‘you were OK to get stuck to’, so in the end sent nothing. By Wednesday he’d got to the point that he could call in back-up to go and raid the Basilisk farm: they found a couple of wizards but nothing that actually resembled a Basilisk. What they had managed to breed Harry handed over to the Beasts Division. He fervently hoped that Hagrid never saw them: Merlin only knew what he’d do with a winged snake.
"Yes, I am. This," said Harry, his head still thrashing from side to side with each slow movement from Draco, "is how I get myself off."
“Sorry,” he said, the merry grin on his face saying the opposite. He wasn’t wearing his trademark glasses, but his lightning-bolt scar was clear enough to see.
“Good morning.” Harry yawned and stretched. “And yes, I am sure.” He smiled, and was rewarded with a fluttering smile back.
“No.” Harry sat back, taken aback by her questions. He didn’t know what to think. “Why would I want to?”
As number twelve appeared from between its neighbouring houses, Harry let go of the whole 'speak to the house' issue, and thought instead about Malfoy's theory that his problems with the house might be linked to the wards. It made sense, but he had no idea how Malfoy was going to fix it. He felt the tingle of energy he normally did when an investigation was midway at work: there was a mystery here, and they were going to solve it. Or Malfoy would, with his pink-tinged cheeks and sharp humour, and that lovely arse of his.
He knew he'd promised to take his time, but there was desperation in the way they kissed, and soon Harry was naked too, sat in Malfoy' lap. His hands were trying to map every inch of Malfoy's pale skin and hard body, all lean and long. With a surge, Harry pushed Malfoy down, his hips moving of their own accord as their cocks slid against each other. They kissed and groped and grabbed.
Draco had seen her give it to Harry, who had nestled it in one of the tea cups on the dresser. He had been aware of the Portkey – a large clothes peg – all evening.
Harry pulled out of the memory, confusion and anger beginning to build. Why was Draco showing him this? He knew that Draco had found it hard after the war. He knew that Draco’s extra year had been lonely, and unhappy. But a lot of people had a tough time after the war. And Harry had needed that laughter, had needed a bit of time before facing the world. He wouldn’t wish it away merely because Draco had been miserable at the time. Harry thought back to his words of the day before. “I didn’t see,” he’d said to Draco, and he hadn’t. He didn’t know what purpose it served to make him see now. Unless it was just to make him squirm.
A strip of wallpaper had become unstuck behind the front door. Each time Harry opened the door, it would flutter down. For some reason – probably the damp – Sticking Charms didn’t work, but at least it wasn’t mouldy. The same couldn’t be said about the front of the dining room, or the back of the wardrobe in Harry’s bedroom.
Draco sat bolt upright. His leg! He was covered with a heavy blanket, but pulled it aside to check his leg. It only throbbed now, no excruciating pain, and it was pointing in the right direction. Draco’s boots weren’t on, and he attempted to wriggle his toes. He saw his socks move, felt the muscles contract and release, with a huge flood of relief.
Draco ground up against Harry, so Harry could feel his growing erection. “Is that the answer you want?”
Liz started. “I’d forgotten that it’s you who make the Snitches. They are very good.” She looked down at the Snitch with the broken wing and blushed. “Sorry about that one.”
“He told me once,” Harry said, and then he was quiet, remembering what it had been like in those moments Dumbledore had taken him into his confidence. How he’d clung to them; how deep his need had been to have answers. With Draco beside him, he remembered too that even on the night he had died, Dumbledore had still believed in Draco. Maybe he’d seen some hint of how Draco could be if he were free from the hold of his family.
In the cool December light, filtered green by the plants on the shelves across the window in their room, Harry felt as though he and Draco were swimming under water. He traced the thin white lines on Draco’s chest with a finger, remembering the day in the bathroom, and the day he’d first seen the scars.
His next batch was for small local teams, and school tournaments. Unlike the specialist Snitches that sold for premium prices, to wealthy wizards, or the precision snitches for the British League, these Snitches would only take a few days to put together. He could make in a day those that went into the home Quidditch kits he supplied to the shops on Diagon Alley and in Hogsmeade, although due to volume it could take up to a week to complete an order.
Harry ran a hand through his hair and took a deep breath. Robards really should have provided some coffee. Every few years some witch or wizard would fancy themselves the next Voldemort and Robards liked Harry to turn up and wave his wand around. “Would you like me to disarm them, sir?”
Madam Pince sits at her desk, along with a neat stack of books. She is not reading – she never does while working. Instead, she is observing the denizens of Hogwarts Library. She watches, taking note of every movement and interaction taking place around her. It is with interest that she sees Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy making their way to the same shelf in the Restricted Section.
The inside of the cabin was gloomy compared to the yellow-green warmth of the forest outside. As Draco’s eyes adjusted he saw a round table by the window to the right, a fireplace set up for cooking at the rear of the room, and a sink to the left of the door. Although ‘sink’ was too formal a word: it was a stone trough with a bucket below, and a wall-mounted container for water above. Cupboards lined the walls to the right, and a heavy dresser filled with mismatched crockery sat to the left. A solitary and very bashed armchair sat beside the fire. Stepping into the room, Draco saw that almost everything in the room was made of wood.
“Of course.” Henry moved towards the kitchen area, and opened a suspiciously bare cupboard. “Are you hungry?” he asked, his head still poking into the cupboard. He looked like he might climb in. “I’ve got some bread. And, er, some cheese.”
, I bet that in your head, and despite telling me to call you Harry, you still think of me as ‘Malfoy’, don’t you?”
“It’s just… twenty-four memories is rather a lot,” Harry said, as gently as he could. “I don’t think I can just sit here and watch them all, especially with you… worrying away next to me.”
The many parts of the Snitches were laid out in front of him: the casing, the perfectly-cut inner gears and balances, and the delicate, frond-like wings. This part of the process was one of his favourites, when the hours he had spent came together to become what was recognisably a Snitch. Using slender tweezers Draco placed the parts together, his hands remaining steady throughout. Who would have thought that this was the lasting gift of his hellish youth, that he could control his body in this fashion, betray no movement he didn’t intend? It had been as though fear, faced so utterly, had left him with a physical calm that nothing could shake.
“You don’t think I’m a crazy-owl-man, do you?” Harry asked Bertie, the long-eared owl. Bertie raised his ear tufts in horror at the suggestion, then hooted and sidled over to the Eddie on the floor, who was playing with the jellied mice. He snatched one up, then flew up to the top of the wardrobe, looking pleased with himself. Beside him Maureen slept on, her heart-shaped face looking peaceful. Her arrival had brought the number of owls in Harry’s attic rooms up to five.
Harry was aware that this was borderline begging, but he had missed Malfoy’s presence, and maybe Malfoy would drink some wine after his cup of tea and do some more of that brilliant laughing, the kind where he threw his head back and all those little worries seemed to fall away. Maybe he’d be OK with the Floo connection, after all.
Draco nodded over at Greg, who put a record on the gramophone. “Dancing, I thought. And maybe the charming Miss Granger could help?”
