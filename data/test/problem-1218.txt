‘At school Miss Pomfrey never had to … disfect wounds.’
‘Draco!’ Nariyoshi says. ‘Look who’s here!’ He beams, assuming the surprise is a pleasant one to Draco, who freezes on the doorway.
‘Don’t the Death Eaters kill Muggles for sport? Isn’t dominance over Muggles the whole fucking point?’ Harry had sat up, too. His attention was wholly arrested by the turmoil in Malfoy’s face, the emotions that ran under his skin, thoughts fighting with each other. What must it feel, he wondered, having everything you believe in crash down around your ears?
Draco comes so hard his mind goes blank.
‘Still. Thank you for trying.’ Harry took a step back and breathed deep. ‘Coming?’
‘Your father-in-law is willing to pay for your return,’ Harry said later that night while Draco was unbuttoning Harry’s breeches and slid a hand inside. ‘Oh god,
‘I think “Bob” suits you. Bobs have a good life, you know.’
‘That’s it!’ Draco had said when they’d left the train at Falmouth. ‘We don’t have magical resources that could stand against him. But what about Muggle ones?’
‘Perhaps it’ll be fine once dry?’ Harry dared to hope.
. But he couldn’t say any of that.
Draco swatted his arm. ‘Stop using that name!’
different.
He pours the soup in a bowl and returns to find Potter in his bed, wearing Draco’s clothes. The sight, although expected, is nonetheless shocking. Potter looks very innocent for someone who could destroy Draco so thoroughly, and Draco hates that life has thrown him in the path of Harry Potter again; he hates that he already feels hungry for him, desirous in a way he isn’t used to, stomach clenching as he watches the man thumb through Draco’s bedside table book, clad in a faded Puma T-shirt.
, and the others laughed. Harry made to rise, but as the train slowed down, pulling up to a bigger station, the ringleader relented. He smoothed the cover and handed it over. When, relieved, the other boy made to grab it, the short one threw it out of the window onto the tracks. Howling with laughter, he hopped off the train, surrounded by his friends. The other boy stared at the ground for a moment, then adjusted the strap of his backpack, and fled, blinking fast.
‘How could you know that? Did you search the
Harry laughed, his fingers tracing circles on Draco’s belly. ‘We got accosted by fans. It was after the interview you gave to Rita Skeeter and everyone wanted a piece of you, the Silver Hero. We ran through the village, chased by shrieking fans, and found refuge in the Sanctuary. The Shrieking Shack.’
. No one breaks without the cracks to show for it.
Draco is breathing hard. Harry shuffles closer, his hand tight on Draco’s arm. ‘I remembered the way you were so terrified after that first time. I wondered why you’d bring me to your flat if I was contagious with flu, when it could seriously endanger Nariyoshi’s health. Then, Ron mentioned the Incubus rumours. I did some reading. The way you reacted at the pub when Neville called Incubi rapists; the dreams; it all added up.’
‘Mr Malfoy, thank you for coming,’ the Headmistress said. ‘Sit down please.’
to take place. The magic holding the alliance together depends on it. I suggest you take the time to get to know him, and maybe you’ll find him… to your taste.’
‘We have no choice. We have an appointment there,’ Harry said. He sank in the couch by the fire and, unable to stop himself, sighed in pleasure at the warmth. Malfoy darted a look at him.
The tsunami that had carried Harry from his bathroom to the Office to the Hebrides to this living room pushed him to his knees, and in one fluid movement he hauled Draco down by his shirt and kissed him. A startled, pleased noise escaped Draco’s mouth, before he kissed back, hands sliding in Harry’s hair. Harry clung on Draco, fisting the fabric of his shirt, pressing him close, as close as he could manage until they lost their balance and collapsed on the ground.
They marched along the road single file as the day brightened. Finally, some good news: now that he knew he was in Cornwall, Harry was certain he could walk to Tinworth; only he didn’t know where exactly Camelford was situated and also how to find Tinworth, since it wouldn’t appear on Muggle maps. Malfoy might know, but there’s no way he’d trust him with his intended destination. As he walked, Harry took out his broken wand from his pouch and then the shard of mirror where he’d seen the blue eye, desperately hoping for the eye to save him again. This time he could only see himself. He decided against attempting to Summon Dobby. He wasn’t even sure if the same magic that tied him to Kreacher tied him to the free elf, but he couldn’t afford the chance that Dobby had been taken, the same way Kreacher had been compromised. The last thing he needed was Death Eaters Apparating along with the elves, while Harry was defenceless.
for me, Harry.’
Having sex for the first time with Malfoy of all people… Someone bearing the
‘I—I need your help.’ Draco wishes he could hide the way his voice wavers. ‘Nariyoshi had to be taken to hospital last night. The…’ Here, his voice cracks. ‘The doctor said he has a couple of months. A few months, and then—’
. He pulled Harry in a sitting position and adjusted his seat against his bent knees. The new angle had him seeing stars. He held Harry tight, a hand buried in his hair, and rode him as hard he could. He wanted to make Harry's first time (and technically his) spectacular, but they were both too far gone to last very long. They came loudly, messily, fingers bruising sweaty skin, lips on swollen lips.
He stopped abruptly, but Harry could guess what the end of the sentence was going to be. He remained rooted on the spot, dust cloth forgotten in his hands. The hints of Draco’s inner turmoil that he’d briefly witnessed the other day had become a flood spilling its banks.
them. So many people were alive; the Weasley twins were even back in school for some reason.’
‘Is that you are alive and healthy,’ the portrait finished for him.
now that Potter had stepped through the mirror. ‘To everyone.’ He’d promised Luna he’d take her to see the baby thestral, and he was meeting Pansy and Blaise for dinner, and he’d agreed to play Quidditch with Theo and Justin later today and—
. He knows his eyes turn black during his climax; he shuts them when he’s with Potter to avoid detection and prefers to take him from behind, but can’t shake the fear that one day Potter might notice.
Harry’s fate had been tied so tightly with Draco’s these days that he hadn’t considered that. For the public,
could fit through it.’
? I wanted the boys at my feet, bound and begging for mercy.’
‘I was hoping for civility,’ Potter insisted, his temper sharpening the edges of his words.
‘Everyone! Well… Muggles do.’
Hope that perhaps he and Malfoy would make it out of this alive.
‘...British Intelligence. Draco Malfoy?’
‘I’ll go tell Susan I’m going out for a bit. Then we can Apparate together.’
Harry is very up for it. His dick is also up for it, and he’s considering suggesting a morning tumble, but he needs to get to work. ‘We didn’t fight last night.’
‘You’re not in that house,’ Malfoy says, and indeed when Harry looks up he’s in his bedroom. He exhales with relief, his hands covering his face. It’s a dream, just a dream, nothing more.
No trace of ambition remains in Harry’s body. He has no desire for the city. He can never run again, so the jobs he’d wanted are out of the question. Not to mention the tremors and the dreams and the shivers. He’d be bringing the war to Ginny, fouling her sweet life with the poison he carries within. The idea alone is enough to make him choke.
‘Hermione can’t stand Patsy,’ Potter said. ‘I find her hilarious. Dean loves her, too; all the Muggleborns do.’ He glanced at Draco again and a blush spread on his cheeks. ‘Ron also wonders what all the fuss is about so, um, we were thinking we could go to a Muggleborn’s house one weekend and watch it. Dean’s mother tapes the show. Or we could go to Justin’s. He has a big house. And you—you could come, if you want. To see Patsy. And Eddie. Well, both of them, really…’
‘Oh?’
‘Hush. I’m right here.’
Cam sighed. He sat heavily on the steps and pulled the little girl to him. ‘Aye, I know. Can’t be too careful, though, can you?’
‘There you are, lovebirds!’
Panicked, Harry called out another set of curses, but the wand let out yellow, rancid-smelling sparks.
Bob isn’t by the lake later. Harry waits until the sun falls, and it gets too cold to sit outside before he makes the tortuous walk to the hospital on his cane.
‘Draw him into the woods,’ Harry whispered to Draco, who nodded. He’d understood.
! — but, as the day’s aches slowly manifested in various parts of his body, he realised that he wasn’t afraid of Malfoy. That he actually felt safe — or rather, not
‘Before you kissed me?’ Draco chuckled when he remembered. ‘I wanted to ask…’ he said, giving him another look of startled wonder, ‘did you only shave half your face this morning?’
‘It sounds like a scam — especially as the young men claimed to be part of the royal family — however, the gold they offered was one hundred percent real, according to a bank teller.’
When he realises that, light seeps in, as if through cracks on the walls, and he can see. With light comes memory: he remembers Uncle Vernon locking him in. Harry hears himself say, ‘I didn’t mean to change the colour of my teacher’s wig!’
here.
Harry laughs again. Draco leans in, wanting to catch the laugh with his mouth, and Harry responds, his lips sweet on Draco’s. Draco has no idea how things came to be what they are — he suspects he has to thank Mrs Li for it — but he knows that the man he holds in his arms has saved him, again. And perhaps Draco has saved him back, a little. Perhaps they both found a way to mend each other’s broken pieces.
Draco laughed with delight. He hovered over Harry and nibbled at his neck and his chest, his tongue swirling around a peaked nipple. His nibbling turned sharper, a shade under painful, but Harry didn’t mind, delirious in his need and helplessly drowning in lust.
him. It felt unreal in the daylight: this was
Harry nodded, trying to suppress the swelling of emotion in his chest. He forced himself to meet Draco’s eyes. ‘I didn’t mean to accuse you earlier… about my friends, and what your aunt did. I didn’t mean to imply it was your fault. I know you tried to help us.’
. But people change. My own fath—’
The tension broke. Harry thrust the vacuum’s nozzle towards him and laughed when Draco scrambled out of the way with a yelp. ‘At least I’m not afraid of the hoover.’
‘So fucking what?’ Draco would still live in the Mirror. Surely his parents would wish him alive.
‘She’s Mirror Hermione now,’ Draco explained to Harry when he saw how unnerved he looked. ‘When we cross over, we replace the Mirror people. Our mind—or consciousness, whatever—takes over their body.’ Having realised that this wasn’t
He sets his glass down. ‘There’s a bar down the road that serves Every Flavour Vodka.’
‘We’re trapped underground, Potter. Who do you think goes spelunking at night?’
Only now did Harry realise the danger they were putting these women in. He glanced at Draco, who seemed to be thinking of the same thing. ‘We should leave,’ Harry said. ‘We should never have stayed here,’ he whispered to Draco.
Draco sniffed the parchment. ‘I need something powdery.’
‘Not everything,’ Potter murmurs beside him, his thumb making soothing circles on Draco’s palm. ‘You also have a boyfriend.’
‘You boys of age?’ she asked, and Malfoy replied, ‘Yes.’
The simple word has an unexpected effect on him. He stares at Potter, startled that he’d deign to plead with Draco. Potter shoves his hands in his jeans’ pockets. He even dressed like a Muggle to come find him.
Dawn entered with two trays and settled them on the coffee table.
‘Harry…’ Harry’s hands hadn’t stopped stroking his hair, and Draco grinned, his face lit with jubilation. ‘Are you telling me you like my hair this way? Longer?’
‘I’ll call you “Bob”.’ Harry sits on the bench beside the man.
not even human anymore…’
After two years of imprisonment, he’d been released from Azkaban with his mother. Draco’s father had died within the first year — from Dementor-induced insanity or warden-induced cruelty, Draco’ll never know — and his mother had been weakened to the point that she needed constant care and an army of Healers. Draco’d spent the little money they had left on private, experimental treatments, but now he knows that even having their old wealth wouldn’t have helped. His mother’s heart had broken when the world she’d known all her life had collapsed, and Draco hadn’t had the skill to mend it.
Upon waking the next morning, Harry stared at the ceiling and wondered if he looked different now. He didn’t
The schedule involved making the house ready for Passover. ‘We’re having seder next week,’ Esther explained over breakfast, ‘and my daughter is coming from London with all her kids.’
‘Hasn’t it occurred to you why that Harry was with you?’
Spell after spell rained behind them as they zigzagged through the forest, crashing through the undergrowth, stumbling on gnarled roots, trampling through the stream. Draco turned to cast a Stupefy; he aimed well, and it shot true, but Rookwood waved it away with an almost careless gesture, a gnat not worthy of exertion.
safe then?’ Harry couldn’t hide the desperation in his voice. He couldn’t bear it if these kind women died because of him.
‘It’ll be nothing really. Not for a man of your… talents.’
‘Place them by the window,’ Draco suggested. ‘Two different windows, north and south would be ideal. And don’t untie them,’ he added as Dawn filled two pint glasses with water for the bouquets.
Oil was sought and found, and soon Draco had one finger inside Harry, biting his lip as he watched Harry writhe. ‘You’ve no idea how glorious you look,’ he said with a careful brush of his finger against Harry’s prostate. Harry arched his back, floundering in an arousal more powerful than he’d ever imagined. Back in London, he’d fucked men in alleys and molly houses, in cheap hotels, and always in secret. He’d never been laid out on a carpet to be offered so much pleasure by a member of the aristocracy. He’d never met a man like Draco, so beautiful and so… unreal—as if Harry had made him up. If this was a dream brought on by hunger, the cold and his imminent death in the forest, then Harry would take it. He spread his legs wider and welcomed a second finger, slender and nimble, insistent and playful, making him see stars.
‘Yep. Nazis believed that North Europeans were superior to everyone else. They hated Jews, the Slavs, the Romani … They decided some people were subhuman, that’s how they called them, and set out to exterminate them.’
‘The Muggleborns in the Mirror world told me. They kept making jokes about it.’ Draco kicked a pebble. ‘We—we were all friends in the Mirror world.’
!’ Wow, Draco really was quite angry. ‘Everywhere we go, we put people in danger. Do you want to draw Rookwood, who’s somewhere out in the moor, to these unprotected women?’
Malfoy had divested him of wand and dagger, the latter pointed at his face by a trembling hand. He shivered, his fancy robes too thin for this weather, flapping in the wind. Harry ignored Malfoy’s dagger and tried to stand up, but couldn’t. His forehead still stung and he felt clammy and weak. He dug his fingers into the soil —
, Dolohov? This is— this is a type of wireless. He tricked you with a
‘You got me,’ Draco lied smoothly. ‘That’s precisely why I wanted to come here today.’ He buried his hand in Harry’s hair and kissed him again, heat pooling in his stomach in anticipation. ‘I love your mouth so much,’ he whispered.
Draco’s gaze was drawn to the group too, but unlike Harry, he didn’t find the sight of the smiling boy charming. ‘He’s going to lose the magazine,’ he said, his eyes on a short, wiry lad.
‘Is it a song?’ Harry asked when Draco stopped.
Warmth spreads in Harry’s stomach. ‘I’m honoured.’
. His hands roved down Draco’s slick back and cupped his arse, which flexed with the effort of grinding against Harry. The bliss swelling inside Harry was an intoxicating potion, as heady and irresistible as the most potent drug. The room filled with their moans and grunts, and finally riding the crest of his climax, Harry came all over their stomachs, his body quivering from the force of it. Draco rose and fisted his cock, and Harry watched avidly, as long pearly ropes of Draco’s spunk rained on him.
Draco glues another shard with the gold lacquer. The vase is taking its old shape with gold seams running where the cracks have been. He holds what he’s pieced together so far to wait for the lacquer to dry; he could do it by wand, but touch is a better way to gauge when it’s ready. His master, Nariyoshi Miyagi Sensei, taught him to trust his hands, along with all the secrets of
Draco crossed his arms and waited.
Harry didn’t stop. ‘You can call him, you know. Get yourself out of this mess. Just touch that little Dark Mark you have on your arm, and he’ll be here in a jiffy.’
‘Whatever, Potter.’
When Harry drew the curtain behind him, Malfoy glared. ‘Well fucking done, Potter.’
‘I think we’re in agreement,’ Potter tells his best friend.
Potter shrugged. ‘Something sarcastic. Scathing. Petty even. I don’t really know.’
?’ Astonished eyes meet Harry’s.
Every afternoon the same patient sits on the bench by the pond, gazing at the willows. Harry sits beside him.
to me,’ Harry says, temper rising. ‘Not anymore.’
‘Is it waiting for a reply?’ Harry asked.
. Harry had enough on his plate without his body’s and heart’s willfulness. He couldn’t allow himself to miss Ginny, her sweet smelling hair and soft lips, or picture Draco’s chest, or Merlin forbid, his
‘If you don’t, I’ll ask him out for you,’ Draco threatened, meaning every word. ‘I’ll tell him how long you’ve been wanting to do it and might even mention those
But Draco wasn’t. He was changing, learning, moving past his prejudice. Harry gazed at his peaceful face, his hair mussed from sleep and sex. Draco breathed quietly and looked so attractive that Harry’s blood simmered with want. He wondered if he was still drunk on sex hormones. He wished he had someone to talk to about this, someone who could tell him how to deal with waking up with an armful of naked boy. What it meant to want to kiss someone so badly that it made his palms sweat and his breath hitch at the thought.
— and thrust something in his palm. The laughter and fair hair faded in the night, and the forest filled with the sounds of branches rustling and nightingales singing — and Draco panting next to him as if he’d run.
With a quick movement, Draco rolled them on the ground and ran his hands over Harry’s chest. Sweat glistened on Draco’s skin and his hair fell damp on his face as he impaled himself on Harry’s cock, moving sinuously over him, his hips undulating in a way that brought waves of ecstasy inside Harry. Harry wanted to close his eyes and lose himself in the sensation, but he forced them open so he wouldn’t miss a second of Draco fucking himself on Harry’s cock. His greedy palms travelled all the way up Draco’s ribs to his shoulders and down to his arse.
‘It’s a stupid game.’
‘I’ve no idea.’
Harry stopped and stared at him. The ocean wind ruffled Draco’s hair around his elated expression.
‘So now, besides Ron,
Stunners flew over Harry’s head, exploding against the stone walls of the cottages. Ducking and zigzagging, they dashed down one alley, then another, trying to put some distance between themselves and the Death Eaters. Down some steep steps; up a cobblestone lane; in and out of pools of streetlight until they reached a junction: three roads branching out to three different directions. Harry paused, uncertain. One wrong turn and they could fling themselves right into Dolohov’s path.
Malfoy chuckles. ‘That’s a word that’s never been associated with me.’
He let a breath out and gave her a smile. ‘Nothing. Your hair is fine, by the way. It suits you long.’ He paused, looking at the person he’d looked down on for years and said, in perfect honesty, ‘I think you look great. And—and I’m glad we’re friends.’
‘What is this, wasting-Pansy’s-time-with-inane-questions? Of course you call her Hermione, that’s her bloody name.’ She noticed his expression and clutched his hand. ‘Perhaps you should have some rest. Whatever the spell was, it’s affected you.’
Later that evening, in Harry’s — now
‘The only thing he rewards is cruelty and blind obedience,’ Draco murmured, lost in thought. ‘And that’s if you don’t make any mistakes.’
A shiny car drives up the house and all the patients gather at the windows to gape at it. ‘It’s a Rolls,’ says Finnigan, a match hanging from his lips. ‘My mate down Cork fixes them.’
Draco turns slowly. ‘How the fuck did you find me?’
Harry dragged his mind from a filthy daydream to focus on Draco’s question. ‘I didn’t, not really. I had no friends while I was growing up.’
Harry lowered his gaze to Draco’s chest. ‘I know regret.’ He didn’t add:
Harry choked and Draco laughed. It was the first unrestrained image of him that Harry had witnessed. It suited Draco; it made him look softer and more carefree, and at that moment Harry wondered for the first time what it’d be like to kiss him.
people.’ His shoulders curled as he spoke, as if the admission gouged him on its way out. ‘I’m one of the others. I’ve done bad things, Esther.
‘Says the person who
Harry inhaled, taking in the smells they shared: the shampoo, the soap, the fabric softener Dawn used — and the one scent they didn’t: that of Draco’s skin. His longing to trace Draco’s neck overpowered him — in the dark he could pretend it was all a dream — and he brushed a finger along the curve of it.
Harry’s mind warned him about everything that could go wrong — about the madness of trusting a Malfoy. But he didn’t like the alternative and he had to admit Malfoy’s suggestion made sense. Besides, Harry needn't mention Shell Cottage. As soon as they reached Tinworth, he’d clear off and leave Malfoy to his own schemes.
His apologetic pout was the most adorable thing Draco had ever seen and Harry could have all the fucking towels in the entire fucking Manor. Draco tried to steer the conversation back to the interesting part. ‘You said something about preparing yourself?’ He glanced around the room and saw on the bedside table, right beside the forgotten textbook, a tube of lube. Industrial size.
‘Didn’t you bang Weasley?’
His eyes are wide on his flushed face, vulnerable and unguarded and full of longing, their familiar grey colour now a midnight black. It’s a shock, but not an unpleasant one. Draco’s eyes are deep like the night sky, startlingly beautiful, unique like the man himself.
‘Hey.’ Malfoy shook him. ‘We need to find a bridge to cross the river if we’re heading east. We’ve got a long way to go.’
He headed to the dungeons, keeping to the shadows.
‘Want a cup?’ the man asks. ‘Nariyoshi,’ he reminds Harry his name, who’d indeed forgotten.
He didn’t. Potter leaned in the touch, smiling faintly, and Draco stroked his jaw and neck, his fingers resting on his fluttering pulse. Merlin, he felt so real.
They waited patiently for her to return, a wait made worse by the overpowering smell of the spices that had them both salivate. Harry rounded the corner and peeked through a window to see a small, tidy kitchen with the remnants of a meal on the red checkered tablecloth, and a vast oven. He returned to the door just as it opened and the lady stood back. ‘Esther says it’s OK. She won’t take your money. Leave your shoes by the door.’
Breathless, Draco lay between Harry’s legs, his cheek on his sweaty belly. He didn’t want to get up. Ever. He was happy to remain there for the rest of his life, thank you very much.
‘I hope it means something good,’ Harry replied, digging in the fragrant sauce.
Draco slapped the hand away.
‘Here,’ the kidnapper murmured, his finger trailing down Draco’s chest. He traced one of the scars all the way to the end, pushing the shirt open some more, exposing Draco’s nipple. ‘This is your reminder of who caused you harm.’
The house stood there, innocently slumbering, as if nothing had happened. But everything had changed. Harry sat on the ground, facing the forest, his back against the fence. Draco settled next to him, his thigh and arm touching Harry’s, both relishing each other’s warmth after the harrowing incident. They hadn’t uttered it out loud, but they remained there, in the cool spring night, sentinels against the enemy. Rookwood could have lived. He could come back.
‘Had?’ Draco couldn’t imagine getting over that fascination any time soon.
Bob raises his head and smiles when he sees that it’s Harry, but there’s nothing joyful in that smile.
It takes ten minutes to unfreeze the chicken broth, bring it to boil, add the noodles and the toppings. Ten minutes in which Draco considers the whole upheaval of his life. He’s fucked. He has no idea how he keeps fucking up, but every decision he makes leads him to a fresh disaster. If Potter figures out what has happened to him — what Draco is — he can have him arrested. Creatures who harm humans are sent to Azkaban, no exceptions.
. We can have weeks together.’
Lying in bed, trying to calm himself enough to sleep, Harry rubbed his scar. It’d tingled for most of the day, but no visions had assaulted him. Draco came in and slid under the covers. Long moments passed with them breathing side by side, staring at the ceiling. Draco’s breaths sounded calm. When he spoke, his voice was level. ‘I don’t know why murder keeps surprising me. You’d think I’d be used to it by now.’
were.’
‘Sword fighting is like meditation.’ The conversation had moved to the things they loved. ‘You let go of everything that burdens you and become one with your weapon. Every movement is calculated, but also unpredictable. Sword fighting isn’t about strength, like people think, but about mental agility.’
Malfoy leans on his desk and crosses his arms. ‘You’re on.’
‘Excuse me.’ The woman’s head lifted slowly and stared at Malfoy, who drawled more imperiously than ever. ‘I was wondering if you could be of assistance.’
‘I want three things,’ he says.
Potter meets his eyes. ‘I hate the fact you were sentenced to Azkaban despite—’ He wisely doesn’t mention how altruistic he’d been, Draco’s not sure he’d be able to restrain himself from decking him.
‘Like a transistor?’
As for the Malfoy name you asked about, the only one I am familiar with is Lord Malfoy, the Earl of Warminster. He’s a Peer in the House of Lords. Not a pleasant sort, from what I gather.
‘Best go for a nap,’ Esther said. ‘We’ll call you for dinner.’
Despite his weariness, Potter gazes at him with a soft smile full of wonder, and Draco flushes under that look. Personal experience reminds him how uncomfortable it feels to have Potter’s attention wholly trained on him, but also how addictive it can be. He’s almost dazzled, feeling feverish himself as Potter’s formidable personality focuses laser-sharp on Draco. He’s rambling so badly that he hardly knows what he’s saying. ‘… and no wizard in their right mind would cut down sentient trees. Those bitches are fierce.’
Harry didn’t want to make him feel bad; he knew commoners didn’t bathe as often as the nobility. ‘Your taste is driving me crazy,’ Harry told him, licking Salazar’s neck.
Harry stayed on his knees, panting. ‘I’m not done with you yet,’ Draco rasped, but he, too, stayed still for some time, trying to catch his breath. He cast a Cushioning charm under Harry, nudged his knees wider and Accio’d the bottle of lube from his locker. Hands shaking, brain shot with lust, he grabbed Harry’s hips and eased his cock inside him.
Bollocks. Draco knew his first kiss with Harry would never be like that. He rose and said, ‘I think it was more like this.’ Pulling Harry to him, he looked at his face in wonder, his heart thumping in his chest, and kissed him.
‘I have gold,’ Malfoy continued. ‘You have Muggle knowledge. We can help each other get there.’
A deafening blast, and Aurors pour into the room. Sue points her wand at them, but her mother catches her wrist and shakes her head. They both drop their wands and raise open palms. As they’re escorted out of the room, Mrs Li keeps her head high and Sue throws Draco a dirty look.
They didn’t meet anyone besides an older woman in burgundy robes with a
Draco took a deep, rattling breath. ‘The Dark Lord is cruel. Some of his followers, too, I suppose. But it’s not all about that. For most, pureblood culture is about preserving wizarding customs, our history and
‘I do. I had one last night actually. You were there, too.’
Harry. I don’t
‘Is that so?’ Draco’s hand travelled down Harry’s arse, slipping inside the cleft of his cheeks.
Draco put his book down. ‘Feeling better? I’ve rang for dinner. You must be starving.’
Draco lay back on the narrow bed and stretched in his naked glory. ‘I can’t wait for a proper double bed,’ he said leisurely, tugging his cock as he watched Harry undress with avid eyes. ‘Imagine what we could do on one of those.’
Draco pulled Harry close. ‘There are some creatures we don’t learn about at school, but all wizards know about them. If you’d asked your friend Weasley, he’d tell you. There’s another type of faeries, older and more dangerous, usually found in the woods of Devon and Cornwall and Ireland.’ He lowered his voice so much that to be heard he had to talk in Harry’s ear. His breath tickled Harry and a shiver ran up Harry's spine. Draco's lips almost brushed his skin as he spoke. ‘Very few of them are left now. If they like you, they will shower riches upon you. They are fond of children, the elderly, and musicians. But they also delight in luring people away from their loved ones, or making them insane, just for their amusement. This is such a forest. That’s why Dawn leaves milk and honey on the fence. To appease them.’ He drew back and levelled a flat stare at Harry. ‘I know you’ll hate me for saying this but: this is part of pureblood culture. We all know these things.’
‘We’ll split up.’
Unlike Dawn’s Cornish brogue, Esther’s accent was hard to place. But before Harry had a chance to inquire, Esther spoke again.
Draco didn't manage to hide the sadness in his voice. Harry hesitated. ‘It’s hard here, you know? It'll take some time before people forget.’
‘Pureblood?’ Draco asked, incredulity creeping in his voice.
‘About us,’ Draco rasped. ‘Tell me about us.’
The memories choke him and he points to the other men. ‘Longbottom; the man knew his way around a garden, I can tell you that. McMillan. Thomas. Goyle, that big lad with the cigarette.’ All are dead or wounded, scattered in military hospitals or unnamed graves. Half his peers gone once the dust had settled.
Harry looked at the captive; a bloated man in his thirties with a cruel mouth. His eyes shone with malice and fear.
The moment feels heavy, pregnant with emotion like a gathering storm, and Harry wants to dispel the clouds. ‘No,
to play with.’
Emotion overcomes Harry. He splays his fingers across the raised, pink skin, as if he can absorb the viciousness that’s been inflicted on it.
‘Lucius isn’t paying,’ Harry’s quartermaster said.
— his acidic tongue, his sharp mind, his deplorable ethics — was obscured by the flesh and blood body that lay so close to Harry that he could feel the curve of Draco’s spine.
‘I, er, liked your horoscopes,’ Potter said when he reached Draco.
‘Or they’ve taken one of the other roads and are trying to trick us,’ said the other wizard.
Absent-mindedly, Harry rubbed his scar. ‘Until
‘Yes.’
. I’m sure it will all come back to me.’
‘My daughters think I’m crazy. But I want to remember. I want to remember how cruel people can be. And how, occasionally, you can find compassion in the most surprising of places.’ She looked at them both and added, ‘Sometimes it takes one person to make a difference.’
A drowsy murmur: ‘We get on. I knew we would.’ Potter clasps Draco’s hand with his, a gesture that tugs at Draco’s chest in its simplicity and trust.
Harry laughs. It’s a sound that Draco has come to love with an intensity that scares him. He’ll do anything to hear the laugh again, to see Harry’s face in a grin, his eyes bright with joy. ‘Did I tell you Nariyoshi’s planning to write a novel featuring “real elves”? He wants to interview your house-elf.’
‘Wonderful! I’ll call Ben right now,’ Esther said. She picked up a gnarled cane lying against the wall and leaned on it to stand up. Draco rushed to help her, but she waved him away. ‘Thank you, my dear. I can manage.’ She shuffled towards the door and paused with one hand on the door handle. ‘You can use our telephone to call your parents and let them know you’re OK. They might be worried.’
’ Malfoy's voice was grim, barely audible among the murmuring river and the birdsong. ‘His parents controlled every aspect of his life. No wonder he went full dark this year.’
be.’ But he’d know Salazar’s scent—or rather,
‘Ha. Ha.’
‘I didn’t mean to startle you. Here’s your water.’
‘Again.’ Draco lowers his head and takes him soft in his mouth. He savours the taste of Harry’s heavy prick, sucking at the glans until he’s fully hard, and swallows him deep.
. All it took was a fleeting touch of fingers inside the cleft of his arse for Harry’s back to arch clean off the bed and come,
Draco nods.
A voice replied to him, something indistinct.
‘Upstairs…?’ Potter’s having trouble focusing. His breathing is ragged.
Shedding secret tears in the hospital corridor while the only person he has in his life is being seen by doctors, Draco wipes his face, resists the urge to smash everything in sight, and remembers — a flash of lightning in the night — that Nariyoshi isn’t the only person in his life anymore.
Draco said, ‘It was for me. Kissing Pansy was an experiment, a failed one. Kissing Theo — it felt better. I prefer kissing boys, I think.’
The next morning, the expensive car rolls up the drive. Its chauffeur jumps out, takes Draco’s valise from his hands, and opens the door for him.
‘What’s Auschwitz?’
Harry opened his eyes and looked at the slanting ceiling above him. He scratched at the cotton duvet, but struggled to find something strong enough to pull him out of his head. His eyes fluttered and once more he fell into the dark—
Footsteps sounded behind him.
‘Fuck the motherfucking rules.’ Salazar raised his goblet and saluted him.
Draco’d gone paler than normal, his eyes shining. ‘I imagine the galleons.’
At the side of the church, the wizards had discovered the walkie-walkie. ‘Don’t touch it!’ the witch cried as Dolohov bent over it. ‘We don’t know if it’s cursed.’
. Aveline gave his ancestor nine children, who all lived. Miraculous, in those days. Not so if they had Creature blood in them.
It was a busy night. Dawn bustled about with her usual efficiency, preparing chicken sandwiches for them and digging an old rucksack out of the attic. Harry and Draco dressed in their Oxfam outfits and gathered their few possessions. Draco retrieved his aunt’s dagger from the back of the drawer he’d hidden it in, and Harry took out all the objects in his purse and gazed at them. The shard of mirror was dark; silent. A reminder of a costly mistake. He lay his broken wand pieces on the duvet, staring at them as if they’d be fixed just because he wanted them to. He put everything back, wore the jacket he’d bought at Oxfam — another costly mistake — and trudged down the stairs, where Esther was waiting for them by the door.
He presented the two galleons and she examined them with interest.
Draco chose that moment to dart from their tree to the next and then deeper into the woods, drawing Rookwood’s attention. ‘Incarcerous!’ he yelled but missed, and Harry, heart in his mouth, dashed after Draco.
. Full of uni students and old people.’
Draco swallows, says nothing.
’ He clasped Harry’s hand fervently. ‘It’s the only way.’
‘I’m sure you do. I’m listening.’
? I can’t talk to Muggles, I’ll say the wrong thing.’
Pansy leaned in. ‘Draco wants to know how to tell one is dreaming. Any ideas?’
Harry had almost finished fixing a pipe in the downstairs loo late that afternoon (gaining a newfound respect for plumbers in the process) when Draco called him. Music drifted from the radio in the kitchen where Esther and Dawn were cooking a particularly fragrant roast; homely, comforting sounds and smells. Harry debated ignoring him, but Draco called him again, more urgently.
Returning with the tea, he tells Nariyoshi to go back to bed. ‘We don’t need to call a taxi for another hour.’
A presenter’s voice drifts in the kitchen from the living room TV; she announces that the voting has started. Nariyoshi’s muttering under his breath about who’s going to get booted. The kitchen timer beeps when the noodles are ready. The familiar sounds of home fortify Draco. He’s led a quiet life these past three years since Azkaban, learning the trade and the Muggle world alongside Nariyoshi, a man who was once a boss and a flatmate and has become a friend and a parental figure. Draco’s not willing to let the life he’s built here go to waste. He’ll fight for it, if he must. Gathering his wild thoughts, a hasty plan takes shape in his mind: look after Potter tonight because he drained him something awful, ask him out, make him fall for Draco somehow, then... have him hand over the figurine? Draco can’t plan that far ahead.
‘By the way,’ she added, getting up to leave, ‘did you know that Potter came to visit you?’
.’ Perhaps Malfoy likes lovers who collapse after sex, because he’s smiling in a wicked, promising way, which thrills Harry to the core. ‘In fact, I’d love to have you again, if you’re up for it.’
The next afternoon, he’s there again. A duck and its ducklings cross the pond, sending ripples across the surface. Birdsong fills the air. Spring has sprung in the gardens surrounding the convalescence hospital. In the fragrant, cool breeze, Harry could be mistaken in thinking France was years ago.
‘Yes. You and me, Ron, Hermione, Neville. The,’ here he rolled his eyes, ‘—Five Heroes.’
he undressed but with those cool grey eyes on him, he felt self-conscious and clumsy. Undressing in front of a man wasn’t a big deal; at work and at sports he typically walked naked around the other men in the changing rooms, but the ethereal presence of the man brought a blush to his face and he ended up tangled in his shirt.
Harry stopped flicking his tongue over Draco’s nipple. Draco quickly amended, ‘Of course it’s a sanctuary. I’m only messing with you.’
‘Then lie back and let me show how much I can give you.’
Just when he thought he might be falling asleep, something touched his waist.
They walked back to the cottage in silence, having forgotten to gather any wood, Harry’s mind whirring after this intrusion of the wizarding world into their safe bubble. Draco had assured him that if the bird returned — if it turned out they could safely use it — Harry could send a message to his friends. Harry longed for it, he desperately wanted to confirm his friends were safe, and to assure them that he’d soon find them. But he also felt torn about leaving this place — and Draco. So selfish of him; and yet he couldn’t help desperately wanting more of the home comforts, the peace of a simple life and the pleasure of touching Draco, who laughed more and more as days went by.
He carried Potter’s bright smile with him as he left for McGonagall’s office.
Perhaps it was saying the ladies’ names that drew Their attention. Perhaps it was the bright light — or simply chance. Music drifted in the air; pretty music, flutes and violins and a gently thrumming harp. It sounded as if it a party was unfolding at some distance, but the notes rang clear, falling like silver rain around them. Rookwood’s footsteps paused.
He’s not sure he himself will be, though.
‘Is that what you tell yourself?’ the man sneered. ‘It’s fascinating how delusional you are. Do you see yourself as a revolutionary? Trying to balance the scale between rich and poor?’
Draco finds it increasingly hard to deny he’s enjoying spending time with Potter. The thrill of seeing the Boy Who Lived on his knees, getting rammed by Draco’s cock, hasn’t faded yet. The memory brings a flush to his face, he can feel it, and he does his best to take his mind off sex and deal with what Potter thinks is an appropriate milestone in their relationship: meeting up with his friends.
Potter gives him a crooked smile. ‘Desperate? I’d call it willing.’ He lowers his voice to a rasp. ‘Very willing.’
Draco clutched him tight, wishing he’d never have to let go. ‘Let’s go to bed.’
. What if it ruins our friendship and we break up and I lose him forever? Or what if he says
Draco dearly wished he had the memory of that day. However, there was nothing to stop him repeating the experience—minus the fans. He walked Harry backwards towards the bed, a sly grin on his face, and shoved him on the embroidered cover. ‘Let’s pretend I don’t remember.
‘Ah, that explains a lot,’ Dawn murmured to her stitching.
The whole thing had lasted less than two minutes. The conductor whistled; the doors shut and locked. The train left, a young man with a briefcase standing where the schoolchildren had been.
‘Would you like to?’ Draco’s voice was barely audible.
‘It’s fine. We have bigger problems.’
Harry, he pulled his arm free. ‘I’m not going back.’
Draco shifted. He blinked, blearily taking in their nakedness, their tangled legs, the rumpled sheets. His voice was gruff from sleep. ‘You realise that, according to pureblood customs, we’re now married?’
It was still there. A first-year student was smoothing his hair in front of it. He turned and flushed when he saw them. ‘Hi, Silver! Diamond!’ As he passed them, Draco noticed a badge of the Five Heroes on his school bag.
‘Three more days and you’ll be in your fancy residence,’ Harry said.
Draco’s breath brushed Harry’s ear. ‘Now the trousers.’
Harry hovered over him and brushed his lips against Draco’s.
At a second glance, the differences—lots of little details—emerged. It was like those pictures in the children’s section of the
‘Can you stop taking things from my hands?’
‘The Shrieking Shack was a sanctuary,’ he informed the former Headmaster. ‘Who would have such a desire about a derelict building? The owner?’
Draco stood so still he might have been frozen. Harry finished patching up the Splinched shoulder. ‘We’ll need to clean it again tomorrow. Just in case.’ He glanced at Draco’s flushed face and neck. ‘I think the infection might have given you some fever. You look warm.’
Harry got the feeling Draco saw him as some sort of superhero.
Harry sipped his drink, his eyes on the man. ‘Are you not from around here? I detect a hint of an accent.’
. Did you have to stick the wand up its nose?’
It’s pitch dark. Harry stretches his arm and touches walls. The space is very narrow. It smells musty but familiar.
‘You are aware that no Muggles will be strolling anywhere near the Forest?’
‘Sorry.’
Esther exchanged a glance with Dawn. ‘Orphans. I wondered.’ She left the kitchen and Harry blinked twice before he carried on with the washing up. Beside him, unmoving, Draco gazed out of the window, the kitchen towel still in his hands.
He was babbling but he couldn’t help it. The pleasure of watching Harry coming undone, his swollen lips open in bliss; the slaps of skin against skin; the potent smell of sweat and sex; the taste of Harry’s lips were more than he could bear. He tightened his hand on Harry’s rock-hard cock, making him come in long spurts over his belly, and then with a final, deep thrust, Draco came inside him, his eyes rolling back in his head.
. Harry clenched his fists. Draco’s terminology wasn’t the worst thing; no, the worst was that he looked as if he’d said something sane. ‘Remember the Quidditch World Cup shenanigans? How did that
‘We’re talking,’ Harry offers. ‘About you,’ he adds to tease Malfoy.
Dumbledore smiled sadly. ‘Indeed it won’t. It’s too dangerous an artefact to be allowed to remain in contact with the public.’ He surveyed Draco with kindness. ‘Unfortunately, we don’t always get what we want in life.’
Harry pulled Draco’s cloak off and threw it on the armchair, too. ‘I thought this was your present. Coming back here—’
‘Come on, Draco, fuck me already,’ Harry groaned, spreading his legs wider.
‘How are we going to do this? Me or—
Bob seems restless. ‘What kind of lives do Bobs have?’
Harry examined Malfoy’s profile in silence. He couldn’t understand why he was being helpful, except to assume he had an ulterior motive. ‘I’m going to find out where we are,’ Harry said, setting off across the field. Wordlessly, Malfoy followed him.
Draco bit his lip, but replied honestly. ‘There are four more. Eighteen altogether.’ He glanced up at Harry, who hadn’t stopped tracing the skin on his back. ‘Eighteen presents for every birthday that your family ignored.’
‘Would that involve you putting on a sexy nurse’s outfit?’
‘I wanted to apologise in person. Also…’
‘Is it cursed?’ Draco asked.
‘Harry wouldn’t give anyone up,’ Draco said. ‘He’d fight. He’d hatch a harebrained scheme and somehow make it work against all odds, and he’d get everyone to safety and… and possibly kill some bad guys in the process.’
Potter held his wand aloft, lighting the way, and Draco followed, his heart numb and racing at the same time. He kept touching his forearm, and his heart swelled with longing; a longing that hurt like a stab wound, because it just couldn’t be true. Even in his dreams, he always had the Mark. He suspected it was part of its magic: ensuring the wearer never forgot their allegiance to the Dark Lord, even when asleep. It also meant that Draco could never find solace. He wasn’t allowed to forget—not even in his dreams—of his worst mistake.
So their relationship wasn’t a secret. Draco couldn’t resist to gloat. ‘More like I kept him up, Pans.’ He served himself some tea and a healthy amount of eggs and bacon. He was famished. Possibly because of all the sex he had. He smiled to himself. He couldn’t stop smiling.
They were at the broom shed after a game of Quidditch, and Draco stared incredulously at Harry, who was trying to hide his irritated expression. ‘What bothered you about me saying you fucked me against that wall?’
of you, and your precious Mr Miyagi, alone and uncared for, will most likely die. Surely you don’t want all that to happen because of some misguided notion of honour?’
Shortly, they arrived at a sign that read:
. Every time I let my guard down, when I reach for a trophy in the middle of a maze, someone ends up
‘See you later, guys, alright?’
For a second, everything stilled: the crackling fire, the wind rattling the windows, Draco’s heart. And then sensation flooded in, heating every part of Draco, and everything became too bright, too loud, too vivid. His heart thrummed as he stared at Harry’s green eyes. ‘I love you, too.’
‘Oh, I wouldn’t know.’ She gestured at his robes. ‘I guess you need a valet to help you wear — whatever this is. Were you at a special event?’
They hadn’t agreed to anything other than reaching Tinworth together when they’d made their plans in Camelford. Back then, it went without saying that they’d go their separate ways when they arrived at the magical village, but now things had changed. Harry feared that Draco had hoped they’d stick together for longer, and judging by Draco’s reaction now, he was right.
, Lucius. You’re mistaken if you think I’ll allow you to leave this residence again. I’ll let you keep your lives, which is more than you deserve.’
. He thrusts his tongue insistently inside the snug heat, a growl escaping his mouth as he tries to reach deep inside Draco, as deep as he can. Draco lets out an astonished, wild sound; he bucks his hips, and Harry has to hold him tight.
‘You look calmer,’ Potter comments when he shuts the door behind them. ‘Tea?’
Draco resents the implication. ‘And vice versa.’
‘What?’
‘Where are you?’ Harry took some steps deeper in the forest, and there! A golden head disappeared behind the trunk of a slender birch. ‘What are you doing?’ Baffled, Harry hurried to the tree. He could smell Draco, too; that same scent of rain and wood and lightning, although underneath it there was something cloying and floral and a hint of rot. The forest, probably.
‘Shush! Listen!’
And Malfoy gives him a good fucking. He buries himself inside Harry to the hilt, and thrusts and
was the smuggest expression Harry ever saw on Draco Malfoy. ‘Better not die yet,’ Draco said and arranged himself next to Harry, his erection bobbing, hard and glistening. ‘You’ve got to get me off too.’
‘Who’s this, Draco?’
Harry had no idea how long they kissed. Minutes, or hours maybe — or years. Time meant nothing when the world had become Draco’s warm mouth, his slick tongue, his plump lips. Draco’s hand found its way into Harry’s hair, caressing it with delicate movements. As if Harry was a fragile thing to be handled with care. The tightness in Harry’s chest dissolved, a knot unravelling that made it a little easier to breathe. Warmth and pleasure soothed earlier aches and worries. Harry felt terribly aroused, his cock straining against his bottoms, but more than anything he felt warm and pliant; a dough Draco could knead into star shapes if he wanted to.
Draco held his breath. He whispered, ‘You want me to fuck you?’
‘What do you mean?’
Draco climbed up and shuffled until he reached the back wall. Harry followed, leaning against the sun-warmed slats beside him. A beetle scuttled across the floor.
Look at him now. Instead of ruling the magical world, Draco is sharing accommodations with a fifty-eight-year old Muggle. Life has swept him from promised glory to a plastic chair in a foul-smelling corridor surrounded by sick people. Illness has a taste that makes him break out in hives; as Incubus, he doesn’t get sick now, but he can sense disease. It helps him avoid feeding from people with chronic conditions, who’d be severely affected by the draining of their energy.
The man looks away. ‘Nothing. I remember nothing.’
‘Is that what that torch was?’ She probably meant Rookwood’s Lumos. ‘Where are they now?’
‘No.’
At that moment, Harry would give him
Draco.’ He dragged Draco’s shirt off and buried his head in his neck. Draco smelled clean even after being on the ship for almost a month. No sailor Harry ever met had smelled this way, and it drove him mad with desire. He sucked on Draco’s neck, listening to his moans, and his cock hardened under Draco’s ministrations.
All the wand did was emit a thin column of acrid smoke.
He says the last one out loud. ‘I love you.’ It’s only been a couple of months, but does it matter? Harry knows what he feels, and he won’t shy away from it.
Harry grabbed him and kissed him hard. ‘I’ve a plan. Now fuck me like you mean it, Governor.’
‘Tell me about the hot man,’ Draco suggested. He took Harry’s hand and stroked his palm.
His fears and doubts fled at the sight of Draco fingering himself, replaced by a wave of arousal. Harry crawled over Draco and smothered his cock with oil. He replaced Draco’s fingers with his own, lubed ones, and sank them in the hot, sweet heat of his arse. ‘I don’t mind the bed,’ he said. ‘But I’d give anything for a whole night with you.’
‘Yes, but there’s some political unrest back in England right now and Malfoy Senior’s backing that politician everyone talks about…’
He let go immediately and Draco stepped back, his face pink.
owe her. And she knows all about him.
, Harry concentrated on the feeling of another person’s fingers, warm and rough, against the sensitive foreskin. He breathed heavily, his eyes fluttering as wave after wave of pleasure surged through his veins. He’d no idea it was like this, no fucking clue. He buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, sniffing greedily at his scent, familiar and thrilling at the same time: wood and wet grass and lightning; like playing Quidditch during a summer storm.
Malfoy comes over with a pint and a colourful cocktail, complete with rainbow umbrellas and a glazed cherry. Before Harry has a chance to take the piss about Malfoy’s choice of drink, the bastard slides the concoction to him with a devilish smirk.
‘So what was it you wanted to show me?’
‘Sit, Draco — you don’t mind if I call you Draco, right?’
This world was fucked up. It had pain and grief and sick people and dead people and stupid decisions and bad hair days and fear and regret—although it didn’t have Smith in leather gear, which was something. It also had Harry Potter, who buried his face in the crook of Draco’s neck, and who liked
‘You look happy,’ Pansy commented. He turned to her with a grin, but a voice interrupted him. ‘Hey, Draco!’
Granger replied automatically. ‘Events jump from one to the other with no logical sequence; locations might change in an instant; you can’t see people’s faces even if you know who they’re supposed to be. The best reality check, some say, is to look at your hands and count your fingers. In dreams, hands aren’t right for some reason.’
There they were, in their velvet robes, standing out among the Muggles. Both men glanced at the station and the road and conversed quietly. Harry couldn’t hear what they said, but one of them pointed to the town and the other one in the other direction. They split up. Harry returned to Malfoy, who looked paler than he’d ever seen him, and pointed at the hedge behind the station. As quietly as they could, they headed for the nearest opening and hid behind the hedge, Harry’s heart beating so loud that he could swear Rookwood would hear it.
When nothing happened, Harry taunted, ‘
Anxiety radiated out of him in waves, and Harry stepped back and let him finish.
‘I… guess? Aurors and Dark Wizards, Wizards and Muggles, there are loads of them. But the most popular game when we grew up was Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. All the kids loved it. One would be Potter and the other would be the vanquished lord. I always wanted to be Harry Potter, and I mostly got my way.’
‘What do the nurses call you?’ Harry asks.
Granger assumes what must be her lecture tone. ‘Incu
Draco swallowed. He cast a glance at the portraits, which stared in rapt attention. ‘I was afraid they’d—’
Draco turned his face towards the direction of the spell-casting. ‘I knew you’d come,’ he whispered, closing his eyes in relief.
Malfoy smirks. ‘Patience, Potter. You’ll get what you need in good time.’
. It was curiosity — who’d say no to the Chosen One? But a taste wasn’t enough, the sight of Potter writhing him below him as addictive as any potion. It had given him a dark and profound pleasure to see his old rival shudder as he plunged his cock inside him; to hear Potter moan in ecstasy, because of
‘I know,’ Draco assured him, eating a piece of cheese. ‘I got a letter this morning from my mother complaining that the bells haven’t rung.’
Draco’s eyes brimmed and he blinked fast, controlling his face as he always did, masking his emotions under a half-arsed sneer. ‘As if you’d know. Gryffindor’s shining hero.’
Malfoy stared at him, eyes growing cold. ‘Maybe he’ll reward me if I give you to him. Maybe you’re lying.’
‘I didn’t think we could get more fucked, but it appears I was wrong,’ Malfoy said as they waded out. He held their loaf for inspection. It was soaked and completely disgusting.
‘Don’t see what we have to lose.’
It’s the last day of June, and Harry walks down the lane from the hospital to the village. He hasn’t told Ginny nor anyone else that he’s been discharged. He’ll take a train to Devon to where Bathilda lives. An old friend of his parents’, Bathilda’s assured Harry he can stay with her at any time and for as long as he wants.
Harry deflated. If he’d had to marry a stranger
A murmur beside him made him turn slowly to his left. He encountered an obstacle: a warm body pressed against his side, dark hair in his eyes and a leg tangled with his.
It’s time to give Potter a
They stumbled around a little, delving deep into the woods. The foliage hid the stars and they’d left the river behind them. Harry wasn’t sure they were even going south. They could be walking in circles, haunted by almost-heard sounds and almost-there touches.
It was time. Harry took out the walkie-talkies and set one handset down in one corner of the street, diagonally to the pub. With the other held in his clammy hand, he clambered over the church fence, Draco right behind him. An Alohomora allowed them inside the darkened church. Its stone walls held no warmth; Harry rubbed his arms to dispel the chill.
He’s been there before.
Eventually, he let go and flopped back on his pillow, taking deep breaths.
‘Shut up and put that mouth of yours where it belongs.’
He led Harry to a drawing room where the fire roared, gilding the faded furnishings and pushing the shadows deep in the corners. A novel was face down on the sofa and a crystal glass, half-full of deep red wine, rested on the side table. Draco brought Harry in front of the fire, who exhaled with relief at the caress of the heat against his wet, icy skin.
‘What did you see?’ Draco asked, climbing into bed.
Yep, this was real Draco alright.
‘It didn’t?’ Harry’s voice dripped with sarcasm. ‘Sure.’
Their drinks are forgotten as Malfoy speaks. ‘Other times I was naked and… and there were men—’ He doesn’t continue that line of thought, but Harry can guess what he means. He shudders.
starving. What do they get wrong?’
‘Draco never paid any attention to history. Terrible student,’ Harry said quickly. He laughed. Ha. Ha.
Harry smiled at his playful tone. Whatever mood Draco had entertained on the way home persisted in his eyes, but he seemed determined to make an effort. Harry intertwined his fingers with Draco’s. He had beautiful hands. ‘He was just a fisherman,’ he explained. ‘It thrilled him to sail in stormy weather. Said “it was battling something far more powerful than you” and “knowing you might not make it, but still giving it your all”. He—’ Harry shook his head. ‘You know, I think he might’ve been a little mental.’
Draco remained silent for a moment. ‘Make a big announcement we’re there so they won’t bother with this area anymore. I see.’
Hermione rolled her eyes. ‘I think I prefer Skeeter’s libelous articles to these horrid nicknames.’
; he fears his muscles have turned into liquid, except for his aching cock, hard as rock, which sends electric pleasure from his scalp to his toes. The memory of dream-Malfoy arises from the haze of his desire.
Harry didn’t reply immediately. ‘It does my head in, sometimes,’ he murmured, staring at the trunk with the balls. ‘The other Harry sounded very… confident and—I don’t know. Cool. Together. Carefree. I’m none of these things.’
Harry says, ‘I’ve got a train to catch.’
‘My lovely brute…’ Draco said a few moments later, untied and in Harry’s arms, lips swollen from kissing.
‘You need fattening up, both of you,’ Dawn said. ‘You’re too skinny, you are.’
The lady’s eyes widened.
‘Shut up. See.’ Harry pressed a button and the local ITV News came on. ‘This is the news. And here,’ he pressed more buttons, ‘is a soap opera and here another soap opera. We can choose which one to watch.’
In the locker room showers, he let the warm water run over his skin and half-listened to the conversations around him.
‘This can work, you know.
‘Please, Harry, please…’
Draco stepped out of the Manor’s drawing room fireplace, not knowing what to expect. He needn’t have worried. His parents were alive and well and, surprisingly, not dissimilar to the real world. His father bore the Dark Mark; but then again, he probably hadn’t regretted taking it as much as Draco did.
‘Are you expecting something?’ Esther asked Draco, who had paused watering the plants to stare out the window again.
Malfoy glared. ‘I’m more than happy to stab you myself, don’t get me wrong, but the counterjinx won’t work that way. You have to be
‘Really? I always found it rather pleasant,’ Harry said.
, Draco Malfoy.’
It was much easier to be honest with himself when he was very happy.
‘Oh, you poor thing,’ said the man. ‘Let’s get you in and warmed up.’
Harry’s blood chilled and he shared a terrified look with Malfoy, but he had no more time to contemplate the murder Rookwood spoke of so casually, when the dogs burst in furious barks.
‘You idiot!’ Draco grabbed him — from
‘… but Draco refused! Whatever he was like at school, whatever we thought of him, he still had enough sense to say no.’ Dean’s voice heated up. ‘If you ask me, everyone who took the Dark Mark was an utter
Draco snorted at his words and lifted his head. ‘
‘Okay,’ he interrupted Potter, who’d launched into the history of British teevee. ‘I’d like that.’
Harry fell back on his pillows, ignoring the shuddering breaths next to him. A moment later, the side of the bed dipped. Soft footsteps and a creak at the door told him that Draco had left the room. Harry wanted to go after him, he wasn’t sure why, but experience told him he should perhaps leave him well alone. He knew Draco simply parroted his parents’ beliefs, and he could see the effort he’d been making to readjust his thinking, but still, hearing those arguments made Harry’s temper — always a hard beast to tame — rise to the surface.

, was that Zacharias Smith in a leather collar? Draco hadn’t expected it from a
‘Pull them down yourself,’ Draco said and kissed him.
‘How did you make sure?’ Harry asked.
what to do, it’s just that—’
The doctor finally pronounces him fit to leave. ‘You might even walk without a cane,’ he says, ‘once the knee’s mended enough.’
Neither of them spoke while Harry cleaned the long cut, touching it softly with one hand. The other hand found its way to Draco’s bare waist, for balance, as he drew Draco to him to reach the back of his shoulder. Draco breathed heavily and for a brief moment — so brief that Harry thought he might have imagined it — he laid the side of his head against Harry’s.
Draco gazes at him, overwhelmed by— he doesn’t want to think of the word. For now, he’ll call it gratitude. His voice quavers only slightly. ‘Thank you, Harry.’
Potter sends him an incalcitrant look but obeys. He sucks Draco off like a champ, his tongue swirling around the head, his left hand rolling Draco’s balls with gentle fingers.
‘Let’s go back,’ Harry murmured, and hand in hand they trudged back to the cottage.
‘Good evening,’ Malfoy said, who took it upon himself to be the spokesperson after the resounding success they had in Camelford. ‘We’re sorry to trouble you, but we’re looking for somewhere to stay and perhaps some dinner. We were hiking and lost our way and we only have two — what was it, Potter? — we have two
Now he knows Potter’s more than the gilded hero Draco had thought he was. He’s witnessed him terrified and distraught in his night terrors; he’s seen the weight Potter carries. Draco has been privileged to peek inside Potter’s heart and see the cracks that run through him; his broken pieces held together by a thread of gold, Potter’s fiery will. If things were different… Draco’s eyes smart again. If things were different, he’d never have approached Potter, and that would have been the end of it.
‘It’s my turn now, Potter.’
Sweat cools on his skin. Harry opens his eyes and takes in the dark room. He’s alone in sticky pyjamas, and Grimmauld Place is as quiet and empty as it’s been these past couple of years since the divorce. He exhales. He’s as relieved as he is disappointed to realise that he hadn’t got blind drunk, pulled Malfoy in a pub and brought him home. It was simply a wet dream. A very realistic,
‘I’m going to try and make it to Tinworth,’ Malfoy said, balling up the wrapping. He tossed the ball in the nearest bin and gave a small smile when it landed neatly inside. ‘It’s a wizarding village in Cornwall. There’s bound to be someone there who can fix my wand — or at least, a second-hand wand shop.’
‘Sorry, I didn’t—’
Harry’s heart clenched every time he looked at Draco. He’d
why I grabbed you, Potter. I’d rather lose an arm than my wand.’
‘He won’t come,’ the servant said in the end, taking the paper.
that’s making Draco obstinate rather than his reluctance to accept orders. He’d thought, after Voldemort and after Azkaban, that he was free, but here he is, beholden again to someone whose purposes he can’t fathom.
Harry’s certain he can detect some forced casualness at Malfoy’s reply. ‘I—I get them sometimes.’
‘Off you go, nothing to see,’ Annie called to the small crowd. ‘Cam, the Stanleys will be keeping watch all night, and we’ll take their kid. Their vardo will be empty. Do you think—’
‘If it won’t make much of a difference, it doesn’t matter if I do it, right?’
‘Tick tock, Draco.’
‘Draco!’ She lowered her voice. ‘You know I can’t. We’re
Potter said, ‘In the mirror, you called me Harry.’
Draco knew what Harry liked. He licked his ear and cupped his cock and trailed fingers on his thigh the way Mirror Harry liked, and was pleased to discover that real Harry responded as beautifully as his other self to Draco’s ministrations. Before long, they were both panting, trousers unbuttoned and hands everywhere.
know that Muggles can hold conversations across the planet? When Esther wants to, she can speak to her daughter in Australia in real time.’
He was still awake when Draco came into the room, his nipples mercifully covered by the Joy Division t-shirt he wore in bed. He was humming a melancholic melody as he climbed under the duvet.
‘Ineffectually.’
Malfoy leaned on the elm they were sheltering under. ‘No. They’ll be able to sense a general direction if they do it again, and that’s only if they haven’t used up all the blood. The incantation burns it off.’
‘Madam Pomfrey,’ Potter said, ‘there’s something wrong with Draco.’
‘Mine is inconsequential. It doesn’t feed me or affect you. Bring your mouth back here.’ Draco latches his lips on Harry’s again, sinfully hot, and Harry loses himself in the kiss and his fierce, questing hands. Draco’s bucking against Harry, breathless already, making mewling sounds of need.
‘Am I like him?’ Harry asked quietly, probably thinking the same thing.
By the time Draco’s done, mid-morning has come and gone. The lift takes him to Level Nine and the gleaming door that hides the world’s mysteries — including that notorious figurine.
‘Yes?’ Harry asked politely.
Shukar raklo= handsome non-Roma boy
‘Tough shit.’ Having put a few feet distance between them, Harry turned on the spot before Malfoy could rush him, thinking of his destination, but nothing happened. He spun again urgently, concentrating on Shell Cottage, but the magic failed him. Malfoy slowly rose to his feet, and Harry pointed the wand at him and cried, ‘Stupefy!’
‘I just wanted my fucking wand back, Potter.’
Harry must have taken the request as foreplay. He paused between words to trail small kisses on Draco’s neck and jaw. ‘We’ve been seeing each other for over three months now. I mean, we flirted during the war, but we only got together here. First week. I just couldn’t keep my hands off you anymore. The coup had been overthrown, Voldemort was gone, we’d received our medals
Draco, the Death Eater Draco, and that made everything worth it.
Regular sex with Harry has kept Draco’s hunger at bay these past couple of weeks, but it’s a desire for celebration that drives him to Grimmauld Place late in the evening, after he’s taken a delighted Nariyoshi around Diagon Alley and then home to rest. Draco bangs on the door and jumps on Harry as soon as he opens it.
‘My valet,’ Malfoy confirmed. He leaned close to the woman and said in a confidential tone, ‘Rather an inexperienced one, and still
They raced for several miles neck and neck until the fishing villages by the coast appeared in the horizon. Draco led his horse to a copse of trees and dismounted.
The Roma bustled around, hitching Thestrals to the caravans, dousing the fire, packing their belongings. The lady who’d washed their hands was dismantling the wards, and the fox Animagi were returning, climbing inside the vardo Harry and Draco had just vacated. The Stanleys, Harry assumed.
‘Do you carry it with you?’ Harry asked.
‘Look at me, Draco,’ Harry rasps. His thrusts increase in intensity.
‘Why is it so hard for you to get the fuck out of my face and stay there?’
The next time Draco’s hand travelled over the waistband of his bottoms, Harry let his legs fall open. As imperceptibly as possible — but Draco inhaled sharply and Harry knew he’d noticed. Harry squirmed “sleepily”, his head settling against Draco’s shoulder, his pelvis flat on the bed, an open invitation. He remained there, hoping Draco would understand what he’d meant:
‘I don’t know what’s wrong.’ Confusion and worry creep in Potter’s voice as he stares at his hands.
‘I wanted to try using the wand,’ Harry replied. ‘Best not do it in the house.’
‘You’re mine,’ Harry repeated breathlessly, driven by a need to
‘The prize is in the brig. Gotta warn you. He’s got a mouth on him.’
‘That’s how great it feels when you fuck me,’ Harry says conversationally, stroking Draco’s prostate.
In the end, he fell asleep before Draco returned.
The way Draco moved his hips when Harry fingered him was absolutely sinful. ‘
‘How did they find them?’ he asked, raising his head to gaze at Draco for the first time today.
‘A… friend. Unwell. Going to get him to bed. Make him some soup.’
‘Yes.’ Harry doubted they’d been Obliviated. No, the Muggles were most likely killed, simply because they happened to be near Harry. He knew he shouldn’t feel responsible for these deaths, but he couldn’t help adding them to the tally that weighed around his heart, constricting it like a chain.
‘Eat?’ Harry asked, voice low. ‘I’ll
‘I’m not following
The procedure doesn’t take too long. It feels good to be doing
Dolohov, his face livid, nodded. He wrapped the walkie-talkie in a handkerchief and removed the Anti-Apparition spell. ‘Send for me if you find them. Immediately.’
‘But he was hot,’ Draco smiled.
‘When I say so. When
Draco’s breath refused to come. He couldn’t stop his eyes from straying to Potter’s chest, his dark pink nipples, the trail of hair at his navel disappearing down his jeans. ‘How did you get in?’ he managed to utter.
Draco lifted his eyes and narrowed them immediately. Weasley approached them and raised his hand. Draco tensed, fearing an attack, but Weasley was going for a high-five. Numb, Draco high-fived him so lamely that Weasley guffawed.

— and—’
That night Draco’s in high spirits. The exhilaration and relief he’d felt that day, after Nariyoshi was taken to St Mungo’s and received a few vials that made an immediate improvement, still courses through his veins. He’s dancing with joy inside. This is a victory; a change in his fortunes, like picking up a card when the game’s almost lost, and seeing it’s a King.
‘It’s our fault they’re dead,’ Draco murmured.
‘This is Esther,’ the first woman explained. ‘Dear me, you’re soaked,’ she said, taking their jackets.
‘Stop it.’
‘But I don’t,’ Draco said in an empty voice.
like to see a Romani with a wand. Don’t sell ‘em to us. The ones we carry got handed down for generations. Wouldn’t work for anyone else now.’ She’d rinsed him off and stepped back, looking satisfied. ‘Now you can eat.’
Esther said, ‘I can’t promise you it will be OK. It might not be. I know that very well. Bad things can happen to good people. But we can’t live in fear.
Draco sat lower, taking Harry’s cock inside him inch by inch. ‘This is how we’ll do it when I fuck you,’ Draco said. ‘It’s the best position for the first time. You taught me that.’
‘Well, Albus? Why is it fascinating?’ a sour man on the top left wall called.
‘They’ll heal,’ he says. ‘Don’t pity me. I deserved those.’
When he rounded the birch trunk, Draco wasn’t there either. Frustration rose inside Harry at Draco’s stupid games. ‘Not
‘Seventy percent? That’s not—’
Harry stared at him walking ahead with long strides and a straight back. He wondered whether Malfoy regretted his hasty decision to regain his wand. Harry’s brain, rested and calmer, reminded him of Malfoy’s refusal to identify Harry; the fear in his eyes when he saw the prisoners. He remembered how Malfoy’d offered the chocolate; a startling gesture of kindness that Harry hadn’t thought possible coming from him. Malfoy marched ahead, and Harry wondered if he felt as lost as Harry did; if he felt as unmoored, drifting down a swift current to a likely fatal end.
‘Cry me a river,’ Harry said, full of contempt. ‘Don’t expect any fucking sympathy from me. You made your bed and now you’re sleeping in it.’
‘Is that why you won’t stay?’ Esther asked.
‘Well, it’s the trend these days, isn’t it?’ Potter smiled. ‘I couldn’t be the only Leo who’s not painted his nails. Even Neville’s gone for green, same shade as his favourite plant. Besides, I think it suits me.’
Draco.’ Rookwood took his time coming closer, gleeful in his victory. ‘The Dark Lord knew you were helping Potter, but I bet he had no idea what you
Changing the subject helped distract him. ‘When in doubt, blame the French,’ Draco quipped and Pansy laughed. They spent a pleasant half an hour, discussing Blaise and any acting talent he might have concealed from them. Pansy took care to avoid mentioning any names that might upset Draco. Until the end.
‘No,’ Draco objected. ‘He
cast the spell, not us. We can’t take—’ But he couldn’t continue. He didn’t believe it. His heart protested too loudly. If he hadn’t walked in that shop, the ladies wouldn’t be dead, simple as that. How do you escape this kind of truth?
‘Some technology is even better than magic,’ Harry said.
the real world. So they went to lessons.
‘Take off your clothes,’ was the first thing Harry said that night. His voice sounded gruff, as if he hadn’t used it in years.
. It’s relentless, unstoppable, and Harry gasps and moans as Malfoy fucks him hard. Harry’s cock slides hot against the bed and he bites his lips and fists the sheets. Saliva drips down his mouth as Malfoy bunches his arse cheeks and spreads them wider.
‘Come out, come out!’ Rookwood crooned. ‘Come out, and I won’t hurt you. A lot.’ He cackled at his own joke and cast a bright Lumos, dazzling Harry and drenching the woods with light. Draco crouched behind a birch and aimed another spell, but although the spells reached their target, they didn’t seem powerful enough to affect him.
They continued gathering wood, and Draco also picked some flowers, creating two bouquets. Harry didn’t know what to think of it: was this what Draco was like? Was it another unspoken pureblood custom, a “walk in the woods, gather flowers for ladies” sort of thing?
Harry had spent the days before his wedding drinking with a fervour that resembled someone going to the gallows. Meanwhile, he enquired about his future husband. Every report described Prince Draco as a scholar, a man of learning and discipline. Draco sounded like the type of person who spent nights bent over parchment, a single candle by his side. The exact opposite of Harry, who enjoyed hunting, horse riding with his knights, and drinking in taverns till oblivion. Harry commanded troops; he knew how to wield a sword and how to kill a man with it. At his most pessimistic, Harry pictured his betrothed as a weedy man, sallow-skinned from being indoors all the time, dull as paint.
. Nothing matters more than the pleasure building under his feverish skin. Malfoy’s cock is hard and slick, and he’s pumping, again and again, deeper and deeper until he lifts Harry, sets him on all fours and thrusts inside him so deep that Harry shuts his eyes and comes.
Draco watches in numb horror as Potter’s hand trembles as he lifts the spoon. He’s worse than he’d thought. ‘Let me do that, or you’ll make a mess.’
‘Hey,’ a soft voice said in his ear.
‘I came to apologise.’
Esther curled his hand around the note. ‘We won’t starve for a twenty. It’ll ease our hearts to know you have a little cash with you.’
The implication of what he was suggesting hit Harry with sudden clarity.
Draco swallowed hard, his thoughts briefly flicking to his mother. ‘I’ll stay alive here,’ he whispered. He’d continue living in the Mirror world; another one of the formerly dead, who breathed and laughed and fell in love and had a perfectly wonderful life.
Malfoy met his eyes. ‘They find you,’ he said simply. ‘Within minutes.’
Up the staircase and into the flat. Draco detests the idea of the magical world intruding in his life, but he can’t help it now. Potter needs him.
‘What was it like in the Mirror world for you? Besides,’ Harry gestured to the sheets, ‘us.’
Potter’s face struggled with a flurry of emotions and he closed his eyes for a brief moment, still not letting Draco go. In the end, he took a deep breath, stared right in his eyes, and said: ‘You’re dying, Draco.’
Draco sipped his tea. ‘I
‘Shame,’ Draco returns. ‘You’re in some of them.’
, which Harry assumed meant non-Roma. The violinist resumed playing, a wistful melody that filled Harry’s heart with an ineffable melancholy. He should be happy: after over a week wandering in Cornwall wandless and lost, he’d reached Tinworth. His friends were somewhere close. He’d missed them an awful lot; but at the same time, this was an
’ve been cursed,’ Draco whispered. He was talking to himself, but Potter heard him.
Esther put down her needles. ‘I would really appreciate you telling us the truth now, boys. I know you don’t mean no harm to us, but I wish to know the truth of what brought you to our doorstep at the state you were.’
‘Potter’s got an Invisibility Cloak, don’t he?’ said the short man.
Draco looked dead on his feet. Harry gathered their tools, stuffed them in the rucksack and shut the barn doors. Soothing darkness fell inside, pierced by slanted shafts of light. ‘Let’s go to the loft,’ he said over his shoulder.
‘I apologise.’ Draco’s eyes remained on Harry, demanding an explanation, but Harry engaged Dawn in a conversation about the local Cornish saints, and Draco didn’t say anything else until he cornered Harry in the hallway after lunch.
‘I think so,’ Draco whispered. ‘But I’m not.’ His voice betrayed the fear that stopped Draco from hoping this could be more: he didn't deserve Harry. He was no Silver Hero, risking life and limb to stop girls from getting tortured and bloodthirsty dark wizards from taking over the world.
‘Ask me.’
‘No, it doesn’t. But then some people believe they’re better than others on account of, I don’t know, the magic their ancestors had in their blood.’
The man smiled. ‘Hello, potter. My name is Salazar. Fisherman.’
‘Nariyoshi’s getting worse?’ Potter asks.
Harry sighed and ate the bite himself. Glancing sideways, he observed Draco as discreetly as he could. Indeed, Draco sampled nothing of the roast boar, the spicy chicken wings, or the pork stew with plums, instead taking small, neat bites of a pan-seared snapper. Everything about him screamed restraint and fussiness. A man like this would never fuck someone wildly against the wall of a smelly back alley. Harry recalled Salazar licking his fingers after eating, and he ached with a longing quite unexpected for someone he’d met so briefly.
A flush crept on Potter’s cheeks. ‘Tell me—tell me about us.’
‘… she pricked his thumb — or worse —
‘They’re not your real parents,’ Harry said. Not Harry: Potter. This was bloody
‘Have you dressed him already, my love?’ Pauline said from behind the counter. ‘In the shows, it always takes a long time to properly dress a lord.’
Harry pressed the galleons in Malfoy's palm. ‘You do the talking this time.’
‘A magical owl,’ Harry whispered.
Uncomprehending, Draco examined Harry’s face. His expression turned grim when he figured out what Harry meant. ‘You didn’t believe me, did you?’
Draco’s eyes held a challenge and a sort of furious shame. ‘Wouldn’t you, if you were that other kid? He ignored him and looked happy while doing so.’
‘No one’s ever done this to me before.’
‘You know what’s really brave?’ Harry continued. ‘Coming back to school. Changing your beliefs. Making friends with Luna and Dean and the others. And, to be honest, I didn’t crush on some Mirror ideal. I like
‘I’m glad he only has four limbs,’ Draco quipped after the final snap echoed in the room, and Harry, his heart roaring in black fury, Stunned the kidnapper, tied him, gagged him, and finally turned to Draco, gulping deep breaths.
‘I wish…’ Salazar breathed. ‘I wish—’
Nariyoshi talks of Osaka, of his ceramic workshop, of moving to England.
He doubted the wisdom of confessing one of his most dearly held secrets to Draco Malfoy, but Draco nodded once, grim, and turned to the screen.
‘They’re also said to banish evil spirits when planted in the perimeter of a house.’ An edge of anger peeked under Draco’s words, the tip of a blade that was barely held back. ‘Planting needs to take place late at night during the waning of the moon — we’re lucky there. That’s what
Draco paused. ‘Don’t you make the decisions here?’
‘This is a
Harry glared at him, but Draco stared back stubbornly.
‘It is,
Draco’s eyes sparkled as he finished his reminiscence, his mood brighter. Harry brushed his leg gently, his chest constricted. If only life were a game. If only he could be assured of winning. He refused to let his fears taint this moment, though; not when Draco wore such a wistful smile. ‘It’s so weird that people wanted to be… me.’
, and, in particular, the sex scene that comes at the end of the last chapter. So here's 1.3k of lovely smut!
Draco kissed Harry’s temple. ‘Sleep now. It’s been a long day.’
Draco’s
‘That they’d wish for Voldemort to come to power? Your parents took risks in trying to ensure your safety in the Battle, disregarding Voldemort’s orders and desires. Now, if Bellatrix were alive—’
Harry peeked around the corner. The flickering light of a fire cast elongated shadows on the walls of a sparsely furnished living room. Two chairs sat in front of the fireplace. Draco was in one of them, his hands and feet tied, his hair golden in the firelight. Opposite him sat a man Harry hadn’t seen before, brunette, dark-eyed, handsome the way granite can be handsome, all angles and sharp lines and austerity. The man wore an unsettling smile. His hands were on Draco.
‘What’s happened to him?’ a voice floated around Harry. He came to with his nose in the dirt. He inhaled deeply, the smell of earth and grass bringing him back to his body. Hot hands touched his back. Draco. Feet danced around him. A few Romani had gathered.
felt, and he loathed himself for it, because it was nothing less than selfish to think this way. Harry wasn’t supposed to be anything other than a weapon of destruction; a soldier on a mission.
, chastised a mother. It took a moment for the meaning of his words to penetrate Harry’s agitated mind, but when it did, he exhaled, stunned in sharp relief. ‘You’ll let us go?’
Harry’s all choked up, too. He sits on the window seat. ‘You’re leaving, aren’t you?’
Draco gasped when Harry’s cock pressed in, his eyes heavy-lidded and dark on Harry. ‘You feel amazing,’ he rasped, voice hoarse. He opened his legs wider, hooking them around Harry’s hips, and Harry propped himself over him and thrust slow and deep.
A wicked smile. ‘Oh, you will. But I’m going to make you beg for it.’ Malfoy accompanies his words with a lick on Harry’s neck that feels incendiary. His thumb circles on the wet tip of Harry’s cock; Harry’s so
Draco inhaled as if he’d been punched. Potter continued. ‘You’re in a magical coma and you’re getting worse. The Mirror is sucking the life out of you. Being here— you’re slowly killing yourself.’
A faint blush spread on Draco’s face, a hint of a smile. He moved to the door. ‘Let’s see what the schedule is for today.’
The kitchen fills with the aroma of the soup. Knuckles white on the counter, Draco inhales deeply and steels himself. Anxiety doesn’t help. It won’t cure Nariyoshi or Potter; it won’t pay off his debt.
A plan started forming in the back of Harry’s mind as he let Draco roll him over and fuck him hard. Sweat dripped down his back and he pulled Draco close to him. They could capture McNair’s ship. Draco could take his place. No one had seen McNair in Port Royal; they had no idea what he looked like.
Draco didn’t pry, but his eyes stayed keen on him. Harry heaved a deep breath. ‘Once I happened to see a memory. By accident. It featured my father when he was at school. A couple of years younger than we are now. He bullied this… this person. He did something awful, and I—’
How wonderful it makes him feel, and how dangerous it is to feel like that.
‘Everything sorted?’ Potter offers Draco a mug that says YULE RETREAT 1993, and some biscuits, possibly Jacob’s.
‘I decided I’m going to stay,’ Draco murmured against his ear.
‘We used the Ichnilato Spell on Potter. But it took us to a Muggle road and…’
‘Don’t be a prat.’
Harry picked up a pebble and threw it in the stream.
The next day ambled by in a haze of bliss. Harry definitely walked with a spring in his step now. He peeled potatoes for lunch and helped Dawn with the laundry, and all the while his mind replayed the memories of the night before, causing his cheeks to warm up. He kept stealing glances at Draco, who glanced at him as often as Harry did. The heat and longing in Draco’s eyes suggested they shared the same thought: they had only a few more nights sharing a bed. A few more nights to touch each other.
‘I had the sun in my eyes, as you well know,’ Potter objected, but paused and worried his lip. ‘Can you not remember?’
‘Harry says there’s a virus going around,’ Granger says, sipping her virgin cocktail. ‘He’s been under the weather on and off these last few weeks.’
‘Can it be traced, you mean?’ Draco asked. ‘I don’t know.’
‘Not exactly. You put small disks in it. Each disk is a music album.’
‘I love fucking you, Potter.’ Sure, Draco hadn’t done it before, but five minutes in and he was a huge fan. He rolled his hips again, provoking another whimper from Harry before he resumed a fast, relentless pace.
, Draco said when he reached the stone wall hiding the Slytherin entrance, and it swung open to let him in the empty common room. A dying fire greeted him along with a house-elf dusting the mantelpiece, who bowed and vanished with a pop. He padded down the stairs to his private bedroom —an Eighth Year perk— and whispered his password. The door creaked open.
Perhaps he regretted not giving Harry up. But Harry couldn’t worry about Malfoy’s regrets now. He could worry about finding shelter, or about spending another night without food, or about catching pneumonia.
‘Apology accepted,’ Draco says in the end, and Potter smiles in relief. It seems to mean something to him, to hear these words from Draco. He’s endlessly baffling, this man.
‘Greyback and some others aren’t my parents’ friends.’
Harry’s holding Draco, one hand messing his hair. ‘I’ve no idea what made you approach me that night at the gallery,’ he murmurs, ‘but I’m so grateful you did.’
The words knocked Draco’s breath out. Mirror Harry had already told him he loved him, but he was a different Draco there, heroic and noble and brave, and he deserved Harry’s love. Draco hadn’t expected to hear these words in real life, not so soon or maybe not ever.
‘That’s it, Draco,’ Harry said, his eyelids fluttering. He bent his knees higher and wrapped them around Draco’s waist. Draco’s desire burned through him, stronger than an elixir. With a superhuman effort, he stopped himself from coming, and thrust once, then again, finding a pace that had Harry moaning loudly. Leaning over him on his elbows, he caught Harry’s mouth with his own, kissing messily, fucking him earnestly, while Harry dug his fingers in his hips, holding him tight inside him. Draco took a breath to control himself and rolled his hips once.
The longing in her voice was hard to conceal. Draco stared at his porridge, Harry felt a knot in his throat, and Dawn cast a careful look at them but said nothing.
But he couldn’t be. If Draco hadn’t been sure that the real Potter couldn’t enter his bedroom, he’d think Potter had been cursed or love-potioned.
‘How would Voldemort not suspect?’ Harry asked, but he remembered that Voldemort, like him, had been raised in the Muggle world.
‘No, that’s half of
This was Dumbledore’s kind of magic, Harry wanted to say. Instead, he watched him. Malfoy’s T-shirt was stuck on his body, every contour of his chest visible under the white fabric. The parka must have weighed a ton when wet. He was shaking.
different. Just same ol’ Harry. Seamus had lost his virginity with a Ravenclaw girl the year before and he walked with a spring in his step and a smirk on his face for weeks, casually dropping his non-virgin status in every conversation. Would Harry have the same spring in his step like Seamus? If Dawn handed him a hammer, would he joke he knew all about “nailing” wink wink? Harry shuddered at the mere thought.
Abruptly alert, eyes firmly shut, Harry waited. Draco’s hand had drifted on his waist, on the bare skin under Harry’s t-shirt which had ridden up; casually, as if they were lovers. Cold sweat ran down Harry’s back with the effort of holding himself still as Draco became more daring, stroking Harry’s skin with an almost-there touch. Goosebumps erupted in the wake of Draco’s fingers. Feverish anticipation swelled inside Harry; he wondered if Draco would pull his hand back after this casual exploration or if he’d touch Harry some more. If he’d touch Harry
‘No,’ Draco said, keeping his voice icy and his pride intact, ‘I want to write horoscopes. It’s my dream come true.’

‘No!’ Harry hastened to reply. ‘I just had no idea—’
‘I don’t know. Unsavoury things, I guess.’

The plan they had was bonkers. Planning with Draco was a different beast than planning with his two best friends. Hermione’s resourcefulness and Ron’s strategic mind complemented Harry’s intuition and reined in his impulsiveness. At the same time, they had both been willing to throw themselves into the fray. They’d all known, or learned, what it meant to fight against vastly more powerful opponents.
Draco mulled it over. ‘Their technology, I suppose. They’re very inventive, aren’t they? The Muggles. I mean, they have to be. To make do without magic.’
It’s his bed. He’s in the cupboard.
Draco was named after a constellation.
Draco feels lightheaded with desire. His knuckles are white on the table in an effort not to jump on Potter and ravish him. ‘You’ve no idea how much I can hurt you,’ he blurts out.
Harry’s fists itched to teach the rich brat a lesson, but he flexed his fingers and restrained himself. He wasn’t the first toff to shit his pants and try to overcompensate for his powerlessness with empty threats and mocking words.
‘Draco…’
Potter blushed and ignored the question. He pointed at the construction equipment by the side of the road. ‘I see someone else is as obsessed with this house as you. Even more, because they actually paid money for it.’ He shook his head. ‘Don’t know who would be crazy enough to want to fix this piece of crap.’
‘I want to,’ he said. ‘Merlin,
‘What about you?’
‘It’s my pleasure.’ Draco held Harry’s gaze. ‘Truly.’
‘Do you think people can change?’ Harry asked Dawn, who was cutting onions behind him. His scar itched and he rubbed it absently.
‘What?’ The ladies were downstairs and couldn’t possibly hear them, but they still leaned close and kept their voices low.
‘I can’t believe you consider
When he left, Draco turned to Pansy. ‘Pans, how can one tell one is dreaming?’
, but he won’t take words – so Harry has to show him.
. ‘It’s all right.’ Harry shrugged.

Cheeks burning hot, Harry said, ‘I’ll manage,’ but the man had moved—somewhat too fast—behind him.
Harry stood still, unsure how to respond, knowing it’d be suspicious if they declined, but Draco spoke first, his voice flat.
‘Wh—’
This one wasn’t the Potter he knew, but a Harry who didn’t pity or hate him, and Draco’s heart swelled. He finally gave in and ran a hand through Harry’s hair, stroking his fringe back from his forehead. Harry’s eyes fluttered close at Draco’s touch. This was— shit, this was very similar to the image he’d seen in the Mirror of Erised.

with your kind.’ He pushes his long hair off his face, his expression rippling with pain and fury. ‘I
Draco wished for a few more eyes so he could take in everything at once: his cock sliding in and out of Harry; Harry’s face, contorted in pleasure; his sweat covered body. Draco knew he wouldn’t last long. He tugged at Harry’s cock, sliding the foreskin back and forth. ‘I could fuck you forever, Potter. I want to bury myself inside you and never leave.’
. He squirmed off his own bottoms, kicking them off one leg, and lay back, gazing at Draco. Draco looked flushed, his hair damp on his face, gorgeous and utterly debauched; as hot as every wet dream Harry had ever had. Harry spread his legs and Draco slotted his hips inside them, pressing his cock against Harry’s and starting a slow, rapturous grind. No words were exchanged; their eyes spoke a language of their own.
idiot. You made friends with all the losers in the school,’ Draco said. ‘You rejected me on day one—’
He’d startled her, but she made no comment. ‘Whatever you say, darling. Anyway, they brought you here and they ran all sorts of tests, but there was no way to wake you up. Your parents were considering transferring you to St Mungo’s when Dumbledore suggested your coma might have something to do with the Mirror.’
Hermione gave him a peck on the cheek. ‘Take it easy, okay? I’m going to find where my boyfriend has gone to. See you later.’
Dinner was a near silent affair, but the two ladies didn’t pry. Harry’s attraction to Draco seemed like a silly problem now, trivial and inconsequential. There were larger problems; a much bigger guilt in which he could drown. His rage for the Death Eaters overwhelmed everything else, his purpose simmering in his veins, making him itch to leave this place, find a working wand, and hex the lot of them into oblivion.
, at my age… to learn that there’s so much more to life—’ He wipes his eyes with the sleeve of his tie-dye kimono. ‘I’m not going insane, am I?’
They decided on their story first: hiking trip, lost their packs and their way, no phones (Harry had to repeat the word). They knocked.
By the time they reached the town, Harry was famished. His examination of his pockets had resulted in one positive discovery: a crumpled tenner, courtesy of the Snatchers’ ignorance of Muggle money. Harry stopped in front of a bakery, practically drooling at the shop window with the pastries and the rolls, and Malfoy paused next to him.
Luna Lovegood was easy to befriend once approached. One mention of the baby thestral and she was happy to follow him to the Forbidden Forest to look for it. Draco also started flying again to train his atrophied muscles. Just with Blaise at first, at the edge of the pitch, but one day Dean and Seamus challenged them to a game, and before long, he and Blaise wiped the floor with them.
It hurt his mind to think of what-ifs. They’d done what they had to do: draw attention away from the two old ladies in the forest, and they’d escaped alive. The night was a success, even if he felt drained to the core, exhausted, and desperately hungry.
‘Lord of the Rings?’ Potter gestures with the book.
‘Exactly,’ Draco said. ‘Uncontaminated.’
‘Stupefy! Incarcerous! Crucio!’
‘And what is that?’
Harry attempts to focus on the conversation. ‘Turns out my skill for running headfirst into danger — although useful for battling Dark Lords and Hogwarts monsters — is actually an impediment in Auroring. Not to mention that the paps harassing me every time I was in public got in the way of my arrests.’
Harry grimaced.
While Harry’s busy with the kettle, Draco takes in the worn armchairs, the collection of unwashed mugs on the sink and a buzzing coffee maker. A note on some biscuits on the counter warns: THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF JACOB FAWLES. DO NOT TOUCH OR I’LL SEND YOU BACK TO THE WITCH-HUNTING DAYS.
idea to marry a stranger. The priestess murmured a spell and green vines bound the two men’s wrists together. At her instruction, they repeated the vow (‘to be a pillar and a lake; to support and to encompass; to be strong in adversity and infinite in love’) and the vines dissolved in a cloud of fragrant mist.
‘Wonderful to see you, Draco,’ Mrs Li says. ‘Do you have it?’
Malfoy shrugs as they wait at the bar for service. ‘Wanted to make you feel at home. It’s the right pub for your class, right?’

Several times Harry caught Draco staring out the window towards the forest. Chills ran down Harry’s spine. The intrusion of the magical world brought anxiety and terror, unwelcome guests and impossible to be rid of. If the owl found them, perhaps Rookwood could too. Although Harry loathed seeing through Voldemort’s eyes, he longed for an update of where Rookwood might be, but all Voldemort sought at the moment was answers about the Elder Wand.

wet dream, he thinks as he trudges to the shower, the gleaming eyes and sharp nails of Malfoy dancing in his consciousness until the hot water soaks them away.
and Harry pumps his fingers in faster, harder, deeper. He crawls over Draco, keeping his fingers inside his luscious arse, and stares at the wild, pained expression on Draco’s face as he’s about to come.
‘Do you want your parents to bury you?’ Potter insisted. ‘After you survived the war and the fire and—everything?’
In the hall, Harry pretended to dust a mirror.
A lump of longing choked Harry’s reply. He didn’t lack friends anymore, his childhood's loneliness a thing of the past, but that little statement, half comfort, half teenage seduction, flooded his chest with unbearable, sweet pain. He stretched his hand over the table between them, brushing Draco’s knuckles. ‘I’m glad you’re with me, Draco.’
‘My future father-in-law, you mean?’ Draco said, stroking Harry with his strong fingers.
Draco could tell she did it for him; her capacity for hours of uninterrupted study amazed him. He gazed at her for a few moments. ‘Hermione,’ her name rolled with difficulty off his tongue, ‘don’t tell Harry I asked you this, but how did we become friends?’
—and it suited you. If you ever wish to— um, make that change, then I’ll be on your side.’
‘So there’s no one in particular you think of when you wank.’
‘Can I get my reward?’
‘Devon.’
‘They were going to give you up,’ Draco said. He gazed towards the fire, as if mesmerised, but his jaw betrayed tension.
‘You won’t die.’ Harry’s voice startled him with its intensity. He wouldn’t be able to bear it if Draco was captured after everything they’d gone through. Despite the fact Draco’d been a bully at school, despite the abominable Mark on his arm, he still didn’t deserve to die like this, a scared seventeen-year-old hunted by his parents’ associates. ‘

‘I don’t remember.’
His mind is restless. Nariyoshi’s been taken to St Mungo’s a few days ago. A magical virus this time — a hex really — burns through him. His fever won’t go down and the Healers are baffled, but not Draco. The pearl of wisdom of the red dragon on his bedside table flashed its message when he returned from the hospital.
‘Yes,’ Harry said. ‘He was hot.’
‘Madam Pomfrey told me about your night visit to the infirmary,’ McGonagall said. ‘I hope you’re feeling better now. You may visit your parents for dinner.’
‘Then what were you trying to do? Come with me?
you. I want you to want me, to
‘Let’s go to Hermione,’ he says, which must be Potter’s first reaction to any problem. His utter confidence in her capabilities instills some hope in Draco.
Panting, Harry flopped on the bed. His brain felt stuffed in treacle. ‘I’d die happy now,’ he murmured.
Draco frowned at them. ‘Muggles love those decorations, don’t they? They’re everywhere.’
Harry nodded. ‘Everyone said he was a great man, and I’d idealised him. The memory shook me. To know he was nothing better than a bully, even for a short period of time.’
Draco met his eyes. ‘When.’
The fact that Potter’s sought him out — even going as far as finding him in the Muggle world — mystifies Draco. Potter could’ve easily walked away, found a new lover. Someone respectable even.
‘Shouldn’t… oh.’ Malfoy looked at Harry and, oddly, blushed.
‘I guess it is.’ Potter huffs a laugh. ‘Don’t hate me for saying this, I mean it in the
‘Libra:
At Harry’s insistence, they went over the plan a few times. ‘Can we trust the wand to work?’ he asked.
‘Blood magic?’
Granger, eyes widened with surprise, decides to ignore Potter’s ill-timed relationship comment. She addresses Draco. ‘You do realise magic can’t cure him? Transplants are one of the limitations of magical Healing. Organs are complex; quite different to, say, regrowing bones. Still, there are spells that will improve your friend’s quality of life and extend it for years — dialysis is a simple incantation. You’ll need to speak to a Healer about any side effects on Muggle constitutions, but it should make a marked difference on his general well-being.’
‘Did he carry a letter?’ Draco called.
‘Well,’ Harry said awkwardly, ‘I know you think we’re putting you at risk—’
The river sang softly behind them, and Harry thought he must have gone mad after all.
‘Looking at the food is worse,’ he said.
It was hard to imagine that, after everything, Harry would be
‘She does that,’ Harry says, frowning. ‘Best go upstairs.’

in its ambition and scope,’ a familiar voice drawls as its owner insinuates himself between Harry and the witch. ‘The contextualisation of negative space subverts the juxtapositions of subject and object, of viewer and viewee if you will.’
‘The elves,’ Draco says to shut him up.
‘No,’ Draco murmured, ‘I did. I could have said no.’
Draco, to make sure he wouldn’t walk away again, like in the alley; or perhaps it was the magic of the consummation that pulled these words out of Harry, the magic that’d ensure a successful alliance. Whatever it was, Harry felt unable to stop. ‘You’re fucking
When the Patronus came, Harry stopped mid-shave and Apparated to the Ministry. He barged inside the Auror office, looking thunderous. ‘Who has him?’
It feels almost like a dream. Malfoy slides his thigh between Harry’s legs and rubs his growing erection with luxurious, unhurried movements. It drives Harry mad and he cants his hips forward, seeking friction.
‘—and then I had to suffer seeing the Boy Who Lived hang out with all of
He was certain it was meant to be a joke, a sign of contempt, judging by the stifled laughter from some of them when Granger made the announcement. Let’s all have a laugh at Malfoy writing the last page of the magazine, the one you could rip out without losing any content. Let’s assign to Malfoy the one topic that everyone else was united in: their disdain for horoscopes.
But Nariyoshi took pity on him. He let Draco move in with him in the flat above the studio, he trained him to be a potter – oh the irony! – and he taught him how to repair ceramics with the kintsugi method. A
‘And then Patsy went “A crisp, darling. A crisp.”’
‘STAINS OF DISHONOUR! PERVERTS! FILTH AND MIASMA!’ A voice yanks Draco out of his pleasurable task. Incredulous, he stares at the yelling portrait of Aunt Walburga, who shouts maledictions to them at the top of her voice.
But voices drifted in the air with the melody. Unlike the seductive, almost-familiar whispers of Them, Harry caught snatches of conversations. Something about… laundry.
But he found none. Who’d have thought, Harry mused idly as the evening fell lavender-soft around them, that in a few short days he’d come to trust Draco Malfoy with his life.
It took some time before Draco believed him. ‘For
‘I guess we could—’ Draco froze, his eyes on his left wrist, bare now that the sleeve rode up. He stared at it for long moments, his brain unable to process the sight. Swallowing hard, he ran a finger over the pale skin. The Dark Mark was gone.
but I can also offer you one Gal— one of these gold coins. It’s pure gold. For food. And a roof tonight.’
‘…You don’t? You mean—’
The servant bustled in the room with a tray: sausages and potatoes, and a glass of dark ale. ‘Please, do eat,’ Draco said.
Potter looked even more worried as he followed Draco in the dim room and called for the nurse. A few moments later, a young woman approached them, tying her dressing gown around her. ‘What seems to be the problem?’
Countless times Neville had returned to their dorm with a spell that had turned his nose blue or given him feathers or glued his legs together forcing him to hop up seven flights of stairs. Dozens of nights when he cried into his pillow or when, red-faced and ashamed, he had to ask the other Gryffindors for a Finite Incantatem, some of whom seemed almost affronted by his ineptitude.
Malfoy shrugs, evidently uncomfortable, as if he’s unused to gratitude.
‘When a wound is left untreated,’ Harry explained in a low voice as he cleaned the laceration, ‘it can get like this. Because of contact with the air, I think. I’m not sure.’ The cut trailed to the back of Draco’s shoulder, and Harry had to pull him close, his chest an inch from Draco's. ‘Jumping in the lake didn’t help either.’
‘Smooth as sailing. All good on your end? Your friend?’
‘Do it,’ Harry says, vibrating with desire. There’s a kernel of fear in his arousal. Harry has no idea why, but it makes it all the more thrilling.
They gazed at each other. Harry could remove Draco’s binds with one spell, but he needed a moment. He circled behind Draco’s chair and slashed at the rope tying his hands together. ‘Are you OK?’ His voice came out hoarse.
. And soft and warm. The feel of his tongue,
Bob is called to the office; he comes out of it looking furious and miserable. His father looks furious and satisfied as he sweeps out of the hospital, leaving behind tittering nurses.
, the art of mending broken ceramics with gold. When he’s done, Draco carefully sets the repaired vase on a drying rack, stands and stretches. Remnants of Potter’s sizzling energy linger in his veins, and Draco is hungry for more; the mere idea of what the real thing would feel like is enough to make him drool.
When he let go, Draco took Harry's wounded hand. ‘This is what I do, right?’ he asked, picking up the cotton and soaking it with the antiseptic.
‘They’re not. There have been documented instances of Incubi or Succubi in the past. It’s just been a while since one of them existed,’ Granger says. Her hand often strays at her tummy — Potter’s told him she’s expecting.
‘He’s six-foot-one, very blond…’
Harry caught Draco’s baffled expression at the word “backpacker” and mouthed,
‘It’s infected,’ Harry replied. ‘It happens with wounds when they’re not cleaned properly. Especially if they’re deep. We need some disinfectant.’
, in Draco’s mouth, who coughed but swallowed valiantly as best he could.
Draco kept track of the time he spent in the Mirror world, ticking each day off in his diary. He’d been there just over two weeks. Fifteen days filled with a staggering amount of sex, a lot of Quidditch practice, considerable progress in Arithmancy under Hermione’s tutelage, and very little sleep. He’d just left the library when he saw her, climbing the stairs.
‘Like a black hole,’ Harry murmured. Draco frowned, but he didn’t ask for clarification, which was fortunate because Harry wasn’t up to discussing deep space. The reminder of his visions brought goosebumps to Harry’s arms. ‘Let’s talk about something else.’
“Dear Ginny,
Not that Harry cared. The whole kingdom watching wouldn’t stop him. Draco was removing his breeches, and that was the only thing worthy of Harry’s attention at that moment: Draco’s long, pink cock, rising hard and beautiful from a nest of golden curls. Harry positively drooled. In a hurry, he kicked off his own garments and fell on Draco, pushing him on the grass.
‘Is it Ron Weasley?’
A Malfoy was always a Malfoy.
‘You’ll excuse me if I don’t take your word for it.’
‘Draco,’ Esther said, ‘do you know who the first victims of the German Nazis were?’
‘You’re on it, too,’ Potter says behind him.
She might not have liked the look of them, but the accent worked on her as it was meant to. Accents of privilege had their own magic in the Muggle world.
‘He always drives up for lunch on a Sunday,’ she explained. ‘Come rain or shine, Ben’s always here at noon, bless him. You know,’ she said slowly, ‘you’re welcome to stay here until next week when he returns.’
a long time. Harry’s not the same as he was back then. It’s not inconceivable that Malfoy might have changed.
‘I’m not playing anymore.’
Potter crossed his arms and showed no signs of getting lost. ‘I’m making an effort here, Draco. Why is it so hard for you to accept it?’
An exploring hand slid under Draco’s pyjamas, light fingers running against his fevered skin. Draco’s breath came out with difficulty. ‘And then? You kissed me?’
‘And after Tinworth, what?’ Draco asked again.

Draco looked like he’d been slapped. ‘The
‘I hope you took care of them.’
Draco takes it and gulps some. When he swallows, he changes the topic. ‘I can’t stay all night. I need to be back at home later, just in case.’
When the woman dried off Draco’s hands, she gave him a light, kindly shove. ‘Grab some food, you look starved, off you go,’ and she hauled Harry closer.
Dawn shook her head. ‘I don’t want you here, because it isn’t safe for
). The incident with Potter from a week ago replays in his mind like in an Omniocular. Draco’d guessed correctly that Potter would be at the opening of his friend’s exhibition, and he’d also accurately guessed that a conservative style of dress would intrigue Potter more than a tight-fitting, revealing outfit would. Gryffindors like the chase, and from what Draco had gathered, his choice of attire had worked.

OK, so Draco might have spoken with the most glowing terms about Mirror-Harry, but what real Harry hadn’t realised was that Draco was describing

‘Riddle’s certainly got it in for pirates. Plans to exterminate us all, and Malfoy’s in his pocket. He’ll never satisfy our demands.’
‘Harry?’ Urgent, clipped vowels, insistent at his ears. A cool hand shook his shoulder, hot breath played on his cheek, and the smell of lavender tickled his nose. Without thinking, Harry raised his head and pressed his face at the source of the lavender smell, inhaling deeply. Dawn’s fabric softener brought him slowly back to himself, and he opened his eyes to see he had his nose buried in Draco’s shoulder.
‘Means your hair is offensive,’ said Draco, who’d come behind him.
‘Shit,’ Malfoy cried and dragged him to the back of the building, out of sight of the Muggles.  ‘They’ll be here any minute.’
Draco sat. Every portrait stared at him, which made him squirm. He particularly wished to avoid Dumbledore’s eyes. So, he looked instead at the whirring golden devices on the spindly tables, the puffs of coloured smoke emitted by a silver funnel, and the astronomy models hanging from the ceiling, and waited for the Headmistress to tell him the reason she called him in.
Pansy swatted his arm furiously. ‘I’ll never confide anything in you again. Ever!’ She sat back in her chair and glanced at Blaise a few seats away, eating with Theo. She bit her lip. ‘Alright, I’ll do it. Soon.’
A fire roared in the fireplace under an ornate mantelpiece with carved vines. Dormer windows looked over the mountains, but the four-poster bed caught Draco’s attention. He looked at Harry, who unclasped his cloak and left it on an armchair.
his face buried in a book. At the sound of the curtains, or perhaps Draco’s very audible gasp, he blinked.
‘Malfoy!’ Potter’s voice stopped him in the corridor on the way to the dungeons. Thankfully, unlike his friend, Potter kept using his last name and Draco was glad. The tangle of everything that lay between them was too complicated and thorny: best to stay at arm’s length.
‘I’ll talk to my supervisor.’ Potter’s words come slow. He’s falling asleep, but Draco can’t. He feels nausea — probably at himself.
Harry had frozen when the light illuminated the man’s face: fair as the dawn and cruel as the sea. Sudden, lightning-fast attraction to men he kidnapped was the worst of bad ideas. He faked a chuckle to give himself a minute to recover; then slowly clapped, his eyes never leaving the man’s face. ‘Well done, Draco Malfoy. You got me. Which means you know what happens to my prizes when the ransom isn’t paid. You’re right; I don’t kill my hostages nor sell them for slaves.’
The old man mentions his illness, the hospital appointments, and the transplant waiting list. ‘Old men with weak hearts are very low priority. But,’ he sighs. ‘I’ve made my peace with it. I know Draco hasn’t.’
OK so Harry might have cast a filthy glance himself to Malfoy as he sucked — he’s no angel either.
— he can
‘No, not too soon. Merlin, I've missed it so much.’ Draco gave a bruising kiss on Harry's lips, his pulse speeding even faster, and spread his legs. Harry’s face filled with wonder as he traced fingers over Draco’s balls and the cleft of his arse. Still, he hesitated.
‘What a shame,’ Esther exclaimed, clasping her hands. ‘You missed Ben, my grandson, by a couple of hours. He lives in Falmouth, only a short drive from Cadgwith, and could have given you a lift.’
‘Well, you found me.’ Draco didn’t ask how Potter knew he visited the Shrieking Shack. He pushed past him and headed back to the school.
‘Where?’
‘See you.’ Draco dismissed Potter when they arrived and grabbed the door handle.
The presence of both princes caused a great deal of fuss at the plaza, with mothers asking them to touch their babies’ heads for a blessing and barefoot children tugging their tunics for a coin. While Harry dealt with the two rival potters, Draco stayed quiet by his side, his eyes roving the crowd, examining every face.
‘Some ponce; who cares about his name?’ Finnigan asks.
he cares that much about their opinion. He’s pretty sure he’s never before given a flying fuck about what Granger and Weasley think of him, let alone Longbottom, but he can’t deny he feels nervous. Draco might have pushed the fact that this relationship is doomed to the very back of his mind; he’s even pretended at blissful moments that this affair has a future, that he’s not planning to abuse Potter’s trust and steal something from him, but he hasn’t
.’ Every inch of his body felt on fire. His pulse galloped at the sight of Draco stretched out on the grass, stark naked and flushed, his hair a fan of silver against green. ‘We’ll fuck.
Harry waited with bated breath, his knuckles white on his walkie-talkie. Their plan hinged on someone reading the note, someone who would alert Dolohov. Seconds dragged as they stared at the door, almost willing it to open.
‘We don’t have anyone by that name,’ Nurse Burbage says.
It does, it feels
‘Think about what I said, OK? I can’t stay here.
Cam greeted them with a frown and a stack of thickly-sliced bread and yellow cheese wrapped in white cloth. ‘The village is in uproar. The Death Eaters brought a search party, kicking down doors and searching — well, we all know who, don’t we?’
Draco panted now, his hips squirming, and Harry realised he must be hard too. Stretching his hand, he pawed at Draco’s bottoms and traced the outline of his cock, hard and long, tenting the material. Draco bucked into the touch and Harry rubbed his cock through the soft fabric, feeling the damp spot where it had leaked. Harry’s mind had been reduced to cinders; pure instinct drove his actions. He fumbled with Draco’s bottoms and found his cock and fisted it. Draco whimpered.
The niggling worm of worry about the

‘I never imagined—’ Nariyoshi wipes his cheeks, but the tears won’t stop coming. They’re happy tears, Draco realises. Nariyoshi’s
‘Perhaps a demonstration might help?’ Harry suggests.
‘Is it safe, do you think?’
But he can feed from wizards and witches, and he needs to do so urgently tonight before starvation gnaws his insides raw.
Esther’s sleeve had risen when she reached for the yarn, showing a tattoo. Harry froze when he saw it. He looked at Esther’s face. Of course. Fifty-odd years ago she’d be in her early twenties.
A sharp, desirous expression flashes on Mrs Li’s face, quickly suppressed. She returns to her customary poise. ‘Please leave it at the back of the room.’ She points next to a vase of peonies.

, and Harry wanted to
‘Are you wearing nail varnish!?’ Draco asked when he saw Potter’s hand on his schoolbag, his nails painted black.
Malfoy was sitting on the collapsed wall, facing the dew-covered fields that stretched in the distance. Harry came to stand next to him. The fresh, wet grass smell grounded him and dispelled the memory of the troubling dream. Often, after dreams or visions of Voldemort, Harry felt disconnected from his body, disoriented to be back in himself, and it troubled him more than anything. At such moments he needed touch or smell or taste; strong sensations to remind him he occupied
‘I don’t do patterns.’ Malfoy turned the bomber jacket in his hands, running a hand over the fabric.
Draco huffed loudly, interrupting him. ‘Look here.’ He pointed to a neat row of bushes, circling the edge of the property. Its blossoms looked familiar. ‘This is St John’s wort. Good for banishment, among other things. We’ve used it in Potions.’
Harry pushed the kissing gate open.
‘Is this a code?’
Draco added, ‘I spent most of the year either by the lake, or when it got too cold, in a secret room I’d discovered last year. I missed a lot of dinners that way, not that anyone cared. No one even noticed, except Pansy.’
He glanced at Ron who nodded. ‘Told you.’
The force of Potter’s orgasm makes Draco delirious. He bends over him. ‘I’m going to come inside you, Potter. You’re going to have all my come, all my Death Eater,
specific, but he couldn’t ask him now, not when Dawn had them off doing more chores.
‘I like your arse, Potter,’ he says again, pumping with every word. ‘I’m not sure I like you, but I like your arse.’
‘Perhaps I will be. A veritable Sherlock Holmes.’ Harry slides his hands under Draco’s nightshirt, seeking his skin. He can feel Draco’s pulse under his thin ribs and the heat emanating from his stomach.
‘We didn’t play— Did I beat you at Quidditch?!’
Draco flicked his nipple. ‘That’s because you kept using mine and it annoyed me.’ He hadn’t thought he’d mind, but after the third time he found his mother’s present on the
‘Let me,’ Harry said.
‘This’ll do.’ Harry set the rucksack down by the entrance. The space must have been abandoned for some time. Cobwebs hung thick in the corners, and dust covered the ground. A rickety wooden ladder led to a small loft on their left.
‘Don’t
‘Mind you stay on the path.’ She saw them to the back door and gave them a rusty pail for the wood.
She took in their serious expressions. ‘Did they find you?’
Harry and Draco trudged up the stairs to their room, silent and brooding. The rain had stopped, allowing the moon to emerge behind the clouds and flood the attic with silvery ghost light. They changed into tracksuit bottoms and T-shirts and climbed under the duvet.
Cam gave Draco an icy look. ‘Pureblood comes in many forms and shapes, boy.’
‘That’s nice.’
Mrs Li might hold the aces, but this time Draco cheated.
‘Cowslip for the south, heath for the east, heather for where the wind blows; bluebells by the door to alert for danger, all tied with Snake’s Tongue leaf to misdirect those who wish harm. My nan taught me all she knew, bless her soul.’
One thing was certain, Potter had everything to do with it.
Draco swallowed. ‘I had never become a Death Eater. I was a … hero.’
Potter speaks around his mouthful. ‘What else?’
He raises his head. ‘Why Harry Potter? Four Unspeakables have been working on this. Why did Potter have to be the mark?’
‘If you don’t, the treaty is invalid,’ King James said. ‘Look, I’ve been told he’s not an unattractive man… perhaps a tad cold—’ he paused. ‘Well, maybe a lot cold, but the islanders are like that, I suppose. A result of living on those godforsaken rocks, battered by the ocean.’
Hermione left a missive on his desk. ‘Albert G. Greengrass. The father of the woman Malfoy’s meant to marry. Willing to pay about seventy percent of what we’d asked.’
‘Remember whose fault it is,’ Harry said. The thought bounced in his brain like a mantra:
She seems to read his thoughts. ‘It’s all over Knockturn Alley. At the creature clubs and the potion dens; at the brothels and the betting rooms; at the dark corners of clubs, people whisper that an Incubus walks among us, promising pure pleasure in exchange for a little… sustenance. He looks different every time, but they all agree he’s the same man.’
After dinner and another murder mystery on TV where Dawn had figured out the murderer early on, while Draco made outrageous guesses (‘I hate this Poirot guy,’ Draco had said in the end. ‘He’s too clever for his own good and I don’t like his mustache’), Harry said goodnight and retreated to bed. He lay in the dark and thought of Ron and Hermione, hoping they were safe and well. He wondered if they’d taken up the Horcrux search on their own or if they were looking for him. He hoped Hermione had healed after her torture.
‘Until I saw
And into their clutches.

of gold, Potter,’ Malfoy smirked. Light and shadow played on his face as the foliage rustled in the breeze. Once again, a flash of pain creased his forehead for a split second, but Malfoy set his jaw in a determined way. Harry assumed he’d been thinking of his parents. The same feeling visited Harry, the same
Breathless and feeling dangerously weak at the knees, Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. ‘There’s only one solution really to this odious jealousy you’re displaying.’
The door shut behind Harry with a thud that echoed around the stone walls. It was warm and dry, and he was thankful. The young man—Draco, he said—waved away his thanks. ‘It’s nothing. I’m always up late at night anyway.’
Draco said, ‘I do. I just— it’s selfish maybe, but I can’t help thinking that I might be next. In four days even. We won’t be here forever.’
They shoved Harry and Draco to the middle of the clearing. The violinist ceased playing, the children gaped, and the rest of the community emerged from the caravans, surrounding them. Some of the foxes had been Animagi, men and women stalked out of the elms in the staggering movements of the recently transformed. Draco trembled next to Harry as they waited for their fate to be decided. The Roma had taken Draco’s wand and Bellatrix’s silver dagger when they apprehended them. They had nothing to fight with.
By the time they reached the road, Malfoy at the front and Harry at his heels, the drizzle turned into rain and it was bone-chillingly cold. Reluctant to walk along a country road at night, Harry cast his eye around him. A ruin of a building loomed in the darkness, not far from Harry, and he turned towards it. From the sound of shoes trudging the soft, wet earth, Malfoy was heading that way, too.
Harry smiled, and stroked Draco’s face. ‘We’re in no hurry, husband.’
change.
‘Oh, but then I’d have missed the chance to meet your sweet flatmate. You know you can come to us, Draco. We have Healers at our disposal. Not like the ones at St Mungo’s — good ones. We can help.’ She pauses, eyes sharp on Draco’s. ‘In exchange for the figurine.’
The crowd dispersed, everyone going back to their tasks, except for the children who stared with unabashed curiosity as Harry and Draco lingered by the fire, unsure what to do with themselves. Cam spoke to the Animagi, who slunk back into the woods and melted in the darkness. Harry guessed they’d keep watch during the night.
‘When I’m gone…’ Nariyoshi starts.
Malfoy grimaced. ‘When a boy like Vince, struggling under his parents’ pressure his whole life, is offered a way to vent his rage — well, the result isn't good. For anyone.’
?’ Harry blurted out.
When he came to, he was wrapped in a blanket on the sofa, his feet against Draco’s thigh, who read.
The face remained in shadow. ‘Mad-Eye Moody’s crew also bears the tattoo of an eye on their cheeks. This sorry lot you’ve got guarding me,’ he pointed at Seamus and Colin, ‘only sport the sorry tattoos your kind like to have: anchors, and the faces of women who scorned you.’
‘Delightful as it is to hear what you think of me, I’ve got to run. My next assignment is due. Unlike some of us, I can’t just copy down the results of the Quidditch league and be done.’
Her behaviour should’ve alerted Draco that something was wrong, but seeing Harry running towards him across the Entrance Hall with a look of desperation and relief chased everything from his mind.
In the days that passed, Draco learned a lot about Harry. He learned about his love for treacle tart and pumpkin juice and how he couldn’t have enough of Yorkshire puddings and gravy. He learned that he’d never received proper birthday presents until he came to Hogwarts, which made Draco seek out Weasley and Hermione the next day and hug them fiercely (Hagrid received a box of sweets; Draco couldn’t bring himself to hug his old Professor). He learned where Harry was most ticklish (ribs) and about Harry’s cupboard (when Draco heard the whole story of his upbringing, he swore he’d turn his family into frogs. Harry refused to give up their address). He learned—and loved—the way Harry’s voice changed when he was alone with Draco.
‘Yes.’

the touch.
, well, that tells me everything I need to know, Draco. Yes, you made some very grave mistakes, but I think you’re moving past that.’ His fingers travelled down Draco’s arm and traced his Mark, a thumb circling the scarred skin.
Both he and Malfoy were soaked to the bone, and dusk was falling. How on earth were they going to walk in soaked jeans or sleep in these clothes? The plastic bag with their old clothing was similarly wet.
Cold dread filled Harry. ‘We need to do something.’
Draco spoke softly, wonderingly. ‘My parents, their friends, everyone in my life has so much fear, Harry. I grew up hearing tales of terror for all sorts of people: the Squibs, the Muggles, the Romani, the Muggleborns. The Beings, like Centaurs and Veelas… I was taught that they were a threat to our life and to our society, that they’d harm us, the ones with the pure blood. That they were all against us, envious of us because they were lesser, and, therefore, we needed to protect ourselves.’
Nariyoshi sighs and leans back on his pillow, eyes on the coloured air. ‘Even if I die today, I’ll die happy.’
‘A potter,’ continued Draco — and just like that Harry’s heart stopped. ‘A potter called Godric. A blond man with a crooked nose. A commoner who smelled like a noble and kissed like the devil himself.’ Harry’s chest rose and fell as he stared at Draco, unable to believe what he was hearing. ‘You see, I was there under a glamour — one more piece? No? We’ll have it later.’ Draco wrapped the rest of the cheese in the cloth and smiled at the shock on Harry’s face. ‘I’d gone to your palace witch and asked her for a face and voice glamour. She’s the one I went to see last night, who informed me that she’d performed two glamours on the eve of our wedding: one for me and one for Crown Prince Harry.’
Draco comes. He gasps, his torso arching like a bow, and spills over his fingers. His arse clenches hot around Harry’s fingers, who keeps them in, stroking Draco gently through the throes of his orgasm, relishing the way his dark eyes brim with emotion, astonishment, absolute ecstasy. They’re dark, Harry thinks, the way certain desires are dark; the ones closest to the heart; the ones buried in his bones.
crass Fountain now, too.’
‘The saving thing wouldn’t work in the Mirror. I tried several times to enter it, but it didn’t work. It only allows entry to the most desperate. I managed to step through only when bringing you home became my most desperate desire. When you were about to die.’
Potter chuckled, his eyes never leaving Draco’s. ‘Sorry to disappoint, but Hermione burned with intellectual curiosity to visit the world you were in. Draco…’
‘Let me fix you some tea.’
‘We used hounds, my Lord. Goyle’s hounds, but they lost the scent of the boy in the lake,’ Rookwood pleaded.  A trickle of blood smeared the corner of his mouth and he wiped it off with his sleeve.
Draco blinked rapidly, his eyes shining. ‘Remember the lullaby? The mother sings to the son: “my love is as deep as the river and just as pure”.’ He stared at the elegant handwriting for a long moment, fingers clutching the parchment tightly. The coded message tugged at Harry’s heart. Draco’s mother was telling him she loved him.
— the males — and Succubi — the females — are offspring of vampires and Veela, two species who have been mortal enemies since time immemorial. Romantic affairs between the two species are illicit and condemned; imagine Romeo and Juliet—’ She notices the uncomprehending expressions of most of the company and waves a hand.
No one asks about the prison — Potter must have tutored them. Draco and Potter have trodden carefully around each other these past two weeks, avoiding any reference to the past besides their highly-inappropriate-for-first-date talk, and the theme continues here. It should make Draco happy, but instead it fills him with melancholy. Being completely himself with someone is a pipedream; the idea of discussing his mother’s death and his experiences in prison chokes him with dark emotions he’d rather not face. The idea that someone might love a Dark Creature like him… inconceivable.
Casting a non-verbal cleaning spell, Harry spreads Draco wider and licks his quivering hole, blowing some air on it and watching it flutter. It tastes sweet, in a rich, earthy way, and Harry burrows closer and starts licking him in earnest. Saliva drips down his chin as he laps at Draco’s rim before he jabs his tongue inside Draco’s arse, fast and sharp, then in circles. Draco lets out a litany of gasps and moans, his thighs vibrating with tension over Harry’s head. It’s not enough for Harry; he wants Draco out of his mind, he wants him
‘What did I know?’ Draco huffed. ‘I was a fucking idiot.’
‘Hey,’ he said later, while Harry was getting dressed. ‘Are you allowed to spend the night in my bedroom? Is this an Eighth Year thing? Because in real—’ He stopped before he fucked everything up by talking about trivial things, like reality.
. Draco had nightmares about seeing the Dark Lord again. He shook his head to get rid of the unwelcome images and tried to recall the most puzzling aspects of the Mirror world.
,’ Draco’s voice drawled, sounding supremely unconcerned for someone who had been abducted.
I left a tip of
‘These are pretty.’
Draco surreptitiously looked at his lap and counted his fingers. ‘And if they’re fine?’
Draco’s heart thudded.
Despite his shock, Harry managed to shuffle closer to Draco and smell his neck. ‘It’s you,’ he breathed. ‘It can’t be.’
‘Stop calling me babe,’ Draco growled. ‘It’s not
It had, but Draco wasn’t about to say it. It’d kept him up endless nights. He told Potter what he told himself: ‘My Harry,’ —shit, he didn’t meant to say that— ‘
‘Why is that?’
Head Nurse Burbage is called in the office.
Draco wanted to tie the bouquets with a special kind of grass that took ages to find. ‘This isn’t right,’ he’d say, when Harry pointed at a patch of long wavy-hair grass. Harry rolled his eyes. The fact that Draco’s aesthetic sensibilities stretched to the right piece of grass for an impromptu bouquet made perfect sense with what he’d made of the man so far. He didn’t know which part was pureblood upbringing, and which was Draco, and he had no idea how to separate the two in his mind. By the time Draco found the long, green stalks he’d been looking for, the sun was overhead and it was lunchtime.
Harry paused, abruptly, unable to go on. He dropped his eyes, staring at the table between them, littered with sandwich wrappers. Bile rolled in his stomach. He had trouble reconciling that memory — Snape’s horrific experience — with the idea of his hero father. He’d replayed it in his head so many times: his father confident and loved, well-cared for, surrounded by friends. He had everything, and yet he’d felt the need to torment Snape. As much as Harry loathed Snape, he couldn’t forget that humiliation. Hanging in the air with his underwear on display while his father threatened to remove them; it was monstrous.
‘What’s a soap opera?’ Draco asked.
‘That makes it a round fifty grand you owe us, right?’
‘A virus,’ Draco nods, his insides turning into ice. ‘That must be it.’
‘I thought the mere drone of his voice pissed you off.’ Every time Harry visited the prisoner, he came out of the meeting tense and irritable, as if his skin was too tight for his flesh.
Draco had been staring at the Mirror for some time tonight, his chest aching at the sight of what he would never have, when he stretched his hand towards it and— a bright flash blinded him. His hair stood on end and he exhaled, wondering what the hell had just happened.
‘You're kidding me, right? Why else have you not stopped rubbing your pureblood status in my face?’
Draco straightened. ‘The more they wait, the harder it will be. Goyle would have told them but, luckily, the Dark Lord likes to keep his followers ignorant of what the others are doing.’
. But after some peaceful moments when only their breathing filled the air, Harry allowed himself to relax.
Draco gazed at him. He chewed his bottom lip for a moment, drawing Harry’s eyes there. ‘I know you hate me,’ Draco said, his voice low, ‘but seeing as we’ll probably die soon, you could… test it. If you want. With — with me. Just so you’ll know.’
‘What intricate carvings.’
‘He won’t last long there anyway. Look at him.’
Yours Faithfully,
‘I hate not having a wand,’ Harry said. ‘There’s loads of protective spells we could use at the cottage.’
Before he finished his words, the crack of Apparition sounded. They both froze. It came from the front of the station and Harry, ignoring Malfoy’s furious whispers, looked carefully around the corner.
Malfoy lets go of Harry’s wrists. He’s still close, his body firm against Harry’s, but his words carry an edge. The amorous mood dissipates like smoke. ‘Is that what you tell yourself? That you were playing the noble hero?’
But only for a second. Before a weaponless Bellatrix had a chance to react, before Narcissa had even thought of moving, and with his scar blinding him with pain, Harry turned on the spot to Disapparate, but he still wasn’t fast enough: a hand grabbed his wrist. Harry turned into darkness, but the person’s hands were tight on his, pulling the wand, and he thought feverishly:
‘Nah,’ Potter stopped in the path. He scuffed the toe of his boot on the frosted ground. ‘I’m just trying to summon my “legendary” courage.’
‘Yes. We survived because of the kindness of strangers.’ He paused for a long moment. ‘Tomorrow—’ he started again but didn’t finish.
That was
‘This is what Muggles must feel like, right?’ Malfoy’s quavering voice said. ‘Magicless and facing a wizard. No hope of fighting back. Standing no fucking chance.’ Malfoy shook more than before, hands on his face, and Harry, unsure what to do, grabbed his shoulder to still him. Without thinking, he reached for the left one, and Malfoy flinched. The pain brought him out of whatever was going inside his mind, and he took deep breaths.
Harry noticed the two ladies watching their exchange. ‘He doesn’t have a TV,’ he explained. ‘His family was — religious. A cult, actually.’
‘And? What was I like?’
This has all gone so very Hogwarts so fast that Harry’s not sure how they got there, but it doesn’t stop him from saying, ‘You’re confusing reality with your prison fantasies.’
Draco had to turn Creature to become a decent human being – the irony is killing him. He swallows a touch of hysterics. ‘Don’t jump to conclusions, Potter. You don’t know me that well.’
‘You didn’t call me in here to reminisce,’ he says.
Malfoy groaned.
‘He’s off to the good life now, inn’e?’
He was already breathless and exhausted, brought close to orgasm and tortuously held back from it, when Draco lined himself up and pushed the tip of his cock inside Harry. For the first time this evening, Draco’s face lost some of its composure, his mouth pressed down on a snarl, eyes shutting. Holding his body rigidly in check, Draco opened his eyes and slid deeper inside, and Harry moaned. He liked to be filled in. He loved to feel
‘See you soon,’ says Nariyoshi.
Louder: ‘I want to bite you.’
After a beat, Draco hazarded a glance. ‘She’s gone.’
She gazes at him and Draco doesn’t take his eyes away. They need him; they’ll accept. In the end, she nods. ‘You give us the figurine, we’ll give you the money. But we need this to happen soon. Before the Crow Moon.’
Malfoy moves up close and wraps his fingers around the glass over Harry’s. He Conjures a straw and sucks, and Harry’s heart stutters. He attempts to get his pulse under control when Malfoy returns to his place, saying Harry’s vodka tastes ‘like the air before a thunderstorm does.’ Malfoy’s hand strays to his collar as if it bothers him, and Harry resists the temptation to tell him to unlace the bloody thing.
‘I am too,’ Harry said. He didn’t promise it’d be all right; perhaps it wouldn’t. He’d escaped from many a tight situation on luck and nerve and quick-thinking. Gazing at Draco’s focused expression, his long fingers deftly folding the paper, Harry felt a wave of worry threatening to choke him: that one day his luck would run out. He’d already lost loved ones, he’d had his heart broken by grief not once or twice, and he’d managed to pick up the pieces and move on as best he could. But should something happen to Draco… Harry didn’t think he could bear that.
They spent one of Harry’s last three pounds buying a loaf of bread and, finally, in mid-morning they left Camelford, taking the road south.
‘Who knew you’d take it so well,’ Malfoy murmurs with a hint of wonder. ‘Who knew you’d be such a good boy for me.’
‘I knew it was a matter of minutes. I managed to activate my wand locator before he grabbed me,’ Draco said, stretching one arm in relief. ‘Where are the others?’
Draco stopped, his fingers hovering over Harry’s skin. Harry stayed resolutely still, his heart a wild drum, hoping Draco wouldn’t stop touching him. He yearned for
‘A lullaby. My mother used to sing it to me when I was little and storms scared me. The sky over the Manor might have been torn by lightning, but as long as she sat by my bed and sang, I felt no fear. It always soothed me.’
He thinks he must have dreamed the reply. ‘I dream about you, too, Harry.’
‘And?’
‘Did I hear you take my name in vain?’ Granger stood in front of him and stole a rasher of bacon from his plate. She beamed at them.
‘Is this what you had in mind?’ Harry asks. This is madness, complete utter madness, but his heart is beating furiously against his ribs, his hands running down Malfoy’s hips. He wants this, oh how he wants it.
‘Come, sleepyhead.’ Draco dragged Harry away from his breakfast. ‘You promised to take me to the coast.’ Draco’s face radiated joy in a way that made
Afterwards, they lay in bed in each other’s arms. Draco played with Harry’s chest hair, tugging it lightly with his fingers, while Harry traced his back up and down, a never-ending trail. A heavy silence fell like a blanket.
too badly. No fear of draining someone’s energy to death while lost in pleasure; the thing that keeps his stomach in knots, the one fear Draco can’t shake loose, no matter how much control he’s learned.
Draco had died. This was the only logical explanation: he’d died and gone to heaven, and if he didn’t know that he didn’t deserve heaven, then maybe he’d believe it.
She frowned. ‘No, no, no. You’re not doing it right.’ She grabbed Draco’s palms. ‘I’ll do it. You wait your turn,’ she ordered Harry.
He wondered if Malfoy would throw it back in his face, the way Harry had with the chocolate. But Malfoy, unlike Harry, didn’t let his pride override common sense. He murmured thanks, unwrapped the pasty, and bit into it while Harry sat on the next bench, eating his own and sipping from a bottle of orange juice. His shopping had left him with about three quid. That was nothing to go on in the Muggle world.
‘He testified at your trial.’
Harry gasped, his knees almost buckling. Enveloped by the heat of the fire and the coolness of Draco’s mouth, hot and cold playing on him, Draco’s mouth worked on him sweetly—and expertly. Soft lips sucked at the crown, tonguing the slit, and Harry had to shut his eyes at the onslaught of sensation. Draco licked at the shaft once before he swallowed him back whole, deeper and deeper until Harry felt the tantalising brush of his crown against Draco’s throat. Threading his fingers through Draco’s silky hair, Harry caressed it back from his forehead, entranced with the sight. Draco gazed up, his mouth stretched around Harry’s cock, and smiled. It was a smile that held promise as well as danger, searing hot like an iron pulled from the fire. It was a smile that could bring a grown man to his knees, and so it did.
‘That was what? You hate Hermione because she’s Muggleborn. You called her slurs. She kicks your arse in magic — yet now you’re telling me that Muggleborns like her
or at school with the Carrows, but I was always helpless. Powerless.’
Harry approached Draco saying nothing, his face betraying wonder and happiness and maybe a little trepidation.
They ate a sandwich each, watching the group of schoolchildren who’d boarded the train wearing green blazers and grey trousers: a knot of four boys, a pair of girls muttering about GCSE coursework and a thin boy with a mop of auburn curls. The latter one leaned near the doors, absorbed in a copy of Viz, smiling to himself.
‘Let’s hope they don’t figure it out soon,’ Harry said.
Nariyoshi is easy to chat with, and Harry engages him in conversation, trying to piece together the puzzle that is Malfoy’s Muggle life. Mysteries fascinate him; it’s what drew him to work with the Unspeakables, and Malfoy’s never been short of intrigue.
‘So…’ Harry had guessed Draco's sentiments, but he wanted to hear Draco say it. ‘You don’t want
‘Two boys, similar age to her sons, showing up in the middle of the night asking for help? I thought the forest sent you. That you were Them.’
‘I want to touch you,’ Harry breathes, naked need in his voice. ‘I want to
’ Harry matched Malfoy’s hostility with some of his own.
‘Hush. You’re not going anywhere.’
‘What else?’
Harry pulled back and met his eyes. ‘I love you,’ he said.
Draco took it as a yes. He lowered himself on Harry’s slicked cock. Below him Harry shuddered when the head entered Draco's arse. ‘Oh fuck,
tempted,’ he admitted eventually. ‘But Dumbledore told me it was dangerous to live in dreams and he was right. Seeing you almost die because of it—no, I don’t think I’d like to visit that place despite—’ He turned to Draco. ‘Do me a favour, though, and don’t tell Ron his brother’s alive in there. Not until the Mirror is safe in the Ministry.’
‘To fuck me against the wall yourself.’
Esther spent the day in bed. ‘She has these days, sometimes,’ Dawn said. She and Harry had dinner alone in the evening, because Draco had volunteered to take Esther’s tray and keep her company. The falling sun rays came through the kitchen window and gilded the crockery, the glass of ale, the wrinkles on Dawn’s face. The room felt stuck in amber, a feeling which described Harry’s stay in the cottage. A beautiful stasis, a rest, or a trap. He debated the wisdom of his decision constantly, because he worried that at the end of the week he wouldn’t want to leave.
Outside, Esther attempted to rise and Draco held her by the elbow to assist her.
‘It’s so—’
‘No. But you can’t spend—’
What if there had been other owls? Other letters that Harry didn’t know about? He didn’t think he’d bear it if Draco betrayed him. Walking carefully towards the edge of the property, Harry strained his ears but all he could hear were the forest sounds: birds chirping and leaves rustling and insects buzzing.
Getting to know Harry was to love him: hearing him laugh at Weasley’s jokes, watching him sleep, witnessing his passionate devotion to what was right and the ardor with which he supported his friends. He had butterflies in his stomach just at the sight of him; a sentiment he attempted to hide under a mask of cool detachment, because if anyone found out, Draco would be kicked out of Slytherin for incurable soppiness.
‘Time for you to change,’ Harry said to Malfoy. ‘Er, my lord.’
Extricating himself from the bed, he pads out to explore the flat. He’d been too dazed last night to remember much about the old Japanese man who’s currently in the kitchen, another surprise factor in Malfoy’s mystery of a life.
A shiver runs down Draco’s spine as he gazes at the image of a beautiful lady with dark hair, who is, most likely, the reason for his
‘Who is Patsy?’ Draco interrupted. He wasn’t ready for that conversation yet.
‘I’ll put them back for you, my love. You carry on with your job.’ She took the bundle and smiled. Harry stood there, uncertainly, until he realised he would indeed have to return to the changing room and undress Malfoy.
He chided himself. Draco didn’t belong on a pirate ship. He was a man born for fancy clothes and ornate rooms. A man for state dinners and a stack of official documents to sign.
It’s June, not that anyone would know it. A cool spell has kept the patients indoors, their walks around the gardens brief. Some patients leave — Finnigan “to his mam’s nagging,” and Boot to his sweetheart’s arms — and others arrive, sometimes missing a limb or two. Harry prefers to sit by the lake alone, even if it’s cold. Ginny’s been writing to him all this time. They said they’d get married after the war, but he can’t bring himself to look forward to it. He likes her. He enjoys spending time with her. But he doesn’t love her, at least not like a husband should.
They rode in silence amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. ‘I had no idea you had an interest in pottery,’ Harry said.
you’ve offered to me.’ He bows low to Draco — the highest honour a master can bestow to their apprentice — which leaves Draco stunned.
But he never said what he wished. Closing his eyes and leaning back, Salazar allowed Harry to resume blowing him, his legs quivering as he came in Harry’s mouth.
Draco looked up. ‘Can you help me, please?’ He turned off the hot water tap. Steam billowed in the room, fogging the window.
it was Harry Potter himself who’d taken his virginity. The thought made him launch a fresh attack of kisses and caresses.
‘Sorry,’ Draco muttered, as he folded the paper. Inside it were a few scribbled words:
He raised his head at the sound of approaching footsteps.
In the hospital, they meet coming in and out of the bathroom, in the dining room, in the common room. The man always stays by himself. He’s almost invisible to the others, unnoticed even by Harry, until he’d spoken to him by the lake. Harry doesn’t approach him in the hospital. He likes the afternoons by the water when it’s just the two of them. He wants to have something to look forward to.
A wave of frustration rose in Harry. ‘I don’t know
Draco wishes she’d snog her boyfriend and forget about this topic. He glances furtively at Potter, who stares at the middle distance, looking as if his mind is elsewhere.
‘But someone else will. When V—’ Harry stopped himself just in time. ‘When
Draco’s face glittered with contained rage. ‘I learned it on my grandmother’s knee, who learned it on hers. I know all this because I’m a fucking
‘Maybe you weren’t paying attention.’
Harry flips him two fingers. ‘You buy my cider then, since you’re a toff. I’m going to grab a table.’
Malfoy remained rooted to the spot, staring at the bed with horror, as if sharing sleeping quarters with Harry was the worst thing he could imagine, but Harry, too exhausted to care about Malfoy’s pureblood sensibilities, climbed under the faded green cover and fell asleep instantly.
‘I’ll take this one after all,’ he murmured.
Draco picked up another pebble. He rolled it in his hand before he tossed it in the stream. ‘I was never a big fan of hell.’
: It’d been amazing, thrilling, intoxicating.
‘Excuse me?’ Malfoy said. ‘One bed?’
Draco had made a rather big fuss about this room, insisting the builders finish it first. The grey curtains were a slightly different texture and the armchairs blue velvet rather than leather, but the bed was the same. He’d made certain.
, Draco thought fondly, as he kissed him fervently, unbuttoning Harry’s robes. He felt as if he floated on a cloud, his veins filled with sunlight. Draco had folded the part of himself that felt like a fraud into a tiny square, which he’d shoved deep under his feelings for Harry. He refused to let it spoil the moment.
‘I’ve been thinking of precautions,’ Draco continued, his hips still making the tantalising movement. ‘I thought I might shave my hair off. Change my looks a bit.’
‘I was going to tell you.’ Harry munches on a sandwich, getting crumbs on the bed. ‘But you sidetracked me with that mouth of yours.’
‘Did you say
Esther shook her head. ‘I’ve lived the worst. I’m not going away, not when seder is coming.’
Harry looked at the mossy trees around them, the dense foliage, the blue shadows; he inhaled the strange scent that the wind carried and, for a second, he fancied he’d heard the soft laughter from the other night. He turned to Draco. ‘This is knowledge you can
‘We’re in Hogwarts,’ Potter whispered, his lips brushing Draco’s ear. ‘We’re in our Eighth Year, preparing for N.E.W.T.s. It’s an accelerated course, since the start of the school year was delayed, so we’ve been studying like Hermione. It’s February and we have a Transfiguration exam coming up in a week.’
He probably doesn’t know what that promise does to Harry, or maybe he does, because Harry’s cock twitches and the movement draws Malfoy’s eyes, his face taking on a ravenous expression. He sinks down and takes all of Harry in his mouth. Harry gasps and arches his back. Malfoy’s tongue swipes around the head, laps at the slit and licks the underside of Harry’s cock. For good measure Malfoy looks up at Harry with a wicked smile and runs his teeth gently along Harry’s cock before he sucks him once more.
A cup of milk and honey stood on a post on the fence. Harry drooled, looking at it.
Malfoy’s expression makes Harry think he doesn’t mean the nature of his work. The way his eyes fall on his body definitely suggests so.
Harry rolled his eyes. ‘Crystal clear answer, as always.’
‘I want it…’ Potter says, his voice hoarse. ‘This is…’
.’ Draco stopped and turned to Potter. ‘You could see them again. Talk to them, laugh with them,
Harry said nothing. The vision flitted in and out of his mind, pulling him back to Voldemort’s brain. Briefly, he closed his eyes: an announcement to the Malfoys that Dolohov and Rookwood were out searching for their son.
‘No.’
Malfoy and Harry shared a look.
Draco’s gaze swept over him, worried. ‘Are you sure you’re fine?’
His breath tickled Harry’s cheeks. If only Harry had kept to his half of the bed or even faced the other way. Now Draco would shove him out of his side and Harry would have to pretend to wake up after pretending to be asleep, and that was a lot of pretending. He wasn’t sure he was a good enough actor.
‘Death Eaters believe in keeping wizarding culture pure?’
‘Thanks.’
Stunned, Harry thought back to the bouquets Draco had brought back from the forest. His scar burned him, but all he could think of was that Draco had been collecting flowers in a desperate attempt to protect the cottage. Not that he’d deemed it fit to let Harry know. Harry felt his anger rise, his blood roaring in his veins, drowning the kitchen noise — until suddenly he realised: it wasn’t
Draco managed not to blurt out anything else incriminating, but it was too late; the ladies’ expressions varied from considering (Esther) to suspicious (Dawn).
‘Hey,’ Harry smiles, his surprise turning into pleasure. ‘You seem happy.’
? Do you really think I’ll buy that?’
After some tense seconds, Malfoy relaxed and lowered his head. Harry breathed again, but didn’t let go.
Harry bit his lip. ‘Seven whole pennies?
The gentle kisser.
‘Perhaps he’s hurt,’ Narcissa gasped. ‘He’s not disloyal, my Lord, he’s probably just hurt.’
Harry’s hand trembled a little as he put the plasters on the Splinching. He told Draco what Hermione would have said; what his brain insisted was true despite the protests of his heart. ‘The Death Eaters killed them.
Afterwards, Draco always regretted it. He replayed every argument in his head, trying to figure out how he could have stopped his mouth from running. In his fantasies, Potter asking him to a game of Catch the Snitch ended in exceptionally pleasant ways. In reality, when Potter asked him the same thing, surrounded by a gaggle of friends and admirers, clearly taking pity on solitary Draco, his blood boiled and he snapped.
‘And you didn’t consider Reparo-ing it?’ Draco hopes Nariyoshi will think the name of the spell is a slip of the tongue.
Malfoy didn’t speak for a moment. ‘I’m not sure I was trying to stop you.’
in his ear. This privilege had been Draco’s and now he’d lost it. Draco felt envy of his other self.
‘So I call her Hermione?’
He spreads Potter on the table, holding his hips as he fucks him. Potter seems to like the rough treatment, writhing under Draco’s hands, which map out his body. The curls around his cock, the hairy chest, the pert nipples, the constellation of moles, the firm arse rising in the air as he tries to meet Draco’s thrusts.
‘Will you?’ Harry asked, his heart in his throat.
He stepped backwards with infinite care, the eyes of the foxes following him — and fell into someone’s hands.
Harry shook his head, feeling as if he’d just woken up from a daze. He clenched the rusty nail Draco had thrust in his palm, the metal digging in the flesh. ‘What just happened?’ he asked Draco — real Draco, flesh and blood Draco, breathing hard, hair in his face, and fury in his eyes.
‘Did I?’ she breathed.
With a sudden snarl, Draco shoves Harry on his back and straddles him. He pins Harry’s wrists on the bed and leans over him. ‘You were always reckless, Harry. Everyone else would run in the opposite direction, but no, not you. You are here, placing your faith in me, knowing full well how badly I can hurt you.’
‘My mother said I should stay away from the Romani when I was little,’ Draco mused. ‘That they steal children. She was wrong, wasn’t she?’
you are,’ Harry whispers. ‘I
He spreads him wider and Draco holds his knees to his chest. Sparks of desire course through Harry at the sight of Draco presenting himself so beautifully open, so wonderfully trusting. Harry's lust feels bottomless, overflowing, infinite, and Harry summons it to give Draco
They’re alone in the corridor. A single oil lamp is flickering down the hall, casting them in long shadows, The man nods. Harry touches the scars lightly, almost reverently. ‘These are not battle wounds. These are…’ They look like the result of torture. Someone carefully and methodically sliced across the man’s chest. Possibly taking their time to ensure maximum pain.
Still, sounds of activity from the other boy’s corner made him look. His eyes could just make out the fair hair and the slow movements, as Malfoy unbuttoned his damp robes and winced when he uncovered his hurt shoulder. Harry struggled to make out the injury in the dark until Malfoy stood and walked to the collapsed wall, which let in what little light there was to be found that night. The skin appeared to be torn. A deep scratch, that was all.
Besides, it’d be rude.
?’ he asked, face in shock. He sat back. ‘Our discoveries are different — transfiguration has made leaps and bounds lately — but still…’ He murmured as if he was speaking to himself. ‘Perhaps magic is making us complacent.’
‘Anything I can do?’ Nariyoshi starts to rise, but Draco waves him down. ‘I can handle it, you watch the talentless teens on the telly.’
They had no choice. They kept walking.
Hermione met his eyes. ‘Do you mean to go ahead with this?’ Meaning,
Draco’s skin smelled of the soap they shared. It was really warm in the bathroom, the air steamy and hot and stifling. Harry chose a long, narrow plaster and applied it to the lowest part of the cut. It looked like a crooked, elongated Z, or a constellation, like the ones they had to study in Astronomy.
She gave him a small smile. ‘Well, it was a dream world, wasn’t it? Blaise with the Muggles, I ask you! He can't stand them.’
‘It was a nightmare,’ Bob whispers again. ‘I was on my way to the loo when I heard you tossing and muttering.’
‘Same thing happened back then,’ Esther said. ‘In the war.’ Her voice turned flat and colourless, the memories coming almost unwillingly. ‘Sometimes they offered rewards. They’d pay money if you told them where the Jewish families were. Other times… more often they’d come to your house and threaten to do the worst things imaginable to your family — unless you gave up the Jews hiding in your cellar.’ She shook her head. ‘Terrible, terrible days. The Nazis ruled by terror, and it ripped a whole continent apart.’
His last stop was Draco’s cabin. He found him pacing his room. When the door opened, Draco’s expression of worry turned, fleetingly, into sharp relief, to be followed by his customary indifference. ‘Done?’ he asked.
‘You sure about this?’
‘You should be grateful you’re getting a bed at all,’ she said and shut the door behind her.
Sitting in the carriage, Harry said, ‘I can still hope,’ and he shut the door.
Hermione looked at their clasped hands and dropped his hand as if it burned. In a strained voice, she talked to her shoulder, or rather to the round, black earring she had on one ear: ‘Harry, I found him. Meet you at the entrance.’ She jogged down the steps, gesturing to him to follow her.
Draco accepted it, his mind flashing back to Harry fucking him against the wall in the Quidditch broom shed. ‘Terrible,’ he nodded. He lowered his head and sipped some tea, hoping his blush didn’t betray him.
He returned with two cups of steaming tea and a superbly proud expression. ‘She thought I was a tourist.’
A golden mesh glowed briefly before it sank into their skin. Perhaps Harry’d imagined it. It took him an embarrassing amount of time to get his head together. He breathed heavily, gazing at Draco over him, a pale, sweaty vision of lean muscle and rosy, swollen lips. He stroked Draco’s hair off his face and caressed his cheek, his neck, his chest. Draco leaned in and kissed him with much tenderness before he moved to curl beside him on the cool grass.
read your mind, too? Can he see where you are?’
‘In terms of doing magic, I am. I have this extra skill that she can never acquire.’
‘It didn’t use to be,’ Draco muttered, as they climbed the front steps.
‘How romantic.’
Nariyoshi has been vomiting more frequently. They had to get a doctor to visit once — it cost them a fortune. Draco shuts his eyes and does what he has to. ‘Do you ever take it out of the department?’
The intensity of the sensation almost made him come. Harry bucked his hips, wanting more of Draco, babbling encouragement, and Draco, his mouth dry, his body shuddering, pushed himself deeper and deeper inside the heat and the tightness of Harry’s arse, gritting his teeth against the overwhelming desire to come this very minute.
The Succubus weighs heavy in a deep pocket of his cloak, and in his soul. He wishes there was another way to finish this business, a way that didn’t bring him to his old stomping ground, but there isn’t.
Draco does as she says. The bird flies through the cold night, and Sue shuts the window and returns to her mother. Draco flops into a seat, his heart racing. He still holds the Succubus. ‘Since we have some time in our hands, can I ask you something?’
who apologises to Draco; the man who’d saved Draco’s life. The man who’d been right in every way Draco had been wrong.
He might as well have stabbed Draco. ‘Don’t speak.’ He removes his mouth to rest his forehead on Harry’s stomach. ‘Just fuck my mouth. Please.’
Half an hour later, they stood outside the tourist information office and pored over the county map. Passers-by gave them a wide berth and the assistant behind the counter had been borderline rude to them, eyeing them from top to bottom, his mouth curling with contempt and maybe a little fear.
Draco glanced at Harry, who gave him a look to remind him to ‘shut up’. He found he very much enjoyed having all these opportunities to tell Draco to shut up on account of “not being discovered”.
Draco’s back yielded next to Harry’s inquisition, as did his arse, which Harry squeezed, enjoying the dimples that formed in the pale cheeks. Draco was laughing by then, teasing Harry for his dedication (‘which you never showed in any lesson, I reckon’) and Harry chuckled (‘you forget Defence, I showed plenty of dedication there’), but didn’t let up.
‘I wouldn’t want anything to happen to
Time ran away from Harry, who was lost in his overwhelming desire, halfway between pleasure and pain, as his arse was being gloriously abused by Draco. The cold forest was a distant memory, as was his mission, his team, even his name. His fingers had left deep marks where he’d clawed Draco’s back wanting more, urging him to fuck him harder. Draco buried his face in Harry’s neck, his breath brushing against Harry’s sweaty skin. He mumbled something.
‘Finite Incantatem!’ Dolohov swept his wand over the street.
‘Don’t want to hear it.’
‘Maybe I don’t want someone to get on
. Draco’s had occasion of experiencing that feeling before and he hates it — it feels like he stabbed himself in the chest with a burning knife. He hates himself for saying, ‘I’m no expert, but perhaps you should try thinking outside the box — and take the object outside its box, so to speak. Maybe bring it here.’
‘It’s you,’ Harry breathed. ‘It
He grins at Draco, who attempts a smile in response. ‘Tell me what?’
They took turns in the bathroom on the first floor, changing into tracksuit bottoms and faded band T-shirts. Malfoy went first and took his bloody time. Eventually, he left the bathroom, leaving it steamy and smelling of Imperial Leather soap, his wet clothing inside the plastic bag with their old garments. Harry peeled his jeans off of him with relief and showered quickly. Wrapping himself in a towel, he relished the feeling of dry skin, and allowed himself one moment (just the one): to hope. To believe that things were looking up for them.
‘It was so dark,’ he mutters.
‘I suppose so. It was built as a refuge, of sorts, with strong magic to keep the danger inside it contained, but it sustained extensive damage in the process. Perhaps it longs for peace and quiet.’
Four hours later he revisited that statement: he’d give all the gold in his vault never to do any more chores in his life. The house had to be pristine in preparation for seder, Esther had said, and so they washed and hoovered everywhere, even under the sofa cushions, and they dusted shelves and windowsills and each and every one of the innumerable photo frames Esther had placed on every surface. Dawn bustled in and out with instructions, her hands full of the curtains she’d taken down to wash. Esther kept them company now and again, reminiscing about her life. How, after the war, she’d found work at a London theatre making costumes, and how she fell in love with the young man who did the lighting. The years working backstage, the actors she met, the pranks her first son, Elijah, played on the cast when he was little. ‘And Olivier had to go on stage with flour in his hair!’ She beamed as the memories flowed, one after the other; a life well-lived, even after the horror she’d gone through. She was a tiny woman, and yet so strong. Harry clutched at the hope emanating from her stories with the desperation of a drowning man: the hope that after this dire time, he’d have a chance to live and love, like she did.
? How will I face him again?’
‘Is that why you think I don’t want you here?’
Harry wiped his eyes and straightened. Draco had already put on the rucksack and waited by the door. Harry made his goodbyes with Dawn, who shoved a twenty in his palm. ‘Take the train, my love. It’s fast and it’ll keep you off the roads.’
The train chugged along. Harry assumed he wouldn’t get an answer, but eventually Draco spoke. He didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. ‘Because it made me feel good.’
, honestly, I’m truly concerned for the sanity of the people who actually
His dreams had been uneasy, flitting visions of stone dungeons and dark alleys. Voldemort’s presence never left Harry; the pull he exerted snatched at the edges of his consciousness; long, grasping fingers like the voices wishing to lure them in the forest. Their days at the cottage were running out; Sunday drew inexorably closer. The war beckoned.
‘Ah almost forty years now. I was a hippie, went to all the festivals. Met an English woman in one of them and moved across the world to be with her. We got married, were happy for maybe twenty years, unhappy for another ten. Divorced eventually. No children. Now I have Draco.’
Defeating him was the only thing that mattered, even if the thought of what it would cost made Harry ache.
— orgasming themselves is pleasing but not a prerequisite. It’s a difficult conundrum and one which suggests why his kind is considered cursed in love: the more you please someone, the better you make it for
‘It’s a clear ink based on lemon.’ Draco explained, pouring more soil on the parchment. ‘Pureblood kids use it to write secret messages to their friends. The lemon makes the ink sticky, so if you throw some powder over it…’ he blew gently on the parchment and shapes appeared. ‘The powder sticks to it, and you can read the message.’
. Draco can sense sexual desire; it’s part of his armoury. The air thrums with potency when someone is aroused, a resonance that fans his Incubus hunger but also allows him to find willing prey. The lust emanating now from Potter is as strong as Draco’d felt it back at the art gallery. It tingles his skin. To escape he heads to the back room with the wheel and the kiln. Potter seems to take it as an invitation to follow him.
He attempts to roll them over, but Harry pulls back, hovering over him on all fours. ‘Do
‘Alright then,’ he heard himself say.
. He’d give anything to have it back. ‘I guess I—’
Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. ‘A sanctuary? Fascinating!’ he said. He clasped his long fingers in deep thought, while the portraits around him moved in agitation.
‘We’ll hitchhike,’ he said. ‘Last time the Death Eaters found us before we had a chance to give it a real go. Or, maybe Dawn knows someone in the village that could give us a lift to a busy junction or something.’
‘Have you memorised every word?’ Draco asked, his voice hoarse. His pulse raced as he took a step closer to Harry, and he had to stifle a gasp when Harry reached out to hold his hand.
It felt good to have a plan. ‘So they won’t be able to track me down again?’ Harry broke off a large piece of the loaf and gave half to Malfoy.
to find proper service nowadays.’
Harry’s pulse spiked. He fumbled, fingers clumsy again, and the man huffed a soft laugh against his skin and moved to the front. ‘Let me,’ he said again, and Harry could do nothing but nod.
‘You were always desperate to have power over me,’ he murmurs. He doesn’t know why he says it, he doesn’t even mean anything by it; he’s aiming to tease more than anything, but Malfoy stiffens.
‘How did it go?’
body; that he was Harry, and not an extension of Voldemort, a feeling that he couldn’t shake off and which terrified him.
Draco’s eyes are burning in the night. ‘You shouldn’t trust me.’
Harry kept as still as possible, holding his breath. In every other fight in his life, he’d had a wand. He tried to think of what he could use as a weapon, but he knew nothing could stand against magic.
Draco feels as if he’s back at the round table, holding a hand of cards, certain he’ll win the game, only for Mrs Li to throw down an ace.
The door clicks behind Harry and creaks open. He stares at the dim corridor. ‘I don’t want to be in this house.’ He hates that he sounds like a baby — why does Malfoy have to see him at his weak moments? — and he hates the tears that fall hot on his cheeks.
