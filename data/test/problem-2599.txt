Harry closed his eyes. The thoughts he wanted to say and couldn’t speak tumbled inside his head.
Charlie lifted his head and flicked his tongue out. Potter made a choked sound, and grabbed James’s hand when James would have run up to pet him. The boy gave his father what Draco thought was a long-suffering look, and said, “
“But you
“You struck from behind, like a coward!” Moonborn shrieked, spittle flying from her lips. “You
. And then my Mind-Healer betrayed me and my wife divorced me.” He bared his teeth. “Don’t talk to me about how much harder you have it, Malfoy. You want to have a trauma competition? I’ll win.”
Harry smiled at Hermione. Honestly, he loved his friends, but they went out of the way to protect him too much. Harry was more than capable of doing that for himself, and James, too. “It’s all right, Hermione. Life goes on. And we didn’t end things on good terms. She’s got a right to live.” He settled back against the huge wingback chair in Hermione’s drawing room with his mug of cider and subtly checked the charm glowing on the pocket watch that Molly had given him all those years ago. Yes, James was all right at the Burrow. “Who’s she getting married to?”
Bonding more closely with his son sounded tempting, but how did he know that he wouldn’t hurt James, too?
your school. To say that I don’t care about my son being a Parselmouth. No, wait, more. That I’m proud of it. And that I’m trusting you to take care of him.”
But instead of a Death Eater or that group of lunatics calling themselves the Order of the Serpent, there was nothing but a small golden snake curled up there. Harry lowered his wand, but kept it out. The snake
In the meantime, I'll be doing my best to crank out some more of this fic, and potentially write some other things to try getting my flow going again. But it's probably best to not expect any content for about 2 weeks at the time this is being posted. I would appreciate some feedback on what exists of this fic, whether or not you guys like it. Part of why I'm so down is because I've been feeling pretty unappreciated when it comes to the things I create, whether it be my stories or my artworks.
"Why are we here?"
He finished the entire glass in a series of gulps. He set the glass down and sucked down a few large breaths of air. He looked down at his food, a cold messy casserole made from various leftovers and such. He mechanically spooned some of the slop into his mouth and cringed with each bite. It was disgusting, the flavours mixed in an awful way. All the ingredients were days old. None of that was aided by the fact that it was absolutely frigid. The same bittersweetness lingered in the background.
Since he was up, he decided to contemplate his most recent and pressing issue. Uncle Vernon has been looking at him strangely for the last few months, glaring frustrated at Harry when he thought he wasn't aware. The obese man almost looked like he wanted something from Harry, maybe to beat the living hell out of him again. Nevertheless, Harry didn't know how to approach the problem.
He stepped deftly through the rubble, and ran off toward the cell blocks. Eventually he came up to the barred door that separated it from the rest of the facility. He heard more footsteps gaining down the hall behind him. He quickly unlocked the door, and slammed it behind him, willing the locking mechanism to twist until it would remain locked, but inoperable via it's respective key.
"I think I will decide whats relevant, Mr.Potter."
"Alohomora!" He whispered, the lock clicked open in response. The emerald eyed boy felt embers smoldering in his chest, he still felt bitter toward McGonagal. Extremely bitter, his resentment flared every time he thought about her, or used the magic she had taught him. He rarely smiled at people anymore, oftentimes passersby on the street would be deterred by his disdainful expression as they passed Number 4 Privet Drive. He shook these thoughts as he walked to the front door. Quietly, he unlocked said door and walked onto the front step.
Most of it was older architecture, cobblestone streets, old sidewalks, slanted and uneven buildings. Elements of newer structures were patched in, and became denser in certain areas. He assumed that this was because of those areas proximity to more major and densely populated cities.
Remus made his way to Diagon Alley, having just arrived at the train station in london. On his journey he'd removed some of the non-muggle currency he had stored in his guitar case for safekeeping. He needed to make several stops that day, for one, the apothecary. Harry's leg wouldn't heal very well without seeing a proper doctor, or the use of magic. Secondly, he needed to send a message via the owlry. Lupin had a feeling something was definitely amiss with Dumbledore.
"Sir, you! Please, let me amaze you with a magic trick! You won't regret it!" Harry flashed a smile, and flourished his arms dramatically.
Harry was suprised. He couldn't imagine not having a name to be called, The Dursleys had always called him something. Even if it hadn't always been his given name.
Numb. That is what he felt. If you could call numbness a feeling. All of his senses felt dead except for being very aware of his aching body. Green, emerald coloured eyes lacked their usual brightness. As if the transparent body of a crystal had somehow become slightly opaque. A glossy lusterless film had formed over his spirit.
"Oh, erm, ok." Said Harry, awkwardly. "How'd you learn to play the guitar?"
Soon he walked out of the restaurant, his belly felt awkward and bloated. Though he was satisfied and happy. In his hand he clutched a plastic bag, which contained his food.
Terrified green eyes widened to the size of saucers as his uncle raised the belt above his head, muscles tight beneath the fat. Harry almost didn't see the belt come down upon him. On impulse he raise his arm, feeling the momentary pressure of the leather strap before it burst into searing pain that streaked over the surface of his forearm. Harry cried out in pain and clutched his arm to his chest.
He swallowed happily, and dropped the lemon wedge into his cup, swirling it with a spoon. Taking a few gulps, he relished in the refreshing hint of citrus. As he awaited patiently for his meal, he looked around the restaurant.
McGonagal sat at her desk, grading essays she had received that day. Two stacks sat on either side of the heavy dark oak surface, each about nine centimeters in height. One ungraded, the other graded; between them sat the essay she was currently grading. She glanced at the unopened envelope at the edge of her desk.
"What do you mean 'everyone in the wizarding world'? Are you mad? I'm nobody. I'm a six year old who just discovered magic less than a month ago."
Due to it not being a busy morning, his food arrived with relative swiftness. Before him was placed two plates with more food than he remembered being fed in his life. On one, a stack of three thick Belgian style waffles, their exterior was crispy golden brown and steaming slightly. A generous dusting of powdered sugar coated the stack. The second plate had two large chicken legs on it, both fried and crispy to a deep golden brown. Their surfaces were craggy and well coated with fried flour and spice dredge. Then, next to his plate of waffles was set a pitcher of syrup about twice the size of a shot glass.
"I don't have toilet paper, unfortunately. It's sadly not really within the budget at this moment." He said, opening the door very slightly and slipping his hand through. He felt the wad of napkins being tugged from his grasp.
Today he was finally being released from his prison under the steps. He needed to check for the hole he supposedly left on the side of the house using some freak act of "magic." Harry was back to weeding the garden, slowly and painstakenly he pulled the unsightly plants from the ground while the spines of their leaves bit into the callouses on his palms and fingers. He took a tenative glance up and around, checking for his cousin and his goons, or the she-devil ironically named after a beautiful product of evolution, Petunia.
"Gather around for a little show everyone! I am about to amaze you!" Harry called out to the passers by on the street. Few seemed to take any interest, one or two stopped for a second to look at Harry before continuing on their path. Some seemed to be headed to their flats for dinner.
"Shit..." Then he spoke up. "Right, erm, just a second!" Thhe werewolf walked briskly to the kitchen and opened then shut a couple drawers, finally finding what he was looking for in the drawer next to the refrigerator: a bundle of napkins he'd grabbed from various sit in restaurants around town. He walked over to the restroom door and knocked softly.
"Well- well..." he trailed off, not knowing how to tell her he'd just spent nearly a week unable to move because his violent uncle beat him severely with a belt. His mind suddenly wandered to the memory of it. The ravens breathing became short, the pace of each breath quickening.
Harry set his jaw in place, trying not to grind his teeth. His eye twitched slightly. He tried to calm himself, the raven adjusted his stance and drew a few deep breaths. Ok. He threw himself at his task again. He searched inside himself deeper this time. He looked and looked, he felt as deep as he could. Mental tendrils groping around for any trace of that cold raging fire described to him. He began to grow angry again as he found nothing. His frustration boiled like an overfull tea-kettle duct taped shut on an over heating stove. His eyes snapped open and he let out a low growl from deep in his throat, it almost hurt. Something flashed forward within him, he grasped it and let it billow forth like a gale at his target.
Potter stared at him in silence, and Draco had the impression of a coiled, waiting will that would drive itself over and over again into a trap if that was what it took, in order to get free. Finally, Potter nodded abruptly and said, “
Brooks grumbled and postured some more, but he had no grounds to arrest Harry when he had acted in self-defense, Moonborn was a wanted criminal plus a werewolf, and Harry hadn’t actually killed her. In the end, Brooks let him go with some mutters that Harry didn’t bother paying attention to. He walked over to Malfoy and their sons, nodding in thanks to Malfoy before he crouched down in front of James.
” Sela did lift her head from its resting place now, her tongue darting out as she considered Harry. “
Hermione snapped her head up. “What? Did someone tell you? Did you write to her?” Ron and Hermione appeared incapable of understanding that Harry had resigned himself to the end of his marriage, and had thought he was writing to Ginny every day or something.
“What about me?”
” he said, only speaking Parseltongue because if he spoke in English she would just pretend not to understand, and he would have to spend more time talking to her. “
Harry just shook his head. Probably someone trained in Parselmouth magic could. He just wasn’t.
“I don’t know. A lady. With a girl.”
The surprise in her voice made Harry open his eyes to blink at her. “
Harry shrugged and clawed the sheet away from him as he settled the glasses on his face. The dimness of his bedroom only lightened when he cast a
“Potter.”
here? People are going to hate me even more now, and gossip about me, and—”
Harry snorted a little. “I’m afraid I won’t be able to help.” He rolled his eyes at the expression of displeasure on Malfoy’s face. “I mean, sure, if you want me to talk to these people about how it feels to be marked by him in a less tangible way, fine. But no one else had the link with him that I did. My experiences are too unique to be useful.”
“It is.”
The snake snapped her tail straight, a little motion of shock, and then crawled towards him. “
Harry eyed her. “You’re using my son against me.”
“Can I speak with you, please, Malfoy?”
Potter stood still, his arms at his sides, except that he turned his head a little to follow the flows of magic with his eyes. Draco blinked and nearly dropped the strand that was unfolding in his mind. That was more participation than he’d expected.
“You’re so fucking frustrating, Potter,” Draco muttered without thinking about it.
“Not to call a Match for himself?” Parkinson asked. Goyle just shifted and grunted.
magic, there was no doubt of that, and with the help of gleaming silver snakes that extended from his hand and held the cushion in their mouths for him, instead of Levitating it.
Harry came gasping out of the nightmare that had gripped him, and rolled on his side. Sela slithered out of the way, hissing, “
“A pleasure.”
Harry twitched, but again restrained the temptation to throw everything up in the air, dart into the circle, grab James, and run away. But perhaps some of his curiosity came through, because Malfoy glanced towards him.
“How is life with your snake, Potter?”
,” Parkinson offered. “
“I can’t stand it.”
Draco watched in silence as Potter spun a masterful story, keeping every eye locked on him and his audience spellbound. He told them what they wanted to hear, flavored with just a few personal touches here and there, and told them nothing about his son and nothing that would make the school vulnerable to intruders. It was praise of the kind Draco could only have dreamed of, given the reputation of most of Parselmouths as former Death Eaters and their children being too young to make good interview subjects.
the magic? Not even Draco could do that, and he was the most experienced Parselmouth in the circle, since the gift seemed related to the length of time that someone had borne the Dark Mark.
“I know, Malfoy.” Merlin, Harry was so tired. He raked his hand through his hair and saw Malfoy focus on his scar for a moment, but Harry ignored that. “When I found out what he’d done, I did go to St. Mungo’s. But I came in with my magic storming, and—”
Draco stroked her hood to let her know that he’d heard. Yes, Potter’s Parseltongue did sound different from most voices he’d heard, including his own, his son’s, and his father’s. He sounded as if he became an animal when he spoke it. But now wasn’t the time to get into that. “
“Her name’s Jolantha Moonborn,” Potter replied, not turning around from the woman, not taking his gaze or his wand off her. “She fancied herself Fenrir Greyback’s
Astoria never referred to the Dark Lord any other way. She obviously didn’t want to use his title or his real name, but Draco would have liked her to do at least “You-Know-Who.” Sometimes he made embarrassing mistakes based on guesses. He turned in his chair, already a swivel one, to face her. “I know. But I don’t intend to practice the same rituals he did.”
“I like the school.” James was staring down at Sapphire, who lifted his head from the watery tank at James’s feet and looked up as though he was participating in the conversation. “I want to keep going.”
Parkinson said nothing, but her hand fell on his arm, and she steered him away. Behind them, the man gave a low moan.
“Of course I have. Although I don’t know for sure why you wanted them out of the way. They might make the school seem more friendly.”
Potter looked at her with those same blank eyes, and Draco had his answer as to what was wrong with Potter. He had locked away the anger he had shown Draco last time, the magic that made him who he was and lit his eyes from within, and now showed barely enough to go on walking around with. He seemed to have decided to respond to his own Parseltongue, and his snake, with passive rejection instead of active.
” Edwina flickered her tongue out. “
Harry closed his eyes wearily. He wondered what Parkinson would say if he told her about what he’d said to Ginny. Would she still be so happy
“Can we keep her, Daddy, please?” James clasped his hands and gave Harry the sort of big-eyed look he was terrible at refusing. “She could be your snake, and I could play with her, and I could put a hat on her head.”
“I’ll tell you something else that not even Draco knows,” Parkinson said. “I was in that ritual circle, and I know that you shouldn’t have been able to pick up the current of power like you did. Not when Draco started it.”
Harry touched her back, and said, “
Parkinson shrieked next, her eyes wide, the krait on her shoulder opening its mouth as if to echo her, and then Goyle wobbled in place. Scorpius made a wounded sound, and James—
Draco stifled a roll of his eyes, which Edwina had unfortunately learned to interpret. She wanted to kill everyone and everything except family and Parselmouths at all times. She had never understood why that didn’t translate to a larger human scale. When Draco had pointed out that he had many enemies from the war, Edwina had suggested saving her venom for months and then poisoning them in their sleep all at once.
,” he hissed. “A Dark Arts practitioner walking around, just allowed to do whatever he wants, thinking you’re above everybody else!”
“And you?”
“Right. Sorry.”
As, in a different way, his divorce from Astoria had. She hadn’t been horrified at all that Scorpius was a Parselmouth or that Draco had developed the trait by the time they wed; she was a little proud, in fact. But what he wanted to do with it…
you, I said. I believe James needs this, and I’ve had fewer nightmares since I accepted Sela. You don’t need to keep proving yourself over and over again. I trust you with James, and you should know that’s a trust I don’t grant to many people.”
to do it for some ulterior motive. At least I can make sure that Scorpius has access to personal power and fulfillment.”
Harry relaxed a little. Yes, Malfoy’s fixation on power was annoying, but it really did defend him and James. “No one else had, either. Like I said, though, it became much easier to claim that I was Dark after that. Voldemort returned. Unhinged. Dangerous. All of that.”
“Yes?” Malfoy sounded breathless.
Draco skimmed quickly through the article, then nodded and flipped to another. Few had much to add to the original, but they repeated the details enough for Draco to build a coherent picture of something he’d barely thought about for years.
“I thought it would be different,” Astoria whispered. “When your parents left for France and you told me that you wanted to have a life out of their shadow. That it would be—quiet. Normal. Who cares what other people think about our charitable contributions? Let’s make the ones we want to make. Let’s do what we want to do. Travel. Take care of Scorpius. Teach him that all people are good.” She was rubbing her hands up and down her arms as if she was cold.
And more strength. Why could Potter
“Hell, no, Malfoy.” Sela shifted on Potter’s shoulder when he swore, while Edwina lifted her head from the loose coil she’d been collapsed in at Draco’s feet. “I want to
And over and over, he answered it,
Harry held back his sigh. He would have to talk to Malfoy and get the names. “What did they do?”
Malfoy leaned towards him. “You handled that power like a Parselmouth who has a Match. And
“We’re talking.”
“The boys can go to the nursery.
affect your son? He’s already asked me why you insist on speaking English with him so often and why you don’t like to look straight at Sapphire.”
“You can’t.”
“Um.” Hermione spent so much time staring at the tattered thread hanging from one of her ink-splattered sleeves that Harry took pity on her.
This time, the yelp was more like a scream, and the man tried to keep a hand clapped over his ribs while bending down to grab his foot. Harry, his face burning, grabbed Parkinson’s arm. “Stop,” he hissed into her ear. “Take it off.”
Draco preserved his smile as he followed her down several aisles, but he was thinking,
Draco was still surprised that Potter had got, and retained, sole custody of his son. The Weasleys were too rabid about their children to permit such a thing, normally. But it almost certainly had something to do with the boy’s Parseltongue.
Harry sighed. They were walking through Diagon Alley, and people were whispering and pointing at him and James. It was a natural consequence of the explanation he’d given about the school, but he
And there was one avenue of appeal open to him, as little as Draco liked to think about it. Potter should want this gift for
Scorpius and Charlie didn’t provide much more than a contained pool of warmth, but that was all right. Draco smiled at his son, who was doing very well for his first calling circle. Scorpius beamed back.
“I’m going to talk to Ron and Hermione,” he said finally, his words precise. “You don’t need to worry about me. And I don’t want instruction in Parseltongue, or the magic that Sela seems to think you and I share.”
Draco closed his eyes. If this was what he had to do, he would do it, despite the fact that Potter could hardly participate in any ritual magic without a snake to steady him, and getting rid of Sela would probably hurt James. He had been full of tales about “Daddy’s snake” when he got to school today, although not enough to tell Draco her name.
The word was like a jab, and Draco swallowed down his irritation once again. It was clear that too many people had failed Potter over the years, including the Mind-Healer who had betrayed all his secrets and the wife who had walked away. Draco would
Harry turned his head, hearing James’s voice coming down the corridor. If there was one conversation he didn’t want James to witness, it was this one.
They were in the drawing room, a large room with a little sunken area in the middle of it that Harry could fill with balls or pillows for James, and had been the reason he’d bought the house. James was hovering a cushion in front of him now.
He thought Parkinson would drop her arm and leave in disgust. He was good at making people do that. But Parkinson only marched closer, so that Sela’s head was only a few centimeters from Harry’s elbow. She still couldn’t cross the distance, though. Or, presumably, they wanted him to do a bit of symbolic reaching-out.
But he had. And for all the disgusted looks the Aurors were giving him and the fact that they kept asking him the same questions again and again, trying to trap him into admitting that he’d used Dark Arts, he didn’t regret what he’d done. He had to make sure James was safe. Scorpius and Malfoy didn’t deserve to suffer, either.
” said James anxiously, and turned to stare at Harry.
Draco blinked at the look on his face. It was the most open Potter had been since walking in today.
” James hissed happily, and trotted over to the other side of the broad classroom space, which was done in calming greens and blues. Harry wasn’t blind to the fact that the large space had a ritual circle sketched around it, but he did trust Malfoy when he said that no Parselmouth would be doing rituals this young.
But Draco couldn’t earn the trust of a man who had impaled himself on a thicket of blades, either.
“Potter,” he breathed.
“She’s pregnant, isn’t she?”
Draco returned the papers to their place in the shelves and headed thoughtfully towards the entrance. Clarissa giggled and fluttered at him. Draco nodded to her and kept going, mind turning towards the next planned class where he, Scorpius, James, and Potter would all be present, two days from now.
!” She dropped her wand and swiped with her left hand at Potter, the claws she had in place of nails glinting in the sunlight.
“You’re an idiot.”
“Why would you assume that your presence would be more of a deterrent than an attraction?” Draco asked then. He half-hoped that having two questions to answer at once would make Potter drop a few more hints about the inside of his skull.
Sela was quiet. Harry leaned back on the pillows and stared at the ceiling. He knew from experience that this mood meant he wouldn’t be going back to sleep. He did wonder what Sela was thinking, but he still started when she answered.
“Here we are!” Parkinson finally said in a bright tone, and held out what looked like a clump of yellow yarn.
“And to see all the editions for a particular month?”
Sela demanded. Edwina spoke the same words at almost the same time, although she didn’t bother adding the title at the end.
it when someone revealed that he was vulnerable like that. And luckily enough, the people on the street couldn’t understand Sela, but Parkinson certainly could.
, when he couldn’t offer her anything.
“You’re abandoning him!”
“How can you claim this
James was sitting up in bed, his eyes wide. He didn’t have the usual tears, though. Harry looked around the room decorated in soft blues and greens, wondering if he had cast accidental magic and startled himself awake, instead of with a nightmare.
It had been almost eight years since Draco had seen him—since the Battle of Hogwarts, in fact. And two years since there was anything more than a fleeting picture in the paper snapped of Potter walking through Diagon Alley. He’d quit his Auror job, quit going into public, quit
“Who was it?”
Harry turned to Malfoy. The man was studying him thoughtfully, his cobra curled around his throat but silent. Harry shrugged to himself and asked, “Did James get in trouble in class today? He’s not good at sitting still for long periods of time, I’m afraid.”
Sela touched her tongue to his neck. Again, Harry let the anger go and focused on James, cradled in his arms, the most important person in the world.
“You’ve made sure the children are out of the way?” Harry asked, without turning his head to look at Malfoy. The reporters were close enough that he could make out the gleam of the sun from the silver robes that many of them had started to wear after the war to identify themselves as official employees of the papers.
When was the last time someone had done something like this for him?
Potter twisted his head a little in Draco’s direction without looking away from his victim. “She still isn’t retreating,” he muttered. “I don’t know for sure what she’s going to try, but—”
Draco jerked his head violently to the side, and Potter followed him to the right, far enough away from their children that Draco was fairly sure they wouldn’t hear, although Potter did still keep looking over his shoulder. Draco claimed his attention with another sharp jerk of his head. “
“I participated without one.”
Parkinson seemed to be fumbling in her bag. Harry watched, his heart rate accelerating, ready to leap away if this turned out to be some kind of ambush. It was, but not the kind he’d thought.
If it was another child at the school who had done this, Harry would insist on it being properly addressed. If it was one of the adult Parselmouths who taught there…
Harry crossed over to his son and crouched on the brick rim of the sunken area. James grinned at him. “I’m doing it, Daddy!”
And a man he hadn’t known at all, and couldn’t anticipate.
“Tell me some more about that.”
kids. You think I want my son marked that way?” Ginny wiped a hand across her face, knocking loose the tears. “And no, Harry. I tried. That’s why I stayed for a year after he started talking. I thought maybe I could get used to it. But I can’t. Having a son who speaks Parseltongue just brings up my old nightmares of Riddle.”
“Why are you being so…”
could have been sent by an enemy.
“Children of other Marked Death Eaters?” Harry asked as politely as possible.
But they’d both been kids then—although it
,” Parkinson said. “That man approached you when you hadn’t said a word to him, hadn’t even bumped into him. Don’t you deserve some peace from that? Doesn’t
Draco understood it better then. Potter hadn’t suddenly decided that he did want to be companion to a snake or Draco’s partner in ritual magic. He was doing this to deflect criticism and hatred back to himself.
,” she hissed softly into his ear as she coiled around his neck. “
“Because I do lose my temper,” Harry said. “And I am a Parselmouth. And they associate that with Voldemort.”
Draco’s heart hurt for a long minute at the thought of Scorpius being hit, of him dying, of James dying, of their snakes dying, but Potter gestured sharply, and cobbles from the street leaped up and into the way of the green spell. They blew apart in pointed shards that bounced from the shield around Draco and the glimmering, moving red one that Draco saw now encased their children. But at least the Killing Curse was gone.
Ron’s eyes softened. “I know about that. You want your son to have a different reputation with the public than you had.”
Harry rolled his eyes and didn’t answer, just going to the bathroom and putting Sela down on the counter while he used the loo. She coiled and stared at herself in the mirror, head swaying back and forth a little. Harry glanced in the mirror himself, and then turned away sharply. He missed the days when it wouldn’t make him flinch to look at his own reflection.
“She just wants to work with someone who was in Gryffindor House,” Potter interrupted. Draco fumed, but held his peace. “There must be someone else who was. Or who would find the honor of working with a Gryffindor snake greater than they—who would find it an honor.”
“But it ate away her flesh,” muttered the other Auror, a trainee young enough that Harry hadn’t known her as a full-fledged Auror before he retired. He gave her a mild glance, and she flinched in turn, but squared her shoulders and met his eyes with her own dark brown ones, which at least made her braver than Brooks.
Parkinson frowned. “But what about—”
The next instant, the man let out a loud yelp and slapped his hand to his side, over his ribs. Parkinson nodded in what looked like peaceful amusement, her mouth curving. “That’s what it would feel like to have Isabella nip you. Now apologize.”
Harry ignored that, nodded to Parkinson, said, “Thank you for bringing her to me, Miss Parkinson,” and then cast a Disillusionment Charm on Sela. It was going to be harder to forget about her than it was to hide her, especially with her tail tightening as Harry walked down the street away from Parkinson and Isabella. But that didn’t matter.
Harry had snapped harder than he meant to, but Parkinson only laughed as if he’d said something witty. “Exactly.” She eyed him for a second, and then the shutters seemed to fall open behind her eyes. “Listen, Potter, you’re a Parselmouth, like the rest of us. I’m only trying to help you.”
” Potter said, opening his eyes and showing a flash of pure green that made Draco feel uneasy.
Pansy Parkinson had fallen into step beside him as he walked through Diagon Alley to go to the shops. Harry bit back the urge to curse, and nodded distantly to her. “Parkinson. How are you?”
“Daddy, Daddy!”
And although there might have been people, like Astoria, who would say the same about Draco, Draco didn’t think it was the case. He’d had friendships and the goal of staring the school and promoting other Parselmouths and Parseltongue ritual magic from the time Scorpius was an infant. Potter appeared to have nothing except James and his obsessive circling around the boy.
” He deliberately hadn’t invited any
Harry thought briefly.
Harry bent down and wrapped his arms around James as he burst out of the corridor into the schoolroom. He buried his face against his son’s hair and breathed in the soft sweetness of it.
“Daddy!”
“Of course I do.” Draco sighed when she stared at him expectantly. “What would you have me do, Astoria? We’ve lost so much of our reputation and our money. We can’t even do good works without someone sneering at us for
!” Scorpius reached into the terrarium, towards the small ball of green scales that marked Charlie’s curled, sleeping form.
Potter spent a long moment sitting with his fingers driving like knives into his knee. Finally, he glanced at Draco. The tightness had faded from his jaw, and the blankness from his eyes, but it had left a different kind of blankness behind, a polite kind that Draco knew must form the mask Potter used to shield himself from most people.
“Mr. Potter, the freedom of the press demands—”
Malfoy stared at him with his mouth slightly open. Harry ignored that, too. He would put up with a lot to have a competent teacher for James’s Parseltongue, and amazingly, it did seem that Malfoy was that. Of course, that might only be because his passion for making Parselmouths strong and achieving power through rituals had overruled his blood prejudice, but Harry would take it.
She did send the divorce papers in the morning. And Harry and James (more to the point) hadn’t seen her in the past two years.
To appeal to his son? If James had been by himself and spoken innocently to the snake, or been attracted to pick it up…
Harry chose to shrug and wait. None of the people coming up to the path now were as bad as Skeeter, that was one consolation. They chose to salivate after him, but they reported the truth more often, and took delight in more things than scandal.
seeing her cry like this. She hadn’t even done it when it became clear that James’s first language was Parseltongue and that his English was slow and late in coming.
“Yes.” Draco glanced at his wife with a frown. They were in Draco’s study, which he had taken over from his father when Lucius had decided that enough was enough and he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life in Britain. Narcissa had been more than happy to “retire” with Father to France. “Is there something wrong with that?”
The reality being that he was already scarred and scarring and
“My Parseltongue has caused enough damage,” Harry said, and then regretted it when he saw how Parkinson recoiled. He shut his eyes and tried out the breathing exercises he’d looked up for himself after he learned that going to Mind-Healers was futile. He breathed a few times to the count of ten, and then said, “I don’t want to pursue the magic the way that you and Malfoy and the rest do.”
He had never
The boy walking at his side, clinging to his leg, had unruly red hair and brilliant brown eyes when he shyly peered around his father at Draco, who stood with Edwina, Scorpius, and Charlie in the middle of the grand blue-and-white ballroom. Draco stifled disappointment he didn’t understand at the fact that the boy didn’t have green eyes. No reason he should inherit them.
Sela said nothing else, and Harry returned to bed and lay looking at the ceiling, his hand smoothing restlessly over the blankets, until morning arrived.
Sela’s tongue darted out, and she tilted her head in a motion that was neither a yes nor a no. “
“No. I wanted to let you know that I went to the Ministry Archives and sorted through the
Draco looked away from Potter and breathed deeply to calm the swimming black-and-white dots in his vision. “
Harry closed his eyes, and felt the cool brush of Sela’s scales against his arm. “
Potter didn’t flinch. “It doesn’t matter,” he repeated, and then turned around and wandered back towards his son, as if he was unable to help himself.
Harry took a long step deliberately nearer Malfoy. “I don’t think I need your help.”
Ron had just come in through the door and was shedding his Auror robes. Harry leaned back to smile at him. “Hey. Have a good day chasing down villainous Dark wizards?”
It wasn’t much of an effort for Harry to ignore Sela, too.
He sounded as if he was making a proclamation from on high, and his eyes were shining again. Draco wondered for a moment what it would be like to see them shine with something other than resignation or regret or guilt. Then he shook himself out of that. It was too tempting to follow that vision laid out like a path, and it also meant that he would end up dashing himself to pieces against the rock wall Potter had raised between himself and the world.
Malfoy was quiet, his eyebrows still bent as if he was trying to think of some way to make Harry’s words not be true. The cobra around his neck woke up and aimed her snout at Harry. Harry let his hands rest by his sides, where he could get to his wand and snap up a shield in seconds if he needed it.
“Bold of you to assume he would be comfortable enough to ask in the first place.”
Harry glanced over his shoulder, and whatever was in his eyes made Malfoy falter and fall silent, and Malfoy’s cobra rear up and hiss.
as the power surged past him. He was stretching out his hands and whisper-hissing, and Harry could almost hear the hissing of the snake that would come for him.
Dust shook into the air as the papers hurtled towards them. Draco stepped neatly aside and let them stack themselves on the only table in this section of the Archives, which had a chair in front of it. When the flights had stopped, he sat down and sorted through them slowly.
himself. “And if you actually cared, Malfoy, then maybe I would listen to you. But you don’t.”
“Your magic resonates with mine.” Malfoy smiled without using his eyes. “Potter, you
Now,” Draco continued in English, since it was important for Scorpius to get practice with both languages, “why don’t you go to your bedroom and have Kala help you dress?”
"Oh, yes, of course! I have it in the fridge, would you like me to warm it up?" Lupin asked, turning toward his kitchen unit.
The man allowed him access to very intimate affairs within the muggle community of Great Britain. Access to news all over the country, an ear to the door of all government operations.
He was relieved to find that there didn't seem to be anyone pursuing him. He supposed that all the chaos he had caused had overwhelmed the facility too much for them to immediately dispatch any squads to arrest him. He considered it a blessing, but decided to focus on getting back to his alleyway. He had no idea how to proceed from there.
Harry glared at Lupin, feeling indignant and angry. "You have no idea what I've been through! What it's like to go through what those men have done! They deserved to die!"
Taking a deep breath, and recomposing herself, she continued the task at hand.
-////-
Harry pleaded.
Harry's eyes showed his internal conflict. He felt so alone, he didn't trust Remus, no matter how much he wanted to. Everything in his heart told him that he could only be hurt by allowing the wolf a place in his heart.
"Yes, I've already expressed my concern to you about his state of wellbeing. It's been eating at me that he's in constant danger, while residing in a place that's supposed to be his home." She wasn't exactly lying, that helped her not to betray her to his impeccable sense for lies.
His torso was especially tender, which was unfortunately the place that Delphi preferred to take up residence. This made her annoyed, not with Harry, but with his "guardians."
Harry took notice of these details while making it seem as if he were simply enjoying the music. It stopped for a moment, which caused Harry to look at the man again. The guitarist seemed shocked by the scar on Harry's forehead. The boy looked down, pushing his glasses up his face and pulling his fringe over the blemish.
"Remus?" He asked, alerted by the front door opening and closing.
The small child clenched his jaw as stabbing pain rippled through him, he sat against the wall of his cupboard waiting for the snake to strike or do anything. He closed his eyes tight, waiting for his reptilian visitor to make it's move. A moment passed before he cracked his eye open, to see the snake poised before him in a rather non-threatening stance. Or as non-threatening as a snake could display for a visually impaired four year old.
She had to control her voice as it threatened to shake. "What would that be, Albus?"
Delphi questioned, she still seemed sluggish and tired. Her tone gained energy by the minute.
"I want a list of their Identification and cell numbers, every one you can manage." Harry demanded, Bernard rushed into the backroom, visibly sweating and shaking. Harry watched him hurry to a desk, on which sat a bulky desktop computer.
He quickly ran into the place, searching for anything that could lead him to his goal. On the wall was a directory, he followed it to the records room, in administration. He heard heavy footsteps approaching rapidly. He sprinted off as fast as he could towards the records office.
It was very sparsely decorated. A couple of picture frames hung from the walls, curiously they all seemed to be animatedly moving. From his position on the couch he wasn't able to see who the subject of these moving photographs was. Across from the couch sat a small television set. Next to Harry sat the remote, which he picked up and pressed the power button. With a click the television came to life with a news broadcast; said broadcast covered Harry's escapade from the previous night.
She poised herself lazily, her remaining mass that couldn't be lifted coiled around her. To Harry, she almost seemed like a human sitting with her legs crossed. The thought amused him, he relaxed slightly.
-////-
Said Harry as he sat on the last step in front of the door. Anxiously, he combed his hand through his messy hair to calm his nerves.
Papers shuffled as Dumbledore leafed through various documents anxiously. His hands trembled with the stress and smoldering anger he felt burning within his chest. The days following Harry's disappearance hadn't been kind to the old wizard, as he scrambled to maintain his reputation and influence among the chaos.
Harry choked as a wad of soil and sod was stuffed into his mouth and crumbled down the back of his throat, the fibres of grass tickled his uvula. He gagged as he tried to rid his mouth of the debris. The boys surrounding him laughed. As he managed to spit out most of what was in his mouth he recieved a blow to his facs, courtesy of Dudley's dirt covered leather dress shoe. Harry felt his jaw nearly dislocate. He lay in the grass another few seconds, his blind daze deepening. More blows began to rain down on him from all angles. One thought ran through Harry's head. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
Vernon attempted to scream through his restricted airway as a slash appeared along his wrist, very close to his mangled hand. Harry took a few steps forward, hand still pointed at his uncle, his thumb and middle finger tips together. He twisted his hand sharply as he snapped his fingers. A crack sounded through the concrete room, reverberating in a morbidly satisfying way.
"May I help you, headmaster?" The feline woman asked, curtly.
"Who are you?"
He reached into his magic, and directed it toward the section of the fence in front of him. He twisted his magic until he felt it click, and he willed the steel of the fence to deform and bend. He went as quickly as he could, while making as little noise as he could manage. He stopped when he had just enough clearance to walk through. He was lucky that there was no patrol nearby, he hoped that it would last.
The dream seemed to continue forever, Harry finding a variety of methods to inflict pain. At one point Harry removed each of Vernon's teeth individually. Harry shuddered as a mix of disgust and pleasure ran through him. He decided to not dwell further on the disturbing occurrence.
Delphi did as she was told, as she descended Harry returned her to full size with a whisper. Bernard yelped as the huge snake approached him, cowering further as she bound the man in her scaly and muscular body. Harry walked briskly toward the records associate. Harry did his best to disguise his voice.
She thought for a moment, going over the lithe beautiful sound of the name.
Harry continued to flee at the maximum speed he could muster. Which wasn't incredibly fast, he was in agony. He limped heavily, and each step was nauseatingly painful. He walked generally in the direction of the city, doing his best not to lose consciousness from pain alone.
It took Harry 10 minutes to eat just a few bites. An abnormal feeling began to creep into his head, like a fog obscuring his thoughts. Something was wrong, each breath felt thick. His eyes rolled slowly in their sockets. He slowly became more sluggish and laboured. The world dissolved before him as unknowingness consumed him.
It had been a few days since Harry had seen Minerva, he was beginning to get anxious. His eyes scanned the sidewalk for any hint of a glasses clad tabby cat. Something collided painfully with the side of his skull. He clutched his now aching head gingerly, that would bruise soon.
She came to the conclusion that it would have to be a ravenclaw. Someone smart, though reserved and private enough to keep things to themselves. Too studious and hyperfixated on reading to have any curiosity or interest in her asking to borrow an owl.
Harry considered using Remus while he could, exhausting what resources he could before moving on to wherever else he wished.  He couldn't very well stay in this town. Not with both Remus and the authorities attempting to trace him, and very possibly other wizards.
"Depends, what does your friend look like?" Harry did his best to maintain his image of childlike ignorance.
"Forgive me, Headmaster, if I'm not one of the ministry's drones who will believe your prattling based purely on your authority."
She offered, she still didn't quite understand the concept of currency and theft. Nor that the latter was considered unacceptable and could land them both in extreme trouble.
Remus Lupin"
When he awoke, the room was brighter, but not by much. Soft sunlight filtered through the closed curtains of the sparsely furnished room. All that resided in the room was a twin sized bed, and a nightstand sitting beside it. Atop the nightstand stood a lamp, next to it a glass of water and an analogue clock which read nine a.m. He also noticed the weight of a shrunken Delphinium coiled onto the bed beside him. He whispered the engorgio charm and returned her to size. She continued to sleep beside him.
A small voice whispered, almost being lost among the white noise. The visions continued to warp and shift around him, his head was dunked into a paint mixer of tortures.
"Of course. I know what I am doing, he needs to remain at the Dursley household. The wards set by his mother are the only thing standing between him and Voldemort. If he were to be removed, we couldn't hope to replicate the level of security he has in that place."
There was a long and pregnant pause. Harry scoffed. "What? A werewolf? Do you expect me to believe that?"
"You see, I had noticed you'd visited the boy during a lesson, again. I decided to shadow you." The edges of his eyes wrinkled as they narrowed. The witch's heart stopped. She was afraid to speak, she felt the blood drain from her face. He continued to speak.
When Harry woke up he didn't know what time it was, or what day it was. His eyes were nearly crusted shut with sleep. He felt bloated and sore. He looked over his arms, which lay limp in front of him; his skin was a myriad of ugly bruised colours. The surface was coated in thin long scabs, like someone had scraped him with a stick, repeatedly. His skin looked like a quilt, swollen and lumpy.
"No! Please, Uncle, please!" Harry cried. "Wai-" He choked as Vernon pressed his palm to Harry's throat, while holding his jaw in place. Harry tried to turn away, poinlessly, while Vernon taped his mouth closed.
"I don't think I've seen her, mister, sorry. I think you should be going, my mum doesn't like me talking to strangers. I'm supposed to be weeding." Harry did his best to appear anxious about his 'mum' being upset, instead of the danger posed by this stranger. Harry realized he was leaning awkwardly to take pressure off of his tail bone. He straightened his posture, his jaw tightened at the twinge of pain.
Minerva felt tears coming to her eyes.
"How do you know my name?" Harry knew the voice, though he couldn't see who it belonged to. The room was dimly lit, what little light sparsely illuminated the space made Harry's eyes ache slightly. He heard Lupin let out a chuckle.
He was too exhausted and anguished to cry anymore, or move. Everything hurt too much. He just laid there for the rest of the night, and much of the next morning. To him, nothing could cause him more pain than he had just experienced. He had much to experience.
It hadn't occurred to the boy that Remus would find out about the previous night in such a manner, and it dawned on him how horrific it would seem to any other person. He had essentially committed an atrocity. With a shaking voice, the older man spoke.
The masked child was taken aback. He thought for a second before replying, "I'm afraid I've forgotten."
She nearly flinched as Dumbledore started walking toward her, she realised she was still standing on front of the door as he said, "I'll be excusing myself now."
He called quietly into the night, hoping she was awake. Or that she even had the energy to carry out any sort of conversation.
"Yes. You can see where the issue lies. This is quite serious, Minerva. The consequences for this could potentially be extreme." A glint in his cunning, steely eyes told her he had more to say.
Her tone was wary, almost urgent. Harry didn't answer, he didn't want to risk the stranger hearing him. He almost jumped when the aged man spoke to him.
"I- I can't. I couldn't. It's too much to bear." He couldn't risk to be inhibited by such a relationship with anyone other than Delphi.
"It's not very safe for a boy to be wandering the streets by himself."
"There's more to your visit than relaying your discovery of my transgression, isn't there?" McGonagal asked.
Harry was frustrated, he had been standing on the corner trying to get some attention for 15 minutes. Finally, Harry decided to call out a particular man on the street.
Harry set his gaze on the pot, and felt inside himself mentally. Looking for any sign of his magic as it had been described to him. He pressed his eyes shut, and searched deeper. He opened his eyes again, only to see the pot undisturbed. It hadn't so much as moved a milimetre from the spot he'd placed it.
"Oh, but I am. Furthermore, you will not continue to insist upon his removal from the Dursley household."
Harry called out, quietly. Doing his best to not be heard by anyone else.
He sat there for another moment, unmoving. He started to look around, he was in the basement of the Dursley house. His clothes had been tossed into a corner by the stairs. He got up and stumbled over to the little pile, and clumsily pulled his garments on. Then he slowly, and painfully climbed the stairs, and busted through the door. The sound of it slamming against the wall startled Petunia who was cutting vegetables in the kitchen, whete the basement entrance was located. She brandished the knife at him in defense.
Nary an inch of his skin wasn't covered in a shade of red, purple, blue, or yellow. The only sign that he had a shred of life in him were the shallow breaths he tried to take, his lungs wouldn't inhale. He felt like he was suffocating. Like his lungs were full, but he needed more air, he couldn't exhale. Suddenly, his ability to breathe returned to him, like having a heavy boot step off his ribs.
Harry took that to heart. It was then that he decided to only ever trust Delphinium. He never wanted to feel this pain again.
He made a sprint for the front of the prison, avoiding uniformed officers as they made their rounds, dropping low to the ground to make a smaller target to spot. Their flashlights made them easy enough to avoid, but it was a long distance to traverse. It took him several minutes to near the structure.
Harry's glittering green eyes glared at the bulging, roll covered back walking toward the front door. The fabric of the large man's sweater vest stretching and pulling across his flabby skin. Sweat darkened the crevices between the folds.
"What? You can't be serious!"
He yelled again as the object pulled out and slammed back into him roughly. The pain slowly faded with each thrust, until each was just a throb amongst a dull ache. His fear was gone after a few minutes. Replaced by numbers and apathy. Emerald eyes faded and glazed, unseeing, though there was nothing wrong with them. He could hear Vernon huffing heavy breaths, pleasure was evident in his gasps and groans. Harry felt meaty palms and fingers roaming his skin, groping his private areas, along with wherever else his uncle could reach.
The reptile questioned, examining the patchwork of bruises and swelling that dominated his flesh.
"Hello! How are you today, young man?" Hid voice was kind, and possessed a wizened eccentric energy.
He fell hard, the ground forced the air from his lungs as his back and skull collided with dirt and sod. Spots danced before Harry's eyes as he struggled to breathe, he coughed and felt flecks of copper dot the back of his tongue while his lungs bled slightly within his ribcage. He finaly managed to pull in a few small, precious breaths before he rolled on his side. He touched the back of his throbbing head and gasped as a wave of pain struck like lightning, he brought his fingers into his sight to find the tips dyed red. He slowly rolled onto his stomach, nausea and pain wracked his frame. With each shallow breath he felt something in his chest shift painfully, unnaturally. As he slowly brought his body off the ground he felt a new blow strike him in his abdomen. New pain exploded in his stomach as air was forced back out of him, he retched, it was almost lucky that today was one of those days where the Dursleys neglected to give him any form of breakfast.
The doorknob began to turn, causing Remus to realise he hasn't been breathing. He drew a couple calming breaths before the door drifted open, he stood in the entrance to see Harry on the toilet looking sheepish. The serpents tail slipped from behind the door, apparently it had been the one to open it.
At this Harry lifted his shirt to reveal Delphinium wrapped around his torso. She had momentarily forgotten about the snake, she was too absorbed in revealing to Harry the infirmation he'd been denied. Harry spoke again to the snake.
With that, she turned back toward the stairs and headed down, hoping her role as Harry's teacher wouldn't be cut short.
"Yes please." Harry relaxed against the back cushion of the couch. His eyes ached at the sunlight coming in through the curtains windows. The aching wasn't anything he couldn't handle though, so he looked around the room.
-////-
It was, conveniently, not a long walk for him. The prison happened to be only a few kilometers from where Harry had taken up residence. This was going to be a very large undertaking, he would have to accomplish as much as he possibly could in a single night. He had no doubts that security would increase immediately after his work was complete.
"It's my job to know your name. Though, just about everyone in the wizarding world knows your name. You're famous after all."
She sighed and rested her head in her hands, rubbing her temples. She would have to continue her contemplation later, it was bringing her undue stress. Besides, she needed to finish her grading.
"I'm going to do everything I can to remove you from that environment, you hear me? I promise," She told him, her voice filled with determination.
-////-
The boy with messy, dark hair grimaced as he pushed himself to his feet. Limping slightly to the bucket, he picked it up, slowly bending over. He did his best not to agitate his injuries. He looked over the garden and the lawn. He was forced to perform near constant maintenance on the yard, which meant that weeds weren't a huge issue. Though they sprung up all the time regardless. Petunia insisted that herbicides would harm her precious flora.
Harry ran as if the devil were on his heels, which wasn't too far off, as Dudley could easily be compared to the anti-christ; albeit a very, very fat anti-christ. Running at this speed meant tearing up garden soil and flora alike, which didn't mean much to Harry, considering his health was at stake. That and Dudley's goons were doing far more damage in their uncoordinated and clumsy persuit.
came soft, congradulatory hissing.
"How could you understand? You don't know what it's like; to be hated for what you are, to be misunderstood, to be used... abandoned." Harry continued to cry, he didn't mean to open up so much. The stress of everything was finally breaking him.
Bernard's eyes widened with that information, he had no choice but to believe the boy, considering what he had seen in the last few moments. He and Harry waited together for the next few minutes. When the pages finished printing Harry simply grabbed them, and thanked the records keeper.
"What?! You aren't going to remove him from the Dursley home?"
Harry Potter was six years old now, and his sweet innocence was already bleeding away to bitterness. He hobbled forward through the small garden, on his thin legs that had only enough muscle for him to walk and work; he was searching for weeds, without gloves or tools of any kind. He didn't even have shoes on his tiny, dirt caked feet. The summer sun beat down on his back, which was barely covered by the tank top that used to belong to his grotesquely fat cousin. The shirt hung loose off the malnourished frame, exposing more skin to the burning rays of the season. It also exposed a patchwork of bruises, a lattice work of scars, and a battlefield of small circular bruises that pock-marked his torso.
He quickly changed into it, and set out, electing to carry Delphi upon His shoulders after realising the reducto charm would make her small enough to be easily shouldered for long periods of time. His destination: The Thornwell Mid Level Security Prison.
The bearded wizard contemplated her words for a moment, her breath felt as if it were caught in her throat.
Within the first few weeks Harry had an elementary grasp on almost everything a first year would have learned up to that point, the animagus was astonished how well he grasped each subject considering his age. He excelled in the theoretical aspects of magic the greatest, often coming up with complex analogies that nonetheless made near perfect sense in relation to the actual magical action or occurrence. Sadly, their lessons would cease soon enough.
Albus' smile twitched quickly into a frown, but resumed a confident and subtle smile. He placed the model broom back on her desk, taking the time to position it as it had been before. It irked her that he touched her belongings so lackadaisically; He thought he had her against the proverbial ropes.
The witch opened a drawer to her left, removing a sheet of parchment from it. She wrote to Remus, giving him more information on the situation in regards to Dumbledore, and giving more background. She also expressed her gratitude for making the effort to house the child.
"Before I went to sleep, you mentioned food?" Coincidentally his stomach growled loudly at that moment. Harry blushed.
Harry decided he should explore his new environment, a small city that he discovered was a considerable distance from the Dursley residence by way of a map. Said map was appropriated from a small travel shop nearby to his alleyway hideout. Unfortunately Delphinium could not accompany the boy without suspicion or outright causing panic.
Harry was so absorbed in learning about his achievements that he hasn't noticed Remus returning from the kitchen. Harry was slightly startled when he saw Lupin standing beside the couch, plate of food in hand. His expression was that of horror, which deepened when a footage of Harry running down the halls. The costume was easily identifiable as the one he had found Harry wearing.
Albus' mouth twitched slightly, she was beginning to irritate him. "I won't have you using that sort of tongue toward me. I am your superior, I won't hesitate to use that against you. I am under the impression that you like your job. It'd be a shame if you lost it, for using inappropriate language toward the headmaster."
"See that I have nothing hidden?" Harry asked, smiling and raising his brows.
It was a good idea, one that he had already thought of. It wasn't lethal, as long as Harry didn't mess about Vernon wouldn't even be harmed in the process.
"I think so." Harry slowly began to eat the food. It wasn't much, some cheap pork sausages from the local deli and a bowl of microwave oatmeal. A few minutes into his breakfast he realised an issue: how would he use the toilet with his injury?
The man seemed to struggle more as Harry flattened and smoothed the papers, making him more curious. Harry couldn't have been prepared for what the sheets revealed. They were physical documentation of the man's sinister past, horrible acts performed by one Charles Crocker. Harry learned some new words, such as sex offender, child molester, and sexual assault. Now he knew what to call what happened to him.
Her heart stopped, so had the motion of her tail. How had he found her out? He couldn't have really, she hoped. She decided to continue playing the role of unambiguous stray. Her head cocked to the side to, her face neutral. She made a quiet noise like she was annoyed, as a normal cat would be if a person decided to interrupt their peaceful sunbathing session. Harry furrowed his brow, his jaw set.
"Do as you like, I can only advise you. Your authority supersedes my own." She said, a hint of defiance tinted her tone. The Headmaster seemed momentarily taken aback, like he expected her to fight further, and prove his internal hypothesis.
Soon, Delphinium slithered through her port hole in the wall. Her alarm and fear was almost palpable, her aura impressed that upon him without words or expressions.
He was entering his town, the street lights made his eyes hurt. It was getting harder and harder to breathe, his sight was blurring into blobs and streaks. He stumbled for a few more blocks before collapsing. Near the end of the street he saw a silhouette. He babbled an incoherent stream of noises that were supposed to be a call for help. His vision faded momentarily to black.
The windows nearby rattled with such force that they flexed and cracked, startling Petunia, who had been listening intently to the "scuffle" as it escalated. She ran outside to intervene, and found a clear new path that had been torn through her prized garden. Her already brewing anger boiled over into rage at the destruction of her (Actually Harry's) work. She ran around the garden patch, not wanting to contribute to the damage. She found more devastation just around the corner. Scattered around the sideyard were peices of jagged white wood and a few child sized bodies, surrounding a small shallow crater. At the center of said crater was her abomination of a nefew.
Harry's eyes would have popped out of their sockets like corks from over pressurized champagne bottles if they were any wider. Why could he possibly be famous? What could he have done to warrant his name being common place among witches and wizards like some sort of pop culture icon? Such a large revelation, yet it only brought forth more questions in his head. Nothing was making sense.
Harry began to run out of ways he could think of with what magic he knew, while also having the man remain identifiable. So the green eyed child decided to terminate the older persons suffering. With a wave of Harry's hand, a large slash appeared across Charles' throat. He soon died of his external bleeding, paired with whatever internal bleeding he was already suffering from. Harry left him behind, a mission formulating in his mind.
This isn't a ploy to get attention, I don't mind if I don't get much in the way of feedback while I'm on hiatus. It would just be appreciated, and might help me get back on track creatively.
"Please place your hand on mine, make sure it stays still, no funny business!" The man made a sound of affirmation to Harry's command, and complied. Under his breath, Harry muttered a transfiguration spell.
"Wai- wait, what?" He ran toward her, until the fence stopped him. "Professor! Wait! Please!"
"I've always viewed you as a motherly figure, I'm sure that you're very truly concerned for they boy's wellbeing. Or, so I hope you are. I pray that this message isn't a mistake, and that you don't divulge this information to any unsavory characters. Please send a response as soon as you're able, I hope that you can provide necessary information. I'm afraid though, I don't know how long I can sustain the both of us.
"I thought I told you to get to weeding?" Growled his extremely heavyset uncle, Vernon. His face, practically swollen with adipose tissue, was twisted into an ugly scowl; his brow was furrowed deeply, a vein bulging from his temple.
Harry was once more up an about, albeit, slowly and painfully. During the interim before he could move enough to complete tasks, he got a meal once a day, for each of the 3 days that he rested. It was miraculous that he was even up to begin with. He likely shouldn't have been, as every movement was still excruciating.
This turned out to be a mistake, as the moment he moved his injured leg it essentially exploded with pain. Emerald eyes squeezed shut and his jaw clenched, he resisted the urge to cry out. He grunted through gritted teeth and looked at himself. He was naked with the exception of his boxer briefs and a very large T-shirt that he assumed belonged to Remus. It smelled of dog, he picked a long black hair out of the well worn cotton. Delphi seemed only mildly perturbed by these movements.
Harry looked Delphinium in the eyes and said,
"I've been told not to talk to strangers, mister." Harry replied, innocently, but verging on being curt.
-////-
-////-
He looked over to see a remarkably large snake sluggishly slithering toward him, in the dark he could almost swear he saw a groggy expression on her face. He knew this was a ridiculous notion, considering she was a snake, with no ability to emote. But he couldn't shake the impression.
“And for yourself?” Draco sounded more urgent than was probably warranted, at least if he wanted Potter to be open to him, but Merlin, this was driving him
“Yes, but Ginny would,” Harry said, and that ended the conversation, as far as he was concerned. He would listen during dinner when Ron and Hermione talked to him again about the Parselmouth school, but his mind was made up. James adored being around Scorpius, he adored learning how to care for Sapphire, and from what Harry had seen when he toured the school, the teachers were doing a surprisingly good job.
“Then I’ll work on becoming more comfortable with that. But part of the answer is just that parents and children
But it was clear that waiting on Potter to do it was useless, and so Draco simply nodded and said, “
The power bucked harder now, no longer painful but restless. Harry ignored that, too, and looped the others carefully back into it, the humans along with their snakes. Parkinson and her krait came back into it, and Goyle and his constrictor. For long moments, Scorpius and his boomslang remained outside it, but Harry smiled at him encouragingly, and finally the little boy smiled back and began to resonate with the power again.
Scorpius Malfoy laughed, sounding more surprised than anything. Malfoy raised his eyebrows, but then smiled. “
Before Malfoy could retort, Harry plastered a smile on his face and stepped forwards with a small bow of his head. “Welcome, welcome. I wanted to invite you personally to the Parselmouth School and explain why my son is attending.”
” Draco hissed to soothe her, and then went back to considering Potter. His face had frozen in the kind of mask Draco had worn himself when he didn’t know what was happening and which way he should react. “In the meantime, Potter, I can take care of her.” He held out his arm.
“Everyone would be too afraid to touch it?”
him with James?”
Malfoy was silent as Harry went to collect James and Sapphire. He renewed the water charm around the sea krait and nodded absently to James as he chattered, in a mixture of Parseltongue and English, about all the history and magic he had learned in class that day.
“I thought it was just talk.”
Harry had got in the way of the person who could have damaged all of them. Other than being a father to James, it was practically the only thing he was good at.
Harry tried to leap forwards, but he was standing too far away, and behind Parkinson besides. The curse hit the man, and he shut his eyes and shouted, then started patting himself all over, as if he thought he was going to find another limb or head.
The power paused for a long moment, wavering back and forth, and then it leaped forwards again. Harry assumed it was reaching out in the calling, but then Malfoy gave a hoarse yell, and when Harry spun around to face him, he knew that something had started to go wrong. The cobra on Malfoy’s shoulder had turned a sickly yellow color, and so did the magic that was flowing from him to the others in the circle.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “And my parents were murdered by a Parselmouth. Because of that, I had to spend ten years with Muggles that the whole wizarding world knows now were abusive, I had to kill a giant basilisk in our second year and a man possessed by Voldemort in our first, I had to put up with opinion swinging back and forth on me constantly and people thinking I was mad and evil and dangerous, my godfather was innocent and then I lost him, I was used as a
“Give me the damn snake,” he told Parkinson.
Potter closed his eyes, and a weariness as heavy as his will rose up in his face. “
the class, when he would come to retrieve James, but that didn’t matter much. Draco still had to speak to him.
Harry gasped and sat up with a sheet half-strangling him. He closed his eyes and massaged his forehead with one hand. His skin was cold and wet enough from sweat to make him feel as if he’d just climbed out of the bath, and he groped for his glasses, surprised that he
,” Harry snapped. “
A dark-robed wizard was walking towards them, hood up to conceal his, or her, face. One hand rose, and the wand pointed steadily at Potter. Draco’s blood swam cold, and he grope for his own wand, even though he wasn’t sure he could get through that shield.
“How did James react to the snake joining your household?” he asked.
Parkinson examined him, then looked around the large black ritual room in Malfoy’s cellars. (And
“Hello,” he said, and rested his hand on James’s shoulder as his son tried to hide behind him. He wasn’t used to so many strangers. “This is my son, James Sirius Potter.”
People who had gathered around to watch the scene gasped at her words, and a few people herded their children away. Harry closed his eyes as sharp misery hit him like a blade. Their eyes… “Please, Parkinson.”
Harry sighed. And here were some of the people who
“Malfoy—”
. You can’t use it on someone who isn’t attacking you.”
And in the meantime, Potter was there as the family and the foundation. Draco directed him to stand on the outside of the circle, behind his son, while Pansy, Greg, Scorpius, and Draco himself, with their snakes behind them, formed the four points inside. James sat in the middle, his eyes shining in a way that made Draco glad Potter had seen the necessity of securing teaching for him. He would be a powerful Parselmouth.
Malfoy definitely sounded wary now. Harry glanced at him and saw that his arm was still crooked at his side, but this time at an angle that looked more like he was about to draw his wand.
Harry sighed and got down on the floor. He hated speaking Parseltongue, especially since it had been one of the things that had cost James his mother. But on the other hand, maybe it was best that he take the lead so James wouldn’t get charmed by the thing and want to keep it as a pet. “
!” The blond wizard leaned back as Parkinson pointed at him, as if he believed that she would launch lightning out of her finger. Given the average wizard’s notions of defense, Harry supposed that he couldn’t really blame the git.
And he was doing it with
“No!”
Harry shrugged. “He’s been good with James. What he wants or wants with me doesn’t matter.”
The blond man who was staring at him looked vaguely familiar, but then, as Hermione would say, that was down to inbreeding in the British wizarding population. He shook his head and stepped backwards hastily, and then pointed one finger at Harry.
But he was just too tired.
as if it wasn’t something passed along from the Dark Mark.”
“I assure you that I’m not upset about losing her custom.” Draco let his voice shade cooler. “And if you intend to take James out of the school because of her, I must advise against it. He is thriving here.”
“Can you talk to it, James?” Harry was casting a few charms as he spoke, ones that would pick up on the ill intent of the snake if it had been conjured to bite his son. Nothing came back except the charm that clarified the snake
Parkinson gave him a sharp glance before she left, and Goyle might have done the same thing if he was capable of it. Harry stretched his arms and waited until Malfoy escorted James out of the circle. Scorpius immediately bounced up to James and started chattering away, comparing their snakes.
“I can’t
And the woman couldn’t cast anymore. She was staggering, most of her right arm gone, decayed and vanished. She sagged to her knees, her mouth open and her breath rasping up harshly from probably desiccated lungs. Potter walked slowly and deliberately towards her.
Harry sighed. He hated Parseltongue, but he wasn’t the one being asked to speak it. And he wanted to do what was best for James. He deserved to be trained even though Harry would never embrace his own Parseltongue.
Harry clenched his hands and said as calmly as he could, “I’m here now. You can let her go.”
Well, technically, Potter wouldn’t be there until
Harry sneered a little. “Need to rely on your snake to tell you that, Malfoy? When you went to the trouble of looking up all the details in the papers?”
Sela lifted her head from the side of his pillow. “
“I don’t have any teaching skills. And having me at your school would be more trouble than it was worth.”
“Is Daddy safe?”
Harry shook his head and lay back in the bed, staring at the ceiling. He’d had a Floo call from Ron and Hermione that morning, inviting him and James to dinner tomorrow—today, now. He’d go, and he’d talk to them, and he’d try to shed some of his burdens that he was carrying in regards to them.
The snake appeared extremely upset, but Harry dumped her out the window, then began casting temporary spells that would keep out any reptile from the house in general and James’s room specifically. There was no reason for any reptiles to cross the boundary on an ordinary day, so the spells wouldn’t keep out any creature that had a
Harry stared at the arm. He had no idea what to say. The last thing he would have expected was for Malfoy to make some kind of sacrifice for him, even if he clearly didn’t approve of Harry’s decision.
“Well enough.” She eyed him sharply, and then the basket that hovered behind him. “Did you know that you could conjure a sturdier basket that would be attached to you with a snake?”
Harry had to smile, while the snake, who evidently did understand English, said, “
Part of Harry burned with something more than love now.
James joined in with a pure note of song that made the circle quiver, and then a snake crawled into being over the edges of the physical circle on the floor, between one of its ripples and the next.
The snake arranged herself around the foot of one of the bedposts on James’s bed, and yawned soundlessly at him, revealing the delicate fangs that stood out in the front of her mouth. She seemed to have no other teeth. “
? Of course not.”
it to him. It’ll be better for him not to have me around when I can’t get over my horror. And don’t tell me that you’re over the nightmares, either, Harry! I hear you hissing and twisting in your bed at night!”
That sounded like a threat, but Harry forced himself not to take it that way. He simply lay there, and eventually, Sela went back to sleep, and let Harry wander in his head, in silence, turning pieces of the past over and over in his head like wheels.
“That doesn’t mean I get to have some kind of personal claim on you.” Potter turned back to watch the children again, ignoring what seems to be the rhythmic clenching and tightening of Sela on his arm. “I’ve already confessed enough that’s personal to you. I—have inappropriate emotional reactions in your presence. I’m sorry.”
Potter turned to face him, hostile magic rising up around him like steam. He ignored Edwina’s hissed warning and the way both children shrank away from him. “There was a snake who wanted to Match with me, or some other absurd name,” he said, voice clipped. “She came into the house without permission and into my son’s bedroom, specifically. I put her outside. I didn’t hurt her, and I didn’t bond with her. She’s not

hoped to shield James from some of it.
Harry dragged his hand across his face and decided to put it in terms that Parkinson could understand, since obviously speaking about the harm to innocents wouldn’t move her. “Has it occurred to you that I still have to do my
“He’s going to have
He’d only ever used that term in his own head, and to bloody Bandler. “My magic out and playing around me. There was—lightning. Thunder. Serpents made of black light crawling next to me. It scared everyone out of their wits. Of course, after that they were perfectly willing to believe Bandler when he decreed that I was evil.”
“I ensured that whenever you go around spreading ugly rumors and lies you don’t even believe in yourself, that you’ll be subject to a phantom snakebite,” Parkinson said, and laughed at the expression on the man’s face. Harry wished he could. The coldness surging through him prevented it. “Don’t worry, it won’t poison you. It’ll simply hurt, until you retract the lie.”
Harry just shrugged and glanced down at the snake. “
,” Harry said, and didn’t say anything more as he raked his trembling fingers through his hair. It was soaked with sweat, and Harry shook his head. Why did the cupboard scare him more when he was an adult than it ever had as a child? Then, it was just something to be endured. Now he dreamed again and again that he was locked in it forever, unable to open the door, unable to make someone hear him, unable even to die.
“Harry
“But you’re a Parselmouth.”
.” He did something that felt like he was pushing a small wave of magic at Harry.
“I believe you,” Potter said in English. His posture had gone tense, and Draco’s own muscles ached at how tight Potter’s appeared. “I just don’t need to take up more of your time or attention than I have. I have friends I’ve neglected and who invited me and James over for dinner tonight. I’ll talk to them.”
a good one.
“You’re doing ritual magic.”
But thinking about it just made him feel pathetic, so he turned back to Malfoy in time to see him nod. “Some people who didn’t admit before this that their children could be Parselmouths are contacting me now.”
Harry tensed despite himself, and noticed Hermione noticing it. He exhaled hard and looked in the other direction. “I appreciate his concern, but
Draco didn’t know the dark red spell that soared away from Potter’s wand and crashed into the other wizard, but he didn’t know that he had to. The intent behind the spell was perfectly clear. The flesh on the other wizard’s wand hand
” He was considering Harry, his eyes traveling up and down. “
“What happened, Jamie?”
“I want you to know that I’m a
Another thing that was different between them, and the only one that Harry envied. He went back to his room and sipped carefully at Dreamless Sleep. He was always careful with it, given how addictive it was.
Malfoy’s outstretched hand couldn’t be slapped away. He wasn’t doing this for James, or because Harry was his old friend, or because they were in-laws. In fact, Harry was pretty sure that Malfoy would argue it would be the best thing for James if Sela stayed with Harry and their family. He was doing it because he wanted to help
It wasn’t often that Draco felt he had no idea what someone was talking about, but he felt like that now. “Enough of my time,” he repeated blankly. Edwina raised her head and turned from where she had been watching the children to study Potter, her tail flicking so that it tapped the back of Draco’s wrist.
always put everything relating to Potter on the front page, so Draco had only to glance and move on if a particular edition didn’t have anything.
They bounced from a shield that Draco hadn’t even realized Potter had wrapped around himself. Potter broke it a second later with a twist of purple and blue magic that sent Moonborn sprawling on the cobblestones. At least it seemed as if the rotting spell wasn’t going to consume more of her, Draco thought, queasy. Her right arm was mostly bone, but it hadn’t spread anywhere else.
” The snake lifted her head, her tongue darting out as she scented. “
“Potter.”
“Sure,” Harry said, feeling as though someone had fed him a Calming Draught. No one except Ron and Hermione had taken his refusal to talk about something this well in years. “I’ll donate as much money as you like.”
Harry sighed. “Is there a point to this interrogation? I should get James home.”
Draco gaped before he could stop himself. Then he studied him. “This is an extreme change of heart.”
Harry nodded and smiled and waved a hand at James. Speaking in English would disrupt the ritual—Malfoy had made that clear before they started—and fuck everything if he was going to speak in Parseltongue.
“I’m talking about the effect it will have on
Potter trailed off, but Draco thought he knew what words would follow that. “Nice?” He spread his hands. “Hogwarts was a long time ago, Potter. And you’re the father of a child in my care, and you’re a fellow Parselmouth, and you’re suffering.”
Harry turned and began to walk away, but Malfoy called after him, “Haven’t you considered that your experiences with Parseltongue aren’t any more traumatic than mine are? I was Marked by
“No.”
Harry listened calmly to a long description of the game. James was still only four. And then Jamie hesitated, and Harry was sure they were getting to the real problem. He rubbed his hand up and down James’s back again.
you?”
“Well, you’re in the wrong part of the Archives for that, first of all, Mr. Malfoy! Come with me, and we’ll make sure that you’re set on the right path.”
“I—didn’t know if you wanted to know that Ginny is getting married again. But it’ll be in the papers, so…”
articles covering the time of your—dispute with Healer Bandler.”
Harry resisted the temptation to bang his head into a different bedpost than the one the snake was coiled around, because it wouldn’t help. “
No, probably not. But Harry was cowardly enough that he didn’t want to repeat it. It was going to be hard enough to explain it to James when he was old enough to understand it.
“I do believe that Potter is a Dark Lord rising!”
Harry just grunted and didn’t say anything else to Sapphire, instead conjuring the floating bag, then conjuring water to fill it. Sapphire coiled his body before Harry could offer to Levitate him and floated from the tank to the bag under what had to be the push of his own magic. Harry blinked a little, then shook his head as he settled James with a charm so he’d be less likely to roll over on Sapphire no matter how much he tossed.
“You can look up the spell in the special books kept in the Auror Academy,” Harry muttered, tilting his head slightly so that he could look Auror Brooks in the eye. The man flinched. Many people did when Harry looked at them. Harry had once thought it was because they believed he was a Legilimens—a persistent rumor that had spread after the war to explain his battle-forged instincts—but now he just thought they were afraid. “It’s not classified as Dark Arts because it’s specifically
Yes, Harry knew he had trauma. But when everyone would side with the Healer if one betrayed him again, and people still flinched away from him in the streets when he went to the shops in Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade, Harry didn’t see what he could do about it.
Harry had to turn his head and stare in the other direction, at one of the small courtyards with food stalls where he went to buy vegetables. He shuddered and shook his head and finally murmured, “Well. Anyway. I need to be getting on.”
“This doesn’t have to take too long.” Potter stared at him, and seemingly through him. He really did have amazing eyes, Draco thought. It was equally amazing that no one had snapped him up since Weasley had divorced him, dark rumors swirling around him or not. “James told me that a woman came here yesterday to talk about enrolling her daughter in the school.”
,” James responded at once, and he focused on Charlie as Scorpius held him out. “
” Harry stroked down James’s spine again while he tried to think about how to explain something that often made no sense even to him. “
“I-if you c-curse me, th-then you’ll be in trouble—”
And wasn’t that what really mattered? Being a good father for James? He would be a better one if he wasn’t in pain all the time.
Harry snorted softly. “Or the reporters might ask them questions and twist their words. I have more experience of the press than you do.”
,” the cobra said.
“She came searching for me because she could trace that you’d recently been in magical contact with me,” Parkinson said calmly, her hand still extended. “Not one snake in a hundred could do that, Potter. She belongs with you, and you with her.”
a coward! Any Gryffindor, anyone who respected him, would have struck from the
Harry bit back the stream of curses he wanted to unleash. Losing his temper was the cause of most of his past woes, at least the ones that Voldemort wasn’t directly responsible for. He’d lost his marriage with Ginny because of it, and he wouldn’t have driven Bandler to reveal all those facts about his past if Harry hadn’t screamed at the man for calling him a Dark wizard.
James hissed softly to Sapphire, and received a response that was conveyed more in the coiling of his body than Parseltongue, because Harry couldn’t hear anything, but James nodded proudly.
“She’s fine. It’s fine.” His eyes were on James and Scorpius, who were playing with the little Flint girl Julia in the middle of a pentagram on the floor of the classroom. The pentagram was only chalk, but Potter was watching it as if he expected it to explode. “Should they be in a shape like that so young?”
It wasn’t his own future, though. Harry had accepted that. It was too late for him to become an accomplished Parselmouth, just the way it was too late for him to escape the taint of his past and Voldemort’s touch.
“I wanted to introduce you to my snake, Sela,” Harry said, extending his arm, and at least Sela cooperated this time and lifted her head, slithering into view. There were a few gasps, one scream, but Harry didn’t allow them to take hold, rolling with his own momentum instead. “And to tell you the story of how I started to think better of my Parseltongue, and why the school appealed to me for my son…”
“I see.”

“You know that ritual magic is how

, Harry.”
“April 2005. May 2005.”
Harry felt the wariness trying to stiffen all his muscles, but he only nodded and turned to James. “Why don’t you and Sapphire play with Scorpius and Charlie for a little while?” he suggested.
Parkinson and Goyle didn’t answer. They were too busy staring at the circle on the floor, which Harry hadn’t noticed so far because it was so perfectly black and blended in with the stone of the floor. James gasped as the black snake stretched itself, a long ripple that ran up its body and down without making the serpent let go of the tail it was holding with its mouth, and said, “

?” Parkinson asked. She didn’t wait for an answer before she turned back to Malfoy. “I don’t know if I can be in a calling circle with him. His stupidity might taint my magic.”
“There are things a Parselmouth can do other than ritual magic,” Parkinson said quietly. “But I would have thought that you’d want to defend the reputation of the people that your son is growing up among, if not your own.”
“Are you going to arrest me?”
Auror Brooks’s eyes widened, as if he hadn’t expected Harry to admit that. Then he gave a braying laugh. “So when we charge you for not following the Auror Code of Conduct—”
Watching the way James’s shoulders tensed, Harry thought that perhaps he should have left this longer. But even though he’d seen the change in Jamie’s demeanor at once, he hadn’t intervened for a full day. He’d thought that James had just had some argument with the other kids at the school and would work through it.
Sela twisted her neck to the side so that they could make eye contact. Her eyes were a startling green, even after he’d been around her long enough that Harry would have thought he’d get used to it. “
Parkinson caught her breath beside him. Harry knew it was the prelude to laughter, but he just fixed his eyes on the ground and shrugged, then turned and brushed past Parkinson as he aimed at the next shop. He was a good judge of these encounters by now, and he knew the man was a talker, but wouldn’t try to follow or hex him.
And sure enough, there it was, beginning the third week of April. A picture of Potter flinching and trying to duck out of sight in an obscure corner of Diagon Alley, while the headline blared,
Draco, who knew very well what Mind-Healers were paid, snorted to himself.
?” he quietly asked in Parseltongue, smoothing James’s hair back.
“It’s free publicity for your school, Malfoy. And me admitting that James is a Parselmouth. You’re going to turn it down?”
Harry stared at her. “
Astoria put her hands on her hips. “You’ll have to do some of the same rituals he did, in order to achieve any level of power in using snake language when you weren’t born with it.”
I am here, my fated return! Sorry for the long break, I was in a deeper rut than I realised. But now, I'm back to writing this fic, and hoping everyone enjoys it! But I will give a warning, updates may be infrequent. Though I will do my best to have a net chapter out at least once every two weeks. So, happy reading!
The steady rise and fall of the werewolf's chest told Harry the Lupin had fallen asleep. He snored quietly as His head rolled back, resting against the back of the couch.
"Don't let it happen again, boy." He said in a low, threatening voice.
She warned him, she wanted to keep him safe. Something within her said they belonged together.
Vernon felt himself being pushed backward through the plastic sheets, his skin sliding along the concrete floor of the remaining room. His head and back collided roughly with the far wall, he watched Harry limp through the sheeting. The light behind him cast Harry into a menacing silhouette.
