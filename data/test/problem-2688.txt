“It’s cold tonight,” says the one with blonde hair everywhere. “Where are your little boots?”
“Er, no,” Harry admits.
Dragon Spirit on the Knight Bus and a drunken ode to Draco Malfoy. Harry closes his eyes. He attempts to ignore the shame rushing through him as it seems to be increasing the feeling of nausea with every second. He had been so certain last night, so sure that the mysterious bus driver had been Malfoy, but in the rather painful light of day, the doubts are already beginning to creep in.
After a cup of tea and a couple of cleaning spells, Harry is feeling restored, if slightly weak. He leans back in his chair and watches the biddies working on their window boxes, handing out reassuring smiles each time one of them looks over at him.
“They were the reporters from the Prophet?” Draco asks, horrified.
“You haven’t said anything yet,” Draco says darkly, wrenching at a lever and wincing in pain when the bus grinds its gears and shudders.
In truth, he is feeling both shivery and overheated, but the idea of Draco looming over him and touching his forehead is more than his heart and nervous system can currently cope with.
“No, not really,” Harry sighs. “If Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are going out together, the world may be about to end. This is not intended to be mean-spirited but merely refers to a prediction I made in nineteen eighty-six, which I will forward to you via owl post... why does everyone think the world is about to end?”
Puzzled but hopeful, she turns to see Sam, who is fixing her with a lovely crooked smile, and Mary Ann, now free of all traces of anxiety.
“Let’s just go,” Harry says, and, with a deep, steadying breath, he follows Draco back into the restaurant.
“And were you?” Draco asks.
The woman makes an odd gurgling sound and takes a step towards Rose, who shuffles closer to Harry.
“I did,” Harry agrees, fishing out the paper-wrapped millefeuille and setting it on the dashboard with a secret little flicker in the pit of his stomach.
“You saw me that first night,” Draco says quietly. “I think you’ll always be able to see me.”
Feeling ashamed, he lets out a long breath. “Not just me. You’re getting the worst of this and you know it.”
“Thanks, but I think—”
George reaches over and shakes Louis’ hand. “Saucisson,” he says, sketching out a rather obscene shape in the air. “Sacre bleu.”
“Okay?” Harry says, and Draco nods.
“Borrowed, Potter.”
Harry laughs. “Thanks for the career advice.”
As she speaks, the bus splutters loudly, engine protesting so violently that the whole bottom deck seems to shiver. After a moment, it settles back down into its usual vibrating hum.
“She’s not mine. She belongs to Bill, the guy who owns the shop. Still, I could probably borrow her for special occasions.”
Draco snorts. “Of course, because you’re an expert on me, aren’t you?”
To Draco’s quiet astonishment, Potter seems to be getting used to him. He still tries to eject him from the shop at semi-regular intervals, but when the magic words ‘I’m browsing’ are uttered, he merely shrugs and returns to his work. Every now and then, Draco is granted a smile that is reluctant but genuine, and he is left with the growing impression that despite his better judgement, Potter is beginning to enjoy his company.
**~*~**
“Jelly babies,” he repeats gloomily. “How very macabre.”
“He was pretty heavy when I put him in that box,” Harry muses. “And when he went to sleep on my legs.”
Draco stares at him for several long seconds. One of the children drops their cup and covers the tiles in a splatter of juice and ceramic shards. Luna cleans up the mess with her wand and quietly supplies a new cup of juice without Harry or Draco seeming to notice her.
“Can’t make sense?” Draco says, offering a little half smile that makes Harry’s stomach tighten.
“It’s that… this is
“I suppose it is,” she says at last. “Are you all here for me?”
Feeling contented, Draco hangs his coat up on a rack of luminous cat collars and makes himself at home.
**~*~**
“It’s pronounced ‘Rafe’,” Ron and Harry say as one and then grin at each other, before Harry hurries to sober his expression. “Yes, well, I was very upset about it.”
She turns to him, eyes large and dark. “I doubt it, it was the middle of the day... most people around here were at work. There’s only Mr Fortuna next door and he hardly ever comes outside. He’s an odd man... eccentric... I don’t think he even knows who we are.” She pauses, directing a tight, self-deprecating smile at the table. “It’s the opposite of a problem, really... he only comes out when he...”
Frowning, Harry scrambles back out onto the grass just in time to see the black and white shape lolloping down the hill. There is something about her gait that makes him think she is enjoying herself.
“Angelina’s a Quidditch player and she’s not like that,” Ron says, shrugging.
“Alright,” Draco says with a small smile that makes Harry feel inexplicably out of sorts.
“I haven’t,” Harry whispers, scandalised.
He and Pansy have already seen the violently orange thing from the Eye in the Sky but close up, it really is a thing to behold. The colour is almost enough to induce a headache, and it clashes forcefully with Potter’s purple hair. The hem falls just above the knee, revealing wiry calves, bruised knees, and a sprinkling of dark hairs that had not been visible from the tenth floor window. Now that Draco looks more closely, he sees that the orange fabric contains a pattern of small flowers, and that the sleeves cling almost obscenely to Potter’s upper arms. For a moment, he wonders just where Potter might have obtained such a garment, but then he decides not to think about it.
Ivy fiddles with her damp hair. “Do you want me to take him for a bit? You know, so you can have some… time? ‘Cause… I think it’s really nice that you found each other. I just wanted to say that.”
“Yep,” Harry agrees, as they let themselves into the pub. He stands there for a moment, breathing in the warm, beery air and allowing his eyes to adjust to the sudden dimness. “Which no one would do. Unless they were drunk.”
“Oddly enough, Ron, those things rely on two very different skill sets,” Harry says, emerging from behind his fingers and reaching for his wine glass.
There are no explosions, no smoke, just a soft thud, and then the door is swinging open on its hinges.
“They do not,” Harry laughs. “I’ve been here five minutes and you’ve been… how long have you been doing this, exactly?”
“Rose isn’t being a giraffe any more,” he tells Draco, leaning in close and inhaling the clean scent of his cold skin. “She’s the head bird, whatever that means. Apparently it’s a very important role.”
“I’ll see you all soon,” he says, and all he can do is promise and hope.
“I don’t think swans are. Needle is. He’s an individual, aren’t you?” Draco murmurs, gazing down at the swan in a way that Ron would definitely describe as ‘clucky’.
Harry doesn’t even have to tell her to stay on the pavement and watch where she’s going. She’s got it, and he’s proud enough to burst. Smiling to himself, he walks beside Draco, carrying the spider lunchbox and a feeling of peace that has been missing for some time.
“What colour?” Draco asks, frowning.
“Our beetle,” Harry says, taking Draco’s hand and gently leading him back to the bedroom.
“We’re here,” Harry says, rather relieved he managed to make the jump accurately under the circumstances.
Draco doesn’t look away from the road but the surprise is clear in his eyes and his fingers tighten almost imperceptibly around the wheel. He is silent for so long that Harry is ready to give up, and then he nods.
“He’s not,” Draco agrees.
“Thank you,” he says, taking the crackleball and slipping it into his pocket.
“Mr Borteg said you were looking for a new whisky yesterday,” Harry says, because the whole swan situation seems suddenly insane and he doesn’t know what else to say.
“Hermione, it’s freezing out here,” he complains, immediately starting to shiver, but she just indicates for him to keep walking.
“I can’t imagine why else I would be here,” Draco says, reaching for his most disdainful expression.
Harry shifts in his seat, suddenly feeling warm and flickery inside.
“Good thinking,” Harry says, relieved to know that the old lady has outwitted the thief. “Still, it’s horrible that you had a break-in. I’d be furious if someone did this at Borteg’s, even if they didn’t take anything.”
“Harry? Are you there? It’s Luna.”
There is still no sign of Pansy, but that’s no real cause for concern. She’s certainly been more than half an hour late before, and the management at the Wizarding Wireless Network either haven’t noticed or just don’t care. Their breakfast show is the most popular thing on the airwaves, and no one seems keen to mess around with a winning formula, a fact for which Draco is grateful, because despite the fact that his younger self would have keeled over laughing at the idea of being a radio presenter, thirty-year-old Draco finds the whole thing rather satisfying.
“Oh, just a foot or so. Someone in the pub said he was just short of some kind of world record, so I thought I’d help.” Draco beams. “Now he’s special.”
All at once, Harry can’t look at her. He stares down at his hands and wishes he could disappear into the oriental rug beneath his feet, just sink into the patterns and become invisible.
falls out. Puzzled, Harry bends over and picks it up, and several more drop to the floor, followed by a cascade of others. By the time the compartment seems to be empty, Harry is ankle deep in newspapers and Draco is standing at the doors, coated in grime and glitter and wearing an expression of utter horror.
“Draco, you do know that all of this is mad, don’t you?”
He’s supposed to be keeping a distance here, and sharing funny stories about his family is probably not the best idea. The trouble is, Draco doesn’t exactly make it easy for him. If he could be cold and hard like he used to be, none of this would be a problem. But he’s not. He’s all…
“Tomorrow,” he says, and crawls back into bed.
Today, she hums to herself as she lines up jelly babies on the desk, arranging and rearranging them in an order only she understands. Harry hangs up his coat and stands behind the counter, hoping he might be offered one once the ritual is over. There’s something about the chunky little buggers with their starchy coating that reminds him of being seven years old and Mr Branning, who used to offer those very same treats as a reward for quiet, obedient behaviour, something at which Harry was rather practised.
Hugo reaches out a starfish hand and makes a grab for Harry’s glasses.
“That’s the problem, Dad… we haven’t got any musical instruments,” Luna says gently. “That’s why we’re doing this.”
“That’s where I think it was fixed,” Draco says. “Anyone can break a window but not everyone can repair one properly.”
The swan, meanwhile, takes full advantage of his moment of inattention and delivers a savage bite to his knee, leaving him swearing under his breath and feeling more stubborn than ever.
Mr Fortuna touches his wand to his temple, and with a grunt, extracts a silvery strand of memory. He traps it in the vial and passes it to Harry.
“What in the name of all that is holy have you done, you… you devil beetle?” Draco demands, and this time, Harry can’t quite stop himself from laughing out loud. Draco’s eyes snap to him. “Have you been here this whole time?”
“It’s their day,” he reminds himself. “I can wait. I
Draco lets out a small, uncontrolled sound that rips down Harry’s spine, dropping his mouth to Harry’s neck and then turning stiff, still, unresponsive. With aching gentleness he holds Harry at arm’s length and just stares at him, breathing hard.
By the time he disappears out of view, the morning dew has climbed all the way up his trousers to his knees, and the sight of it makes Harry smile.
Draco gives him a look that could freeze lava and then sighs. “Because I have a splitting headache and the bus is testing my fucking patience,” he mutters.
Harry wakes to find the cabin oddly silent. At first, he thinks the lack of sound is merely due to the fact that Draco appears to have wandered off somewhere, but when he looks out of the window and sees the sun, he realises that water is no longer pouring through the hole in the roof and into the bucket.
“Sam’s shorter than
“Of course,” Luna says, and Caroline nods, apparently satisfied.
“Merry Christmas, Mrs Malfoy,” he says, set off balance by her soft floral perfume and the new flicker of kindness in her eyes.
Harry stops reading. He looks at the emblem at the top of the page and sighs.
“Ruined, my foot,” scoffs the old lady from Eeylops Owl Emporium, pausing outside the quill shop to cast a stiff warming charm on her waxed jacket. “Don’t you know how to darn?”
Because he’s incapable of entertaining himself? No. Of course he fucking isn’t. With some effort, he pushes dreams and snow and Malfoy and all the rest of it out of his mind, and stomps off to find something to do.
Harry stirs, yawns, and frowns without opening his eyes. The soft thing currently supporting his weight definitely isn’t his mattress, and the moment he tries to stretch his legs it becomes apparent that wherever he is, he’s definitely not alone. Reluctant to open his eyes, he runs his fingers along the soft thing over which he is draped and pinned, and the familiar bobbly fabric provokes a rush of relief.
“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”
“Did you just say—?”
He looks up then, heart pounding as he takes in the loaded silence and the unwavering stares.
“Perhaps they won’t be lonely after all,” she says, and Ginny isn’t listening, but that’s alright. She was mostly talking to herself anyway.
“I understand that,” Draco says, “and I will do everything else on this list, but I will not do that.”
“I like your dress,” Luna’s father says, eating his toast in a spiral pattern from the outside in. “Are you going to wear that for work?”
“Who’s that?” Harry asks.
Harry draws his wand and vanishes the lot of them before the stench permeates the entire cabin. Then, intrigued, he leans into the wardrobe and examines the contents: several old, scratchy jumpers that must have once belonged to a rather large man, and a tweed skirt and jacket that are small enough to fit Gertie herself.
“And Sunday,” adds Sam from behind his desk.
“Yeah, he is a bit,” Harry says, but his eyes drift to the curtain and he wonders. “Does he always shut himself off like that?”
“He’s probably fine,” Harry says, uncertainty at odds with the heat in his eyes and the way that he is still gripping Draco’s thigh. “Isn’t he?”
“Audrey makes good jams,” Ida says. “She wins prizes in the village fete. Where is Audrey, anyway?”
“What’s Molly Weasley got to do with anything?” Thora demands, cross expression rather undermined by the blob of frosting on the end of her nose.
“Bad cat,” Eilish mumbles, but the others shush her immediately.
“You won’t live long if you worry too much,” Corrie tells him. “We stopped bothering, that’s why we’re still here.”
“What’s that?” Harry asks.
was at my house,” he says with some effort, “I used to go somewhere else in my head. It actually looked a lot like this.”
She sips her coffee and smiles to herself, thinking of Hermione’s flushed delight when she’d finally had her article published in the
“I don’t know,” Harry says, reaching for Draco’s abandoned notes.
“He’s probably tired,” Harry says, with half a mind to pick him up and guess his weight.
She wrinkles her nose but obediently takes a single sprout from the platter before beginning to pile stuffing and roast potatoes onto her plate.
Danica whips a spell at the closed curtain and fixes him with a motherly eye. “Just a bit of a silencer. He doesn’t need to know that we’re talking about him.”
“We’re making a new crackleball for Christmas,” she tells Harry, apparently in no hurry to return to work.
Draco grins. “You can see them next year.”
“Scandalous,” Draco murmurs, and then falls silent as they remove their skates and lace up their shoes.
Harry stops dead at the sound of the familiar, stern voice, and Draco walks straight into the back of him.
“Where are we?”
“Yes,” Harry promises, closing his eyes and carefully sipping his tea.
When it arrives, he always gives back as good as he gets, even though he couldn’t care less about what Pansy thinks of his clothes. She knows that he works for his money these days and cannot really afford to keep everything up-to-the-minute like he had as a teenager, but what she doesn’t understand is why he doesn’t just write to his parents in France or Dubai or wherever they are this week and ask them to move a few thousand Galleons into his bank account. She probably never will, and that suits Draco just fine. His relationship with Pansy has never been based on similarity, and that can only be a good thing. The idea of having to spend several hours a day cooped up in a tiny studio with someone just like himself gives him the absolute horrors.
“I’ve never seen Needle fly. He just sort of… trundles.”
“This is the right thing to do,” Harry says, and he isn’t sure if it’s a question or not.
“Mrs next door is mad, Ida,” Draco says patiently.
“Of course not,” Shan says with a small smile. “Anyway, we’ve all been told to keep away. That woman from MLE is down there and she doesn’t want us contaminating her scene.”
He holds his hand out and Harry shakes it, surprised to feel his skin heat with embarrassment. He takes a deep breath and allows the mingled aromas of tea and lavender and watercolour paints to surround him, feeling the deep rumble of the bus engine through the soles of his feet as Draco pulls them back into traffic, and deciding that overthinking this thing will only make it worse. For now, he’s just going to see where it leads him.
“I’ve got eyes!” Corrie cries.
Harry doesn’t mind. The shop is quiet, Mr Borteg is working away in his back room, and he has all the time in the world to hear about Shan and Esmee’s latest endeavour.
“What makes you think that was the first time?” he asks for no good reason that he can see.
“What are they, then? I know you’re dying to tell me.”
“I want you,” Draco says, releasing his cock and skating both hands up his back.
“No, you need to extend the table this way,” Hermione calls, just as a loud creak-scrape echoes around the bus. “Otherwise, Danica’s going to be squashed in that corner.”
“This is for the bus as well as you, I suppose,” Harry says, chewing anxiously on his lip as Draco unwraps his gift. “It’s a bit scratched. I tried all sorts of removal charms but it wouldn’t go. I got it from this dodgy-looking bloke on a market stall…” He pauses, scrubbing at his hair, but Draco is staring at the object with wide eyes. “Yeah, okay, I’m, not really selling it, am I? It’s just… when I saw it, I couldn’t resist.”
The man sighs. “Mr Malfoy, I’ve really got to do the stock check…”
Draco’s bland expression flickers for the briefest of moments, but it’s enough, and Harry has to turn away to suppress a snort of laughter.
“No, I’m just…” Harry flushes, cursing his decision to wear something slightly smarter than his usual jeans and jumper to today’s on-board tea party. “I’m going… shopping for… erm… shoes,” he improvises, looking at his sturdy but serviceable brown boots.
Mr Borteg regards him curiously. “That floor has been there for two hundred years. I wondered why you were attempting to scrub away the pattern.”
“I wasn’t staring,” Harry mutters, feeling his face heat. “And anyway, I wanted to sit here with you for a bit.”
Mr Borteg blinks slowly, then breaks into the most malevolent cackle Harry has ever heard.
Harry steps out into Diagon Alley just as the shops are beginning to open and his smile widens as he looks around at the gleaming windows and immaculate shopfronts. Everything looks perfect and a light fall of snow overnight has left the street looking like a Christmas card. Shan and Esmee are in high spirits when he goes to check on them, both rushing to hug him and push freshly-made chocolate treats into his hands.
“I thought it was just the little nips,” he whispers, taking an alarmed step towards Luna.
“That’s very true,” she agrees, turning to call a goodbye to her father before she Disapparates.
“You should write a book.”
“You have firecalls to make,” Draco says, and Harry just stares at him, tangled with longing and sharp, prickly anxiety.
“It was winter time and the lake had frozen over,” she reads. “The swans were sliding on the ice and having a nice time. But one swan was lonely. He wasn’t the same as the others. On a cold, black night, he saw a sparkly star and he made a Christmas wish.”
“Draco?” Shan yells, and they share a resigned look.
“I know. I thought it might be bracing… you know, for the mind.”
“And who are you, exactly?” she demands, looking as though she’s about to explode.
Harry glances at Draco and then over his shoulder at Lavender, who is marching towards him at speed. He really fucking misses Ron and Hermione.
“Clucky,” Ron supplies. “You get all clucky and all your other friends have children so it all gets dumped on Harry.”
“Shall we make the table bigger?” Eilish wonders, drawing her wand. “Then there’s space for everyone to sit down.”
“Er, no. I actually… you seem to have collected a few more presents for your tree since…”
“Well, you can crunch it or you can suck it,” Harry says. “Either way, it’s going to taste brilliant… fuck, is that the right time?”
“Okay,” he says, heaving a dramatic sigh. “So, number thirty took me to the circus.”
The man in question merely nods to her and settles his violin on his shoulder. He calls a count to his band and seconds later, the air is full of rousing music that makes Luna want to spin in circles, like Draco and Eliza on an imaginary mountain top.
“Why do you think Harry doesn’t have a girlfriend?” Serafina asks, swapping to stand on the other leg. “Don’t you think he’s good looking?”
Draco laughs. “Probably. I think she prefers watching them without me,” he says, gazing around the room with idle interest. “I ask too many questions.”
“Is this going to be on the new menu?” someone else asks, to titters from their friends.
“That’s right,” Harry says casually. “It’s amazing I didn’t lose the whole hand.”
“Yes. It’s a type of water bird. Webbed feet. Makes a sort of ‘quacking’ sound.”
“You missed all the excitement yesterday,” Danica says. “We picked up a whole family of passengers.”
“And how did he get from the pub into Diagon Alley?” Harry asks.
She collapses into a chair and rubs at her face. “He only started last night but I feel like it’s been a week,” she says. “None of the Muggle medications do anything, and I can’t get him to take Pepper-up at all. I don’t think he likes the taste… he just spits it back out.”
Harry thinks that everything inside him aches, and that when he looks at Draco’s hopeful expression as he looks down at a little girl with a spider in a jar, he feels full and complete and as though everything Esmee said to him is right here, wrapping around him and stealing his breath.
Harry says nothing, just presses his face to Draco’s neck and inhales the warm, Sunday afternoon scents of tea and lemons and lots and lots of ink. Never one to be excluded, Stanley clambers up and insinuates himself between them with a lot of contented tacking.
“I’m very happy for me, too,” she says, and kisses his cheek. “Now, go and get that young man. Don’t waste another moment.”
“Do you ever wonder what all of this says about us?” Draco asks, leaning over from the next table.
The next day, Harry is still nowhere to be seen, and Draco’s behaviour remains... unusual. He still seems tired and anxious, but more than that, his glimmer is fierce and bright, flowing around him in a way that is completely at odds with his expression. Luna is puzzled, even more so when she realises that he hasn’t mentioned Harry even once since they seemed so close at the weekend.
“Thank you, Nurse, we must be off,” he manages, placing a hand on Draco’s back and steering him into the mass of people heading for the stairs.
“The very same.”
Draco brushes invisible specks from his coat. “Don’t get me wrong, I’ve tried some wonderful things from your shop recently but I thought perhaps I should have a signature whisky.”
“No swans tonight,” he mumbles to himself.
“So?”
“Which one is Tahira?” Ron asks in a loud whisper.
“Is Reuben alright?” he asks. “Are they all alright? Should we go down there and help?”
William’s eyes turn shrewd. “Youse’re worried that you’re taking advantage? Has she no got ye doing wee jobs for her?”
“Only when we’re being a nuisance,” Danica says cheerfully. “I think our little game of snap was a bit too much for him today.”
**~*~**
“Good. Ask Mr Borteg, too,” Molly says briskly. “He always looks as though he needs a good meal.”
,” Eliza tells Caroline, apparently deciding to ignore Otis.
Gertie’s words swim around in Harry’s head for the rest of the afternoon, and when they return to the Old Trout that evening with their empty basket, he finds himself looking around for the ‘gays’ from the Post Office. It hadn’t occurred to him at the time to think of them as a couple, but when he spots them now, he has no idea how he could have missed it. The two men are sharing a table next to the window, stealing food from one another’s plates and chatting animatedly, despite having probably spent the entire day together already. They look at each other as though there is no one else in the room, and Harry can’t help smiling. He wonders if he looks at Draco like that.
Harry grants him a grim smile. “A friend.”
“You’re the one that fell down,” Harry points out.
Harry meets his eyes, scanning them for the false pride that so often used to reside there, but he finds nothing but sincerity and a hint of steeliness that makes his heart hurt. He shifts closer and laces his fingers through Draco’s.
Draco sighs. For a moment, Harry thinks he is going to turn and walk back to the cabin, but then he sits down on the rock and pulls off his boots and socks. Harry grins in triumph, jumping slightly as something—perhaps an eel—swims past his knees.
“Ginny is full of bright ideas,” Luna says.
Harry shakes his head, words swept away as his sideways mind takes him back to the Burrow’s kitchen and the baffled face of Ginny’s French boyfriend. Something had nagged him about the image at the time, and now it’s so horribly obvious that he wants to slap himself.
“And why not them?” Hermione asks.
“He’s late,” Charlie says, seeming to relish the prospect.
When she leaves to fetch their food, her grandson hobbles over and shakes each of their hands in turn.
“Don’t feel too sorry for her, she has a very fancy dinner waiting for her on Christmas Day,” Draco says, and Harry can feel his eyes, too, all over him as he licks cream from his fingers and flushes.
“I don’t know… they all use the same fucking sacks?” Harry sighs, wishing for just an ounce of the bravery it would take to walk across that floor and kiss Draco senseless.
Harry adds the relevant dots and names to the parchment. “Aren’t they?”
“Yeah, okay, but… I thought she didn’t like me.”
“He looks a bit pale,” Danica puts in.
Harry sets down the note and stares at Draco, relieved to find the astonishment he feels written all over the pale features.
Harry smiles but Jean shakes her head. “That’s a nasty thought, love. And… why?”
firewhisky and pushes it into Shan’s hands.
Harry laughs, all at once feeling light. “I don’t know. I’ll see you on Saturday.”
“Right,” Harry says, taking a moment to unravel all of this. “And why are you telling me now?”
“What on earth are you wearing?” he asks after a moment.
“Would she have gone out on her own?” he asks, and the ladies shake their heads.
“Oh, really?” Hermione says, eyebrows raised. “Is that why we had Avi in our spare bedroom for four weeks? Eating his pickles everywhere and trying to give me cleaning tips?”
“No,” Hermione says faintly. “It would not. I’ve changed my mind, Harry. You should stay single for as long as you like. Marriage is not for everyone.”
“If you’re sure,” Ron says, and there’s something about his expression that Harry doesn’t like one bit.
“That’s him, isn’t it?” Harry whispers, nudging Draco.
“We made an enormous fuss,” Corrie says proudly.
Hermione, Ron and Harry regard Draco expectantly and he sighs.
With that, she stumps off over the cobbles and back to her shop. Rose, Harry and Florean exchange amused glances but Mr Jennings merely sighs.
“Yeah,” he sighs. “I know I don’t make sense, but I’d really like to be your friend again. If you’ll have me.”
Instinctively, Harry touches his face with his fingertips, bewildered to see them come away with a light dusting of silver glitter. And then it hits him.
Draco stops scrubbing at his hair and gazes at him. “What?”
Draco lets out a brief sigh and drops his arms to his sides. “How am I supposed to argue with you when you don’t make any sense?”
“I don’t know how you aren’t as big as a house,” Ginny says. “Nothing ever upsets your appetite.”
“Yeah, brilliant,” Ron adds. “Very… blue.”
“I’m not sure if you said it or you just thought it so loudly that I could hear it,” Draco says, and then sighs. “I think that made sense. Never mind.”
He puts the earmuffs on and links his fingers through Harry’s as they walk through the quiet street, huffing out cold breath and kicking up frost. Harry darts covert glances at the earmuffs, feeling sure that he wants to make some comment but unable to string the words together. As earmuffs go, they are unremarkable, plain and black without a fluffy pink fibre in sight, but the sight of Draco wearing them is just…
“Okay,” Harry shrugs, accepting his sheaf of notes and trying not to smile.
“Alright,” he says, peering under the table. “It’s not a rat, it’s a mouse. I don’t know how it got into your ear trumpet, Eilish, but I don’t think mice eat human brains.”
Luna can’t hear Ginny’s response over the sudden hammering of the bodhran, but she wrinkles her nose in sympathy.
I would just like to point out that Marie chose all of the prompts this year, so this Drappley interlude is her doing. Not that I didn't enjoy it. For a truly maddening prompt, you will have to wait until the 23rd to see what I ended up with O.o
“I’ll say it’s for a good cause,” Ginny says. “And if that doesn’t work, I’ll put flatulence powder in their sandwiches… speaking of which…”
Harry follows his eyes and groans, suddenly aware of the frost underfoot and the freezing water soaking through his woollen socks.
“George.
“I’ve got a pink hat,” her brother says, frowning.
“Yes, thanks. Apparently, what I needed was sixteen hours of sleep.”
Harry just smiles. “Does Derek need anything else?”
As if on cue, Mr Borteg emerges from the back room and flails into the shop on his spindly legs. He looks at the swan, at Harry and Draco and their piece of parchment and shakes his head.
“It’s a little office,” Harry says, grinning.
that he almost drops his gin and tonic.
Perplexed, Harry reads the note again. Hermione doesn’t mention the reason she was cooking carrots at ten in the morning, how she managed to burn them, or what carrot-based dish she thinks is Ron’s favourite meal, but she is his friend and he’s not about to let her disparage herself like that. Grabbing a pen, he flips the piece of paper over and scribbles what he hopes is a reassuring response. By the time he has fed the owl a bit of leftover breakfast pastry and sent it on its way, Mr Borteg is waving his arms around with spiky enthusiasm and waxing lyrical about the properties of magical woods.
Finally, she grabs a bottle of
“We could go to Canada,” Draco says, picking up their earlier conversation with ease. “I’ve heard it’s beautiful.”
Harry sighs. “We’ve got nothing, have we?”
The last thing this morning’s shower had been was efficient. In fact, it had been decidedly inefficient, given that the washing process itself led to the most energetic wake-up sex Draco has ever experienced, which led to the need to carry out the washing process a second time. And that, he has to admit, had been a close thing.
“Goodnight, Harry,” comes the reply, voice muffled by what sounds like a crackleball.
Pansy smirks. “I never said that it was, but honestly?” She retrieves the Prophet and holds it up. “This is a first kiss. It’s awkward. It’s stiff. You look terrified.”
With that, she nods and hurries back to the bar.
“But weren’t you here yesterday?” Deb persists, and Harry shifts on the spot.
To his relief, Mr Borteg doesn’t say a word, and when the shop door opens again, a large group of chattering women spills inside, swarming the shelves and immediately striking up a friendly conversation.
“I feel ninety-two,” he sighs, rubbing at his face and wincing. “Did I really try to climb that lamp post?”
“Malfoys do not dance,” Draco says, and there is a note of amusement in his voice that intrigues Luna.
“Okay,” Ginny says, slashing her wand at the midges again. She looks down at the stream, expression intense and silvery glimmer rippling. “But imagine this: next Saturday, there’s going to be a solar eclipse.”
Draco studies him for what feels like far too long. “Alright.”
Harry glances over at Draco’s window. “What about inside?”
“Really?” Otis asks, staring at his friend.
“Ah! That… that is very clever,” Luna’s father agrees, grabbing a fork and clanging it against the metal tea tray. “You’re saying… ‘look what a noise we can make without real instruments… imagine the infernal racket we could make if we had them’!”
“I’m going to look at the stalls,” he says a little too loudly, leaving Draco and Mrs Purley behind and joining the others now milling around the newly snow-dotted section of the alley.
“He was having his flat cleansed,” Ron says, folding his arms. “There was a spirit trapped in the… you know all of this already. Anyway, I thought you liked Avi.”
The snow that had begun to fall overnight now lies in pristine white drifts over the countryside surrounding the Burrow, and every whirling snowflake seems to settle and stick fast. It’s a dazzling view from the steps of the Knight Bus, but Harry can’t help wondering how George and Angelina are feeling about it. The whole event is supposed to take place outside, and though he’s always privately thought it a risky choice for December, he hadn’t really expected this.
His English is about as good as Ginny’s French, but they clearly adore each other. This is his first experience of Weasley Sunday Madness, and he seems quietly terrified, which Harry takes as a rather good sign. Anyone who faces his family with real confidence has to have a screw loose somewhere.
a strange man and Harry hates the way he makes him feel strange without his permission. People who are sort-of friends should be able to get along in a nice, easy, sort-of fine way, he thinks. He also thinks that nobody has ever told Draco this, and because of that oversight their interactions are awkward and strained in a way that makes Harry feel confused during them and cross afterwards.
. The fact that he is clearly in the middle of telling a story to a sunblock-smeared Ivy is also to be expected, but the rather possessive hand on Fergus Quinlan’s knee and the presence of a Gryffindor-themed bracelet on his wrist is extremely interesting.
“You’d better get used to it if this is the job you want to do, young man,” Jean says, handing him a towel that smells slightly of owls. “Haven’t you heard of an umbrella charm?”
“We’re hoping some of the other shop owners will close up for long enough to see the ceremony,” Shan says, and her smile is brighter than Harry has ever seen it. “It’ll only be short and it doesn’t seem right to do it without our friends.”
“Hermione,” he mumbles.
Harry regards him dubiously. “Really? I’m pretty sure I was just talking rubbish.”
The sound is dry and warm and wonderful and it seems to vibrate through Harry’s whole body, leaving him feeling unbalanced.
Luna beams and claps along with them. “What was that then?”
“What did you do to it?” he asks, fascinated.
When the bus pitches up and the doors open, he boards with a heavy heart. The driver’s seat is empty. Puzzled, he closes the doors and steps beyond the curtain.
“That’s right,” Draco says, still staring at his cards. “And you don’t need any help; you’ve won twenty-five Knuts from me today already.”
When it comes down to it, he chooses badly. He has let his friends try, and despite their best efforts, they have chosen badly, too. And it’s fine, because now that he’s in his thirties, he’s begun to appreciate the simple pleasure of being by himself and doing whatever the hell he wants to do. He sleeps better without the snores of a rhinoceros or the constant groping of drunken hands, and no one is sucking the joy out of his life because they can’t find their own.
“We only like to make sure he’s alright,” Eilish says guiltily.
Draco lets out an inelegant snort and grabs his hand, pulling him out into the freezing cold night. There isn’t an artificial light for miles around, and it takes Harry several seconds to adjust to the blanket of complete darkness, but when he looks up, his mouth drops open. The sky is littered with more stars than he has ever seen in one place, more even than seems reasonable, and wherever he looks the tiny points of light seem to follow him.
“I take it that his house is still unplottable?” Draco asks Pansy on Wednesday morning, staring at the message in front of him and shuddering.
“Just to confirm that, the Eye in the Sky has revealed what appears to be a crocodile, currently being taken down Diagon Alley for a walk in the rain by Harry Potter,” he says, attempting to sound professional but suspecting he doesn’t quite keep the very real bewilderment out of his voice.
To her delight, Draco’s impromptu performance is the number one subject of conversation in the home for the rest of the day. Despite both Harry and Luna being sworn to secrecy, the news passes around the children like a case of dragon pox, catching up those who had not been lucky enough to witness the event in person and looping back around those that had, so many excitable times that when it finally reaches the office, it has made somewhat of a departure from the truth.
“Look, Louis,
“He’s a very good judge of character,” Draco says, and Mr Jennings scoffs.
They make it to the Old Trout just as Gertie is buttoning herself into her coat.
“Better than Yorkshire?” Neville asks, hamming up his Northern twang as far as it will go.
“I’m sure they are, and I’m also sure they don’t want someone like me at their table,” Draco says, and while his face is hard and unreadable, the words are sighed softly, and he shoots Harry a tiny smile before urging the bus into action again.
“That’s not magic. Anyway, Mr Troughton is doing that. But I thought… you’ll know some people who can come and wave to her. You know lots of people.”
The editor frowns. He glances at Draco as though he will have the sense to grab Harry and drag him out of the office, but Draco stays exactly where he is. Now that they’re here, now that they’ve got what they came for, he doesn’t see why Harry shouldn’t ask a few questions of his own, or at least enjoy himself a little bit. They owe him that much.
Juno peers at him for a moment and then abandons Harry’s shoulder, dashing across the floor, up the stairs and out of sight.
Needle hisses at the sound. Florean looks down at him and shakes his head.
“Harry, just go,” Hermione whispers, leaning down to touch his shoulder.
“Yep. They’re good ones, I promise, lots of glitter and stuff,” Harry says, shuffling the cards to find the right one for each lady.
“I’m Harry, this is Draco…” Harry pauses and looks down at the swan, who looks back, seeming not to notice the piece of grass that is stuck to his beak. “And this is Needle.”
For some reason, Rose finds this hilarious and she buries her head in Harry’s coat, shaking with laughter. With no free hands to take the menu, Harry cranes his neck and scans the list of dishes.
He shifts in the rumpled sheets so that he is lying on his side, head propped up one hand, while the other strokes slowly down Draco’s back. He is sprawled on his stomach, hair ruffled and expression utterly peaceful. He doesn’t wake when Harry touches him, even when he traces his fingertips over the pink, crescent-shaped marks that stretch across his lower back, and even when Harry lets out a soft sigh as he thinks about how they got there, hours before the sun came up. Harry fits his fingernails to the marks absently and smiles, suddenly very aware of his morning hardness, brushing the sheets and aching for attention.
“I think we should keep this between the four of us for now,” Florean says at last. His eyes drift to Needle and a flicker of a smile almost breaks his grave expression. “The five of us. We don’t want to create panic.”
Harry nods. “I remember. He thought we were being too loud.”
“Was your mother particularly hairy?” Harry asks innocently.
“Good idea, love,” Jean says.
Draco turns his back on Potter to hide his smile of triumph. He can’t be sure exactly what he has just achieved, but he definitely has the sense that he has gained ground somehow. It’s a start.
Harry wrinkles his nose. “I hope it wasn’t a bristle beetle.”
“My Christmas tree,” he improvises. “I’ll need to put it up soon and getting the decorations out of the attic always makes me cross.”
“No, but I once spelled the whole lot off because I was cross at my parents,” she says. “We were having professional portraits taken the next day and I refused to put it back until afterwards. We still have the pictures somewhere—my mother likes to get them out to embarrass me.”
“Aye, well,” she says after a moment. “Ye cannae run forever. Youse’re good lads. Youse’ll face things head on, I know it.”
“It’s okay,” Harry whispers against his mouth, “I know,” and then kisses Draco with dedication, wrapping one arm around his waist and sliding the fingers of his other hand against Draco’s jaw with such careful desire that he aches all over.
Draco nods solemnly. “Yes.”
“We could put him in his boots,” Harry suggests, Summoning the little box with a lazy flick of his wrist.
“Her mother,” Hermione says simply.
“Right.” She breathes in deeply, exhales slowly, and turns to the little girl. “Rose... yesterday, when you were playing in the garden, did you talk to Mr Fortuna?”
Feeling rather dazed, he lifts his hand and stares at it. His skin is grey in the early morning gloom, his nails ragged, and his palm covered in tiny scars from the attentions of an over-enthusiastic wild puffskein he had been asked to hold for a photograph during his most recent campaign. The sight of the marks makes him smile, and then Draco’s words drift back into his head and he shivers.
“She’s been very kind to us,” Draco says, sipping his water. “I’m not really sure why.”
“What on earth are you wearing, Potter?” she asks suddenly, eyeing Harry’s t-shirt and jeans.
“Me neither,” Harry says, looking up from his notes. “I don’t see why we can’t have both things—make sure the thefts stop and try to find out who did it.”
“I told you those weather forecasters always get it wrong,” Harry says, tipping his head back and catching a snowflake on his tongue.
“I didn’t forget my child,” Harry says obediently.
“Where to?” Draco asks.
“You must be joking. He has bookings weeks in advance,” Harry says, setting down Rose so that she can run ahead and choose her skates.
Eilish sets the owl down on the table and removes the letter tied to his leg. Juno jumps up to sniff at his feathers and he takes off, flapping for all he’s worth, colliding with the chandelier and coming to rest in the overhead luggage rack.
“Sorry,” mumbles Ginny, who has somehow found her way onto her brother’s stag party, despite being also included on the guest list for Angelina’s hen. “What did you stop for?”
“It isn’t just you, you know,” Draco says.
“Are you supposed to be on there?” he asks, but Juno merely flicks her large ears and gazes at him calmly. “It does look like a nice chair…”
Harry leaves him with a great sense of reluctance and goes to find the bathroom. Here, the lamps light automatically and pour soft light over a small, neat room with a waxed wooden floor and a shower cubicle that is definitely big enough for two. Grinning, he turns to the sink and scrubs at his face and hands with lemon-scented soap until he almost looks like himself again. A shower in the morning should fix the rest, and could very well be a lot of fun.
“Haven’t seen your swan in here for a while,” Tom says, pausing in his sweeping to greet them.
Harry abandons his coffee on a side table and hastens to follow Draco to the bathroom, where they step under the gushing hot water and fall together, trading lazy kisses as the glass enclosure warms and fills with steam. Harry’s fingers trail over Draco’s wet skin, grazing his hipbones and making him gasp, wrapping his hand around their aching cocks and stroking them together. Draco groans in protest when he lets go but laughs and shudders when Harry turns him against the tiles and kisses the back of his neck as he presses inside him with careful fingers.
He walks away, long coat whipping behind him. In the corner, Needle wakes from a long sleep and hisses in protest at being left behind. He stretches his long neck out of his crate and rests his head on the stone floor, peering up at Harry with his clever little eyes.
“Not really. She’s only a freshwater crocodile.”
“I’m good at cleaning windows!” shouts Wayne from the fruit stall.
The distillery is mostly untouched, but Harry takes his time cleaning away the soot from the copper stills, the tops of the barrels, the stone floor and Mr Borteg’s desk. He looks at his temporary office with its map and list of victims and then walks away, returning to the shop and hitting everything in sight with the best cleaning spells he can muster. By the time the little shop is mostly back to normal, Harry is sticky with sweat and grime and his wand arm aches from shoulder to wrist.
“Is that a mouse?” Ginny whispers, leaning down to inspect Harry’s cage.
“If I call an emergency meeting, he might suspect and disappear,” Florean explains. “We’ll take things calmly… let him think he’s still getting away with it.”
Perhaps there’s no such thing as a life in perfect balance, he thinks, and perhaps that’s absolutely fine. Even Elegua cannot tell him what his future holds, but he’s walking towards it with Draco at his side, and he can’t imagine a better way to travel. Needle stops wandering around the kitchen and sits on Harry’s feet, pulling gently at his trouser fabric as if to remind him that he, too, is a vital part of the picture.
“Not everywhere,” Rose points out as they stop in the street. “The big lights aren’t on yet. Are you going to put lights in your window?”
“He was brave and strong and rebellious... all those things that you are, Harry, and he ran away. He looked at what was happening around him and he fucked right off. Because he had to.”
“Where are we going?” he asks after several minutes of silence and an unexpected trip along the motorway.
“I was watching. I watched her slip around you and run away,” Draco says serenely. “Just like I’m watching the other one escape right now.”
“You’re the man from the coffee shop,” Mary Ann says suddenly, and Luna pulls away from Harry, following her eyes.
“You shouldn’t,” Harry assures. “I didn’t think of it either until someone brought it up at our shopkeepers’ meeting. It’s just nice to be able to do something about it. The idea is, you pay a Galleon for an ornament that you get to keep, and then you buy a present for a child and bring it back to put under our tree.”
“No, just myself,” he admits. He fishes out the bag of sweets and hands it to her. “Remember to chew.”
Beside her, Benny adds an out-of-time
Draco smiles slowly. “Community service,” he says with an odd sort of relish.
Caroline smiles cautiously, sending warm relief spiralling through Luna’s chest.
“Why?” Harry asks, even though he knows exactly why. His stomach is heavy and uncomfortable, and the thought of opening the letter makes him feel quite sick.
“What’s in it?” Harry asks eagerly.
“Perhaps it’s the music,” Luna suggests at last.
“Well, let’s just hope she can read between the lines and no one will have anything to worry about,” he says instead. “And that she doesn’t explode with rage about us missing a few lessons.”
**~*~**
Draco’s chest aches and he sighs. “I do not want to talk about Harry Potter.”
“In a minute,” says another, patting Stanley’s shell. “Let’s do him up a bit first.”
“He didn’t, Mr Potter. I tried some of them and the rest were used in the restaurant,” she says, setting down her cup and folding her hands. “Draco doesn’t drink whisky. In fact, he doesn’t drink alcohol at all. I assumed that you knew that.”
“Harry, I know you don’t always make sense, but if you’ve bought a cat and you’re keeping it a secret… well, that’s strange, even for you.”
“I’m afraid not,” someone says, and the voice is much closer now. “You alright, mate?”
Something leaps inside Harry’s chest as he wraps his fingers around his own notebook and nods.
Draco blinks. “I’d better unlock the door.”
“Reptiles,” Draco says absently, still peering through the Eye as Potter and his friend make their way along the rain-slicked cobbles. “Crocodiles are reptiles.”
Harry nods, considering this pearl of wisdom. “Me too. What happened to the spider?”
“Aren’t you going to sit with us?” asks a lady with a heavy West Indian accent, and Harry turns to her.
When he closes the barn door behind himself, they flop back into the grass and stare up at the clear highland sky. It seems like only seconds have passed when William emerges with his buckets. They help him carry them down to the farmhouse, watching as the goats spill out of the barn and scatter, before piling back into the Land Rover to join Gertie for a well-earned lunch.
“I don’t want to see you again until you’ve told him everything that’s in your heart,” Esmee says, taking out the amber earring and pinning it to his jacket. “For luck,” she whispers, and returns to Shan’s side.
“Right,” Kettleworth says, flinching when Needle stretches up to his full height and flaps his wings.
Draco looks up. “What?”
“I just... even when we really didn’t like each other, you were always...” Harry wrinkles his nose and stares hard at his lunch. “I don’t know how to explain it, but you were always so cross about everything, and a bit... sort of... theatrical. I think that’s why people like listening to you talk.”
“Has everyone got enough gravy?” Molly asks, regarding her husband with a mixture of exasperation and affection.
“Method,” Luna reads, frowning in concentration. It’s important that she concentrates. It’s all too easy to let her mind drift, to start wondering whether her father has eaten the breakfast she left, or exactly what crows worry about, or how many things are living in the stream at her feet, and then it’ll be midday and time to leave for work and she won’t have made any progress at all. Professor McGonagall used to tick her off for daydreaming all the time, and Luna still remembers the exasperation in her voice whenever she performed a spell correctly after paying next to no attention all through the lesson.
“We tried that last year,” says the pale-coloured one, giver of mint leaves and Stanley’s best friend. “It ended up all flat on one side, remember?”
“Of course,” Fred says grandly. “How now, brown cow?”
“Are you doing this on purpose?” he demands, when Draco opens the doors. “Or is that a silly question?”
“I was talking to
“It isn’t that.”
Harry Potter and there is a chance someone would listen to you,” Draco points out.
Beside the stall, not quite in the queue and not quite out of it, stands a young man in dark blue.
“What about you, Draco?” Eilish asks.
“I’ll come now,” Harry says, ignoring Draco’s next words as he gets to his feet and Disapparates in one hurried movement.
“You look brilliant,” Ginny says. “All of you.”
“I’ve got an air purifying spell that should clear out that stuff in no time,” Mr Pike offers. “Someone will have to take care of Carmella, though.”
“I think… this is either going to be the best wedding I’ve ever been to… or the weirdest,” Draco says, expression pensive as he leans against the counter.
He looks at Draco, who is looking right back, slicing into a carrot baton and slowly lifting an eyebrow in a way that makes Harry’s stomach pull tight.
Danica blinks. “I was planning to leave him here, of course.”
“I really am sorry, but… ooh, is that roast chicken?” he asks, sniffing the air.
At just about thirty seconds to twelve, the door opens and Draco stalks out, resplendent in beautiful pyjamas of soft, silvery grey that fit him so perfectly they must have been made for him. The shirt hangs elegantly on his angular frame and the buttons pull the fabric closed at mid-chest, revealing the pale, smooth skin that has often made Luna slightly envious. He turns to lock the door with a spell and Luna doesn’t think she imagines the tiny groan that escapes Harry’s lips. She doesn’t blame him; it’s a very lovely bottom and the fabric covering it clings just enough to spark the imagination. Draco is a very attractive man, and while very much not her type, she thinks she understands.
“I don’t blame her,” Neville says, appearing at her side and putting an arm around her waist. “Getting married is terrifying.”
“I’m not going to get embarrassed,” Harry lies, pressing his mouth to Draco’s warm, lemon-scented skin and wrapping his fingers around his cock, already feeling himself starting to stir when it leaks against his palm and Draco shudders beside him.
Her indignant expression makes everyone else around the table burst into laughter, and it takes a solemn promise of an extra large piece of Christmas pudding to put a reluctant smile back on her face. Placated, she chews through the sprout in record time and begins attacking her potatoes, at which point the rest return to their food. As usual, Molly’s festive spread is outstanding, and Harry helps himself to a little bit of everything in sight, taking care to save room for dessert as well as the inevitable piles of mince pies and biscuits.
Draco watches her step back from him and then Disapparate in a cloud of heavy perfume. Despite her frequent insinuations, he isn’t actually looking for a man. He’s quite content to be by himself, in fact, and when he actually desires some company, he has Pansy, he has firecalls with his parents, which are never dull. He has his colleagues at the WWN, some of whom are due a coffee-related act of revenge. He has a number of ways to spend his afternoons, too, he reminds himself firmly, when his eyes drift quite without his permission in the direction of the Magical Menagerie.
“It really isn’t,” Danica mumbles, and her voice feels very far away.
“They’re the victims,” Ron says. He doesn’t add ‘obviously’ but he doesn’t need to.
Draco smiles but doesn’t look away from the road. He balances his half eaten apple against the steering wheel and pushes a fall of pale hair out his eyes with his free hand.
“Children are much the same as they have ever been, I see,” he says, jigging Hugo gently and treating him to a ghoulish smile.
“Come on, Timothy; let’s go and sit down.”
“Of course. My mind is completely under my control,” Draco says, striding over to Mr Borteg’s desk and rearranging his quills.
“Are you really going to call him Needle?” Harry asks suddenly.
“Thanks!” Harry says brightly, and Draco lets out a dry cackle.
“I know we’re in a Muggle pub, Ron, but I don’t need my wand to kick you in the crotch,” Ginny says.
“Perhaps I should be grateful to sleep alone,” Narcissa says, just as the soup bowls are taken away and replaced with large white plates containing their main courses.
“This is turning into quite a day,” Shan sighs, still smiling. “I wonder if Esmee’s had any gifts from strangers yet.”
Harry allows himself a moment to picture Mr Borteg’s spindly figure lurching around in the multicoloured madness of George’s shop. He smiles.
“The kits wish to see justice being served, Harry, as do I. However, I have taken the liberty of casting a protective charm around the barrels, lest your murmurings sour their delicate flavours.”
“Of course,” he lies, and takes another bite of his cake. “So, aren’t you upset about all of this?”
. Now he can hear the tack-tack-tacking of a beetle who knows he’s in the soup, and he’s actually going to have to walk away from this. Prickling with irritation, he throws on the first clothes he sees and flings open the bedroom door. Stanley shoots out from under the coffee table and bobbles around his feet, directing ingratiating little clicks up at his knees. Because of course, the little bugger is adorable, and Draco is almost sold until he spots the mess of soil and leaves and ceramic in front of the door.
“I heard that,” Corrie says.
“Thank you for that,” he says, feeling better than he has all day. “Would you like to help me choose a Christmas tree?”
Cold to the bone, they trudge up to the top deck and fill the copper bath with water so hot that it turns their skin pink. In a haze of delicious-smelling steam, they trade lazy kisses and slow strokes until, finally returned to a comfortable temperature, they retreat to the bed, splashing footprints on the floor and flinging big white towels over the bedclothes.
“It’s not up to me,” Luna says. “Maybe you should all save up for one.”
“Oh, fucking hell,” he mumbles, making the hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stand up and prickle. “It’s her, isn’t it?”
Eliza shakes her head, dark pigtails flapping back and forth. “No… it’s marbellous… ’cause… he’s brilliant… like a marble,” she declares.
Draco regards him thoughtfully. “You do seem to enjoy all this conservation stuff. Perhaps you should focus on that.”
“Yeah,” he says after a moment, attempting nonchalance and almost falling through someone’s hedge. “I meant to do that.”
“I’ve got one,” Draco says. “But I don’t have a hat.”
“Well, once,” Ron admits. “You said ‘goodness, look at all those candelabras’ and then you laughed and started snoring again.”
“Perhaps this will be the one.”
The old woman peers at him, screwing up her little eyes. “Is she?”
Molly looks at him as though he’s just announced he’s planning to swim up the Thames naked, and then she brightens. “I’ve been practising cup cakes for the wedding. Well, Angelina says that’s what they are but they just look like big fairy buns to me. They taste nice, though… do you want one?”
Needle lifts his head and makes to get out of his new malt crate bed but Draco holds out a hand and he settles, contenting himself with watching the customer’s every move.
“They took the presents,” he says softly. “The new magic on our till seems to have outsmarted them.”
“There was a child present who isn’t even mentioned in this article,” Draco adds, holding out the newspaper.
Irritated, cold and soaking wet, Harry turns to stare at him. “You’re the one who agreed to it! Why do you think she gave you the fucking key?”
“No, it’s definitely you. Oh, there’s Draco—I haven’t had anything from him yet,” Mrs Purley says, taking off with her jug.
She watches him working on the cherry for a moment and then turns to her book. Harry and Draco may have moved up the list somewhat, but she isn’t about to forget her ongoing campaigns. Drawing her wand, she performs a script scrambling charm to disguise her handwriting and then dashes off a letter to one Ronald Weasley. She has sent a dozen such letters in recent months, all of them raving about his delicious baked goods and demanding that he open a patisserie or cookie stall or pie shop, depending on her mood or the character she imagines is writing the letter.
“I suppose you help each other, then,” Harry says. “How’s business?”
There must have been a date on the shopfront at some point, but it has been lost to time and weathering and no one, least of all Mr Borteg, has ever bothered to reinstate it. Suffice to say that the shop has been around for quite a long time, and the sight of the gently glowing mullioned windows and the black and gold shopfront makes Harry feel instantly at home.
“It’s not your fault—I keep telling you,” Draco says, sounding defeated. “It was a ridiculous thing to lie about. Perhaps it’s for the best. We can all get back to normal now.”
“Of course,” Harry says, and in the face of bewilderment, he opts to carry on. “So, anyway, Angelina’s treating the whole lead up to the wedding as some kind of training exercise, and there’s no way George would get away with a night out anywhere close to the day, so we decided…” Harry falls silent as a large dark shape swishes through the curtain that separates the driver’s area from the rest of the bottom deck. “What on earth is that?”
“I didn’t,” Otis promises. “But really… don’t you want to go?”
“I promised myself I would not,” she sighs. “I have already had too many things from the sweetie stall and I am getting fat.”
“I don’t know what this is,” admits the girl with the warming charm, lifting something silver and shiny from its wrappings.
“I suppose it does,” Draco concedes. “The thing is, these are very rare. Very few were ever made, and this one happens to be marked with the initials of Ernest Egbert Prang.”
He’s going to miss it horribly when they have to leave.
She moves around, winding her way between the children and letting the simple joy of flinging oneself around flow over her. Every one of them has a different approach, from Serafina’s excitable leaping to Gareth’s solemn-faced stomping, and each of them glows with their own unique shimmering shade, washing Luna’s vision with a rainbow of magical colour.
“Fine,” Potter says, standing up and brushing sawdust from his dress. “You do that.”
“Mr Malfoy? Have you got a minute?”
“She can come and fight me for him. He’s my Needle and that’s that,” Draco says.
“Well, none of you have particularly quiet voices,” Marius says, and Harry isn’t sure if he wants to smile or die of shame. “Thank you for inviting me. You have a lovely home.”
Harry grins. “I’m sure we can work something out.”
“Did you really think I’d get bored of seeing this?” he laughs, shuddering when Draco wraps a slicked hand around his cock and strokes him. “Did you—
Then again, he always sounds like that. Rose peers up at him from her desk, watching his odd, insect-like gait and the flap of his long, silver-streaked plait. Today his hair is tied at the end with a black velvet ribbon, but just as often it’s a piece of string, a shoelace, and on one memorable occasion, a surprisingly compliant little black snake.
“I suppose I could take the Borteg’s Own, but I expect a discount,” the man says airily.
“Probably not.”
“Because if I didn’t, I’d eat nothing but cake all day,” Draco says, biting into the apple and wiping his mouth on his shirt sleeve with infuriating grace. “I’d be the size of a house and my teeth would have all fallen out. The compartment is not a secret, it is merely conveniently located. I think the driver and conductor used to keep their wands in it during the bus’s… rowdier years.”
“Something blue,” he explains. “You’ll pass them along to the brides, won’t you?”
“Sorry about that,” he says, hiding his map with a prod of his wand. “We can be good.”
Mr Borteg’s shoulders lift in a jerky approximation of a shrug. “I believe he was searching for a bottle of whisky that only you could provide,” he says with a long, drawn out sigh. He heads back to his distillery, muttering to himself what sounds very much like, “… he’s a strange man.”
“Mrs Purley’s,” Draco says, and then frowns. “They aren’t robberies, you know.”
“You’re here,” Ron cries, hurrying over to join them with Hugo perched on his shoulders and clinging to tufts of his father’s hair. “Not that I was worried.”
“Of course you do,” Corrie says, shaking her head. She reaches into her bag and pulls out one more bobble hat, this one in thin black and white stripes.
“I can’t believe I’m herding goats. If I get eaten, it will be your fault.”
Luna watches as Ginny rummages in her bag, pulls out a large, paper-wrapped package and hands it over.
Harry pauses. “What?”
for a temporary shop manager. Mr Borteg had wanted to spend some time in his onsite distillery, creating a brand new whisky for the brand new millennium, and as such had needed a responsible, personable assistant to keep his famous shop afloat. Harry isn’t quite sure when ‘temporary’ became so much more, but more than a decade and several new whiskies later, he and Mr Borteg are rubbing along quite nicely.
“Listen to him,” she laughs, her dirty cackle echoing around the bus. “Sit yourself down, boy. Danica’s tea bread can’t be had standin’ up!”
“Art?” Draco repeats, pushing his hair out of his eyes and managing to smear purple ink across his temple. “Why would you… hold on… how did he open the…”
“I’m sure,” Harry says, and he isn’t, but there’s no way he’s going to admit it.
“Bugger,” he mumbles, and then something rather unexpected happens.
“Why don’t you do it, then?”
Esmee distributes gifts to the others, making sure not to leave out the unconscious patients. Charlotte, too, gets a present, despite her brother’s insistence that she isn’t even ill.
She has heard all of Blaise’s stories about Carlie the wonder dog, especially over the weeks since her death, and she never tires of them. Losing a friend is always painful, but she thinks there is something about the pure, trusting nature of canines that makes the loss that much sharper. What Blaise really needs to do is get another dog, but these things cannot be forced. For now, the small gifts will have to be enough.
“Yeah, because you’re an expert,” George teases.
“I thought goats were little white things,” Draco calls suddenly, sounding alarmed.
“Stop it,” Draco says, and Harry looks up guiltily to see that he is leaning against the wall of the distillery, shirt sleeves rolled up to expose pale forearms and the faded Mark, brown leather braces letting his trousers hang just right on his hips.
“Where?” Harry asks innocently. “Are we going somewhere special?”
“He suggested…” Draco hesitates.
He emerges, rubbing at the sore spot. “I can’t speak to him if he’s not here, can I?”
Draco lifts an eyebrow. “Er, yes?”
“Not any more, he doesn’t,” Mr Purley says, and several others agree.
He turns away quickly to stride across the shop and Draco has the strangest feeling that he’s trying not to laugh. He wishes he knew what everyone found so funny about his ducks.
“Can we wear any pyjamas we want?” Gareth asks, and the murmuring among the children falls silent, as though the answer to this question is the most important of all.
“We do,” Eilish says. “It takes him a long time to get the hint.”
“I shall look forward to our next meeting,” Mr Borteg says, granting Hugo a little jerky nod.
Draco smiles at the steering wheel and pulls away from the kerb, taking it slowly for several seconds before putting his foot down and sending the bus whizzing along the quiet streets at breakneck pace.
In an effort not to worry Rose, who knows nothing about the second incident, Harry busies himself with assisting her. He sits on the floor in front of the fire and hands her pencil crayons as she asks for them, occasionally selecting the wrong colour on purpose as it seems to amuse her.
“That’s right,” Eilish says. “On Thursdays she has her lunch at the Leaky Cauldron and then her son takes her to do her food shopping in Diagon Alley.”
“It is,” Draco says breathlessly as Harry kisses his neck. “But Needle needs a bath, you need to go and check on Mr Borteg, and my mother will be here any minute.”
“Nonsense, Ron, you just need to eat a bit more,” Molly says, beaming at her son.
“I’m not sure. I think he might have escaped, so I’m taking him back,” Harry says.
“I think you’ll be brilliant,” Rose says, returning her empty jar to the counter.
To his surprise, Molly nods, takes off her apron, and sits down next to him.
“Look at the stars.”
Draco sighs and reaches for his coffee cup. It seems ludicrous that only yesterday he and Harry were dashing around, collecting memories and confronting the editor of the Daily Prophet. In the wake of what had followed, he has managed to let the episode with Granger slip his mind completely, and now, seeing the retraction squashed into the corner of the front page by a stupid, reckless, ill-advised kiss, he feels a sort of quiet determination spread through him.
Two minutes later, Harry and Rose set off up the street, pointing out various bits of wedding preparation as they pass.
“Of course. You rescued him for me.” She shrugs. “I couldn’t very well name him after anyone else.”
“Hairy babies,” he mumbles to himself, surprised to hear a tap on the counter in response.
She kisses Hugo and buttons herself into a red wool coat that clashes brilliantly with Ron and Rose’s hair. With one last look around the kitchen, she slings her bag onto her shoulder and nods to her family.
By the time the three of them have finished cataloguing and photographing both scenes, the socks have gone off five more times, and Harry has thrown in the towel completely, singing along with Timothy at the top of his lungs. Draco, who insists he doesn’t know the words, regards them with a soft sort of amusement that seems to wash away almost all of Harry’s sadness.
“If ye see him, ye’ll know,” the man says mysteriously, and the old woman lets out a burst of crackly laughter.
When she arrives at the home on Saturday morning, the kids are bubbling over with energy. Most of them are already dressed in their freshly-washed nightwear and are darting around the place, giggling and sending Luna slightly off-balance with the leaping, blurring brightness of their colours.
Harry frowns, puzzled. “No, I just felt like it. Well, I didn’t want to come too late and miss Molly Weasley’s Sunday roast,” he says, deciding on total honesty. He can’t imagine it will do any harm at this point, and besides, Draco’s confusion is just delicious.
“Because I watched it being made. I think it was in fifth year… these were all over the Christmas tree in the Gryffindor common room. Hermione found some plain baubles in a box somewhere and Dean Thomas painted each one to look like a different teacher.” Harry inspects the pale face with its hooked nose and cross little eyes. “It’s a good likeness, isn’t it?”
“I will be here,” says the German sausage man, and all the other stallholders jump in to back him up.
“I thought you might say that. However, you do need to eat, so I also brought these.”
Corrie acquiesces, still mumbling to herself, and Harry sits on the top bar of the luggage rack to watch their game. He has never seen such serious faces on the ladies, and Draco’s little frown of concentration makes him want to smile.
Draco pushes away from the sculpture and falls into step beside him, stomach grumbling fiercely as if woken from a long hibernation.
Luna looks too, wondering just what would happen if everyone at Starlight did turn up in their nightclothes. It would probably frighten the children. That aside, though, Luna can’t help imagining her colleagues at their most vulnerable… whether Sam would wear matching pyjamas, buttoned up to his neck, whether Mary Ann really does sleep in her husband’s Hufflepuff yellow boxer shorts like she once joked, or whether Deb ever wears the red satin thing she got in the staff’s last Christmas gift exchange.
“Didn’t we go to the pub that night to celebrate you finally coming to your senses?” Ron asks.
The glimmer of truth in his words is unexpected, and Draco finds himself smiling as he takes a bite of warm, crispy bread, thick, salty ham, melted cheese and sweet cherry tomatoes.
“I brush my teeth properly,” Rose tells Alison indignantly.
Harry replaces the cube and walks past Needle into the living room, where Draco is standing with a cup in each hand, completely absorbed in the morning weather report.
Harry watches as Draco retrieves a little silk bag from his pocket and ties it loosely around Needle’s neck with a ribbon. The bag bounces against Needle’s breast as he reaches up to be stroked.
Hermione looks down at her plate. A smile picks at the corner of her mouth.
“Oh,” the customer says, looking disappointed as she places a basket on the counter. “I was going to get this one, but that sounds so wonderful… maybe I should come back.”
“Happy to help,” Harry says, taking the offered money and putting the bottle into a shiny bag. “I hope she likes it and decides to give you a break.”
“Draco, don’t be a prat when I’m trying to apologise to you,” Harry sighs. “I’m probably interfering where I’m not wanted here, but I want to help. Today I sorted out a bit of a solution with someone I trust, and if you want it, it’s there.”
“Of course, but I only keep the weird ones.”
“I didn’t know you had a garden,” Harry says, looking around.
, her voice echoes in his head,
“And that’s how it’s done,” Timothy says admiringly.
“If you’d like,” Draco says, and when he starts to move forward, Harry stays with him, matching his pace and chattering to him about absolutely nothing as they thread through the groups of other skaters.
“We’ve been fooled once, but we won’t allow it a second time,” Danica says. “This time, there
Mr Borteg leans in to read Florean’s words. “It seems like a summons to me, Harry. The reason, however, remains a mystery.”
“Uncle Harry, what are you going to do if the swan comes back again?” Rose asks innocently.
“Would it surprise you to know that this is not the first time I have heard about you and the Bembledacks?” Draco says.
“I’m a bit slow, maybe, but I worked it out,” Harry says, needing something to anchor him, too. He grabs the nearest metal pole. Breathes. “Vesseur Spane is Severus Snape, and unless he’s come back to life somehow, you lied to those ladies. You never hired another driver.”
“Oh, yeah, she’s in the shed with Dad,” George puts in. “He wanted her to look at the hole in the roof.”
“Of course.” Draco wraps his fingers around the book and flattens its unruly pages for a moment. “But one day, she’ll finish finding herself and she’ll come home.”
“Are we going on an outing?”
“Stole it, you mean,” Harry mutters, but he doesn’t really mean it.
“I’ll make sure they get there,” Harry promises, adding the box to his pocket along with the balls of bubblegum.
The soft woollen thing within unravels itself almost all the way to the floor, revealing itself to be a scarf knitted with a complicated snowflake pattern in blue, red and white. Harry puts it on immediately, startled to find that it hangs perfectly in place without his interference and loops a gentle silky warmth around his neck.
“I tried every fireplace in your house, and then I tried the Weasleys’—”
Draco continues to read out the news, watching Pansy as she sips her coffee, grimaces, and puts the cup back on the desk. He’s almost certain the coffee thief is one of the ‘late’ people. He and Pansy share their studio with the other ‘earlies’, Dave, who hosts the lunchtime show from twelve until five, and his weekend counterpart, Mad Annie, while the hosts of the evening and night-time programmes work out of the studio across the hall. The rivalry that exists between earlies and lates is mostly artificial and results in nothing more than pointless pranks, but Draco has no doubt that one of those hooligans is to blame for the sludge he and Pansy are now drinking.
“You always ruin my fun,” Draco sighs, putting his wand away and letting them into the cabin.
Harry looks, too. At first, he sees nothing, and then there’s one giant flake followed by another and another and another. Within seconds, his vision is blurred into brilliant white as snowflakes whirl down from the sky and drape themselves over his glasses. He smiles, reaching for his wand and applying a repelling charm. When the haze clears, he sees that the cobbles are already turning white and Draco’s dark coat is dotted with snow.
“No, it isn’t. What about… children? Stealing presents meant for children? If we all like children and the thief doesn’t… I don’t know where I’m going with this,” Harry admits. “Maybe we should think back to the last meeting and remember who seemed… the least outraged?”
Harry gives Arthur a grateful smile.
“Photographic, audio recording, Pensieve memory, impartial witness,” the woman recites without looking up from her work.
“Yes, well, just you think about it,” Draco mutters, turning slightly pink.
“Brilliant. I’ll see you there.”
Harry sighs. “I suppose that’s what he or she was hoping for—that they’d be long gone by the time anyone wondered why their window looked a bit funny.”
Harry just stares at them, feeling rather staggered. He can’t decide whether to be pleased at their easy acceptance or concerned that they seem to know all about his life without a single word from him. In the end, he can’t help but smile.
Draco shifts his hips and Harry bites his lip, tasting blood on his tongue. Slowly, he draws back almost all the way. Draco’s cock jerks and leaks against his belly.
“You’ve been to the park, what more do you want?”
“I loosened them,” Harry corrects. “Stanley wanted to be an artist and he needed some help. Everything else he did all by himself.”
“Of course. If you want to be a teapot, all you have to do is believe it,” she says, and within seconds, the room is filled with a whole variety of kitchen-themed interpretive dances.
“Not really,” he admits.
Harry laughs. “Absolutely.”
Next to Eliza, Draco is spinning slowly on one foot in perfect time to the sweeping music, his other leg trailing almost carelessly behind him as though connected by invisible strings to his raised arms. He seems to be oblivious to his audience, expression serene as he leans forward deeply for Eliza’s hands and lowers his upper body almost to the floor, trailing leg now extended beautifully behind him. For long seconds he balances there and then rights himself, turning slowly to regard the others with the resigned flush of someone who has just realised he is being watched.
“What time do you call this?”
Harry says nothing, opting to enjoy a moment of stillness before the hard work really begins. He watches the sleek, black and white creatures as they pick their way through the water, bending to drink or capering this way and that for no real reason other than pure enjoyment. One or two of them raise their long faces to regard the interlopers for a second or two before returning to their play. If the first two have spread news of the operation at hand to their friends, none of them seem particularly worried about it.
Draco glances at him and then walks into the shop without a word. Harry follows him, keeping a very close eye on Needle, whose fledgling self control is no match for an entire shop full of plants. At first, the place appears to be empty but then a blonde-haired woman emerges from a cloud of ferns and smiles at them. She tucks a pair of secateurs into her green apron and steps behind the counter. Sensing that he should let Draco take the lead on this, Harry looks around. Green things dangle from every rafter, vibrant flowers burst out of countless silver buckets and wash Harry’s vision in every colour of the rainbow. The air, so humid that he feels he might touch it, is drenched with scents that are sweet and spicy and exotic.
“Why didn’t I know about this?” Luna wonders, suppressing a sigh.
“I think all men are strange,” Rose says without looking up from her drawing. “Except Daddy.”
“If you put your hand on the dashboard, there will be,” Draco says firmly, edging the bus into a snarl of London traffic and yanking three different handles in turn.
“I know George and Angelina are staying in on Christmas Eve,” she muses. “Maybe they wouldn’t mind looking after the children. Have you called Molly yet?”
Around them, everyone is still watching the display, and Draco feels slightly disoriented, as though he hadn’t expected to open his eyes and find himself in daylight, much less in Diagon Alley.
, at which point he sits down at the kitchen table with his head in his hands until the last of his sanity prevails.
Harry watches Draco’s hands, sure on the wheel as he urges the bus through wild countryside, trees and hedges springing out of the way in alarm.
“I am not having a moment, little or otherwise, but why must you always do this?”
“Oh, I… sorry,” Harry mumbles distractedly, watching as Draco stalks out into the snow and sweeps his wand through the air, causing the Knight Bus to shimmer and disappear almost completely.
“What is codswallop?” Draco asks, momentarily distracted.
“I usually use a Notice-me-Not charm, actually,” Draco says, pulling his wand out of his sleeve and casting the spell around them both. “Thank you for reminding me.”
Hermione laughs. “You’d never know he’d been ill. His appetite has sort of exploded, but fortunately, Molly is in full-on baking mode and keeps sending us extra stuff. I left some bread and some cheese scones on your kitchen table.”
“Though we may not have her for long. She’s studying again,” George says.
“We’re married,” Esmee says, shaking her head. “I can’t believe it.”
“Planning,” Harry says firmly. “Details. That sort of thing.”
?” asks Benny, hopping from one foot to another in his excitement.
“I’m off men. I’ll take the dog.”
“Is this Callach Muir?”
“You know, if you tell me what you’re up to, I’ll probably leave you alone,” Draco says when he finds himself in the way of Potter’s broom for the third time in as many minutes.
Harry has nothing to say to that, so he looks around at his friends and colleagues and wonders, too. In a seat next to the counter, Mr Borteg sits with his long limbs folded, delicately consuming what can only be a child’s cone with a single scoop of orange and liquorice swirl. Beside him, Sophie from Quality Quidditch Supplies is eating something so violently blue that it can’t possibly have a flavour that exists in nature, and on his other side, George is working through a rainbow-coloured sundae with clouds of sparkling sherbet and already eyeing the lemon swirl Florean has accidentally made for Madame Malkin, who is far too busy setting up her Hogsmeade branch to attend meetings. Mrs Purley is taking delicate bites of her usual peach melba, and even Reuben, clearly anxious and exhausted, seems to be taking comfort in a dish of Florean’s richest, darkest chocolate. If he’s honest, he has no idea what any of it says about any of them, and perhaps it doesn’t matter.
“Don’t worry about them, Mr Barleycorn,” the driver says, still bathed in shadow as he looks over his shoulder at the old man. “Everything’s fine. You go back to bed and I’ll put up a Silencing Charm.”
Harry looks at his friends and sighs. “Really?”
As he waits in the drizzle for the Knight Bus to appear, he’s still a little frayed around the edges, but most of the previous day is sliding back into focus. He remembers the window boxes and the discussion about Mr Spain, but when he thinks about being alone on the bus with Draco in the darkness, he can’t be certain it happened at all.
Harry frowns. “You’re not fat, Daraja, you’re beautiful,” he says firmly. “And even if you were, you really shouldn’t miss out on currywurst.”
“Yes, and I agree with her,” Shan says. She exchanges a significant glance with Mrs Barton and then points at the door. “Go on, then. Do it now before you change your mind.”
Startled, Harry pauses in his stirring and the custard bubbles ominously.
“He didn’t have to come,” Draco points out, but he scoops Needle into his arms and deposits him in Sage’s lobby. “Shall we go and try out this charm?”
“They’re having a night in a nice hotel and then coming back,” Harry says. “They don’t want to go off on holiday when it’s so near to Christmas—where would people get their crackleballs?”
“Not before lunch,” she says, but she smiles as she places them on his bedside cabinet.
“Would it hurt you to learn some patience?”
“I think that’s how they got in this time,” Draco says, returning with a pair of shoes and handing them to Harry.
“I’ve got this. Come on, I’ll buy you a drink.”
Now livid with himself and Mr Jennings, he stomps across the floor to join Draco at the map.
“Do you really think my telephone did that to him?” she asks, expression turning anxious.
Harry smiles grimly. “I think my problem has always been not knowing when to give up. A few weeks ago I just sort of... snapped. I thought I could just... I thought I could just give them the finger, you know? Do things that didn’t make sense. Show them that I didn’t give a fuck, they could print what they wanted.”
Eliza releases him and applauds enthusiastically. After a moment, the rest of the children join in.
The ladies laugh, and Thora cracks a reluctant smile that takes Harry by surprise. Under the table, something brushes his ankle, and he bends to see Montague cowering between his feet, brown eyes fixed on the mouse cage with deep suspicion.
“Yes, you’re not leaving us behind!” Danica says fiercely, still hanging onto Eilish’s hand.
Hearing Draco’s footsteps on the decks above, Harry glances around the table, certain he can fashion a hat if he can think creatively.
“Don’t be, he’ll be delighted,” Draco says, almost sounding amused. “All that stuff that the other Slytherins think about me trying to weasel my way into your good graces—he’ll think that’s a brilliant idea. Almost makes me want to call the whole thing off.”
The next morning, she dresses in as many colours as she can lay her hands on, including her favourite purple trousers that flap around her as she walks, and a mango-coloured cardigan that used to belong to her mother. She leaves her father in the garden with his Dirigible Plums and takes her morning coffee down to the stream.
Ginny grins, silvery glimmer surging around her. “I’ll hold you to that. Hey... look at Slughorn and your dad!”
Happiness breeds happiness, she supposes, and every last bit of it is fantastic news for The Project. Under the guise of recording the whole experience for posterity, she takes her camera to work and snaps pictures of Mary Ann laughing as she leafs through a nightwear catalogue, Deb and Sam examining the newly-arrived buckets, Harry and Draco having a spirited sword fight using a ladle and a pair of tongs. She makes copies for her colleagues but the originals go straight into her notebook, along with a pretty piece of purple foil nudged in there at the last minute by Mr Abernathy.
“I thought that last one wasn’t going to go in,” Draco says, swiping his damp hair off his forehead with the back of his hand.
Once all of the scattered pencil crayons have been picked up and Rose has been stuffed into her coat, the four of them step out into the snow and head for number twelve. The walk isn’t a long one, but Harry is more aware than usual of the downside of living away from the alley. He thinks he’ll always be the last to know when something unusual happens, and there’s every possibility that the thief could hit Borteg’s and he wouldn’t be on the scene at all.
Harry doesn’t dare to smile back; instead, he looks at Draco, too.
“Ah, that’s just convention!” Fred says. He slings an arm around George and grins. “Blood is thicker than… um… is it still water if you’re married?”
He slouches in his chair, immediately stopping when the motion threatens to make his head explode. Groaning quietly, he lifts his mug to his mouth and sips at his steaming tea. It’s his third cup and he’s not sure it’s actually making a difference, but the hot liquid is soothing, and the fragrant scent seems to drive away the worst of the sour taste from his mouth. It could be worse, he knows that. Ron, Neville and Lee had ended the night in a far messier state than him, and George had had to be levitated up the stairs with his antlers and eyepatch still in place after vomiting into Molly’s geraniums. Still, it had been his stag party and it had been a rather brilliant night.
“Are you coming or not?” he calls, shivering and working his arms and legs in an attempt to stave off numbness.
“Perhaps you did,” Pansy says, smirking. “I’m not the one who keeps track.”
,” Harry mumbles in between bursts of laughter, mouth stretched wide.
“For shame, Potter. Why not?”
“Yes. They have plenty, too; their father gave them everything they ever wanted when he was alive,” Draco says. He glances at Harry. “And we all know what a fantastic idea that is. Anyway, while they’re waiting for her to shuffle off this mortal coil, they like to try persuading her to move into a retirement home so they can sell her house and her things and have done with it. So, no, I don’t think they’ll turn up here, unless they see it as an opportunity to nudge her in their preferred direction.”
“She’s full of weird ideas,” Harry mumbles, but then he shrugs and drains his coffee cup. “I’ll do it. That is, if you want me to… you know what the reporters are like and I don’t want to take focus away from the kids.”
Yesterday’s velvet suit has been packed away and Harry finds himself wondering just what occasion might call it back into use.
Harry stares at them, bewildered. “I’m sorry, are you telling me that Draco Malfoy—that man driving the bus—” He points at the red curtain, “lets you sit here every day and takes you on outings?”
Harry follows the ladies out of the bus and is surprised to find himself on a beach. Set above it in odd little layers is a small town, bustling with mid-morning shoppers, but the coastline itself is deserted, stretching for miles in a smooth, curved bay, seaweed-strewn sand licked by moody grey water that echoes the overcast sky. Harry has always rather liked the beach in winter, and this one has a particular wild beauty about it that appeals to him.
“Oh? Are you trying to turn into a Drenglebacked Gloonpuffer?” Luna asks.
“You could spell some of your other socks green,” Harry suggests, shifting Hugo on his lap.
Seconds later, everything below is being pounded by hot, fat raindrops. A collective groan goes up from the assembled students and all at once, the lawn seethes in a scramble to collect belongings and dash for the castle. Draco goes to grab Stanley only to find the lead whipping away from him as the beetle pelts across the grass as fast as his little legs can carry him. Clearly terrified, he tacks and clicks and weaves across the lawn, sodden leather leash snaking behind him. Draco glances at Harry for a split second and then breaks into a sprint. Despite his boots and the deluge hammering over him, Stanley is surprisingly speedy, and Draco has to push hard to keep him in sight. He can just about hear Harry’s footsteps behind him over the roar of the thunder and the rain hammering in his ears, and the knowledge that he, too, is concerned for Stanley makes every sliding, squelching step just a little bit easier.
have you been? I’ve been worried sick.”
The entire valley now looks beautiful, and Harry feels rather remorseful for thinking it grey and charmless. The hills are green, swathed with sharp crags and dotted with grazing sheep, the sky a cool, clear blue with trailing clouds, and the loch shimmering through endless colours in the sunlight.
It’s the perfect blending of two families that are both similar and different, and Harry has genuinely never seen George look happier. His pride is glowing around him in a glimmering corona, much like the one that surrounds and startles Harry every time Draco rests a hand on his thigh or straightens his posture to smile at someone he has only just met.
Florean smiles slowly and adjusts his pure white apron. “Apart from the fact that you always have the same thing, Harry, the ice cream seller must always have a little bit of the psychic about him.”
Draco shrugs. “Until the next time, I suppose.”
“I won’t. Let’s talk about Sirius Black, then.”
“I didn’t know you were there,” she says. “You were so quiet.”
“You’ll come back, won’t you?” Ida asks.
Feeling motivated at last, he throws on some old jeans and his favourite red jumper with the hole in it before heading down to the kitchen. Too many days of working late and buying chips on the way home have left the place looking rather neglected, but he throws open the back door, rolls up his sleeves and gets to work, and before long, the crisp breeze has whisked away the staleness and all the cups, plates, and pans are sitting in a clean, glistening pile on the draining board. Harry meanders around the kitchen, chopping and stirring and humming to himself until he has assembled a chicken curry with extra hidden vegetables, an enormous batch of pizza dough, and a plate of bacon, toast and tomatoes, which he eats at his newly-scrubbed table in contented silence.
“Yes, sir,” Draco murmurs, and Harry very deliberately doesn’t turn around to look at him.
Reuben and his young staff team are already occupying one large table, Mr Pike is chatting to Mr Jennings, who is clutching his collection box, and Draco is at the counter, yawning into his sleeve. Harry’s stomach swoops at the sight of him and he pushes the feeling away, telling himself firmly that it’s fine to be pleased that the idiot is alright, but there’s no need to get carried away.
Mr Abernathy catches a chunk of her hair in his beak and tugs it in clear reproach, but then accepts the cherry and retreats to the balcony to eat it. Sensing that she has been forgiven, Luna watches him for a moment and then turns out the lights. Tomorrow, she will be working the night shift, and it hasn’t taken her long to learn that one cannot be too well-rested for these occasions. As sleep pulls her under, her mind is filled with images of Harry and Draco, bathed in yellow light, running amok around the home and flinging pumpkins at one another while Mr Abernathy looks on, dressed in paisley pyjamas and a purple top hat.
“I think it’s very nice,” he says airily. “Haven’t got a uniform, have you?”
His feet are definitely warmer now, but he is clacking loudly with every step, and the soft stuff gives his usual trundle an exciting new bounce. Thrilled to bits with this development, he races up and down corridors, through secret tapestries and around rooms filled with desks and shiny things and very surprised mice. Near the place where the food comes out, he hides behind a statue from a group of big, noisy boys dressed in gold and red. In a funny little courtyard, he springs from one cobble to the next and waves chilly antennae at the stars. At the bottom of a curved staircase, he is scooped up by a tiny person in a blue scarf and held out at arm’s length.
“Morning, Shan,” he says without turning from the fire.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, perching on the coffee table with his cup. “I had some stuff I needed to do. Also… I’m sorry for saying you have no life.”
“I’m not staying closed for the whole day,” Draco insists, even when his mother emerges from her room and implores him to calm down. “They’ve had my knives and my brand new mixer; they’ve made a mess of my kitchen and buggered up my window, they’re not having anything else.”
Bewildered, Harry looks around at them all. “What makes you think I need help with men?”
Harry picks it up. It’s a new one, bright orange with a grinning spider on the front. He wonders how Ron feels about it.
“What was that for?” Draco asks, and Harry lets out a contented sigh.
“But old ladies love me.”
If she hadn’t known before, she had known then. And he will live. They all will. She has a quiet, calm belief that everything will be alright in the end. Two years on from all the madness, life is clacking along, all of them crammed into a little cart on a bumpy track to an uncertain place, and that’s fine. Of course, there is always room for more happiness, but that is where she and her project come in.
“My mother went into a shed?” Draco asks, arching an eyebrow. “Voluntarily?”
Granger stops. Her pale face turns impossibly paler.
Having absolutely nothing to do can feel rather lonely, and despite his hangover, Harry finds himself wishing that he had organised a project for over the holidays. Having finally come to the realisation that the Potter name could be used for good, Harry has been all over the world with his charity work, gathering and leading teams of volunteers in everything from the repair of magical buildings to founding and staffing safe homes for curse victims.
“What is it?” he asks, already enjoying the way whatever it is warms his hands.
Cautiously, they edge backwards, taking care as they descend the slippery grass on the hillside and make slow but steady progress in the direction of the barn with five curious goats in tow. Draco has to halt every few paces and call out to them again, but each time they trot forward, shiny black eyes alight with mischief and intelligence. By the time they reach the barn, all five are calling back to Draco at regular intervals, and Harry is beginning to develop a headache. Still, he can’t hide his feeling of triumph when he slams the barn door closed behind them, and he doesn’t say a word when Draco glances around, pulls out his wand and loops a simple containing ward around the whole building.
Everyone else is already wearing their new Christmas jumpers, including Hugo, who is sitting on the floor and chewing on his blue woollen sleeve. Harry rips off the paper and inspects this year’s offering, a soft, chunky knit in deep red with a small ‘H’ over the breast and a large picture of a triple-decker bus.
“Is it really?”
“What’s that, dear?”
The dead leave no glimmers.
“I’m so sorry, Rose. Please continue.”
“It’s a bit daft,” Draco says, pulling something from his coat and holding onto it, clearly uncertain. “And the tassels are a bit… bitten.”
Harry hesitates. “He seems… very nice.”
“No,” Draco calls from the driver’s seat. “The mouse would never wear such a ridiculous hat.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron mumbles, glancing at Draco and shaking his head. “It looks a bit different when you’re…” He looks at Rose and pauses. “… tired.”
“Don’t,” Draco says. “It’s good that you don’t think like that, believe me.”
“Sorry, Rosie,” he sighs, hoisting her up and ducking behind the stone building. “Ready?”
Luna laughs. “That’s wonderful, but you can’t be suggesting that I make them walk up and down Diagon Alley in their nightclothes…”
Harry is sitting cross-legged on the floor when Draco turns up with tea-smoked chicken and rice from a brand new stall on the market.
Bracing himself against the edge of the hole, Harry leans down and sweeps his wand around the interior. When he finds nothing, he casts a series of detection charms and then pulls himself upright.
“What is it about my ducks?” he asks as they leave the studio together on Friday afternoon.
“From what I remember, they’re wrong a lot,” Harry says, taking the cup and perching on the edge of a vast sofa that is upholstered in soft green-grey and draped in alpine blankets and fat cushions.
“Brought this whole thing out in the open, didn’t it? Secrets are dangerous, Harry,” he says, biting into a roast potato, and he looks so maddeningly sincere that Harry doesn’t know whether to laugh or spell the gravy pot over his head.
Rose sighs and leaves her desk, climbing up onto the windowsill and peering out into the dark street.
“You can catch the next one,” he says, wishing he hadn’t left his wand in the cabin. A stinging hex or two would be very well-placed about now.
“Oh,” Harry says, surprised. “So when did you—?”
“I do all sorts of things,” Draco says, folding his arms. “Now tell me what the thing is called.”
, Harry corrects silently.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Shut up.”
As he wanders into the back of the bus to join the biddies, he can hear Draco humming to himself. It sounds suspiciously like a Christmas song.
“Do you want to know what happened?” he demands, and then continues before Draco has chance to open his mouth. “Here’s what happened. In fact, let’s start right at the beginning of what happened, shall we? Let’s start with a child who was famous before he could walk. You’re familiar with that story, yes?”
“Don’t,” Draco interrupts, and something about his tone makes Harry drop the subject.
Luna spends the next couple of hours drifting around the home feeling light with happiness. Everything is going to plan; Harry and Draco are closer and more embarrassed than ever before, and the autumn sunlight filling the big old house seems to be putting everyone in a wonderful mood. At morning break, she follows Serafina and several of her classmates out into the tumbledown courtyard, watching a game or two of what they call ‘vampire hopscotch’ before joining Harry, Draco and Mary Ann on the benches.
Draco smiles slowly. “We can’t all be Harry Potter.”
When Mr Abernathy pecks lightly at her leg, she jumps and then sighs.
“Nice hat,” one says, nudging her friend. “Doesn’t he look handsome, Grace?”
“Which one of us?” Harry asks.
With a beleaguered look, Draco draws his wand and hits the swan easily with a gentle pulse of light. The bird gives one furious hiss and then flops down onto the stone, allowing Draco to heave it into the box and close the lid tightly. After another little flutter of applause and one or two sighs of disappointment, people begin to drift away, heading back to the stalls and nearby shops. Draco goes to collapse onto the edge of the fountain and Harry shakes his head.
“Just in case you missed that, everyone, my wonderful colleague has arrived almost an hour late and is now insulting my clothing, so that’s our Monday morning progressing nicely.”
“Was I asleep for long?”
Draco stares at Sam, panic pulling his face tight, and Luna can almost hear the conflict raging inside his head, the temptation to say, ‘fuck this, you don’t even pay me, I can walk out whenever I want to’ and the other voices, louder and dissenting, telling him that this place means just as much to him as it does to the others, that he’s going to have to deal with it, he’s going to have to…
Draco shakes his head. “No... it was something big.”
Molly smiles. “Would you like to stay for dinner? I’m making chicken pie.”
“She always likes what you get her,” he says at last, relieved when the door opens and a customer steps into the shop. He calls out to her. “Hello, let me know if you need any help.”
“I hate Movement to Music,” Draco mutters under his breath.
“Team-mate of Angelina’s,” Ron whispers. “Brian something, I think.”
“Draco!” Harry calls, but Draco doesn’t turn.
“I just made him a bit bigger,” Draco says, getting to his feet and stowing his wand away. “Are you ready to go?”
“I think you’d like a change today,” he says, regarding Harry shrewdly. “How about a cherry and almond cone with a drizzle of chocolate sauce?”
“It’s raining,” he says, apparently surprised.
“Listen, I just want to know if you’re alright... if you just say ‘Luna, I’m alright’, I promise I’ll go away,” she tries, but there is no response.
“Right, morning schedules, everyone,” he says, raising his voice to ensure their attention. “This meeting of the eclipse pyjama party committee has been postponed.”
“Me too,” Rose pipes up. “I’ll be here with you anyway, won’t I, Uncle Harry?”
“No one would know that horrible man was ever here,” Draco says. “I don’t know about any of you, but I will be opening tomorrow morning as usual.”
Ignoring it hasn’t made it go away. Ignoring things never makes them go away; the best one can hope for is a little more time, and now that time is up.
Puzzled, Harry looks at his chair. “What do you mean?”
“In that case, you won’t mind putting all of those boxes back in the right places. And then, if you like, you can bugger off, because I’ve got a stock take to do and you are very much under my feet,” Potter says, and then he steps over Draco and heads for the counter just as the bell above the door rings and two immaculately-dressed ladies step into the shop.
Harry looks at her with the air of someone about to explode. “Really?”
He opens an eye and two beady black ones peer up at him with an odd sort of affection. Amused, Harry rests a hand on Needle’s back.
“I just don’t want this to happen to anyone else,” Mrs Purley says. “I don’t want to think I can’t trust the people that come into the café.”
“A lot of damage, but everyone’s in there cleaning it up. I’d better get back and help them.” George turns to leave. “You know, I keep wondering what he did with all those presents.”
Jean joins him at the window, and together they watch Kettleworth striding through the rain in his immaculate blue uniform.
“I’m fine,” Harry says quickly, shrinking into his blanket.
“I’m browsing,” Draco says calmly, picking up a nearby item at random and examining it.
“I’ve still got these,” Thora says, producing a wad of twenty pound notes. “Does anyone want one? I don’t think they’re worth much.”
“We will,” Timothy says, voice coming out louder than usual and echoing around the kitchen.
Draco sighs, directing a small, relieved smile at the cobbles. “Yes, you could say that.”
“We’re good, thank you, Draco,” Hermione manages at last. “Are you going to skate?”
“I’m glad you agree. And, you know, it’s the not knowing that bothers me. It’s not that it matters what Malfoy does or why he does it…” Harry sighs and rubs at his face. He fixes Hugo with a conspiratorial eye. “Okay, it does matter a bit, but I’m not sure why, and I’m not asking Mummy and Daddy because no doubt they’ll tell me why and I don’t really want to know. Do you know what I mean?”
He doesn’t sound as though he believes Draco, and Draco doesn’t blame him, because ‘nothing is the matter’ is the biggest lie he has told in a long time. Something is very much the matter because he is pretty sure that somehow, he has fallen for Harry, and he has no idea what to do about it. It’s not his fault, he supposes; Harry is surprisingly easy to love. Startlingly easy, in fact. He is just as stubborn and unpredictable as Draco always knew, but he is also warm and funny and kind. He treats every strange creature in this strange place with equal respect and care, and Draco is certain that every last snake and beetle and rabbit and parrot adores him completely.
“I really didn’t mean for it to happen.”
“Really?” Harry murmurs, scrambling over to his side and dropping to his knees to light the dark recess with his wand. “Do you think they’re all here?”
He changes into clean clothes and leaves the house with the letter before he can change his mind, Apparating into Diagon Alley and heading straight for the Post Office. Feeling unsettled and liberated at the same time, he nips into the shop next door and emerges minutes later with a set of photographs from Draco’s camera. Shivering in the biting wind, he buttons up his coat, pulls his new red bobble hat over his ears and hangs back from the crowds of Christmas panic-buyers to look at them.
“Right,” he says after a minute or two of uncomfortably charged silence. “Let’s do something about this.”
Draco laughs softly. The tiny lines around his eyes crinkle. Harry’s stomach tightens.
“No bouncing on the sofa,” she calls. “Best behaviour, remember?”
“No,” Draco says. “Divide and conquer. You take one side, Needle and I will take the other.”
“That’s good coming from you,” he teases.
“It’s a piece of hessian from a standard goods sack. It’s not magical, it’s not special… it’s a sack,” Draco says with a shrug.
Harry hugs her back, inhaling the warm smell of beeswax and rosemary and smiling against the top of her head. She has more than a few greys these days but compared to the ladies from the Knight Bus, she seems vigorous with youth and the realisation lifts him.
“Mad?” Molly says, and Harry smiles.
“Is she angry?”
“You’re going to be useful right here, Draco,” she says, selecting a record for the warm-up and smiling with her back to him.
“It wasn’t me, you idiot. Deb looked a bit shifty this morning, maybe it was her.”
Hermione glances at the clock and then at Harry. “Sorry it’s so early. It’s just that the queues…”
Madam Malkin emerges from the fitting room and holds open a red velvet curtain almost identical to the one Draco has hung to separate the two parts of the bottom deck, and for the first time, he wonders just where he goes when he’s not driving the bus. What he does in his spare time. Whether he still flies, and if he likes reading or music or noisy clubs. If he and Juno go home to a little cottage or a swanky apartment or a country manor. He has no idea, and all at once that fact seems ridiculous.
